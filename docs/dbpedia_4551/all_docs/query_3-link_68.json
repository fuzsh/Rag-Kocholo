Leo Laporte here coming up, I'm going to find out if you can game on a Chromebook. Acer says you can. I'm not gonna review. And I'm Mikah Sargent and I talk about security for renters. Plus a big change to our favorite password manager. Then Chris from Miami, calls in on four cups of coffee and falls flat on his face. It's all next <laugh> Unas, the Tech Guys Podcasts you love from people you trust. This, this is TWI tweet. This is Ask The Tech Guys with Mikah Sargent and Leon LePort.

Coming up today, we're gonna have a visit from our spaceman rod pile. Oh, ground control to Major Pile <laugh>. Jason Howell will join us to talk about how people are using chat G p T in some interesting ways. Money making money, money, money, money, money. And of course we're gonna answer your calls. We've got some video questions. I am gonna demonst demonstrate a new Acer Chromebook designed for gaming. Father Ro Robert talked about it after c e s on Twitter, but they sent one to us.\n\n(00:02:02):\n\nSo I've been playing with it a little bit. I didn't know those two words could go together. Gaming, Chromebook Gaming. Gaming and Chromebook. That's interesting. Kind of does. I'll play the the hot new game. What's it called? Servants of the Forest or something. You're Survival Game. And you, I know you're gonna say it. What is it called? Pacman Suns. Suns of Sons of the Forest. Oh yeah. Cuz the Forest was an old game. And then they came out with a sequel called Sons. Have you played it yet? I want to, but no. When is Daughters of the Revolution coming out? <Laugh> later. That's my aunt. That's a secret. That's my Aunt Ginny. Then what else? Oh, I'm gonna show you the latest, greatest security feature our sponsor Bit Warden has added and how and how we should do it and, and what cautions you should consider before you do it. They've, they've moved away from pbk DF two to Argon two. Ooh, that one's easier to pronounce. At least. It's a lot, lot easier. That was a lot of letters. A lot of letters in the news. You talked to Mark Germond on Thursday. Yeah.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:03:02):\n\nYeah. So mark Germond had a story over on Bloomberg talking about Apple finally getting to a place where now we could see a future in which apple Watch is able to track blood glucose. Huge. This is, this is very big because frankly, up to this point, it was moonshot for every company, meaning that it was one of these things that, oh, it'd be cool if we could do this, but there were no proofs of concept. There were no Google had what they claimed was a proof of concept with a a contact you'd put in your eye that would then use your tears to determine blood glucose. But they ended up shelving that project. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:40):\n\nThey shelved it. I don't know if it didn't work or they just got tired of spending money. Well, and which is very\n\nMikah Sargent (00:03:45):\n\nGoogle may very well be Yes, exactly. They they do that a\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:47):\n\nLot. You know, they're sharing desks now at Google. Are they really? Yeah. If you had a desk and you went home, I could use your desk and then when you'd come back and want it\n\nMikah Sargent (00:03:54):\n\nBack, I used to work at a job where it was like that. How\n\nLeo Laporte (00:03:56):\n\nBroke do you have to be to do that? Google pretty broke. That sounds like Elon Musk's Twitter\n\nMikah Sargent (00:04:01):\n\n<Laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:01):\n\nBut, so there are 40 million, almost 40 million diabetics in the us Yes. 11% of the population. All of them. I mean, I do finger pricks. I've worn the, the glucose meter mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. but all of them would love it if they could have continuous glucose monitoring in your watch\n\nMikah Sargent (00:04:18):\n\nIn a way that you don't, because even those ones, you were wrist invasive. You ha Or the Yeah. The arm. You have to replace them too every\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:24):\n\nTwo weeks. And they send a little, they're not non-invasive. Right. They do send a little filament <laugh> into your skin. It doesn't hurt, but it's still there and it's a little weird. It would be amazing. It would also be probably save lives.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:04:38):\n\nYes. And that, see, but that's the thing that makes this so difficult because a as we've gotten up to this point, think about the technologies that are in the Apple Watch now. We've got heart rate, we've got ECG, electrocardiogram, we've got blood oxygen, and all of these are little data points that Apple can share with us that we then use to kind of go from there. But when you think about blood glucose, this is something that could literally be life or death. If this is misreading my blood glucose levels and I need to make adjustments quickly, and I'm not in a place where I can do that, that could be life or death. And so I think that this is one that they, if they're gonna do it, they've gotta get it exactly right. Because with the ecg, with these other technologies, it's more been, oh, I was alerted to something that I wasn't aware of. I went to the doctor Right. And my life was saved. It doesn't work the same way with blood news.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:31):\n\nNo, no, no. It's interesting. They've got a, it, it's come part of the Apple Exploratory Design group, which is a, basically an r and d group. Right. And they one\n\nMikah Sargent (00:05:41):\n\nOf like four that they've got at\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:42):\n\nThe company, it's like a moonshot. And they think they've got some sort of laser ability. They, you know, all of this stuff, you know, even today, the Apple Watch shoots light into your mm-hmm. <Affirmative> wrists. That's why it doesn't work well with people with a lot of wrist hair or tattoos. It shoots light into your wrist and then measures\n\nMikah Sargent (00:06:00):\n\nVarious how it's absorbed and\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:01):\n\nYeah. Various how refracted features of your blood. And they think they can do it with blood glucoses, which it now, by the way, this has been going on for years. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we'll see. But I hope it's true.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:06:11):\n\nTh and that's because there is a breakthrough here. First, there's a special chip that they've I they've partially acquired and partially have been working on. And instead of looking at the blood itself, they have figured out that if they look at what's called interstitial fluid, which I know <laugh>, no one likes that word fluid, but interstitial fluid is this substance that is good for looking at, for blood glucose. And when they shine those lasers, they shine those lights. And the way that the light refracts is what they can actually measure. They pop that into an algorithm, and then from there can determine blood glucose levels. What's also fascinating about this is this is, it's like levels of secrecy with the top secret group being the one working on AR and vr. Then you've got the one that's working on the car and in deep, deep, deep, deep, deep down underground is this group that's working on blood glucose.\n\n(00:07:03):\n\nWhat they've done is they actually had a company nearby that doesn't outwardly have any ties to Apple. So that when they bring people in to have these tests done, the, the people know that they're taking part in these tests, but it's with this third party group. They don't know they're going to Apple and having these tests done. And so that's just to maintain that secrecy as they've been working on this. So definitely you should check out my interview with Mark Germond over on Tech News Weekly. Also read his piece because it goes into more depth about kind of the Yeah. Behind the scenes stuff with this,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:33):\n\nIt's actually spec spectroscopy, which is kind of interesting. We use spectroscopy to see what elements there are in, in in asteroids. We've, we now know there's some interesting elements in that asteroid up there. What's it called? Ragner Rock, whatever. <Laugh>. <laugh>. Probably not Ragner Rock. That, that, that or in or in the Stars. And, and we can do it in your blood\n\nMikah Sargent (00:07:54):\n\nToo. And when I was, when I was younger, I got to go into a lab with a scientist and we, he showed me all these different machines and one of them was light spectro spectroscopy machine. I took some saliva, put it in, you spin it around and break it into its component parts, and then using all these different materials to see what made up. And I remember even back then going, wouldn't it be so cool if you could just do this with something that would tell us? I, I think about nutrition, for example, I'm taking in foods throughout the day. If I had something you'd know immediately Yeah. That is actually going Yeah. The vitamins that I'm getting from it, all that kinda stuff. Yeah. I just think it's brilliant.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:32):\n\nIt's true. It's, I guess they could go beyond glucose with this chip, so that would be very interesting. Yeah, absolutely. Supreme Court there, give us and take us away. Oof. There's good news and there's bad news and the bad news. The Supreme Court decided not to take the Wikipedia case suing the NSA for its global data collection. This case has been going on since 2015. Wikimedia Foundation, which is the parent company of Wikipedia sued, challenging the legality of their so-called upstream. You, we, we finally figured out thanks to Edward Snowden and other revelations that the NSA wasn't like getting into your Google account. There was just, they were just sitting out there in on the cloud and the internet watching stuff come and go outta your Google account. That upstream collection, that's all they needed. And they were doing it quite aggressively.\n\n(00:09:21):\n\nBut the lower court had ruled that this was protected by the whatever they call it, the US Secrets Act, it would violate national security if this lawsuit were to go forward. The Supreme Court agreed. So, so I guess all that is, is an acknowledgement that you're getting spied on all the time. Yeah. <laugh> just so you know. Right. and it's warrantless and it has nothing to do with suspicion. It's just we're gonna collect everything we can and then we got it. And if we need it, we've got it. The other good news from the Supreme Court may be good news. I don't know. They're hearing, they heard two very important cases for the internet this week. The most important was on Tuesday. Gonzalez versus Google. The lawsuit says that Google's responsible for its algorithmic recommendations. And it ra in this case, it, they say it radicalized militants and caused the death of, sadly the death of their daughter in a Paris incident 2015.\n\n(00:10:23):\n\nBut the real issue is section two 30, which protects us, protects our chatroom, protects comments you make in our discord, protects comments you're even making right now in our Zoom mm-hmm. <Affirmative> we can't get sued for those, only the person who posts them. That makes sense. The person who created the whatever it is, should be sued for. We also can't get sued for taking it down. And that's really important. Moderation is also protected by Section two 30. So this isn't going against the heart of Section two 30, but but they said what we want to do is slice off this idea of algorithmic recommendations and say that is, once you're doing that, you're going beyond Section two 30. You're actually publishing content on your own. They even debated whether a thumbnail of a video on, on YouTube is created by the content creator or Google.\n\n(00:11:14):\n\nMm-Hmm. <affirmative>. It's the hint, hint is the content creator. But they seem confused by that. As did I said, by the way, Google's attorney and Gonzalez attorney, it was a very interesting argument though. And we had Kathy Gillis who is an attorney who she was actually in the Supreme Court in the courtroom on Tuesday for those oral arguments. We had her on this week in Google on Wednesday. Wow. She had a lot of thoughts. Generally, it looks like the Justices wow. Surprising. Understand the consequences of chiseling away in any form of fashion. At section two 30, judge Kavanaugh said, that's really Congress's job, not ours. Judge Keg Justice Kagan was hysterical. She said, you don't have the nine greatest experts on the internet here, <laugh> admitting that. In fact, many of them admitted, we, we don't really understand this, but we gather any changes to this could be horrific for the internet, which is Right.\n\n(00:12:08):\n\nThat's I'm glad, which is true. Kathy Gillis herself wrote an amicus brief protector one of many a flood of amicus briefs that the Supreme Court got to see saying that, including the EF F and others. So I think, you know, you can't always judge what the Supreme Court is gonna do for oral arguments, but I think it went I think it went pretty well. They showed that they realized that anything they would do would have great consequence, maybe unintended consequence. And I think they probably, I hope we'll find out maybe in June I hope they will leave this to Congress and that Congress will not do anything Uhhuh, because that's their specialty. Ladies and gentlemen. Very good at doing nothing. <Laugh>. That's us <laugh>. All right. Let's do you want to, do you wanna see what Bit Warden is up to Yeah, let's talk about that.\n\n(00:12:55):\n\nOkay. I wanna warn people that you shouldn't do this <laugh> until you're completely updated on Bit Warden. And you can see here I am getting the offer re restarts update version 2020 3.2 dot oh is ready to install. This is on the desktop application. Bit Warden, I should mention a sponsor. They're a password manager. And the only reason I bring this up is cuz a lot of you have moved to bit Warden after last passes fiasco. And there's a lot of interest. We talked a lot about it in what they call the password hashing. So your master password, of course, is what gets into the vault. Last pass bit Warden, none of the companies that do password management have access to your, your master password, but they have to have some way of validating it to unlock the vault. Right? Right. They have to, you type something in, they have to somehow validate that that's real.\n\n(00:13:45):\n\nSo what they do is they take your password and they hash it, they modify it, they hash it, and they salt it. They mess it up in such a, in a one way process in such a way that they can verify that that is your correct password, but nobody having the hash can unlock your vault. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, does that make sense? The hashing algorithm they've been using, and almost everybody uses, is called P B K D F two seven words pbk D F two. And one of the problems LastPass had is they had set the iteration level for pbk DF two, the number of times it was hashed to a very low number initially one than 500 O osp. The security recommendation for the web folks, <laugh> said it should be much higher that you should have at least 300,000 iterations last pass. And bit Warden allow you to go up to 2 million.\n\n(00:14:39):\n\nThe downside, of course, is it slows your machine down because it has to go through those hashing processes to unlock your fault. It has says, oh, here's the key typed, let's run it through it 2 million times. Now we know it's okay, but on modern machines, that's a second or two. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's not, it's not untenable. Nevertheless, pbk DF two is attackable. It can be brute forced, especially by these new modern attacks based on graphics cards, GPUs. So there's another way of doing it called Argon two. And this is one of the benefits Bit Warden has by being open source Argon two Weston, who has been co corresponding with Steve, among others, has taken it on himself to urge bit warden to write the code and then urge bit warden with what they call a poll request to add it to their open source.\n\n(00:15:29):\n\nThey've agreed. Wow. And so it's now available to you, but here's the catch. It's only available to you on 2020 3.2 fine. You won't be able to change it to Argon two unless you have that. But it will break anything that is not updated at 2020 3.2. That means your browser plugins your older Android devices. So you really, before you do this, you want to look for this note that I got from Bit Warden to update, make sure you're on 2020 3.2 and you want to do it everywhere. Okay? That's the most important thing. But once you've done that, once you've verified, you know, you can go into your bit Warden Vault and see, once you verified that, ah, I'm gonna letter my master password. No looking, oh, no looking. It's\n\nMikah Sargent (00:16:19):\n\nP BK <laugh>\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:22):\n\nD Don't say that.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:16:24):\n\n<Laugh> salt, Hank,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:29):\n\nStop, stop, stop. Okay, now I'm in. Oh, I gotta enter it one more time. I'm gonna show you how you can change this algorithm one more time. And that's good, right? They, they, you want them to make you enter this password a bunch of times.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:16:42):\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:43):\n\nSo no bad guy can do this.\n\n(00:16:50):\n\nOops. It's such a long password. I made a very long password. By the way, if you have a very long, strong password, that's more important even than the hashing. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So make sure you do that because even with a low iteration count on pbk DF two, if you have a good password, it's still gonna take a bad guy an untenable amount of time to crack it. This is even better. So now you can go look at my page again. This is the K D f, the key derivative algorithm. They even have a little, what the heck said <laugh>. You can go over here and you can read all about it if you, if you want. It's a Wikipedia article. No. The default, which for most password managers has always been P P D K D F two has now expanded to include Argon two. There is one password manager I should give him credit dash lane that supports Argon two.\n\n(00:17:41):\n\nOnce you go to argon two, you're gonna see some suggested parameters. And this has confused a lot of people iterations, memory, parallelism. So I'm gonna point you to a very good, let me click this. A very good no, this is, yeah, Reddit thread from 12 days ago started by Padre talking about this. And Questin by the way, chimes in and explains what's going on. And, and, and the question was, well, what should I set these parameters to? I'll, I'll give you the shortcut. Okay. Just let them stay the way they are. It doesn't really matter at this point down the road, you might be able to turn 'em up and just like pbk df two higher numbers means slower hashing. So, but this speed should, this numb, these numbers should be acceptable for everybody once you change it though. And again, don't do this until you've verified that every version of Bit Warden you're using on all your stuff has been updated to 20 23, 2 or later.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:18:45):\n\nOkay. Cuz you won't be able to get in otherwise.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:48):\n\nYeah. That whatever device is using the older version will say, I don't know what argon is. What that what are you talk, what, what Check, what you talk about Willis. So this is in your, you have to do this on the web version of Bit Warden. You'll see it's in your account settings under your security. And it's the third tab in keys encryption, key settings, argon two I I would say you pr you know, if you've already updated your pbk DF two, I'd set mine at 2 million. The maximum you, there's no rush to do this. But I wanted to show people and let people know.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:19:19):\n\nWhen does that slowdown that you're talking about happen? Like when should people be on the lookout for that? Is it every time I go to type in my password? Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:19:27):\n\nIt's just the first time you open bit warden on your device. So you know, you have to open the vault to use it and sometimes it closes the vault. If you haven't used it in a while, those settings are up to you. Yeah. Every time you reopen the vault, it has to take your password every time you'd enter your password. In other words, you enter your password, it takes, your password, goes through those hashes, says thumbs up, downloads the vault, and now you have it. And that could take several seconds. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, you've probably noticed that when you do it in your, in your browser and you log, log in for the first time Yep. To your password manager. That's what's going on. That chief delay, there's two parts of the delay. The chief delay is the hashing. The second part is it has to download the entire vault.\n\n(00:20:10):\n\nAnd that, you know, so in other words, it keeps the vault as an encrypted blob up there. They don't have the password. Only you have the password. Once you've entered the password on a client in bit warden or any password manager, it verifies it using these password derivative functions goes. Yeah, that's right. And it says, now bring down the vault. It might be doing that simultaneously. Bring down the vault and, and unencrypted. So good, good advice. Good to pay attention. Steve Gibson talked about it on Tuesday. I was very pleased to see that. It, it actually happened to Ston. Thank you. That's the kind of open source contribution that makes a difference in a lot of lives. It's kinda like a blood glucose monitor your watch. It can save a lot of people. So we want to put the word out now, the most important segment on the show every week. What is Ant having for lunch today? <Laugh> looks pretty good. Is that fried chicken? No sir.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:21:02):\n\nThis is, that says pizza, isn't it? Chicago?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:04):\n\nDeep Dish. Oh, Chicago baby. Mm mm And I noticed you took the mug that says I World's best Boss. So that's good. Am I not? Yes, you is.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:21:17):\n\n<Laugh> is you. Oh, is you. Ain't the best boss.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:21):\n\n<Laugh>. I thought it was mine. But you know what, truthfully, it, it really is yours. <Laugh>. So, so we had a lot of people been waiting on hold. We should tell you call dot twi tv on your phone is easiest because you already, you know, you open your browser, you enter in the browser, call TWI tv. If you have Zoom, it'll launch it. If you don't, you can actually use the web version. We know your microphone and camera work on your phone. Right? Mostly. And and so's probably the easiest way to call, but I notice people mostly still use desktops to call us. You can also send us email, ask the tech guys@twit.tv and you can, if even better, you can send us a a, a video via email. That'd be really awesome. There was one thing I I did want to mention before we get to the call.\n\n(00:22:04):\n\nSo let's cue up the calls. Raise your hand if you've got a question. I was in our forum and somebody B g o z. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, BG Oz, I'm guessing Big Oz. Big Oz had some help for Mark from last week. Remember Mark, who's an Australian, was coming to the US Oh yeah. Yeah. And wanted to know about what to do for a us sim. So BG oz in response to Mark's query about mobile usage while visiting the US just completed eight weeks. Ozzies do that. They come for a long time with the best mobile access in the last 10 years of travel, he is using Telstra at home. Overseas coverage would be very expensive. So after he said this time after hearing Rich tomorrow's experience, which I haven't heard, but apparently he used Mint, installed the Mint app while at home, downloaded and installed the Mint, EIM Mint are sponsor also.\n\n(00:23:02):\n\nRight. this enabled wifi calling on Mint under settings then allowed me to subscribe to the three month plan. This is actually I think what we talked about with Mark, right? Yeah. Three month plan activate the plan wall in Australia. He could still use the number on wifi even though Mint Works only in the us. So he is now got a Australian and a US number. Nice. He's got two sims. See he can put up to eight sims on an iPhone, which is eight eims on an iPhone. So in, in the US the Telstra number still worked. He could access all those six digit sign-on codes. Right? Good. Yes. The two factor codes. No costs no extra to access the Telstra number overseas. As long as you're doing it in wifi, right? That's the wifi calling. So wifi calling hotel, you're using that.\n\n(00:23:48):\n\nHe says just be careful cuz if you leave the MIT mobile sim active in Australia because there's nobody no signal to pick up. It's gonna kill your battery as it searches and searches and searches. Got it. So thank you BG Oz. Thank you for that update. That's a good place to go. So he was saying we should have some way of, of signaling when we have an update from one of our questions, go to the TWIT forums twit.community. Leave it there for me. This is a great place. I check it every day. So it's a great place to leave those thoughts or comments. Twit.Community, it's free. I do have to approve all signups, but I did that pretty quickly. Yep. just like our masin on instance. I don't you could leave it on Masin. I don't think that's as good an idea.\n\n(00:24:30):\n\nOnly because like Twitter, Mastodon Scrolls and Scrolls, maybe not like Twitter. Twitter <laugh> just fired on Saturday yesterday. 50 more engineers, they've stopped paying their Slack bill, which means there's no way of communicating. And their issue tracker Jira. Stop paying for that. It's just a it's just a mess. It's a mess. Yeah. <laugh> Twit Social is our Mastodon and it's actually, I think it's good if not better than than Twitter. It's a nicer place. The local timeline is all of our our regular listeners and I only approve your membership in our, in our twit social. If you can demonstrate that you listen to our shows. So just say, Mikah sent me <laugh>. There you go. You can even spell it with a C if you want. Yeah. But at least I'll know, you know, you're not some, some some normal person off the street. All right. I want to take some calls. Let's see. Let's do it. Ivan has his hand raised high. He's going, oh, oh, Mr. Kata. Mr. Kata. Mr. Kata. <laugh>. Mr. Qk. You know that, you know that reference. I only know it because of the Office <laugh>. Oh, okay. They reference it to the office. It's funny. I know a lot of references from the forties cuz of Mad Magazine. So, you know, you get this, it's derivative. Hey Ivan, welcome to ask the tech guys.\n\nCaller 1 (00:25:47):\n\nHello Mikah. Thanks for taking my call.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:49):\n\nOur pleasure. Welcome.\n\nCaller 1 (00:25:52):\n\nI wanted to tell you one thing before I get into my question. Yes. Is I'm retiring something that I've used often with you and that is the moniker of Dev Null.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:02):\n\nOh,\n\nCaller 1 (00:26:04):\n\nThat was radio. I'm not gonna use it anymore.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:07):\n\n<Laugh>.\n\n(00:26:08):\n\nWell, it's not, it's, it's okay to do that because it, I don't own it. Dev Null was the character that I played on MSNBC's the site and it was a virtual character. And this is in 1995. So this is like the first time anybody in real time did a virtual character. So it had, would sit there and stare at a blue dot and I would talk to her. But Dev Null is, as you probably know, a Unix term. It means, you know, the, the bit bucket. So you're more than welcome to be Dev Null\n\nCaller 1 (00:26:38):\n\n<Laugh>,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:39):\n\nBut you can't be Chief Twit. There's only one Chief Twit\n\nCaller 1 (00:26:43):\n\n<Laugh>. He'll always be Devin Al Tomi.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:46):\n\nAw, thank you. I don't do that voice anymore though. That was the most g grading annoying voice and I deeply regret choosing it at the time. Annoying.\n\nCaller 1 (00:26:55):\n\nIt was a different era. It\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:57):\n\nWas times were changed. What's up?\n\nCaller 1 (00:27:00):\n\nOkay, my question involves Linux. You got me going\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:06):\n\n<Laugh>.\n\nCaller 1 (00:27:09):\n\nYou got me going in that direction. And so I've decided to, you know, put well little I know into a dangerous situation. So Good. You know how\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:20):\n\nNo, that's good. Because that's how you learn, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.\n\nCaller 1 (00:27:23):\n\nExactly. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:23):\n\nWhat exactly. If, if you just go within the same old ruts that you've gone your whole life, you'll never see the beautiful, you know, landscape. So you can use Windows in Mac and it probably should when you're, you know, in a, in a, you know, I have to crash out a report for business for your work or something. But playing at home have some fun branch out. Yeah. Tell me about, well, I\n\nCaller 1 (00:27:43):\n\nHave a home, I have a home network. I have oh eight or nine computers on it. Oh yeah, you're good. And I decided to turn one of the desktops into a Linux box, putting Linux Mint two 20.3 on it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:27:57):\n\nGood choice.\n\nCaller 1 (00:27:57):\n\nAnd what I've been doing with that is, is using it as a Torrance download box and you know, other things as well. Sure.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:28:07):\n\nIt's like a little service. But\n\nCaller 1 (00:28:08):\n\nI also, yeah. I also wanted to put, I have two physical drives, two additional physical drives in it, one's formatted N T F S, the other's formatted XT four. And what I wanted to do was to be able to connect those from like a Windows machine or a Mac machine that's on the network so that somebody can just drop files there to back up or, you know, anything like that. Or to play some off of it\n\nLeo Laporte (00:28:38):\n\nWithin the, within the HO house or do you want to do it to the outside now?\n\nCaller 1 (00:28:41):\n\nWithin the house? Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:28:42):\n\nWithin the house. That's a lot safer and it's very risky to, very risky to allow people to drop files on your computer from outside.\n\nCaller 1 (00:28:49):\n\nOh yeah. No, no. Wouldn't do that. Yeah. But I can't get, I can get the Linux part to recognize those other two drives. Right. But I can't get either Windows or Mac that are on the network to see either of those drives. They can see the Linux Drive. Huh. But they can't see the two that are also in that box.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:11):\n\nHuh. Interesting. So are you using some sort of file sharing like S M B on or samba on the Linnux box?\n\nCaller 1 (00:29:24):\n\nYes. Okay. And turn that on.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:25):\n\nOkay. And they, so they can, it's interesting cuz they are able to see the Linux box, the, the internal drive. Fine. They can read and write to\n\nCaller 1 (00:29:34):\n\nIt. Right. And can transfer files to it and back and forth.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:37):\n\nBut these\n\nCaller 1 (00:29:38):\n\nAttached what I two\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:40):\n\nAnd, and these, pardon me, attached, these attached drives are attached via U sb\n\nCaller 1 (00:29:44):\n\nNo, they're internal.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:45):\n\nThey're, they're inside the computer. Yeah, I think that, and I'm not sure what's going on, but I think you're gonna wanna look at your FS tab. Okay. Do you know what that is?\n\nCaller 1 (00:29:56):\n\nI have no idea.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:57):\n\n<Laugh> FS tab is a, is actually a plain text file. It's the file system and it describes all the drives on there. And I if you, if you be, you, you wanna might be read up on this, don't, don't just do this. Now this is where you could easily get into trouble. You can make machine non bootable, but read up a little bit on it. But you can, right now you can Cat slash Etsy slash fs tab and you can see what the settings are in there. And every single device will have a setting now. Yeah. I think Mint still uses this. There, there, there. This is kinda old school, but I suspect Mint still uses this. And at that point you'll see there is a difference somewhere in the settings for the drive they can see and those other two drives. And almost certainly it's in the sharing settings.\n\n(00:30:49):\n\nSo I think that's something that I'm gonna leave to you. <Laugh>. <laugh>. Yeah, that's fine. But cuz I don't, I don't, I can't, you know, you'd have to show me your FS tab and all that stuff. Right. But that's a pointer in the direction that you wanna look at. And if you and that's what I need. Yeah, yeah. If you look at you know, one of the reasons I like Arch and Arch derivatives actually use Manjaro is the arch Wiki is the single best resource for Linux information. Even if you're not using Arch, you using Mint, which is a Debian derivative. But even then look at the arch Wiki for FS tab because it, it, it's amazing. It's got the most complete information and that's because people who use Arch are generally building their system software from scratch. You know, they, they put the kernel in and they put the different things in bit by bit. So they'll be a lot of extensive documentation on FS tab.\n\nCaller 1 (00:31:46):\n\nOkay. Thank you. That, that points me in a direction. And that's what I was really\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:50):\n\nYeah. That's the way Linux works. Right. In fact, in a way we're kinda like a user group. You would go to a Linux user group, a lug, and you would raise your hand and say, Hey, I'm doing this. And then somebody would stand up, some idiot like me would say, say, well I'll have you looked at the FS tab and then you Yeah, that's, it's a pointer. Ultimately it's best for you to figure it out. Cuz what a lot of us do, I do this too. I'm guilty of it is we is we go, we look up an article and we just copy it without knowing what the hell we're doing. Yeah. And that's when you can get a lot <laugh>, a lot of trouble <laugh>. You also wanna, yeah. So you wanna kinda understand it. On the other hand, I've done a lot of messing around with FS tab and I've broken my systems many times, so yeah, that's part of the, part of the fun Bruce FS tab.\n\nCaller 1 (00:32:34):\n\nOne other quick Go\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:35):\n\nAhead. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\n\nCaller 1 (00:32:36):\n\nI was just gonna say one other quick question. Yes. coming from the predominantly Windows and Mac world, if I, you started me off on Pop os nice\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:47):\n\nAnd\n\nCaller 1 (00:32:47):\n\nVery good and really enjoy it, but I've outgrown it and so I want to upgrade to make it another mint box or maybe even go with the arch linnux.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:59):\n\nWhat, when you say outgrown it, what does that mean?\n\nCaller 1 (00:33:01):\n\nWell, I just, I I find that it's locked down in some ways Yeah. Where you can't do things that Yeah. I want to do and, and you know, things that I've been able to do with the Mint that I couldn't even approach on right. On\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:16):\n\nOs Right. So I would say you're a good candidate for Arch, especially since you have nine machines. Take one other machine, not the one you're using for Mint and and what you're gonna, you have another one and you're gonna go to the Arch Wiki and you're gonna go step by step and it you will fail a few times. The biggest problem I've had installing Arch is just u e f I e F five and and bios, you know, modern machines don't use BIOS anymore. They use U efi and it's kind of tricky setting that up. Once you get to that point, you'll build Arch from scratch. And what's great about it is you will learn things like FS tab, you will learn how all this stuff integrates and works, so you'll have a much deeper understanding. The other reason people use Arch is because there's absolute freedom.\n\n(00:34:03):\n\nYou only install the thing you want. You don't have to install anything else. And if you want something new, you've got, you know, how you got there and you can do it again, the arch Wiki, here's the FS tab article in the Arch Wiki and here's what an FS tab looks like. And you're gonna see, and I suspect that the issue is gonna be in here some of the settings, but this is actually, look how good this Arch Wiki is. It, it talks about how an FS tab is configured, what those different columns mean. It gives you all sorts of useful stuff. And I think somewhere in there is gonna be something that will help you make those devices be seen by everything on the network. Oh, you can agree? Yeah. Almost, almost. You can almost doc almost duplicate the one that is working, you know, on the ones that aren't working mm-hmm. <Affirmative>\n\n(00:34:51):\n\nAnd that may Careful again, but this look how complete this is. Oh yeah. And this is why you should, you should actually be using Arch. I'm, I, you know, I, everybody who uses Linux, when you get to that, the point where you, I want more control should install Arch once, and then I just install manjaro, which is just an installer on top of Arch because I don't want to do that again. But yeah, absolutely. You will learn so much about the internals that you'll be much more confident. You'll be answering the questions, not me.\n\nCaller 1 (00:35:20):\n\nWell, okay, great.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:21):\n\nPleasure to talk to\n\nCaller 1 (00:35:22):\n\nYou. That's what I wanna do.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:23):\n\nIt's so, where, where I forgot to ask, where are you calling from?\n\nCaller 1 (00:35:27):\n\nWest coa, California. Nice. Southern California. Nice. That's great. Near Pasadena.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:31):\n\nYeah, I know where it is. That's great. Hey, thank you for joining us on the asec guys. Thanks\n\nMikah Sargent (00:35:36):\n\nSo much.\n\nCaller 1 (00:35:36):\n\nThank.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:37):\n\nAppreciate it. I'm sure I'll be back. <Laugh> anytime back. Hey Leo. I messed up my FS tab. <Laugh> Uhoh can't help you there. I really, I'm Justin, do you want to talk to us or you don't have your hand raised, but I love your, I love the hacker, the view. Yeah, the few and Justin's room is beautiful. So let me, lemme just pick up on Justin, even though he doesn't have his hand raised. We've been watching him hacking away at something for a while.\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:08):\n\nAll right.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:09):\n\nHey Justin, the\n\nMikah Sargent (00:36:09):\n\nSound. Hello, Justin.\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:11):\n\nHey,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:13):\n\nNow you see why we think he's a hacker <laugh>. Actually, we had a better view of what you were hacking. Now is that, is that a background or is that really your house?\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:23):\n\nThat's the house. Let\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:24):\n\nMe, yeah. Behind you. There's a window to the outside. It's beautiful. Where do you live\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:32):\n\nIn? Beautiful Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:35):\n\nAh, is it snowy right now?\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:39):\n\nIt's, we just got through a cold snap, so today's actually quite nice.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:43):\n\nYeah. It's all\n\nCaller 2 (00:36:44):\n\nWeek. Most mornings of us up. The conversion\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:49):\n\nFriend of mine in a rock band that played there told me he is the coldest place he ever played in his life.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:36:57):\n\nWinter peg. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:58):\n\nWinter peg. Yeah.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:37:00):\n\nYeah. There we go. There, there for a second. Your audio changed, but you sound good\n\nCaller 2 (00:37:03):\n\nAgain. Oh, sorry about that.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:05):\n\nNo problem. How can we help?\n\nCaller 2 (00:37:08):\n\nAll right. So I have a website for my photography and my music and I created it with Squarespace and I like the site as it is, but to keep this site up cost me about 350 bucks a year. Yikes. So I guess two questions. Where can I host my site for less and how can I transfer the content or most of it at least without starting from scratch?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:35):\n\nYeah. Squarespace is expensive. They've got, they got 'em. Raise the money to pay for Adam Driver in the Super Bowl commercials, <laugh>. It's just not, it's not cheap. You certainly can rent a website for a lot less depending on how much you want to do it.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:37:48):\n\nExactly. Where's your,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:49):\n\nWhere's\n\nMikah Sargent (00:37:49):\n\nYour website? Yeah, so I will tell you my main website is hosted at Squarespace. It's been there for a long time, but I don't use a lot of those extra features that end up costing more. I had a friend recently who asked me this same question and he just wanted a one page site. And so I pointed him over to a site called card, c a r r d.co. Card mostly charges year annually and I think it's like $25 a year. But it sounds like if you're paying about $350 a year, you might be doing blogging or something on your site or selling products or something. What, what do you wanting?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:27):\n\nThis is a, this is the name tells you what it is. It's like a calling card. It's a one page site. Yeah. And so that's why it's so cheap. And,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:38:33):\n\nAnd the, the cool thing is though, there are different variations. So there's, it's scrollable if you want it to be. Oh, okay. But yes, for the most part. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:41):\n\nYou can make a long single page.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:38:42):\n\nYeah. You can do forms, you can do you know, little widgets and stuff like that. You can, you can make a full page with it. But\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:49):\n\n$19 a year,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:38:50):\n\nThere you go. $19 a year. Wow. And that's what the custom domain, so you can have it with whatever domain you have. Nice. Justin the hacker.com or whatever it happens\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:59):\n\nTo be. Do you embed, do you put your music on the site for download and, and purchase and that kind of thing?\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:05):\n\nNot download and purchase. But I do have a player up there and I mean, it's already on all the streaming services. Yeah, you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:12):\n\nCan have an embedded SoundCloud player, whatever that\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:15):\n\nWould be Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:17):\n\nSo that's\n\nCaller 2 (00:39:18):\n\nMy clicker link there as well. Okay. So but I don't use the site selling, like I have gone out to my Threadless page. So Squarespace isn't handling any commerce either. Maybe I've just, maybe my plan is wrong. That could be a Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:33):\n\nI think you over block.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:39:34):\n\nYeah. Yeah. It does sound like you may have over, over purchased. Now depending on what you were trying to export that can get complicated. If it was just, if it was a blog you were trying to do, that's easier because you can get the r s s feed and then essentially import that RSS feed. So what if, if you do decide to make the change, I think your best bet is going to be some Google FU where you're looking at transfer Squarespace two blank and see what tools might be out there. Because it's not as simple as just going file save as, and then, you know, uploading, unless of course you were planning to host it on your own or, or do it, you know, completely from scratch. Now,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:14):\n\nIf you're more sophisticated, there are places you can have very good sites for free, as long as you don't need, you know, modern sites, Squarespace, WordPress Google blog spot, all are set up in such a way that you have the formatting and design of the page, and then you have a database for the content. And they're basically a content engine that pulls the database in. So you write your posts in the, in the database, comments go in the database, and then the design pulls it in. And that's a much more complicated setup. That's, that's called a dynamic page. If you have a, what's a, a static page? My website, leo.fm is a static page. It's plain html. There's no database on the, it's just plain html if you're willing, if you wanna do that, then. And the chatroom's reminded me, you can do this GitHub, that even a free account at GitHub will host a site like that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Actually my favorite would be look at CloudFlare. Cloudflare has, you know, paid tier, but CloudFlare has a free tier that's pretty amazing.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:41:18):\n\nYep.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:18):\n\nFor absolutely nothing. And it has DDoS protection, has a lot of the features of CloudFlare itself. But you're expected to be a little bit more sophisticated in how you do the site. Not necessarily hand coding it. I'm using a static generator, it's called Hugo. It's really great. You basically write your post and mark down, you run it through Hugo, Hugo knows your layout. You have a big long configuration file or files, themes and stuff. And then, then it makes static pages that load very fast cuz there's no database access once they're written. And that those static pages can be hosted on GitHub. In fact, the way I do it, I have a server over here that's just running Engine X and has the, the page there, but I also have mirror it on GitHub. I just do a GI push Oh, nice.\n\n(00:42:07):\n\nOn my, on my page over here. And then you can go to, I think it's leo laporte.github.io And that's the entire, that's the page. It's static. And because, and GitHub will let you do that for free because it's not doing any work. It's just hosting some html. So it, it kind of all depends on how deep you want to get into this, what your needs are. The nice thing about Squarespace, WordPress and Blog Spot is they're easy. Anybody can set up a site. I would, I should throw in sites like Shopify or Sponsor Big Commerce you know wicks sites which allow you to sell stuff. That's why I asked if you sell stuff, because they make it very, very easy. My son is not a web guru. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. But as a, I'm always impressed when I go to his site, I go, wow, that's a beautiful site. He says, yeah, Shopify. So and, and it's basically free cuz they take a commission on sales. Right. So it really depends on what you wanna do. This has become a very complicated thing. The most important thing to understand is this difference between dynamic and static. I think. Right. If you need dynamic, that's gonna be more expensive cuz they've got a database engine running in the background, but it's much more flexible.\n\nCaller 2 (00:43:14):\n\nGreat. Yeah, no, that's pretty much, that's pretty much all I need.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:19):\n\nI think card is a great solution\n\nMikah Sargent (00:43:21):\n\nActually. It's, it's super, yeah. Super simple\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:23):\n\nTo set up. It's both easy and super\n\nMikah Sargent (00:43:25):\n\nCost effective.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:26):\n\nCheap <laugh>. Somebody else said demo in our chat, in our chat room says format.com too, which I'm not familiar too. Yeah.\n\nCaller 2 (00:43:34):\n\nCom Yeah, it doesn't need to be complicated. It's pretty much just a landing page for Yeah. My different things. That's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:39):\n\nWhat part is, is, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's\n\nMikah Sargent (00:43:41):\n\nDesigned for that. It's mostly, for\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:42):\n\nMost people that's all their website is, is just, here's where my stuff is. You\n\nMikah Sargent (00:43:45):\n\nKnow, as far as that part where you're talking about transferring it. Yeah, that I, it, it may, may or may not be as simple as you know, linking the two up or pointing it to a site. You may have to do some of the heavy lifting on your own there. Unfortunately,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:00):\n\nAunt, you use Squarespace and aunt's saying he spends $400 a year, but you're using their commerce, you're selling prints and all that stuff through there. So that's worth it to you because, you know, you you, you make money off of it, I hope. And to write it off <laugh>, you can write it off. It's a tax deduction. Mine's\n\nMikah Sargent (00:44:17):\n\nAbout two 40 a\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:18):\n\nYear. Two 40. Wow. You know how much I pay for my site? Nothing <laugh>. But then I'm running it on this box over here. <Laugh>. And I guess if you include the cost of the studio Yeah. The electricity.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:44:29):\n\nIt's in there\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:30):\n\nSomewhere in the box. It maybe is cheaper to use. Squarespace. <laugh>. <Laugh>. Hey it's nice to talk to you. I, I kind of jumped on you and I apologize you didn't have your hand raised, but I just had to see this. Beautiful. So is that behind you? Is that, is that the great outdoors or is that like a courtyard or? Mm,\n\nCaller 2 (00:44:50):\n\nThis is a mural.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:53):\n\nOh. Oh, you fooled me. You see, you should have said, oh yeah, that's my backyard. So you're in the basement now. I get it.\n\nCaller 2 (00:45:00):\n\nI'm in the basement\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:01):\n\nNow. Yeah, I get it. There's no windows.\n\nCaller 2 (00:45:02):\n\nIt's there's a lot of snow out there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:05):\n\nYeah, <laugh>. I know. Oh gosh. Hey, it's great to talk to you. Thanks you so much, chef for calling. I appreciate it, Justin.\n\nCaller 2 (00:45:11):\n\nYeah, thanks so much. Take\n\nLeo Laporte (00:45:12):\n\nCare. Yeah, even though you didn't wanna be on, we made him be on <laugh>, our hacker friend. Justin do we have, when is Rod joining us so I can get an idea? 1230 one 30. 1230. 1230. So we got a half an hour to Rod. Should I go over and show this? I'd love to see this. Okay. I'm gaming Chromebook. Yeah. Who knew? Who knew? I knew. You knew. You knew about it. Padre brought it to us, but Ace Asia just sent it to us. I thought, well, let's try it out. All right. Now this my friends is a Chromebook, which is kind of amazing. Chromebooks. Traditionally we recommend them because they're inexpensive. This is not, it's more like 600 bucks. And they're very secure and very simple. Basically it's the Chrome browser in a, in a pc. But Acer has, has something else in mind.\n\n(00:46:05):\n\nThis is the five 16 ge. And normally on the Chromebook, the things that, in order to make them inexpensive, the things you give up, you know, are a quality track pad, a quality keyboard, and most importantly a quality display. Well, this is a heck of a display. 25 60 by 1600. It's 120 hertz. So that's one of the things gamers want is a high refresh rate. It's one of the things typically you don't find in a Chromebook. It also has a gaming keyboard. You can't see it very well in the studio with multi-colored lights and its clothes and it shifts. And you can kind of give away that, that, that it's a gamer laptop because the a w sd keys are highlighted in white. Those are the keys you use for movement typically in a game. Not for me. I'm a lefty. I always remap it to the arrow keys.\n\n(00:46:57):\n\nBut, so this is, for me, this is almost a little, a little right-Hander bias in, in my, in my opinion. You also get, they say very good speakers. They call 'em force canceling speakers. I would call them crap tinny speakers, but okay. You know, nomenclature, we can, we can disagree. It's interesting cuz we do have ethernet on this. In fact, there's a full-size e ethernet jack. Look at that. And it's 2.5 gigabits. So again, this is designed for somebody who wants to do not just hardcore gaming, but hardcore streaming gaming. Right. And that's the key on this. Even though this does have and you can get various processors in it. This does have an Intel I five processor. When you're gaming on this thing, you're not actually gaming on this thing. It's designed to use the cloud gaming services like Microsoft's Xbox or in, in this case, I'm gonna run GForce. Now, let me see. Is it not responding to my, my queries GForce Now is is kind of fun. Do you have this screen? Oh, you do. Look at that. You see it, but I don't because I am not mirroring. You're extended Now I'm gonna have to figure out how this thing works.\n\n(00:48:17):\n\nBattery life on it is amazing. Ethernet speed is amazing. The screen is amazing. I have to say it is very fast. I I am able to play games quite quickly. Here it is. Displays. Yay. Mirror built in display. Well, that wasn't so hard, Leo. Boy, you're not too bright, are you?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:48:40):\n\nI mean, this is a pretty feature packed Chromebook, right? Well,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:44):\n\nI mean, it is. If I if one of the things I can do on this is launch Buntu. I put <laugh>,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:48:51):\n\nOf course\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:51):\n\nI've got Eemax on it. I mean it's you know, you can, you can actually run Linux on Chromebooks these days. I Is\n\nMikah Sargent (00:48:58):\n\nIt a, like is it a, an official, is it a blessed Chromebook Leo with all this extra stuff? It always feels like it steps outside. Oh\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:05):\n\nNo, it's a real legit, you know, Google approved Chromebook. Let me plug in. This is actually kind of cool that I could do this full size ethernet. Now I am on a 10. What, what is their, what is our switch here? Just one. Can we get a faster switch for Leo <laugh>\n\nMikah Sargent (00:49:21):\n\nEditors?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:21):\n\nEditors have the editors have the 10 gigabit. We don't here. So, but you know what, it's fine for streaming games like GForce now. So let's launch the GForce. Now, what did I say I was gonna play Sons of the\n\nMikah Sargent (00:49:34):\n\nForest <laugh>. Yeah. Daughters of Liberty\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:37):\n\n<Laugh>. So this is gonna, this is loading on a, on a Nvidia R T X GPU in the cloud. You have to have the game on Steam for this particular game. So it'll let you connect with your steam account. It also lets you connect with your EA account, your good old games account. Should we play a little suns of the forest? Let's see, let's continue. So we don't just do it. Cut scene here. Of course,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:50:04):\n\nThe point of streaming gaming is most of the processing is happening on the other end. So can't, couldn't you just play this on a, a low Chromebook? You\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:11):\n\nCan. And that was kind of the point of streaming. So where you get an advantage here is if you're playing the high end version of a game like this, which supports RTX graphics. Now I can use the RTX graphics, especially I guess I don't have a game saved, so I'll start a new game. Let's play peaceful, shall we? <Laugh>? This is a very, in my opinion, very hard survival game. Because if you're playing a high end game, you want high screen refresh rate. Got it. That's one area where you excel the 2.5 gigahertz ethernet. Another area where you might want that. If you're playing streaming gaming, of course, more bandwidth, lower latency is a good thing. I love it that there's an ethernet on here and a full size H G M I on here. They really designed this for a unique, I think a unique audience, frankly. It's it's, you're right, it's not the typical Chromebook audience, but what if you could get a gaming PC capable of RTX performance for 600 bucks? Yeah. It's also a great productivity tool. I mentioned you can be running Linux, but you can also be running Android applications. So this is a cut scene, so it's not a, it's not a great demonstration, but what's, what's the, okay, let me see if I can skip this actually.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:51:26):\n\nMaybe sometimes a nice escape button. Let's just, oh yeah. It does seem like you're playing though.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:30):\n\nYeah, it feels like I'm looking out the window.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:51:33):\n\nWow. Look at that. The shine on those headphones on the chair.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:37):\n\nYeah, they're shiny. Is it's it's, it's somewhat pre-rendered I would guess. Cause I am, I'm able to look around a little bit. The plot of this is that you are stuck in a forest. Okay.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:51:50):\n\nOh, and you're the son of someone\n\nLeo Laporte (00:51:52):\n\nPresumably? No, the game is the son of someone. Oh, got it. Yeah. And <laugh>. And so we can look at our assignment. I love the name Virginia Puffin. I don't know who she is. But we, we've gotta find her. Of the puffins. Of the puffin play. Yes, she is. Of the buffs, Barbara and Edward Puffin. Ooh. Yes. They're wealthy and they've become lost. He's the CEO of Puff Comp.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:52:15):\n\nAnd you are the son Puffin who's looking\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:18):\n\nFor No, I'm a soldier. I don't\n\nMikah Sargent (00:52:19):\n\nUnderstand where the son\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:21):\n\nFisheye and Kelvin are going a searching for these guys. I guess we're gonna have to wait. And let's\n\nMikah Sargent (00:52:29):\n\nSee. So the goal is not to find the sun of the forest. I see.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:33):\n\nOkay. No, the, the game is the sun <laugh> fight demons. Oh. Obviously I've got problems.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:52:40):\n\nOh, okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:41):\n\nYeah. Oh. Uhoh, somebody shot us up. Oh, no, we're going down.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:52:48):\n\nI know who shot you. You do? Yeah. I was the son of the forest <laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:52):\n\nStop it. Just stop\n\nMikah Sargent (00:52:53):\n\nIt. I'm\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:54):\n\nSorry. There is a a lady in this game with three legs and three arms. What?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:52:59):\n\nOh, so it's kinda spooky. It's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:00):\n\nSpooky. It's creepy. Yeah. Oh, no. Yeah, he fell. Bye guys.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:53:04):\n\nAnd there go Your meals. Ready to eat.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:06):\n\nOh, I'm under, I'm under water. What am I gonna do?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:53:09):\n\nBreak the glass. Leo, break the glass.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:11):\n\nReally? Okay. Can I do it with, oh, oh, no, no. I can't help you, sir. Sorry. Can you go on the other side of the helicopter?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:53:19):\n\nHey, just try to\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:19):\n\nGo around. Oh, there he goes.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:53:21):\n\nOh. Oh. Now you, now you put your fist\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:23):\n\nDown. Yeah. Now I try to break the window. You know, let's do it with my boots. That's the best way to do it. Me, e e I'm hitting e\n\nMikah Sargent (00:53:33):\n\nSlam it. <Laugh>. E e\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:37):\n\nE. Unlike, oh, there goes the door. I\n\nMikah Sargent (00:53:39):\n\nWas fooled by that F four joke. Once at, at years\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:42):\n\nAnd years ago, somebody in our chat room was giving out a dev null Linux tip that would erase your home directory. Don't listen to commands issued in the chat room. Okay? Yes, please. I beg of you, whatever you're doing.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:53:55):\n\nAlright. Did you make it\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:56):\n\nSo, I don't know if you can hear the Aya made it. Hold on a second. It's loading. Oh, okay. You can hear the sound. Okay. Oh, it's coming through htm.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:54:03):\n\nI, yeah, I can hear the sound. Sounds great. Oh, well, that's rude.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:06):\n\nWait a minute. Hey, knock it off, buddy.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:54:08):\n\nHey, shiny jacket.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:09):\n\nOh, that's the guy who shot us, I'm guessing. Oh. Oh.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:54:15):\n\nKnocked out.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:17):\n\nSo the audio coming out of the speakers, even though it looks like a Mac, you know, the Mac Pro speakers, MacBook Pro speakers are so good, so Rich. And these look like those,\n\nMikah Sargent (00:54:28):\n\nBut they're not. No, they don't sound like they\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:30):\n\nDon't, but you know what? You're gonna wear headphones because you're a real gamer. Exactly. Who cares?\n\nMikah Sargent (00:54:35):\n\nAnd for the price, I mean, that's great that there're speakers that it can. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:54:39):\n\nNow we're, now we're playing. There's very little hesitation. You're able to run around. I'm sorry. I had a saved game, but obviously it wasn't saved properly. I'm supposed to look in all of these things and wander around, but this will give you an idea. It looks really good. Yeah. Yeah. It's using an RTX in the cloud. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, which is amazing. A Nvidia GPU in the cloud. Now you pay a lot for the monthly fee, but this, this Chromebook comes with a four month high end Nvidia GForce now subscription. So you can at least try it out and see if you, if you like it. I actually don't have the high end subscription at home. I'm fine without it. But this is 4K capable. And we're getting a four. This is a 4K screen high refresh rate. We're going up in the mountains. Really? I should have opened my inventory, taken out the the ax here in my emergency pack. Left mouse open. I guess I, oh, was that the right mouse? I guess I should have opened that sucker. Look what's in there. Oh, there's a, looks like a anyway, <laugh>. It's not gonna, it's not. I'm not gonna last long. Let's just put it that way. I didn't get the ax and the knife and all that stuff.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:55:58):\n\nThe shadows and the reflection are, look at that. Quite good.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:00):\n\nOkay. So for a gaming pc, this is good. Yeah. Impressed. If you have enough bandwidth and you're low enough latency, you certainly can play a high end game. This is a AAA title, brand new, very hot. They sold 2 million copies of this game last weekend. Very, very hot. Right now it's, it's, it's actually in beta. It's impressive. H DM I 2.1. Yes. So you go drive a nice 4K screen at a high refresh rate, wifi six E. So if you're not close to an ethernet port, you can at least get the high speed wifi on here. I think in, in general, this is a really nice system. It is. You know, I'll let you handle this a little bit. It feels a little cheesy. It's a plastic body. It looks aluminum. It's not oh, that's not a problem. This is brushed aluminum here, but, well, maybe it's plastic.\n\n(00:56:50):\n\nIt's plastic. Ah, it's plastic. It also, like many Chromebooks, it feels a little light. I wouldn't say the track pad is as good as, I mean, look, I'm comparing it to a MacBook, so I probably shouldn't do that. It's not as good as a MacBook, but it's very good for a Chromebook keyboard has a little bounce. It's a little bit not ideal, but not terrible. This is certainly as good a Chromebook as you're gonna get, even for the thousand dollars models of Chromebooks. I would say this is comparable. Lots of speed with an I five. Now, of course, the 95 is gonna cost you more. You can get this up to of 1200 bucks easily. This is the Acer Chromebook five 16 ge. Remind me, does it have fans? Oh, it has fans. Many fans. Yeah. Yeah. It has to have fans because it's a Intel processor. <Laugh>,\n\n(00:57:41):\n\nFair enough. <Laugh> the hinge is good. It's a nice looking device. If you, if you, if it's gaming that's on your mind. If that's what you wanna do, you can, it's a very nice gaming machine. But of course, it also does everything else a Chromebook does, including go to Starbucks. So, I don't, I don't know why, but some reason Google's decided, or maybe it's maybe, maybe this is an Acer thing. It's decided to put a Starbucks that is odd logo in my in my menu. I do have a Fast Mail logo probably cuz I logged in. It's a, you know, this is decent. And you, you have the Play Store, so you can, you can absolutely load Android stuff on here. In fact the GForce now is an app. It's, so one of the things that's changed a lot with, with Chromebooks is it runs apps.\n\n(00:58:27):\n\nThis is an app. This is, this is not running in Chrome. And you see there's some other apps we can install, including Discord, peacock, hbo, O Max. I suspect an app running on a Chromebook is still pretty much not a standalone app. The Android apps certainly are, the Linux apps certainly are. But I would say, you know, if you're running an app, it's probably a Chrome app, right? Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, remember those Chrome apps? Still pretty nice. And there's some, there's some fun things you could do. Lots of great, lots of great games in GForce now, or Xbox Cloud, or ea I'm gonna say thumbs up. If you want a Chromebook and you do wanna do some gaming, you're paying the price for a little gaming machine. But this is, this is pretty darn impressive. And so as Sons of the Forest, I'm gonna die any minute. Now. I know <laugh>, something\n\nMikah Sargent (00:59:20):\n\nFalls out of the tree and just takes it off.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:25):\n\nSo we thank Acer for sending us this. So I, cuz I was interested in, well, how good can a Chromebook be? And I'm, you know, I'm pretty impressed. But we're gonna send it back tomorrow, so thank you Acer for that. Shall we go on with more calls? Do we have a video call? This would be a good time to do that so I can walk over while we're listening to the video call. Yeah.\n\nMikah Sargent (00:59:46):\n\nA video call per hand per chance. Let's do it from the email.\n\nCaller 3 (00:59:51):\n\nHi, my name is Jeremy and I'm recording this in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. I'm switching over from Last Pass to Bit Warden and I have no problem exporting my vault from last pass into a CSV file to import it in. Bit Warden. But I also have password saved on Key Chain on my iPad and my iPhone. But Apple Support tells me without a Mac computer that I don't have, I only have a Windows computer that I can't ah, export all of my key path passwords to a CSV file all in one go. I have to airdrop them one at a time. And that's not good for me because I have a lot of passwords saved in key chain. I'm wondering if you can suggest an alternate method other than airdropping them one at a time. Thank you.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:10):\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:01:11):\n\nYeah, it's a very good question. I am fairly certain that, and I'm looking yeah, iCloud for Windows. So,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:18):\n\nAh,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:01:20):\n\nIcloud for Windows 12.5 and maybe even be further along now than that has the keychain access. And so you will be able to export using iCloud for Windows. So just look up iCloud for Windows and we'll see what version it is at this point. It\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:40):\n\nDoes have, it looks like the Keychain app does have an export as well. I wonder\n\nMikah Sargent (01:01:47):\n\nThough, the Keychain app itself does, but only on the Mac. You cannot do it with iPad\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:51):\n\nOr with iPhone ic. Yeah. Only on the Mac. And he's got an iPad, so Yeah. So that's why you want to install iCloud for Windows, which actually is pretty good these days. Yeah, he does a lot of stuff. More than I really thought. It, it would given Apple's <laugh> feelings about Windows machines. Right. They're really supporting 'em quite well. Good.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:02:11):\n\nSo we will include a link to that application. It's available in the win in the Microsoft store. And you are able to use it to manage those iCloud passwords and get them moved over to your system.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:24):\n\nWe should just for comparison, size comparison, put that next to your head.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:02:30):\n\n<Laugh>,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:31):\n\nJust so you know\n\nMikah Sargent (01:02:31):\n\nHow to do Mic A Mikah for scale.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:33):\n\nIt's a big, it's a 15 inch big laptop.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:02:35):\n\nYeah. When you, whenever you pulled it out and said this was a Chromebook, I thought, wait, that\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:38):\n\nYeah. That's quite, yeah. Quite large. Yeah. It is a, the game. GE stands for Gaming Edition. Acer makes other, I think Acer makes the best, frankly Chromebooks. They make other ones. Let me just check. I didn't, I didn't, I don't know exactly what the price is for this as equipped, cuz this is kind of, you know, they've put everything everything fancy into it. It goes all the way up to an I seven, which is kind of amazing. I wouldn't put an I seven in it cuz you're not gonna be doing anything com 16 inch. You're not gonna be doing anything. More, more needing more horsepower than what I was doing. No, it's only eight gigs of ram. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, the internal graphics are Iris xe, but you're not relying on those again when you're streaming. It does have an unusually large hard drive 256 gigs for Chromebook. That's pretty good.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:03:30):\n\nYeah, cuz the whole li the whole conceit of Chromebook is typically that it's all stored in the cloud, right?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:34):\n\nI guess the model I have is 650 bucks. I thought it might be more. All right. So there you go. It it, it looks like you can't really add anything more to it.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:03:46):\n\nAnd it's a nice fingerprint collector there on the top. <Laugh>\n\nLeo Laporte (01:03:50):\n\nHey so's my <crosstalk> here. And that's why mine's in a in a plastic case, somebody says it's like I have Eastern European Grandma syndrome, <laugh>. You know how they wrapped their, you put\n\nMikah Sargent (01:04:02):\n\nEverything in plastic?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:04:03):\n\nYeah. Yeah. They wrapped their sofas in plastic.

Hello Maxfield.\n\nCaller 4 (01:08:26):\n\nHello?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:27):\n\nHello. Where are you calling from?\n\nCaller 4 (01:08:29):\n\nEast Bay. Not far at all.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:31):\n\nOh, look, we can see him. Yay. Welcome you\n\nMikah Sargent (01:08:35):\n\nTo\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:35):\n\nThe show, east Bay. What can we do for you? Indeed?\n\nCaller 4 (01:08:39):\n\nWell, I I was tasked not long ago with taking family fi videos and photos and digitizing and making the modern, you know, some semblance of security beyond just having pieces of paper. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And I thought, gee, YouTube is a great place to put video for free. Yes. and as it turns out this foolish decision <laugh> just kicked me in the butt. Oh no.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:08):\n\nOh, no.\n\nCaller 4 (01:09:09):\n\n<Laugh>. Because it turns out some of these videos unbeknownst to me, feature miniature me and my siblings knew Naked. You know, that sort\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:17):\n\nOf stuff, uhoh and and we know Google is fussy about that\n\nCaller 4 (01:09:23):\n\nApparently. And so the question and so as a result, I'm, I'm locked out of my YouTube\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:30):\n\nOh.\n\nCaller 4 (01:09:32):\n\nThe affiliated accounts for which were brand accounts that I'm affiliated. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:37):\n\nYou're, oh.\n\nCaller 4 (01:09:39):\n\nAnd all\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:40):\n\nYou can can do is appeal this.\n\n(01:09:43):\n\nYeah. There was a we reported on it some months ago, a New York Times article about a guy who had a kid who had a rash. His doctor said, send me a picture of the rash. He did. But as you know, often with smartphones Google Photos backup gets it. And it did. And the picture was a nude child with a rash. And he lost his Google account. And the story is a sad story. I don't, I don't know if he ever got it back completely, but all you can do is appeal <laugh> and I and, and I'm so sorry this happened to you Maxville. That's terrible. Did you know that the videos had child nudity in it?\n\nCaller 4 (01:10:29):\n\nNot directly. No.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:10:30):\n\nYeah. Right. And so just a bunch of stuff thinking about it either, you know. Yeah. Whenever you're,\n\nCaller 4 (01:10:33):\n\nNo, and that's, that's obviously not the intention here.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:10:38):\n\nSo what I'm seeing is when it, so it takes 24 hours before kind of, they, they give you a 24 hour cool down. And then it's saying when you try to log back into your Google account, you should see an option that says start appeal. Have you seen that option yet?\n\nCaller 4 (01:10:55):\n\nI have. And so far that the, the appeal process has given me the runaround. Okay. whether or not, you know, that's legitimate or not, I don't know to what extent there's a human there.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:09):\n\nDo you want to hear the story of the dad and what happened to him?\n\nCaller 4 (01:11:12):\n\n<Laugh>? I'm curious. Yeah. What, what's the\n\nLeo Laporte (01:11:14):\n\nShow? Let me this is from the New York Times, August 25th, 2022. It could actually be worse cuz not only did he lose the account, but Google referred it to the authorities. The sad thing is the police on review said, no problem, you're cleared. But for some reason Google didn't acknowledge that. And, you know, you understand they're very sensitive about Csam. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I mean, that's, everybody's very nervous about that. Let's see, a severe violation. Mark who's in his forties, came to rely heavily on Google, synced appointments on calendar, probably not even as much as you did. You, you have business with the brand accounts. Yeah. That's bad news. His account had been disabled cuz of harmful content that was, quote, a severe violation of Google's policies and might be illegal. Did you get that warning?\n\nCaller 4 (01:12:13):\n\nYeah. I, I got a legal, I got the, the child pornography\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:18):\n\nWarning. Now prepare yourself because Google may then refer you to the police. Mark's Google's review team flagged a video and, and the San Francisco Police Department was, set the information and started to investigate him. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Now, the good news is the police are human. Yes. They're, they're not a python human beings. Exactly. So the police immediately said, oh, no, no. Yeah, of course. This is a picture you sent to the doctor and it's not child porno. But the problem is Google is using, you know, content ID and YouTube, which not, not notice notices, copyright stuff. They use something called photo D n a, which was created by Facebook originally. And it does the same thing for nudity. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So photo to the A flags it, Google will then, I'm sorry, not Facebook. Microsoft came up with this Facebook uses it it flags it and then it refers it to a human. The human apparently decided this was bad. The time says a human content moderator for Google would've reviewed the photo after they were flagged by the artificial intelligence to confirm they met the federal definition of Csam child sexual abuse material. When Google makes such a discovery, locks the account, searches for other exploitative material, and as required by federal law, makes a report to the cyber tip line at ncmec, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. How, how long ago did this happen to you, Maxville?\n\nCaller 4 (01:13:49):\n\nThis? so there was a, some, some time in between the fact that I uploaded, I uploaded about a year ago and I started getting emails saying, your, your account's been taken down only about a month ago. Okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:14:02):\n\nSo, but a month is enough time that if Nick Mick had decided to refer it to the authorities, you probably would know by now. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I would think. But that's the, frankly, the larger at this point you know, I think NC Mick is probably smarter and said, oh yeah, that's just videos of him as a kid. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> big deal. Right. this is the problem. This is why Apple dropped at Csam scanning because of this false positive. So let's see. This was back in 2021. Mark got a letter from the S F P D saying you've been investigated as well as copies of the search warrant served on Google. And his I S P and investigator looked at his internet searches, his location history, his messages, and he document you, you know, you get in this system, it's a meat grinder.\n\n(01:14:52):\n\nYeah. the search related to child exploitation videos had taken place in February within a week of the photos. So this is why I think you might be okay. The investigator Mark talked to the investigator, said the case is closed. I, the, the investigator said, I determined the incident did not meet the elements of a crime, no crime had occurred. That's what would almost certainly happen for you Maxfield, especially since they're older videos and, you know but that did not fix it with Google. Yep. Mark appealed his case to Google, again, providing the police report, but to no avail. After getting a notice two months ago, as his account was being permanently deleted, he talked to a lawyer about suing Google how much it might cost. Mark says, probably not worth the $7,000. I would to told it would cost to do that. So, I mean, this has a, this is a sad story. This does not have a happy ending. I hope yours I\n\nMikah Sargent (01:15:47):\n\nThink the biggest, I'm looking at Google's own support documentation and one of the situations where, because typically if your account is disabled or locked you are still able to go in and download your data from the site. Oh. However, if it involves child sexual abuse material, you are not able to go in and download your data. Have\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:09):\n\nYou gone to the Google takeout to see if you can get your date out of it?\n\nCaller 4 (01:16:12):\n\nThat is my experience as well. Okay. Now, I have not been able to download.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:16:17):\n\nMy biggest suggestion for you is if, if you're, I don't know how any of this works, you know, behind the scenes having obviously not gone through the process, but if you are able to restart the appeal or try to, to figure out, cuz you said they're giving you the runaround on the appeal without clarity on what that means Exactly. Just try to follow through as much as possible.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:41):\n\nAssistance pays. Yeah, exactly. We've had that experience with Facebook and Google and, and other ones. You know, there, it's a big company with billions of users and it's very hard to kind of get through the process.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:16:53):\n\nAnd you can't be the only one to have done this. This is, that's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:56):\n\nVery\n\nMikah Sargent (01:16:56):\n\nCommon. Yeah. To, to upload old photos and videos from your childhood. This poor\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:59):\n\nGuy, mark, even though he was exonerated by the S F P D, the, this is the funny thing. The S F P D has all of his account, they downloaded everything and they saved, but he can't get it from them. He can't get Google to, to respond. But a police spokesman did say the department's eager to help him. So maybe your best bet is getting investigated and exonerated and they would have a copy of it. Oh my God. That's not a good solution at all. I am so sorry this happened to you, max. Yeah. This is awful. I don't, there's no, you know, we don't have a magic wand. We could wave and I don't know any, I mean, we know people at Google, but they, my experience, you know, people often write to me say, can you intercede with me with Facebook or Google or, and every, you know, I try, but they, they, they, they all say, oh, that's not my department. I can't help\n\nMikah Sargent (01:17:48):\n\nYou. Yeah, exactly. People you do know there, there don't do that.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:51):\n\nIt's a big, that's a big company. A hundred thousand employees. Mark, are you, I you a trumpeter. I see the brass instruments behind you there,\n\nCaller 4 (01:18:00):\n\nThere are some, some horns in the background. That is indeed. And then Sammy Davis Jr. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:05):\n\nNice. You\n\nMikah Sargent (01:18:05):\n\nBet. I would say too, your story is one that I wouldn't, I would imagine that some journalists might be interested in. So you may reach out to the virtue. I\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:16):\n\nWould say that too. But the New York Times, that's\n\nMikah Sargent (01:18:18):\n\nTrue. The New York Times\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:18):\n\nCouldn't get it expose.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:18:20):\n\nThat's true. The New York Times couldn't get 'em to do it\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:21):\n\nAnd nothing. And I don't know if you get, if your story's published in the New York Times and Google still doesn't respond, I think that's proof positive. They don't care. Yeah. I'm so sorry. This I'm, oh, this is a nightmare. What kind of, are you, what kind of music do you play?\n\nCaller 4 (01:18:39):\n\nHow along the same, so 1930s and forties is really\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:42):\n\nSammy Davis style.\n\nCaller 4 (01:18:44):\n\nOh yeah. Oh yeah. Big band.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:46):\n\nCan you play the Candy's? Can you play something for us,\n\nCaller 4 (01:18:49):\n\n<Laugh>? Oh, they're not, these aren't functional at the moment. Oh. Hence why they're on, on display rather than\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:56):\n\nIn use. Do you play in a band?\n\nCaller 4 (01:18:59):\n\nI fiddle around, so to speak. Nice. Yeah. Nice. I enjoy it.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:04):\n\nNice. Maxville, I'm, I'm pleased to have met you and I'm sorry that Yeah, this has happened to you. I'm glad you called though, cuz people need to hear this.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:11):\n\nYes. Do not use YouTube as your, your video storage service. But you know, this kinda\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:18):\n\nStuff, what I would, for instance, I did, I uploaded all my family videos to Google Photos. Uhhuh <affirmative>, not YouTube. Same problem, right? Yeah. Mark, this guy in the New York Times story, it was Google Photos, they scan all that stuff. If you're putting in the cloud with almost anybody, it's almost certainly getting scanned and there's a good reason they're liable.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:38):\n\nYes. That's why it's the liability.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:39):\n\nThere's no section two 30 protecting them against Csam. So they're liable for anything that they store on their cloud. So they scan it all Apple does too. They scan the iCloud stuff. So golly,\n\nMikah Sargent (01:19:53):\n\nWow. That's this tough\n\nCaller 4 (01:19:55):\n\n<Laugh> that that answers the question. Is there an alternative? No cloud\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:59):\n\nSolution? I would say no. Yeah. go ahead. Let me think about that. That's\n\nMikah Sargent (01:20:04):\n\nInteresting question. Cause I'm thinking even Dropbox would\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:06):\n\nStill Oh, they scan Yeah.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:20:07):\n\nScans.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:08):\n\nEverybody has this relationship with Nick, Mick because, and they've got this and almost everybody uses Photo dna. It's the same software. Microsoft developed it 20 years ago almost. And everybody uses it. So flash\n\nMikah Sargent (01:20:21):\n\nDrives <laugh>. I gotta go back to the, gosh,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:23):\n\nLet me think. You know, I should contact Chris McCaskill over at Smug Mug and see Smug Mug's a great place. I store all my photos there. There may be some smaller providers that don't, you know, that don't scan. Smug mug hosts a lot of photographers, a lot of artists. They host stills mostly, but they also do video. That's where I put my family photos to share with family. But I, again, I can't promise, I I will over the week, I will send an email to mc the McCaskill's and see if, if they do, and if they say, cuz they may not want to admit it if they\n\nMikah Sargent (01:21:03):\n\nDon't. Yeah. And this is a good point that people are saying in the chat. If you're hosting your own on a network, attach chronology that could be the place to, to keep it\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:12):\n\nTechnology.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:21:13):\n\nYeah. But I, I don't know. It, I, I would just, for me if I was specifically tasked with doing this, I would give everybody a cd, a flash drive or a cd Yeah. Or dvd, one of, depending on the family member and how tech savvy they were, they would get one of those\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:28):\n\nDevices. This is, this is a new world. This is I don't blame you for not being prepared for\n\nMikah Sargent (01:21:32):\n\nThis one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's be clear. You, that was not a foolish thing that you did. Yeah. In, in, you know, making that happen that you had no expectation because it was a completely innocent thing that you did. So I hope that you're not beating yourself up too much about that part of it and in Yeah. But coming on the show screwed. Right. And coming on the show and talking about it though. Thank you. Because you have helped us warn all of the people who listen to the show,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:54):\n\nSome minor do the\n\nMikah Sargent (01:21:55):\n\nSame\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:55):\n\nConsolation, <laugh>. So sorry dude, max. Well thank you\n\nMikah Sargent (01:21:59):\n\nNonetheless.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:59):\n\nThank you. And when we open the studio, I hope you'll come by and visit since you're so, so near indie. All right. Take care, sir. Thank you. Wow. That's just\n\nMikah Sargent (01:22:10):\n\nSad. That is sad.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:12):\n\nAnd I understand.\n\nMikah Sargent (01:22:13):\n\nI get it from both. Like yeah, I understand why these companies are doing this and protecting themselves and you would rather have one that, that false positives a little bit more than misses. So I, I get why it, you know, it happened the way that it did, but they're re the appeal process should be a lot better than it is.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:34):\n\nAnd I really don't, you know thank you Raymond thought sent me a smug mug blog post. They store their stuff on Amazon s3. So even if smug mug didn't scan, I bet Amazon does. This is just like content ID on YouTube. It's just an automated process that's looking for, I you know what? We don't even know cuz it's not, it's not open. What is it looking for? They don't wanna tell anybody cuz they don't want bad guys to know\n\nMikah Sargent (01:23:03):\n\nExactly\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:04):\n\nWhat not to do and that kind of thing. So I don't think Mike Bees asking about the OneDrive personal vault, which is an encrypted vault within your OneDrive. Yeah. I mean for sure if you encrypted it bef before you uploaded it, nobody can see into it. Right. But then you would have to give the password to everybody else. Yep. This is the problem. This system, I\n\nMikah Sargent (01:23:26):\n\nJust don't think this Yeah. This is not where you're going to share videos of your family.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:31):\n\nBut I just have to point out, this system doesn't stop csam either. Right. Because if you're spreading this, you know enough to re-encrypt, you know how to ha avoid this. I\n\nMikah Sargent (01:23:43):\n\nBut they don't wanna make it easier.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:45):\n\nNo, I guess not. I guess not. And they're liable. Yep. And that's really, that's\n\nMikah Sargent (01:23:50):\n\nYeah. Yeah. They don't, they don't care about the rest of it. They just don't wanna be liable.\n\nLeo Laporte / Rod Pyle (01:23:53):\n\nIs Mr. Pile in the house? In the house? Yes, he is. Oh, <laugh>, we gotta play. We can't play your song. So in your mind, everybody, if you would help us audience at home, just hum in your mind. Elton John's rocket man. Now <laugh>, because it's <laugh> in your mind. I'm here, not out loud, it's time for Rod Pile, our spaceman rod, of course longtime contributor on the tech guy. Actually not that long. You were our newest contributor editor-in-chief of Ad Astra, the official publication of the National Space society@spacedots.org. And the host of our wonderful show, which I'm loving more and more all the time this week in space. In fact, I don't think it's a secret rod, but we're gonna be able to see your smiling face on the show pretty soon. I'm sorry, <laugh>. Oh no, no. Course there will be, there will be no nudity on my show.\n\n(01:24:57):\n\nOh, watch it. No, because we're scanning it order otherwise Yeah, we're, we're scanning it. And if it was a, a picture of me as a child, it would be a daguerre type and you wouldn't be able to see it. Anyway. <laugh>, there you go. The, this week in space shows is at TWI tv slash twists. Rod Pyle te Malik from space.com host the show. And we thought, you know, we've been trying to get all, and I think we've succeeded almost all of our s contributors Yeah. From the old show on with us from time to time. And once again, I was last <laugh>. Nope, I'm just kidding. Johnny. Just, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny Jet is last. Yep. There's one in one. Really? I got it before Johnny. Oh, <laugh>. I'm preening now. <Laugh>. Thank you. So Rod, what's up in space? I saw, I saw one funny thing I'm gonna ask you about Yeah.\n\n(01:25:46):\n\nBecause we're all piling on Elon these days. He's got this Starship right, that he, that yeah. Spacex wants to launch, but this well, a bunch of them. Yeah. Yeah. But there's been so many delays and stuff. Mushrooms were growing in the, in the cowling of the fuel is right. Yeah. Is that common? But it's humid. I, you know, it's humid down there. I mean, it's Florida. So he had mushroom Well no, this is in Boca Chica. Oh, it's Boca Chica. Okay. But it's, you know, similar latitude, similar temperature environment and humidity and stuff, but at least it's just mushrooms. You can go scrape those out with your hand, right? Mm-Hmm. On the other hand, when we were trying to get Starliner, Boeing's delivered to the iss s space capsule off last year. Instead they had rusted valves from that environment.\n\n(01:26:34):\n\nOh. Now you'd think, you'd think that years, years, decades of working on spacecraft down at the Cape would tell you, okay, don't use, you know, cold iron or pot metal <laugh> oxidized. I'm exaggerating. I grant you, you'd think it's all aluminum or titanium or something. Right? Well, or or at least something oxidation proof. Yeah. Right. You know, because those valves gotta, gotta twist round for the thing to take spray it with the rust, the rustoleum, rustoleum rustoleum. Yeah. So, or you know, smear it with, with Crisco or something. Anyway. Yeah. There's gotta be a way. That's what I do. But, but they're, they're planning to launch next on next too much. So, so we got what <laugh>, wait a minute. What, sorry, go ahead. Sorry. It's a Crisco joke. Okay. Yeah. So, so yeah, so, so that's good. They're, they're getting going. Starship you know, there's been a lot of delays.\n\n(01:27:26):\n\nPart of it is just that it's really complicated. Part of it, maybe I suppose we could, prognosticate might have something to do with Twitter. Although, you know, Gwen Shotwell is the president of SpaceX and she really runs the show there. Yeah. So Elon does, his thing comes and goes. He's got, you know, how many bajillion companies to deal with now <laugh>. So, so Gwen keeps running. So they really are moving fast. Part of the delay was the FAA hanging them up in terms of permitting and licensing to let them go. So they had a bunch of hurdles they had to clear, it took many months. And then finally they said, okay, you can launch, but you gotta do these 71 things before you do so. So it, but I mean, it's stuff like road closures and environmental interactions and, you know, you gotta do it only on these certain days, not on holiday weekends and all that, because there's a few people living down there and my sympathy to them.\n\n(01:28:20):\n\nBut, you know, being a space guy, I'm kinda like, yeah, I feel bad for you, but I wanna see the rock and go. So we're, we're expecting this quarter for that February 20. So they're off mushrooms. They say they're gonna launch the next crew dragon, right? The crew start, yeah. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. So that's crew six. That's their sixth flight up the is ss. And at a very good time, because as you'll recall, we had the so's ms 22 capsule up there, which got another leak hit by a meteor and vetted out all its coolant. And then the progress, which is the cargo version, the uncured cargo version that delivers stuff went up just a short while ago and it sprung a kind of leak. Mm-Hmm. And they said <affirmative> another meteor strike, which reminded me of that moment at red October when, what's his name, looks at the, at Alec Baldwin or at the, at the Russian ambassador and says, Dimitri, you've lost another Russian submarine <laugh>, you've got another meteorite on your another up.\n\n(01:29:20):\n\nHow are the meteors missing the space station? But they're hitting that little tiny capsule. So I don't know. We'll see. You know, they gotta get it back. So on the brake is the brake side. They make it with tin foil. So there's no rust <laugh>. True. Right. Well there you go. You cruel, harsh man. <Laugh>. So and then they, they the Russians launched the MS 23 soyus, which does take a crewe, but they launched it empty. So now they have a lifeboat up there and they can bring back damage one without people in it. So there's no risk. And at least get a look at it and maybe, possibly tell us what they found was wrong. Thank goodness. So yeah, so now we, we have, as of today, we have enough spacecraft up there to bring everybody home if something goes wrong, which is very good.\n\n(01:30:02):\n\nAnd then the but, but it's just gonna be on standby. The two cosmonauts, the American astronauts that we're gonna come back on, the one that sprung a leak are gonna end up staying a year instead of six months. So it, it kind of screws up the rotations, but at least they can get back onto 'em. Schedule. I know you've talked to astronauts a lot is that when they hear that news, it seems like the guys, you know, you were gonna stay six months, did you pack some extra underwear? Cause it's gonna be a year. <Laugh> is, is, are they ex glad to hear it or sad to hear it because there's also some physiological side effects? Yeah, I think most of them welcome it because the, the adventure if you will, and the ability to continue contributing. Cause I mean these guys are the truest or true believers, right?\n\n(01:30:45):\n\nYeah. Outweighs the risks. But as you say, especially for men, there's some issues for women. There are different issues. You know, the radiation can affect what your what, what happens to you? Well, I'll get there. Okay. Radiation could affect reproductive system and so forth, but the radiation isn't very high. The altar of the iss S cuz magnetosphere blocks a lot of it for men. So we've got this thing with atrac cranial pressure that we know, right? Yeah. The fluids redistribute. You feel like you got a head cold all the time. I had can't last, can't taste anything. I had such a headache. Yeah. And so that's why they, they ate so much sriracha and, and chili peppers up there try to didn't taste something. Are you choking? No <laugh> because sriracha is like in huge demand because otherwise they can't taste much God. Cause their heads all stopped up.\n\n(01:31:32):\n\nBut because of that pressure, we think for some reason the eyes begin to defocus and the vision starts to go. So you can correct it with glasses, but it does distort the eyeball for some reason. It happens to men and almost never to women. Hmm. Huh So once again, Leo, you can tell Lisa that she is in fact superior. Yes. Well, she knows that. I don't have to tell her. We bow to her genetics, which are obviously better than your in mine. But anyway, woman eyeballs is not a good thing. You don't want that. I don't. No. And you know what's weird is, so this this intercranial pressure thing theory was around for a long time, and this is still in consideration, but for somebody like Scott Kelly who came back, I don't know what, two years, years ago, was a long time ago.\n\n(01:32:13):\n\nYeah. Yeah. His eyes haven't returned to normal. Oh, oh wow. Since he's back on the ground. Yikes. Now, you know, I wear glasses. I think you wear glasses. So it's like, so what? You know, you wear glasses, it's worth it for that kind of adventure. But yeah, so, so the additional time can have some complications and who knows what's going on on the ground for those guys, you know, hopefully none of them have spouses having children or anything. But, you know, I just hope picture car to take your chances, bring extra socks, you might be there, little extra socks a little bit longer. There's no laundry. Is there laundry up there? They pack the dirty stuff. So, so they've got enough changes as I understand it that they don't have Yeah, but you can't pack for it's hard to six months and then spend a year and not well, but there's deliveries of stuff constantly.\n\n(01:33:00):\n\nOh, oh yeah.
