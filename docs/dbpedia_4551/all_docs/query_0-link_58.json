        "text": "First off OpenSim coined the term Metaverse. Just to get that out of the way.\n\nThe reason behind that is SecondLife had a few open source initiatives and a few independent developers went on to recreate its protocol, client browser, and servers under OpenGrid. But there was also OSGrid and many others doing the peak that the term HyperGrid no longer fit for being able to not only cross connect to authentication servers, state backends, and inventory sharing protocols. This in turn lead to a flurry of non second life controlled marketplaces opening and the term Metaverse was born to describe this ecosystem and in a way a 'flash point in internet culture/engagement'.\n\nFacebook and Oculus is just the most recent and financially stable iteration of this. Yes SecondLife's LindenLabs was trying to create what we have now with thier own VR hardware.\n\nHow do I know this stuff? I was there on the developer conferences with Linden Labs held in SecondLife and even was working on products in their programming language when not DJing in one of the various LGBT clubs.\n\nNow how does any of this compare to the current iteration of the \"metaverse\"? Zero.. well in a way. Here's a break down. The SL Viewer which is what one uses to connect to OpenSim and the others is written from scratch and yes was originally developed using the same libraries that built Tony Hawk Skating on the PS2 and modeled on the older VRML browser (yes that stupid one we all saw in the original Jurassic Park).\n\nUnreal and Unity engines has really pushed graphics since then. So when one connects to the OpenSim its not OpenSim sending your the graphics its the community built of free digital assets and a rather old graphic engine. This can easily be solved by a) rebuilding the SL Viewer to use Unity, WebGL, and WebXR.\n\nNow how does OpenSim work? Its a xmlrpc state machine server with each grid (VR real estate) stored in mysql and a custom broker pubsub server. How does that compare to other modern systems; we now use json instead of xml and some of use use web3js for the pubsub broker. Digital assets (models, audio, video, images, etc) are in both cases transmitted via http. Modern now has IPFS a global distributed merkle tree / bittorrent CDN [ the one thing I told LindenLabs SL needed to work at scale].\n\nSo all in all; no OpenSim is not more complex than what we have now, infact its actually a *LOT* less complex but that's also its failing too. But! the underlying hypergrid / metaverse protocols behind SecondLife, OSGrid, and OpenSim can be leveraged with smart contracts, ipfs, webxr, and modern graphic systems to fix the issues that sprang up before.\n\nSure we'll going to get a lot of stuff around NFT, DeFi, and all that jazz but really we had the metaverse already for ages that the techy gen x crowd groked now its the millennials turn at it with newer tech.\n\nGuess in my long winded way I'm seeing your point about early OpenGrid being \"experiments\" but really its not. GopherVR and VRML was the experiment. SecondLife was the future that was aborted too soon and now with the decentral web coming back into focus we're getting the reboot.\n\nAs for resources.. the best place is to look at https://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/FLOSS_Weekly_72 other than that check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWOi3sC0MUY and https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-sdks/how-to-integrate-ipfs-with-ethereum\n\nAnd yes the Quest is a WebXr browser that supports wasm, web3.js (etherium, ipfs), and oauth for identity.\n\nFinally, for those that read this. Thank you. Sorry it was so long and a little over the place."
