        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nFor the North Dakota politician (1876-1953), see Patrick Daniel Norton.\n\nPatrick Norton (born June 26, 1970, Urbana, Illinois) is most commonly known as the former co-host and managing editor of The Screen Savers, an interactive television program on TechTV geared toward the technology enthusiast. He is currently a managing editor at Revision3 where he hosts Systm and Tekzilla.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 Career\n\n3 Personal life\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\n[edit] Early life\n\nNorton grew up in the Midwest, but considers the Jersey Shore his home. He graduated from Pace University in New York City with a major in English literature.\n\n[edit] Career\n\nAfter graduating from college, Norton tested products and wrote for PC Magazine, Computer Shopper, and InfoWorld, and managed the hardware reviews section of Windows Sources magazine.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, ZDTV(later TechTV) named Norton as the co-host (alongside Leo Laporte) and managing editor of The Screen Savers, a television show centered around computers, new technologies, and their adaptations in the world. Norton remained in this capacity until the spring of 2004.\n\nOn March 25, 2004, Comcast's G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV. Around May 6, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles, California if they agreed to relocate there.[1] Norton chose to stay in San Francisco instead of moving to Los Angeles, and left the company.\n\nNorton co-hosted an Internet videocast with Robert Heron called DL.TV which covers a wide range of technology related topics and is streamed live every Thursday (it was streamed live twice weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays until episode 189). Norton has created a big fan base that is still delighted with his work as a technology guru. He announced on August 2, 2007 that he will no longer be the host of DL.TV in favor of a new job and he has a kid coming in a few months.[2] His last appearance as the host of DL.TV was episode 188.\n\nNorton also co-hosted a weekly podcast with Jim Louderback, the current CEO for Revision 3, called What's New Now. This podcast is no longer being produced, the final episode having been produced May 15, 2007.\n\nNorton wrote for ExtremeiPod before it was taken down in the wake of pressure from Apple over the use of the word \"iPod\". He also ran the hardware reviews section of Windows Sources magazine. Norton cut his technical teeth on Osborne and Kaypro CP/M systems in the early 1980s.\n\nNorton also appears on the weekly podcast This Week in Tech (a.k.a. TWiT) along with several other former members of TechTV, including Leo Laporte, Kevin Rose, John C. Dvorak, and his former DL.TV co-host Robert Heron.\n\nNorton is currently a managing editor at Revision3 where he is hosting Systm and Tekzilla. Norton first confirmed his employment with Revision 3 on TWiT episode 110 at 58:52 (The popular Netcast hosted by friend Leo Laporte).[3]\n\n[edit] Personal life\n\nNorton currently lives in San Francisco, California with his wife and his son.[4]. Norton and his wife had their first child in October of 2007. He credits the baby in episodes of systm, TWiT, and his newest show Tekzilla. Norton mentioned on TWiT episode 121 that he and his wife wish to keep details about their child from the public eye. His wife is a librarian. He also enjoys racing sailboats, off-road racing (he is typically absent during the week of the Baja 1000) and snowboarding, and spends as much free time as possible at his oceanfront home with a surfboard or kayak. While he no longer plays bass guitar in a punk rock band, he does dote upon his massive collection of over 700 compact discs.\n\nAside from his love of music, he is also known for his love of sledgehammers, Flogging Molly, and kilts, which he has worn on numerous episodes of The Screen Savers and DL.TV. He is a recovering alcoholic, claiming on an episode of DL.TV that he started drinking at age 16. He has come out in favor of Net Neutrality.\n\nNorton was spotted by Google Maps' Street View, jaywalking in front of Ziff Davis headquarters in San Francisco, CA.[5]\n\n[edit] References\n\n[edit] External links"
