The utility of phylogenies for addressing a wide variety of biological questions is evident in the rapidly increasing number of published gene and species trees. The impact that this deluge of species and gene tree estimates will have on our understanding of the forces that shape biodiversity will be limited by the accessibility of these trees, and the underlying data and methods of analysis. The true structure of species trees and gene trees is rarely known. Rather, estimates are obtained through the application of increasingly sophisticated phylogenetic inference methods to increasingly large and complicated datasets. The need for Minimum Information about Phylogenetic Analyses (MIAPA) reporting standard is clear, but specification of the standard has been hampered by the absence of controlled vocabularies to describe phylogenetic methodologies and workflows.\n\nPREDOSE eScience,Health Care and Life Science, Semantic Social Web, Knowledge Acquisition and Validation : PREDOSE is the name of the NIH funded PREscription Drug abuse Online-Surveillance and Epidemiology project (July 2011 - present) which is an inter-disciplinary collaborative project between the Ohio Center for Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) and the Center for Treatment\n\nSA-REST : SA-REST Draft version (obsolete)\n\nSA-REST Annotator : Annotation plugin for SA-REST\n\nProvenance Management Framework\n\nScooner: Semantically Connecting Objects through Named Entities and Relationships : The limitations of key word based search are well known in the information retrieval field.
