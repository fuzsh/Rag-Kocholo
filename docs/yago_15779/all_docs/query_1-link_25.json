        "text": "“In America,” “American Splendor,” and “Raising Victor Vargas” Top Nominees for 2004 IFP Independent Spirit Awards\n\nby Brian Brooks\n\nJim Sheridan’s “In America,” Shari Springer Berman and Robert\n\nPulcini’s “American Splendor,” and Peter Sollet’s “Raising Victor\n\nVargas” topped the list of nominees for the 2004 IFP Independent\n\nSpirit Awards, which were announced this morning in Los Angeles. Also in\n\nthe running for honors is Sofia Coppola’s “Lost in Translation,”\n\nwhich received four nominations including best picture and best director as\n\nwell as Billy Ray’s “Shattered Glass,” also named in four categories\n\nincluding best picture and best screenplay (Billy Ray).\n\nNominations were announced for best feature, best first feature, best\n\nfirst screenplay, best director, best screenplay, the John Cassavetes\n\naward (given to the best feature made for a budget under $500,000), best\n\nmale lead, best female lead, best supporting male, best supporting female,\n\nbest debut performance, best cinematography, best foreign film, and best\n\ndocumentary. “In America” led the pack six nominations including best\n\nfeature and best director, while “American Splendor,” winner of the\n\nSundance 2003 Grand Jury prize, has five nominations, also including\n\nbest feature and best director. Also vying for the best feature and best\n\ndirector prizes is “Raising Victor Vargas” which received a total of five\n\nnominations. Gus Van Sant’s Cannes 2003 Palme d’Or winner\n\n“Elephant” received two nominations including best director (Van Sant\n\nalso received the best director prize this year in Cannes) as well as for\n\nbest cinematography (Harris Savides).\n\nThree directors were named to compete for this year’s Turning Leaf\n\nSomeone to Watch award, which includes a $20,000 unrestricted grant.\n\nNominees in the category are Andrew Bujalski for “Funny Ha Ha,”\n\nBen Coccio for “Zero Day,” and Ryan Eslinger for\n\n“Madness and Genius.” Additionally, the 2004 Spirit Awards\n\nnominations committee will honor Alejandro González\n\nIñárritu’s “21 Grams” with a special distinction award\n\n“for uniqueness of vision, bold conception and direction.” Because of Spirit\n\nAwards guidelines, the film was not eligible for nominations in individual\n\ncategories because the film’s budget exceeded the committee’s interpretation\n\nof the IFP’s criteria of “economy of means.” [Iñárritu\n\npreviously told indieWIRE the film’s budget was around $20 million.]\n\n“There’s a wide spectrum of filmmaking [with] voices that are personal\n\nand original,” commented Dawn Hudson, executive director of IFP/Los\n\nAngeles in a conversation with indieWIRE. “The spectrum of filmmaking is\n\nwider than in past years [which] shows that independent filmmakers have the\n\nconfidence to take on [unique] genres.”\n\nProducer Jeff Kleeman chaired this year’s 11-member nominations\n\ncommittee. In order to be considered, submitted films must have screened at\n\na commercial theater during the 2003 calendar year, or have played at one of\n\nthe following seven festivals: IFP Los Angeles Film Festival, New\n\nDirectors/New Films, New York, Seattle, Sundance, Telluride, or Toronto.\n\nWinners for the IFP Independent Spirit Awards are voted on by the IFP’s\n\n9,000 national members. The awards will take place in Santa Monica on\n\nSaturday, February 28, 2004, one day prior to the 2004 Academy Awards.\n\n2004 IFP INDEPENDENT SPIRIT AWARD NOMINATIONS – BY CATEGORY\n\nBEST FEATURE (Award given to the Producer)\n\n* Executive Producers are not listed.\n\nAmerican Splendor\n\nProducer: Ted Hope\n\nIn America\n\nProducers: Jim Sheridan, Arthur Lappin\n\nLost in Translation\n\nProducers: Sofia Coppola, Ross Katz\n\nRaising Victor Vargas\n\nProducers: Alain de la Mata, Robin O’Hara, Scott Macaulay, Peter Sollett\n\nShattered Glass\n\nProducers: Craig Baumgarten, Tove Christensen, Gaye Hirsch, Adam Merims\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nAmerican Splendor\n\nShari Springer Berman & Robert Pulcini\n\nLost in Translation\n\nSofia Coppola\n\nIn America\n\nJim Sheridan\n\nRaising Victor Vargas\n\nPeter Sollett\n\nElephant\n\nGus Van Sant\n\nBEST SCREENPLAY\n\nAmerican Splendor\n\nWriters: Shari Springer Berman & Robert Pulcini\n\nLost in Translation\n\nWriter: Sofia Coppola\n\nA Mighty Wind\n\nWriters: Christopher Guest & Eugene Levy and the cast of A Mighty Wind\n\nPieces of April\n\nWriter: Peter Hedges\n\nShattered Glass\n\nWriter: Billy Ray\n\nBEST FIRST FEATURE (Award given to the Director and Producer)\n\nBomb the System\n\nDirector: Adam Bhala Lough\n\nProducers: Ben Rekhi, Sol Tryon\n\nHouse of Sand and Fog\n\nDirector: Vadim Perelman\n\nProducers: Michael London, Vadim Perelman\n\nMonster\n\nDirector: Patty Jenkins\n\nProducers: Mark Damon, Donald Kushner, Clark Peterson, Charlize Theron, Brad\n\nWyman\n\nQuattro Noza\n\nDirector: Joey Curtis\n\nProducer: Fredric King\n\nThirteen\n\nDirector: Catherine Hardwicke\n\nProducers: Jeffrey Levy-Hinte, Michael London\n\nJOHN CASSAVETES AWARD\n\n(Given to the best feature made for under $500,000.
