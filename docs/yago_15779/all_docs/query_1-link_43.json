        "text": "I usually feel a strong affinity for films which are set in my home cities\n\n– Mona Lisa, say, or anything by Woody Allen. New York has way,\n\nway more than its fair share of indy filmmakers, so a lot of low-budget films\n\nend up being set here. The wonderful Sunshine\n\nCinema specialises in such films: it’s where I saw 13 Conversations\n\nAbout One Thing, Roger Dodger, and Tadpole. Finally,\n\nlast night, I got around to seeing Raising\n\nVictor Vargas there, as well.\n\nRaising Victor Vargas is a world apart from the privileged life portrayed\n\nin Igby Goes Down etc. It’s set in what all the film reviews insist\n\non calling the Lower East Side, although nearly all of it takes place north\n\nof Houston Street. Still, the moniker is fair: what we’re seeing is Loisaida\n\nAvenue, not Avenue C. (For those of you who don’t live here, they’re physically\n\nthe same, but conceptually very different: the former is old-school Hispanic;\n\nthe latter new-school yuppie.) The big divide in this (my) neck of the woods\n\nthese days is not Houston Street so much as it is disposable income: there are\n\nmany poor families living on welfare and clipping supermarket coupons, as well\n\nas bars with $2,000 bottles\n\nof champagne and a new\n\nhotel which will charge up to $2,500 a night.\n\nBut there are no yuppies in Raising Victor Vargas, there is no class\n\nwar. Our eponymous hero lives in a cramped apartment in the projects, sharing\n\nhis bedroom with his sister and his bed with his brother, but there’s\n\nno resentment in this film, no indication that he’s living on what is probably\n\nthe richest island in the world. Victor’s the kind of kid who rejoices at finding\n\na quarter on the street, but he would never claim\n\nabject poverty the way that much better-off LES writers do.\n\nThe lack of drugs or guns or money issues in this film is entirely deliberate.\n\nIn an interview\n\nwith Peter Sollett, the director, Bill Chambers notes that \"the milieu\n\nis all but incidental (Sollett picked the film’s central location based on the\n\nLatino community’s enthusiastic response to an open casting call)\". It’s\n\na little bit weird to see a film which was entirely shot on location in Manhattan\n\nbut which has no real New York feeling to it: the camera generally stays low\n\nto the ground, concentrating on the characters, who in turn never stray from\n\ntheir own small neighborhood. Even I, who have lived here for over six years,\n\nhad difficulty pinpointing most of the locations. If it wasn’t for the occasional\n\nrooftop shot with the Empire State Building in the background, most people would\n\nnever know the film was shot here at all.\n\nRaising Victor Vargas, then, is not about Latino life on the Lower\n\nEast Side, any more than The Wizard of Oz is about life on a Kansas\n\nfarm. It’s a much more universal film, which will appeal to anybody who’s ever\n\nlived through the years between 11 and 18. School’s out for the summer, and\n\nthe New York heat is prompting the kids to start taking their clothes off. These\n\naren’t the funnysexysmartcocky kids of Hollywood teen comedies, either. They’re\n\nreal in a way which makes you realise just how fake most US films are when dealing\n\nwith adolescents. The casual cruelties, the weight obsesssions, the nervous\n\nfumblings towards wanted-and-feared sex: this film makes you remember just what\n\nit was like when you were a kid.\n\nCredit must go to Smollett, but not for his writing chops: rather, he simply\n\ntook kids off the street, pointed a camera at them, and trusted them so much\n\nthat they ended up giving him some amazing scenes. \"Victor suggesting to\n\nNino that the way they get the attention of a girl is by licking their lips\n\nin a sexy way or the argument over who broke the telephone – I mean, you\n\ncan’t write that stuff,\" he says in the interview. \"You just sort\n\nof have to let them go at each other and try to cut it.\" Using untrained\n\nactors is a bold move, but trusting their acting abilities so much that you\n\njust let them improvise the scenes – that takes real daring, and paid\n\noff handsomely in this case.\n\nWhat’s most heartening is that this film, like Bend\n\nIt Like Beckham, seems to be taking off. It’s already grossed more\n\nthan its budget, and has increased the number of screens it’s showing on –\n\nalong with its weekend gross – every week since its release at the end\n\nof March. We’re entering the braindead summer zone now, with X2, Daddy\n\nDay Care and their ilk, so Raising Victor Vargas should have a\n\nchance of positioning itself as a good film for the over-25 set. It’s funny,\n\nit’s touching, it’s immensely likeable, and it’s even American, to boot. It’s\n\nobviously a budget film: the titles and sountrack leave quite a lot to be desired,\n\nfor instance. But Sollett managed to find the money to shoot on film, which\n\nmakes it look professional – unlike most films which are shot on DV.\n\nAll the same, it does seem that the good films these days are all very short\n\non ambition: Raising Victor Vargas, for instance, is a small-scale\n\nfamily drama which, if anything, is proud of the fact that it has no larger\n\nmessage. What I long to see is a smaller, intelligent film which aspires to\n\ngreatness: something along the lines of Breaking the Waves, say. It\n\nseems to me that American independent filmmakers are a bit like British novelists,\n\nunable to think big. Why let Hollywood and pretentious Europeans have a monopoly\n\non hubristic excess?"
