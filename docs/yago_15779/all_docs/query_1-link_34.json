        "text": "Heather Graham ~ Lead Actor\n\nHeather Graham is probably best known for the iconic characters she created as Roller Girl in Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS and Felicity Shagwell in AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME. As part of the cast of Emilio Estevez' Bobby Kennedy biopic, BOBBY, Heather recently received a Best Acting Ensemble nomination from the Screen Actors Guild. Graham also executive produced and starred opposite Sandra Oh and Taye Diggs in the romantic comedy CAKE and stars opposite Bridget Moynihan, Tom Cavanagh and Sissy Spacek in the comedy GRAY MATTERS.\n\nFirst gathering attention in Gus Van Sant's DRUGSTORE COWBOY opposite Matt Dillon, she next came out with her doe-eyed performance in SWINGERS, which starred Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn. She then starred as an ambitious young actress from Ohio in Frank Oz's BOWFINGER opposite Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, followed by her portrayal of the tragic Mary Kelly in Albert and Allen Hughes' FROM HELL opposite Johnny Depp. Soon after, she starred in Daisy von Scherler Mayer's Bollywood-inspired romantic comedy, THE GURU, alongside Marisa Tomei and Jimi Mistry.\n\nHer other film credits include HOPE SPRING, COMMITTED, Ed Burns' SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK; James Toback's TWO GIRLS AND A GUY with Robert Downey Jr.; LOST IN SPACE and SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION. On the small screen, she made her television series debut last year in ABC's EMILY'S REASONS WHY NOT. Heather starred in David Lynch's cult series TWIN PEAKS and opposite Jessica Lange in the Hallmark movie O' PIONEERS. She made her stage debut off-Broadway in Playwrights Horizons' RECENT TRAGIC EVENTS.\n\nVictor Rasuk ~ Lead Actor\n\nOne of the brightest young talents working today, Victor Rasuk was nominated for a 2004 Independent Spirit Award for Best Debut Performance, as the title character in Peter Sollett's RAISING VICTOR VARGAS. At age 17, Rasuk gave an extraordinary performance that one would only expect from a more seasoned actor. Samuel Goldwyn Films released the film in New York and Los Angeles in March 2003.\n\nIn 2005, Rasuk appeared in Catherine Hardwicke's LORDS OF DOGTOWN, where he played world renowned skateboarder Tony Alva. Based on the 2001 documentary DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS, Rasuk's co-stars in the film included Heath Ledger, Emile Hirsch, Johnny Knoxville and John Robinson. Rasuk also starred in HAVEN opposite Orlando Bloom, in the story of a young man who is driven to murder as Americans, Brions, and Caymanians mix it up in the Grand Caymans. Directed by Frank E. Flowers, HAVEN premiered at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival.\n\nRasuk began acting at age fourteen; he starred in his first short THE SUN ALWAYS SHINES in 1997 when he answered an ad posted in his neighborhood to audition for an NYU student film. He went on to act in various other short films including Sollett's FIVE FEET HIGH AND RISING.\n\nRaised on the Lower East Side, Rasuk currently resides in Los Angeles.\n\nDominic Chianese ~ Lead Actor\n\nDominic Chianese was born February 24, 1931 in Bronx, New York. He is perhaps best known for his role as Corrado \"Uncle Junior\" Soprano on the HBO TV series, THE SOPRANOS, a role that has netted him two Emmy Award nominations.\n\nChianese worked as a bricklayer with his father and attended night school during the 1950s, graduating with a bachelor's degree in Speech and Theater from Brooklyn College in 1961. His earliest stage work occurred in 1952 with a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory company of singers, actors, and musicians called The American Savoyards, under the direction of Dorothy Raedler.\n\nAfter a decade of doing theatre, both in college and off-Broadway shows, Chianese attended his first professional acting class at HB Studios, with renowned teacher Walt Witcover in Manhattan. Acting became Chianese's passion, along with musical theater. His first Broadway show was OLIVER! in 1965. Since then he has worked at regional theatres, off-Broadway and on Broadway all through the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Chianese's first television credit was due to George C. Scott recommending him for his acclaimed series EAST SIDE, WEST SIDE.\n\nIn 1974, Francis Ford Coppola cast him as \"Johnny Ola\" in THE GODFATHER, PART II, which set a film career in motion, culminating with several films (and plays) with Al Pacino, including Norman Jewison's ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and Sidney Lumet's DOG DAY AFTERNOON. Dominic worked for Lumet again in Q&A and NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN, and for director Alan Pakula on the political thriller ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. Before getting the call for GODFATHER II, Chianese was working for the Drug Commission of New York State as a recreational worker in a rehab center. He was teaching guitar to women who were serving time for drug-related crimes.\n\nChianese is a musician, having released a CD titled HITS in 2000, on which he sings American and Italian songs. He performed Salvatore Cardillo's sentimental classic \"Core 'ngrato\" (\"Ungrateful Heart\") on the third-season finale of THE SOPRANOS.\n\nDominic is a graduate of the Bronx High School of Science.\n\nElizabeth Peña ~ Supporting Actor\n\nBorn in the US, Elizabeth Peña was raised in Cuba and moved back to Manhattan at the age of eight. A graduate of the famed High School of Performing Arts, Peña went on to appear in more than 20 off-Broadway shows and toured for two years as Shakespeare's Juliet. She has worked with such renowned theater companies as Joseph Papp's Public Theater, La Mama, and San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater.\n\nElizabeth's film career started with small roles in the Cuban/US production EL SUPER (1979) and the American features TIMES SQUARE (1980), THEY ALL LAUGHED (1981) and CROSSOVER DREAMS (1985). Her performance as the maid-turned-revolutionary in Paul Mazursky's DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS (1986) brought her to the attention of a wider audience. She went on to play the battered wife of Ritchie Valens' half-brother in LA BAMBA (1987), the doomed friend of policewoman Jamie Lee Curtis in Kathryn Bigelow's BLUE STEEL and Tim Robbins' temperamental lover in Adrian Lyne's JACOB'S LADDER (both 1990). After supporting roles in THE WATERDANCE (1992) and DEAD FUNNY (1995), Peña earned acclaim for her 1996 turn as a schoolteacher and former lover of the town sheriff played by Chris Cooper in John Sayles' LONE STAR (1996).\n\nElizabeth is also known for her TV work, beginning with a supporting role in the police sitcom TOUGH COOKIES (CBS, 1986). She had the title role in the short-lived I MARRIED DORA (ABC, 1988). She also played the regular role of an aggressive secretary on the John Sayles-created legal drama SHANNON'S DEAL (NBC, 1990-91). Elizabeth has turned in strong performances in nearly a dozen TV-movies, miniseries and anthologies. She played the widow of a DEA agent in the award-winning DRUG WARS: THE CAMARENA STORY (NBC, 1990), appears in the AIDS drama ROOMMATES (NBC, 1994) and was featured in the HBO TV-movie, THE SECOND CIVIL WAR (1997).\n\nPeña is much sought-after for supporting film roles--including the hit buddy comedy RUSH HOUR (1998) and rocker Dee Snyder's offbeat horror film STRANGELAND (1998). She played the wife of a real life spy in the telepic ALDRICH AMES: TRAITOR WITHIN (1998). She became a television series regular when she starred as Beatriz \"Bibi\" Corrales in the Showtime drama RESURRECTION BLVD. (2000-2002). Elizabeth has always struck a balance between appearing in Latina-specific roles, such as her turn opposite Hector Elizondo in TORTILLA SOUP (2001) and non-ethnic parts like the therapist of a pre-operative transexual's played by Felicity Huffman in TRANSAMERICA (2005).\n\nShe also had a side career as a voice actor, lending her distinctive vocals to such animated projects as JUSTICE LEAGUE, MAYA & MIGUEL and, most notably, as the bad-girl-gone-good Mirage in Disney/Pixar's THE INCREDIBLES (2004).\n\nWilliam Baldwin ~ Supporting Actor\n\nIn addition to ADRIFT IN MANHATTAN, William Baldwin has completed a number of recent film projects, including FEEL, LENEXA, 1 MILE, SAKURA, PLUMM SUMMER, PARK, and AMERICAN FORK. Baldwin will also partner with Chazz Palminteri to write, produce, and star in the new cable television series STAG.\n\nIn 2005, William Baldwin starred with Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels in THE SQUID & THE WHALE, the critically acclaimed drama directed by Noah Baumbach and produced by director Wes Anderson, which won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival and was recognized on over 200 \"Top 10 Lists\".\n\nBaldwin, who has a penchant for choosing original and eclectic projects, has starred in the screen adaptation of Noel Coward's RELATIVE VALUES with Steven Fry, Colin Firth and Julie Andrews; ONE EYED KING, an Irish Hell's Kitchen drama with Chazz Palminteri and Armand Assante; \"YOU STUPID MAN,\" a romantic comedy starring Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich; THE BROTHERHOOD OF MURDER, a drama about a breakaway faction of the Aryan Nation with Peter Gallagher and Kelly Lynch as well as Universal's techno-thriller VIRUS with Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Sutherland. His other films include SHATTERED IMAGE, CURDLED, PYROMANIACS: A LOVE STORY, FAIR GAME, SLIVER, THREE OF HEARTS, BACKDRAFT, FLATLINERS, INTERNAL AFFAIRS, and THE PREPPY MURDER.\n\nA native of Massapequa, New York, Baldwin graduated from State University of New York at Binghamton with a degree in Political Science. After studying acting for several years in New York, Baldwin launched his film career with Oliver Stone's BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. Baldwin serves on the boards of: Project ALS, which raises funds to find a cure for Lou Gehrig's Disease; The Massapequa Community Fund, an endowment providing grants to local non-profits and scholarships to graduating seniors in Billy's childhood hometown, Massapequa, Long Island; Mercy Corps, an international relief organization; and The Carol M.

When KEANE was released in September 2005, Ebert & Roeper lauded its \"amazing camera work,\" while The National Catholic Reporter said, \"If Mr. Lewis deserves an Oscar nomination for his ability to suggest the range of urban anxieties, recognition is also due to John Foster's hand-held camera work.\" Accordingly, John received his second Independent Spirit Award nomination for cinematography on KEANE. John's latest film is the drama ADRIFT IN MANHATTAN featuring Heather Graham and Billy Baldwin.\n\nJohn's documentary work has not taken a back seat to his work on narrative features.
