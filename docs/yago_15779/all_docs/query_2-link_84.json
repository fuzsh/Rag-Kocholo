        "text": "Victor Rasuk Character(s) Ben Caldwell Date of Birth January 15, 1984 Origin New York City, New York, USA\n\nVictor Rasuk (born January 15, 1984) is an American actor best known for his role as Cameron Calderon in the show How to Make It in America and his role as José Rodriguez in the movie Fifty Shades of Grey.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nRasuk was born in New York City, New York, the son of Dominican parents. He has one brother, Silvestre,with whom he starred in Raising Victor Vargas. Rasuk attended performing arts school as a teenager, and began acting at 14.\n\nCareer[]\n\nRasuk gained his first film role at the age of 16 in the short film Five Feet High and Rising. The film was a hit at the Independent Spirit Film Festival. Two years later, the director suggested expanding the short film into a feature-length film, Raising Victor Vargas, which went on to win Rasuk an Independent Spirit Award nomination for his work. In his next film, Rock Steady, he played a character named Roc. Two years later, he took a leading role in Haven.\n\nIn 2005, Lords of Dogtown was released, with Victor playing Tony Alva. The part included surfing and performing skateboarding tricks. Although the more complicated maneuvers were performed by stuntmen, Rasuk is a method actor and worked on remaining in character both on and off screen.\n\nBelieving he had mastered skating a huge ramp in only his second week of training, he fractured one of his orbital bones. He says that the accident likely earned him more respect from serious skaters within the cast and crew. Rasuk starred in the two-season HBO television series How To Make It In America.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilms Year Title Character Notes 2017 Fifty Shades Darker Jose Rodriguez Announced 2015 Fifty Shades of Grey Jose Rodriguez 2014 Godzilla Tre Morales 2013 Jobs Bill Fernandez 2012 El Jefe Alfonso 'Al' Rodriguez 2012 Being Flynn Gabriel 2011 Keep Coming Back Bobby 2011 Celestina Nelson 2010 Apples Valet 2009 The War Boys Greg 2009 Life Is Hot in Cracktown Manny 2008 Che Rogelio Acevedo 2008 Stop-Loss Pvt.
