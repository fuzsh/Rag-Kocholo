        "text": "Review: Raising Victor Vargas (M)\n\nRating: ***Â½\n\nThere's a beguiling and occasionally disconcerting innocence about Raising Victor Vargas. It's a feeling that floats through the film and its vision of Latino Lower East Side teenagers exploring first love and family dynamics, in a summer haze of cautious moves, yearning looks, suspicious glances, carefully rehearsed lines and insistent declarations.\n\nSixteen-year-old Victor (Victor Rasuk) lives with his family in a cramped apartment, sharing a bedroom with his siblings. He has a tetchy relationship with his younger sister, Vicki (Krystal Rodriguez): his little brother Nino (Silvestre Rasuk) worships him and seeks his advice on girls. Their grandmother (Altagracia Guzman) looks after them, fretting about their behaviour and moral status, and worrying, in particular, about Victor's influence on Nino, her baby boy. When Nino earnestly plays a Bach piano piece for her, as his brother and sister listen, she feels that the family is united and good.\n\nVictor, however, has his mind elsewhere and his holiday moves planned. Hanging out at the pool, he looks longingly at Judy (Judy Marte), a poised, composed and beautiful girl sitting with her friend Melonie (Melonie Diaz). He sashays up to her, confidently introducing himself and his \"associate\", his buddy Harold (Kevin Rivera). To his amazement, she rebuffs his advances. Undeterred, he approaches her again, via her little brother Carlos (Wilfree Vasquez), who'll only do Victor the favour for something in return.\n\nVictor's courtship - ardent, assured, with sudden moments of vulnerability - manages to get under Judy's skin. But there are complications to follow, not the least of which is his grandmother's increasing suspicion that he's up to no good, and taking the family to hell or somewhere pretty close. She's prepared to take a potentially drastic step to address the problem - a step with consequences that are a mixture of comedy and pathos.\n\nThis is writer-director Peter Sollett's first feature.\n\nThere's something warm and affectionate about his vision of the characters and their relationships, of the close-ups that seem almost to embrace his young characters, and the domestic detail in scenes such as Victor washing his brother's hair or grandma making hamburger patties.\n\nIt's a sunny portrait of the neighbourhood, with no trace of gangs, guns or drugs, a Romeo and Juliet story without Montagues or Capulets - instead, a grandmother from the Dominican Republic who keeps a strict, suspicious eye on her charges. They might rail against her, but don't want to cause her pain.\n\nThe ugliest moments are the brief barrages of innuendo, from guys on the street, that seem to follow Judy wherever she goes. She doesn't want the attention, but she doesn't want to be intimidated by it either. Marte gives Judy a melancholy, slightly insular quality, a strong contrast to the energy of Rasuk's Victor, who's almost jumping out of his skin with eagerness to prove himself.\n\nThe essential sunniness of Raising Victor Vargas doesn't prevent it from delving into some potentially troubling areas - moments of pain, scenes of manipulation, challenges to the solidity of the family, to friendship and to trust. And although his characters take risks, in their search for intimacy, love, friendship and independence, Sollett keeps his film hopeful and positive. There's something refreshing, almost startling, in this kind of optimism."
