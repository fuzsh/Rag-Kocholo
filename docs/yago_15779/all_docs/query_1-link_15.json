        "text": "I am being very broad when I ask this question/statement, I'm including movies made by Dominicans and movies about DR topics. I just saw \"The Galindez Files\", and it was bad. The movie is about a collegiate researching Galindez mysterious disappearance, it supposedly takes place in DR, and the plot revolves around the Dominican Republic and Trujillo, etc. In reality, the movie is filmed in Cuba with Cuban actors, it looks and feels nothing like DR. I was not amused by the plot or direction, I was amazed how the lead actress tried to carry the script, she was the only enjoyable part of the film. After viewing this film, I began to ponder, \"will there ever be a good Dominican movie?\"\n\nI've seen many Dominican films. The only film that I've \"enjoyed\" to date is \"Negocios son negocios\", I would rate it a 5/10. The script is not original, it has a bunch of Dominican cliches, for example mentioning the name of the movie in the movie. Some of the characters are miscast-ed (sic), for example Cuquin Victoria as the evil banker Jacinto Montes de Oca, he just can't play an evil person. The jokes although cliche seem to be more than plain old Dominican humor, universal, they gave me a nice chuckle.\n\nAfter viewing movies from other countries I wonder if the Dominican movie industry will ever catch up. I've seen bad movies from other countries as well but yet some can make me think, for example the Spaniard produced film \"Goya's Ghost\", this movie was not particularly bad, just disappointing. \"Goya's Ghost\" at least gave me something to think about, although the director seems to be throwing alot of ideas to the audience until one would stick. The Mexican film industry has grown since the days of ranchero movies, nowadays they have produce good films such as \"Y tu mama tambien\", \"Amores perros\", and even controversial films such as \"Batalla en el cielo\".\n\nWhat bothers me as well are the movies done by foreigners about DR or a Dominican topic that just are not well thought out. \"The Galindez Files\" is a perfect example, why is it that movies about DR are filmed in Cuba, yet movies about Cuba are filmed in DR? \"La fiesta del chivo\" is another movie that let me down, after viewing it a couple of times since me first review, I just think Trujillo wasn't represented as the tyrant he was, and the atmosphere of 1960s DR wasn't captured.\n\nAnother thing that comes to my mind was the supposed Studio (LF announced) that was going to be built in DR for like $2 Billion Dollars, what ever happened to that?\n\nSo to conclude, do you think that the DR film industry will ever produce a good movie?\n\nPeace.\n\nHeketi\n\nI won't say that we will never see a really good movie because never is a very long time.\n\nIf at least one Dominican movie is produced each year from now to eternity and assuming the quality of the average film doesn't improve by much, most of those movies will be crap but a few will be real gems. It's a numbers game, the more movies are produced the greater the chances a good one will come through some day, but that will only be an anomaly.\n\nI think that we are years from seeing a consistent flow of good Dominican movies.\n\nAs the Dominican film industry expands and attracts more directors/producers, the quality will inevitably improve. It's either that or the Dominican film industry will experience a premature death.\n\nIt's like the old saying: \"good things takes time.\"\n\n-NALs\n\nYou're right, Kid. I've yet to see any Dominican-made, Dominican-produced, or Dominican-acted movie that was any good. None. They are so......stupid. And cliche. They are insulting to the average person's intelligence.\n\nI've often wondered, \"Where do they get these 'actors?'\", and who told the 'writer' he could write, or the 'director' he could direct? Their \"creativity\" is so limited and they have such narrow minds and corny humor. They need to get out more, read more, broaden their horizons, and explore the world before they start thinking they can represent the DR and show the rest of the world a cinematic interpretation of anything.\n\nI, however, am more than happy to act in any movie. And as soon as I have sufficient time to totally immerse myself in this project, I will begin writing my memoirs and its ensuing script. Seriously, any takers? :classic:\n\n-Indie\n\nThe ONLY half-way decent movie I recommend watching that is smart and has Dominican actors in it is \"Raising Victor Vargas.\" It is an indie film about the coming-of-age story of a Dominican lad and his dysfunctional family set in Brooklyn, New York. It is hilarious, real, human, and the actors basically play themselves in the movie. I think the director let them do what they wanted and it actually worked, 'cause they were honest. My mom knows the actor who plays the grandmother in the movie, Tatica/Altagracia, and she is exactly the way her character is portrayed in the movie. The casting director, Mr. Terrero, who happens to be a New York-raised Dominican, did a really good job casting these kids in my opinion. He got them all from Washington Heights.\n\nIf you get a chance, you should definitely watch this movie. It's out on VHS/DVD and Blockbuster has it. Also some public libraries in the US have it.\n\nLet me know your opinions.\n\n-Indie"
