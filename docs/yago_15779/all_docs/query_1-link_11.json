        "text": "Peter Sollett, the director of 2008’s “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist,” has been tapped to write and direct Warner Bros.’ long-awaited film adaptation of “Minecraft.”\n\nBased on the wildly popular global video game, the story follows a teenage girl and her unlikely group of adventurers who, after the malevolent Ender Dragon sets out on a path of destruction, must save their beautiful, blocky Overworld.\n\nThe film will be produced by Vertigo’s Roy Lee and Jon Berg. Jill Messick, who died last February, is also still credited as a producer. Video game developer Mojang is also on board as a producer. And Jon Spaihts will serve as executive producer.\n\nWarner Bros. landed the coveted film rights to the game back in 2014 and the studio has worked hard to launch the potential franchise ever since.\n\nVarious talent and filmmakers have been attached to the project. Last year it underwent a major rebuild, with then-director and co-writer Rob McElhenney dropping out of the project. The film was also knocked off track for its May 2019 release.\n\nIn addition to “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist,” Sollet’s previous films include “Freeheld” and the critically acclaimed film “Raising Victor Vargas.”\n\nSollett is repped by CAA."
