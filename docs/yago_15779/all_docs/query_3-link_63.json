        "text": "A-\n\nA coming-of-age tale set in the Dominican section of Manhattan’s Lower East Side, Peter Sollett’s feature debut “Raising Victor Vargas” is narratively slight but wonderfully vivid and genuinely moving. This small, delicate film is an absolute gem, a cinematic short story of considerable insight and charm.\n\nThe title character is a good-looking teen (Victor Rasuk) who lives in a crowded apartment with his fussy, traditionalist grandmother (Altagracia Guzman) and siblings–stepsister Vicki (Krystal Rodriguez), a chubby coach potato who delights in embarrassing him by spreading news of his brief encounter with the girl upstairs, and younger brother Nino (Silvestre Rasuk), grandma’s devoted favorite. Victor has a longing to be a neighborhood Lothario, and accompanied by his buddy Harold (Kevin Rivera), he approaches the beautiful Judy (Judy Marte) and her friend Melonie (Melonie Diaz) at the local swimming pool. Judy tells him to buzz off–it’s later revealed that she and Melonie have sworn off boys altogether–but he persuades her brother Carlos (Wilfree Vasquez), who’s interested in Vicki, that they should give mutual assistance to one another’s romantic efforts. What follows is a gentle comedy of errors in which Victor and Judy, Melonie and Harold and Vicki and Carlos all haltingly connect, and in the process the young protagonist sheds his macho posturing in favor of a refreshing honesty. Meanwhile Grandma, a pious Catholic who considers the very possibility of teen sex an invitation to disaster, is horrified when her angel Nino shows evidence of engaging in what was once called the solitary vice, and, blaming Victor’s baleful influence, threatens to banish him from the home. But while the confrontations and difficulties that arise over the course of the action are certainly serious (and played quite straight), and there’s occasional meanness and pettiness on display, there’s never any doubt about the underlying affection that binds the characters together. Everybody learns something over the course of the few days during which we watch these engaging, if occasionally frustrating, people–even Grandma, who has to admit that while the kids can’t get along without her, she needs them too. Yet neither the instruction nor the learning is portrayed with a heavy hand.\n\nThis script may be slender, composed mostly of grace notes, but it’s played with an endearing lightness of touch. Sollett’s direction seems utterly devoid of artifice, but that’s clearly not the case, because under his knowing hand the cast gives beautifully unaffected performances; the family scenes are a flawless blend of love and tension. The elder Rakus and Guzman anchor things splendidly. His boyish eagerness easily alternates with a convincing sense of vulnerability, and her nattering rigidity and inability to understand modern mores don’t conceal her real maternal concern for her charges. Among the others Marte has the requisite toughness to go along with her beauty, and Diaz has a delightfully clownish mien that meshes well with Rivera’s more manic demeanor. The younger Rakus makes Nino a true charmer, and the interplay between Rodriguez and Vasquez is very winning. The picture has been very simply and unpretentiously made, but the style fits the material; the only unfortunate choice is to divide scenes with an excess of establishing shots of the neighborhood, which over time come to seem like so much padding.\n\nBut otherwise there’s little if anything in “Raising Victor Vargas” one would want to see excised. That’s a far cry from most Hollywood coming-of-age tales, which are mostly crude farce and cruder sentimentality, and entirely disposable. By contrast this little film offers dramatic honesty and delicately understated humor–a far happier combination."
