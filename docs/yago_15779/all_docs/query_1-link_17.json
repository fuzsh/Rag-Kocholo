        "text": "You’re never too old to watch coming-of-age movies. These films remind us of the magic of being young—that time when we had fewer responsibilities and much more innocence than we have now. The best coming-of-age films marry a compelling storyline, such as sending the main character on a mission, with a great backstory, such as giving the protagonist something they need to come to terms with about themselves. Every great movie also has memorable supporting characters who help the main character learn something they couldn’t recognize on their own. Whether they’re funny, moving or insightful (and often all three), the top coming-of-age films on this list can be watched repeatedly without getting old.\n\nTop Coming-Of-Age Movies\n\nThe top-grossing coming-of-age movie of all time on this list is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which made an astounding $940 million. The most notable directors include John Hughes (who’s known for his teen-focused movies), Sofia Coppola and Amy Heckerling, as well as Oscar nominees like John Singleton and Spike Lee.\n\nThe oldest movie among the top coming-of-age films is Cooley High, released in 1975. The musical classic Grease came out just three years later, and the rest of the movies were in theaters in the 1980s and beyond.\n\n30. Raising Victor Vargas (2002)\n\nEvery coming-of-age film features a main character struggling to come to terms with something. On the surface, Victor (Victor Rasuk) is down about his lack of luck with the ladies, but deeper down he’s having trouble with his family. Director Peter Sollett’s film wasn’t a box office success, but it has become a cult favorite.\n\nThe R-rated movie has an impressive 96% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes. You can watch Raising Victor Vargas on tubi, Pluto TV, Peacock, Roku Channel, PLEX, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+.\n\n29. The Half of It (2020)\n\nThis Netflix production, which found a devoted audience during COVID lockdown, is a retelling of the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, with closeted outcast teen Ellie Chu (a perfectly cast Leah Lewis) composing love letters for sweet jock Paul (Daniel Diemer). Paul doesn’t know Ellie also has a crush on Aster (Alexxis Lemire).\n\nThe love triangle becomes more complicated as Paul and Ellie grow closer in director Alice Wu’s PG-13 film. You can watch The Half of It on Netflix.\n\n28. Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. (1992)\n\nThere are woefully few coming-of-age films focused on Black girls. In this smart, sensitive indie film directed by Leslie Harris, Chantel (Ariyan A. Johnson) works hard at school to fulfill her dreams of attending college and becoming a doctor. But a new relationship suddenly throws her future into question.\n\nThe movie won the Special Grand Jury Prize at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival. You can watch Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. on Pluto, Paramount+, YouTube, fuboTV, Hulu, Sling TV, Roku Channel, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n27. Better Luck Tomorrow (2002)\n\nDirector Justin Lin’s solo directorial debut follows a stereotypical group of Asian-American high achievers who decide to spice up their lives by engaging in petty crime that gradually leads to more and more serious offenses. The cast includes Parry Shen, Jason Tobin and John Cho.\n\nYou can watch the R-rated Better Luck Tomorrow on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n26. The Breakfast Club (1985)\n\nThis classic starring Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson and Emilio Estevez is one of the best ‘80s movies, following five students as they bare their souls and learn what sets them apart—and what draws them together. The hit soundtrack, including “Don’t You (Forget About Me),” makes the John Hughes film even more incredible.\n\nThe movie has more than its fair share of famous quotes, including Nelson’s character telling a teacher to “Eat my shorts.” You can watch The Breakfast Club on Hulu, YouTube, Max, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n25. Wadjda (2012)\n\nSo many great coming-of-age films feature a teen trying to prove themselves by winning a contest that will help them reach a goal. In the Arabic-language Wadjda, Waad Mohammed plays a rebellious Saudi teen who hopes to capture a Koran competition that will get her enough money to buy a bike.\n\nThe PG film written and directed by Haifaa al-Mansour has an incredible 99% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes. You can watch Wadjda on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n24. The Hate U Give (2018)\n\nBased on Angie Thomas’ bestselling young adult novel inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, The Hate U Give follows Starr (Amandla Stenberg), a Black girl constantly code switching between her home in a poor Black neighborhood and the mostly white prep school she attends.\n\nWhen the police murder her childhood friend during a routine traffic stop, Starr must decide whether to stay out of the fray or use her voice to shine a light on injustice (“What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?” she wonders). Director George Tillman Jr.’s PG-13 film received good reviews. You can watch The Hate U Give on Hulu, Sling TV, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n23. The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)\n\nAnother movie based on a popular YA book, Stephen Chbosky’s film follows a teen named Charlie (Logan Lerman) who has trouble making friends until he’s socially adopted by Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller). Charlie eventually discovers why he has difficulty engaging.\n\nThe PG-13 movie is known for the line, “We are infinite.” You can watch The Perks of Being a Wallflower on Hulu, Sling TV, fuboTV, Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n22. Dead Poets Society (1989)\n\nA dynamic teacher (perfectly embodied by Robin Williams) inspires a group of prep school boys to flout convention and step into their strength while living life to the fullest. The all-star cast includes Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke.\n\nDirector Peter Weir’s PG film was a box office smash and critical hit, earning four Oscar nominations, including Williams for Best Actor and the film for Best Picture. As Williams’ character directs his students: “Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.” You can watch Dead Poets Society on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n21. Crooklyn (1994)\n\nDirector Spike Lee based some of this film—about Troy, a boy who’s sent to visit family for the summer, then returns to his home in Brooklyn to face some serious truths—on his own upbringing. The outstanding case includes Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo as Troy’s parents.\n\nLee wrote the PG-13 film with two of his siblings. You can watch Crooklyn on Peacock, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n20. Booksmart (2019)\n\nDirector Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut follows two brilliant but socially awkward teenage girls who, in the grand tradition of coming-of-age-films, decide to shed their outcast status at graduation in order to do something wild. Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein are exquisite in the lead roles.\n\nThe R-rated film received rapturous reviews. You can watch Booksmart on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n19. Cooley High (1975)\n\nThe oldest film on this list, Cooley High follows friends (played by Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman) who have high aspirations for after high school. But when a fun night goes wrong, those long-term plans are put in jeopardy. The cast also includes Garrett Morris.\n\nThe Michael Schultz-directed PG film has a strong 89% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. You can watch Cooley High on tubi, Pluto TV, Roku Channel, Amazon Prime Video and Vudu.\n\n18. Mean Girls (2004)\n\nThe original Mean Girls smartly tells the story of teenage fiefdoms using animal allegories. When Cady (a super Lindsay Lohan) moves from Africa to the U.S., she gets an unexpected lesson in social hierarchy courtesy of resident mean girls the Plastics, led by Regina George (an even better Rachel McAdams).\n\nMark Waters directed the PG-13 movie, based on a Tina Fey script with about a zillion catchphrases (“That was so fetch.”; “On Wednesdays, we wear pink.”; “On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.”). You can watch Mean Girls on Hulu, Sling TV, fuboTV, Paramount+, Pluto TV, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n17. Stand By Me (1986)\n\nStephen King’s short story “The Body” inspired this film about a quartet of teen boys who leave their fraught home lives to try to find a dead body in the woods. The star-studded cast includes Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Keifer Sutherland and Jerry O’Connell.\n\nDirector Rob Reiner’s R-rated film earned one Oscar nomination and two Golden Globe nods. You can watch Stand By Me on Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n16. Grease (1978)\n\nThe movie about a summer romance that sours when the opposites-attract pair return to school spawned a slew of hit songs (Grease, Greased Lightning, You’re the One That I Want) and popular catchphrases from, “She looks too pure to be pink.” to, “You’re cruisin’ for a bruisin’.” and, “Tell me about it, stud.”).\n\nAnd, of course, a bunch of talented young actors starred in the film, including Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta and Stockard Channing. The PG movie was directed by Randal Kleiser. You can watch Grease on Hulu, Max, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n15. Eve’s Bayou (1997)\n\nWhile some label this a horror film due to the spiritual element, it follows a 10-year-old girl whose world turns upside down after her happy family life is shattered. The exceptional cast includes Jurnee Smollett as Eve and Samuel L. Jackson and Lynn Whitfield as her parents, and explores whether our youthful memories match reality.\n\nKasi Lemmons directed and wrote the screenplay for this R-rated film. You can watch Eve’s Bayou on Roku Channel, Philo, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n14. Real Women Have Curves (2002)\n\nAmerica Ferrara’s feature film debut, directed by Patricia Cardoso, follows Ana (Ferrara), a high school senior who aspires to go to college. But her mother thinks Ana should work at the family’s failing textile factory post-graduation, leading to conflict as Ana wants to help her family but also wants to get out on her own.\n\nThe body-positive PG-13 film earned raves from critics and was based on a play of the same name. You can watch Real Women Have Curves on Hulu, Max, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n13. The Sandlot (1993)\n\nOne of the best family movies of all time, The Sandlot follows a ragtag bunch of neighborhood baseball players who come together for one perfect summer of fun and growth. The cast includes Dennis Leary in one of his first dramatic roles, in a film maybe best known for the line, “You’re killing me, Smalls.”\n\nDavid Mickey Evans directed the cult classic, which is rated PG. You can watch The Sandlot on Disney+, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n12. The Outsiders (1983)\n\nA cast bursting with stars (including Matt Damon, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, Tom Cruise, just to name a few) is directed by an equally famous director, Francis Ford Coppola. The film follows members of the Greasers, a clique whose feud with the popular Socials becomes deadly in the 1960s.\n\nThe movie spawned the famous phrase “stay gold,” and it’s based on the YA classic novel by S.E. Hinton. You can watch The Outsiders on Philo, YouTube, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n11. Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret (2023)\n\nThe classic Judy Blume novel finally received the adaptation it deserved with this sterling version from director Kelly Fremon Craig. Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) navigates the perils of a changing body, a growing confusion over identity and, well, boys with the help of her family (including Rachel McAdams as her mom).\n\nThe PG-13 film memorably echoes Blume’s famous line, “We must, we must, we must increase our bust.” You can watch Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret on Hulu, Roku Channel, Sling TV, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n10. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)\n\nThe entire Harry Potter series is a coming-of-age saga, but perhaps nowhere do Harry’s emotions and frustration boil quite so close to the surface as in the fifth movie, as he and his friends prepare secretly for the coming battle between good and evil at Hogwarts.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman and Rupert Grint star in the David Yates-directed film, which is rated PG-13. You watch Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on Max, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n9. Skater Girl (2021)\n\nYou may know of Bend It Like Beckham, a superlative coming-of-age-film about soccer player and her disapproving parents, but have you heard of this equally appealing sports movie? It follows an Indian girl who discovers a passion and talent for skateboarding, which goes against her tradition-bound family.\n\nManjari Makijany directed, co-produced and co-wrote the film, which has an 89% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. You can watch Skater Girl on Netflix.\n\n8. The Virgin Suicides (1999)\n\nFive sisters (played by actresses including Kirsten Dunst and A.J. Cook) become the object of obsession of teenage boys around their neighborhood, who wonder over their sad fates.

Now and Then (1995)\n\nIn this flashback, flash-forward film, a foursome of 12-year-old girls share a memorable summer, then reunite decades later when one of them is expecting their first child. The movie’s many stars include Christina Ricci, Thora Birch, Moore, Rosie O’Donnell and Melanie Griffith.\n\nLesli Linka Glatter directed the PG-13 film, which has become a cult classic after being a critical flop. You can watch Now and Then on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n5. Love and Basketball (2000)\n\nThe quintessential coming-of-age romance features Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps as next-door neighbors and star-crossed lovers whose relationship both depends on and transcends basketball, which they both play with a passion. The movie follows their ups and downs from high school and beyond.\n\nGina Prince-Bythewood directed the cult-classic PG-13 film. You can watch Love and Basketball on Hulu, Sling, Paramount+, Roku Channel, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n4. Clueless (1995)\n\nBased on Jane Austen’s Emma, Clueless follows Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and her well-off Beverly Hills friends as they break up, make up and learn the true meaning of love.

Moonlight (2016)\n\nBarry Jenkins’ film shines a light on three critical periods in the life of Chiron, a Black, queer boy whose mother shames him for his sexuality. Chiron finds an unexpected mentor in Juan (Mahershala Ali, who won an Oscar for the role) and gains the support of his community.\n\nMoonlight won Best Picture at the 89th Academy Awards—a memorable moment as the trophy was first (mistakenly) awarded to the heavily favored La La Land. You can watch Moonlight on Max, Hulu, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, AppleTV+ and Vudu.\n\n2. Sixteen Candles (1984)\n\nFrom “What’s happening, hot stuff?” to “Yeah, you,” John Hughes’ Sixteen Candles had the line on catchphrases from the early ‘80s. It tells the story of Sam (Molly Ringwald), whose family forgets her 16th birthday amid the hoopla of her sister’s wedding.\n\nSam pines for a cute boy who ignores her, loses her underwear to a geek, and eventually gets the guy. The movie features many of the ‘80s’ most popular teen actors, including Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall and John Cusack. You can watch Sixteen Candles on Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, Google Play Movies & TV and Apple TV+.\n\n1. Boyz N the Hood (1991)\n\nJohn Singleton’s masterpiece dramatizes the forces pulling a young Black man in different directions in a neighborhood where gangs and drugs rule. Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) tries to live by the strict rules set by his father (Laurence Fishburne), but he’s tempted by the streets and friends Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky (Morris Chestnut).\n\nThe all-star cast delivers all-time great performances (watch for a young Regina King too). The drama was a commercial and a critical hit, earning a then-24-year-old Singleton the first-ever Oscar nomination for a Black director. He was also the youngest person ever nominated in the category. You can watch Boyz N the Hood on Netflix, Sling TV, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, Google Play Movies & TV and Apple TV+.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe top coming-of-age movies teach the main character a lesson and may have viewers reflecting on their own lives, too. You can laugh and cry at these films. The classics stand the test of time, and the new ones put a fresh twist on an enduring genre."
