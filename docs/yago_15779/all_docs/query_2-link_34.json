It is rated R for strong language.\n\nThe plot: Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk), a 16-year-old Dominican boy growing up on New York’s Lower East Side, finds his self-image as a burgeoning ladies man deflated when the neighborhood finds out that he’s dating an unpopular and overweight girl (Donna Maldonado) who lives two stories above his grandmother’s apartment, where he lives, along with his brother and sister. So, he sets his sights on the most beautiful girl at the local swimming pool, “Juicy” Judy Rodriguez (Judy Marte)."
