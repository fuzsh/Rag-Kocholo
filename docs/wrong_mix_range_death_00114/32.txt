CLARKSTON - In 2016, Charles Mingus known as Chuck was killed while crossing the street in his motorized-scooter by a drunk driver. His family and community leaders gathered in his remembrance and unveiled his memorial on Tuesday.

A new memorial in Clarkston and a symbol to remind people to not drink and drive. Since his death, Chuck's family has been working to ensure he didn't die in vain.

For the past year, they've been teaming up with Washington State Department of Transportation, Roadside Memorial Sign Program, to place a Driving Under the Influence (DUI) sign on 6th and Chestnut.

Community leaders came together for the unveiling of these two signs, which they hope can be life-saving.

Both signs read, ‘IN MEMORY OF Chuck Mingus, PLEASE DON’T DRINK AND DRIVE,’ as a reminder to those who pass by.

Several speeches were given to address the importance to drive safe and sober.

Chuck's grandson shared how much it meant to him and his family. He's hoping the message means something to others too.

"Even if they didn’t know him, I am sure they have known somebody or have heard stories of somebody who has died in that fashion,” Mr. Woltering said. “It might open their eyes a little bit to, maybe, how we can do things a little better."

Mr. Mingus was a Clarkston local for more than 30 years. Woltering says about 10 of Chuck's children and grandchildren showed up to the unveiling. They are thankful to the city officials for making the signs and ceremony possible.

The signs are located at Chestnut and 6th Street in Clarkston.
