This transcript may contain errors.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nSo here's the big question,\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nHow are entrepreneurs like us? We've been hustling and struggling to make it to success who seem to make it\n\nOne step forward, two steps back, work dedicated to turning. And Dreft. How do we finally break through? That is the question. This podcast will give. My name is Bob. This is the mind body.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome, welcome,\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nWelcome\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nTo the Mind Body Business Show. Oh, my goodness, we bring the most amazing people to you so you can listen to and learn from their genius. And tonight is no exception. Latricia Grant Mingus's here with us. She is waiting, just chomping at the bit to get up here on stage and share her brilliance with you. And I can't wait to share her with you as well. What an amazing, amazing young woman she is from so many aspects. And we'll get into the details of her incredible integrity and character and her love for people and helping and her incredible intelligence and experience that she brings for you tonight right here on the mind body business. I cannot wait. She's coming to the mind. Body Business Show is a show we had developed with you in mind. It's a show by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs. The sole purpose and mission of the show is to help you, the audience member, the person watching or listening on podcasts. To give you the tools you need to become more successful more quickly, that's what we all want, is more rapid results and we want but results that don't come at any cost of our integrity or character. Very clear about that. And that's what happens. I bring on guest after guest, successful person after successful person like Patricia, and each and every time they give their wisdom, their value, their golden nuggets. So I implore of you to take notes through this, because when they talk, take notes and then take action when the show's over and go back over your notes. This is like a free seminar every single week. This week is special. We're doing two shows this week.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWe normally do one because we have a special guest this. Latricia, come on now. All right. And one of the things I found in my now many years on this planet, I'll be fifty seven real soon. I just said that out loud. That is crazy. Hard to believe. It's awesome, though. Every year is a victory. About the last decade or so, I just began studying only successful people and wondered what made them perhaps more successful than someone like me. I mean, do they not put their pants on one leg at a time after a man like or do they run and jump and land on them and they have superpowers? What is it that they do and why are they more successful? In that study? I learned and found three things that kept bubbling to the top each and every time to a person, these very successful people, they had these three key components and they are the very name of the show mind being that they have a very positive and even more importantly, very flexible mindset. Body is all about taking care of one's own body through nutrition, through exercise. And then business is multi multifaceted. There's things like sales, marketing, team building, leadership, systematizing. I could go on a long time. And what these successful individuals had done that I studied is they hadn't mastered the skill sets required to build a successful and thriving business and to grow it. And all those skill sets were part of that. The good news is you look, if you're going to master any one thing we all know, it takes a long time. If you want if you want to be an expert, I think the sweet number is something like ten thousand hours that you're doing it before you can call yourself an expert.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWell, who's got ten thousand hours times the multitude of those skill sets that are needed to master for a business. Not many of us. So the good news is if you master just one of them and I mentioned it, it's one of those that I mentioned, if you master just one of those and the rest will fall into place. And that one skill set is the skill set of leadership. And once you mastered that, you can then bring in those who have mastered those skill sets that you have yet to master and may never master, to be honest. And they can then take and fill those gaps for you and your business. So that is that that is what the mind body business is all about, is about what makes people successful, eliciting that from my guests who will then gladly and graciously give out their, quote, unquote, secrets to success. And just to hint at there's really no secret and you'll learn. You'll learn as we go through this, the more shows you watch. Patricia, I'm sure, will give you every bit of advice and secret you need to know to crush it without watching another single show. And that's just the way she rolls. She's amazing. And another wonderful, wonderful thing about very successful people. Don't worry, Latricia's coming on very, very soon is that to a person, they are also very voracious readers of books. And with that, I like to segue into a segment I affectionately call bookmarks.\n\nSpeaker3:\n\nBookmarks, Hornsey, read bookmarks, ready, steady, read bookmarks brought to you by Reach Your Peak Library Dotcom.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThere you see it, reach our library dot com, a word of advice to everyone watching and or listening is to write that down. And not just that, but any resource that moves more more than myself that Latricia gives you tonight, write it down instead of clicking on a tab and going off and searching and looking. Because when you take your gaze away, your eyes go to a different place, your attention goes with it. And I would just so, so hate for you to miss that golden nugget that Latricia is about to drop that could change your life for better, for forever. And so this is the advice I give each and every show I do this from stage is keep your your gaze and your attention span with us. Take notes, write down the websites, write down the resources, write down the book titles and all those things, and then later you can go back to them. But keep your gaze here, because Latricia's coming on here in just a couple of minutes. Once I get thrown gabbing about all this great stuff. Reach your peak library is literally a resource that I had built with you in mind. It is here because I myself was not a voracious reader until about ten years ago. And then I learned, oh my goodness, this is the most transforming thing you could do in your life. And it doesn't come at a great cost. So I put this together.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWhat it is, is a library of books that I personally read that had profound impact either on my business or my personal life or both. And you can see as we scroll down and show you this on screen, as we do this live on video, that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that these books are listed at all. They're not alphabetically are not in order of how much profound impact they had on my life. I just dropped them and had them put in here the moment I finished reading them and just said, put them in there. I don't care what order. So this is here for you to just find out one book that jumps off the page that you haven't read and just click the button and get it. This is not, I repeat, not a money making website. Persay. Oh, my goodness. If you've ever tried selling books, you'll know that there's very little margin. This isn't the reason. The reason is not for making money is to provide you with a valuable resource that I never had when I started reading. I just got great advice by great mentors on what books to read and kept following along with that. Speaking of following, along with that, it's time to follow into our next segment. What do you say we bring on the amazing Latricia Grand Mangoush right now? Let's do it.\n\nSpeaker3:\n\nIt's time for the guest expert spotlight. Savvy, skillful, professional, adept, trained, legally qualified.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd there she is, ladies and gentlemen, it is the one, the only Latricia Grande Mingus,\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nYou are on live from Las Vegas,\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nNevada, live from Las Vegas.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nLove it real quick, I promise. We're going to get to you in just a second. But real quick, some housekeeping. Got to pay the bill, so to speak, and bring up our sponsor. And you see that nice big red circle above Latricia's left shoulder to the right of your screen. If you're watching this video, either live or recording, that is the big insider secrets. That is. Jason Nasty is the president and founder of that company. And because of him and his company, we get to offer you a chance at a five night vacation, stay at a five\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nStar luxury resort.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd again, compliments of the big insider secrets. So thank you, Jason, for that. We will give you the exact method for entering to win that here toward the end. So you must stay with us till the end and you must be watching live in order to enter. So those are the only two rules there. And we have a couple more. And then we'll get to this amazing young woman here and have a great show. If you're struggling with putting a live show together and it's overwhelming and you want a lot of the processes done for you while still enabling you to put on a high quality show and connect with great people like Latricia Granicus and grow your business all at the same time, then head on over to carpet bomb marketing, dotcom. Carpet bomb marketing saturate the marketplace with your message and one of the key components that is contained in the carpet bomb marketing courses, this is one that you will learn how to absolutely master is the very service we use to stream our live shows right here on the mind body business. Jopek, we're doing it right now.

Our Whippy that I am Fortgang Stream live one more time. Our Web imports live stream live. And now at last, we are going to give Patricia the introduction she so richly deserves. Latricia Grandma Mingus is the CEO and co-founder of Grand Mingus Entertainment Group. Right on cue, radio ad promotions and marketing company and online radio station located in, you guessed it, Las Vegas, Nevada for twenty five years. There's no way she could have this experience. She can't be that old. Latricia developed significant experience in the Areas of Business Administration program and project management instructor led training, virtual instructor led training, business analytics, strategic planning and implementation. She knows business information technology and customer service. Latricia is a wife, mother of four amazing adult children. Yes, I have two of those persistent entrepreneur life coach in No Fear coaching since twenty ten and a host of live talks, a daily talk talk show currently broadcasting on where else, but right on to radio her radio network.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nWith that, you deserve a round of applause.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nOh man. I need to go work out some more. I'm out of breath already. How are you doing this evening, Latricia? Welcome to the show.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nI am. Well, Brian, thank you so much. I truly appreciate this opportunity. I'm very honored\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThe honor is mine. And that is because I got to know you. And we didn't talk that long. It just that was like this synergy, this connection. And what came out to me was you choose with integrity and character.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nJust thank you.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nIt just comes out of your pores and yeah, you're just an amazing individual. And I loved when we were talking what you you said your mission, your purpose was and what you and your husband are embarking on. And we'll get into that definitely deeper as the show progresses. I cannot wait for everyone else to hear this. And you just come off as you've got it all at the heart. You've got the experience. You've definitely got the smarts and knowhow. You've got the full package and you've got a supporting husband that you're both in this business together. That's that's game changing right there. I have a spouse that supports and vice versa. So, so many things about you impressed me, Latricia. And I'm so, so glad that you took the time out of your busy schedule to come on and be here with us tonight.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nIt is my pleasure. And again, it's my honor. And I have to say, I just could not have asked for a better intro. I don't think I've ever been introduced in that manner. So thank you so much. And I'm so happy to be here. I'm just very excited to be here.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nIt's going to be a lot of fun, what I like to do is find out so we know that you are very adept at business. I mean, the opening bio says a lot, and I love that it gives everyone an idea that, well, Latricia is real. She's not a tire kicker. She's not a wannabe person. Right. But one thing I like to do is kind of go in a little deeper, a little deeper. And what that means is in order for anyone to achieve success, something has to be going on correctly between those two ears. And for you, what I wanted to find out, like every day, you know, being an entrepreneur, it's super, super simple. We never have issues. It's just like an easy life right now. Could be farther from the truth. So knowing that every day you're going to be faced with a new task, a new a new challenge, what is going on inside of that wonderful, beautiful brain of yours when you get up in the morning and you're about to take on the day, what is going on with your mindset? What are you going through? What are you doing on a daily basis that keeps you going through all of the arduous task and all the challenges that hit you every single day to keep moving forward for you? What is that?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nFor me, it is the time that I take in prayer. It is my prayer time if I don't start my day with my prayer time, it is a hot mess. Oh, for the rest of the day it is. It's my prayer time. And just taking the time to be thankful. You understand, it's not about asking for a bunch of things, because as you stated, when you wake up in the morning, the motor is already running. So to put all of that on pause and just to say thank you for opening my eyes today. Thank you. That I have breath. Thank you. That I made it through the night. Thank you for just giving me another chance to get it right that for me, since the day I can do everything after I've had that moment in prayer. Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd we were talking a little bit before the show, we I think we share a belief system in that area and I couldn't be more agreeable, even if folks aren't a believer like it's a it's what a lot of people call an attitude of gratitude. It doesn't matter what your belief system is. You can all do this by going through. And just what are you grateful for? And there's great ways to do exercise exercises that they seem kind of corny that you're out driving and say, well, I'm grateful that I can see what's right and I'm grateful I can see this dreary sky. Even if it's raining. I'm grateful. I can feel this water that you just got. There's so many things to be grateful for. And when you start your day out like that. So you're listening to. The recipe for. What a recipe, what, Latricia, if you ever have your big the cake.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nYeah, I'm not a baker. I'll cook. I'm not a baker.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nBut if you get\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nA recipe for a cake, could you do you think you could figure it out? Like, go get the ingredients. It says to get the sugar, the flour, the whatever. They put it in eggs and then and then follow directions, mixing a bowl, slapping a pan, throw it in the oven. If you preheated to whatever, you could probably make a pretty darn good cake if you had a good recipe, right? Absolutely. And so with our ship or business or success in life, there's really no difference. Just you have a recipe. You just heard it. All you have to do is follow it. Like I said, it's not it's not rocket science. There's no big secret. It's just knowing the things that successful people do and you just model them. Go ahead. You had something to say.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nLook, I was going to say the the attitude of gratitude is not something that I've always made a major part of my day. It really took for me to go through some stuff. First, we get mired down in all of the happenings of life. We become very frustrated or irritated. Sometimes it even goes farther than that, depressed and all of that. And I had to go through a very difficult season in my life where. It took everything that I had just to say, OK, there's got to be something about this life that is still worth living, and that's where the attitude of gratitude started kicking in because like, listen, you know, whether you are currently an entrepreneur, whether you are working for another company, whatever it is, you've got to start that day remembering that there's so much more going on than just that job or that business that you have. And you've got to be thankful for just being able to play the game. You know, that's what it is for me. I had to go through some stuff, Bryan.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nOk.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nIt's interesting that often that seems to be the case, isn't it, that a lot of times we need to go through some kind of trial in order to come out on the other side of it lights a different fire under our butts. It changes our course. And oftentimes it's looking back. I can see why that happened.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nRight.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThat was allowed to occur in my life. OK, I got it at the time, though. You're gone.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nOh, my God.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWhat is this all about? So just stay the course and follow what Latricia's says. Pray in the beginning in the morning. Start your day with prayer.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nAnd one other thing to. We are so trained to wonder why me, why is this happening to me, I started to flip that question to why not me? When you change how you look at that, why not me? Doesn't matter how dire the circumstances are. Why not? Why shouldn't I be the one going through this? Why should it be someone else? Because once we get our minds into alignment with that. Our decision making process then shifts from being a victim to being a problem solver. Resolution Vinther, why not me? I obviously have something in me that can handle whatever this is and guess what? You've been through some things before, so I'm absolutely certain that you've got some tools now to make it through whatever this is, business or otherwise.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nAnd for me, it's coming,\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nIt's right, knowledge bomb, smart bombs, bombs of wisdom, all from Latricia grinding those listen up mindset is one of the key components of success and Latricia is giving them right now. So be sure to write this down and follow this and get in the habit of it, especially the attitude of gratitude that is such an easy thing to form a habit for. Just you don't have to write a list. Just put a reminder gratitude and you get up and do it for, I don't know, a few minutes, start off slow and then go to five to 10, however long it takes for you to start rewiring your brain for better. And that's what I'm telling you. After I was about forty seven, Latricia, when I finally realized I had no idea that everything my place in life might be, their level of success or lack thereof had nothing to do with any outside forces. It was what was going on in the training. Once I realized that I started doing work on that.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nWow, absolutely.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd I never would have met like you had that not happened.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nAnd I could say vice versa.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThat all seriousness, that wouldn't have happened because just everything I learned something called NLP neurolinguistic programing and at a deep level taught it from stage. And just it was a life changer. It's a science. It's not. Woohoo! I know. I used to be like that aleatoric feels\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nLike right now.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd then after I learned it at a deep level is that you can't you can't take my face.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nThat was the main reason.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nSo fantastic. All right. We got a couple of things going on that I need to take care of. Apparently, we're having some connectivity issues. There's one. All right, where we connected so weak. That was nice and easy. So you have done a lot in your short time on this planet. The Bible was reflective of that. Now, if you were able to rewind and go take a step back into the younger Latricia and you knew what you knew today. What would you have done differently, if anything, going back to say when you first began making those career decisions earlier on in your life?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nI would have become an entrepreneur straight out of high school.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nYes, yes,\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nThat's the change I would have made, I want to skip all of the jobs that you weren't happy with and all of the shenanigans and office politics and I would have just gone for my own space. Pretty much that's and what I realized is in being an entrepreneur. I just happened to pretty much what I've always sort of done in my mind, set my thought processes, it's all pretty much been the same for as long as I can remember. It's great being older and wiser and having the tools to properly apply, but I think the trial and error would have been well worth it.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWell, it's interesting, I have similar thoughts, I came from the corporate world myself as well, and, you know, I totally get it. The hijinx and the everything. But I also and I know you needed to talk a lot from experience wise to inject into my current business. And the thing is, you learn what you don't like as an experience. You learn in a meeting, make you just.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nWell, you're right.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nIt's like you learn a lot of good things to good or how important it is to document your systems. And that doesn't mean in the paper anymore. You can record video. This is what I do all the time, record the screen and talk or have my team do it. So I got a lot of good stuff from it and I just hang my hat on that because the bad was what I felt. That from you is the same as\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nI\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nFelt the same way when you said I was just like, yeah,\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nThere's a reason we work for ourselves.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd it's interesting. It's like I don't look and I know you don't do this either, but I don't look back and go, oh, man, or at all time. It wasn't a waste at all because you and I both got a great life experience.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nYes, indeed.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd we learned what to go away from that we didn't like what you is just as important as what to go toward. Personally, I'm not going to cry in my milk, and I know you won't either. As I say, some of them\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nAbsolute over spilled milk, whatever it is, cry in your beer, whatever it is.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nOh, yes. All right. Fantastic. So do you ever have, like, alone or downtime where you're able to kind of recharge and just sit back and do stuff that you want to do? I mean, in addition to your business, we all as entrepreneurs, we do it because we love it. Do you have anything you do outside of the business that you enjoy, that you carve time out for like a hobby or things that you enjoy doing?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nWell, for me, outside of Grand Entertainment Group, right on cue, radio is my other love, which is the if you're coaching, that is my hobby. That is my love. I truly believe that my station in life is to assist others in transitioning from one state of being into the next and for it to be to help them progress from that place of feeling stuck, that place of feeling uninspired, that place of feeling helpless to that space of strength and just being able to say, hey, I may not have it all together, but I know I can make it. That to me is my goal to it's what I love.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nNever is a business, I love it.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nMy hobby is a business, right? I mean, I do. I enjoy singing and cooking and that type of stuff. But I don't there aren't hobbies that I would stop and cook. I do love to travel. I will say that I do love to travel.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nYeah, well, we have so many things in common, literature. I mean, people ask me that question, too. What was the last time you went golfing? I said, I don't know, but I don't care\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nWho's\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nDoing what I like doing right now. I'm enjoying it. And I love to travel to my wife and I would love to travel. We go on a smooth jazz cruise whenever we can rise several times. Oh, my goodness. That is off the charts. Yeah. And due to recent events, we're not going to be able to make this one that's coming up. But one will be\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nThe next one.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAbsolutely. And it's just being with the one you love more than anything on the planet that's stuck in that fulfilling. And when you're coaching that one person and you get to that point where they have just hit that unsteadiness, where it's probably step wise and they're getting to the crescendo. But when you start to see the improvement because of things you've helped them do, is that gratifying?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nOh, my goodness. For me, I literally feel like I'm going to just get out in the street and dance because I remember being there myself. And it was someone who did a group coaching in a training program that I belong to at the time. And boy, once those lights started going off, I said, OK, this is what I'm meant to be doing here.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd here's what I love about that you took a negative experience that occurred to you. And you turn it into a positive. That's the beauty of going through trials to see what the reason was for you. Yes, I put you through that or allowed you to go through that so that you could now help people because you aren't the only one. We all don't feel like when you're going through it. You are the only one on the planet that's ever existed. Yeah, it's\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nSomething. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd just knowing that other people I mean, just not long, when you tell somebody you're not alone and I know X, Y, Z person is doing the same thing like, huh, I feel better already. I'm not all the way there, but that certainly helps. Have you ever noticed?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. And I'm not afraid to to share some of the tidbits of my personal journey when I coach people, because people want to know, first of all, that they're not alone, but they also want to know they can trust what you're telling them. I'm not an expert, but I know what I know. And I just aligned my training with my life experience to give it the double whammy. So I'm not ashamed to say I've been where you are and I can't experience it as you do, but I know how I felt when I went through that. So, yes.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd for folks watching and listening to this, this what she just said applies to business in general in all facets, is being authentic and having some level of transparency. Look, you don't have to give away everything about your open up that closet and reveal all\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nYou\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nCan. Be transparent and let people know you're human and do it authentically, not just to do it, but just as part of what you like to do. Then people will relate to you. People will be more apt to do business with you, to talk to you. It's like an open and door, like, wow, well, you're not superwoman. Your normal is superwoman behind the scenes.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nBut you see that your\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nHusband was throwing up behind you right before the show,\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nFluffing the caper with a\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nLittle press. Those little crease in there, little\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nBoy,\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nTo show others you are you you have struggles. I mean, look, we go on Facebook and always is. Oh, look, I'm a\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nVacation and\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI'm drinking this exotic cocktail. And life is and there are no problems. And we're looking at this. Most of our lives are gone. I think the way it works with me is, well, I guarantee you they got stuff going on. Everyone to everyone,\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nEvery person now. No, I don't just magically snap my fingers and both legs are in the pants. I've got to put them on one at a time like everyone else.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nYou just do it quicker and more efficiently.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nSome days. Some days, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nSome days.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI mean, these days we don't even need pants.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nWell, because we're all from here to here. There you go.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI mean, if we're being authentic and transparent, I'm literally wearing workout shorts at this rate.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nI have leggings.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI've done well before college. I've always done this. It's just comfortable. I'm barefoot. My feet are on a earthing pad. I'm just enjoying and relax. I got air conditioning gone. But the appearance is professional because I'm here to not just represent myself, but also you, Latricia. And that means a lot to me. And but I can be transparent, tell people I'm in workout shorts while I'm doing this. That's fine. I don't mind if people know it. I learned that from a guy who this is going a long way back. All those talk show to awards like Arsenio Hall. There were several others. Dennis Miller had his on his show. I had a buddy who was asked to come on as a lookalike. This guy had the chin of Jay Leno, I'm telling you, my buddy, that look just like him. So he had a Letterman look alike, a Leno look alike and all these things. And when the guy came back, my friend, I asked him about his experience because the one thing that stuck out with him was Dennis Miller during the shoot in a studio was wearing like a\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nGodfather\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nSuit. Right. Things in his cheeks. He said when he got up, he was wearing shorts right now.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nOh, a great idea.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI'm going to start doing that with my live shows. It doesn't matter. People can't see.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nNo one can see. Just don't stand. Just don't stand up. You'll be all right. Somebody, I think on CNN got in trouble for that one or something happened. I don't remember. But yeah, it's got to be careful. These people get in trouble\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nA little more than most. What I would love to give you a standing ovation, Latricia, but out of respect for you, I won't let this comment. I'll put on pants and do that then,\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nEnd\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nQuote. This is going down bad. All right. I do want to bring up your business. I'm very intrigued by what you and your husband have put together on on many fronts. Maybe we start with the entertainment side of the house with your network and what is your mission together with you and your husband for this network and what are you looking to achieve?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nSo dreaminess entertainment group right on cue. Radio is the brainchild of my husband, who is the grandchild of Charles Mingus. And I don't know if you're familiar with jazz, but he was a world famous composer and my husband is his, I believe, his oldest grandson. And so in the early 90s, he got into the entertainment industry and just felt like something wasn't quite right. So he backed off and just continued on with his aspirations, with his craft and his gift. But he wanted to find a way to help artists who were up and coming that maybe felt like him in terms of being involved with the mainstream industry. So he started his cued up showcases where he would just produce shows for them to perform flash back many, many, many years later. He and I met and he asked me to come on board and help him. So Grambling's entertainment group, right on cue radio was born. And our specific focus is to provide a safe, loving promotions and marketing platform for up and coming undiscovered entertainers. That is what we do right on cue. Radio features the music of up and coming artists. We play little to no mainstream music, so every song that we play on our network comes from an up and coming entertainer. We play music of all genres. We get music from all around the world. We just got something from South Africa last week and DJ's Sweden. We've gotten music from the UK, from Ghana, from New Zealand and all around the United States. So we are so proud. Our little little engine that could definitely has we are broadcasting to just over 90 countries at this time.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWow. Wow. Is that Internet based terrestrial?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nBoth It's Internet.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThat's the way to go to it that way. And what I love about it is you're giving the quote unquote, little guy, little girl the ability, the opportunity to showcase their talent is all the music. Are they all original pieces or can they cover for other well-known talent as well?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nAll the music we get we do have a few cover songs, but the majority of the music is original content. Wow.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWow, so you're showcasing also not just their vocal and maybe instrumental talent, but also their writing skills as well?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nExactly, exactly. Yes, it's exciting.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWhat's that? Oh, there's there's a show that came on recently that we love song song.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nI think I've heard of it. I don't do a whole lot of TV. So we run running off of the TV shows. I may not be able to keep up with you. This is what we do all day, every day.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nSo but it's similar in that it's a competition type thing, but it's writers of music who come on and perform their own pieces. It's mind blowing because their talent is they should be the one headlining the song on Scott. And they just it's really cool. So I love what you're doing. You're giving people an avenue, a channel. And so for everyone watching right now, whether it's ever recorded or if you're listening to a podcast, if either you have talent and please make sure you've got someone else to tell you you have talent\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nTo send\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nIt anyway. Send it anyway. We take it all. It doesn't necessarily mean it'll all get on the air, but it doesn't matter because there's probably someone looking for exactly what you do.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nOh, I love it. And so what would be the best way for them to get their their work to you?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nWe have a dedicated email address. It's EPK submissions. Aggressing is dot com. So it's E for electronic press kit. So if you're familiar with what that is, it's just epic submissions at Grand Mingus Dotcom. And and we'll take a look at it. We're asking that you send it in three format because that's what our system plays sometimes and before work. But really, MP three is our our go to. And if you can send us your artist name, a brief bio and maybe a picture or two, because in addition to loading your music into our playlist, we also provide promotion's services through our social media. So we're going to create fliers for you and just let people know who you are and all of that. We do have pay packages as well. So if you want a little bit more, then you can certainly visit our website and sign up for one of the packages. But just to get your music in the queue, it's EPK submission, the electronic press kit submissions at Grand Mangus Dotcom.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThat's fantastic. Cool, so there you have it, if you are either you have talent or, you know, somebody else who's looking to get their music heard, then definitely just steer them to the show and have them watch it and they'll get the information. The cool thing about coming to the show to get the information is you get to meet and get to know this amazing young woman and realize that what their interests are, they have your interests at heart. They're looking to help people. That is what drives both Patricia and her husband. Yes. Can we see your husband's name on the air?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nYes, Gran Mingus. He just goes by Gran Mingus.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI remember a different name that I got wrong the way I pronounce that eau de.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nYou know what? Listen, I'm not going to get the cold shoulder after I finish this interview. We're going to leave it with Graham Mingus left to give his government name. He can do that on another time.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nCool. Because I wasn't going to say it and get it wrong again, because I respect.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nOh, no, it's OK. It's a subprime.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd so, in addition to that, you do you have several things going on. And I wanted to also touch base on another thing you're doing as far as you are putting in as part of a package for businesses. This is for both businesses, as I understand it, and for entertainers to help promote either or both cases. So if you're an entertainer, you need to promote yourself and your your talent or your band, whatever you have, or if you're a business and you need both, they're both businesses. Let's just get that straight. That's right.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nMusic is a business.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nYou offer packages for folks. And as part of those packages, you've thrown in a nice little twist. I was just going to leave that to you to say that because I think this is genius is wonderful what you guys are doing.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nSo for every package that you purchase, a portion of the proceeds goes to help us feed families as grand as entertainment group right on cue radio, we decided early on that people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. And so we have as a business, we have our acts of kindness every day initiative. And the first campaign under that is our Feed the Families campaign. So we decided to start small. We are assisting in partnership with the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. So when you purchase one of your sponsorship packages or an artist promotions package, partial proceeds will go to help us put together packages that we then present to some of the families that are being serviced by the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThat is awesome, and what I love is that it's built into your business model. It's not like an additional so if you want to also contribute, but it's part of it. So just by doing business with you guys, they're are making a difference and and you are making a difference. And thank you for both you and your husband's heart for putting something like that together. Like you said, you're starting out small. Here's the thing I love to say for especially it's almost every guest has been on my show, probably everyone. But what I what I wish for you and your husband is that you get blessed with an abundance of wealth. And the reason is because it's pretty conceivable that what you and your husband will do with additional money is scale and change more lives.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nIt's so apparent that that's what drives you to. And so I hope that you are just blessed with shower, showering from the heavens, lots and lots of wealth so that you can spread what you're doing and help more families, help more organizations. Wow. That hit me. That tugged at the heart strings of child cancer or childhood cancer. That's oh, I can't imagine being a parent and going through something like that.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nWe my husband, a very good friend of his, lost his battle a few years back. And so we you know, it's just something that, listen, we all have lost a loved one to one thing or another. So we've got to start somewhere. But we just felt like, wow, you know, especially this particular organization, because a lot of the larger organizations get more of the attention. They get more of the donations. So they are not as big as some of the others, like St. Jude's and and Susan G. Komen and all those national organizations. They're pretty vocal. So we wanted to make sure we did our part to help out. And we and you're absolutely right. Our our our acts of kindness every day initiative, we plan to expand that. We have already drafted our programs to help our our seniors, to help our veterans, to help the people that are coming out of abusive relationships and things of that nature. So we have an entire plan. It's just we had to start somewhere. So who we wanted to start with the kiddo's.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI mean, you could have started with any one of those, and it's the right answer, doesn't matter which, when you start with this, the fact that you started and that's the message that I would like to impart upon everyone who might be thinking, well, I got five of them and I just can't get started. I don't know which one to go with. Pick one just to draw it out of a hat.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nRight, exactly.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nBecause you wouldn't be even considering doing it unless it made an impact. Absolutely. Grab one and go take action. So you're big into helping others to promote get their name, their likeness, their brand, their image, their company, what have you out there for the world to see so that their business can thrive. And one of my favorite questions that I get to ask on this show is around. That is, what is your and your husband's what I call a sweet spot today? What is working for you right now? Because let's face it, it doesn't talk about marketing. Marketing. What used to work ten years ago doesn't always work today. And what's working today may not be working very well ten years from now. And it's always about what is working now when it comes to marketing, because it just it's a moving target for you and your business together. What have you found lately? The latest best form of marketing that has worked for your business and more importantly, for your clients to get them the exposure and everything they're looking for that you guys offer?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nIt's actually one of the oldest ways of marketing. It's just our street team promotions, person to person interactions. Hi, how you doing? My name is Patricia with Grambling's entertainment group. This is what we do. You have a business we'd love to help. Or hey, we have a client, Brian Kelly, who's looking to increase his presence online. We would love for you to check out his show. Here's an invitation to one of his live interviews shows. Yeah, and that and it works, it's been working for my husband for the better part of 30 years, and it still works just as well. Now, even in the time of all of the cool stuff and everything else, it still works.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAmazing, isn't it? And that magical word, I think, called relationships.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI used to avoid that like the plague because I'm an automation freak. I love\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nTo do\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nBig things with you know, I build something once and it can repeatedly do big things.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nI love it\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nA lot more people. But the thing I found was automation by itself. It doesn't go anywhere. It's very difficult because especially today, relationships now are more important than ever they've always been. That's like one of the common threads through all of time when it comes to marketing. And what works is relationship building. I don't think I ever did not work right. People don't like to hear about it, me included, at the time,\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nBecause it's\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nOne at a time relation that takes that four letter word called Time to establish. And we have an instant gratification society, whether you're in the US or anywhere we can. I mean, goodness sakes, I order something on Amazon. A ding dong is practically I barely touch the button. And so we get used to that and we expect it. And then when it comes to business, we're in the same boat and it's like this I working. So I got to go on to something, just keep moving. But that's\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nSo that's one thing I can certainly say is this. There is a concept that they talk about in the Bible, but if you are a farmer, you're going to understand this. It's called the principle of seed time and harvest. So you plant those seeds, you get out, you meet the person hand to hand, you give it a little time, you're going to reap the harvest. And guess what? You never just get one stock of corn. You know, you never just get one push of whatever flowers you're going to get many. So what happens is when you're when you're building that rapport with someone face to face, they're going to go and tell people, we met that wonderful young man and he was just awesome. He made us laugh. And you should check him out, see, so they don't just come back on their own. They come back with about four or five others. So it's it's very effective.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nPlanting seeds, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nAs we plant some bombs, some of\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThose seeds into what those bombs, because that is so true, all of the networking events and seminars and boot camps and all those things I went to, I made so many amazing connections and I could look back and think of several that happened seven or eight years ago that fast forward to like a year ago I was making million dollar contracts with that person because you said the word, the magic word. It's relationships. It's building rapport, establishing rapport with an individual. And you're right. You know, I this I met this gentleman a long time ago and just by happenstance ran into him again. Guess where in Las Vegas.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nWow.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nSeminar. And I was like, oh, my God, I know. And I love this guy. And we just struck up a conversation. He then realized I was doing the show. One thing led to another. And it was just an amazing thing, all because of what Latricia's just told you. Another secret to success is, you know, we're not looking here to go make a quick kill on fast cash and then run with it. We're looking at establishing a lifelong long term business that can keep going. I'm sure, Latricia, you and your husband want to keep a legacy long.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nYes. Yes, indeed.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd that can't be established if you're going after the quick kill. It has to be a long term nurtured relationship, that relationship build the business foundation culture of the business, and then you can pass it on to maybe one of your adult children if they're open to it, or someone else who's ready to take the reins. When that time comes, your legacy will have been firmly planted because you guys did what it took to make sure this thing lasted.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nAbsolutely. And the interesting thing about it is my youngest son, William, who's also an entertainer with music that we play on the network, he is working with us and learning the ropes. So you're absolutely correct. We're building that legacy team.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nThat's going to be so fulfilling, I mean, Germany, Christmas, that would be so much I'm a big family guy and to be able to do that and have everyone kind of involved, even if I can imagine, you guys didn't push him into it. He just said, I want to do it. I can just I think, Latricia, where we separated at birth, are we just identical twins? The resemblance is uncanny already.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nThey're like this.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nYou're like my sister from another Mr.. There you\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nGo. And that's\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nBefore. That's right. I'll take\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nIt.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd we are the weight based on our belief system. We are brother and sister. And let's just let's everyone out there just get over this ridiculousness that's going on and just love each other.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nThat's right.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nHelp each other find it\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nCannot stand\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nTo lift each other up. And just let's all just be great humans with each other. Oh, my goodness. Man, we're getting down to it, I was just checking the time from. Oh, OK, this would be a good one. So. I'm often curious, and I can imagine that people watching and listening are curious as well, what does a typical day for Latricia Lingus look like? Like when you get up and then how long do you work and what do you do during the day? And then when you when your head hits the pillow? What happened between that time?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nWell, I can say that outside of my prayer time, the next part of the next piece of the puzzle is to organize my activities. I don't make a move until I have organized the activities of my day. I usually do it the day before, but sometimes things happen. So making sure that I organized the activities of my day and then it's I answer emails on my phone, I'll do that for probably about an hour or so. And then I get to the computer and it's all about doing everything that you do on the computer and three businesses here. So and just taking the priorities, you get overwhelmed if you try to do everything all at the same time. So you give priority to the things like right now we have an event that we're preparing for and promoting for on August 14th. So we're getting the artists to sign up in advance so they can come to Vegas or if they're already here locally, they can get involved and it will give them an opportunity for a PR package and and distribution through one of the subsidiaries of Sony Music. So they're going to have an opportunity to try out and see if they can qualify for that. And so we're that's August 14th. So we're in the mix for that. And then we have a November event that's happening with another venture that we're involved with where we are doing our 60 day stressless challenge. So we're promoting for that. And if you want to know anything about any of this stuff, guys, just go to Grandmama's Dotcom and send us a quick note and we'll send you all the information you want. But doing that and then we have another client that we're bringing on. So it's organized and then you take the priorities as they go. My work is no longer than six hours.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nOh.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nNever. Well, I can't say never, but very rarely longer than six hours, and that's pushing it, it's usually between four to five.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nWow. And you get a lot done in that time. How do you get so much done in such a short amount of time organization?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nYes. Yes, it's prioritizing.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nIndeed, it is so easy to get sidetracked on a little ridiculous things. And then by the time you look up, all the day's over. And I didn't do anything on my list. But do you actually put stuff in like, say, a calendar or something as if it were an appointment that has to get done or what what do you do to make sure that your organized list gets accomplished? Is there anything beyond writing it out on a piece of paper or on a phone or somewhere else?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nI do. I have I send myself notes. I'm old school. I mean, with all this technology, I was getting bogged down. They have project management software and apps and all that stuff that you can use. And they're great. They're wonderful. If that's your thing. I'm an old school girl like Post-it notes and all of that. So I have my version. I create my notes the night before in the morning. I add anything that needs to be added and I email it to myself to make sure that I'm remembering it's that repetitive motion, you know, that repetitive process that reminds me, OK, these are the things that I really need to focus on and anything that is not a priority. I make sure that I put it to decide whether it's in my mind, whether it's in my documentation, whatever it is, it's always to the side so that I can strictly focus. On those things that have to get done,\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd I think the key for everybody listening and watching is to write it down, you don't have it either with pen or pencil or on computer, notepad, whatever you use. But I haven't. I have to do this and similar. I've got a tumulus pat on my computer. I've got to do this on my own. But I've got you know, it's all over the place, but it works for me. The point is, do what works for you. And we still have a beautiful, wonderful prize to give away. And one of the things I like I can't believe this is where at the end already, Latricia,\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nIt's going so fast and flies when you're having fun.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd I'm telling you, we were separated. I was going to say that that's what happens when twins. Right. They think the same thing with the\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nSame thing yet.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nSo I like to always close the show with a particular question. And I know you've watched the show earlier. Oh, I've got to say hello, Prince. I big salute to both of you for all valuable information, peace and blessings. This guy is\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nHere.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI met him about seven or eight years ago and just talked to him several times since. Just a beautiful human. I love you, Prince. Thank you for coming on and saying hi. But I ask this question of each individual because it's just it's profound. I found the responses just kind of blew me away. I was like, didn't expect it. It can be a little bit personal, but not to worry, it's it's just a profound question. But before we do that, I promised those who watched live that they could enter to win a five nights stay. Five star luxury resort compliments again of the big insider secrets dotcom. And I'll put the information up on the screen for those of you watching live with us right now, all you need to do and you now have our both of our permission to take your gaze away for just a moment and enter this website, address into your phone, onto your computer, tablet, whatever you're watching on. And that addresses are wiki. I am for vacation, our WIP. I am for vacation. And all you do is you enter your information there on the form and that will officially enter you in to win this. Well, we do this every show. I was going to say this weekly prize, but it's every dog on show that we do, no matter how often we do, and because we're doing them twice this week.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nSo that is that I hope you win. Enter that do that quickly because we're going to ask Latricia that big heavy hitting question. My goodness, there should be a drumroll for this. Maybe we'll drop some bombs. The good news with this Latricia's there's no such thing as a wrong answer to this question. It flat out does not exist. The reason is, is because it's it's it's personal because it's unique to you. That's the only way. It's personal because the only correct answer will be your answer. It can't be wrong, and the only right one is yours, because it's an interesting question that way, and I love to be able to ask this, so just know that. And if it takes you a few moments to think about it, ponder, that's fine. If you get it immediately, that's fine because it's your answer. It's unique to you. So there's absolutely zero pressure and it's actually fun because I get to be on the receiving end along along with everyone else who's watching and listening to your remarkable answer, because it's going to be yours and coming from you. It will be remarkable. We all know. So with all that buildup.\n\nSpeaker2:\n\nAre you ready?\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nI am ready.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nI knew you would be all right. Here we go. Latricia Grandmama's, how do you define. Success.\n\nSpeaker4:\n\nThat's a great question for me, success is being able to. Live your life on your terms. It is being able to roll through the challenges of life. With your mind, your body and your business intact. Success is having people you love. Success is learning the lessons of life. And not repeating the same problems that, you know, that we go through, sometimes we have to circle a few times. But success is just being able to be happy about the life that you're living in, having peace. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it's yours and live it on your terms, and I can promise that's going to feel like success does for me.\n\nSpeaker1:\n\nAnd you know what's coming? Oh, my goodness. Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking to Latricia Green Mangus, the amazing, amazing young woman doing some incredible things with her business, with her husband, helping people, serving people, you know, donating to worthwhile organizations from their proceeds for their packages.

How are entrepreneurs like us, who have been hustling and struggling to make it to success, who seem to make it one step forward, only to fall two steps back. Who are dedicated, determined, and driven. How do we finally break through and win? That is the question, and this podcast will give you the answers. My name is Brian Kelly, and this is The MIND BODY BUSINESS Show.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome, welcome, welcome to The MIND BODY BUSINESS Show. Super excited for tonight's show. We have not just one, not two, not three, but four, four amazing guest experts who are joining me tonight right here on this very stage.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nThey are waiting in the wings at this moment. So let's get busy. Shall we? The MIND BODY BUSINESS Show, that is a show about what I call the three pillars of success, and that came about as a result of my study of only successful people in the last decade or so. And these patterns kept bubbling to the top and those patterns being mine, which is mindset set. Each and every successful person, to a person, had a very powerful and flexible mindset. So I learned that and said,\" I need to implement that\". Then body: body is about literally taking care of yourself. Through nutrition and through exercise, exercising on a regular basis, and again that was another pattern of very successful people and in business. These successful people had mastered the skill-sets that were necessary to create, maintain, and grow a thriving business. They're wide and varied. It's like marketing, sales, team-building, systematizing. It goes on and on and on, leadership. There's no one person, in my humble opinion, that could master every single one of these. All you have to do is master just one, and I actually mentioned one of those. It was in that list. I don't know if anyone caught that, but if you master just one of those skill sets then you're good to go. That skill set is leadership. When you've mastered the skill set of leadership, you can then delegate those skills off to people who have those skill sets. See where I'm going? Good. That's what successful people do; the ones that I studied, anyway, over the course of about 10 years. That's what this show's about. It's a show for entrepreneurs by entrepreneurs. I got four guests waiting, and I'm not going to wait any longer. So, I think we should just bring them on. What do you think? Let's do it.\n\nNarrator :\n\nIt's time for the guest expert spotlight, savvy, skillful, professional and deft, trained, big league, qualified.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nAnd there they all are. These amazing, beautiful guests on The MIND BODY BUSINESS Show. How are you all doing? Altogether, too. That was phenomenal, I love that. So real quick. All of you, I hope you don't mind for just a moment. I want to do some housekeeping? I wanted to mention to everyone watching here live.

R-Y-P dot I-M forward-slash stream live. Fantastic. Now let's get to the real fun, and the fun is these amazing people. Dylan, Julie, Tim, Christian. How are you all doing tonight? Thank you for being on this amazing show. Yes. So, what I'd like to do is open it up. Let the folks get to know you just a little bit now. Ok, guys. We're talking sixty seconds or less. All right. Just lay it low here, but we'll just go and order. I usually go ladies first, but let's just go around the circle. It's easier for me who's running the show. So. That's what's important. Right? So, let's start with Dylan Shinholser. Go ahead. Take it away. Give us a little brief background about you, what you do, and your business.\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nYeah, absolutely. So like I said, my name is Dylan Shinhoser. I own a couple of different businesses. I'm owner of a company called, \"Experience Events\", which is event management. I'm also a director of business development at a virtual event, event ticketing, and virtual event platform called, \"ViewStub\". As well as a co-host of another show called, \"Event Masters\", where I just ramble all day, every day about how to produce better experiences. It's really all I know and love to do is events. That is my less than 60-second pitch about myself.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nThat's a good one, too. I'll tell everybody I've spoken with you in person. We had a call some time ago, and this gentleman, Dylan, is made of integrity and great character. So, reach out to him if you need any assistance in any of the areas he talked about, or if you just want to say hi to a really great guy. Then get in contact with him, and at the end of the show, we'll go through that. Please. Somebody remind me if I forget how to contact each of you. Because that's very important to me. This is the reason I bring this show to the forefront. (It) is to bring people like you into the lives of those who may not know who you are yet, and even those that do, to experience even more of your brilliance, your experience, your knowledge, and your value. It's not about me. This is about you. Always, always. Every time. I have one guest, usually. I just feel like I'm in this big family right now. But let's keep moving. Julie Riley, amazing young woman. Take it away.\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nYes. So, I am Julie Riley. I am the social media manager at StreamYard. The platform we're using right now. Prior to my time with StreamYard, I owned my own marketing agency. I've been in digital marketing since two thousand and seven. So the very, very early days of the start of it is when I jumped in(to) digital marketing, and I love just being able to help others succeed in their business.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nFantastic, and I will also say that I have spoken with Julie in the past. Both through a typewritten chat form and verbally. I think it was Clubhouse first time, which was phenomenal. Yet another phenomenal person, incredible integrity, and character. And yes, you're going to notice there's a pattern about this with the remaining two. It's the same thing. Hopefully, we can get the last one to talk a little bit. That will be nice. I'm just having fun because we were having fun before the show started. The one smiling. The biggest down there with the green hood; not pointing anyone out or anything. Thank you, Julie, for coming on. Yes. These people, Julie and Christian specifically, I know Christians coming up here in second. They're non-stop. They don't stop working. It's evident because of the very software research we're using right now. It's of grand quality for a reason. It's because of people like Julian Christian who keep everything rolling smoothly on the back end. Dylan's there nodding his head emphatically because he gets it. It's a lot of work, and they're doing it masterfully and we appreciate you. All right. Enough of the favoritism here that felt like favoritism. Julie's our favorite. Timothy McNeely! My buddy, my friend from just a little north of where I reside. I believe. If I remember.\n\nTimothy McNeely:\n\nCentral California, baby. Bakersfield. Yeah, my name is Tim McNeely. Today, so many dentists and driven entrepreneurs are just not sure if they're getting advice that really makes a difference for them. They may have a financial adviser who is giving them some advice on their investment portfolio, but they're not really sure that they're on the right track to really maximize their net worth outside of their business. That's what I help them do. Maximize your net worth so that you can keep taking care of the people you love, support the causes you care about, really make that difference in the world, and build an amazing life of significance. I love doing streaming because I get to talk to some of the best of the best out there and share the knowledge with the beautiful entrepreneurial community.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nI'll tell you something on a personal note as well. Literally, we talked earlier today, Tim and I, on a Zoom call. He just reached out to me and said, \"let's catch up.\" I had him on the show some time ago as a single, solo guest, and he was phenomenal. We've just kind of maintained a relationship, a friendship ever since. He just wanted to reach out and say, \"Hi\" and \"What's up? What do you want to talk about?\" We just started talking about business and things. He gave me resources that will help me in my business, and hopefully, I reciprocated it somehow. I don't know if I did, but it is the people like Tim, like Julie, like Dylan, like Christian. That is the cloth that they are all cut from. They are here to help people. That's why I love entrepreneurs. I love all of you. I mean it. I do. I love you. You guys are amazing. I didn't even get a crack at a Christian on that one. Jeez, I mean... there we go. That's a little better, but I'm telling you, he's working on StreamYard our stuff right now as we're on the show. I mean, I'm.\n\nChristian Karasiewicz:\n\nI'm really trying not to, seriously.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nThe founder Geige Vandentop. If you ever watch this, there's a message to you. Ease up on your people. Alright? Just having fun. Alright, Timothy, you're an amazing guy. Thank you for spending your valuable time and coming on here. As well as Dylan, Julie, and the ever so talkative one, Christian. I'm not going to attempt to say your last name. I'll let you take care of that one. Welcome to the show, Christian. Let's hear all about your brilliance.\n\nChristian Karasiewicz:\n\nSure. Thanks a lot for having me. My name is Christian Kerasiewicz. I'm the content marketing manager at StreamYard. So, pretty much anything you see on our blog that we're going to soon be launching. I'm the mastermind behind that. So, I do that. In addition to that, I also host live stream reviews, a YouTube show. We also do on the StreamYard YouTube channel where we invite people on to talk about their live streams and help them work through some of their problems, some of their challenges that they might be having with getting community or building a show. Thanks a lot for having me. I appreciate it.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nOh, my gosh. Thank you again, Christian, for your time and being here. I mean, he's literally building a blog while on a live show. I mean, that's a great thing. I'm not even kidding with this one. That is phenomenal. That is showing such dedication. So, it's more than that. It's passion. It's love. You know? What time is that where you are, Christian?\n\nChristian Karasiewicz:\n\nAbout 9 o'clock, or yeah... about 9 o'clock.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\n(Nine o'clock) PM. Ladies and gentlemen, in case you're watching this recording. Yes. By the way, I'm going to be on twenty-five different platforms after this is over. So no pressure, but don't mess up. I'm just kidding. So, this is a phenomenal group of people, and I can't wait to dig in. Christian, just what you just said, what you do is right down the alley of what I was hoping to talk about tonight. It'll go organically, but I wanted to talk about... I mean, look at Julie, and look at Christian, and look at their images. Look at their video. It is gorgeous. Here, we'll start with a really gorgeous one first. Look at that. I mean. If there were nose hairs that weren't in place, we'd see them. That's phenomenal, and there is Julie. Wow. Very beautiful. Even more beautiful. I should just have her up like this all the time, and we can just talk in the background. Because, you know, maybe more people would come on. So, you guys have phenomenal camera setups, and here's one thing I always like to preach to those who are getting into the live streaming game. Does it take money? Yes, it does. It takes resources. It takes cameras, microphones, (a) computer, internet, good internet, fast internet, lighting, doesn't have to be fancy. What I always say though, is, do the best you can with the resources you currently have. OK, I wanted to start it off that way because what we're about to talk about with Julie and Christian is their cameras. They are top of the line. We're not talking a one-hundred or two-hundred-dollar webcam here. I like to let ladies go first. So, Julie, do you have a story when you first turned on your new camera versus when you had the webcam and what that looked like and felt like.\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nOh, my gosh, I turned that camera on, and it was immediately noticeable (the difference). I actually did a live on my personal Facebook page where I logged myself in as a second user into StreamYard. I had my Logitech camera that I had been using up as a camera and then had my new one. So, I could do back and forth and show everybody the difference between the two. What an upgrade that was. The Logitech served me great for years. It didn't stop me from going live, but that upgrade was immediately like, \"oh, I can never go back down now\".\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nSo, that so that is one thing. Let's say you're on the road, and I can imagine at some point both you and Christian, maybe, you'll be sent on the road to maybe support conventions and things that are on the road. Now, you want to stream live, what are you going to do then?\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nWell, you know, the great thing about the Sony is (that) it's a small camera. Tripods, portable ones, are small. I can take it with me. If all else fails, and I'm either on my phone or I'm on my little webcam or even my built in webcam, it's not going to stop me from going live. Is it going to be exactly what I want? No, but more than likely I'll have the Sony with me.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nThank you for saying that. I mean, that spoke such volumes. I hope people are taking notes that are watching. Definitely take notes on this. Because, look, the show must go on. That's what I say, and this show tonight is the result of a guest who unfortunately was ill and could not make it on. So, I scrambled and found these four wonderful people to say, \"I'll come on and do a panel with you.\" And that's it. The show must go on, and I'm going to either do it with people or I'll do it solo. It doesn't matter. Consistency is key, and we can talk more about that, too. I love how you're just talking about, Julie. Where, look, I don't care where I'm at. If I've got something and it's my time to go live, and I don't have my gear. I'm doing it.\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nRight.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nI love that commitment. So, thank you for that. For everyone listening, that's important. Yes, quality is important. Like I said, do the best you can with what resources you currently have. That includes, wherever you are. You may have a DSL camera that Julie paid five-hundred thousand dollars for. Oh, sorry, it wasnt that much.\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nThank God it wasnt that much!\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nWhat was the model of that again?\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nA6000.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nWhat does it run about?\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nIt was about seven hundred.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nOK, not too bad. A little bit less than five-hundred thousand. Not much but yeah.\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's a phenomenal thing, and I love that that's your attitude toward commitment. I'll tell you. You have a similar attitude...anytime I go and ask for support through the back side of StreamYard community. I mean, like through messaging. When I say the backside, that's sounded weird. When I ask for support, you're always there. I mean, you don't sleep, and I appreciate that. So, keep not sleeping for everybody's sake. Christian, you do the same. So, Christian, what about you? When you made that initial change from whatever camera you had before to this unbelievably clear one year look you're working with right now. What did that feel like the moment you saw a difference?\n\nChristian Karasiewicz:\n\nSo, it's very interesting actually. So, this is actually what I was using before. I've been using this for quite a number of years. This is a Logitech Brio. It does do 4K. I invested in this one and eventually came out, and the quality was fantastic. The only thing was, though. I wanted to scale. So this was great for traveling, for example. This is what I took around with me. Super portable. It's got the ability to put it on a tripod. Fantastic, but it did not allow me to scale, so I had to always take up another USB port and all that sort of thing. When I moved to the Sony, the Sony looked very good. I will say the one thing you have to do, though, is you need to go through the settings. There are a few adjustments you want to change. That's what's going to actually enhance your picture quality of it. It's a fantastic camera. It's a Sony 6400. Then, really, the other side to it is also the lens. So I'm using a Sigma lens. So, that I think is the real big difference. I mean you have the kit lenses it comes with. I did make the investment in the the additional lens, which I think that's actually what's contributing to why it looks so good. I will say from a quality standpoint, again, start with what you have. You know, the key things for live streaming. Audio is going to be your most important part. Then also, if you, for example, are using one of these webcams, make sure you have enough light. These things look great with a lot of light. When you don't have a lot of light, you're going to see pixelation. You're going to see distortion and things like that. So, turn it back to you.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nEspecially with light, if you turn on the green screen feature, you really need to have good lighting then. That's the biggest time. I'm so glad to be liberated from that. Even though I loved it. This is actually a natural well behind me. I painted the entire studio. I actually occupy my daughter's former bedroom. I've been here for four or five years now, and I finally got rid of the cartoon drawings and the yellow paint. I'm a real boy now. I have a real studio. This is awesome.\n\nChristian Karasiewicz:\n\nThat looks really good by the way. I was very surprised (by) your background because that looks like one of the standard backgrounds people would normally bring up during a live stream. One that has, you know, the gradient going around the outside. So, whoever did the painting on that fantastic job.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nWhy, thank you very much. My wife did most of the work to be honest, but I feel like that helps with that. Yeah.\n\nTimothy McNeely:\n\nIf you want that comparison between cameras. Right. Christine was just talking about the Logitech Brio. That's what I'm on, and you can see the massive quality difference between Kristen and Julie versus the webcam. So. Right. (A) huge step up.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nYeah, we'll point that out in glowing detail right now.\n\nChristian Karasiewicz:\n\nYou're using a green screen. Right?\n\nTimothy McNeely:\n\nYeah.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nYour sound, Christian, is smooth. I mean, you have a great radio voice. Having that microphone, I think will pivot to that too. Dylan, what are your thoughts on cameras? Yours looks actually really decent right now? You're on (a) green screen, correct?\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nCorrect. Yeah.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nIt looks really clean. You've done a good job with all the lighting. It's almost like you've done this before, and you know what you're doing.\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nI try. Yeah. So, I actually when I first started doing it, I started listening back on my phone. When this whole pandemic hit, I was using the one inside your laptop and realized very quickly (that) I'm on calls all day, live streaming shows and stuff. I was like, \"I got to set my game up.\" So, I haven't made that leap yet to the DSLR, but I will. I'm on a Logitech, one of the models. I won't even lie because I'm not that tech-savvy. It was expensive for Logitech, so I bought it. I was like, \"it's got to work.\" So, yeah. So, that's where I'm at. I agree heavily. I think it comes down to, because we get asked it and I know you guys get asked, it comes down to what you can afford at the moment. Then always trying to push the limits of production value. Right? My background was a wall. It was just like random yellow wall, and now I have a giant green screen wallpaper now. So, now, I can be wherever I want which is a concert. That's where I want to be, and that's where I'm going to be.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nYou're the one on the stage, brother. Not the audience.\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nNo, I'm actually the guy behind the stage. I never want to be this. It's actually weird for me to be in front of people. I'm the guy behind the stage telling people to get on the stage.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nPushing them forward. Well, you do a good job, Dylan. I wouldn't know any different. Maybe your calling is to step out from behind and be on front more often.\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nWe will see. Twenty twenty-one has a lot of stuff, and I've got a long way to go. I got super bored in twenty-twenty so I might as well talk.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nI've gotten to know you a little bit over time, and you've got a great personality. I think you need to shine in front of more people. That's my humble opinion.\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nI appreciate that.\n\nIn the front, not behind the scenes. It's okay to be behind the scenes on occasion, but someone like you with your personality and your integrity, your character...get out there, buddy. It's a disservice if we don't get to see you. Let me put it that way.\n\nThat's what a mentor of mine said. He was like, \"dude, you're actually being selfish by not talking more and getting it out.\" Because like I said at the beginning, I only want to help more people create better experiences and events. Make them flow better and make them more money as humanly possible. At the end of the day, I just want to travel the world with cool people and do cool things. I've learned a lot, and a lot of people need some of that experience. So, I got a stern talking to by one of my mentors. He was like, \"dude...\" I was like, \"alright, it's alright. I promise.\" I started live streaming then had to get better cameras, better lights going on. It's crazy up here in my little command center of all these different lights, webcams, and monitors. Everything you need to do to pull these shows off.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nYeah, I love it. Christian, go ahead.\n\nChristian Karasiewicz:\n\nSo, I want to throw something in there real quick. We talked about various types of cameras. If you're just getting started, use that built-in laptop, the webcam. So then you can take it up a notch. You can go to the Logitech. The C922. That's about, I think, a 60 to 70 dollar webcam. So, don't overpay by the way. It's about 60 to 70 dollars. Get it from Logitec, probably. If you find an astronomical price on Amazon, move up to like the Brio, for example. If your budget allows it, that's about one hundred fifty dollar camera. Then move up to a DSLR. For example, Julie's got that, the Sony 6000. I would also say if you happen to have a smartphone, this can be used as a webcam. Essentially, if you think about it, this is a thousand dollar camera. Because you paid a thousand dollars for this device of sorts, and this will give you some phenomenal picture quality. If you already have a smartphone and you don't have to have the latest iPhone, it could be pretty much any iPhone and Android phone. You just need an app such as one called,\"Camo.\" There's one called,\"Erion.\" So, there are lots of apps out there. Don't think like, \"hey, I have to now go drop a bunch of money.\" Look at the phones you have lying around. Those are going to be great ways to fix your picture quality.\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nI've been going live since 2015, and I only had this camera last year.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nThat's it. You keep reinvesting. I had a good friend of mine who were business partners. He said, I'll never forget it,\"sales drive service\". When you're making money, you're able to invest. You're able to up your game, and I love that. So many great points. You can just set a phone on a tripod and your camera will look better than many people's webcams. For sure. One of the things that I would recommend, this isn't just a plug StreamYard, is to get at least get the free plan. Do they need any more than the free plan to be part of the community, Julie?\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nNo. They can come to join the community even if they're just getting started into streaming. We do like everybody to have the free plan so they have an understanding, but we'll still let you in. Agree to the rules. That's the big thing. Yeah, come join the StreamYard community. It's really a \"stream yard\" community.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nIt's a very valuable place because questions like what Christian just addressed are often asked (What do I need?). I'm just starting. I'm a newbie. I see that so much in there. What can you do to help with a camera or microphone or computer? You can go there if you have those questions and ask, and the community will fill in the blanks wonderfully well because they're a great bunch of people. Just like Tim down there who's gotten pushed to the side for a while. So, Tim, is this your first camera that you've been using for live streaming so far? Did you have one before it?\n\nTimothy McNeely:\n\nYeah, right. I started with just an HD one. Right. Logitech and then jumped up to the Brio. Been happy with that so far. But, you know, it's interesting how the game keeps growing again. That's the thing, right? Just get started! Just do this. I started with just using zoom and recording those for my interviews, and then I realized (that) I need a better platform. I need a way to kind of do that live production. Now I'm doing Stream Yard and got intros. Just get started with whatever you've got and kind of build that proof of concept. You know, I recently just upgraded my lights because I bought the cheapest lights I could at first. I just wanted to do something, and done is better than not done a lot of times.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nI totally agree with everything you just said and like what Christian was saying. If you're going to put money into anything, make it the audio side of things first when you upgrade. I was fortunate. I started over nine years ago streaming live. This is a DSLR. Not a DSLR. Good grief, XLR microphone. It's old school. It's not even USB. So I plug it into a mixer board, and from there into my computer. I've used it for years. It's been just amazing. I've never had to do anything with my sound as a result. For you, there are great USB alternatives now. Oh my gosh, there are so many out there. Someone like Christian could probably point you in the right way. Someone like the StreamYard community could push you in the right way and tell you,\"these are the ones\". I have a connection with the guy who is a sound expert. I've never heard of this before. He has a studio that does 4D sound. I don't even know what that means. Four dementional?\n\nChristian Karasiewicz:\n\nSweet.\n\nI don't know what that means, audibly. He was telling me about speakers in the ceiling. I'm like, holy moly,. You don't need that obviously for a talk show like this, but think about the possibilities and have fun with it. The bottom line is, when you go on and go live. Enjoy yourself. I'm trying to do that a little bit with these fine people tonight. Thankfully, they're still here with me. I haven't upset them too great, especially Christian. I keep picking on him. Poor guy. I appreciate you all, and it's okay to have fun on your show. Would you guys agree with that? Is it okay to have a little bit of fun?\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nOne hundred percent. If you're having fun, your audience is going to be having fun with you.\n\nIf you're not having fun... I don't believe in doing anything that I don't find fun. It's a life motto of mine. If I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it. Yeah. Like you said, Julie. If you're not having fun with it, then how in the world do you expect the viewers to want to have fun or engage or interact? It starts with you.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nAbsolutely, absolutely. One of the things I wanted to pivot to is something I'm deeply interested in because the product that came up earlier when I did the quick ads spot. I like to solve the pain points that people are having in their live streaming experiences. I'm curious. I'll bet, Julie and Christian, you guys have seen and heard a lot about that. I actually had a team member of mine from my company put a poll up in the form of a meme, a graphic. What's the right word? I am having trouble with words these days. It's an infograph. That's it. Simple. I was a little bit shocked by the result, but I was just curious what you guys think. What are the biggest pain points you're seeing? (Either) that you're having individually. Tim, if you have that as well. Dylan as well. Dylan, you probably hear about a bunch of it as well. What are the pain points you are seeing come back over and over and over again? I'm having a horrible time trying to find another guest on my show if they're interview style, or the tech is just blowing my mind. Even though StreamYard is so simple. I'm having trouble with x, y, z. Let's just go around the horn. Dylan, if you don't mind, I put you on the spot. Can you think of any of those pain points that keep coming up over and over again?\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nYeah, absolutely. The biggest thing I see is they underestimate what it does take. I totally agree. Why I promote StreamYard to our clients and everyone I possibly can is because of the ease of use. People go into it and think shows are just like setting up the webcam, and they can be. Setting up the webcam and just talking. Right? There's a lot of back end stuff to this. These shows and I'm learning that as doing my own now. I'm like, holy cow, I'm about to hire fifteen people because this is absurd. But, yeah. I think that's the biggest thing that I see is underestimating it, but also at the same time, they overcomplicate it. They have to think (that) they have to have all these bells and whistles and seventeen thousand cameras and two million dollar microphones. It goes back to our first point of \"just do it\". It doesn't need to be overcomplicated, but understand going into it, there is some work that takes and understand that you do have to respect what it takes to put these on. At the same time, don't overcomplicate it. It's funny how people work. They overestimate or underestimate it, but then heavily overcomplicate it at the same time. I think that's the biggest one I see.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nI'm so glad you brought that up. I've said this so many times, people don't realize what goes on behind the scenes before the show even comes on live for that episode. The amount of time and effort. If you want to do a live show that's of quality and represent yourself and your brand in a way that you want it to be represented professionally. It takes a good amount of work for every single show. That's why I automated nearly every process (that) I use now. It took time to get there, but you can use a team. You can get a team. Like you said, Dylan, to also help out. For me, it's all about quality, and more time is spent before the show by far than the show itself. After the show is over, another good deal of time is spent. That is in the minor edits, the repurposing, the marketing, and everything else that goes beyond. The live show is this tiny window of time, and it's the fun is part of it by the way. When you have everything automated, the rest is not \"not fun\" because you're not doing it. It's all automated, but definitely great. Thank you for that. Julie, what has been some of the big p.. sorry to wake you up there. What have been some of the big pain points? You are wide awake. I just starttled you. You've seen over and over, I bet you've seen a bunch of them.\n\nJulie Riley:\n\nOh, my gosh. So many, you know, especially because I'm approving all of the comments that are coming into the group. I think one of the huge ones is that the hesitation of people who believe that they have to have everything perfect. That they have to have all of the backdrops, the overlays, the banners, the super expensive microphone, and the super expensive camera. That they have it. The room behind them is messy. They haven't thought about turning to just a blank wall because they're like, \"well, then I don't have a fancy studio set up.\" They get to this point where they're trying to create perfection, and perfection is a fairy tale. It doesn't exist. There is no such thing as perfection. There is, again, where Dylan said the overcomplicating it. They've got to really just slow down and go, \"what do I need to get this process going?\" What is the minimum to make it happen? From there, then I can then build on it, and build on it each week. Go, \"okay, I got live. I got the first one out. I got the jitters out. I hate the way I sound.\" When I had my agency, I would tell my clients. They'd be like, \"I can't stand the way I sound.\" I'm like, nobody likes the way (that) they sound. There's actually, and I say this all the time, there's a term for it that is a term for not liking the sound of your own voice. I tell people, you have to get over that fear. They're like,\"I don't look good on camera, I don't know how to be on camera.\" The other thing I tell people is to set up a fake Facebook group with nobody else in it but you. Go live in there a bunch of times and just get those jitters out. Get that feeling of pressing the button and going live. Then invite your husband in, your sister, your mother, or whoever. Somebody so that you're talking to somebody. From there, build up each time. As we said with the cameras, again, you can you can slowly build. You can slowly add in the overlays. You can slowly add in the backgrounds.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nMy goodness! I absolutely love it. I have my own Facebook group that I use just for that. Nothing more. I go in there, and I test things for StreamYard and other things in there. I go live in there because there's no substitute for going live. We've got more buttons to click, and things kind of change their arrangement just a little bit in the window. If you practiced it 20 times without going live, then you go live you're going to go, \"what the heck just happened?\" I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. That was perfect. Perfect advice. I love that. We've got a comment coming in or two or three. Yeah. Kelly, crucial. Kruschel. Sorry if I got that wrong.\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nKelly Kruschel. It's Kruschel. She said she's on my team. She's a friend. Hey, we've got a supporter.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nLove it. Love it. Then Fran Jesse, I know her. I'm getting ready to make my first video essentially input. Yeah. Reach out, Fran. We're friends. I will give you assistance in any way you want because this is the greatest this is the greatest avenue for media on the planet, in my humble opinion, for so many reasons. One is people get to see you. I love clubhouse. It's also phenomenal in different ways, but people get to see you. They get to interact with you. They can engage with you, and they get to see your essence. It doesn't cost you, the studio owner, studio time. If you do this in the old days when you have to go to a television studio and you want to do a show, it would cost you thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars just to use the studio. Let alone get the media time to put it up on a television station. We're living in wonderful times. It's the greatest time to be alive, in my humble opinion. I'm a tech geek. I'm not young anymore. I'm fifty six, but I can't wait for the rest of what my life has to hold. Yes. You're welcome, Fran. Any time. Wonderful. Wonderful. Alright. Where were we? I got all messed up and loving myself there. We're going to have fun. I'm being real. This is like... I don't know. I'm the most relaxed (that) I've been in a long time with everything that went on today. It was one of those weird, everything-going crazy days. I feel like I'm at home with you guys. That's why.\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nIt's been one of those years.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nThank God that last one is over.\n\nDylan Shinholser:\n\nYeah, yeah. Sure.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nSo, okay. Pain point. Let's go back around one more. Tim, what do you have?\n\nTimothy McNeely:\n\nYeah. When I first started doing this, my whole goal was to get out there and to talk to the different experts in the different areas of the challenges that my my clients face. I started off as an interview show and just using Zoom to record the video. Then all of a sudden I had the video. Now I had to put an intro in. I had to put an exit in. I had to extract the audio so I could do the podcast. My team members and myself were spinning our wheels. Just trying to really kind of create a workflow around the creation of this content so we could get the message out and help people with their challenges. For me, all of a sudden, the revelation was (that) I can do this live. I can have people type in (and) ask comments as I'm doing the show. Not only that, from start to finish, I can produce the whole thing going live. Right? You go live. You can play an intro now. You can throw in little commercial breaks. You can throw in the outro, and then it's done. Download the audio. You throw it up, and now you've got your podcast. You don't have to upload video to YouTube and Facebook and LinkedIn. It's done for you now, automatically. So really my biggest pain point was just the production side of things and putting everything together so that I could keep talking to people and doing the fun part. Right? I don't want to get caught up in all the details of making this. I want to talk to people, learn, and share that knowledge. Really, a lot of the pain point, just using StreamYard has really been absolved because it's a turn-key easy to use platform.\n\nBrian Kelly:\n\nAmen to all of that brother. Here's the key for everyone that's ever going t"
