The popular venue also serves as home base for his multi award-winning Live from Daryl’s House. The show, which began as a “light bulb” moment for Hall when he launched it in 2007 as a free webcast, has set the standard for artist-initiated projects. The groundbreaking series provides a mix of legends and the next generation of superstars. “Live From Daryl’s House” streams on Daryl Hall’s YouTube channel.\n\nPrevious episodes of Live From Daryl’s House have featured a diverse mix of veteran and new performers from rock, soul, country and R&B including rock legends Sammy Hagar, Joe Walsh, Cheap Trick, Tommy Shaw, Kenny Loggins, Todd Rundgren, Nick Lowe, Dave Stewart and Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top; soul and R&B artists The O’Jays, Aaron Neville, Aloe Blacc, Kandace Springs, Elle King, Wyclef Jean, Smokey Robinson, Cee Lo Green, Booker T & The MGs, and Sharon Jones; big-league singer/songwriters such as Ben Folds, Rob Thomas, Jason Mraz, Gavin DeGraw, Goo Goo Dolls’ John Rzeznik and Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump; country artists such as Shelby Lynne; and has helped break new acts like Fitz & The Tantrums, Grace Potter & The Nocturnals, Neon Trees, Johnnyswim, Parachute and Anderson East. The latest episodes of the show feature Squeeze’s Glenn Tilbrook, Blackberry Smoke’s Charlie Starr, Andy Grammer, Lisa Loeb, Robert Fripp, and Howard Jones.\n\nDaryl Hall has come a long way, and he’s still got plenty of mileage left in a career that’s taken him from the streets of Philadelphia to the halls of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. The best is yet to come.\n\nABOUT ELVIS COSTELLO\n\nElvis Costello is a writer and part-time musician who made a number of records in the 20th Century, some of which are still remembered today.\n\nHe was born in London and raised there and in Liverpool.\n\nCostello is the composer or lyricist of over six hundred published titles, including fifteen songs co-written with Paul McCartney and renowned collaborations with Allen Toussaint, the Brodsky Quartet and T Bone Burnett.\n\nCostello’s songwriting alliance with Burt Bacharach, began in 1995 with the song, “God Give Me Strength”, which led to the 1998 album, “Painted From Memory”, before their work was collected in 2023, on the four-album set, “The Songs Of Bacharach & Costello”.\n\nElvis Costello songs have been recorded by Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Chet Baker, Dusty Springfield, Solomon Burke, George Jones, Linda Ronstadt and Bjork, while among the artists with whom he has written songs are Loretta Lynn, Carole King, Rosanne Cash and Kris Kristofferson and his wife, Diana Krall.\n\nWorking purely as a lyricist, Costello has provided words for the music of Billy Strayhorn, Oscar Peterson and for twelve Charles Mingus compositions and as a composer, set twelve unpublished lyrics by Bob Dylan.\n\n2024 will see the opening of “A Face In The Crowd”, Sarah Ruhl’s stage adaptation of the Budd Schulberg story for which Elvis Costello composed the songs.\n\n“A Face In The Crowd” will open at the Young Vic in London on September 10, 2024, directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah and produced by Adam Kenwright.\n\nElvis Costello is the author of “Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink”, a more than six-hundred page memoir which has been translated into six languages. He has received a range of awards over his 45 year old career of which the induction into the Songwriters Hall Of Fame is probably the most significant.\n\nAlthough he holds two honorary doctorates in music - one from the University of Liverpool and another from the New England Conservatory- Elvis Costello is known for playing the guitar with almost no regard for common sense.\n\nCostello currently performs with The Imposters; his long time companions, drummer, Pete Thomas and pianist, Steve Nieve, bassist of twenty-three years standing, Davey Faragher and their special guest, Texas guitarist, Charlie Sexton."
