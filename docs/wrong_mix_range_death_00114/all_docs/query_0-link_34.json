        "text": "Weâll never know what the final fruits of Joni Mitchellâs collaboration with jazz legend Charles Mingus mightâve sounded like. Mingus died before the project was completed, and not surprisingly, the album ultimately released has the feel of a rough draft rather than a polished work. Still, Mingus (1979) holds considerable interest for Mitchell fans, both in terms of its historical value and for the haunting, risk-taking nature of the music itself. Thereâs both an air of intoxication and a pervasive note of sadness to these tracks, as if Joni is serenading Charlesâ ghost in some otherworldly nightclub. âA Chair in the Skyâ and âSweet Sucker Danceâ combine swooning melodies with urbane, slightly woozy lyrics, underscored by Jaco Pastoriusâ burbling bass and Herbie Hancockâs cascading piano. Mitchell conducts a bopping visit to Vegas in âThe Dry Cleaner From Des Moinesâ and reworks Mingusâ standard âGoodbye Pork Pie Hatâ into a bittersweet elegy for its composer. You canât help wondering how these sessions wouldâve turned out with Mingusâ participation. As it is, Mingus occupies a unique place in Mitchellâs catalog, sketchy in spots but touched by fitful brilliance."
