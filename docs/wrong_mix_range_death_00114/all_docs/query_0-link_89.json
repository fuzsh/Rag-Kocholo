        "text": "The Montana concert season is gearing up. It's time to dig out the music t-shirts from past concerts. It's time to also get excited about the prospect of experiencing new shows and maybe getting a new t-shirt to proudly show you were at the event.\n\nMontana Concert Tees\n\nThe past few years I have made an effort to try to get a t-shirt from the concerts I have attended. I also try to pick a shirt that has the tour dates and towns listed on the shirt. If you happen to see a band play at the Kettlehouse Amphitheater outside of Missoula, you may notice that the tour shirts will say \"Bonner, MT,\" not Missoula. That's so cool, to me. Normally, on bigger name acts, the shirts will have big cities on them, like Las Vegas, Seattle, Denver, etc. To see Bonner, Montana listed with those huge cities makes me laugh. Bonner has a population of almost 1,300 people.\n\nMontana Concert Season Will Be Epic\n\nThere are going to be some major concert events in Montana this year. P!nk with Sheryl Crow, Tyler Childers, and Pearl Jam will be playing Washington Grizzly Stadium in Missoula. Miranda Lambert and Billy Strings will headline the \"Under the Big Sky Festival\" in Whitefish, MT. \"Rockin' the Rivers\" this year will feature Smash Mouth, Stone Temple Pilots, and Tim Montana. The Metra Park in Billings will see Cody Johnson, Kip Moore and Hozier perform. The Brick Breeden Fieldhouse in Bozeman will see REO Speedwagon and Rick Springfield perform this year. The Headwaters Country Jam will feature Bailey Zimmerman, Jon Pardi, and Gary Allan. These are just a few of the many concerts Montana will see this season.\n\nMontana's Most Searched Band T-Shirts"
