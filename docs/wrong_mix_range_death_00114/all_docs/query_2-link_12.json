King, and Cab Calloway, and he toured with Bruce Springsteen’s Seeger Sessions Band on trombone, sousaphone, penny whistles, and mandolin. He has received several commissions, including one from Jazz at Lincoln Center. Art has been deeply involved with education and conducts workshop and clinics in preschools, universities, and every place in between. In addition, Art was featured nightly as a soloist in the Broadway hit “After Midnight,” where he brought his Ellington expertise to the production.

Art says: “The repertoire comes from all kinds of sources, including songs I’ve written while jogging (pay no attention to the fact that these tunes have gotten slower over the years)! The possibilities include rock, jazz, folky, ethnic, etc. This group swallows them whole and creates a joyful musical gustatory experience!”\n\nApril 19, 2018\n\nThe Greg Ruvolo Big Band Collective\n\nGreg Ruvolo has toured with Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, and the big bands of Woody Herman, Gerry Mulligan, and Louis Bellson, and he brought his Big Band Collective back to Local 802’s Clubroom for a “Jazz in the Afternoon” performance!\n\nThe Greg Ruvolo Big Band Collective performance features an exciting blend of selections from the Great American Songbook, jazz standards, and compositions in the modern Big Band style.
