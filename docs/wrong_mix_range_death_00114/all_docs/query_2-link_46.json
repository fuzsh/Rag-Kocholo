        "text": "Deceased January 25, 2012\n\nView alumni profile (log in required)\n\nRead obituary\n\nIn Memory\n\nIt is a shame that no one in our class learned of Joe Pullara’s passing in January 2012 until May 2016.\n\nJoe was a low-key guy who slipped quietly into Amherst at the beginning of our junior year. He transferred in from what used to be called Staten Island Community College. He told me that neither he nor any of his friends and family had ever heard of Amherst until a guidance counselor suggested he apply. The view from Staten Island only went as far as Manhattan and Brooklyn and parts of northern New Jersey just over the Goethals Bridge. I was a preppy from Fairfield County, and we became friends even though at first he thought I was an alien.\n\nI first met Joe when he attended a meeting of the Amherst Entertainment Committee at Boltwood House in September of 1973. We were planning two major concerts for the ’73–’74 academic year (Ike and Tina Turner and Taj Mahal) as well as a significant jazz series (Charles Mingus, McCoy Tyner, Keith Jarrett and Rahsaan Roland Kirk). We were desperate for volunteers to handle everything from sound and lights to security, alcohol permits, production and publicity. Joe jumped right in and managed security, the toughest and most time-consuming task of all.\n\nWe became friends and drinking buddies during our last two years of college. I already had my own well-established groups of friends at Chi Phi and other fraternities as well as the glee club and the entertainment committee. Joe didn’t have any connections at all, and it never seemed to bother him. He wasn’t a joiner. He liked his classwork during the day and working on projects like the entertainment committee in the evening and on weekends. He was a sociology major and a big fan of Jan Dizard, even though he often complained that Prof. Dizard was busting his chops.\n\nJoe got me my first job right out of Amherst, working at a summer-long crafts and music festival on Cape Cod. I wasn’t used to the workday world like Joe was, and he’d drag me out of bed at 5:30 or 6 each morning to go to work. When the festival was over, I asked him if he wanted to join me for a couple of weeks of partying at a friend’s parents’ house in Chatham, but he declined because he wanted to get back to New York to look for work.\n\nJoe landed a job as a stage manager at the Shubert Theater on W. 44th Street right after A Chorus Line started its record-breaking run. I used to meet him backstage after performances and then head out for a late dinner or a few drinks. He didn’t like Nathan’s at all, but he loved a hole-in-the-wall gyro shop between 42nd and 43rd Street in Times Square. Joe spent his whole career working in the Shubert Organization. When he passed away, he was the longtime theater and house manager of the Imperial Theater on W. 45th Street, which means that shows like Dream Girls and Les Miserables among others would have gone into orbit on Joe’s watch.\n\nI lost touch with Joe after I got married and moved out of the City. He’s one of a handful of people I wish I’d kept in touch with over the years. I know he got married shortly after I moved away, but I never met his family. Joe is survived by his wife of 31 years, Patricia, and a son and daughter, Jason and Jillian. He lived on Staten Island his whole life. He loved fishing, the Giants and occasional trips to Las Vegas and Atlantic City.\n\nJonathan Davis ’75"
