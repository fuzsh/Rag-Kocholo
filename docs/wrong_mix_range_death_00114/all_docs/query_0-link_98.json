        "text": "As I reached into my mailbox a few days ago, sure enough, there it was. Amongst the bundles of furniture store ads, solicitations for credit cards, a couple of bills and a political flyer or two.\n\nYep. The big one. It even had the word official on it. As in \"Official Election Mail as Authorized by the United States Postal Service\". It was time to grab the best pen I had on my desk and get busy.\n\nThis Isn't About Who to Vote for on Your Ballot in Montana\n\nMy wife and I align pretty closely on political views. So, a political discussion is generally a pretty open one in our house that occurs more often than not. A point we came upon recently was how much to place on where someone has been born and raised.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nAnd to add to that, where is the point that someone \"becomes\" a Montanan? 10, 20, 30 years? My wife pointed out that her family were originally from Oregon and California. But after some 50+ years, yes if fact they were a Montanan. So, again, where is the line and does it really matter?\n\nThe Major Players in the Top Races of Montana\n\nAs our discussion continued, we both realized we didn't know where some candidates were born, or where home might be called. I headed towards the internet and came up with a few of the answers.\n\nREAD MORE: What is the Truth Behind the $9,000 Dime?\n\nI want to again emphasize that this list isn't meant to be political in any way. It is simply to show where each of some of the major players in some of the top races actually hail from. Montana born? Grandfathered in? Just got here last year and already poking the bears or bison?\n\nYou be the judge, good luck and get out and vote everyone!"
