        "text": "Coming from the West Coast, I have spent a lifetime reading bitter East Coasters underestimate things from California — the music, the sports teams, the lifestyle. You name it and we suck at it.\n\nMusic wise a big part of this was that the critical community resided back East and they seemed to feel that everything out West just fell short. I don’t think that West Coasters such as Dexter Gordon, Ornette Coleman, or Charles Mingus ever would have broken through to the jazz establishment if they had stayed in Los Angeles. Even successful L.A. jazz artists, the sublime drummer/bandleaders Chico Hamilton and Shelly Manne come to mind, probably hurt their legacies by staying on the West Coast.\n\nThis brings us to Charles Mingus’ East Coasting.\n\nThe liner notes and songs on this fine, undervalued LP make clear that when Mingus went to NYC he discovered that being a West Coaster was another of his defining characteristics that made him an outsider.\n\nMingus enjoyed being a contrary fellow. For instance, in later interviews he would bemoan the fact that some of his early albums, such as East Coasting, bill him as Charlie instead of Charles. Of all the hardships Mingus endured (racism, and chronic mental and physical illness, among them) I truly doubt multiple record labels conspired together to change the “s” on the end of his name to an “ie.”\n\nArt\n\nMingus is casually dressed but he looks so deadly serious that only his West Coast style casual dress stops him from resembling the doomed anti-hero in a film noir. This cover looks pretty cheap — and not in a clever, stylish Blue Note way — but the image does linger in the mind.\n\nBethlehem Records was a neat little jazz label that ran from 1953 until 1962. Its main producers were Teddy Charles (a recording artist in his own right) and Creed Taylor, who produced this album. I have written about Taylor on here before for starting the Impulse and the CTI labels. Creed Taylor was a big Bill Evans fan and probably brought the pianist to the session to be able to work with him. Bethlehem released records by Mingus, Art Blakey, Duke Ellington, and a host of West Coast jazz stars (such as Conte Candoli) but also recorded vocalists more than most indie jazz labels — Chris Connor, Nina Simone, Johnny Hartman, and Mel Tormé are the ones whose names still resonate. Of these, I am guessing that it was Chris Connor, a big deal in the 1950s, who paid many of the label’s bills.\n\nVisually, Bethlehem sets are all over the map but here are some of my favorite match-ups of great albums with memorable sleeves. I will get to most of these LP’s here some day:\n\nMusic\n\nIt is a vast understatement to call Charles Mingus “difficult.” But, Mingus was also a really sharp guy, a brilliant composer, and a bandleader of strength and conviction. If anything, his strengths in those two regards are so strong that his supreme skills as a bassist have been under recognized (as it should be, come to think of it, since he is playing in service to his music). He was recognized in the jazz community as a game-changing bassist right away and was a professional musician starting in his teens.\n\nJust consider that at the dawn of the 1950s, Mingus had actually quit music for the straight life when vibraphonist Red Norvo talked him into joining his new, foreword-thinking Bop trio with guitarist Tal Farlow. Without a piano or drums to back things up Norvo knew that Mingus’ bass would be all the foundation the band would need.\n\nBethlehem, Atlantic, and other labels had already put out some fine Mingus albums but East Coasting really starts capturing the bassist as a bandleader and composer. He drew some notice for his long-standing N.Y.C. Jazz Workshop but wouldn’t really break out to a wider audience until the very end of the 1950s when he was backed by Columbia, an industry powerhouse who also took Miles, Brubeck, and Ellington to their greatest levels of popularity.\n\nIronically, instead of an original Mingus composition, East Coasting starts with a reading of the standard “Memories of You.” Its a very mellow way to start an uptempo album but its just mesmerizing and flat-out gorgeous. Trumpeter Clarence Shaw and trombonist Jimmy Knepper trade off mournful solos and, then, around 1:45 , Mingus’ charts come in, showing off those shimmering Ellington color waves he would use for the rest of his career. Saxophonist Shafi Hadi solos after the bridge and ups the energy level without destroying the romantic melancholy. These guys were all members of Mingus’ working band at the time and you would think all would go on to major careers based on their work here.\n\n“Memories Of You” is a very 1950s jazz ballad — and all the better for it. The funky, sharp “East Coasting” is a tougher ode to ’50s bop even as it points the way towards wilder Mingus sounds. Its also good place to bring up pianist Bill Evans – the only time he’d play with Mingus. Evans’ solo here is lean and propulsive but a little left of center – a good description of the entire album. “West Coast Ghost,” an ode to California sunshine disappearing in NYC shadows, starts off with Mingus’ bass and compares favorably to similar work Gil Evans would do on cuts such as “La Nevada” and “Las Vegas Tango” — dark, cinematic and unsettling without being off-putting (again, there is also some Ellington in here as well). The crime scenes melt away for a romantic interlude led by Shaw’s tasteful trumpet before the action starts up again. This one is a real epic at over ten minutes but it speeds by — I get enraptured by the scenes it creates.\n\nOver on the flip side, “Celia” was written for Mingus’ wife at the time, who Nat Hentoff goes out of his way to praise in the liner notes. After divorcing Mingus Celia headed home to California, got a job at Fantasy Records, and went on to produce Oscar-winning feature films with her second husband Saul Zaentz. She then made her own music, art, and environmental documentaries after they split up. I first heard “Celia” on 1963’s Mingus, Mingus, Mingus where it is given a snazzier swing treatment — possibly the dreamy, laid-back reading here was just too romantic for him after they divorced in ’58. The next tune, “Conversation,” really points the way towards where Mingus was heading. While it starts in the bop vein it can’t stay in one place and it keeps changing directions — from complex and fast when everyone plays in unison to lean and medium tempo when everyone solos. Everyone just sounds near perfect.\n\nThe album ends with the mainstream, sauntering “51st Street Blues” — which is more finger-snapping Blue Note mainstream than you’d usually think of Mingus. Once again everyone shines though maybe top honors go to Knepper and Evans. This tune is an ode to the Mingus family’s adopted NYC neighborhood — Charles went from feeling like both a “West Coast Ghost” to someone who belonged in his new city.\n\nEast Coasting is a special album and remains under heard. Most probably because the Bethlehem catalogue was out-of-print for so long. Interestingly, Mingus recorded the more far-out and adventurous Tijuana Moods around the same time but it went unreleased for several years. By the end of the 1950s Mingus was a major jazz star but this album captures him when he was still striving to become one. There are easily more than a dozen of his LP’s I would recommend for any record collection — hopefully I can get to many more of them here.\n\nAlong the lines of Stan Getz, I love listening to Charles Mingus’ music but am glad I didn’t have to deal with him. For examples of this look at the careers of the superb musicians on East Coasting — only Bill Evans, who was just sitting in on the session, went on to stardom. Mingus rightly praises his musicians in the album liner notes but he was infamously tough, unfair, and sometimes out-right brutal with his fellow musicians.\n\nTake trumpeter Clarence Shaw, a real talent. Mingus was so hard on Shaw that it destroyed his self-confidence and got him to quit music. Trombonist Jimmy Knepper was beaten twice by Mingus (for nothing) — once so badly that he broke a tooth and had to relearn how to play his instrument. Saxophonist Shafi Hadi is still with us, about to enter his 90s, but his music career didn’t extend much beyond his outstanding work with Mingus here. Leave it to drummer Danny Richmond, who played with Mingus until the bassist died, young, of ALS in 1979 (ALS is still widely known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease). I have no idea if Mingus was always decent to his drummer or if Richmond just thought the consistently artistic results were worth it. Richmond would carry on his band leader’s compositions, arrangements, and legacy long after Mingus passed away.\n\nPeople are complicated and Mingus openly suffered from mental illness (he even institutionalized himself during this 1950s period). He was also capable of great kindness and gentleness. As an example of this, he helped organize, and participate in, musician-led hospice care for Paul Desmond, a brilliant saxophonist (and fellow West Coaster transplanted to New York City) who was the bassist’s opposite in pretty much every way. White and upper middle class, Desmond had his own demons but dealt with them in a different way. A native San Franciscan, Desmond grew up in the dark shadow of a mentally ill mother and was often separated from his parents. Paul Desmond dealt with this by being charming, witty, and somewhat emotionally detached from the wider world that Mingus was passionately at war with.\n\nA quick listen to “Audrey,” “Take Five,” or “Desmond Blue” reveals that Paul Desmond was a major jazz composer but he preferred to be a star soloist and leave the fuss and fight of being a bandleader to Dave Brubeck. Charles Mingus fought with everybody and everything. Thankfully, he was obsessed with using music to communicate what every one of his frazzled nerves felt. That isn’t something that one thinks of as a West Coast legacy but I get the feeling that Mingus would have had to communicate these storms of emotion no matter what coast he lived on.\n\n— Nick Dedina"
