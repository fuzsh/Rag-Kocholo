        "text": "Associate Professor of English\n\nBiography\n\nUNLV English professor Jessica Teague is an expert in American culture, researching the intersections of literature, sound, and technology.\n\nTeague received the American Book Award in 2022 for Sound Recording Technology and American Literature, from the Phonograph to the Remix (Cambridge UP, 2021). Her work tackles questions about the relationship between listening and literacy, considering how sound mediates issues of race and how America hears itself.\n\nIn her other publications, Teague writes about modern and contemporary American theater and jazz. She has authored works about literary figures such as John Dos Passos, August Wilson, and Amiri Baraka, as well as jazz musicians Charles Mingus and Sidney Bechet. Her work has appeared in American Quarterly, Sound Studies, and MELUS. Currently, she is working on a book about jazz in Las Vegas."
