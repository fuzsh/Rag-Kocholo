        "text": "jimmy-scott.JPG\n\nCleveland native and jazz legend Jimmy Scott passed away. He leaves behind a legacy of music and personal triumph.\n\n(The Plain Dealer)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Jimmy Scott, the Cleveland native whose unique, refined voice and gentle demeanor made him an international jazz star, passed away in his sleep in his Las Vegas home on Thursday. He was 88. Scott died from a cardiac arrest, according to his wife, Jeanie Scott.\n\nScott was born and raised in Cleveland, the third-oldest of 10 children. He got his start singing in local clubs as a teenager. It led to gigs around the Midwest and the South – and helped land him in Lionel Hampton's orchestra from 1949-51, when he scored his first hit with \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool.\"\n\n\"Little Jimmy Scott,\" as he was often called, performed with jazz legends Charlie Parker, Lester Young and Charles Mingus. He was little – less than 5 feet tall until an 8-inch growth spurt in his mid-30s. His delicate features matched his feminine voice, due to Kallmann's Syndrome, a rare hormone deficiency that resulted in Scott never going through puberty.\n\nScott's beautiful voice, fine falsetto and unique rhythms found such fans as Billie Holiday, Nancy Wilson, Dinah Washington and Big Maybelle. As Ray Charles once said, \"Jimmy was singing soul way back before the word was being used.\"\n\nBut Scott's greatest feat was to transcend -- despite years of being seemingly absent from the music scene.\n\nHe went solo in 1951 and released his debut album four years later. By the mid-1960s, he walked away from the frustrations of dealing with record labels.\n\nScott kept on recording, however, putting out solo efforts in the late '60s and mid-'70s that languished in obscurity. He was worked regular jobs to make ends meet – like a gig in the shipping and receiving department of the former Cleveland Sheraton Hotel on Public Square.\n\nHe lived in Euclid with his wife, Jeanie, until 2007, when they moved to Las Vegas for health reasons.\n\n\"He was a great talent, but a greater human being,\" said Jeanie Scott, from their home in Las Vegas. \"He was an angel who was always giving.\"\n\n\"Jimmy lived a hard life -- his mother died when he was very young. And he was wronged many times by the music industry.\"\n\n\"But Jimmy was never bitter,\" she added. \"He appreciate all the love his fans gave him and always considered himself lucky -- he was always full of love.\"\n\nFuneral services will take place in Cleveland, she said. A date has yet to be determined.\n\nScott enjoyed a revival at an age when most musicians are retiring. It started when the 65-year-old Scott sang at the funeral of Doc Pomus in 1991. Scott's unique, otherworldly voice caught the ear of record-industry executive Seymour Stein.\n\nBy 1992, Scott was back on tour, singing to support his 1992 Grammy-nominated comeback album, \"All the Way.\"\n\n\"Babe, it's not about the money,\" Scott told former Plain Dealer reporter John Soeder in a 2002 interview. \"It's about expanding your scope.\"\n\nScott expanded the scope of what is possible, by overcoming not only illness, but age.\n\nHe made up for lost time by releasing a number of his own recordings, as well as singing on Lou Reed's \"Magic and Loss\" album and performing with Michael Stipe. Scott also appeared in the series finale of David Lynch's TV series, \"Twin Peaks,\" to sing the song \"Sycamore Trees.\"\n\nScott will always be remembered for a voice that would make people close their eyes and dream. An otherworldly cadence that would make poets get out their pens and put words to paper.\n\nBehind both was a man who managed to turn the unlikely into the possible and make it sound divine."
