        "text": "Comfortable anonymity may not be the aim for most jazz musicians, but for bassist Charlie Harris, who has died aged 87 of cancer, his 13-year stint with singer Nat King Cole's touring support group must have seemed like a dream come true.\n\nHarris had come to Cole's attention after working with the rumbustious Lionel Hampton orchestra. He was an active participant in a number of Cole's racial integration initiatives, including the singer's breakthrough to national television in the late 1950s with The Nat King Cole Show. He was also on hand for the infamous concert in Birmingham, Alabama, when the stage was stormed by members of the White Citizens Council, angered by Cole's presence and the backing given him by the all-white British big band led by Ted Heath.\n\nHarris was from Alexandria in Virginia, but was brought up in Baltimore, where his father worked in the steel mills. Like many African-American youngsters, he took up music while at school, first playing the violin and then the bass while attending Douglass High School. Harris later took a degree in education at Coppin State College and taught at elementary level while continuing to play night-time gigs with the Royal Men of Rhythm and Tracy's Kentuckians. He finally gave up teaching in 1944 to join Lionel Hampton's big band, then riding high with hit records such as Flying Home and Hamp's Boogie-Woogie. Although hugely popular, Hampton's men still had to endure many indignities and racial slurs, especially when travelling around the south. \"You always had that little feeling of not being wanted,\" Harris remembered.\n\nFor a period he shared bass duties with the mercurial Charles Mingus, who was brought into the band by Hampton to play solo passages. Although largely relegated to playing rhythm while Mingus soloed, Harris claimed that the younger man's composition, Mingus Fingers, featured by Hampton, had been written for him. Tiring of incessant travel, Harris left Hampton after five years to return to Baltimore where he hooked up with ex-Hampton guitarist Billy Mackel and a singer to form a successful club act called Three Strikes And A Miss.\n\nWithin a year, Harris's high-grade musicianship was given far wider exposure when he joined Cole's entourage, staying with the singer until shortly before his death in 1965. There were extended tours of Europe - including Britain - and Australia, as well as recording opportunities, one of the best the all-star jazz album After Midnight (1956). Harris was also the un-intending pioneer in the desegregation of the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas where Cole was performing for an extended season. The bassist was light-skinned enough to pass for white and was dining in the hotel restaurant when a fuss was made about racial mixing. After Cole threatened to pull out of the engagement, all difficulties were overcome.\n\nIt was Cole who introduced the Harris to wealthy Baltimore furniture dealer Stanley Fradkin. The two became friends and Harris left music to work for Fradkin as a salesman until his retirement in the late 1970s. He continued to teach and play.\n\nHarris's wife Helen predeceased him; he is survived by his daughter Charlene and two grandchildren."
