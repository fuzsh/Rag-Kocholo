        "text": "Tri Town Get Down - Tri-Cities' exclusive music and community festival - will be taking over the John Dam Plaza in Richland from June 7 through June 9.\n\nKnown last year as \"Uptown Get Down,\" the festival - presented by Unleashed Entertainment, FUSE, and The Emerald of Siam - has rebranded and expanded to truly celebrate the Eastern Washington community. Ten stages will be spread across Richland with amazing artists and performers for all tastes and age ranges.\n\nThat includes Nathan James, a \"Nu-Nu Metal Artist\" with a unique creative vibe.\n\nTri Town Get Down will also celebrate the diversity of Tri-Cities and its shared culture with mini-festivals called \"Fusions\" including Latin Fusion, Industry Fusion, STEM Fusion, Food Fusion, Farmers Fusion, and Ferment-Fusion.\n\nThe \"TTGD\" festival aims to do more than have fun: it also aims to boost the local economy (with over $100,000 in income), empower local artists, and grow to become one of the hottest events in Washington state."
