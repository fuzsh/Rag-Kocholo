        "text": "When Eric Mingus was a boy in the 1970s, his father Charles Mingus took the family from their home in New York to visit Los Angeles, where the legendary jazz musician and composer had spent the first half of his life.\n\n“It was definitely hugely influential,” Eric Mingus says of the role of Los Angeles in his father’s life and career. “The whole reason why he started playing bass from cello was because of his friends that he grew up with.”\n\nMingus, who would have turned 100 on April 22 of this year, grew up in the Watts neighborhood. One of Eric Mingus’s clearest memories of the trip was visiting Watts Towers, which the artist Simon Rodia began in 1921, a year before Mingus was born.\n\n“It was a huge deal,” Eric Mingus says by phone from New Mexico. “He pointed out stuff that he had picked up as a kid and was part of the towers. My dad as a kid used to bring him stuff, things like hubcaps they found.\n\n“He literally showed me like, ‘These pieces here, I brought that and this.’ They hung out there a lot. So for sure, it had a big influence on him being as creative in the way he thought.\n\n“Not just Watts Towers, that society,” says Mingus, at 57, a year older than his father was at his death in 1979. “Where he grew up in Watts it was very important for some parents to make sure their kids had a music education.”\n\nEric Mingus hasn’t done many interviews about his father, tired of questions about Charles Mingus’s temper, depression, violence and other subjects not strictly about his brilliance as a bassist and bandleader.\n\nBut when the University of California, Irvine invited him to join a virtual panel titled “Centennial: 100 Years of Charles Mingus,” Eric Mingus said yes.\n\nOthers including saxophonist Charles McPherson, who played in Mingus’s band for more than a decade, and Morris Eagle, who promoted Mingus’s early concerts, are also on the program that begins at 5 p.m. on Jan. 26. (To register for the free event go to Eventbrite.com and search for Charles Mingus.)\n\n“Because it’s his 100th birthday, and I feel maybe it’d be healing for me to sort of embrace it a little bit too, I’ll give it a shot,” Mingus says.\n\nGrowing up Mingus\n\nEric Mingus never knew his father as anything but the talented, admired, if not always understood, musician that Charles Mingus was.\n\n“We’d go as kids to the shows and gigs and rehearsals, so it was very present that he was where he was in his career,” he says. “But at that time there were also naysayers and people not necessarily accepting his music. He wasn’t then what he is now.”\n\nEric Mingus, a singer and bassist, started like his father on the cello, with Charles Mingus teaching him the classical method he’d also learned as a boy.\n\n“I should also say that when I moved on to another cello teacher I got in trouble for all the things he taught, like expressing yourself in music,” he says with a laugh.\n\nHis father also taught him to follow his own creative instincts even in the face of criticism. At times, Charles Mingus faced hurdles because of his mixed-race ethnicity – too Black for some, not Black enough for others, Eric Mingus says.\n\n“He had mixed-race bands and women in his band in that time,” he says of the way Charles Mingus looked at the world. “In his world, if you could play the music, you could stay.”\n\nIn the years before his death, the neurological disease ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, slowly took his ability to play instruments. But he continued to work on projects, including the Joni Mitchell album “Mingus, ” which spread his popularity beyond jazz.\n\n“I was there at the table when they met in Manhattan,” Eric Mingus says of his father and Mitchell. “You know, there’s something that was never really clear to me. I always thought that my father was making a record and then she was going to be on it.\n\nHe adds that he thinks there are still unreleased tracks from the “Mingus” sessions still unheard by the public.\n\n“I was at sessions that I’d never heard again,” Mingus says.\n\n“I remember Stanley Clarke coming in and playing bass, and there being cassettes my father was listening to that were of that,” he says, quickly adding that bassist Jaco Pastorius, who is on the album, and the rest of Mitchell’s “Mingus” band were fantastic.\n\nHe also remembers his father having someone hand Mitchell sheet music, and her response: “Oh, I can’t read that, that’s like chicken scratch to me.”\n\n“My dad kind of grimaced,” he says. “But they eventually got through it, and they really cared for each other.”\n\nSideman stories\n\nAlto saxophonist Charles McPherson left Detroit for New York City at 19 or 20, heading there in 1959 with his trumpeter pal Lonnie Hillyer in search of a decent-paying band.\n\n“I had enough money to go there for a month, maybe two months, just long enough to see if I could get with a name band,” says McPherson, 82, from his San Diego home. “Just as my money was about to run out, Yusef Lateef, a Detroit tenor player, told Lonnie and myself that Mingus was needing a trumpet player and an alto sax player.”\n\nMingus was told he could catch McPherson and Hillyer at a regular afternoon jam session at a coffeehouse in the Village, and one afternoon in late 1959 in he walked.\n\n“He came up on the bandstand and asked the leader of the session, ‘Can I play one?’” McPherson says. “We played, and Mingus said, ‘OK, you guys are hired. So that evening we played a club he was playing in. And that was the beginning of that.”\n\nThough not without a bunch of nerves that first night, McPherson says.\n\n“It was pretty intimidating,” he says. “We were maybe 20 years old, and Mingus almost 40 at the time. And he’s an imposing figure. I mean, he’s 300 pounds at that time, and close to 6 feet tall. And he had a reputation for being confrontational and actually engaging in fisticuffs with people.\n\n“So we knew this was a dangerous gig, but, you know, very young and it worked out really well.”\n\nMingus, born between saxophonist Charlie “Bird” Parker and trumpeter Miles Davis, came of age along with bebop jazz in the ’40s. With influences such as Duke Ellington and Jimmy Blanton, one of the first virtuoso jazz bassists, Mingus grew past that into his own sound, McPherson says.\n\n“The musical soup that sort of makes Mingus who he is, is Jimmy Blanton, a lot of Duke Ellington, a real nice dose of Charlie Parker and the beboppers, and of course the Western classical music and tradition,” McPherson says.\n\n“You mix all that up, you add the ingredients of what Mingus came wired with himself, that’s him, and that’s how you get a Mingus.”\n\nPutting on a show\n\nMorris Eagle was midway through his doctorate for clinical psychology in New York City when in the early ’50s the “frustrated non-musician” came up with a crazy idea to work with the jazz musicians he admired.\n\n“I remember thinking that if classical musicians could have concerts, why can’t jazz musicians?” says Eagle, 93, from his home in Marina Del Rey. “It’s as fine a quality of music as any classical music.”\n\nSo he picked up his telephone and cold-called the editors of Downbeat and Metronome, the jazz magazines of the day, and got Bill Coss of Downbeat on the line.\n\n“Instead of either hanging up or laughing at me he said, ‘You know who would be interested in that? Mingus,’” Eagle says. ” ‘He’s so tired of playing at clubs with all the noise and the drinking.’ So he said, ‘Let me give you Mingus’s phone number.’ “\n\nTheir first show was held in Carnegie Recital Hall and went over well. Next was the larger venue of Town Hall, where Eagle invited pianist Thelonious Monk to join the band for a concert that required no cabaret license, which Monk had lost after a drug bust, which sidelined him from the clubs.\n\n“Then, again in this incredibly naive way, I say, ‘What if I call Steve Allen” — the first host of NBC’s “The Tonight Show” and a jazz pianist himself — and see if we can get the group on coast-to-coast TV?,” Eagle says.\n\nAnd, of course, that worked too.\n\nCoda\n\nEric Mingus says the music he most connects to is “the music that no one’s heard, but me and maybe my sister Keki, him at home playing piano, playing bass, and those melodies.”\n\nBut the most powerful music he ever heard his father play came in the unlikely venue of a music store on 48th Street in New York City, against a backdrop of racial bias that Mingus confronted, challenged and wrote music about throughout his life.\n\nEric Mingus was only 7 or 8 when he and his father went into the city from their home in upstate New York to buy a cello.\n\n“They were sort of really not nice to him,” Mingus says of the White men behind the counters. “He said, ‘I want to buy my son a cello, and the way they looked at him, it was really awful, and I was upset. I wanted to go.”\n\nBut his father persevered, Mingus says, and asked to see one of the cellos hanging on the wall.\n\n“He sat down, and they handed him the bow almost sarcastically,” he says. “And he started playing, and the whole place went dead quiet. He played for 20 minutes, solo. He got up, he paid for it, he walked out.\n\n“They had no clue, like, who he was or anything, but that’s what turned it around. And I walked out really proud.”"
