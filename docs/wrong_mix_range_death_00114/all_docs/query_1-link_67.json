        "text": "A music superstar is headed to Iowa later this year! P!NK LIVE 2024 is coming to Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines!\n\nPink is set to take the stage in Des Moines on Thursday, October 24th, 2024 at 7:30 p.m. With nine studio albums and more than 55 radio singles, her setlist is bound to be pretty long!\n\nSo, what can fans expect from Pink at her Iowa concert? The Wells Fargo Arena website reads:\n\n\"Fans can anticipate an electrifying performance from P!NK, featuring an epic, high-energy setlist packed with her greatest hits, including 'So What,' 'TRUSTFALL,' 'Just Give Me A Reason,' and many more. The tour's production promises to dazzle with P!NK's dramatic entrance from the rafters, breathtaking aerial acrobatics, energetic dance routines, and dynamic costume changes.\"\n\nOpening the show for Pink are openers The Script and KidCutUp. The Script is an Irish rock band that has had several big radio hits, including \"Breakeven,\" \"Hall of Fame,\" and \"The Man Who Can't Be Moved.\" KidCutUp is a DJ and producer that will entertain the crowd before the concert begins.\n\nAnother cool feature of the concert is that proceeds from the event will support Girls Rock! Des Moines, \"an organization dedicated to empowering cis-girls, women, non-binary, and trans youth and adults through self-expression, creative agency, and mentoring in music and arts-based education.\""
