        "text": "LYRICS\n\nWell here I am right back where I was yesterday\n\nAnd the day before, and the day before that\n\nSitting on a high barstool\n\nHolding my dreams up to the sound of Jazz music\n\nI live uptown, where? I dont exactly know\n\nIm always downtown\n\nAnd it seems I’m always with the blues\n\nI talk to myself in public places and hum Jazz tunes\n\nI love Jazz\n\nBut soon I have to make it uptown\n\nTo that old furnished room of mine\n\nI guess thats why I stall so long downtown\n\nBut I like the Cafe bars down here\n\nEspecially the ones across the street from theartres\n\nI once wanted to be on the stage\n\nBut this is the closest I’ll ever get to one\n\nI couldnt afford a seat next to the ceiling\n\nThat was Jazz music you heard blastin out\n\nNow I got fifteen cents between me and starvation\n\nI’ll prolly hafta walk all the way uptown\n\nCause I’m playin that music again\n\nYou see…..I love Jazz music\n\nDoo do do dooooo (slow & sad muted trumpet)\n\nDoooo da da di dooooo……..Daaaaaaaaaaa!\n\nThats pretty music boy\n\nBut it aint “really” pretty\n\nIt aint like girls in magazines\n\nIts beautiful…..its terribly beautiful man\n\nSay…like a woman you might of been with last night\n\nOr say maybe an hour ago\n\nDooo da da di doooo ( Sad muted trumpet again)\n\nDoooo da da dee daaa da!\n\nSad huh?\n\nSorta reminds me of that old building I live in\n\nMy room,…… looking out over lonely waters\n\nDooo dee dee da dooo( Trumpet picks up, cymbals & Bass start walking faster and faster louder and louder)\n\nNow catch this!\n\n( Cymbals crash)\n\nDig!\n\n( whole band comes in now with swing and gusto!)\n\nBada dee dee ba da da doo da!\n\nBada dee dee be da da doo da!\n\n( band plays on for a little while….free but together)\n\nNow here I am standing in this old building\n\nIt’s night time in the city\n\nI sure wish I could just relax and be cool\n\nBut it’s just like my mother says\n\n“Dont cause nuthin ya wish jack”\n\nNow here comes Bob with a mouth full of jive\n\nI know hes comin right here\n\n” Yeah I hear ya talkin Jim, no company tonight man,\n\nno man my record machine is in the pawn shop,\n\nman stop talkin so loud, before you wake my land lady up and she remebers I havent paid my rent in three weeks”\n\n“Oh man who cares” (yelling in the background)\n\n“Go man go!” (landlady starts in to yelling about rent)\n\n“Why dont everbody please stop that noise” ( pots, pans and cans crashing now)\n\n“Please stop all the confusion” (Landlady,Bob, and the pots still being loud)\n\n“Please just let me be cool man!!!” ( Noise is unbearable now)\n\n“Please get away from my door!!!” (oh s***, gonna snap,,,any minute!!)\n\n“Will you please go!!!” (Noise starts to recede…slowly)\n\n“I just want to be cool man” ( finally quiet…again…fer now)\n\nMan you oughta see this old room of mine\n\nEvery morning I wake up and look around me\n\nAnd I keep thinkin\n\nI must’ve died a hundred years during the night\n\nAnd I wonder about that jack, yes I wonder\n\nLike how I ever got here\n\nBecause I dont have any plans of dying that fast\n\nI guess I’m the only man in the world who wakes up too Jazz music in the morning\n\nI guess, i cant say exactly why\n\nI guess I find it solemn…\n\nLike a hymn\n\nYa know I had to prove that to my mother when I was living back home\n\nI’d wake up to them sounds\n\nMom didnt dig, she just didnt go for it\n\nBird, Miles, Max… she just couldnt see it\n\nMorning, afternoon, night or anytime\n\nThat is until I played her some monk one night,late\n\nRound Midnight\n\nI played her some monk\n\nThelonious that is\n\nNow Mom spends many of her nights in tunisia\n\n(Trumpet starts in again,un-muted, soaring and somber yet still swinging…slow)\n\n( Now a sax comes in and starts conversating with a muted trumpet)\n\n(Now everyone starts to walk and swing)\n\n(Slow muted trumpets pauses all, says a few things here and there,no one listens)\n\nYeah! Early in the morning time, late in the night time\n\nI’m with the blues\n\nSometimes Im laughing and having myself a ball\n\nAnd thats why Bob keeps telling the blues aint all up there in my old room\n\nBut sometimes it dances and struts like a woman\n\nSkips and hops like children playing ball\n\nand maybe thats why I always manage to change once in a while\n\nEven with the blues\n\nAnd wether I like it or not I love the idea of living\n\nBut sometymes its tough man\n\nAnd I dont mean tough like when Miles is grooving with his horn\n\nI mean tough like when I cant make that morning meal\n\nWhen I’m ducking the landlady\n\nWhen everything I have is in hock\n\nLike when I think of all the places I havent been\n\nAnd wont ever likely get there\n\nBut I think maybe I will\n\nYes, thats the way I think\n\nLike the song says\n\nThe sun will shine thru my back door someday\n\nAll the way down to the bottom of my stomach and back up again\n\nYes thats the way I feel\n\nDoo da da da deeeeee ( slow muted trumpet again…sad)\n\nDeee da da da dee daaaa\n\ndoooooooooooooo"
