        "text": "Unlike Don Juan's Reckless Daughter (an album that I avoided buying for a few years), I jumped on Mingus when it was released. When I read that the band was essentially Weather Report with Herbie sitting in for Zawinul, I wasted no time getting my hands on this album.\n\nOverall, I found much of the album to be a bit off-putting. Once I arrived at the end of the album, two songs jumped out at me (and they remain my go-to Mingus tracks): \"Dry Cleaner from Des Moines\" and \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\".\n\nDry Cleaner:\n\nBeing a big Jaco fan (in addition to a Joni fan), \"Dry Cleaner\" knocked me off my feet. What a great track! Besides Jaco's engaging bass line, this track reveals Jaco's fascination with big band arrangements. The musicians in the horn section are not credited, but this is certainly much bigger than a standard 3 piece horn section. [When I saw Jaco 2 years later in NYC, he had a 17 piece horn section!] Jaco excelled in this milieu and this track vibrates with his love for large horn arrangements. While his 1976 self-titled debut hinted this love of horns (\"Come On Come Over\"), his 1981 follow-up Word of Mouth made that love very apparent (especially \"Liberty City\" and \"John and Mary\"). Lyrically, I loved that Joni mentioned Circus Circus because I have fond memories of visiting that Las Vegas casino as a kid just after it opened. This is a song that I cannot just listen to once - I have to play it multiple times back to back.\n\nDry Cleaner is easily among my top 10 Joni songs (perhaps even #1). I enjoy Shorter's understated soprano solo. So much to love about this song!\n\nGoodbye Pork Pie Hat:\n\nAt the time of release, I knew who Mingus was but had never heard anything of his music. The only version of this song that I had heard previously was Jeff Beck's gorgeous 1976 rendition on Wired. Obviously, this version is dramatically different from that one. However, I am quite fond of Joni's version. Herbie Hancock's Rhodes work is wonderful. Another understated contribution Shorter on soprano. As someone who doesn't focus on Joni's lyrics nearly as much as the music, this is one that I find myself paying close attention to the words.\n\n-------------\n\nMingus is not an album that I consume as a single piece. However, the above mentioned tracks I listen to quite often.\n\nThis album was recorded as Jaco was beginning to \"lose it\". He didn't lose his connection to reality all-at-once: it happened slowly over the course of years. A few months before Mingus was released, Jaco joined John McLaughlin and drummer Tony Williams (they called themselves the \"Trio of Doom\") in Havana for a live date. Things didn't go well (Jaco was drunk during the show). A few days later, the trio tried to record tracks in NYC and that failed. Jaco battled with Tony Williams (a man with a sizable ego who didn't put up with Jaco's shenanigans). In retrospect, the Trio of Doom experience is one of the first Jaco episodes that showed he occassionally progressed past being a \"character\" into being a \"problem\". He would experience periods of unhinged behavior during the following years. Eventually, the problem episodes became more common and he was thrown out of Weather Report in 1982. The succeeding 5 years were a spiraling down into addiction, paranoia, homelessness and eventually death (in 1987).\n\nJaco's work with Joni was perhaps the highlight of his career. The combination of those two artists created music that was sensational. It should be noted that the man (Larry Klein) that took over the bass slot for Joni was deeply influenced by Jaco.\n\nWell, to each their own! I certainly regard JM as one of the greats, have essentially everything she's ever recorded and been listening to her for over 40 years, so I'm not a casual listener. In fact, I bought Mingus when it was released.\n\nTo me, the 'shame' is that she took CM's musical tribute to a dear friend and turned it into a 'song' about herself. To me that was unnecessary. She certainly could have used those lyrics with a melody of her own design and created her own LY tribute by way of CM's inspiration, but that's what she chose to do. And I do feel she subverts the melodic line... She starts each verse fairly true to the melodic line but then ends up shoehorning in whole sentences to try to complete her narrative. And as someone said re. God Must be a Boogie Man, the lyrics do veer into the cringeworthy on occasion, even considering when they were written.\n\nBut as the saying goes, YMMV!\n\nI like the Shadows and Light version better, too. Maybe, we should have a thread on Joni's live albums.\n\nJust listened to orginal - it's fantasic. Also, Tony McManus does a beautiful acoustic guitar version on Ceol More. Sorry, that's more my kind of thing than the Jeff Beck version\n\nIf Wikipedia is to be believed, Mingus heard all the completed tracks with the exception of God Must Be a Boogie Man. Therefore, it seems likely he approved of what Joni did with Goodbye Pork Pie Hat. Unless he didn't care about the music by then and just wanted to ensure his wife benefited from some extra royalty payments.\n\nThe Wolf That lives in Lindsey is an absolute genius piece of art. In my top 10 Joni Mitchell works. I would go as far as saying it is the Joni Mitchell track I would take with me onto a desert island. There's no point arguing about this one though, as self-evidently it is not going to have the hidden appeal that somehow clicks with people; you either get it completely the first time you hear it or you can forget it. Obviously, I feel sorry for the fans that can't appreciate the genius here."
