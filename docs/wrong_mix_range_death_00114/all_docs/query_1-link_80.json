        "text": "South Louisiana is overflowing with incredible musicians and artists. One of our own, Julian Primeaux, was inducted into The Louisiana Hall of Fame on Friday.\n\nPrimeaux's passion for guitar started at age 8, and before you knew it, he was performing live consistently by age 12. He never slowed down from there, releasing albums and playing festivals and shows across the country and Louisiana. In 2022, he became a Grammy Nominee for performing on Corey Ledet's Nominated album.\n\nNow being inducted into the Louisiana Hall of Fame, it's safe to say that the inner 8-year-old boy who first picked up a guitar is proud.\n\nJulien Primeaux recently used his talents to calm and soothe animals that were rescued by Acadiana Animal Aid.\n\nPrimeaux kicked off the new volunteer program called Music and Mutts.\n\n\"Music is a powerful tool that can induce relaxation, lower anxiety, and relieve stress for animals,\" the organization stated in a Facebook post. \"The shelter environment can be overwhelming for many homeless pets, but with a live performance like this, our dogs not only calmed down but also got to enjoy a new, mentally engaging activity.\"\n\nHow to Apply for Music & Mutts\n\nIf you're a musician interested in participating in the Music & Mutts program, Acadiana Animal Aid encourages you to reach out via email at volunteer@acadianaanimalaid.org.\n\nThe program aims to collaborate with local musicians who are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of shelter animals."
