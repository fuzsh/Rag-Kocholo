Any input would be much appreciated.\n\nStrollin' (following the verse) is indeed \"Nostalgia In Times Square\". As I\n\nunderstand it, \"Nostalgia\" is the tune as originally composed by Mingus; the\n\nvocal versions take the title \"Strollin'\" from the lyric later added by\n\nvocalist Honey Gordon's father George (also known as Nat Gordon). The two\n\nGordons, along with Honey's two brothers, first recorded with Mingus in 1953\n\nfor his Debut label (when Honey was 15); she first recorded \"Strollin'\" at\n\nthe \"Mingus Dynasty\" sessions in late '59, although this version was not\n\nreleased until almost 20 years later, shortly after Mingus' death.\n\n--\n\nHenry L.\n\nhlo...@pipeline.com\n\n>Also, I am finding that I have most of the Mingus albums now.

But depending on what in particular you find\n\nmost appealing about Mingus, there are definitely some who seem to have\n\nrelated approaches, or at least related effects on me. One is Muhal\n\nRichard Abrams, but not all the time - see \"Blu Blu Blu\" for a good\n\nexample of one that is in some ways reminiscent of the more\n\n\"serious\" aspect of Mingus. Also, much of what I have from the\n\nEither/Orchestra reminds me of the \"fun\" aspect, as does, for that\n\nmatter, Sun Ra or John Zorn / Naked City, even if the actual music\n\ndoesn't really sound much the same (particularly in the case of Zorn!).\n\nWhat little I have heard of Django Bates also seems to come from\n\na similar perspective.\n\nBut note that none of these may *sound* much like Mingus; they just seem\n\nsimilar in some ways to me. Your mileage may vary.\n\n--\n\nMarc Sabatella\n\n--\n\nma...@outsideshore.com\n\nhttp://www.outsideshore.com/\n\nOn Sun, 30 Mar 1997 12:24:38 -0800, \"Steven P.

Lo and behold, we soon had Threadgill's\n\nSextett, Murray's Octet and Olu Dara's Okra Orchestra. I don't believe\n\nthe latter left a recorded legacy, but I think you'd enjoy Henry and\n\nDavid's work. I'd also second Marc Sabatella's picks cited above.\n\nCheers,\n\nBrian O.\n\nPersonally, trying to characterise Mingus's music, I think mainly of\n\nthe collective improvisation, the compositional structures, and the\n\nblues/folk tradition.\n\nThis is probably my ignorance, but the only person I can think of who\n\ncombines these elements in similar way is John Carter on, e.g. Castles Of\n\nGhana.\n\nInterestingly - and I suppose this is the uniqueness of Mingus - you\n\nhave to go quite far back from his time to get the same emphasis on\n\ncollective improvisation or quite far forward.\n\nCharles\n\nIn article <charles.day-02...@cday.gsfc.nasa.gov> charl...@gsfc.nasa.gov (Charles Day) writes:\n\n>Personally, trying to characterise Mingus's music, I think mainly of\n\n>the collective improvisation, the compositional structures, and the\n\n>blues/folk tradition.\n\n>\n\n>Interestingly - and I suppose this is the uniqueness of Mingus - you\n\n>have to go quite far back from his time to get the same emphasis on\n\n>collective improvisation or quite far forward.\n\nTristano and Brubeck were both working with collective improvisation\n\nand formal experiments in the 40s and 50s, not so far back at all.\n\nOlder musicians had never stopped working with collective improvisation.\n\nCompositional approaches to form were a major interest of late swing era\n\narrangers.

He was just doing it better than most others."
