        "text": "A dead dolphin was found on a south Louisiana beach and now authorities know why this dolphin may have washed up on shore.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Fisheries Service says that the bottlenose dolphin was located on a beach in Cameron Parish on March 13.\n\nOnce located, the carcass was taken to the Audubon Nature Institute in New Orleans for a necropsy.\n\nIt was there that they discovered that the dolphin had been shot. According to Fox 8 News, “multiple bullets lodged in the dolphin’s brain, spinal cord, and heart.”\n\nWith the discovery, authorities with the NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement are asking the public for help in identifying the subjects that may be responsible for shooting this dolphin\n\nA $20,000 reward is being offered to anyone with information in this case and that can lead authorities to the person(s) responsible.\n\nIf you have information on this case, contact authorities at (800) 853-1964.\n\nAccording to the report, \"Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, it is a crime to hunt, harass, capture, kill, or attempt to do so, to any marine mammal, including dolphins. Violators face up to $100,000 in fines and up to one year in jail per violation.\"\n\nWhat a sad scene from this Louisiana beach."
