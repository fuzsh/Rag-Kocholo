        "meta_description": "<p>Helmstedt in Lower Saxony is located on the border with Saxony-Anhalt and is a town rich in history. First attested to in writing in the year of 952, Helmstedt gained a town charter in 1247. Today, the district capital with its approximately 25,000 inhabitants comprises the historic town centre, adjoining settlements and the districts of Barmke, Emmerstedt, Bad Helmstedt, Offleben and Büddenstedt. In addition to almost 400 half-timbered houses and professors' houses from the 16th and 17th centuries, the Old Town of Helmstedt also has numerous sights alongside its Romanesque buildings. Helmstedt has always been characterised by trade. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the town belonged to the Hanseatic League. However, it was not only trade that made Helmstedt into an important town. The regional university, founded in 1576, played its part too. The Hanseatic and university town offers a wide range of retail, service, leisure and cultural activities. In the middle of the Elm-Lappwald Nature Park, you can find spots of recreation and relaxation as well as an extensive cycling and hiking trail network right on your doorstep. Just like Berlin, Helmstedt is a place which is heavily associated with unity and with the inner-German border. Located at the most important border crossing during the division of Germany, Helmstedt turned into a \"town of unity\" right in the heart of Europe. Our charming town is easy to reach by road or rail. Discover the \"Town of Unity\"– we look forward to seeing you.</p>",
