        "text": "The Juleum, also known as Juleum Novum, is a multi-storey lecture and library building located in the Lower Saxon county town of Helmstedt in Germany. This historic building was part of the former university and is a significant landmark in the region. It offers a glimpse into the architectural style of the Weser Renaissance and the educational history of the area.\n\nArchitectural Style of the Juleum\n\nConstructed between 1592 and 1612, the Juleum is a prime example of the Weser Renaissance architectural style. It is considered one of the most significant secular buildings of this era in Northern Germany. The building's design and construction details provide a unique insight into the architectural practices of the time.\n\nRenovation and Current Use of the Juleum\n\nBetween 1966 and 1971, the Juleum underwent extensive restoration and renovation. During this period, a new entrance area was created on the south side of the building. Additionally, the basement was converted into the current district and university museum, which now serves as a cultural and historical resource for visitors."
