        "text": "Helmstedt is one of several settlements surrounding the Elm mountain range, rich in a unique type of limestone known as \"Elm Limestone\" (German: Elmkalkstein) which was mined in medieval times as a building material. Limestone from the region was used for the tomb of Henry the Lion, the imperial cathedral of Königslutter, buildings in Berlin's Olympiapark, and numerous public and church buildings. In the Middle Ages Königslutter was among the most wealthy cities of the Holy Roman Empire. The city was a member of the Hanseatic League through the 15th and 16th centuries, and in 1576 the University of Helmstedt was founded, which was the largest university of protestant Germany.\n\nIn the nearby Lappwald forest, a natural spring was discovered around 1755, and a health resort was founded. The spa was a regionally important destination until the spring dried up around 1894, likely as a result of intensive lignite mining throughout the area.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the area between Helmstedt and Schöningen was used for lignite mining by the Braunschweigische Kohlenbergwerke AG. Several villages were destroyed by surface mining and their inhabitants moved to Helmstedt, Schöningen and to the newly built village of Neu Büddenstedt, later renamed Büddenstedt.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Helmstedt and its eastern neighbor Marienborn were best known as the largest checkpoint along the inner-German border during the division of Germany. Known by western allies as Checkpoint Alpha, the crossing was along one of the most direct Autobahn routes to West Berlin from West Germany. Today, museums and monuments in the area document this era, and some of the buildings on the former East German checkpoint grounds are a memorial site that offers exhibitions and site tours. Evidence of the checkpoint are also easy to see from the Autobahn, including an old watch tower, pillars that once held the emblem of the DDR in the centre median, and extensive rest areas on the western approach that were built by the government to accommodate delayed eastbound traffic."
