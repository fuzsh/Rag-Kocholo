        "text": "Helmstedt\n\nGermany\n\nHelmstedt, city, Lower Saxony Land (state), north-central Germany, east of Braunschweig (Brunswick). Probably founded in the 9th century, it was chartered in 1050, joined the Hanseatic League in 1426, and passed to Brunswick in 1490. In 1576 Julius, duke of Brunswick, founded a university there that became one of the chief seats of Protestant learning in the 17th century; closed in 1810 by Jérôme, king of Westphalia, it was incorporated into the University of Göttingen.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1990 Helmstedt was an important frontier post between East and West Germany. Its principal buildings are the Renaissance Juleum (1592–97), the former university; the 13th-century Stephans Church; and the former Ludgerian monastery (founded 9th century). The city’s chief products are brown coal, yarn, bricks, and machinery. Tourism, based on the city’s historic character and recreational opportunities in the area, also contributes to the local economy. Pop. (2003 est.) 25,664.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
