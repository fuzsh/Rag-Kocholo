I specialize in early modern cultural history of Northern Europe, more precisely within two research fields: (1) early modern religious dissent and (2) early modern notions of privacy.\n\nSince 2020, I hold a full-time position in the research programme at PRIVACY. I have conducted research on the Danish-German free town Altona (1750–1800) and the German university town Helmstedt (1620–1680). I have taken special interest in how people of early modern Europe went about to talk in private, as well as the role of outer doors in protection of notions of privacy. I am currently writing a book which critically discusses how the grand (outdated?) theories of privacy formulated between 1945 and 1965 have been used as both concepts of right and research tools.\n\nSince 2018, I am working on a fully-funded biography of the influential dissenter Johann Conrad Dippel (1673–1734), with special attention to his stay and impact in Sweden. This project has triggered an increasing interest for generational aspects of religious dissent in the 18th century. For this project, I am working with new media opportunities for three succeeding generations of Nordic dissenters: expanding epistolary networks, collections of hand-copied manuscripts, and the far-reaching freedoms of print."
