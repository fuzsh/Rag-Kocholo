        "text": "A mathematician who codes models of Antarctica and the Great Barrier Reef to better understand how to protect vulnerable ecosystems is one of 12 young Queensland scientists to receive a state award.\n\nDr Kate Helmstedt is a mathematician at the Queensland University of Technology, working on some of Australia's most at-risk environments to predict what can be done to conserve and protect them.\n\n\"I build computational models of Antarctica and the Great Barrier Reef so we can ask questions of the models,\" she said.\n\n\"Antarctica is massive … we don't know a lot about it, it's so expensive to get there. So how can we [for instance] use drones to collect better data in Antarctica?\"\n\nThe models she creates enable scientists to make better predictions and decisions about how to protect threatened ecosystems, and how humanity's impact on the planet affects each location.\n\nDr Helmstedt said while she would love to work in the field, it was \"a bit of a hard sell\" to send a mathematician to Antarctica.\n\n\"I work a lot with the people who go into these places, these ecologists and biologists who know so much about these systems,\" she said.\n\n\"I work with roboticists who know about the drones and the satellite imaging, and all these people who are really going into the field and getting the data. [But] I sit at home on a computer.\"\n\nSTEM recognition\n\nThis week Dr Helmstedt was one of 12 Queensland Young Tall Poppy award winners, recognising excellence in science and science communication among early career researchers.\n\nThe annual awards are hosted in each state by the Australian Institute of Policy and Science (AIPS).\n\nQueensland Chief Scientist Hugh Possingham said demand for science, technology, engineering and maths graduates was outstripping supply.\n\nData from the state government's State of Science report this year revealed Queensland only received 17 per cent of the Australian Research Centre's annual funding budget in 2019, with a relatively low number of research proposals submitted from the state.\n\nThe report also found Queenslanders aged 18-24 were generally less interested in science than other groups, and women were more likely to believe a career in science was easier for men.\n\nDr Helmstedt said women had always been interested in science and mathematics.\n\n\"The problem is not interest, the problem is getting the messaging that you can do it, you should do it, and it's fun and interesting and not sitting in a dusty room by yourself in the dark all of the time working alone,\" she said.\n\n\"Science and mathematics is this really collaborative and fun endeavour where you get to work with people and you get to impact the world.\"\n\nFrom biostatistics to diets\n\nUniversity of Queensland epidemiologist and biostatistician Dr Gary Chan was named the 2022 Queensland Young Tall Poppy of the Year for ground-breaking research on alcohol, tobacco and substance abuse in Australia's population.\n\nOther winners included Bond University Associate Professor Robin Orr, for research on injuries to frontline workers such as firefighters and police; and Dr Saman Khalesi from CQUniversity, for research into diets and dietary misinformation.\n\nDr Hemstedt said as someone with a life-long love of science and maths, winning an award that celebrated research and science communication was \"awesome\".\n\n\"It never occurred to me that being a mathematician was a job that a person could do until I was already at university,\" she said.\n\n\"Then I realised that this thing that I really loved was being a detective and asking questions about the world and … what's going on around us. I kind of realised that's what a scientist is and that's what a mathematician can do.\n\nQueensland Science Minister Meaghan Scanlon said the breakthroughs made by Dr Chan and the 11 other winners proved how vital funding was for the state's research sector.\n\n\"Their efforts are not only going to change the world, they're going to inspire the next generation of STEM leaders in Queensland,\" she said."
