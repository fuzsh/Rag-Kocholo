        "text": "On 29 February 2024 we held a special roadshow at Edinburgh Castle as part of our 10th anniversary celebrations!\n\nThe Governor of Edinburgh Castle, Major General Alastair Bruce of Crionaich, OBE DL VR welcomed students from across Scotland who have participated in NSI programmes to present their creative pieces to dignitaries including community leaders, members of the armed forces and MSPs attending the event. The young people reflected on a wide range of topics; from the centenary of the First World War to more recent conflicts. Military children also shared what it means to be a child of a serving parent. A powerful collective of youth voices, our future leaders and peace-keepers.\n\nThe following schools from across Scotland were represented: Gordonstoun School, Larbert High School, Elgin Academy, Lossiemouth High School, Colgrain Primary School, Hermitage Primary School, St. Leonards Primary School and Bell Baxter High School.\n\nDr Alice König, who spoke about the importance of including children in the peace building process, stated after the event:\n\nNSI’s 10th anniversary event at Edinburgh Castle on 29th Feb 2024 captured exactly what this amazing charity is all about. It provided a platform – and a very high-profile audience! – for young people from all over Scotland, to share poetry, speeches, song and art expressing their views on conflict. It was moving to hear children from service families not only finding their own voices but being inspired by NSI to empower others in their community to come together and share and speak. And we also heard such powerful words from junior and senior school students on the costs of war, the legacy of forced displacement and positive paths towards peace. It was clear from conversations at the reception afterwards that their words had hit home with so many different listeners, from military personnel to politicians. This is what NSI is all about: not just helping young people express their views but giving them opportunities to influence and inspire the adults around them, as advocates, activists and experts in their own right. I am amazed by what NSI has achieved over the last ten years, and excited about their potential to continue empowering young people and helping them to shape our future conversations on conflict. Thank you NSI!\n\nOur thanks go to the individuals that made this event such a success. These include the Governor of Edinburgh Castle, Major General Alastair Bruce of Crionaich, OBE DL VR, our President Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence KCVO, CB, CSM, ADC, Hilary Scott and the Castle staff, Piper - Major R T McCrindle SG, our fabulous photographer Jenny Catlow and every parent and teacher that supported the stars of the show.\n\nWe are also incredibly grateful to the Balmoral, Apex and Ritz hotels for their kind contributions.\n\nIn late February we had the pleasure of visiting the town of Helmstedt in Lower Saxony, Germany. This was our third time running poetry workshops in the area, which have taken place over the last two years, led by NSI Poet in Residence Clive Sanders. Helmstedt is twinned with Clive’s home town of Chard in Somerset and has a fascinating history, especially in regards to it's proximity to the old border between East and West Germany.\n\nOver two days we ran a series of poetry workshops at Giordano-Bruno-Gesamtschule, Gymnaisum Anna-Sophianeum and Gymansium Julianum, with young people of various ages and backgrounds. Participants were answering the question ‘how does war affect people’s lives?’ Several students had personal perspectives to share, while other looked at historical conflicts. Everyone approached the topic sensitively and showed great respect for their peers.\n\nOn Thursday 22nd February we hosted a poetry showcase event at the Juleum Novum in Helmstedt - a beautiful old university building. This was fantastic success, with students from the three school listed above sharing work, as well as Gymnasium am Bötschenberg. The words of the young people had a profound impact on the audience.\n\nA teacher from the Giordano-Bruno-Gesamtschule commented after the event:\n\n‘You know already how much I appreciate your workshops and how much I loved the event happening at the Juleum. Those poets we have in Helmstedt warmed everyone's hearts and made me cry. Even the parents came and were so proud of their children which was an amazing experience both for them and us.’\n\nWe would like to thank Harald and Gabi Spitzer, Bettina Friedrich, Kathrin Sohr, Erik Beyen, Dr Joachim Scherrieble and Viktória Blahó. We are also grateful to the Juleum for giving us access to their beautiful space. We hope to return to Helmstedt in the near future!\n\nWe were delighted to be part of a fantastic event at Ayr Town Hall on 7th February, which brought together 110 students from North, East and South Ayrshire. Nine primary and eleven secondary schools were represented.\n\nThe young people who took part came from a wide variety of places, including Ukraine, Afghanistan, Chad, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Syria and Scotland. Many of them were displaced and writing in a new language. They were guided through the creative process by NSI practitioner Nik Perring, who asked some simple questions relating to food, object, language, experience and advice. Every participant did a fantastic job at translating their answers into poetry to celebrate where they are from, what they miss and what they have discovered in their new home.\n\nFollowing the workshop, students ate lunch together, before presenting their work to an audience of their peers, teachers, parents, local Councillors, academics and representatives from Education Scotland.\n\nOrsolya Dunn - ESOL / Core Skills Lecturer (East Ayrshire) commented after the event:\n\n’It was amazing to see how invested they were in sharing their thoughts and feelings, the power of poetry will never stop amazing me. I have seen a real drive and need from the students to tell their personal story, so this is definitely something that I will need to create safe opportunities for in our classes in the future. I’ve been very careful so far in my work with them, not wanting to elicit things that could potentially cause harm to the person who shares or the person who hears the story, but yesterday’s event has proved to be somewhat of a turning point.’\n\nOur thanks go to South Ayrshire Council for making the day possible, as well as the Thriving Communities Interpreters, Ayrshire College ESOL and photography, Barnardo’s Scotland Welcome Service and the Refugee Council.\n\nOn Wednesday 23rd November we had the pleasure of officially launching our brand new three year programme, Conversations on Conflict, at Stormont - Belfast.\n\nThrough direct contact with schools and communities, we are working with children and young people aged 9-18, living in non conflict affected communities and those living in areas of armed conflict. We are currently inviting these groups to respond creatively through poetry, art, speech and song to our key question for 2022-2023: what does war mean to you?\n\nFor this very special event we were joined by Mercy College Belfast who answered our 2022-23 question beautifully with the line “war means to be blind in another world.”\n\nHazelwood Integrated Primary School recited wonderful poetry that addressed varying forms of conflict. This line really stood out to the NSI team: ”my ears are open and my mouth is closed.”\n\nThe Beyond Borders Home Education choir then performed a wonderful song about hope and unity for all those in attendance.\n\nFinally, we heard excellent recordings of poetry from the The Royal School Armagh!\n\nWe would like to thank Phillip Brett MLA and all the teachers, parents and guardians who made this event possible!\n\nFollowing the Centenary, we embarked on a three-year cycle, giving children and young people a voice on conflict, asking them to reflect on conflict more broadly. We were thrilled to see young people from over 120 countries participate in our international competitions. The themes were: The Impact of Conflict on Communities, Unheard Voices of Conflict and Life After Conflict. Young people shared incredibly powerful pieces of poetry, art, speech and song with us.\n\nOver those three years our young people taught us so much! One of the most profound moments came during a Zoom celebration for winners when one young person from South America talked about a conflict in their country and another young person from the UK said, 'Oh, I didn’t know that happened in your country!' That moment inspired an idea in our team, which has become the basis for our next three year cycle, which kicks off today!\n\nConversations on Conflict invites young people to respond to key questions each year as part of our international competition. Keep scrolling and you'll see what this year's question is! As part of Conversations on Conflict, we'll also be working with schools around the world on collaborative projects, inviting young people to learn from their peers under the guidance of our industry professional practitioners.\n\nAnother part of the project that you will find on our website is a monthly question. At the start of each month, we'll post a new link where young people around the world can share their thoughts!\n\nOur ultimate goal is for young people to have their voices heard by those with the power to make a difference. We are really excited to see what the next three years will bring and we hope you'll come along on the ride with us!\n\nThe Voices of Armed Forces Children Choir is composed of 49 tri-service children, ages -18, from Plymouth to Lossiemouth and everywhere in between. Before performing in front of a live audience at the London Palladium for the BGT auditions, the young people had only rehearsed as a full group three weeks in advance! Many of the children sing in their choir at school or just love to sing on their own.\n\nOn the Saturday ahead of the audition in January, the children were rehearsing at the Guards’ Chapel in London, when, much to their surprise, Simon Cowell walked out and invited them to audition on BGT on Monday. The children were very excited and surprised, several of them having dreamt to perform on BGT. The rest of the weekend, they worked incredibly hard to be stage ready for the audition on Monday.\n\nOn the day of the audition, the young people performed Welcome Home to a live audience at the London Palladium and the four BGT judges. From the onset of the song, the audience was clapping and by the end of the performance, the young people were given a standing ovation. They were awarded four ‘YES’ responses from the judges.\n\nThey were then invited to perform a new song for the BGT live semi final at the Eventim Apollo. The children took part in a songwriting workshop. Songwriters, Bethzienna Williams, David Tobin and Jeff Meagan wove together all of the children's voices to create Stand Up. The kids performed their hearts out - making their friends, family and the NSI team extremely proud! While they didn’t move onto the finals, they accomplished so much and made memories to last a lifetime!\n\nYou can watch their performances here.\n\nDrumroll please! We have now announced our international competition winners! We have been overwhelmed by the quality of the work this year – young people around the world shared the most thoughtful pieces on the theme, Life After Conflict. We saw work from over 90 countries, reflecting on conflicts which mattered to them. The work was deeply empathetic, reflecting on how challenging it can be to resume life after a conflict has happened, but that it also can afford new opportunities as well. The judges shared that this was the most difficult year for them to judge, with so many fantastic pieces of work sent in.\n\nEach and every young person should be feeling extremely proud of themselves for being bold and entering their work into the competition and having their voices heard. All participants will be sent their digital Certificate of Commendation next week to the email they provided on their entry.\n\nTeachers, we want to send a special thank you to you for providing the opportunity for your students to participate! You are empowering your students to use their voices – they are the future decision makers and world changers!\n\nYou can view the winners booklet here!\n\nIn April 2021, Tyler was awarded first place in his age group in NSI’s international competition, being recognised out of 500 other poetry entries. In May, Tyler attended his very own awards ceremony with his family in the Office of the Major-General, located in Horse Guards. Tyler and Evie both read their poems and were awarded their certficiates by Major General C J Ghika CBE. The NSI Voices of Armed Forces Children project is invaluable to the Armed Forces community, supporting not only service members, but their spouses, children and extended family. The reach of the project stretches into schools and classrooms, giving service and civilian children the opportunity to learn about one another and grow in empathy. The mental and emotional well-being of service families is imperative to an effective Armed Forces and NSI provides an additional level of support to strengthen the Armed Forces family.\n\nAfter reading what the children had created, Lieutenant General Sir Tyrone Urch KBE commented: “Young people are at the heart of the British Army family and therefore what they say really matters. I am enormously moved by the amazing poems from our young people and awestruck at how beautifully they describe their thoughts on Service life and also the pride they show being an Army child. It takes a lot of courage to share what you are thinking and how you are feeling; they should all feel very enormously proud to have created such powerful, important and honest pieces.”\n\nTo read Tyler’s winning poem, please view page 9 of our 2020/2021 Winners Booklet.\n\nThis year, over 3,100 children and young people from a staggering 99 countries, territories and dependencies submitted entries into the competition. The young people spoke about a wide variety of topics and showed deep empathy and understanding of how conflict affects others. The team and judges were incredibly moved by their powerful pieces.\n\nTeachers and parents shared lovely stories about what a positive impact participating in our competition has made on their pupils and children. One parent shared, ‘This has made my son, and teenagers like him, more aware of the conflicts taking place in our human society. This is something that no other organization or activity can provide, and it will bring a very positive effect on his growth.’\n\nMost importantly, young people were thankful for the opportunity to speak about what matters to them and have their voices heard. We couldn’t be more proud of each and every one of them.\n\nWe’d also like to highlight three winners who participated in creative workshops as part of our ‘Voices of Armed Forces Children’ project. Please find their winning entries on pages 8 and 24.\n\nWe applaud each and every winner and participant for having their voices heard!\n\nReading Force was set up to help military families keep in touch – as an Army wife I had found it really helped our family feel connected if we shared what we were reading. We offer special reading scrapbooks which a family can share while they talk about a book. Children can include pictures and drawings and families can stick in photographs of what they read together. The scrapbook helps you keep a record of something you did together – families who have taken part tell us it makes them feel proud and is a lovely thing to keep.\n\nEven if you can’t be together, reading books with your family can keep you in touch. You not only share the reading experience – and being read to is relaxing – you also share time with them in between calls. You can be thinking about what each other will notice, and how they will react.\n\n‘You can talk about what you think will happen next and how the characters will be feeling. You can discuss how the book has changed and what your favourite parts are. It gave me something to look forward to at the end of the day.’ Jack, Forces Dad\n\nThere’s also a great feeling that comes from sharing a story you all know, and the way someone you love reads it – even if you’ve heard it lots of times before.\n\nTo register, and receive our free materials, please go to www.readingforce.org.uk\n\nAlison Baverstock, founder and director of Reading Force\n\nOne of our NSI young people was selected to deliver a keynote speech at the National Ceremony for German Remembrance Day on 15th of November 2020 at the Bundestag, attended by The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Jasleen Singh, a NSI young ambassador, was invited to reflect on 75 years since the end of the Second World War, 75 years of peace and partnership in Europe, German British reconciliation and her hopes and fears for the future. Three other young people from Germany, Moldova and Israel also spoke. This was a very significant moment for Jasleen, her family and the UK as a whole. We have now established a series of bilateral seminars, initially aimed at German and UK 12-14 year olds, reflecting on past conflict and looking to a positive future. We are nurturing the next generation of thinkers, leaders and peace keepers through the arts, through cultural exchange, through dialogue and debate. Creating powerful platforms for young people to have their voices heard in the UK and more globally."
