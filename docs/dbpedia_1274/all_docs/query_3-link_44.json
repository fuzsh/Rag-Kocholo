        "meta_description": "Abstract. Situated at the southern edge of the proto-North Sea, the\nlower Eocene SchÃ¶ningen Formation of the Helmstedt Lignite Mining\nDistrict, Lower Saxony, Germany, is characterized by several lignite seams\nalternating with estuarine to brackish interbeds. Here, we present carbon\nisotope data for bulk organic matter (Î´13CTOC), total\norganic carbon content (%TOC), and palynomorphs from a 98âm thick\nsequence of the SchÃ¶ningen Formation in combination with a new robust\nage model, which is based on eustatic sea level changes, biostratigraphy,\nand a correlation with existing radiometric ages. Based on the Î´13CTOC data we observe six negative carbon isotope excursions\n(CIEs) reflecting massive short-term carbon cycle perturbations. A strong\nCIE of â2.6ââ° in Î´13CTOC values in the Main Seam and the succeeding marine interbed can be related to the\nPaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The subsequent CIE of â1.7ââ° in Î´13CTOC values may be\ncorrelated with the Eocene Thermal MaximumÂ 2 (ETM2) or slightly older events preceding the ETM2. High-amplitude climate fluctuations including at least fourÂ minor CIEs with a maximum negative shift of â1.3ââ° in\nÎ´13CTOC in the upper part of the studied section are\ncharacteristic of the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO). Palynological\nanalysis across the Main Seam proved that shifts in Î´13CTOC values are correlated with changes in the peat-forming wetland vegetation, specifically the change from a mixed angiosperm\nand gymnosperm flora to angiosperm-dominated vegetation at the onset of\nthe PETM. The PETM-related CIE shows a distinct rebound to higher Î´13CTOC values shortly after the onset of the CIE,\nwhich is recognized here as a common feature of terrestrial and marginal\nmarine PETM records worldwide and may reflect a stepwise injection of carbon into the atmosphere.",

        "text": "The early Paleogene was characterized by a long-term warming trend that culminated in the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO; Zachos et al., 2001) between ca. 53.3 and 49.1âMyr before present (Westerhold et al., 2018b). However, this long-term warming trend was interrupted by several short-term thermal events. These events were characterized by perturbations in the global carbon cycle, which are represented by negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs), caused by the rapid and massive input of 13C-depleted carbon into the atmosphereâocean system (e.g., Kennett and Stott, 1991; Dickens, 2001; Cramer et al., 2003; Lourens et al., 2005; Zachos et al., 2003, 2008, 2010; Sluijs and Dickens, 2012; Kirtland Turner et al., 2014). The most prominent of these excursions was the PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) or Eocene Thermal MaximumÂ 1 (ETM1) at 55.93âMyr before present (e.g., Kennett and Stott, 1991; Bains et al., 2000; RÃ¶hl et al., 2000; Westerhold et al., 2017), characterized by a sudden temperature peak at the transition from the Paleocene to the Eocene that lasted for about 170âÂ±â30âkyr (RÃ¶hl et al., 2007; Westerhold et al., 2017; Zeebe and Lourens, 2019). During this event, the global mean surface temperature (GMST) increased from 22 to 28ââC in the latest Paleocene to 27 to 35ââC in the earliest Eocene (Inglis et al., 2020). Assuming a pre-industrial GMST of 14ââC, this is about 17ââC warmer than pre-industrial (Inglis et al., 2020). This temperature increase led to a sea level rise of 3 to 5âm (Sluijs et al., 2008), and both marine and continental ecosystems changed noticeably on a global scale (Gingerich, 2006; McInerney and Wing, 2011). However, the PETM was hardly an extinction event but rather a âkick-starting eventâ with regard to evolution (Speijer et al., 2012), especially among vertebrates (e.g., mammals; Gingerich, 2006; Hooker and Collinson, 2012) and plants (Wing et al., 2005; Jaramillo et al., 2010; McInerney and Wing, 2011).\n\nUnderstanding the PETM is of high interest due to its potential to inform predictions of the effects of present and future global warming that can be expected due to the emission of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels (McCarren et al., 2008; Zachos et al., 2005; Zeebe et al., 2016). In particular, the long-term effects and responses of ecosystems on a millennial scale can be studied in marine as well as in terrestrial PETM records. However, there is still a need to study the impact of global warming on the respective ecosystems, especially in well-constrained high-resolution terrestrial records.\n\nDuring the early Eocene the PETM was followed by a number of other short-term thermal events (see Cramer et al., 2003; Westerhold et al., 2017). Among those the ETM2 (54.05âMyr before present; Lourens et al., 2005; Sluijs et al., 2009; Westerhold et al., 2017, 2018b) and the ETM3 (X or K event; 52.85âMyr before present; Cramer et al., 2003; RÃ¶hl et al., 2005; Westerhold et al., 2017, 2018b) events are well pronounced in marine isotope records but did not reach the intensity of the PETM. However, their impact on terrestrial environments and ecosystems is yet not well understood (Abels et al., 2016).\n\nMeanwhile, more than 25 other short-term CIEs have been recognized in marine records from the Atlantic (Sexton et al., 2011; Kirtland Turner et al., 2014) and the Pacific (Westerhold et al., 2018b) for the period between 56 and 45âMa. At least four of them (H1, H2, I1, I2) were apparently orbitally controlled and tied to short eccentricity maxima (Abels et al., 2016). Other short-term CIEs of the lower Eocene (including the PETM) also show a striking coincidence with short and long eccentricity cycles (Westerhold et al., 2018b; Zeebe and Lourens, 2019).\n\nThe long-term warming phase of the EECO included a whole series of early Eocene CIE-related thermal events (Westerhold et al., 2018b) with its beginning placed at the J event at 53.62âMa (Lauretano et al., 2015; Westerhold et al., 2018b). During the peak of the EECO the GMST was 10 to 16ââC warmer than today but did not reach the GMST of the PETM (Inglis et al., 2020). The succeeding onset of global cooling at 49.14âMa led to a steady but slow decline in temperature until the EoceneâOligocene boundary where the sudden shift from the Paleogene greenhouse system to the actual icehouse system occurred (Zachos et al., 2008; Westerhold et al., 2020). The middle and late Eocene cooling trend was interrupted only by a few short-term warming events (Westerhold et al., 2018b), such as the Late Lutetian Thermal Maximum (LLTM) at 41.52âMa (Westerhold et al., 2018a) and the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; Bohaty and Zachos, 2003) between 40.6 and 40.0âMa (Bohaty et al., 2009; Mulch et al., 2015; Methner et al., 2016). Compared to the other Eocene thermal events the MECO does not show a prominent CIE in most of its records (Bohaty et al., 2009; Giorgioni et al., 2019), which, together with a relatively long duration of â¼â500âkyr, indicates that it was most probably triggered by factors other than the rapid release of (organic) carbon to the atmosphere (Giorgioni et al., 2019).\n\nDespite high-resolution records of the short- and long-term warming events of the Paleogene greenhouse from deep oceans, the spatial effects of most of these hyperthermals are only poorly understood due to inadequate data coverage (Westerhold et al., 2018b). In particular, there are only a few records providing insight into the response of terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., Jaramillo et al., 2010; Xie et al., 2022). Long-term terrestrial carbon isotope records covering the Paleocene and the lower Eocene are only available from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA (e.g., Gingerich, 2006; Abels et al., 2012, 2016). Other isotope records are confined to the PETM, such as those from some sections in China (Nanyang Basin; Zhu et al., 2010), Colombia (Jaramillo et al., 2010), and Europe (Cobham Lignite, Great Britain; Collinson et al., 2003; Vasterival, northern France; Storme et al., 2012).\n\nThe sedimentary succession of the former Helmstedt Lignite Mining District almost continuously covers the entire Paleogene greenhouse phase in the so-called Helmstedt Embayment at the southern edge of the proto-North Sea (Lenz, 2005; Riegel et al., 2012, 2015) (Fig.Â 1). This offers the rare opportunity to study PaleoceneâEocene near-coastal ecosystems which preserved the effects of long- and short-term climate perturbations across more than 10âmillion years.\n\nHere, we present a new and robust stratigraphic framework for the succession of the Helmstedt Mining District at SchÃ¶ningen based on biostratigraphy (dinoflagellate cysts) and comparison with the standard eustatic sea level curves. Carbon isotope analyses of bulk organic matter (Î´13CTOC) and organic carbon content (%TOC) from the lower part of the SchÃ¶ningen Formation now significantly extend the existing carbon isotope stratigraphy (Methner et al., 2019) and allow identifying CIEs in the record that can now be correlated with known thermal events such as the PETM and the EECO.\n\n4.1âAge model\n\nAn accurate age model is a prerequisite for the identification of specific CIEs in the isotope record at SchÃ¶ningen. Previous age assignments for the succession at SchÃ¶ningen (Riegel et al., 2012; Brandes et al., 2012) were based on lithologic correlation with drill cores in the eastern syncline near Emmerstedt, ca. 20âkm north of SchÃ¶ningen, which were dated radiometrically and biostratigraphically (Ahrendt et al., 1995). Kâ/ âAr ages of glauconites are available for the middle part of the SchÃ¶ningen Formation (52.8âÂ±â1.4âMa) and for its top (49.9âÂ±â1.2âMa) (Ahrendt et al., 1995). Transferring the age of 46.0âÂ±â1.2âMa for the base of the Emmerstedt Greensand (Emmerstedt Formation; Ahrendt et al., 1995) to the SchÃ¶ningen succession is hampered by the lack of greensand in an equivalent position. However, the interbed between SeamÂ 8 at the top of the SchÃ¶ningen Formation and SeamÂ 9 at the base of the Helmstedt Formation can most probably be regarded as age equivalent (Riegel et al., 2012).\n\n4.1.1âDinoflagellates\n\nDinoflagellate cyst assemblages from marine horizons at Emmerstedt (Ahrendt et al., 1995) indicate that the SchÃ¶ningen Formation can be assigned to the lower Eocene dinoflagellate zones D5b to D9na for northwestern Germany (Costa and Manum, 1988; KÃ¶the, 1990, 2003). Cysts of dinoflagellates have also been recorded in interbeds with marine influence at SchÃ¶ningen, but their provisional assignment to dinoflagellate zones by Riegel et al.Â (2012) is slightly modified here.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nThe three InterbedsÂ 1, 2, and 3 from the lower part of the SchÃ¶ningen Formation include dinoflagellate cyst assemblages of low diversity with the dominance of a few species (TableÂ 1, Figs.Â S2âS4 in the Supplement).\n\nInterbedÂ 1 is characterized by an essentially monogeneric assemblage of Apectodinium species with a dominance of A. homomorphum but common occurrences of A. parvum. Only single specimens of Homotryblium sp. and Glaphyrocysta sp. have been observed. On this basis InterbedÂ 1 can be assigned to either zone D5 or the lower part of D6 (D6na). Zone D5 has been subdivided into subzones D5na and D5nb (KÃ¶the, 1990), whereby subzone D5na is characterized by the occurrence of Axiodinium augustum (formerly Apectodinium augustum), which is the diagnostic species for the PETM. However, since A. augustum obviously represents an open marine species it is generally missing in the more marginal marine sediments of northwestern Germany (KÃ¶the, 1990, 2003), including those at SchÃ¶ningen. Nevertheless, instead of A. augustum the PETM interval in the Paris and DieppeâHampshire basins contains A. parvum in high numbers. Therefore, the latter species probably represents an ecological substitute for A. augustum in marginal marine environments at the edge of the southern proto-North Sea (Iakovleva et al., 2021). Since A. parvum is common in the lower part of InterbedÂ 1, this suggests that InterbedÂ 1 can be assigned to zone D5na.\n\nInterbedÂ 2 is characterized by a distinct acme of Apectodinium species but also includes a number of other taxa, e.g., Thalassiphora pelagica, Cordosphaeridium sp., Glaphyrocysta sp., and a single specimen of the Cleistosphaeridium placacanthum/ancyreum group. Although the latter reaches the first peak in zone D7na, single specimens may appear as early as zone D5. Thus, based on the mass occurrence of Apectodinium InterbedÂ 2 can best be assigned to zone D5 or the lower part of zone D6 (D6na). The lack of wetzelielloid cysts other than Apectodinium, i.e., Wetzeliella spp. and Dracodinium spp., which are diagnostic for zone D6, may be attributed to the estuarine environment at SchÃ¶ningen, which did not include the full range of marine dinoflagellates as known from the Eocene North Sea Basin. This precludes a precise delimitation of zones D5 and D6 and a detailed comparison of the SchÃ¶ningen assemblage with the Eocene North Sea dinocyst zonation of Bujak and MudgeÂ (1994).\n\nCompared to InterbedsÂ 1 and 2 the base of InterbedÂ 3 is characterized by a higher diversity of dinoflagellate cysts (TableÂ 1, Fig.Â 2), mainly with long-ranging species. Some of them have their first occurrence in the Paleocene or range into the Oligocene or even Miocene (Fig.Â 2). The stratigraphic significance of the respective dinoflagellate cyst assemblage is therefore relatively low, and only Apectodinum homomorphum as a single representative of the genus limits the range of InterbedÂ 3 to an interval covering zones D7na to D9na. The lack of fully marine taxa is again striking. Cysts of dinoflagellate ecogroups indicating near-coastal shallow-water areas with fluctuating salinities (KÃ¶the, 1990) such as Thalassiphora or Homotryblium dominate. Among the wetzelielloid cysts the genera Deflandrea or Ceratiopsis, which frequently occur in lower Eocene deposits of the southern North Sea Basin except for zone D7na (KÃ¶the, 1990), are completely missing in InterbedÂ 3. Since our evidence of dinocyst occurrences is, thus far, largely restricted to its base, this may be a hint that at least this part of InterbedÂ 3 is within zone D7na.\n\nDownload\n\nIn summary, InterbedÂ 1 can be assigned to dinoflagellate zone D5na/nb; InterbedÂ 2 includes zones D5nb and D6na, and InterbedÂ 3 includes zone D7na. This clearly indicates that the lower two interbeds are of lowermost Eocene age. Since zone D5na may be identified at the base of InterbedÂ 1 based on the common occurrence of Apectodinium parvum as an onshore substitute for Axiodinium augustum, which is otherwise diagnostic of the PETM (Iakovleva et al., 2021), the PaleoceneâEocene boundary is expected to be situated below within the Main Seam.\n\n4.1.2âEustatic sea level\n\nAnother approach to generate a stratigraphic framework for the SchÃ¶ningen and Helmstedt formations is provided by matching the alternation of lignites and marine interbeds of the Eocene succession at SchÃ¶ningen with established sea level curves (Haq et al., 1987a, b, 1988; Miller et al., 2005a; Kominz et al., 2008) for the period between 57 and 41âMa (Fig.Â 3). Even if variations in global sea level were modified at SchÃ¶ningen by local and regional factors such as subsurface salt withdrawal and fluctuations of sedimentary input (Wilde et al., 2021), there is still a good correspondence between times of low sea level and peat accumulation, allowing for a relatively precise age assignment of the lignite seams (Fig.Â 3). Furthermore, these ages fit the Kâ/ âAr ages from the drill core at Emmerstedt, ca. 20âkm N of SchÃ¶ningen (Ahrendt et al., 1995).\n\nDownload\n\nThe lower three interbeds, InterbedsÂ 1 to 3, were deposited in an estuarine system with tidally influenced estuarine channels. An upward increase in marine influence as recorded by the increasing diversity of the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages (Fig.Â 2) indicates an overall deepening-upward trend representing a retrogradational system (Dalrymple and Choi, 2007; Osman et al., 2013). For the corresponding period between 56 and 53.5âMa, all three sea level curves show a general increase in the sea level and an overall transgressive trend interrupted by short episodes of regression, which can be matched with SeamsÂ 1 and 2 at SchÃ¶ningen (Fig.Â 3). Therefore, an age of more than 53.5âMa can be assumed for the three lower seams, which corresponds well with the lowermost Eocene age assigned to the dinocyst zones D5nb to D7na of InterbedsÂ 1 to 3. Therefore, an age of â¼â56âMa is suggested for the Main Seam,Â which again indicates that it most probably represents the transition from the Paleocene to the Eocene including the PETM.\n\nFor SeamÂ 3 and the thin, locally developed Sphagnum Seam (Riegel and Wilde, 2016), there is no clear correspondence with the three sea level curves (Fig.Â 3). This may be due to a short-term preponderance of regional and local factors or to higher-frequency sea level changes not represented in the global records. The approximate position of this part of the succession at 53.1 to 52.4âMa (Fig.Â 3) corresponds to the Kâ/ âAr glauconite age of 52.8âÂ±â1.4âMa (Ahrendt et al., 1995) for the equivalent of InterbedÂ 4 at Emmerstedt.\n\nDuring the deposition of InterbedÂ 4 the system experienced a major transgression that resulted in the so-called âSpurensandâ, a highly bioturbated clayey sand including occasional glauconite (Fig.Â 3; Lietzow and Ritzkowski, 2005; Riegel et al., 2012; Osman et al., 2013). Subsequent regression initiated peat formation of SeamÂ 4 (Riegel et al., 2012). Although the global sea level curves generally show a high sea level during this time (Fig.Â 3), Miller et al.Â (2005a) and Kominz et al.Â (2008) suggest a slightly regressive tendency that could have led to a progression of the estuarine system. The transgression at the time of the Spurensand, which has been considered to corresponded to a maximum flooding surface and the end of a depositional cycle (Lietzow and Ritzkowski, 2005; Osman et al., 2013), is only pronounced in the curves of Haq et al.Â (1987a, b, 1988).\n\nVarious regression and transgression phases followed, which mostly led to the formation of thinner seams in the SchÃ¶ningen Formation, e.g., SeamÂ 4 (locally split into three benches), SeamÂ 5, SeamÂ L, and SeamÂ 7, each only a few to several decimeters thick. Only SeamÂ 6 is 4âm thick and matches an extended phase of low sea level (Fig.Â 3). According to the global sea level variations SeamsÂ 4 to 7 can be assigned to a period between 51 and 49âMa (Fig.Â 3).\n\nThe lower Eocene part of the succession terminates with SeamÂ 8. If the following InterbedÂ 9 is regarded as equivalent to the greensand of the Emmerstedt Formation in the eastern syncline further to the NW, the Kâ/ âAr glauconite age of 46.0âÂ±â1.1âMa (Ahrendt et al., 1995) from Emmerstedt implies a middle Eocene age for InterbedÂ 9. The change from the SchÃ¶ningen Formation to the Emmerstedt Formation is characterized by a significant hiatus at the top of SeamÂ 8 (Osman et al., 2013), which may be represented at SchÃ¶ningen by a deep channel reaching down from slightly above SeamÂ 8 to a level well below SeamÂ 7. In particular, the strong transgression at 47.6âMa as indicated in the sea level curves (Haq et al., 1987a, b, 1988) may correlate with the onset of deposition of the marine Emmerstedt Greensand and its equivalents and thus limits the age range for the deposition of SeamÂ 8 from 48.4 to 47.6âMa.\n\nThree phases of a low sea level during the early middle Eocene at â¼â46.9 to 46.6, â¼â45.7 to 45.0, and â¼â43.0 to 41.9âMa obviously correlate with the three seams of the Helmstedt Formation at SchÃ¶ningen (Fig.Â 3). The two long periods of a low sea level may especially be responsible for the formation of the 10 and 20âm thick Victoria and Treue seams, respectively, at the top of the succession in the western syncline. This implies that the Helmstedt Formation does not include the MECO (40.6 to 40.0âMa; Bohaty and Zachos, 2003), although paleobotanical and palynological data suggest paratropical flora for the respective part of the section (Riegel et al., 1999, 2012).\n\nOverall, the lignite-bearing terminal Paleocene to middle Eocene deposits in the western syncline have been assigned to a second-order transgressive succession (Osman et al., 2013), which is comprised of four third-order sequences and several higher-order sequences possibly related to Milankovitch cycles and characterized by stacked cycles of estuarine and marine sands capped by coals. Maximum flooding surfaces were assigned to the top of InterbedÂ 4, the top of SeamÂ 6, the greensand of the Emmerstedt Formation, and the top of the sediments underlying SeamÂ 9 (Osman et al., 2013), which is in good correspondence with the global sea level curves (Fig.Â 3).\n\n4.2âCIEs in the lower SchÃ¶ningen Formation\n\nClastic interbeds and lignites are clearly separated by their total organic carbon content (Fig.Â 4), which is generally above 43â% in lignites, reaching more than 60â% in all seams except the thinner SeamsÂ 4, 5, and L (supplementary data, TableÂ S1). TOC content in the brackish interbeds is generally below 10â% and often below 1â%. Only in transitions may more than 30â% TOC be reached.\n\nDownload\n\nThroughout the studied section, carbon isotope ratios of bulk organic matter range between â25.1ââ° and â28.8ââ° (Fig.Â 4). In the Main SeamÂ Î´13CTOC varies between â25.4ââ° and â28.7ââ° (average Î´13CTOC of â26.96âÂ±â0.85ââ°, nâ=â47), with a comparatively high standard deviation (SD) in comparison to other sections of the isotope record (see below) caused by a great range of Î´13CTOC (TableÂ 1). In the lower 3.5âm of the Main Seam, the values constantly fluctuate between â26.8ââ° and â25.4ââ°. A strong decrease in Î´13CTOC values within the succeeding 1.2âm indicates the first CIE in the record of the SchÃ¶ningen Formation (onset of CIEÂ 1). Following a short but small increase of 0.4ââ° at 4.57âm an abrupt drop to â28.0ââ° can be observed between 4.57 and 4.79âm, which is followed by an interval with low values. Î´13CTOC values briefly rise again to â25.7ââ°, before another sharp decline to â28.7ââ° at the top of the Main Seam occurs (9.85âm, Fig.Â 4, TableÂ 2).\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nFollowing the lowest Î´13CTOC value at the top of the Main Seam, the values in the lower 7âm of InterbedÂ 1 show a continuous recovery of â¼â2ââ° to â26.8ââ°. Above, the Î´13CTOC values decrease with strong fluctuations (Fig.Â 4). At 16.47 and 18.35âm from the base of the section negative spikes of Î´13CTOC below â28ââ° have been recorded, while the overall lowest value of â28.8ââ° is reached at 21.33âm. However, all of these very low Î´13CTOC values are restricted to single samples. Following the lowest value Î´13CTOC strongly increases by 2.1ââ° to â26.7ââ° at 22.39âm, before the Î´13CTOC values remain steady up to the top of InterbedÂ 1 (Fig.Â 4). Including recovery, CIEÂ 1 therefore encompasses 3.53 to 22.39âm of the studied section.\n\nÎ´13CTOC values from the top of SeamÂ 1 to the middle of SeamÂ 2 between 27.74 and 37.49âm have been identified as a distinct CIE (here CIEÂ 2; Methner et al., 2019). Both the abrupt decrease in Î´13CTOC values at the top of SeamÂ 1 and their gradual increase within the lower half of SeamÂ 2 occur within lignite away from marine influence, although bracketing clastic InterbedÂ 2 with its prominent Apectodinium acme.\n\nFollowing the pronounced high in the upper half of SeamÂ 2, Î´13CTOC values decrease again to â27.8ââ° within the lower 1.1âm of InterbedÂ 3 and remain largely constant with only slight fluctuations up to the base of SeamÂ 4 at 76.8âm (average Î´13CTOC of â27.3âÂ±â0.4ââ°, nâ=â53). Between 67.35 and 68.73âm, however, there is a short but rapid drop in InterbedÂ 4 by 1.3ââ° to â28.2ââ°, which we tentatively interpret as CIEÂ 3 (Fig.Â 4, TableÂ 2).\n\nWithin SeamÂ 4, Î´13CTOC values rise to â26.8ââ° and to â26.1ââ° in the lower 70âcm of InterbedÂ 5 after an abrupt drop to â28.2ââ° at the interface between the seam and the interbed. The following values in InterbedÂ 5 remain constantly high (average Î´13CTOC of â26.4âÂ±â0.2ââ°, nâ=â9) and no major change is recorded for SeamÂ 5 (average Î´13CTOC of â26.6âÂ±â0.2ââ°, nâ=â6). In InterbedÂ 6 and the subsequent SeamÂ 6 further significant fluctuations in Î´13CTOC values may be observed, which should be regarded as minor CIEs. CIEÂ 4 is identified from the top of SeamÂ 5 into the base of InterbedÂ 6 (82.89 to 85.99âm) where Î´13CTOC drops by 1.0ââ° to â27.7ââ° before values rise again to previous levels (Fig.Â 4, TableÂ 2). Within InterbedÂ 6 and from the top of InterbedÂ 6 up to the top of SeamÂ 6 two small but still pronounced excursions of 0.8ââ° (CIEÂ 5, between 88.25 and 91.7âm) and 0.7ââ° (CIEÂ 6, between 94.35 and 97.51âm) occur over several samples each (Fig.Â 4, TableÂ 2). Furthermore, an overall trend towards somewhat higher Î´13CTOC values can be recognized from the base of InterbedÂ 6 to the base of InterbedÂ 7 (Fig.Â 4).\n\n4.3âEffects of changes in lithology and mixing of carbon sources on Î´13CTOC values\n\nWhen comparing the six observed negative shifts in Î´13CTOC values with known CIEs it is necessary to differentiate between shifts occurring within seams or interbeds and shifts occurring at lithologic boundaries (Fig.Â 4). In the SchÃ¶ningen section organic debris was commonly mixed into the brackish interbeds from adjacent peat mires and other terrestrial sources, which may have induced shifts in Î´13CTOC values independent of climate perturbations. For example, the increase in Î´13CTOC at the base of InterbedÂ 2 and the decrease at its top correlate with changes in lithology (Fig.Â 5), while the shift to lower Î´13CTOC values at the top of SeamÂ 1 and the gradual increase back to higher values within SeamÂ 2 both occur within a distinct lignite (Fig.Â 4).\n\nDownload\n\nThe most important decrease in Î´13CTOC values starts well within the Main Seam, 6âm below the top at 3.53âm, independent of lithological changes (Fig.Â 4). The gradual shift to higher values in the lower part of InterbedÂ 1 up to 16.46âm (Fig.Â 5) likewise takes place without a change in lithology and reflects part of the recovery phase of CIEÂ 1. On the other hand, a similar increase at the transition from SeamÂ 1 to InterbedÂ 2 (Figs.Â 4, 5; Methner et al., 2019) may be related to the change to the estuarine environment of InterbedÂ 2 to which, however, a significant amount of terrestrial carbon has been admixed (Riegel et al., 2012).\n\nSince marine organic matter is more depleted in 13C compared to terrestrial organic matter (Sluijs and Dickens, 2012) mixing of 13C from marine and terrestrial sources will influence fluctuations of Î´13CTOC values. By comparing the Î´13C signature of isolated dinoflagellate cysts from before and throughout the PETM (Sluijs et al., 2018) to Î´13CTOC values from the SchÃ¶ningen Formation, it becomes clear that the Î´13C composition of dinocysts covers a similar range. However, bulk organic matter, which is derived from marine sediments, has been analyzed here. It also contains organic compounds that may have been strongly depleted in 13C such as amorphous organic matter, thus shifting the Î´13CTOC record to lower values (see Sluijs et al., 2018). For instance, massive driftwood and occasional rooting have been observed in the lower part of InterbedÂ 1 (Riegel et al., 2012), while the scattered negative values in the upper half of InterbedÂ 1 can probably be related to a higher proportion of marine TOC. Furthermore, a significant Î´13CTOC increase is associated with higher TOC contents, signaling the transition to the succeeding SeamÂ 1 (TableÂ S1).\n\nA general decrease in Î´13CTOC values can be observed in the younger interbeds above SeamÂ 2 (Fig.Â 5), which show a greater marine influence (Riegel et al., 2012; Osman et al., 2013). For instance, there is a significant decrease of more than 2ââ° at the transition to InterbedÂ 3 followed by fluctuating but relatively low Î´13CTOC values up into the lower half of InterbedÂ 4. That the Î´13CTOC values for the intercalated SeamÂ 3 remain within the range of the overall fluctuations may be due to the low number of samples analyzed for this seam.\n\nFollowing a distinct single-sample decline to a value below â28ââ° in the middle of InterbedÂ 4 (CIEÂ 3), comparatively low Î´13CTOC values persist in the upper part of InterbedÂ 4. With the return to terrestrial conditions the values increase in the succeeding SeamÂ 4 (Fig.Â 5). The strong drop of the Î´13CTOC values at the top of SeamÂ 4 again may be related to the change in facies coupled to an increasing contribution of 13C-depleted marine organic matter (Fig.Â 5). However, in the succeeding lower 30âcm of InterbedÂ 5 the values strongly increase, which is comparable to the situation in InterbedsÂ 1 and 2 and may indicate that the decline of the Î´13CTOC values at the transition between SeamÂ 4 and InterbedÂ 5 is related to changes in lithology.\n\nAt the base of SeamÂ 5 the values are similarly high as in the underlying InterbedÂ 5. However, a significant decrease in Î´13CTOC values can be observed from the base to the top of the seam (Fig.Â 5) where it continues into the base of InterbedÂ 6, which may have been enforced by the transition to marine deposits with generally lower Î´13CTOC values. However, in spite of this effect, the part of the section from the base of SeamÂ 5 into the lower part of InterbedÂ 6 has been recognized as CIEÂ 4 because afterwards Î´13CTOC values gradually and continuously rise again. Weak CIEs of 0.8ââ° (CIEÂ 5) and 0.7ââ° (CIEÂ 6) have also been identified within InterbedÂ 6 and SeamÂ 6, where they are independent of lithological changes (Figs.Â 4, 5).\n\nIt is noteworthy that the CIEs that have been identified in the upper part of our record (CIEsÂ 3 to 6) are characterized by a relatively small Î´13CTOC range of less than 1.3ââ°. However, this is probably due to the fact that these CIEs have been identified from bulk organic matter. Baczynski et al.Â (2016) were able to show that CIEs observed in bulk organic matter have a smaller magnitude and are shorter in duration than those derived from Î´13C of leaf-wax n-alkanes. Consequently, the CIEs that are recognized in the SchÃ¶ningen Formation by carbon isotope values of bulk organic matter should be even more pronounced by using compound-specific isotope ratios.\n\n4.4âThermal events in the lower Eocene at SchÃ¶ningen\n\nRevision of the dinoflagellate zonation (Costa and Manum, 1988; KÃ¶the, 1990, 2003) and comparison with eustatic sea level changes (Haq et al., 1987a, b; Miller et al., 2005a; Kominz et al., 2008) in addition to the consideration of sequence stratigraphic concepts (Osman et al., 2013) provide a robust stratigraphic framework for the interpretation of the Î´13CTOC record from the lower part of the SchÃ¶ningen Formation and the assignment of observed CIEs to known thermal events in the lower Eocene.\n\n4.4.1âCIEÂ 1 (PETM)\n\nMethner et al.Â (2019) could not clearly assign the CIE between the top of SeamÂ 1 and the lower part of SeamÂ 2 (CIEÂ 2 in this paper) to the PETM and already proposed that it may reflect a later early Eocene thermal event. Due to a cooler mesothermal climate that is indicated by the palynoflora with mass occurrences of Alnus pollen, Lenz et al.Â (2021) concluded that SeamÂ 1 was deposited during a strong temperature decline following the PETM in the first million years of the Eocene (Wing et al., 1999; Stokke et al., 2020) and already suggested that both the PETM and the associated PaleoceneâEocene boundary should be placed below SeamÂ 1. Our new data show a well-expressed CIE ranging from the middle of the Main SeamÂ into InterbedÂ 1 (CIEÂ 1, Figs.Â 4, 5) with a total drop of 3.3ââ° and 2.6ââ° in Î´13CTOC values (CIE magnitude; TableÂ 2). This is the strongest excursion in the entire studied section. Since InterbedÂ 1 has now been placed in the earliest Eocene dinoflagellate zone D5nb and the eustatic sea level curve suggests an age of ca. 56âMa for the Main SeamÂ (see above), CIEÂ 1 most probably represents the PETM. As a consequence, we now locate the PaleoceneâEocene boundary within the Main Seam,Â thus confirming the earlier supposition of Lenz et al.Â (2021).\n\nThe termination and recovery phase of CIEÂ 1 have been considered to be associated with a sea level rise due to thermal expansion of seawater (Sluijs et al., 2008) or melting of small ice sheets in Antarctica (Speijer and Wagner, 2002; DeConto and Pollard, 2003; Miller et al., 2005b; Hollis et al., 2009). Sluijs et al.Â (2008) already suggested a link between the global sea level and hyperthermal events and recognized a eustatic sea level rise for the North Sea Basin during the PETM and ETM2. In the SchÃ¶ningen Formation this led to the change from peat-forming to brackish environments (Main SeamÂ to InterbedÂ 1). Similar transitions from terrestrial to brackish deposits in conjunction with the PETM at the southern edge of the North Sea Basin were also reported from other sites, such as Cobham in southeastern England (Collinson et al., 2003) and the Oise region in France (Cavagnetto, 2000; Nel et al., 1999; Dupuy et al., 2014). Therefore, our carbon isotope record is consistent with peat formation during the onset of the PETM and widespread inundation of coastal lowlands due to sea level rise during a later stage of the PETM (see, e.g., Denison, 2021).\n\nThe lack of the key species A. augustum within the dinoflagellate assemblage of InterbedÂ 1 is not uncommon for PETM deposits of the southern North Sea Basin. In the French Dieppe and Paris basins the PETM-related CIEs similarly started with terrestrial and coastal deposits and continued into lagoonal and shallow marine sediments, which are also characterized by an extremely pronounced Apectodinium acme without A. augustum (Iakovleva et al., 2013). In the marginal marine to lagoonal Tienen Formation in Belgium A. augustum is only known from the lower part of the PETM interval and missing above (Steurbaut et al., 2000). Therefore, A. augustum is generally sparse and restricted to the lower part of the PETM interval in the southern North Sea Basin (Steurbaut et al., 2000). As a consequence, A. augustum cannot be expected in our section since the lower part of the PETM interval in the SchÃ¶ningen Formation is included within the Main Seam. However, the frequent occurrence of A. parvum supports the idea that the base of InterbedÂ 1 is still part of the PETM interval.\n\nThe negative shift of â3.3ââ° in Î´13C in the Main SeamÂ is smaller than the shift of â4.7âÂ±â1.5ââ° known for the PETM in other terrestrial records but larger than the shift of â2.8âÂ±â1.3ââ° in marine deposits (McInerney and Wing, 2011). The recovery phase in the lower part of InterbedÂ 1 spans a positive shift of only about 2ââ°, which is roughly within the range known from other marine records, but overall Î´13CTOC values do not return to pre-CIEÂ values attained in the lower part of the Main Seam. Most likely, admixture of marine organic matter more depleted in 13C compared to terrestrial organic matter prevented the full recovery to Î´13CTOC values as high as those recorded in the purely terrestrial organic matter of the Main Seam. However, the shift from the negative peak of Î´13CTOC values at the top of the Main SeamÂ to increasing values in the interbed at or near the lithological boundary has to be treated with caution since the PETM-driven transgression in this coastal setting may have led to a hiatus at the top of the Main Seam (Denison, 2021) that obscured an even more negative shift of Î´13CTOC values.\n\nThe onset of a CIEÂ is generally regarded as the time between the pre-CIEÂ carbon isotope composition and the most depleted values (McInerney and Wing, 2011). Compared to the sharp drop commonly observed in the onsets of marine records (e.g., RÃ¶hl et al., 2007; Westerhold et al., 2018b; Fig.Â 6), the decrease in Î´13C values appears to be more gradual in the Main Seam. However, based on an average compaction rate of 3â:â1 (Widera, 2015) and an average rate of deposition for tropical peat of 3âmmâyrâ1 (Stach et al., 1982), 1âm of lignite in the SchÃ¶ningen Formation may represent about 1âkyr. Therefore, the 6.50âm of lignite representing the onset in the Main SeamÂ may cover ca. 6.5âkyr. This is well in accordance with a time of less than 10âkyr that has generally been estimated for the onset of the PETM-related CIE (Zachos et al., 2005).\n\nDownload\n\nMethner et al.Â (2019) initially noted close similarities between the Î´13CTOC values from CIEÂ 2 of the SchÃ¶ningen section and those from other peat mires at the southern coast of the North Sea assigned to the PETM, e.g., the Cobham Lignite in the UK (Collinson et al., 2003, 2009; Pancost et al., 2007) and the Vasterival section in France (Garel et al., 2013; Storme et al., 2012). However, there are also similarities to CIEÂ 1 (Fig.Â 7), i.e., a similar â3.2ââ° shift of Î´13CTOC, similar minimum Î´13CTOC value of â27.5ââ° to â28.8ââ°, and similar CIEÂ magnitudes. Interestingly, the CIEÂ magnitude that is calculated as the difference between the mean pre-CIEÂ and the mean CIEÂ values is slightly smaller than those of CIEÂ 1 (â1.4ââ°; TableÂ 2) in both the Cobham Lignite and the Vasterival section (â1.6ââ° resp. â1.5ââ°). If the CIE magnitude, however, is calculated as the difference between the mean pre-CIEÂ values and the most negative value during the CIEÂ (McInerney and Wing, 2011) the value for the SchÃ¶ningen CIEÂ 1 (â2.6ââ°) exceeds that of the Cobham Lignite and the Vasterival section (â2.0ââ° resp. â2.3ââ°).\n\nThe comparison of Î´13CTOC values from peat mire records at the southern coast of the North Sea with a European terrestrial PETM Î´13C record not including any lignite (Claret section in the Pyrenees, Domingo et al., 2009) shows that the Î´13CTOC values in the Claret section are clearly higher than those from the marginal wetlands of the North Sea (Fig.Â 7). The only exception is the PETM record from the Doel borehole (northern Belgium) (Steurbaut et al., 2003a), which is comparable to the carbon isotope record from the Pyrenees (Fig.Â 7). However, the Doel section is mainly brackish with few thin lignitic layers and therefore not fully comparable to the lignite-bearing sections from Cobham, Vasterival, and SchÃ¶ningen. Especially in comparison to the Vasterival section, the variability of the Î´13CTOC values in the pre-, peak-, and post-CIEÂ intervals is almost identical for CIEÂ 1 in the SchÃ¶ningen Formation. The similarity in all of the characteristics described above of Î´13CTOC values that are represented in the PETMâCIEÂ of the Cobham Lignite (Collinson et al., 2003), the PETM at Vasterival (Storme et al., 2012), and CIEsÂ 1 and 2 in the SchÃ¶ningen Formation (Methner et al., 2019, this study) supports the idea that the wetlands in mid-latitudinal European near-coastal environments reacted similarly during the latest Paleocene to early Eocene thermal events. The CIEÂ magnitudes are dampened compared to purely terrestrial archives such as the Claret section in the Pyrenees but yield a very consistent and robust signal. Methner et al.Â (2019) discussed different causes for the dampened magnitude of the CIEÂ in the lignite records such as mixing and dilution of the input signal, occurrence of local signal perturbation (e.g., due to vegetation changes), or the differential degradation and/or preservation of organic matter during the climatic perturbation.\n\nSince within-seam carbon sources are likely to be purely terrestrial, the fluctuations of Î´13CTOC values in the CIEÂ of the Main SeamÂ including a clear rebound to higher values as commonly observed in terrestrial records (Figs.Â 6 and S5) are rather striking. The PETM reflects injections of large amounts of carbon into the atmosphereâocean system, but it is uncertain whether single or multiple episodes of carbon release occurred (Zhang et al., 2017). Generally, the PETM-related CIE shows a curve of a triangular shape with a single large decrease in Î´13C values, followed by an exponential recovery as seen in several of the marine isotope curves (Fig.Â 6). However, in some records, Î´13C values decrease in steps, indicating complex processes of carbon injection into the atmosphere (Zhang et al., 2017; Tremblin et al., 2022), suggesting multiple phases of carbon release. In a high-resolution carbon isotope record of terrestrial deposits from the Bighorn Basin (USA), Bowen et al.Â (2015) could show that the beginning of the PETM consists of at least two discrete intervals of decreasing carbon isotope values. The first event had a duration between 2 and 5.5âkyr, and the onsets of the two carbon release events lasted no more than 1.5âkyr (Bowen et al., 2015). In our record, the first Î´13C decline was also within less than 1.5âkyr and the first excursion lasted around 4.5âkyr when assuming 1âm of lignite per thousand years (see above). Therefore, the data from the Main SeamÂ are consistent with those reported from the Bighorn Basin.\n\nHowever, the steps in a carbon isotope curve may also be related to sediment reworking or mixing of different carbon sources (e.g., Bralower, 2002). Mixing and reworking of organic matter cannot be excluded for the interbeds of the SchÃ¶ningen succession, since multiple flooding and thus reworking events may have happened (Methner et al., 2019). However, within individual lignite seams no mixing of organic material should have occurred, since it formed in situ from an ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peat mire consisting mostly of mosses, ferns, and an associated hardwood mire forest (Riegel et al., 2012; Inglis et al., 2015; Lenz et al., 2021). Therefore, the isotope record of the Main SeamÂ may indeed reflect a stepwise injection of carbon into the atmosphere.\n\nDownload\n\nHowever, similar to fluctuations described from the lower Eocene of the DieppeâHampshire Basin in northern France (Garel et al., 2020), the short-term return to pre-CIEÂ Î´13CTOC values at around 2âm below the top of the Main Seam (Fig.Â 4) may also be explained by environmental factors or changes in the vegetation. Especially pronounced is the change in pollen assemblages at the beginning of the CIE. The abundance of Inaperturopollenites and Nyssapollenites probably represents a NyssaâTaxodium swamp forest in the lower part of the seam. With the change to a forest dominated by Myricaceae (Triporopollenites robustusârhenanus) Î´13CTOC values suddenly drop from around â26.8ââ° and 25.4ââ° to â28.0ââ° (Fig.Â 8). A brief rise to 25.7ââ° and the subsequent decrease coincide with the occurrence of Pompeckjioidaepollenites subhercynicus and Sphagnum-type spores (Fig.Â 8). Thus, fluctuations in Î´13CTOC values are clearly correlated with vegetation change.\n\nA comparable shift from a mixed angiospermâconifer flora in the Paleocene to an angiosperm flora at the onset of the PETM-related CIEÂ was already reported for the Bighorn Basin in Wyoming (Smith et al., 2007; Diefendorf et al., 2010). Diefendorf et al.Â (2010) thereby suggested that a 4.6ââ° decline in Î´13C values of atmospheric CO2 at the onset of the PETM can be attributed to the different carbon isotope budget of gymnosperm and angiosperm leaves. Conifers and angiosperms reacted differently in isotopic fractionation during the PETM-related CIE,Â resulting in different isotopic excursions of ca. 3ââ° for conifers and 6ââ° for angiosperms (Schouten et al., 2007). Therefore, the strong decline of Î´13CTOC values at 5.20âm in the Main SeamÂ may also be attributed to the strong increase in Myricaceae in the wetland vegetation, representing a local signal. However, at â¼â8.20âm a further increase in angiosperm pollen (P. subhercynicus) and the simultaneous decrease in pollen from the Cupressaceae are not associated with a decrease in Î´13CTOC values but with a shift to less negative values. Therefore, a local change in the vegetation altering the carbon isotope signal is unlikely to account solely for the CIE in the Main Seam.\n\nIf the Î´13C signal is a purely local signal that only reflects environmental changes in the mire forest, the isotope values in Seams 1 and 2 should behave similarly. In SeamÂ 1, however, the Î´13C signal remained constant during the increase in Sphagnum spores and P. subhercynicus at the end of peat formation, and the strong decrease in Î´13C values at the top of the seam was only evident after the increase in myricaceous pollen started (see Methner et al., 2019; Fig.Â S6). In SeamÂ 2 the values of myricaceous pollen and P. subhercynicus are again not correlated with the isotope values (Fig.Â S6). Only the increase in Sphagnum spores is associated with an increase in Î´13C values coinciding with the end of CIEÂ 2 (Methner et al., 2019). Therefore, main changes in the peat-forming vegetation show a distinct correlation with the carbon isotope signal only in the Main Seam, but not in SeamÂ 1 and SeamÂ 2 where local processes therefore did not have a strong influence on the carbon isotope signal. Although changes in the vegetation are fundamentally controlled by regional environmental changes, the pattern of Î´13C values in the Main SeamÂ suggests that global processes such as climate change during the PETM may have played an additional role for the composition of the vegetation during deposition of the Main Seam. This is especially true for the extreme increase in myricaceous pollen in the Main Seam compared to their increase in SeamsÂ 1 and 2, thus indicating that climatic changes may have enhanced environmental changes within the peat-forming vegetation.\n\n4.4.2âCIEÂ 2 (ETM2?)\n\nMethner et al.Â (2019) suggested that the two negative Î´13CTOC excursions at the transition of SeamÂ 1 to InterbedÂ 2 and in the lower part of SeamÂ 2 represent a single CIE (CIEÂ 2 of the present paper) embracing a pronounced Apectodinium acme with mass occurrences of different species of Apectodinium in InterbedÂ 2 and discussed a possible relation to the PETM. However, this excursion (â1.3ââ° mean decrease in Î´13CTOC, TableÂ 2) is smaller than CIEÂ 1 in the Main SeamÂ and other CIEs associated with the PETM in the terrestrial realm (McInerney and Wing, 2011), thus implying another post-PETM hyperthermal (Methner et al., 2019).\n\nDownload\n\nWe are now able to assign InterbedÂ 2 with the distinct Apectodinium acme (Riegel et al., 2012) to the dinocyst zones D5nb or D6 (Fig.Â 2). Correlation with the eustatic sea level fluctuations limits deposition of SeamÂ 1 and SeamÂ 2 with InterbedÂ 2 to a time between 53.7 and 55.1âMa (Fig.Â 9). This includes the ETM2 or H1 event at 54.05âMa, which did not reach the intensity of the PETM (Westerhold et al., 2017) and is therefore a good candidate for CIEÂ 2. According to Sluijs et al.Â (2008) the ETM2 was also associated with a transgression in the North Sea Basin, which could well correlate with the change from terrestrial to marine deposits at the top of SeamÂ 1.\n\nHowever, CIEÂ 2 still cannot be unequivocally correlated (see Methner et al., 2019). According to Cramer et al.Â (2003) and Westerhold et al.Â (2017, 2018b) some minor CIEs such as the E1âE2, F, and G events can be recognized in marine records between the PETM and the ETM2 event (Fig.Â 9). Some negative Î´13C excursions in a terrestrial to shallow marine lower Eocene section in the DieppeâHampshire Basin in Normandy (France) were putatively linked to these events (Garel et al., 2020). Such a comparison may also work for CIEÂ 2 in the SchÃ¶ningen Formation, especially for the F (55.17âMa, Westerhold et al., 2017) and G (54.99âMa, Cramer et al., 2003; Westerhold et al., 2017) events with ages approximating the age of SeamÂ 1 (Fig.Â 9).\n\n4.4.3âCIEsÂ 3â6 (EECO)\n\nThe interval between SeamÂ 3 and SeamÂ 6 can be assigned to a period between 53 and 50âMa (Fig.Â 9) that corresponds well to the EECO (53.26â49.14âMa) as described from marine records (Westerhold et al., 2018b). According to the age model presented here, the terminal cooling phase of the EECO is not represented in the present dataset since it is probably situated above SeamÂ 6.\n\nThe onset of the EECO, which is placed at the JÂ event at 53.62âMa (Westerhold et al., 2018b; Fig.Â 9), is difficult to locate in the present Î´13CTOC data from the SchÃ¶ningen Formation, since the values remain low in InterbedÂ 3 and do not show significant fluctuations (Fig.Â 4). However, correlation with the eustatic sea level (Fig.Â 2) dates SeamÂ 3 to an interval between 52.5 and 53.1âMa, which is a negligible difference to the 53.5âMa suggested by Brandes et al.Â (2012) since peat accumulation of SeamÂ 3 in any case started after the JÂ event.\n\nThe phase of high-amplitude isotope fluctuations between SeamsÂ 4 and 6 (Fig.Â 9) is characterized by highly variable Î´13CTOC values including subordinate CIEs, which followed a phase of fairly stable values in InterbedsÂ 3 and 4. However, within this interval none of the numerous minor CIEs generally characterizing the EECO (Westerhold et al., 2017; Fig.Â 9) can currently be assigned to any specific CIEÂ in the SchÃ¶ningen section. However, in general, the carbon isotope data from SchÃ¶ningen reflect the global pattern of Î´13C data for this part of the EECO. This is further supported by the tentative correlation of a Kâ/ âAr age of 52.8âÂ±â1.4âMa from the Emmerstedt core (Ahrendt et al., 1995) with the part of our section at SchÃ¶ningen between SeamÂ 3 and SeamÂ 6 (Riegel et al., 2012, Fig.Â 9).\n\nAbels, H.
