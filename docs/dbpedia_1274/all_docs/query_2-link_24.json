        "text": "The times that followed were, from an archaeologist's point of view, less exciting and it was not until the Early Middle Ages that Schöningen (748) and Helmstedt (952) were first mentioned in imperial and royal documents.\n\nVisitors coming to the area cannot but be fascinated by the encounter with the history of the Middle Ages, unparalleled by any other period in Europe. Witnesses to that epoch are the Romanesque churches and chapels, the monasteries and convents such as the imperial Cathedral of Königslutter, also known as the Convent Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, located on the edge of the Elm Hills. One of the most beautiful Romanesque edifices in Germany, it is the burial place of Emperor Lothar III, born in Süpplingenburg, and his family. To this day, it is a manifestation of the Emperor's immense national - and international - power.\n\nAnother important event in the history of the District of Helmstedt was the foundation of a university in the town of Helmstedt in 1576 by Julius Duke of Braunschweig-Luneburg, which soon became the principal seat of Protestant learning in the Empire of the time. It was due to the university's fine reputation as well as its outstanding teachers - among them such well-known personalities as Calixt, Caselius, Beireis or Giordano Bruno, the Italian freethinker who was later burned in the Italian Inquisition - that as many as 1,500 students were enrolled at the university annually.\n\nIn 1810, King Jerôme Bonaparte closed the university and had it incorporated into what later became the University of Göttingen, thus terminating the 250-year history of scientific teaching and learning at Helmstedt.\n\nToday, the historic main building of the former university, the Juleum, is both the cultural centre of the town and again a place of scientific learning.\n\nSo, starting from the winter semester of 2003/2004, some classes of the MBA course recently introduced at the Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg will be held at the Juleum.\n\nLikewise, the so-called University Days, an annual event which the town of Helmstedt has been organising since the fall of the Berlin Wall, underline the long-standing tradition of the building. The objective of the project is to discuss how the disparate developments of the two German states and, as a consequence, of the people on either side of the Iron Curtain have been and are being reflected in scientific research.\n\nTo this date, the most conspicuous features of the townscape are its more than 400 half-timbered houses dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, many of which used to be professor's residential houses, thus bearing witness to the town's famous academic past.\n\nIn 1833, the District of Helmstedt was established.\n\nWith the collapse of the Nazi regime in 1945 and the erection of an ever more rigid border protections system by the communist regime of the then German Democratic Republic the town of Helmstedt found itself geographically and economically isolated in the zonal border area. More than 40 years later, after the fall of the Iron Curtain in November 1989, the District of Helmstedt has regained its position in the geographic centre of Germany.\n\nToday, multiple cultural assets and events, some of which are unique, add a special touch to life and work in the area. There are numerous exhibitions, museums, collections and galleries, such as"
