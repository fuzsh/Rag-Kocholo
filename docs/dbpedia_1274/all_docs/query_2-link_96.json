        "text": "Alburquerque is in the Extremadura region of Spain. It is an agricultural village of about 6000 people nestled at the foot of a 13th century castle. A Moorish stone wall surrounds the castle and village. Olive and Cork trees dominate the landscape, making Alburquerque a prime supplier of Cork to all of Spain. An annual Medieval Festival is held in August. Our city of Albuquerque, NM, was named to honor the duke.\n\nLocated in the northeast region of Ukraine, Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, has been targeted by Russian attacks since the start of the Russia-Ukraine War in 2022, but according to recent reports, citizens are beginning to return to the city. On June 29 the City of Albuquerque announced intention to establish a Sister Cities International (SCI) relationship with the city of Kharkiv. The partnership was celebrated virtually by both Albuquerque and Kharkiv, with Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov attending.\n\nAlbuquerque officials and Mayor Keller hope to support Mayor Terekhov and Kharkiv residents during the reconstruction of the city, with damages estimated to be around $50 billion. “We’re grateful to foster a relationship with Kharkiv that transcends borders and promotes peace and understanding,” said Mayor Tim Keller. “The people and leadership of Kharkiv are incredibly resilient, and we stand in solidarity with our Ukrainian friends, especially as they defend their democracy against Russian invasion.”\n\nA scenic seaport village as different from Tokyo as Albuquerque is from New York, Sasebo is known world-wide for beautiful pottery. Some kilns and factories have been operated by the same families for over 17 generations. Visitors can walk across the Obon-Albuquerque Bridge (right), dedicated to the special friendship between the two cities. Sasebo’s population is about 251,000 with many employed in fishing, farming, small industries and ship-building."
