        "text": "Helmstedt (pronunciation: [ˈhɛlmˌʃtɛt]) is a town (25,728 inhabitants end 2018) on the eastern edge of the German state of Lower Saxony, east of Braunschweig. It is the capital of the District of Helmstedt. The historic university and Hanseatic city conserves an important monumental heritage of Romanesque and Renaissance buildings, as well as numerous timber framed houses. The nearby Bundesautobahn was the site of the Helmstedt–Marienborn border crossing, the most important on the former inner German border as starting point of the shortest land route between West Germany and West Berlin.\n\nHelmstedt is situated in a basin between the Elm and Lappwald hill ranges, at the transition area between the northern foothills of the Harz mountains and the North German Plain. It is surrounded by the Elm-Lappwald Nature Park.\n\nThe municipal area includes the localities of Barmke and Emmerstedt, both incorporated by a 1974 administrative reform, as well as the resort town of Bad Helmstedt, east of the town centre.\n\nHistorically in the Duchy of Brunswick.\n\nPostmark in Germany\n\nCode 38350\n\nAllied Occupation Postmarks\n\nHelmstedt belonged to RPD Braunschweig, PLZ 20b, in the British Zone of occupation (PLZ 20 before October 1946).\n\nPostmark in German Empire\n\nPostmark in North German Confederation\n\nSince 1 January 1868.\n\nPostmark from the Duchy of Brunswick"
