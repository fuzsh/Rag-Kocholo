        "text": "Geography\n\nHelmstedt is situated in a basin between the Elm and Lappwald hill ranges, at the transition area between the northern foothills of the Harz mountains and the North German Plain. It is surrounded by the Elm-Lappwald Nature Park. The town centre is located about 36 kilometres (22 mi) east of Braunschweig, 45 kilometres (28 mi) west of Magdeburg, and 90 kilometres (56 mi) east of the state capital Hanover.\n\nThe municipal area includes the localities of Barmke and Emmerstedt, both incorporated by a 1974 administrative reform, as well as the resort town of Bad Helmstedt, about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) east of the town centre. Helmstedt currently has about 23,000 inhabitants (2013).\n\nHistory\n\nThe settlement in the Duchy of Saxony was first mentioned as Helmonstede in a 952 deed issued by the German king Otto I. In former times also called Helmstädt, the town developed in the vicinity of the Benedictine St. Ludger's Abbey that was founded around 800 by Saint Liudger as a mission station. Helmstedt's town privileges were documented in 1247. It belonged to the Abbacy of Werden until 1490, when it was bought by the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. From 1576 to 1810, the University of Helmstedt was located here.\n\nFrom the late 1940s to 1990, the town was the site of a major border crossing between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. The main rail and autobahn route between West Germany and Berlin, across the GDR, began at the Helmstedt–Marienborn border crossing, also known as Checkpoint Alpha. Official military traffic from NATO countries to West Berlin was only allowed to use this route.\n\nFamous citizens\n\nFranz Heinrich Ludolf Ahrens, (1809-1881), philologist\n\nBibiana Beglau, (born 1971), actress\n\nVictor von Bruns, (1812–1883), physician and plastic surgeon\n\nGeorg Fein (1803–1869), journalist and democratic politicians of Vormärz, founder and organizer of Workers' Educational Association s\n\nPeter Feldmann (born 1958), politician, mayor (SPD) of Frankfurt since 2012\n\nJohann Andreas Graeffer (1746–1802) botanist and nurseryman remembered by garden historians as having introduced a number of exotic plants to British gardens\n\nFriedrich Karl Otto von Heinemann (1824–1904), historian, director of the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel\n\nJohann Christian Friedrich Heyer (1793–1873), the first missionary who was sent abroad by Lutherans in the US\n\nHans Krebs, (1898–1945), military officer and chief of staff of the Wehrmacht\n\nRudolf Leuckart, (1822–1898), biologist and founder of parasitology\n\nAnton August Heinrich Lichtenstein, (1753-1816), zoologist and librarian\n\nJohann Heinrich Meibom (1590–1655), German physician and professor of medicine at the University of Helmstedt\n\nKarl Reinhard (1769–1840), writer and editor of the Göttingen Musenalmanachs\n\nTheodor von Schubert (1758–1825), astronomer\n\nPaul Gottlieb Werlhof (1699–1767), Royal Hanoverian court physician and poet\n\nAndree Wiedener, (born 1970), footballer, last active for Eintracht Frankfurt\n\nIn addition, see the list of famous students and professors of the University of Helmstedt.\n\nTwinnings\n\nVitré, France since 1978\n\nChard, United Kingdom since 1980\n\nAlbuquerque, United States since 1983\n\nFiuggi, Italy since 1986(0@0)\n\nHaldensleben, Germany since 1990\n\nSvetlahorsk, Belarus since 1991\n\nOrăştie, Romania since 2002"
