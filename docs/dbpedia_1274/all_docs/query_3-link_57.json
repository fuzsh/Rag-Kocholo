        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nDefined by the Oxford dictionary as “a person, a place, or a thing after whom or which someone or something is, or is believed to be, named,” eponyms have become extremely prevalent in medicine. There is debate, however, as to whether they should be abandoned.1-5 That they offer recognition and reward for the discoverer and provide a historical context for the scientific discovery, and they provide a common and, perhaps, an easier expression for the clinician, the academician, the student, and the teacher are arguments in their favor. There are many, however, against the use of eponyms. Some3 opine that they may be undeserved (e.g., Takayasu disease, Lister’s tubercle, Arnold-Chiari malformation) or that they may celebrate unworthy individuals (Reiter, Wegener: both with the Nazi party and who persecuted Jews) or that they may be inaccurate (Circle of Willis was described by Lo and Willis and not Willis alone; Reynolds pentad was described by Reynolds and Dargan, not Reynolds alone.) In an editorial on the “eponym problem,” Organ and Sojka4 list more objections to their use, joke: “This fad has progressed to the stage where the slogan now is, “If in doubt, just say Morgagni.”4 Despite this controversy, eponyms are long ingrained in literature and are unlikely to disappear soon. This author is a proponent of the use of eponyms.\n\nThe aim of this report is to briefly describe selected eponyms that are recalled in everyday clinical discussions in the field of the biliary tract and its diseases. A biographical sketch of the lives of these pioneers is capsulized.\n\nGlisson’s Capsule1,2,6\n\nFrancis Glisson (1597–1677), Figure 1 was born in the village of Rampisham in Dorset to William and Mary Glisson. He obtained a medical degree from Cambridge in 1634.1,2,6 At the age of 48 became a founding member of the famous Royal Society of London. In 1666, he became the President of the College of Physicians, London.6 In his greatest publication, Anatomia Hepatis, in 1654 he described the capsule investing the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile duct.1,2,6 He was also the first to describe a sphincteric mechanism around the orifice of the common duct. He published four books, including stomach and intestines. He died at the age of 80. An exhaustive account of controversies about Glisson’s life and his works can be found in Walker’s lecture to the Royal College of Surgeons, England, in 1966.6\n\nFig. 1: Francis Glisson (source: Wikimedia commons)\n\nHartmann’s Pouch1,2,7-9\n\nHenri Hartmann (1860–1952), Figure 2, was born on 16th June 1860, and was a lifelong Parisian. Hartmann’s tenacity in his character was inherited from his mother, who apparently learned Greek just to test him. After medical school at the University of Paris, he trained under the famous French surgeon Felix Terrier. He was an intern in 1881, an assistant professor in 1895, and a full professor in 1909. In 1914, Hartmann accepted the position of Chief of Surgery at Hotel-Dieu, the oldest and most famous hospital in Paris, where his surgical procedures in 20 years numbered close to 1000, and he meticulously recorded over 30,000 operative procedures.1,2,7-9 Hartmann learned about Pasteur and became an avid follower of asepsis.\n\nFig. 2: Herb Hartmann (source: Wikimedia commons)\n\nIn 1891, Hartmann described the ampulla of the gallbladder as a vesicle or pouch, now called Hartmann’s pouch. He also published about tumors of the breast, the urinary tract, and gynecology. He was famous, of course, for Hartmann’s procedure for rectal cancer and sigmoid diverticulitis, an operation he presented at the 30th Congress of the French Surgical Association in 1921. The 16th June 2021 was instituted as Hartmann Day and celebrated the invention to mark 100 years since the publication of the operation.1,2,7-9\n\nHartmann was a prolific writer publishing into his 91st year on such varied topics as war injuries, dislocations, and solid cancers.7-9 He detailed the technique of hysterectomy, the surgical management of salpingitis and chorionepitheliomas, the lymphatic drainage of gastric cancer, and the anatomy of the coeliac axis, and published a treatise on shoulder dislocation. His major work was Chirurgie du Rectum (1895–1899) and a nine volume series Travaux de Chirurgie Anatomo-clinique, published periodically on different specialties from 1903 until his 90th year. Other notable firsts were: curative pyloric resection for cancer, surgery for choledochal cyst, a series of the ampulla of Vater excisions and parotidectomies, successful splenectomies in France for hemolytic jaundice and surgical excision of esophageal diverticula. He was the first to describe adult hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and the first to report the surgical management of appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei.7-9\n\nHartmann was awarded many honors during his life.7-9 He received an honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (England and Ireland) in 1913, an honorary Fellowship of the American Surgical Association and Presidencies of the French Academy of Medicine (1936), French Surgical Society (1919), Congress of Surgery (1921), International Congress of Surgery (1929), and an Honorary Fellowship of the Philadelphia Academy of Surgery in 1929. Hartmann lost his wife in 1951. On the 1st January 1952, at the age of 91, after his guests had left the annual meeting at his home, he slipped on the stairs and fell to his death.9\n\nThe Valves of Heister1,2,10,11\n\nLorenz Heister, Figure 3, considered the founder of scientific surgery in Germany, was born in Frankfurt-am-Main. Heister was able to achieve an outstanding education at the University of Giessen and in Leyden, Holland, thanks to his father.1,2 Heister finished a doctorate in medicine in 1708 at the University of Helmstedt in Germany. Sponsored by his professor, Frederic Ruysch, he became a professor of anatomy and surgery in 1719 at the University of Helmstedt; later, the professorship of botany was also added.1,2 Heister’s botanical garden in Helmstedt was considered one of the most beautiful in Germany.1,11 His major work was Chirugia, a treatise of surgery and the most popular work of the 18th century. He also wrote expositions on ophthalmology, botany, and physics, among others. Heister made the first postmortem dissection of appendicitis and also introduced and described a tracheotomy procedure.1,2,10,11\n\nFig. 3: Lorenz Heister (source: Wikimedia commons)\n\nIn an important publication, Compendium Anatomicum, he described the valves in the proximal mucosa in the cystic duct 1732. These spiral valves of Heister were thought to prevent distention or collapse of the cystic duct when sudden changes in pressure occur in the gallbladder or common duct.1,2,10,11 He died at the age of 91 on 3th April 1760.1,11\n\nCalot’s Triangle1,2,12\n\nJean-Francois Calot, Figure 4, was born in Arlens, France, and worked as a surgeon in the Rothschild Hospital and the Hospital Cazin-Perrochaud. His main interest was bone tuberculosis, and his method of forced realignment for gibbus deformity was called “Calot’s operation.” In 1901, he founded his own institute of orthopedics, which still exists as the “Institut Calot.”1,2 In his doctorate thesis written in Paris in 1890, “De La Cholecystectomie,” he described an isosceles triangle with the base the common hepatic duct, the inferior edge the cystic duct, and the superior border the cystic artery. The “Calot’s triangle” now has the edge of the liver as the superior border. This anatomical zone may host such vital structures as the cystic artery, the right hepatic artery, the accessory right hepatic artery, or the accessory bile ducts and a ganglion (node) called Mascagni’s node and Calot’s node.2 He was a deeply religious man, he died in his sleep at the age of 83. His four brothers were priests.1\n\nFig. 4: Jean-Francois Calot (source: Wikimedia commons)\n\nCourvoisier’s Gallbladder1,2,13,14\n\nCourvoisier, Figure 5, was born in Basel, Switzerland. As a medical student, he published and won a prize for “The Histology of the Sympathetic Nervous System.”1,2 He studied with distinguished scientists such as Billroth, Czerny, Fergusson, and Spencer Wells in Europe. After serving in the army, he returned to Basel in 1883 and established a private clinic. He declined the directorship of the university clinic at the University of Basel in 1900, believing it should go to a younger man. In 1988 the University conferred on him Extra-ordinary Professor of Surgery.1,2\n\nFig. 5: Ludwig Courvoisier (source: Wikipedia)\n\nThe biliary tract was Courvoisier’s prime interest, and he wrote numerous articles on diseases and the management of biliary tract disorders. He was the first to describe the removal of a stone from the common bile duct.1 In his monograph in 1890, the pathology and surgery of the biliary tract, he discussed different types of ductal obstruction. A direct translation from his German text was given by Fitzgerald et al.:13 “In a collection of 187 cases, two main groups were usable for this investigation: 87 stone obstructions and 100 other obstructions. Because of their approximately same numerical strength, they can be compared well. Gallbladder atrophy with stone obstruction (70:87 cases = 80.4%) was more common than rare ectasia (17:87 = 19.6%). With other causes of obstruction to the choledochus, it is rarer to see atrophy (8:100) than ectasia (92:100). Or differently expressed, with stone obstruction of the choledochus, ectasia of the gallbladder is rare; usually, the organ has already shrunk. Ectasia is usual with obstruction of other kinds; atrophy exists in only 1 of 12 of these cases.” Courvoisier also made many contributions to entomology, a popular treatise on the care of the sick in the home, a monograph on neuroma, and a description of posterior gastroenterostomy for carcinoma of the pylorus.2,14 His great collection of butterflies was bequeathed to the botanical Institute and his collection of butterflies to the Natural History Museum of Basel.1\n\nMurphy Sign1,2,15-18\n\nJohn Benjamin Murphy, Figure 6, will be best remembered for his clinical sign that is used in evaluating patients with acute cholecystitis. He was born to Irish immigrant parents on a farm in Appleton, Wisconsin, on 21th December 1857. He graduated from Rush Medical College in 1879 at 22 years of age. In 1882, he went to Vienna, Berlin, Heidelberg, Munich, and London to advance his medical training.1,2\n\nFig. 6: John Benjamin Murphy (source: FACS.org)\n\nHe served as a professor of clinical surgery in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago from 1892 to 1901. He was a Professor of Surgery at Northwestern University, Rush Medical College from 1905 to 1908 and Professor of Surgery at the Postgraduate Medical School of Chicago and the Chicago Clinical School. He was President of the Chicago Medical Society from 1904 to 1905 and of the American Medical Association from 1911 to 1912. He was the founder of the American College of Surgeons and President of the Clinical Congress of Surgeons of North America. He also was a member of the Board of Regents of the American Surgical Association beginning in 1913 and an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, England.1,2,15-18\n\nOther eponyms associated with him include Murphy drip, Murphy’s button, Murphy’s punch, Murphy’s test, and Murphy-Lane bone skid. His other pioneering works include the performance of end-to-end anastomosis of hollow viscera, early surgical intervention in cases of appendicitis, use of pneumothorax to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, surgical intervention for prostate cancer, and reconstruction of ankylosed joints. His expertise, thus, extended to vast areas, including general surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and cardiothoracic surgery. In 1897, he published an article on end-to-end anastomosis of vessels that was pioneering work in the field of vascular surgery. In 1889 he published a collection of >250 cases of appendectomy over 4 years.15,16\n\nIn 1892, at the age of 35, Murphy designed Murphy’s button that, in his own words, “...would revolutionize intestinal surgery.” Murphy’s button is a mechanical device that allows the approximation of hollow viscera without sutures.15-18\n\nHis ego and his proclivity for publicity made him unpopular with his colleagues. His huge surgical practice in Chicago and his considerable wealth were envied widely.1\n\nAt Mercy Hospital in Chicago, Murphy conducted “wet clinics” in which he operated and taught in front of an audience. In order to disseminate his presentations to a wider audience, he started the publication, The Surgical Clinics of John B. Murphy, Doctor of Medicine (MD), at Mercy Hospital, Chicago. This publication formed the basis for The Surgical Clinics of Chicago, which was later named The Surgical Clinics of North America.1,2,15,16\n\nIn 1904, along with Franklin H Martin, he launched a journal, “Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics.” It later became the “Journal of the American College of Surgeons.”15,16 He was the first to start the “Yearbook of Surgery”, which still exists today.16\n\nMurphy married an 18-year-old former patient. Their family tragedies, sadly, were rather frequent. They lost their first child, a son, to diphtheria at 6 weeks, even though Murphy tried to save him with a tracheostomy. The same year saw his sister and two brothers die from tuberculosis. Later, he lost one of his four daughters to measles. Murphy died on 11th August 1916, on Mackinac Island, Michigan, of aortitis after suffering from angina.1 A complete narrative of Murphy, his life, and his accomplishments can be found in reference 16.\n\nDucts of Luschka1,2,19-22\n\nHubert von Luschka, Figure 7, was born on 27th July 1820, in Konstanz, Germany. He began studying medicine in 1841 at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Freiburg. He became a professor in anatomy and pathology at the University of Tubingen, and in 1855, he took over the position of the director of the prestigious anatomical institute. He is considered the foremost anatomist of the 19th century and published three volumes of clinical anatomy between 1862 and 1867. His name also describes two lateral foramina in the fourth ventricle and small intervertebral synovial joints in cervical vertebrae. In 1865 he became a noble. After his first wife died after 13 years of marriage, leaving him with a young son and daughter, he married two more times.1\n\nFig. 7: Herbert Von Luschka (source: Wikipedia)\n\nThere are varying descriptions of the duct of Luschka in the biliary system. Most authors describe the duct of Luschka as one or more small bile duct(s) located in the gallbladder fossa that branch(es) from the right common hepatic duct and have a blind proximal end, not draining any liver parenchyma.19-21 Others have suggested that the duct of Luschka is a small bile duct running along the gallbladder fossa, draining bile from the liver parenchyma directly into the gallbladder. These ducts may be injured during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cause biliary leakage or a biloma.19-21\n\nBoonstra et al.22 carefully examined the original work by von Luschka on the hepatobiliary system and were not able to find a description of either one of the two structures that are nowadays referred to as “the duct of Luschka.” Luschka, however, did describe dimples in the wall of bile ducts, which he considers to be a sort of gland. Von Luschka called these anatomical structures “drüssen,” which can be translated as “grapes.” Most of these glands described by von Luschka were found in the intrahepatic bile ducts and in the common bile duct. To a much smaller extent, these dimples were seen in the gallbladder wall. Perhaps these are now called Luschka’s ducts.22 In a systematic review, Schnelldorfer and associates19 clarified “subvesical bile ducts” replace the incorrect term “ducts of Luschka.”\n\nMirizzi Syndrome1,2,23\n\nPablo Luis Mirizzi, Figure 8, was a surgeon from Argentina, born in the city of Cordoba in 1893. He graduated from the Medical Sciences School at the National University of Cordoba in 1915. At the age of 25 years, he was appointed assistant professor of surgery at the same university. During the next few years, he traveled abroad to the most renowned surgical centers in the United States of America and Europe. After he returned to Argentina 1926, he became a full professor of surgery. In 1931, Mirizzi performed the first operative cholangiography, which is considered his main contribution to modern biliary surgery. He postulated in 1948 a functional spasm of the “common hepatic duct sphincter” was the cause of obstructive jaundice in patients with chronic or acute gallstone disease. The syndrome that Mirizzi described consisted of an uncommon and benign cause of obstructive jaundice caused by a gallstone impacted at the Hartmann’s pouch, gallbladder infundibulum, or the cystic duct and its associated inflammatory process, thereby causing obstruction of the common hepatic duct.\n\nFig. 8: Pablo Mirizzi (source: LITFL.COM)\n\nPablo Luis Mirizzi was recognized during his lifetime as a great surgeon, a great teacher, and a great humanitarian physician. In 1955, he was named Honorary Professor of the National University of Cordoba. In 1956, the “Sociedad Argentina de Cirugía” honored him with the title “Cirujano Maestro.” Afterward, numerous surgical academies and societies around the world awarded him honorary memberships. In 1957, he was made President of the International Surgical Congress, the first time that a Latin-American surgeon had received such a high honor. In 1968, a small city square was named after him,1 Pablo Luis Mirizzi died in his city, Cordoba, on 28th August 1964.\n\nHe left his art collection to the “Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes Emilio Caraffa,” donated his medical library to the Medical Sciences School of the National University of Cordoba, and established a biennial traveling surgical scholarship in biliary surgery to be awarded to distinguished young surgeons from Cordoba.1,23\n\nCharcot’s Triad1,24,25\n\nJean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893), Figure 9, “The Napoleon of Neuroses” was a Professor of Pathological Anatomy at the University of Paris in 1872 and Professor of Neurology in 1882. Charcot’s triad is the combination of jaundice, fever, usually with rigors, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, due to ascending cholangitis.1,24,25\n\nFig. 9: Jean Martin Charcot (source Wikimedia commons)\n\nCharcot replaced traditional ward rounds with theatrical clinical demonstrations and patient interviews on a floodlit stage in the amphitheater of the Salpêtrière. His experiments in hypnosis and clinical demonstrations were open to the public. This novel teaching method was thought to have influenced Sigmund Freud, one of Charcot’s students in neurology, to become interested in the psychological origins of neuroses.1,24 Such a great influence was Charcot on Freud that Freud named his first son after his teacher. Charcot is the founder of modern neurology.1,24,25\n\nCharcot, originally a pathologist, popularized the relationship between clinical and anatomical findings. This led to the correlation between the clinical features of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the pathological changes he had noted at autopsy. The Charcot award is still presented every two years for research into MS.25\n\nCharcot was a music lover, especially Beethoven’s. He set aside Thursday evenings for it. He was also very fond of animals and refused animal experimentation. One of his several pets was a monkey named Rosalie and a gift from a Brazilian emperor. It is said that his dislike of the English was at least partly from their enjoyment of foxhunting.1,24\n\nHe died suddenly from heart failure in 1893. In 1895, a bronze statue of Charcot was erected outside the entrance of the Salpêtrière paid for by contributions from his pupils. Unfortunately, it was removed during the German occupation of Paris. France issued a commemorative stamp in his honor in 19601 Charcot’s son, Jean-Baptise, who was also a physician became a maritime explorer and named an island in Antarctica as a homage to his father.24,25 A delightful, illustrated account of Charcot’s life is presented by Cooke.24\n\nReynolds and Dargan Pentad26\n\nWhen low blood pressure and mental status changes are added to Charcot’s triad, it is known as Reynolds’ pentad. In 1959, Benedict M Reynolds (1925–2019), Figure 10 and Everett L Dargan, Figure 11, American general surgeons working in New York City, published this pentad in a small case series of four patients, all of whom had obstructive cholangitis due to calculi. All responded well to urgent decompression of the common duct.\n\nFig. 10: Benedict M. Reynolds (source: http://www.mcgrathandson.com/obituaries)\n\nFig. 11: Everett Dargan (source: sc.edu)\n\nReynolds received his medical degree from New York University in 1948 and was a Professor of Surgery at New York Medical College and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He was a Director of Surgery at Misericordia Hospital 1962–1983, and Chairman of the Department of Surgery 1976–1982. He was known for his surgical dexterity and teaching.27\n\nEverett L. Dargan28,29 is a retired cardiothoracic surgeon and educator from. Columbia, S.C. He finished his surgical training at Bronx Municipal Hospital of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. After serving in United States Air Force during the Korean War, he completed cardiovascular and thoracic surgery training at Boston City Hospital. He joined the staff at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and served as chief of surgery at Sydenham and Lincoln Hospitals. He was inducted into the Order of the Palmetto, Kappa Pi, and Alpha Omega Alpha medical honor societies. He was a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons and received a Congressional tribute in 2005. The same year, the University of South Carolina School of Medicine established a scholarship in surgical residency to recruit underrepresented minority students to honor Dargan’s legacy as a teacher and physician.28,29 Incidentally, Reynolds was the author’s surgical program director, and Dargan was the former Chief of Surgery at the author’s alma mater, Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx.\n\nMorison’s Pouch1,2,30,31\n\nJames Rutherford Morison, Figure 12, was born in 1853. Graduating as a doctor of medicine at Edinburgh in 1857, he became a full surgeon at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle at the age of 35 and a Professor of Surgery in 1910. Morison was a popular teacher, a practical surgeon, and a great technician. He introduced omentopexy as a cure for ascites. He was among the first to worry about retained sponges during surgery (attaching a porcelain ball to cotton balls) and wrong side operations (He would mark the side of the operation with a big X). He described Morison’s pouch in 1894 and published extensively on orthopaedic conditions. He died in Newcastle upon Tyne on 9thJanuary 1939.\n\nFig. 12: James Rutherford Morison (source: Wikipedia)\n\nForamen of Winslow1,2\n\nWinslow, Figure 13, was born on 9th April 1669 in Odense on the Island of Funen, Denmark. In 1697, having obtained a royal scholarship, he moved to the Netherlands to study anatomy, medicine and surgery. At age 30 Winslow repudiated the religion of his family, Lutheranism, and embraced Catholicism. His parents disowned him and withdrew financial support as did the King of Denmark.1,2 With the support of the bishop of Meaux and the faculty of University of Paris, he finished his degree in 1705. The Royal Academy of Science appointed him professor of anatomy, a position which he occupied for >40 years.1\n\nFig. 13: Winslow (source: Wikipedia)\n\nIn Paris in 1732, Winslow published the Exposition Anatomigue de la Structure du Corps Humain, an authoritative four volume work which was the standard reference in anatomy for the following 100 years2; the source of the eponym, The foramen epiploicum was sometimes called Duverney’ s foramen and even later Scarpa’ s foramen.2 He gave the sympathetic nervous system its name.1 He married in 1711 and had two children, but his son died in early childhood. He had to retire in 1758 due to extreme deafness.1\n\nThe Papilla of Vater1,2,3\n\nAbraham Vater, Figure 14, described in 1720 the tubercule or diverticulum as “those double ducts (bile and pancreatic ducts) that come together in no single combination.” Vater described not an ampulla but an elevation of the mucosa in the duodenum. Some authors32 believe that the first descriptions actually were made by Santorini, rather than Vater. They also believe that the papilla and or ampulla are best described by the more accurate “hepatopancreatic ampula” and major (or duodenal) papilla respectively and not be the eponymous name “papilla of Vater.”\n\nFig. 14: Abraham Vater (source: Wikimedia commons)\n\nAbraham Vater, was born on 9th December 1684 in Wittenberg, where he studied and obtained a doctor’s degree in philosophy. After studying in Leipzig, He continued his scientific pursuits in Belgium, Germany, England, and Holland before returning to his home town. He was named professor of anatomy and botany in 1733 and professor of pathology in 1737. He established an unusual rich and famous museum, gave anatomic demonstrations for women, and had corpses of suicides handed over for anatomic dissection. Nine years later, in 1746, he was appointed chair of therapeutics, considered the highest academic position at the time.1 He also wrote about small pox vaccination, >70 years before Jenner. He died in 1751 at the age of 67 after being associated with the Academy of Medicine for 43 years.1\n\nSphincter of Oddi1,2,33-35\n\nRuggero Oddi, Figure 15, was born in Perugia, Italy in 1864. He identified the common bile duct sphincter along with physiologic aspects of this structure as a 23-year-old 4th year medical student.34 He received his MD degree in 1889 in Bologna and later transferred to Institute of Physiology in Florence. Oddi was the first to measure the resistance of the sphincter and to demonstrate that removal of the gallbladder causes dilation of the bile ducts. He became director of the Physiology Institute in Genoa at the age of 29. He carried out numerous physiologic studies on the nervous system, the brain, and the spinal cord as well as studies on metabolism and respiratory exchange.1,2,33,34\n\nFig. 15: Ruggerio Oddi (source: National Library of Medicine)\n\nIn their superb review of the tragic life of Oddi, Modlin and Ahman35 described the travails of Oddi and they are paraphrased here. On 15th October 1891, at the age of 27 years, Oddi married the 23-year-old Teresa Bresciani Bartoli. In June 1891. Their first daughter Adelaide was born, followed by a second child, Enrico in March 1893. In 1901, Oddi strangely commented that he lost the greatest affection that he had ever had and his scientific profession.35 Oddi became associated with an aristocrat Capranica. Though not a MD, Capranica established a biochemistry laboratory in his family’s palace and offered the lab to the Medical School of Genoa. On the death of his mistress, Capranica became addicted to morphine and died in 1899. The laboratory was confiscated. Litigation issues culminated in a major collision with the academic senate of the faculty. Oddi resigned and moved to Brussels and later to Congo. In Boma, Congo the colonial service judged him either too ill or incompetent to perform medical work and they returned him to Belgium on 10th June 1902. His next move was to Spain where he accompanied a Spanish patient whom he had been treating with Vitaline. He stayed there for a brief period and, thereafter, returned for reasons that are unknown to live in the small town of Torgiano near Perugia. This tragic turn of events “must have had serious emotional disturbances relating to his rapid fall from the ivory towers of Italian academia to the lowly position of a homeopathic physician in a small Italian town.”35 Oddi was destroyed spiritually because of losing his scientific position. Physically, he needed an appendectomy and subsequently developed intestinal obstruction for which he required surgery. He left Perugia for Tunisia and died there in 1913 at the age of 48.35\n\nDeaver’s Retractor1,36\n\nJohn Blair Deaver, Figure 16, was born near Buck, Pennsylvania, in Lancaster County on 25th July 1855 to a country physician. Deaver attended the nation’s first medical school, the University of Pennsylvania. In 1878, he completed 1-year internships at both Germantown Hospital and Philadelphia Children’s Hospital, after which he started clinical practice with his brother and returned to the University of Pennsylvania in 1911.1,36 In 1918, he was first appointed as the John Rhea Barton Professor of Surgery and in 1922 Emeritus Professor of Surgery. Deaver published over 248 articles in journals and authored many books on abdominal surgical conditions and management. He was a founding member and the fifth President of the American College of Surgeons (1921–1922).1,36\n\nFig. 16: John Blair Deaver (source: Thomas Jefferson University Jefferson Digital Commons)\n\nDeaver performed all procedures himself. His retractor, therefore, was used by countless medical students and residents to assist with exposure. His Saturday afternoon operative clinics were attended by surgeons throughout the world while he performed as many as 25 operations in an afternoon.1 To the surgical ideals voiced by Lord Moynihan, ‘‘the heart of a lion, the eye of an eagle, and the hand of a woman,’’ Deaver immediately added ‘‘the constitution of a mule.’’1,36\n\nDeaver died 25th September 1931, at the age of 76 years. His radiologist, Henry Pancoast destroyed the radiologic films as promised to Deaver, so that the cause of his death was only presumed to be a malignancy of unknown source.1\n\nKocher Maneuver1,2,37\n\nThe son of a prominent engineer and a pious mother, Theodore Kocher, Figure 17, was born in Berne, Switzerland. Assuming the chair of surgery in Berne at the age of 31, Kocher retained that position until his death 45 years later. He was a meticulous and investigative surgeon, teacher, and inventor. Kocher visited and studied in the famous clinics of Langenbeck, Billroth, Virchow, and Lister, and in later life he was an intimate correspondent with Halsted. A prolific writer, Kocher produced many articles, monographs, and a popular, widely translated text Operative Surgery. His greatest contributions, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909, concerned the physiology and surgery of the thyroid gland.1,2,37\n\nFig. 17: Theodor Kocher (source: Wikimedia commons)\n\nOther solid contributions of Kocher were the development of aseptic technique and the management of surgical tuberculosis. His surgical interests ranged from treatment for shoulder dislocation, abdominal surgery, subcostal incision, a method of sphincteroplasty and the well-known technique for mobilization of the duodenum. Known as “Kocher’s maneuver” it has become a staple in biliary and pancreatic operative procedures. Other areas of his interest included blood-saving methods, treatment of epilepsy, antisepsis, aspiration prophylaxis, chloroform narcosis and regional anesthesia. Kocher’s mechanical ingenuity devised many instruments: a craniometer, a chloroform mask, an ether mask, artery and bowel clamps, scissors, chisels, files, wound-hooks, etc.1,2,37\n\nThere is a street and a park named after him and there are two statues of him setup in central positions in Berne. He was pictured on a postage stamp from 1967. A grateful Russian patient named a volcano in Manchuria after him.1\n\nRoux-en-Y Procedure1,2,38,39\n\nCesar Roux, Figure 18, was the fifth of 11 sons to a school teacher and was born in Mont-la-Ville in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. He considered various professions, particularly veterinary medicine. After Roux decided to study medicine, his brother, an engineer, assisted him financially in that pursuit. Roux studied medicine at Berne, surgery with Kocher, pathology with Langhans and finished his studies with a thesis on the anatomic structure of the anus. On Kocher’s advice he went to Vienna, Prague, and Holland for courses in laryngology, otology, obstetrics, and gynecology. He returned to be Kocher’s assistant for 2 years and then returned to Lausanne. Operations were performed in his office and in the country with his wife as assistant.1,2,38,39\n\nFig. 18: Cesar Roux (source: Wikipedia)\n\nAt the founding of the University of Lausanne in 1890, Roux was named professor of clinical surgery and gynecology; he was also named surgeon at the county hospital, a position he retained for 40 years. Credit goes to him for establishing education and surgery in Swiss medicine. Roux recommended appendectomy in 1883 for inflammation. He continued to study goiter and described procedures to cure hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, crural hernia, and pulmonary and orthopedic procedures. He had great interest in gastroenteric procedures and described en-Y anastomosis in 1897 for gastroenterostomy and in 1907 for bypassing eso- phagogastric neoplasm. Although the Roux-en-Y technique is no longer used for gastroenterostomy, it is frequently used today for various bypass procedures.1,2,38,39\n\nHis pupils regarded him as master and his peers honored him by membership in many French surgical organizations. He received the Commander of the Legion of Honor, honorary mayor of Lausanne and Mont-la-Ville. He was a little man, with disorderly bouffant hair, an abundant drooping moustache, and penetrating gray eyes with darts of intelligence behind the glasses. A special accent colored his speech and his repartee was full of humor and good sense.1"
