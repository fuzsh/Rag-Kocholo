        "text": "In close cooperation with Wirtschaftsregion Helmstedt GmbH and in collaboration with regional partners from business, science and politics, the project aims to help strengthen the local transformation in the areas of technology and services for the energy transition, resource efficiency through the circular economy and sustainable digital agriculture in order to increase value creation in the region. For this purpose, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft will establish an office in the Haus der Wirtschaft, the home of Wirtschaftsregion Helmstedt GmbH, from 2024 and the flag of science will then fly prominently in the district town.\n\nIn collaboration with regional companies, fields of action in the energy, circular-economy and agriculture sectors are to be identified and, with the support of the Technische Universität Braunschweig and Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, new companies are to become established and project alliances formed. The funding stems from the so-called “Kohlemittel” (coal funds), which the federal government is making available for the management of infrastructural change in the former coal-mining regions. The funding is initially limited to four years. The findings and measures for a promising transformation resulting from this pilot project are to be made available in the future to other regions in Europe and throughout the world that are affected by the fossil-fuel phase-out, thereby also increasing the prominence of the Helmstedt region.\n\nDr. Guido Hora, born in Helmstedt and Business Development Manager at the Fraunhofer IST, will be responsible for setting up the HELMIZ innovation center.\n\nOlaf Lies, Lower Saxony's Minister for Economic Affairs, Transport, Construction and Digitalization: “I am delighted that the renowned Fraunhofer institute, with its proven research expertise, is strengthening the process of structural change in the Helmstedt region. It is important that a transfer from research to the region takes place in order for innovation and, ultimately, sustainability to succeed. The funded innovation center is a further important step along the path to a successful transformation of the former coal-mining area.”\n\nThomas Klein, Managing Director of Wirtschaftsregion Helmstedt GmbH: “A further building block of our work is becoming visible. The forthcoming entrance of science into our Haus der Wirtschaft symbolizes much more than just a flag waving in front of the door; it is a visible sign that the future has long since begun in Helmstedt.”"
