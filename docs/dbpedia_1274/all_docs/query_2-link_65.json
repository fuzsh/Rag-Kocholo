This study aimed to compare the adenoma detection rates between Endocuff-assisted (EC) colonoscopy and standard colonoscopy (SC).  Methods This randomized prospective multicenter trial was conducted at four academic endoscopy units in Germany. Participants: 500 patients (235 males, median age 64[IQR 54–73]) for colon adenoma detection purposes were included in the study. All patients were either allocated to EC or SC. The primary outcome measure was the determination of the adenoma detection rates (ADR).  Results The ADR significantly increased with the use of the Endocuff compared to standard colonoscopy (35.4%[95% confidence interval{CI} 29–41%] vs. 20.7%[95%CI 15–26%], p<0.0001). Significantly more sessile polyps were detected by EC. Overall procedure time and withdrawal time did not differ. Caecal and ileum intubation rates were similar. No major adverse events occurred in both groups. In multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03; 95%[CI] 1.01–1.05), male sex (OR 1.74; 95%CI 1.10–2.73), withdrawal time (OR 1.16; 95%CI 1.05–1.30), procedure time (OR 1.07; 95%CI 1.04–1.10), colon cleanliness (OR 0.60; 95%CI 0.39–0.94) and use of Endocuff (OR 2.09; 95%CI 1.34–3.27) were independent predictors of adenoma detection rates.  Conclusions EC increases the adenoma detection rate by 14.7%(95%CI 6.9–22.5%). EC is safe, effective, easy to handle and might reduce colorectal interval carcinomas.

        "text": "Discussion\n\nColonoscopy performed within colon cancer prevention programs remains the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening. The adenoma detection rate (ADR) seems to be most crucial in preventing interval colon cancer, as a suboptimal ADR is significantly associated with a higher incidence of colon cancer [2]. In a recently published study by Corley et al. with analysis of 314872 colonoscopies, the ADR was inversely associated with the risk of interval colon cancer. Each percent increase in ADR resulted in a 3 percent decrease of colon cancer risk (HR 0.97; 95%CI 0.96–0.98) [13]. An ADR of at least 20% is generally accepted as sufficient for colon cancer prevention programs and should be the standard for colon cancer prevention centers [2]. In our study, an ADR of 20.7% in the standard colonoscopy arm was achieved. We were therefore able to consider this cohort as a representative control group.\n\nAnother aspect is the importance of the withdrawal time for the ADR. Earlier studies have shown, that insufficient withdrawal times correlate with a lower ADR and thus with a higher incidence of colorectal cancer [14], [15]. In our study, we found the withdrawal time to be an independent predictor for adenoma detection in multivariate analysis, confirming previous study results. Moreover, in our study, the median withdrawal time routinely exceeded 6 minutes in each group, which is considered sufficient for standard colonoscopy according to current guidelines [14], [16], thus excluding bias due to insufficient withdrawal times. Our study showed that Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy significantly increased the ADR by 14.7% compared to SC. Superiority of EC over SC could especially be seen in anatomic obstacles like the sigmoid.\n\nOther technical innovations like cap-assisted colonoscopy, back-to-back colonoscopy or narrow band imaging (NBI) or a combination of several methods were evaluated for higher polyp and adenoma detection rates [17]–[21]. All of these procedures have shown more or less benefit compared to standard colonoscopy. However, all future procedures with the goal of improving colonic adenoma detection need to have broad acceptance, especially in terms of procedure time and expense.\n\nIt holds true that back-to-back colonoscopy improves polyp and adenoma detection rates [20]. However, it is self evident that performing a colonoscopy twice is no option for broad endoscopic colon cancer prevention programs. Moreover, there would be serious ethical considerations when exposing the patient to the risk of a double colonoscopy.\n\nThe value of NBI or FICE techniques in the colon is critically discussed, since not all studies have shown improvement of the ADR. In a recently published randomized trial comparing NBI with high definition colonoscopy for the detection of adenomas, NBI was not able to improve the ADR [22]. Neither NBI nor FICE increased the ADR in a randomized tandem trial conducted by Chung [17].\n\nWater-immersion or water-exchange colonoscopy is a new emerging technique which is still under evaluation. However, in a recently published meta-analysis comparing water immersion and water exchange with air insufflation colonoscopy, a reduction in procedural pain could be observed, but no difference in adenoma detection [23].\n\nThe effort and the aspect of losing water through the anus makes its use doubtful for broad colon cancer prevention programs.\n\nCap-assisted colonoscopy (CAC) showed conflicting results for improving ADR. While in the study by Rastogi et al., ADR improvement was observed [3], a recently published two-center trial conducted by de Wijkersooth et al. failed to show an improvement in ADR [24]. Nevertheless, this technique seems feasible and the advantage of CAC becomes clear, especially in the right colonic flexure [25]. However, more training is likely to be necessary as compared to the endocuff due to the technical nature of CAC and its effect on the view of the examiner. A prospective randomized head-to-head comparison of CAC with EC-assisted colonoscopy is not yet available, but would be of great value.\n\nIn another recently published randomized controlled trial, conducted by Gralnek et al., the adenoma miss rate was significantly lower with the use of a novel full-spectrum endoscopy platform as compared to standard colonoscopy [21]. However, complex technical investment is necessary, making broad use in screening programs difficult.\n\nA great strength of our study is its multicenter randomized character and its statistical power. So far, this is the study with the largest number of patients included. We further wanted to determine, which independent factors contribute significantly to the variability of the ADR. Therefore we performed multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. Variations of multivariate regression include forward selection and backward elimination methods. We decided to choose backward elimination because all independent factors begin in the model and non-influential variables are eliminated. In our multivariate analysis all included variables remained in the model. We proved the Endocuff, for the first time, to be an independent factor for adenoma detection (OR 2.09). We also found a significantly higher proportion of male patients in whom at least one adenoma was found (OR 1.74). This observation is consistent with previously published data [26]–[28]. An important co-finding was, that ileal intubation rates were similar in both groups with no statistically significant difference.\n\nThe overall procedure time with EC did not differ statistically compared to standard colonoscopy.\n\nStatistical differences were seen in the polyp detection rates for polyps less than 1 cm in diameter and to a lesser extent for those larger than 1 cm. Obviously, even larger polyps can better be detected during EC-assisted colonoscopy in critical anatomical positions. The polyp detection rate in the sigmoid region was notably higher with use of EC. Thus, the benefit of the Endocuff is particularily favourable as the majority of polyps occure in the left hemicolon29.\n\nAccording to the inverse correlation of ADR and interval colon cancer risk (one percent increase of ADR results in three percent reduction of colon cancer risk)13, our observed increase of 14.7% in the ADR does consequently have the potential to reduce the interval colon cancer risk by more than 40%. In our study, for every seven patients screened by EC assisted colonoscopy an additional adenoma could be detected (number needed to screen (NNS = 1/(ADREC−ADRSC)). Assuming a 2 to 5% risk for adenoma to carcinoma progression within the following 10 years, 140 to 350 EC-assisted colonoscopies would be necessary to prevent one colon cancer case. Hence, the use of EC is economically reasonable.\n\nIn our study, no significant adverse effects were detected, besides minor mucosal lacerations without any clinical impact. We have not noticed any Endocuff losses during withdrawal as previously reported by our study group [9]. It is likely that technical advances of the Endocuff with firmer attachment to the tip of the endoscope have prevented this adverse event.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe impact of our findings on colon cancer mortality prevention remains uncertain, thus follow-up studies are necessary.\n\nDue to technical reasons such as the occasional visibility of the rubber arms of the endocuff and the small, but detectable resistence during the endoscopy proceding into the colon, this study was not blinded."
