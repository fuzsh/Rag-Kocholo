        "text": "Historical Significance\n\nBecause the Biblia Sacra is a polyglot and it includes a translation into vernacular German, we know that it is a direct result of the Protestant Reformation and the influence of Martin Luther. Before the Reformation, printing Bibles in vernacular languages created controversy and divisiveness, and – in some cases – was strictly outlawed, as acknowledging the need and desire for laypeople to be able to read and understand scripture themselves (and not rely solely on the clergy to interpret and disseminate scripture) was seen as an attack on the authority of the Church, and, in the case of England, the king (who was said to have received the word of God directly). The first printers/translators of vernacular language Bibles were often hunted down by states and executed. William Tynedale, the publisher of the first Bible translated into English in 1525, was burned at the stake for his project. According to the British Library, even “owning a copy of Tyndale’s New Testament still attracted the death penalty,” which is why Tynedale’s Bibles were small and compact, easily stuffed into a pocket and smuggled from country to country. The size of the Biblia Sacra is then indicative of the changes in the legality and acceptance of vernacular language Bibles that occurred before 1596. In England, Henry VIII legalized English translated Bibles in 1536. In Germany, where the Biblia Sacra was printed, vernacular Bibles had been printed as early as the 15th century. However, these Bibles – especially Martin Luther’s landmark translation – were still received with distrust and divided support, as they were so entrenched in Reformation ideology. Luther was, indeed, excommunicated by the pope in 1521 (Britannica). By 1596, vernacular Bibles were widely available, though they often added fuel to the Reformation movement, which resulted in the Thirty Years’ War that began in 1618 and resulted in the split between between Protestant and Catholic Churches.\n\nPhysical Aspects a.k.a. “Materiality”\n\nInside the covers of the third volume, there are several loose papers. One, a blue index-sized card with what looks to be letters stamped by a typewriter, gives a physical description of the Biblia Sacra. From this, we know that the Bible is a folio, meaning its pages consist of a stack of larger sheets of paper that are folded only once, which makes the pages and, in relation, the entire book, very large (compare this with quartos, octavos, and duodecimos that are folded four, eight, and twelve times, respectively). The covers of the Bible consist of “stamped pigskin over thick oak boards,” which is typical for the time. Renaissance books were extremely expensive. Often, only nobles and other wealthy families could afford them. Thus, books were more like heirlooms or prized possessions, and they needed to be protected with thick and sturdy covers that could withstand the test of time and continuous use.\n\nRenaissance books were made much differently from modern-day “codices.” (Did you know the format of print technology that we usually consider a standard “book” is called a “codex?” Before codices were invented, we relied on scrolls as our primary mode book technology) (Levy & Mole xv). While modern books are printed using laser printers and then glued together using large-scale machinery, Renaissance bookmakers painstakingly sewed each page to thick cords/ropes by hand (a process that took days to complete), cut away the excess paper, and then fastened real wooden boards, which served as the book’s protective cover. These cords are what create the ridges in the spines of old books. Fun fact: some more modern bookmakers create books with ridged spines to mimic the books of old, even though they contain no actual cords. In the images below and to the right, you can see where wear-and-tear has caused the boards and rope to be exposed, offering a cool “inside look” into the way books were made.\n\nSimilarly, woodcuts were stamped or “pressed” onto the page during the printing process, negating the need for hand-painted illustrations and speeding up the book making process. Our Biblia Sacra makes plentiful use of woodcuts, as “Biblical scenes” appear at the beginnings of nearly all different sections, as well as fill up empty space at the ends. Another fun fact is that most woodcuts are not made specifically for individual texts, since they are both time-consuming to make and are relatively expensive. Instead, printers would have a repertoire of generic woodcuts on hand and would insert the most relevant or most closely-matching one into a text, much like how we use stock photos now. If you look closely, some woodcuts in the Biblia Sacra are reused in different sections, which indicates the illustrations are perhaps only loosely correlated with the scenes in the text.\n\nHowever, in the case of our Biblia Sacra, there are a fair amount of non-generic woodcuts as well. The first few pages of each volume are dominated by large and very grand woodcut illustrations that seem specific to our text. Our Grafton & Co. catalog tells us that some of these illustrations — located in the front matter of the first volume — include “two engravings of insignia, of Christian IV of Denmark and the Archbishop of Bremen,” who seem to be the patrons the Bible is dedicated to. The first volume also contains the title page for the Biblia Sacra, as well as a dedication and “Preface to the Good and Benevolent Reader” by Davidis Wolderi/David Wolderus, an “opening” and “argument” by Johannem Brentium, and a “Preface by Martin Luther in the Old Testament” — all written in Latin.\n\nDavid Wolder, or, Davidis Wolderi\n\nWe start with the man who most likely had the largest hand in the compilation and creation of the Bibila Sacra. On the title page, Wolder’s name is printed proudly above Lucius’, prefaced by the word “opera,” which roughly means “the works” (i.e. “the works of”) in Latin. WorldCat – our trusty world wide catalog – credits Wolder as the author of 163 works (although many may simply be slightly different editions or records of the Bibila Sacra). Born in Hamburg, Wolder was a preacher at the St. Petri church as well as, apparently, a publisher of large biblical works on the side. Throughout his book publishing career, Wolder continually found himself in financial trouble, as the production costs of such large and intricate works sometimes outweighed the sales returns. Wolder died in 1604 from the plague, after having nine children.\n\nJacob Lucius Junior\n\nJacob Lucius Junior – also known as “Jacob Lucius the Younger” – is the person who performed the actual printing of the Biblia Sacra. Born in 1570 in Helmstedt, Germany, Lucius learned the printing trade from his father, Jacob Lucius the Elder, whose specialty was creating woodcuts. The British Library has a page dedicated to Jacob Lucius the Elder that showcases these works, and this page can be found here if you are interested in exploring them. Although information on Lucius the Younger is sparse, his name surfaces in a blog post by Liz Broadwell, a cataloger at the University of Pennsylvania, who found a proof of a pamphlet printed at Lucius’ shop. According to Broadwell, “The younger Lucius first plied his trade in Braunschweig in the late 1580s and then in Hamburg in the mid-1590s, where he produced the lavishly illustrated Hamburg Polyglot, a trilingual scholarly Bible (1596). After his father’s death from plague, Lucius returned to Helmstedt to take over the family business in 1598; in 1600 he also succeeded his father as printer to the Academia Julia (later the Universität Helmstedt).” Broadwell also offers interesting information regarding the printing and editing process, highlighting the notations found on Lucius’ proof.\n\nJ. W. Erle a.k.a John Samuel Wanley Sawbridge Erle-Drax\n\nAs we segue into talking about this next name associated with our Biblia Sacra, we begin to enter more uncertain territory. There is no complete paper trail that offers an explanation as to how the Bible made its way from the print shop into the hands of its new owner. Moreover, there is no definite way to know how many owners the Biblia Sacra had. However, we know that book owners would often sign their names on the inside covers of their property. Thus, we have one name to work with: the “J. W. Erle” that is scrawled on every volume of the Bible. As far as we can tell, J. W. Erle may refer to John Samuel Wanley Sawbridge Erle-Drax, an Englishman born in 1800 with a long name and a short biography. Although Erle-Drax was a member of parliament – serving three times between 1841 and 1880 – he was apparently known as the “Silent MP” due to the fact that he never made but one statement while in office, which was only to request that a window be opened.\n\nGrafton & Co. and Frank Hamel\n\nSometime between the living years of J.W. Erle and 1929, we know that the Biblia Sacra made its way into the possession of the Grafton & Co. bookselling company previously located at 51 Great Russell Street in London. The company, located directly across from the British Library, was one of many booksellers along Russell Street and the surrounding area. It sold a wide array of different material, including the books listed above in our catalog sheet, as well as antiquities, classics, and – surprisingly – books on library science. Its owner/proprietor, Frank Hamel, was also an author, as well as an editor for the publication called “The Library World.” Perhaps the most interesting fact to note here is that Hamel was, indeed, a woman (“Frank” was a penname for “Franny”), as well as a South African, who a colleague described as always wearing “a red wig” (Waterfield). In a description underneath the sales listing of archival material from the company (for those who are book history nerds and ephemera collectors), we found that “Hamel’s obituary in her periodical The Library World characterizes her as ‘the remarkable woman, who for about fifty years has owned and edited The Library World, and described herself as author, publisher and antiquarian bookseller.’” This “remarkable woman” – as she is so rightly titled! – amazes us, as we had blindly assumed that Frank Hamel was a man, for in 1929 (the year the Biblia Sacra was sold to two Americans and shipped over seas), women were not typically business owners – let alone women of color.\n\nBernard C. Clausen and L. H. Pennington\n\nNext, we make our way “across the pond” to our buyers in New York – Bernard C. Clausen and L. H. Pennington, who apparently bought the Bible for the New York State College of Forestry in Syracuse. Clausen, whose obituary is printed next to an advertisement for Norge Refrigerators (“IT NEVER FROSTS!”) in a 1960s Binghamton, New York newspaper, was a minister for a Baptist church and authored several books in the religious genre, including “Preach it Again;” The Sermon Test and The Miracle of Me. Pennington was more of an academic; he was a Professor of Forest Botany and later a Pathologist at the state college. In a letter to C. L. Shear, a Pathologist in Washington, D.C., Pennington pleads with Shear to examine a sample of particular fungus that he believes to be associated with a “poplar cancer.” However, Shear has disappointed Pennington before: “I presume, however, that you have been too busy to give [it] your attention.” It seems even the community of botanists has its drama.\n\nThe Gladys E. Kelly Public Library\n\nFinally, we make our way to the Gladys E. Kelly Public Library (formerly, the Chester C. Corbin Public Library) where our Biblia Sacra currently resides. Our collective memory of the Bible only goes back so far. In 2018, when we prepared to move our collection of materials from our temporary location at Webster Town Hall to the brand new library building, our Library Director, Amanda Grenier, found the Biblia Sacra in a ratty cardboard box stored in the back of the town hall’s auditorium stage. There are no records of the Bible’s arrival at either the library or the town hall. However, our blue index card does specify that it was “loaned” by Clausen. To whom, we do not know, and nor do we know when. But we do welcome anyone who wishes to see or study the Biblia Sacra. We are always happy to help!"
