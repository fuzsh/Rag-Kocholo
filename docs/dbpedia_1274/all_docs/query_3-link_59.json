        "text": "Description\n\nThe site of Schöningen is located near the town of Schöningen, district of Helmstedt, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The site was discovered in 1992 during rescue excavations caused by lignite open cast mining. Systematic excavations have been led by the Lower Saxony State Office of Cultural Heritage (NLD) and since 2008, these are carried out in collaboration with the Eberhard Karls University Tübingen and the Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment (SHEP). Mining activities ended in 2016.\n\nThe site has been dated by various methods to ca. 300,000 years before present and was occupied by Pleistocene hunter-gatherers (Homo heidelbergensis or Homo neanderthalensis). During the Pleistocene, the site was located at a lakeside when rapid sedimentation assured the exceptional preservation of organic materials including wooden artefacts, bones, insect remains, and pollen among others. The site of Schöningen has produced the best preserved and oldest hunting weapons in the world as well as an outstanding palaeoenvironmental record, both of which have been the subject of interdisciplinary research for about 30 years. Together with animal bones that are connected to hunting activities, the exceptionally well-preserved hunting weapons offer unique insights into past human hunting behaviour, human cognition, social behaviour and the lifeways of Pleistocene hunter-gatherer societies. The site of Schöningen has fundamentally changed our perception of Pleistocene human species in regards to socio-cultural abilities, human cognition, and technological expertise.\n\nThe exceptional finds from Schöningen and their context are presented in the immediate vicinity of the excavation and the pristine areas of the site in the Research Museum Schöningen (Forschungsmuseum Schöningen; FoMS) that opened in 2013 and annually attracts between 20,000 and 50,000 visitors, especially school groups. The FoMS, which already serves as the information center of the UNESCO Global Geopark Harz - Braunschweiger Land - Ostfalen, the largest geopark in Germany, can immediately take on the role of a World Heritage Center. The finds are the property of the State of Lower Saxony, as is the approximately 650 x 350 m large property on the edge of the opencast mine, in whose deep subsoil the undamaged area of the site is located.\n\nJustification de la Valeur Universelle Exceptionnelle\n\nThe site of Schöningen represents an outstanding testimony of past human culture and creativity 300,000 years before present. Schöningen is the best preserved site of early human history and has produced the oldest, completely preserved hunting weapons known to humankind. The hunting weapons consist of nine spears, two throwing sticks and a lance. They are outstanding testimonies of the early human ability to actively hunt, including their coordinated social interaction and associated planning skills, capacities that previous to Schöningen were only attributed to modern humans. Schöningen thus has made a decisive contribution to a completely new understanding of the technological, cognitive and social abilities of early human species, which has made them more similar to us. Our modern perception of early humans changed fundamentally as a result of the research on the Schöningen hunting weapons. This is known as the Schöningen effect. In addition, the site provides exceptionally preserved evidence of past environments, e.g. in the form of animal bones, pollen, diatoms, eggshells, and insects, as well as, of early human resource exploitation and traditional hunter-gatherer lifeways.\n\nCriterion (ii): The lakeside sediments of Schöningen have produced the oldest and best-preserved evidence of human hunting technologies. These technological achievements were crucial for early humans in order to establish themselves at the top of the food chain making the Schöningen spears as significant for human development as e.g. the invention of the wheel or of fire. Schöningen uniquely allows us to draw conclusions on the cognitive, social and economic abilities that enabled early humans to effectively adapt to challenging environmental conditions such as the northern European lowlands. Only hunting weapons made it possible for early humans to assert themselves in a world in which many animals were physically superior to them, not only including large carnivores such as lions, bears and sabre-toothed cats, but also large herbivores with their dangerous horns, antlers, or hooves.\n\nThe technological ensemble of the hunting weapons from Schöningen was created at a time when Homo heidelbergensis was already established in Europe while Neanderthals and modern humans (Homo sapiens) commenced to develop anatomically around the same time. Neanderthals thrived during several glacials and interglacials in Eurasia, while Homo sapiens dispersed from Africa across Eurasia adapting to a broad range of environments. The spread of effective hunting technologies across human species and population boundaries was key to the successful expansion of different human species during the Pleistocene, which would not have been possible without an exchange of ideas between different groups of people - Schöningen is an outstanding example of this.\n\nThe accelerated brain growth, which can be demonstrated in human evolution since about 2.5 million years ago, increased significantly with Homo heidelbergensis, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo sapiens and is due to food diversification and, in particular, reliable access to animal food resources. Schöningen's hunting weapons are representative of this important milestone in human history reflecting the result of a sustainable transfer of technological knowledge and socially organised hunting behaviour across population boundaries.\n\nThe discovery of the Schöninger spears ended a long-standing research debate that had denied Neanderthals and all other human species before Homo sapiens the ability to actively hunt large game, regarding these human species as pure scavengers. The end of the hunting vs. scavenging debate was a paradigm shift and paved the way for a reinterpretation of the socio-cognitive, linguistic and technological abilities of Pleistocene humans, which could now be seen as more similar to modern humans - the Schöningen effect. Our perception of early humans changed fundamentally as a result of the research on the Schöningen hunting weapons.\n\nCriterion (iii): Schöningen has produced the oldest evidence of complex hunting technologies and hunting behaviour in Pleistocene hunter-gatherer societies. The archaeological evidence shows that Homo heidelbergensis was an effective hunter of the North Eurasian Plain. The technological expertise of crafting efficient hunting weapons and the expertise of socially organised hunting behaviour were sustainably passed on from one generation to the next in the form of knowledge transfer by demonstration, imitation, participation and verbal instruction. This knowledge transfer may have even occurred between human species, from which Homo neanderthalensis and also our species, Homo sapiens, benefitted. Transmission of this traditional knowledge was essential for the survival of early humans during the Ice Age in Eurasia and is comprehensible even today. Furthermore, the purposeful selection of dense, hard conifer tree trunks in order to craft the hunting weapons and the precise craftsmanship are evidence of a long tradition of early woodworking technology. Schöningen can thus be regarded as a unique example of early woodworking traditions.\n\nSchöningen is the best preserved Pleistocene site in the world. While evanescent traces of prehistoric human life have been swept away by glaciers elsewhere, in Schöningen such traces have been protected by up to 15 m thick sediment layers granting exceptional preservation conditions. Humankind lived in mobile hunter-gatherer communities during more than 95% of its history before eventually becoming sedentary through the cultivation of plants and the domestication of animals. The rich botanic and faunal evidence together with the stone, bone and wood artefacts at Schöningen document repetitive patterns of subsistence and socio-economic behaviour some 300,000 years ago in an outstanding manner and in high resolution. This traditional use of natural resources among past hunter-gather societies are highlighted in the large number of studies on animals and plants used in Schöningen, which include not only large mammals, but also botanical evidence. Schöningen also preserves the range of plant resources available to the hominins that could have been exploited for food and medicinal purposes. Schöningen thus offers exceptional evidence of traditional land use by a past human society and has an outstanding value for landscape archaeology. Schöningen represents an extraordinary example of this traditional hunter-gatherer way of life."
