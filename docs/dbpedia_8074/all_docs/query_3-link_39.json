        "text": "On Monday, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, announced their plans to divorce after 27 years of marriage. While we hope for an amicable split for the family, we can't help but wonder exactly what's at stake—real estate wise. We conducted a deep dive into the couple’s real estate portfolio, and it does not disappoint. Given that Bill and Melinda Gates are worth a combined $200 billion—with Bill Gates being the fourth richest person in the world, at the time of writing—we can’t say we’re that surprised to learn that the properties they’ve owned together are worth a pretty penny: approximately $170 million in total. Below, take a look at all ten of these dwellings—including one that’s so impressive, it has its very own Wikipedia page.\n\nA $43 Million Beach House, Del Mar, California\n\nJust last year, Bill and Melinda Gates spent a whopping $43 million on a beach house in Del Mar, making this purchase one of the most expensive real estate sales in this particular part of California. This six-bedroom, four-bathroom dwelling boasts an in-home theater, a private spa, a tennis court, a hot tub that can fit up to 10 people, and a glass-tiled pool—and that doesn't even include the two guesthouses!\n\nA $60 Million Estate in Medina, Washington\n\nThe most expansive and expansive Gates residence is a 66,000 square foot mansion in Medina, Washington, located not too far from Seattle. This abode is so impressive that it has its own Wikipedia page, which mentions that the property taxes for this estate were an estimated $1.063 million in 2009, when the home was worth approximately $147.5 million. It took seven years for this massive structure to be built, which cost a reported $60 million. It’s often referred to as Xanadu 2.0, in reference to the sprawling mansion from Citizen Kane.\n\nA $12.5 Million Mansion, Indian Wells, California\n\nLocated in the Coachella Valley, the Gates’s Indian Wells, California mansion cost them $12.5 million in 1999. This 13,573-square-foot property boasts six bedrooms and 11 bedrooms—and, it’s located just a few minutes from La Quinta Resort & Club, where Tayshia’s season of The Bachelorette was filmed last year.\n\nA $5 Million Villa, Hobe Sound, Florida\n\nIn 2009, Bill and Melinda Gates spent $5 million on a Florida villa that sits on 5.24 acres and boasts nearly 10,000 square feet in total. Not to mention, it comes with a private yacht dock! The affluent couple sold the home just three years later, in 2013, for $5 million.\n\nVarious Properties in Wellington, Florida, Worth $27.2 Million in Total\n\nBill and Melinda Gates have purchased numerous properties in Wellington, Florida, over the years, likely due to the village’s close proximity to the Palm Beach International Equestrian Center, where their eldest child, Jennifer, competes as a show jumper. First, in 2013, the $200 billion couple dropped $8.7 million on their first Wellington abode. In 2016, the Gates’ bought a few more Wellington properties, including a four-bedroom pad, for $13.5 million, and two empty lots, for $5 million.\n\nLove knowing what your favorite HGTV stars are up to? Same. Let’s keep up with them together.\n\nA $18 Million Estate, Rancho Santa Fe, California\n\nMuch like the many Wellington properties the Gateses have owned, their Rancho Santa Fe estate (which includes a horse ranch) was purchased because of its close proximity to a horse race track. The $18 million purchase took place in 2014, with the intention of turning the property into a place where daughter Jennifer could train for her career as an equestrian. This 229-acre estate was once owned by Jenny Craig, the founder of her eponymous nutrition company.\n\nA Multi-Million Dollar Pad at the Yellowstone Club, Big Sky, Montana\n\nThe final property on this list is a pad that’s part of the star-studded Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Montana, a private residential area that has counted fellow famous couples like Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen, and Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel among its members. Although it’s not clear just how much the Gates’s paid for their property, becoming a member at this illustrious club merits a $300,000 initiation fee, and more than $37,000 in annual fees—and that doesn’t include a home within the community, which you have to buy to gain membership. Fortunately, there are 864 households at Yellowstone Club, so there are plenty of properties to choose from, but it will cost you: The starting price for a condo here is $4 million, while a single-family home goes for anywhere from $5 million to $25 million."
