        "text": "Well, that was fast.\n\nBill Gates has accepted an offer less than two weeks after listing a midcentury modern home in Medina, WA.\n\nThe residence, which is just down the street from the Microsoft co-founder’s famed Xanadu mansion, was listed on March 29 for $4,988,800. The sale price has not been released.\n\nGates, who’s worth a reported $131 billion, picked up the property in April 2003 for $1,310,000.\n\nThe current list price breaks down to $2,053 per square foot for the relatively modest 2,430-square-foot home. Homes in the ultradesirable 98039 ZIP code have a median price per square foot of $1,400.\n\nOf the 25 homes currently for sale in this ZIP code, a brand-new mansion just a couple of blocks away is listed for $23 million, or $2,476 per square foot. This means Gates and listing agent Debbie Walter priced his midcentury home just right, as evidenced by the speedy offer.\n\nAs we reported a few days ago, the waterfront home enjoys lovely views of Lake Washington from nearly every room.\n\nThe four-bedroom residence comes with private beach access as well as a Zen garden. Built in 1954, it features the clean lines and abundant windows you’d expect in a classic midcentury home."
