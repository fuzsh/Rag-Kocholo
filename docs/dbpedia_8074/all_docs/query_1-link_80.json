        "text": "William Henry Gates III (born 28 October 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, and humanitarian. He is most famous as the co-founder of Microsoft, and founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Forbes magazine has ranked him as the richest person in the world for twelve consecutive years.\n\nIf something is expensive to develop, and somebody's not going to get paid, it won't get developed. So you decide: Do you want software to be written, or not?\n\nInterview with Dennis Bathory-Kitsz in 80 Microcomputing (1980) Clips from the interview can be found on \"No Money (Lullaby for Bill)\" by Dennis Báthory-Kitsz.\n\nIt's not manufacturers trying to rip anybody off or anything like that. There's nobody getting rich writing software that I know of.\n\nInterview with Dennis Bathory-Kitsz in 80 Microcomputing (1980)\n\nInstead of buying airplanes and playing around like some of our competitors, we've rolled almost everything back into the company.\n\nComment to reporters during the IBM PC launch (1981), interpreted as a jab at Gary Kildall\n\nTo create a new standard, it takes something that's not just a little bit different; it takes something that's really new and really captures people's imagination — and the Macintosh, of all the machines I've ever seen, is the only one that meets that standard.\n\nApple company event (October 1983) [1]\n\nThe next generation of interesting software will be done on the Macintosh, not the IBM PC.\n\nBusinessWeek, 26 November 1984\n\nI believe OS/2 is destined to be the most important operating system, and possibly program, of all time.\n\nOS/2 Programmers Guide, November 1987\n\nThere's only one trick in software, and that is using a piece of software that's already been written.\n\nInterview with Electronics magazine (1989)\n\nI have to say that in 1981, making those decisions, I felt like I was providing enough freedom for 10 years. That is, a move from 64 K to 640 K felt like something that would last a great deal of time. Well, it didn't - it took about only 6 years before people started to see that as a real problem.\n\n1989 speech on the history of the microcomputer industry. [2]\n\nIf people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today.... The solution to this is patent exchanges with large companies and patenting as much as we can.\n\n\"Challenges and Strategy\" (16 May 1991). Note that this quotation has been paired with a misattributed quotation.\n\nI laid out memory so the bottom 640 K was general purpose RAM and the upper 384 I reserved for video and ROM, and things like that. That is why they talk about the 640 K limit. It is actually a limit, not of the software, in any way, shape, or form, it is the limit of the microprocessor. That thing generates addresses, 20-bits addresses, that only can address a megabyte of memory. And, therefore, all the applications are tied to that limit. It was ten times what we had before. But to my surprise, we ran out of that address base for applications within—oh five or six years people were complaining.\n\nBill Gates Interview: Winner of the 1993 Price Waterhouse Leadership Award for Lifetime Achievement, Computerworld Smithsonian Awards. National museum of American history - Smithsonian Institution (1993). Archived from the original on . Retrieved on October 8, 2014.\n\nGary Kildall was one of the original pioneers of the PC revolution. He was a very creative computer scientist who did excellent work. Although we were competitors, I always had tremendous respect for his contributions to the PC industry. His untimely death was very unfortunate and he and his work will be missed.\n\nThe Computer Chronicles. \"Special Edition: Gary Kildall.\" 1995\n\nThere are no significant bugs in our released software that any significant number of users want fixed. ... I'm saying we don't do a new version to fix bugs. We don't. Not enough people would buy it. You can take a hundred people using Microsoft Word. Call them up and say \"Would you buy a new version because of bugs?\" You won't get a single person to say they'd buy a new version because of bugs. We'd never be able to sell a release on that basis.\n\nFocus Magazine No. 43 (23 October 1995)\n\nIn terms of doing things I take a fairly scientific approach to why things happen and how they happen. I don't know if there's a god or not, but I think religious principles are quite valid.\n\nPBS interview with David Frost (November 1995)\n\nWhat we're saying to people is that every idea about ease-of-use, we can develop in software, for the PC, without asking them to buy new hardware, without asking them to throw away their old applications.\n\nBill Gates Charlie Rose Interview on Charlie Rose (25 November 1996)\n\nJust in terms of allocation of time resources, religion is not very efficient. There's a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.\n\n\"In Search of the Real Bill Gates,\" Time (13 January 1997)\n\nAny operating system without a browser is going to be fucking out of business. Should we improve our product, or go out of business?\n\n\"In Search of the Real Bill Gates,\" Time (13 January 1997)\n\nAs soon as I learned about this miracle of chip making I thought, what is the key missing element? ... I'd been working on software so I decided that maybe that was what was necessary to bring all this power to life. I talked about that with a friend, Paul Allen, and we kept saying, \"What can we do? Can we start our own software company?\" It seemed impossible at the time because software was not done by independent companies. The companies that built the computers — IBM and DEC — they did all the software. And when we called them up and said, \"We would like to do an operating system,\" they said, \"who are you?\" to which we said, \"we're high-school students.\" That was s, uh — that was the end of that conversation.\n\nSpeech to the Economic Club of Detroit (1997) [3]\n\nIt's possible, you can never know, that the universe exists only for me. If so, it's sure going well for me, I must admit.\n\nTime magazine Vol. 149, No. 2 (13 January 1997)\n\nWe've done some good work, but all of these products become obsolete so fast... It will be some finite number of years, and I don't know the number — before our doom comes.\n\nForbes Greatest Business Stories of All Time (1997) by Daniel Gross ISBN 0471196533\n\nOne thing we have got to change in our strategy - allowing Office documents to be rendered very well by other peoples browsers is one of the most destructive things we could do to the company. We have to stop putting any effort into this and make sure that Office documents very well depends on PROPRIETARY IE capabilities.\n\n1998 a memo to the Office product group[4]\n\nAlthough about 3 million computers get sold every year in China, but people don't pay for the software. Someday they will, though. As long as they are going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They'll get sort of addicted, and then we'll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.\n\nSpeech at the University of Washington, as reported in \"Gates, Buffett a bit bearish\" CNET News (2 July 1998)\n\nSometimes we do get taken by surprise. For example, when the Internet came along, we had it as a fifth or sixth priority. It wasn't like somebody told me about it and I said, \"I don't know how to spell that.\" I said, \"Yeah, I've got that on my list, so I'm okay.\" But there came a point when we realized it was happening faster and was a much deeper phenomenon than had been recognized in our strategy.\n\nSpeech at the University of Washington, as reported in \"Gates, Buffett a bit bearish\" CNET News (2 July 1998)\n\nYour most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.\n\nBusiness @ The Speed of Thought (1999)\n\nMicrosoft has had clear competitors in the past. It's a good thing we have museums to document that.\n\nSpeech at the Computer History Museum, as quoted in InfoWorld magazine (October 2001)\n\nWe don't have the user centricity. Until we understand context, which is way beyond presence — presence is the most trivial notion, just am I on this device or not; it doesn't say am I meeting with something, am I focused on writing something.\n\n.NET Briefing Day Speech (24 July 2002)\n\nLike almost everyone who uses e-mail, I receive a ton of spam every day. Much of it offers to help me get out of debt or get rich quick. It would be funny if it weren't so irritating.\n\n\"Why I Hate Spam\" in Microsoft PressPass (2003)\n\nSpam will be a thing of the past in two years' time.\n\nBBC News (24 January 2004)\n\nDoes the e-mail say it's about 'enlargement' — that might be spam.\n\nBBC News (24 January 2004)\n\nPersonal computing today is a rich ecosystem encompassing massive PC-based data centers, notebook and Tablet PCs, handheld devices, and smart cell phones.

Steve Jobs Couldn't Care Less.\" CBS MoneyWatch (11 February 2010)\n\nJust giving people devices has a really horrible track record. You really have to change the curriculum and the teacher. And it's never going to work on a device where you don't have a keyboard-type input. Students aren't there just to read things. They're actually supposed to be able to write and communicate. And so it's going to be more in the PC realm—it's going to be a low-cost PC that lets them be highly interactive.\n\nA Conversation With Bill Gates About the Future of Higher Education in The Chronicle of Higher Education (25 June 2012)\n\nWhen I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war. That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water. When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel. Today, the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead, it looks like this. If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles, but microbes.\n\n\"The next outbreak?

And then if they test positive, to have that enforced quarantine.\n\nWe actually seeded a lot of infection by saying, 'Okay, everybody, residents and citizens come back (and not testing or quarantining).'\n\nAs quoted in \"Coronavirus: Bill Gates describes what we did wrong, and how to do better\" by Lisa M.

If you free up human labor, you can help elder people better, have smaller class sizes – you know, the demand for labor to do good things is still there. And then if you ever get beyond that, you have a lot of leisure time and you’ll have to figure out what to do with it.\n\nBill Gates teases the possibility of a 3-day work week where ‘machines can make all the food and stuff’ (November 23, 2023)\n\n\"So the idea of being able to explain something in a succinct form is such a cool thing, and it requires you to know a field so well.\"\n\n\"Bill Gates Returns\", on Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard, found on DeepCast (14 March 2024)\n\nSuzanne Lammers, Programmers at Work: Interviews With 19 Programmers Who Shaped the Computer Industry, Harper and Row, ISBN 0-914-84571-3. Text here.\n\nThe best way to prepare [to be a programmer] is to write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written. In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and fished out listings of their operating system.\n\nYou've got to be willing to read other people's code, and then write your own, then have other people review your code. You've got to want to be in this incredible feedback loop where you get the world-class people to tell you what you're doing wrong...\n\nThe finest pieces of software are those where one individual has a complete sense of exactly how the program works. To have that, you have to really love the program and concentrate on keeping it simple, to an incredible degree.\n\nWe're no longer in the days where everything is super well crafted. But at the heart of the programs that make it to the top, you'll find that the key internal code was done by a few people who really know what they were doing.\n\nUnfortunately, many programs are so big that there is no one individual who really knows all the pieces, and so the amount of code sharing you get isn't as great. Also, the opportunity to go back and really rewrite something isn't quite as great, because there's always a new set of features that you're adding on to the same program.\n\nThe worst programs are the ones where the programmers doing the original work don't lay a solid foundation, and then they're not involved in the program in the future.\n\nPrograms today get very fat; the enhancements tend to slow the programs down because people put in special checks. When they want to add some feature, they'll just stick in these checks without thinking how they might slow the thing down.\n\nBefore Paul and I started the company, we had been involved in some large-scale software projects that were real disasters. They just kept pouring people in, and nobody knew how they were going to stabilize the project. We swore to ourselves that we would do better.\n\nSuccess is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.\n\nThe obvious mathematical breakthrough would be development of an easy way to factor large prime numbers.\n\np. 265 in hardcover edition, corrected in paperback\n\nOne of the wonderful things about the information highway is that virtual equity is far easier to achieve than real-world equity...We are all created equal in the virtual world and we can use this equality to help address some of the sociological problems that society has yet to solve in the physical world,\"\n\nThis leads to the paradox, that because the disease is only in the poor countries, there is not much investment. For example, there is more money put into baldness drugs, than are put into malaria. Now, baldness, it is a terrible thing [audience laughter] and rich men are afflicted, so that is why that priority is set.\n\nVideo may be viewed here.\n\nThe harsh mathematics of polio makes it clear: We cannot maintain a level of one thousand or two thousand cases a year. Either we eradicate polio, or we return to the days of tens of thousands of cases per year. That is no alternative at all. We don't let children die because it is fatiguing to save them. Our commitment as a foundation is to work with partners until no children die from polio.\n\n\"Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Our Role in the Polio Eradication Initiative\" Medizinische Universität Wien (12 December 2009)\n\nThe success of the Nigeria programme hinges on the active participation of everyone to make sure that all children are reached by National Immunization Days (NIDs), Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) and the routine immunization programme, if the country capitalizes on the commitments I've heard in the past two days, Nigeria can lead the way to a polio-free Africa.\n\n\"Bill Gates visits Nigeria\" polioeradication.org (04 February 2009)\n\nWe are in the end game, I'm optimistic that we will be successful.

We see her a few times a year. Aunt Myra worked for many years taking reservations for Delta Airlines. She lived in New Orleans until Hurricane Katrina, and then she moved to Dallas, Melinda's hometown. She loves to see our kids. When we all get together, she'll sit down on the floor and play games with them. Aunt Myra also has polio. She's in braces, and she has been ever since she was a little girl. Our children only know what polio is because of their aunt. Otherwise, the disease would just be another historical fact they learn about in school. In fact, even though I was born just three years after one of the worst polio epidemics in American history, I didn't know anyone with polio when I was growing up. That's how far we've come.\n\n\"Bill Gates - Rotary International\" Bill & Melinda Gates foundation (21 January 2009)\n\nIn the last 20 years, thanks to your hard work, polio has declined by 99 percent. In 1988, 350,000 people got polio. By 2008, the number was down to just a couple of thousand.\n\n\"Bill Gates - Rotary International\" Bill & Melinda Gates foundation (21 January 2009)\n\nFirst we've got population. Now, the world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that (forecast) by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent, but there we see an increase of about 1.3 (per year).\n\n(Full speech on the official website of the TED Conference)\n\nLet's burn the 99%.\n\n(Referring to Nuclear Fusion involving commonly available elements as opposed to Nuclear Fission with rare Uranium)\n\nHe [Steve Jobs] showed me the boat he was working on ... and talked about how he's looking forward to being on it, even though we both knew there was a good chance that wouldn't happen.\n\ncbsnews.com\n\nThe moral systems of religion, I think, are superimportant. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.\n\nResponse when he was asked whether he believed in God, at his interview with Rolling Stone magazine. March 27, 2014.\n\nI agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them.\n\nNow science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\n\nResponse when he was asked whether he believed in God, at his interview with Rolling Stone magazine.

And we need to create and roll out breakthrough technologies that can take us the rest of the way.\n\nFrom \"Introduction: 51 Billion to Zero,\" page 8\n\nWhen it comes to climate change, I know innovation isn’t the only thing we need. But we cannot keep the earth livable without it. Techno-fixes are not sufficient, but they are necessary.\n\nFrom \"Introduction: 51 Billion to Zero,\" page 14\n\nDeploying today’s renewables and improving transmission couldn’t be more important. . . . Unless we use large amounts of nuclear energy . . . every path to zero in the United States will require us to install as much wind and solar power as we can build and find room for. . . . [M]ost countries aren’t as lucky as the United States when it comes to solar and wind resources. . . . That’s why, even as we deploy, deploy, deploy solar and wind, the world is going to need some new clean electricity inventions too.\n\nFrom \"Chapter 4: How We Plug In,\" pages 83 and 84\n\n[W]ith transportation, the zero-carbon future is basically this: Use electricity to run all the vehicles we can, and get cheap alternative fuels for the rest. In the first group are passenger cars and trucks, light and medium trucks, and buses. In the second group are long-distance trucks, trains, airplanes, and container ships.\n\nFrom \"Chapter 7: How We Get Around,\" page 147\n\nTo get [the breakthroughs on the \"Technologies needed\" list] ready soon enough to make a difference, governments need to . . . [q]uintuple clean energy and climate-related R&D over the next decade. . . .\n\nFrom \"Chapter 11: A Plan for Getting to Zero,\" page 200\n\nIt helps to set ambitious goals and commit to meeting them, the way countries around the world did with the 2015 Paris Agreement. It’s easy to mock international agreements, but they’re part of how progress happens: If you like having an ozone layer, you can thank an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol.\n\nFrom \"Chapter 11: A Plan for Getting to Zero,\" page 215\n\nAs a Citizen . . . Make calls, write letters, attend town halls. . . . [M]ake clear that this is an issue that will help determine how you vote. . . . Look locally as well as nationally. . . . Run for office.\n\nFrom \"Chapter 12: What Each of Us Can Do,\" pages 218 to 220\n\nAs a Consumer . . . Sign up for a green pricing program with your electric utility. . . . Reduce your home's emissions. . . . Buy an electric vehicle. . . . Try a plant-based burger.\n\nFrom \"Chapter 12: What Each of Us Can Do,\" pages 220 to 222\n\nWe should spend the next decade focusing on the technologies, [governmental] policies and market structures that will put us on the path to eliminating greenhouse gases by 2050. It's hard to think of a better response to a miserable [year of COVID-19 disruptions during] 2020 than spending the next ten years dedicating ourselves to this ambitious goal.\n\nFrom \"Afterword: Climate Change and COVID-19,\" page 230\n\nI see little commercial potential for the internet for the next 10 years.\n\nRemarks at COMDEX (November 1994), attributed in Kommunikation erstatter transport (2009) by Karl Krarup et al.\n\nIntellectual property has the shelf life of a banana.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (December 29, 2011).\n\nThe idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armour to lead all customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly ignores the fact that it was he who, by peddling second-rate technology, led them into it in the first place.\n\nDouglas Adams\n\nGates is the ultimate programming machine. He believes everything can be defined, examined, reduced to essentials, and rearranged into a logical sequence that will achieve a particular goal.\n\nStewart Alsop\n\nBill Gates is a very rich man today ... and do you want to know why? The answer is one word: versions.\n\nDave Barry\n\nIt's a business I don't know anything about, but I admire Bill Gates enormously. I know him individually, and I think he's incredible in business.\n\nWarren Buffett, in lecture at Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. (1994); Warren Buffett Talks Business VHS (1995) by The University of North Carolina Center for Public Television.\n\nThere never was a chip, it is said, that Bill Gates couldn't slow down with a new batch of features.\n\nJames Coates, The Chicago Tribune\n\nWell, it seems to me that he did have an education to get there. It happened to be mine, not his.\n\nGary Kildall on the selection of Gates to give the keynote at the anniversary of the University of Washington computer science program. This perceived insult prompted Kildall to write his memoir. \"The Man Who Could Have Been Bill Gates\" in Business Week (24 October 2004)\n\nHe is divisive. He is manipulative. He is a user. He has taken much from me and the industry.\n\nGary Kildall, in notes for an unpublished memoir Computer Connections.\n\nProbably the most dangerous and powerful industrialist of our age.\n\nScott McNealy, of Sun Microsystems\n\nBill Gates is a monocle and a Persian cat away from being the villain in a James Bond movie.\n\nDennis Miller, \"I Rant Therefore I Am,\" 2001\n\nThere is nothing nice about Steve Jobs and nothing evil about Bill Gates. Gates is a good man.\n\nChuck Peddle, CES 2006, Las Vegas The Legendary Chuck Peddle, Inventor of The Personal Computer\n\n[Gates] apparently has made more money than anyone else his age, ever, in any business.\n\nBrian O'Reilly, Fortune magazine, (12 October 1987)\n\nWhat J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller were to the Age of Robber Barons, Microsoft's Bill Gates and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett, as well as digital moguls like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos are to the contemporary age of the rule of the 1%. Then as now, the super-rich used governments to write laws and rules to allow them to accumulate unlimited wealth; then as now, creating monopolies by enclosing the commons and killing competition is the strategy for becoming the 1%.\n\nVandana Shiva Oneness vs. the 1%: Shattering Illusions, Seeding Freedom (2018)\n\nIn May 2020, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York announced a partnership with the Gates Foundation to 'reinvent education.' Cuomo called Gates a visionary and argued that the pandemic has created 'a moment in history when we can actually incorporate and advance [Gates'] ideas...all these buildings, all these physical classrooms-why with all the technology you have?' In fact, Gates has been trying to dismantle the public education system of the United States for two decades.\n\nVandana Shiva Oneness vs. the 1%: Shattering Illusions, Seeding Freedom (2018)\n\nIn an interview with The Economist last month, Bill Gates stated that millions of people in developing countries would die before the COVID-19 pandemic was over. He noted, importantly, that 90 percent of the deaths would not result from the virus itself, but from \"indirect\" effects. These include most prominently the economic impact of the pandemic, as well as other causes such as the overwhelming of medical and public health resources, which increases fatalities from other diseases. Gates was not exaggerating at all. It's easy to see how this horror will materialize, if we project forward from the current situation. The World Food Program projects that the number of people facing acute hunger will nearly double this year, from 135 to 260 million.\n\nMark Weisbrot, If you could save a million lives, would you do it?, The Hill (1 October 2020)\n\nBill Gates [in his] new book, \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster\" [asserts that if] humanity is to win the great race between development and degradation . . . green innovation must accelerate. . . . [G]iven the pressing need to decarbonise the global economy, says Mr Gates, \"we have to force an unnaturally speedy transition\" [to carbon-free energy, and the] linchpin of his argument is the introduction of a meaningful carbon price to account for the externalities involved in using dirty energy. . . . Ultimately his book is a primer on how to reorganise the global economy so that innovation focuses on the world’s gravest problems. It is a powerful reminder that if mankind is to get serious about tackling them, it must do more to harness the one natural resource available in infinite quantity — human ingenuity.\n\nThe Economist (to cause the newspaper to speak with one voice, The Economist does not list author bylines for individual articles), from \"Bill Gates has a plan to save the world: Tackling climate change, he says, requires governments and business to work together.\" (February 18, 2021)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikinews has news related to this article:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:"
