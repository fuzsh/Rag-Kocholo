        "text": "Bill Gates reportedly now has one fewer home.\n\nThat became the case earlier this month after the Microsoft co-founder reached a deal to sell a 2,430-square-foot house he owned in Medina, Washington, according to Realtor.com.\n\nHow much the property ultimately went for is unknown. It was originally put up for sale on March 29 with an asking price of nearly $4.989 million, per the outlet.\n\nNANTUCKET BEACHFRONT HOME SELLS FOR AN ABSURDLY LOW PRICE, BUT THERE'S A CATCH\n\nGates worked with RE/MAX Northwest to sell the house, Fortune reported. RE/MAX’s listing showed a \"pending\" status for the \"mid-century modern\" home.\n\nFOX Business reached out for Gates’ comment.\n\nThe property boasts \"spectacular & awe-inspiring 180-degree Lake Washington, Seattle skyline & Olympic mtn views,\" the listing said.\n\nIt sits on a 0.61-acre lot. It also comes with a large deck and zen garden.\n\nBILL GATES IS A BIG FAN OF PICKLEBALL\n\nThe house itself contains four bedrooms and three full bathrooms, according to the listing. It has been equipped with radiant heated floors, too.\n\nThe other home Gates owns in Medina remains under his ownership, Realtor.com. It has been referred to as \"Xanadu 2.0.\"\n\nThe tech billionaire invested tens of millions of dollars into building that 66,000-square-foot house, FOX Business previously reported.\n\nMedina is located in King County, where Microsoft has long had its headquarters.\n\nKITTY LITTER HEIRESS LISTS CALIFORNIA ESTATE FOR $88M\n\nGates spent 15 years as the CEO of Microsoft, with his tenure ending in 2000. He exited the tech giant’s board in 2020 to \"dedicate more time to his philanthropic priorities including global health, development, education, and his increasing engagement in tackling climate change,\" Microsoft said at the time.\n\nThe tech billionaire still owns roughly 1% of Microsoft shares, according to Bloomberg."
