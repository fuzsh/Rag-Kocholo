        "text": "William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) was an American business magnate, software developer and politician who served as both the 47th & 49th President of the United States from 2025 to 2029 and 2033 to 2037. Before beginning his political career he was a co-founder of both the Microsoft Corporation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nBill Gates 47th and 49th President of the United States\n\nIn office: January 20, 2025-January 20, 2029 & January 20, 2033-January 20, 2037\n\nVice President: Roy Cooper (2025-2029), Kyrsten Sinema (2033-2037)\n\nUnited States Senator from Washington\n\nIn office: 2023-2025\n\nBorn\n\nWilliam Henry Gates III\n\nOctober 28, 1955\n\nSeattle, Washington, U.S.\n\nPolitical Party\n\nDemocratic\n\nEducation\n\nHarvard University (dropped out)\n\nOccupation\n\nPolitician, entrepreneur, software developer, investor\n\n2022 U.S. Senate Campaign[]\n\nIn November 2021, Bill Gates announced his campaign for a seat in the United States senate, representing the state of Washington. Gates announced that he would be running as an independent. Despite this, polls showed that Gates enjoyed a large amount of popular support from the very beginning of his campaign, and with his vast personal wealth, Gates was able to run a very successful campaign in the state, ultimately winning the seat with 43% of the vote. His Republican and Democratic opponents won 32% and 25% of the popular vote respectively.\n\nU.S. Senate (2023-2025)[]\n\nWhile himself being an independent senator, Gates voted mostly with the Democratic Party during his time in the senate.\n\n2024 Presidential Campaign[]\n\nFollowing President Joe Biden’s announcement in late 2023 that he would not be running for President in 2024, a number of prominent Democrats began announcing their own bids for the Democratic parties nomination for the office of President, hoping to replace the unpopular Vice President Ashton Carter. Following speculation about his own candidacy, Gates announced in December 2023 that he would be seeking the nomination of the Democratic Party. Gates made a strong showing in the primary debates and it quickly became clear that he would be the one to challenge Carter for the nomination. Gates received a boost in support in January 2024 after being endorsed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, consolidating the progressive support around Gates.\n\nFirst Presidency (2025-2029)[]\n\nBill Gates was sworn in as the 47th President of the United States at noon on January 20, 2025, with North Carolina governor Roy Cooper as his Vice President. In his inaugural address he spoke of the need for change in American politics, speaking of the need for effectiveness and compassion in government. He also claimed that his position as a relatively new politician gave him the opportunity to make both of those changes a reality. One of Gates’ first acts as President was to create the United States Department of Technology and Innovation, something he had strongly argued the need for on the campaign trail, and appointed Aneesh Chopra as America’s first Secretary of Technology and Innovation.\n\nGates pledged to reform America's foreign policy, and did so in multiple ways. One of the first things he did was increasing the amount America spent on foreign policy, with a major beneficiary of this being ten newly established Free Iranian Republic.\n\nAs president, Gates also revolutionised healthcare in America, establishing the single payer healthcare program “AmeriCare” in February 2026. This was hailed as a hallmark achievement of his administration.\n\nGates received the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize following his intervention in the Colombian-Panamanian War, which he was able to end in just 3 weeks.\n\n2028 Presidential Campaign[]\n\nIn mid-2026 Gates began expressing frustration with other Democratic Party leaders, citing a reluctance he felt many had in fighting for major progressive policies due to, he claimed, fear of political repercussions. His criticisms became more and more common and fierce following the 2026 midterm elections which increased the Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. In 2027, during the lead up to the primary season for the 2028 Presidential election, Gates was seen meeting with a number of Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Micheal Bennet, Governor Phil Murphy, Governor Bill de Blasio and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cotrez, a group that he referred to as “true progressives” in a social media post in June 2027. This then led to Gates' announcement in November 2027 that due to \"the Democratic Party establishment's continued refusal to fight for real, meaningful change that could immeasurably improve the life of millions of Americans\" he would not be running for the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2028 Presidential election, instead establishing his own brand new party the \"True Progressive Party\". Along with him went a number of prominent Democrats including all of the 5 “true progressives” mentioned above although not his own Vice President, Roy Cooper.\n\n2032 Presidential Campaign[]\n\nBill Gates continued to campaign for True Progressive candidates during Kim Reynolds' presidency, including Bill De Blasio's gubernatorial race and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Senate race. As Reynolds' approval rating plummeted during her term, the popularity of both the True Progressive and Democratic parties grew greatly, and following the deaths of Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar and True Progressive senator Micheal Bennet in the R street hostage crisis, it was agreed by most high-ranking members of both parties, and the DNC and TPNC to hold a joint primary for the 2032 presidential election, with the agreement being that whoever won would select a running mate from the other party. Bill Gates won 51% of the vote in the primary, defeating Democrat Kyrsten Sinema after most other prominent Democrats dropped out of the primary fairly early. However, all was not lost for Sinema as Gates would choose her as his running mate in the 2032 election.\n\nSecond Presidency (2033-2037)[]\n\nBill Gates was sworn in as the 49th President of the United States at noon on January 20, 2033, with Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema as his Vice President. This made him the first person since Grover Cleveland, and the second person in history, to serve two non-consecutive terms as President of the United States. Gates' first objective in his second term as President was to end the Second Korean War on good terms for America. In the days following his inauguration Gates worked with leaders of both sides of the war including the People's Republic of China, Japan and South Korea. In the end Gates' work culminated in the Treaty of Pyongyang, signed on the 14th of June 2033. For this, Bill Gates would receive a Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the first individual to win two of this prestigious award. It was after this that Gates saw his highest ever approval rating: 91.2%.\n\nPost-Presidency[]\n\nGates remained a very popular figure after his presidency."
