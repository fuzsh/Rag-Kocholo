        "text": "Xanadu 2.0, Medina, Washington\n\nKnown as Xanadu 2.0 — a name inspired by \"Citizen Kane\" — Gates' home base is Medina, Washington, a wealthy suburb of Seattle that's home to many tech titans. Gates owns at least 12 parcels of land there, totaling about 10.5 acres.\n\nPurchased for about $34 million between 1988 and 2009, the current combined assessed value of the Lake Washington-adjacent properties is $183.5 million.\n\nBuilt into a hillside and accessible via a driveway that feels \"like arriving at Jurassic Park,\" according to a former Microsoft intern, the estate, which took a reported seven years and $60 million to build, is home to a 2,100-square-foot library (with one of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks on the shelves), a 60-foot-long swimming pool with an underwater sound system, and a room with a built-in trampoline. The primary residence has seven bedrooms and 18.75 baths, according to public filings, and there's reportedly a 20-car garage for his Porsche collection.\n\nIt was also built to be energy-efficient and technologically advanced, with a heating and cooling system that automatically adjusts to guests' liking and lights that turn on and off automatically as people go from room to room.\n\n\"My house is being designed and constructed so that it's a bit ahead of its time,\" Gates wrote in his 1995 book \"The Road Ahead.\" It is made of wood, stone, glass, concrete, and \"silicon and software.\"\n\n\"I'll warn you, though,\" he added. \"When I describe the plans, people sometimes give me a look that says, 'You're sure you really want to do this?\"\n\nOne of those people could have been his then-wife, Melinda French Gates, whom he married after he had already begun work on the house. While she changed his plans for the kitchen and added her own office space, she may have never warmed up to the house.\n\n\"We won't have that house forever,\" she told The New York Times in 2019. \"I'm actually really looking forward to the day that Bill and I live in a 1,500-square-foot house.\"\n\nYellowstone Club lodge, Montana\n\nBill Gates has long been reported to be a member of the exclusive Yellowstone Club — a ski and golf club tucked away in Big Sky Montana.\n\nMontana is a nondisclosure state when it comes to real estate, and the Yellowstone Club is very private in what it releases about its owners, but a 2009 county resolution helped point to which home belonged to the Gates.\n\nThe lot, which sits on 2.76 acres, has the same tax address as Gates' many other properties and was linked to his lawyer and family office. Its assessed market value is $29.4 million — up from $5.8 million in the 2009 county record.\n\nThere are no photos available of the home online, but property records indicate the main house is 6,993 square feet, with eight full baths, eight bedrooms, two half baths, a sauna, and a home theater. It's almost guaranteed to match the surrounding homes, which heavily feature timber and stone.\n\nThe house sits in the Andesite Ridge neighborhood, which is described as \"a tree-topped hillside where luxury homes wind along the mountain offering a secluded alpine sanctuary\" on the club's website. Its homes are largely ski-in, ski-out.\n\nThe club's annual dues were $41,500 in 2018, the most recent year for which data are publicly available, plus another $12,000 for the property owners' association. That buys access to the club's 15,200 acres, more than 100 ski trails, 18-hole golf course, and spa.\n\nThe home switched hands in 2021 — the same year Bill and Melinda divorced. A trust connected to a Seattle bank used by both of the Gates is the property's new owner, and it was never listed for sale. All signs point to one of the two still owning it."
