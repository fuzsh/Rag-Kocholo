Mark Gordon and TerraPower LLC, one of the richest men in the world headed over to a local fossil store to play a private game of Texas hold ’em poker with a few “regular people.”\n\n“To have someone of his stature sit down with local people and talk with us shows that he really cares about us,” said Robert Bowen, co-owner of Wyoming Fossils along Pine Avenue in Kemmerer. “We’re honored he considered to be part of our community, and sit down with us. He’s a very down-to-earth man.”\n\nBut before he played poker Monday afternoon, Gates attended a groundbreaking ceremony under a huge marquee tent set up in the rolling plateaus of sagebrush in Wyoming’s southern Red Desert to tout a novel Natrium nuclear reactor project.\n\nGates said that TerraPower’s work has been a dream since 2005.\n\n“It’s important for the future of this country that projects like this succeed,” said Gates, TerraPower founder. “This is a big step toward safe, abundant, zero-carbon energy.”\n\nHe said other reactors are on the drawing board.\n\n“We are thrilled that Kemmerer and Diamondville have stepped up to be such great partners,” Gates said. “I believe this project will keep Kemmerer prosperous for decades to come, and that’s because we’re not just going to build one plant, but we’re going to build lots of these things.\n\n“I can’t wait to be here when we turn the reactor on.”\n\nIn his remarks before 300 people at the ceremony, Gordon said that he was encouraged about Natrium’s contribution to the community with jobs.\n\n“What worries me for Wyoming is when you talk about different sorts of energy supply, what are the ones that are going to keep communities alive?” Gordon said. “What are the ones that demonstrate a commitment to the community?”\n\nHe said Natrium will “make a difference.”\n\nCoal’s Future\n\nThe reactor project is coming at a tough time for the energy-rich Power River Basin in northeastern Wyoming that has come under fire by the federal government to phase out coal-fired power plants and terminate coal mining on public lands by 2041.\n\nThere were a few protestors outside of the Highway 189 area Monday where TerraPower is to build its new reactor in the flats, as locals call it, with some holding signs supportive of Wyoming’s coal future.\n\nThe new nuclear reactor is only a few miles south of the Kemmerer Operations that mines coal for the nearby Naughton power plant, which is looking to convert the last two of three units to natural gas by 2026.\n\nPacifiCorp has already announced plans to retire the nearly 60-year-old plant in 2036.\n\nMost everyone in town seems to consider the nuclear reactor that TerraPower is building as a beacon of hope for the tiny community of 2,400 people. The community is facing growing pains from a lack of housing for the nearly 1,600 workers coming to town to build the plant, plus permanent housing needed for long-term projects to be located near Naughton and the TerraPower project.\n\nFading West, a modular home builder based in Buena Vista, Colorado, has stated that it plans to ship modular homes to the area to help close the supply and demand gap.\n\nBut Monday was all about the spotlight on Gates and the army of 1,000 engineers who have been dedicated to making the Natrium project a reality.\n\nThe Natrium reactor is to become the first advanced nuclear reactor project outside of Russia and China to move from design to construction.\n\nRed, White And Blue\n\n“This is a totally red, white and blue project,” TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque told Cowboy State Daily.\n\n“People should care about what’s going on today because energy security is a big deal,” he said. “With our design, we have a totally American-made technology, and we’re going to source our fuel from free world countries like the U.S. and United Kingdom,” he said.\n\nThe last commercial reactors to get approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission came in 2012.\n\nThat’s when the NRC issued licenses for two nuclear reactors in Georgia, Vogtle 3 and 4. Those reactors are water-cooled and similar in design to today’s operating fleet of 94 reactors.\n\nThe Vogtle 3 reactor went into operation last year while Vogtle 4 began generating power for the electrical grid in April.\n\nA water-cooled reactor uses purified water to cool the core of a reactor and to partially moderate the fuel’s chain reaction when the reactor runs.\n\nFor decades, there have been very few new commercial reactors come online in the United States, but the concept of building small reactors seems to be catching on, especially in Wyoming where there’s serious discussions taking place to build an infrastructure to assemble the plants in the state.\n\nRadiant Industries Inc., a nuclear technologies business, recently stated that it selected Wyoming as one of five finalists to locate a factory to build portable micro-nuclear power plants that can power anything from mining and drilling operations to military equipment or large subdivisions of homes.\n\nGillette-based L&H Industrial said recently that Cheyenne and Laramie are on a short list to become the corporate headquarters and spot to build a factory to assemble components for an emerging micro-nuclear reactor business.\n\nLong Road Ahead\n\nTerraPower’s reactor would serve as a demonstration project but become a full-scale commercial plant upon completion.\n\nThe NRC began an intense review of the reactor’s technical design after TerraPower submitted the 3,700-page application to build the facility at the end of March.\n\nNRC staff recently determined that the application was complete enough for a full technical review.\n\nIn the next step, the NRC will begin its technical work and give TerraPower an estimated schedule for reaching a decision on the permit.\n\nThe regulatory agency’s generic goal for completing the technical review is three years.\n\nAs to construction, the NRC's authority extends to structures, systems and components necessary for nuclear safety. The permit, if issued, requires TerraPower to build its proposed nuclear reactor to the specifications submitted to the NRC.\n\nOther activities, such as site grading, fencing, road work or buildings and structures not related to nuclear safety can be done at TerraPower's own risk, the NRC previously stated.\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony on Monday was the first evidence of the project getting underway.\n\nOver the weekend, Kemmerer businesses began seeing a pickup in traffic for the event.\n\nFor Sunday and Monday, TerraPower rented out the entire 80-room Best Western Fossil Plus Fossil Country Inn & Suites, considered the swankiest in Kemmerer, near the western edge of town.\n\nThe recently opened Fossil Fuel coffee shop in town provided brew for the event.\n\nThere’s been a steady stream of contractors to town not just for the TerraPower project, but also other big construction projects underway.\n\nThe Union Pacific railroad has stored equipment in an adjacent parking lot to the Best Western while the continued expansion of ExxonMobil’s carbon capture facility at its Shute Creek Treating Facility in La Barge, Wyoming, has brought many workers to town for overnight stays at local motels.\n\n“About half our motel is filled with Union Pacific workers and the rest by ExxonMobil,” said Seth Snyder, a manager of Fossil Butte Motel in downtown Kemmerer.\n\nTexas Hold ’Em\n\nBut the big-ticket highlight in town was the Texas hold 'em game that Gates secretly escaped away from.\n\nHe played at Wyoming Fossils, in the upper backroom of one of the biggest fossil enclaves for collectors of fossils and rocks in the state.\n\nGates and others were asked to pitch in a $30 buy-in fee to get a seat at the table.\n\n“He’s a regular guy and we just wanted to play cards with him,” Bowen said.\n\nTo the north of town, Highway 30 was picking up for another reason as travelers were taking the road as an alternate after a major thoroughfare to the Yellowstone National Park from Idaho had washed out.\n\nMatt Wright, the proprietor of the Kettle restaurant along the route, is already familiar with the circus-like crowd that follows Gates when he’s in town.\n\nIn May 2023, when Gates last visited, he stopped by his diner one evening, waiting to be seated. After a five-minute wait, he ordered a cheeseburger.\n\nThe visit turned out to be prescient for Wright, who has since gotten legal permission from TerraPower’s lawyers to use the name of the “Natrium” trademark for several alcoholic mixed beverages on his menu.\n\nAmong a half-dozen Natrium-related drinks are nuclear-sounding cocktails like “Natrium Reactor Water,“ “Critical Pile” and “Molten Sodium Slushie.”\n\nOn Monday, Wright normally closes his eatery. But a group of 30 TerraPower engineers called in to have a celebration of sorts in a side area of his restaurant.\n\nThey already placed a big order of hamburgers, hot dogs, baked beans and macaroni salad.\n\nWright said he is personally grinding up Black Angus beef for the special event on his day off.\n\nHe also runs a small recreational vehicle park in the rear of the Kettle that is packed. He has about a half-dozen RVs from employees of Earth Work Solutions in Gillette who have rented spots.\n\nThat earth grading company began a $10 million contract to begin excavation work on the Natrium plant on May 20.\n\n“I know they’re staying a while because some company from Evanston dropped off 125-pound propane tanks in front of them,” Wright said."
