Hint, It's Not Bill Gates\n\nWhile that is a ton of land to own, Gates owns a lot more than that.\n\nBefore we get into the billionaire’s “secret” holdings, new companies focusing on the retail investor have innovated ways for them to gain exposure to the property market, too. Here’s how to invest as little as $100 (or more, depending on your appetite) in a property to earn passive income and build long-term wealth.\n\nGates owns a $40 billion investment firm, called Cascade Investment LLC — and it holds a swath of assets.\n\nFounded in 1995, Cascade is a holding company managed by Michael Larson. The firm's assets include more than half of Gates’ fortunes, outside of his shares in Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust Endowment.\n\nIt holds Four Seasons Hotel and Resorts, in fact, 71.3% of it.\n\nCascade first invested in the luxury hotel chain in 1997 when the company was public. It shared 47.5% ownership with Kingdom Holding after it was taken private ten years later. In 2021, Cascade bought half of the Kingdom’s stake for roughly $2.21 billion, giving Gates a controlling 71.3% stake in the $10 billion company.\n\nThe investment firm also owns over 21% of Minnesota-based hygiene and food safety-tech company, Ecolab Inc.\n\nCascade, through the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation owns 8.11% of Canadian National Railway, an international transportation company.\n\nIt owns 10% of agricultural and heavy equipment machinery manufacturer, John Deere (Deere & Co).\n\nIt also owns roughly 5% of new and pre-owned vehicle retailer AutoNation.\n\nThat’s not all.\n\nGates has a massive real-estate portfolio, including a $130 million home in Medina, Washington purchased in 1988 for $2 million. The billionaire owns a 314-acre private island in Belize, and a $43 million beachfront mansion in San Diego.\n\nCheck Out More on Real Estate from Benzinga\n\nBezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100\n\nAnalysts Are Bullish On Industrial Real Estate: Here Are 2 Private Market Offerings To Gain Exposure\n\nTechies Will Soon Flood Austin Even Harder.
