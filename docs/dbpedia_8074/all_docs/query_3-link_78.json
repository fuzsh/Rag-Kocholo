WHEN I\n\n25 READ THE ARTICLE, WHAT IT SAID INTERESTED ME\n\nPAGE 11\n\n1 ENOUGH AND CONCERNED ME ENOUGH I DID SEEK TO FIND\n\n2 OUT IF THERE WAS A MAY MEETING, BUT I DON'T THINK\n\n3 THE ARTICLE IS WHAT YOU'RE SUGGEST--SAID WHAT\n\n4 YOU'RE SUGGESTING. I MEAN, WE SHOULD GET A COPY\n\n5 OF THE ARTICLE. I DON'T REMEMBER IT THAT WAY. I\n\n6 REMEMBER ANDREESSEN TALKING ABOUT HOW HE HAD BEEN\n\n7 IN FEAR THAT DON CORLEONE HAD COME TO SEE HIM.\n\n8 AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE I REALIZED THAT THERE\n\n9 WAS NO MEETING IN MAY AND THAT IT WASN'T--YOU\n\n10 KNOW, THAT HE, AFTER THE MEETING, SAID HE ENJOYED\n\n11 THE MEETING AND THAT IT WAS, YOU KNOW, JUST A\n\n12 GROUP OF OUR GUYS DOWN THERE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT\n\n13 IF THERE WAS ANYWAY AREAS OF COOPERATION, IT\n\n14 SEEMED--THE WHOLE THING SEEMED VERY STRANGE TO\n\n15 ME.\n\n16 QUESTION: DID YOU TALK TO PEOPLE TO FIND\n\n17 OUT WHETHER THERE WAS A MAY MEETING?\n\n18 ANSWER: YES.\n\n19 QUESTION: WHO DID YOU TALK TO?\n\n20 ANSWER: I CONSULTED WITH MY LAWYERS.\n\n21 QUESTION: OTHER THAN CONSULTING WITH YOUR\n\n22 LAWYERS, DID YOU TRY TO FIND OUT WHETHER THERE\n\n23 WAS A MAY MEETING?\n\n24 ANSWER: WELL, MY LAWYERS, THEN, TALKED TO\n\n25 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE MET WITH NETSCAPE,\n\nPAGE 12\n\n1 AND I MADE SURE THEY DID THAT PRETTY BROADLY.\n\n2 QUESTION: YOU WERE INFORMED THAT THERE WAS\n\n3 NO MAY MEETING; IS THAT YOUR TESTIMONY?\n\n4 ANSWER: THAT'S THE UNDERSTANDING I WAS\n\n5 GIVEN, YES, AND THEN I WAS GIVEN SOME OTHER\n\n6 INFORMATION THAT I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED.\n\n7 QUESTION: BUT ALL OF THAT INFORMATION CAME\n\n8 FROM YOUR LAWYERS AND NOT FROM NONLAWYER\n\n9 EMPLOYEES OF MICROSOFT; IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE\n\n10 SAYING?\n\n11 ANSWER: IT CAME TO ME THROUGH MY LAWYERS.\n\n12 QUESTION: DID YOU EVER HAVE A CONVERSATION\n\n13 WITH ANYONE IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS, OTHER THAN\n\n14 YOUR LAWYERS, CONCERNING WHETHER THERE WERE\n\n15 MEETINGS IN MAY OR JUNE OF 1995 WITH NETSCAPE,\n\n16 AND IF SO, WHAT HAPPENED AT THOSE MEETINGS?\n\n17 ANSWER: WELL, THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A POINT\n\n18 AFTER I GOT ALL THE DATA FROM THE LAWYERS WHERE I\n\n19 SAID TO SOME OF THE PR PEOPLE WHAT AN OUTRAGEOUS\n\n20 SLANDER THAT ARTICLE HAD BEEN AND HOW UNFAIR I\n\n21 FELT IT WAS.

BUT THAT'S ALL VERY RECENT. THAT IS\n\n9 AFTER THE JOURNAL ARTICLE.\n\n10 QUESTION: NOW, HAVE YOU EVER READ THE\n\n11 COMPLAINT IN THIS CASE?\n\n12 ANSWER: NO.\n\n13 QUESTION: HAVE YOU EVER RECEIVED A SUMMARY\n\n14 OF THE COMPLAINT IN THIS CASE?\n\n15 ANSWER: I WOULDN'T SAY I'VE RECEIVED A\n\n16 SUMMARY, NO. I HAVE TALKED TO MY LAWYERS ABOUT\n\n17 THE CASE, BUT NOT REALLY THE COMPLAINT.\n\n18 QUESTION: DO YOU KNOW WHETHER IN THE\n\n19 COMPLAINT THERE IS AN ASSERTION--I'M NOT TALKING\n\n20 ABOUT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ARTICLE.

NEITHER OF THESE GUYS\n\n25 HAVE A TITLE LIKE `VICE PRESIDENT;' THAT I CAN\n\nPAGE 24\n\n1 SAY FOR SURE.

WALDMAN WAS IN CHARGE OF\n\n12 THIS UPDATE, AND THE MACOFFICE PRODUCT HAD BEEN\n\n13 SHIPPING FOR OVER A DECADE BY NOW, AND THERE WAS\n\n14 A FINANCIAL QUESTION OF WHETHER TO DO THIS\n\n15 UPDATE. AND HE FELT IT MADE GOOD BUSINESS\n\n16 SENTENCE TO DO IT. OTHER PEOPLE, IRRESPECTIVE OF\n\n17 THE RELATIONSHIP WITH APPLE, HAD SAID THAT IT\n\n18 DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO DO THE UPDATE. AND SO,\n\n19 THERE WAS SOME MAIL FROM BEN, INCLUDING THIS ONE,\n\n20 WHERE HE WAS SAYING HE THOUGHT WE SHOULD GO AHEAD\n\n21 AND FINISH THE PRODUCT.\n\n22 I'M NOT SURE WHAT HE MEANS ABOUT THE\n\n23 NEGOTIATIONS WITH APPLE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE\n\n24 WERE NEGOTIATING WITH APPLE AT THIS POINT.\n\n25 QUESTION: WAS THIS THE TIME THAT YOU WERE\n\nPAGE 31\n\n1 NEGOTIATING WITH APPLE TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT\n\n2 YOU COULD GET APPLE TO DO TO UNDERMINE SUN?\n\n3 ANSWER: WELL, THE ONLY E-MAIL--THE ONLY\n\n4 THING YOU'VE SHOWN ME WHERE THAT TERM WAS USED IS\n\n5 AFTER WE REACHED A MACOFFICE AGREEMENT WITH\n\n6 APPLE.\n\n7 QUESTION: YOU'RE REFERRING TO YOUR E-MAIL\n\n8 DATED AUGUST 8, 1997; IS THAT CORRECT?\n\n9 ANSWER: THAT'S RIGHT.\n\n10 QUESTION: THAT HAS BEEN MARKED AS\n\n11 EXHIBIT 265; IS THAT CORRECT?\n\n12 ANSWER: THAT'S RIGHT.

IT IS\n\n21 ONLY THREE LINES. YOU QUITE, QUOTE, I WANT TO\n\n22 GET AS MUCH MILEAGE AS POSSIBLE OUT OF OUR\n\n23 BROWSER AND JAVA RELATIONSHIP HERE.\n\n24 AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT `HERE,' YOU'RE\n\n25 TALKING ABOUT WITH APPLE, ARE YOU NOT, SIR?\n\nPAGE 32\n\n1 ANSWER: I'M NOT SURE.\n\n2 QUESTION: WELL, THE SUBJECT OF THIS IS `FW:\n\n3 POST-AGREEMENT;' CORRECT, SIR?\n\n4 ANSWER: YEAH. THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME THINK\n\n5 THIS WAS PROBABLY POST-AGREEMENT.\n\n6 QUESTION: POST-AGREEMENT WITH APPLE; RIGHT?\n\n7 ANSWER: YES.\n\n8 QUESTION: OKAY. SO, THE SUBJECT IS\n\n9 POST-AGREEMENT WITH APPLE, AND THE VERY FIRST\n\n10 SENTENCE SAYS, `I WANT TO GET AS MUCH MILEAGE AS\n\n11 POSSIBLE OUT OF OUR BROWSER AND JAVA RELATIONSHIP\n\n12 HERE.'\n\n13 THE SECOND SENTENCE SAYS, `IN OTHER WORDS, A\n\n14 REAL ADVANTAGE AGAINST SUN AND NETSCAPE.'\n\n15 THE THIRD LINE SAYS, `WHO SHOULD AVI BE\n\n16 WORKING WITH? DO WE HAVE A CLEAR PLAN ON WHAT WE\n\n17 WANT APPLE TO DO TO UNDERMINE SUN?'\n\n18 NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT WHEN YOU\n\n19 TALK ABOUT `I WANT TO GET AS MUCH MILEAGE AS\n\n20 POSSIBLE OUT OF OUR BROWSER AND JAVA RELATIONSHIP\n\n21 HERE,' YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT APPLE?\n\n22 ANSWER: THAT'S WHAT IT APPEARS.\n\n23 QUESTION: OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY\n\n24 RECOLLECTION OF ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE SUBJECT\n\n25 MATTER OF THIS E-MAIL IN OR ABOUT AUGUST OF 1997?\n\nPAGE 33\n\n1 IF THE QUESTION WAS CONFUSING, I WOULD BE\n\n2 HAPPY TO REPHRASE IT, MR.

WALDMAN TO YOU.\n\n12 DO YOU RECALL--AND I KNOW YOU'VE SAID YOU\n\n13 DON'T RECALL RECEIVING THIS E-MAIL, BUT DO YOU\n\n14 RECALL ANYONE DESCRIBING THE THREAT TO CANCEL\n\n15 MACOFFICE 97 AS A BARGAINING POINT THAT YOU HAVE\n\n16 IN DEALINGS WITH APPLE, IN OR ABOUT JUNE OF 1997?\n\n17 ANSWER: I REMEMBER GOING TO MEETINGS WHERE\n\n18 PAUL MARITZ TOOK THE POSITION THAT WE SHOULDN'T\n\n19 DO THE UPDATE, AND--THE MACOFFICE 97 UPDATE.\n\n20 AND THE MAIN NEGOTIATION WE HAD WITH APPLE\n\n21 AT THIS POINT WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT A PATENT\n\n22 CROSS-LICENSE, AND SO I SAID TO PAUL I WANTED TO\n\n23 UNDERSTAND BETTER WHERE WE WERE ON THE PATENT\n\n24 CROSS-LICENSE AND UNDERSTAND THE STATE OF THE\n\n25 MACOFFICE DEVELOPMENT.\n\nPAGE 34\n\n1 AND THEN IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS AN E-MAIL\n\n2 THAT IS COMING AFTER THAT MEETING. I DON'T\n\n3 REMEMBER SOMEBODY USING THOSE EXACT WORDS.\n\n4 QUESTION: WHETHER YOU REMEMBER SOMEBODY\n\n5 USING THE EXACT WORDS THAT MR. WALDMAN USES IN\n\n6 HIS JUNE 27, 1997, E-MAIL TO YOU, DO YOU REMEMBER\n\n7 PEOPLE TELLING YOU, IN SUBSTANCE, THAT THE THREAT\n\n8 TO CANCEL MACOFFICE 97 WAS A STRONG BARGAINING\n\n9 POINT THAT YOU HAD AGAINST APPLE AND THAT\n\n10 CANCELING MACOFFICE 97 WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL OF\n\n11 HARM TO APPLE IMMEDIATELY?\n\n12 ANSWER: I KNOW THERE WAS THE INTERNAL\n\n13 DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER TO DO THE UPDATE, AND I KNOW\n\n14 THERE WAS THE PATENT DISCUSSION GOING ON. AND I\n\n15 SAID THAT MAYBE--EVEN IF IT DIDN'T MAKE BUSINESS\n\n16 SENSE TO DO THE UPDATE, MAYBE AS PART OF AN\n\n17 OVERALL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PATENT\n\n18 CROSS-LICENSE, THAT WE SHOULD GO AHEAD AND DO IT.\n\n19 AND SO, A COMMITMENT TO DO THE UPGRADE WAS\n\n20 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TOLD APPLE WE MIGHT\n\n21 COMMIT TO AS PART OF THE PATENT CROSS-LICENSE\n\n22 RELATIONSHIP.\n\n23 QUESTION: AND DID YOU BELIEVE IN 1997 THAT\n\n24 CANCELING MACOFFICE 97 WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL OF\n\n25 HARM TO APPLE, AS MR. WALDMAN WRITES YOU IT\n\nPAGE 35\n\n1 WOULD?\n\n2 ANSWER: THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER\n\n3 TO DO THE UPGRADE AND WHETHER IT MADE BUSINESS\n\n4 SENSE. I CAN'T REALLY SAY HOW MUCH IMPACT IT\n\n5 WOULD HAVE ON APPLE OF US DOING THE UPGRADE OR\n\n6 NOT. CERTAINLY BEN, AS THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF\n\n7 THE UPGRADE, WAS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT ITS\n\n8 IMPORTANCE AND ITS DRAMATIC NATURE.\n\n9 QUESTION: MY QUESTION TO YOU NOW, SIR, IS\n\n10 WHETHER YOU BELIEVED THAT CANCELING MACOFFICE 97\n\n11 WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL OF HARM TO APPLE.\n\n12 ANSWER: WELL, I KNOW THAT APPLE WOULD\n\n13 PREFER THAT WE HAVE A MORE UPDATED VERSION OF\n\n14 MACOFFICE, THAT THAT WOULD BE A POSITIVE THING\n\n15 FOR THEM, AND SO THAT'S WHY IT WAS PART OF THE\n\n16 NEGOTIATION RELATIVE TO THE PATENT CROSS-LICENSE.\n\n17 QUESTION: AND DID YOU BELIEVE THAT\n\n18 CANCELING MACOFFICE 97 WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL OF\n\n19 HARM TO APPLE?\n\n20 ANSWER: I TOLD YOU I THINK IT WOULD BE\n\n21 BETTER FOR APPLE TO HAVE EVERYBODY DOING MAJOR\n\n22 UPGRADES LIKE THIS. I DOUBT--YOU KNOW, I\n\n23 DON'T--I CAN'T CHARACTERIZE THE LEVEL OF BENEFIT\n\n24 OF THE UPGRADE TO APPLE, BUT CERTAINLY IT'S\n\n25 SOMETHING THEY WANTED US TO COMPLETE.\n\nPAGE 36\n\n1 QUESTION: THE NEXT SENTENCE IN\n\n2 MR. WALDMAN'S JUNE 27, 1997, E-MAIL TO YOU\n\n3 BEGINS, `I ALSO BELIEVE THAT APPLE IS TAKING THIS\n\n4 THREAT PRETTY SERIOUSLY.'\n\n5 DID SOMEONE TELL YOU, IN OR ABOUT JUNE OF\n\n6 1997, THAT APPLE WAS TAKING MICROSOFT'S THREAT TO\n\n7 CANCEL MACOFFICE 97 SERIOUSLY OR PRETTY\n\n8 SERIOUSLY?\n\n9 ANSWER: WELL, MARITZ HAD TAKEN THE POSITION\n\n10 THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE BUSINESS SENSE TO FINISH THIS\n\n11 UPGRADE, AND IT'S VERY POSSIBLE APPLE MIGHT HAVE\n\n12 HEARD ABOUT MARITZ'S OPINION THERE AND,\n\n13 THEREFORE, BEEN WORRIED THAT WE, BUSINESS-WISE,\n\n14 DIDN'T SEE A REASON TO COMPLETE THE UPGRADE, AND\n\n15 THAT THEY--THEY WOULD HAVE THE OLDER MACOFFICE AS\n\n16 OPPOSED TO THIS NEW WORK THAT WE WERE PARTWAY\n\n17 ALONG ON.\n\n18 QUESTION: MR. GATES, MY QUESTION IS NOT\n\n19 WHAT POSITION MR. MARITZ DID OR DID NOT TAKE. MY\n\n20 QUESTION IS WHETHER ANYONE TOLD YOU, IN OR ABOUT\n\n21 JUNE OF 1997, THAT APPLE WAS TAKING PRETTY\n\n22 SERIOUSLY MICROSOFT'S THREAT TO CANCEL\n\n23 MACOFFICE 97.\n\n24 ANSWER: APPLE MAY HAVE KNOWN THAT SENIOR\n\n25 EXECUTIVES AT MICROSOFT, MARITZ IN PARTICULAR,\n\nPAGE 37\n\n1 THOUGHT THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE BUSINESS SENSE TO\n\n2 COMPLETE THAT UPGRADE.\n\n3 QUESTION: MR. GATES, I'M NOT ASKING YOU\n\n4 WHAT APPLE MAY HAVE KNOWN OR MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN.\n\n5 WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS WHETHER ANYBODY TOLD YOU,\n\n6 IN OR ABOUT JUNE OF 1997, THAT APPLE WAS TAKING\n\n7 PRETTY SERIOUSLY MICROSOFT'S THREAT TO CANCEL\n\n8 MACOFFICE 97.\n\n9 ANSWER: THOSE PARTICULAR WORDS?\n\n10 QUESTION: TOLD YOU THAT IN WORDS OR IN\n\n11 SUBSTANCE.\n\n12 ANSWER: I THINK I REMEMBER HEARING THAT\n\n13 APPLE HAD HEARD ABOUT MARITZ'S VIEW THAT IT\n\n14 DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE THE UPGRADE,\n\n15 BUT--AND THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED US TO\n\n16 CONTINUE THE UPGRADE. BUT I--I DON'T REMEMBER\n\n17 ANY OF THE--IT BEING PHRASED AT ALL THE WAY\n\n18 YOU'RE PHRASING IT.\n\n19 QUESTION: WELL, THE WAY I'M PHRASING IT IS\n\n20 THE WAY THAT MR. WALDMAN PHRASED IT TO YOU IN HIS\n\n21 E-MAIL OF JUNE 27 OF 1997; CORRECT, SIR?\n\n22 ANSWER: WELL, IN READING IT, I SEE THOSE\n\n23 WORDS, YES.\"\n\n24 (PAUSE.)\n\n25 \"QUESTION: MR. GATES, MR.

AND CERTAINLY IN THE E-MAIL TO THIS\n\n38 GROUP, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE PATENT THING,\n\n39 BUT BELIEVE ME, IT WAS OUR TOP GOAL IN THINKING\n\n40 ABOUT APPLE FOR MANY, MANY YEARS BECAUSE OF THEIR\n\nPAGE 40\n\n1 ASSERTIONS.\n\n2 QUESTION: MY TIME FRAME IN MY QUESTION,\n\n3 SIR, WAS A TIME FRAME BEGINNING IN 1996, WHEN YOU\n\n4 BEGAN TO VIEW NETSCAPE OR THE JAVA RUNTIME THREAT\n\n5 AS A COMPETITIVE THREAT TO MICROSOFT.\n\n6 ANSWER: AND THAT WAS AFTER JUNE OF 1996.\n\n7 QUESTION: AND IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT IN\n\n8 JUNE OF 1996 YOU DID NOT CONSIDER NETSCAPE TO BE\n\n9 A COMPETITIVE THREAT TO MICROSOFT?\n\n10 ANSWER: NETSCAPE WAS A COMPETITOR, BUT IN\n\n11 TERMS OF JAVA AND ALL THE RUNTIME-RELATED ISSUES,\n\n12 WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF THAT AT ALL.\n\n13 QUESTION: SO THAT--I WANT TO BE SURE I'VE\n\n14 GOT YOUR TESTIMONY ACCURATELY.\n\n15 IT IS YOUR TESTIMONY THAT IN JUNE OF 1996\n\n16 YOU CONSIDERED NETSCAPE TO BE A COMPETITIVE\n\n17 THREAT, BUT YOU DID NOT CONSIDER JAVA OR JAVA\n\n18 RUNTIME TO BE A COMPETITIVE THREAT; IS THAT YOUR\n\n19 TESTIMONY?\n\n20 ANSWER: WE CONSIDERED NETSCAPE TO BE A\n\n21 COMPETITOR, AND I TOLD YOU EARLIER THAT UNTIL\n\n22 LATE '96, WE WERE UNCLEAR ABOUT OUR POSITION ON\n\n23 VARIOUS JAVA RUNTIME THINGS AND WHAT OTHER\n\n24 COMPANIES WERE DOING AND WHAT THAT MEANT FOR US\n\n25 COMPETITIVELY.\n\nPAGE 41\n\n1 QUESTION: DO YOU AGREE THAT IN JUNE OF\n\n2 1996, THE TWO KEY GOALS THAT YOU HAD IN TERMS OF\n\n3 THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP WERE, QUOTE, ONE, MAINTAIN\n\n4 YOUR APPLICATIONS SHARE ON THE PLATFORM; AND TWO,\n\n5 SEE IF YOU COULD GET APPLE TO EMBRACE INTERNET\n\n6 EXPLORER IN SOME WAY?\n\n7 ANSWER: NO.\n\n8 QUESTION: DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPLANATION FOR\n\n9 WHY YOU WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO MR. MARITZ AND\n\n10 MR. SILVERBERG ON JUNE 23, 1996, THAT THOSE WERE\n\n11 YOUR TWO KEY GOALS IN THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP?\n\n12 ANSWER: NO, THEY WEREN'T INVOLVED IN THE\n\n13 PATENT ISSUE AT ALL, SO WHEN I WRITE TO THEM, I'M\n\n14 FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES THAT RELATE TO THEM.\n\n15 I DO MENTION PATENTS IN HERE, BUT THAT\n\n16 CERTAINLY WAS THE PRIMARY GOAL AT THIS TIME AND\n\n17 IN SUBSEQUENT TIMES.\n\n18 QUESTION: LET ME BE CLEAR. WHEN YOU WRITE\n\n19 TO MR. MARITZ AND MR. SILVERBERG, YOU TALK ABOUT\n\n20 PATENTS, DO YOU NOT, SIR?\n\n21 ANSWER: WHERE DO YOU SEE THAT?\n\n22 QUESTION: WELL, DID YOU TALK ABOUT PATENTS?\n\n23 ANSWER: DO YOU WANT ME TO READ THE ENTIRE\n\n24 MAIL?\n\n25 QUESTION: HAVE YOU READ IT ENOUGH TO KNOW\n\nPAGE 42\n\n1 WHETHER YOU TALK ABOUT PATENTS?\n\n2 ANSWER: I SAW THE WORD \"PATENT\" IN ONE\n\n3 PLACE. IF I READ THE WHOLE THING, I COULD FIND\n\n4 OUT IF IT'S IN THE OTHER PLACES AS WELL.\n\n5 QUESTION: YOU DO TALK ABOUT PATENT\n\n6 CROSS-LICENSE, DO YOU NOT, IN THIS MEMO? AND IF\n\n7 YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE LAST PAGE, FIVE LINES\n\n8 FROM THE BOTTOM.\n\n9 ANSWER: YEAH, THEY WEREN'T INVOLVED IN THE\n\n10 PATENT ISSUES AT ALL, SO IT LOOKS LIKE IN THIS\n\n11 MAIL I JUST MENTION THAT IN A SUMMARY PART, BUT\n\n12 IT WAS OUR TOP GOAL IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH\n\n13 APPLE.\n\n14 QUESTION: WHEN YOU WRITE TO MR. MARITZ AND\n\n15 MR. SILVERBERG, YOU DON'T DESCRIBE THAT AS YOUR\n\n16 TOP GOAL. IN FACT, YOU DON'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT AS\n\n17 ONE OF YOUR TWO OR THREE KEY GOALS; CORRECT, SIR?\n\n18 ANSWER: THIS PIECE OF E-MAIL DOESN'T TALK\n\n19 ABOUT THE PATENT GOAL AS THE TOP GOAL. IT'S MOST\n\n20 LIKELY THAT'S BECAUSE THE PEOPLE COPIED ON THE\n\n21 MAIL DON'T HAVE A THING TO DO WITH IT, AND I\n\n22 WOULDN'T DISTRACT THEM WITH IT.\n\n23 QUESTION: I WANT TO BE SURE I HAVE YOUR\n\n24 TESTIMONY CORRECT.\n\n25 IN JUNE OF 1996, WHAT WAS PAUL MARITZ'S\n\nPAGE 43\n\n1 TITLE?\n\n2 ANSWER: HE WAS INVOLVED IN PRODUCT\n\n3 DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.\n\n4 QUESTION: HE WAS INVOLVED IN PRODUCT\n\n5 DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.\n\n6 WHAT WAS HIS TITLE?\n\n7 ANSWER: I DON'T KNOW.

MARITZ.\n\n19 QUESTION: DID HE HAVE A TITLE?\n\n20 ANSWER: I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS TITLE WAS AT\n\n21 THE TIME. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OFFICER OF SOME\n\n22 KIND.\n\n23 QUESTION: AN OFFICER OF SOME KIND.\n\n24 SO, YOU'RE WRITING A MEMO TO PAUL MARITZ, A\n\n25 SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT; AND BRAD SILVERBERG, AN\n\nPAGE 44\n\n1 OFFICER OF SOME KIND, AND YOU'RE SENDING COPIES\n\n2 TO FOUR OTHER PEOPLE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE APPLE\n\n3 MEETING. AND YOU SAY, `I HAVE TWO KEY GOALS IN\n\n4 INVESTING IN THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP.'\n\n5 ANSWER: THAT'S QUITE DISTINCT THAN ANY\n\n6 GOALS I MIGHT HAVE FOR A DEAL WITH APPLE. IT\n\n7 SAYS, `I HAVE TWO KEY GOALS IN INVESTING IN THE\n\n8 APPLE RELATIONSHIP,' NOT, `I HAVE TWO KEY GOALS\n\n9 FOR A DEAL WITH APPLE.'\n\n10 QUESTION: WELL, SIR, AT THE BOTTOM YOU SAY\n\n11 WHAT YOU PROPOSE IN TERMS OF A DEAL, AND YOU TALK\n\n12 ABOUT WHAT APPLE WILL GET OUT OF THE DEAL AND\n\n13 WHAT MICROSOFT WILL GET OUT OF THE DEAL; CORRECT,\n\n14 SIR?\n\n15 ANSWER: DO YOU WANT ME TO READ TO YOU THE\n\n16 E-MAIL? I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE THAN\n\n17 JUST WHAT IT SAYS IN THE E-MAIL. I'M GLAD TO\n\n18 READ IT TO YOU.\n\n19 QUESTION: WELL, SIR, DOES IT SAY AT THE\n\n20 BOTTOM OF THE E-MAIL THAT YOU ARE PROPOSING\n\n21 SOMETHING WITH APPLE AND YOU ARE IDENTIFYING WHAT\n\n22 APPLE WOULD GET UNDER YOUR PROPOSED DEAL AND WHAT\n\n23 MICROSOFT WOULD GET UNDER YOUR PROPOSED DEAL?\n\n24 ANSWER: YEAH, THAT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE\n\n25 E-MAIL.\n\nPAGE 45\n\n1 QUESTION: IN FACT, THE BOTTOM OF THE E-MAIL\n\n2 TALKING ABOUT A PROPOSED APPLE MICROSOFT DEAL,\n\n3 YOU SAY, QUOTE, THE DEAL WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS,\n\n4 AND THEN YOU GOT A COLUMN `APPLE GETS' AND A\n\n5 COLUMN `MICROSOFT GETS' AND A COLUMN `BOTH GETS;'\n\n6 RIGHT, SIR?\n\n7 ANSWER: I'M READING THAT.\n\n8 QUESTION: OKAY. NOW, IN THIS E-MAIL OF A\n\n9 PAGE OR A PAGE AND A HALF IN WHICH YOU ARE\n\n10 PROPOSING THIS DEAL, YOU DESCRIBE YOUR TWO KEY\n\n11 GOALS AS MAINTAINING MICROSOFT'S APPLICATIONS\n\n12 SHARE ON THE PLATFORM, AND GETTING APPLE TO\n\n13 EMBRACE INTERNET EXPLORER; CORRECT?\n\n14 ANSWER: NO, THAT'S WRONG.\n\n15 QUESTION: THAT'S WRONG, OKAY.\n\n16 ANSWER: THE WORD `DEAL' AND THE WORD\n\n17 `RELATIONSHIP' ARE NOT THE SAME WORD. THIS SAYS,\n\n18 `I HAVE TWO KEY GOALS IN INVESTING IN THE APPLE\n\n19 RELATIONSHIP.' THIS DOWN HERE IS AN AGREEMENT\n\n20 WHICH I THOUGHT WE COULD REACH WITH APPLE.\n\n21 QUESTION: AND IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY HERE\n\n22 TODAY UNDER OATH THAT YOUR TWO KEY GOALS IN\n\n23 INVESTING IN THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP, WHICH YOU\n\n24 MENTIONED IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH OF THIS E-MAIL,\n\n25 IS DIFFERENT THAN YOUR TWO KEY GOALS IN THE\n\nPAGE 46\n\n1 PROPOSED DEAL THAT YOU DESCRIBE FIVE PARAGRAPHS\n\n2 LATER?\n\n3 ANSWER: I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN HERE ABOUT\n\n4 THE KEY GOALS--TWO KEY GOALS IN THE DEAL. I'VE\n\n5 TOLD YOU THAT I'M CERTAIN THAT MY PRIMARY GOAL IN\n\n6 ANY DEAL WAS THE PATENT CROSS-LICENSE.\n\n7 QUESTION: MR.

WHAT\n\n22 I'M ASKING YOU IS WHETHER THAT CHANGED AFTER THIS\n\n23 PERSON GOT FIRED.\n\n24 ANSWER: WE RE-EVALUATED ALL OF OUR THOUGHTS\n\n25 ABOUT WORKING WITH APPLE BASED ON WHAT THE NEW\n\nPAGE 52\n\n1 MANAGEMENT WAS GOING TO DO, WHETHER THEY WERE\n\n2 GOING TO TARGET THE MACHINES, WHAT THEY WERE\n\n3 GOING TO DO WITH THEIR MACHINES.

ONE OF--\n\n12 ANSWER: IN INVESTING IN THE APPLE\n\n13 RELATIONSHIP.\n\n14 QUESTION: ONE OF THEM IS TO GET APPLE TO\n\n15 EMBRACE INTERNET TECHNOLOGY IN SOME WAY. WHAT\n\n16 I'M ASKING YOU IS WHETHER THAT CHANGED AFTER THIS\n\n17 PERSON GOT FIRED.\n\n18 THE WITNESS: YOU KEEP, EITHER INTENTIONALLY\n\n19 OR UNINTENTIONALLY, TRYING TO CONFUSE MY GOALS\n\n20 FOR INVESTING IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOALS\n\n21 WE HAD OVERALL FOR VARIOUS DEALINGS WITH APPLE.\n\n22 CERTAINLY, THE GOALS I HAD FOR INVESTING IN THE\n\n23 RELATIONSHIP, THAT I HAD TO START OVER AND\n\n24 RETHINK BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT WAS TO SPEND TIME\n\n25 WITH THE CEO WHO HAD BEEN FIRED.\n\nPAGE 53\n\n1 BY MR.

IT STATES MY GOALS\n\n13 IN INVESTING IN THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP. SO,\n\n14 THERE IS A CLEAR DISTINCTION RIGHT THERE IN THAT\n\n15 DOCUMENT.\n\n16 QUESTION: MR. GATES, THIS DOCUMENT DEALS\n\n17 WITH A PROPOSED DEAL THAT YOU MADE TO TOP APPLE\n\n18 EXECUTIVES; CORRECT?\n\n19 ANSWER: THAT'S ONLY ONE PART OF WHAT IS IN\n\n20 THE DOCUMENT. THERE IS A PART WHERE IT TALKS\n\n21 ABOUT--YOU NEVER MENTIONED IT, BUT THE FIRST GOAL\n\n22 IS MAINTAIN OUR APPLICATIONS SHARE ON THE\n\n23 PLATFORM. THAT'S SOMETHING I'M DOING IN\n\n24 INVESTING IN THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT'S\n\n25 NOT RELATED TO THE DEAL THAT'S GIVEN--THE\n\nPAGE 54\n\n1 PROPOSED DEAL THAT'S DISCUSSED BELOW IN THE\n\n2 E-MAIL.\n\n3 SO, THOSE ARE CLEARLY TWO SEPARATE THINGS.\n\n4 RELATED, BUT SEPARATE.\n\n5 QUESTION: WHAT I THINK I'VE DONE IS I THINK\n\n6 I HAVE MENTIONED THE FIRST GOAL A NUMBER OF\n\n7 TIMES.\n\n8 ANSWER: I DON'T THINK SO.\"\n\n9 \"QUESTION: NOW, YOU SAY HERE, `I HAVE TWO\n\n10 KEY GOALS IN INVESTING IN APPLE RELATIONSHIP, ONE\n\n11 OF WHICH WAS TO GET APPLE TO EMBRACE INTERNET\n\n12 EXPLORER TECHNOLOGY IN SOME WAY.'\n\n13 DID THAT CONTINUE TO BE A GOAL THAT YOU HAD\n\n14 AFTER 1996?\n\n15 ANSWER: IT WASN'T A GOAL IN INVESTING IN\n\n16 THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS--IN THE SENSE I\n\n17 MEANT IT HERE.

WAS IT A KEY GOAL?\n\n3 ANSWER: I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY `KEY\n\n4 GOAL.' IT WAS A GOAL.\n\n5 QUESTION: WHAT I MEAN BY KEY GOAL IS WHAT\n\n6 YOU MEANT BY KEY GOAL IN YOUR JUNE 23, 1996,\n\n7 E-MAIL, MR. GATES.\n\n8 ANSWER: THAT'S ABOUT INVESTING IN THE APPLE\n\n9 RELATIONSHIP, WHICH MEANT SPENDING TIME WITH GIL\n\n10 AMELIO, SO I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CAN TAKE THE WORD\n\n11 OUT OF THERE AND APPLY IT TO A COMPLETELY\n\n12 DIFFERENT CONTEXT.\n\n13 QUESTION: BUT, SIR, WHEN YOU SAY A\n\n14 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONTEXT, LET'S BE CLEAR\n\n15 ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.\n\n16 THE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONTEXT THAT YOU'RE\n\n17 TALKING ABOUT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVESTING\n\n18 IN THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP AND DOING A DEAL WITH\n\n19 APPLE; IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?\n\n20 ANSWER: NO. WE HAVE GOALS FOR OUR GENERAL\n\n21 DEALINGS WITH APPLE, WHICH CAME TO A DEAL--WE\n\n22 ACTUALLY REACHED A DEAL EITHER IN LATE JULY '97\n\n23 OR EARLY AUGUST. BUT THERE WAS A SEPARATE THING\n\n24 OF WHAT WAS THAT DEAL, WHAT WERE WE ABLE TO\n\n25 ACHIEVE, WHAT WERE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHEN WE\n\nPAGE 56\n\n1 WERE NEGOTIATING WITH THE PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT A\n\n2 DEAL, AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IN TERMS OF\n\n3 SPENDING MY TIME INVESTING IN THE APPLE\n\n4 RELATIONSHIP.\n\n5 QUESTION: AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS, IT IS\n\n6 YOUR TESTIMONY UNDER OATH, AND ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T\n\n7 RECALL ACTUALLY HAVING SENT THIS E-MAIL, YOU'RE\n\n8 CONFIDENT WHEN YOU WROTE THIS AND REFERRED TO\n\n9 INVESTING IN THE APPLE RELATIONSHIP, YOU MEANT\n\n10 ONLY WHAT YOU EXPECTED TO GET OUT OF SPENDING\n\n11 TIME WITH THE APPLE EXECUTIVES; IS THAT YOUR\n\n12 TESTIMONY?\n\n13 ANSWER: YEAH, I WAS EXPLAINING WHY I WAS\n\n14 SPENDING TIME WITH GIL AMELIO.\n\n15 QUESTION: AND THAT'S ALL YOU MEANT TO BE\n\n16 SAYING HERE, IS YOUR TESTIMONY?\n\n17 ANSWER: THAT'S WHAT--IN READING THIS,\n\n18 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE I WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE\n\n19 TO THE RECIPIENTS OF THE E-MAIL.\n\n20 QUESTION: ALL RIGHT, SIR.

AND I THINK\n\n24 THERE WERE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THEY\n\n25 WOULD INCLUDE OR BUNDLE IE WITH SOME OF THEIR\n\nPAGE 59\n\n1 SHIPMENTS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THAT'S REFERRING\n\n2 TO.\n\n3 QUESTION: AND IS THAT WHAT YOUR PRESENT\n\n4 RECOLLECTION IS THAT YOU TOLD YOUR EXECUTIVE\n\n5 STAFF IN AUGUST OF 1997?\n\n6 ANSWER: WELL, I DON'T RECALL SPECIFICALLY\n\n7 WHAT I SAID TO THE EXECUTIVE STAFF ABOUT APPLE,\n\n8 BUT IT APPEARS LUDWIG TOOK OUT OF THAT THAT HE\n\n9 WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER OUTS THAT\n\n10 APPLE HAD UNDER THE PREVIOUS AGREEMENT FOR NOT\n\n11 SHIPPING OUR TECHNOLOGY, THAT WE AVOIDED THOSE\n\n12 BEING A PROBLEM THAT PREVENTED THEM FROM SHIPPING\n\n13 OUR TECHNOLOGY.\n\n14 QUESTION: WELL, APPLE WASN'T PROHIBITED\n\n15 FROM SHIPPING YOUR TECHNOLOGY IN AUGUST OF 1997,\n\n16 WAS IT, SIR?\n\n17 ANSWER: NO. I ACTUALLY THINK THERE WAS--IF\n\n18 WE--I DON'T KNOW THE APPLE AGREEMENT, I HAVEN'T\n\n19 READ IT, BUT I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING IN THERE\n\n20 THAT IF WE GOT CERTAIN THINGS DONE AND IF THERE\n\n21 WERE NO PROBLEMS AND IT PASSED TESTS AND WE WERE\n\n22 READY IN TIME, THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY\n\n23 AFFIRMATIVELY INCLUDE SOME OF OUR TECHNOLOGY IN\n\n24 VARIOUS OS RELEASES.

HE JUST WANTS THEM SPLIT FROM OTHER\n\n14 POTENTIAL ALLIES.'\n\n15 AND THAT RELATES TO JAVA, DOES IT NOT, SIR?\n\n16 ANSWER: I DON'T HAVE A DIRECT RECOLLECTION,\n\n17 BUT IF YOU READ THE SENTENCE IN FRONT OF IT, THAT\n\n18 PARAGRAPH SEEMS TO RELATE TO JAVA RUNTIME.\n\n19 QUESTION: NOW, DO YOU HAVE A RECOLLECTION\n\n20 OF TELLING YOUR EXECUTIVE STAFF, IN OR ABOUT\n\n21 AUGUST 21, THAT YOUR WHOLE GOAL WITH RESPECT TO\n\n22 APPLE RELATING TO JAVA RUNTIME WAS TO KEEP APPLE\n\n23 AND SUN SPLIT?\n\n24 ANSWER: NO.\n\n25 QUESTION: WHO WAS AT THIS EXECUTIVE STAFF\n\nPAGE 61\n\n1 MEETING?\n\n2 ANSWER: PROBABLY MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE\n\n3 STAFF.\n\n4 QUESTION: AND WHO WERE THEY?\n\n5 ANSWER: IT'S ABOUT 40 TO 50 PEOPLE. I\n\n6 DOUBT YOU WANT TO TAKE THE TIME FOR ME TO GUESS.\n\n7 WE GENERALLY GET ABOUT 70 PERCENT ATTENDANCE.\n\n8 LOOKING AT THIS DOCUMENT, I THINK IT'S VERY\n\n9 LIKELY THAT I WAS THERE AND JOHN LUDWIG WAS\n\n10 THERE, BUT AS TO THE REST OF THE EXECUTIVE STAFF,\n\n11 I'D JUST BE GUESSING.\n\n12 IT'S VERY RARE FOR US TO HAVE NONEXECUTIVE\n\n13 STAFF MEMBERS AT THOSE MEETINGS, ALTHOUGH\n\n14 SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS.\n\n15 QUESTION: IS MR.

BOIES:\n\n22 QUESTION: ARE YOU AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT\n\n23 WAS INDIRECTLY AIMED AT THOSE THINGS?\n\n24 ANSWER: NO.\n\n25 QUESTION: DID, TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, ANY\n\nPAGE 74\n\n1 REPRESENTATIVE OF MICROSOFT TRY TO CONVINCE APPLE\n\n2 NOT TO SELL OR PROMOTE QUICKTIME FOR USES FOR\n\n3 WHICH MICROSOFT PROMOTES THE USE OF NETSHOW?\n\n4 ANSWER: THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE\n\n5 FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUNTIME CODE AND\n\n6 WHETHER WE COULD WORK TOGETHER ON THE WINDOWS\n\n7 SIDE OF THAT RUNTIME CODE THAT WOULD ENHANCE\n\n8 THEIR GOALS AND OUR GOALS.\n\n9 QUESTION: AND WAS THERE A DISCUSSION IN\n\n10 THAT CONTEXT ABOUT APPLE AGREEING NOT TO SELL OR\n\n11 PROMOTE QUICKTIME FOR USES THAT MICROSOFT WAS\n\n12 PROMOTING NETSHOW TO FULFILL?\n\n13 ANSWER: NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.\n\n14 QUESTION: INSOFAR AS YOU'RE AWARE, DID\n\n15 MICROSOFT REPRESENTATIVES TELL APPLE\n\n16 REPRESENTATIVES THAT IF APPLE WOULD AGREE NOT TO\n\n17 SELL OR PROMOTE QUICKTIME FOR USES FOR WHICH\n\n18 MICROSOFT OFFERED NETSHOW, THAT MICROSOFT WOULD\n\n19 HELP APPLE IN OTHER AREAS?\n\n20 ANSWER: WELL, THE QUICK--AS FAR AS I KNOW,\n\n21 THE QUICKTIME RUNTIME IS FREE. SO, WHEN YOU SAY\n\n22 `SELL,' I DON'T KNOW--I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN\n\n23 THERE.\n\n24 QUESTION: I THINK I SAID SELL OR PROMOTE, I\n\n25 CERTAINLY MEANT TO, BUT I WILL USE THE WORD\n\nPAGE 75\n\n1 `DISTRIBUTE,' IF THAT WILL HELP.\n\n2 ANSWER: I THINK THERE WAS A TECHNICAL\n\n3 DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER A COMMON RUNTIME WAS\n\n4 ACHIEVABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE ENHANCED THEIR\n\n5 QUICKTIME GOALS.\n\n6 QUESTION: WHEN YOU SAY `A COMMON RUNTIME,'\n\n7 WOULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT.\n\n8 ANSWER: I MEAN THAT THE WINDOWS MEDIA\n\n9 PLAYER RUNTIME WOULD COMBINE TECHNOLOGY FROM THEM\n\n10 AND FROM US THAT MET ALL OF THEIR GOALS FOR\n\n11 QUICKTIME.\n\n12 QUESTION: AND SO THERE WOULD BE A WINDOWS\n\n13 MEDIA PLAYER THAT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED, AND APPLE\n\n14 WOULD STOP DISTRIBUTING QUICKTIME FOR PURPOSES\n\n15 FOR WHICH THE WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER WAS\n\n16 DISTRIBUTED; IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?\n\n17 ANSWER: NO, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO STOP\n\n18 ANYTHING. THERE WOULD JUST BE A NEW RUNTIME THAT\n\n19 MIGHT INCORPORATE SOME OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY AND\n\n20 HELP THEM WITH THEIR QUICKTIME GOALS.\n\n21 QUESTION: WELL, WHEN YOU SAY THERE WOULD BE\n\n22 A NEW PROGRAM THAT WOULD INCORPORATE OR MIGHT\n\n23 INCORPORATE SOME OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY, WOULD THAT\n\n24 RESULT IN THEM STOPPING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR\n\n25 EXISTING QUICKTIME TECHNOLOGY?\n\nPAGE 76\n\n1 ANSWER: THERE'S NO REASON IT WOULD NEED TO.\n\n2 QUESTION: WAS THAT PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS?\n\n3 ANSWER: I DON'T THINK SO, BUT AS I TOLD\n\n4 YOU, I WASN'T PART OF ANY OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS.\n\n5 QUESTION: WERE YOU AWARE OF THOSE\n\n6 DISCUSSIONS WHILE THEY WERE GOING ON?\n\n7 ANSWER: I KNEW THAT APPLE HAD A--HAD THE\n\n8 QUICKTIME RUNTIME FOR WINDOWS. AND THERE WAS\n\n9 ALWAYS A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE COULD CREATE A\n\n10 WINDOWS RUNTIME THAT COMBINED WHAT THEIR GOALS\n\n11 WERE THERE AND WHAT THEY HAD DONE WELL THERE FOR\n\n12 THE WORK WE WERE DOING. AND I KNOW WE TALKED TO\n\n13 APPLE ABOUT WHETHER WE COULD HELP EACH OTHER IN\n\n14 AN EFFORT LIKE THAT.\n\n15 QUESTION: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HELPING EACH\n\n16 OTHER, WOULD THAT RESULT IN A SINGLE PRODUCT THAT\n\n17 WOULD THEN BE DISTRIBUTED IN PLACE OF BOTH\n\n18 QUICKTIME AND NETSHOW?\n\n19 ANSWER: NO. PEOPLE COULD STILL DISTRIBUTE\n\n20 THEIR OLD THINGS, BUT IF YOU CREATE A NEW THING\n\n21 THAT'S BETTER, IT MIGHT--SOME PEOPLE MIGHT USE\n\n22 IT.\n\n23 QUESTION: WELL, WAS THE PURPOSE OF CREATING\n\n24 THE NEW WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER THAT YOU REFERRED\n\n25 TO, TO OBSOLETE QUICKTIME?\n\nPAGE 77\n\n1 ANSWER: WHATEVER FUNCTIONALITY QUICKTIME\n\n2 HAD PREVIOUSLY WOULD BE UNAFFECTED BY ANY SUCH\n\n3 EFFORT.\n\n4 QUESTION: THAT REALLY WASN'T MY QUESTION,\n\n5 MR. GATES. MAYBE I CAN STATE IT MORE CLEARLY.\n\n6 DID MICROSOFT TRY TO CONVINCE APPLE TO TAKE\n\n7 ACTIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN APPLE NO\n\n8 LONGER DISTRIBUTING QUICKTIME TO PEOPLE TO WHOM\n\n9 MICROSOFT WAS DISTRIBUTING NETSHOW OR A SUCCESSOR\n\n10 MICROSOFT PRODUCT?\n\n11 ANSWER: I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT\n\n12 WOULD HAVE STOPPED THEM FROM DISTRIBUTING THE\n\n13 QUICKTIME THEY HAD, BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE WE COULD\n\n14 COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO\n\n15 BOTH COMPANIES IN TERMS OF A PRODUCT THAT TOOK\n\n16 SOME OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY AND OURS AND WAS BETTER\n\n17 FOR USERS.\n\n18 QUESTION: DID MICROSOFT OFFER TO HAVE APPLE\n\n19 CONTINUE TO OFFER A MULTIMEDIA PLAYER FOR THE MAC\n\n20 PLATFORM AND TO ASSIST APPLE IN THAT IF APPLE\n\n21 WOULD AGREE NOT TO DISTRIBUTE THAT MULTIMEDIA\n\n22 PLAYER FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORM?\n\n23 ANSWER: AS I SAID, I DON'T THINK THERE WAS\n\n24 ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NOT DISTRIBUTING SOME OLD\n\n25 THING, BUT, RATHER, A QUESTION WAS COULD\n\nPAGE 78\n\n1 SOMETHING NEW BE CREATED WHICH WOULD BE BETTER\n\n2 FOR BOTH COMPANIES.\n\n3 QUESTION: WAS THE IDEA THAT ONCE THIS NEW\n\n4 THING WAS CREATED, THE OLD THING THAT APPLE WAS\n\n5 DISTRIBUTING WOULD NO LONGER BE DISTRIBUTED BY\n\n6 APPLE?\n\n7 ANSWER: AS I SAID, I DON'T THINK THAT WAS\n\n8 PART OF THE DISCUSSION.\n\n9 QUESTION: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TOLD ANYTHING,\n\n10 OR HAVE YOU READ ANYTHING, ABOUT ANY CONTENTION\n\n11 THAT APPLE MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE CONCERNING THESE\n\n12 DISCUSSIONS?\n\n13 ANSWER: NO.\"\n\n14 (PAUSE.)\n\n15 \"QUESTION: ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY ASSERTIONS\n\n16 BY APPLE REPRESENTATIVES THAT MICROSOFT\n\n17 REPRESENTATIVES TRIED TO GET THEM TO AGREE TO\n\n18 DIVIDE THE MARKET?\n\n19 ANSWER: NO.\n\n20 QUESTION: NO ONE HAS EVER TOLD YOU THAT?\n\n21 ANSWER: THAT'S RIGHT.\n\n22 QUESTION: AND YOU'VE NEVER HEARD THAT FROM\n\n23 ANY SOURCE?\n\n24 ANSWER: THAT'S RIGHT.\n\n25 QUESTION: DO I TAKE IT FROM WHAT YOU SAID\n\nPAGE 79\n\n1 YESTERDAY THAT IF, IN FACT, MICROSOFT\n\n2 REPRESENTATIVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO GET APPLE\n\n3 REPRESENTATIVES TO PARTICIPATE IN A MARKET\n\n4 DIVISION, THAT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO MICROSOFT\n\n5 POLICY?\n\n6 MR. HEINER: OBJECTION.\n\n7 THE WITNESS: THAT'S RIGHT.\n\n8 BY MR. BOIES:\n\n9 QUESTION: AND I TAKE IT THAT IF YOU FOUND\n\n10 OUT THAT PEOPLE HAD DONE THAT CONTRARY TO\n\n11 MICROSOFT'S POLICY, THEY WOULD BE APPROPRIATELY\n\n12 DEALT WITH?\n\n13 ANSWER: YES.\n\n14 QUESTION: ARE YOU A REGULAR READER OF THE\n\n15 WALL STREET JOURNAL?\n\n16 ANSWER: SOME DAYS I READ THE WALL STREET\n\n17 JOURNAL.\n\n18 QUESTION: ARE YOU AWARE OF A WALL STREET\n\n19 JOURNAL ARTICLE THAT DISCUSSES ASSERTIONS BY\n\n20 APPLE CONCERNING ALLEGED EFFORTS BY MICROSOFT TO\n\n21 GET APPLE TO AGREE TO DIVIDE MARKETS?\n\n22 ANSWER: NO.\n\n23 QUESTION: LET ME JUST REFER YOU TO A WALL\n\n24 STREET JOURNAL ARTICLE OF JULY 23, 1998, ENTITLED\n\n25 `U.S. PROBING MICROSOFT'S MULTIMEDIA ROLE.'\n\nPAGE 80\n\n1 DOES THAT REFRESH YOUR RECOLLECTION AS TO\n\n2 WHETHER YOU EVER SAW A--A WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\n3 ARTICLE ABOUT ALLEGED MARKET DIVISION ATTEMPTS\n\n4 BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND APPLE?\n\n5 MR.
