        "text": "Ever wondered what Bill Gates’ house looks like? As you would imagine the mansion of Business magnate Bill Gates would be no less than genius. Bill Gates is the third richest man in America according to Forbes, with a net worth of $124 Billion. It took seven years to build Bill Gates’ House “Xanadu 2.0”, and it is now one of The Most Expensive Houses in The World.\n\nHow Much Money Does Bill Gates House Cost?\n\nFrom the sand that is imported yearly for the beach from the Caribbean islands to the 6-meter-high trampoline room, the luxurious house was constructed at a cost of $63 million and took 7 years to be built.\n\nNaturally, the mansion is a technological masterpiece that contains many features which will indeed grab your attention; would you expect less of Gates?\n\n[irp posts=’140971′]\n\nThe Bill Gates’ house, called Xanadu 2.0, is spread across 66,000 square feet and contains a collection of rare manuscripts, one of which is written by Leonardo Da Vinci, and it alone is worth $8 million. Xanadu 2.0 was built using half a million wood logs, and if sold today, it will earn Gates over $145 million.\n\nWell, let’s start the tour, shall we?\n\nBill Gates’ House:\n\nHow Many Bedrooms Does Bill Gates House Have?\n\n1) Bedrooms\n\nThe house has got only 7 bedrooms. That sounds a bit weird regarding the massive area of the estate, but then what could Gates use 30 bedrooms for?\n\n2) Kitchens\n\nThere are 6 kitchens in Bill Gates’ house and 24 bathrooms, 10 of which contain bathtubs.\n\n3) Reception Hall\n\nA Reception Hall that can accommodate up to 200 guests, with a 22-foot-video screen on one wall and a 6 feet-wide limestone fireplace on the adjacent wall.\n\n4) Swimming Pool\n\nAn entire building, with a total area of 3,900 square feet, was constructed to encompass the 60-foot-long pool. There is a glass wall that one could swim under to reach the terrace outside. Moreover, there is an underwater sound system to listen to your favorite pieces of music while swimming.\n\n5) Garages\n\nThere are several garages at different locations around the premises. The coolest one is an underground garage that can take up to 10 cars and is made out of concrete and stainless steel. An artistic concept is behind the intentionally broken concrete. This is one part of the house that is not open to the public and not many people have seen it. While a garage door has many moving parts, it is highly dependent upon a fully functional garage door opener. Whether the garage door won’t open or the sensor isn’t working, learn about how to repair the garage door opener.\n\n6) Lighting System\n\nBeing a guest in Bill Gates’ house must be a dream-like experience. The climate and lighting inside the rooms are monitored by a high-tech sensor system. A pin is given to the guest at their arrival with which they can control the sensors. Hold on, that’s not all! The settings can change from one place to another as the guest enters and moves around the house.\n\n7) Artificial Stream\n\nRunoff issues that could occur in the future, due to the giant walls of the mansion, are addressed creatively by introducing an artificial stream. See the Trout and the Salmon swimming over there?\n\n8) Artworks\n\nDo you ever get bored of the paintings hanging on your wall? Well, Gates never does, with his $80,000 worth of screens installed all around the mansion. The display on the screens can be changed to the desired painting, photo, or artwork. The storage devices that were installed to store the Gates’ favorite collection of artworks, alone, cost $150,000.\n\n9) Environment-friendly house"
