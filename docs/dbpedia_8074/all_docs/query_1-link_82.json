        "text": "Co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n\nNo. 6\n\nRank on 2023 Forbes 400 List of Richest Americans\n\n$111 B\n\nNet Worth as of September 8, 2023\n\nAGE: 67 | SOURCE OF WEALTH: MICROSOFT, INVESTMENTS |SELF-MADE SCORE: 8/10 | RESIDENCE: MEDINA, WASHINGTON | CITIZENSHIP: UNITED STATES | MARITAL STATUS: DIVORCED | CHILDREN: 3 | EDUCATION: DROP OUT, HARVARD UNIVERSITY\n\nBill Gates turned his passion for computers into a job his senior year in high school coding for the electrical grid at a power plant in Washington state. He later dropped out of Harvard to launch software firm Microsoft with his high school friend Paul Allen in 1975 and took it public in 1986. Microsoft played a pivotal role in changing the landscape of personal computing, beginning at a time when very few individuals owned a computer. Forbes first listed Gates as a billionaire in 1987; he was the richest person in the world, according to Forbes, from 1995 through 2017 (except in 2008 and from 2010 through 2013). Largely due to the tens of billions of dollars of stock he donated to the Gates Foundation, he was overtaken as the world‚Äôs richest person in 2018 by Jeff Bezos. As of September 8, 2023, Gates was the sixth richest American (and the seventh richest worldwide). Gates ceded the Microsoft CEO role to Steve Ballmer (who lived down the hall from Gates his sophomore year at Harvard) in 2000; he remained chairman until 2014 and stayed on the board for six more years. He told Forbes earlier this year that he still spends about 10% of his time consulting with teams at Microsoft, including those at OpenAI, which Microsoft has backed. Despite his 2021 divorce from his wife Melinda, the two continue to co-chair The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which, with assets of $67.3 billion as of December 2022, is the largest private charitable foundation in the world.\n\nWealth History\n\nAsset Breakdown\n\nAs of September 8, 2023\n\nüíª Microsoft: $33.8 B\n\nWhen Gates left the board of Microsoft in March 2020, he owned about 1.3% of the software and cloud computing company‚Äôs stock, according to 2019 filings. A spokesperson for Gates did not comment on whether he has sold any shares since then, though in a late 2022 interview, Gates did tell Forbes that he still owns a lot of Microsoft shares. Forbes estimates that Gates has donated some of his Microsoft shares to the Gates Foundation, and some of his Microsoft shares to Melinda French Gates, who likely donated at least some of those to the Gates Foundation as well.\n\nüíµ Cash & Other Investments: $26.9 B\n\nA significant chunk of Gates‚Äô estimated fortune is invested in assets about which there is no public paper trail. Cascade Asset Management, run by Michael Larson, invests the assets of the Bill & Melinda Gates Trust ‚Äìwhich funds the Gates Foundation‚Äìplus the assets of the Gates family. According to its website, Cascade invests ‚Äúacross asset classes and geographies‚Äù with a long-term horizon.\n\nüöõ Republic Services: $16.1 B\n\nGates has owned shares of this garbage collection and recycling company since at least 2002. As of the most recent company filings, he has a 35% stake in the Phoenix-based company, which operates collection routes in 41 states plus 128 landfills and 71 recycling centers.\n\nüöú Deere & Co: $7.9 B\n\nIn July 2022, Gates donated nearly $1.3 billion worth of his shares in tractor and farm equipment maker Deere & Co. to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Gates also transferred about 5 million shares of Deere stock to Melinda French Gates in two different transactions in 2021 as part of their divorce settlement. He still owns a 6.5% stake in the 180-year-old company.\n\nüõéÔ∏è Four Seasons Hotels $6.6 B\n\nIn September 2021, Cascade Investment announced it was purchasing a majority stake in the Four Seasons management company, buying half of the shares owned by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. That lifted Gates‚Äô stake to 71.25% in a deal that gave the company at $10 billion enterprise value.\n\nüö∞ Ecolab: $5.7 B\n\nEcolab provides water purification, hygiene and infection prevention services to a mix of industries, from healthcare to food service to mining and manufacturing and petrochemicals. Gates owns just under 11% of the company‚Äôs shares, and added to his holding in August 2022. He was first listed as a shareholder with a stake of 5% or more in 2011.\n\nüß¥ Givaudan S.A.: $3.2 B\n\nGates has owned stock in this Swiss flavors and fragrances company since at least 2011. Its customers hail from the food and beverage industries as well as the personal care, fragrance and beauty industries. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also owns a stake in Givaudan.\n\nüìà Berkshire Hathaway: $2.4 B\n\nGates has been friends with Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett since 1991. They play bridge, talk business and books. In 2010, with Melinda French Gates, the pair launched the Giving Pledge, a group encouraging billionaires to give at least half their fortune to charitable causes. Gates joined the board of Berkshire Hathaway in 2004 and stepped down in March 2020. He is no longer required to disclose his Berkshire ownership; Forbes estimates he still owns the 4,050 A shares reported in 2020.\n\nüöó AutoNation: $1.5 B\n\nGates trimmed his stake in this Florida-based auto dealership firm by about 50% between early 2021 and early 2022. He transferred about $700 million worth of shares, one third of his stake, to Melinda French Gates in May and August 2021, likely as part of the divorce settlement. Cascade Investment then sold some of Gates‚Äô shares in September and October 2021. He retains a 21% stake in the Ft. Lauderdale-based company.\n\nüõ©Ô∏è Signature Aviation $1.4 B\n\nVia his investment firm Cascade Investment LLC, Gates partnered with Blackstone and private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners on a $4.7 billion deal to acquire Signature Aviation, which say it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs largest operator of private jet services, in 2021; Gates was reported to have a 30% stake. The company provides refueling, maintenance, repair of private jets and more at 200 locations around the world.\n\nüåæ Landholdings & Farmland: $1.2 B\n\nIn 2021 Gates was named the largest owner of farmland in the U.S., with 242,000 acres in 18 states, according to The Land Report. His largest holdings are in Louisiana, Arkansas and Nebraska. In Louisiana, his land has farmed corn, soybeans and rice.\n\nü•§ Fomento Economico Mexicano: $1.2 B\n\nBest known as Femsa, this Mexican company owns 47% of Coca-Cola Femsa, the largest franchise bottler of Coca-Cola products in the world by volume. It also operates small format retail chain Oxxo. In early 2023, Femsa sold its 14% stake in beer brewer Heineken. Gates owns just under 8% of the company.\n\nüõ§Ô∏è Canadian National Railway: $1.1 B\n\nGates, who‚Äôs owned stock in this Canadian rail firm since at least 2013, transferred about $1.5 billion of his shares in the company (about 18% of his stake) to Melinda French Gates in May 2021, likely as part of the couple‚Äôs divorce settlement, and donated about $5.2 billion worth of his shares to the Gates Foundation in July 2022. He sold nearly $1.7 billion of his stake between March and May 2022. All of these transactions reduced his stake in the company to 1.4%, according to a July 2022 filing regarding the Montreal-based company, which operates 19,500 miles of track in Canada and the U.S.\n\nüß™ Sika AG: $1.1 B\n\nThis Swiss chemicals company specializes in products for the construction and automotive industries that bond, seal, reinforce and more. Gates and the Gates Foundation have been shareholders since at least 2015. Sika announced in November 2021 that it was acquiring MBCC Group (formerly BASF Construction Materials) for more than $5.5 billion. The deal closed in May 2023.\n\nüç∫ Heineken Holding NV: $500 M\n\nGates purchased just under 4% of the Dutch beer brewer with a global brand in February 2023.\n\nüß¨ Ginkgo Bioworks: $300 M\n\nVia Cascade Investment, Gates began backing the synthetic biology startup in its Series C fundraising in 2016. Founded by four MIT Phds and their professor in 2008, the company says it is using cells to biologically produce things like novel drugs, food ingredients and chemicals typically made from petroleum. It went public in a SPAC transaction in September 2021. Gates owns just under 10% of the company‚Äôs Class A shares.\n\nüèòÔ∏è Homes: $230 M\n\nGates owns multiple homes across the U.S., the biggest of which, nicknamed Xanadu 2.0 and located in Medina, Washington‚Äìnot far from Seattle, took six years to build and spans 48,000 square feet. It‚Äôs assessed at nearly $147 million but likely worth at least $200 million. He‚Äôs also got a 6-bedroom home in Indian Wells‚Äìnear Palm Springs, and a compound on Hood Canal in Washington that started out as 12 separate properties.\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt deny being a rich guy with an opinion. I do believe, though, that it is an informed opinion, and I am always trying to learn more.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄîBill Gates\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n5/5\n\nPhilanthropy Score\n\nWith Melinda French Gates, he set up the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 and has since donated $59 billion, much of it gifts of Microsoft stock, to the foundation, which has grown to become the world‚Äôs largest private charitable foundation, with a $67.3 billion endowment. Warren Buffett began donating billions of dollars of Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Gates Foundation on an annual basis in 2006. The foundation funds programs in developing countries that improve health (including vaccinations) and work to lift people out of poverty; in the U.S., the foundation primarily funds education programs. Gates told Forbes in July 2022 that the goal is to increase annual giving 50% to $9 billion a year by 2026. The plan is for the Gates Foundation to run for just 25 more years, Gates said at a Forbes gathering in September 2022. Forbes estimates that the Gates‚Äô portion of the grants paid out by the Gates Foundation through August 2023 is $40.2 billion.\n\nSOME OF GATES FOUNDATION‚ÄôS LARGEST PLEDGES TO DATE:\n\n$10 B\n\nto fund vaccine research, development and delivery over a decade. Announced in January 2010\n\n$2.1 B\n\nto push for gender equality over five years, with a focus on family planning and health, and economic empowerment, announced in June 2021\n\n$1.8 B\n\nto the Global Polio Eradication Initiative over six years, with the goal of eliminating polio by 2018; announced in April 2013\n\n$1.55 B\n\nto Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, over five years, to provide lifesaving vaccines to children in the poorest countries; announced in January 2015\n\n$1.2 B\n\nto college scholarships for minority students‚Äì$50 million a year for 20 years‚Äì announced in September 1999; administered by the United Negro College Fund with the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the American Indian College Fund; an additional $200 million was pledged in 2018 over 10 years.\n\n$1.1 B\n\nfor K-12 math programs in the U.S. over four years; announced October 2022\n\nHistory\n\n1968\n\nGates developed his first software programs -including a tic tac toe game‚Äìat age 13 at Lakeside School, the private school he attended in Seattle‚Äìand where he had access to a computer, then a rare opportunity. In high school he and his friend Paul Allen (and later Microsoft cofounder) stole the password file for the offsite computer they had access to; Gates told a reporter at Time they were banned from using the computer for a year.\n\n1975\n\nGates dropped out of Harvard following his second year in order to join his friend Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico to work on adapting software for the Altair 8800, a newly released personal computer. They cofounded Micro-soft (initially spelled with a hyphen) in November. Gates and Allen (who was not a Harvard student) did early work on their software in the Harvard computer lab. Gates was admonished by Harvard‚Äôs administrative board for allowing a non-student (Allen) to log onto the school‚Äôs computer.\n\n1977\n\nGates was arrested in December in Albuquerque, reportedly for running a stop sign and driving without a license. In a 2007 interview with Time, Gates said he was out driving Paul Allen‚Äôs car, and ended up spending the night in jail.\n\n1985\n\nMicrosoft released spreadsheet software Excel and Windows 1, the first iteration of their operating system.\n\n1986\n\nMicrosoft went public on March 13, 1986, selling $61 million of stock. Gates was just 30 years old.\n\n1994\n\nBill and Melinda, who had been an employee at Microsoft, met in 1987. They got married in an unpublicized ceremony reportedly at the Manele Bay Hotel on the Hawaiian island of Lanai.\n\n1998\n\nMicrosoft lost a landmark antitrust suit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the attorneys general of 20 states. Gates‚Äô answers in a deposition tied to the suit were at times quite contentious, and included questioning the meaning of the word ‚Äúconcerned.‚Äù\n\n2000\n\nThe Gateses launched The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a combination of the William H. Gates Foundation and the Gates Learning Foundation. Gates handed off the Microsoft CEO job to Steve Ballmer, who lived down the hall from Gates his sophomore year at Harvard. Gates took on the role of chief software architect and remained chairman of the board.\n\n2002\n\nBill and Melinda‚Äôs third child, Phoebe, was born, following the birth of daughter Jennifer in 1996 and son Rory in 1999. All three children attended Lakeside School, the same private prep school in Seattle where Bill went.\n\n2008\n\nIn July Gates stepped down from his full-time role at Microsoft but stayed on the board. That followed his decision in 2006 to give up the chief software architect position. Gates said he was reordering his priorities and would focus more on the Gates Foundation.\n\n2014\n\nIn February, Gates stepped down as chairman but stayed on as a technical advisor and Microsoft board member. Satya Nadella was appointed Microsoft CEO.\n\n2020\n\nGates stepped down from the boards of Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway in March.\n\n2021\n\nBill Gates and Melinda French Gates announced their divorce‚Äìon Twitter and Instagram‚Äìin May. In October their older daughter Jenn married Olympic equestrian Nayel Nasser at a luxe wedding in North Salem, New York.\n\n2022\n\nGates transferred $20 billion to the Gates Foundation in July. At a Forbes conference in September, he said he expects the foundation to wind down its operations in 25 years.\n\n2023\n\nIn a February interview with Forbes, Gates said he‚Äôs been spending 10% of his time consulting with teams at Microsoft, including with OpenAI, which Microsoft backed. ‚ÄúThis is every bit as important as the PC, as the internet,‚Äù Gates said, referring to generative artificial intelligence tools like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. In March, Gates invested alongside Microsoft in AI chatbot startup Inflection.ai.\n\nOn The Cover: Bill Gates\n\n( left: April 1991; right: November 2011 )\n\nMore on Bill Gates\n\nForbesEXCLUSIVE: Bill Gates Reveals How He And Ex-Wife Melinda Came Together For Blockbuster $20 Billion Gift That Makes Them World's Biggest GiversForbesAmerica's Richest Tech Billionaires Have Lost $315 Billion In The Past YearForbesExclusive: Bill Gates Reveals The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Aims To Run For Just 25 More YearsForbesMelinda French Gates Has Sold More Than $1 Billion Of The Stocks She Got In The Divorce Settlement From Bill GatesForbesBill Gates Slams NFTs And Crypto Amidst Market PlungeForbesBill Gates Is Reupping His Commitment To Alzheimer's Research And Detection"
