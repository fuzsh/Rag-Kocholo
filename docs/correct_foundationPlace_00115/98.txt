Silicon Graphics, Inc ("SGI" for short, formerly Silicon Graphics Computer Systems) was a manufacturer of servers and workstations, with graphics capabilities as its niche. In its prime, the computers used MIPS processors (MIPS then being a subsidiary) and ran a version of Unix called Irix. In 1998, SGI began also manufacturing graphics workstations with Intel processors running Windows NT. In the 00's, the company started using Linux and Intel Itanium processor. SGI filed for bankruptcy in 2009, when many holdings, including the company's name and Internet domain name were taken over by Rackable Systems who then renamed itself to Silicon Graphics International.

In the keyboard community, SGI is known mostly for the "SGI Granite" keyboard.
