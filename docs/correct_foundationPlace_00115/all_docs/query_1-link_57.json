The system uses a Digital Video Converter that permits picture data transfer and display between a Digital Processor and a standard 525 line Television System. The Digital Processor has an 8000 word core memory and a Digital Tape Unit for storage and processing of digitized pictures. The Digital Video Converter stores a complete digital picture consisting of 384 x 489 picture elements on a magnetic disc. The picture elements, each having one of 256 possible shades of grey, are refreshed at standard television rates and are displayed in black and white on a television monitor or analyzed in a color television densitometer display. Television pictures of photographic transparencies are produced from a precision camera, digitized at an 8 MHz sampling rate and recorded on the disc for subsequent analysis by the Data Processor. Software for self-checking the system, transferring picture data and digitizing pictures was supplied with the equipment.\n\nacquired 1981 by LogEtronics (Springfield VA)\n\nSpectragraphics - San Diego\n\nfounded in 1981 by Kevin Kinsella and Bob Blumberg\n\n1982 - System 1250 raster display terminal compatible with IBM 3250\n\n1984 - System 1500 raster display terminal compatible with IBM 5080\n\nadvertisement\n\nTektronix - Beaverton OR\n\nTektronix Displays Web Site\n\n1970 - 4002 Storage Tube Display Terminal advertisement\n\n1972 - 4010 and 4014 Storage Tube Display Terminals\n\nWikipedia\n\nTrancept Systems Inc - Raleigh NC\n\nFounded 1986 by Tim Van Hook, Mary Whitton, Nick England\n\nProgrammable graphics/imaging accelerator for Sun Workstations\n\nVector General - Canoga Park CA\n\nfounded 1969 by Ken Anderson\n\nmanuals\n\nVectrix - Greensboro NC\n\nfounded 1980 by Richard Katz\n\n1983 - VX128, VX384 raster display system based on NEC 7220GDC\n\ndeveloper - Mike King (ex-Ikonas)\n\nmanuals etc.\n\nVicom Systems\n\nfounded 1981 by William K Pratt\n\nUSC Image Processing Institute spinoff\n\ndeveloped raster display image processing system - article\n\nVideographics - Berkeley CA\n\nfounded by Jack Klingelhofer and Pete Harris\n\ndeveloped raster graphics terminals\n\nlicensed design to AED - they later founded Jupiter Systems\n\nEarly Flight Simulator Image Generator Systems\n\n1980 Survey of Simulator Image Generator Architectures - PDF\n\n1995 Bibliography ( Carl Mueller) - http://www.cs.unc.edu/ techreports/95-015/FS_Bib_v1. pdf\n\n1995 \"Flight Simulator Visual System Research and Development - A Comprehensive Bibliography\" (Harold D Warner) - PDF\n\n1981 Bruce Schachter, \"Computer Image Generation for Flight Simulation\", IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, ( IEEE CG&A) vol.1, no. 4, pp. 29-68, October-December 1981 - reference\n\n1983 Bruce Schachter - \"Computer Image Generation\" (excellent historical review)\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/ Computer-Image-Generation- Bruce-Schachter/dp/0471872873/\n\n1985 Johnson K.
