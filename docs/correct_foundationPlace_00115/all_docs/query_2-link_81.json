Sublessee shall accept possession of the Sublease Premises on the Commencement Date in its \"as-is, where-is\" condition. Sublessee acknowledges that except as expressly stated in this Sublease, (i) Sublessor makes no warranties or representations regarding the physical condition of the Sublease Premises; (ii) Sublessee has had an opportunity to inspect the Sublease Premises, including the roof and structural components of the building; the electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and other building systems serving the Sublease Premises; and the environmental condition of the Sublease Premises and related common areas; and to hire experts to conduct such inspections on its behalf, and (iii) Sublessee is leasing the Sublease Premises based on its own inspection of the Sublease Premises and those of its agents, and is not relying on any statements, representations or warranties of Sublessor or its employees, brokers, agents or other representatives regarding the physical condition of the Sublease Premises.

Article 3.2 ASSUMPTION OF OBLIGATIONS. To the extent applicable to the Sublease Premises and Sublessee's use of the Sublease Premises and common areas, Sublessee hereby expressly agrees to comply with, and assumes and agrees to perform and discharge, as and when required by the Master Lease, all duties and obligations to be paid, performed or discharged by Sublessor under the terms, covenants and conditions of the Master Lease from and after the Commencement Date, except as specifically set forth in this Sublease.

However, if Master Lessor shall fall to perform its obligations under the Master Lease, Sublessor, upon receipt of written notice from Sublessee, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to enforce the obligations of Master Lessor under the Master Lease; provided, however, that Sublessor shall not be required to incur any costs or expenses in connection therewith unless Sublessee agrees to reimburse Sublessor for any such costs and expenses as Additional Rent hereunder.

In addition to all the rights and remedies provided to Sublessor at law or in equity, (a) if Sublessee fails, within any applicable grace periods provided herein, to perform any act on its part to be performed pursuant to the requirements of the Master Lease or as otherwise required by this Sublease, then Sublessor may, but shall not be obligated to, enter the Sublease Premises to perform such act, and all costs and expenses incurred by Sublessor in doing so shall be deemed Additional Rent payable by Sublessee to Sublessor upon demand; and (b) in the event of any breach by Sublessee of any of 'Its obligations under this Sublease, Sublessor shall have all of the rights with respect to such default which are available to Master Lessor under the Master Lease.

It is the parties' intent that this Sublease shall be an absolute net sublease, and Sublessee agrees that any and all charges, fees, impositions and payments of any kind whatsoever due or owing by Sublessor under the Master Lease shall be passed through to Sublessee as Additional Rent hereunder, except to the extent 5 <PAGE> any such amounts are due and owing by Sublessor as a result of Sublessor's failure to pay rent under the Master Lease (where Sublessee has timely made such payments to Sublessor) or carry the insurance required under the Master Lease.

Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor the sum specified in Article 1 as prepaid Rent, which shall be applied to the installments of Minimum Monthly Rent first coming due under this Sublease, as follows: (i) $73,861.45 upon execution of this Sublease and (ii) $73,863.45 on November 1, 1998. Article 5.5 LATE CHARGE.

Any notice given by Sublessor pursuant to Sections 1161 and 1162 of the California Code of Civil Procedure shall be deemed to be concurrent with. and not in addition to, the notice required herein. This provision for a late charge shall not be deemed to grant Sublessee a grace period or extension of time for performance. If any Rent remains delinquent for a period in excess of thirty (30) days then, in addition to such late charge, Sublessee shall pay to Sublessor interest on the delinquent amount from the end of such thirty (30) day period until paid, at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum or the maximum rate permitted by law.

The Security Deposit shall be held by Sublessor as security for Sublessee's faithful performance under this Sublease. If Sublessee fails to pay any Rent as and when due under this Sublease or otherwise fails to perform its obligations hereunder, then Sublessor may, at its option and without prejudice to any other remedy which Sublessor may have, apply, use or retain all or any portion of the Security Deposit toward the payment of delinquent Rent or for any loss or damage sustained by Sublessor due to such failure by Sublessee. Sublessee shall upon demand restore the Security Deposit to the original sum deposited. The Security Deposit shall not bear interest nor shall Sublessor be required to keep such sum separate from its general funds. Sublessee shall have the right to provide the Security Deposit in the form of a letter of credit in the full amount of the Security Deposit (the \"Letter of Credit\"). The Letter of Credit shall be in a form and issued by a financial institution that is reasonably acceptable to Sublessor. Sublessee shall cause the Letter of Credit to remain in effect during the entire Sublease Term and for an additional sixty (60) days following the expiration or earlier termination of this Sublease. If Sublessee fails to maintain, renew or replace the Letter of Credit at least thirty (30) days before its stated expiration date, Sublessor may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy, draw upon the entire amount of the Letter of Credit. Any amount drawn by Sublessor on the Letter of Credit but not applied by Sublessor to satisfy Sublessee's obligations hereunder shall be held by Sublessor in accordance with the other provisions of this section. If Sublessor draws on any portion of the Letter of Credit and applies such amount to cure Sublessee's default, Sublessee shall, within three (3) days of demand by Sublessor, restore the Letter of Credit to the full amount or deposit immediately available funds with Sublessor in the amount drawn under the Letter of Credit.

In the event that Sublessor's rent under the Master Lease is abated as a result of a casualty, the Minimum Monthly Rent due hereunder shall be abated on a pro rata basis such that the Minimum Monthly Rent shall be reduced by the same percentage as the \" Monthly Installments\" are reduced under the Master Lease. ARTICLE 13: INSPECTION OF THE SUBLEASE PREMISES. Sublessee shall permit Sublessor and its agents to enter the Sublease Premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of inspecting the same or posting a notice of non-responsibility for alterations, additions or repairs, provided that Sublessor (i) provides at least twenty-four (24) hours prior notice (except in the case of emergency), (ii) shall be accompanied by an employee of Sublessee at all times while in the Sublease Premises, (iii) shall comply with Sublessee's security procedures, and (iv) shall not unreasonably interfere with Sublessee's use of the Sublease Premises or the conduct of its business therein.
