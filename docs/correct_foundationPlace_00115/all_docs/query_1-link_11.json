        "text": "Why you must master model chaining. Linking the outputs of one AI model with another allows for the creation of a multifaceted solution. This method can both exceed the outcomes of a single model, but crucially, for the enterprise ROI calculation, can profer lower costs by optimization of 'good enough' wherever possible. While enterprise teams have discovered that a given foundation model may well perform adequately per requirement and desired outcome, prohibitive token costs have deterred many use cases from advancing to production. Meanwhile, the competitive effects of numerous specialized and vertical models will soon change the landscape and possibilities for both cost and quality, especially when designed in a multi-step process. Integrated chains leading to superior outcomes and controlled costs is the way forward, Roli, a router amidst any model, allows the formulation of these model chains to achieve the cost and quality outcomes you desire. Are you experimenting with model chaining? We'd love to speak, https://lnkd.in/evDesDBP\n\nHappy New Year! If you are an Enterprise CTO, you are probably thinking about your GenAI strategy. Here's a decent write-up by Gartner: https://gtnr.it/3RQodsK. To augment that, here are some #genai trends to track and act on in 2024: --Open and Smaller Models: Open models like Llama, Mistral, BERT, and FLAN are becoming competitive with larger, closed-source models. They're suitable for many use cases and offer transparency for Responsible AI. In my opinion, open & closed models are not in a zero-sum game; BOTH should be used for the right use case. Action: Implement a clear plan for using different models. Amazon Web Services (AWS) users can leverage Bedrock & SageMaker (https://bit.ly/3vkX4qa). -- Domain-Adapted Models: Use your enterprise proprietary data to extend a large language model via continued pre-training (CPT) for domain-specific tasks. Action: Assess your use cases and data for CPT alongside Fine-tuning. Learn more: https://lnkd.in/eNjbQm-m -- Multi-modal Models (MMMs): MMMs will gain prominence in 2024. Both commercial (like GPT-4V) and open-source models (like Llava) will be popular. Action: Expand into business cases served by MMMs. More about Llava: https://lnkd.in/eTvn82iM. -- AI Agents (RAG+++): AI agents using LLMs can improve upon RAG by intelligently utilizing multiple data sources. Action: Prepare APIs and Data Sources for AI agents. More information: https://lnkd.in/eVf_J_bA. -- LLMs with Graphs: Graphs are one of the best representations of real-world knowledge which when combined with LLMs can be very effective in various domains. Action: Identify suitable business cases and explore Graphs+LLMs. Details: https://lnkd.in/eF68FbVA. -- AI Routers: Most enterprises will end up using a dozen or more models and it will become necessary to manage multiple models - Auth, Audit and Smart Model Selection. Action: Build an AI router. AWS Bedrock can assist, but more is needed. Info: https://go.aws/4aFLkyA. -- FinOps meets MLOps: Focus on cost optimization for GenAI projects. 2023 was all about GenAI POCs; 2024 will be about production & big bills! Action: Learn about GenAI business cases and FinOps for GenAI: https://lnkd.in/ezfV8NTa. --Make AI Invisible. Technology is at its best when its invisible and seamless to the end user. Action: Look at existing enterprise applications and look for ways to rethink the user experience using GenAI while keeping the tech invisible. (https://bit.ly/3vkXvAO) What are you tracking? Watch out for more on domain-focused AI trends in areas like AI for the Edge, robotics, and Drug discovery etc. in upcoming posts."
