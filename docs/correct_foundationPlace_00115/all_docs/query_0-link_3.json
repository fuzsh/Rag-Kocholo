        "text": "Since 1988, the Foundation has made $731M in charitable grants to achieve a positive impact in communities around the world. While giving can vary from year to year, Intel Corporation has a goal of maintaining a consistent level of annual funding to the Intel Foundation.\n\nThe Intel Foundation does not have one physical office. The Foundation is incorporated in Oregon and the Intel employees who run the Foundation are based at different Intel sites.\n\nThe Intel Foundation’s Board of Directors consists of senior Intel executives with a diverse range of experience. Please see the “Our Leadership” section of our web site to view the current board members.\n\nThe Intel Foundation does not accept unsolicited funding proposals or requests. However, organizations based in the United States may share information about programs that align with the Foundation’s strategic focus areas through our email intelfoundation@intel.com.\n\nNo, the Intel Foundation does not support or fund issues that are designed to influence elections, public policy, legislation, or government regulation. Please refer to \"Our Priorities\" to review our current areas of focus.\n\nThe Intel Foundation focuses primarily on the communities where Intel employees live and work, but also has the capacity to fund organizations in places where Intel Corporation does not operate.\n\nMatching grants from the Intel Foundation are based on the qualified financial giving (US only) and volunteer hours (global) of Intel employees. To be considered for eligibility, organizations must register and be vetted in the Benevity Causes portal.\n\nFunding for the Intel Foundation comes exclusively from charitable contributions made by Intel Corporation, but decisions regarding the use of funds once donated to the Foundation are made independently by the Foundation through its Board of Directors and Intel employees acting in their capacity as representatives of the Foundation. Intel also supports all operational expenses related to the Foundation, including donating the time of Intel employees who run the foundation. Except for some minor administrative costs, all funding received by the Intel Foundation is directed to philanthropic causes.\n\nThe Intel Foundation respects, values, and welcomes diversity as an asset in its board of directors, employees/retirees, and its grantee organizations in the global marketplace. Qualified organizations seeking financial support from the Intel Foundation will be required to verify that their program and services are offered without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, medical condition, genetic information, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law, regulation or ordinance."
