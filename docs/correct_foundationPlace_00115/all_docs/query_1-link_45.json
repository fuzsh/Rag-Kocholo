This museum is the world’s largest and most significant history museum for preserving and presenting the computing revolution and its impact on the human experience. Established in 1996, the Computer History Museum is home to the largest collection of computing artifacts in the world. This includes many rare or one-of-a-kind objects such as a Cray-1 supercomputer, the 1969 Neiman Marcus (Honeywell) Kitchen Computer, anApple I and an example of the first generation of Google‘s racks of custom-designed web servers. The collection comprises nearly 50,000 objects, photographs and films, as well as 4,000 linear feet of catalogued documentation and several hundred gigabytes of software.\n\nIn October 2002, the Museum acquired a landmark building at 1401 N. Shoreline Blvd in Mountain View, Calif. Constructed in 1994 for Silicon Graphics inc., the building has a post-modern look: glass and cement, angles and curves all come together in a sleek, asymmetrical design. A series of skylights across the ceiling, along with white exposed pipes and supporting beams throughout, give the building an open feeling.\n\nDriving Directions to the Computer History Museum\n\nFrom 85 N, Take the Shoreline Blvd. At the end of the ramp, turn right onto Shoreline Boulevard. 1401 Shoreline is on the SE corner of the intersection.
