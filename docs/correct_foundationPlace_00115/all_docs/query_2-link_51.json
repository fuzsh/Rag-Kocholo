(NYSE:SGI - News) said on Wednesday it was in talks to sell its Alias graphics technology and services business in a move to focus more closely on its core computing and storage business.\n\nSilicon Graphics, which makes high-end computers used by defense contractors and Hollywood studios, said it was in exclusive talks to sell Alias to an unnamed private equity investment firm. The terms of a possible deal were not disclosed.\n\nAlias, which provides 3D graphics technology and services for industries such as film, video, games, and industrial design, would operate as an independent company if the transaction was completed as expected, Silicon Graphics said.\n\nShedding Alias would continue the company’s strategy of narrowing its focus to products such as a computer based on the Intel Corp. (NasdaqNM:INTC - News) Itanium 2 microprocessor and running the increasingly popular Linux operating system.\n\nSales of Alias’ entire product line would continue and there would be no changes to the management team, service and support or product availability due to the negotiations or sale of the business, Silicon Graphics said.\n\nFor the second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 26, Alias had revenues of $18.4 million, compared with Silicon Graphic’s total revenues of $237.9 million.\n\nShares of Mountain View, California-based Silicon Graphics gained 40 cents, or 11.8 percent, to close at $3.80 on the New York Stock Exchange (News - Websites) on Wednesday.\n\nAccel-KKR To Acquire Alias From SGI\n\nAlias continues to pioneer innovative 3D software and services to entertainment and design customers\n\nMenlo Park, CA and Toronto, Ontario, April 15, 2004 – Accel-KKR and Alias®, a Silicon Graphics Inc.
