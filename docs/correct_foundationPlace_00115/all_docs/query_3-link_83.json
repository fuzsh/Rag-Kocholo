Additionally, Hillel SV staff is sought out by faculty at schools without a Hillel or Jewish student group to provide support when needed on campus.\n\nThe campuses our Hillel serves are largely commuter-based, and many of our students hold at least one part-time job. This means that Hillel SV provides a normative college experience for students who are not in situations where it is easy to connect with a college community."
