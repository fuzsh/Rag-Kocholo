The deal comes shortly after SGI filed for bankruptcy in the US, after delisting from the NASDAQ stock exchange last month.\n\nRobert Ewald, SGI chief executive, commented: “This transaction represents a compelling opportunity for SGI’s customers, partners and employees, who can all benefit from the emerging stronger company with better technologies, products and market reach.”\n\nRackable reported a decrease in revenues of 29 per cent to $247.4 million (£168.9 million) in the fiscal year 2008."
