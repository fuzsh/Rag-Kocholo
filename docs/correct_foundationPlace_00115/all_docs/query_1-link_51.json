        "text": "James H. Clark â€” co-founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape\n\nJames H. Clark is an entrepreneur and computer scientist who was a founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon, myCFO and Shutterfly.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1984, he was an associate professor of electrical engineering at Stanford, where he developed the Geometry Engine, an early hardware accelerator for rendering computer images based on geometric models. That technology was the basis for early products by Silicon Graphics, which revolutionized the design process for everything from bridges and airplanes to special effects for movies.\n\nIn 1994, Clark joined Marc Andreessen (lead developer of Mosaic, one of the first web browsers) to form Netscape. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans."
