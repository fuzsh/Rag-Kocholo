        "text": "Twenty years ago, author David Kaplan’s comment that “Silicon Valley doesn’t care much for its history” inspired me to seek out places where modern day alchemists (scientists and engineers) learned how to turn sand (silicon) into gold (computer chips). That venture, my first into Silicon Valley tourism, yielded the idea of a high-tech heritage trail exploring places that housed the early stirrings of the digital revolution.\n\nI recently retraced that route. Many buildings that housed tech pioneers have been razed, rebuilt and razed again over the past 20 years. Two of the most significant losses are the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in Mountain View and IBM Building 25 in south San Jose. While both are commemorated with plaques and monuments, it appears that Mr. Kaplan’s call for preserving the artifacts of tech history remains low on the priority list for a community focused on the never-ending search for the next big thing.\n\nFor those who do care about tech history, the following itinerary connects some of the key sites and buildings in the…"
