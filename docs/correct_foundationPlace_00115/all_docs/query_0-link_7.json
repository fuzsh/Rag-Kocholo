        "text": "The SCP Foundation deals with a wide range of different anomalies; as such, the operation of many different specialized facilities across the world is necessary for containment. These facilities have to specialize to suit the requirements of their specific task, while still having their true purpose hidden from the public as part of the Veil.\n\nThe terms “Site” and “Area” aren’t interchangeable.\n\nSites are covert Foundation facilities that often exist relatively close to civilian populations. So as not to arouse suspicion from the public or rival groups, they disguise themselves as government and corporate buildings.\n\nAreas typically have to contain much more dangerous anomalies; they tend to not only be much larger than Sites, but they’re also further away from civilian population centers. Additionally, they are also entirely hidden from the public, preventing passersby from stumbling across what they should not see.\n\nBoth types of facilities are divided into Sections or Sectors, which in some cases are further divided into Units. Units, typically, are small, high-security areas devoted to the extensive containment of a single anomaly, or several closely related anomalies.\n\nPrefixes\n\nDescribes how a Foundation Site or Area has specialized. These are not exclusive, as a facility could have one or more prefixes attached to them.\n\nArmed\n\nEx. Armed Site, Armed Area, or Armed Section\n\nA facility or section that possesses a large quantity of firepower, and could mean military grade weaponry, vehicles, or just many permanent armed guards. Armed facilities tend to be more dangerous to work in, either due to a greater threat of containment breach or due to the high possibility of attacks from the outside.\n\nBiological\n\nThe facility or area deals with infectious or biohazardous anomalies.\n\nContainment\n\nThese sites or areas that are built for containing anomalies.\n\nDimensional\n\nDimensional containment facilities or sections often contain dangerous pocket dimensions or gateways into other dimensions.\n\nHumanoid\n\nHumanoid containment facilities or sections deal largely with intelligent human or human-like anomalies capable of understanding and following instructions. They’re similar to standard prisons, but for anomalous people.\n\nProtected\n\nProtected facilities and sections are anomaly-free safe zones. This does not mean there are zero anomalies at the facility, but any being contained or used by the Foundation are harmless, mostly harmless, or outright beneficial.\n\nProvisional\n\nProvisional facilities are typically temporary facilities built around an anomaly that couldn’t be feasibly transported to a pre-existing facility.\n\nReliquary\n\nReliquary facilities or sections are designed to hold anomalous artifacts of a religious or historical nature.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch facilities or sections either research the anomalies themselves or work on devising new containment methods\n\nStorage\n\nStorage facilities are designed to store non-anomalous items long-term.\n\nSites\n\nStandard Sites\n\nProtected Site-θ - Located underneath Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.\n\nSite-00-00-00 - Located in the Temple of the Night in SCP-4840.\n\nNULL-Site-0 - Facility doesn't exist; hosts the Department of Unreality which researches Unreality.\n\nProtected Site-01 - Location varies; generally remote and far from civilization.\n\nSite-06 (04/23/87) - Located in southern India in the universe of 04/23/87.\n\nHumanoid Containment Site-06-3 - Located in Lorraine, Grand Est, France.\n\nSite-5 (SCP-4182) - Located 75 km (46.6 miles) south of Ipponsugi, Japan.
