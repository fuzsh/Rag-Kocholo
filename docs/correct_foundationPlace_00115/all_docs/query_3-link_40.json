        "text": "Silicon Graphics\n\n(NYSE: SGI ) today announced that NASA has chosen SGI(R) Altix(R) as the\n\nfoundation of Project Columbia, an extensive collaboration with SGI and Intel\n\nCorporation that is expected to fuel scientific breakthroughs in space\n\nexploration, global warming research, and aerospace engineering. With Project\n\nColumbia, NASA plans to integrate a total of twenty 512-processor SGI(R)\n\nAltix(R) systems with a 500-terabyte SGI(R) InfiniteStorage solution to create\n\nthe Space Exploration Simulator, which will be among the world’s largest\n\nLinux(R) OS-based supercomputers. Powered by a total of 10,240 Intel(R)\n\nItanium(R) 2 processors, the Space Exploration Simulator will equip NASA\n\nscientists with one of the most sophisticated and capable supercomputers in\n\nhistory.\n\n“For over 20 years NASA and SGI have worked very closely and very\n\nsuccessfully to deliver a series of technological firsts,” said G. Scott\n\nHubbard, NASA Ames Director. “Project Columbia will build on the knowledge we\n\ngained from this close relationship to underpin the most ambitious missions in\n\nNASA’s history. As we set our sights to the Vision for Space Exploration, we\n\nlook forward to making the journey with SGI and Intel.”\n\n“Now more than ever, NASA’s efforts are crucial to understanding our place\n\nin the universe and our destiny on this planet,” said Bob Bishop, chairman and\n\nCEO of SGI. “We are truly honored to have Altix chosen as the compute platform\n\nfor NASA’s next big step forward.”\n\n“The exploration of the universe remains one of man’s greatest\n\nchallenges,” said Intel Chief Executive Officer Craig Barrett. “The ‘Project\n\nColumbia’ supercomputer designed by NASA, SGI and Intel will enable the\n\nworld’s brightest designers and scientists to look a little deeper and reach a\n\nlittle farther in their understanding of, and achievements in, space.”\n\nBy boosting its computing capacity ten-fold through Project Columbia, the\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Facility (NAS) will be able to more effectively\n\nhandle such critical projects as simulating future space missions, projecting\n\nthe impact of human activity on weather patterns, and designing safe and\n\nefficient space exploration vehicles and aircraft. The present collaboration\n\nbuilds upon the highly successful 8-year partnership that last year developed\n\nthe world’s first 512-processor Linux server — based on standard, “off-the-\n\nshelf” microprocessor and open source technology — the SGI Altix at NASA Ames\n\nResearch Center named ‘Kalpana’ after Columbia astronaut and Ames alumna\n\nKalpana Chawla.\n\nHoused at Ames Research Center in the heart of California’s Silicon\n\nValley, the Space Exploration Simulator will rely heavily on the open\n\nstandards-based Altix system’s unique globally addressable memory\n\narchitecture, which allows complex data sets to be driven entirely out of\n\nmemory, enabling productivity breakthroughs that conventional commodity\n\nclusters or proprietary UNIX(R) servers can’t achieve.\n\n“As NASA pushes the boundaries of space exploration through the solar\n\nsystem and beyond, simulation will play a role of increasing importance,” said\n\nAddison Snell, research director, High-Performance Computing, IDC. “NASA\n\nscientists using the computer system from SGI with Intel processors will\n\nexpand our understanding of the complexities of manned and unmanned space\n\nexploration. The installation of the Space Exploration Simulator is a\n\nsignificant achievement for NASA, SGI, and Intel, and beyond that, it is a\n\nmajor step forward for the United States.”\n\nSGI has already delivered the first three of the new Altix systems to NASA\n\nAmes, with the entire 10,240 Itanium 2 processor-based supercomputing array to\n\nbe completed over the next several months. In response to a May task force\n\nrecommendation by Office of Science and Technology Policy, NASA will make a\n\nportion of the Space Exploration Simulator broadly available to ensure that\n\nthe entire U.S. science and engineering community has access to the nation’s\n\nmost advanced supercomputer architectures.\n\nThe Altix architecture also will provide easy installation and\n\nadministration of the Space Exploration Simulator. “Aside from introducing new\n\nsupercomputing capabilities and performance levels,” added John Parks, Deputy\n\nChief of the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division, “we expect the\n\nSpace Exploration Simulator to initiate a new era in high-performance\n\ncomputing — one in which operating a 10,000 processor-supercomputer may be as\n\nstraightforward as managing twenty workstations.”\n\nThe SGI Altix family leverages the built-in SGI(R) NUMAlink(TM)\n\ninterconnect fabric, which allows global addressing of all memory in the\n\nsystem and delivers data across nodes up to 200 times faster than conventional\n\ninterconnects. Altix systems feature a fully supported, LBS (Linux Standard\n\nBased) 64-bit Linux operating system and advanced development environment\n\nspecifically optimized for technical applications. SGI Altix has consistently\n\nset records for sheer performance — including breaking the 1 terabyte/second\n\nbarrier on the STREAMS Triad benchmark, an industry standard measurement of\n\nmemory bandwidth — and for its ability to efficiently run manufacturing,\n\nengineering and scientific applications across hundreds of processors in a\n\nLinux operating environment.\n\nNASA and SGI are also working to expand the Altix system architecture to\n\nsupport globally addressable memory across 2,048 processors in a single\n\nsystem. Such an effort will enable NASA to push the envelope of scientific\n\ndiscovery because a supercomputer with a single pool of shared memory will run\n\nmany scientific applications significantly faster than a cluster of small\n\nsystems whose memory is fragmented and distributed across an interconnect\n\nfabric.\n\nUsers accessing the new system will need to share current and historic\n\ndata, and are expected to generate new data at a rate of multiple terabytes\n\nper day. In order to keep the system’s massive compute capacity efficiently\n\nutilized, it will draw data from a 500 Terabyte SGI InfiniteStorage storage\n\narea network (SAN) and leverage a further 800 terabytes of existing data\n\nmanaged by SGI’s InfiniteStorage data lifecycle management solution — Data\n\nMigration Facility (DMF). To get the best possible performance and utilization\n\nout of the SAN, SGI InfiniteStorage shared filesystem, CXFS(TM) will provide\n\nall applications on the SAN instant access to all data without the cost,\n\ncomplexity and wait time of traditional data sharing methods. To store data\n\nthat needs to be retained over longer periods of time, the disk-based SAN will\n\nbe augmented with the DMF-based data lifecycle management environment which\n\ndelivers faster performance than archive alternatives, but which costs\n\nsignificantly less than disk.\n\nIn addition to Intel Itanium 2 processors, the Project Columbia systems\n\nfeatures storage technology from Brocade Communications and Engenio\n\nInformation Technologies, Inc., memory technology from Dataram Corporation and\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. and interconnect technology from Voltaire.\n\nAvailability\n\nSGI(R) Altix(R) 3000 systems are available today in shared memory\n\nconfigurations of 4 to 1,024 Itanium 2 processors, with many deployed systems\n\nof 256 and 512 processors. SGI InfiniteStorage solutions enables customers to\n\naddress their data-intensive enterprise needs while providing scalable\n\ncapacity, management and performance in a cost-effective architecture.\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements regarding SGI\n\ntechnologies and third-party technologies that are subject to risks and\n\nuncertainties.
