        "text": "By Grant Stoner\n\nEmployment is a crucial aspect of the human experience. From a young age, people attend schools to train specific skills, work jobs to bolster their knowledge, and spend years hoping to establish savings for retirement. Yet, for many, the need to work and seek employment does not end in your 50s or 60s. In fact, for some, it’s only the beginning.\n\nEasterseals Oregon understands the importance of helping individuals find employment opportunities. Through the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), Easterseals, in conjunction with the state of Oregon, assists those 55 and over within 34 of the 36 counties to develop necessary skills that allow them to either return to the workforce or enter it for the first time. Speaking with Easterseals, Kathryn Gerhards, Director of Employment Services at Easterseals Oregon, explores the importance of SCSEP, what services enrolled members can access, and even some personal stories from staff and former members.\n\nWhy SCSEP Matters\n\nDespite the existence of state and federal programs like Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, older Americans may lack the appropriate funds for necessities like housing, food, and clothing. Further, with an increase in the evolution of technology and digital services, many older adults struggle to even enter the workforce at all. Gerhards explains the role of SCSEP, noting that not only does it provide employment, but also teaches them how to thrive in the digital age.\n\n“Through SCSEP, participants are placed in internship programs in their county,” Gerhards said. “These internships are hosted by non-profits and federally funded programs. While placed, participants receive coaching and supervision to gain skills that they can use towards employment. During their placement participants work on things like computer comfortability, soft skills, time management, etc. while in a supportive environment. This allows them current experience to add to their resume and gives them a current reference while job seeking.”\n\nAside from providing technical skills, SCSEP gives members a vital tool regardless of occupation – confidence. Being able to comfortably and confidently enter a new position is beneficial, especially for seniors that not only understand their desired role, but how to navigate the modern era. SCSEP teaches members to embrace modernity which is vital for any job.\n\n“Almost more importantly, these placements also allow job seekers to be and provide value to their internship program,” Gerhards said. “This increases their confidence and gives them a place to belong. This program is funded by the Department of Labor. This funding allows participants to receive a stipend for every hour that they train. This stipend provides more financial breathing room while they job seek, which gets them back on their feet while they work towards securing unsubsidized employment.”\n\nCrucial Services\n\nSince its establishment, Easterseals Oregon has assisted thousands of mature job seekers through SCSEP. Gerhards explains that every year, approximately 500 individuals are serviced throughout the state of Oregon. And since SCSEP is a national program, members can move to a different state and continue to receive services. For a total of four years, participants can access a bevy of tools through numerous workshops and partnering organizations that ultimately bring them into the workforce.\n\n“SCSEP participants engage in platforms like GetSetUP and IBMSkillsBuild,” Gerhards said. “We also offer financial literacy through Chase Bank. Through our Business Advisory Committee (BAC), participants also get resume reviews, have access to resume templates, and more. We also are co-located with Worksourses (OneStops) around the state that give them access to local programs like STEP that provide additional support.”\n\nInternships and partnered assistance are not the only forms of assistance available to older adults. Gerhards explains that throughout the entire four-year process, Easterseals Oregon continuously works with each member to refine their skills and help them find employment. “While not at their internship placement, participants also receive support from ESO staff through resume coaching, access to training, job leads, support services and more while they travel their SCSEP journey.”\n\nSuccess Stories\n\nFor each individual enrolled within SCSEP, there are countless stories of success, both with seeking employment, as well as finding a sense of purpose and community. Through the four-year program, mature workers are consistently entering the workforce to once again receive livable wages. One example proves that even at the age of 81, you can still find joy in your work.\n\n“The SCSEP program enrolled me at a point in my life where I was close to being unemployable due to my age and years of looking after my mother rather than continuing as an Insurance Agent,” a SCSEP participant said. “This worked out so well that I was hired by ESO-SCSEP in 2017 as a Data Entry Specialist and Program Assistant. This has given me an increase in salary and the satisfaction in knowing that my efforts are constructively helping older people participate in the economy and realize improved lifestyles. Now at 81, I enjoy the things I do to make SCSEP a viable organization and assist so many elders to actively live healthy and worthwhile lives.”\n\nAs mentioned before, SCSEP helps to establish confidence after tragic moments in an individual’s life. For many people, reentering the workforce can be a traumatic experience, especially after, in some cases, needing to completely rebuild — like one participant at Easterseals Oregon.\n\n“The participant who after a life-long career in catering, lost everything after a traumatic injury,” a member of Easterseals Oregon said. “Her house, her business, and in her own words, ‘her entire sense of self.’ Within three months, she is housed and training at a food bank, writing grants, creating recipes based on available food donations, and facilitating inter-agency collaborations to improve food security for Benton County.”\n\nFor participants and employees within Easterseals Oregon’s SCSEP, providing a second chance is an invaluable resource for so many individuals. Whether it’s personal moments or nationwide traumatic events like the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone deserves help during their time of need. And for one Easterseals employee, providing mature workers with the confidence to rebuild is a powerful experience.\n\n“We are assisting people not only with reaching sustainable employment, but we are also helping them navigate a world that has become dismissive of their lived experiences, technologically complicated, and often feels overwhelming,” they said. “We remind them of their value. We guide them on how to reconnect with their capabilities. We introduce them to the tools they can use to learn new skills, and the impact is exponential when they start believing in themselves.”\n\nLearn more about Easterseals Oregon’s SCSEP by visiting their website.\n\nJane, an Easterseals supporter, hadn’t updated her will in 15 years. She told the Easterseals Planned Giving team that her intention was to include a bequest to benefit Easterseals.\n\nAs they talked, Jane learned there’s an Easterseals center just two miles from her home. Retired after teaching special education for 35 years, she was looking to volunteer in the community.\n\nEasterseals’ Planned Giving team connected her, and it’s been a perfect fit ever since. “I felt like I was family from the day I walked in the door,” she said.\n\nIn the summer, Jane helps with the Easterseals camp program, and during the school year, she volunteers in the early intervention program. “I so believe in early intervention,” she said. “I wish every child in the world had access to it.”\n\nPlanning giving involves making charitable donations as part of an individual’s overall financial and estate plan, usually through planned gifts such as bequests in a will, charitable remainder trusts, or charitable gift annuities.\n\n“It feels so good to finally have everything in place,” explains Jane. “Including Easterseals in my plans was the right thing to do. My life is wonderful, and being at Easterseals fills me with joy.”\n\nSome things are difficult to talk about, or even think about. What happens to your estate once you pass on is something many of us want to ignore for as long as possible. But making plans to update your will now can create a legacy, supporting causes or organizations like Easterseals that are important to you. That is what planned giving is all about.\n\nSetting up a will and managing planned giving can sound complicated or overwhelming, but we’ve provided information below to dispel misconceptions and offer definitions to guide your plans.\n\nCommon Terms in Planned Giving\n\nEstate Plan – Your plan for how and where you want your assets (money, belongings, home, etc.) to be distributed and managed after you’re gone.\n\nBequest – A bequest is a gift made as part of your estate plan that can be given to a person, trust, or organization. Bequests can be a fixed amount of money or specific property, such as real estate, stocks, bonds, or art. They can be used to support causes (like Easterseals) that are important to you and your family.\n\nCharitable Remainder Trust – A Charitable Remainder Trust or CRT is a gift of cash or other assets that generates income for the donor or other beneficiaries, while the remaining assets are given to charities.\n\nCharitable Gift Annuity – A Charitable Gift Annuity or CGA is a contract between a donor and a charity that provides the donor with a fixed-income stream for life in exchange for a sizeable gift to the charity (minimum $10,000).\n\nExecutor – The person named in your will to settle your estate once you’re gone\n\nTrustee – The person named in a trust to manage trust investments for your beneficiaries\n\nCharitable bequest – A charitable gift left by will or living trust\n\nCharitable remainder trust – A trust that gives your chosen beneficiaries income for life or a term of years, with the remaining balance going to charitable organizations you designate, like Easterseals.\n\nCommon Myths\n\nMyth: Planned gifts are complicated and confusing.\n\nTruth: There are many types of planned gifts—most are simple and affordable, like a gift in your will or trust. You just need to find the one that best fulfills your goals.\n\nMyth: My estate has to be large to make an impact.\n\nTruth: By including charities like Easterseals in your estate plan for any amount, you make a lasting impact and a tremendous difference. One option is to leave a residual amount.\n\nMyth: I’m too young to think about making a will.\n\nTruth: Planning your estate is an important step at any stage of your life. A simple meeting with an attorney or financial advisor can help you ensure that your intentions are carried out.\n\nMyth: Charitable giving’s main benefit is to reduce your tax burden.\n\nTruth: Different assets can have significantly different tax implications on your estate. Your advisor can be a valuable partner for you in determining your strategy. But, more important, giving can be the start of many good things.\n\nIf you would like more information, we invite you to visit the Easterseals Charitable Giving website which provides free resources to plan and create your will.\n\nBy Andrea Jennings\n\nThe Importance of Disability Education\n\nDisability education in classrooms is crucial for shaping a more inclusive and understanding society. I am ambulatory and use different mobility aids. However, after sustaining my disability in a motor vehicle accident, as a wheelchair user, and as a parent, I could not even attend my daughter’s open house because of inaccessibility. I have firsthand experience with the barriers and misconceptions surrounding disabilities. Educating students about disabilities can break down these barriers, fostering empathy and acceptance from a young age. Integrating disability education helps create environments where all students feel valued and understood.\n\nIn my journey of writing a children’s book and a short script about disability, I’ve discovered that many children hesitate to ask questions about disabilities due to outdated guidance from their parents. This hesitation often stems from a fear of offending or saying the wrong thing. However, open dialogue and education can dispel myths and build a foundation of respect and curiosity. By addressing these fears head-on, educators can create a safe space for students to learn and grow.\n\nInclusive education is not just about physical accessibility; it’s about changing mindsets and attitudes. By incorporating lessons about disabilities into the curriculum, we can disrupt tropes and stereotypes and advocate for a culture of authentic disability inclusion. This approach benefits all students, as it teaches them to appreciate diversity and develop a deeper understanding of the experiences of others.\n\nStrategies for Integrating Disability Education\n\nEducators need practical strategies and resources to integrate disability education in classrooms successfully. Universal Design for Learning is a great example that emphasizes the need for different modalities for students to process information and demonstrate what they have retained. This approach accommodates various learning styles and abilities, setting students up for success.\n\nOne practical strategy is incorporating stories and materials featuring characters with disabilities. Books, films, and guest speakers with lived experiences sharing personal experiences can be powerful tools for sparking discussions and encouraging students to ask questions and share their thoughts. Patricia Herrera, M.S., Regional Manager for the State Council on Developmental Disabilities, emphasizes, “Inclusion that is well done correctly in education is the best route. When teachers are appropriately trained and supported for the curriculum, it makes a difference for everyone.”\n\nSetting teachers up for success by providing training and support is essential. Professional development workshops, access to educational resources, and collaboration with disability advocacy organizations equip teachers with the knowledge and tools to deliver disability education meaningfully and impactfully. Casey Jaguash, Professor of Teacher Education at Pasadena City College, asserts, “Every child has the innate ability to succeed in school. We must recognize and work to dismantle the barriers in the school environment that keep students from thriving; that is how we create safe and equitable spaces for all children to learn, grow, and flourish.”\n\nDisrupting Common Misconceptions: Shifting Paradigms\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in disability education is overcoming common misconceptions and stereotypes. Many people hold outdated beliefs about disabilities, which can lead to prejudice and discrimination. By addressing these misconceptions directly, educators can help students develop a more accurate and respectful understanding of disabilities.\n\nIt’s important to dispel the notion that people with disabilities are defined solely by their limitations. Instead, we should emphasize their strengths and talents, recognizing that society and lack of education often present barriers, not disability. Highlighting the achievements of individuals with disabilities in various fields can motivate students and challenge their preconceived notions. Additionally, educators should encourage open discussions about disability and psychologically safe spaces for students. By creating a supportive environment where curiosity is welcomed, we can help students develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of diversity.\n\nSpeaking about attitudinal barriers, Kathryn Taylor Smith, an actor, producer, and activist, shared her perspective as a parent of a child with a disability: “Parents think that this is contagious. How about we use this as an opportunity to teach some compassion? Your child can learn as much from my child as my child can learn from yours. It’s the mindset about how teachers treat the children. There should be a way for teachers to be trained for people with language or physical delays.” Kathryn also highlights the need for systemic support, stating, “I give teachers grace and feel that the system should work on integrating with inclusion,” but also notes the red tape parents face in securing necessary services for their children.\n\nPractical Steps for Creating an Inclusive Classroom\n\nCreating a human-centered, inclusive classroom that prioritizes access for all involves thoughtful planning and implementing practical strategies. Classroom layout is a critical first step. Ensure that classrooms, labs, and workspaces are accessible to students using mobility aids. Seating arrangements should provide clear sightlines for all students and accommodate assistive technologies without segregating accessible seating.\n\nLearning design should incorporate multiple instructional methods to cater to various learning styles. Deliver course requirements and assignments clearly and in multiple formats—oral, printed, and electronic. Use a mix of lectures, small group discussions, visual aids, and hands-on activities. Provide a grading rubric in advance and minimize time constraints unless essential to the learning outcome. Announce assignments and due dates well in advance and offer ways for students to demonstrate their knowledge.\n\nEffective communication is vital. Use a microphone to ensure everyone can hear, repeat student questions into the microphone, and practice speaking slowly and clearly. Face students when speaking and provide accessible materials, such as large-font slides, and sufficient time for note-taking. Invite students to discuss accommodations and learning needs, fostering an environment of openness and support. These tools and support were very useful while completing my master’s degree.\n\nCourse materials should be accessible to all learners. Provide handouts and textbooks in accessible formats and ensure course websites are fully accessible. Offer transcripts for audio files and accurate captions for videos. Utilize tools like Canvas’s Ally to identify and address accessibility issues in online content.\n\nSpeaking with Valerie Stuski, Associate Professor, Design Strategist, and Accessibility and Disability Commissioner, she shared this with me: “All too often, schools are unaware or hesitant to answer simple accessibility questions – is your school accessible? Does your elevator work? Or people can’t find keys to (accessible) back doors or lifts. It’s critical for all faculty and staff to train in accessibility and disability fundamentals. After touring 15 schools, only 2 of those have ever felt welcoming, and it wasn’t because they had all the answers or a brand new facility; it was because they understood inclusion and met us where we were, not where they thought we should be.”\n\nBy implementing these strategies, educators can create a classroom environment that supports all students, promotes inclusivity, and fosters a deeper understanding and human-centered approach for all. This approach not only benefits students with disabilities but enriches everyone’s learning experience, paving the way for a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nAndrea Jennings, M.Mus., Series TV Host for Access for All: Integrating Accessibility is a Disability & Accessibility in Media Strategist, Director, and Actress.

The Empowering You 2024 Mentorship Retreat featured activities and events like workshops emphasizing community building, handcrafted art, games, and several guest speakers. For disabled individuals living in Massachusetts, this annual event encouraged embracing your disabled identity, building support throughout your community, and, more importantly, the capability to confidently and comfortably empower oneself.\n\nEmpowering You is the culmination of efforts from Easterseals Massachusetts’ mentorship programs Thrive and Brothers Against Discrimination (B.A.D). While Thrive is specifically for disabled young women, and B.A.D for young men, both groups seek to help disabled members promote and advocate for themselves as confident disabled members of society. I spoke with Easterseals Massachusetts Youth Program Manager, Desi Forte, who explored this year’s mentorship retreat theme and its varying activities, the importance of accommodating numerous disabilities, and her hopes for the future.\n\nWhat Is Empowering You?\n\nConfidence and self-worth are important tools for any individual. Yet, for disabled people that may struggle to feel welcome in a society that can still pose numerous inaccessible barriers, as well as general notions of ableism, empowerment is crucial for daily living. While Thrive and B.A.D regularly develop programs to create and refine self-help skills, Forte explains it was important to have the annual retreat focus on the overall theme of empowerment.\n\n“The focus of the program was really around empowering people with disabilities by creating these communities,” Forte said. “With the theme of Empowering You, we were trying to find an all-encompassing theme that was broad in terms of scope of what we could cover. Really emphasizing the point around empowerment because that’s what these programs were built to do.”\n\nThe annual mentorship retreat took place over a weekend to allow attendees time to engage with activities. Forte notes that the Friday and Saturday were primarily reserved for members of B.A.D, while Thrive members met on Saturday and Sunday, with intentional overlap on Saturday for both groups to connect with one another. Forte explains that approximately 18 attendees within each program stayed for the event, with ages ranging from 15 to adults in their 50s. Yet, despite the vast differences in age, the event provided activities for all to enjoy.\n\n“There were activities around the theme of empowerment,” she said. “There was an art activity where individuals created prints just showing what empowerment means to them. There were speakers around leadership within the disability community and beyond, and how they can be leaders in their lives. There was a lot of structured down-time as a way for these community members to connect with one another to build organic mentoring and empowering relationships from the different generational communities being able to connect with one another.”\n\nEmpowering Through Care\n\nEach annual mentorship retreat brings attendees to new locations, and Empowering You was no different. Hosted at Bridgewater State University, members and volunteers were given access to the facilities of the college campus, including residential halls. While this was a great way to directly bring disabled individuals into local communities, it also provided its own logistical challenges.\n\nFor many disabled people, traveling, and especially staying overnight, can be a complex process. From transferring medical equipment to extensive care regimes, many disabled individuals do not have the luxury to temporarily bring their care to other areas. Thankfully, Forte notes that the event was able to comfortably and successfully accommodate everyone.\n\n“One of the strongest positive outcomes we always see, is that because this was an overnight event, we were able to support [Personal Care Assistant] needs if that’s something participants need to be involved,” she said. “[We also provide] other needs they may have that may be a barrier for them to participate in other overnight events. Just getting a chance to be overnight, away from their everyday environment, is always a strong part of this program.”\n\nSome attendees, as Forte explains, are experiencing their first overnight event. And for others, these retreats are something to look forward to annually, allowing disabled individuals to connect with peers, as well as comfortably and confidently spend significant time away from their home environment. Forte notes that one of the most common pieces of feedback after each event is the joy with being able to stay overnight. “The feedback that we’ve gotten many, many times, and this year especially, is just being able to be in the space is something that those involved don’t get the opportunity to do very often.”\n\nMoving Forward\n\nEmpowering You was not the only event available this year. Forte notes that Easterseals Massachusetts consistently offers numerous events and retreats, both virtually and physically, for disabled attendees and mentors alike. For disabled individuals, these create opportunities to build not only self-confidence, but a sense of community, something crucial for marginalized groups like disabled people. And as each event draws to a close, Forte is hopeful that they will continue with new themes and places.\n\n“The hopes for future events are to just keep them going and to keep them growing,” she said. “To be able to keep doing these and offering these opportunities. The only concerns are always around funding and making sure that that’s available to support these programs, and to support these opportunities.”\n\nEmpowering You more than embraced its theme. The intersections of different mentorship groups, community building, and creating necessary tools to empower oneself were felt across the college campus. For disabled individuals, finding a sense of belonging internally, as well as through a community, are crucial components of long-term care. Without community, disabled people may struggle to engage within a traditionally nondisabled society. And while these events continue, self-empowerment and connecting with others will provide even more opportunities for disabled individuals to develop a sense of belonging. And as Forte explains, these retreats and events are integral to the disabled community.\n\n“As a person with a disability myself, I completely understand firsthand what being involved in these programs means,” she said. “And really, what it means for me to be able to give back to this community that means so much to me.”\n\nTo learn more about Easterseals Massachusetts, please visit their website.\n\nBy Christina Gann\n\nThe first time I ever encountered a queer narrative in a video game was The Last of Us in 2013. The main game was released in June during LGBTQIA Pride month but did not include an openly queer narrative released in the main story playthrough. It was a prequel, an add-on character story that you needed to purchase separately after the release of the main game. When I started up that game, I had no idea that the story they were going to include for the main character Ellie William would have such a profound impact on me. The story took you on a heartfelt journey with Ellie’s best friend Riley that concluded with Ellie’s first kiss … and she kissed *gasp* Riley?! … another girl!\n\nI was over the moon. I couldn’t hold back my tears and felt a sense of connection to this story and to the world around me in that instance. I cried because I felt validated and connected to this storytelling even if I had never experienced a queer teen romance of my own. Ellie was me. Teen romances are universal, a part of the human experience. To look for companionship and emotional security in another person is an experience that surpasses color, sexuality, ability and telling stories that include these universal experiences with diversity and inclusion weaves a tapestry interconnecting us as humans.\n\nAs rare as the queer perspective is in video games, good representation of people with disabilities is even rarer. Rich, diverse stories of characters with disabilities are desperately needed in mainstream media. Accurate representation is key to destroying limiting beliefs about the lives of people with disabilities. Stereotypes and false beliefs created by misrepresentation give a false impression of what it’s like to live in the world with a disability, creating disconnect and isolation. Disability is still regularly served up as a trope to invoke fear in the horror genre in both video games and cinema. Sending a message that disabled people should invoke fear instead of celebrating the life of the individual and the way they approach the world in different ways. This needs to be replaced with characters and stories that resonate differences to be celebrated.\n\nWhen I was a young adult, my family and I would go to medical conventions to learn new information and technologies that could help accommodate my needs while living with short gut syndrome. Short gut syndrome is so rare that these conventions were the only way that I ever got to see or meet other people who lived a similar experience to my own. I felt included, accepted and understood more there than anywhere else. Meeting all these young people like me who had the same challenges, the same desires, same hopes made me see that it was all possible if I was allowed to exist without the constraints and limitations put on me.\n\nSeeing representation of yourself is healing, especially when you exist outside the boundaries of the status quo. To be able to relate and identify with the rest of the world is profoundly interconnecting. Everyone wants to feel seen, everyone thirsts to be understood and accepted as they are. When we tell stories with accurate representation, we create an understanding, and through understanding, we create unity. The stories we tell, the way in which we represent ourselves to each other is so vital to the way in which we relate to each other face to face.\n\nWe believe what we see and this becomes our reality. I was taught at a very young age that being different meant danger. That being disabled meant that you were limited in what was possible. That accepting disability meant accepting defeat. I grew up as a witness to a world that mistreated, misrepresented and abandoned the disabled. I struggled to relate what I saw to how I felt growing up disabled. I didn’t feel like I was limited but that the world was not made for people like me. I remember going into my school counselor’s office and being told what I was capable of achieving. What was possible and what was not going to happen for me given the limitations she created for me out of assumptions fueled by societal views. I was force fed my limitations on a platter with no exceptions. Without allowing me to determine my path and how I would approach life in my own unique way. Without giving me a chance to thrive.\n\nI went on to dismantle every limit put in front of me. I have done things I was told were impossible.\n\nSomeone told my story, someone else limited my potential and capabilities without my permission. No one should have their story stolen or misrepresented. Misrepresentation creates false images and harmful stereotypes of people and their lived experiences. We are still fighting for accurate representation at the intersection of queer and disabled. To have a hand in telling our own stories is vital to diverse and suitable representation that changes how we are viewed and treated in the world.\n\nWhen we leave room for all stories to be told, we open the door to alternate reality, one that aligns with our humanity, compassion and understanding. No one should have their story or their potential snatched away. We all deserve the chance to thrive and live out loud and proud of all that makes us who we are. Diversity, accurate representation and inclusion bridges the gap between what we think we know about each other and what connects us to each other, including us all in the conversation.\n\nAdvocacy makes our stories and existence visible and we are infused back into the pack as one community supporting one another through our individual experiences. When you are ready, tell your story as loudly as you can because I assure you, someone out there needs it so that they can have the courage to tell their own.\n\nChristina Gann is a content creator, artist, and scientist based in Colorado.
