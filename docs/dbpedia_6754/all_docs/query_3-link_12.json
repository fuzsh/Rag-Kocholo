External Conflict\n\nDefinition\n\nExternal conflict denotes a struggle between a character and an external entity, whether it be another character, nature, society, or an abstract concept like fate.\n\nExample\n\nIn Henrik Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House,” Nora Helmer grapples with an external conflict against the stifling societal norms of 19th-century Norway. Nora’s decision to forge her father’s signature to save her husband, Torvald, imposes upon her a life within the constrained gender roles and expectations of her society. The external conflict reaches its zenith when Nora decides to leave her family, a radical act that defies the conventional social structures of her time. Nora’s conflict, therefore, is not just with her husband but with the societal norms that prescribe her roles as a wife and mother."
