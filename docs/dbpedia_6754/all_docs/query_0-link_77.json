        "text": "Dear Friends,\n\nI’m so excited to come to New York in February with Trouble! It was named in The New Yorker this week!! And YES I’m coming to town for it! So I hope to see you there.\n\nFEB 19 NEW YORK\n\nTrouble will be screening Brooklyn Academy of Music (click for tickets). It is part of a series called True To Life curated by Triple Canopy. (More info here). I’ll be there in person!\n\nREDCAT Jan 25 8pm PST\n\nTrouble is opening REDCAT’s Spring Season! Followed by a live Q+A.\n\nTickets available here\n\nAvailable in the US only.\n\nDocument Film Festival Jan 25-31\n\nTrouble will be streaming for the duration of the festival with a Live Q+A on January 27 at 7:30pm GMT.\n\nTickets available here\n\nAvailable in the UK only.\n\nQueerTactics Austrian Premiere Jan 31\n\nThis is an IN PERSON screening (which I will not be at because American’s aren’t allowed to go to Austria) at the Admiralkino in Vienna.\n\nTickets available here\n\nTrouble begins in Vienna, with the filmmaker meeting her father, David, whom she hasn’t seen since she was two years old. She surprises him by showing him a BBC documentary that was made in 1971 about his teenage interfaith romance with a Catholic girl. They are cast as star-crossed lovers in a portrayal riddled with inaccuracies that led to threats of violence from both sides and his eventual flight from Ireland. After it aired, he cut all ties with friends and family and has never returned. The film then travels to Northern Ireland and segues into an impossible reconstruction of David’s early years in Belfast. In David’s absence, Garnett uses previously recorded audio interviews to skillfully craft a lip-synced, cross-gender performance where she impersonates the youthful presence of her father and casts a transgender actress, Robyn Reihill, in the role of his girlfriend. The film cycles through various camera modes to create a fragmented account of a teenager struggling to find an identity in a rapidly deteriorating society. The layers of texture in this film mirror the fractured lens of history, and point to the impossibility of cinema as a container for \"Truth.\" In Trouble, it is a means of connection between an estranged parent and his adult child, a medium for drawing connections between political struggles and a way to highlight the complexities of representation and the construction of identity.\n\n*** Please consider buying a ticket even if you saw the free screening and liked the film! It will go a long way towards supporting both the film and the arthouse cinema venues that are struggling to keep their doors open in this crisis. Thanks for your support and hope you're all safe out there!!\n\nIn the early 1970s, Mariah Garnett’s father fled Northern Ireland after being the subject of a BBC documentary about relationships that crossed the country’s violent religious and political divide. Four decades later, the Los Angeles-based artist and filmmaker returned to her father’s native Belfast, immersing herself in the city’s sectarian upheavals to make her own film about his early life. Named one of Sight & Sound’s best films of 2019, Trouble mixes archival footage, contemporary interviews, and a series of extraordinary performances in which Garnett plays her father, reenacting both the BBC documentary and his present-day reflections on the period. Through its multifaceted form, the film depicts the complexities of identity and the echoing effects of personal and historical trauma.\n\n2019, United Kingdom/United States, DCP, 83 minutes followed by discussion.\n\nMariah Garnett in person\n\nMARCH 11 + 12 AMHERST, MA\n\nSELECTED VIDEOS: AN EXHIBITION BY MARIAH GARNETT\n\nSCREENING OF TROUBLE MARCH 11, TALK & OPENING MARCH 12\n\nMarch 2, 2020 - 10:00 am to March 27, 2020 - 12:00 pm\n\nFayerweather Hall, 105 - Eli Marsh Gallery\n\n\"Selected Video Works\" presents four videos by Mariah Garnett made between 2010 and 2014. These works represent the early cornerstones of her experimental documentary practice. In all four films, the relationship between subject and filmmaker is foregrounded, calling into question the power dynamics at play in representational art practices. \"Garbage, The City, And Death\" uses a Fassbinder text to reframe a real-life relationship between long-lost siblings as a romantic rivalry. It was Garnett's first attempt to mix theatricality with a real relationship between herself and her subject. \"Picaresques\" takes its inspiration from \"Lieutenant Nun\", the autobiography of a transgender conquistador at the turn of the 17th century as its inspiration and abruptly becomes a portrait of Garnett's own friendship with a nine-year-old tomboy from Santa Monica. It is an attempt to look to the past and future for heroes of a similar gender to the artist's own. \"Encounters I May Or May Not Have Had With Peter Berlin\" moves through phases of idolization, anxiety ending in a touchdown in reality in a conversation between the artist and Berlin himself. This is the first film in which Garnett used impersonation as a strategy for representing her subject. Finally, \"Full Burn\" marks a shift in Garnett's practice away from overtly queer themes to the geopolitical. It is a portrait of four US War Veterans who have continued to use their own physicality to earn a living, three as stunt men and one as a massage therapist. It is a meditation on masculine duty, trauma and re-enactment.\n\nMarch 20 - Glasgow, uk\n\nMarch 20, 9pm,\n\nGlasgow International Short Film Festival\n\nFifty-two years since the commencement of Northern Ireland’s Troubles, Barbed Wire Love presents intimate tales from those who stayed, those who left and those who passed through. Sisters and brothers, those who danced at raves, those who had good intentions and those who did not. Chance encounters, intimate first-person cinema and the unreliability of history and biography create space for wry humour and tiny ecstasies.\n\nWith clear glimpses into, around and beyond violences proximal and peripheral to the North of Ireland, these are films which begin to describe a contested place and its social politics. Crossing genders, cruising lock-ins; moving from Tyrone to Vienna to Derry to Los Angeles and returning home to the cul-de-sacs of Eden, Barbed Wire Love creates new possibilities for connection.\n\nOpening film Trouble begins in Vienna, when filmmaker Mariah Garnett meets her father, David, whom she hasn’t seen since since the age of 2. Their faltering relationship leads us on an odyssey tracing a radical civil rights centered politics and nuance that has long since fallen out of media accounts and representations of Northern Ireland. Connecting with David through reenactments of the BBC news feature that drove him out of town, Garnett queers history and makes it new again.\n\nScreened at BFI London and New York Film Festivals during the last few months of 2019, Barbed Wire Love’s opening feature offers an opportunity to get up close with a film that the BFI’s Sight & Sound magazine crowned “one of the year’s best documentaries”.\n\nCurated by Myrid Carten and Peter Taylor. We are delighted that Mariah Garnett will attend to introduce the screening.\n\nMarch 22 - COPENHAGEN, DK\n\nMarch 22, 8pm,\n\nTROUBLE’S INTERNATIONAL PREMIERE\n\nCPH:DOX NEXT:WAVE COMPETITION\n\nSelected Video Works: An Exhibition by Mariah Garnett\n\nMarch 2, 2020 - 10:00 am to March 27, 2020 - 12:00 pm Fayerweather Hall, 105 - Eli Marsh Gallery\n\n\"Selected Video Works\" presents four videos by Mariah Garnett made between 2010 and 2014.

Garnett blends documentary, narrative and experimental filmmaking practices to make work that accesses existing people and communities beyond her immediate experience. Using source material that ranges from found text to iconic gay porn stars, Garnett often inserts herself into the films, creating cinematic allegories that codify and locate identity. In addition to screening her work, Mariah will be conducting a free workshop on Saturday, February 22 from 10:30am-1:30pm.\n\nTicket Prices\n\n$11 regular admission\n\n$9 matinees (before 6pm)\n\n$9 students/seniors/active military with valid ID\n\n$8 MdFF MembersProgram Notes\n\nDirections to the Parkway Theatre\n\nThe Stavros Niarchos Foundation Parkway is located at 5 W.

Once in Northern Ireland, she uses archive film and recordings of interviews with her father to reconstruct his younger years.\n\nGarnett plays with gender in her film, as, once in Belfast, she herself portrays her father and casts a trans actor as his Catholic girlfriend – clips from a 1971 doc highlight the contemporary controversy of interfaith relationships. It’s a fascinating, experimental take on identity, gender and the borders between us, literal and metaphorical.\n\nTagged with:CINEMABORDERS AND BOUNDARIES 2019\n\nUSA/UK 2019 Dir Mariah Garnett 83 min\n\nTwo of my films will be screening at USC’s Cinematheque 108 curated by Madison Brookshire on Thurs, Feb 28 along with a bunch of other great LA artists!\n\nhttps://cinema.usc.edu/events/event.cfm?id=43169\n\nThe Ray Stark Family Theatre, SCA 108\n\nGeorge Lucas Building, USC School of Cinematic Arts Complex\n\n900 W. 34th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90007\n\nFREE ADMISSION.
