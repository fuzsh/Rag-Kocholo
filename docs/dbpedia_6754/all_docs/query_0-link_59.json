The movie centers on the life of a boxer and former Provisional IRA Volunteer, Danny Flynn (Day-Lewis), who is trying to \"go straight\" after his release from prison. The movie portrays the increase of splinter groups within the IRA.\n\n“The Devil’s Own”\n\nA 1997 American action thriller movie, it stars Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt.
