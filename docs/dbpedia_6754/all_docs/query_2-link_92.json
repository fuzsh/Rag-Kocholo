        "text": "Created in 1966 by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, Black Panther first appeared in Fantastic Four before getting his own comic series. Hailing from the fictional African nation of Wakanda, home to a large deposit of the energy-rich vibranium, making it one of the world’s most technologically advanced nations. The hero was brought to the big screen in his own film in 2018. Fans of the hero will enjoy taking a closer look at the character and his homeland and their unique place in comic history in Black Panther Psychology.\n\nBlack Panther Psychology uses social, environmental, and family theories to explain the actions behind the hero of the comic, T’Challa, compared to his adversary Killmonger. How could two similar people from the same country have ended with such different morals? The book mentions social domain theory which is used to discuss the unique social situations of humans, how that can make life difficult with having to balance many interpersonal relationships at once, and how that can affect our decision-making abilities. These interactions with others fall into three main types: moral, social-conventional, and personal. All three of these areas are explored in the Black Panther series of comics and films, from moral choices over ruling Wakanda, to social-conventional applications about ceremonial traditions of battle, and personal themes of creating an identity separate from cultural expectations.\n\nBlack Panther was the first mainstream black superhero that was depicted without being a caricature. His story has always been closely allied with black rights in America and has examined the issue of race and black identity throughout the hero’s history. Black Panther Psychology cites several theories of identity formation, especially those related to minority groups. It uses these theories to help explain the differences between the hero T’Challa and the villain Killmonger. Along the journey of self-discovery and identification, people can experience traumatic events due to their minority identity. When these events linger it can stunt growth, leaving one at a limited stage of identification with society. This conflict is seen most apparently in Black Panther in the opposing ideas between T’Challa, who is willing to open Wakanda to outsiders, and Killmonger, who sees this mixing of cultures to being destructive to Wakanda’s culture and way of life.\n\nThe book also explores themes of father-son relationships between T’Challa and T’Chaka, the experiences of holistic versus individualistic selves in terms of Wakanda’s relation to the wider world, altruistic societies, the role of black women in the comic’s world and in the military, discrimination and non-physical aggression, intergenerational trauma, and much more. Also included are interviews with writers of the comics and Keith David, who voiced the original appearance of the animated Black Panther in the Fantastic Four series.\n\nBlack Panther Psychology and the film are available at the Bellevue University Library."
