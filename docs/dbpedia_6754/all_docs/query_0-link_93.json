        "text": "“Belfast” is a slice-life-life story about a young boy in the midst of “The Troubles,” in the movie taking place from late 1969 through early 1970, in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe young boy is Kenneth Branagh, who wrote the screenplay and directs the film based on his pre-teen years when Protestants and Catholics fought each other, sometimes to the death.\n\nIn the movie, the young boy’s name is Buddy (Jude Hill), a good student and generally a good boy. Buddy has an older brother, Will (Lewis McAskie).\n\nTheir parents are strict but caring. Ma (Caitríona Balfe), Buddy’s mother, is the disciplinarian. Pa (Jamie Dornan), Buddy’s father, is seldom at their small Belfast rowhouse because he works in England.\n\nThere’s also kindly and witty Pop (Ciarán Hinds), Buddy’s grandfather, and a feisty and wise Granny (Judi Dench), Buddy’s grandmother.\n\nThe movie tells of Buddy’s schoolboy crush on a female student, Catherine (Olive Tennant), his run-in with the law when finagled by another girl into boosting candy from the corner store, and his witnessing riots outside his doorstep.\n\nThe family is at a crossroads when Pa wants them to move to England and leave their troubles, and The Troubles, behind.\n\nBranagh, a Northern Ireland native who moved to England with his family, tells his story tenderly and whimsically, punctuated by pop-rock songs sung by Belfast native Van Morrison.\n\nThe songs are audio title cards, adding excitement to the film’s somewhat slow and steady pace. Unfortunately, the effect of the compelling songs (Van Morrison is always thus) is distracting at best, or a Van Morrison music video at worst. Either way, you’re taken right out of the film.\n\nBranagh lens the film in black and white, with a few exceptions, including scenes from the Walt Disney classic, “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” (1968). The contrast sets up a cinematic false positive. How can you compete with Dick Van Dyke singing the title song, as we hear and see in “Belfast”? The answer is: You can’t, and “Belfast” doesn’t.\n\nIt’s always dicey to insert scenes from other films full-screen into a film, rather than have the referenced film seen in the background in, say, a TV telecast. In “Belfast,” not only does Branagh include a rather long scene of Van Dyke singing in “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” he includes two scenes from “High Noon” (1953), starring Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, and a scene from “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” (1962), starring James Stewart and John Wayne.\n\n“Belfast” can’t help but suffer in comparison to such cinema classics and legends. Yes, Branagh is making the point about the influence of going to the movie theater on the psychology of Buddy, i.e., Branagh. The inference is that this is why he became a film-maker and actor.\n\nThe homage to some of his favorite films is noble. However, Branagh seems to be relying on the emotional wallop of said films’ scenes to evoke a heightened psychological awareness lacking in his screenplay.\n\nMoreover, Branagh uses the “High Noon” title song, “Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin’” (1952; music by Dimitri Tiomkin; lyrics by Ned Washington; sung by Tex Ritter), several times. This, combined with the songs by Van Morrison, dubbed “The Belfast Cowboy,” further heightens the good guys and bad guys, us versus them scenario Branagh sets up, resolved in title cards at the film’s conclusion with a rousing version of “Everlasting Love” (1967, originally by Robert Knight).\n\nSometimes, Branagh holds a shot too long. A case in point is the extreme three-quarter closeup of Ma’s face when she announces that the family will depart Belfast. We see a cutaway medium shot of Pa and the sons sitting glumly in a row on the living room couch. We get it: Ma had the final word. Still, it’s an awkward handling of the film’s money shot, to say the least. Branagh chooses other such arty framing that undercuts the drama.\n\nBranagh (Oscar nominee: supporting actor, “My Week With Marilyn,” 2011; adapted screenplay, “Hamlet,” 1996; short, live action, “Swan Song,” 1992; actor, director, “Henry V,” 1989) is an impressive and interesting film-maker.\n\n“Belfast” is of chief interest for Branagh fans, Van Morrison fans and those enamored of Celtic fare.\n\n“Belfast,”\n\nMPAA rated PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned.
