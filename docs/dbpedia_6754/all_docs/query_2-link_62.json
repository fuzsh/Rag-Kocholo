        "text": "Military and Veterans Records at the National Archives\n\nMilitary records can be valuable resources in personal and genealogical research. We are the official repository for records of the U.S. Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard and other government agencies. These records include:\n\nmilitary personnel service records\n\ntextual documents including unit reports and rosters; maps and plans; photographs; posters; motion pictures and sound recordings; and electronic records.\n\nNote that most military records, including veteran's military service records, are not online. There are casualty reports, photos and other selected military records available in our collection of Online Documents for Veterans.\n\nResearch on Veterans in Military Records\n\nThere is no simple explanation for how to begin research on veterans. Your path will depend on whether your research is personal, genealogical or historical in nature; and on aspects of the veteran's service such as: which branch of service, which conflict, what dates, whether Regular Army or a volunteer unit, whether they were an officer or enlisted personnel, and whether there was a pension application.\n\nResearch in Military Service Records\n\nMilitary service records are the primary source of information on individual veterans. These include Official Military Personnel Files (OMPFs) for recent veterans, and compiled service records and pension files for older veterans.\n\nGenealogy Research and Military Records\n\nAn Overview of Records at the National Archives Relating to Military Service\n\n20th-Century Veterans' Service Records\n\nHow to Request Copies of Military Service Records\n\nResearch in General Military Records\n\nOther military records such as after-action reports, ship deck logs, and unit reports, rosters and histories may also be of interest, but it is generally very difficult to locate information on individual veterans in these records."
