        "text": "IRISH PRESS:\n\n“Superb ... A wonderful film from an intrguging, restless talent ... Following up Out of Here, a narrative hit here in 2013, Foreman’s new film elegantly intertwines Irish history and a study of parenthood to form an intelligent cinematic essay. ”\n\n—Donald Clarke, The Irish Times\n\n“Foreman has … plumbed his own unique circumstance to explore deep, delicate questions of national socio-political soul-searching. … In seeking to locate an individual through his art, Foreman has demonstrated above all his own profound prowess as a maker and interrogator of images.”\n\n—Ronan Doyle, Scannain.com\n\n“Poetic and poignant … Engaging and evocative … A film full of vulnerability and bravery ... The profound reflections of a seasoned filmmaker.”\n\n—Síomha McQuinn, Film Ireland\n\n\"Foreman (director of the superb post-boom drama Out of Here) weaves together the personal and the political in an enthralling exhumation of a painful past.\"\n\n—John Maguire, The Sunday Business Post\n\n\"Avoiding the mawkish and sentimental, The Image You Missed is a highly-skilled work of art, with a reflective, uncompromising approach to biography.\"\n\n—Patrick Kehoe, RTÉ.ie\n\n\"Foreman ... uses his own film to turn the camera’s scrutiny back on his absent father, producing an engaging, clever consideration and critique of MacCaig’s legacy, of political docs more generally, and of the subtle differences between looking at and looking for.\"\n\n—Conor Smyth, The Thin Air\n\n\"Part documentary, part essay, part therapy, The Image You Missed is a fascinating account of a life less ordinary.\"\n\n—Michael Doherty, RTÉ Guide\n\nINTERNATIONAL PRESS:\n\n“Premiering in a sidebar at Rotterdam, this elliptical compendium of archival and newly shot footage quickly became a ‘buzz’ picture among the event's more ardently cinephile attendees … [An] engaging and quietly rewarding affair … An impressionistic primer on tumultuous Ulster affairs during and after the Troubles.”\n\n—Neil Young, The Hollywood Reporter\n\n“A moving and thoughtful first-person essay film … No longer beholden to his elder’s legacy, Foreman seems poised to carve out one of his own.”\n\n—Jordan Cronk, Film Comment\n\n“The Image You Missed is a meticulously hand-made, achingly evocative piece about a son coming to terms about who his father was as a man and as an artist.”\n\n—Pamela Cohn, Filmmaker Magazine\n\n“An intriguing documentary... that takes a sidelong look at the Troubles.”\n\n—Ben Konigsberg,The New York Times\n\n“Irish film-maker Donal Foreman’s marvellous, feature-length The Image You Missed (available on Vimeo) works through the film archive of his own father, American documentarian Arthur MacCaig, to assemble new familial and political narratives.”\n\n—Guy Lodge ,The Guardian\n\n“A meticulous and challenging comparison of two different ways of being a man, a citizen, and a filmmaker … A vibrant call for new fictions to be collectively written.”\n\n—Chloé-Galibert-Laîné, DesistFilm.com\n\n“Foreman grapples with MacCaig’s true-believer propaganda with a more nuanced approach, yielding a dichotomy of great relevance to today’s video essay makers: those 'able to reach conclusions' and those 'always concerned with what gets left out'.”\n\n—Kevin B. Lee, Sight & Sound\n\n“A deeply personal and powerfully moving documentary essay.”\n\n—Leonardo Goi, Senses of Cinema\n\n\"Foreman’s excavation of a familial rift unearths stories without neat conclusions. Yet some common ground is nevertheless found. Despite working in different climates, the perspectives of father and son, at least, meet on the subject of documentary film-making. They believe in the power of images and, as Mr Foreman said in an interview, the importance of 'conjuring ghosts, not getting rid of them'.\"\n\n—Sarah Jilani, The Economist\n\n“A beautifully choreographed conversation between two men caught in a perpetual state of diaspora … Each film is a mission impossible, but Foreman’s plays out at depths few others normally venture in.”\n\n—Leonardo Goi, The Film Stage\n\n“Irish director Dónal Foreman’s exquisite, elliptical autobiographical essay film stages a profoundly moving encounter with his late estranged father … How to reconcile the personal and the political, how we connect (or fail to) with images and with each other through images lie at the heart of this absolute must-see, one of the most charged and beautifully weighted essay films of recent times.”\n\n—Kieran Corliss (Deputy Editor of Sight & Sound),\n\n\"Eschewing easy conclusions in favor of infinite critique, the politics of the film are found, even more so than in Foreman’s conflicted admiration for McCaig and the nationalist movement, in its very approach to image-making and historical memory—a devastating performance of the inseparability of the personal, the political, and the aesthetic.\"\n\n—Patrick Harrison, MUBI Notebook\n\n\"The film poses cinema itself as the instrument that, at once, links the dispersed members of a political movement, and serves as the thin thread that connects father to son, across time, and beyond death.”\n\n—Leo Goldsmith, The Brooklyn Rail\n\n\"One of Donal's first texts is called 'Images Are Everything' (2003): it relates to the teaching of cinema and its title could not be more salient with regard to the explicit or implicit questions raised by The Image You Missed. What is a father who has not raised his son? How can a father devote his whole life to images without ever making or keeping any of his son? What is the power of these images that one can devote a life entirely and exclusively to them? What is the role of material or mental representations in collective life and in private life? What is the function, what is the efficacy, of activist films? By what mysterious paths do ideals, gestures, desires pass from one generation to another without them even needing to rub shoulders? How can we describe the incredible power of the forms of influence exercised by absence? All these questions and many more structure The Image You Missed, not verbally but by determining the subtlety and richness of each connection between the images shotby the father and those shot by the son. Donal Foreman's essay, anchored on his solid visual and theoretical grounding in the field of political cinema, develops his subject from the dialogues between the images themselves and, in so doing, invents a cascade of image events.\"\n\n—Nicole Brenez, Images de la Culture (CNC)\n\n\"Essential ... Worthy of a course in documentary and its multiple ways of facing the real.\"\n\n—José Geraldo Couto, Instituto Moreira Salles\n\n\"Briiliantly explored ... the question of what we’re really looking for when we partake in the act of watching...\"\n\n—Kiva Reardon, Filmmaker Magazine\n\n\"The Image You Missed is a shot reverse-shot between generations, where the ideals of the first face the disillusionment of the second, an Eisensteinian dialectic montage between these and the obsessive object of the father's cinema, namely the condition of Northern Ireland.\"\n\n—Giampiero Raganelli, CineClandestino\n\n\"In this valuable autobiographical essay by Foreman, the journalistic and historical sense of the images transcends and becomes an intimate, essential truth, something that recovers the political and aesthetic experience of the world.\"\n\n—Lucas Santos, Asa Nisi Masa Blog\n\n\"The Image You Missed says two very important things: that a movie should start where others end; that in a revolution, we always fight in the name of those who fought before us. However, it is not necessarily a question of mourning ... The melancholy here does not describe a contemplative state but a path towards action.\"\n\n—Carlos Solano, Revue 24\n\n\"Foreman’s film is a candid personal journey of a lost connection, but it is also an evocative piece of social history ... Both director and recent history are laid bare before us with powerful effect.\"\n\n—Anna Cale, The Culture Vulture\n\n\"Though it’s structurally and thematically challenging, the film is an investigation of process that grounds that search in more heartbreaking and relatable questions of how we construct memories of our loved ones, particularly those who were barely there to begin with.\"\n\n—Maxwell Courtright, Tone Madison\n\n\"Dónal Foreman’s remarkable audiovisual collage The Image You Missed seems indebted to Godard’s philosophy of historical montage ... The ethics of representation, the ability of cinema to function as a tool of historical thought, the power of the camera as an instrument of political action – all of these issues come to the fore in Foreman’s montage. ... In seeking out resonances with MacCaig’s practice and his own, Foreman speaks to the way that the personal and the political intertwine, and makes the possibility of genuine social reformation seem achievable, however elusive it may appear.\"\n\n—James Slaymaker, Film International\n\n\"Foreman’s relationship with his deceased father is predicated on animating his ghost as an ethical act: animating the ghost of his father but not his father per se. It is an estimate that involves sensing, as that which is faithful to the truth of not really knowing. The emphasis is on an ethics of working through material in a continuum that has no finality; a dialogue without final word. Sensing can assume a certain value, divorced from certainty of verifiable knowing.\"\n\n—Dara Waldron, Studies in Documentary Film\n\n\"... Impressionistic montages ... reflect the vagaries of memory, the verities of history, and the need to reconcile the potential of the past with the realities of the present. [Foreman] deftly and dreamily cuts from MacCaig’s footage to his own images and counterpoints his father’s comments in interviews or letters with his own sometimes-plaintive, never-to-be-answered questions about why his father abandoned him and what his life might have been like had he not.\"\n\n—Peter Keough, The Boston Globe\n\n\"Stunning and intimate\"\n\n—Rob Thomas,The Cap Times\n\nInterviews"
