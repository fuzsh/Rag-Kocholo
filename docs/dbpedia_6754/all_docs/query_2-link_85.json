        "text": "Father is the first song on the EP Weapons of the Modern Age by Sabaton.\n\nInformation[]\n\nThe song was exclusively released on the EP Weapons of the Modern Age.\n\nLyrically, the song deals with the use of scientific discoveries by a German scientist Fritz Haber in warfare.\n\nBackground[]\n\nJoakim Brodén: \"Our new song “Father” is a dark track about a very controversial person. Fritz Haber, the man who weaponised lethal gas, is responsible for about 4 billion people being alive today thanks to the Haber-Bosch process that he won a Nobel Prize for. It takes some serious thought to wrap your head around his story. Things aren’t always easy to understand or simply black and white, but rather all shades of grey. “Father” really forces you to think a bit more than the average song you hear on the radio.\"[1]\n\nHistoric fact[]\n\nFritz Haber (9 December 1868 – 29 January 1934) was a German chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of the Haber–Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This invention is important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. It is estimated that two thirds of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber–Bosch process, and that this supports nearly half the world population. Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born–Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. Haber is also considered the \"father of chemical warfare\" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I, especially his actions during the Second Battle of Ypres.[2]\n\nLive[]\n\nThe song wasn't performed live\n\nLyrics[]\n\nLyric video[]\n\nSabaton History[]"
