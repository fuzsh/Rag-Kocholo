Introduction to William Wordsworth and Romanticism\n\nWilliam Wordsworth was a British poet and primary co-founder of the Romantic literary movement. He strongly believed that the poetry of the nineteenth century was much too fast-paced and too mindless to be able to evoke a meaningful message to the reader. Contending that âall good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling,â he wished to pioneer Romanticism to create a genre of poetry that reminded the reader of the very essence of humanity.\n\nAs such, Wordsworth and fellow poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge founded a new style of poetry through their co-written 1798 Lyrical Ballads, a collection of poetry which attempted to unite the human condition with the tranquility of nature.Â\n\nAs a resident of Englandâs picturesque Lake District, Wordsworth enjoyed becoming one with nature by wandering through the neighbouring hills, moors and lakeside views, while mentally composing poems inspired by its glorious elements.Â\n\nWilliam Wordsworth: Poems Selected by Seamus Heaney is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\n2. Key Features of Romantic Poetry\n\nNature\n\nThe Romantic movement of poetry was founded during the Industrial Revolution, a period in which people were growing farther from the serene comfort of nature and closer towards modern mechanisation and mass manufacturing. As such, a primary characteristic of Romantic poetry is nature, as poets attempted to remind humanity of its meditative respite, and the comfort it could provide in the backdrop of the pollution that accompanied the growing industrialisation of England.Â\n\nWordsworth was a pantheist and believed that God was within every aspect of the natural world. In addition to this, he categorised himself as an ardent âworshipper of natureâ. Thus, much of his poetry explores nature in a sacred and religious sense, presenting goodness and naturalness as synonymous - aptly displaying his belief of nature as a living, divine entity that could only to be ignored at humankindâs peril.Â\n\nEmotionalismÂ\n\nRomantic poetry subdues reason, intellect and the scientific truth in order to place more focus on the âtruth of the imaginationâ. As a result of the harsh rigidity and rationality of the Enlightenment era, all human sentiments, from melancholiness to hopefulness, were celebrated by Romantics as important instruments in poetry to remind the common people of sentimentality in a modern and intransigent era.Â\n\nAs Romantics believed that these feelings allowed one to look deeper into oneâs self, the theme of powerful emotions constructs the very essence of Romantic poetic poetry. As a result of this, rather than placing much importance on sense or sensibility, much of Wordsworthâs poems scrutinise his own effusion of feelings and the universal truths that these help him discover, speaking as the characteristic Romantic poet occupying a sentimental place of alienation.\n\nRebellion and Individualism\n\nThe Industrial Revolution oversaw the creation of distinct class differences between the extremely wealthy class of businessmen, and financially struggling workers and entrepreneurs. Poets, like all other artists, were forced to become increasingly independent and needed to rely on their unique vision and style in order to succeed in their gradually declining line of work. The Romantics subsequently began to view themselves as heroes who challenged and overcame the social challenges that arose; as champions of independence and self-awareness. As such, Romantic poetry often features characters or symbols of valiant heroism, as the poet acts as a visionary figure in his work, like a prophet telling of poetic self-awareness.Â\n\nThe Sublime\n\nIn accordance with their celebration of human emotions, Romantics also became fascinated with the literary conception of âthe sublimeâ, a mental state that Classical authors such as Longinus defined as âphysical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic greatnessâ that is of such magnificence that it cannot be measured.Â\n\nThe Romantics explored these extraordinary experiences in their poetry, describing the power of such sublime experiences on oneâs senses, mind and imagination. Wordsworth expressed in his essay that a sublime experience is what occurs when oneâs mind attempts to attain âsomething towards which it can make approaches but which it is incapable of attainingâ. For example, his biographical poem, The Prelude recounts his ascent of Mount Snowdon and the sublime emotions he experiences as a result of its powerful atmosphere.Â\n\nMany have viewed Wordsworthâs view of the sublime as the Romantic standard, as his poetry focuses equally on both the alluring and devastating aspects of such sublime experiences. His work focuses on the intertwined pleasure and terror that is generated as a result of such experiences, and how either end of the spectrum is ultimately beautiful and inspiring.\n\nContext is really important when engaging with a text in VCE English, so be sure to read Context and Authorial Intention in VCE English.\n\n3. Poetic Analysis ExamplesÂ\n\nExample Passage 1\n\nBooks! 'tis a dull and endless strife:\n\nCome, hear the woodland linnet,\n\nHow sweet his music! on my life,\n\nThere's more of wisdom in it.\n\nAnd hark! how blithe the throstle sings!\n\nHe, too, is no mean preacher:\n\nCome forth into the light of things,\n\nLet Nature be your teacher.\n\nThis passage, taken from Wordsworthâs Tables Turned; An Evening Scene on the Same Subject, is a primary example of a poem displaying the Romanticsâ propensity and reverence for the natural landscape.Â Â\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nThe speaker of the poem contrasts the âendless strifeâ of book-learning to the spontaneous and liberal method of learning through interacting with nature. The description of the âwoodland [linnetâs]â song as âsweetâ music evokes an image of heavenly bliss associated with the charms hidden within nature. That âthereâs more of wisdom inâ such nature works in tandem with this, as the speaker asserts that the natural landscape is able to teach a lesson of a magnificence incomparable to the monotony of the âdullâ studying thorough book-learning.Â\n\nThe speakerâs evocation of âblitheâ emotions through sound is continued in the second stanza, in which âthe throstleâ delivers another divine âsongâ in an attempt to entice the reader. The speaker furthers his advocation for natural learning through a condemnation of route learning, as he attacks teachers of such as âmean preachersâ. The directly following use of a pun emphasises this contrast, as the âlight of thingsâ symbolises both the enlightenment that will accompany natureâs teaching, as well as the literal âlightâ of nature underneath the sun.Â\n\nThe final line of the passage summarises the speakerâs persuasion aptly, as the phrase, âlet nature be your teacherâ, rings similar to a passage which can be found in the Bible; the speaker thus implies that the natural world is the all-superior entity and source of knowledge that one should take lessons from.Â\n\nStylistic Analysis\n\nThe rhyme and the rhythmic beat of the poem give it a sound comparable to a nursery-rhyme. This works in tandem with the Romantic viewpoint that great poetic language should be simple, accessible and conversational; as understandable to the common people as a nursery rhyme is to a child. This similarity also works in accordance with the authorial message of the poem, that nature should be a universal âteacherâ, as nursery rhymes are often employed as enjoyable sing-songs that educate children on a moral level. As such, Wordsworth here strengthens his viewpoint through his poetic words; that nature should be a mentor to all.Â\n\nExample Passage 2\n\nâFor thou art with me here upon the banksÂ\n\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,Â\n\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catchÂ\n\nThe language of my former heart, and readÂ\n\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lightsÂ\n\nOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little whileÂ\n\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,Â\n\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,Â\n\nKnowing that Nature never did betrayÂ\n\nThe heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,Â\n\nThrough all the years of this our life, to leadÂ\n\nFrom joy to joyâ¦\n\nTherefore let the moonÂ\n\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;Â\n\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be freeÂ\n\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,Â\n\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be maturedÂ\n\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mindÂ\n\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,Â\n\nThy memory be as a dwelling-placeÂ\n\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,Â\n\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,Â\n\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughtsÂ\n\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,Â\n\nAnd these my exhortations! Nor, perchanceâÂ\n\nIf I should be where I no more can hearÂ\n\nThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleamsÂ\n\nOf past existenceâwilt thou then forgetÂ\n\nThat on the banks of this delightful streamÂ\n\nWe stood together; and that I, so longÂ\n\nA worshipper of Nature, hither cameÂ\n\nUnwearied in that service: rather sayÂ\n\nWith warmer loveâoh! with far deeper zealÂ\n\nOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,Â\n\nThat after many wanderings, many yearsÂ\n\nOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,Â\n\nAnd this green pastoral landscape, were to meÂ\n\nMore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!\n\nThis passage is taken from the final section from Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, a critical work in Wordsworthâs poetic career. Tracing the growth of his mind in different periods of time, the poem is a condensed, spiritual autobiography of Wordsworth himself as it views his younger self from the perspective of his older self, weighing the sense of âlossâ suffered against the belief that the years have brought him âabundant recompenseâ.Â\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nAfter recalling his experiences with nature over his formative and adult years, the speaker now addresses his younger sister Dorothy, as he gives her heartfelt advice about what he has learnt. Here, Dorothy becomes a ghost of his former self, as he hears âthe language of his former heartâ when she speaks and perceives his âformer pleasureâ in the âsoothing lights of [her] wild eyesâ.Â\n\nThe speaker depicts his loyalty to nature and its reflective loyalty to him, by the expression that ânature never did betray [his] heartâ that loves Dorothy, and this is the reason they have been living from âjoy to joyâ, lending nature a role of salvation.Â\n\nThe speaker then directly addresses the moon as a kind of separate entity, in order to ask it to bless his sister by shining on her âsolitary walkâ, so that when she is an adult her mind may become a âmansion for all lovely formsâ. This is an ode to the harshness of the society at the time, in which the privileged businessmen and factory owners possessed a monopoly over British wealth, and accompanying prejudices clouded social judgement. As such, the speaker expresses his desires for his beloved sister to be exempt from such hardship that he was once subjected to, so that she can enjoy âsweet sounds and memoriesâ without experiencing the vexations of an unrelenting human society.Â\n\nThe conclusion of the poem is cyclic, as it takes the speaker back to the âgreen pastoral landscapeâ of the beginning of his meditations. This symbolises the omnipresent timelessness of nature. As the speaker muses upon his âpast existenceâ, he wishes to convey his own reverence for nature to his beloved sister, as he expresses that she will not forget the âsteep woods and lofty cliffsâ upon which he first understood and respected nature.Â\n\nStylistic Analysis\n\nThe language utilised in this poem is lucid and natural, characteristic of Romantic poetry. The simplicity of the words chosen by Wordsworth effectively communicate the honesty of his own emotions towards nature. The elevated blank verse structure furthers this simplicity, as its familiar and easy tone is like that of a comfortable heartbeat or pulse that runs throughout oneâs body in a serene state of mind.Â\n\nUltimately, the unconstrained and liberating tone of the poem, in accordance with its free blank verse structure emphasises Wordsworthâs belief that nature is within our very selves. Just as the poem runs smoothly and continuously, akin to a human pulse, Wordsworth suggests that nature too runs within everyone as an incessant heartbeat, necessary in order to experience a âwarmerâ and âholierâ love for this universe.\n\nContents\n\n1.

The first half of the novel is dedicated to an almost anthropological depiction of Igbo village life and culture through following the life of the protagonist Okonkwo. Okonkwo is the greatest wrestler and warrior alive in the nine villages and beyond. He has dedicated his life to achieving status and proving his strength to avoid becoming like his father Unoka â a lazy, improvident, but gentle man. Weakness is Okonkwoâs greatest fear. After men in another village kill a woman from Umuofia, a boy named Ikemefuna is given to Umuofia as compensation and lives in Okonkwoâs compound until the Gods decide his fate. Ikemefuna quickly becomes part of Okonkwoâs family; he is like a brother to Okonkwoâs son Nwoye and is secretly loved by Okonkwo as well. Over the next three years, the novel follows Okonkwoâs family through harvest seasons, religious festivals, cultural rituals, and domestic disputes. Okonkwo is shown to be more aggressive than other Igbo men and is continually criticized and rebuked by the village for his violence and temper. When the Oracle of the Hills and Caves decides that Ikemefuna must be killed, Okonkwo is warned by a respected elder to have no hand in the boyâs death because Ikemefuna calls him âfatherâ. However, afraid of being thought weak, when Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo in hope of protection, Okonkwo delivers the fatal blow. Ikemefunaâs brutal death deeply distresses Nwoye who becomes afraid of his father.Â\n\nAt the end of Part One, Okonkwo accidentally kills a clansman at a funeral after his faulty gun explodes and is exiled to his motherland, Mbanta. During his exile, British missionaries arrive in Mbanta and establish a church. Nwoye, disillusioned with his own culture and Gods after Ikemefunaâs death, is attracted to Christianity and is an early convert. This is a heartbreaking disappointment to Okonkwo. When Okonkwo and his family return from exile after seven years they find that the missionaries and colonial governors have established Umuofia as the center of their new colonial government. Clashes of culture and morality occur, and as the British make the Igbo more dependent on them through introducing trade and formal education, the Igbo way of life is continually undermined. When a Christian convert unmasks an egwugwu during a tribal ritual, a sin amounting to the death of an ancestral spirit, the egwugwu burn down the village church. The men who destroyed the church are arrested and humiliated by the District Commissioner, and Okonkwo beheads a court messenger at a village council in rebellion. When none of his clansmen rise with him against the British, Okonkwo realizes his culture and way of life is lost and commits suicide in despair. Suicide is a crime against the Earth Goddess, Ani, so Okonkwo is left to rot above ground in the Evil Forest, like his father Unoka â a shameful fate he spent his life desperate to avoid. The final paragraph, written from the perspective of the District Commissioner, reduces Okonkwoâs life to a single sentence about his death in his planned book The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of The Lower Niger. Achebe has filled an entire novel with evidence of the complexity and sophistication of Okonkwoâs individual and social life and the District Commissionerâs casual dismissal and belittling of him causes us to flinch with horror and dismay. This is a metaphor for the reduction of Igbo culture in the eyes of its colonizers.Â\n\nThe title gives away the plot of the novel and anticipates the collapse of Okonkwo and his society. Things Fall Apart is about the connection between the tragic downfall of Okonkwo, who fate and temperamental weakness combine to destroy, and the destruction of his culture and society as the Igbo way of life is assailed by forces they do not understand and are unprepared to face.Â\n\nThemes\n\nA Full and Fair Representation of Ibo Traditional Life\n\nThe first part of the novel presents the traditional world of the Ibo with specificity and vibrancy. The imbedded descriptions of the patterns of interaction, daily routines and seasonal rituals of Ibo life creates an overwhelming impression of community and shared culture. We see the established system of values which regulates collective life and how closely related this is to natural cycles and environments. The Iboâs moral values are contained in sayings and stories, rituals and festivals. Achebe depicts a comprehensive and sustaining social, spiritual, economic, agricultural, and legal order. (Chapters to consider: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 19)\n\nWhile Ibo society is marked by the internal coherence of its organization and the poetry of its rituals, this coherence is partially formed by the repression of the individual and the inflexibility of social norms. Achebe shows the violence, dehumanization, and discrimination vulnerable groups experience in Umuofia due to the rigid adherence to tradition and superstition. This includes the customary abandonment of newborn twins, the sacrificial murder of Ikemefuna in the name of justice, and the discriminatory caste structure that denies inclusion to the osu (Chapters 7, 18).\n\nObierikaâs questioning of the stern logic of some customs suggests that many laws are enacted from a sense of duty and inevitability rather than from a firm conviction in their justice or efficacy (Chapter 13). The cultural demand for conformity places a huge moral and psychological burden on individuals who must reckon with the sometimes heartless will of the gods. This internal tension is epitomized in the character of Okonkwo, discussed below.Â Â\n\nClash of Cultures\n\nWhen the Ibo are confronted with rival institutions a mirror is held up to their society. Fall Apart honestly considers and reflects on Ibo practices, customs, values, and beliefs. The novel is a frank articulation of the nature of the African past and its relevance to the present and future. Achebe wants to illuminate Ibo culture to dispense with lingering colonial prejudices, but he is not sentimental or nostalgic for the past. Instead he is shifting through it to identify the valuable aspects of Ibo culture to bring into the future and help define Nigeriaâs post-independence identity.\n\nAchebe recognises that the colonial encounter which led, swiftly and seemingly inevitably, to the disintegration of Ibo culture revealed its profound weaknesses. Achebe suggests that with the arrival and contrast against another culture, a cultural reckoning was inevitable for the Ibo. However, cultural reckoning and revaluation is not the same thing as destruction and erasure. The British colonialists were a hostile force seeking cultural domination. By pointing out some of the weaknesses of the Ibo tradition, Achebe in no way excuses or justifies colonial domination or diminishes the pain and tragedy of the cultural erasure that occurred.\n\nColonial Domination\n\nThe anti-colonial position and purpose of the novel is powerfully clear. Achebe depicts the process of colonial initial establishment and the resultant cultural suspension of Ibo society. The British colonizers believed in their inherent cultural superiority and arrived in Umuofia with the intention to âbring civilizationâ (p.151) to Africa. They wanted to achieve full control by supplanting Ibo religion and culture with their own.\n\nThe British arrived quietly and non-confrontationally with their religion and the clans allow them to stay, misinterpreting their silence as peaceability. An Ibo proverb warns that there is danger in silence and nothing to fear from someone who reveals their motivations (Chapter 15). Obierika recognizes how the white manâs strategy disguised their intentions and gave them the freedom to grow and fortify. He explains the political consequences for the clan, now divided by the new religion, they can no longer act as one (Chapter 20). Without strength in unity, the Ibo are vulnerable to further encroachment of British control in their other institutions.\n\nAs only a small number of Ibo initially converted to Christianity, the church was only able to establish itself firmly in the villages because of the Iboâs religious tolerance (Chapter 2, 22). Mr Brown learns about Ibo religion and his willful blindness to its complexity shows how the colonizers justified their colonial rule and imposition through labelling their subjects âprimitiveâ. Mr Brown understands that Christianity held no appeal for people well integrated in Ibo society, concluding that âa frontal attack on it would not succeedâ (p.132) and thus introduces education as a new method of cultural displacement and erasure. Additionally, trade also increased the Iboâs dependence on the introduced economy (Chapter 21).\n\nFrom the very first introduction of the colonizers we understand that violence and fear were tools of oppression and dominance, forcing the Ibo to submit and keeping them unresisting (Chapter 15, 20, 23). Not only do the British impose foreign rule on the Ibo and judge them by standards they do not recognize, the District Commissionerâs personal brand of âjusticeâ is corrupt and hypocritical. When the elders are arbitrarily and falsely imprisoned, he tells them that what they have done âmust not happen in the dominion of our queenâ (p.141), combining personal corruption with a state apparatus of paternalism, hegemony, and occupation (Chapter 20, 23).\n\nDogmatic zealot, Reverend Smith, encourages fanaticism in his converts, motivating them to insult and humiliate the clan (Chapter 22). Under Reverend Smithâs wrathful guidance, the colonial agenda becomes transparently aggressive. The grief and pathos of the Iboâs situation and collective trauma is displayed evocatively in the final episodes as Achebe depicts this painful moment of acute crisis (Chapter 22, 23, 24, 25).\n\nFate\n\nA recurring thematic question in Things Fall Apart is to what degree the collapse of the Ibo and the downfall of Okonkwo are due to their own internal weaknesses or the whims of a pernicious fate.Â\n\nThe Ibo understand fate to be in a dynamic and somewhat ambiguous relationship with personal agency. This is evident in their proverb âwhen a man says yes his chi says yes alsoâ (p.20) which acknowledges and privileges the role of an individualâs choices in shaping their destiny (Chapter 4). The saying âas a man danced so the drums were beaten for himâ (p.135) also relates this idea â fate is a response to oneâs behaviour. Okonkwo is warned that killing Ikemefuna, his surrogate son, is the âkind of action for which the goddess wipes out whole familiesâ (p.49).This demonstrates the clanâs belief that the goddessâs (or fateâs) punishments are not arbitrary but the result of individual action (Chapter 8).\n\nAlthough there is an element of chance in Okonkwoâs gun accidentally exploding and killing someone, his exile carries the suggestion of just comeuppance in its echo of the guns failure to shoot when purposely aimed at Ekwefi (Chapter 5, 13). Likewise, although the arrival of the Christians was unexpected and chanced, Nwoyeâs rejection of his father is traceable directly to Okonkwoâs choice to kill Ikemefuna (Chapter 7). The desertion of people injured by Ibo traditions is a blow to the clan that feels equally earned (Chapters 16, 17, 18).Â Â\n\nAfter his exile, Okonkwo believes his chi has turned against him (Chapter 14). He renunciates the wisdom of his elders by denying the active role he had in directing the course of events. His refusal to reflect on the connection between his actions and punishment reflect his fatal flaws: hubris and willful lack of self-knowledge. By refusing to self-analyze and self-correct, Okonkwo loses the opportunity of redemption. Comparably, the Ibo, despite believing in a relationship between action and fate, do not reflect on the cause of their kinsmenâs desertion to Christianity. Achebe provides numerous examples of the clanâs dogma and brutal traditions denying people such as Ikemefuna or twins control over their lives (Chapter 2, 7). It was the shortcomings of the Ibo social and religious order that made members susceptible to the attraction of a competing value system with a more articulated concept of individuality. The Iboâs cultural lack of self-apprehension meant they could not adjust their traditions to save themselves.\n\nHowever, just as Achebe shows how individuals in the clan are at the mercy of rigid overarching authority, he shows how the fateful forces of history constrain human agency. The Britishâs hostile intention to erase and supplant the Ibo way of life is a punishment greater than the Ibo deserve and a force stronger than they can rise to. In his description of the grief and trauma of colonial imposition, Achebe demonstrates his compassion and sorrow for the Ibo as they faced the sweeping and unforgiving forces of change in their moment of historical crisis.Â\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. \"Things Fall Apart demonstrates how the values and customs of a society help us to deal with the familiar but not with change.\" Discuss.\n\n2. \"Traditional ideas of honour dominate Okonkwo's life and finally they destroy him.\" Discuss.\n\n3. \"Nwoye knew that it was right to be masculine and to be violent, but somehow he still preferred the stories his mother used to tell.\" How does Achebe explore masculinity in Things Fall Apart?\n\nâ\n\nNow it's your turn!

Discuss.\n\nWhenever you are breaking a prompt down. Ask yourself...\n\nWhat are the key words/ ideas that you need to address?\n\nWhich theme is the prompt referring to?\n\nDo you agree with prompt? Or do you disagree with it?\n\nThe keywords of this prompt would be women, suffer,, victimised and men. The prompt requires us to address the role of women in the text and the ways in which they suffer in a society that is pervaded by patriarchal values. It also asks us, âWho is to blame?â Are men solely responsible for the maltreatment or are there other causes to their suffering? The word âmostâ in this prompt is actually there to give us a bit of room for discussion. Yes, women do suffer, but do they suffer the most? Or do men suffer as well?\n\nNow that weâve thought about the prompt, we can move on to the second step of the THINK part of the THINK and EXECUTE technique. To find out more about this unique strategy, Iâd recommend downloading a free sample of our How to Write a Killer Text Response eBook!\n\nNow, before we write our ideas in beautiful topic sentences, itâs often easier to simplify everything first. One way to do this is to work out whether the paragraph agrees or disagrees with the prompt at hand. We could follow this structureâ¦\n\nâ\n\nYes, the prompt is true because X\n\nYes, another reason it is true is X\n\nWhile it is true, it is limited by X\n\nBy elucidating the ways in which women are seen as inferior to their male counterparts, the writer establishes his critique on a society that victimises and oppresses women.\n\nFrom the outset of the book, Okonkwo is characterised as a violent man who ârules his household with a heavy handâ, placing his wives in perpetual fear. The frequent beating and violence fortifies the portrayal of him as a man who is governed by his hatred of âgentility and idlenessâ, further showing the terror that his wives are forced to be living in.\n\n\"Do what you are told woman. When did you become one of the ndichie (meaning elders) of Umuofia?\"\n\nHe also sees his wifeâs mere act of questioning as disrespect, as evidenced through the ways in which he implies that she is overstepping her role.\n\nâThere were many women, but they looked on from the fringe like outsiders\"\n\nThis simile also shows how women are often marginalised and treated as outcasts, underlining the overarching yearning for social justice throughout the text. This pitiful image of women looking âon from the fringeâ also helps Achebe relay his criticism of gender double standards and the unfairness that Igbo women are forced to live with.\n\nAchebeâs sympathy for womenâs suffering and condemnation of menâs mistreatment towards are also evident through his depiction of a society that normalises misogyny.\n\nâHis mother and sisters worked hard enough, but they grew womenâs cropsâ¦ Yam, the king of crops, was a manâs cropsâ\n\nThe personification of the crops, in particular, the menâs crops, the âyamâ, being the âking of cropsâ establishes this gender hierarchy in yet another way. More specifically, the position of men in the social hierarchy is highlighted and the negative connotation attached to the âwomenâs cropsâ undermine their hard work, rendering it in significant.\n\nWhile women are the main victims of Igbo gendered prejudice, Achebe does not disregard the undue burden that societal expectations impose on men.\n\nâHe was afraid of being thought weak.â\n\nAchebe explores the burdens of unrealistic expectations that are placed on both men and women. This quote exemplifies societal expectations on men to be strong, powerful and fearless leaders who never show emotions. Achebeâs sympathies regarding these expectations show us that this is an important critique in Things Fall Apart that we can analyse.\n\nIf you find this helpful, then you might want to check out our Things Fall Apart: A Killer Text Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays (written by a 50 study scorer!) with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

Our stories can be pretty similarâjust have a scroll through the âsubtle asian traitsâ Facebook group, or have a conversation with literally any Asian Australian about their parents.\n\nAt the same time, itâs also important to recognise that everyoneâs experiences are diverse, especially given how broad an identity âAsianâ can be. Also important is to recognise how broad and intersectional identity can be in generalâintersectional meaning that race isnât the only thing that defines any one of us. Things like gender, socio-economic status, ability, sexual orientation and religion can also be really central, for example. Each of these things can impact the way we navigate the world.\n\nCovering a broad range of these stories is Alice Pungâs anthology, Growing Up Asian In Australia. Some of the contributors in this volume include Sunil Badami, Matt Huynh, Bon-Wai Chou, Diana Nguyen, Michelle and Benjamin Law, and Shaun Tan, and already this cross-section is fairly diverse in nature. You can also click on their names to find out a bit more about each of their work. I think this is worth a few minutes, just to get acquainted with the sheer range of Asian-Australian creatives who are represented in this book, and to locate their work within the themes they write aboutâin other words, having a think about the ways that cultural heritage, or experiences with family, or economic hardship permeate their work, both in the anthology and in their lives outside it.\n\nThe anthology is (perhaps quite helpfully) divided into sections which revolve around key themes, which is also going to inform the structure of this guide. Iâll be using this guide to go through an exercise that I found really helpful when learning the text, which involves:\n\ntaking two stories per section and drawing up some dot-point similarities and differences\n\ntranslating two of those points into paragraphs, a bit like a âmini-essayâ\n\nWeâll go through some an example of what this might look like, and why itâs a helpful exercise to try.\n\nBefore we start diving into Growing Up Asian in Australia, I'd highly recommend checking out LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nStrine (Badami & Tseng)\n\nStrine is whatâs called a syncope, a shortened way of pronouncing Australian (a bit like âStrayaâ)âit refers to Australian English as itâs spoken by locals. This section of the book is all about language, and about the difficulties of juggling two languages growing up, and Badami and Tsengâs stories are great examples of this.\n\n1. Similarity: connections to oneâs mother tongue fade over time. Tseng recounts how, one by one, she and her sisters stopped learning Chinese as they progressed through their Australian education. Badami on the other hand compromises his name which stood out as too Indian when he âjust wanted to fit in.â\n\n2. Similarity: for âthird-culture kidsâ, losing knowledge of their language also strains their relationship with their forebears. Badamiâs mother is shocked to hear the anglicisation of his name despite the significance it carrie for her (âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringyâ), and Tseng describes the experience of communicating with her father in âChinglishâ so that they can both understand each other.\n\n3. Difference: language can be an internalised, personal experience, or a highly exposed and interpersonal one. While Tseng feels her loss of her language as a âsense of shame, a vague uneaseâ, Badami is almost bullied into changing his name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â\n\nThe Clan (Law & Chau)\n\nThis section delves into the complex ties that hold migrant families together. Chauâs poems are starkly different to Lawâs story, so itâll be interesting to compare how these different narrative forms work to explore those ideas.\n\n1. Similarity: it can take at least one generation for migrant families to dig their roots into their new home. While Lawâs parents are proud tourists at Queensland theme parks, he and his siblings âgroanâ at their comportment. Chauâs poem âThe Firstbornâ traces his ancestry forward until he arrived, âan ABCâ and his son âby amniotic seaâ, both of them born into Australia.\n\n2. Similarity: family dynamics are still traditional and therefore gendered. Law notes how his motherâs health suffered when divorcing his father, and Chau notes that the women members of his family were âcast offâ the family tree âas if they were never born.\n\n3. Difference: family history and heritage can vary in importance. Chauâs family traces back âtwenty-eight generationsâ of history, whereas Lawâs family very much lives in the present, the only tie to older generations being his âMa-Maâ, or grandma.\n\n4. Difference: families show their love in different ways. Whether itâs dedicating a poem to his son about his life as one of âten thousand riversâ of Chinese diaspora into the Australian sea, or taking the kids to theme parks on weekends, all sorts of affection can hold families together.\n\nPutting it together\n\nSo Iâve tried to choose two sections (and four stories) that are all a bit different to try and mix it up and get some rich comparative discussion out of these. You might be studying this text alone, but even as one text, remember that thereâs a lot of diverse experiences being represented in it, so discussing how stories connect, compare and contrast is just as important as discussing the content of individual stories themselves.\n\nIf we do a mini-essay, we might as well go about it properly and pick some sort of contention. Without a fixed prompt though, it might be easier to start with those dot points and pick which ones we want to write out and string together. Letâs pick twoâconnections to mother tongue fading over time (Strine similarity 1) and digging roots into Australia over time (The Clan similarity 1). A contention covering these points might look like:\n\nWhile second generation migrants may struggle with loss of culture, they also constitute a unique and significant part of the diaspora.\n\nAn example\n\nMany migrants lose connections to their heritage over time, and these connections are often in the form of language. Particularly for Asian migrants, there is not as strong a need to preserve their mother tongue in the English-speaking Australia, and as such their knowledge of those languages can be easily lost. Ivy Tseng, for instance, recalls how she was never able to âgrasp the significanceâ of learning Chinese as a child, and eventually she and her sisters would prioritise âstudyâ and other academic pursuits over learning Chinese. Because tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language. These compromises can come from other factors as well, particularly the group dynamics of being in white-dominated Australia. Bullying is a frequent culprit, and Badami for example is indeed peer-pressured into resentingâand ultimately anglicisingâhis name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â More generally speaking, a sense of shame for oneâs difference is a common part of the migrant experienceâLaw experiences it as well at theme parks, where he and his siblings attempt to âset [them]selves apartâ from the faux-pas of their parents. Not always an intentional goal, but a general willingness to compromise connections to heritage underscores many Asian Australian migrant stories, particularly of second-generation migrants.\n\nHowever, the extent to which migrants feel socially integrated in society shifts generationally and over time as well. Second generation migrants are thus unique in that they have the closest connection to their heritage while also initiating this process of integration. Law and his siblings exemplify this, with their âAustralian accentsâ and âproper grammar and syntax.â While some loss of their native Cantonese takes place, they are also the first in their family to sound Australian, one step closer to being Australian. They constitute part of the distinct, third culture of âABCââAustralian-born Chineseâto which Chau alludes in his poem, âThe Firstbornâ. Distinct from first-generation migrants, ABCs are a product of diaspora and spend their formative years immersed in the Australian way of life. Chauâs poem goes on to highlight how sizeable this demographic now isââthe sea is awash with the unfathomable Chinese sons.â Thus, we can see how ABCs, or second generation Asian migrants, represent a unique and significant social group exemplified by great compromise, but also great change.\n\nWhy is this useful?/How can I apply this?\n\nI like this exercise because it gets you thinking creatively about the key implications of the stories. Within a section or theme, you want to identify similarities in how both stories contribute to our understanding of that theme. You also want to identify differences to explore how stories can be unique and nuanced, which will provide your essay with more depth when you ultimately need it. Then, putting it all together helps you synthesise new connections between themes.\n\nFor an analytical study of this text, youâd flesh out those ideas until they become paragraphs, introducing relevant evidence and mixing it up with explanatory sentences as you go. Explanatory sentences keep you analysing rather than story-telling, and they usually donât have any quotesâan example from above might be âbecause tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language.â\n\nFor a creative study, youâd take away those ideas and look at how else you might explore them in other stories. Feel free to challenge yourself for this; I remember falling back on more personal writing when studying this creatively, but donât neglect other genres or forms! If second generation migrants are in fact more on their way to belonging, write a speculative story about how an apocalypse tests those connections to white Australians. I dunno, but donât be afraid to really push the boundaries here and test the implications you draw from the stories.\n\nGive it a go\n\nTry it for some of these:\n\nUnAustralian? (Loewald & Law) and Leaving Home (Diana Nguyen & Paul Nguyen)\n\nBattlers (Dac & Law/Huynh) and Mates (Phommavanh & Ahmed)\n\nThe Folks (Lazaroo & Tran) and Homecoming (Beeby & Larkin)\n\nGrowing Up Asian in Australia Essay Prompt Breakdown\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nThe essay topic weâll be looking at today is short and sweet;\n\nTo belong is to sacrifice. Discuss.Â\n\nThe key terms are evidently âto belongâ and âto sacrificeâ, so these are the words and definitions that weâll have to interrogate.Â\n\nBelonging is a feeling of being accepted by someone or being a member of something, so weâd have to ask who is doing the accepting, and what are the writers seeking to be members of. On the other hand, sacrifice is loss, itâs giving something upâitâs implied that seeking belonging means you may have to navigate compromises to what you have, how you live, or maybe, who you are. Have a think about what sacrifices are made by whom, and why.\n\nWith that in mind, letâs brainstorm a contention. We usually want to avoid going fully agree or fully disagree to create a bit more âgritâ for the essayâand in this case, the prompt is pretty deterministic or absolute; itâs saying that belonging is all about sacrifice.Â\n\nIâd probably argue that belonging is sometimes about sacrifice, and for migrant children they often give up some of their culture or heritage for Western lifestyle or values. That being said, belonging in these cases is probably more about synthesis than sacrificeâitâs about being able to negotiate and bring heritage into increasingly Australian ways of life.\n\nThe brainstorming section of writing a killer essay is where my THINK and EXECUTE strategy comes in. If you havenât heard of it before, essentially, itâs a method of essay writing that emphasises the importance of really thinking about all aspects of a prompt and exploring all the different avenues you can go down. To be able to EXECUTE a well-reasoned, coherent and articulate essay that contains enough nitty-gritty analysis, you have to do enough THINKing to get some meat on the essayâs skeleton, so to speak. To learn more, check out my top selling eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nIn paragraphs, we could start by looking at some of the sacrifices people make in order to belong. The poem, âBe Good, Little Migrantsâ has a more of a cynical take on this, suggesting that migrant groups are expected to sacrifice economic mobility and even personal dignity in order to gain favour with locals: âgive us your faithful serviceâ, âdisplay your gratitude but donât be heard, donât be seen.âÂ\n\nEconomic sacrifices are seen across many stories, from the working class âdecent enough incomeâ in âFamily Lifeâ to the failing business in âABC Supermarketâ. Other forms of sacrifice might be less materialâfor example Benjamin Lawâs sacrifice of his Mariah Carey cassettes in an attempt to fit in at school from the story âTowards Manhoodâ. This example is interesting because it isnât a cultural sacrifice, but a gendered oneâitâs a good reminder that identity is always multi-layered.Â\n\nFor migrant children though, the sacrifices usually revolve around their race and culture. Diana Nguyen for example notes language as a key sacrifice: she quits Vietnamese school because she didnât feel like she belonged with the grade ones in her class, and her ultimate âlack of interest in learning [Vietnamese] created a lasting barrierâ between her mother and her. In Sunil Badamiâs story, âSticks and Stones and Such-Likeâ, the sacrifice is his name, as he Anglicises it to Neil. When his mother finds out, âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow.â The common denominator here is that Asians growing up in Australia often have to navigate sacrificing some of their heritage in order to belong in western society.Â\n\nHowever, the challenges faced by the Asian diaspora growing up abroad are more complex and more nuanced than just sacrifice. More often than not, theyâre required to synthesise a âthird cultureâ identity that balances their heritage with western values and lifestyles.Â\n\nDiana Nguyen goes on to discuss her career trajectory in becoming a âworking actorâ in Melbourneâs entertainment industry, carving out a path for herself in spite of her parentsâ disapproval, and going on to represent a new generation of Asian Australians in the media. The story âWei-Lei and Meâ also points to this shifting demographic in Australia, as Gouvernel and her best friend stave off a racist primary school bully only to see their home change for the better as they grew up, with new restaurants from their home cuisines opening up. At the same time, they âhad become what [they] thought [they] could never be: Australian,â describing a way of life in Canberra that is unmistakably Australian.Â\n\nSo, belonging isnât necessarily all about sacrificeâit doesnât mean you canât pursue your passions or become âAustralianâ. Sure, sometimes sacrifice is necessary, but âthird culture kidsâ synthesise conflicting identities in order to belong.Â\n\nHaving arrived at the contention, letâs just have another think about the takeaway message - being able to bring other themes into an essay topic that only really raises one theme. To answer this topic fully, a good essay wouldnât just discuss belonging and sacrifice, but it would also bring in discussion about family, friends, careers and cultures, just to name a few. Hopefully this is something you can translate into your own future work!\n\nConclusion\n\nGrowing Up Asian In Australia is an anthology with a lot to unpack, but there are plenty of unique stories with plenty of interesting links to be made. However youâre learning this text, being able to draw conclusions from stories and extrapolate them into your writing is a really important skill.\n\nAs you go, ask yourself about the implications: âso what?â and âwhy?â. These sorts of questions will help you get richer insights and write about the anthology in a more interesting way.\n\nUpdated 24/12/2020\n\nRansom is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Characters\n\nPriam\n\nPriam is an elderly king of Troy. As a child, his sister Hesione saved him from slavery, and had his named changed from Podarces to Priam, the name meaning âthe ransomed oneâ or âthe price paid'. After the death of his son Hector, Priam envisions himself in plain clothing, riding a plain cart to Achilles who is effectively holding Hector ransom. His vision is the catalyst for the novelâs events, for his journey is one of learning and self-development. Though the royal family is doubtful of his plan to save Hector, Priam is resolute and insists that he needs to try his best to confront Achilles as a father, rather than as king. After many decades as king of Troy, Priam is determined to reinvent how he will be remembered; as a king who performed an extraordinary act of heroism in order to save his beloved son.\n\nAchilles\n\nAchilles is known as the greatest warrior of the Greeks. The death of Patroclus, his closest companion and hinted lover, drives Achilles to insanity. Hector murdered Patroclus and, as a result, Achilles takes revenge by killing Hector. He then drags Hectorâs dead body along the walls of Troy for the next 11 days. Achilles loses his sense of humanity as he is possessed by his rage, hatred and grief.\n\nSomax\n\nSomax is representative of the âcommon manâ in Ransom. He is chosen to escort Priam to Achilles. His simple and plain presence is contrasted with Priamâs royal status. He often engages in useless chatter and performs daily activities in a way that is foreign to the king. Although Somax is far from royalty, his great deal of affection for his daughter-in-law and granddaughter teaches Priam about love, family and life.\n\nBeauty\n\nBeauty is Somaxâs favourite mule. She accompanies Priam and Somax on their journey to the Greek camp where Achilles resides.\n\nShock\n\nSomaxâs other mule who carries the cart to Achillesâ camp.\n\nHecuba\n\nHecuba is Priamâs beloved wife and mother of Hector. She is initially uncertain of Priamâs vision to save Hector. However, after hearing Priamâs sentimental reasons, she shows support and urges him to first share his plan with their family and the kingdomâs council before he departs.\n\nHector\n\nHector is Priamâs son and also the leader of the Trojan army. He is kind, brave and noble without any cruel intentions, unlike his rival Achilles. During a battle between the Trojans and the Greeks, Hector kills Patroclus. This results in Achilles challenging Hector to a battle, resulting in Hectorâs death and Achillesâ triumph.\n\nNeoptolemus\n\nNeoptolemus is Achillesâ son. Although he is mentioned throughout Ransom, he makes his first appearance at the end of the novel where he savagely slaughters an old and defenseless Priam in an effort to avenge his fatherâs death.â\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nâ\n\nâ2. Themes\n\nIdentity\n\nRansom explores who we are and what it means to have an identity. As the leader of Troy for many decades, Priam has always viewed himself as a king. It appears as though Priam has been unhappy with his identity for quite some time, is physically weak, and feels as though he cannot protect his kingdom as efficiently as he used to. However, the death of Hector is a catalyst for Priam as he realises that he needs to become a âfatherâ rather than the âkingâ he had become so accustomed to. His search for Hector is also a search for himself, to reinvent who he is and how he wishes others to remember him.\n\nMeanwhile, Somax is designated as the kingâs herald, with the name Idaeus. He secretly notes his unhappiness with this name appointment, since he is âSomax, not Idaeus'. The name âSomaxâ is associated with many significant events in his life including his marriage and family, yet the new unfamiliar name strips him of this identity. Somaxâs confidence and pride in his identity is starkly contrasted with Priamâs pursuit for an identity transformation.\n\nChange\n\nMalouf demonstrates that it is never too late to change oneâs ways. Priamâs determination to change how he is remembered â from just another king leading a regal life to a hero who went to extraordinary lengths to regain his child â demonstrates that change is within our grasp. Even though his beautiful wife Hecuba and the rest of his family have reservations about his desire to confront Achilles, Priam is resolved in taking a âchance', rather than achieving nothing by remaining within the walls of his home. Unexpectedly, this one idea propels Priam into a multitude of other changes. His journey with Somax teaches Priam a far greater deal than he had anticipated, for he learns to appreciate the value of the human connection and other daily simplicities in life.\n\nAlthough Achilles is driven by hatred and anger after Patroclusâ death, as with Priam, he manages to change his ways. He is touched by Priamâs pleas and consequently accepts the ransom and returns Hectorâs body. He is able to reach this state of peace by releasing his immoral intentions and even offers to hold a ritual for Hectorâs body in the Greek walls that very night. This transformation, from a human who responds to grief with vengeance to someone who releases and forgives, demonstrates the benefits we can gain from amending our ways.\n\nRevenge, Guilt and Peace\n\nRevenge is portrayed as a never-ending vicious cycle until both parties reach a negotiation or peace. After Patroclusâ death, Achilles hunts down Hector in order to avenge his best friendâs early death. Although he is successful in murdering Hector, Achilles does not follow the custom of leaving the body for the grieving family to bury. Instead, Achilles feels the need to mutilate the body day after day without any sense of remorse or regret. His additional need to inflict harm on Hectorâs body indicates that revenge will not bring closure. His sense of loss is shown as he reflects feeling empty inside, to the point where he no longer feels like himself, but someone else altogether.\n\nAlthough Achilles and Priam ultimately find peace within themselves, many years later Achillesâ son Neoptolemus murders Priam, bounded by the same hatred and pain depicted by Achilles. Neoptolemusâ subsequent guilt and regret is carried with him throughout the rest of his life, demonstrating that again, revenge is not the answer to any problem.\n\nChance and Fate\n\nThe role of the gods is heavily woven into the events that unfold in Ransom. Priam only begins his transition and journey after envisioning the goddess Iris, who suggests that he take a âchanceâ and try to save Hector from Achillesâ camp. During his journey, a jovial young man who joins the travellers is revealed as Hermes, a god who has come to safely guide the elderly men to Achilles. The power of the gods in controlling human fate is illustrated during the scene where Hermes saves the travellers from being swept away by a stream.\n\nNevertheless, it can also be argued that it is the charactersâ decisions that lead them to their fate. Although the gods may have instilled in Priam the idea that he should rescue Hector, it is the kingâs determination which is a main driving force for the journey. Even when confronted with doubt and hesitancy from his family, it is Priam who pushes onwards to fulfil his vision. Whether his actions were already predestined or of his own agency is up to you to decide.\n\nNature Versus Man\n\nManâs presence on earth is shown to have little significance in comparison to the power of nature. While the events in Ransom teach the characters many valuable lessons, ultimately these meaningful moments in the humansâ lives disappear as one reaches their fate â death. Time moves on beyond our lives as we are forgotten over decades and centuries while nature prevails. Priamâs desire to be remembered by others highlights how little significance a life possesses unless one behaves extraordinarily. Malouf demonstrates that in the end, life just is â we are granted by nature to have a brief existence, yet in the end, nature and time will move forward without us.\n\nCommoners Versus Royalty\n\nAlthough royalty is portrayed to be blessed with power and authority, it is ironically the commoners in Ransom who appear to have the ârichestâ (and more fulfilling) lives. For the first time, Priam is exposed to the different interests and values of the common man and is intrigued by the simplicities of life. It is Somax, a mere old man from the marketplace, who teaches Priam more about life than he had imagined possible.\n\n3. Symbols\n\nJoveâs Eagle\n\nJoveâs eagle is a representation of a bird renowned for its keen sight. The presence of Joveâs eagle during Priam and Somaxâs departure hints that the gods will safely guide their journey as the bird behaves as a lookout. Furthermore, the symbol of the eagleâs powerful vision is contrasted with Priamâs âblindnessâ at the beginning of the journey since he is yet to experience the outside world. It is during the journey that he learns about himself and others, and thus, improves his âsight.â Coincidently, Joveâs eagle is no longer mentioned when Priam is endowed with his new insight.\n\nCart\n\nThe royal cart is âa fine new one, the marks of the adze still visible on its timbers. The twelve-spoked wheels are elaborately carved and painted, a wickerwork canopy covers the tray'. On all occasions, the king had used this elegant cart to alert others that royalty was present. The use of this cart demonstrates how Priam has been encapsulated in his own royal sphere since everything is meticulously chosen and designed specifically for the king. Nevertheless, his demand for a âcommon work cartâ depicts his determination for a simple approach to Achilles, as a father to another father. This simplicity highlights Priamâs desire to become just another man and father, anonymous in the plain cart with the hopes of retrieving Hector.\n\nPriam as a Child\n\nAt the beginning of the journey, Priam is characterised with childish traits. When Somax urges Priam to dabble his feet in the stream, words such as âobedient toddler', âthree uncertain steps', and âhappy smileâ reflect the actions of a young child trying new experiences. This childish nature is contrasted with Priamâs old and frail age, which demonstrates that although he has lived a life in royalty, his lack of exposure to âreal lifeâ has left him crippled of the simplest experiences such as the cooling effect of feet in water and eating delicious homemade cookies.\n\nCakes\n\nThe cakes Somax brings along during the journey highlight Priamâs lack of knowledge of even the simplest things. For Somax, the little griddlecakes are a regular and delectable snack, yet Priam 'ha[s] never seen them before'. Priamâs unfamiliarity with the cakes represents his isolation from the âreal worldâ since he has been deprived from things that even commoners view as ordinary.\n\nFuthermore, Somaxâs lengthy chatter about his daughter-in-law cooking the cakes with the âbatter bubbling and setting and turning a golden brownâ prompts Priam to think about the activities in his kingdom that occur behind closed doors. He had previously never noticed that there was so much preparation and work that went into the food that appeared at his table, let alone the ingredients and thickness of a batter. These matters had been of little concern to Priam, yet he realises that even the âcommon and lowâ¦activities and facts of life, had an appeal'.\n\nHectorâs Body\n\nAlthough Achilles drags Hectorâs body across the walls of Troy for eleven days, each morning he would return to find Hectorâs body healed of any wounds, and absent of any physical damage to his body. This is a cruel reminder of the godâs ability to âtoy aroundâ with the Ancient Greeksâ lives. Hectorâs body also symbolises how revenge is not the answer to any conflict, since dealing with a tragic loss through revenge does not gain anything but more pain and suffering.\n\nSniffing\n\nAlthough Priam initially believes he understands the distress of losing a son, Somaxâs experience of losing his son is driven with emotions that Priam had never previously experienced. When sharing the story of his sonâs death, Somax sniffles, an âodd habitâ according to Priam. The use of âodd habitâ to describe Somaxâs sadness demonstrates how Priam has never truly felt the loss of his son, but only the loss of a royal relationship between king and prince.\n\nLater on, Somax once again âsnufflesâ and ârubs his noseâ at the thought of the ending to their journey. Similarly, Priam makes âsmall sounds', presumably crying as well. The transformation of Priam from someone who failed to empathise with Somaxâs tears at the beginning of the journey to a man filled with emotions demonstrates that Priam undergoes both a physical and metaphysical journey where he undergoes self-development and appreciation of the world around him.\n\n4. Plot, Analysis, Important Passages and Quotes\n\nChapter I\n\nPlot\n\nAchilles, the greatest warrior of the Greeks, stands next to the sea while reminiscing about the past. After his motherâs death he had âentered the rough world of menâ (p. 6) where wars and battles prevail. Every morning, he feels the need to âtramp to shoreâ (p. 10) since he is haunted by the death of his âsoulmate and companionâ Patroclus, and his raging hatred towards Hector, killer of Patroclus and thus, the âimplacable enemy'.\n\nWhen Achilles was a child, his cousin Patroclus came to live with the young Achilles since the former had killed the son of a high official of the royal court due to a âquarrel over a game of knucklebonesâ (p. 11). In need of asylum, Patroclus came to live with Achillesâ family. As the years passed, the pair grew closer to the extent where Achilles believes that âhe had mated with Patroclusâ (p. 15).\n\nWhen the tide of the battle was against the Greeks, Patroclus disguises himself in Achillesâ armour in order to instill fear in the Trojans and cause them to return to the safety of their walls, thus providing temporary relief for the Greeks. In his last act for his closest friend, Patroclus is killed in battle*. The death of Patroclus left Achilles with an overwhelming sense of loss and also burning animosity. Achilles whispers that he will join Patroclus soon, but firstly, he has to avenge Patroclusâ killer, Hector.\n\nHector, the son of Trojan king Priam and leader of the Trojan army, wore Achilles' armour as a sign of triumph and disrespect for the Greeks. In a dramatic battle between Hector and himself, Achilles was successful in killing his enemy. Achillesâ Myrmidons then stripped Hector of his armour and âwithout pityâ¦plunged their swords into Hectorâs unprotected fleshâ (p. 24). For Achilles however, this was not enough. Still fuelled by his pain, Achilles ties Hectorâs body to a chariot and drags it âup and down under the walls of Troyâ (p. 26) as the dead warriorâs royal family devastatingly watches on. Achilles feels like a âdead manâ¦feeling nothingâ (p. 26), unable to seal the void left by his beloved friend.\n\nThe next day, Achilles is furious to find Hectorâs body âsmoothly sealed and the torn flesh made whole again'. His men cannot bear to look at him as he drives the chariot with Hectorâs body along the walls of the Trojans once again. Afterwards he quickly falls asleep, into âoblivionâ (p. 35) as he struggles with the shame and guilt of his actions. He is âwaiting for a breakâ¦something new and unimaginableâ in his life.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Human Side\n\nAlong with the conflict between Greece and Troy, Ransom also delves into the consequences of those affected by the war. As the greatest warrior of all Greeks, Achilles has lived his life as a fighter. Nevertheless, his pathway in life has led him to believe that âsuch a life is death to the warrior spiritâ (p. 7). While warriors are known for sacrificing their lives in the battlefield, Achilles does not literally refer to warriors confronting death each time they fight for their team. In fact, âdeath to the warrior spiritâ means to metaphorically lose what it means to âliveâ when one experiences bloodshed in each war. Growing up surrounded by âthe rough world of menâ (p. 6), Achilles develops traits of aggression, cruelty and vengefulness in order to become an implacable man of war. As a consequence, Achilles only knows how to deal with Patroclusâ death with a fighterâs mindset. Instead of grieving openly, âhe never permit[s] himself to betray to others what he [feels]â (p. 5), thus detaching himself from the natural human process of grieving. In order to deal with his friendâs tragic ending, Achilles' âsoul chang[es] colourâ as drags Hectorâs body for eleven days without any sense of regret or remorse, and thus, is referred to as âdeath to his human spiritâ since he was no longer âa living manâ (p. 27). He faces Patroclusâ death with the same warrior traits of aggression, cruelty and vengefulness, depriving himself of any ability to humanely mourn his close friendâs death.\n\nFurthermore, Achilles grieves for his mother in the opening passages of Ransom. During this time of loss, his mother symbolises Achillesâ need to be nurtured. The imagery of the sea surface as a âbellyâ and âa membrane stretched to a fine transparencyâ (p. 3) represents his motherâs pregnancy where he âhad hung curled in a dream of pre-existenceâ for ânine changes of the moonâ â or in other words, nine months of pregnancy. Achilles is characterised as a foetus, for his position is âchin down, shoulders hunchedâ as though he is inside a womb. Although Achilles is a fighter, he hides the fact that he wishes to be ârocked and comfortedâ by his mother, thus demonstrating that even beneath the surface of a cold-hearted warrior, the current of human emotions can cripple a manâs confident veneer.\n\nIf you'd like to read more of my analysis, feel free to access a sample of our ebook A Killer Text Guide: Ransom.

Introductions\n\nThe events of The Crucible begin with a group of young girls from Salem being discovered dancing and playing at witchcraft with Tituba, the slave of the townâs religious leader Reverend Parris. When his daughter Betty falls ill as a result, they and others seek to deflect blame away from themselves and simultaneously exact revenge against those they feel have wronged them. To do this, they are led by Parrisâ niece Abigail Williams to begin a spree of accusations of witchcraft which result in the hangings of many of the other townspeople, including John Proctor, with whom Abigail once had an affair. For a full detailed guide on The Crucible as a solo text, head over to our The Crucible Study Guide.\n\nPlague strikes a small, isolated Derbyshire village called Eyam in 1666 when it is brought there by a tailor carrying a bolt of infected cloth from London. The villageâs population is decimated as a result, and in the resulting Year of Wonders shows her burgeoning strength as a healer and ultimately her escape at the conclusion of the novel to a new life.\n\nâ\n\n2.

Sample paragraphs\n\nPrompt: How do The Crucible and Year of Wonders explore the role of Christianity in their respective communities?\n\nIf you are looking for sample essay topics to use for your study, check out our The Crucible and Year of Wonders Prompts.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn both The Crucible and Year of Wonders, the Christian faith is a central tenet of the lives of all characters, as both texts tell the story of strongly religious communities. It also acts as a strong driver of the conflict which occurs in both cases, but in quite distinct ways, and propels the action and development of many characters.\n\nBody paragraph\n\nWhile it is not the root of the troubles that develop throughout the courses of the texts, religion and the need to adhere to a belief system are central to their propagation and ultimate resolution. In Year of Wonders, the cause of the plague is as simple as the arrival of a disease carrier in Eyam, but is framed as a âtrialâ sent by God for the villagers to face. Likewise the scourge of accusations of witchcraft that befalls Salem is simply a result of people straying outside the bounds of good behaviour dictated by their community, but is instead seen as an outbreak of witchcraft and consorting with Satan. As such religion becomes the lens through which both crises are viewed, and is used to try to explain and resolve them. Before the advent of more modern scientific practices, one of the only ways that inexplicable events such as outbreaks of infectious disease or mass hysteria could be understood and tamed was to paint them as either benign or malignant spiritual acts. This allowed people to lay the blame not at their own doors, but at that of something beyond them; for the people of Eyam, something which in truth was a chance epidemiologic event could be seen as âan opportunity that He offers to very few upon this Earthâ. Because in both Eyam and Salem faith was already a familiar, stalwart part of everyday life, framing their respective disasters as acts of God or the Devil took away some of their fear, as they chose to see a terrible thing as part of something they had known since infancy.\n\nConclusion\n\nReligion is far more than part of the everyday life and prayer of the common people of Year of Wonders and The Crucible; it is the foundation of their moral code and their way of explaining events which are frightening and make no sense. It also acts as a driving force within individuals as well as communities, deciding one way or another their actions and ultimately their characters.\n\n5. Tips\n\nBoth texts are rich narratives on their own, but they are also strongly grounded in historical events that you may not have studied in great depth and which significantly influence the plot and charactersâ actions â this is especially relevant when discussing the religion portrayed in the texts. You may miss many of the authorsâ intended messages if youâre not aware of the full context of the books. Here are some ideas in this area that you might want to research:\n\nThe Crucible also has a very interesting place in modern history as Arthur Millerâs comment on the rampant McCarthyism of 1950s America. Do some research on Millerâs life and views (the introduction or foreword of your novel might have some useful hints).\n\nAlso note that The Crucible is a play whereas Year of Wonders is a novel; how does each format uphold or reveal the authorâs thoughts and ideas? How does the format of the text affect its other features (narrative, characters, voice etc.)?\n\nWe've explored themes, characters, literary devices and historical context amongst other things over on our Women of Troy by Euripides blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out as well as ourUltimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down a Women of Troy essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nThe Prompt: ââWe are loot my son and I, soldiersâ plunder.â Discuss how Euripides highlights the plight of women taken as slaves in war.âÂ\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe first thing to note about this prompt is that it is a 'howâ question, it is essentially asking us to identify the literary techniques Euripides has employed in order to âhighlightâ the womenâs âplightâ. The noun âplightâ is defined as a troublesome or unfortunate situation, yet we must consider this word in the context of war. How do the women suffer? In other words, how does Euripides demonstrate to his reader just how dejected the women are as slaves?\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nIt is relatively simple to identify the literary techniques which consistently appear throughout Euripidesâ play, such as imagery, metaphor and simile (not entirely sure what literary techniques are? We have a list of them for you here). However, keeping in mind we have to form three paragraphs, we should consider Euripidesâ authorial voice more broadly. For example, the women consistently lament their disillusionment with the gods. This is not a literary technique in itself, but it is still a literary choice which Euripides has made and which has been deepened with more specific literary devices like metaphor. The same could be said for the womenâs struggle for hope, and the contrast between their joyous pasts and dismal futures.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nUnlike a âto what extentâ question, we do not have to form an argument. Instead, we must forge a discussion of Euripidesâ literary decisions as a playwright.\n\nP1: Euripides juxtaposes the triumphant pasts of the Trojan women with their tragic futures. The 'shining citadels of Troy' are now a 'black smokened ruinâ.\n\nP2: Euripides illuminates the womenâs attempts to retain futile hope. Note that hope also comes in the form of revenge.\n\nP3: The dramatic irony of the play renders the womenâs desperate calls upon the gods all the more tragic. Here, we can also make reference to the prologue, and Atheneâs ploy to create a storm on the Greeksâ journey home which also ultimately affects the women.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nAt the heart of the conflict in The Women of Troy, lies the anguished 'suffering' (1) of the Trojan women as they confront their fates as 'slaves', and remember their pasts as wives and mothers. In his tragedy, first performed in Athens circa 415 BCE, Euripides amplifies the conflicted voices of the Trojan women, voices which are by contrast suppressed and disregarded in the Homeric works the Iliad and the Odyssey. Euripidesâ stark dichotomy between the glories and 'rituals' of the past, and the sombre 'grief' of the present, elucidate the magnitude of their losses, both material and moral. For as Andromache laments, these women have been objectified as 'loot', mere spoils of war to be abused and exploited. (2) The womenâs tendency to clutch onto chimerical (3) hopes and values only serves to further illuminate the profundity of their suffering once these ambitions have been brutally quashed in the 'dust' of their 'smoke blackened ruin' of Troy. Perhaps most significantly, Euripides juxtaposes the lingering though pitiful hope of the women with the godsâ complete 'desert[ion]' of Troy, positioning the women in an ironic chasm of cruel abandonment. Thus, the plight of women as wartime captives is dramatised by Euripides, corralling the audience into an ultimate stance of pity and empathy.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(1) It is often useful to embed short/one word quotes in your essay (we teach you how in How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss). It shows you have a great understanding of the text, and reads fluidly as opposed to overly long quotes.\n\nâ(2) Here, I have addressed the quote in the prompt in a single sentence, unpacking Euripidesâ analogy of Andromache and Astyanax as âlootâ. By comparing the two characters to war spoils, he is suggesting that they have been stripped of their free will and autonomy.\n\nâ(3) It is really important to vary your vocabulary in order to increase the sophistication of your essay. The adjective âchimericalâ refers to an ideal which is impossible to achieve.Â\n\nEuripidesâ juxtaposition between the dismal future of the Trojan women and the zenith of their pasts, further illuminates the chasm of their sufferings and losses as the ultimate victims of wartime atrocities. Chiefly, Euripides contrasts Hecubaâs former royal status with the demoralizing fate of her captivity, encapsulating this tragic fall from nobility with the ironic imagery, 'throned in the dustâ. Yet perhaps what truly emphasises her plight as a slave is her enduring role as a maternal figure of leadership, encapsulated in her regard of the chorus as '[her] children' and her reciprocated address as 'dear queen' and 'your mother'. Despite the 'death agony' she feels, she chooses to maintain her nobility through the depth of her morality, dramatizing the pitiful nature of her plight (4). Moreover, Euripidesâ juxtaposition between the 'shining citadels of Troy' and the 'misery' of the chorus elucidates the significance of 'home', a source of solace which has been barbarically stripped away from them. Likewise, Andromache laments her past as a dutiful and faithful wife, contrasting her fidelity against her fate as a 'concubine' to the formidable Neoptolemus (5). Euripides implies that Andromache must abandon her reputation as the 'perfect wife' â the very attribute for which she was chosen especially â doomed to confront a life of sexual slavery, an unwilling mother of Neoptolemusâ children.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(4) Here, I have used the word âplightâ, making sure I am engaging directly with the prompt. It is often easy to fall into the trap of creating a generalised essay which only loosely adheres to the question.Â\n\nâ(5) It is more sophisticated to specify the name of Andromacheâs husband (Neoptolemus), rather than to just simply state âAndromacheâs husbandâ (even though he is not featured as a character in Euripidesâ play).\n\nEuripides (6) characterises the women by their tendency to clutch on to 'hope[s]' and ideals that are impossible to fulfil. Almost a coping mechanism of sorts, the chorus paradoxically romanticise the Greek landscape in the first episode, lauding the 'sacred halls', 'green fields', 'beautiful river[s]' and 'wealth' of Hellas. Yet, their ardent critiques of their future 'home[s]' rejects any notion that the women truly believe these glorifications of the Greek realm. Similarly, Hecuba is motivated by her futile hope that Astyanax may one day seek vengeance and be 'the savior of Troy' by 'rebuild[ing]' the city. Yet tragically, this doomed hope is violently quashed by Odysseus 'blind panic' and acute lack of rationality: the 'liar' and 'deceiver' who 'lead the Greek council' in their debate. Though this hope initially provides her with some form of solace, all comfort is dashed with the announcement of his 'butchery'. Likewise, Cassandra is motivated by her own pursuit for revenge, lauding her 'sacred marriage' to Agamemnon as an event worthy of 'praise' and 'celebration'. Yet her hope is also jaded, for she must in the process 'flout all religious feeling' as a slave of Agamemnonâs 'lust', until she meets her painful hour of death at Clytemnestraâs hands.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(6) Notice that several of the sentences have begun with âEuripides characterisesâ or âEuripides illuminatesâ, engaging with the âhowâ part of the prompt. We are showing what the author has done and why.\n\nIronically, Euripides illuminates the plight of the Trojan women through his dramatic elucidation of the godsâ callous abandonment of the ruined Troy. Euripides juxtaposes the past 'rituals', 'dances', 'songs', 'sacrifices', 'offerings' and 'ceremonies' of the chorus with their bitter laments that 'the gods hate Troy' and that they are ultimately characterised by avarice. They are neither answered not consoled in their ultimate time of mourning, for the audience is aware that Poseidon has fled the scene in the prologue, disillusioned by the 'ceas[ing]' of 'worship', leaving 'nothing (â¦) worth a godâs consideration' in the fallen city. What is also rendered ironic by Euripides, is Atheneâs formidable ploy to 'make the Greeksâ return home a complete disaster.' Regardless of Atheneâs true motives for instigating this ultimate pursuit of comeuppance, the fact remains that the women too must endure this perilous journey to Greece. Not only are the despairing wives, mothers and daughters condemned to 'abject slavery' on foreign soil, they are 'innocent: victims who may â alongside the Greeks â find themselves on the shores of Euboea, among the 'float[ing] (â¦) corpses' of the Greek soldiers. They are not simply abandoned by the gods, they are, directly or indirectly, punished. (7)\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(7) This is a more original point which other students may not automatically think of. We often view Atheneâs âployâ as a deserved punishment of the âmurderousâ Greeks, yet there is no true justice, for the women too are ultimately affected.\n\nIn a play which serves to fill the silence of the Trojan women in the legendary works of the Iliad and the Odyssey (8), Euripides augments the pitiful plight of the Trojan women with agonizing references to past 'happiness', and equally unbearable forecasts of their roles as 'slaves' of Greek lust. They are indeed 'loot' and they are indeed 'plunder' â as Andromache so bitterly laments â yet their plight is recorded in the works of 'poets' to come, remembered as a legacy of stoicism 'a hundred generations hence.' Taken as our 'great theme', these women are 'sufferer[s]', yet they are also heroes.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(8) Just as I have done in the introduction, I have referred to the context of the play in the conclusion. The Iliad and the Odyssey provided the framework for Euripidesâ play, so by referencing Homerâs works we are showing the examiner that we have an understanding of the historical context.Â\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into Women of Troy, check out our A Killer Text Guide: Women of Troy study guide.

The film follows President Mandelaâs attempt to infuse a deeply divided country with new energy, by supporting the South African rugby teamâs victorious 1995 World Cup Campaign. The unlikely bond formed between President Mandela and Francois Pienarr, the captain of the rugby team, illustrates themes of unity and reconciliation in a divided nation. The film begins with the image of a deeply divided society in 1990, as Mandela is released from 27 years of incarceration. A poignant opening scene sees Mandela drive along a long dirt road that runs between two playing fields, on one side, young black children shout excitedly as Mandela passes. On the other side, immaculately dressed white boys stare vacantly, as their coach proclaims, âThis is the day our country went to the dogs.â This tumultuous period in South African history is of central concern to âInvictusâ, as Eastwood portrays the lingering racial prejudices imbedded in this society. The film portrays the tension between the bitter resentment of black South Africans towards their former oppressors, with the fear and uncertainty of white Afrikaners under Mandelaâs political leadership. Eastwood masterfully depicts the true story of the moment when Nelson Mandela harnessed the power of sports to unite a deeply divided South Africa.\n\nRansom\n\nSet during the Trojan War, one of the most famous events in Greek mythology, David Maloufâs historical fiction âRansomâ seeks to explore the overwhelming destruction caused by war, and the immense power of reconciliation. Drawing on the Iliad, the epic poem by Homer, Malouf focuses on the events of one day and night, in which King Priam of Troy travels to the enemy Greek encampment to plead with the warrior Achilles to release the body of his son, Hector. Maddened by grief at the murder of his friend Patroclus, Achilles desecrates the body of Hector as revenge. Despite Achilles refusal to give up Hectorâs body, Priam is convinced there must be a way of reclaiming the body â of pitting new ways against the old, and forcing the hand of fate. Maloufâs fable reflects the epic themes of the Trojan war, as fatherhood, love, grief and pride are expertly recast for our times.\n\nMalouf and Eastwood both depict societies on the brink: Troy faces annihilation by the Greeks, while South Africa faces an uncertain future as it emerges from the injustices of the apartheid era, both worlds are in dire need of true heroes to bridge the great divide. Together, these two texts echo the significance of hope in the enactment of change. To learn more, head over to our full Ransom Study Guide (covers themes, characters, chapter summaries, quotes and more).\n\nThemes\n\nThe power of shared human experiences\n\nBoth texts are centrally concerned with the significance of the universal experiences of love, loss, grief and hope to unite a divided people. Both Invictus and Ransom explore how societal forces divide people into different, often conflicting groups â whether this be race, history, culture, or war. Each text appeals to the universal experiences that define the human condition, and emphasise the significance of opportunities to cross-cultural divides.\n\nIn âRansomâ, Malouf is centrally concerned with the theme of fatherhood. This concept links the mortal and godly realms, which King Priam straddles over the course of his journey. The relationship between Priam and Somax illustrates this complex theme most clearly. The two men, despite being deeply separated by their class, education and power, share their common familial experiences. Priam confronts the poignancy of their shared experience of losing sons, questioning whether it âmeant the same for him as it did for the driverâ. Malouf thus presents Priam as initially lacking in terms of his understanding, Somaxâs friendship and stories are the catalyst for Priam to engage in deeper, empathetic understanding. Somaxâs trivial yet symbolically significant story about the griddle-cakes represents a moment of anagnorisis for Priam, wherein the shared bond of humanity in fatherhood allows Priam to obtain insight, and progressively grow as a human and as a leader. This incident fuels the journey to appeal to Achilles âman to manâ, Priamâs insight into the power of empathy allows him to appeal to their shared bond as suffering fathers.\n\nJust as Priam goes to Achilles âas a fatherâ, using their common quality, fatherhood, to further understand each other, Mandela, too, emphasises the point that you must âknow [your] enemy before [you] c[an] prevail against himâ and thus he âlearned their language, read their books, their poetryâ. Mandela attempts to unite Black and white South Africans, despite the mutual animosity and distrust fostered by decades of apartheid. Black and White South Africans share almost nothing in common, with significant cultural and societal barriers to their reconciliation, including different dialects. Rugby emerges as the most poignant manifestation of this divide as the White South Africans support their national team, but the black south Africans barrack for the opposing side. The scene wherein Pienarr and Mandela meet over tea is symbolic of this sentiment of fostering unity amongst deep divisions. President Mandela literally hunches over to pour the tea for Pienaar, this inversion of status demonstrates his willingness to reduce his dignity as a superior and speak with Pienarr, and by extension, white south Africans, on an equal level, modelling an example of how race relations in his nation should be carried out. This equality is also symbolised by the passing of the tea to Pienaar, the close up shot where both arms of the individuals are depicted on an equal level reinforces this sense of mutual equality and respect, extolling the virtues of empathy and integrity as a uniting force.\n\nLeadership and Sacrifice\n\nMandela and Priam symbolise how leadership must inevitably entail familial sacrifices. Both leaders self-identify with their nation and people. Priam embodies Troy itself, his body is the âliving mapâ of the kingdom. The âroyal sphereâ he embodies is constrained by customs and tradition, full of symbolic acts that separate him from the mortal world. To an extent, these royal obligations and ritual suffocate Priamâs individuality and he is unable to show his true nature, or connect with his family in the way he would desire to. He regards intimate relationships with his children as âwomenâs talkâ that âunnerves himâ as it is not âhis sphereâ. This articulation of the disassociation of the âroyal sphereâ with natural human bonds of family reveals the secondary role that family and love must take when oneâs role as a leader is paramount. Similarly, Mandela claims âI have a very big family. Forty-two million peopleâ. Unlike Priam, Mandela seeks human connection, predicating his leadership on democratic ideals. This takes a physical and emotional toll, as shown by Mandelaâs collapse in his driveway. The cost of leadership here is evident, as Mandela has effectively sacrificed his family for the good of his nation. His strained relationship with his daughter Zindzi further reinforces this, as she disapproves of Mandela reaching out to Pienarr, likening him to one of the white âpoliceman who forced (her) out of her homeâ, showing the disconnect between father and daughter due to the sacrifices necessitated by Mandelaâs life of leadership, including his 27 year imprisonment.\n\nFatherhood and Masculinity\n\nIn âRansomâ Malouf presents an enclosed, limited and unemotional masculine world, with particularly stringent expectations for menâs behaviour. This is a world characterised by war, wherein the expectations of violent masculinity are paramount. In presenting Achilles inside of âa membrane stretched to a fine transparencyâ, Malouf reveals the constant tension between the emotional, domestic human nature inside Achilles and the hierarchical violent external society that he is expected to abide by, revealing the constricting nature that the society has on defining menâs actions. Malouf uses words like âknottedâ and ârope-likeâ when describing Achillesâ muscles, implying that his conventional great strength, the source of his fearsome reputation, represents a confinement that the society enforces on him and other men. Further, through a degree of compassion, Priam is able to touch the âsore spot whose ache he has long repressedâ in Achilles, a symbol of the emotions that have been supressed by the dominant patriarchal nature of this society.\n\nWhilst the world of âInvictusâ is less overtly masculine and patriarchal, the narrative of the film is primarily focused on the male experiences, with female characters assuming a largely secondary role. Zindziâs strained relationship with her father exemplifies the sacrifices involved in leadership. Whilst Mandela is seen to have sacrificed a close connection with his daughter, this is suggested to be in service of the nation, âI have a big family. Forty two million peopleâ.\n\nCharacter analysis and comparison\n\nCharacter analysis/Comparison\n\nPriam\n\n- aging king of troy\n\n- individuality has been subsumed by the ceremonial functions of his high position\n\n- self-identifies with nation\n\n- life of obligation\n\n- foregoes convention and embraces chance with his proposal to offer ransom for his sonâs body\n\n- becomes more attuned to the natural world\n\n- gains a greater appreciation of his true self as a man, rather than a symbolic figurehead\n\nMandela\n\n- historic figure, symbol of peace\n\n- spent 27 years in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government while he was trying to gain civil rights for all south Africans\n\n- tackled institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality\n\n- suffered under apartheid\n\n- pursues reconciliation, prepared to face down calls for retribution\n\n- in his speech to the sports council, he defends the traditions of the people who persecuted him\n\n- interacts easily with people of all social standings\n\n- charismatic, in touch with the people\n\nComparison\n\n- embody essential role that leadership plays in achieving just resolutions to conflict\n\n- sacrifice family for leadership\n\n- illustrate that effective leadership takes a toll on the individual\n\n- exemplify that reconciliation requires unexpected and difficult acts. Such as Mandelaâs embrace of the Springboks and Priamâs appeal to Achilles âman to manâ\n\n- both show effective leadership involves expressing empathy and understanding the humanity of your enemies\n\nLiterary and cinematic techniques\n\nInvictus\n\n- In one of the first scenes in Mandelaâs office after he is elected President, Eastwood strategically frames the racial segregation and tension between the two groups via the mise-en-scene; they stand on separate sides of the room, wearing distinctly different clothing and calling Mandela either âMr Presidentâ or âMadibaâ, representative of their own identity. The lingering tension between the two groups permeates the entirety of the film, and the microcosm of the bodyguards acts as a symbol of the chasm within the wider nation.\n\n- The deeply symbolic scene wherein Mandela and Pienaar have tea, Eastwood strategically uses a close up shot to frame the passing of the tea cup so that both arms of the individuals are depicted on the same level, reinforcing this sense of mutual equality and respect. It is this sharing of hope that ignites Pienaar to reciprocate Mandelaâs egalitarian actions. As Pienaar brings a ticket for Eunice, recognising that âthereâs a fourthâ family member, he mimics Mandelaâs value that âno one is invisibleâ. Consequently, it is demonstrated that regardless of skin colour, characters reciprocate Mandelaâs empathy and compassion, revealing the limitless power such human qualities to reach across the boundaries of division.\n\n- The wide shot of the passing of the trophy from Mandela to Pienaar is framed against the large crowd, metaphorically representing South Africaâs support with the unity of the black and whites, reflecting Mandelaâs desire to âmeet black aspirations and quell white fearsâ. Their diegetic cheers work to create the idyllic depiction of the lasting power of this change, implying the true limitless nature of hope in their society.\n\nâ\n\nLearn more through Caleb (English study score 47) about Invictus Film Technique Analysis - How Can I Write About It?\n\nRansom\n\n- Priamâs moment of anagnorisis in which he discovers the concept of âchanceâ, marks the beginning of his enactment of change through the power of hope. Despite his family who wishes that he would âspare [himself of] this ordealâ, Priamâs vision guides him to overcome familial and societal obstacles in pursuit of reconciliation.\n\n- Symbol: Griddlecakes â represent pleasure in common things, but also the growing realisation within Priam of his distance from such pleasures. The love and care with with Somaxâs daughter cooked the cakes has a value that surpasses the conventional riches associated with the ruling elite.
