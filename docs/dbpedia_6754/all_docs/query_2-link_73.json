But Derek has recently emerged from prison a changed man, just in time for Danny to write a school essay about him. This film is America's go-to movie about white supremacy, so popular that even skinheads love it, despite its ultimate message of tolerance and understanding, but it contains so many wordy explanations, so many lectures, and such a heavy-handed score, it's kind of like watching a horribly graphic after-school special. See it if you must, but do yourself a favor and supplement it with something better, like Romper Stomper, This is England, or The Believer.

Griffith's epic silent film praises the Ku Klux Klan as \"the organization that saved the South from the anarchy of black rule.\" Unfortunately, the perceived necessity for the Klan causes conflict between Northern girl Elsie Stoneman (Lillian Gish) and her Southern beau, but fear not, because in the end (spoiler alert) North and South will be \"united in defense of their Aryan birthright.\" Which was what, again, exactly?

Co-stars Alina Levshin and Jella Haase won numerous awards in European film festivals, as did this film, which presents a rare look at a skinhead organization from a female perspective.

Critics have called it charming and heartfelt; I call it ridiculous. If you're looking for any kind of insight or enlightenment on the subject of white supremacy--or any other subject, for that matter--look elsewhere.

Ironic, as their situation echoes that of the Aborigines.

In addition to interviews and commentary with writer/director Shane Meadows, dvd extras include two essays by film historian Darrell Buxton--one about skinhead culture, and one about Thatcher's war in the Falklands, during which this story is set.
