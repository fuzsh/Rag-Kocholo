        "text": "\"In the following article, some films produced with the support of Bord Scannán na hÉireann (The Irish Film Board) since its reconstitution in 1993 are examined in light of the work of global anthropologist Arjun Appadurai and his theory of global cultural flows. The article suggests that cinema, primarily of Hollywood origin, has had a notable influence on the development of Irish society and Irish film. Contemporary Irish film itself also reflects the failure of Irish history to excite the imagination of Ireland's youth as effectively as the seductive depictions of America's past as mediated through the Western and gangster films. Indeed, films made in Ireland today reflect the influence of both these genres. However, as the key to the Hollywood continuity style of film-making is its own self-effacement, this has sometimes been reflected in the effacement of people, politics and place in contemporary Irish film as film-makers endeavor to attract a global audience for their work. Films considered include The Boy From Mercury (Martin Duffy, 1996), Nora (Pat Murphy, 1999), Circle of Friends (Pat O'Connor, 1993), Dancing at Lughnasa (Pat O'Connor, 1998), Saltwater (Conor McPherson, 1999), Ailsa (Paddy Breathnach, 1993), I Went Down (Paddy Breathnach, 1997), The Disappearance of Finbar (Sue Clayton, 1994/95), When Brendan Met Trudy (Kieron Walsh, 2000), High Boot Benny (Joe Comerford, 1993), Broken Harvest (Maurice O’Callaghan, 1993), The Boxer (Jim Sheridan, 1998), Some Mother’s Son (Terry George, 1996), Nothing Personal (Thaddeus O’Sullivan, 1994/95), and Sweety Barrett (Stephen Bradley, 1998).\"\n\nThis essay considers the promotion and reception of the Northern Ireland set Oscar-winning short film The Shore (2011) and its employment within the post-Belfast/Good Friday Agreement reconciliation discourse. Film is one of the most revelatory sites to view how this discourse has been formulated and circulated, evident particularly in the recurring focus on filiative (Said, 1983, pp. 174-175) reconciliation, operating at the level of the family rather than society, within cinematic texts. Cinema also suggests the failure of this discourse to engage with the real underlying and unresolved issues in the post Agreement context. Indeed, film has tended to obscure and elide these fundamentals, producing ultimately utopian depictions, often revealing a touristic gaze, for mass consumption. In this respect, The Shore is a remarkable rendering not so much of either Northern Ireland or of the post-Troubles context, but of the dominant representational paradigms within depictions of Ireland itself.\n\nAn essay commissioned by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and published as a pamphlet with eleven other essays which look at the ways in which various art forms responded to thirty years of 'the Troubles' in Northern Ireland. This essay considers a range of film and television drama over the years and argues that for most of the time, film and television drama ignored the politics behind the violence to concentrate on the impact that violence had on individuals and society in general. Any film or television drama which did venture into the politics behind the violence tended to create considerable controversy. With the peace process under way from 1993 onwards, film and especially television drama became more daring and more probing."
