        "meta_description": "Abstract The chapter examines recreations of armed conflict in Oliver Stone’s 2004 historical epic Alexander by paying attention both to the ancient textual and visual sources by which the film is informed and to the conventions of the war film genre and expectations of modern audiences to whom the film is addressed. The two scenes of armed conflict recreated in the film are the battles at Gaugamela and Hydaspes, both placed at strategic moments in the narrative. In particular, the chapter cast light on: a) the temporalities of warfare, that is, the different phases of military preparation and realization of warfare; b) the modalities of audiovisual narrative, especially those inspired by ancient historiographic and iconographic traditions; and c) the technicalities of the battle scenes and their position both within the Alexander filmography and the broader cinematic category of historical films. The chapter argues that Stone pays tribute to the historiographic tradition on Alexander (especially Arrian) and despite the condensations and revisions he manages to render the inherent tension of a controversial personality like Alexander. Landscape, color, armor, and body language are used by the American filmmaker to comment on male identity, here synonymous with extreme violence and mortality, while individual excellence, sacrifice, and combat trauma transform the frantic military conqueror to a self-destructive leader.",
