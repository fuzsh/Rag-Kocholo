        "text": "Update: Senator Robert Menendez announced on March 21 that he would not run in the New Jersey Democratic primary.\n\nIt was the night before federal prosecutors would reveal explosive bribery charges against Senator Robert Menendez, and his adult children appeared unaware of the news storm that was about to hit the family.\n\nAlicia and Rob Menendez seemed to be in great spirits at a glitzy political gala celebrating a new generation of Latino leaders.\n\nMs. Menendez, an increasingly high-profile anchor on the cable news network MSNBC, stood before a room filled with Latino politicians, media executives and entertainment figures, as the emcee of the annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute party in Washington.\n\nAmong those in attendance was her brother, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey who is in his first term representing a majority Hispanic district, a seat once held by his father.\n\nIn her opening remarks that evening last fall, Ms. Menendez exuded confidence, poise and glamour. The event was a triumph for the Menendezes, who hammed it up in selfies that Ms. Menendez shared the following morning.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
