        "text": "Ireland has been through, not a fair share, but an unfair share of trials and tribulations.\n\nNevertheless, the amazing people of Ireland fought through many unfortunate situations. Certainly-the journey was not an easy one, for it was a fight; it was a war. The films Bloody Sunday, In the Name of the Father, and Michael Collins, are merely reconstructions of Ireland’s fight for democracy, freedom, and peace. Important history of Ireland bleeds through these films as if the audience could be looking through the story-tellers eyes.\n\nHundreds of years ago, beginning around 1014 A.D. , Ireland faced many hardships in their fight for freedom. The IRA, or the Irish Republican Army, was formed many years later in 1922 to assist Ireland in their fight for independence . In the 1960’s a man named Terence O’Neill became a significant figure in the British government. O’Neill felt that if he wanted to deal with his own country’s economic decline, he would have to deal with the modernization Northern Ireland first. After a series of irrational decisions headed by O’Neill, “The Troubles” of the Irish continued (British Broadcasting Corporation). Many events erupted from this time; civil rights movements, riots, protests, and war.\n\nIn the Name of the Father\n\nIn the film, In the Name of the Father, it showed that Ireland wanted their independence as British troops invaded their streets. This feeling of oppression would drive the Irish communities to band together and fight (as it showed in the other two films as well). These relationships that the people formed were based off a wide range of emotions, from anger to hopefulness. In Bloody Sunday, the continuing mention of Catholic versus Protestants is a definite inclination that the disputes of these religions caused a lot of the battles. Sooner or later it became the Irish versus the British, and religious beliefs were mostly ignored. The people of Ireland let their passion overcome their logic. Obviously, the massacre of the Irish people led these overwhelming feelings to place blinds over many people’s eyes- which in the audience’s opinion would most likely be justifiable.\n\nMichael Collins\n\nIn Michael Collins, it seems as if each characters obsession to obtain what they thought to be right and justified-drove this conflict. This sometimes left not one clear vision of what was right and wrong. Being so blind by selfishness, many died in the process. For others (including the British), it was about power and control. One thing that was also made very clear was that in a time of war, it is difficult to have a relationship of any kind. This is an unfortunate message-but in their case-good advice. In the end, Michael loses Harry, Kitty loses them both, Dev loses himself, and Ireland loses a leader.\n\nThe balance in these films seems to be pretty one-sided. There are a few attempts to create another side to the story, but in the end the audience predominantly sees the Irish’s side. In the Name of the Father shows the involvement of non-Irish parties in favor of the “Free the Four” campaign. Although, this balance is not achieved as you see the story unfold with the British’s lies, deception, cruelty, and selfishness.\n\nBloody Sunday\n\nBloody Sunday attempts to show the two sides, but by the end the audience sees the tragedy the British inflicted on the Irish. There is one British soldier who attempts to see what is really happening, by questioning his leaders and their actions. You see this happening when he confronts his leaders by questioning the fact that he personally can’t see anyone with a gun. Unfortunately, in the end he lies when he reports for debriefing. He ends up repeating the same story as the rest of the soldiers; the story that they made up after they kept firing (after the cease-fire). In Michael Collins, there is somewhat of a balance, but again the audience mostly sees the Irish troubles and the British tyrants. Jordan (the director) certainly made it a point to get much more involved into the IRA. He created a picture of the IRA constantly fighting for freedom and democracy, as he also showed they fought under the British army’s oppression.\n\nRhetoric & Symbolism\n\nOne definition of the word film is “ A cinematographic representation of a story, drama, episode, event, etc.; a cinema performance” (Oxford English Dictionary). These three Irish films are representations of events, but also describing the events by using pictures and words. Michael Collins teaches the audience that some lessons cannot be learned. People, in general, will always fight for what they believe in-and there will be other people to fight back. The word “refuse” is used a lot in this film in a very powerful way. As Collins said,\n\nThey can jail us. They can shoot us. They can even conscript us! They can use us as cannon fodder in the Somme! But… we have a weapon more powerful… than any in the whole arsenal of the British Empire! That weapon… is our refusal! Our refusal to bow to any order but our own! (Script-O-Rama)\n\nIn Bloody Sunday, the Irish speak very differently compared to the British. The Irish seem to say words like, “peaceful”. The British speak of the Irish as if they were below the dirt they walked on. In one scene the British soldiers are speaking to each other and refer to the Irish people as “fuckers” and also said,\n\n“…let’s teach them a fucking lesson”.\n\nEarlier in the film the words that people use are already giving the audience a preconceived notion of how the film will end, for example an old woman states,\n\n“It’s going to be a terrible day”.\n\nThese words all have a great impact on the audience, but the scene where the British Army is shooting at innocent civilians is the most meaningful. Barney lies dead in the street and as Ivan discovers him, two other men come and lay a white sheet over his body with the words “CIVIL RIGHTS” inscribed on it. Soon, the sheet (or sign) was covered with blood. This is obviously symbolism for an innocent man who died for civil rights. In the Name of the Father used words like “Free the Four”. Even though there was only four (main) people who were on trial, they were on trial for their innocence. Which is another way of interpreting the Irish people being on trial for their innocence, freedom, and democracy. The use of trickery with words was also used in this film. When the British Forces were trying to (so violently) convince Gerry and his friends to confess to the bombing- they threatened to kill his father (who was also innocent). This was after they abused him and created a weak and vulnerable Gerry-which was the idea. Using these words as trickery is just a small dose of what all of the films were attempting to say about the British: that they lied, they kept secrets, and were trained to dispose of the Irish.\n\nConflict\n\nEach film also says many things about society. Conflict seems to be inevitable when there is control and power up for grabs, even at the disposal of others. Having military occupations in disputed territories apparently changes the rules. Some follow their superiors’ orders, and some follow their own. Certain soldiers even question why they are fighting, like in Bloody Sunday. Militant rebellion comes in different forms like marches, riots, protests, words, and refusal. Refusal can sum up all the forms of rebellion, as it did in Michael Collins. Nationalism appeared throughout every film in big doses. The fact that the Irish people were banded together for one main purpose shows the audience a great deal of nationalism. Fighting for freedom is not easy, and is also inevitable. Surely, it is beyond difficult to be imprisoned in your own country while freedom was being dangled right in front of you. Most of the characters in all of the films also had internal conflicts. Michael did not want to fall in love with Kitty. Harry did not want to admit he already knew Michael was in love with Kitty. Ivan could not deal with the weight of the world on his shoulders, after many people died during the ‘peaceful’ march. A British soldier could not make up his mind if what he was doing was right. Gerry could not forgive his father and Giuseppe could not forgive his son.\n\nThe Fight for Democracy\n\nThere is also much at stake for the characters in the films; family, dignity, beliefs, friends, and their lives. Collectively all of the characters were fighting for democracy and civil rights, but some of them were not thinking of what they (themselves) had at stake, but what others did. Michael, Ivan, and Gerry were the trend-setters for Irish civil rights. Michael thought of his followers. There was never a time in the movie when he was thoroughly worried about himself. Ivan also worried about his followers, he knew their lives were at stake. He knew from the beginning that there was a chance of something bad happening to these people, since earlier in the film the march was made illegal by the British government. This is why he was so adamant about having a peaceful march; he did not want anybody to get hurt. Gerry did not see the bigger picture in the beginning of the film. He was just a hippie-type who wanted peace…or was he? Later, you see Gerry’s true self revealed, especially right before his father passes away. He figured out (after a little convincing from his lawyer) that if his case was not dismissed, then the British government may always take advantage of the Irish people. He knew that much more was at stake than his life in prison.\n\nOne of the most important elements of these films was the emotion, drive, and motivation of the Irish people. This subject is exciting and interesting, for there are a variety of emotions that kept the fire going like love, courage, pride, passion, anger, pain, mistrust, regret, sorrow, justice, and God. It is important to remember that the Irish stayed very close to their prayers and to their religious beliefs. When the Irish people were threatened, so was their faith. The British Army were also driven by other things, like their government, the thrill to kill (for some), control, and power. In fact, the actual goal of the British Government was never made completely clear in any of the films.\n\nIn conclusion, all of these films were deep narratives that merely glanced into an important piece of Irish history. This history should not be forgotten, just as society will not forget basic civil rights. What also should not be forgotten are the differences and similarities of both parties involved. Both were driven by their emotions, which makes them somewhat similar in that light."
