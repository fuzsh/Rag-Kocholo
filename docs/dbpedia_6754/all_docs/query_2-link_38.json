        "text": "If you’ve followed my blog in the past, you’ll know that Call Me By Your Name was my favorite film of 2017. Beautifully directed by Luca Guadagnino and spearheaded by stars Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer, it owes much of its success to the phenomenal script by James Ivory, who deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The story, adapted from a novel by André Aciman, had plenty of challenges to overcome in order to make a compelling and watchable film. How does Ivory approach these hurdles and avoid clichés or melodrama to craft something so beautiful? Let’s dig deeper and find out!\n\nProving Grounds\n\nNormally when you’re dealing with an LGBT coming-of-age film like this, there are outside forces trying to keep our protagonist(s) down. Whether it’s disapproval from their parents, or a homophobic bully, or religion, or whatever else, often there is something substantial standing between our heroes and their desires. Call Me By Your Name has none of that, and in fact prides itself on its distinct lack of antagonism. How, then, does the film create tension and drive the plot forward without such outside forces acting upon the protagonist(s)?\n\nIn the first half of the film, Elio and Oliver are clearly attracted to one another but put up fronts to disguise their true feelings. What results is a coy sort of competition between them, to see whether the other is worthy of their attention and if they themselves can stack up to expectation. This helps to establish tension early on between the characters; even though nothing is preventing them from getting together immediately, they both have reason for caution and patience in earning affection from the other.\n\nBoth Elio and Oliver seek to flaunt their own skills to one another whenever the opportunity arises. Oliver is the first to do so during a conversation with Elio’s father, in order to demonstrate his academic knowledge:\n\nElio gets an opportunity later on to show off his musical prowess, when Oliver asks him to play a song for him on the piano:\n\nSimilar to their personal talents, Elio and Oliver often use their sexuality as a means of self-expression while vying for each other’s attentions. While Call Me By Your Name tells the story of a gay romance, it isn’t explicitly a homosexual movie. Elio and Oliver could more accurately be described as bisexual or pansexual, attracted to men and women alike. And at the outset of the film, both of them are engaged in passionate flings with local female characters. Elio is involved with a sweet girl named Marzia, while Oliver takes a liking to young bombshell Chiara. Both characters seem eager to flaunt their heterosexual tendencies around one another, as though gauging what the other thinks about it.\n\nSimilar to Elio and Oliver’s attempts to prove their skills to one another, they seem to enjoy testing each other’s sexual prowess. Both try to act nonchalant about the exploits of the other, almost goading each other on while also casually bragging about their own experience:\n\nInterspersed with all of this is Elio’s journaling. He occasionally shares his thoughts on Oliver and how he’s trying to win his attention, sometimes expressing doubt or regret over how he is doing so. Did I act too harsh or nonchalant at this moment? Should I be more forthcoming in my desires? The tension of the first act is very much rooted in the awkwardness of young love, in the guessing-game of knowing when to show vulnerability and when to shield yourself from harm. We don’t need arbitrary obstacles between them to feel longing for these two people to get together…the simple dance of flirting and courtship is enough to drive the plot forward.\n\nFear of Rejection\n\nIn the second act, as Elio and Oliver begin acting more forward and honest about their feelings, we start to understand why they are so guarded about themselves. As young people, fear of embarrassment, shame, and rejection gives them pause, causes them to reconsider their feelings and whether or not to act upon them. It is as though James Ivory spends the first act posing the question, “What is the worst that could happen?”, then spends the second act outlining precisely what the worst might be.\n\nWhile Elio is the first to break the silence between them, Oliver does not immediately reciprocate the feelings. In some respects, it’s every young person’s nightmare: to profess your love for someone and have them shut you down. We see this first in their initial moment of “intimacy”:\n\nWe see this paralleled most clearly in Marzia, as Elio continues his courtship with her throughout the film. Marzia is in a very similar position in relation to Elio that Elio himself is in with Oliver: constantly trying to gauge his interest and deciding how much to share of herself with him.\n\nMarzia’s fears with Elio are exactly the same as Elio’s fears with Oliver. What if she gives all of herself to Elio and he rejects her? It gives her reason to keep the shields up and hide parts of herself from harm, in case her feelings are not reciprocated. And Ivory does not go easy on Marzia: while Elio and Oliver’s relationship begins to blossom, she remains a part of the story, forced to watch as an outsider, demonstrating the stakes of this story and the possibility of failure in the game of love.\n\nWhile we revel in the victory of Elio and Oliver’s relationship, we also feel badly for Marzia and Elio’s rejection of her. It’s a reminder of what could have been, and why our characters are so standoffish at the start. While we know Elio and Oliver could have hit it off from the beginning and enjoyed a long summer together, we understand the potential pain they are avoiding, leaving us feeling bittersweet and somewhat cynical about love in the process.\n\nIdentity and Possession\n\nSelf-expression and identity are crucial themes of Call Me By Your Name. As mentioned before, much of the tension of the film comes from trying to decide how much of yourself to reveal to other people, for fear that they won’t like the real you. Ivory takes this theme a step farther, exploring what it means to give yourself to other people and invite them into your life.\n\nIn fact, the very first moment of the film highlights this nicely. Elio is resentful of Oliver’s arrival at their home, because it means he will have to give up his bedroom for their guest:\n\nIt’s quite telling that Elio’s first impression of Oliver is that of a “usurper,” as though he has come to upend and invade Elio’s existence. It reveals his inner fear of losing himself to someone else’s influence. His room, in this case, is a stand-in for his identity, and Elio is irked by the fact that he has to literally open it up for someone else to come in and see.\n\nWe gradually learn that Elio has learned this cautious demeanor from his upbringing. The Perlman family is Jewish, a facet of the story that is more pronounced in the book than in the film, but it is omnipresent nonetheless. Although Elio and Oliver bond over their shared Jewish faith, their relationship to their heritage differs drastically.\n\nJudaism has a perilous history, fraught with oppression and guilt, making it a fitting character trait to demonstrate Elio and Oliver’s differences. While Oliver wears his heritage loud and proud on his chest (literally), Elio keeps it more guarded, unwilling to flaunt what makes him unique quite so brashly. Much like his ancestors, he is fearful to reveal his true identity aloud for fear of persecution, even if the stakes aren’t quite as high for him as for his predecessors.\n\nBut as time goes on, and Elio grows to envy Oliver’s unwavering confidence, he slowly begins to change his perspective on the matter. Ivory uses the Star of David necklace as a symbol to indicate Elio coming out of his shell more and becoming more willing to open himself up to others:\n\nThis is where the title of the film, Call Me By Your Name, comes into play. Many have questioned what the title means exactly, and no concrete answer has been given by the filmmakers, but to me it represents Elio and Oliver’s final dissolution of the barriers between them. The phrase is spoken in their most intimate moment, as they make love for the first time:\n\nBy taking each other’s names and pretending to be one another, Elio and Oliver indicate that they no longer fear opening themselves up to others and finding companionship. And how fitting that the Star of David makes its return at this point in the screenplay? It’s the moment where the question of identity meets its ultimate answer: our characters’ arcs have resolved, and they believe in the ability to give yourself over completely to another person and find happiness.\n\nPassage of Time\n\nThe closest thing the film has to a force of antagonism is time itself. Once Elio and Oliver overcome their initial awkwardness and testing stage, the only thing preventing them from being together forever is the impending end of the summer and both characters’ return to their normal lives. The film does a brilliant job of matching this by altering the pacing of the film in the latter stages.\n\nThe first two-thirds of the film is deliberately meandering and lazy. Not only does this give us time to drink in the beautiful scenery of northern Italy, it captures the nonchalant mood of teen summer vacation, free of worry or sorrow. Our characters are unattached and carefree; the passage of time does not concern them in the slightest, not yet old enough to understand how short and fleeting life truly is. In fact, some of the key moments of the film are prolonged to highlight this. Elio and Oliver’s flirting persists for pages and pages, a constant dance of will-they-won’t they. Even when they resolve to get together, we are forced to spend an agonizingly-long day in their shoes, waiting for the moment of intimacy to come, constantly checking the time like Elio. Ivory wants to relate the notion that, when our lives are carefree and boundless, time can slow to a crawl and every moment lingers on.\n\nBy contrast, the pacing of the third act is intentionally rushed. Whereas for the first two acts the plot meanders and our characters laze around scenic Italy, there’s a greater sense of urgency in the final chapter as Elio and Oliver try to cram in as much of a relationship that they can while they still have the chance. Elio and Oliver don’t consummate their love until pg. 58, and their whirlwind romance only lasts a mere 13 pages before Oliver is gone for good. It’s a bittersweet realization that the relationship we’ve been building towards for so long will be so short-lived, a realization that Elio himself undergoes. There’s an underlying feeling of regret at wasted time, as both characters know they could have been together longer if they’d just gotten over themselves at the start.\n\nThe setting of the film also changes abruptly, as Elio and Oliver take a short three-day vacation to Rome before Oliver’s departure. This is more of a technical commentary on the film than the screenplay, but director Luca Guadagnino complements this transition perfectly by depicting the narrow, claustrophobic aspects of the city to indicate how time is pressing upon these characters like a heavy weight. And again, Elio feels the pressure of time slipping away from them when Oliver dances with a group of party-goers on the street:\n\nElio is literally sickened by the thought that life will go on and Oliver will continue to share himself with other people in his absence. He’s confronted with the notion for the first time here and he can barely stand the thought of it.\n\nIt’s noteworthy that the film ends more abruptly than the book does. In the original story, nearly two decades go by and Elio and Oliver meet once more to rekindle their relationship. The film prefers to keep a shorter timeline (though director Guadagnino has hinted that a sequel could continue the story), but it does draw on the theme of time once more by shifting to the winter months six months later. Winter is often associated with death and stillness, as the summer passion of their relationship has faded and now things have settled to a dull quiet. But when Elio and Oliver speak on the phone, it’s clear that their feelings have not died completely:\n\nDespite the bittersweet ending of the relationship, the film keeps the door open that their passion will persevere. As Elio’s father says in his memorable speech, the two of them should not regret anything and should cherish every moment they had together because it was special and rare. While earlier in the film they fretted over whether they should feel badly for their actions and tread lightly around the topic of love, Elio and Oliver have now come to terms with it and resolve to “remember everything” rather than let the past die. While time might have gotten between them, it doesn’t lessen what they had and should not cause them pain.\n\nThe final shot of the film is by far the longest, over three minutes of a close-up on Elio taking in everything. Despite what you might assume, this moment was intended from the very beginning: Ivory indicates that the entire credits should play on Elio’s face, drawing specific attention to the passage of time. We’re invited to take in every emotion that Elio goes through in these final moments, not shy away from them…as Elio’s father suggests, we should take the good with the bad and cherish every moment, not shy away from them or hide them away from other people. The film is a celebration of love, and its ultimate message is that openness and a willingness to share yourself with others is the key to finding happiness.\n\nConclusion\n\nCall Me By Your Name is a beautiful film for many reasons…the cinematography, the locale, the acting, the directing, and of course the screenplay come together for a wonderful and touching experience. I was struck by just how much James Ivory was able to convey in so short a time frame (only 81 pages), seamlessly weaving multiple complex themes and emotions together in a simple story that speaks volumes beyond its means. And I think Ivory’s age is telling as well…at the tender age of 90, he is the oldest Oscar winner of all time. Despite his advanced age, he is able to inhabit the thoughts and emotions of a young person so well, implying that like our characters in the story, love and emotion never truly dies even as our bodies deteriorate, and they live on in our minds even once the throes of physical passion are done.\n\n-Austin Daniel\n\nAll images and script excerpts courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics."
