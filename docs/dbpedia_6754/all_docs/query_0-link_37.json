        "text": "SOME of the most enduring images of Ireland in the popular imagination of Americans have come from films. Some of these films are of average quality and imperfect in their historical accuracy, but many are excellent and effectively recreate the environment and compelling issues that Irishmen and women faced at different periods in their history. And since films are the media through which many Americans gain their impressions of Irish history, politics, and culture, they are worthy of consideration by historians for that reason alone.\n\nIn the last twenty years, the Irish film industry has experienced something of a renaissance. Apart from bringing their rich literary heritage to the screen, the Irish have used film and television to explore the most controversial aspects of their history and culture, from exposing the deepest wounds of the \"Troubles\" in Northern Ireland to challenging the social power and morality of traditional Irish Catholicism. Yet the Irish film industry has not been without its critics. Some have complained that Irish filmmakers who seek financial backing from Hollywood production companies for their medium-to-big budget films often cater to the conceits and tastes of American audiencesÂ—especially with regard to political topics. The profits of American distribution then offset the costs of production. The result, these critics say, is the presentation of a distorted and overly \"Americanized\" sense of Irishness combined with a one-sided and ill-informed view of Irish history (particularly of Northern Ireland's political troubles).\n\nYet in spite of such concerns, most would not question the rising levels of talent and sophistication both in front of and behind the camera. In recent years, many Irish films have received worldwide recognition for their quality and innovation while some Irish directors and actors have become international celebrities. The Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) and Northern Ireland Screen support and award superior achievement in the industry.\n\nBelow is a selection of films useful for complementing our study of politics and society in Modern Ireland. Most of these films are available on DVD or Blu-Ray at Watzek Library. You can also find many of them on streaming services. In addition to the list below you might consult the Irish in Film and Irish Film and Television Network (ITFN) web databases.\n\nSome information courtesy of Internet Movie Database.
