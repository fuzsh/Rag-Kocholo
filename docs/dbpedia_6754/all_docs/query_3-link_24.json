        "text": "Alfred Hitchcockâs classic thriller Rear Window was released nearly 65 years ago. Back then, Hitchcock was a controversial filmmaker just starting to make waves and build his influence in Hollywood; now, he is one of the most widely celebrated directors of the 20th century. At the time of its 1954 release, Rear Window emerged into a world freshly shaken by World War II. The fear of communism riddled American society and Cold War tensions were escalating between the two global superpowers, the USSR and USA. Traditional gender stereotypes and marital roles were beginning to be challenged, yet the âold wayâ continued to prevail. The culture of the 1950s could hardly be more different to what it is today. Within the Western world, the birth of the 21st century has marked the decline of cemented expectations and since been replaced by social equality regardless of gender, sexual preference and age. So why, six decades after its original release and in a world where much of its content appears superficially outdated, do we still analyse the film Rear Window?\n\nRear Window is a film primarily concerned with the events which L.B. (Jeff) Jefferies, a photographer incapacitated by an accident which broke his leg, observes from the window of his apartment. He spends his days watching the happenings of the Greenwich Village courtyard, which enables Jeff to peer into the apartments and lives of local residents. The curiosities which exist in such an intimate setting fulfil Jeffâs instinctual need to watch. The act of observing events from a secure distance is as tempting as reality television and magazines. To this day, these mediums provide entertainment tailored to popular culture. At its roots, Jeffâs role as a voyeur within Rear Window is designed to satisfy his intense boredom in a state of injury. As the film is seen through Jeffâs voyeuristic eyes, the audience become voyeurs within their own right. Until relations between Thorwald and his wife simmer into territory fraught with danger, Jeffâs actions are the harmless activities of a man searching for entertainment.\n\nSo, if Rear Window teaches us that voyeurism is a dangerous yet natural desire, does the film comment on the individuals who consent to being watched? Within Greenwich Village, Jeffâs chance to act as an observer is propelled by the indifference of those he observes. Almost without exception, his neighbours inadvertently permit Jeffâs eyes wandering into their apartments by leaving their blinds up. The private elements of othersâ lives, including their domestic duties, marital relations and indecencies, are paraded before Jeff. Greenwich Village is his picture show and its residents willingly raise the stageâs curtains. This presentation of Hitchcockâs 1954 statement remains relevant today. Jeffâs neighboursâ consent to his intrusion into their lives bears striking similarities to current indifference. The prevalence of social media enables information to be gathered as soon as its users click the âAccept Terms & Conditionsâ button. Rear Window is a commentary on social values and provokes its audience to examine habits of their own, especially in a world where sensitive information is at our fingertips. Just as Hitchcockâs 1954 characters invite perversive eyes to inspect their lives, society today is guilty of the same apathy.\n\nThe characters of Hitchcockâs thriller are a pivotal element of the filmâs construction. They add layers of depth to the text and fulfil roles central to the plotâs development. One of Hitchcockâs fundamental directorial decisions was leaving multiple characters unnamed â within Greenwich Village alone, we meet Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso and Miss Hearing Aid. The stereotypical nature of these labels, based on superficial traits that Jeff observes from his window, exemplifies the sexism prevalent in the 1950s. Jeffâs knowledge of these women is limited to such an extent that he does not know their names, yet considers himself qualified enough to develop labels for each of them. The historical background of stereotypes is imbedded within Rear Window and shares vast similarities with the stereotypes we recognise today.\n\nHitchcockâs 1954 thriller Rear Window portrays a little world that represents the larger one. Its themes, primarily voyeurism, and character profiles illustrate Hitchcockâs societal messages and provide a running commentary on issues which govern America during the 1950s. In the six decades since the filmâs release, the Western world has undergone significant developments both socially and culturally. L.B (Jeff) Jefferiesâ perception of women and married life is inconsistent with the relations between men and women that we observe today. Regardless, the timeless views that Hitchcockâs conveys through Rear Window continue to speak volumes about our society. Jeffâs voyeurism, which comprises much of the filmâs major plotline, is a channel for Hitchcock to comment about the instinctual desire for individuals to observe others. Additionally, Hitchcock delves into the flip side of this matter, presenting the theory that those he watches are just as guilty of allowing his intrusion into their private lives. Apathetic mindsets in todayâs digital world are responsible for the same indifference that Hitchcock explores within his film. Letâs not forget the sexist stereotypes that Jeff develops to label certain women within Greenwich Village. Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso and Miss Hearing Aid are all victims of Jeffâs narrow mindset towards women, emphasised by these superficial and demeaning names. Stereotypes remain as apparent within society today as they were within the world of Rear Window and can be identified within the mediaâs diverse presentation of social issues. It is easy to assume that Hitchcockâs 1954 thriller, Rear Window, lacks the relevancy we expect from films. Contrary to this perception, its ingrained messages are fundamentally true to this day.\n\nUpdated 14/12/2020\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nDefinition of Metalanguage\n\nExamples of Metalanguage in VCE English\n\nConclusion\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAlthough it appears on criteria sheets, many students never really understand the termÂ metalanguage. Strangely, it is something that is rarely addressed in classrooms. While the word may be foreign to you, rest assured that metalanguage is not an entirely new concept you have to learn. How come? Because you have been unknowingly using metalanguage since the very beginning of high school.\n\nIt's a word that is more and more frequently thrown around as you get more advanced in high school. And, it's something that becomes tremendously important in your final year of high school, because the more you include metalanguage discussion in your essays, the more intricate your discussion becomes and the more unique it also becomes.\n\nSo, let's find out exactly what metalanguage is.\n\n2. Definition of Metalanguage\n\nMetalanguage isÂ language that describes language.\n\nSo, instead of maybe using the word, \"He was sad\", we might say something like, \"He felt sorrowful\". The choice in words changes the meaning that is interpreted by the reader, just slightly, but there is still a difference. So, when it comes to studying texts or reading articles, and trying to analyze what the author is trying to do, we look at metalanguage as a way to help give us insight into the ideas that they're trying to portray.\n\nThe simplest way to explain this is to focus on part 3 of the English exam â Language Analysis. In Language Analysis, we look at the authorâs writing and label particular phrases with persuasive techniques such as: symbolism, imagery or personification. Through our description of the way an author writes (via the words âsymbolismâ, âimageryâ or âpersonificationâ), we have effectively used language that describes language.\n\nNow, if we look at the bigger picture, our analysis of an authorâs language can be applied to Text Response, and even Reading and Comparing. To learn more about why metalanguage is important in Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response. Otherwise, for those interested in Comparative, head over to our Ultimate Guide to VCE Comparative.\n\n3. Examples of Metalanguage in VCE English\n\nNovel\n\nTone\n\nNarrator\n\nGrammar and punctuation\n\nCharacterisation\n\nForeshadowing\n\nFor example\n\nAchilles isÂ characterised as a foetus, for his position is âchin down, shoulders hunchedâ as though he isÂ inside a womb.Â (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve*, Mankiewicz foreshadows Eve's sinful and regretful actions, as a sorrowful expression is emphasized as she accepts her award\n\nAs you can see, the word 'foreshadows' pushes us in a new direction. Rather than just saying what has already happened or telling your teacher or examiner something that they already know, it forces you to actually analyze what's in front of you and to offer your own unique interpretation of why this metalanguage or why this technique has been used.\n\n*If you happen to be studying this text, check out our All About Eve Character Profiles.\n\nFilm\n\nMise-en-scene\n\nCamera angles\n\nMusic\n\nLighting\n\nFor example\n\nWhen Terry leaves Friendlyâs bar, the thick fog symbolises his clouded moral judgement as he decides whether he should remain âD and Dâ, or become a âratâ. (On the Waterfront, Elia Kazan)\n\nPlay\n\nStage direction\n\nSoliloquy\n\nMonologue\n\nProp\n\nMotifs\n\nFor example\n\nThe miniature set Zac creates is designed with a white backdrop, symbolising his desire to wipe away reality since he âcanât stand real things'. (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nIn Medea, the motif of animals emphasizes the inhuman and bestial nature of Medea, highlighting how she defies natural norms.\n\nThis student has actually given us an analysis of why animal motifs are used. And that is to highlight how Medea defies natural norms, because of her inhuman and bestial nature.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs indicated earlier, you should be familiar with many, if not all the terms mentioned above. Take note that some metalanguage terms are specific to a writing form, such as camera angle for films. If you need help learning new terms, we have you covered - be sure to check out our metalanguage word banks for books and our metalanguage wordbank for films.\n\nAs you discuss themes or characters, you should try and weave metalanguage throughout your body paragraphs. The purpose of this criteria is to demonstrate your ability to understand how the author uses language to communicate his or her meaning. The key is to remember that the authorâs words or phrases are always chosen with a particular intention â it is your job to investigate why the author has written a text in a particular way.\n\n[Modified Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys, welcome back to Lisa's Study Guides. Today, I'm really excited to talk to you about metalanguage. Have you guys ever heard of metalanguage before? It's a word that is more and more frequently thrown around as you get more advanced in high school. And, it's something that becomes tremendously important in your final year of high school, because the more you include metalanguage discussion in your essays, the more intricate your discussion becomes and the more unique it also becomes. So, let's find out exactly what is metalanguage.\n\nSimply put, metalanguage just means language that analyses language. When authors write anything, we make certain decisions when it comes to writing. So, instead of maybe using the word, \"He was sad\", we might say something like, \"He felt sorrowful\". The choice in words changes the meaning that is interpreted by the reader, just slightly, but there is still a difference. So, when it comes to studying texts or reading articles and trying to analyse what the author is trying to do, we look at metalanguage as a way to help give us insight into the ideas that they're trying to portray.\n\nMetalanguage comes in really handy, especially if you're somebody who struggles with retelling the story - I have a video on how to avoid retelling the story, which you can watch. Metalanguage essentially takes you to the next level. It prevents you from just saying what happened, and forces you into actually looking at how the ideas and themes are developed by the author through the words that they choose to use. So, let's have a look at a couple of examples to give you a better idea. I'm going to show you two examples. One uses metalanguage and one doesn't, and you'll see how a massive difference in how the student understands the text is really clear.\n\nNumber one, foreshadowing.\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve, Mankiewicz emphasizes Eve's sorrowful expression as she accepts her award.\n\nVersus\n\nIn the first scene of All About Eve, Mankiewicz foreshadows Eve's sinful and regretful actions, as a sorrowful expression is emphasized as she accepts her award.\n\nAs you can see, as soon as we put in the word foreshadows, it pushes us in a new direction. Rather than just saying what has already happened or telling your teacher or examiner something that they already know, it forces you to actually analyse what's in front of you and to offer your own unique interpretation of why this metalanguage or why this technique has been used. So, in this case, it's foreshadowing.\n\nâ\n\nLet's have a look at another one, motif.\n\nIn Medea, Euripides commonly refers to animals when describing Medea's actions and temperament.\n\nVersus\n\nIn Medea, the motif of animals emphasizes the inhuman and bestial nature of Medea, highlighting how she defies natural norms.\n\nSee how, in the first example, it was really just telling you what we might already know through just reading the book, but when it comes to the second example, this student has actually given us an analysis of why animal motifs are used. And that is to highlight how Medea defies natural norms, because of her inhuman and bestial nature.\n\nSo, those are some examples of metalanguage. There are so many more different types of metalanguage out there...\n\nRansom and Invictus are studied as part of VCE English's Comparative.

The film follows President Mandelaâs attempt to infuse a deeply divided country with new energy, by supporting the South African rugby teamâs victorious 1995 World Cup Campaign. The unlikely bond formed between President Mandela and Francois Pienarr, the captain of the rugby team, illustrates themes of unity and reconciliation in a divided nation. The film begins with the image of a deeply divided society in 1990, as Mandela is released from 27 years of incarceration. A poignant opening scene sees Mandela drive along a long dirt road that runs between two playing fields, on one side, young black children shout excitedly as Mandela passes. On the other side, immaculately dressed white boys stare vacantly, as their coach proclaims, âThis is the day our country went to the dogs.â This tumultuous period in South African history is of central concern to âInvictusâ, as Eastwood portrays the lingering racial prejudices imbedded in this society. The film portrays the tension between the bitter resentment of black South Africans towards their former oppressors, with the fear and uncertainty of white Afrikaners under Mandelaâs political leadership. Eastwood masterfully depicts the true story of the moment when Nelson Mandela harnessed the power of sports to unite a deeply divided South Africa.\n\nRansom\n\nSet during the Trojan War, one of the most famous events in Greek mythology, David Maloufâs historical fiction âRansomâ seeks to explore the overwhelming destruction caused by war, and the immense power of reconciliation. Drawing on the Iliad, the epic poem by Homer, Malouf focuses on the events of one day and night, in which King Priam of Troy travels to the enemy Greek encampment to plead with the warrior Achilles to release the body of his son, Hector. Maddened by grief at the murder of his friend Patroclus, Achilles desecrates the body of Hector as revenge. Despite Achilles refusal to give up Hectorâs body, Priam is convinced there must be a way of reclaiming the body â of pitting new ways against the old, and forcing the hand of fate. Maloufâs fable reflects the epic themes of the Trojan war, as fatherhood, love, grief and pride are expertly recast for our times.\n\nMalouf and Eastwood both depict societies on the brink: Troy faces annihilation by the Greeks, while South Africa faces an uncertain future as it emerges from the injustices of the apartheid era, both worlds are in dire need of true heroes to bridge the great divide. Together, these two texts echo the significance of hope in the enactment of change. To learn more, head over to our full Ransom Study Guide (covers themes, characters, chapter summaries, quotes and more).\n\nThemes\n\nThe power of shared human experiences\n\nBoth texts are centrally concerned with the significance of the universal experiences of love, loss, grief and hope to unite a divided people. Both Invictus and Ransom explore how societal forces divide people into different, often conflicting groups â whether this be race, history, culture, or war. Each text appeals to the universal experiences that define the human condition, and emphasise the significance of opportunities to cross-cultural divides.\n\nIn âRansomâ, Malouf is centrally concerned with the theme of fatherhood. This concept links the mortal and godly realms, which King Priam straddles over the course of his journey. The relationship between Priam and Somax illustrates this complex theme most clearly. The two men, despite being deeply separated by their class, education and power, share their common familial experiences. Priam confronts the poignancy of their shared experience of losing sons, questioning whether it âmeant the same for him as it did for the driverâ. Malouf thus presents Priam as initially lacking in terms of his understanding, Somaxâs friendship and stories are the catalyst for Priam to engage in deeper, empathetic understanding. Somaxâs trivial yet symbolically significant story about the griddle-cakes represents a moment of anagnorisis for Priam, wherein the shared bond of humanity in fatherhood allows Priam to obtain insight, and progressively grow as a human and as a leader. This incident fuels the journey to appeal to Achilles âman to manâ, Priamâs insight into the power of empathy allows him to appeal to their shared bond as suffering fathers.\n\nJust as Priam goes to Achilles âas a fatherâ, using their common quality, fatherhood, to further understand each other, Mandela, too, emphasises the point that you must âknow [your] enemy before [you] c[an] prevail against himâ and thus he âlearned their language, read their books, their poetryâ. Mandela attempts to unite Black and white South Africans, despite the mutual animosity and distrust fostered by decades of apartheid. Black and White South Africans share almost nothing in common, with significant cultural and societal barriers to their reconciliation, including different dialects. Rugby emerges as the most poignant manifestation of this divide as the White South Africans support their national team, but the black south Africans barrack for the opposing side. The scene wherein Pienarr and Mandela meet over tea is symbolic of this sentiment of fostering unity amongst deep divisions. President Mandela literally hunches over to pour the tea for Pienaar, this inversion of status demonstrates his willingness to reduce his dignity as a superior and speak with Pienarr, and by extension, white south Africans, on an equal level, modelling an example of how race relations in his nation should be carried out. This equality is also symbolised by the passing of the tea to Pienaar, the close up shot where both arms of the individuals are depicted on an equal level reinforces this sense of mutual equality and respect, extolling the virtues of empathy and integrity as a uniting force.\n\nLeadership and Sacrifice\n\nMandela and Priam symbolise how leadership must inevitably entail familial sacrifices. Both leaders self-identify with their nation and people. Priam embodies Troy itself, his body is the âliving mapâ of the kingdom. The âroyal sphereâ he embodies is constrained by customs and tradition, full of symbolic acts that separate him from the mortal world. To an extent, these royal obligations and ritual suffocate Priamâs individuality and he is unable to show his true nature, or connect with his family in the way he would desire to. He regards intimate relationships with his children as âwomenâs talkâ that âunnerves himâ as it is not âhis sphereâ. This articulation of the disassociation of the âroyal sphereâ with natural human bonds of family reveals the secondary role that family and love must take when oneâs role as a leader is paramount. Similarly, Mandela claims âI have a very big family. Forty-two million peopleâ. Unlike Priam, Mandela seeks human connection, predicating his leadership on democratic ideals. This takes a physical and emotional toll, as shown by Mandelaâs collapse in his driveway. The cost of leadership here is evident, as Mandela has effectively sacrificed his family for the good of his nation. His strained relationship with his daughter Zindzi further reinforces this, as she disapproves of Mandela reaching out to Pienarr, likening him to one of the white âpoliceman who forced (her) out of her homeâ, showing the disconnect between father and daughter due to the sacrifices necessitated by Mandelaâs life of leadership, including his 27 year imprisonment.\n\nFatherhood and Masculinity\n\nIn âRansomâ Malouf presents an enclosed, limited and unemotional masculine world, with particularly stringent expectations for menâs behaviour. This is a world characterised by war, wherein the expectations of violent masculinity are paramount. In presenting Achilles inside of âa membrane stretched to a fine transparencyâ, Malouf reveals the constant tension between the emotional, domestic human nature inside Achilles and the hierarchical violent external society that he is expected to abide by, revealing the constricting nature that the society has on defining menâs actions. Malouf uses words like âknottedâ and ârope-likeâ when describing Achillesâ muscles, implying that his conventional great strength, the source of his fearsome reputation, represents a confinement that the society enforces on him and other men. Further, through a degree of compassion, Priam is able to touch the âsore spot whose ache he has long repressedâ in Achilles, a symbol of the emotions that have been supressed by the dominant patriarchal nature of this society.\n\nWhilst the world of âInvictusâ is less overtly masculine and patriarchal, the narrative of the film is primarily focused on the male experiences, with female characters assuming a largely secondary role. Zindziâs strained relationship with her father exemplifies the sacrifices involved in leadership. Whilst Mandela is seen to have sacrificed a close connection with his daughter, this is suggested to be in service of the nation, âI have a big family. Forty two million peopleâ.\n\nCharacter analysis and comparison\n\nCharacter analysis/Comparison\n\nPriam\n\n- aging king of troy\n\n- individuality has been subsumed by the ceremonial functions of his high position\n\n- self-identifies with nation\n\n- life of obligation\n\n- foregoes convention and embraces chance with his proposal to offer ransom for his sonâs body\n\n- becomes more attuned to the natural world\n\n- gains a greater appreciation of his true self as a man, rather than a symbolic figurehead\n\nMandela\n\n- historic figure, symbol of peace\n\n- spent 27 years in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government while he was trying to gain civil rights for all south Africans\n\n- tackled institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality\n\n- suffered under apartheid\n\n- pursues reconciliation, prepared to face down calls for retribution\n\n- in his speech to the sports council, he defends the traditions of the people who persecuted him\n\n- interacts easily with people of all social standings\n\n- charismatic, in touch with the people\n\nComparison\n\n- embody essential role that leadership plays in achieving just resolutions to conflict\n\n- sacrifice family for leadership\n\n- illustrate that effective leadership takes a toll on the individual\n\n- exemplify that reconciliation requires unexpected and difficult acts.

The lingering tension between the two groups permeates the entirety of the film, and the microcosm of the bodyguards acts as a symbol of the chasm within the wider nation.\n\n- The deeply symbolic scene wherein Mandela and Pienaar have tea, Eastwood strategically uses a close up shot to frame the passing of the tea cup so that both arms of the individuals are depicted on the same level, reinforcing this sense of mutual equality and respect. It is this sharing of hope that ignites Pienaar to reciprocate Mandelaâs egalitarian actions. As Pienaar brings a ticket for Eunice, recognising that âthereâs a fourthâ family member, he mimics Mandelaâs value that âno one is invisibleâ. Consequently, it is demonstrated that regardless of skin colour, characters reciprocate Mandelaâs empathy and compassion, revealing the limitless power such human qualities to reach across the boundaries of division.\n\n- The wide shot of the passing of the trophy from Mandela to Pienaar is framed against the large crowd, metaphorically representing South Africaâs support with the unity of the black and whites, reflecting Mandelaâs desire to âmeet black aspirations and quell white fearsâ. Their diegetic cheers work to create the idyllic depiction of the lasting power of this change, implying the true limitless nature of hope in their society.\n\nâ\n\nLearn more through Caleb (English study score 47) about Invictus Film Technique Analysis - How Can I Write About It?\n\nRansom\n\n- Priamâs moment of anagnorisis in which he discovers the concept of âchanceâ, marks the beginning of his enactment of change through the power of hope.

The 1920s saw significant economic growth after WWI, and whatâs more American than material excess, wealth, and prosperity? The stock market was going off, businesses were booming, and people were having a great time.\n\nWell, not everybodyâand on the flipside, whatâs more American than socio-economic inequality or the ever-quixotic American Dream?\n\nIn this blog, weâll go through the novel in this context, examine some of its key themes, and also have a think about the critiques it raises about American society. Weâll also go through an essay prompt that ties some of these things together.\n\nLife in the Roaring Twenties\n\nThis snapshot from the 2013 film adaptation actually tells us a lot about the 1920s. On the one hand, social and cultural norms were shiftingâmen no longer sported beards, and women were dressing more androgynously and provocatively. On the other hand, the modern, American economy was emergingâpeople began buying costly consumer goods (like cars, appliances, telephones etc.) using credit rather than cash. This meant that average American families were able to get these things for the first time, while more prosperous families were able to live in extreme excess.\n\nIn Fitzgeraldâs novel, the Buchanans are one such family. Tom and his wife Daisy have belonged to the 1% for generations, and the 1920s saw them cement their wealth and status. At the same time, the booming economy meant that others (like the narrator Nick) were relocating to cities in pursuit of wealth, and (like Gatsby) making significant financial inroads themselves.Â\n\nThe Great Gatsby traces how the differences between these characters can be destructive even if theyâre all wealthy. Add a drop of Gatsbyâs unrequited love for Daisy, and you have a story that ultimately examines how far people go for romance, and what money simply canât buy.Â\n\nThe answer to that isnât so obvious though. Yes, money canât buy love, but it also canât buy a lot of other things associated with the lifestyle and the values of established wealth. Weâll get into some of this now.\n\nWealth and class\n\nFitzgerald explores tensions between three socio-economic classesâthe establishment, the ânouveau richeâ and the working class.\n\nTom and Daisy belong to the âold moneyâ establishment, where wealth is generational and inherited. This means they were born into already wealthy families, which affects their upbringing and ultimately defines them, from the way they speak (Tomâs âpaternal contemptâ and Daisyâs voice, âfull of moneyâ) to their major life decisions (including marriage, symbolised through the âstring of pearlsâ he buys for herâwhich, fun fact, is estimated to be worth millions of dollars today). It also affects their values, as weâll see in the following section.Â\n\nFor now, consider this image of their home (and those ponies on the left, which they also own), described as follows:\n\nâThe lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for [400 metres], jumping over sun-dials and brick walls and burning gardensâfinally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.â\n\nNick Carraway also comes from a similar (though not as extravagant) backgroundâhis family had been rich by Midwestern standards for âthree generationsâ before he came to New York.\n\nConversely, Gatsby belongs to the ânouveau richeâ, or new money. Unlike the Buchanans, Gatsby was born into a poor family, only coming to wealth in the 1920s boom. Specifically, he inherited money from Dan Cody after running away from home at 17.\n\nAlthough they are all rich, there are significant cultural differences between old and new money. Old money have their own culture of feigned politeness which Gatsby doesnât quite get. When Tom and the Sloanes invite Nick and Gatsby to supper in chapter six, Gatsby naively accepts, to which Tom would respond behind his back, âDoesnât he know [Mrs. Sloane] doesnât want him?â Even though Gatsby is financially their equal, his newfound wealth canât buy his way into their (nasty, horrible) lifestyle.\n\nFinally, this is contrasted with the working class, particularly George and Myrtle Wilson who we meet in chapter two. They live in a grey âvalley of ashesâ, the detritus of a prosperous society whose wealth is limited to the 1%. Fitzgerald even calls it a âsolemn dumping groundâ, suggesting that life is precarious and difficult here. Consider what separates Georgeââblond, spiritlessâ¦ and faintly handsomeââfrom Tom (hint: $$).\n\nMyrtle is described differently, howeverâshe is a âfaintly stoutâ woman with âperceptible vitalityâ. This may be less of a description of her and more of a commentary on Tomâs sexuality, and what attracts him to her such that he cheats on Daisy with her. Still, Myrtleâs relative poverty is evident in her expressions of desire throughout their meetingââI want to get one of those dogs,â she says, and Tom just hands her the money.\n\nUltimately, looking at the novel through the lens of class, we see a society where upward social mobility and making a living for yourself is possible, just not for everybody. Even when you get rich, it doesnât guarantee that youâll suddenly, seamlessly integrate into the lives of old money.Â\n\nMorality and values\n\nAdded to this story of social stratification is a moral dimension, where Fitzgerald can be a little more critical.Â\n\nFirstly, old money is portrayed as shallow. Daisyâs marriage to Tom and the Sloanesâ insincerity are elements of this, but another good example is Gatsbyâs party guests. Many arenât actually invitedâthey invite themselves, and âthey came and went without having met Gatsby at all.â Their vacuous relationship to Gatsby is exposed when he dies, and they completely abandon him. Klipspringer, âthe boarderâ, basically lived in Gatsbyâs house, and even then he still wouldnât come to the funeral, only calling up to get a âpair of shoesâ back.Â\n\nThe rich are also depicted as cruel and inconsiderate, insulated from repercussions by their wealth. Nickâs description of Tomâs âcruel bodyâ is repeatedly realised, as he breaks Myrtleâs nose in chapter two and condescends Gatsby with âmagnanimous scornâ in chapter seven. After Myrtle dies, Nick spots the Buchanans âconspiringâ and describes them as âsmash[ing] up things and creatures and then retreat[ing] back into their money or their vast carelessnessââhe sees them as fundamentally selfish.\n\nGatsby is portrayed more sympathetically though, which may come from his humble upbringing and his desire to be liked. This is probably the key question of the novelâis he a hero, or a villain? The moral of the story, or a warning? Consumed by love, or corrupted by wealth?\n\nIâm going to leave most of those for the next section, but Iâll finish here with one last snippet: Lucille, a guest at his parties, tears her dress and Gatsby immediately sends her a ânew evening gownâ. Weird flex, but at least heâs being selflessâ¦\n\nHonesty\n\nThat said, a major part of Gatsbyâs character is his dishonesty, which complicates his moral identity.Â\n\nFor starters, he fabricates a new identity and deals in shady business just to reignite his five-year-old romance with Daisy. We see this through the emergence of Meyer Wolfsheim, with whom he has unclear business âgonnegtionsâ, and the resultant wealth he now enjoys.Â\n\nIn chapter three, Owl Eyes describes Gatsby as a âregular Belascoâ, comparing him to a film director who was well-known for the realism of his sets. This is a really lucid analysis of Gatsby, who is in many ways just like a film director constructing a whole fantasy world.\n\nItâs also unclear if he loves Daisy for who she is, or just the idea of Daisy and the wealth she represents. Indeed, he doesnât seem to treat her as a person, but more like something that he can pursue (like wealth). This is a good read, so I wonât really get into it hereâjust consider how much things have changed since Gatsby first met Daisy (like her marriage and her children), and how Gatsby ignores the way her life has changed in favour of his still, stationary memory of who she used to be.\n\nLove, desire and hope\n\nAll of this makes it tricky to distil what the novelâs message actually is.Â\n\nIs it that Gatsby is a good person, especially cast against the corrupt old money?Â\n\nThis analysis isnât wrong, and it actually works well with a lot of textual evidence. Where Nick resents the Buchanans, he feels sympathy for Gatsby. He explicitly says, âtheyâre a rotten crowdâ¦youâre worth the whole damn bunch put together.â Maybe love was an honourable goal compared to money, which ostensibly makes you âcruelâ and âcarelessâ.Â\n\nI wouldnât say he was cruel, but this reading is complicated by how he can be careless, choosing not to care about Daisyâs agency, and letting his desires overtake these considerations.Â\n\nIs it that Gatsby and his desire for Daisy were corrupted by wealth despite his good intentions?Â\n\nThereâs also evidence to suggest wealth corruptsâNick describes it as âfoul dustâ that âpreyedâ on Gatsby, eroding his good character and leaving behind someone who resembles the vacuous elite. Although love mightâve been an honourable goal, it got diluted by money.Â\n\nGatsbyâs paradigm for understanding the world becomes driven by materialism, and he objectifies Daisy. He starts trying to buy something that he originally didnât need to buyâDaisyâs love. She certainly didnât fall in love with this man who owned a mansion and a closet full of âbeautiful shirts.â Thus, Gatsby is a sympathetic product of a system that was always stacked against him (a poor boy from North Dakota). Capitalism, right?\n\nIs it that capitalist America provides nothing for people to pursue except for wealth, and therefore little reason for people to feel hope?\n\nWellâ¦\n\nPast the basics: structural economic tension and the doomed American Dream\n\nNow we want to start thinking beyond the characters (e.g. if Gatsby is a good person or not) and also factor in their social, historical, political and economic context (e.g. if he was doomed to begin with by a society driven by money). This subheading does sound a bit much, but weâll break it down here.Â\n\nA key part of this novel is the American Dream, the idea that America is a land of freedom and equal opportunity, that anyone can âmake itâ if they truly try. Value is placed on upward social mobility (moving up from a working-class background) and economic prosperity (making $$), which defined much of the Roaring 20sâ¦\n\nâ¦for some.Â\n\nFor many others, there was significant tension between these lofty values and their lived reality of life on the ground. As much as society around them was prospering, they just couldnât get a piece of the pie, and this is what makes it structuralâas hard as George Wilson might work, he just canât get himself out of the Valley of Ashes and into wealth. Indeed, you canât achieve the Dream without cheating (as Gatsby did).Â\n\nSo, thereâs this tension, this irreconcilable gap between economic goals and actual means. Through this lens, the tragedy of The Great Gatsby multiplies. Itâs no longer just about someone who canât buy love with moneyâitâs about how nobodyâs dreams are really attainable. Not everyone can get money, and money can only get you so far. Everyone is stuck, and the American Dream is basically just a myth.Â\n\nThus, the novel could be interpreted as a takedown of capitalist America, which convinced people like Gatsby that the answer to everything was money, and he bolted after the âgreen lightâ allure of cold, hard cash only to find out that it wasnât enough, that it wasnât the answer in the end.Â (.\n\nConsider what kind of message that sends to people like the Wilsonsâif money canât actually buy happiness, what good is it really to chase it? And remember that Gatsby had to cheat to get rich in the first place.Â\n\nIs [the novelâs message] that capitalist America provides nothing for people to pursue except for wealth, and therefore little reason for people to feel hope?\n\nYou tell me.\n\nPrompt: what does Fitzgerald suggest about social stratification in the 1920s?\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nLetâs try applying this to a prompt. Iâll italicise the key points that have been brought up throughout this post.Â\n\nFirstly, social stratification clearly divided society along economic lines. This could be paragraph one, exploring how class separated the Buchanans and Wilsons of the world, and how their lifestyles were so completely different even though they all lived in the prosperity of the Roaring 20s. George Wilson was âworn-outâ from work, but he still couldnât generate upward social mobility for his family, stuck in the Valley of Ashes. Conversely, Tom Buchanan is born into a rich family with his beach-facing mansion and polo ponies. Colour is an important symbol hereâthe Valley is grey, while East Egg is filled with colour (a green light here, a âblue coupeâ thereâ¦).\n\nThe next paragraph might look at the cultural dimension, exploring how you just canât buy a way of life. This might involve analysing Gatsbyâs wealth as deluding him into thinking he can ârepeat the pastâ by buying into the life(style) of old money. This is where Fitzgerald disillusions us about the American Dreamâhe presents a reality where it isnât possible for anyone to âmake itâ, where the Buchanans still treat you with scorn even if youâre just as wealthy. Gatsbyâs dishonesty is ultimately a shallow oneâtry as he might, he just cannot fit in and win Daisy back.\n\nFinally, we should consider the moral dimensionâeven though the wealthier socioeconomic classes enjoyed more lavish, luxurious lifestyles, Fitzgerald also argued that they were the most morally bankrupt. Money corrupted the wealthy to the point where they simply did not care about the lives of the poor, as seen in the Buchanansâ response to Myrtleâs death. Even Gatsby had to compromise his integrity and deal in shady business in order to get richâhe isnât perfect either. Social stratification may look ostentatious and shiny on the outside, but the rich are actually portrayed as shallow and corrupt.Â\n\nA good essay on this novel will typically combine some of these dimensions and build a multilayered analysis. Stratification, love, wealth, moralityâall of these big ideas can be broken down in terms of social, economic, cultural circumstances, so make sure to consider all angles when you write.Â\n\nHave a go at these prompts!\n\n1. Nick is biased in his assessment of Gatsbyâboth of them are no better than the corrupt, wealthy Buchanans. Do you agree?\n\n2. In The Great Gatsby, money is a stronger motivating factor than love. Do you agree?\n\n3. Daisy Buchanan is more innocent than guiltyâexplore this statement with reference to at least 2 other characters.Â\n\n4. What does Fitzgerald say about happiness in The Great Gatsby?\n\n5. Is money the true antagonist of The Great Gatsby?\n\n6. The women of The Great Gatsby are all victims of a patriarchal society. To what extent do you agree? (Hint: are they all equally victimised?)\n\nChallenge: According to Fitzgerald, what really lays underneath the faÃ§ade of the Roaring 20s? Make reference to at least 2 symbols in The Great Gatsby. (Hint: faÃ§ade = âan outward appearance that conceals a less pleasant realityâ â think about things like colours, clothes, buildings etc.)\n\nResources\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response\n\nHow To Write A Killer Text Response Study Guide\n\nHow to embed quotes in your essay like a boss\n\nHow to turn your Text Response essays from average to A+\n\n5 Tips for a mic drop worthy essay conclusion\n\nThe Importance of the Introduction\n\nSunset Boulevard is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Just look at the difference between an essay that says:\n\n'Through the final shot of the film, Wilder shows Norma completely succumbing to her fantasy.âÂ\n\nCompared to one that argues:\n\nââThrough his utilisation of an increasingly glossy and distorted filter in the ominous final shot, Wilder depicts Norma being completely overtaken by her romanticised fantasy of âOld Hollywoodâ.\n\nSo read below to learn how to use the most effective and crucial cinematic techniques within Sunset Boulevard.Â â\n\nCamera Techniques: Shot Types & Angles\n\nCamera techniques are arguably the primary way that a director will intentionally direct the eye of the audience, directly framing how they view a film. The two most basic ways in which the camera is used for this are through the distance between the subject (what the scene is about) and the camera, or the âshot typeâ and the âcamera angleâ at which the subject is being filmed. Four key examples of these from Sunset Boulevard are explored below.Â\n\nKey Examples of Shot Types\n\nOur first look at Norma Desmond is within the wide shot above, just as Joe Gillis has entered her dishevelled mansion early in the film. As a rule, the introductory shot of a character is always worth closely analysing, as the director typically establishes their characteristics and place within the filmâs wider world.Â\n\nShown above, this distant first look at Norma establishes her distance, both physical and mental, from the world around her. Removing herself from an industry that has long since moved on from her, she is severely out of touch with the reality of the world outside her home. Crucially, as this same shot is from Joeâs perspective, Wilder also foreshadows the more specific character âdistanceâ that will emerge between the two. Here, the audience sees the space Joe will similarly leave between himself and Norma, disingenuously humouring her poor-quality scripts and romantic advances and, therefore, always keeping her âat a distanceâ.\n\nAnother shot conveying crucial information about character relationships is shown when Joe officially âlosesâ Betty towards the end of the film, refusing to give up his âlong-term contractâ with Norma. Here, Wilder consciously frames the sceneâs subject (Betty) at a distance with a medium shot. Supported by her refusal to make eye contact with Joe and her literal statement that she âcan't look at [him]â we again see physical distance between the camera and the subject translating to emotional distance between two characters. The impact of them no longer âseeing eye to eyeâ is additionally heightened by the clear chemistry they previously demonstrated across the film.Â\n\nKey Examples of Camera Angles\n\nJust like the introductory shot of a character is worth digging into, the opening shot of a film is also incredibly important to unpack. Sunset Boulevardâs seemingly straightforward opening shot simply includes the filmâs title, by showing the real-life Hollywood street. However, notice that we are not seeing a âSunset Boulevardâ street sign (the more obvious choice), but instead a dirty and stained curbside. Further, Wilder shoots this curb from a high angle. Therefore, the filmâs opening shot establishes maybe the most central aim of Wilderâs film; offering a critical look at the superficiality and flawed nature of Hollywood. As such, we are literally looking down on the film industry in the first moment of the film, represented by this dirty and unflattering visual symbol of Hollywood. This, therefore, is setting the stage for the satire and critical commentary that will follow.Â\n\nWilderâs careful use of camera angles is further shown at the end of the film after Betty abandons Joe at the gate of Normaâs mansion. Crucially, this all happened due to the desperate exertion of power by Norma, who called Betty and revealed the details of her relationship with Joe. As such, Wilder shoots Norma at a low angle, as Joe looks up at her haughty gaze. The level of power that Norma has exerted over Joe may seem minimal within the moment, but when we consider what happens next, this shot becomes much more important. On the brink of descending completely into madness and taking Joeâs life, Wilder uses this shot to establish that Joe should be looking up in fear at Norma, and his dismissive and pitiful opinion of her will soon lead to his death.Â Â\n\nMise-en-scÃ¨ne\n\nMise-en-scÃ¨ne is perhaps the most deceptively simple cinematic technique. It involves analysing what appears within a frame and where it has been placed by the director. This includes elements such as the actorâs costumes, the props and the design of the set. Often, mise-en-scÃ¨ne is used to reinforce something we are being told about a character already through the filmâs dialogue and acting.Â Â\n\nKey Example of Mise-en-scÃ¨ne 1\n\nWe can see a key example of characterisation through mise-en-scÃ¨ne early in the film, where the audienceâs introduction to Joe Gillis visually communicates his unconcerned and detached attitude, as well as his tendency to settle for something convenient despite its inauthenticity. His being dressed in a bathrobe with the blazing sun outside (and his debt collectors clearly up and doing their jobs) speaks to his slovenliness and uninvested approach to life. The set design within this scene further characterises Joe, with the script directly describing the âreproductions of characterless paintingsâ that cover his walls. Here, the set arguably provides a visual metaphor for the profit-driven âBases Loadedâ script he is writing at that very moment, later described by Betty as having come âfrom hunger.âÂ\n\nKey Example of Mise-en-scÃ¨ne 2\n\nEqually, our introduction to the home of Norma Desmond helps establish the key elements of her character. The house is, as Joe describes, âcrowded with Norma Desmondsâ, in the form of countless framed photos of her from her silent film era. These self-portraits constantly looking out onto Norma symbolise the deluded fantasy world she has placed herself in. They both show how this world is based around her still being a youthful and famous actress, and that this delusion is maintained through Norma only communicating inwardly, refusing to face the reality of the outside world.\n\nSymbols\n\nAs âsymbolisesâ is a verb that is very commonly misused, itâs necessary here to provide a very simplified definition:\n\nA symbol is something that contains levels of meaning not present at first glance or literal translation.Â\n\nIn film, the most obvious symbols are often physical objects that reappear within the story, working to symbolise concepts that develop the textâs key themes.Â\n\nThe Dead Chimp & The Organ\n\nOne of the more seemingly inexplicable parts of Wilder's film actually contains one of its most important symbols, with Normaâs pet monkey playing a key foreshadowing role from beyond the grave. The chimp, a pet owned and trained by Norma to amuse her, leaves a vacant role that Joe will gradually fill after having unknowingly interrupted its funeral. From this point in the film, Joe is manipulated, or âtrainedâ, by Norma to entertain and provide companionship to her. Naturally, Joe also ends up dead within the bounds of Normaâs estate, with this symbol, therefore, foreshadowing the full trajectory of his character. All of this is directly alluded to through Joeâs description of the âmixed-up dreamâ he has the night of the funeral, imagining âan organ [player]â and the âchimpâ¦dancing for penniesâ that he will soon become.Â\n\nThis naturally brings us to the organ itself, which serves as a physical reminder of the unflattering parts of the new role Joe must play. Included after Joe wakes from his âmixed-up dreamâ, the shot above frames Maxâs organ-playing hands as massive and overpowering, as the much-smaller Joe storms in demanding to know why his âclothes and thingsâ were moved to Normaâs house without his say-so. Crucially, Norma then reveals that she ordered this action and that Joe's apartment debts are âall taken care ofâ, hand-waving his attempt at grasping back some control and dignity by proposing it be âdeduct[ed]...from [his] salaryâ. This scene reveals the symbolic role the organ plays within Sunset Boulevard, reminding Joe of the shameful and powerless role of the âpet monkeyâ that he now fills, as well as what he will be âdancingâ for.Â\n\nAllusions\n\nFinally, we come to allusions, one of the techniques that Sunset Boulevard is most famous for. Allusions refer to anytime something from outside the world of the text is referenced, including other texts and real-world people, places, events, etc. Biblical and mythological allusions are commonly found in fiction, but references to something closer to our world can often bring a degree of realism to certain texts, working to strengthen their social commentary.Â\n\nCinematic Allusions\n\nBeing a film about film, Sunset Boulevard naturally contains many allusions to other films. However, Wilder does not shy away from adding an extra level of realism to his references to the film industry. Central to this is the use of the real (and still functional) Paramount Pictures studio to which Joe attempts to sell his clichÃ©d baseball script. Notably, this is the studio that actually released Sunset Boulevard, all of which adds a self-deprecating edge to the satire of the film industry these scenes contain. The scene where the cigar-chomping Paramount executive, Mr Sheldrake, cynically suggests that changing Joeâs film concept to a âgirls' softball teamâ might âput in a few numbersâ, packs an extra punch due to the use of the real film studio, therefore, showing the effect of this allusion in strengthening the filmâs satire.Â\n\nAllusions to specific films are additionally used for humorous purposes and character development. For instance, take Joeâs dry observation that the extravagance of the funeral for Normaâs pet means that he âmust have been a very important chimpâ, perhaps the âgreat-grandson of King Kongâ. Here, Joeâs sardonic and witty character is revealed to the audience. Additionally, these kinds of references further place the film firmly in the world of real Hollywood, again working to strengthen the satire it offers of this industry.Â\n\nLiterary Allusions\n\nSimilarly, allusions to the world of literature flesh out both the characters and the world of Sunset Boulevard. The most stand-out example of this is the allusion to Charles Dickensâ classic novel Great Expectations. Here, Joe muses that the âunhappy lookâ of Normaâs house reminds him of âMiss Havishamâ from this text. This is a character, who, after being abandoned by her fiance, refuses to change her clothing and lives secluded in a ârotting wedding dressâ. Havisham directly parallels Norma, being a tragic figure immovably stuck in the past, with Norma's excessive placement of young self-portraits being reminiscent of Havishmanâs insistence on keeping her houseâs clocks at the exact time she received her letter of marital rejection. Therefore, this comparison to the Dickens character, who engages in a more exaggerated version of Normaâs behaviour, seeks to highlight just how detached Norma is from reality through her attempts to live in the past, implying that what she is doing is just as deluded as refusing to remove a rotting wedding dress. Further, the eventual fate of Miss Havisham within Great Expectations, with her wedding dress catching fire and leaving her as an invalid, foreshadows Normaâs similar descent to invalidity through her madness.\n\nFor more on Sunset Boulevard, check out our blog: How To Incorporate Sunset Boulevard's Cinematic Features Into Your VCE Essay\n\n---\n\nWritten by Milo Burgner\n\nItâs time your conclusions got the attention they deserve! So grab a massive piece of chocolate, a glass of water and prepare to be taught about the beginning of the end (of your essay, that is).\n\nHaving a rushed conclusion is like forgetting to lock your car after an awesome road trip- that one rushed decision could jeopardise the whole experience for your assessor. A mediocre conclusion is the same as powering through a 500 metre race then carelessly slowing down seconds before the finish line! Dramatic comparisons aside, the way you choose to end your text response either leaves the marker with a bad taste in their mouths or increases your chance of hitting a home run. On the other hand, if youâre feeling discouraged by how your essay has shaped up to be, having a killer conclusion could set you up for a pleasant surprise.\n\n5 Tips for a mic-drop worthy conclusion\n\n1. Make a plan for the conclusion\n\nIt has been said many times, âIf you fail to plan, you plan to failâ and it could not be more true when it comes to crafting a killer conclusion. By setting a few minutes aside before even beginning your essay to plan everything out, you get to see the necessary elements which you will want to address in your conclusion. In simpler terms, an essay plan reminds you of your contention and your main points, so that you are able to start gathering all of your arguments and create the perfect concluding paragraph. Planning for each paragraph sets you up for a win as you begin to refine key ideas and explore the many ways of expressing them, which is crucial for a conclusion.\n\n2. Don't tell the reader you are concluding!\n\nTime and time again I have seen people fall into the trap of using phrases such as âin conclusionâ or âin closingâ. The person marking your work may be blown away by the majority of your response, then reach those rotten words and will reconsider this thought. Being this âobviousâ with opening a conclusion does not earn any points. In fact itâs simply not sophisticated. The main reason many students are tempted to begin in such a clumsy way is that they donât know how to begin their conclusion. If you are having difficulty to start and experiencing a bit of writer's block, simply go back to your essay plan and start to unpack the contention - itâs that easy! Rephrase your answer to the actual essay question. Â In most cases, you can just cut out those nasty little words and the opening line of your conclusion will still make perfect sense.\n\n3. Rephrase, not repeat\n\nThe definition of a conclusion is literally to âsum up an argumentâ, thus your last paragraph should focus on gathering all of the loose ends and rewording your thesis and all of your arguments. Itâs great to reinstate what you have said throughout the body of your response but repeating the same phrases and modes of expression becomes bland and bores the reader. Instead, aim to give them a fresh outlook on the key ideas you have been trying to communicate in the previous paragraphs. All it takes is a little time to change the way you are saying key points so that the conclusion does not become tedious to read. Conclusions are there to unite all of your points and to draw a meaningful link in relation to the question initially asked.\n\n4. Keep things short and sharp\n\nYour closing paragraph is NOT for squeezing in one or more âcoolâ points you have- no new points should be brought into the conclusion. You should focus on working with the arguments and ideas that have ALREADY been brought up throughout your response. Introducing new arguments in that last paragraph will cause a lack of clarity and may cause the paragraph to become lengthy. A long conclusion will slow down the momentum of your piece and the reader will begin to lose interest and become impatient. Having a clear aim before writing your conclusion will help avoid a lengthy paragraph as your final thoughts will be more concise and refined.\n\n5. The last line is where you get to really shine\n\nYour closing sentence is the ultimate make or break for the entire essay so it is a shame to see many responses ending awkwardly due to students running out of time or becoming lazy with that final sentence. Last words are so important but donât spend too much time on it! One awesome way to finish is with a very well thought-out phrase which summarises your contention one last time. Imagine dropping the mic after the final sentence of your essay, your conclusion needs to be stronger.\n\nIf you need further help on Text Response (including essay structure), check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâ\n\nAs you all know, English subjects are integral to VCE studies, since it is compulsory that at least all four units of an English subject be done in order for you to reach that ATAR goal at the end of the VCE tunnel. Given the richness in cultural backgrounds of VCE students cohort, EAL is designed to mend the linguistic gaps between local students and those from non-English speaking backgrounds. Students eligible to complete EAL are those who have no more than 7 years residency in a predominately English-speaking country AND no more than 7 years having English as their main language of instructions. Therefore, it is generally considered âeasierâ than mainstream English. So how exactly is this subject easier, or is this just some unproven prejudice? Letâs find out through my quick comparison between the two!\n\nâ\n\nPurposes\n\nAccording to the study design published by VCAA, both these English subjects â[contribute] to the development of literate individuals capable of critical and creative thinking, aesthetic appreciation and creativityâ¦â It might sound complex, but this basically just means that these subjects enable us to enhance our understanding and usage of the English language, which, in my opinion, serves to support our daily English communication. This purpose holds even greater significance to students from non-English speaking backgrounds, as those skills offered by English subjects are essential to their life in Australia. Thatâs said, EAL can be different from mainstream English in the sense that it also assists students whose mother tongue is not English in adapting to the predominately English-speaking community, via developing their language skills.\n\nâ\n\nStructure\n\nBoth EAL and English assess students on multiple areas, including: Text response, Creative writing, Argument Analysis, Compare and Contrast, Presenting Argument. The only difference is in Unit 3, where EAL students are required to do a Listening task, whereas mainstream students study an additional text. Shown below is Unit 3 coursework for these two subjects (from the VCAA English/EAL study design):\n\nENGLISH\n\nEAL\n\nâ\n\nWe can see that there is an extra outcome for Unit 3 EAL, which is âComprehension of a spoken textâ. This is where you will listen to two texts (twice each), take quick notes and fill in short-answers. Listening, therefore, is viewed by many as the least difficult compared to other tasks, because all you need to do is hear people speak English â something students do everyday. Yet it is absolutely not easy at all to attain a perfect score on this component! You have to pick up the right information from bunches of words, structure your response well so that the examiner understands what you try to convey, pay attention to paralinguistic elements (tone, volume, pitchâ¦), etc. All of these skills can never be acquired without persistent practice.\n\nIn place of Listening component, mainstream English students get to do creative response to a different text. This is why Year 12 English students study a total of 4 texts (selected from VCAA text list), whereas itâs only 3 for EAL students.\n\nVCAA has also noted down differences in the two subjectsâ tasks conditions, as shown below:\n\nEnd-of-year exam\n\nLetâs have a look at another table:\n\nâ\n\nOverall, they have similar components, except for the orange-shaded cells. Though EAL students do have a SAC on comparative analysis, this area is not assessed in their exam but replaced by the Listening task. Section C often has similar texts in both exams, with some modifications in language expression.\n\nBoth exams are to be done in 3 hours, non-stop! Youâll get quite weary Iâm sure, but trust me, it will be followed by a sense of accomplishment to see all your hard work paid off on the exam papers!\n\nâ\n\nIs EAL really easier?\n\nSo yep, EAL students get to write fewer essays and have lower word limit than mainstream students. But should we say that itâs easier? My personal opinion is: NO. The reason being learning a language that is not your mother-tongue is really never easy. Australian students doing VCE French will definitely agree with me! Given a large number of EAL students is international students, this subject can be a challenge to them. Yes, Listening might be easier than comparing texts, but taking super quick notes, picking the correct piece of info, paying attention to the way the speech is delivered, watching out for trapsâ¦ are not that simple! I believe that no matter what subject you do, whether it be EAL or English or Mathsâ¦ it only gets âeasierâ after a period of constant effort and hard work.\n\nFor those eligible for both English and EAL, you might be tempted to go for EAL, but my advice is to consult available resources (the study design, this blog, teachers, peersâ¦) before making a decision so as to figure out which style of learning best suits you. After all, youâll learn most where you enjoy the most.\n\nGood luck to you all!\n\nWeâve explored historical context, themes, essay planning and essay topics over on our Like a House on Fire by Cate Kennedy blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys, welcome back to Lisa's Study Guides. So this week I have another essay topic breakdown for you. So eventually I'm going to get through all of the VCAA texts that are on the study design, but we're slowly going to get there and are just want to say yet again, even though this one is like a house on fire, I am really glad if you've clicked on this video and you're not necessarily studying it because as always with all my videos, I try to give you an overall message for you to take away that can be applied to any single text. So that is the same for this particular text today. And so even though the takeaway message for this video is quite specific to short stories, it's still an important consideration for any text that you're studying. Ideally, you want to use a diverse range of evidence for any text, but in particular, for short stories, you don't just want to rely on a small handful, but to try and make links between the different short stories.\n\nSo let's see what that means on the other side of this quick overview of the text. Like a House on Fire is a collection of short stories by the author, Cate Kennedy, and unlike a lot of other texts on the study design, this book portrays a lot of very domestic situations, which seems fairly boring compared to some of the other texts that other students might be doing. However, I'm really excited about this text because the short stories are great. Not because they have groundbreaking premises, which they don't, but because of how effortlessly and deeply emotive they are. So the domestic scenarios actually help us relate to the characters in the stories and empathize with the complexity of their experiences. The essay topic we'll be looking at today is in Like a House on Fire, Kennedy finds strength in ordinary people. Discuss.\n\nHere, the term which you really have to think about is strength. We already know that she depicts the story of ordinary people, of people like you or me, or even just people we may know, but does she find strength in them? It could be physical strength, but more often than not, it might be other types of strength. For instance, the mental strength it takes to cope with intense pressure or the emotional strength it takes to make a difficult choice or action. It's important to think about how they might actually apply throughout the book. In this sense, our essay will have essentially two halves.\n\nThe first two body paragraphs we'll look at scenarios of intense pressure, be it through the loss of control in one's life or a domestic situation which has become emotionally tense. The last two body paragraphs will then consider the types of strength that Kennedy evinces in these stories. And we'll contend that she does find strength in the characters who face a difficult decision, but that she also finds a lot more strength in the characters who managed to cope with their situation and grapple with the tensions in their lives.\n\nParagraph one\n\nIn many of her stories, Kennedy portrays characters who experience powerlessness. This loss of power can come a number of ways. For instance, both Flexion and Like a House on Fire tell the story of men who have injured their previously reliable bodies and have thus been rendered immobile. But they also tell the story of their respective wives who have lost some control over their lives now that they have to care for their husbands. On the other hand, there are the kids in Whirlpool whose mother insists that they dress a certain way for a Christmas photo. Her hand on your shoulders, exerting pressure that pushes you down. Kennedy's use of second person really makes you feel this pressure that keeps you from going out to the pool you so desperately desire to be in. Evidently powerlessness is an experience that comes in many shapes and forms in several stories.\n\nParagraph two\n\nIn addition to this, Kennedy explores other emotional tensions across the collection, subverting the idea that the home is necessarily a safe sanctuary. This is where she really goes beyond just the idea of powerlessness, but actually jumps into scenarios that are much more emotionally complex. In Ashes for instance, we see the homosexual protagonist struggle with feeling useless and tongue tied, embarrassed by the floundering pause between his mother and himself. There is a significant emotional hurdle there, which is particularly poignant given that mothers are usually considered a source of safety and comfort for their children. Kennedy's story of domesticity actually subvert or question what we might think of the domestic space shared by family members. If you have the Scribe edition of the book, the artwork on the cover would depict a vase of wilting flowers, an empty picture frame, and a spilt cup of coffee.\n\nThese are all visual symbols of an imperfect domestic life. A similar rift exists between husband and wife in both Five Dollar Family and Waiting, the women find themselves unable to emotionally depend on their partners. While Michelle in Five Dollar Family despises her husbands startled, faintly incredulous expression, an inability to care for their child, the protagonist in Waiting struggles to talk about her miscarriages with her husband who is already worn down as it is. Kennedy takes these household roles of mother, son, husband, wife, and really dives into the complex shades of emotion that lies within these relationships. We realize through her stories that a mother can't always provide comfort to a child and that a husband isn't always the dependable partner that he's supposed to be.\n\nParagraph three\n\nHowever, Kennedy does find strength in some characters who do take a bold or courageous leap in some way. These are really important moments in which she is able to show us the strength that it takes to make these decisions. And she triumphs however small or insignificant that can be achieved.\n\nA moment that really stands out to me is the ending of Laminex and Mirrors, where the protagonist rebelliously smuggles a hospital patient out for a smoke only to have to take him back into his ward through the main entrance and therefore get them both caught. She recounts this experience as the one I remember most clearly from the year I turned 18. The two of us content, just for this perfect moment. And their success resonates with the audience, even though the protagonist would have lost her job and therefore the income she needed for her trip to London, Kennedy demonstrates her strength in choosing compassion for an elderly patient. Even the sister in Whirlpool, who wasn't exactly kind to the protagonist in the beginning, forms an unlikely alliance with her against their mother, sharing a reckless moment and cutting their photo shoot short. Bold leaps such as these are ones that take strength and therefore deserve admiration.\n\nParagraph four\n\nHowever, more often than not, Kennedy's stories are more about the strength needed to simply cope with life, one day at a time. She explores the minutiae of her characters lives in a way that conveys the day to day struggles, but also hints at the underlying fortitude needed to deal with these things on a daily basis. In Tender, the wife feels as if everything at home is on the verge of coming apart since her husband is only able to cook tuna and pasta casserole for their kids. However, when she must get a possibly malignant tumor removed, her concern of whether there'll be tuna and pasta in the pantry just in case, demonstrates her selfless nature. Kennedy thus creates a character who is strong for others, even when her own life at home is disorderly and her health may be in jeopardy. The strength of gritting one's teeth and getting on with things in spite of emotional tension is a central idea across this collection, and many other examples are there for you to consider as well.\n\nAnd so we come to the end of our essay. Hopefully going through this gives you an idea of how to cover more bases with your evidence. Remember that you don't have to recount lots and lots of events, but it's more important to engage with what the events are actually telling us about people. This is particularly important for prompts like this one, where it heavily focuses on the people involved. That is it for me this week, please give this video a thumbs up. If you wanted to say thanks to Mark, who has been helping me write these scripts up for a lot of the text response essay, topic breakdowns. If you enjoyed this, then you might also be interested in the live stream coming up next week, which will be on Friday the 25th of May at 5:00 PM. I'll be covering the topic of analyzing argument for the second time, just because there's so much to get through. I'll also be announcing some special things during that particular live stream. So make sure you're there so you're the first to hear it. I will see you guys next week. Bye.\n\nResources\n\nLike a House on Fire by Cate Kennedy\n\nHow To Get An A+ On Your Like A House On Fire Essay\n\nClose Analysis Of 'Cake' From Like A House On Fire\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf you, like me, grew up Asian in Australia, you might think you already know a thing or two about, well, growing up Asian in Australia. Our stories can be pretty similarâjust have a scroll through the âsubtle asian traitsâ Facebook group, or have a conversation with literally any Asian Australian about their parents.\n\nAt the same time, itâs also important to recognise that everyoneâs experiences are diverse, especially given how broad an identity âAsianâ can be. Also important is to recognise how broad and intersectional identity can be in generalâintersectional meaning that race isnât the only thing that defines any one of us. Things like gender, socio-economic status, ability, sexual orientation and religion can also be really central, for example. Each of these things can impact the way we navigate the world.\n\nCovering a broad range of these stories is Alice Pungâs anthology, Growing Up Asian In Australia. Some of the contributors in this volume include Sunil Badami, Matt Huynh, Bon-Wai Chou, Diana Nguyen, Michelle and Benjamin Law, and Shaun Tan, and already this cross-section is fairly diverse in nature. You can also click on their names to find out a bit more about each of their work. I think this is worth a few minutes, just to get acquainted with the sheer range of Asian-Australian creatives who are represented in this book, and to locate their work within the themes they write aboutâin other words, having a think about the ways that cultural heritage, or experiences with family, or economic hardship permeate their work, both in the anthology and in their lives outside it.\n\nThe anthology is (perhaps quite helpfully) divided into sections which revolve around key themes, which is also going to inform the structure of this guide. Iâll be using this guide to go through an exercise that I found really helpful when learning the text, which involves:\n\ntaking two stories per section and drawing up some dot-point similarities and differences\n\ntranslating two of those points into paragraphs, a bit like a âmini-essayâ\n\nWeâll go through some an example of what this might look like, and why itâs a helpful exercise to try.\n\nBefore we start diving into Growing Up Asian in Australia, I'd highly recommend checking out LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nStrine (Badami & Tseng)\n\nStrine is whatâs called a syncope, a shortened way of pronouncing Australian (a bit like âStrayaâ)âit refers to Australian English as itâs spoken by locals. This section of the book is all about language, and about the difficulties of juggling two languages growing up, and Badami and Tsengâs stories are great examples of this.\n\n1. Similarity: connections to oneâs mother tongue fade over time. Tseng recounts how, one by one, she and her sisters stopped learning Chinese as they progressed through their Australian education. Badami on the other hand compromises his name which stood out as too Indian when he âjust wanted to fit in.â\n\n2. Similarity: for âthird-culture kidsâ, losing knowledge of their language also strains their relationship with their forebears. Badamiâs mother is shocked to hear the anglicisation of his name despite the significance it carrie for her (âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringyâ), and Tseng describes the experience of communicating with her father in âChinglishâ so that they can both understand each other.\n\n3. Difference: language can be an internalised, personal experience, or a highly exposed and interpersonal one. While Tseng feels her loss of her language as a âsense of shame, a vague uneaseâ, Badami is almost bullied into changing his name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â\n\nThe Clan (Law & Chau)\n\nThis section delves into the complex ties that hold migrant families together. Chauâs poems are starkly different to Lawâs story, so itâll be interesting to compare how these different narrative forms work to explore those ideas.\n\n1. Similarity: it can take at least one generation for migrant families to dig their roots into their new home. While Lawâs parents are proud tourists at Queensland theme parks, he and his siblings âgroanâ at their comportment. Chauâs poem âThe Firstbornâ traces his ancestry forward until he arrived, âan ABCâ and his son âby amniotic seaâ, both of them born into Australia.\n\n2. Similarity: family dynamics are still traditional and therefore gendered. Law notes how his motherâs health suffered when divorcing his father, and Chau notes that the women members of his family were âcast offâ the family tree âas if they were never born.\n\n3. Difference: family history and heritage can vary in importance. Chauâs family traces back âtwenty-eight generationsâ of history, whereas Lawâs family very much lives in the present, the only tie to older generations being his âMa-Maâ, or grandma.\n\n4. Difference: families show their love in different ways. Whether itâs dedicating a poem to his son about his life as one of âten thousand riversâ of Chinese diaspora into the Australian sea, or taking the kids to theme parks on weekends, all sorts of affection can hold families together.\n\nPutting it together\n\nSo Iâve tried to choose two sections (and four stories) that are all a bit different to try and mix it up and get some rich comparative discussion out of these. You might be studying this text alone, but even as one text, remember that thereâs a lot of diverse experiences being represented in it, so discussing how stories connect, compare and contrast is just as important as discussing the content of individual stories themselves.\n\nIf we do a mini-essay, we might as well go about it properly and pick some sort of contention. Without a fixed prompt though, it might be easier to start with those dot points and pick which ones we want to write out and string together. Letâs pick twoâconnections to mother tongue fading over time (Strine similarity 1) and digging roots into Australia over time (The Clan similarity 1). A contention covering these points might look like:\n\nWhile second generation migrants may struggle with loss of culture, they also constitute a unique and significant part of the diaspora.\n\nAn example\n\nMany migrants lose connections to their heritage over time, and these connections are often in the form of language. Particularly for Asian migrants, there is not as strong a need to preserve their mother tongue in the English-speaking Australia, and as such their knowledge of those languages can be easily lost. Ivy Tseng, for instance, recalls how she was never able to âgrasp the significanceâ of learning Chinese as a child, and eventually she and her sisters would prioritise âstudyâ and other academic pursuits over learning Chinese. Because tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language. These compromises can come from other factors as well, particularly the group dynamics of being in white-dominated Australia. Bullying is a frequent culprit, and Badami for example is indeed peer-pressured into resentingâand ultimately anglicisingâhis name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â More generally speaking, a sense of shame for oneâs difference is a common part of the migrant experienceâLaw experiences it as well at theme parks, where he and his siblings attempt to âset [them]selves apartâ from the faux-pas of their parents. Not always an intentional goal, but a general willingness to compromise connections to heritage underscores many Asian Australian migrant stories, particularly of second-generation migrants.\n\nHowever, the extent to which migrants feel socially integrated in society shifts generationally and over time as well. Second generation migrants are thus unique in that they have the closest connection to their heritage while also initiating this process of integration. Law and his siblings exemplify this, with their âAustralian accentsâ and âproper grammar and syntax.â While some loss of their native Cantonese takes place, they are also the first in their family to sound Australian, one step closer to being Australian. They constitute part of the distinct, third culture of âABCââAustralian-born Chineseâto which Chau alludes in his poem, âThe Firstbornâ. Distinct from first-generation migrants, ABCs are a product of diaspora and spend their formative years immersed in the Australian way of life. Chauâs poem goes on to highlight how sizeable this demographic now isââthe sea is awash with the unfathomable Chinese sons.â Thus, we can see how ABCs, or second generation Asian migrants, represent a unique and significant social group exemplified by great compromise, but also great change.\n\nWhy is this useful?/How can I apply this?\n\nI like this exercise because it gets you thinking creatively about the key implications of the stories. Within a section or theme, you want to identify similarities in how both stories contribute to our understanding of that theme. You also want to identify differences to explore how stories can be unique and nuanced, which will provide your essay with more depth when you ultimately need it. Then, putting it all together helps you synthesise new connections between themes.\n\nFor an analytical study of this text, youâd flesh out those ideas until they become paragraphs, introducing relevant evidence and mixing it up with explanatory sentences as you go. Explanatory sentences keep you analysing rather than story-telling, and they usually donât have any quotesâan example from above might be âbecause tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language.â\n\nFor a creative study, youâd take away those ideas and look at how else you might explore them in other stories. Feel free to challenge yourself for this; I remember falling back on more personal writing when studying this creatively, but donât neglect other genres or forms! If second generation migrants are in fact more on their way to belonging, write a speculative story about how an apocalypse tests those connections to white Australians. I dunno, but donât be afraid to really push the boundaries here and test the implications you draw from the stories.\n\nGive it a go\n\nTry it for some of these:\n\nUnAustralian? (Loewald & Law) and Leaving Home (Diana Nguyen & Paul Nguyen)\n\nBattlers (Dac & Law/Huynh) and Mates (Phommavanh & Ahmed)\n\nThe Folks (Lazaroo & Tran) and Homecoming (Beeby & Larkin)\n\nGrowing Up Asian in Australia Essay Prompt Breakdown\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nThe essay topic weâll be looking at today is short and sweet;\n\nTo belong is to sacrifice. Discuss.Â\n\nThe key terms are evidently âto belongâ and âto sacrificeâ, so these are the words and definitions that weâll have to interrogate.Â\n\nBelonging is a feeling of being accepted by someone or being a member of something, so weâd have to ask who is doing the accepting, and what are the writers seeking to be members of. On the other hand, sacrifice is loss, itâs giving something upâitâs implied that seeking belonging means you may have to navigate compromises to what you have, how you live, or maybe, who you are. Have a think about what sacrifices are made by whom, and why.\n\nWith that in mind, letâs brainstorm a contention. We usually want to avoid going fully agree or fully disagree to create a bit more âgritâ for the essayâand in this case, the prompt is pretty deterministic or absolute; itâs saying that belonging is all about sacrifice.Â\n\nIâd probably argue that belonging is sometimes about sacrifice, and for migrant children they often give up some of their culture or heritage for Western lifestyle or values. That being said, belonging in these cases is probably more about synthesis than sacrificeâitâs about being able to negotiate and bring heritage into increasingly Australian ways of life.\n\nThe brainstorming section of writing a killer essay is where my THINK and EXECUTE strategy comes in. If you havenât heard of it before, essentially, itâs a method of essay writing that emphasises the importance of really thinking about all aspects of a prompt and exploring all the different avenues you can go down. To be able to EXECUTE a well-reasoned, coherent and articulate essay that contains enough nitty-gritty analysis, you have to do enough THINKing to get some meat on the essayâs skeleton, so to speak. To learn more, check out my top selling eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nIn paragraphs, we could start by looking at some of the sacrifices people make in order to belong. The poem, âBe Good, Little Migrantsâ has a more of a cynical take on this, suggesting that migrant groups are expected to sacrifice economic mobility and even personal dignity in order to gain favour with locals: âgive us your faithful serviceâ, âdisplay your gratitude but donât be heard, donât be seen.âÂ\n\nEconomic sacrifices are seen across many stories, from the working class âdecent enough incomeâ in âFamily Lifeâ to the failing business in âABC Supermarketâ. Other forms of sacrifice might be less materialâfor example Benjamin Lawâs sacrifice of his Mariah Carey cassettes in an attempt to fit in at school from the story âTowards Manhoodâ. This example is interesting because it isnât a cultural sacrifice, but a gendered oneâitâs a good reminder that identity is always multi-layered.Â\n\nFor migrant children though, the sacrifices usually revolve around their race and culture. Diana Nguyen for example notes language as a key sacrifice: she quits Vietnamese school because she didnât feel like she belonged with the grade ones in her class, and her ultimate âlack of interest in learning [Vietnamese] created a lasting barrierâ between her mother and her. In Sunil Badamiâs story, âSticks and Stones and Such-Likeâ, the sacrifice is his name, as he Anglicises it to Neil. When his mother finds out, âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow.â The common denominator here is that Asians growing up in Australia often have to navigate sacrificing some of their heritage in order to belong in western society.Â\n\nHowever, the challenges faced by the Asian diaspora growing up abroad are more complex and more nuanced than just sacrifice. More often than not, theyâre required to synthesise a âthird cultureâ identity that balances their heritage with western values and lifestyles.Â\n\nDiana Nguyen goes on to discuss her career trajectory in becoming a âworking actorâ in Melbourneâs entertainment industry, carving out a path for herself in spite of her parentsâ disapproval, and going on to represent a new generation of Asian Australians in the media. The story âWei-Lei and Meâ also points to this shifting demographic in Australia, as Gouvernel and her best friend stave off a racist primary school bully only to see their home change for the better as they grew up, with new restaurants from their home cuisines opening up. At the same time, they âhad become what [they] thought [they] could never be: Australian,â describing a way of life in Canberra that is unmistakably Australian.Â\n\nSo, belonging isnât necessarily all about sacrificeâit doesnât mean you canât pursue your passions or become âAustralianâ. Sure, sometimes sacrifice is necessary, but âthird culture kidsâ synthesise conflicting identities in order to belong.Â\n\nHaving arrived at the contention, letâs just have another think about the takeaway message - being able to bring other themes into an essay topic that only really raises one theme. To answer this topic fully, a good essay wouldnât just discuss belonging and sacrifice, but it would also bring in discussion about family, friends, careers and cultures, just to name a few. Hopefully this is something you can translate into your own future work!\n\nConclusion\n\nGrowing Up Asian In Australia is an anthology with a lot to unpack, but there are plenty of unique stories with plenty of interesting links to be made. However youâre learning this text, being able to draw conclusions from stories and extrapolate them into your writing is a really important skill.\n\nAs you go, ask yourself about the implications: âso what?â and âwhy?â. These sorts of questions will help you get richer insights and write about the anthology in a more interesting way."
