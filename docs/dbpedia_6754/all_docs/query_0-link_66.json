        "text": "Taking place in Northern Ireland in the early 90s, Derry Girls focuses on Erin and her closest friends as they navigate growing up during the Troubles. While by no means a show focusing on the border tensions between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK for those who are unclear), it is interesting to see how teenagers going about their daily lives are impacted by the presence of soldiers and the constant conflicts between the two countries and religions (catholic vs. protestant).\n\nThe series is a comedic gem, now one of the most popular series to come from Ireland and the UK, loved around the world thanks to its international distribution on Netflix. They are short light-hearted episodes, with only 6 a season, making it easy to binge watch. And while you’re laughing, you’ll find yourself quickly acclimatizing to the Northern Irish accent and vernacular, while also learning more (through vague terms and references) about the end of the Troubles, which remains a dark spot in Irish history.\n\nWatch the trailer for the first season here.\n\nBased on the 2018 award winning novel by Sally Rooney, this adaptation is a moving, character driven story that not only gets you invested in the characters and their journeys, but captures life in Ireland better than most. The show thoughtfully depicts topics like class differences, communication issues, stigma surrounding mental health, family drama, striving to fit in, and the Irish’s love for GAA, representing real and common aspects of daily life in Ireland. This show will allow you to see Ireland in a way not often represented on screen, especially in modern media.\n\nInstead of focusing on the country during the Troubles, the fight for freedom from the UK, or depicting the comedic ventures of teens/young adults, this series really touches on the internal struggles many face as they grow up in Ireland.\n\nAnd then there is the romance storyline, which has captured the hearts of fans all over the world. Follow socially awkward Marianne and popular, yet insecure, Connell as they discover themselves through one another, leaning on each other for support and growth while also hurting each other through their inability to express their feelings when it matters. Be warned, there is quie a lot of sex scenes in this series, and while added with purpose and done tastefully with equal nudity for both actors, this is most definitely NSFW. More like NSTWWF: Not Safe to Watch with Family, not unless you and your parents/kids are comfortable watching intimate and sweaty sex scenes together.\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\nThis comedy series focuses on the friendship of two girls in their early 20s as they navigate the responsibilities of growing up while living in Dublin, struggling to find the balance between having fun and embracing their 20s, and laying down roots for their future. As Aisling and Danielle continue to soldier on, with nights spent out drinking, the effects of their party lifestyle begin to have a negative impact on their lives and, in turn, their friendship.\n\nThis show is a funny look at the struggle many have felt with finding the balance and toeing the line in their 20s, with two seasons of ups-and-downs. Sadly, the show won’t continue past season 2 as one of the main characters passed away, but that just makes this a quick and easy watch to prepare you for nights out in Dublin. And it will introduce you to Coppers, one of Dublin’s most famous and, dare I say, ratched nightclubs.\n\nWatch the trailer for the first season here.\n\nThis 2002 film touches on a sensitive subject in modern Irish history, something that Irish politicians, as well as the papacy, are still apologizing for today - the use of special homes and asylums (often referred to as Magdalene asylums or Magdalene laundries) asylums, and laundries for pregnant unmarried women, where they were forced to live and work, being horribly mistreated. More specifically, in the 20th century in Ireland, women who were seen as wanton, sexual, notorious, or even too flirtatious, were placed in the care of the church and put into homes and asylums “for their own good”. In some cases, simply being an unwanted woman was enough to have you placed in one of these asylums. However, these homes were highly abusive, terribly restrictive, and inforced innocent women into labour as a means of redemption.\n\nThis film tells the story of some of these women who were imprisoned inside of a Magdalene Laundry, depicting just some of the injustices that were inflicted upon these women. It’s a darker film, and handles a topic that was only really brought to light in recent years after the discovery of a mass grave in Ireland, where the records and the body count did not line up. While this movie undoubtedly sheds light on these horrors, it's only just the beginning, and will likely have you running for your computer to learn more.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nFlashing back between present and past - specifically the 1940s - this movie tells the story of Rose McNulty, a senile old woman who has been a patient in a mental hospital for over half her life. On the eve of the hospital’s demolition, a doctor comes to see Rose to determine if she’s fit to be released or if she should be moved to another facility. As he talks with her, he learns her story, something she has taken pains to keep written down in a bible - the flashbacks showing how Rose came to be placed in the hospital and the horrors she endured. Because as the doctor learns, Rose wasn’t crazy or at fault when placed in a mental hospital, but rather had fallen in love with a protestant, something that greatly bothered a priest who, despite everything, was in love with her. Her indifference to the priest and relationship with the other man, had her placed in the hospital, her reputation tarnished to society. As Rose’s story unfolds, heartbreaking discoveries are made and harsh truths revealed.\n\nThis movie sheds some light on the way women were treated in Ireland, showing just how easily they could have their dignity and futures stripped from them - a topic that has been in the headlines frequently in recent years after the Women and Children homes/Magdalene laundries were made public knowledge.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nAn award winning historical biopic directed by Neil Jordan, Michael Collins tells the story of the titular character’s fight for Irish independence as a revolutionary, a solider, a leader, and a politician. This drama focuses on his role as a leader in the Irish Republican Army as the country fought for independence from the British in the early 20th century. Played by Liam Neeson - who is from Northern Ireland - this movie starts after the 1916 Easter Rising, focusing on the Irish War of Independence, followed by Collin’s role in the Irish Civil War.\n\nWhile the film does take some liberties, it captures the essence of the rebellion and the drive of Michael Collins and his companions, illuminating on the history and motivation that pushed the IRA to fight for freedom from British rule.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nGet the Kleenex box out because this movie is a gut-wrenching punch to the stomach, depicting the life of author Frank McCourt; an adaptation of his memoir about growing up impoverished in Ireland during the 30s and 40s. After briefly living in the United States, Frank and his family moved back to Limerick, Ireland, looking to start over where they have family that may be able to help them, especially after the loss of Frank’s younger sister. But with his father’s alcoholism and pride, along with continuous tragedies and strife, their future doesn’t look any brighter, getting bleaker by the day.\n\nThis film is a dark portrayal of poverty in Ireland, as well as the effects of alcoholism on a family. It’s a gritty and harrowing story, made worse by knowing that it’s based on McCourt’s true story. Of course, his memoir is far worse and more detailed, perhaps why it was an international bestseller. Cast includes: Emily Watson, Robert Carlyle, and Devon Murray (best recognized for his role in the Harry Potter films as Seamus Finnigan).\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nSet during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War - back to back wars ranging from 1919 to 1923 - The Wind that Shakes the Barley focuses on two brothers as they join the IRA and fight for freedom. Starring Cillian Murphy and Pádraic Delaney as the O’Donovan brothers, each must come to terms with who they are, what they want, and what they are prepared to sacrifice.\n\nDirected by Ken Loach, this film won the Palme d’Or at Cannes Film Festival - understandable given its beautiful cinematography, delicate portrayal of a harsh subject, and the emotional performances by the cast, which also includes Liam Cunningham. Interestingly, Loach approaches this fight for nationalism as expression and desire for social reform; a unique take on this chapter in history that adds another layer to the already complex background.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nThis award-winning and Oscar-nominated film, written by Nick Hornby and directed by John Crowley, stars Saoirse Ronan as Eilis Lacey, an young Irish woman as she tries to build a life for herself in Brooklyn, USA in the 1950’s. Having grown up in Enniscorthy, a small tight-knit community in Ireland, where opportunity and diversity is just as lacking as a sense of privacy, Eilis struggles to adapt to her new life abroad, despite living in a boarding house with other Irish women and the support of the loving Father Flood. However, as Eilis goes through the motions, she begins to find herself adapting to her new American life, thriving in the land of opportunity. However, when a tragedy brings her back to Enniscorthy, Eilis must decide if Ireland is still her home or if she’s outgrown her life there.\n\nA romantic drama with comedic moments, this film adaptation captures Eilis’ inner conflicts, as well as the struggle one faces when breaking out on their own. It’s a beautifully paced film with breathtaking scenery, reminding viewers of the charm of old Brooklyn, paired with the serenity of the Irish coast. It also captures a familiar story for many, lightly touching on Irish emmigration.\n\nBrooklyn was included in BBC’s list of ‘100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century’, as well as won over 35 awards around the world, with over 100 nominations - most of which were for Saoirse Ronan’s performance. Other actors include: Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters, Domhnall Gleeson, Emory Cohen, and Jessica Paré.\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\nThis romantic comedy may get a lot wrong about Irish geography and customs, but it certainly captures the beauty of this lovely country. And while it does accurately suggest that some things may seem slower or a bit more backwards compared to other Western countries, it’s worth noting that it’s an exaggerated portrayal of Ireland. In all truth, most Irish find this movie ridiculous and highly inaccurate, if not offensive, but to those who are looking for travel inspiration, stunning views, or some Irish Lilts, this is a light chick flick that certainly delivers and will have you excited to take in the Irish countryside.\n\nStarring Amy Adams as the lead, a Type-A Bostonian who is chasing her boyfriend to Ireland to propose to him on Leap Day, you’ll enjoy the back-and-forth between her and the Irish local who must help her get to Dublin to achieve her goals. Despite Matthew Goode, the romantic lead, being English and putting on an Irish accent, you can’t help but fall for him in his Aran wool knits.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nA musical set in Dublin in the 1980s, this movie is about Conor, a nerdy Irish teenager, looking desperately to impress a girl he likes and escape his complicated family life. Gathering together a group of outcasts, Conor starts a band, convinced this is how he will impress Raphina (his crush), especially when he asks her to star in the music videos. With his new friends and bandmates, and the attention of Raphina, Conor begins to discover his voice and comes into his own. This coming of age story emphasizes the optimism and hope of youth, as well as the promise of a bright future that only the 80s could inspire.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nAn independent musical drama, this movie earned an Oscar for its hit song “Falling Slowly”, bringing this small-budget film international attention. A romance, in the vein of Richard Linklater’s Before Sunset movies, Once focuses on a short-lived romance between an Irish street busker and a Czech flower girl - both working on Dublin’s busy Grafton street. After opening themselves up to one another, they both must go their separate ways, their lives forever touched by one another.\n\nProduced with a budget just over $100,000, this independent film uses the city’s spirit as the perfect background, making the most of Dublin’s natural charms without reproducing it for the camera.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nA dark and gritty film starring Michael Fassbender as Irish Republican Bobby Sands, this award winning historical biopic focuses on a specific moment during The Troubles, when imprisoned IRA members in Northern Ireland were protesting the removal of Special Category Status for Irish inmates with various strikes. The British government’s withdrawal of Special Category Status for Irish inmates meant that the prisoners were no longer considered Prisoners of War but criminals, thus removing certain privileges afforded to POWs according to the Geneva Convention.\n\nAfter five years of protesting, which included ‘dirty strikes’, the prisoners took to a hunger strike that lasted over 50 days. However, when it broke, Sands knew more was required and took to another hunger strike despite his failing health. During his strike he was elected a member of parliament, something that brought international attention to the matter. Bobby Sands died after 66 days of starvation, becoming a hero to the Irish Republicans but a controversial figure around the world. Some saw him as a martyr fighting for his beliefs, only in his 20s, while others saw him as a misguided man urging on civil and religious war. Reactions around the world differed, and to this day, he remains a controversial symbol.\n\nNeither glorifying or demonizing Sands, director Steve McQueen (12 Years a Slave) spends most of the film focusing on the power of one’s beliefs and convictions, questioning when is undying loyalty toxic versus admirable, and the power and outcome of when one is pushed to their limits. Perhaps most impressive in this film is the 17-minute continuous shot between Bobby Sands and a Catholic priest (Liam Cunningham), where they discuss Sand’s strike and the morality behind it.\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\nSet in Northern Ireland in 1971, at the height of the Troubles, this action thriller focuses on the journey of one young British soldier - new recruit Gary Hook, played by Jack O’Connell (Skins, Unbroken, Tulip Fever) - as he tries to navigate the streets of Belfast after getting separated from his unit during a riot. As Hook continuously runs for his life, hiding from IRA members, he encounters various individuals from both sides of the fight - some who are kind enough to shelter him in their apartment in the Divis Flats after he gets injured in an explosion.\n\nThe film glorifies neither side, taking a somewhat neutral approach to the conflict. Instead, through Hook’s harrowing fight for survival, you witness the horrors that both sides were willing to commit, making it clear that neither side was innocent. While the director did an amazing job capturing Hook’s fear and building the necessary dramatic tension, the real takeaway was the emphasis on innocence lost. Regardless of beliefs and loyalties, the Trouble and the endless conflicts stole childhoods, turned friends to foe, and robbed individuals of their innocence.\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\nA surprisingly light film given how difficult the subject matter is, Philomena is based on the true story of Philomena Lee, an elderly woman who chose to search for her son decades after giving him up for adoption. Her story, sadly, is not unique, as she was a victim of the Church and the Magdalene Laundries in Ireland.\n\nPhilomena, played by Judi Dench, is searching for her son with the help of journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan), after her child was given up for adoption without her consent. When she got pregnant out of wedlock at 17, her father had her placed in an abbey, where her newborn son was taken from her after childbirth and given away. Instead of being allowed to return home, Philomena was forced to work in the convent’s laundry for years, never to know what happened to her child. However, decades later she begins her search, and through Sixsmith’s investigation skills, is able to find out who her son is and learn about his life.\n\nWarning: this film does not have a particularly happy ending, portraying the horrors that the Catholic Church was able to inflict for years without detection or repercussion in Ireland, while somehow still managing to preach one of the core values of Catholicism - forgiveness. Perhaps the message would have fallen flat with a weaker director or cast but Judi Dench delivers perfectly in this role, imparting the harsh reality Philomena Lee (and many more like her) faced with a dignified grace only Dench could manage.\n\nYou can watch the trailer here.\n\nWhat first appears to be a comedy focusing on two co-dependent and highly irresponsible best friends who are embracing city life in Dublin as they refuse to grow up, becomes a movie about friendship - the good and the ugly - and what happens when friends find themselves going in different directions, at different points in their lives. Examining the power of female friendship, the toxicity of co-dependence, and the struggles that come with aging and responsibilities, Animals is a drama that harshly points out just how hard it can be to grow up, especially when it comes from external pressure rather than internal drive.\n\nStarring Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat as best friends Laura and Tyler, this poignant independent film, which is an adaptation of a novel by the same name, makes a case for self-acceptance and finding your own path on your own timeline, while also highlighting the importance of surrounding yourself with supportive people who will encourage rather than demand and expect things from you.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nA romantic drama, often included in lists and rankings for top romance films, P.S. I Love You is an adaptation of Cecilia Ahern’s novel by the same name and proves a bit of tear-jerker. Holly, played by Hillary Swank, is mourning the loss of her husband Gerry (Gerrard Butler), when she discovers a series of letters left for her, delivered over time and through a scavenger hunt, designed to help her through her grief and move on with her life. One of his messages sends her and her best friends to Ireland to discover his homeland. As she explores and learns more about her late husband’s past, she begins to find the tools to move forward.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nA touching independent film about a recent widower and his estranged son as they travel through Ireland with a mission; a final task requested by their late wife and mother. Sean Fogle, played by Logan Lerman, is fresh out of prison and resistant to travelling overseas with his father, eager to make a fresh start on the other side of the country on his own. His father, Frank - played by John Hawkes - is a mild tempered and appearingly weak, yet loyal, man, pained by his lack of relationship with his son and struggling with the death of his wife. But as they travel to spread his wife’s ashes per her request, father and son must examine their own relationship and finally try being honest with one another.\n\nWatch the trailer here.\n\nA poignant coming of age story that examines friendship, the desire to fit in, and acceptance, Handsome Devil tells the story of the friendship between two students at an all boys boarding school; both outsiders longing to fit in who find comfort with one another. New student Conor, a rugby star, is forced to share a dorm room with outcast Ned, an awkward and shy individual who appearingly dislikes rugby, despite being at an elite rugby school. While they don’t immediately get along, with time they begin to relate to one another, in more ways than one.\n\nWhile not one of the main characters, Andrew Scott stars in a large supporting role, perhaps best known for his role as The Priest in Fleabag. Other actors in this film, many of whom are familiar, include: Fionn O’Shea (Normal People, Dating Amber), Michael McElhatton (Game of Thrones, The Zookeeper’s Wife, The Alienist: Angel of Darkness), Ruairi O’Connor (The Spanish Princess, The Morning Show), and Nicholas Galitzine, who will be starring as the prince in the upcoming 2021 Cinderella film, opposite Camila Cabello.\n\nYou can watch the trailer here."
