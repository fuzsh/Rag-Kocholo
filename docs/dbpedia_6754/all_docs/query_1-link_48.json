        "text": "BBC News NI takes a look at significant events involving dissident republicans since March 2009.\n\nThe term \"dissident republicans\" describes a range of individuals who do not accept the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace deal which ended the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Provisional IRA - the main armed republican paramilitary group for most of the Troubles - declared a ceasefire in the run up to the agreement and officially ended its violent campaign in 2005.\n\nDissident republicanism is made up of various groups which broke away from the Provisional IRA in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, including the Continuity IRA and New IRA.\n\nThe groups are much smaller than the Provisional IRA, although they have access to high-calibre weapons and have used improvised explosive devices and mortars in attacks and attempted attacks.\n\nThey have continued to use violence to attempt to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in a single state but their activities have been sporadic and often undermined by the security services.\n\nA list containing the details of 10,000 police officers and civilian staff is in the hands of dissident republicans, police confirmed.\n\nThe information was contained in a spreadsheet mistakenly released as part of a PSNI response to a freedom of information request.\n\nChief Constable Simon Byrne said the data breach was on an industrial scale and included the surnames, initials and ranks of colleagues.\n\nHe said dissident republicans could use the information, part of which appeared in redacted form on a wall in west Belfast, to \"intimidate or target officers and staff\".\n\nThe terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland is increased from substantial to severe, meaning the risk of attack or attacks is now \"highly likely\" instead of \"likely\".\n\nThe move, based on an MI5 intelligence assessment, reverses a downgrade to the threat level in 2022, the first such downgrade in 12 years.\n\nA severe threat level is one step below critical, the highest level of threat.\n\nIt comes after the shooting of Det Ch Insp John Caldwell in February and a bomb attack on police officers in November 2022.\n\nSenior police officer Det Ch Insp John Caldwell was shot at a sports complex in Omagh, County Tyrone, on 22 February.\n\nHe was off duty and was putting footballs into the boot of his car after coaching young people when two gunmen approached him and shot him several times.\n\nAn attempted murder investigation was launched.\n\nPolice said the primary focus of their investigation was on violent dissident republicans, including the New IRA.\n\nThe New IRA later claimed responsibility in a typed statement which appeared in Londonderry on Sunday 26 February.\n\nA stash of bullets and guns believed to belong to dissident republicans exploded after being left on top of a hot boiler at a house in west Belfast.\n\nResponding to reports of a house fire in Rodney Drive, police and firefighters discovered two AK-47s, two sawn-off shot guns, a high-powered rifle with a silencer and three pipe bombs.\n\nPolice blamed the New IRA and said the weapons were believed to have been used in previous attempts to murder police officers in Belfast in 2015 and 2017.\n\nA bomb exploded outside the home of a serving police officer in Derry on 22 February as Army experts tried to defuse it.\n\nThe device, which police described as more intricate than a pipe bomb, was reportedly discovered under a car in Culmore in the city.\n\nChildren were in the area at the time, police said.\n\nMeanwhile a gun attack on a 16-year-old boy in west Belfast on 16 February was \"child abuse,\" a senior police officer said.\n\nThe attack followed a similar one the previous night, when a man was shot in the legs close to a benefits office on the Falls Road.\n\nA man who admitted taking part in a paramilitary shooting in Belfast was sentenced to five years in jail and a further five years on licence.\n\nPatrick Joseph O'Neill, of no fixed address, was one of three masked men who forced their way into the victim's home in Ardoyne in November 2010.\n\nThe man was shot several times in the legs and groin in front of his mother, who fought back with kitchen knives.\n\nThe dissident republican group Ãglaigh na hÃireann claimed responsibility for the shooting shortly after it took place.\n\nWest Belfast man Joe Reilly, 43, was shot dead in his Glenwood Court, Poleglass home on 20 October.\n\nIt is understood a second man who was in the house was tied up by the gang.\n\nThe shooting was the second in the small estate in less than a week - the other victim was shot in the leg.\n\nPolice later said they believed the the murder was carried out by a paramilitary organisation and there may have been a drugs link.\n\nA man died after being shot three times in the leg in an alleyway at Butler Place, north Belfast, on15 April.\n\nMichael McGibbon, 33, was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, where he later died.\n\nPolice said Mr McGibbon contacted them to say two masked men had arrived at his house on the evening of 14 April.\n\nThe men asked him to come out of the house but he refused and the men told him they would come back.\n\nA murder investigation was launched after the death of prison officer Adrian Ismay, 11 days after he was injured in a booby-trap bomb attack in east Belfast.\n\nThe device exploded under the 52-year-old officer's van as he drove over a speed ramp in Hillsborough Drive on 4 March.\n\nDays later, the New IRA said it carried out the attack.\n\nMr Ismay was thought to have been making a good recovery from his injuries, but was rushed back to hospital on 15 March, where he died.\n\nA post-mortem examination found his death was as a \"direct result of the injuries\" he sustained in the bomb.\n\nSupt Mark McEwan said that from September 2014 there had been 15 bomb incidents in the Derry City and Strabane District council area.\n\nThey included seven attacks on the police.\n\nOn 10 October, a bomb was found in the grounds of a Derry hotel ahead of a police recruitment event.\n\nThe police recruitment event was cancelled. Two other police recruitment events in Belfast and Omagh went ahead despite bomb alerts at the planned venues.\n\nOn 16 October police said a \"military-style hand grenade\" was thrown at a patrol in Belfast as officers responded to reports of anti-social behaviour.\n\nPolice say the device, which failed to explode, was thrown at officers near Pottingers Quay.\n\nDissident republicans were suspected of being responsible for the attack.\n\nA bomb is found was found during a security alert in the Curryneiran estate in Derry on 17 February.\n\nPolice said they believe the bomb was intended to kill officers and that those who had left it showed a \"callous disregard for the safety of the community and police officers\".\n\nMeanwhile at least 40 dissident republican prisoners were involved in an incident at Maghaberry Prison on 2 February.\n\nPrison management withdrew staff from the landings in Roe House housing dissidents.\n\nA protest, involving about 200 people, took place outside the prison in support of the republican prisoners.\n\nOn 8 January, the head of MI5 says most dissident republican attacks in Northern Ireland in 2014 were foiled.\n\nAndrew Parker said of more than 20 such attacks, most were unsuccessful and that up to four times that amount had been prevented.\n\nHe made the remarks during a speech in which he gave a stark warning of the dangers UK was facing from terrorism.\n\nHe said it was \"unrealistic to expect every attack plan to be stopped\".\n\nDissident republicans are believed to have used a home-made rocket launcher in an attack on a police Land Rover at Twaddell Avenue in north Belfast on 16 November .\n\nIt struck the Land Rover and caused some damage, but no-one was injured.\n\nPolice described the attack as a \"cold, calculated attempt to kill police officers\".\n\nMeanwhile gardaÃ­ described the seizure of guns and bomb-making material during searches in Dublin on 15 November as a \"major setback\" for dissident republicans.\n\nAn AK-47 rifle, a sawn-off shotgun and a number of semi-automatic pistols were found in searches in the Ballymun, East Wall and Cloughran areas of Dublin.\n\nThe Irish Army carried out a controlled explosion at one search location where bomb components were discovered.\n\nA device that hit a police vehicle in Derry on 2 November was understood to have been a mortar, fired by command wire.\n\nDissident republicans were responsible for the attack, police said.\n\nOn the night of 29 May, a masked man threw what police have described as a \"firebomb\" into the reception area of the Everglades Hotel, in the Prehen area of Derry.\n\nThe hotel was evacuated and the device exploded a short time later when Army bomb experts were working to make it safe.\n\nNo-one was injured in the explosion but the reception was extensively damaged.\n\nThe man who took the bomb into the hotel said he was from the IRA.\n\nPolice said a bomb found at a County Tyrone golf course had the capability to kill or cause serious injury.\n\nBomb disposal experts made the device safe after it was discovered at Strabane Golf Club on 31 March.\n\nA Belfast man with known dissident republican links died on 28 March a week after he was shot in a Dublin gun attack.\n\nDeclan Smith, 32, was shot in the face by a lone gunman as he dropped his child at a crÃ¨che on Holywell Avenue, Donaghmede.\n\nHe was wanted by police in Northern Ireland for questioning about the murder of two men in Belfast in 2007.\n\nOn the night of 14 March, dissidents use a command wire to fire a mortar at a police Land Rover on the Falls Road in west Belfast.\n\nThe device hit the Land Rover, but police said it caused minimal damage.\n\nNo-one was injured in the attack.\n\nThe dissident group calling itself the New IRA said it carried out the attack and claimed the mortar used contained the military explosive Semtex and a commercial detonator.\n\nOn 13 December, a bomb in a sports bag exploded in Belfast's busy Cathedral Quarter.\n\nAbout 1,000 people were affected by the alert, including people out for Christmas dinners, pub-goers and children out to watch Christmas pantos.\n\nA telephone warning was made to a newspaper, but police said the bomb exploded about 150 metres away as the area was being cleared.\n\nDissident republican group, Ãglaigh na hÃireann, said it was were responsible.\n\nOn 5 December, two police vehicles were struck 10 times by gunfire from assault rifles while travelling along the Crumlin Road in north Belfast.\n\nA bomb, containing 60kgs (132lbs) of home-made explosives, partially exploded inside a car in Belfast city centre on 24 November.\n\nA masked gang hijacked the car, placed a bomb on board and ordered the driver to take it to a shopping centre.\n\nIt exploded as Army bomb experts prepared to examine the car left at the entrance to Victoria Square car park.\n\nNo-one was injured.\n\nOn 21 November, a bus driver was ordered to drive to
