Unable to tell friend from foe, the raw recruit must survive the night alone and find his way to safety through a disorienting, alien and deadly landscape.\n\n’71 is a 2014 British historical action film set in Northern Ireland written by Gregory Burke and directed by Yann Demange. It stars Jack O’Connell, Sean Harris, David Wilmot, Richard Dormer, Paul Anderson and Charlie Murphy, and tells the story of a British soldier who becomes separated from his unit during a riot in Belfast at the height of the Troubles in 1971. Filming began on location in Blackburn, Lancashire, in April 2013 and continued in Sheffield and Liverpool. The film was funded by the British Film Institute, Film4, Creative Scotland and Screen Yorkshire.\n\nThe film had its premiere in the competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, held in February 2014.\n\nPlot\n\nEnglish soldier Gary Hook, a new recruit to the British Army, takes leave of his much younger brother Darren. Hook’s platoon of British soldiers is sent to Belfast in 1971 in the early years of the Troubles. Under the leadership of the inexperienced Second Lieutenant Armitage, his platoon is deployed to a volatile area of Belfast where Catholic Nationalists and Protestant Loyalists live side by side. The unit provides support for the Royal Ulster Constabulary as it inspects homes for firearms, shocking Hook with their rough treatment of women and children. The Catholic neighbourhood has been alerted to the activity and a crowd gathers to protest and provoke the British troops who, though heavily armed, can only respond by trying to hold the crowd back.\n\nOne soldier is hit unconscious by a rock thrown by a protestor, leaving his rifle on the ground in the confusion and a young boy runs off through the mob with it; Hook and another pursue him. As the crowd’s protest escalates into stone-throwing, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and the other soldier are briefly rescued by a sympathetic woman who fails to hold back a small crowd who are beating them. Hook sees the other soldier shot dead at point blank range by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) gunman Paul Haggerty and then, with the crowd physically engaging him, Hook flees through streets and back alleys, finally eluding his pursuers and hiding until dark.\n\nA Protestant youngster brings Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for Loyalists, where he glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room constructing a bomb under the guidance of a member of the Military Reaction Force (MRF), the covert counter-insurgency unit of the British Army. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building, killing or injuring many of those inside, including the young boy who brought him there. Hook flees once more into the dark streets. Unaware that the Loyalist bombers have blown themselves up accidentally, the PIRA and Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) factions charge each other with responsibility for the bombing.\n\nTwo Catholics, Eamon and his daughter Brigid, discover Hook as he lies in a street unconscious and injured by shrapnel. They take him to their flat in the Divis Flats area and, even though they discover he is a British soldier, Eamon stitches his wounds. Despite the PIRA recently taking control over the area from the OIRA, Eamon contacts senior OIRA official Boyle for help, expecting a more humane solution than the PIRA faction would allow. Boyle, less radical and violent than the younger PIRA members, has a working relationship with the MRF. He tells MRF Captain Browning, leader of the local MRF section, of Hook’s whereabouts and asks in return that Browning kill James Quinn, a key leader of the PIRA faction.\n\nQuinn and his PIRA squad have been tailing Boyle since the pub explosion and saw him visit Eamon’s flat without knowing why he was there. Sensing danger, Hook flees the flat, taking a sheathed blade with him. Moving painfully through the flat complex halls and stairways, he eludes the PIRA men who have now learned of his presence and separated to search for him. Finally, unable to get away from Haggerty, who is about to come around a corner and discover him, Hook stabs him. As the wounded man lies dying, Hook reaches down and grasps his shoulder, sharing strength and sympathy as they hold each other’s gaze and the PIRA man dies.\n\nHook is captured by Quinn’s group and taken to a hideout. Quinn orders Sean, a young teenager whom Quinn has recruited, to murder Hook. When Sean hesitates, Quinn prepares to execute Hook, only to leave when Browning’s group arrives. Lewis, to Hook’s horror, shoots Sean. He then attempts to strangle Hook to prevent him from informing others of the bomb. As Lieutenant Armitage and his men enter in support of Browning, Armitage sees Lewis’ attempt to kill Hook. Sean raises himself and shoots Lewis dead before being shot again, this time by Armitage. Browning finds Quinn and rather than arrest him, tells him Boyle wants him dead. He promises to contact him soon, telling him he expects him to prove to be co-operative. Hook returns to his barracks. Later, despite a formal complaint by Armitage, the commanding officer dismisses the incident between Hook, Lewis and Sean as a confused situation that merits no further inquiry. Hook returns to England and reunites with Darren.\n\nReception\n\nWriting for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan called ‘71 “a tense thriller from Britain that so adroitly joins physical intensity, emotional authenticity and political acuity that you may find yourself forgetting to take a breath.” Manohla Dargis of The New York Times singled out Jack O’Connell for praise, saying, “Mr. O’Connell runs away with ‘71, in which his character’s every emotional, psychological and physical hurdle makes for kinetic cinema.” The Hollywood Reporter critic Leslie Felperin noted of Yann Demange’s direction,\n\n“A big part of [Demange’s] achievement resides in the casting of such a veteran crew of character actors in the first place, but credit is due for coaxing such subtle performances.”\n\nJonathan Romney in Film Comment praised the originality of the film, “a rare hybrid between hard-nosed realism, on the cusp of a quasi-documentary style, and genre thriller-adventure”, while criticising the opening and closing scenes as conventional.\n\n‘71 won Best Director at the 2014 British Independent Film Awards,[11]receiving nine nominations.\n\nThe National Board of Review named ‘71 one of the top 10 independent films of 2015\n\n—————————————–\n\n2)\n\nA Belfast Story\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland / Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1996\n\nWhat is peace? Is it when the bullets stop or the wounds heal?\n\nFull Movie\n\nA BELFAST STORY explores life after terrorism. Set in a city which has weathered hundreds of years of hatred, 30 years of bombs, and a war without winners, just victims. A new era brings new risks. There is peace, but that can also be deadly.\n\nPlot\n\nColm Meaney stars as a man weary of doing right. Times are changing, car bombs are less common and terrorists find themselves out of work, but old habits die hard. And while most go quietly into the night, he must find the few who won’t comply. Haunted by his own past failures, he knows that he may only get one last chance to repeat the same mistake, and this time, the blood will be on his hands.\n\nWhen a series of murders awaken dormant memories, many fear the worst. A greying assassin has stopped walking his son to school, purely precautionary. And his old comrades are also refusing to die gracefully. Someone is laying plans for the future, but first they must secure the present.\n\nGripping characters, fiercely intelligent action, and deadly consequences… A BELFAST STORY is a film about the passing of a way of life… and the dangers that brings, because in Ireland:\n\nSomeone always has to buy the last round…\n\n—————————————–\n\n3)\n\nA Further Gesture (The Break)\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland / Britain / Germany\n\nYear of Production: 1996\n\nPlot\n\nRea, an imprisoned IRA man, takes part in a violent jailbreak from the Maze prison. He is smuggled out to New York where he works as a dishwasher. He becomes friendly with a South American porter and becomes romantically involved with the man’s sister. Both brother and sister are part of a revolutionary cell, dedicated to the overthrow of the repressive regime in their country, but lack any basic military training. Rea trains them and draws up a successful assassination plan for them, helps them execute it and then attempts to escape with them. However, the authorities have been tailing him.\n\n—————————————–\n\n4)\n\nA Prayer for the Dying\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1988\n\nMartin Fallon (Mickey Rourke) and two fellow IRA terrorists accidentally blow up a school bus instead of a British military vehicle. Fallon’s friends escape, but he, devastated by the incident, turns his back on the Cause and escapes to London, where he hopes to find safe passage to the US. Instead, the IRA and the British police tail him, forcing him to depend on ruthless gangster Jack Meehan (Alan Bates), for a passport.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film begins with a small IRA team, including Martin Fallon (Mickey Rourke) and Liam Docherty (Liam Neeson), watching as two British Army Land Rovers approach the roadside bomb they have set for them. At the last minute, a school bus overtakes the army vehicles and detonates the bomb as it passes, killing the children. After most of the team escape the scene pursued by the soldiers, Fallon travels to London in a bid to escape the past. In London, he is approached by a contact who asks him to take on one last job on behalf of local gangster Jack Meehan (Alan Bates) and his brother Billy Meehan (Christopher Fulford). They offer Fallon money, a passport and passage to the US if he kills a rival gangster. Initially reluctant, he nonetheless takes on the job. However, as he is carrying out the hit in a graveyard, he is seen and confronted by the local Catholic priest, Father Michael Da Costa (Bob Hoskins). The confrontation is watched from a distance by Billy Meehan, who tells his brother there is a witness to the killing.\n\nFallon visits the church and confesses to the priest in a bid to ensure his silence; he also meets and finds himself becoming attracted to the priest’s blind niece Anna (Sammi Davis), who lives at the church along with her uncle. Meehan, however, insists that Fallon must kill the priest too and tells Fallon he will not be paid until the loose end is tied up. Fallon now finds himself targeted by both the Meehans and the IRA, who see him as a security risk following his disappearance, and send Docherty and another member, Siobhan Donovan (Alison Doody), to London to persuade him to return to Ireland. Billy Meehan eventually decides to take matters in his own hands and goes to the church looking for Fallon, but Anna kills him in a struggle when he attacks her after finding her alone in the church house. Fallon meanwhile manages to outwit a group of Meehan’s men who had been assigned to kill him after tricking him aboard a boat he was assured would be taking him to the US. Returning to the church, Fallon finds Jack Meehan with a bomb he intends to use to kill the priest and his niece but which will be blamed on Fallon and his IRA connections. After a struggle, Anna and Michael escape, but the bomb goes off killing Meehan and leaving Fallon fatally injured. In his dying moments, Fallon confesses his past to the priest, who grants him absolution. Fallon dies in peace.\n\nReception\n\nA Prayer for the Dying has a mixed reaction. Some liked Rourke’s performance. Others put fault in his Irish accent. Other critics thought Bob Hoskins was miscast in his portrayal of the priest.\n\nBoth Mike Hodges and Mickey Rourke have disowned the film as it wasn’t the finished film they intended to make.\n\nOn Film 87, Hodges tried to take his name off as he felt Sam Goldwyn studio had drastically altered the film. According to film producer Peter Snell only 3 minutes had been cut out.\n\n—————————————–\n\n5)\n\nA Sense of Loss\n\nCountry of Origin: USA / Switzerland\n\nYear of Production: 1978\n\nFull Movie\n\nA “searing but balanced documentary about the never-ending conflict in Northern Ireland,” by the director of The Sorrow and the Pity.\n\n—————————————–\n\n6)\n\nA Terrible Beauty\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain/USA\n\nYear of Production: 1960\n\nA Terrible Beauty (a.k.a. The Night Fighters) is a 1960 drama film, directed by Tay Garnett and starring Robert Mitchum and Richard Harris.It was adapted from a 1958 novel of the same name, written by Arthur Roth.\n\nIt was an international co-production between the United Kingdom and Robert Mitchum’s production company DRM.\n\nPlot\n\nDermot O’Neill (Mitchum) is recruited into the Irish Republican Army (IRA) when a unit is formed in his Northern Ireland town during the Second World War. Reaction to the news is mixed. His mother is strongly against it, while his father (Harry Brogan) is proud. His brother Ned (Niall MacGinnis) and sister Bella are ambivalent. Dermot’s girlfriend, Neeve Donnelly (Anne Heywood), breaks up with him, telling him the IRA will turn him into a murderer.\n\nDermot and his friend Sean Reilly (Harris) are chosen from their unit to participate in a raid on a British armoury to steal weapons and ammunition. Don McGinnis (Dan O’Herlihy) is frustrated because, as commandant of the unit, he is too important to risk. The theft goes off without a hitch.\n\nHowever, their next attack, to destroy a guarded power plant in concert with a planned German invasion, results in bloodshed. To get away, Dermot shoots a soldier blocking the way out. Sean is wounded in the foot and Johnny Corrigan is killed. Dermot and Sean evade their pursuers and manage to cross the border to safety in Ireland. Dermot returns home, leaving his friend to recuperate.\n\nDespite Dermot’s advice to stay away, Sean tries to sneak back across the border and is captured by the police. Dermot wants to stage a rescue, but McGinnis turns him down. Sean is sentenced to ten years imprisonment.\n\nMcGinnis decides to get revenge by attacking a police barracks. Dermot opposes this plan, as a policeman’s wife and children are living there, and warns that he will tell the authorities if McGinnis does not change his mind. When the commandant refuses to back down, Dermot tells McGinnis he is quitting the IRA. He is beaten up, but fortunately, a police patrol comes upon the scene before the IRA members can do anything more drastic. Dermot carries through on his threat, telling Sergeant Crawley, though without naming names. He is abducted to stand trial as an informant.\n\nBella becomes concerned when her brother does not come home. She goes to Neeve. The two then consult Dermot’s good friend, cobbler Jimmy Hannafin (Cyril Cusack). Jimmy has a pretty good idea what has happened. He gets Ned to help in the rescue. Neeve refuses to be left behind, but Bella is sent home to reassure her parents. Once they find and free Dermot, guarded only by youngster Quinn, Jimmy arranges for a friend to give Dermot a ride to Belfast, where he can leave the country. Neeve goes with him.\n\nMeanwhile, the IRA men start searching for him. McGinnis stations himself at the O’Neill home. In the darkness and driving rain, he mistakes the returning Bella (wearing Dermot’s coat) for the fugitive and shoots her dead. He is horrified to discover that he has killed the woman he loves.\n\n—————————————–\n\n7)\n\nAcceptable Levels\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1983\n\nPlot\n\nThis study of a British TV crew interviewing a Belfast family in the war-strewn Catholic district focuses upon the death of a child hit by a stray plastic bullet fired by a British soldier. The chief reporter becomes politically involved in the incident, whilst her producer is apprehensive and, once back in London, makes sure that the most indicting footage is destroyed.\n\n—————————————–\n\n8)\n\nAn Everlasting Piece\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland\n\nYear of Production: 2000\n\nA comedy about selling wigs in Belfast in the 1980s. Barry McEvoy plays Colm (a Catholic) who cuts hair in a mental hospital, where he meets ‘The Scalper’ (Billy Connolly), a crazed Scot, who ran a toupee monopoly in Northern Ireland before losing the plot and attacking his customers. Colm and his pal George (Brian F O’Byrne, who plays a Protestant) use The Scalper’s contacts to take over the franchise but then a rival firm moves in and a sales battle ensues.\n\nBarry McEvoy wrote the script based on stories his father told him about Belfast.\n\nAn Everlasting Piece is a 2000 American comedy film. The movie was directed by Barry Levinson. It was written by and starred Barry McEvoy. The plot involves two wig salesmen, one Catholic and one Protestant, who live in war-torn Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the mid-1980s. The supporting cast includes comedian Billy Connolly as an patient in a psychiatric hospital. McEvoy based the screenplay on the adventures of his father as a toupée peddler to both sides in the midst of the conflict. The movie was shot on location in both Belfast and Dublin.\n\nPlot\n\nColm (Barry McEvoy) takes a job as a barber in a Belfast psychiatric hospital. He meets the staff and is warned against talking about poetry with George, a fellow barber (Brían F. O’Byrne). when he brings it up, George subjects him to his own poor work. The pair chat anyway. Later they meet an orderly escorting a new patient, whom he refers to as “The Scalper” (Billy Connolly), described as the only seller of hair pieces in all of Northern Ireland until he had a nervous breakdown and scalped some of his own customers. Colm and George decide to meet with the Scalper to gain his list of customers; they intend to take over his former hairpiece monopoly. The Scalper agrees to give them the list.\n\nColm and George, calling themselves “The Piece People”, embark on their plan to get rich. Colm’s girlfriend Bronagh (Anna Friel) helps. She sets up their first appointment with a Mr Black (Des McAleer), who eventually agrees to buy a hairpiece, although he denies having been a customer of “The Scalper”. Bronagh had seen his picture in the newspaper (featured after he shot a Catholic) and, as he was bald, thought he’d be a good prospect. Having little success in sales, Colm and George discover they have competition from “Toupée or not Toupée”, rivals who also acquired the client list. The supplier, “Wigs Of Wimbledon”, decides to hold a meeting with two companies to inform them that the one who sells the most in a given time period will win an exclusive rights for all of Northern Ireland. The partners visit a farmer but lose the sale, learning that their competitors are underselling them. On a remote road, they are stopped by members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), demanding to know what they are up to. This confrontation results in the partners selling a wig to the lead IRA man (Colum Convey), who fails to notice it had been chewed by dogs.\n\nThe competition is raging, but the IRA man accidentally leaves the unique wig at the scene of a bombing. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) trace it to The Piece People. After being interrogated, George and Colm have a falling out. Meanwhile, the IRA man who lost the wig tracks Colm down and demands Colm sell him his whole inventory because now every bald Catholic in Northern Ireland is a potential suspect for the police. Colm refuses as his business partner is a Protestant and thinks it would be unethical to protect the IRA because the sales would likely help The Piece People win the exclusive deal with Wigs Of Wimbledon.\n\nColm goes to a poetry reading by George and the two make peace. With the help of Bronagh, the duo learn that many British Army soldiers in Northern Ireland are suffering from alopecia (hair loss) due to the stressful conditions, and secure a government contract to supply wigs to all soldiers who want them. With this, they win the competition and gain the rights to Northern Ireland.\n\nLawsuit against Dreamworks\n\nIn 2001, one of the film’s producers, Jerome O’Connor, filed a $10 million lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan against Steven Spielberg‘s studio DreamWorks, the film’s distributor. He complained that, although his film had received favorable reviews, the studio had reduced distribution from a projected 800 to eight theaters in the United States, and then pulled it from distribution. O’Connor alleged the film was “sabotaged” because director Barry Levinson would not change scenes to please British officials in its Foreign Office, which objected to its “sympathetic portrayal” of the IRA. O’Connor claimed DreamWorks officials feared the film might interfere with Steven Spielberg‘s attaining an honorary knighthood (which Spielberg received in January 2001).\n\nO’Connor argued that then Prime Minister Tony Blair had arranged for a loan of military equipment and 2,000 troops to Spielberg’s production of Band of Brothers (TV miniseries), which aired in 2001 on HBO, and that Spielberg gave Blair’s son Euan a job in the production, indicating a quid pro quo.\n\nA DreamWorks spokesman said the studio had not requested any film cuts. An Everlasting Piece was released on DVD, and the film, which had a $14,000,000 budget, earned $75,228.\n\nA decade after filing his lawsuit, a New York judge dismissed it in February 2011. O’Connor’s counsel reserved the right to file an appeal, but ultimately did not file one.\n\nReception\n\nAn Everlasting Piece received mixed reviews from critics and holds a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews.\n\n—————————————–\n\n9)\n\nAngel\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland\n\nYear of Production: 1982\n\nBleak drama of a saxophone player who witnesses his manager’s murder. The film narrative occurs against the backdrop of the Troubles.\n\nPlot\n\nDanny (played by Stephen Rea), a saxophonist with a travelling band, witnesses the gangland murder of the band’s manager (involved in extortion payoffs) and that of a deaf and mute girl witness at a dancehall in South Armagh. Danny tries to hunt down the murderers and in doing so his relationship with Deirdre, the singer in his band, falls apart and he becomes a murderer himself.\n\nProduction\n\nThe film is set in Northern Ireland and it is implied that the extortionists/murderers are loyalist paramilitaries (one is described as “a Prod” by his Catholic girlfriend; another is a policeman). However, there is little specific reference to the Northern Ireland Troubles.\n\nThe film was made in and around inner-city Dublin (standing in for Belfast) and Jordan’s native Bray. In the sequences where the band play in a seaside resort (probably supposed to be Portstewart, since Danny is shown asking older bandsmen about their memories of his late uncle, whom we are earlier told played in a band at Portstewart) Bray Head is visible in some background shots. Other locations include the former Butlin’s holiday camp in Mosney, County Meath, and the former Mental Hospital, Grangegorman.\n\nThe dance and crowd scenes from the Mosney ballroom had to be re-shot due to a problem with the film processing.\n\n—————————————–\n\n10)\n\nBloody Sunday\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain / Ireland\n\nYear of Production: 2001 (first screened on ITV, 20 January 2002)\n\nPlot\n\nBloody Sunday deals with the events that happened in Derry on 30 January 1972. During a civil rights march the British Army shot dead 13 civilian protesters and wounded another 14 people (one of whom died later in the year). The story was filmed in a documentary style that employed hand-held cameras throughout. The film deals with the 24 hour period of Bloody Sunday and thus does not cover the aftermath.\n\n[The film was first shown on ITV (Britain) but also given a limited cinema release and also went straight to video.]\n\nBloody Sunday is a 2002 film about the 1972 “Bloody Sunday” shootings in Derry, Northern Ireland. Although produced by Granada Television as a TV film, it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 16 January, a few days before its screening on ITV on 20 January, and then in selected London cinemas from 25 January. The production was written and directed by Paul Greengrass. Though set in Derry, the film was actually shot in Ballymun in North Dublin. However, some location scenes were shot in Derry, in Guildhall Square and in Creggan on the actual route of the march in 1972.\n\nReception\n\nThe film was critically acclaimed. It won the Audience Award at Sundance and the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival (tied with Spirited Away), in addition to the Hitchcock d’Or best film prize at the Dinard Festival of British Cinema.\n\nBloody Sunday appeared a week before Jimmy McGovern‘s TV film on the same subject, entitled Sunday (shown by Channel 4).\n\nIt holds a 92% approval rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 102 collected reviews, with an average score of 7.9/10.

Jimmy Dove (Jeff Bridges) is a veteran member of the police force’s bomb squad, on the verge of retirement and helping to train newer recruits. Dove hides that he is really Liam McGivney, a former member of a Northern Ireland terrorist cell. Dove had been friends with Gaerity, but when Gaerity tried to set off a bomb that would have killed numerous civilians, McGivney (now Dove) interceded, ending in the death of his girlfriend, Gaerity’s sister and leading to Gaerity’s imprisonment. Devastated, McGivney/Dove had moved to Boston and took on the Dove identity, hoping to find atonement in defusing bombs and saving others. Only Dove’s uncle Max O’Bannon (Lloyd Bridges) is aware of this past and expresses his desire for Dove to retire earlier, having clearly shown his atonement.\n\nGaerity makes his way to Boston, taking residence in an abandoned casino boat, and tracks down Dove/McGivney. Gaerity takes a job as a janitor at the police station to learn more about Dove’s present life and those of his co-workers. Gaerity sets up bombs specifically designed to kill the defusers, which kill three of Dove/McGivney’s team members. Dove recognizes Gaerity’s work in the bomb designs, and realizes that his wife Kate (Suzy Amis) and daughter are in danger. He explains his true past to them, and convinces them to go into hiding at a nearby beach house. Another squad member, rookie technician Anthony Franklin (Forest Whitaker), who has linked Dove/McGivney’s former life to Gaerity, is safely rescued from another bomb planted by Gaerity with Dove’s aid, and promises Dove any assistance he can offer.\n\nMax decides to try to stop Gaerity himself, trying to get close to him at an Irish bar, but instead ends up captured by Gaerity, and latched into a makeshift bomb. Dove tracks down Max, and goes to retrieve his tools, but Max, realizing that Gaerity created the bomb to kill both of them, intentionally triggers the bomb while Dove is away, sacrificing himself. In analyzing the bomb’s debris, Dove finds a roulette ball that points to the abandoned ship, and tracks Gaerity there. Gaerity reveals that he has set up another bomb in Kate’s car and activates its arming mechanism before engaging with Dove in a large melee fight throughout the booby-trapped ship, rigged to blow up in a few minutes. With Dove gaining the upper hand. Gaerity handcuffs himself to Dove, preventing him from leaving. Dove is saved by Franklin, who had followed Dove to the ship, and the two escape in time before the ship explodes.\n\nThe two race back to the city, hoping to stop Kate before she starts the car. They arrive too late but are able to catch up to Kate, and Dove jumps into her car. He finds the complex bomb and manages to defuse it in time. As they recover, Franklin tells Dove he knows his past identity but will keep it a secret if he can take credit for taking down Gaerity; Dove agrees and gives Franklin his badge before leaving with Kate and his daughter.\n\nProduction\n\nIt was the first action film starring Jeff Bridges.\n\nReception\n\nBlown Away received negative reviews from critics and holds a 28% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews. The film was widely criticized for the poor Irish accents of the three main Irish characters, with Tommy Lee Jones’ portrayal of Ryan Gaerity particularly receiving the harshest criticism.\n\nRelease\n\nThe VHS of the film was released on December 14th 1994.

His mission is thwarted when he is apprehended, charged and imprisoned in Borstal, a reform institution for young offenders in East Anglia, England. At Borstal, Brendan is forced to live face-to-face with those he regarded as his enemies, a confrontation that reveals a deep inner conflict in the young Brendan and forces a self-examination that is both traumatic and revealing. Events take an unexpected turn and Brendan is thrown into a complete spin. In the emotional vortex, he finally faces up to the truth.\n\n—————————————–\n\n14)\n\nCal\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1984\n\nFull Movie\n\nBased on Bernard MacLaverty’s novel about a Catholic living in a Protestant neighbourhood in Northern Ireland. He had been involved in the murder of an RUC man, but later gets a job from the family of the dead officer, and begins an affair with the dead man’s wife\n\nPlot\n\nCal (John Lynch) is a young Catholic member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1970s Northern Ireland. He is used as a driver on a nighttime murder of a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The murder takes place at the victim’s home in view of his family. The victim’s dying words are a call for his wife, Marcella.\n\nOne year later, Cal learns that the victim’s widow is a librarian, Marcella (Helen Mirren), a Catholic woman. Burdened with guilt over his role in the murder, Cal tries to leave the IRA, but is pressu.red to remain a member. He and his father live in the city, where they are threatened with loyalist gangs and Orange Order marches on their street. Wishing to atone in some way for assisting in the murder of Marcella’s husband, Cal seeks work in her family’s Protestant home. Initially he works as a hand on their farm, and later moves into a small cottage on their land. Marcella is not happy in her home, feeling trapped by her deceased husband’s family. Over time, Cal and Marcella begin a love affair—with Marcella unaware of Cal’s role in her husband’s death.\n\nEventually, Cal is found by his IRA unit and is threatened with murder if he does not continue working as a driver. While he is Christmas shopping for Marcella and her child, he is abducted by the IRA. The car is stopped by a British Army checkpoint. In the ensuing gunfire, Cal escapes and makes his way to Marcella’s home, where he confesses his role in the murder. Cal is pursued to the house by the RUC, and in the film’s final scene both Cal and Marcella are seen in their respective “prisons”—Cal on his way to prison in a police van, and Marcella on her way back to her in-laws’ home.\n\nReception\n\nAs of 16 March 2011, the aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes has recorded 91% positive response based on 11 reviews\n\n—————————————–\n\n15)\n\nClosing the Ring\n\nCountry of Origin: UK / Ireland\n\nYear of Production: 2007\n\nA young man searches for the proper owner of a ring that belonged to a U.S. World War II bomber gunner who crashed in Belfast, Northern Ireland on June 1, 194.\n\nDuring the 1940s, a group of young men go off to war, leaving behind Ethel Ann (Mischa Barton), who is in love with one of them, Teddy. In modern-day Belfast, a man named Jimmy (Martin McCann) endeavors to return a ring found in the wreckage of a crashed plane. He travels to Michigan, where the grown Ethel Ann (Shirley MacLaine), who married another man after Teddy was killed in battle, now lives. Ethel Ann must decide whether to go with Jimmy to meet the soldier who last saw Teddy alive.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film opens in 1991, with the funeral of a World War II veteran. The man’s daughter Marie (Neve Campbell) delivers the eulogy to a church full of veterans who knew and loved her father, while her mother Ethel Ann (Shirley MacLaine) is sitting out on the church porch, smoking and nursing a hangover. When Ethel Ann begins acting strangely, only her friend Jack (Christopher Plummer) seems to understand why. It quickly emerges that there is a lot Marie does not know about her mother’s past and the true story of her love life.\n\nInadvertently caught up in cross-border troubles, Jimmy flees Belfast, travelling to Michigan to give Ethel Ann the ring. Ethel Ann reveals a wall covered in souvenirs of Teddy, which Jack and Chuck boarded up for her in 1944. Marie is shocked and furious to learn that her mother loved not Chuck, but Teddy’s memory. Ethel Ann travels to Belfast with Jimmy. She holds the hand of a dying British soldier caught in an IRA car-bomb attack. Quinlan (Pete Postlethwaite) finally confesses to Ethel Ann that he was on the hill when Teddy died, and that Teddy’s dying words freed Ethel Ann from her promise to love him forever, that she was “free to make her own choice”. A tearful Quinlan tells her he spent 50 years looking for the ring that was lost in the final blast that killed Teddy, and is filled with regret for never having fulfilled his promise to inform Ethel of Teddy’s dying words. Joining Ethel Ann in Belfast, Jack finally admits that he has always loved her. Ethel Ann is finally able to cry and properly grieve. They share a long hug (and it’s implied they finally begin a romance.)\n\nReception\n\nThe film attracted a mixed critical response.\n\nAccording to the Toronto International Film Festival it “exemplifies the balance between the epic and the intimate that has been the hallmark of Lord Richard Attenborough’s venerable career…Attenborough traces multiple themes with ease and grace, giving his celebrated ensemble cast ample opportunity to shine”. It concluded that the film is “a remarkable tale of love, loss and redemption that stands proudly among the films of one of the cinema’s living legends. Deftly weaving together different eras and locales, Attenborough has produced another grand canvas about the emotional repercussions of a wartime promise.”\n\nDerek Malcolm of the Evening Standard wrote that it “is well-acted throughout and it has a romantic appeal that is not to be sneered at..”\n\nAlan Morrison of Empire wrote “After recent disappointments Sir Dickie Attenborough is back on better, albeit old-fashioned, form.”\n\nPhilip French of The Observer wrote “Woodward’s script is more than a little contrived, as well as over-emphatic. But Attenborough has infused it with warmth and mature insight, and older members of the audience are likely to find it extremely moving.”\n\nLaura Bushell of BBCi Films called the film a “looping tale of love and loss in WWII which is so old fashioned in its aspirations, it’s hard to see why new audiences would flock to see it.”\n\nVariety called the film “decades-skipping schmaltz” and an “aggressively bittersweet yet oddly uninvolving drama\n\n—————————————-\n\n16)\n\nDear Sarah\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland\n\nYear of Production 1990\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe film is based on the letters Giuseppe Conlon wrote from prison to his wife Sarah after he was convicted in 1976 along with six members of the Maguire family of running an IRA bomb factory in North London. Conlon received twelve years imprisonment, but died in custody in 1980.\n\nSarah Conlon spent many years campaigning to clear the names of her husband, and son Gerry (who had been wrongly jailed over the 1974 Guildford pub bombings). The others jailed along with Giuseppe Conlon were later released after serving their sentences, and the convictions were quashed on appeal in 1991. The Guildford Four had their convictions overturned in 1989.\n\n—————————————-\n\n17)\n\nElephant\n\nCountry of Origin UK\n\nYear of production 1989\n\nA depiction of a series of violent killings in Northern Ireland with no clue as to exactly who is responsible.\n\nPlot\n\nElephant is a 1989 British short film directed by Alan Clarke and produced by Danny Boyle. The film is set in Northern Ireland during the Troubles and its title comes from Bernard MacLaverty’s description of the conflict as “the elephant in our living room” — a reference to the collective denial of the underlying social problems of Northern Ireland. Produced by BBC Northern Ireland, it first screened on BBC2 in 1989. The film was first conceived by Boyle, who was working as a producer for BBC Northern Ireland at the time\n\nThe film, which contains very little dialogue, depicts eighteen murders and is partly based on actual events drawn from police reports at the time. It is shot with 16mm film with much of it filmed using a steadicam and features a series of tracking shots, a technique the director used regularly. The grainy 16mm film, together with the lack of dialogue, plot, narrative and music give the film a cold, observational documentary feel. Nothing is learnt about any of the gunmen or victims. Each of the murders are carried out calmly and casually; in one scene the gunman is seen to drive away slowly, even stopping to give way for traffic. The victims are shown for several seconds in a static shot of the body.\n\nReception\n\nAs with several of Clarke’s films, “Elephant” received high praise and attracted controversy. After watching the film, Clarke’s contemporary David Leland wrote:\n\n“I remember lying in bed, watching it, thinking, ‘Stop, Alan, you can’t keep doing this.’ And the cumulative effect is that you say, ‘It’s got to stop. The killing has got to stop.’ Instinctively, without an intellectual process, it becomes a gut reaction.”\n\nThe film is a clear influence on Gus Van Sant’s 2003 film Elephant, based on the Columbine High School Massacre. Van Sant’s film borrowed not only Clarke’s title, but also closely mirrors his minimalist style.\n\n—————————————-\n\n18)\n\nFifty Dead Men Walking\n\nCountry of Origin: UK / Canada\n\nYear of Production: 2008\n\nBased on the book Fifty Dead men Walking by Martin McGartland (2001) the film tells the story of McGartland’s recruitment by the RUC Special Branch as a paid informer on the IRA.\n\nFifty Dead Men Walking is a 2008 English-language crime thriller film written and directed by Kari Skogland. It is a loose adaptation of Martin McGartland‘s 1997 autobiography of the same name. It premiered in September 2008, and stars Jim Sturgess as Martin McGartland, a British agent who went undercover into the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), and Ben Kingsley as Fergus, his British handler.\n\nThe film is set from 1988 until 1991, the time in which McGartland acted as an undercover agent within the IRA during The Troubles. In 1991, his cover was blown and he was kidnapped by the IRA, although he later escaped from an interrogation and execution, and went into hiding.\n\nAt the time of the release of the film, McGartland was still in hiding. The film takes its name from McGartland’s claim within his book to have saved the lives of fifty people (police officers, soldiers, and prison guards) during his time as an agent.\n\nMcGartland disowned the film as was reported in the Sunday Times on 29 March 2009. He told the Sunday Times that “they are saying it was based on a true story, but what is the definition of ‘based on a true story’? Is it 50% true, 70% true, 10%?” The Sunday Times further reported that McGartland contended:\n\n“that the movie is fundamentally a lie that misrepresents his career and his motivation. He believes that if Kari Skogland, the director, had stuck closer to the account he gave in his book and in a BBC documentary, then she would have had a better film.”\n\nThe film is also notable for an infamous error which has remained uncorrected from the cinema release to the DVD and Netflix release: the end titles refer to the peace process of “2007”, when of course the Good Friday Agreement and associated talks were a whole decade earlier, in 1997.\n\nPlot\n\nMartin McGartland (Jim Sturgess) is a 21-year-old street hustler from Northern Ireland, living in the late 1980s. The Irish Republican Army wants to recruit him, but he is reluctant because of what he sees as their cruel street justice. Because of his connection to the community, the British police want him to infiltrate and spy on the IRA. Marty agrees because of the car and money he gets from the police and because he despises the IRA. The IRA accepts him as a Volunteer and in that position he learns of various planned attacks. He then informs Fergus, his police contact, to prevent these attacks. He builds up a new sense of self-esteem, but he cannot tell his family and friends about his activities. Even his new girlfriend Lara (Natalie Press) only notices that he seems to do some work for the IRA, which worries her.\n\nAll along, the British accept the risk that the IRA may discover that Marty works for them. They do not plan to rescue him in that case. When it happens, the IRA capture and torture Marty, but he manages to escape by throwing himself out of a window. His handler Fergus is now his only ally—he finds him and helps him hide. Fergus offers to arrange for Marty and Lara and their children to live in Scotland but Marty realises that she would never be able to feel safe. He then goes on the run to Canada alone, leaving his family behind. As shown at the start of the film, he is shot there by the IRA and survives.\n\nReception\n\nRoger Ebert gave Fifty Dead Men Walking three out of four stars. Empire Magazine awarded the film three out of five stars and praised Sturgess’ performance, although they noted that “some stylistic slip-ups let him down a little.”\n\nThe Guardian awarded the film three out of five stars and said “producer-director Kari Skogland has put together an effective, if cinematically unambitious, enterprise.”\n\nRecognition\n\nOn the basis of Canadian involvement in its financing, Fifty Dead Men Walking was nominated for Best Canadian Film at the 30th Genie Awards in 2010. The film won several awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay at the Genie Awards and Best Feature Length Drama at the Leo Awards\n\n—————————————-\n\n19)\n\nFive Minutes of Heaven\n\nCountry of Origin: UK\n\nYear of Production: 2008\n\nFull Movie\n\nDramatises the story Alistair Little, a UVF member, who spent 13 years in jail for killing Jim Griffin (21) from Lurgan on 29 October 1975. Jim’s 11-year-old brother Joe witnessed the killing. Most of the drama takes place during an attempted reconcilliation 33 years later. Liam Neeson plays Alistair Little and James Nesbitt plays Joe Griffin.\n\nFive Minutes of Heaven is a British and Irish film directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel from a script by Guy Hibbert. The film was premiered on 19 January 2009 at the 25th Sundance Film Festival where it won the World Cinema Dramatic Directing Award for Oliver Hirschbiegel, and the World Cinema Screenwriting Award for Guy Hibbert. It was broadcast on BBC Two on 5 April 2009, and also had an international theatrical release.\n\nThe first part reconstructs the historical killing of 19-year-old Jim Griffin by 17-year-old Alistair Little in 1975, and the second part depicts a fictional meeting between Little and Jim’s brother Joe 33 years later.\n\nPlot\n\nIn Lurgan, Northern Ireland, during 1975 and the Northern Irish Troubles, the Irish Republican Army are targeting British loyalists and the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force are exacting revenge on Catholics they claim are militant republicans. Alistair Little, 17, is the leader of a UVF cell, eager to let blood. He and his gang are given the go-ahead to kill a young Catholic man, James Griffin, as a reprisal and a warning to others. When they kill Griffin, his 8-year old little brother Joe Griffin watches in horror. Little is arrested and sentenced to prison for 12 years.\n\nThirty-three years after the murder, Little and Griffin have been set up to meet on camera by a reconciliation project. Little has served his sentence and peace has been agreed to in Northern Ireland, but Joe Griffin is not coming on the programme for a handshake. He is carrying a knife and intends to murder his brother’s killer during the meeting. However, just before he is to go on camera, he becomes extremely agitated and demands that the cameras be removed. When the producers try to calm him, he leaves, and the two men don’t meet.\n\nLittle offers to meet Griffin, and Griffin accepts. As he reaches for the knife, his wife tries to stop him, and he pushes her to the floor. Griffin asks Little to meet him at Griffin’s old house, where Little murdered his brother, now abandoned and boarded up. Griffin, full of hate and wanting vengeance, attacks Little from behind and attempts to stab him. They fight and fall through a second story window and fall to the street outside. Both are hurt. Little tells Griffin that he’s leaving for Belfast. He explains why he killed Griffin’s brother. He tells Griffin to “get rid of me”, to tell his family that he’s killed Little and to live his life for them, not for vengeance against Little.\n\nGriffin very shakily lights up a cigarette as Little pulls himself from the wall he was sitting against and limps down the road. Soon after, Griffin attends a therapy group and tells them, crying, that he wants to be a good father for his daughters. He calls Little and tells him, “We’re finished.” Little appears happy and befuddled, not quite sure what to do next.\n\nThe film won two awards at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival – Recipient of the World Cinema Directing Award: Dramatic and the World Cinema Screenwriting Award.\n\nThe film received UK and Irish premieres in Belfast and Dublin during February 2009. The film is due to be broadcast on BBC2 in March 2009.\n\nReception\n\nAfter Five Minutes of Heaven‘s Sundance screenings, Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter called it “very good at stating the obvious but fails to bring new insight to this age-old morality tale”. He cited the scenes featuring Mark Davison (as the young Little) andAnamaria Marinca (as a television producer) as “the only time the movie sparks to life”.\n\nDennis Harvey for Variety was complimentary of Hibbert’s screenplay and of Neeson’s acting.\n\nPadraic Geoghegan of RTÉ Entertainment criticized the lack of screen-time given to Griffin’s family, and for not showing how Little came to be helping others like him in the present-day scenes. Geoghegan praised the flashback scenes, Hirschbeigel’s direction, and Neeson and Nesbitt’s acting.\n\nThe Irish Times‘ Michael Dwyer rated the film four out of five stars. Of the acting, he wrote,\n\nNesbitt vividly portrays Griffin as a man still coiled with rage and horror by indelible memories of a living nightmare when he was a boy. And Neeson’s haunted features reveal the guilt and pain Little has carried since he committed his terrible crime\n\nAndrew Johnston for Culture Northern Ireland wrote,\n\nUnlike some other Ulster-set pictures, Five Minutes of Heaven presents real people with real emotions, rather than political caricatures or slavish impersonations. There’s a slight sense that most of the budget went on securing Neeson, but the minimalist soundtrack, grotty colour scheme and amateurish fight scenes help underline the emptiness of the lead characters and the desolation of their predicament.[\n\n—————————————-\n\n20)\n\nFour Days in July\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1985\n\nFour Days in July is a 1985 television film by Mike Leigh. Set and filmed in Belfast, the film explores the Troubles by following the daily lives of two couples on either side of Northern Ireland’s religious divide, both expecting their first children.\n\nThe film’s action unfolds over 10–13 July 1984; the two couples’ children are both born on 12 July, the date of a Protestant celebration in Northern Ireland known as the Twelfth.\n\nDespite the politically charged setting, the film is uniquely uneventful, at least on the surface; Paul Clements writes that “It is hard to identify any full length work by Leigh in which less of consequence seems to happen.” Broadcast once in January 1985, it was Leigh’s last film for the BBC.\n\nReception\n\nIn 2009 The Times’ Kevin Maher praised the film as a “must-see movie for anyone with a compassionate interest in an 800-year-old political sore.”\n\nShane Connaughton, screenwriter of My Left Foot called it, “easily the most interesting picture I’ve seen about Northern Ireland since the troubles started. Apart from John Arden and Margaretta D’Arcy’s The Ballygomben Bequest (1972), I can’t think of any play or film that has gone into it so successfully in any deep way at all.\n\n—————————————-\n\n21)\n\nGiro City\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1982\n\nStarring Oscar winner Glenda Jackson as an investigative journalist who uncovers local government corruption and then gets involved with the IRA.

He dates a Catholic, Josephine Laverty, and unknowingly encounters Downes in a local club, which is raided by the British Army. A British soldier recognises Harry, but ignores him and arrests Downes, who is interrogated but set free. Harry tips off his superiors that the killer was at the club and that Theresa, a girl at whose family home Billy stayed the night while on the run, knows his name. Theresa is arrested, but caught between the police interrogator Rennie and her fear of the IRA if she talks, she hangs herself in prison before revealing Downes’ identity. When Josephine realises Harry must have passed on the information about Theresa, she tells him to leave while he can, but he refuses, saying Danby’s killer cannot be allowed to get away with the murder.\n\nA waiter overhears two army officers discussing Harry’s presence in Belfast while eating at his restaurant. He reports Harry’s presence to the IRA, and the local IRA boss starts checking all new arrivals, including Harry.\n\nThe IRA start to hunt Harry down. With two other gunmen, Downes ambushes Harry, who shoots the gunmen and forces a passing driver to chase their car as Downes escapes. Harry follows Downes to his own home, which is under surveillance by the army. Harry shoots Downes in the street in front of his wife, and is himself shot by the soldiers watching the house, who think he is a terrorist. Injured and bleeding in the street, Harry is confronted by Downes’s wife, who then shoots him in the head using Harry’s own revolver.\n\nThe film closes with a narrator reading a part of a poem written by the daughter of an IRA victim (William Staunton, a 46-year-old Catholic shot dead by the IRA on 25 January 1973, near Saint Dominic’s School, Falls Road): “Don’t cry, Mummy said. They’re not real, but Daddy was, and he’s not here. Don’t be bitter, Mummy said. They’ve hurt themselves much more. They can walk and run, Daddy can’t”.\n\nLocation\n\nHarry’s Game was filmed in Leeds, in Yorkshire, England, on a now-demolished housing district in Burley, which was adjacent to Leeds Studios.\n\nThe footage filmed in Belfast includes shots of the Falls Road and the city, including the scene where Harry is frisked on entry to the city centre (there was a permanent checkpoint for pedestrians there for many years), whilst some of the final scenes overlooking the cityscape took place in Holywood, County Down and close to the military/MI5 barracks. Scenes were also filmed in the south of County Dublin including the Ballybrack area.\n\nBroadcast and distribution history\n\nThe series originally screened on the ITV network as three 52-to-54 minute episodes over consecutive nights from 25 to 27 October 1982, and was later edited into a single 130 minute programme titled Harry’s Game – The Movie. While Clannad’s theme tune for it became their breakthrough hit, the film itself was not widely seen in the US or widely available on video, although it appeared in Canada titled Belfast Assassin. The original, unedited three-part serial was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2005.\n\nIn 1997, a film called The Informant was released with Timothy Dalton as Rennie, and Sean McGinley as Frankie. This film was based on Field of Blood, also by Seymour. The character of Rennie also appeared in Seymour’s book The Journeyman Tailor.\n\n—————————————-\n\n25)\n\nHennessy\n\nYear of Production: 1975\n\nFull Movie\n\nSet in the Seventies, Hennessy is a Irishman who believes in peace, but who has had connections to the IRA. Hennessy’s family is killed by a bomb, and he plots revenge, setting out to assassinate Queen Elizabeth of England.\n\nHennessy is a 1975 British thriller film directed by Don Sharp and starring Rod Steiger, Trevor Howard, Lee Remick, Richard Johnson, Peter Egan, Stanley Lebor and Patrick Stewart.\n\nPlot\n\nAfter the death of his family during a riot in Belfast, Niall Hennessy comes up with a plan to blow up the British Houses of Parliament.\n\nRelease\n\nThe British Board of Film Classification initially refused to classify the film because it contained footage of Queen Elizabeth II speaking at the State Opening of Parliament and apparently reacting to something happening in the House of Lords. Producer Samuel Z. Arkoff managed to get it passed by adding a disclaimer stating that the British Royal Family had not participated and footage of the Queen was from newsreel. The Rank Organisation then refused to screen the film in its Odeon Cinemas, citing commercial reasons. EMI also refused to distribute it. As a result it was only shown at a small number of independent cinemas.\n\n—————————————-\n\n26)\n\nHidden Agenda\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1990\n\nBased on an amalgam of real scandals, the film is a fictionalised account of official corruption in Northern Ireland (set in 1980).\n\nHidden Agenda (1990), directed by Ken Loach, is a political thriller about British state terrorism during the Northern Irish Troubles that depicts the fictional assassination of an American civil rights lawyer.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film opens with an Orange walk on The Twelfth, and a tape being handed to an American human rights activist, which becomes his death warrant. It begins with a quote from Margaret Thatcher insisting that Northern Ireland is part of Britain. It ends with one from a former British intelligence agent, stating, “There are two laws running this country: one for the security forces and the other for the rest of us.”\n\nInvestigator Peter Kerrigan (Cox), assisted by Ingrid Jessner (McDormand), investigates the killing of Paul Sullivan (Dourif), an American civil rights lawyer and political activist in Northern Ireland, whilst he was accompanied by a Provisional IRA sympathiser. The investigation reveals that the two men were shot without warning. A mysterious tape recording surfaces, made by a Captain Harris, an ex-army intelligence officer, now in hiding, of senior military leaders and Conservative Party politicians discussing how they arranged the rise to power of Margaret Thatcher. Eventually, Harris gives a copy of the tape to Jessner, but British security forces kill Harris, and blame his death on the IRA. Kerrigan is blackmailed into silence about the conspiracy. Jessner still has the tape, but without Harris to authenticate it, the recording can be dismissed as a forgery.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\n\nHidden Agenda was praised for its honesty and complexity, as well as its resonance. It was criticised for a simplistic view of the Northern Ireland Troubles as an anti-colonial war and for portraying the Troubles as an adjunct to British rather than Irish politics.\n\nAwards\n\nHidden Agenda won the Jury Prize at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for Best European Film at the Goya Awards. At the Festival press conference, the Northern Irish critic Alexander Walker publicly denounced the film as IRA propaganda.\n\n—————————————-\n\n27)\n\nHigh Boot Benny\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland\n\nYear of Production: 1993\n\nTells the story of a delinquent boy, Benny, who had to leave Northern Ireland and escapes across the border. He attends school in the Republic, and here finds the murdered body of the caretaker who had been a police informer. Benny is then later suspected of informing by the IRA.\n\nPlot\n\nAtmospheric and grittily brutal story of a Belfast teenager caught up in Loyalist-IRA revenge in a remote village just across the political border between Northern and Southern Ireland. Benny is a 17-year-old delinquent, distrustful of all sides of the Irish conflict, who takes refuge in a remote village school just across the border in Southern Ireland.\n\nThe school is run by the Matron, a Southern Protestant schoolmistress who’s trying to create a neutral haven for children, and who has sexual leanings towards Benny; she’s helped by Manley, an ex-Catholic priest who is also her lover and sympathiser. Events come to a climax when the school caretaker, a police informer, is found murdered. Benny is tarred and feathered by IRA men, and one night Loyalists and the British army cross over from Northern Ireland with Benny, the Matron and Manley in their sights. A bloody climax parallels Benny’s decision on a political allegiance and seals his rite of passage…\n\n—————————————-\n\n28)\n\nHostage\n\nAisling Walsh ( Director)\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1984\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the bombing campaign in Britain and the Northern Ireland Hunger Strike, a young woman joins a terrorist operation which takes three people hostage. Over the days of their captivity, she questions her own involvement and the history of Ireland which has brought her to this point.\n\n—————————————-\n\n29)\n\nHunger\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain / Ireland\n\nYear of Production: 2008\n\nThe film depicts the Hunger Strike in the Maze Prison in 1981 and in particular the role of the leader of the strike Bobby Sands.\n\nSands is played by Michael Fassbender who went on a medically-supervised diet to portray the final weeks of the 66 day hunger strike by Sands who died on 5 May 1981.\n\nThe film won the Camera d’Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008 for first-time film-makers.\n\nHunger is a 2008 British/Irish historical drama film directed by Steve McQueen and starring Michael Fassbender, Liam Cunningham, and Liam McMahon, about the 1981 Irish hunger strike. It was written by Enda Walsh and McQueen.\n\nIt premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival winning the prestigious Caméra d’Or award for first-time filmmakers. It went on to win the Sydney Film Prize at the Sydney Film Festival, the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics, best picture from the Evening Standard British Film Awards, and received two BAFTA nominations, winning one. The film was also nominated for eight awards at the 2009 IFTAs, winning six at the event.\n\nThe film stars Fassbender as Bobby Sands, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteer and MP who led the second IRA hunger strike and participated in the no wash protest (led by Brendan “The Dark” Hughes) in which Irish republican prisoners tried to regain political status after it had been revoked by the British government in 1976. It dramatises events in the Maze Prison in the period leading up to the hunger strike and its aftermath.\n\nPlot\n\nPrison officer Raymond Lohan prepares to leave work; he cleans his bloodied knuckles, checks his car for bombs, puts his uniform on, and ignores his comrades.\n\nDavey Gillen, a new IRA prisoner, arrives; he is categorised as a “non-conforming prisoner” for his refusal to wear the prison uniform. He is sent to his cell naked with only a blanket. His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry’s girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina.\n\nPrison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan’s face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands’ hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied.\n\nLater, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing. The guards are seen snickering as they are handed to the prisoners who respond, after Sands’ initial action, by tearing up the clothes and wrecking their cells. For the next interaction with the prisoners, a large number of riot police are seen coming into the prison on a truck. They line up and beat their batons against their shields and scream to scare the prisoners, who are hauled from their cells, then forced to run the gauntlet between the lines of riot police where they are beaten with the batons by at least 10 men at one time. Lohan and several of his colleagues then probe first their anuses and then their mouths, using the same pair of latex gloves for each man. One prisoner head-butts a guard and is beaten brutally by a riot officer. One of the riot officers is seen crying while his colleagues, on the other side of the wall, brutally beat the prisoners with their batons.\n\nLohan visits his catatonic mother in a retirement home. He is shot in the back of the head by an IRA assassin and dies slumped onto his mother’s lap.\n\nSands meets Father Dominic Moran and discusses the morality of a hunger strike. Sands tells the priest about a trip to Donegal where he and his friends found a foal by a stream that had cut itself on the rocks and broken its back legs. Sands drowned the foal and tells the priest, although he got into trouble, he knew he had done the right thing by ending its suffering. He then says he knows what he is doing and what it will do to him, but he says he will not stand by and do nothing. The rest of the film shows Sands well into his hunger strike, with weeping sores all over his body, kidney failure, low blood pressure, stomach ulcers, and the inability to stand on his own by the end. In the last days, while Sands lies in a bath, a larger orderly comes in to give his usual orderly a break.\n\nThe larger orderly sits next to the tub and shows Sands his knuckles, which are tattooed with the letters “UDA“. Sands tries to stand on his own and eventually does so with all his strength, staring defiantly at the UDA orderly who refuses to help him up, but then he crumbles in a heap on the floor with no strength left to stand. The orderly carries him to his room. Sands’ parents stay for the final days, his mother being at his side when Sands dies, 66 days after beginning the strike.\n\nThe film explains that Sands was elected to the United Kingdom Parliament as MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone while he was on strike. Nine other men died with him during the seven-month strike before it was called off. 16 prison officers were killed by paramilitaries throughout the protests depicted in the film. Shortly afterwards, the British government conceded in one form or another to virtually all of the prisoners’ five demands despite never officially granting political status.\n\nCritical Reception\n\nHunger received widespread critical acclaim by critics, audiences and at festivals all over the world. The film has a rating of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 115 reviews with an average score of 7.8 out of 10. The consensus states:\n\n“Unflinching, uncompromising, vivid and vital, Steve McQueen’s challenging debut is not for the faint hearted, but it’s still a richly rewarding retelling of troubled times.”\n\nMetacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 82 (out of 100) based on 25 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be “universal acclaim”. It is currently among the site’s highest-rated films.\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times spoke most positively of the piece stating, “Hunger is not about the rights and wrongs of the British in Northern Ireland, but about inhumane prison conditions, the steeled determination of IRA members like Bobby Sands, and a rock and a hard place.”\n\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone, regarded the film highly and said: “Shockingly immediate and philosophically reflective, Hunger is an indelibly moving tribute to what makes us human.” and praised “… McQueen’s way of showing the body itself as an arsenal, arguably the last weapon any of us have to fight back.”\n\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian scored the piece a maximum five stars, writing, “There is an avoidance of affect and a repudiation of the traditional liberal-lenient gestures of dialogue, dramatic consensus and narrative resolution. This is a powerful, provocative piece of work, which leaves a zero-degree burn on the retina.” while praising McQueen’s work, “Hunger shows that McQueen is a real film-maker and his background in art has meant a fierce concentration on image, an unflinching attention to what things looked like, moment by moment.”\n\n—————————————-\n\n30)\n\nIn the Name of the Father\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland / Britain / USA\n\nYear of Production: 1993\n\nThe film deals with the events surrounding the ‘Guildford Four’ and the Magure family. Gerry Conlon, an unemployed young Belfast man without apparent direction in life, finds his world turned upside down when he is falsely accused of the 1974 Guildford pub bombing. Immediately branded an IRA conspirator, Conlon is coerced into a confession, along with his father.\n\nIn the Name of the Father is a 1993 Irish-British-American biographical courtroom drama film co-written and directed by Jim Sheridan. It is based on the true life story of the Guildford Four, four people falsely convicted of the 1974 IRA‘s Guildford pub bombings, which killed four off-duty British soldiers and a civilian. The screenplay was adapted by Terry George and Jim Sheridan from the autobiography Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four by Gerry Conlon.\n\nThe film was positively received by critics, and received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor in a Leading Role (Daniel Day-Lewis), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Pete Postlethwaite), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Emma Thompson), Best Director, and Best Picture.\n\nPlot\n\nGerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is shown in Belfast stripping lead from roofs of houses when security forces home in on the district with armoured cars, and a riot breaks out. Gerry’s father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), later saves him from IRA punishment, and he is sent off to London to stay with his aunt, for his own good. Instead, he finds a squat, to explore, as he puts it, “free love and dope.” One evening by chance he gains entry to a prostitute’s flat and he steals the £700 he finds stashed inside; on that evening in Guildford there is an explosion at a pub that kills four off-duty soldiers and a civilian, and wounds sixty-five others.\n\nWhile Gerry has returned to Belfast to show off his stolen money, one of the squat residents talks to the authorities and the Conlon home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary, who arrest Gerry and immediately place him on a military flight to the mainland UK. Gerry and his friend, Paul Hill (John Lynch) are interrogated by police who torture and threaten them until both finally agree to sign a confession after being held for up to seven days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. When Gerry’s father travels from Belfast to England to help his son, he is arrested at the aunt’s home. In the subsequent trial, his aunt’s family (known as the Maguire Seven, including his father) are convicted of supporting the bombing on the basis of unsubstantiated nitroglycerin traces, and the four, including Gerry, are sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.\n\nGerry’s time in prison shows a progression from a bitter son who rails at his father to an awakening when he discovers the real perpetrator of the bombing in the same facility. When this man leads a prison protest and then sets a hated prison guard on fire, Gerry is the one who saves the man with a blanket. Gerry takes over the fight for justice himself when his father dies in custody. His case becomes public, gaining support from Dublin, Belfast and London. A common slogan used by his supporters is “Free The Four.”\n\nGareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), a campaigning lawyer who has been investigating the case on behalf of Giuseppe in the wake of public campaigns demanding the release of the accused, has a breakthrough when she tries to access Giuseppe’s file and is able to look instead at Gerry’s. She finds vital police documents in the file that are marked “Not to be shown to the Defence”. During the course of their appeal, the production of these documents leads to a triumphant scene in court when Peirce produces the evidence that the police officers have been lying all the way through, which leads to the exoneration and release of the Guildford Four.\n\nThe film ends with a triumphant Gerry revealing his story to the media and proclaiming his father’s innocence. Title cards reveal the current activities of the Four, the exoneration of the Maguire Seven, that the police were acquitted of any wrongdoing, and that the real perpetrators of the Guildford Bombing have not been charged with the crime.\n\nReception\n\nThe film received very positive reviews from most critics. The review aggregator websites Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic both scored the film very highly, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it 94% and a ‘certified fresh’ rating, while Metacritic has given it 84% and a ‘universal acclaim’ rating\n\n—————————————-\n\n31)\n\nMaeve\n\nCountry of Origin: Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1981\n\nPlot\n\nMaeve Sweeney, a young woman living in London returns home to visit her Catholic family in Belfast.

Making things even worse, one cadre is a bunch of dedicated Roman Catholics from Ireland, the other is a gathering of devoted Protestants. The evening’s entertainment only aggravates the tense situation, with a raucous punk ensemble being followed by a frazzled magician known as Rosco de Ville (Elvis Costello).\n\nPlot\n\nOn New Year’s Eve in Liverpool, Michael (Michael Angelis) becomes the new manager of the Charleston Club, a run-down function hall on an industrial wasteground which, he later discovers, is owned by an organised crime syndicate. He also discovers that the previous manager, MacArthur, in an attempt to spite the hall’s owners, has hired it out to two groups of senior citizens for New Year’s Eve; one group are hardline Irish Catholics and the other are hardline Irish Protestants, and the entertainment consists of a magician (Elvis Costello) with stage fright, a homosexual comedian (Pete Price) and his boyfriend, a talentless punk band, and a fancy dress competition with a non-existent prize.\n\nThe two parties arrive and are joined by another group of senior citizens who are mentally-handicapped and suffering from senile dementia. After discovering MacArthur being tortured in a back room by the hall’s owners, Michael, along with bouncer Bernard (Bernard Hill) and kitchen porter Cheryl (Joanne Whalley), attempts to keep things in order amid the threat of violence in the air. As the night goes on, however, things start to go wrong; the comedian’s routine is badly received, the magician has to pull out because of the death of his rabbit, and the band’s poor performance leads to the groups throwing missiles at the stage whilst the band members fight amongst themselves. Meanwhile, things begin to boil over when former Loyalist boxer Billy McRacken (Ray McAnally) strangles on-the-run terrorist Norman (Mark Mulholland) to death in a toilet cubicle after Norman makes comments about McRacken’s daughter “marrying out”, and an Orange Order marching band arrives playing sectarian tunes, leading to a mass brawl in the toilets and the discovery of Norman’s body. In an attempt to defuse the violence, Michael and Cheryl begin singing together on stage while Bernard phones the police, who arrive and defuse the situation.\n\nThe situation dies down by midnight, and the groups all go their separate ways peacefully. Michael and Cheryl share a kiss, before going back to Cheryl’s house together. The film ends with McRacken at home phoning his daughter and asking to speak to his son-in-law, before wishing him a happy New Year\n\n—————————————-\n\n34)\n\nNothing Personal\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland / Britain\n\nYear of Production: 1995\n\nA raw depiction of the Belfast ‘troubles’ as savage tribal warfare.

The story is loosely based on the real-life “Shankill Butchers“, an Ulster loyalist gang in 1970s Belfast who conducted random killings of Catholic civilians until their leader, Lenny Murphy, was assassinated by a Provisional IRA hit squad.\n\nProduction\n\nAlthough set in Belfast, Resurrection Man was not filmed there, with the English cities of Manchester, Liverpool and Warrington serving as the film’s locations.\n\nCritical reception and analysis\n\nIn an essay entitled “Vampire Troubles: Loyalism and Resurrection Man”, academic Steve Baker argues that the film can be interpreted as a vampire film, “situating it within a loyalist self image of vampirism”.\n\nIn fact, Stuart Townsend’s performance in this film was what prompted Michael Rymer to cast him the role of the Vampire Lestat in Queen of the Damned.\n\n—————————————-\n\n39)\n\nShadow Dancer\n\nCountry of Origin: UK\n\nYear of Production: 2012\n\nShadow Dancer is a 2012 British-Irish drama film directed by James Marsh and based on the novel of the same name by Tom Bradby who also wrote the film’s script.

However, the programme was not broadcast in Northern Ireland itself, a precaution that Ulster Television said reflected legal advice that it might prejudice future inquests on the deceased, which had been suspended.\n\nThe programme was made with the co-operation of John Thorburn, Stalker’s deputy with day-to-day responsibility on the inquiry, and was said to reveal significant new information about the underlying events and how the inquiry had progressed.\n\nShoot to Kill was widely applauded by critics. It won the 1990 award for Best Single Drama from both the Royal Television Society and the Broadcasting Press Guild, and a nomination in that category for a BAFTA Award. The score was written by Rachel Portman.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe first two-hour part dramatises the events in late 1982 that lay behind the inquiry: the killing of three policemen by a massive landmine at Kinnego embankment in County Armagh; the fatal shooting of three members of the IRA, who turned out to be unarmed, in a car at Craigavon; the shooting dead of civilian Michael Tighe and wounding of Martin McCauley, also found to be unarmed, at a hayshed in Ballyneery near Lurgan; and the killing of two INLA members, again discovered to be unarmed, in a car at Mullacreavie Park, near Armagh; along with the creation of adjusted or fabricated accounts of the actions of RUC Special Support Unit members in the events, some of which unravelled in court in March 1984.\n\nThe second part shows Stalker, his second-in-command Thorburn, and the inquiry team, as they dig out more and more of what really happened, faced with a complete lack of encouragement from the RUC, a clash of views as to what was acceptable, and ultimately Stalker’s removal from the inquiry before its conclusion.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe programme was well received. It was nominated for a BAFTA award in the Best Single Drama category, and won the 1990 award in that category from both the Royal Television Society and the Broadcasting Press Guild. The Sunday Times critic Patrick Stoddart described it as Kosminsky’s “first and massively impressive drama”.\n\nChris Dunkely of the Financial Times said it was “the sort of programme that makes me want to stand up and cheer”, calling it “admirable” and “remarkably even handed”, with “splendid performances… and very superior camerawork and editing. Given that Kosminsky has never made a drama before it is an astonishing achievement. But above all a heartening one”.\n\nIan Christie in the Daily Express called it remarkable and gripping, concluding that “the film was compelling, the script and direction incisive, the performances first rate”. The technical qualities of the film were widely applauded. Mark Sanderson in Time Out noted the challenges the film makers had faced − a vast amount of information to convey, a huge number of real people to present with hardly any time to develop characterisation, an outcome that everybody knew − and considered that writer Michael Eaton had succeeded “triumphantly”, using the tense and smoky style of a thriller to establish a nation under siege, “where the spools of the tape recorders never stop turning”.\n\nNancy Banks Smith in The Guardian compared the “sense of tension and throttling pressure” of the second part to that of a “Western by a great master… Will he get them before they get him? Even though you know he won’t, you feel he might.”\n\nCritics also applauded the dramatic space given to the two contending sides. Sheridan Morley in The Times described “Stalker and Sir John Hermon of the RUC, two giants superbly played by Jack Shepherd and T. P. McKenna. Both men are fighting for what they believe to be paramount: Stalker for the objective truth, Hermon for the honour of a police force in what he describes as a jungle”.\n\nAccording to Mark Sanderson in Time Out, “both sides are fairly represented”.Patrick Stoddart in the Sunday Times agreed: T. P. McKenna as Sir John Hermon had been “forceful”, and the film-makers had been “wise” to demonstrate that they “understood the stresses facing members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary” and to “set the investigation against that backdrop”. In the end, according to Stoddart, it was “the cock-ups and the cover-ups that really exercised the investigators”.\n\nThe Guardian‘s Hugo Young, writing a few months later, called the drama “a brilliant programme… seductively watchable, beautifully filmed, spaciously elaborate in its slow build-up of the characters and evidence on each side of the argument”.\n\nBut for Young, dramatic balance was not enough, and the skill of execution made the problem he saw even more acute. The drama was not just making an “observation on human affairs as these illuminated the human condition”, rather “it purported to be a faithful rendition of events, and the purpose of it was to conduct a forensic inquiry into the moral quality of those events.” “[A]ctors playing scripted parts: Sir John Hermon, the RUC chief, Stalker himself, were displayed as if wholly and completely real.” He worried that such techniques could be “capable of fatally blurring the line between what is true and what is televisually convenient”.\n\nOther critics too had niggling worries about the reality. For example, as Melinda Witstock noted later in The Times, when the film showed an MI5 chief promising to help Stalker, then reaching for a telephone and saying “We have a problem” once Stalker had gone, who could have been present to witness such a call or as Hugh Hebert asked in The Guardian, when the film showed a battery genuinely stolen to lure the uniformed RUC men to their deaths, but Stalker’s book said the call had been made by a farmer under duress, who is the viewer to believe. For the television dramatist G. F. Newman in Time Out the film did not show the truth − it was Thorburn’s truth; and Sheridan Morley cautioned that the film was a drama, not a documentary: “we have no absolute guarantee that it has given us the whole truth”.\n\nNevertheless, along with other critics, Morley appeared to accept the main thrust of the programme, considering that the “contemptuous lack of co-operation by the RUC is indeed terrifying” and the programme usefully illustrated “the contrast between acceptable police behaviour ‘on the mainland’, as Stalker puts it, and in Ireland, where other laws would seem to obtain.\n\n—————————————-\n\n41)\n\nSilent Grace\n\nCountry of Origin: Ireland\n\nYear of Production: 2001 (released 2004)\n\nGripping drama about friendship and survival set in 1980 Armagh.\n\nPlot\n\nWild child criminal, Aine (Cathleen Bradley), is put in the same prison cell as Eileen, a high-ranking Republican prisoner. Eileen helps save Aine’s sanity and in a dramatic turn of events, Aine helps save Eileen’s life.\n\nSilent Grace tells, through fictional drama, the story of women prisoners in Armagh Jail during the period of the republican Dirty Protest / Hunger Strike in 1980. The film was inspired by the largely unreported involvement of women in the protests in 1980.\n\nCritical Reception\n\nThe film was received with critical acclaim at its premiere before being released by Guerilla Films in cinemas in the UK and Ireland. It was Critics Choice in the London Metro and Dublin Hot Press. It was awarded the Soka Art Award and nominated for the Conflict and Resolution Award at the Hamptons Film Fest"
