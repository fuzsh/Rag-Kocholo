        "text": "Set to air on BBC Two, BBC Northern Ireland and BBC iPlayer on Monday 22 May, Once Upon A Time In Northern Ireland gives voice to the people who lived through the Troubles, sharing intimate stories from all sides of the conflict.\n\nThe powerful new five-part documentary combines unfiltered personal accounts with archive footage to tell the story of the people and communities who had to live with violence daily - and are still dealing with its legacies today.\n\nAT2\n\nMeet Series Director James Bluemel\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Iraq was a huge success when it aired in 2020. Why did you choose Northern Ireland for your next project?\n\nThe civil war was a particularly cruel time in Iraq. Hearing stories from Iraqis of how their friendships, families and neighbourhoods were ripped apart by sectarian killings made me think about a sectarian conflict which was much nearer to home.\n\nNorthern Ireland was always on the news when I was young - bombs, violence, murder and pain seemed to be ever present there. As an adult, I might have understood the broad politics behind the events, but after my conversations with Iraqis, I realised I had no idea how anyone in Northern Ireland really felt about what it was like living through that turbulent history. I had been exposed to the politics of the conflict, but I had not heard the human stories from those that were there.\n\nJust after lockdown restrictions had lifted, I found myself in Belfast, meeting the first contributors that would feature in a new documentary, Once Upon A Time In Northern Ireland.\n\nDid you have any concerns about asking people to conjure their memories of The Troubles?\n\nI was concerned that I would be asking people to remember things that may have become cemented in their minds. For some, the events we would be talking about were over 50 years ago, and over time, memories can become staged in their retelling. I neednât have worried.\n\nOne of the first interviews we did was with Kate Nash, whose brother, Willie Nash was one of people shot dead by the paratroopers on 30th January 1972 â on Bloody Sunday.\n\nAs we talked at length about her life growing up, I felt that memories that had been neglected began to resurface. By the time we arrived at that fateful day in 1972, Kate spoke eloquently, with genuine emotion and anger as she recalled what happened and how she felt. Any concern I had about these recollections feeling rehearsed vanished as Kate sat in front of me, processing her feelings, and conjuring up buried emotions.\n\nThe Troubles is a subject that has been well documented. Why is this series different?\n\nEveryone we spoke to has first-hand accounts of the events they recall, and some expressed to us that now, with the passing of time, they are able to speak more openly and freely than before. While history is made up of big stories, it is understood best when we can hear the small, personal details.\n\nMichael McConville remembering the day his mother, Jean, was taken away and murdered by the IRA felt like an important historical story to include in the series. The IRA denied murdering her for over 30 years and they only revealed the whereabouts of her body in 2006. The trauma of this event on Michael is evident, not just in the way he talks but also the way he holds himself, his body displays the pain he feels. The trauma of those years can be consuming and was present in nearly everyone I interviewed.\n\nLater however, when Michaelâs 26-year-old daughter Bronagh, sat in the chair to talk about how that event, that happened over 50 years ago, has impacted her life, I discovered something that I hadnât understood before. Through Bronagh, Jean McConville stopped being a woman confined to the past, only seen staring out of the one grainy black and white photograph that exists of her. Through her granddaughter, Jean transcended out of the confines of an historical account into the here and now, as the past collided with the present. It was a profound and powerful moment for me to see her through Bronaghâs eyes.\n\nWhy do you think people felt that they could open up to you now, in some cases after many years?\n\nI suppose youâll have to ask them. Perhaps itâs the staging of the interview that is conducive to this deep dive into memory; the room is dark, the lights are unobtrusive, there is an informal quality to the interview space with little distinction made between where the interview begins and ends. Time in this room runs differently to the world outside, and contributors have the space to journey back into the past at their own rate. These interviews evoke the confessional and revelatory.\n\nDid you meet any resistance?\n\nI found that most of the people I was meeting were cautious, and sometimes overtly suspicious, about the idea of another documentary about Northern Ireland. Once we passed this initial sussing out phase, I discovered many people I met wanted to talk and wanted to go on record.\n\nThis doesnât mean it was easy for them. For some, opening up those boxes in which painful, traumatic or shameful memories have been locked, is always done with thought, care and caution. Raking up the past, especial a past as difficult as this, is not done flippantly.\n\nWhat would you like viewers to take away from this series?\n\nThere is a reason our contributors decided to share their stories. It is because they feel they have something to say, some wisdom to pass on, an emotional knowledge which perhaps has been neglected in the pursuit to define what happened here. While interviewing for this series, I did not feel like I was hearing another well-worn rendition of âThe Troublesâ. I was hearing a spectrum of human emotions, contradictory and confusing but also real and searching. This was very different to how I think most of us outside of Northern Ireland have heard or understood this conflict before.\n\nThe people that I interviewed for this series wanted to talk about their lives this way, they wanted this history to be told and they want to be heard. And I think itâs our job to listen.\n\nMeet the people featured\n\nEpisode 1\n\nBilly is a teenager living in a working class, Catholic area of Londonderry when episode one starts. He joins the civil rights protests and eventually the IRA. In January 1972 he is caught up in the horror of Bloody Sunday.\n\nJeanette grows up in a working class, Protestant area of Londonderry. Sheâs terrified by the outbreak of violence sparked by the civil rights marches.\n\nJames is also from a working class, Protestant background. He hears politicians and church leaders warning that the civil rights movement is nothing more than a front for the IRA. Fearful that his community is under attack, he joins a loyalist paramilitary organisation and by the age of 17 is in charge of their guns.\n\nRicky is born into a Belfast republican family. He recounts the building of tension caused by the British Armyâs deployment and the fallout after Bloody Sunday. He joins the IRA and is jailed for armed robbery, later playing a pivotal role in the 1981 hunger strike.\n\nRichard remembers the rioting and street battles with the British Army from the perspective of a schoolboy in Catholic Derry.\n\nFiona is a young child when the British Army arrives in Derry. She recalls how the soldiers are initially welcomed but are soon viewed as an oppressive force. She recalls that her republican family are regularly subjected to terrifying house searches by soldiers looking for hidden IRA weapons.\n\nKate is a carefree teenager from a large Catholic family when Bloody Sunday decimates her life. Her brother is shot dead and her father is wounded by British Paratroopers. She has campaigned for justice for the last 50 years.\n\nTom is deployed to Northern Ireland as part of the British Army. Heâs 19 years old and having grown up in a working class, English town he sees huge similarities between his home and the areas his regiment are patrolling. As the violence worsens he is injured and sees colleagues killed.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nDawn remembers the devastating impact of Bloody Friday (when the IRA set off bombs across Belfast city centre) on her Protestant, working class community.\n\nTerri is a legendary Belfast figure who sets up a record shop at height of the Troubles in the 1970s. He is at the heart of the punk music scene which brings young Catholics and Protestants together in defiance of the conflict around them.\n\nGreg grows up in a middle class Protestant suburb of Belfast. He becomes the lead singer of the Outcasts, a Belfast punk band.\n\nYvonne is a young Catholic girl who starts going to the Harp Bar where the Belfast punk scene played out. Itâs there that she meets and falls in love with her future husband, Greg.\n\nBronagh is the granddaughter of Jean McConville, a widowed mother of 10 who was kidnapped, murdered and secretly buried by the IRA as one of âthe Disappearedâ.\n\nMichael is the son of Jean McConville and Bronaghâs father. He remembers his mother being forcibly taken from the family home and how he and his siblings had to fend for themselves. He had to wait 30 years for the IRA to reveal where his mother was buried.\n\nJohn grows up on a working class, Protestant, loyalist estate believing all Catholics to be his enemy. He later discovers a family secret that causes him to re think his beliefs.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nBernadette (1) is 18, has just married her boyfriend Ricky and is about to have their first child. They live in Catholic, West Belfast; she has no interest in the politics around her but just wants a quiet life for her family. However she discovers her new husband has lied to her when heâs arrested and jailed for armed robbery. He had told her heâd left the IRA, now Bernadette finds herself an IRA prisonerâs wife â something she vowed sheâd never be.\n\nBernadette (2) is just 10 years old when sheâs told that her father Joe, an IRA prisoner, is going to be the next man to go on hunger strike. She travels to the United States as part of a scheme to give children from Northern Ireland some respite from the conflict. While there, she appears on US TV appealing to President Regan to intervene to save her fatherâs life.\n\nJune grows up in a predominantly Protestant village in rural Northern Ireland. She marries her teenage sweetheart Johnnie and they start a family together but his decision to join the police force (RUC) has devastating consequences.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nDenise, her mother and brother live on an âinterfaceâ (where Catholic/Protestant communities intersect resulting in rioting and violence) in constant fear of attack by their Catholic neighbours. Denise is terrified of the consequences if her family secret is revealed.\n\nJean is Deniseâs mother. She joins the Ulster Defence Regiment, part of the British Army.\n\nBilly (2) grows up in a Catholic working class community in South Belfast. His father is murdered when loyalist gunmen storm into a betting shop and shoot indiscriminately. Billy believes there was collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the British State and has spent 30 years fighting for the truth about what happened to his father.\n\nAnne Marie is not your typical â80âs teenager. She has posters of IRA hunger strikers on her wall and is passionate about the republican cause. After witnessing a loyalist attack on an IRA funeral, she agrees to plant firebombs in Belfast shops for the IRA. When her ex-partner turns informer on her she is sent to jail as a result of the detail he gives to the police.\n\n'Brian' is an ex Special Branch (police) officer who worked at a high level with informers and agents for decades. He believes his life is still at risk from paramilitaries seeking revenge, so is filmed anonymously.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nAlan is widowed after his young wife is killed by the IRA. On a busy Saturday afternoon a bomb blows up her fatherâs fish shop where sheâs working on the Protestant Shankill road. The bombers were targeting the loyalist paramilitary UDA headquarters upstairs. Alan is left to raise their young daughter alone. His journey through grief and acceptance mirrors Northern Irelandâs road to peace.\n\nPatrick is one of Northern Irelandâs most successful comedians. He makes his reputation as an 18 year old student in Belfast joking about the absurdity of politics in Northern Ireland. But comedy was actually an outlet for his grief; his father had been shot dead by loyalists paramilitaries a year earlier.\n\nWhy did you decide to share your story with James and the team behind Once Upon A Time In Northern Ireland?\n\nDenise\n\nâOnce weâd made the decision to take part I was really agitated and worried, worried that it was too soon to talk, that I might be putting the family in danger. The anticipation of it was awful! But the team were really gentle and I found it easy to talk. Just being able to sit there and have someone to listen to me was so good. I was mentally exhausted by the interview and left wondering if I had done the right thing. But the way James talked to me made me think it was important, my story is important and I did do a good job. Itâs opened it up a family conversation that weâve never been able to have. It can only be a good thing!â\n\nJohn\n\nâAs a child of the Troubles my whole life has been shaped and influenced by the brutal environment I grew up in and I feel itâs important to tell the story of an ordinary Belfast child trying to survive and thrive against the backdrop of a vicious sectarian conflict. I hope viewers come away from the programme with a better understanding and some empathy for the ordinary people of Northern Ireland and the trauma we all suffered during 30 blood soaked years of civil unrest or conflict.â\n\nGreg\n\nâWhen I was first contacted by James we spoke briefly on the phone and he sent me a link to his previous work. I couldnât believe it - I was already a fan having watched âOnce Upon a Time in Iraqâ numerous times and loved his style of documentary. Now having worked with him I realise just how good he is at letting you open up and get to the truth sometimes more than I thought I would say on camera but with the knowledge that a skilled filmmaker will know how to use it!!!â\n\nRicky\n\nâI do think itâs important to the people who were involved, who made decisions - whatever the decisions were - to tell their story. I think history is important, I think people who were involved in historical events have a duty to speak out and recall accurately what they remember doing. I have no problem doing this, I would do this again if I was asked, but itâs important that history is properly recorded. The problem with history; and not just in Ireland; all histories are usually sanitised one way or another because the teller wants their history to be told and they want their history to be told so that the other guys history will be diminished and, basically, I say let it all be told. Let everybody have their say and let future historians or whatever make up their minds.\n\nâWhere the truth lies thatâs my worldly view itâs important to get out there - if you were involved in a historical event or if you have something significant to say, say it, for godâs sake say it, donât take it to the grave with you.â\n\nJune\n\nâAfter 40 years I felt that people really needed to know how the Troubles had left scars on the families and the after affects. The stories needed to be told and not let them be forgotten .Too many lives and families have never got justice.â\n\nFiona\n\nâI took part in the series as I find it important that the real experiences and voices be heard. To give the statistics the humanity they are and deserve. I am so glad I took part. I feel itâs a balanced and unbiased approach. I have full trust in James Bluemel and his team.â\n\nBernadette (2)\n\nâI wanted to take part in this series as I believe it is very important to let the world know that Joe McDonnell was not only a hunger striker but he was also a daddy, a husband, a son, a brother and he left a grieving family behind. I also believe what he and the other nine men went through is now a huge part in Irish History and their story needs to be told and remembered with pride. In taking part in the series it has brought back many memories â some happy and some sad but I am glad I decided to take part.\n\nâBrianâ\n\nâI take this opportunity to take part in this programme as an attempt to educate the population in general that, although the system wasnât perfect, Intelligence gathering was a necessary part in allowing us to enjoy the relative peace we have today. Intelligence gathering officers and, in particular, Special Branch through their relentless pursuit of product - assisted by those who risked their lives to provide such product - played a part where no adulation can be expressed.â\n\nJames Bluemel, Series Director\n\nJames Bluemel is a multi-award-winning documentary director who tackles large geo-political subjects in an emotionally gripping and human way.
