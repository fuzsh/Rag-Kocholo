        "text": "` Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in Dancing at Lughnasa ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze.\n\nAmong the five unmarried sisters who are the subject of Brian Friel's play (and who are named for his own mother and aunts), it is Kate who wears her unmarried status least comfortably. And it is Kate who radiates the most wistful, turbulent emotions while watching younger, prettier Christina (Catherine McCormack) dance with a lover.\n\n\"Her whole face alters when she's happy,\" Kate whispers about Christina in astonishment, speaking almost to herself. It is as if this furiously upright schoolteacher, the sister who has taken it upon herself to champion rectitude in the small Irish village where Mr. Friel's play unfolds, had discovered the sweetness of Christina's flirtatious exuberance and the chill of her own loneliness as if for the very first time.\n\nSet in Donegal in 1936 and made poignant by the hindsight of narration, Dancing at Lughnasa preserves the author's memories of a world about to change irrevocably, filled with hints of foreboding that made it so powerful an experience on stage. On film, as directed handsomely by Pat O'Connor, it makes for a soaringly scenic film, yet a slightly more diffuse, less haunted drama.\n\nThe play, an actors' heyday, is rich with memories of the sisters and their camaraderie, especially when their fragile fellowship is shaken by the arrivals of two men. While the film begins with a rich evocation of the sisters' rustic chores and rituals in the beautiful, isolated setting they call home, it's clear that these men can change everything. One is Father Jack (Michael Gambon), once the family's bright-eyed brother and now a broken old man, returning from missionary work in Africa and filled with visions of a world his sisters have never seen.\n\nWhile Mr. Gambon's gently eccentric Jack presides over the story with a mysterious intensity, the other male visitor is more mundane. Gerry Evans (Rhys Ifans) is Christina's handsome, conventionally romantic beau (and the father of Michael, the young man who nostalgically narrates the story). The arrival of Gerry prompts the film into the very sorts of picturesque rhapsodies that give this opened-up drama its postcard appeal while removing the seriousness and sting from events that transpire. - New York Times [Janet Maslin]\n\nScreening of Brendan Byrne's documentary on Gerry Conlon.\n\n\"One of the most affecting documentaries made in this country in recent years.\"\n\nByrne extended his documentary approach to the study of one man's personal struggle with sanity in How Far Home, about Gerry Conlon, convicted of the 1974 Guildford Pub Bombings, but proved innocent and released after twenty years of imprisonment. In this film the freed and exonerated Conlon was the subject of a sustained psychological examination, which revealed an exhausted man ill equipped to deal with everyday life having been first a prisoner, then a symbol of injustice and political beliefs he felt he did not hold.\n\nHe described In the Name of the Father as a millstone around his neck, and Byrne neatly managed to suggest that the human cost of recent history has not been measured enough in terms of its effects on the living.\n\nThe General is an Irish crime film directed by John Boorman about Dublin crime boss Martin Cahill (more on Wiki ), who pulled off several daring heists in the early 1980s, and attracted the attention of the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, IRA, and Ulster Volunteer Force. The film was shot in 1997 and released in 1998. Brendan Gleeson plays Cahill, Adrian Dunbar plays his friend Noel Curley, and Jon Voight plays Inspector Ned Kenny.\n\nAmong the five unmarried sisters who are the subject of Brian Friel's play (and who are named for his own mother and aunts), it is Kate who wears her unmarried status least comfortably. And it is Kate who radiates the most wistful, turbulent emotions while watching younger, prettier Christina (Catherine McCormack) dance with a lover.\n\nAfter selling stolen paintings to the UVF, Cahill realizes he has made a dangerous mistake. When the PIRA hear of this, they order his assassination, which is carried out on 18 August 1994.\n\nThe film is based on the book of the same name by Irish journalist Paul Williams, who is crime editor of Ireland's best-selling tabloid, The Sun.\n\nDirector Boorman was himself one of Cahill's burglary victims. This event is dramatized in a scene in which Cahill breaks into a home, stealing a gold record and pilfering a watch from the wrist of a sleeping woman. The gold record, which Cahill later breaks in disgust after discovering it is not made of gold, was awarded for the score of Deliverance, Boorman's best-known film.\n\nFilming was at various locations around Dublin, including South Lotts and Ranelagh.\n\nThe General was nominated for, and won, several awards, including Best Director at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival and the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.\n\nAll the performances are impressive, but Gleeson and Voight are especially memorable, lending an almost tragic air of inexorability to Cahill and Kenny's cat-and-mouse games. - Time Out [Geoff Andrew]\n\nFor director Paul Quinn, this is a fine effort, and represents the kind of motion picture that lovers of well-constructed romances long for. - ReelViews.net [James Berardinelli]\n\nThis Is My Father chronicles the journey of a disillusioned Chicago schoolteacher who returns to Ireland with his nephew in search of the man who was his father. Widowed and childless, the lonely Kieran Johnson is no longer able to relate to his students. His fragile mental state is mirrored by his family circumstances: his mother has had a stroke and is unable (or unwilling) to communicate and his divorced sister, Betty, is burdened with their mother's care while trying to raise her troubled teenage son Jack.\n\nThe film portrays a tragic love story set in late 1930s Ireland, focusing on the relationship between Fiona Flynn (Moya Farrelly), a beautiful, feisty seventeen-year-old from a middle-class family, and Kieran O'Dea (Aidan Quinn), a shy labourer in his early thirties, and the search decades later by their son, Kieran Johnson, (James Caan) to find his roots in late 1990s Ireland.\n\nThe film is told as an interweaving of the nineties setting, where Kieran is hearing the story of his parents, and the events of the 1930s. Kieran Johnson grew into adulthood unaware of his parents' story or of the tragic events that caused his mother to leave Ireland on her own while pregnant."
