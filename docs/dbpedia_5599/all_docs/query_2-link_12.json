(Advice, let her be the only one to watch those shows)\n\nI, myself, will preview, as the fansubs come out, Allison to Lillia, Amatsuki, Blassreiter, Crystal Blaze, Druaga no To: the Aegis of Uruk, Himitsu: The Revelation, Itazura na Kiss, Kamen no Maid Guy, Monochrome Factor, Nabari no Ou, Real Drive, Soul Eater, Special A, Vampire Knight, Wagaya no Oinari-sama and Catman. EDIT: The list is completer (is that a word? Second time btw) now, thus I can see which anime I have forgotten to copy from my try list. Yeah, I'm lazy and didn't use that. Anyways, I will also attempt to watch Golgo 13, Kaiba and Nijuu-Mensou no Musume.\n\nSome of those series have already aired their first episode. So here are the first few:\n\nBlassreiter - I have no idea how to describe this, SciFi, androids, motorcycles, crazy stuff. A lot of CG animation, those parts are actually nice to watch (I personally dislike too much or too bad CG in anime alongside cellshaded animation). There were, in my opinion a few too over dramatic moments in the first episode, but this probably due to the characters not yet being fleshed out (what do you want from a first episode?) and me not yet caring for them. And some decent action scenes.\n\nThe rough plot outline of the first episode: Eh (how the fuck am I going to do this), The anime takes places in Germany, and revolves around Germany's greatest motor racer. He becomes paralyzed from the waist down after an android attacks the race circuit during a race. He of course wants to keep working with the team but gets fired, for what does a motor racing team have to do for an invalid? This eventually leads to him obtaining an experimental drug.\n\nThe other half of the story follows his friend (sorry, I suck at names and already forgot the names in this anime), a riot police officer (iirc) with a motorcycle. I have no idea what \"Blass\" means, but we all know by now for sure what \"Reiter\" means. This friend and his colleagues hunt down the android that attack the race circuit and try to destroy it. Near the end of the episode they catch it, but fail to destroy it. However, a different android, on a huge purple motor cycle comes to the aid of these cops and destroys this android once and for all.\n\nDruaga no To: the Aegis of Uruk - My computer failed at playing the fansub. However, this is one of the anime that is being released by Gonzo zero-day on Youtube and Crunchy Roll (just like Blassreiter), thus after having watched the first 30 seconds before the actual opener, with HUGE framedrops consisting of seconds worth of frames, I decided to watch it on Youtube. Sure, the quality there is horrible, but the subs are readable, and I had already found out from the little bit I saw that this was going to be an awesome anime. AniDB has \"Parody\" as one of its categories! And it certainly is awesome. Now, I have never played D&D, but I feel pretty certain in saying that this anime to some extent also has D&D in its list of things to parody. It is really fun, I laughed a ton and will not spoil a single bit. GO WATCH!\n\nItazura na Kiss - Shoujo anime.\n\nIn the romantic comedy story, a high school girl named Kotoko finally tells a fellow senior named Naoki that she has loved him from afar since she saw him on their first day of high school. However, Naoki, a haughty \"super-ikemen\" (handsome male) with smarts and sports talent, rejects her offhand. Fate intervenes when a mild earthquake ruins Kotoko's family house. While the house gets rebuilt, Kotoko and her dad stay at the home of her dad's childhood friend...whose son is Naoki.\n\nSo it follows a girl and a guy in high school, not much to tell from that, except for the word 'comedy', worth a try, no? The first episode was indeed funny at times, not as great as Druaga, but because I watched this before Druaga I still enjoyed it a bit. The first episode basically just introduces the characters of the anime and ends with the main characters living in the same house. I personally like the style used at comedy moments, and already like Kin-chan. One of the male friends of Kotoko. No, I have no idea what his name is besides that, he's funny. Not much to say, don't know if I'll try episode two.\n\nVampire Knight - Another shoujo anime in the list. The setting is just present day Japan at a special boarding school somewhere in the woods, we don't see anything besides the school. At this school two classes attend, the Day Class, consisting of humans, and the Night Class, consisting of, yeah you've probably guessed it correctly by now, vampires. The story follows a female human student who has been adopted by the Chairman of the school. She along with a male student from the Day Class have the task of keeping the Day Class from finding out the truth behind the Night Class, that they're vampires. Of course, both of these 'guardians' have some shady past concerning vampires, and for the most part, nothing unexpected happens in the first episode. It has some funny parts and I think I'll try to watch episode 2. Note, DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER! It is horrible. The images used for the three main characters are the same, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Almost kept me from watching the episode.\n\nI've seen the previews of Soul Eater and Special A. Don't have much to say besides that I think Soul Eater will be more enjoyable than Special A. But we'll see after the first episodes of those anime are subbed.\n\nNote, I'm looking forward to Crystal Blaze, Real Drive and Catman from images and plot synopsizes alone. This was Nine being a baka, have fun.\n\nor is that an baka..."
