        "text": "6 Anime Like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie In April) [Recommendations]\n\n[ad_top1 class=\"mb40\"]\n\nShigatsu wa Kimi no Uso was hands down, one of the brightest anime of its season! The animation was spectacular while the musical compositions were masterfully done. Coming in as a musical romance drama with extremely bright, colorful animation, you would almost be fooled to think it’s smiles all around, but this series will definitely leave you with butterflies in your stomach after each and every episode. Arima Kousei meets a blonde haired girl named Kaori Miyazono and is instantly entranced. He’s a prodigy, he suffered a great trauma and can no longer bring himself to play the piano. But, after meeting Kaori, things started to change. She’s innovation while he’s perfection. Namely, she’s the spring to his winter. While this series is beautifully mastered and hard to compete, there are series that deliver certain feelings with a musically inclined theme.\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\nSimilar Anime to Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso / Similar Anime to Your Lie in April\n\n1. Nodame Cantabile\n\n[Information episodes=\" 23 \" aired=\" January 2007-June 2007 \"]\n\nIf anything is like Shigatsu, hands down it’s Nodame Cantabile. The maturity and the passion alone parallels well and the sweet romance is the icing on the cake. It’s as appearingly light and fluffy as Shigatsu with every deep moment as it has as well. One huge similarity is Chiaki and Kousei, both perfectionist players who meet a girl who sweeps them off their feet. We watch as the two find their way in the world of music. Nodame Cantabile is a musical classic and one every fan of music anime should watch.\n\nNodame Cantabile OP\n\n2. Full Moon wo Sagashite (Searching for the Full Moon)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 52 \" aired=\" April 2002 - March 2003 \"]\n\nComing in with 52 episodes is none other than Full Moon, which was a big hit and for a lot people, what came after Sailor Moon when you found out as kids that it was from Japan! Arina Tanemura, the original manga artist, has spawned many successes. This is a story about a young girl with beautiful voice, silenced by a malignant tumor. Enter in two shinigami who tell her she has a year to live but she plans to make the most of it. I think Full Moon really captures the essence of Shigatsu because of the underlying deep drama dealing with the main blonde girl, despite that, they remain cheerful through it all. Both are passionate about music and use it to reach people’s hearts.\n\nFull Moon wo Sagashite (Searching for the Full Moon) OP\n\n3. Kinniro no Corda: Primo Passo (La Corda d’Oro: Primo Passo)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 25 \" aired=\" October 2006 - March 2007 \"]\n\nHino Kahoko, after encountering a music fairy, is the only normal student to enter into the Music Branch’s music competition and, with no prior knowledge, starts playing the a magical violin that only plays if she truly believes in herself and the music. Despite the magic elements in this series, like Shigatsu it is very slice of life. There’s relationships, romance, friendships and musical competitions galore. With music competitions comes the drama and fear along with it. Will I win? Or will I play my music to my hearts content and not let fear of losing control me?\n\nKiniro no Corda: Primo Passo (La Corda d’Oro: Primo Passo) OP\n\n[ad_middle]\n\nAny Animes Like Your Lie in April / Any Animes Like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso ?\n\n4. Hibike! Euphonium (Sound! Euphonium)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\"April 2015 - July 2015 \"]\n\nHibike may be the closest to rivaling the wonderful animation of Shigatsu and adorable characters. The premise is about Kumiko who doesn’t want anything to do with the brass band but somehow gets pulled in anyway and runs into a girl she accidently insulted in junior high. Hibike shares numerous themes with Shigatsu, including drama/romance/comedy but also ties in music hand in hand with relationships and life. KyoAni’s animation work did it justice as well, from the fingering of the instruments to the characterized, realistic expressions. Both series really pull you into the setting and make you believe these characters are real.\n\nHibike! Euphonium (Sound! Euphonium) Official Trailer\n\n5. White Album\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\" January 2009 - March 2009 \"]\n\nFujii Touya is living the dream, dating a oncoming idol named Morikawa Yuki. Of course, there’s many challenges in the idol world, causing plenty of drama at school and work. The best part of this series is the realistic, flawed characters who go about life making decisions that, well, a lot of us might make because we are all only human after all. The intensity in this series is so very similar to Shigatsu, where it may be lacking in colorful joy, it makes up for with a fairly engaging storyline. I think it’s also similar because both series probes similar questions; “what would you do in this situation?”\n\nWhite Album \"Memories\" amv\n\n6. Piano\n\n[Information episodes=\" 10 \" aired=\" November 2002 - January 2003 \"]\n\nPiano is a touching slice of life that might also be just too close to real life. Dealing with the realities of teenage life and piano playing, it’s relatively slower in pace just like Shigatsu. If you like classical music, you’ll find it in here as well. When Miu was young, she was entranced by the piano and started taking up lessons. Eventually she gets good but is so soft spoken and unconfident, she can’t put her heart into her music. She falls for a boy too, and like Kousei in Shigatsu, it has it’s slower pace.\n\nPiano OP\n\nI promise, above all else, if you marathon these series you will probably be motivated to do what you love as well. The beauty of the music theme tends to be the sheer passion the characters have for their craft. In all these series, regardless of art style, plot, etc., you will see all the pure devotion everyone gives to music; it consumes them, and us. Is there any series you wish was on here? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n[author author_id=\"016\" author=\"\"] [ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n6 Anime Like NANA [Recommendations]\n\n[ad_top1 class=\"mb40\"]\n\nNANA revolves around the lives of two girls who share the same first name: Nana. Komatsu Nana is an eccentric girl who has this nasty habit of falling in love with every cool guy she sees. On her way to Tokyo, she meets the punk rock vocalist Osaki Nana and in a bizarre twist of fate, these two girls ended up living together and not only they share the same name and apartment, they're both looking for a meaning of their lives.\n\nOne can easily classify NANA as Slice of Life, like, you know, shows about a normal-looking guy getting all the girls for some reason, or girls going about their club activities at school while not doing actual club work at all – I'm looking at you, K-ON! — Wait, I love K-ON!, so please put down those pitchforks! *ahem* NANA is one of the best examples of mature Slice of Life stories that don’t rely on the typical high school romantic harem comedy show with panty shots every 5 seconds formula and doesn’t spend half of the episode discussing how to eat food (that’s a thing).\n\nNANA is all about the relatable characters (oddly enough, 90% of them are heavy smokers), how they deal with their love lives, and/or how they struggle as flawed human beings. With these themes in mind, here are six similar Slice of Life anime with just as mature stories to tell.\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\nSimilar Anime to NANA\n\n1. Kimi ga Nozomu Eien (Rumbling Hearts)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 14 \" aired=\" October 2003 - January 2004 \"]\n\nAdapted from a visual novel, Kimi ga Nozomu Eien (KimiNozo for short) tells the story of four best friends: Narumi Takayuki, Hayase Mitsuki, Suzumiya Haruka, and Taira Shinji. Friendship grew to love however and after a shocking incident that befell the group, their lives changed throughout the years. KimiNozo is a story of love, friendship, betrayal and shows how love can easily sway one's heart.\n\nRight off the bat, the first thing that makes KimiNozo similar to NANA is the rather complicated relationships of the characters. Komatsu Nana has a few guys in her life — the married man, the college sweetheart, and the rockstar. Was the college sweetheart cheating on her or was it just a misunderstanding and her blowing things out of proportion? Will she continue rejecting him and move on with the other guy she met?\n\nThese are tough decisions for one girl to make. Same goes with the characters of KimiNozo — Will Takayuki continue loving Mitsuki after years of being together or will he abandon her because he made a promise to Haruka back when they were young? Will Mitsuki give up because Haruka is her best friend or fight in the name of love? Ugh, that last line was cheesy…\n\nKimi ga Nozomu Eien - Opening Theme\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSsEM3dck4g&w=560&h=315]\n\n2. NHK ni Youkoso! (Welcome to the NHK)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 24 \" aired=\" July 2006 - December 2006 \"]\n\nAfter dropping out of college, 22-year-old Tatsuhiro Satou is living his life as a shut-in. He is lazy, rarely leaves his room, sleeps 16 hours a day and spends the rest of the day getting annoyed by his loud neighbor. He didn’t ask for this lifestyle and then discovers that a mysterious group called the NHK is the reason why he became a hikikimori.\n\nBut then one day, he met a young girl named Nakahara Misaki and his life starts changing for the better... or does it? Is this young girl his saving grace or is she a secret agent of the NHK out to keep his life a living hell? Welcome to the NHK.\n\nWelcome to the NHK doesn’t focus on romance like NANA or KimiNozo, but it does share the portrayal of relatable human interaction and how fragile it is. Satou is a good example of a real shut-in living his life in seclusion. His life is miserable and he is in no way a superhero nor does he have magical powers like you see in anime.\n\nHe’s just a normal guy who had lost his way and blames an organization he didn’t even know existed for his shortcomings. He will not meet a love interest with magical powers nor does he have friends to cheer him up. The people he meets are the same as him — sociopaths struggling with their lives.\n\nDepressing list, don’t you think? Not to worry, the next one will bring a smile to your face!\n\nNHK ni Youkoso! - Opening Theme\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDinGYteoJ0&w=560&h=315]\n\n3. Kimi ni Todoke (From Me to You, Reaching You)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 25 \" aired=\" October 2009 - March 2010 \"]\n\nKimi ni Todoke is a shoujo anime with a similar art style as NANA (piercing eyes, guys with shoulders wider than a chalkboard, etc.). That’s it. Now on to the fourth anim—Right, right.\n\nKimi ni Todoke tells the story of Sawako Kuronuma who longs to make new friends in high school. But because of her resemblance to the ghost from the “The Ring”, and because people often mistake her timid demeanor for maliciousness, she has earned the nickname “Sadako.”\n\nEnter Kazehaya Shouta, the kind and popular guy in class. He is Sadako’s inspiration to try harder to make friends. Sawako’s school life slowly changes as she and Shouta become friends and like every romance story out there, love starts from that friendship.\n\nThe story is lighthearted, very funny, yet heart-warming. The character development and the relationships are the anime’s strongest point. Yeah, the character development is sorta less complex and often predictable, but the characters are so colorful and very relatable. Especially Ume-chan. I can relate to her in many ways and I like her so much I often cheered for her, the “bad guy,” more than Sawako. Don’t misunderstand me, Sawako is a great female lead, but I just can’t ignore Kurumizawa Ume’s charm. Go, go, Ume-chan!\n\nKimi ni Todoke - Opening Theme\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN8Rlp3Oi94&w=560&h=315]\n\n[ad_middle]\n\nAny Animes Like NANA ?\n\n4. Hachimitsu to Clover (Honey and Clover)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 24 \" aired=\" April 2005-September 2005 \"]\n\nHoney and Clover tells the story of art students Takemoto Yuuta, Mayama Takumi, Morita Shinobu, Yamada Ayumi, and Hanamoto Hagumi as they go about their colorful and often chaotic lives.\n\nThis is the liveliest anime on the list. Don’t be fooled by Shinobu’s crazy antics and funny reactions, like every show on this list, Honey and Clover is filled with relatable characters and stories. Whether it’s Yuuta finding love for the first time, Takumi doing his best to finish college while dealing with is love life, Ayumi struggling with her unrequited love, or Hagumi dealing with rejection and slowly earning friends, it’s a ride you’ll be glad to go on. And despite being the oddest oddball of the bunch, Shinobu is always there to provide comedic and moral support to his friends. Dammit, Morita-san!\n\nHachimitsu to Clover - Official Trailer (English)\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TN4a0kZuXg&w=560&h=315]\n\n5. Toradora!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 25 \" aired=\" October 2008-March 2009 \"]\n\nTakasu Ryuuji is a nice guy, but due to his intimidating eyes, people only see him as a delinquent and so he’s totally hopeless about his chances at making friends, never mind getting a girlfriend. On his first day as a second-year highschool student, he is happy to be in the same class with his best pal Kitamura Yuusaku and his crush Kushieda Minori. However, he unwittingly bumps into Aisaka Taiga, the school’s “most dangerous animal.”\n\nDespite having the seemingly typical cast of stereotypes in an average high school romance setting, Toradora! ends up telling a mature story with characters that are not who they seem. Much like everything on this list, Toradora! is chockful of great characters, love triangles, friendships and break-ups – even more so than NANA.\n\nIf you ask me, Kawashima Ami is my favorite character in the show. At first, she’s this egotistic supermodel and as the show goes on, her perspective and attitude changes after meeting with the other cast like Taiga, Ryuuji and especially Minori. If you watched Toradora! when it aired in 2008-2009, I’m sure you know the nickname fans gave her — Ami-bro.\n\nToradora! - 2nd Opening Theme\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crAPDlMB8gQ&w=560&h=315]\n\n6. Full Moon wo Sagashite (Searching for a Full Moon)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 52 \" aired=\" April 2002-March 2003 \"]\n\n12-year-old Kouyama Mitsuki has big dreams of becoming a singer. One day, she made a promise with a boy named Eiichi that one day, when they meet again, they will have both fulfilled their dreams. Unfortunately for Mitsuki, she is diagnosed with a growth on her throat and if left untreated, the tumor will take her life. However, she refuses to be treated because in doing so, she will forever lose her ability to sing and fulfill her promise to the boy.\n\nAs her last days pass by, she is visited by two soul takers (shinigami), Takuto and Meroko to prepare for her departure to the afterlife. Refusing to give up, Mitsuki shows her resolve and passion to sing and convinced Takuto to help her. With his powers, and with some reluctant support from Meroko, they push Mitsuki to pursue her dreams by giving her a temporarily healthy body. Will Mitsuki fulfill her dream as a singer and meet Eiichi or will she fail and succumb to her illness?\n\nDon't be fooled by the kiddy nature of the art style and mahou shoujo-esque idol story because Full Moon wo Sagashite is a story about growing up, self discovery and fighting against all odds so you can reach your dream. Full Moon is very similar to NANA in many ways — the main character is a singer pursuing her career and tries to catch up to the person she holds dear.\n\nMitsuki meets friends and rivals along the way and she has to deal with a shaky love triangle between her and the shinigami pair, Takuto and Meroko. And of course, there's the music. While the track list is small compared to other idol anime, it compensates by how powerful each song is. Sung by MYCO with music by Changin' My Life, each song has a purpose, a meaning in terms of the story and Mitsuki herself.\n\nFull Moon wo Sagashite - Opening Theme\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igeYwGslD-M&w=560&h=315]\n\nThere you have it, folks, six anime that're thematically very similar to NANA. Yeah, I know I didn't include the obvious choice, Paradise Kiss (created by Yazawa Ai who also create NANA), but this was because I wanted each entry on the list to be a different experience, with similar themes. I feel that anime sharing the same creator doesn’t totally achieve that. I hope this list has piqued your interest in checking out the anime shown above, and please do bring a lot of tissues, you're gonna need them.\n\n[author author_id=\"026\" author=\"\" translator_id=\"\"] [ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]\n\n↧\n\nJapanese Railway Company Promoting Love Live!\n\nWhat You Need to Know:\n\nStarting today, the JR Tokyo's Yamanote line will have posters from, Love Live!

I’m talking about kawaii (cute) Anime. Usually, these type of shows are labeled as 'shoujo' and 'slice of life', but certainly not all 'shoujo' and 'slice of life' Anime are kawaii (and vice versa). For that reason, I believe kawaii should be considered an official genre to subdivide these shows that are increasingly popular. In the meantime, I will try and help those who are desperately searching for new and charming kawaii Anime (especially after the recent kawaii success, Umaru-chan). For those people who simply can’t get enough adorableness I present you my Top 10 Kawaii Anime!\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\n10. Mikakunin de Shinkoukei / Engaged to the Unidentified\n\n[Information episodes=\" 12 \" aired=\" Jan 2014 – Mar 2014 \"]\n\nMikakunin de Shinkoukei tells the story of sixteen-year-old Kobeni Yonomori, an average high school girl who has just learned she’s engaged to Hakuya Mitsumine, a boy of her age. Hakuya and his little sister, Mashiro, end up moving in with Kobeni and her older sister. All four of them will have to learn how to get along in this unusual and awkward situation. The show is inherently kawaii. All of the girls are really playful and everything they do is either silly or extremely sweet. Mashiro steals the show; she’s a great character and the smartest 9-year old you’ll ever meet. Everything about this show is just plain nice.\n\nTVアニメ『未確認で進行形』PV第2弾\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF0oKX45fQA&w=560&h=315]\n\n9.

She knows everything there is to know about mochi, and she is just as sweet as this traditional Japanese snack! The show is about Tamako, her strict family, her friends and an overweight talking bird named Dela Mochimazzi. It is filled with cute girls, each one nicer than the next, and a very likeable and funny bird who certainly thinks a lot of itself.\n\nTamako Market Anime Trailer 2\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYv_mfEoyvg&w=560&h=315]\n\n8. Usagi Drop / Bunny Drop\n\n[Information episodes=\" 11 \" aired=\" Jul 2011 – Sep 2011 \"]\n\nBunny Drop is a far more touching Anime than any other on this list. It’s not the typical kind of silly, playing around, kawaii Anime but it’s still cute and charming as hell. This is the story of a thirty year old single man named Daikichi Kawachi, who, at his grandfather’s funeral, learns of the existence of an illegitimate child his grandfather had. Knowing his family’s cruel intentions of giving her to an orphanage, Daikichi decides to take this six year old girl named Rin in adoption. Rin is a gorgeous little girl (similar in looks to Umaru-chan) who will captivate you and win over your heart. She’s a doll, helping poor Daikichi to be a good father. And Daikichi himself does not fall behind. He proves to have a golden heart, as he learns from scratch how to be a paternal figure and a positive influence on Rin’s life.\n\nUsagi Drop PV (Preview) English Subbed\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGUuY-kl9Eg&w=560&h=315]\n\n7.

This is the story of nine high school girls who form a pop idol group named μ's in order to attract applicants and keep their school from closing. With commitment, positivity and a lot of attitude, these young girls will fulfill their ambitions, becoming huge pop idols in the process.

K-On!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 39 \" aired=\" Apr 2009 – Sep 2010 \"]\n\nProbably the most popular show on this list, K-On is a successful comedy and slice of life show about four girls who play on the high school pop music band. Yui is the main character and the lead guitar in the band. She enters the music club thinking it will be a walk in the park, but far from being so she has to learn how to play guitar from zero. If you’re into Kawaii Anime chances are you have at least heard about K-On if you haven’t seen it already. It’s definitely a good choice for all kawaii addicts since it has pretty much everything you’re looking for in a cute show. The girls are joyful and playful. Yui is extremely talented but she’s also silly and every time she learns something she also forgets something. Also, the music they play is so full of life and uplifting that it’s impossible not to smile!\n\nK-On Trailer\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j9BCuKafmQ&w=560&h=315]\n\n[ad_middle]\n\n5. Cardcaptor Sakura\n\n[Information episodes=\" 70 \" aired=\" Apr 1998 – Mar 2000 \"]\n\nCardcaptor Sakura is my personal favorite among the many Sailor Moon rip offs. It is also the best in my opinion and by far the cutest. From the very opening and the soundtrack to the characters and Sakura’s flashy costume, everything on this show screams Kawaii! And don’t even get me started on Kero. He’s the most huggable little flying mouse thingy ever! The show is about Sakura, an average nice and popular high school girl who accidentally releases a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards. Sakura is then assigned to gather the cards with her newly acquired powers and the help of her guardian Kero, fighting the personification of each magical card.\n\nCARDCAPTOR SAKURA - Official Trailer\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luM4oGFSpT8&w=560&h=315]\n\n4. Ichigo Mashimaro / Strawberry Marshmallow\n\n[Information episodes=\" 12 \" aired=\" Jul 2005 – Oct 2005 \"]\n\nThe title of this show pretty much sums up all the kawaiiness (yup, I just made up a new word) in this show. It’s about four little girls, Chika, Miu, Matsuri and Coppola, and a young girl who acts as their older sister, Nobue. Together they go through a series of funny and silly adventures that quite often turn a little too bizarre and uncommon. The illustrations are straightforward cute and so are the main characters. Each one of the girls is special and funny in their own way. The older one, Nobue is a nicotine addict, while Chika is rather serious and uptight. Miu is the annoying one, Matsuri the shy one and Anna Coppola is the fashion girl in the group. So we definitely have all sorts of cuteness for everyone to choose from.\n\nIchigo Mashimaro Encore ~ short promo video\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rtk1N8kpIE&w=560&h=315]\n\n3.

The Hiiragi twins and Miyuki Takara are Konata’s best friends. All four of them go through the funniest situations on a regular basis. Lucky Star is one of the funniest shows on this list, and one of the cutest too. Merely judging from the characters looks, you’ll get right away just how much kawaii this show is. Everything about it is so pretty and the characters are all silly and childish and joyful and…and… OMG, it’s simply so nice to watch. Cuteness overload!\n\nLucky Star Trailer\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bSIgE8epA&w=560&h=315]\n\n2. Himouto! Umaru-chan / My Two-Faced Little Sister\n\n[Information episodes=\" 12 \" aired=\" Jul 2015 – Sep 2015 \"]\n\nEat, sleep, game, repeat! That’s all Umaru Doma does every day after school. As a student, she’s perfect, bright, popular and refined. What nobody knows is that she’s quite the opposite at home. After school, she puts on her hamster hoodie cloak and turns into a little spoiled and lazy brat. She does little at home other than eating potato chips, drinking soda and playing video games. Of course, when she’s not doing any of these things, then she’s probably bothering her brother and throwing a tantrum so that he goes out to buy her the new manga volume. That’s pretty much what the show’s about. It’s quite simple and straightforward cute. You’ll just fall in love with Umaru-chan and her playful view of things. This is the funniest kawaii anime I’ve ever seen and my personal favorite on this list. So go ahead and give it a try if you haven’t already.\n\n『干物妹！うまるちゃん』PV第2弾\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ10D-q8kLw&w=560&h=315]\n\n1.

How about this kindergarten where the most adorable little children compete for the attention of their male teacher? The lovely Anzu with the help of her new friends, the shy Koume and the peculiar Hiiragi, attempts to win the heart of their caretaker, Tsuchida. Of course, she’s no match for the beautiful Yamamoto, the kindergarten teacher in charge of the class next door, who happens to be Tsuchida’s infatuation. Hanamaru Kindergarten presents the most charming kindergarten girls and a child’s crush on her teacher. You’ll be puking rainbows after watching it. It just can’t get any cuter than this, not in a million years.\n\nHanamaru Kindergarten trailer\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj6K3M9Guhk&w=560&h=315]\n\nThat’s it for our list of Kawaii Anime; I sincerely hope it has satisfied your need for cuteness.

All those bishounen, anime tropes, and more--who could resist? Dance with Devils has been quite a seductive piece of female fan service providing many different elements that could swoon a high school girl's heart. However, when an episode comes out once a week, it can be tough to hang in there so you're probably looking for another series to pick up in the meantime. Not sure which anime will fit the bill? Well, here is a list of 6 anime like Dance with Devils for your enjoyment!\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\nSimilar Anime to Dance with Devils\n\n1.

Unfortunately for Yui, her life is soon going to take on a new direction with the Mukami tribe. Will her questions be answered? Or perhaps she'll be fodder of these new vampiric families. Much like Dance with Devils, Diabolik Lovers More,Blood delves into the supernatural with a cast of blood sucking bishounen, except the Sakamaki clan and the Mukami clan have no interest in protecting poor Yui. Yui is like Ritsuka, she's just a normal high school girl whose wellbeing is at the mercy of supernatural beings.

High School Star Musical (Starmyu)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 12 \" aired=\" October 2015 - ongoing \"]\n\nAyangai Academy is a school that focuses on music, but it has a musical department that is difficult to enter. You have to be accepted into the Star Frame Class, which is taught by the top students of the musical department, also called the Kaou-kai. This is a story that follows Hoshitani Yuuta, Nayuki Tooru, Tsukigami Kaito, Tengenji Kakeru, and Kuga Shuu who have been selected by the Kaou-kai's Ootori Itsuki. In order to achieve their dream, they have to work together, but can they get along enough to do that? Dance with Devils has a musical aspect of it when the characters do break off into song and dance, so a great anime this season with the same features would be High School Star Musical. High School Star Musical has singing, dancing, and bishounen, but it also takes a look at the bond between these five select students as they learn to work together to become the best. Think of it as an anime similar to Dance with Devils without any girls to take up the screen time of your favorite guys.\n\nHigh School Star Musical - PV2\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqmSP3mEHII&w=560&h=315]\n\n3.

At this school, Yui has to teach the other young gods about what it means to be human, but can she do that when they have no interest in humans? Kamigami no Asobi takes a look at a different side of the supernatural with gods instead of demons. The protagonist is another important human amongst a harem of very extraordinary bishounen. Kamigami no Asobi is also set in a school setting, much like Dance with Devils. You'll enjoy watching as you learn that although these gods have no care for humans, they are actually quite human inside.\n\nKamigami no Asobi - PV2\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW5r60YFruw&w=560&h=315]\n\n[ad_middle]\n\nAny Animes Like Dance with Devils ?\n\n4.

Chizuru ends up witnesses a fight between the Shinsengumi and an oni. The Shinsengumi take Chizuru back to their base to figure out what to do with her until they find out that she is the daughter of the doctor that they have been searching for. Chizuru finds herself under the protection of the Shinsengumi as she attempts to find out more information about her father, but along the way Chizuru will come across many mysteries, secrets, and perhaps love in her journey. Although both stories are set in different eras, the protagonists find themselves in very similar situations. Ritsuka was trying to find her mom while Chizuru is searching for her dad. They both find themselves being protected by a harem of bishounen with secrets that they both would never have imagined. If you are seeking a story of political struggle, drama, and the honor of the samurai, then you will enjoy watching the Shinsengumi in Hakuoki.\n\nHakuoki - Trailer HD\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clF2MAsiEzY&w=560&h=315]\n\n5.

Tamaki finds herself attacked by fabled creatures, but luckily, she is rescued by an amazing boy who is part demon. Tamaki soon learns that she has inherited the destiny as a Tamayori princess, but before she can take that all in, she has to attend a new high school as well. Can she handle the destiny given to her or will she shy away from fate? Much like Ritsuka, Tamaki has found herself in a situation that she never even dreamed of that defies logic. Well, her human logic, anyway. Both protagonists are just ordinary girls with extraordinary fates who are under the protection of a group of special guys. Although Tamaki may not be the strongest, she's no pushover either. If you want a supernatural anime with a stronger protagonist than some of the more recent reverse harems, you may want to see what Tamaki has in store for you.\n\nHIIRO NO KAKERA TRAILER\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArKgiJpz3m8&w=560&h=315]\n\n6.

Although Ritsuka has sung in Dance with Devils, Haruka in Uta no Prince-sama prefers to be in the back and compose the music that we see featured in Uta no Prince-sama.

In order for Yuuta Hoshitani to achieve his future dreams of stardom, he and his friends (an awkward inductee, a kabuki wunderkind, and the younger brother of a famous musician) must impress the members of the Kao Council, the cream of the crop of third year students in charge of ensuring the legacy of their Star Team. Dismissed at first for their lack of ability and their personal foibles, when they catch the eye of one of the council members, their dreams have a chance at realization with a lot of hard work and dedication. Star-Mu is a character-driven high school anime with an emphasis on light-heartedness and musical numbers. Although the first season is still mid-swing, viewers learn more about the ensemble cast and the ins and outs of club-life at Ayanagi as the series progresses, and the musical numbers keep ‘em coming back for more. Fans of high school anime, musical anime, and slice-of-life comedy have plenty of reasons to add it to their rotation. As fans, you already know this. Here are six anime for fans of Star-Mu.\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\nSimilar Anime to High School Star Musical\n\n6. K-On!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\" April 2009 – June 2009 \"]\n\nAt Sakuragaoka Girls High School, the light music club is on its last legs. That is, until recent inductee Yui Hirasawa misunderstands the club poster and expresses interest in joining as one of the required minimum four members, along with classmates Ritsu, Mio, and Tsumugi. There are, however, a few problems: she has absolutely no experience playing music, can’t read sheet music, and doesn’t even own the instrument the other girls want her to play. But the energy and heart of their performance gives her the determination to see it through. K-On! has plenty to offer fans of High School Star Musical. Although it takes place at an all-girls school, the high school environment will feel immediately familiar. The series has a quirky cast of core characters that have a very entertaining dynamic as they learn the ins and outs of musical club life, and there’s plenty of comedy and heart to tie the whole thing together.\n\nK-On!

Uta no Prince Sama\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\" July 2011 – September 2011 \"]\n\nBased on a popular visual novel video game series, Uta no Prince-Sama tells the story of idol fan girl and aspiring pop sensation Haruka Nanami. Haruka is a girl with dreams of composing music, especially for the idol she reveres. In hopes of achieving her dreams, she enrolls in Saotome, a prestigious performing arts school. If she is successful at school, she’ll get a head start on rocketing forward in her career, but the extremely competitive, eccentric student body is comprised of aspiring composers, would-be (and actual) idols, famous singers, and more. Much like High School Star Musical, music plays a very important role throughout the course of the show. Saotome Academy is just as cutthroat as Ayanagi, even if the student body is a bit more eccentric. The show’s overarching plot is broken up by plenty of silly character beats (including a transforming, evil prince), and the characters prove themselves incredibly likeable as they navigate the social minefield that is high school while trying to achieve their dreams.\n\nUta no Prince-Sama: Maji Love 1000% PV\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l4vpN7_bY4&w=560&h=315]\n\n4. Free!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 25 \" aired=\" July 2013 – September 2014 \"]\n\nFree! is set in the small town of Iwatobi, and follows the story of the taciturn but determined Haruka Nanase. The story begins with Haruka and his childhood friends crowned winners of an elementary school swimming tournament before going their separate ways. However, they reunite in Iwatobi High School, and when Haruka loses a swim match in the school’s run down pool, the friends create a swim club, determined to get back in shape and make the club a competitive success. Although this show doesn’t adhere to the musical theme of previous entries on the list, it has plenty to offer fans of High School Star Musical. Obviously, they share the high school setting, although Iwatobi is a much different environment. The story has a heavy emphasis on the bonds formed during club activities, and the dedication demanded to make the club a success. The characters are relatable and have unique foibles that help propel the plot forward as they come to terms with the nature of their friendships and the way things have changed since childhood.\n\nTV Anime “Free!” – PV 3\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuLQDwtBDgc&w=560&h=315]\n\n[ad_middle]\n\nAny Animes Like High School Star Musical ?\n\n3. La Corda D’Oro: Primo Passo\n\n[Information episodes=\" 25 \" aired=\" October 2006 – March 2007 \"]\n\nSeiso Academy is a school that caters to the musically inclined as well as general students looking to excel in their studies. One such student, Kahoko Hino, is a lover of music who never picked up an instrument. That changes after a fateful run in with Lili, a fairy who gifts Kahoko with a magical violin that allows her to play any songs she truly loves, and she agrees to enter the school’s highly competitive musical tournament, the Concours. La Corda D’Oro offers a somewhat whimsical twist on the musical theme enjoyed by fans of Star-Mu, but the classical music plays an important role in the series. Just like High School Star Musical, it’s a large part of how the characters grow closer. Like other entries on the list, and Star-Mu in particular, the high school setting is an important playground for the characters to interact and explore their feelings for one another, all while trying to juggle the demands of extracurricular activities and rigorous high school academia. As the contest draws nearer, the viewer, like Kahoko, begins to feel a very real fondness for her competition.\n\nLa Corda D’Oro Primo Passo Ave-Maria Duet Full Anime\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a7qYIAzPgE&w=560&h=315]\n\n2. Nodame Cantabile\n\n[Information episodes=\" 45 \" aired=\" January 2007 – March 2010 \"]\n\nNodame Cantabile centers around two equally passionate aspiring musicians at Momogaoka College with very different personalities. There is Shinichi Chiaki, an overbearing, somewhat arrogant perfectionist who plays several instruments and dreams of becoming a musical conductor but suffers from a crippling fear of flying over the ocean. Then, there is Megumi Noda, an eccentric, somewhat sloppy pianist who enjoys her music the way she enjoys her life; playful, and by ear. An accidental encounter blossoms into a one-sided romance, and as Megumi tries to win the heart of Shinichi, they get to know themselves and their classmates better. Star-Mu fans will find plenty to love in Nodame Cantabile. Like Star-Mu, the show is heavily inspired by and often features music to express its themes. Much like High School Star Musical, the heart of the show is the budding relationship between its main characters. As the plot progresses and they discover more about themselves and each other, they begin to mature and their relationship develops deeper meaning. But that doesn’t mean that the show doesn’t know how to have fun, since there are plenty of hilarious comedic beats, just like in Star-Mu, to keep the story clipping along.\n\nNodame Cantabile Trailer\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uiAXKql0Nw&w=560&h=315]\n\n1. Ouran High School Host Club\n\n[Information episodes=\" 26 \" aired=\" April 2006 – September 2006 \"]\n\nNo list of recommendations for anime that are club oriented and set in high school would be complete without mentioning Ouran High School Host Club. The show takes place at the titular Ouran Academy, an incredibly prestigious high school attended by Japan’s wealthiest, most influential budding socialites. Except, of course, diligent student Haruhi Fujioka. Haruhi is a scholarship student who becomes a de-facto (if indentured) member of the school’s infamous Host Club after shattering a priceless vase. Each episode, the Host Club (comprised of boys catering to a spectrum of feminine desires) hosts events with varying themes. This show has plenty to offer fans of Star-Mu. While music doesn’t play quite as prominent a role in the goings on as it does in other entries on the list, each episode is themed, and music plays a big part of that. Ouran Academy hosts a bizarre but earnest cast of characters inside and out of the Host Club, and they are the heart of the show, much like the aspiring inductees in Star-Mu. The school has so much personality it could be a character in and of itself, and no club seems quite as demanding as the Host Club. While the show oozes an eccentric comedic overtone, just like High School Star Musical, it often deals with rather mature themes, such as gender identity and discrimination, socio-economic perception, and friendship. Definitely check it out.\n\nOuran High School Host Club Official Trailer\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcC5VCE2Its&w=560&h=315]\n\nWith that, our list of recommendations comes to an end. What do you think? Are there any shows that true fans of High School Star Musical shouldn’t miss? Sound off in the comments below and let us know.\n\n[author author_id=\"017\" author=\"\" translator_id=\"\"] [ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]\n\n↧\n\nTop 10 Idol Anime [Best Recommendations]\n\n[ad_top1 class=\"mb40\"]\n\nTop 10 Idol Anime It’s no secret that music has a certain power to it that can be used to inspire joy amongst the crowds. This is the philosophy of the idol, singers within Japan that quickly become regarded as pop culture icons. Modelling, acting, singing, all of these fit within the role of an idol in Japan. So what better way to take a look into this phenomenon than through anime. Whether it’s kids shows, science fiction nonsense or excellent character stories, the world of idol anime has a lot to offer. Here’s 10 standout shows that display the spirit of the idol in the best way possible.\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\n10. Aikatsu!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 163 \" aired=\" October 2012 - Present \"]\n\nStarting off with the big shots, Aikatsu is one of Bandai’s vanguards when it comes to their hit franchises. At 163 episodes, Aikatsu is huge amongst younger audiences and is incredibly influential. When Ichigo Hoshimiya is invited by a friend to join the idol training academy, Starlight Academy, she enters into a brand new world of rivals, friendship and the wonders of idol life. But Aikatsu is more than just fun and friendship. There’s some realities of the idol industry that’s explored really well, diving into PR, interviews and public image. Sure, this might be a normal thing for idol series in general but for something as hugely popular within a younger demographic as this, it’s impressive to see this level of information being delivered through the show.\n\n9. Show By Rock!!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 12 \" aired=\" April 2015 - June 2015 \"]\n\nShow By Rock!! is fantastic in the weirdest ways and it’s one that’s somewhat difficult to explain in a sensical manner. But I’ll try. A girl who is too nervous to join her school band gets transported into a mysterious fantasy world powered by the magic of music. She turns into a catgirl for some reason or another and joins a band. They turn into CGI animals when they perform. Now you’re either hooked or confused by that summary but for those still with me, Show By Rock!! is an absolute blast. It’s hilariously funny, ridiculous and brilliant all at the same time, offering one of the cheesiest experiences I’ve ever had watching anime. And if Season 1 isn’t enough, a sequel has been announced!\n\n8. The iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls\n\n[Information episodes=\" 25 \" aired=\" January 2015 - October 2015 \"]\n\nOkay, so The Idolm@ster: Cinderella Girls may not hold a candle to the original, but that doesn’t stop it from being great in its own right. This is particularly true for its second half where it put unexpected characters together, exploring each of the cast’s personalities more thoroughly. It quickly gets into its stride, no longer relying on one-note characteristics and creating these moments that can be genuinely regarded as special. It’s a whole new cast for the Idolm@ster franchise and there’s so much to explore here as the idols and producers try to make the Cinderella Project a big success. Much like the original series, it’s an inspirational journey within the idol industry as they must gain fame and recognition to achieve their goals on the main stage.\n\n7. Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Maji Love 1000%\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\" July 2011 - September 2011 \"]\n\nLet’s try a different approach. Maybe what you’re looking for isn’t a story about idols in skirts and ribbons, but rather a story about camp men in fancy suits. Uta no Prince-sama is one of the most popular series within the genre of male idols as it captures us with its charismatic charm. Whilst the setup is certainly one of a reverse harem, even the female lead, Haruka becomes a key part of the idol group. Uta no Prince offers something that is both familiar, yet distant to many idol fans who will have enjoyed other series on this list. Despite it being somewhat unappealing to the male viewer, I’d highly recommend it regardless as much of the interactions and basic structure you’ll be used to is still ingrained within it. Oh, and the music is actually really good too. That’s probably important.\n\n6. Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream\n\n[Information episodes=\" 51 \" aired=\" April 2011 - March 2012 \"]\n\nMuch like many other picks on this list, Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream is originally based on a video game where the player must dance to the rhythm of the song. However, unlike many of the picks here, Pretty Rhythm isn’t just a game about dancing, with it also having a heavy focus on fashion. So with source material like this, it’s no surprise that this idol show takes a heavy focus on the public image side of being an idol. Pretty Rhythm is charming in its own special way as these superidols known as “Prism Stars” aim to become “Prism Queen”s and conquer the stage in this fun series. Yes, it’s another combination between the slice of life and idol genres, but through its lovable cast, it’s capable of supporting itself on its own merits through character interactions and the performances themselves.\n\n[ad_middle]\n\n5. AKB0048\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\" April 2012 - July 2012 \"]\n\nIdols are forever, as AKB0048 clearly demonstrates. During the 21st century a world war breaks out, leaving the planet Earth devastated. With no other choice, the human race escapes the planet to settle across the galaxy and find a new future. But with this comes conflict and corruption as some planets start to regulate the entertainment industries, including idols when the world needs them most. So, the sci-fi successor group AKB0048 must travel the stars as a rogue group, fighting against corrupt governments with the aim of reaching the people’s hearts in an attempt to reunite humanity. It’s definitely strange and by no means even remotely realistic, but it takes these leaps of logic to create something genuinely special and different. There’s many ways to create an anime about the hit AKB48 band, but this was certainly out-of-the-box.\n\n4. Futsuu no Joshikousei ga [Locodol] Yatte Mita. (Locodol)\n\n[Information episodes=\" 12 \" aired=\" July 2014 - September 2014 \"]\n\nLocodol is a very very easy show to love. Take away the spectacle, the bright lights and the fame from your typical idol show and what are you left with? Locodol, of course! Focusing on local idols, Nanako and Yukari, they’re not performing huge stage shows or acting in advertising campaigns for huge corporations. They’re helping out their local stores, putting a wide smile on the faces of local residents and promoting the town to those that might choose to visit. It’s incredibly humble and it does so much to make this story stand out as a new direction for the genre, despite other shows being very much focused on the flashier side of this world. It even dives into the idea of local mascots acting as PR for regional towns with cheesy theme songs and family friendly events. It’s just lovely in every definition of the word and is highly recommended.\n\n3. Wake Up, Girls!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 12 \" aired=\" January 2014 - March 2014 \"]\n\nWake Up Girls is an idol show that is entirely aware of what it’s out to achieve. By presenting itself as a more grounded series in comparison to its competitors, Wake Up, Girls isn’t afraid to show both sides of what the idol industry really is. Occasionally a wonderful place but ever so often, a sickeningly dreadful one. After the prequel film that showed the group being set up, the series is very much focused on telling character stories and giving cause them to grow as people. Whilst Wake Up, Girls doesn’t deviate much from standard idol tropes and ideas, it very much has its own agenda when it comes to its tone and how it delivers its narrative. Just these small things give it so much plot direction with the characters starting as rookies and some having their own personal troubles. There’s really something special lying within Wake Up, Girls and I strongly recommend you take the time to find it.\n\n2. Love Live!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\" January 2013 - March 2013 \"]\n\nLove Live! is arguably one of the most popular idol series out there. With Sunrise taking its next idol venture away from kids series and into the late night realm, Love Live appealed very quickly. Presented as this very oddly structured slice of life and idol show, Love Live captured audiences through its cast of 9 diverse characters, each with their own jokes and character dynamics, leading to it becoming a global success. Through the concept of “school idols”, where students represent their high schools through competition, Love Live seems to have found the ultimate blend and has capitalised on it big time. With a second season releasing the following year and then a film with a global theatrical release earlier this year, there’s plenty of Love Live to go around and don’t worry, it’s not too late to jump into the franchise now.\n\n1. The iDOLM@STER\n\n[Information episodes=\" 25 \" aired=\" July 2011 - December 2011 \"]\n\nThe Idolm@ster is the best idol series yet and for very good reason. Everything that we expect of a series of this genre, Idolmaster gifts beyond our expectations. With one of the best casts in anime, every single character dynamic within this surprisingly large cast works exceptionally well. With groups splitting off from the larger studio, there’s plenty of opportunity for new interactions to arise and there’s rarely cases where it feels at all wrong. Whilst it is the typical, “Group of girls try to become more popular idols” story, it’s always presented in new and unique ways, turning what should be boring PR events into something the viewer really wants to get involved in. Nothing feels obligatory or forced, every part of this puzzle piece finely fits into one of the larger stories, creating moments that can genuinely be regarded as standout all the way throughout.\n\nSo there’s some great idol shows that you really need to be checking out. Whilst some of them may fit under the tag of ‘generic’, there’s some really special shows here that expand beyond the definition of “Idol anime” to create new stories. If there’s anything that I missed (There probably is), let us know in the comments section.\n\n[author author_id=\"027\" author=\"\" translator_id=\"\"] [ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]\n\n↧\n\nTop 10 Stunningly Handsome Uta no Prince-sama Characters\n\n[ad_top1 class=\"mb40\"]\n\nBeginning as an otome music game, and making its way to one of the biggest franchise in the anime industry in Japan, Uta no Prince-sama is filled with stunningly handsome, talented boys with gorgeous voices that had proven effective in killing every fangirl’s heart with a single whisper. Having finished its fourth Maji Love Live concert earlier this January, fans were graced with a much-awaited news: another new season in Fall 2016! Impatient to see the ST☆RISH boys back up on screen? Or for the Quartet Night senpai who’s been getting even more screen time ever since Maji Love Revolution began? Or are you extremely curious about the new HEAVENS members? Well, fall is still a while away, but in the meantime, let’s take a look at our selection on the best Uta no Prince-sama characters, and see if you could spot your favorite!\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\n10. Aijima Cecil\n\nWhat better way to start but with the actual Prince amongst the other Princes? Aijima Cecil, the Prince of Agnapolis, the seventh member of ST☆RISH. Coming straight out of a fairytale as a cursed Prince, seeing him for a first time might make you think he’s mysterious and dreamy, enchanting with his gorgeous green eyes—which he is, but what would touch your heart would be his child-like curiosity and his sensitivity to others’ emotions. He plays the flute, and is able to connect to the gods directly through the Muses, and he’s the one who brings the Agna Dance. Despite his initial mysterious appearance in the first season in the anime, Cecil steals people’s hearts by steadily being cuter and cuter in starting his actual appearance in the Maji Love 2000%.. Not to mention his adorably accented, sometimes-still-fumbling Japanese that Toriumi Kousuke brought to life. His songs are like warm invitation to enter a world of fairytale from faraway lands, vowing to take you through fantasy-like love. It doesn’t mean he would not stand up to defend you when the time calls for it—like how he confronted Camus about playing with Nanami in Maji Love Revolution, he’ll certainly show you his fierce, determined side, too!\n\n9. Kotobuki Reiji\n\nA funny, clown-like personality at the first glance might fool you, if it doesn’t endear him to you. Kotobuki Reiji, the oldest member of Quartet Night idol group, is one of the mature senpai of STARISH, assigned to guide both Tokiya and Otoya in the Master Course. His smile might be blinding, and Reiji might cajole like a big brother or act cutely in front of his peers and fans, but there’s a side to him that shows his mature side—seductive smiles, car rides, magic tricks, casual winks, the promising thrill of an adult relationship! It’s definitely the gap that would send your heart race! Reiji is also known for giving adorable nicknames for everyone, as well as his cute catch phrases—“Yoroshiku Maccho ccho☆!”—and of course, his fun maracas. He’s the type to hold his lover gently and keep them safe, but also the type who could make you laugh in a heartbeat. Most of his songs are upbeat and slightly flirtatious, a perfect fit for Morikubo Showtaro’s type of voice. In Quartet Night, Reiji is the one who wishes to have more work as Quartet Night the most, after getting inspired by STARISH’s harmony. A definite all-rounder who is nice to everyone, like a big brother, but also mature when the time calls, what more would you want?\n\n8. Shinomiya Natsuki\n\nArguably the member of STARISH with the brightest personality, Natsuki loves everything small and cute. Amongst STARISH, Natsuki is the tallest, but he is also the most tender and gentle to everyone. Be careful not to accidentally take off his glasses, because then Satsuki, Natsuki’s other personality, would appear, and you would see a whole other side of Natsuki: the brash, extremely strong, temperamental, but also passionate and the sincerest. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say the two of them are like the yin and yang personality in one body; Natsuki doesn’t remember anything when Satsuki takes over, but regardless, he senses that someone is always protecting him, and he’s thankful for that. Known as a musical genius, Natsuki plays the viola now, but he used to play the violin as well and entered violin competitions with Syo back in his childhood. He also likes to bake, but anyone sane would advise you never to try whatever he comes up with in the kitchen. It’s the thought that counts, though; Natsuki shows his support through his cookings, like when he tried to cheer Nanami up by baking cookies. His songs are always amazingly good—a mix of pop rock with Taniyama Kishow’s powerful vocal—flying you up to the burning star with his passion for dreams and love, that you’d wish time itself would stop!\n\n7. Mikaze Ai\n\nThe prettiest and youngest member of Quartet Night for sure, Mikaze Ai appears untouchable and very strict at first, but later it’s shown that he’s very hardworking and expects everyone around him to be the same. Here’s the twist: he is actually an artificial intelligence, an idol robot created on the order of Shining Saotome, so he’s constantly learning on understanding human emotions, feelings and bonds. Ai always observes everything calmly and quietly, and has a knack in predicting everything correctly, but when it comes to new emotions he’s yet to understand, the way he pauses and puzzles it out would make your heart skip a beat! Ai is assigned to train both Natsuki and Syo in the Master Course. He also plays the synthesizer. The best way to look at Ai’s feelings are through his songs—a lot of them are slow ballads with high notes delivered smoothly by Aoi Shouta, beautifully quiet the way Ai is, reflecting his efforts to understand people and how he is affected by the emotions he learns. His charming points would be his honesty and straight-forward way of thinking that just makes his beauty shine even more. When he gets motivated and throws his everything into what he does, such as when Quartet Night decides to go against STARISH with all their might, Ai’s quiet determination and hardwork definitely endears him to heart!\n\n6. Jinguuji Ren\n\nThe most charismatic member of STARISH, Jinguuji Ren is also known as arguably the hottest member, practically oozing pheromones wherever he goes. Once voted as the member fans wish to be their boyfriend the most, Ren is a very smooth-talker and a ladies’ man. As the third son of the wealthy Jinguuji family, Ren used to dislike attending Saotome Academy because he thought his brother just sent him to be an idol in order to promote their family’s company. In truth, though, his brother sent him because he knew of Ren’s passion and brilliance in music. Through Nanami and other STARISH members, though, Ren discovers back his passion for music, and wholeheartedly puts his feelings in working as an idol. He’s very easy-going and might seem loose at times, but he’s really just a boy who loves freedom and values having choices in life. The flashback scene to his childhood that showed him playing with Masato might just be the cutest image you’d ever see! Ren is very flirtatious, though, so prepare your heart to race wildly if he appears with a rose and seductively calls you his ‘lady’. Most of his songs are intense if a bit flirtatious, conveying his fiery passion and love, completely made for Suwabe Junichi’s performance. To add to his charm, Ren also plays saxophone, is interested in foreign languages, and speaks Italian. Definitely a catch, don’t you think?\n\n[ad_middle]\n\n5. Ittoki Otoya\n\nIf you like a bubbly, exceedingly kind, and energetic boys, Otoya is definitely your guy. He’s pure, trusts people, and always tries his best to be helpful, to the point that you might even think he’s an angel! His positive and friendly personality makes him very easy to approach, and since he’s the kind of person who always tries his hardest to improve and be optimistic, you’d feel like you want to support him always and watch him grow. Otoya grew up in an orphanage, and is known as “Oto-nii” to the orphanage kids who are younger than him. He loves sports, but he loves singing even more—a lot of his songs are the upbeat, optimistic songs delivered with the same spirit by Terashima Takuya, and they’re great songs to cheer you up on your bad days! Otoya plays the guitar, befitting of his upbeat personality. Compared to his roommate Tokiya, Otoya might seem childish, but he’s actually a good big brother to the orphanage kids! The childish parts of him, like not liking green peppers and black coffee, are very endearing to see. Otoya’s charm point is his kindness and how he thinks of everyone else and how to help them. Before his adorable attitude and his straightforward determination, you might just find your heart skip a beat, especially when he would not hesitate to stand up for you, and shows his support in everything that you do!\n\n4. Kurosaki Ranmaru\n\nAssigned to be the mentor of both Ren and Masato, Ranmaru is another member of Quartet Night who might just steal your heart with his passion for his dreams. A rocker through and through, Ranmaru is a very moody person, but also often gets flustered by sincere praising words. His family used to be very wealthy, on par with Masato and Ren’s, but after his father was betrayed by a colleague, the Kurosaki family fell into an immense debt. After his father’s death, Ranmaru takes it to himself to pay his family’s debt. This, coupled with how several of his bands before he became an idol always disbanded, makes it hard for him to trust anyone. Ranmaru might seem rude, but he has a strong sense of duty and a fiery passion for his dream and music that would no doubt lends the same sense when it comes to love. If you can gain his trust, he’d definitely show his softer side to you—the Ranmaru who likes to pet and feed cats, who is good at cooking, and would ruffle your hair in shows of affection. The contrast between his softer side and his fiery, determined and hard personality is his charm point, making each of his smile a treasure! Most of his songs are rock songs, true to his nature and the natural song genre of his seiyuu, Suzuki Tatsuhisa. Not only is he stunningly hot, Ranmaru also plays bass and is very fashionable, and you’d undoubtedly feel very safe being with him!\n\n3. Hijirikawa Masato\n\nThe old-fashioned Japanese type. Exceedingly beautiful and elegant, but make no mistake, when it comes to determination and sincerity, Masato doesn’t lose to anyone. As a scion of the wealthy Hijirikawa family, Masato was supposed to take over his family’s company, but he stubbornly chose to enroll at Saotome Academy to be an idol. At first glance, Masato looks to be an untouchable, stoic, elegant young master, but in actuality he’s adorably awkward when it comes to talking with people and a very down-to-earth, gentle person. He loves things like melon pan, and a lot of times he cooks for others as well. Gorgeous the way Japanese paintings are, elegant, kind, and great at both calligraphy and cooking, what’s not to like? Once he’s behind a piano, Masato would captivate you, especially coupled with his music. Most of his songs have very poetic lyrics, reflecting his thoughts about future and feelings, flawlessly sung by Suzumura Kenichi. Despite his stoic appearances, Masato feels things very strongly and is very passionate and protective about things he deems important. As he was born and raised in a very proper and strict family, Masato grows up to be a very pure young man. Once you see his adorable side—liking melon pan, putting on aprons, enjoying hot springs, watching snow falls, or just ducking away from bugs, you might just find your heart skips a beat there!\n\n2. Ichinose Tokiya\n\nMr. Perfectionist who never loses his cool and has the smile that melts your heart instantly. At first, Tokiya seems aloof and cold to everyone, but later on he began to open up and shows a gentler, caring side. He’s very ambitious and proud about his dreams, but in STARISH he also learns how to treasure the friends who fight with him, and always looks forward to help them in any way he could. As an idol, Tokiya previously had a persona called HAYATO, who he pretended to be his twin brother and had to live a double-life because of it. On top of having a beautiful face, he was also voted as the sexiest men in a fashion magazine along with Ren—but let’s be real, his singing is super sexy, too. His songs range from sweet ballads to flirty, scandalous songs, but Miyano Mamoru as Tokiya sings them amazingly well. Tokiya is an all-rounder who is good at most of the things he does, including singing and playing various music instruments. He’s also very patient, even if he’s a bit shy in expressing his true feelings, and tends to express them through the lyrics of his songs. Being the perfectionist that he is, he would not stop his efforts until he gets something perfect, and no doubt he would put the same amount when it comes to his love life, too. Even his fellow STARISH members had expressed their admiration—Otoya openly said that Tokiya’s singing is perfect, and that he’s always very nice to him. Prepare for your heart to melt before his smile, even more so when his cool demeanor opens up to a softer personality inside, a peek into the secret Mr. Perfectionist holds!\n\n1. Kurusu Syo\n\nSyo might be the shortest one out of all STARISH members, but he’s also the manliest out of them! He’s even more upbeat and energetic than Otoya, and even though he looks cute thanks to his size, everyone remarks that his soul is the most manly of all. He’s hot-headed and sometimes easily baited to anger, especially when Natsuki is involved, but at the same time Syo cares about everyone around him very much, and even stays close to Natsuki in order to keep guard if he accidentally drops his glasses and Satsuki appears. Syo is also very zealous, braver than anyone else, and always tries his hardest in everything that he does. You can easily see this reflected in his songs—always upbeat and fun, encouraging you to fight and run forward, befitting Shimono Hiro’s singing style a lot. Despite being the smallest in STARISH, Syo has won the first place of several popular character ranking in Japan. Being stylish on top of having an adorable face, bringing fun into everything and very encouraging, not to mention his ‘manly’ soul that shines when he shows everyone how brave he is in facing his fears and phobia—Syo is not your usual Knight in Shining Armour, but he could be your Knight, always there to support and protect you!\n\nUta no Prince-sama is a very fun series; good animation and splashing colors and sparkles on top of having gorgeous male characters who would make amazing boyfriends. Its huge franchise proves that having a light-hearted, fun storytelling doesn’t mean people don’t get attached to the characters—they are, after all Princes, and they give dreams to the audience. Each of them are unique to themselves, an embodiment of a trope and an image, and is that not the essence of idols? Let us know which Prince is your favorite!\n\n[author author_id=\"039\" author=\"\" translator_id=\"\"] [ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"]\n\n↧\n\n6 Anime Like HaruChika [Recommendations]\n\n[ad_top1 class=\"mb40\"]\n\nWhen she graduates from middle school and enrols into high school, Homura Chika vowed to change her interests from volleyball to music. Joining her in the wind instruments club is Kamijou Haruta, her childhood friend whom happened to be in the same high school as her. Things doesn't go smoothly as planned however, as the club does not meet the minimum requirement of members and faced the threat of closing down. Not only that, a mysterious event occurs during their first year and the members must band together in order to seek the truth. HaruChika is a mystery anime with music and romance as a sub-genre. For viewers who enjoy a slice of life anime imbued with mystery, this may just be the anime for you! To get a clearer picture of the anime, we will be listing down 6 animes like HaruChika.\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\nSimilar Anime to HaruChika\n\n1. Hibike! Euphonium\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\" Apr 2015 - Jul 2015 \"]\n\nKumiko Oumae has a jaded past with music. After failing to meet the qualifiers in the middle school regional band competition, she swore to never touch her euphonium ever again. Unfortunately for her, the situation and her friends made her join the high school band yet again. Once again, Kumiko must strive for the high school competition and make amends with fellow middle school band member, Reina Kousaka. Hibike was very well received due to its balanced portrayal on the genres of Music, School Life and Slice of Life. If any one of you were ever in the high school band club, you definitely will be able to empathize with the hardship of playing the instrument as a team and struggling to make it into the competition. Hibike does just that for you by painting a realistic look of a band club member and fulfilling the dreams and aspirations of those that did not made it. It shares the same simplicity of daily lives in a music club as HaruChika, although Hibike places more emphasis on woodwind instruments and also less on the mystery\n\nHibike!

K-on!\n\n[Information episodes=\" 13 \" aired=\" Apr 2009 - Jun 2009 \"]\n\nHirasawa Yui is a girl just about to enter high school. Carefree and somewhat of an airhead, she is unsure of which club to join in high school when she chances upon an advertisement for the Light Music Club. Inspired, she quickly took a liking to the idea, and proceeds to meet with the other club members - Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi. This easy to watch anime shows the fun that occurs within the Light Music Club! Simple and fun to watch, K-on has a good collection of music, some being very catchy. K-on has a stronger focus on music than HaruChika, but not so much on the mystery. Both share the same developments of a club lacking in members, and then slowly building it up from nothing. K-on was, and perhaps still one of the top high school slice of life anime.\n\nK-On! Trailer\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j9BCuKafmQ&w=560&h=315]\n\n3.

Forced to join the Classics Club, he is often pushed around by Eru Chitanda, an inquisitive girl who loves a good mystery. Much of the days that Oreki will face from now on are of mysteries, mysteries and more mysteries. Hyouka is an anime of short mysteries, such as a missing wallet or the truth to an urban tale. While it may sound mundane and not at all impressive, the anime does a superb job making each of these mysteries as captivating as possible, and the flow of reasoning is easy to grasp. Often occurring during club time, both Hyouka and HaruChika shares the same bits of mystery that occurs at school, with Hyouka purely focused on mystery.\n\nHyouka Promo\n\n[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_-87ba4C_g&w=560&h=315]\n\n[ad_middle]\n\nAny Animes Like HaruChika ?\n\n4.

That is because music is often said to be the universal language of mankind and the language of the soul. Anyone is able to simply listen to it and truly understand the sentiments that music is trying to evoke. Be it a fast paced rock/metal track or a slow, calming classical/soft tune, music sets the mood of the anime, and truly communicates the inner emotions of the characters, or the situation in a way not even the images can’t describe. Today, we go through how some of the most popular songs in anime that depicted the mood of the whole anime series flawlessly, ranging from the Original Sound Tracks (OST), to the Openings and Endings (OPs & EDs). Firstly, we will move on to how music is used as a tool to portray and transfer emotions, setting the mood for the anime. Subsequently, we'll talk about one of the anime in which the music is really what defined it and made it popular.\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40\"]\n\nWhere music is used to express emotions and situations\n\nMusic is a powerful tool. Not only can it be used to tell a story, it can also be used to describe human emotions and situations. Below are some examples of where music sets the mood of an anime or a character's feelings such as a particularly sad event or a happy event.\n\n1. Expression of emotions - Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso\n\nThe study of music was conceptualized in the West with the study of classical music. Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso centralises on the theme of classical music. Shigatsu uses the foundational study of music to portray the development of characters using suitable famous pieces from masters such as Beethoven and Chopin to display anguish, pain and desolation of the pianist, Arima Kousei. In contrast, the pieces of virtuoso violinists such as Kriesler and Saint-Saens are performed but the subtle differences in style and technique of Kaori Miyazono shows how music is the key to the freedom of expression and how it reflects her free-spirited personality. Although what was played were excerpts of pieces, the differences between mashing the keys on the keyboard and playing elegantly are shown by the different characters which are also reflective of their personality. One of the greatest quote from this anime that stands and remains as the maxim of music is \"Music transcends words\". To be honest, you need not to understand Japanese or even play music to understand the emotions depicted in this anime through the melodies and tones. You can hear the anguish and the pain of Arima simply by listening and how the soul is liberated from the free-spirited playing style of Kaori. The element that defines a musician after all, is his/her own personality and how they modify the music to reflect themselves and their mood.\n\n2. Expression of doleful events - Clannad\n\nClannad is a highly reputed masterpiece in the genre of slice of life anime accented with bittersweet romance. Clannad's claim to fame comes from not just its story but the background music that perfectly complements the situation whenever a pivotal event occurs during the anime. Clannad OST was composed, arranged, and produced by Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito, and Magome Togoshi. This amazing beautiful soundtrack of the anime series consists of three disc with a total of 56 songs. The BGMs resonates with the hearts of the viewers through the heart-wrenching tale of Clannad augmented by the doleful music that demonstrates the beauty of human relations blooming amidst a torrential maelstrom of complications. The exceptionally emotional OST of Clannad evokes that sense of humanity in us that is empathy. As the feelings poured out of the characters, so does the music, which blends into the raw expression of emotions of the characters. The beauty of Clannad lies not just in a perfectly crafted story but in its stunning composition of music.\n\n[ad_middle class=\"mt40 mb40\"]\n\n3. Expression of Energy and Hype - Action anime\n\nThe iconic ‘Only My Railgun’ by fripSide is a beloved favourite amongst anime fans being a staple of a form of music in J-pop culture. With a very fast tempo and an expertly crafted composition by Satoshi (Sat), and powerful vocals provided by Nanjo, this pop/trance track allowed fripSide to shoot to fame. This electrifying OP is synonymous with the main heroine, Misaka Mikoto - the Level 5 Electromaster in the anime A Certain Scientific Railgun the spin-off series of A Certain Magical Index\n\nThe OST of the revamped Fate/stay night: UBW contains new renditions of character themes and battle scenes. These OSTs are specific and significant to the characters that are appearing on-screen. With the final confrontation between Archer and Emiya in their Reality Marbles, the insert song for this epic battle does not fall short of expectations. ‘Last Stardust’ sung by Aimer starts off in a low pitch and then slowly ascending into a higher pitch. At its pinnacle during the chorus, the power of Aimer's vocals emanates revitalized energy with the chorus playing concurrently with Emiya finding the resolve to fight making the fight all the more epic and bringing it to a whole new level. From these two instances, you can see that music is not only reserved for emotional scenes and soft characters, but also for intense action, energetic and spirited sequences as well. There is something with hearing a rock piece or metal piece that really gets the mood going, you will instantly know that it is about to get real.\n\nWhere the Music Defines the Anime - Guilty Crown\n\nIn year 2011, Guilty Crown was a much debatable anime. It was a split between the people that loved the anime, and the people that disliked the anime. Some felt that the story was underdeveloped, while some felt that the ending was just right and should've ended the way it ended. One thing was for sure, though, it was unanimous that the reason why Guilty Crown was so well-received, was the music. First OP 'My Dearest' sung by Supercell, and the second, 'The Everlasting Guilty Crown’ sung by Egoist, brought about a mad rave in the forums. It was undoubtedly dubbed the anime with the best music in the season. So what makes the music in Guilty Crown so good? First, both, the fast paced and dynamic OPs are very catchy, gets you hyped up, and being the mecha-action anime that it is, it’s very appropriate for the series. The sizzling and sensational OPs are what captures the heart of people and you can simply relish in the OP before every episode starts. Next, we look into the ED; ‘Departures’ Sung by Yu Na. Departures is a softer, calming that brings in instruments of a more delicate nature like the piano and the violin. The lyrics of the song are attuned with the conclusion of Guilty Crown despite being the first ED. At first glance, it seems like a very soothing piece, but all is revealed when the song is sung again at the conclusion of the anime, which puts everything in perspective. We won't spoil it for you if you haven't watched it. But for those that did, you know what we meant. Lastly, we look into the OSTs. Bios and ‘Euterpe’ sung by Mika Kobayashi and Egoist respectively. Bios being very fitting with the battle sequences which is sung entirely in German as a unique style of Mika's. Heavy instruments are used to harmonize with the powerful vocals of Mika that generally evokes a sense of power and the fighting spirit. ‘Euterpe’ is a sorrowful song that is sung at the very beginning which has desolation overlaying an aura of mystery. The OSTs encompasses both heavy and light genres. Both OPs and EDs shows that the series highlights the sequence of events very well. Bring an upbeat start to every episode with dynamic pop music and end it off with a soothing song after all that intense action. With the OSTs being a complement and an expression in situations of high intensity and introspection of the characters, Guilty Crown utilises music to portray the feelings of characters in a notable manner.\n\nThe Music is what Draws us into the Anime Scenes\n\nBased on all of the above, have you ever experienced this before - as you play your favourite song and you reach the chorus or a certain point in the song, you experience a shiver up your spine and then feeling a momentary surge of ranging emotions? That is what a well composed melody can do for you. Try to watch an action or a romantic scene without background music, boring, right?. As we associate events in the anime with the music that is playing, we experience a burst of transient emotions that make us connect our own senses with the scenes we’re watching. Music stimulates us in a way no words could ever do. After all, music is the universal language and it allows us to connect to it without the need for prior exposure first. Innately, we all understand music, and while it may be hard to express it out, we see it as the raw emotions of the soul making it all the more easier to allow it to become synonymous with our own personal feelings. And that is why music adds a whole new depth of experience to your anime. Music is not simply about setting the mood in anime, it IS the mood of anime. There are many good animes with good music out there as well, we will like to give special honourable mentions to Nodame Cantabile, Hibike Euphonium, Psycho Pass and Noragami as well. Do you have any OSTs, OPs & EDs that you love? Has it affected you in any way at all?

Characters\n\n[ad_top1 class=\"mb40\"]\n\n[sourceLink asin=\"B006WJ5LWU\" asin_jp=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\n\nK-On! Is the charming and lighthearted story of a light music club and it's members. Mio Akiyama, Yui Hirasawa, Tsumugi Kotobuki, Ritsu Tainaka and Azusa Nakano make up the club and form a band called 'Hokago Tea-Time.' The series is a hysterical SoL detailing the experiences and growth of the club. They start of as 5 very different people who, likely, would end up going along very different paths in life. However, as they grow together, more and more do they want to stay together. K-On! Is a beautiful series with great characters and we're going to show the 10 best.\n\n[ad_top2 class=\"mt40 mb40\"]\n\n10. Tomi Ichimonji\n\nYou might not know her by name, but Tomi Ichimonji is Yui's elderly neighbor. She's always on good terms with Yui and the rest of her family, and the Hirasawa's always make time to try to chit-chat with her. You can tell they really respect Tomi Ichimonji. Yui, Ui and Nodoka all have a long-standing relationship with her as their long-time neighbor, and Tomi did a lot for them when they were younger. She exemplifies the graceful, caring presence of an elderly person who looks out for everyone including her neighbors, and she's someone who should be treated with great love and respect in all communities.\n\n9. Jun Suzuki\n\nJun is close friends with Azusa Nakano and Ui Hirasawa and despite not having as much screen-time as them, she's still lovable in her own right. Jun is a pretty care-free personality but can be a bit of a ditz in terms of accidentally becoming a little demanding every now and again. Still, she's very kind and sweet hearted and gets along very well with everyone. Jun is still trying hard to improve herself as a bass-player, partially because of her admiration of Mio. She may not be as much as a focus as the rest of the cast but Jun has a very playful and easygoing personality which makes her easy to life.\n\n8. Azuza Nakano\n\nAzuza (Or Azu-Nyan) for short, is the first of the 5 main characters to make it on the list. There's really no bad K-On! Characters, and she's up against some stiff competition which puts her relatively low in the standings. However, Azu-Nyan is still a wonderful and charming character. She has one of the more interesting character arcs in the series for starters. At first, she's taken aback by Yui's slacker attitude and Is upset that the club doesn't take a more serious approach. However, overtime she comes to appreciate the slow-place of the club, as well as its members. While growing accustomed to this, she still maintains her seriousness and passion, quite-like Mio, which is a very admirable quality.\n\n7. Nodoka Manabe\n\nNodoka is a loveable little bookworm. Her mature and responsible demeanor forms a yin to Yui's air-headed antics. Nodoka is practically an archetype of the intelligent, industrious and dutiful student who always excels in her academics and is involved with the Student Council. It's pretty much only through her reminders that the Light Music club remains in good-standing within the school, something which Ritsu Is surely thankful for! Nodoka strikes a perfect balance between pushing airheads like Yui and Ritsu to be responsible, while also understanding that there's a lot of good that comes from their care-free nature.\n\n6. Ui Hirasawa\n\nWhen your parents named your big sister Yui while naming you, simply, 'ui', it might feel like you got the short end of the stick. However, Ui totally shines as a little sister and often is more mature and responsible than her beloved onee-chan, Yui. Ui Hirasawa is simply always there for her big sister, in a way that's totally endearing and make her one of the most lovable characters in the show. Probably one o the best moments in all of K-On! Is when Yui and the rest of Hokago Tea Time unveil the song that Yui had written about her little sister. Ui isn't just an extension of Yui, but the two have such a beautiful relationship and they both gain so much from each other as sisters.\n\n[ad_middle]\n\n5. Tsumugi Kotobuki\n\nTsumugi Kotobuki, affectionately called 'mugi', is everyone's favorite rich girl. She often acts like a typical Ojou-chan, carrying herself in a very proper and well behaved manor. However, Tsumugi is much more than just her pampered upbringing. She has an curiosity that borders on awkward because her upbringing has come with a whole host of different social cues that the rest of the cast don't share. However, these moments come off more adorable than anything. Mugi has a lot of weird quirks like very above average physical strength, as well as a propensity to assume slightly intimate or lewd implications from everyday interactions.\n\n4. Ritsu Tainaka\n\nRitsu can be as air-headed as Yui but she's a hugely important piece of the light music club. Her comical and fun personality drive a lot of the good times between the club and her gags seem to always hit home. Often times Mio is the only one not laughing but she probably appreciates Ritsu the most since the pair are childhood friends. In fact, her relationship with Mio is one of her cutest points. Ritsu can look very independent and almost tomboyish at time but she gets fiercely jealous whenever she feels Mio is ignoring her in favor of someone else. Ritsu holds her friends close and none more so than Mio. She may be a little crazy at times but in the end Ritsu is reliable and good-natured and is one the best characters in the show.\n\n3. Sawako Yamanaka\n\nI strongly feel that Sawako is like an older Yui who's managed to get it together somewhat. However, this veil of maturity can come crashing down at any moment. Sawako holds the air of a responsible teacher, but can still understand where here students are coming from emotionally partially because she still a little kid at heart. Her high schol life was just as rambunctious as Yui's, only she grew up perhaps in a more extreme era, leading her to start a heavy metal band in place of the more whimsical and moe rock of the light music club. She has strong memories of those days and still can get as wild as she was back then, in addition to her new found love of costume making for the band. Sawako is still very earnest despite all the different hats she wears, and is loved universally for it. This is why she has the highest spot of all the non-main characters on this list.\n\n[sourceLink asin=\"B002B9TSKG\" asin_jp=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\n\n2. Yui Hirasawa\n\nAh, Yui. Yui is an phenomenal character and I question anyone to look at her character arc and tell me that K-on! Is a show where 'nothing happens.' Yui is completely off the charts in terms of absent-mindedness, her high school life would probably be in a ditch if not for her friends being so observant and helpful. But as to why they are friends with her in the first place, I think the answer is that Yui is just incredibly unique in how genuine and good-willed she is as a person. There's no harm that Yui could wish on anyone, I think. She has such a good and pure heart and in the end she worries probably more about other people than herself. Yui is the emotional core of the show, and one of the most lovable characters by far.\n\n[sourceLink asin=\"B00276HPFI\" asin_jp=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\n\n1. Mio Akiyama\n\nMio is completely adorable for a number of ways, but fundamentally so in how her quiet and composed demeanor are actually only one part of her personality. Opposite to those traits, Mio is a scaredy-cat, shy and also more rambunctious than she lets on, at least with certain people. When it comes to Ritsu's antics Mio is always quick to playfully whack her. Despite this, Mio is really beautiful inside and out. She looks like a stereotypical Yamato Nadeshiko and has attracted a school-wide fan club. Mio Is probably the most driven and intelligent of the group, and she's often the brains of the operation. She's great on bass and also writes a majority of the band's lyrics. Despite being more reserved, she still shares the sweetness and genuine good-heart of all light music members.\n\n[sourceLink asin=\"B00276HPFS\" asin_jp=\"\" text=\"\" url=\"\" ]\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nK-On! Always warmed my heart and if you haven't seen it, you definitely need to give it a shot. I hope all of the fans can appreciate the list and let us know what your version of the rankings would look like. Be sure to comment in the sections below and discuss who your favorites are and why!\n\n[author author_id=\"002\" author=\"\" translator_id=\"\"] [ad_bottom class=\"mt40\"] [recommendedPost post_id='20500' url='' title='' img='' class='' widget_title=''] [recommendedPost post_id='15916' url='' title='' img='' class='' widget_title='']\n\n↧\n\nMusic Anime Summer 2016 - Get Ready for Idols!\n\n[ad_top1 class=\"mb40\"]\n\n[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" text=\"Dengeki G's magazine may 2016\" url=\"\" ]\n\nWe’re entering a new anime season of the year!

Show By Rock!! Short!!\n\n[sourceLink asin=\"\" asin_jp=\"\" text=\"Official Website\" url=\"http://showbyrock-anime.com/\" ]\n\n[Information episodes=\" TBA \" aired=\" July 2016 \"]\n\nThe widely popular anime, Show by Rock!!, which aired last year, following the original storyline of the original rhythm game, would have a short anime series this summer! This should be enough to tide off our thirst for the second season of Show by Rock!!. The short anime series would have the original staff and cast returning, apparently aiming to be a “carefree and enjoyable” series before the sequel comes. BONES will be handling the animation, and the key visual available is looking exceptional already. There will be a new PV every month featuring bands that would appear in the second season, and the shorts anime series itself would feature the bands from the original series, including Plasmagica and ShinganCrimsonz. Show by Rock!! is originally a rhythm game by Geechs, featuring Sanrio’s first project for older males and young adults. The game itself featured over twenty bands, though the anime that aired last year only included at least five of them. The anime followed the plot of the original rhythm game, with Hijirikawa Cyan of Plasmagica as its main character, a shy girl who is talented in music, and just happened to have the luck of getting sucked into the world of game she is playing and ends up joining Plasmagica in Midi City. The cast of Show by Rock!! will be returning for Show by Rock!! Short!!, which means Inagawa Eri, Uesaka Sumire, Numakura Manami, and Sakura Ayane are coming back as Plasmagica together! Among the cast returning also included Hayami Saori, Kayano Ai, Miyano Mamoru, Taniyama Kishow, Uchiyama Kouki, Han Megumi, and Ohsaka Ryouta. Looks like Short!! is at least going to provide us some excitement and good music before the sequel.\n\n3.
