        "text": "Seiyuu Award Winners for 2012 Announced\n\nHere are the main winners from the seventh annual Seiyuu Awards ceremony, which was held Saturday evening in Tokyo:\n\nLeading man: Leading lady:\n\nKaji Yuuki Asumi Kana\n\nSupporting men:\n\nOno Yuuki Suwabe Junichi\n\nSupporting women:\n\nOohara Sayaka Tomatsu Haruka\n\nNewcomer men:\n\nShimazaki Nobunaga Yamamoto Kazutomi\n\nNewcomer women:\n\nIshihara Kaori Ookubo Rumi\n\nI'm fairly happy with the selections. Asumi Kana and Kaji Yuuki are both good seiyuus. Oohara Sayaka is one of the best, and Tomacchan getting better and better.\n\nSuwabe Junichi is one of my absolute favorite male seiyuus.\n\nIshihara Kaori is one of my favorite female seiyuus, and Ookubo Rumi, while not at the top of the craft, did very well in YuruYuri and Acchi Kocchi. I like her more for herself than for her performances, but that's okay.\n\nI must admit, however, that Carrie (Ishihara Kaori) is the only one of these whom I voted for myself.\n\nFull results on Anime News Network. Kamiya Hiroshi won the award for most votes for all awards. The singing award went to Asumi Kana, Matsuki Miyu and Ootsubo Yuka for their work for Haiyore! Nyaruko-san.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSeiyuu Video: Akasaki Chinatsu and Kayano Ai (OreShura)\n\nHere's a nice little publicity show for OreShura (Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi Shuraba Sugiru). It features seiyuus Akasaki Chinatsu (left) and Kayano Ai (right), who play Chiwa and Ai, respectively.\n\nI love the gentle tone, so natural to Kayanon of the Healing Voice. And it's nice to get such a good look at Akasaki-san, who has followed up her outstanding performance as Nibutani Shinka in Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai with good work in this show.\n\nHere's the second half of the show:\n\nBoth videos are a bit better seen on the NicoNico site itself. Just click on the video to see it on that site (if you have an account, or watch it here if you don't).\n\nComments suggest that Kayanon has lost weight. That she is wonderful. And that she is cuuute. She and Akasaki are supposedly friendly off-screen, too. I like it that Akasaki refers to her as \"Kayano-kun,\" suggesting a schoolmate/workmate sort of attitude. Kayanon calls her \"Chinatsu-chan.\"\n\nI believe this is a live broadcast of the weekly OreShura radio show. They are a bit disconcerted to find the makings for shabu-shabu on their work desk, but reconcile to it because there is meat involved.\n\n↧\n\nYuuki Aoi and Taketatsu Ayana Form New Singing Duo \"petit milady\"\n\nAmazing news breaks this afternoon that Yuuki Aoi and Taketatsu Ayana are forming a new singing duo called \"petit milady,\" or \"puchi mire\" for short.\n\nThe name means \"little milady\" in French/English, and is pretty appropriate for the pair: Ao--chan (left) is 4'9\" (145cm) all, and Ayachi is 4'11\" (151cm).\n\nThe announcement was apparently made on a big video screen in Akihabara. A movie announced: \"The birth of a new unit with two seiyuus no-one would ever have imagined.\"\n\nIn the video, Ayachi says she was nervous when they told her she was going to form a new singing duo with someone. But when she heard it was Ao-chan, she became completely at ease.\n\nTheir first single will be a new Yu-Gi-Oh Zexal II OP, to debut on the April 14 broadcast. No indication that either of them will do voice roles there, but it remains possible.\n\nAo-chan is just about to turn 21. Ayanyan is 23. Ao-chan is with the Pro-Fit seiyuu agency and her albums have come out on Flying Dog records (Japan Victor). Ayachi is with Pro-Fit's acting agency Assemble Heart, to which she moved from the big I\"m Enterprise agency last April. Her music has come out on Pony Canyon. This new single will come out on Universal Music's anime label Zero-A.\n\nAo-chan is a natural seiyuu with tremendous vocal power and invention (sometimes too much invention). She never went to seiyuu school, having started as a child TV performer and actress. Ayachi went to a big seiyuu school and, while not really a great seiyuu, has a knack for creating popular characters. She started in 2005 as one of the lustful sisters in KissxSis and her top roles are Azunyan in K-On and Kirino in OreImo (of which a new series starts in April).\n\nWhy are they getting (being put) together? Perhaps it's just the normal constant movement of the Japanese entertainment industry. Perhaps it's because neither one of them is good enough, or popular enough, on their own to sustain a recording career. I myself think that with the right music and production (e.g., her songs by DEKO*27) Ao-chan is terrific, but others may well not agree.\n\nAnyway, I'm looking forward to this.\n\nEDIT: I found a pic of the big screen, which ad apparently been teasing viewers in Akihabara before the announcement was made:\n\nThe words are: \"A new unit (i.e., singing group) is born.\"\n\n↧\n\nSpring 2013 Anime Previews: staff, cast, story, trailer, pic, etc.\n\nThis is the season of science fiction. There are seven shows with something sci-fi about them, from a remake of the Space Battleship Yamato series to three mecha shows to a kids' show and a harem romance.\n\nBut in this well-populated spring season, we have other genres, too: action fantasy, ecchi comedy, psychological drama, reverse harem....\n\nHere are brief descriptions of 20 shows of interest, followed by full details on all 42 shows:\n\nAku no Hana– Psychological drama involving a guy who steals a girl’s gym uniform. Another girl sees him do it, and uses that to control him. By the director of Mushishi.\n\nArata Kangatari – Time travel, body transference, and a bit of skin, from a shounen manga adapted by the director of Shugo Chara and the writer of Pandora Hearts, and starring the voice of Kirito in SAO.\n\nDansai Bunri no Crime Edge– Mystery romance about a girl whose hair no scissors can cut, and the boy whose scissors cut it.\n\nDate a Live– Science fiction with romance and comedy, starring Inoue Marina and directed by Motonaga Keitarou (Jormungand, Tayutama, School Days).\n\nDevil Survivor 2 The Animation– Action fantasy from an RPG, but with an overwhelming cast: Kamiya Hiroshi, Okamoto Nobuhiko, Suwabe Junichi, Sawashiro Miyuki, Iguchi Yuka, Koshimizu Ami, Asumi Kana, etc., etc.\n\nGinga Kikoutai Majestic Prince– Motonaga Keitarou and Yoshida Reiko (Marimite, K-On) give us a sci-fi adventure comedy in which genetically altered teens save the human race.\n\nHentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko– Ecchi romantic comedy starring Ogura Yui, Kaji Yuuki, Ishihara Kaori, Tamura Yukari.\n\nHyakka Ryouran: Samurai Bride– Another round of the odd supernatural/samurai action breast comedy starring Yuuki Aoi, Kugimiya Rie, Kobayashi Yuu, Kotobuki Minako.\n\nKarneval (2013)– The director of Kodomo no Jikan and the writer of Amnesia try to guide seiyuus such as Kamiya Hiroshi, Satou Satomi, and Ono Daisuke through an adaptation of a josei fantasy manga.\n\nNamiuchigiwa no Muromi-san– Crazy comedy with drunken mermaid Tamura Yukari. Directed by the director of the good recent OVA Aruvu Rezuru, adapted by the writer of Ben-tou.\n\nOre no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai – A new season of the tremendously popular ecchi comedy with proud blonde imouto Taketatsu Ayana and sarcastic cat girl Hanazawa Kana.\n\nPhoto Kano– A dating-sim-based harem romance like KimiKiss and AmagamiSS. A boy with a camera takes photographs of various girls....\n\nRDG: Red Data Girl– PA Works (True Tears, Hanasaku Iroha) animates a best-selling fantasy novel to celebrate Kadokawa Bunko’s 65th anniversary. Stars Hayami Saori in one of her three leading roles this season.\n\nShingeki no Kyojin– Science fiction horror from the director of Death Note and the writer of the new JoJo. Stars Inoue Marina.\n\nSpace Battleship Yamato 2199– This remake of the classic sci-fi series was in theatres last year; BDs have come out for some of it; and a series hits television in April. Episode one looked good to me.\n\nSuisei no Gargantia– Mecha pilot space/time-warps to a backward planet he cannot get off. Written by Urobuchi Gen. With the tiny perfect voices of both Kanemoto Hisako and Kayano Ai.\n\nTo Aru Kagaku no Railgun S– Ah, Biri-biri. New season of the school adventure-comedy involving students with superpowers.\n\nValvrave the Liberator– Mecha science fiction from the director of Kurenai and the writer of Code Geass, starring Seto Asami, Tomatsu Haruka, Kayano Ai, Ousaka Ryouta, Kimura Ryouhei. Ao-chan in the cast.\n\nYahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru– School romantic comedy starring Hayami Saori. Yuuki Aoi, Sasaki Nozomi, with Koshimizu Ami also in the cast.\n\nZettai Bouei Leviathan– Hayami Saori in her third big role of the season, with Kitamura Eri, Taketatsu Ayana, and Hanazawa Kana in a fantasy adventure with lots of elf ears.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other shows that could be of interest to people. A new season of the extraterrestrial comedy Haiyore! Nyaru-ani. A super-deformed Hokuto no Ken. A comic retelling of Glass Mask with Maya and others as hoodlums. A new season of Hayate. A show in which the characters all personify different bloodtypes. A samurai adventure from the director of Prince of Tennis and Library War. A new season of Uta no Prince-sama. A couple of slice-of-life comedies.\n\nI don't see any masterpieces here, just lots of watchable shows.

In 2199, a war with a techologically superior alien race has rendered the Earth uninhabitable. Survivors live underground. Our heroes learn of a friendly alien race which is willing to give humans the technology to defeat their enemies -- if only they can come to their very distant world and get it. They provide plans for a faster-than-light ship and the Yamato is built. We follow its crew on their difficult journey to get technology that can save the human race.\n\nDirected and written by multitalented designer/writer Izubuchi Yutaka, who created and directed RahXephon.

At the statue, Youto encounters Tsukiko, a girl from his high school with her own wish: that she become less childish and not display her feelings so openly.\n\nThis is Ogura Yui's biggest role yet, and I think she has finally got the chops to succeed in it. Her voice work is now rising to match the level of her extreme cuteness. Her singing partner in YuiKaori, Ishihara Kaori, is also in the show.

Bring it on.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nTamura Yukari -- Idol and Seiyuu\n\nI decided to make Tamura Yukari 田村ゆかり my seiyuu for spring mainly because she's a highly popular seiyuu whom I haven't featured yet and who has three good roles in the coming anime season. I've always liked her voice work, in a lukewarm sort of way, but I've never taken her that seriously.\n\nBut now that I've seen more of her, in researching this post, I can understand the passionate support her fans give her. She's a charming person and a real entertainer.\n\nYukarin is one of 2channel's absolute favorites. On the Japanese discussion board, her thread is enormous: over 800,000 posts. Among seiyuus, this is second only to Mizuki Nana (who has just over a million posts), and well ahead of Horie Yui and Hirano Aya, who each have around 500,000. I hasten to add that Aya's thread is now full of negative posts, unlike Yukarin's, which is basically a love-fest.\n\nYukarin's most famous role is as Nanoha in Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha. Other well-known roles include Ichigo in Please Teacher, Kawasumi Mai in Kanon (both versions), Akazukin in Otogijushi Akazukin, Tenten in Naruto, Togame in Katanagatari, Yamada in B-gata H-kei, Kanako and Meruru in OreImo, Rika in Higurashi, and Masuzu in the recently completed OreShura. This season, she will be the mermaid Muromi-san in Namiuchigawa no Muromi-san, and Wakatsuki-sensei in Aiura, as well as reprising her role(s) in OreImo.\n\nHer list of works on Japanese Wikipedia is huge: anime, music, games, concerts, TV appearances, radio, and even planetarium narration. If any seiyuu is making a good living, it must be Yukarin.\n\nYukari-hime was born 27 February 1976 and grew up in Fukuoka, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. In elementary school, she admired Fukuoka-born idol Matsuda Seiko and the idol/magical girl anime Magical Angel Creamy Mami, and decided she wanted to become an idol. At the same time, her friends made fun of her high voice, so she started to learn how to make her voice sound lower.\n\nIn middle school, she joined both the choir and the drama club. In high school, she was in the drama club and the manga research club. She went to a commerce-oriented high school, where she gained qualifications in abacus, book-keeping, insurance, and other subjects.\n\nAfter graduation, she went to work in a company, but at the same time took courses at the Yoyogi Animation branch school in Fukuoka. She got a position as an assistant on a local late-night radio show, but no real seiyuu roles. So she quit her job, packed up, moved to Tokyo and became a student at the big Nihon Narration seiyuu school.\n\nShe got her first role at about 19, as a waitress in a PC game on which one of her teachers was the sound director. She got very few seiyuu roles at first, and did more singing. She had little money and lived a hard life.\n\nIn 1996, she became a regular on a radio top hits show. In 1999, the show put Yukarin and Horie Yui together as a singing unit called Yamato Nadeshiko. This helped make both of them popular idols. Later, some fans said they were actually a couple. This seems to have been based mainly on Hocchan saying later that they had once walked around their hotel room naked.\n\nYukarin's singing career was making progress. She put out her first single in 1997. In 1999, she issued four singles. None of these sold enough to enter the charts, however.\n\nBut starting in 2002, she crept up above 100th place, and slowly made her way up to the top ten, which she reached in 2005, with Spiritual Garden. Since then, almost all her songs have been in the top ten, as high as #4. She has had a total of 27 singles, of which ten have reached the top ten.\n\nHer anime work was continuing to grow. From 1998 on, she had several roles a year, in addition to an even larger number of voice roles in games.\n\nMost of you may have an idea of her seiyuu work. But her true popularity comes from her work as an idol, and the relationship she creates with her fans. Here are a couple of videos that opened my eyes. First, from 2001, a live event in support of the release of her first album:\n\nNext, I believe from last year (ten years later!), a clip from a concert on a grander scale, showing just how well she and her fans work together:\n\nShe has the knack of seeming relaxed and intimate even in the midst of a grand performance. She presents herself as ditzy and vague, but is somehow able to twist huge crowds around her little finger. There is more to her than she lets on.\n\nAnd here is a clip entitled \"Tamura Yukari destroys the human race.\" She tells the audience that her magic wand will make them all fall madly in love with her. After she uses it once, they all chant \"again, again\" and she obliges, with devastating results:\n\nOne of the things that makes her such a favorite is how closely she corresponds to the otaku notion of an ideal female: cute, sexy, and obliging. As I say, I think there is more to her than this public image, but she wears the image seamlessly.\n\nTo get an idea of what she is like in a calmer setting, here are three videos: an interview about an early role (2001), some clips from what appears to be an internet TV show, and finally a \"making of\" video for the PV for her 2008 single Bambino, Bambina:\n\nThere's something that I have never heard anyone mention, but that has always struck me: she's actually pretty funny-looking. Huge ears, low forehead, strong features, very broad cheeks. But I've learned from seeing these and other videos that all that is beside the point: she moves gracefully and conveys charm and femininity with her every move. Now that we know that, here are more photos:\n\nFinally, we reach her actual seiyuu roles. Here are pics of a few of her characters (mouseover for names):\n\nAnd here are a couple of videos giving us a taste of her seiyuu voice. First, a compendium of voices she has used playing Nanoha:\n\nNext, a scene from Kanon:\n\nFinally, two more videos: first, \"An Angel's Day Off,\" showing Yukarin wandering around Paris:\n\nAnd here is the music video for her most recent single:\n\nRather than trying to type out a complete list of her work, I'm going to link you to Wikipedia, which has a good, if incomplete, list of her anime, game, and musical work. For a complete list, I'm afraid I have to send you to Japanese Wikipedia. There are just too many roles and CDs and events for a blog post. Anime News Network has a fairly complete list of her anime work.\n\nFor more pics of Yukarin, check here or here. For more videos, search YouTube on her name in Japanese: 田村ゆかり\n\n↧\n\nCharacter/seiyuu pages: Red Data Girl, Crime Edge, Gargantia, Yuyushiki\n\nI've done character/seiyuu pages for four spring shows so far: RDG: Red Data Girl, Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge, Suisei no Gargantia, and Yuyushiki.\n\nThe pages show images of characters and their seiyuus, with some info about each seiyuu.\n\nSo far, Suisei no Gargantia is my favorite show of the season. Red Data Girl is a close second. Kanemoto Hisako in Gargantia and Hayami Saori in RDG are both giving fascinating performances.\n\nI'm also enjoying Shingeki no Kyojin (\"Attacking Giants\"), which is almost too heavy for me. As anime, it may be the bet show of the season. Aku no Hana is another excellent show, but it is so dark that I can't actually bear to watch it.\n\nCrime Edge is weird but enjoyable, and former gravure idol Koiwai Kotori has a voice that suits the character. Yuyushiki is another little comedy show featuring cute girls doing cute things, but the off-kilter humour pleases me.\n\nI'm also enjoying Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru, in part for another excellent performance from Hayami Saori. She may be putting herself in line for a seiyuu award this year.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Yuuki Aoi, but even I can't sit through the stupidity of Hyakka Ryouran Samurai Bride just to hear her voice.\n\n↧\n\nSeiyuu Video: Yuuki Aoi in Valvrave -- the most Amazing \"Arigatou\" Ever?\n\nI haven't been watching Kakumeiki Valvrave. Sunrise mecha shows are not usually my thing. But on NicoNico someone has posted a four-second clip from episode 8 of Yuuki Aoi's character Renboukouji Akira saying arigatou (\"thank you\"):\n\nI find this amazingly effective. Others may find it ridiculous. But in any case I can't imagine anyone other than Ao-chan having the daring invention and vocal skill to say the line this way.\n\nIn the scene, she has been tied up and kept out of commission for a while, and the girl she is speaking with has just come and untied her.

Summer is usually a down season, but there are 37 new series starting this summer, and almost all of them hold some promise. I'll quickly mention some shows first, then go on to detailed info about all the shows.\n\nI've been able to whittle down the list to six that I am most looking forward to…but there are another 12 that deserve special attention, too. First my six most anticipated shows:\n\nMonogatari Series: Second Season– I’m one of the people who thinks of Shinbou as a genius and Bakemonogatari as a masterpiece, so I’m more than eager to see this continuation of the story.\n\nKingdom 2– Underrated partly because of its unique style, this rip-roaring tale of the time of the First Emperor of China grabbed me from the start and has not let go.\n\nUchouten Kazoku– PA Works animates an award-winning novel (not a \"light\" novel) by the author of Tatami Galaxy, set in a magical version of Kyouto.\n\nWatashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui! – A dark comedy from Oonuma Shin featuring a teen girl who spends all her time dating guys in games and is surprised to discover that in real life, she has become a creepy hikikomori.\n\nRozen Maiden (2013)– A revival of the mid-2000s franchise, with the same great cast, but now written by Mochizuki Tomomi (YKK, Touka Gettan, Zettai Shounen).

Classic reverse harem with a good male cast.\n\nDanganronpa The Animation– The staff that made Humanity Has Declined puts fifteen bright teens in a school where they can only graduate by killing or being killed.\n\nFantasista Doll– The director of Bamboo Blade and Haganai, and the writer of Ebiten, give us a story involving cute magical fighting dolls, with a cast of young stars including Uesaka Sumire (Dekomori in Chuunibyou), Akasaki Chinatsu (Nibutani), and Misawa Sachika (Kuroyukihime in Accel World).\n\nFate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya – Oonuma Shin directs a strange Fate/Stay Night spinoff in which Illya is a magical girl attending high school.\n\nFree!– Kyoto Animation has elicited plenty of griping from its core fans by presenting this story centred on a boys' high school swim team. Fujoshi buying power, lol.\n\nGatchaman Crowds– Uchida Maaya (Rikka in Chuunibyou) stars in a remake of the old fighting series, remade by the staff that did Tsuritama.\n\nGifuu Doudou!!

Starring Toyosaki Aki and Namikawa Daisuke, and written by Konparu Tomoko (Nadja, NANA, Nodame Cantabile).\n\nKimi no Iru Machi – From a popular shounen romance manga by the author of Suzuka. Adapted by the writer of Marimite and K-On, directed by the director of Casshern Sins.\n\nKitakubu Katsudou Kiroku– Talented mid-teen seiyuu Kido Ibuki gets another starring role, in a moe slice-of-life anime.\n\nLove Lab– Seiyuu Akasaki Chinatsu (Nibutani in Chuunibyou) stars in a seinen/josei comedy about girls practicing for love, made by the staff than made Mitsudomoe and YuruYuri.\n\nMakai Ouji: Devils and Realist – Kon Chiaki and Yokote Michiko bring us a story about demons and a beautiful young man.\n\nRou Kyuu Bu!

A new director for this new season seems to have changed the approach somewhat. New director Iwanagi Akira directed Letter Bee. There's also a new Art Director, Kim Hyun-suk. (The name is Korean.)

He goes on to live with the sadistic girl Kirihime, who uses scissors as a weapon. Scissors again! As in Dansai Bunri. The story is weird enough to be interesting.\n\nThe names in the cast are very interesting: Sakurai Takahiro, Inoue Marina, Itou Shizuka, Uchida Maaya, Saitou Chiwa, et al.

Lead writer Ayana Yuniko did two shows that worked for me: Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko, and the OVA Hori-san to Miyamura-kun.\n\nMixed cast seems a bit promising, including Nishi Asuka, Taneda Risa, Touyama Nao, Tamura Yukari and Satou Satomi. The manga is amusing. For some reason, I have hopes for this minor show. Maybe because it reminds me of a similar show from the same studio: A Channel.\n\nFate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya\n\n(jp: Fate/kaleid liner プリズマ☆イリヤ) jpWiki\n\nmagical girl fantasy adventure school comedy\n\ndirector: Oonuma Shin (ef, Baka to Test), Sakamoto Takashi (cdir)\n\nwriter: Inoue Kenji (Baka to Test novel).

Illyasviel von Einzbern is a Master of the 5th Holy Grail War. But in this alternate reality, she lives a radically different life as a normal school girl…who is also the magical girl Prisma Illya.\n\nThe cast is led by solid pros: Kadowaki Mai (in her second leading role of the season), Nazuka Kaori, Ueda Kana, Itou Shizuka, Matsuki Miyu, Katou Emiri, Satou Satomi, Itou Kanae. Itou Miki (Sachiko in Marimite) makes one of her rare recent appearances.\n\nDirected by Oonuma Shin, with an assistant, and written by Inoue Kenji. Inoue wrote the Baka to Test novel and manga, but has not done anime series composition before. I'm not a fan of the Fate/ franchise, but I will look at anything made by Oonuma Shin, hoping for a return to the form of the ef shows. The rather bright look of the trailer makes me think some fans of the franchise may find this a little denatured.\n\nOP by ChouCho, one of my absolute favorite anime singers since her first OP for Hyouka.

Girls are chosen to wield the Elemental Tarot in secret battles.\n\nIt's good to see Kadowaki Mai doing more and more all-ages anime, to go with the ero-games she has been specializing in for the past few years. Kitamura Eri and Tokui Sora also play major characters. Solid staff for a moe magical girl show. Good-looking trailer.

I'm especially looking forward to that last one (\"Love Tale\").\n\nThe same fantastic cast returns.
