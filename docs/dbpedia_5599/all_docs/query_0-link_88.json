This changes, however, after she encounters and falls in love with Hiwatari Seiji of SHIPS, a popular idol group. In order to be with him, she aspires to be an idol.\n\nWith the help of SHIPS - the gentle Seiji and the bad-mouth Kazama Hiroto - as well as her cat mascot Naa-san, her family and her friends, Kirari pursues the world of idols, where she discovers that being popular is not all fun and games, and that in order to persevere in both her love and her career, she must endure and overcome many hardships and challenges."
