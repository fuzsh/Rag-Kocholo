        "text": "Readers paying close attention to IGNPS3's coverage of the PS3 launch last week may have noted that IGN Japan did indeed succeed in its quest to obtain Japanese PS3 units. We even celebrated correspondent Andrew Alfonso's birthday in the process and managed to get filmed for a weekly Japanese television show. Read all about the fun and drama over at IGNPS3.\n\nSo, the third version of Japan's favorite gaming hardware is at last out. To be honest, aside from a Saturday filled with news reports of panicked lines, Mr. Tarou Tanaka is probably none-the-wiser. Based on the numbers alone, the PS3 didn't really make too much of a splash. In fact, the best selling system for the week of the PS3's release was the DS Lite. Looking at the sales charts a few pages down, and you'll see that DS games occupied 8 out of 10 slots!\n\nAs we reported at IGNPS3, Sony's hardware sell-out didn't translate to a software sell-out. Bandai Namco's Ridge Racer 7 and Gundam: Target in Sight managed to just squeeze past the 30,000 units mark, contributing to the 0.98 software to hardware sales ratio (about 0.3 less than the PS2 and PSP ratios). We've heard, unofficially, that Sega Golf Club only old 1,500 copies, putting it right up there with Xbox 360 software.\n\nWhether or not things pick up before the end of the year will depend on a few things. First, hardware supply. Sony insists that it will have a million units in Japan by the end of the year. That's a pretty bold promise considering that, officially at least, 100,000 units were available at launch. A local Bic Camera did receive a new shipment earlier this week, but was sold out by the time we showed up eager for Yahoo Auction profits.\n\nThe second factor is software. Even if Sony does have a million units at retail by the end of the year, we're not sure why anyone would be buying them at this point. Konami and Koei have followed up the five strong launch lineup with two mahjong games. And that's it for November! December has Armored Core 4, Sonic and a bunch of western titles. Not the most exciting of lineups, even if Gran Turismo HD manages to make it out (the racer still doesn't have its release date finalized).\n\nThings are even worse when you connect to the PlayStation store. Since launch, only a handful of content has been available, with gameplay limited to Mainichi Issyo, Blast Factor and a Ridge Racer 7 demo. Sony was sure to get a large selection of demos ready for the US launch, but these haven't crossed the Pacific yet.\n\nThere have been some signs of improvement, though. Recently, Sony kicked off its PS3 to PSP download service, offering full PlayStation games at a mere 5 bucks (see IGNPS3 for details). Just as importantly, Sony finally got around to shipping actual PS3 branded cables, a full week after the system's launch.\n\nPerhaps Sony is keeping quiet due to some sort of Japanese-style corporate respect thing as one of its main competitors launches its own system. For a look at what will hopefully be less a catastrophe of a launch, turn the page.\n\nWII LAUNCH WATCH\n\nPre-order sellouts within minutes, lack of pre-orders at major retailers, long lines expected on launch day -- the Wii launch is starting to look like the PS3 launch. Except for one important fact. IGN Japan has already secured a system, so there'll be no need to wait in line this time!\n\nBut if you haven't pre-ordered already, you're probably in trouble. Although Nintendo will be getting around 400,000 Wii units to Japanese retail for the 12/2 launch, based on the sell-out messages posted at Amazon.com, 7-11 and even \"real\" retailers, and the fact that the DS sold about 70,000 units more than that at its far quieter launch, and the supply may just not be enough.\n\nWith the Wii, the hardware isn't the only thing that's selling. Some retailers have stopped taking pre-orders for popular software and peripherals like Zelda, Wii Sports, Hajimete no Wii and the 5000 yen point card. The two latter items are include, respectively, a spare Wiimote and a classic controller, making them awesome deals.\n\nUnlike the PS3's launch, which suffered a hardware-software tie-in of 0.98 (that is, 0.98 games were sold for every PS3 system), we expect a high tie-in rate for the Wii. Nintendo and its third parties have a couple of big advantages over Sony: an unquestioned killer app from day one in the form of Zelda Twilight Princess, and a long list of titles covering a wide range of gaming interests.\n\nHere's what will be available on day one:\n\nNecro Nesia (Spike): 8,7,6,7\n\nSuper Monkey Ball (Sega): 8,8,8,7\n\nWing Island (Hudson): 5,6,6,5\n\nKororinpa (Hudson): 6,6,6,6\n\nSD Gundam Scud Hammers (Banpresto): 8,8,9,8\n\nEnnichi no Tatsujin (Bandai Namco): 7,7,7,6\n\nTamagotchi no Pika Pika Daitouryou (Bandai Namco): 7,7,7,5\n\nRed Steel (Ubisoft): 8,9,9,8\n\nTrauma Center (Atlus): 8,9,8,7\n\nElebits (Konami): 8,8,8,8\n\nSwing Golf Pangya (Tecmo): 8,7,7,7\n\nOdoru Made in Wario (Nintendo): 8,9,8,9\n\nZelda Twilight Princess (Nintendo): 9,10,9,10\n\nCrayon Shin Chan (Banpresto)\n\nHajimete no Wii (Nintendo)\n\nWii Sports (Nintendo)\n\nA surprising number of these games don't suck. Famitsu recently reviewed most of the launch titles, painting a favorable picture for most, although there do seem to be a few stinkers in the lineup. The Famitsu scores are included next to each title.\n\nBe sure and also check out our release list at the end of this week's Gaming Life for an up-to-date list of what's set for release following the launch flood.\n\nRemember Nintendo's impressive promotional campaign for the DS back in 2004? The one with Utada Hikaru's face plastered all over the place? There's no celebrity endorsement this time, but Nintendo has started putting up some serious signage.\n\nThat's the scene outside the Parco department store in Shibuya. Nintendo had a similar display for the DS in 2004, only it also showcased playable units. We'll have to see if Nintendo is bold enough to show off the Wii in this outdoors environment.\n\nThe Wii has also been flooding the airwaves. The latest television commercials at last bring the focus to specific games, including, most prominently, Wii Sports and Hajimete no Wii. Wii Sports seems to be the most heavily advertised game in Japan right now, aside from maybe Nintendo's own Jump Ultimate Stars for the DS.\n\nWii Sports\n\nBaseball\n\nNintendo, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nQUICKTIME (6051KB)\n\nWMV (4278KB)\n\nWii Sports\n\nTennis\n\nNintendo, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nQUICKTIME (6015KB)\n\nWMV (4278KB)\n\nWii Sports\n\nGolf\n\nNintendo, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nQUICKTIME (6024KB)\n\nWMV (4356KB)\n\nHajimete no Wii\n\nNintendo, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nQUICKTIME (6061KB)\n\nWMV (4364KB)\n\nThese seem to be follow-ups to Nintendo's initial teaser campaign, and they showcase families and friends having fun with the system. But the Wii does have traditional commercial spots as well, both from Nintendo and third parties. Here's a look.\n\nBleach Wii\n\nSega, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.14.06\n\nQUICKTIME (6110KB)\n\nWMV (4325KB)\n\nCrayon Shin Chan\n\nBanpresto, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nQUICKTIME (6086KB)\n\nWMV (4380KB)\n\nSwing Golf\n\nPangya\n\nTecmo, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nQUICKTIME (6026KB)\n\nWMV (3497KB)\n\nLegend of Zelda\n\nTwilight Princess\n\nQUICKTIME (6054KB)\n\nWMV (4200KB)\n\nNintendo World\n\nWii Trial Event\n\nQUICKTIME (6054KB)\n\nWMV (4200KB)\n\nThat last spot is for the Nintendo World event, which stops off in Tokyo this weekend. Although the Wii's launch is only a week away, Nintendo hasn't given gamers a chance to try out the system outside of this event. We expect the train to the Makuhari Messe to be crowded as gamers attempt to get their first shot of Wii ahead of the 12/2 launch.\n\nTurn the page for a look at the latest Japanese game magazines.\n\nZASSHI JOUHOU GO!\n\nThis section of Gaming Life in Japan takes a look at what's big in the latest game magazines from Japan. From Famitsu to Dengeki to smaller publications like Dorimaga, Japan has lots of videogame magazines. While we tend to put up all the news and game info revealed in the magazines on the main pages of IGN, this section gives you a closer look just so you can be sure that you're not missing out on anything.\n\nBe sure and click on the covers of each magazine for larger versions. Print them out and hold them in your hand as you read!\n\nFAMITSU -- NO.937\n\nThe cover for this week's Famitsu has the theme of Bandai Namco's Tales of Destiny. Only a handful of people in Japan probably know that, though, as the PlayStation 2 remake pulled a Tempest and was delayed at the last minute beyond its 11/22 release date.\n\nThe big news this week is the PlayStation 3 11/11 Japanese launch. The magazine has five pages with pics of lines from throughout the island nation. There's no mention of Chinese scalpers, which was a bit disappointing, although we give points to the article for a single picture where you can see the backs of both IGN Japanese correspondents heads.\n\nZelda's completion was also celebrated in this issue, with a seven page feature on the Wii and GameCube title. Included is a spoilerific four page interview with director Eiji Aonuma. See IGN Wii for relevant points (minus the spoiler content).\n\nNew games making a debut this issue include Shinjuku Wolf (check out our preview at IGNPS2). Plus, a heavy dose of curiously named love sims, including Orange Company: I Love You and And Then Your Song that Lights up the Sky X X X (Kiss Kiss Kiss). No actual non-games announced this issue, although Hudson did add a couple of new games to its Puzzle Series. Is there really a need for a Sudoku 2?\n\nLots of reviews means lots of gaming next week.\n\nGAMESYSTEMPUBSCOREBokura no Taiyou DS Django&SabataNDSKonami9, 8, 8, 7Gotouchi Kentei DSNDSSpike8, 7, 7, 6Oshare Majo Love and Berry -- DS CollectionNDSSega8, 8, 7, 6J League Winning Eleven 10 Oushuu League '06-07PS2Konami9, 8, 8, 8K-1 World GP 2006PS2D3 Publisher6, 6, 6, 5Kohitsuji Hokaku Keikaku!

This section of Gaming Life in Japan brings you the latest charts for hardware, home software and arcade titles, along with a top thirty most wanted list.\n\nWe've sourced retail tracker Media Create for the software and hardware charts and game magazine Famitsu Weekly for the most wanted chart.\n\nWe'll also occasionally provide sales data from more specialist magazines in the weekly magazine recap section. Check out that area for looks at sales for titles on individual systems.\n\nBe sure and check back every week to find out what Japanese gamers are into!\n\nGAME-RANK-IN: 11.06.06 - 11.12.06\n\nDid the PS3 launch this week, or was it the DS? Despite the release of Sony's new system, the sales charts were topped by DS games -- and older titles at that! Ridge and Gundam appeared in 9th and 10th slots.\n\nDebuting outside of the top ten this week were:\n\n13. Resistance (SCE, PS3)\n\n21. Genji (SCE, PS3)\n\n29. Me de Unou wo Kitaeru DS Sokudokujutsu (Milestone, DS)\n\n39. Chao Manga School (TDK Core, DS)\n\n47. Black Jack (Sega, DS)\n\nWow... Sega Golf Club didn't even place in the top 50! Wonder how much Sega spent getting the Miyazaki siblings to sign on for the game.\n\nThe PS3 had a software hardware attach rate of 0.82, according to Media Create, down from the 1.21 of the PS2 and the 1.06 of the PSP.\n\nThis week's top 100 games sold a totla of 824,226 units, 75.78% of last week's total. Thirteen new games placed in the list, accounting for just 15.79% of sales.\n\n#SYSGAMEPUBRELEASESALES1NDSCommon Knowledge TrainingNintendo10.26.06102,2402NDSPocket Monsters DiamondPokemon09.28.0678,7443NDSHoshi no KirbyNintendo11.02.0677,9494NDSPocket Monsters PearlPokemon09.28.0665,5745NDSZaidan Hounin Nihon Kanji Nouryoku Kentei Kyoukai Kounin Koushiki Soft 200-man-nin no KankenIE Institute11.09.0633,9326NDSNew Super Mario BrothersNintendo05.25.0627,3617NDSMotto Nou wo Kitaeru Otona no DS TrainingNintendo12.29.0524,1668NDSWorld Soccer Winning Eleven DSKonami11.02.0623,6539PS3Ridge Racer 7Bandai Namco11.11.0621,65510PS3Gundam Target in SightBandai Namco11.11.0621,310\n\nPS2=PlayStation 2, GCN=GameCube, NDS=Nintendo DS\n\nPSP=PlayStation Portable, GBA=Game Boy Advance\n\nHARD-RANK-IN: 11.06.06 - 11.12.06\n\nTimes are tough for the DS, Game Boy Advance and Xbox platforms. By the way, Media Create reports a sell-through of 86.58% for the PS3. However, taking account of pre-orders that had yet to be claimed, this is apparently equivalent to a complete sell out.\n\n#MAKERSYSTEMTHIS WEEK1NintendoDS Lite148,1742Sony Computer\n\nEntertainmentPlayStation 381,6393Sony Computer\n\nEntertainmentPSP19,1234Sony Computer\n\nEntertainmentPlayStation 216,1575MicrosoftXbox 3603,8646NintendoGame Boy Advance SP1,3207NintendoGame Boy Micro1,2138NintendoGameCube4969NintendoDS27910NintendoGame Boy Advance129MicrosoftXbox3\n\nMOST WANTED\n\nWowza!

Send them to the IGN Japan mailbag.\n\nTurn the page for a look at what team IGN Japan is playing.\n\nInside IGN Japan\n\nThe night of the PS3 launch wasn't all that cold, so waiting overnight for a system wasn't too bad (although, the line at our nearby Tsutaya didn't close until 6:00am, so it turned out that we didn't really have to pull the whole 18 hour wait thing). The walk home at 7:00 in the morning as surprisingly severe rains began to pour was a different story.\n\nTemperatures have dropped in time for the Wii launch, and it's now cold enough that we wouldn't want to wait all night for a console. Thankfully, we won't have to! With our pre-orders already confirmed the only thing that could manage to draw the IGN Japan staff out into the cold are lines filled with bums and foreign exchange students.\n\nHere's what your IGN Japan editors are up to these days.\n\nAndrew\n\nI went to Osaka over the weekend for a short vacation and I was amazed by the fact that Osakans stand on the right side of the elevator instead of the left side like they do in Tokyo and Toronto. I was also surprised to see how many Akira and Wolf players there were in the Osaka arcades. One thing that doesn't surprise me, however, is the look of shock when I told my friends I was able to get not only one, but two PS3s!\n\nNOW PLAYING\n\nResistance (PS3)\n\nVirtua Fighter 5 (ARC)\n\nSmall Arms (X360)\n\n- MOST WANTED -\n\nThe Legend of Zelda:\n\nTwilight Princess\n\nNintendo, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nWario Ware: Smooth Moves\n\nNintendo, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nBlue Dragon\n\nMicrosoft, Xbox 360\n\nRelease: 12.07.06\n\nVirtua Fighter 5\n\nSega, PS3\n\nRelease: Spring '07\n\nDevil May Cry 4\n\nCapcom, PS3\n\nRelease: TBA\n\nAnoop\n\nThe one saving grace of the crappy PS3 launch lineup is that I was forced to do something inconceivable: play a first person shooter. As a result, the genre has a brand new fan. I can't get enough of Insomniac's launch title and look forward to killing more Chimera as soon as I finish writing this week's Gaming Life in Japan. I also can't wait to get my hands on Gears of War, which now replaces Lost Odyssey on my most wanted list thanks to that terrible demo Microsoft released a couple of weeks back.\n\nNOW PLAYING\n\nResistance (PS3)\n\nJeanne d'Arc (PSP)\n\n- MOST WANTED -\n\nThe Legend of Zelda:\n\nTwilight Princess\n\nNintendo, Wii\n\nRelease: 12.02.06\n\nBlue Dragon\n\nMicrosoft, Xbox 360\n\nRelease: 12.07.06\n\nGears of War\n\nMicrosoft, Xbox 360\n\nRelease: 01.25.07\n\nYakuza 2\n\nSega, PS2\n\nRelease: 12.07.06\n\nMotorstorm\n\nSony, PS3\n\nRelease: 12.14.06\n\nTurn the page for the latest release dates from Japan.\n\nRELEASE DATES\n\nThis section of Gaming Life in Japan provides you with an up-to-date release list of games coming out in Japan.

On this page, you'll find the new games that have some sort of date attached to them -- even if it's just something vague like TBA 2007.\n\nRecent changes, including new dates and prices, are bolded.
