        "text": "Sign up for the Costume Contest early! If you sign up on Friday, you’re much more likely to get an appointment for judging than if you wait until Saturday morning. To register, all you need is a printed reference photo for your costume - you won’t be able to register without it. Fan art is not an acceptable reference image, and hand-drawn reference images are only allowed for Original Design entrants. Groups are welcome, and you can print and fill out your entry form early by using the forms at www.awa-con.com. Just click “Events” and then “Costume Contest” for entry forms and rules.\n\nFor beautiful convention life! It's time to kick off another Anime Weekend Atlanta… help us start it off the right way during the star-studded kickoff extravaganza. Come meet some of our super cool guests and find out just what we have in store for you this year!\n\nThe AWA Dealers Room is where you can find and buy the latest from Japan and elsewhere. Scores of retailers from around the country will be attending.\n\nThe Dealers Room is located in Exhibit Halls C and D at Cobb Galleria Centre.\n\nStarting a Webcomic...and Beyond! Always wanted to create a webcomic, but don't know how to start? Never fear! Let WeGo4Kyo Cosplay -- creators of Con Season -- and Jennie Breeden -- creator of The Devil's Panties -- tell you their experiences in creating and launching a webcomic. We will be covering treacherous topics such as building websites, gaining an audience, and (of course) making better comics!\n\nThis is your chance to learn how to dance (or brush up on your skills!) before the ball. Our own Ball DJ and Dance Mistress, Miss Michiru, will lead you through several dance styles to get you ready for the big night.\n\nJoin the AWA Imperial Maids for coffee, tea, dessert and games in “The Gallery” (downstairs in the Mall across from Jock’s and Jill’s). Now, enjoy a new lower price with the same great service! Cost is $10 per person, which covers the cost of a drink and a dessert of your choice. Snack on pastries and treats from the accomplished ovens of the Galleria Convention Centre’s incredible chefs while you test your skill against that of your Maid hostess (and your tablemates) at “Candyland,” “Go Fish,” “Rock Paper Scissors” and other games. Marvel at the pure unbridled cuteness of our Maids!\n\n\"As one of the world's major fashion hotspots, Tokyo, Japan is well known for its quirky sense of street style. Come check out what's in (and what's out!) on the streets of Harajuku, Shibuya, and everything in between, and maybe even learn a thing or two about how it all got started! Just learning? We'll give you some hints on where to shop!\n\nThis year, come ready to enter our Street-Fashion Coordinate contest! Prizes will be awarded to the most creative outfits!\"\n\nSlide yourself in for two hours of crazy clip show madness. For the past 15 years (!!) Dave has been screening only the finest of nutsy anime footage, movie trailers, fake ads, real ads that should be fake, training movies, short films, and whatever else he can find that’s reasonably short and kinda cool. Innovative? No. Educational? Probably not. Entertaining? We think so.\n\nFrom runaway princesses to transforming super robots to space guerillas, from ancient astronaut monsters to Greek gods and everything in between, the animation studio Kokusei Eiga (Film International) has been in the background of the history of anime, producing almost-stars and off-brand heroes for a sometimes unknowing audience. You may have seen their shojo series HONEY HONEY or their super robots BRYGER J-9 or GALVION or ACROBUNCH. But what’s the real story behind this studio, and where did they go? Find out!\n\nThe hosts of Ouran High School's infamous Host Club invite you to participate in a commoner game called a murder mystery! Help the hosts find the mischief maker by sleuthing for clues and interacting with each host! Be prepared to be scared... or at least have your funny bone tickled.\n\nJoin us in our mid-century jazz club as we present some of the swingingest music of the 40's and 50's. Non-alcoholic cash bar available. A quick swing lesson starts at 10! Think of us as a glowstick-free alternative to the high-energy dance events happening elsewhere at the convention. Find us across from Jock's and Jill's (in the Maid Cafe space).\n\nGet ready to rip seams and join clothing that was never meant to be joined in this crazy cosplay contest. Work with certified, pre-owned clothes to create an outfit that suits our super-secret theme. We prvide the clothes and supplies needed - you provide the creativity.\n\nOsamu Tezuka is the God of Manga, but his animation legacy is also impressive, with scores of films, TV series, specials, experimental animated shorts, and projects that defy description punching up his resume. From Astro Boy to Blue Blink, Jungle Emperor to Phoenix 2772, Black Jack, Marvelous Melmo, and Don Dracula, we’ll take a look at how his manga genius moved into the anime world and changed everything."
