        "text": "This is a translation of an article that was originally published in IDOL AND READ #005 (December 2015).\n\nS/mileage had a fantastic start. After their formation in 2009, they had their major debut in 2010 and received getting the Japan Record Best Newcomer Award. However, things didn’t go as planned… Risking it all, the group changed its name to ANGERME in December 2014 and welcomed three new members. It was a fresh start with a new line-up of nine members.\n\nWada Ayaka is the leader of ANGERME. This long interview will discuss her upbringing, her journey in the group, and ANGERME’s future after Fukuda Kanon’s graduation.\n\n— As we’re speaking, ANGERME is in the middle of a tour called ANGERME LIVE TOUR 2015 SUMMER/AUTUMN ~FIGHTING NINE~, which happens to be the last live tour with this line-up. What thoughts do you have during your performances?\n\nWada: It’s our first time performing as nine members in many of the places we’re visiting, so fans finally get the opportunity to see us. I’m happy fans can see us again with our current line-up. Just a year ago, we had six members, and it makes me realize that we’ve really changed. Right after this, we’ll be going on our long-awaited hall tour, and I’m extremely excited about it.\n\n— Does it make you emotional knowing it’ll be your last time touring with Fukuda Kanon?\n\nWada: No, I don’t feel particularly sad about it right now. Nothing has changed… We’re just as chaotic. (laughs) Kanon still looks the same as ever, and we’re going just on with our activities and having fun. Hopefully we’ll keep on having fun during her graduation concert at Budokan, too.\n\n— ANGERME is in a transitional period. How do you feel about the state of the group right now?\n\nWada: No matter what, my opinion doesn’t change. I’m in the group and it’s great. I do feel like it’s my second family. We’re spending more time with each other than with our actual family and I really, really adore the members. That’s why I want to stay forever. I want to be here forever and ever.\n\n— S/mileage changed its name to ANGERME, but you’ve been in the group for 6 years and counting your time in Hello! Project Egg, you’ve been an idol for 11 years. Did you think you’d be an idol for this long?\n\nWada: No, I didn’t think so. I didn’t really want to become an idol in the first place. I just loved Hello! Project more than anyone else and didn’t care about becoming an idol. I watched my seniors’ performances and wanted to become like them, not like any other idol.\n\n— So you saw them simply as performers rather than idols, and that’s what you aimed for.\n\nWada: Still, when I was in Hello! Project Egg, I didn’t feel a strong rivalry with the other girls. Some were upset and sad when others debuted before them, but I personally didn’t care at all and just congratulated them. If other girls debuted before me, that was just how it was. They were just active in other ways than me. I only felt like this before debuting, though. After that, I changed completely, and I saw other idols, and other groups, as rivals.\n\n— How did you change as an idol in those 11 years?\n\nWada: I’m getting closer to my ideal self. There were a lot of things I couldn’t do before that I can do now. Life is very different when you’re a trainee and you start your idol activities. Even if you gain experience as a trainee, it’s not all there is to idoling, as there are many things you just can’t do if you’re not a debuted idol. Now that I think about it, I had my major debut five years ago and only after that I felt I was working towards my ideal self. It’s still worth continuing my journey.\n\n— When you say your “ideal self“, what do you mean exactly?\n\nWada: After my major debut, I decided I wanted to be a cool idol. My seniors back then were Platinum-era Morning Musume and I was strongly influenced by them. I didn’t just wish I could be like them, I really decided that, in five years from now, I’d be like them. I’m just that kind of person. (laughs)\n\n— You looked up to Takahashi Ai, who was the leader of Morning Musume and known for her amazing performance skills, and you wanted to reach that level of coolness, too.\n\nWada: Yes! I aimed to be like her and it brought me to where I am now. Well, I’m still working towards it. Becoming like my seniors, Platinum-era Morning Musume, is my personal goal.\n\n— Now that we’re at it, let’s talk about your childhood, before you became the woman you are today. Do you have any stories to tell about your birth?\n\nWada: I was born around 10 p.m., and apparently my dad’s first reaction was that I kind of looked like a Jizou (laughs). I was a bit surprised it was the first thing he could think of. Well, I can’t deny most babies look like that. (laughs)\n\n— What’s your oldest memory?\n\nWada: Hmm… I was three years old… in kindergarden. We were having this long-distance running competition, and my friend asked me to run with them. In my case, though, I’m a fast runner, and I wanted to rank high so I didn’t like the idea of running together. I accepted, but I thought I’d just leave them behind if they were too slow. As expected, my friend was too slow… and (hush-hush) I stopped liking them. (laughs)\n\n— (laughs)\n\nWada: They were mean so I didn’t like them. Also, when they got tired, they gave up and wanted us to walk instead. I remember ignoring them and sprinting past them. (laughs) I heard them say from behind: “I don’t even care about you! We’re not friends anymore and I won’t talk to you!” I completely ignored them and ran away to place well!\n\n— That’s very much like you. (laughs) What kind of child were you?\n\nWada: I was shy, and I still am, but it was worse back then. I didn’t want to be seen in public, even when I was in Hello! Project Egg. I tried my best to avoid cameras so I wouldn’t be filmed and interviewed. I was just very shy and couldn’t speak in front of others. Even in school, I never raised my hand. You know how there are people who never ever speak up in class even when someone calls their name? That was me.\n\n— What were you interested in?\n\nWada: I liked sports. I started swimming when I was three and I also loved running. I even ranked first in marathons. Although I liked swimming and running, I couldn’t care less about ball games. I guess I liked individual sports more. Oh, and I started snowboarding at three and liked that, too. So I didn’t talk to people, but I was active. (laughs)\n\n— So you swam alone, you ran alone, and you slid alone.\n\nWada: I didn’t like following others. Even it came to clothing, I avoided looking like other people. I was a fashionable kid, actually. I had many clothes, and they were only sold in Tokyo, not in my home prefecture of Gunma. Since I wore them in Gunma, I never had the same clothes as other people. That’s how I rolled. (laughs)\n\n— Looks like you didn’t make friends easily.\n\nWada: (laughs) I did like playing with people. I played cops and robbers, and tag outside during recess every day.\n\n— When did you first make friends?\n\nWada: I have a childhood friend, and we’ve been sticking with each other since I was five years old. We lived in the same neighbourhood so it felt like we grew up together. They’re a bit of an airhead and we’re always doing silly things together. (laugh) Anyway, we did things like swimming in the river and riding our bikes as far away as possible. In elementary school, our school set up a perimeter so students wouldn’t stray too far away. We went to the farthest point and played there. In middle school, we didn’t have classes together, but our families were close, so we were always together. We’re still friends today.\n\n— And what about your family?\n\nWada: My family is my dad, my mom, me, my little sister, our dog, our cat… and our pet bird, our little Piichan. My mom is super scary, and she often yells: “WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” My dad is very kind, but he did get mad at me once. I didn’t like wearing turtlenecks, so I told him in a childish way: “I’m not wearing that!” We were about to leave, and I was just shouting: “No, no! I’m not going!” He got mad and said: “Hurry up.” That was the only time my dad ever got mad at me. (laughs)\n\n— He seems so kind. From what you said, I guess your mom was strict?\n\nWada: Quite strict. When I was a child, grandpa and grandma lived with us, and even my great grandma until she passed away. Grandpa was extremely strict too. For example, when we were eating, he was so strict with manners that even my mom was like: “Don’t listen to him too much.” Thanks to him, though, I learned politeness and good manners. And my mom, well, what did she scold me for… She was just always mad. (laughs) Ah, she often scolded me when we commuted to Tokyo for my Hello! Project Egg activities. We rode the bullet train, and I had this bad habit of sitting with my legs wide open. She’d always shout: “Don’t do that!” Back then, I didn’t realize spreading your legs was bad manners. (laughs)\n\n— How is it now?\n\nWada: I’m doing fine so she isn’t worrying about me, but my younger sister is a mess so she gets mad at her. I’m an airhead, but my sister is worse. She’s very easygoing, and I’m the one teaching her stuff now. We’re really close, though, and we’re spending a lot of time together so we do silly stuff. Neither of us makes any sense. We’re nonsensical together.\n\n— By the way, how does your family feel about your idol activities?\n\nWada: I don’t know, because I never say a word about my job to my family. They do know I’ve been a fan of Hello! Project since I was a child because they brought me to concerts. After I joined Hello! Project, I didn’t like people asking me questions about work, and I don’t even say anything to my friends or my family. I’d even tell them not to come see me at concerts, and if they come, I look the other way while dancing… I’m well aware that I’m not supposed to do that. For instance, I was backdancing on the runway at Yokohama Arena, and they were in the family seating area. They were right in front of me, but I looked away and just danced. (laughs)\n\n— Were they supportive of you becoming an idol in the first place?\n\nWada: I did love Hello! Project, but like I said before, I didn’t think about becoming an idol. My mom suggested I should audition and that’s how I found my way to the audition. So naturally, my mom was supportive of it. Now I realize that she encouraged me all along.\n\n— Was there any time you remember causing trouble to your family?\n\nWada: It’s related to what I just said. I didn’t really want to be an idol, but they thought that since I loved them, I wanted to be one so they worked hard for me. They brought me to every Hello! Project concert, and since I loved Hamasaki Ayumi, they brought me to her concert every time, too. And, I think it was after I auditioned for Hello! Project Kids, they sent me to a dance and vocal training school for two years. In retrospect, they really supported me as much as they could. I could have been born in a family that didn’t approve of me becoming an idol even if I wished to, so it’s amazing… I feel grateful and I want to give back to them!\n\n— How did you become a Hello! Project fan?\n\nWada: Hmm… I don’t remember. (laughs) But I think I liked cute concepts like those by Hello! Project and Hamasaki Ayumi. I loved cute stuff. So nothing in particular got me into Hello! Project, but I always watched them.\n\n— They were just a part of your life and you liked them. Did you look up to anyone in particular?\n\nWada: I liked Yaguchi Mari. Gyaru fashion was very popular back then, and I wanted to be a gyaru, too. I wore loose socks, cute platform boots and I dressed up as Mini Moni. What made me like Yaguchi Mari was that she had blond hair. I thought she was cute when I was a kid.\n\n— When you finally entered your beloved Hello! Project, what kind of place was it?\n\nWada: It was so fun. I never thought it was harsh or different from what we saw from the outside. It could be that, because I wasn’t interested in debuting, so I couldn’t be frustrated about not debuting. I thought what I was doing was fun enough as it was.\n\n— So you simply enjoyed being close to what you loved.\n\nWada: That’s exactly it! I just fangirled like: “My senior is just over there!” or “She talked to me!!!” I still had fun after joining, or should I say, I had even more fun after joining!\n\n— You said you were a kid who didn’t like to be in front of other people. How was your first time on stage?\n\nWada: I was so embarrassed. When I was a trainee, I was lumped with all the other Hello! Project Egg members, so my name never came up individually. All the others were like: “I gotta make them know my name fast!”, but in my case, I didn’t want anyone to know my name. I even challenged myself to be there without ever saying my name! (laughs) In the dressing room, there were hangers with a picture of us, and mine had my name “Wada” was written on it. Around that time, more girls were saying their name on stage and stuff, so it made it easier to identify us. That’s how my name “Wada” was revealed, and I was extremely frustrated! (laughs)\n\n— So you lost the “they’ll never know I’m Wada Ayaka” fight. (laughs)\n\nWada: If only they didn’t put up that picture!\n\n— It took about five years, until 2009, for you to debut as a member of S/mileage. Did you work hard believing you could debut someday during that period?\n\nWada: No, because I was embarrassed to appear in public so I thought I’d quit after starting middle school. I never told my mom about this, though, I wasn’t brave enough! I asked myself every day how I should tell her, what words I should use, but I never mustered the courage to say anything. That’s how I ended up here.\n\n— (laughs)\n\nWada: Although I was shy, there was nothing I disliked. Our activities were so fun, I enjoyed dancing and I had a blast while singing too. I had regular weekly lessons with other girls around my age, and we eventually had trainee concerts so we had even more of a chance to be together. It felt like school and it was really fun. The only bad thing was that I was embarrassed, really!\n\n— Were you thinking: “I’m embarrassed! I’m so embarrassed!” while dancing and singing on stage all the time back then?\n\nWada: Yes. (laughs)\n\n— When you were chosen to debut in S/mileage, were you prepared for that?\n\nWada: No, my mindset only changed when we had our major debut. I did think it was great being in a group because I could do the same activities as my seniors. Still, when they told us “You’re releasing a CD as an indie group”, I had no clue what “indie” meant, and I didn’t know the meaning of “debut” either. It was like I was active while being completely unaware of what I was doing. When we were releasing a CD, we were told to strike poses and make facial expressions that were never taught to us before, like for CD jackets and stuff. I was really awful at that, because I was embarrassed to stand in front of the camera and smile.\n\n— Sounds like you weren’t meant to be an idol. (laughs)\n\nWada: I wasn’t. (laughs)\n\n— Yet, even if you weren’t meant to be an idol, you still worked hard in your own way?\n\nWada: I didn’t enjoy looking at the camera and smiling, and what I disliked above all was to look at my pictures. Like, they were showing me pictures of my weird face?!\n\n— Your weird face. (laughs)\n\nWada: It made me angry. I could neither do or stand it. I thought: “Is it really this hard releasing just one CD?” I really disliked photoshoots, as they’d show me my pictures again and it couldn’t possibly be more embarrassing. You know, for CD jackets, we’d be striking poses and I was really embarrassed to look at me making them!\n\n— How did the other members feel? Were you the only one who was embarrassed?\n\nWada: Yes, I was. The others were surprisingly good at making facial expressions. I was the only one who was bad at it, and I hated it even more when I was told I wasn’t good. I was really embarrassed.\n\n— So you must have been extremely embarrassed by S/mileage’s concept, “the idols with the shortest skirts in Japan.”\n\nWada: Well, after our major debut, my mindset changed. I was actually the most pumped about it and not embarrassed at all.\n\n— How did your mindset change, exactly?\n\nWada: Our manager was very strict after we had our major debut, but thanks to that, we learned a lot. I realized that we had come such a long way. Also, our Morning Musume seniors were close to us, and I decided I wanted to become like them! As an indies group, we were performing as the opening act at our seniors’ concerts, and that’s how I grew to think like that. I changed my mindset: I had no reason to be embarrassed.\n\n— S/mileage’s debut was during the idol boom, with AKB48 having their big break and Momoiro Clover rising as well. It felt like S/mileage was Hello! Project’s answer to these groups so they wouldn’t lose to them. Did you feel like this yourself?\n\nWada: No. Nowadays, I look back and think it was a big deal, but back then, it was all so new for us. It was our first time on TV, our first time performing on music shows, our first time doing everything. We didn’t have time to look at S/mileage objectively. We were taught everything and received advice like “It’s like this” or “You got it wrong”, so we had to follow and couldn’t catch our breath. We didn’t know anything about ourselves.\n\n— Yet, the four of you were fearless. I have this memory of you guys fooling around all the time.\n\nWada: The first time we were on TV, we were still an indies group, and I got scolded because I didn’t say anything. They told me why it wasn’t good to keep quiet, and gradually, it all got into my head. So, I tried to speak no matter what and that’s how we got that kind of image. All because back then, they got mad at me for not speaking. I didn’t want them to get mad at me, so I just said whatever. (laughs) Also, I was the leader, but I was super ditzy and didn’t know at all how and when to talk. I couldn’t come up with anything, so our staff told me what to say. Then, I’d tell them I wanted to say something, and they’d reply: “So, you should say it like this” or “Okay, well, people won’t care.” We had these conversations which helped me learn so much and I’m grateful for them.\n\n— When you think about the four of you now, how do you feel?\n\nWada: We were babies. (laughs) We thought we could do everything by working hard, that the more we worked hard, the more the spotlight would be on us. The first time we appeared at an event with multiple idol groups, we were told we were the “best.” It made us so happy, and we believed it, too. We thought that the more we worked, the farther we could go, and we genuinely worked hard for that.\n\n— S/mileage got more attention than Morning Musume around that time, too. In 2010, as soon as you had your major debut with “Yume miru 15”, you won the Japan Record Best Newcomer Award. How did you react to this?\n\nWada: I was overjoyed, like: “I can’t believe it… Us?!”\n\n— The four of you had a look of pure happiness on your face. I watched the video recently, and there was an emotional part where you said smoothly: “We’re getting the grand prize next year.”\n\nWada: Did I say that?!\n\n— You did. (laughs) Let’s move on to another topic. Before you were Japan’s best new idol group, you were living your life as a student. How were your elementary school days?\n\nWada: I played and chatted a lot with people in my class. I was extremely shy with people I didn’t know, but I played with my friend group. I wasn’t the type who stood out. I wasn’t a part of the flashiest group of our class, and I wasn’t friends with those people either, but I was peppy and happy. I played the long jump rope, and playing house was popular too…\n\n— As in, “I’ll be the dad and you’ll be the mom?”\n\nWada: I was the pet.\n\n— You weren’t even human. (laugh)\n\nWada: I just sat and watched them as they talked.\n\n— Was that fun?\n\nWada: If you’re the mom, you have to say stuff like: “do your homework.” If you’re the dad, you say: “that’s right”. If you’re the big sister, you must kind of act like one. I thought it was embarrassing, having to act like that. So I liked being the pet. I could look at people, just go “woof!” sometimes (laughs) and move if someone they said “let’s go”. It was fun.\n\n— How was it in middle school?\n\nWada: In my first year of middle school, I was in the track and field club. I ran 800 meters and even took part in competitions. In my second year, though, I was chosen for Shugo Chara Egg and couldn’t attend the club as much as before. Then, in my third year, I got so busy with work that my teachers gave me extra support. Towards the end, it made me so sad that middle school was ending already. Time went by so fast. I had good friends and did my best so I could attend as much as possible.\n\n— So you enjoyed school.\n\nWada: I did. I realized how wonderful my everyday school life was in my third year. Going to school, taking classes, cleaning up with everyone, attending afternoon homeroom, going back home with my friends. It was so great being able to do this. When I had work, even if I took the very last class until the very last minute, I had to leave immediately and couldn’t clean and attend afternoon homeroom with everyone after school. That’s how I realized how fun it was staying in school until the end of the day and going back home with everyone at the same time. I had to relish this time because it would be gone soon. I’d be graduating and it’d all be over. I had to take it in by asking myself: “After today, how many times will I be able to enjoy this everyday life?”\n\n— What’s your favourite memory of middle school?\n\nWada: My third year, for sure. I had what you’d call a squad…\n\n— What’s a “squad?”\n\nWada: A group of friends I was always hanging out with. We were six girls and we still hang out even today. I was with them in my third year for the most part, so looking back, being with them in my third year was the best thing about middle school. Third year itself was just fun! I was in the same class as all the girls I was friends with. I had a blast.\n\n— Oh, is that why you wrote that angry blog post when you couldn’t go to your coming-of-age ceremony because of work?\n\nWada: Yes. (laughs)\n\n— Coming-of-age ceremonies are basically middle school reunions, after all.\n\nWada: Exactly.\n\n— S/mileage must have been a big part of your life in high school, too.\n\nWada: We had our major debut in my first year of high school, and we were extremely busy with our activities in my second year. In my case, I decided I wanted to go to university in my first year so I studied for entrance exams in my third year. My only memory of high school life is this, university entrance exams. I had one-on-one classes with my teacher so I didn’t have friends in school, but my teacher was kind of like a friend. They always worked with me and encouraged me to come by when I could. If I could only be there in specific timeframe, they’d tell me to come anyway. I never studied so my reading comprehension was below that of an average person. Still, they managed to work with that, found readings for me and even bought me some books.\n\n— It sounds like they really worked hard with you.\n\nWada: Those books were all used, and I have a good story to tell related to this. I had planned to go to an art school, so I just studied everything that had something to do with art. I wrote 3 essays of 2000 characters every day and it was hard, but my teacher really did all they could to support me. Thanks to that, I passed the exams, and to celebrate, my teacher bought me brand-new books for the first time! They gifted me three books they recommended. I was so happy.\n\n— So in university, you majored in art history as you wished. What made you choose art in the first place?\n\nWada: One day, in my first year of high school, I misunderstood our meeting time for work and had a lot of time to spare. At Tokyo Station, the walls were plastered with posters for a Manet exhibition. My mom, who came along, was intrigued by the posters, and I was also strangely attracted to them. When I entered the exhibition hall, I saw a world way beyond imagination. I thought it was so fun and amazing, I started going to art museums without knowing anything about the different genres of art at first. I eventually learned more about them, and I found out about art history. It sounded great, so I decided to go to art school.\n\n— Is this how you got interested in Buddha statues as well?\n\nWada: Yes. I was studying for the university entrance exams and learned about Buddha statues, but I didn’t care about them all that much back then.\n\n— (laughs)\n\nWada: Well, I’m bad at reading kanji, couldn’t tell their faces apart and didn’t know anything about the different types of statues. They all looked the same to me. My teacher told me to look at the exhibition catalogue, so I’d look at it every day reluctantly and I still couldn’t understand the point of them. Then, my teacher gave me some advice. They taught me that Tathagata statues have achieved enlightenment, so they’re not decorated. Also, Bodhisattva statues are a bit greedy so they’re not enlightened and have a lot of shiny things on them. It made me look at statues in a different light and the exhibition catalogue actually made sense from that point onwards! I learned how to read their names naturally and figured out all the different types, but I really realized how fun they were when I could tell their faces apart. I was drawn to them, so when I finished studying for my exams, I asked my mom to go see Buddha statues with me in Kyoto and Nara. During that trip, I couldn’t believe I wasn’t aware there were such wonderful things in Japan! And that’s how I got into them.\n\n— What a great story. You weren’t interested in them at all, but ended up loving them.\n\nWada: It all happened in a flash and opened my eyes.\n\n— Let’s go back to your teenage days, in S/mileage. What memories do you have of your time with the original members?\n\nWada: It was like a dream. We were heavily promoted after our debut, so much our faces were plastered around the Yamanote line. People would tell us there were pictures of the group everywhere around the city, and we were invited on TV shows. We were making headlines for everything we did and a hall tour was announced for us after our debut. We were blessed with a good environment, but it only lasted for a year. When I look back at that time, I can’t believe I actually experienced that, because it really was like I was living a dream.\n\n— In August 2011, Ogawa Saki left the group, and Maeda Yuuka graduated a few months later on December 31st. How did you feel when you heard they were graduating?\n\nWada: …I was mostly sad that we wouldn’t be the four of us anymore. Even if just one person left, the balance of the group wouldn’t be the same. This feeling we created together, it was just so cute. Rather than being sad that they were graduating, I was heartbroken to see this S/mileage with four members change.\n\n— So for a long time, you felt you couldn’t move on?\n\nWada: No, actually, I didn’t feel like this. The second-generation members joined right after, and before we knew it, we hit rock bottom. I thought we couldn’t afford living in the past in such a state. We used to have a schedule that was so packed with activities, we barely had a day off. Afterwards, though, we had weeks with nothing planned, and I even told our manager they didn’t need to lighten our workload so much. That’s when I learned that they were making us work less because there was simply no work for us. There were fewer people coming to see us and our venues were smaller. At every release event, I could tell there were fewer fans attending. I wasn’t “sad” about this, however. I was just trying to find out why it happened when we were doing so well!\n\n— How did the group recover from this slump?\n\nWada : Ever since we had four members, we were dragging ourselves and figured things out along the way by working hard. So we thought that by working hard, we could pull through, people would see it and we’d be able to do hall tours again. But it didn’t happen, and I only realized it in the fall of 2013. Before that, I was busy helping the second-generation members settle in. For example, I was helping Kananan (Nakanishi Kana) learn how to dance. Also, after we lost two original members, I was often told that I looked upset and lacked energy. I didn’t notice it at all myself, but I was like that at that time.\n\n— This era of S/mileage with the second-generation members must be why the group was renamed ANGERME and new members joined. How do you see this era nowadays?\n\nWada: There were many things we couldn’t do and weren’t acknowledged for, yet things made us very happy. We became who we are now thanks to this era. I’m repeating myself now, but I’m glad I could experience it with those members. It brought me happiness.\n\n— You said previously that you love the second-generation members so much, you’d want to marry them. Is it because you went through this era together and bonded?\n\nWada: You’re right. We’re not generation mates, but we’re a “family of six.” The six of us experienced it all together as one. Still, I’m sad for the second-generation because they couldn’t really taste glory. Original members like me just worked hard and made it, but the second generation joined at our lowest point. I feel sorry for them.\n\n— I believe things have changed for the better since you became ANGERME, but how do you feel about it? Are you happy things have changed?\n\nWada: I’m glad people are seeing us in a new way, but I don’t think the group has become drastically better. The group didn’t suddenly become better after the third generation joined, it’s more that we’ve grown gradually since we were six members. Our last days with six members were also great. We performed at Budokan, and before that, we did a musical called Warera Jeanne, and it was a big thing for us. It was the first time the six of us were in a musical, and we did it alongside Berryz Koubou and many other performers from other agencies. We were the least experienced and didn’t want to drag down the others. Sometimes, Berryz Koubou had scheduling conflicts and couldn’t come, so we had to fill in. Of course, we weren’t used to singing musical songs and fighting on stage either, so we had to learn how to do it. We also had to learn two characters because there was the “Reverse” version as well. For us, it was an incredibly hard experience, but our bond became stronger thanks to it. We really helped each other out, which made S/mileage evolve.\n\n— What did you think about the new members that joined afterwards?\n\nWada: Our six members were full of personality, and the three new members also had a lot of personality. I was happy they joined. It’s especially fun that they’re not holding back and are chatting freely with us. We were also doing that in the dressing room as seniors so we’re all chatting together now. Hopefully they’re having fun with us. (laughs)\n\n— Now you’re the leader of a large group. How do you want to see the group change?\n\nWada: I want it to keep going, and that’s why we changed our name and new members joined. I’d be happy if it kept changing, but… as far as I’m concerned, I’m not letting it go!\n\n— I see you’ve made your mind. You know, now that Fukuda Kanon is graduating, fans are speculating you’re going to follow suit…\n\nWada: Nope! I’m here to stay!\n\n— (laughs)\n\nWada: Because we’re not like Morning Musume yet! We’re not like Morning Musume in that era!\n\n— You’re really amazing.\n\nWada: When we’ll reach that point… I might reconsider. (laughs) But I’m not leaving until I’m fully satisfied with my performances! I love singing and dancing and I want to keep doing that as much as I can.\n\n— On November 29, 2015, you’ll the last remaining original member. Do you feel anxious or sad thinking about it?\n\nWada: Not really. I don’t feel this way because I’m confident in the second generation’s abilities. I know it’ll be fine during MCs and when we’re all dancing together. We have our bond from when we were just six members, so I’m not worried. The only thing that worries me is the memories I’m losing, like what we were told in a specific venue, when they got mad at us, what we did back then. I’m all losing that. Kanon is always helping me remember, she always says : “hey, it’s THAT place!”\n\n— So, the people who remember the history of the group will be all gone after she leaves? (laughs)\n\nWada: Yes, so I’m asking her to remind me what happened in this venue by email every time. (laughs)\n\n— I have one last question. As a member and as the leader of ANGERME, what do you want to accomplish?\n\nWada: I want our group to do hall tours on a regular basis. We’re doing a hall tour now, and it’s the first time in a while. It’s a new beginning for us and my dream is coming true, but it’s not quite fulfilled yet. We could be doing a hall tour now, only to go back to live houses again. When you think about our history, you know there’s a chance it could happen. So I’d like us to do them regularly, and if we can do a concert at Budokan on top of that, then I could feel we’ve achieved something together with our own strength. Now, we’re only doing a special graduation concert, and if there are no plans for one, we can’t be there. I’d like for us to reach a point where if we’re not there every time, something’s missing.\n\nThis interview was first published in the May-June 2019 issue of CDJournal.\n\nFor this month’s CDJournal, we conducted a solo interview with Wada Ayaka just before her graduation. Enjoy this in-depth interview with ANGERME’s leader!\n\n— First off, let’s talk about ANGERME. How is ANGERME now that Oota Haruka and Ise Layla joined the group?\n\nHonestly, while I’m still with them, it’ll be hard for those two to bring their own colour to ANGERME. They’ve only been around for six months. Personally, I thought our previous 10-member line-up was amazing. We’ve had a wonderful time together and each of us brought something different. We created a group in which diversity is welcome. With them joining, I hope ANGERME will be more colourful rather than just changing shape.\n\n— You don’t think the group’s image has changed much?\n\nWada: Right. We’re all in the same group, but we took different paths to get here. It became more obvious to me after they joined and became the youngest members. The environment we had with 10 members wasn’t the same, but I feel we’re getting more colourful. However, it doesn’t mean things haven’t changed after they joined. The biggest part is that we’re learning about how society works. I haven’t felt this way in a long time, so it’s exciting. They don’t know anything and I’m having fun watching them. They both came to Tokyo from Hokkaido and don’t spend as much time with their family as they did before. They aren’t used to this lifestyle and they’re just working and working. They’re learning and feeling a burden. Sometimes things went wrong, but they overcame that in those few months and so did everyone else. I have the feeling we’re finally starting something new.\n\n— Things don’t always go well, and not just on stage.\n\nWada: Of course. Neither of them knew how to use honorifics. When you’ve been doing this for years, honorifics are second nature. I’ve seen them mess up and get frustrated. As a group, we were scrambling to find solutions.\n\n— Have you felt frustrated in the past yourself? Did you ever look at 2ki members and think, ‘why?!’?\n\nWada: I still do, even now! They’re all kids. (laugh) I’ve often asked myself why they don’t get things, but you know, the fact that they don’t understand brings out the best of them.\n\n— You never see something as either black or white, it can go both ways. It’s interesting listening to you.\n\nWada: It’s hard expressing this stuff!\n\n— I agree and if I cut your words, you could be misunderstood. You often say that while you think something, this other way of thinking is valid too. That’s why I won’t cut things abruptly and I’ll make sure to write down your thoughts as much as possible. Moving on, you said you’re not thinking about how ANGERME will turn out after your graduation?\n\nWada: I don’t think about it. I just trust them and they should do as they please. I’ve come to think about myself more in the past year. I used to think about the group’s future, but now that I know it’s not in my control, I started having enough time to care about myself.\n\n— So you’re thinking about your own future.\n\nWada: Yes. Now I’m living in 2021.\n\n— You’re a woman of the future.\n\nWada: I am, but we’re still in 2019, so I have nothing on my plate but ANGERME now. I feel I should take it easy and enjoy it.\n\n— What will you be doing in 2021?\n\nWada: I’ll be going all out and working actively. My mind is full of things I’d like to do.\n\n— You’ve said before that you wanted to continue with ANGERME forever, but when you thought about the members’ future, you realized you couldn’t. You must have been disappointed. How did you come to terms with that?\n\nWada: I was disappointed as if I woke up from a dream. It was sad, but obvious, though. Nothing lasts forever in this world and there was no guarantee I could always be active with these members. Naturally, I knew we all have our own lives, but I really took peace for granted. (laugh) I closed my eyes and lived away from reality thinking we could go on together forever. It was a great shock to me, but thankfully, I thought about the things I wanted to do and focused on that.\n\n— You thought about other members’ lives.\n\nWada: I did, and I can’t take on this responsibility. I can’t go that far. I’m sorry, but they have to think for themselves.\n\n— That happened two years ago. I understand you’re always living two years ahead.\n\nWada: Finally, I feel at peace. I’ve come to terms with reality. I’d like to dream again, living in real life.\n\n— You want to dream again, and continue on your own.\n\nWada: Yes.\n\n— You’re making it a point to say that you want to keep working as an idol.\n\nWada: I am, for a reason.\n\n— While considering your life after graduation, you wanted to continue as an idol. How did you realize that?\n\nWada: Hmm… I wonder how. Essentially, I like being an idol, and there’s no reason for me to go all the way and stop being an idol. As for how I realized that, I’m not sure.\n\n— You’re restricted when using ‘idol’ as your job title, though.\n\nWada: Of course, and it might be what frustrated me the most. I ‘had’ to be ‘like that’. I debuted in 2010, and as new idols started appearing, the clearer it was to me. I felt stuck at times. Can I talk about this in detail?\n\n— Sure, go ahead.\n\nWada: Generally speaking, a typical idol is conventional and cute with natural make-up. I started believing it was fine for an idol not to be like that. I like art and there are many artworks that make you think about what it means to be a woman. In the past, women had to stay at home and many couldn’t work. Artworks were created during those times, and I realized it was part of real life. Reflecting on this, there were many aspects that overlapped with my own work as an idol. A new path opened before my eyes, leading me to think it was fine seeing things the way I did.\n\n— The way you saw idols and thought about them changed.\n\nWada: The more I followed that path, the more I felt restricted. We have to think about this more and give everyone the opportunity to be who they want to be. I strongly believed that I had to break that mold while I’m active. Age might be one thing, but to put it simply, I just wanted to go beyond that. Not only this, but we need to think larger. Idols themselves don’t even know some things are possible for them. They don’t have an interest, and there are no opportunities for them in the first place. They have to think and take responsibility for themselves. I’m sure I can have a strong influence on them by being an idol and showing things I’m interested in through singing and dancing.\n\n— Actually, it seems as if you’re talking about gender issues rather than the image of idols.\n\nWada: You’re not wrong.\n\n— It didn’t take you long to reach that point.\n\nWada: Fufu. (laugh) I got there fast.\n\n— It was with a different angle, but you could express your views clearly in musicals like Mode and Yume miru Television.\n\nWada: Still, those stories felt a bit dated with women who couldn’t be working in some environments. I don’t think you could be influenced directly by that, but you can reflect about your surroundings and see many connections. When you’re on the production side of idols, you’re holding on to an image unconsciously. It’s hard changing that. Not only the receiving side, but the production side has a responsibility. If this side isn’t saying anything, nothing happens so the other side isn’t discussing it.\n\n— That’s for sure. You won’t deny there’s a fantasy aspect to idols.\n\nWada: I won’t.\n\n— Do you think it should be closer to reality?\n\nWada: It should be. It’s really hard to do, but it can be done. When you can’t tell a story only with reality, adding a bit of fantasy can actually make it resonate more.\n\n— Reality and fantasy can coexist without conflicting.\n\nWada: That’s how I see it. When you do that, you want to change things, or really, spark a conversation. You want to talk about a current issue with everyone else.\n\n— It’s strange how there’s a rumour that you have to leave a group at 25 when some idols graduate at a younger age.\n\nWada: I don’t take it badly when I’m told things like that. I don’t think about it myself, so when I hear that, I’m like, ‘Oh, really?’. I have no clue why it’s a thing, why some people choose this time to go.\n\n— It has to be a coincidence.\n\nWada: I can’t think of anything but that. They thought about that time. However, there are girls who want to get married. Girls dream of that. I’m not against it; it’s a wonderful thing. If it’s their wish, they should go for it. You’re bound to think this way, because you know, you’re considered old if you get pregnant after 35. If you keep working as an idol, then you can’t fulfill your dream, sadly.\n\n— Let’s go back to a previous topic. You said that art often opened your eyes to the world?\n\nWada: In many ways. I learn about things mostly through art. It starts with passion, then I get a huge shock.\n\n— You have deep thoughts. What made you want to express them openly?\n\nWada: It started about a year ago. Even if I feel something, I can’t say ‘it’s like this’. We all have different ways of thinking in the group. I don’t want to brainwash the new members, it’d be weird. That’s why I don’t say anything while I’m with the group, ANGERME could see it wrong. Since I announced my graduation, I’m answering questions like ‘What will you be doing?’ alone and I see them as an opportunity to talk. As I’ve said before, I’ve been thinking about myself more. I deepened my reflection, or really, I’m more convinced. (laugh)\n\n— You said on your blog that the members were excited about possible Banksy art in Tokyo, but you couldn’t tell them that if it really were Banksy, his goal was to send a warning message to Tokyo. You’re always considering the members, refraining from saying things and choosing your words to have the right impact.\n\nWada: I do consider them. Some things should be said, really, but if I told them, it might create a strange atmosphere. I talk if I can, but not with the members. I’m scared I might put my thoughts into someone’s mind unintentionally. They’re young, so they’re sensitive to topics, especially the youngest ones.\n\n— I see. You also learned French because of art, right?\n\nWada: My favourite painter is Manet. I read books for school, but I have to know French.\n\n— So you can check original documents.\n\nWada: That was the point, but also, I just really had to go to Paris, where Manet painted. I learned French because of that, but now I keep studying it because the language itself is fun. (laugh) It all started with Manet, but I’d like to see social movements and such over there too.\n\n— You’re also heading in that direction yourself.\n\nWada: Right. People from different countries are living in Paris, and I want to see that for myself.\n\n— It seems you’re thinking about living there.\n\nWada:…Yes. (laugh) I’d like to live there permanently at 60 years old. I’m thinking about staying there for a short while, but I love Japanese idols, so I’ll come back after all. I’m sure about this. I’m not walking away from my surroundings. It’d be easy to leave, but I won’t. I’m having fun so I can’t.\n\n— You grew up as an idol, so there must have been times when you thought about stopping, right?\n\nWada: Well, sometimes learning choreography was too hard. (laugh) But dancing is fun, and so is singing.\n\n— Do you feel your body has changed? Michishige Sayumi often said that she started getting leg cramps in her 20s.\n\nWada: Oh, I actually haven’t felt that, except I got hay fever like a week ago.\n\n— So only from this year!\n\nWada: I’m still not sure if it is. I recorded songs with a nasal voice. (laugh) It’s just light hay fever, so it’s fine.\n\n— You haven’t felt changes to your body, but your mind has certainly matured.\n\nWada: I matured, right! (laugh) I’m often told I’m mature, but it seems I’m talking too much and too honestly, so I need to be more careful.\n\n— I’ve always had this impression of you as someone who speaks honestly about everything. Aren’t you already being careful, choosing your words with the members and all?\n\nWada: I tend to overthink. I guess I woke up from my dream too abruptly. After I realized everyone has their own life, I got a bit scared.\n\n— Was there anything that happened which made you reach that conclusion?\n\nWada: When I heard the members talking about their future and I felt a gap. They were following a different path from mine. Also, the new members are 10 years younger than me. When I was still dreaming, I thought the new members shared the same dream, but when I thought about it, I realized that it’d be an issue if their dream changed in 10 years. We were supposed to have the same dream, but it might be different then.\n\n— You thought you were a group with a common destiny.\n\nWada: I thought we were like that, but after 10 years, chances are members would want to follow a different path.\n\n— And you realized that…\n\nWada: …Through everyday chat.\n\n— Then, you woke up from your dream and decided to work as an idol alone from scratch.\n\nWada: I don’t know who I am completely yet either, so I’ll figure that out after graduating.\n\n— You’re going to find your true self.\n\nWada: Once I find it, I’ll put it into words.\n\nI haven’t put myself out there yet\n\n— Have you decided what you want your graduation concert to look like?\n\nWada: My priority right now is showing everyone how awesome ANGERME is. That’s what I want the concert to be about. I’d be happy if all the members could shine.\n\n— That’s very much like you. When I asked you about the tour a while ago, you questioned whether it’d be good to add a lot of S/mileage songs to the setlist. You really wanted to showcase current ANGERME.\n\nWada: The past is behind us. If I don’t make current ANGERME members shine, there’s no point to this concert. Basically, current members are the present. At the same time, it’d be nice to look back a bit because there won’t be any original S/mileage members left after me, but I’d do it for only for three minutes or so.\n\n— That’d be too short. (laugh) Besides, aren’t you looking back in your song Yume mita 15?\n\nWada: Back to back. (laugh) The song is all about throwbacks.\n\n— When I listen to it, I just feel emotional.\n\nWada: …Same for me. (laugh) It made me feel emotional after our first performance. Before then, the lyrics meant something to me, but there were parts I couldn’t sing with my own emotions during recording. When we performed it live, my emotions and the audience’s came together and it finally resonated deeply with me. Everyone ended up sobbing. I appreciate that, so I want to cherish and sing it for everyone.\n\n— So listeners’ emotions completed the song for you.\n\nWada: Yes, and the fact that it’s an upbeat song too. You have all those emotions and you’re singing them positively. It’s all the more touching.\n\n— It reminds me of Country Girls. Also, you have a new song (Kaeritakunai na) written by Tsunku. Will this be a graduation song too?\n\nWada: It’s not a straight-up graduation song, but I relate to it and love it. It’s like that song he wrote when Meimei (Tamura Meimi) graduated, Koi nara tokku ni hajimatteru. You can sing it like any other non-graduation song, but it fills you with sadness. When I recorded it, it brought back many feelings to the surface. It’s like magic.\n\n— I’m excited to hear this song. Do you feel like it’s your last single personally?\n\nWada: Not really, it’s just Koi wa Accha Accha.\n\n— It just came down to that.\n\nWada: So much suspense. (laugh) There are a lot of elements from Indian culture and it hits you hard, but when you read the lyrics, you realize that they were trying to do something similar to 46okunen LOVE. You see that they’re connected and the intention of people behind it. To be honest, when they told me it had an Indian theme, I thought it’d be a perfect fit for me. (laugh) The outfit suits me the best out of everyone. (laugh) I’m often mistaken for someone from another Asian country, so I thought I’d be the best in that role.\n\n— Do you feel sad as your graduation is approaching?\n\nWada: I sure do. There are days I don’t feel as energetic, but as soon as I’m with the group, my day becomes brighter because they’re all really silly. (laugh) It makes me sad thinking I’m going to be missing that in my life. Thankfully, after that, I’ll have an opportunity to show myself at last. I haven’t put myself out there yet.\n\n— It seems like it. I look forward to talking to you during your solo activities too.\n\nWada: Now I have to hold myself back so I won’t say too much. (laugh) Let’s talk again in 2021.\n\nThis interview was first published in the June 2016 issue of OVERTURE (Vol. 7). Thanks to Crests (@xiaoaishiteru) for providing me with screenshots!\n\nSince Tsunku stepped down as general producer in 2014, different lyricists and composers have been working on Hello! Project songs. Among these are Nakajima Takui (ANGERME’s Taiki Bansei) and Maeyamada Kenichi, also known as Hyadain (Kobushi Factory’s Chotto Guchoku ni! Chototsu Moushin). The two musicians had an open discussion on their songwriting process and the source of Hello! Project-ness.\n\n— Is this your first time meeting each other?\n\nNakajima: Yes, it is. I don’t really get called by media like this in the first place. I’m not on TV. I don’t even have a lot of friends. (laughs)\n\nMaeyamada: Oh no, that’s… I’m looking forward to speaking to you today! When Taiki Bansei came out, I heard Takui-san’s version and I was like, “Ah, this is awesome, both versions are cool”. After hearing °C-ute’s Tsugi no Kado wo Magare, I thought you had an outstanding knack at creating melodies.\n\n— Takui-san, what’s your impression of Maeyamada-san?\n\nNakajima: Usually, I write songs for myself to sing. I’m a solo artist, but my style is similar to a band’s. I’m not someone you could call a professional songwriter. As for Hyadain-san, he writes songs for a lot of different people and often appears on TV. In other words, I have this image of him being a celebrity.\n\nMaeyamada: Thank you. (laughs)\n\n— So, today we’d like to have a discussion on songwriting for Hello! Project. First, how do you get requests?\n\nNakajima: There are two different cases for me. When it comes to Taiki Bansei and Tsugi no Kado wo Magare, to tell you the truth, I wrote them for myself. They changed the key and the arrangement so they could be sung by Hello! Project groups. Last year, I got a request to write two songs for Juice=Juice (Ai Ai Gasa, GIRLS BE AMBITIOUS). I met with their manager, and they told me: “Here’s how the 5 members are feeling right now. Could you put this in the lyrics? This member likes this kind of food, and she’s into this stuff right now.” We had a chat and looked at the members’ profiles carefully. After that, I was asked to write about love from a girl’s perspective. But you know, I’m from an all-male household. I didn’t have a mom and was raised by my dad so I don’t know anything about girls’ feelings. (embarrassed) I only have experience with straightforward love.\n\nMaeyamada: Straightforward love?\n\nNakajima: I moved to Tokyo directly after graduating from junior high and worked while playing in a band. I haven’t properly dated or even went to a party. I’ve never been through all the steps of love, it’s like, you’re into me, OK, if not, next! So I can’t write stuff you often hear in popular lyrics, like: “Secretly loving him, in the corner of the classroom”.\n\n— Then, how did you do it?\n\nNakajima: Well, I love movies. I wrote what came to my mind while thinking about movies like Chiisana koi no uta. So when I write for Hello! Project, I have to change my mindset completely, especially when it comes to lyrics. In comparison, I only draw from my own experiences when I write songs for myself.\n\n— Hyadain-san, what’s your process?\n\nMaeyamada: So far this year, I’ve only been asked to write one song. Many years ago, I was involved in writing a few songs for Kirarin Revolution. It’s weird talking like an expert when I’ve only written one song…\n\nNakajima: Just say what you want. (laughs)\n\nMaeyamada: You know, there’s this thing called Hello! Project-ness. I wrote the lyrics with set phrases in mind.\n\nNakajima: Did you learn this from studying Tsunku’s work?\n\nMaeyamada: I’ve learned this naturally because I’m a fan of Hello! Project. It’s hard creating while thinking about how Tsunku-san would write something, but I can do it if I think about words that Tsunku-san wouldn’t use. I filter out words that wouldn’t appear in Tsunku-san and Hello! Project songs.\n\nNakajima: What do you mean by set phrases, expressions like “Chototsu Moushin”?\n\nMaeyamada: That’s part of it, but also changing words like “tomodachi” (friend, casual) to “yuujin” (friend, formal) or “okaasan” (mom) to “ryoushin” (parents).\n\n— What about the sound?\n\nMaeyamada: I can’t go too hard in the chorus. The idol group I go the hardest with is Dempagumi.inc, and you can feel I’m going overboard in the chorus. If I were to do this in a Hello! Project song, Hashimoto Shin (UP-FRONT WORKS chief director) would cut it.\n\nNakajima: Oops, you name-dropped someone. (laughs)\n\nMaeyamada: Hashimoto-san would probably say: “Tone it down a notch. This isn’t Hello! Project”. He has a very objective understanding of Hello! Project.\n\n— There were people who thought Chotto Guchoku ni! Chototsu Moushin sounded like a “Hello! Project song,” but not like a “Hyadain song”. Did you consciously avoid using your signature sound?\n\nMaeyamada: That’s funny, because I didn’t try to sound like Hello! Project. It’s just “Hello! Project magic,” as I think the production team played a huge part in it. I only created the melody and the lyrics, and the arrangement and demo vocals turned it into a Hello! Project song. The team are experts who have been doing this for decades. Technically speaking, they can turn anything into a Hello! Project song. Unlike what everyone thinks, I didn’t mean to write a Hello! Project-like song.\n\n— Now that’s interesting. After writing the lyrics, the melody and the chord progression, how are you involved in the arrangement process?\n\nNakajima: Hmm, it depends on the song. In my own particular case, the recording data I create is often used as a basis. They raise the key of my demo vocals, cut out unnecessary sounds and then add some. Every time, they raise the key and the tempo for sure, and just by doing that, the song sounds quite different from the original.\n\n— Basically, you’re not involved with the final arrangement process?\n\nNakajima: No, I’m not. I let them do it, but with LoVendoЯ, I was involved in launching a song. Another time, they asked me to make an accurate demo.\n\nMaeyamada: Ah, that also happens in the process.\n\nNakajima: But I can’t do solo guitar shredding, because I don’t do metal. Then again, the girls aren’t doing hardcore hard rock. If they want a solo that’s full of nuances, I’ll just make a guitar sound with my mouth, like “werowerogwiiin”. You know, LoVendoЯ’s Uozumi Yuki and Miyazawa Marin are so serious, they copied my mouth guitar solo perfectly. (embarrassed) My mouth sounds were just there to tell them to play freely, in a nuanced way.\n\nMaeyamada: So talented! If you can do that, it means you’re skilled, all three of you.\n\nNakajima: No, I’m not, I still can’t read a music score and I can’t use Pro Tools. At most, I can use Garage Band a bit, but when I’m in the studio, I’m basically telling musicians what I want with my mouth.\n\n— Some musicians aren’t satisfied unless they do everything themselves from scratch…\n\nNakajima: I’m like that with my own music; I want to do everything myself. When you’re making music for someone else, you want to hand it over to them. If others were to complain about my music, I’d be upset, so I respect others’ work and don’t say anything. You know, deep down, I don’t want to care about what people feel.\n\nMaeyamada: What do you mean by that?\n\nNakajima: People’s feelings are very hard to understand. If I start acting according to someone else’s feelings, I don’t know what the heck I’m actually doing. After all, if I don’t understand something myself, I can’t move others. Imagine if I were to go on stage and sing a song while thinking: “Man, I recorded this song, but I’m not satisfied with it.” I wouldn’t be able to stir emotions.\n\nMaeyamada: I guess so.\n\nNakajima: I give my very best when I work on my part, but when I’m done, I let go and completely trust others with the rest. Earlier, Hyadain-san was saying that his songs are just turned into Hello! Project songs. I really feel the same for my own work.\n\n— It seems that when external songwriters like you are writing songs for Hello! Project, a lot of them have a funky sound. Don’t you feel like writing kayoukyoku songs closer to Platinum era or Daite HOLD ON ME?\n\nNakajima: This funky sound is one element from Tsunku-san’s work. I’ve never been asked to write a funky song specifically. To put it this way, I just write good melodies and lyrics, and the team dresses up the songs with nice clothes. Sometimes, the clothes may be funky.\n\nMaeyamada: Tsunku-san is also writing EDM-like songs. I don’t think we can do them better than him. Only Tsunku-san can pull off this fantastic sound.\n\n— Maeyamada-san, you’re writing songs for a wide range of acts, from Johnny’s to anime. How is Hello! Project different in terms of direction?\n\nMaeyamada: It’s very precise. I get a million requests for revising songs, but I absolutely don’t feel bad about that. I really agree with them. The team is full of genuine music lovers. They’re absurd, in a good way.\n\nNakajima: I couldn’t have said it better.\n\nMaeyamada: One of my very first jobs was for Kirarin Revolution. It was a song for Milkyway, a unit with Kusumi Koharu. It was my first time being in charge of an entire song, down to the arrangement. I revised everything in that song over a hundred times. I kept rewriting the lyrics, the arrangement and the composition over and over again. It was such a rocky first experience that it made all of my next jobs look like a piece of cake. (laughs) That’s why I’m grateful to them. I would certainly get mad if I were asked to make unreasonable changes, though. Still, I’ve been working with teams for a long time, not only Hello! Project, but Dempagumi.inc, Momoiro Clover, Ebichu… and I always get reasonable requests. I could be asked to rewrite all the lyrics in the verse, for example, but I don’t take it badly at all. I agree with absolutely everything and do my part.\n\nNakajima: I’ve had to rewrite songs over and over too, but revising over a hundred times is out of this world.\n\nMaeyamada: Towards the end, we were really running out of time, so Taisei-san came over to the rundown shoebox I used to live in. He waited for me patiently on the sofa, the kind that if you sit on it, you get bitten by mites. I was barely conscious, but I had fun. It was the first time I felt I was needed to create music. I don’t know if I would do it again today, though…\n\nIs Tsunku a God? From a creator’s standpoint, he’s one-of-a-kind.\n\nNakajima: While he was producing Hello! Project, Tsunku-san was also running his company, TNX. He asked me to write songs for TNX idols. Like I said, I don’t use music software at all. So before I worked with Tsunku-san, I requested that he brought a guitar to our meeting. Then, I asked him: “What kind of song do you want?” and we played chords to check if it was right. This process left a big impression on me. We went back and forth, going like: “Should we add a minor here?” and “We don’t need a major 7th in the bridge”.\n\nMaeyamada: Ah, it sounds like Tsunku-san would enjoy this process.\n\n— According to you, what makes Tsunku-san special as a creator and producer?\n\nMaeyamada: The biggest thing for me is that he’s always evolving. He works with new people, new genres, fresh arrangements… It’s not that he tries to be unique; he’s consistent at it. He’s craving freshness, but he’s also studying the past and exploring sounds like rockabilly and kayoukyoku. He’s not rehashing things.\n\nNakajima: So true! He’s embracing the punk way of life.\n\nMaeyamada: He’s the kind of person you can imagine saying something like “let’s rock?” with a grin. Tsunku-san is always rocking. For example, Morning Musume released a single called Namida ga Tomaranai Houkago, which Konno Asami-san and Michishige Sayumi-san centered…\n\n— Their vocals are…\n\nMaeyamada: Exactly, they’re not good vocalists. Namida ga tomaranai houkago is also a medium tempo ballad (keeping their vocals in mind). When I met Tsunku-san, I told him: “You must have cut a lot for the single.” He replied with a smile: “I wanted to release the song without correcting the pitch, but when I listened to it, it was a bit too rock. Then, I might have released it as is.” (laughs) Anything works if it’s interesting, he’s refreshing like that. No doubt that, at his core, he loves and understands performers.\n\nNakajima: You can feel he’s always looking for new things. He’s someone who wants to create fresh stuff too, so to me, he’s just like a punk.\n\nMaeyamada: Tsunku-san himself says he’s “rock”, but he’s doing “punk” things.\n\n— Tsunku-san could release something a ton of songs like LOVE Machine if he wanted.\n\nMaeyamada: He could, but it wouldn’t be interesting to him. He’s probably get tired of it.\n\n— Still, normally, you’d be asked to follow a successful path. Maeyamada-san, do you often get requests like “make me a song that sounds like this”?\n\nMaeyamada: I do. Inside, I’m thinking: “How can you do the same thing? “… but I do it for the money. (laughs)\n\nNakajima: Of course. (laughs) I worship the Beatles, and while they were only active for 7-8 years, they changed tremendously during that time. Look at the speed of their evolution, and at how they destroyed themselves, quickly overthrew the rules and reached a state of anarchy… No matter how you cut it, it’s punk. I think the path created by the Beatles’ leads to all genres. If I may say so, Tsunku-san’s creative energy is the Beatles themselves. Breaking yourself constantly is punk. But you know, you only live once. In my opinion, you had no choice when you’ve done something again on purpose.\n\n— It’s like your character as a creator.\n\nNakajima: I guess. That’s why my music doesn’t sell! I don’t do what fans want. I can’t make the same popular song twice or thrice.\n\nMaeyamada: I’m not that extreme. (laughs) Still, even idol groups that follow one path never ever say : “let’s make it like this again”. It’d be rude, even towards me.\n\n— Do you mean they don’t go along with fans’ wishes?\n\nNakajima: If you go along with fans’ wishes, you’re not rocking… It’s just not it. When creators want to please fans, they’re not creating music. You know, classical music is very punk. It usually has a lot of modulation and tempo changes.\n\nMaeyamada: True! I think the exact same thing. There’s no such thing as classical music “having to sound a certain way”.\n\n— Let’s finish this off: where is Hello! Project headed now?\n\nMaeyamada: I made it clear in this interview that if their team is involved, the songs will keep being quite Hello! Project-like. It was like this for Takui-san’s Taiki Bansei, and even for Tsuno Maisa-san’s Utakata Saturday Night. You can say that as long as they’re looking over the production process. This Hello! Project-ness can be created precisely because of Tsunku-san and the staff’s long experience with it. Conversely, someone else can write a song and it can become Hello! Project-like, as if it were an automated process. An important aspect is that Tsunku-san is pushing the team forward as a creator. Even now, this Hello! Project-ness is updated because of Tsunku-san. If I could ask him anything, it’d be: “Tsunku-san, please be active and keep working forever”. Just that. I want more weird songs like Oheso no Kuni Kara Konnichiwa. It’s also my wish as a fan.\n\nNakajima: I’ve had more opportunities to write songs for Hello! Project lately. Honestly, I thought that they were interested in having people from a different genre, like me, writing songs for them. Then, I understood that no matter what I did, their exceptional team would use their ability to make songs Hello! Project-like. Hello! Project isn’t so fragile that by having us write songs, Tsunku-san’s influence would decline. Hello! Project is unshakable. Tsunku-san wants to bring in new blood, and by following his idea, I believe Hello! Project will become even more interesting.\n\nSource: OVERTURE No.007, June 2016.\n\nThis interview was originally published in the May-June 2019 issue of CD Journal.\n\n— You joined ANGERME six months ago, in November 2018. What did you do after the announcement?\n\nIse: I didn’t know much about Hello! Project at first. I had heard the name “ANGERME” before, but it’s not like I knew all the members. The day after I joined, I started learning about the group by listening to their songs and practicing them and looking up the members. I wrote every member’s name, favourite food and blood type on a piece of paper.\n\nOota: Wow! As for me, after Wada-san talked to us, I knew I wouldn’t meet other seniors for two weeks. So I learned the moves to Tade kuu mushi mo Like it! and 46okunen LOVE. I thought we’d be performing these two songs with them first, so I wanted to have the choreography down perfectly.\n\n— Oota, how did you feel when it was time to say goodbye to Hokkaido Kenshuusei?\n\nOota: I went back to Hokkaido and told them the day before the announcement at Pacifico Yokohama (November 22). We had been friends for two and a half years so we all cried together. I think there were some tears of sadness and disappointment, but they hit me right in the heart and made me cry. I was the first member promoted from Hokkaido Kenshuusei, so I wanted to work hard. I’m working hard right now.\n\n— What was your impression of your ANGERME seniors?\n\nIse: I wasn’t a trainee and I hadn’t seen ANGERME live, so it really was my first time meeting them. They all had small faces and an incredible aura. I was impressed and wondered if it was right for me to join them.\n\n— How were they in terms of personality?\n\nOota: Everyone was kind!\n\nIse: They were kind. When I looked up ANGERME before meeting them, I had this image of an energetic group. I saw them backstage after the photoshoot and they were exactly like on screen: super energetic. I liked that.\n\nOota: Our seniors were expecting us, so they were super accepting. Then, I saw ANGERME live and asked myself if I could follow along. So I practiced on my own.\n\n— What was your impression of each other?\n\nIse: I had seen Morning Musume live in Hokkaido two years before, in my first year of middle school. Haachan (Oota) was the opening act as a member of Hokkaido Kenshuusei. I knew she was the eldest, and when I met her, she seemed amazing to me.\n\nOota: Hahaha.\n\nIse: She looks like a bit of an airhead, and she really is one (laugh), but she’s level-headed. She’s a leader type, and even though we’re generation mates, I thought she’d be taking the lead.\n\nOota: (Embarrassed) Fufufu.\n\n— So, she’s a leader. Did you know she gives snacks to instructors during lessons?\n\nIse: Really!? (Looks at Oota) Is that true?\n\nOota: Yeah.\n\nIse: Wow! That’s weird. (laugh)\n\nOota: I hugged her off-screen the first time I met her. That’s how I knew she was a friendly girl.\n\nIse: You’re the one who hugged me, though?\n\nOota: But you accepted my hug, so I knew we could be friends. She’s fooling around in the dressing room even today, but when we’re rehearsing, you can see that Layla-chan has grown a lot in the past four or five months. Isn’t it great how this unexperienced girl joined ANGERME just like that and can hold her own while dancing? We’re generation mates and friends, but I do feel some frustration. I think it’s natural when you have generation mates.\n\n— Ise-san has a lot of dancing experience, right?\n\nIse: I did classical ballet from fourth grade to the third year of middle school.\n\n— So, you danced for six years. That’s a lot of experience.\n\nIse: No, I’ve spent more time not dancing.\n\nOota: I watched Layla-chan’s audition video where she did ballet and it was awesome.\n\nIse: Noooooo, I’m really not good at all.\n\n— After joining, you practiced hard for some time and had your first performance with ANGERME on January 2 at an Hello! Project concert.\n\nIse: I didn’t perform well on stage when I did classical ballet. It didn’t show on my face, but I was extremely nervous and kept messing up. Since I joined, I don’t know why, but I perform a bit better and enjoy myself while dancing right from the start.\n\n— You’re the kind of girl who’s nervous, but others can’t tell by looking at your face.\n\nOota: I can tell by the way she’s acting.\n\nIse: That’s because Haachan is the closest member to me. Our seniors keep saying I don’t look nervous at all, when I’m the most nervous in the group.\n\nOota: I’m the opposite. It shows on my face when I’m nervous, yet it all goes away when seniors smile at me on stage. I often messed up when we did regular performances in Hokkaido, and if I may say so myself, I’ve improved and don’t make as many mistakes nowadays.\n\n— You two are strong. How did you get used to being in the group?\n\nOota: I’m not used to it yet!\n\nIse: When we’re all together, seniors come to chat with us and it’s easy for us to join discussions, but it’s hard talking to them on our own.\n\nOota: We’re often just the two of us in the dressing room.\n\n— I’ve heard it’s common for generation mates to stick together and not approach others.\n\nIse: It depends on the mood. Since we’re working, rehearsals are serious. We’re thinking about our next dance move and it’s pretty hard approaching others and asking questions. I struggle with that.\n\n— We’re talking right now, and I have this feeling that you’re not really shy. Is that the case?\n\nIse: Haachan says I talk to seniors more than she does, but she’s the one who’s good at talking, you know!\n\nOota: No no no, that’s wrong!\n\nIse: You keep approaching Takeuchi Akari-san, that’s amazing. Even if I talk to her, I can’t go that far. I admire that.\n\n— By that, do you mean she’s comfortable enough to just go and talk to her for something other than asking for help with dance moves?\n\nOota: I can talk to all the members when we’re together as a group, but when I’m alone with a senior, I can’t. I’m lightweight shy.\n\nIse: “Lightweight”. (laugh)\n\nOota: Just a bit shy.\n\n— You started your activities at the beginning of the year and went on a live house and hall tour, but you still feel somewhat of a distance with the group.\n\nOota: I asked Kasahara-san, Kawamura-san and Funaki-san how to get closer to seniors. They said that they got closer after going on trips to Disneyland and the ocean, so I’m excited to go.\n\nIse: Me too!\n\nOota: We need to spend time together, but we don’t have days off at the same time so we can’t meet.\n\n— It’s hard making plans with a huge family. Do you often go out just the two of you?\n\nIse: Not that much.\n\nOota: We hung out together like once.\n\nIse: We went out before a lesson because we had a little bit of time to spare.\n\nOota: We don’t hang out together during holidays.\n\n— What did you do when you hung out?\n\nIse: We went karaoke; I wanted to go. I basically ended up singing alone.\n\nOota: You were cute.\n\nIse: What’s up with that. I don’t get you. (laugh)\n\n— Sorry for the naive question, but how has Tokyo been treating you?\n\nOota: Naive?\n\nIse: Hmm, Tokyo…\n\nOota: (Whispers) Naive?? Naive???\n\nIse: Not that my environment hasn’t changed, but it doesn’t feel that different here. Something I find sad is that you can’t see stars in the city sky. Hokkaido has a lot of nature and you can live a relaxed life. The sky is very pretty. I’m sad I can’t look at it anymore.\n\n— Outside of that, you haven’t felt a big difference.\n\nIse: Not really.\n\nOota: What! I felt a huge difference. My house was surrounded by mountains and I played tag with foxes.\n\n— With foxes?\n\nIse: You’re definitely lying! That’s impossible!\n\nOota: No! There were foxes!\n\nIse: Even if there were some, you can’t have played tag with them.\n\nOota: I chased them by following their footprints.\n\nIse: You’re not a girl in a picture book.\n\nOota: So, after coming to Tokyo, I thought the whole city was super bright and I didn’t like that at first. It wasn’t the Japan I knew. I love nature, so when I wanted to escape from the city, I went to Kamakura alone. There’s a lot of pollen and I have hay fever this year.\n\nIse: Same here.\n\n— Wada-san also said she had hay fever. By the way, Oota-san, what’s the meaning of “naive”?\n\nOota: Layla-chan started answering normally and I was like, what?\n\nIse: Aren’t you smart?\n\nOota: It means… “simple”? As in, you’re asking a simple question?\n\n— That’s right! Since you’re both from Hokkaido, there must be times when you just get each other?\n\nOota: What. No!\n\nIse: I don’t think so, our hometowns aren’t even close.\n\nOota: But we’re always thinking the same thing.\n\nIse: Not necessarily. (laugh)\n\nOota: We buy the same drinks and stuff.\n\nIse: Ah, we often wear the same t-shirts to lessons accidentally. Maybe we’re just fond of the same t-shirts that we got, but we always wear them at the same time. Our seniors said that we’re making it hard for instructors to tell us apart so we should stop. So on lesson days, I’m telling her what I’ll be wearing. (laugh)\n\nOota: Lately, we’re even wearing jumpers in the same colour. We understand each other!\n\n— What kind of person is Wada Ayaka-san?\n\nIse: A goddess.\n\nOota: The Statue of Liberty. The one in America.\n\n(Translator’s note: The Statue of Liberty is called “Goddess of Liberty” in Japanese. There are many replicas of the statue, including one in Tokyo. )\n\nIse: She always talks to us, right?\n\nOota: Yeah, she’s the senior who talks to us the most. She’s so kind.\n\n— What makes her a goddess?\n\nIse: Everything.\n\nOota: The way she stands, her aura, her presence. She’s out of this world.\n\nIse: When I joined, I thought there was still at least half a year until she graduated. Time flew by and now there’s less than three months left. I realized this recently, and it makes me feel somewhat frustrated and sometimes sad.\n\nOota: I’m so happy I got to join before Wada-san graduated. The other seniors want to keep things the way Wada-san made them for us, but Wada-san herself doesn’t want this. I’m not sure what we should do.\n\n— Wada-san is that kind of person, after all. She wants you to create your own ANGERME.\n\nOota: I can’t think of what’s coming after Wada-san graduates… Oh no, I’m so sad. I’m looking forward to what’s next, but I’m just so, so sad right now. I want to cherish this time with her.\n\n— Finally, let’s talk about your debut single. What are your thoughts?\n\nIse: I still can’t believe I’m debuting. I don’t even feel like I’ve joined the group. Both of us are dancing in the middle as it’s our debut song, and we have solo parts, but…\n\n— You’re even doing release events right now.\n\nIse: It’s unbelievable. It was my first time shooting a music video. For the solo lip scenes, we watched our seniors shooting theirs and learned many things. The music videos we watch, it takes an entire day to shoot and create them.\n\nOota: Singing this song made me super happy, but it’s Wada-san’s last single. Our first single is also our last one with Wada-san. I don’t know how to feel. I’m happy, but I’m sad.\n\n— How do you feel about the song itself?\n\nIse: Koi wa Accha Accha has an Indian sound, which is fresh for ANGERME. “Accha” means “that’s good” in Hindi. In the chorus, we’re singing “Accha Accha~” and doing the “mochotto dance.” Take a good look at it! I hope it’ll become viral.\n\nOota: We’re always singing “Accha Accha,” I hope you’ll remember that word. The song is super catchy and you should listen to it a lot.\n\n— What’s your opinion on Yume mita 15?\n\nOota: It’s really Wada-san’s last single. Former member Fukuda Kanon-san wrote the lyrics and included references to the past. It must be a very important song for Wada-san, and for us, it’s also one-of-a-kind.\n\nIse: I’m not in any of the songs referenced in the lyrics, so it doesn’t bring up as many memories as it does for my seniors. We’re dancing to it while remembering the precious things Wada-san taught us since we joined. I’m sure we’ll be performing this song at Nippon Budokan on June 18 and I want to convey those feelings to fans as we’re singing it.\n\nOota: The line that goes “You’re really starting from now on” is for Wada-san’s new start, but it’s also meaningful for the two of us as we’re starting out. I’ll keep it in my heart and continue working hard.\n\n— You must be excited for your Nippon Budokan concert.\n\nIse: I went to Budokan for the first time for Iikubo Haruna-san’s graduation concert. I can’t imagine that I’ll be going there for a second time to perform myself. Thinking about me standing in the middle of that stage makes me nervous, but it’s Wada-san’s last concert, so I need to give it my all.\n\nOota: A lot of people will be at Budokan; I wonder if I can perform while looking around like that. I’m very excited, but before that, we’re doing our hall tour. Until now, Nakanishi-san was injured so had to perform with 11 members, but we can finally perform with 12 members. We’ll be going to many places and I hope you’ll burn these concerts with 12 members into your memory.\n\nSource: CD Journal, May-June 2019\n\nThis interview was initially posted on Quick Japan Web on October 2, 2020.\n\nNote: “Mikitty” doesn’t refer to Fujimoto Miki (Mikitty), but to Mikitty Honmono, a member of the gay idol group Nichoume no Sakigake Coming Out.\n\n“I can live for myself.” “I don’t have to give up because I’m gay.”\n\nWada Ayaka is an idol who is against dictating what female idols should be and pushes for letting them be who they want to be.\n\nMikitty Honmono is a gay idol in an industry where the lines between male and female are clearly defined.\n\nIn recent years, Mikitty Honmono’s group Nichoume no Sakigake Coming Out performed at the world’s biggest idol festival, TOKYO IDOL FESTIVAL. There’s also AKB48’s Kashiwagi Yuki, who announced that she wouldn’t be graduating even at 30 years old. Two Negicco members have decided to continue working as idols after getting married, a choice that was supported by fans. One could think the idol industry is becoming more diverse. What do our interviewees have to say on this topic?\n\n“Many people expected me to say funny things because I’m gay.”\n\n— Mikitty Honmono, what’s your impression of Wada?\n\nMikitty: I started out in the Shinjuku Nichoume-based idol unit Nichohalo, in which we danced to Hello! Project songs. Since Ayacho (Wada Ayaka) debuted as a member of S/mileage around the time I founded Nichohalo and started performing on stage, it’s like we’re colleagues from the same era.\n\nI watched her growth from her audition, as if she were my little sister. She used to have more of an airhead character, but as the leader of ANGERME, she brought the members together and wasn’t afraid to state her opinion. I was surprised she became such an amazing woman.\n\nThis might sound bad, but there are people who, after graduating and going solo, are just rubbing their old fans the right way. Then, there’s Ayacho who puts her own words on music and expresses herself. I think she’s a remarkable woman.\n\n— Wada, how do you feel about this?\n\nWada: Idol groups are split into categories, male and female with clearly defined roles. In society, there are people who are different and don’t belong in neither category. That’s why I think Mikitty Honmono’s group, its existence, is absolutely wonderful.\n\n— You both felt suffocated because of gender role expectations. How do you relate this to being an “idol”?\n\nMikitty: I figured out I was gay when I fell in love with a guy for the first time. I was in middle school, and he wasn’t gay, so I couldn’t confess to him. Starting from there, at school and work, I’ve given up on a lot of things, including jobs, because I’m gay.\n\nIt was when I first stood on stage that I realized I had given up on so much with the excuse of being gay. After this, I wanted to lead a life where I wouldn’t give up because I’m gay. So, I created a group with this concept: “Even if you’re gay, you can be an idol”. This implies that not only gay people, but anyone, can be anything.\n\n— In a past interview, you said that you felt frustrated as you were pressured to be funny because you’re gay. Could you tell us more?\n\nMikitty: Many gay people you see on TV are hilarious and come up with great jokes one after another. There’s also this idea that Shinjuku Nichoume is full of fun and happy people. It may be partly why I’ve met lots of people who expected me to say funny stuff when I told them I was gay. I thought I needed to meet their expectations, so I put on a fake bright, funny act.\n\nThe truth is that I’m not always happy because I’m gay. I worry over trivial things and mess up like everyone else. I’m making music and showing a larger-than-life version of myself as a way to make people understand this.\n\nThat uncomfortable feeling when someone says: “I want gay friends.”\n\n— Nichoume no Sakigake Coming Out mostly sings about youth and nostalgia, topics anyone can relate to. Do you avoid using “gay” as a gimmick consciously?\n\nMikitty: It’s not that I avoid it consciously, I’m just expressing myself as I am. I don’t think “gay” or “not gay.” I write songs as a human being, so they come out like this naturally.\n\nSomething that made me feel uncomfortable was that, when I had many idol friends, a lot of them wanted to hang out with me because I’m gay. They couldn’t ask girls for relationship advice and couldn’t be friends with guys because of work, so I was like their go-to person for advice.\n\nWhile I’m glad they were relying on me in a way, it does feel a bit weird when people I’ve never talked to want to be friends with me because I’m gay. I’d be so happy if they said they wanted to be friends with me because I’m Mikitty Honmono. If they say I can understand both men’s and women’s feelings because I’m gay, now, it depends on the person.\n\nWada: Many people around me have said that they wanted to be friends with gay people, yet most of them also rejected homosexuality. I do remember wondering if it was the way average people of my generation thought, and I felt it was strange.\n\nAt that time, I also questioned my own sexuality. I’ve liked girls in the past, and I spent 25 years of my life not knowing my sexuality or where I stood.\n\nListening to Mikitty Honmono’s story helped me put things in order. Now I understand my feelings and the meaning of others’ words, and it’s like the fog has lifted.\n\nRegardless of gender, and race or nationality, we’re all human. So, why are we put into boxes, people who reject and others who are rejected? Your story made me think that, because of the “gays are like this” box, these people don’t see the person that you are. It was these kinds of words that confused me.\n\nNatural as a “narrow” requirement for idols\n\n— Wada, how did you feel about your gender role?\n\nWada: While I was confused about my sexuality, I also felt strong pressure to act in a certain way because I’m a woman. In some cases, you can’t do anything about it because of social constructs, but it has never aligned with my feelings.\n\nStudying art in university made me realize how restricted my world was. I questioned things I found strange. Through art, I understood the importance of expressing these contradictions in my own words, but I just couldn’t do it. The reason is that, as a woman, I’m not supposed to speak out. I should conform. I was confused by these ideas that were forced upon me.\n\n— You were criticized for wearing red lipstick and advised not to open your mouth too wide on pictures, which must have played a part in this. I have this impression that you took a lot of pictures with your mouth wide open after going solo.\n\nWada: Just like your schoolbag “has to be red” because you’re a girl, I was forced upon this view that opening your mouth too wide isn’t “womanly.” Also, as my job was being an idol, I was required to be “natural.”\n\nOrange is one of my favourite lipstick colours, but that wasn’t “natural.” I had no choice but to wear light pink, so I asked myself what “natural” even meant. These thoughts kept piling up, and I realized the world I was in had a very narrow definition of an idol.\n\nI personally like having black hair, yet, I felt weird about it because I was imposed the idea that “having black hair means I’m conventional.” Not only gender, but occupation, nationality, and even race… People aren’t defined by these boxes. It occurred to me at some time.\n\n— The idol industry is hard to define as it has a wide range of concepts and song types and people have different views on what an idol is, so you felt uncomfortable to be forced upon specific views.\n\nWada: I’m using the “idol” name to raise questions or point out problems I had in my 15 years as an idol, one by one. By doing this, I hope I can make the current “idol” box more colourful.\n\nIdols are performers, so they’re definitely playing a role in creating the world they’re bringing to life. I believe that, because they have an opportunity to express themselves, they should have as many choices as possible.\n\nTwo labels to choose from: “idol” or “activist”*\n\n*Translator’s note: Word play. 活動家 means “activist”, but can be interpreted as “active professional” (as in an artist who does multiple unspecified jobs, like an idol.)\n\n— When you started your solo activities, you made a powerful statement on your official site about being an “idol”. What was your thought process behind this choice?\n\nWada: I thought about what I wanted to do and hesitated between two labels: “idol” and “activist.” I want to express many different things, and it was easier to convey them within the “idol” box. So I called myself an “idol.”\n\n— How does Mikitty Honmono feel about rules in idol groups? You were once a Hello! Project fan, so I’d like to hear your opinion from this standpoint. Fans must think some things can’t be changed.\n\nMikitty: It’s important to keep in mind that idols are human too, but every group has its own style, so they can’t just do what they want.\n\nFor example, if you’re joining a group that’s selling a conventional image, you should be aware from the start you’re not supposed to wear dark red lipstick and thick eyeliner. You can’t change that, you know. It’d be better if you joined a group that fits your image.\n\nWhat makes it hard is that humans change every day. We want to try new things, have a new haircut and wear new makeup. When you reach that point, you can graduate happy and take your next step in life. I fully approve of that.\n\nI don’t think setting rules is a bad thing in itself. Our group has some too, and they’re actually stricter than any other group’s.\n\nWada: Really? What kinds of rules do you have?\n\nMikitty: First off, since we want to keep a good balance when members are standing next to each other, you’re not allowed to change hairstyle without the producer’s approval. In addition, going out at night and drinking alcohol in public is basically forbidden, so we don’t even hang out in Shinjuku Nichoume.\n\nWada: So you’re discipling yourselves. Why do you have such rules?\n\nMikitty: As the producer, I have an image of what an idol is. I set the rules and decided we’d go along at the beginning.\n\nThe reason why we don’t go to Nichoume or drink in public is that I don’t want people to assume that us being gay means we always go to Shinjuku Nichoume or drink like we’re partying. I used to be strangely influenced by what I saw in the media and don’t want to reinforce such stereotypes. I set these rules with the original members, so I’m thinking the daily rules will change, though.\n\n“We always aimed to perform at TOKYO IDOL FESTIVAL.”\n\nWada: It’s interesting seeing our similarities and differences. Mikitty Honmono is disciplining himself to reach his ideal image of an idol. As for me, because I was restrained and repressed, I’m heading towards liberation. The way we’re expressing ourselves is different because we have different standpoints and thoughts.\n\nMikitty: I felt more restrained back when I was hiding that I was gay. I feel more liberated nowadays, when I made it clear that I’m gay and fans tell me: “I don’t care about your sexuality, I love Mikitty Honmono.”\n\nWe set those rules together so we could be the best idols, so they’re close to our heart. I believe we feel this way because we set them ourselves.\n\n— In 2017, Nichoume no Sakigake Coming Out took part in the world’s biggest idol festival, TOKYO IDOL FESTIVAL (TIF). That was an important step for diversity in the idol industry.\n\nMikitty: We took part in different idol festivals before that, but we were just never invited to TIF. We always aimed to perform at TIF.\n\nOne of the ways to perform at TIF was through an audition where fans gave you points, but we didn’t want to put a burden on our fans so we didn’t go for that. We decided we’d keep working hard until TIF contacted us themselves and recognized us as idols.\n\nEvery year, we were always excited to know if we could take part in this year’s festival. When we ended up not going, we’d just tell ourselves to work hard for next year. The day we heard we would be performing, we were so happy. We told each other that we had finally broken down the wall. Fans were also super happy and it was like a big celebration.\n\n— In retrospect, what was the meaning of gay idols performing at TIF?\n\nMikitty: We hope to eventually live in a society where the expression “gay idols” doesn’t exist. If groups without gender restrictions keep popping up, then “gay idols” won’t be special anymore and the expression will die out. So, the fact that TIF invited us to perform was a step towards this goal. I want TIF to be one of the leaders that make the idol industry more prosperous.\n\n“I’m not an idol for fans’ sake, but for my own.”\n\n— There’s this firm image of the female idol industry as a place for young idols only. Yet, in the last few years, we’ve seen AKB48’s Kashiwagi Yuki say she won’t be graduating, even at 30. Negicco members Nao☆ and Megu decided to keep working as idols after getting married, with fans supporting them. Many fans don’t care about age or marriage and keep backing their idols. What are your thoughts about this?\n\nWada: Everyone, no matter their age, has an idea of who they want to be. I think it’s great that you can keep being an idol at any age and after marriage and that your choice is supported.\n\nMikitty: I also think idols are ageless. Nao☆ and Megu made a fantastic choice and I congratulated them. In their case, they had been working as respectable idols and humans and had a lot of support. That’s why, incidentally, they were congratulated by everyone. That doesn’t mean everyone should keep working as an idol after marriage.\n\nI’m a big fan of Nacchi (former member of Morning Musume Abe Natsumi). Even if she got married, in my heart, she’ll forever be an idol. No matter how old they are or if they’re married, idols are living in our heart.\n\nFans and the public will react differently depending on the way you handled yourself in your work, if you were earnest or not. As a fan, I’ve seen idols who stopped, although I was hoping they’d continue. Ayacho is still an idol, so her fans must be happy, and I think she’s a ray of hope for other idols.\n\n— Wada, have you ever thought about “meeting fans’ expectations”, as Mikitty Honmono discussed?\n\nWada: I felt bound to “idol” as my job and to “woman” as my gender, so it’d be hard meeting those expectations. If I were to continue working as the “idol” so many people are expecting, I’d probably be banned from having relationships and wouldn’t be free to do various things.\n\nI’d rather show you have the choice to live for yourself. I’m not working as an idol only for fans, 100% for fans, but because I want to do it myself.\n\nMany fans from my time in ANGERME support my way of thinking and I felt warmly accepted by them. After going solo, some people started supporting me because I expressed these thoughts, which I find reassuring.\n\nMikitty: From a fan standpoint, I don’t want to see idols suppress themselves. I used to desperately put on a funny act when I’m really a gloomy person. After I showed my real self, fans told me that they like the natural Mikitty Honmono better. Right now, Ayacho is very natural and wonderful, so I’m thinking your fans are happy too.\n\n“Diversity is spreading and becoming the right thing, and it’s scary“\n\n— Everyone should be who they want to be, and others should respect that. Don’t you feel this leads to “diversity”?\n\nWada: I believe the ideal society is diverse, and I want to be a part of that. Nonetheless, there are people who are embarrassed to express themselves and I can’t force them.\n\nWhat I want to do is support someone’s move towards something they’re aiming for, no matter what shape it takes. It’d be fantastic if we lived in a society where everyone around us were supportive of that.\n\nMikitty: In my case, I was lucky to have family members, friends and coworkers who accepted I was gay. I also had fans who accepted it when I became an idol.\n\nStill, I have plenty of friends who can’t tell their parents, aren’t acknowledged or can’t come out. Like Ayacho said, you’re the one who decides whether you want to express yourself or not, but some people want to do it and can’t.\n\nThat’s why I try not to say that you should “live your life the way you want to”; it weighs on people. It’s a bit scary to think the word “diversity” is spreading and becoming the right thing.\n\n— Based on your own experiences, do you have any advice for people who want to take a new step, but are giving up because it’s hard?\n\nMikitty: Everyone is scared to take the first step, but by doing it, whether it be a good or a bad experience, you’ll learn to love yourself. I didn’t like myself when I gave up on everything, but by trying new things, I learned to appreciate myself little by little.\n\nEven if you fail, there might be something good waiting for you when you look down. That’s how life works.\n\nWada: My opinion is that you don’t know something if you haven’t tried it. First, you have to try. Then, you can continue or change your ways. Thinking back, I’ve said things in the past that I find embarrassing and there are many things I only knew when I tried them.\n\nSometimes, I feel down because of people’s reactions to what I say, so I strive to be stronger. I’d like to hold my beliefs without letting others’ reaction get to me. Every day, I read books and learn continuously to achieve this.\n\nSource: https://qjweb.jp/feature/40683/"
