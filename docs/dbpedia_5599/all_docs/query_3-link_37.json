        "text": "This is SPC final review Part 2.\n\n4. Battle and Group orientation\n\nAgain, before adding member (Beat), the fighting is better than Beat’s involvement. Melody and Rhythm have good coordination in the beginning of the series. Their combined attacks (like passionate harmony and berither attacks) obtain the similar level as FwPC series. I would say SPC has more potential to be another FwPc series more than group series like FPC and HCPC. Apparently, the pattern is two aggressive (Melody and Rhythm) and two defensive (Beat and Muse). This pattern is the same as HCPC. However, there is no interaction between Beat and Muse. Muse only has some coordination with Rhythm, and Beat is just there for defense and finisher. Beat and Muse attacks are less than Melody and Rhythm, which cause the battle spotlight always go to Melody and Rhythm. Especially, this series heavily promote HibiKana that Beat and Muse can’t stand out except their own eps. In the movie, Beat intend not to help Melody and Rhythm when they are in danger, and Muse take her own sweet time on joining in the fight. Even SPC shows good coordination(harmony) in henshin, passionate harmony and CT attack, you can’t feel that they are united.\n\nThe unbalanced number of SPC attack also cause bad group orientation. Before SPC, or even SmPC, although some series fond to pink leader, they have equal or similar number of attacks to other Precure. Let’s see the example in HCPC and SPC.\n\nHCPC (* I only count those attacks which are often used)\n\nBlossom:\n\n- Blossom Shower\n\n- Blossom Flower Storm\n\n- Blossom Shoot\n\n- Blossom Impact\n\n- Pink Forte Wave\n\nMarine:\n\n- Marine Shoot\n\n- Marine Impact\n\n- Marine Dive\n\n- Marine Dynamite\n\n- Blue Forte Wave\n\nBlossom and Marine\n\n- Precure Dynamite\n\n- Precure W Shoot\n\n- Precure Floral Power Fortissimo\n\nSunshine:\n\n- Sunflower Aegis (Impact)\n\n- Sunflower Protection\n\n- Sunshine Flash (shoot)\n\n- Sunshine Dynamite\n\n- Sunshine Impact\n\n- Gold Forte Bust\n\nMoonlight:\n\n- Moonlight Reflection\n\n- Moonlight Silver Impact\n\n- Silver Forte Wave\n\n- Floral Power Fortissimo\n\nSunshine and Moonlight\n\n- Precure Floral Power Fortissimo\n\n4 cures:\n\n- Heartcatch Orchestra\n\nSPC:\n\nMelody:\n\n- Musical Rondo\n\n- Miracle Arpeggio\n\nRhythm\n\n- Musical Rondo\n\n- Fantastic Piacere\n\nMelody and Rhythm\n\n- Passionato Harmony\n\n- Musical Rondo\n\n- Super Quartet\n\nBeat:\n\n- Beat Sonic\n\n- Beat Barrier\n\n- Heartful Beat Rock (Musical Rondo)\n\nMuse\n\n- Shining Circle\n\n- Sparkling Shower\n\n4 cures:\n\n- Suite Session Ensemble (Crescendo)\n\n- Passionato Harmony\n\nCan you see the difference between them? In HCPC team, their combine attacks are flexible, because besides forte waves, they also obtain the same small attacks like Impact, dynamite (Moonlight I believe she also has dynamite, for example the battle in ep 1) and shoot (not sure for Moonlight, but I believe she also has), they can have dual, triple or quartet attacks with these attacks. In addition, in ep 38, Blossom and Marine, Sunshine and Moonlight can shoot ff together, which makes the group coordination richer. Even Sunshine holds different weapon and Moonlight possess greater power than the other three, we still can feel that they are in a group.\n\nOn the other hand, in SPC team, the main weakness is the insufficient attacks for Beat and Muse. Other than their final moves, other attacks are unable to kill (purify) the enemy. We never see Beat Sonic can combine with Shining Circle or incorporate with Berither attacks. How about the Rondo attacks? Up to Beat, as Heartful Beat rock is no difference from Musical Rondo, so hers can go with Melody and Rhythm. However, Sparkling Shower is unique from others, like Gold Forte Burst to forte waves. For Sunshine, since she still has the ability to cast ff with Moonlight, Gold Forte Burst can consider as another Forte attack. On the contrary, Sparkling Shower has to put separately from the rondos. Even they attack together, the relationship between Muse and the other three is like Passion to 3 FPCs. As for the Group attack, like Passionato Harmony and Ensemble, they can cast without 4 members. Passionato Harmony cast with only Melody and Rhythm are stronger than 4 of them (please see some of the eps and movie). The Ensemble….as long as three members can pilot CT (I am not wrong, right??), they don’t even need to be 4 members. So…who is the redundant cure? Beat? Muse? For story wise, Beat is the redundant one, but for battle wise, Muse is the redundant one.\n\nThe next fighting scheme we are concern on is physical fight. I still can see Melody and Rhythm continuous punches and kicks occasionally, but Beat and Muse….Muse fights more when the mask on, and Beat…perhaps just few eps with a kick, and the fight with Major 3 in the movie. Generally, owing to the writer’s unfamiliarity of writing anime scripts, the physical fight in this SPC is less than HCPC, however, it is better than FPC sometimes. Before adding Beat (again?), SPC + Muse fights more like Precure we normally see. (but the level is lower than FwPC series, YPC5 & HCPC).\n\nPrecure fight is already not so great, but the cadre and bosses’ fighting tactics are even worse. Just answer this question: How many eps do we see SPC vs Minor Trio physically? Only once in my memory. SPC never fight against Siren physically for sure. They (only Muse actually) also fight against Mephisto only once. Noise is twice at the end. Noise, plus Howling is reasonably to fight less physically because they are boss class enemies. Mephisto needs to persuade more than fight due to the setting change. However, why SPC don’t fight against cadres, who meets often, always?\n\nMoreover, I never see them win from physical fight (I only can see them win in note collections). FPC still have Labyrinth duo/trio fight for me…this series…even villain fight is below my expectation.\n\n5. Music\n\nSince the series is related to Music, I talk briefly about the BGM and image songs in this series. Firstly, I disagree the voice change for Hummy while singing,, it doesn’t match her character. (Siren can sing in her own voice, why not for Hummy?) For the BGM, I only impressed in the henshin, rondo & berither attacks and the one in last ep. CT attack?….it is fine but not my favourite. Basically, the style of BGM is holy and classical. Comparing to Pc5, this one tends to use soprano (or vocal) chorus for BGM arrangement instead of instrumental orchestra for PC5 BGM. Then, for the image song, Hibiki’s style is energetic and lively, both songs looks similar style to Love or Itsuki. The best image song for this series goes to Kanade. Hers has two distinct style. Her first song is Andante and cantabile, whereas her second song is cute and vivid. Ellen’s generally are rock and roll, I prefer to her first image song, which songs has the similar melody to her image BGM ( perhaps it is from her BGM song). The second song…I only remember there are a lot “Beat Love”. Ako’s….I don’t have much impression even I listen to it for a few times…the song is quite plain in my opinion. However, their group songs are not very nice, comparing to previous seasons. (but Mayu and Aya’s songs are better than previous two seasons)\n\nOverall, the BGM and image songs are well done, some of them are significant.\n\n6. Question\n\nIt is question time now! In this problematic series, I have a couple of questions to ask.\n\na. Why Hibiki and Kanade have to transform in pair, whereas others can transform alone?\n\nI think it is a common question after watching ep 22. Initially, esp in ep 19, Hibiki and Kanade cannot transform alone. Nevertheless, with Beat’s join-in, this rule has to be broken, otherwise they can’t transform with four members. (i.e. after ep 22, hibiki and Kanade don’t need to help promoting Goseiger XD)\n\nb. Does Aphrodite really plan for hiding 4 clefs inside the Modules?\n\nAccording to ep 1, I would say no. When Mephisto changes the score into the minor song, it is an urgent case that Aphrodite has to quickly scatter all the notes by hook or by crook to prevent from Mephisto. She doesn’t even have the time to change. Another contradiction where I had mentioned earlier is the period between Mephisto’s invasion to Ako being Precure. Ako become Precure in the middle of the invasion, (in ep 37, when she saw her father announcing the born of minor song, she close the “TV”, and then Dodori comes.) so Aphrodite’s statement can’t be true.\n\nc. The extent question to Q2, how Dodori meets Ako?\n\nThat’s simple, by Otokichi’s organ song. In ep 17, the notes are gathered while Otokichi is playing the organ, so it also can apply for Dodori reaching the church through music and meet Ako.\n\nd. Is Minor Land an artificial country?\n\nBefore ep 36-37, no, after that, yes. However, my answer is still no from the beginning to the end. According to those explanation in ep 36-37, this country is made by Mephisto (not Noise, he can’t have the ability that he build the country within the seal). If Mephisto is defeated and changed back to Major King, his magic should be released by the time he is defeated. Ok…even Falsetto may maintain the country, but by the time he is swallowed, or the time when SPC invade, the country should be extinguished. But! We can’t see the end of Minor Land in the last ep! Even Noise is purified! If it is an artificial country, the country will be collapsed like Eternal.\n\ne. Is Noise really important to the story?\n\nIf we compare him to the previous last boss, he doesn’t look like an important character. The first reason is that he appears too late. Previously, the last boss appeared in ep 20+, before or after the mid-battle (ep 23-24). Ideally, his name should be mentioned in the beginning of the series, like FwPCs, 5GG and SmPC. The time he appears is similar to Norza’s appearance, however, Norza is a cadre, not the boss. She can appear in such a time because:\n\n- Precure is getting stronger\n\n- Help to steal infinity, or supporting Labyrinth duo\n\nBefore ep 36, there is no sign for Noise. How about ep 29? The headphone comes from nowhere. It can be interpreted as that monster in the forest, Howling, or even Mephisto did this. There is also no scene for the relationship between Falsetto and Noise, which can support the storyline in ep 36. Mephisto has no idea about his big boss, as if not knowing your supervisor in the company. How can a so-called subordinate Falsetto know the boss more than his “supervisor”-Mephisto? To introduce the boss suddenly in the later eps, this kind of plot can’t be skipped.\n\nWhat are Noise’s contributions to the series? Perhaps…it is his growth-from angry bird to dragon, and then humanoid…relationship wise…from Otokichi in ep 37 to Otokichi & CT in ep 45, the same trend as Kaoruko. He doesn’t have much contribution to his servants, just know to brainwash and give power to Falsetto once…His first appearance is supposed in the Movie, but he doesn’t contribute any in the Movie. (only mentioned by Howling) In fact, he is a shadow character from the Movie. In order to link to the TV series, he has to be active in TV series as well. Nevertheless, his activity in the TV series breaks many TV initial settings, resulting in the plot inconsistency after ep 35. If this character never exists in TV series, as the director said, the series will end in different direction. Alternatively, if they plan him to be the boss in the beginning, they should give him more space in the earlier eps.\n\nf. Is the kidnap rope designed for Fairy Tones?\n\nI think it is one of the funniest setting in this series. The enemy uses score ropes to kidnap SPC, and Fairy Tones mean to break it. Yes, this special setup is according to the score and scale, but it is weird that the enemy design the catching device for the heroine’s fairy to break. Also, only Fairy tone can break it, Hummy and SPC can’t break it.\n\ng. Is Siren/Ellen good at guitar or singing?\n\nFrom how they describe Ellen, she is supposed to be good at singing. Does she need to be good at guitar in order to be Cure Beat? I think it should be Cure Beat’s criteria, otherwise how she cast Beat Sonic and Barrier in the battle?(at least she needs to know how to make nice sound from the guitar) How many times we see her playing guitar in the series? Ep 6 (just holding the guitar), the sponsor scene and ….the last ep. That’s what I remember. As there is no description about her guitar history, her guitar skill may be….talented? or just because she is Cure Beat, so she needs to play guitar?\n\nh. What are the relationship between Minor Trio, Mephisto and Siren/Ellen?\n\nIf, according to the later eps of the series, Minor Trio already know Mephisto and Ellen before they become Minor Trios, these guys should be very close to the singing princess and the royal family, that is, Aphrodite, Otokichi and Ako should know them. After ep 35, except Mephisto (and Melody, who know nothing about them), no one bother to persuade them…They are neither the bodyguard of Major Royal family (otherwise Aphrodite should response in ep 43) nor Siren’s friend. Siren knows them when they are in Minor Land. Mephisto become their leader also in Minor Land period. How the last 10 eps can convince us that they are in very close relationship?\n\ni. What is the real size of Aphrodite and Mephisto?\n\nI don’t know if you have noticed, in last ep, there is a scene where Otokichi is way smaller than them, and SPC are shorter than them. However, in ep 35, movie or few eps before the last ep, they are in proper size. If the giant sizes are their size in Major Land, when Ako grow up, she will be giant?\n\nj. Who control Minor’s headphones?\n\nIn the beginning of the series to ep 28, Mephisto controls it (you can’t deny it because there is nobody besides him in the brainwash scene); In ep 29, Golem controls the headphone; After ep 35, the right of control goes to Noise. In Movie, Howling also can use the headphone! The target they control are interesting:\n\nMephisto- Siren, Minor trios, Hummy\n\nGolem, Howling-SPC, Aphrodite, Mephisto(?)\n\nNoise-Hummy,(I remember ep 47 in his stomach) Seika, Waon\n\nDo you notice something? Mephisto mainly uses for Minor people; Golem/Howling use for Major rulers and SPC and Noise uses for mascot and sub characters. In the list, there is a question mark for Mephisto because we never see Noise brainwashes him personally. We only know that Mephisto goes to the forest and become Minor king…so most likely is Golem…it seems Golem/Howling look more like last bosses…\n\nk. What happen to Siren past?\n\nIn ep 14, the story stops up to Siren meeting a pink-colored cat (forgot the name). We know that this character is disguised by Mephisto’s paper doll, then? She never meets this character (and her gang) in my past memory, even at the end of the series. How she meets Mephisto is unknown…he goes to her house and brainwash her or he brainwashes her after the contest? In ep 21, it should be a good chance to round up the past and persuade Siren, but Hummy is too airhead that she forgot those characters as well…\n\nIf I look into further, there will be more and more questions…like Muse black suit and little Muse…\n\n7. SPC vs Other anime\n\nThere are a couple of anime related to Music, such as idol anime like Kirarin Revolution, Macross series, Nodame etc…\n\nI choose 3 series comparing to SPC.\n\nA. Macross (7)\n\nThere are two groups for fighting against enemy. One is the real military force, another one is singing force. In the first Macross, Lin Minmay is singing for persuading Zentradi, while others are fighting against the fighers. In SPC, the arrangement is similar-Hummy & Siren are singers and SPC are fighting force. In Macross 7, Basara refuses to use missile (fighting force), he just want to sing and touch others, including monsters. In an ep, when he knows his song becomes a weapon, he is furious and puzzled. In SPC, Hummy is like Minmay(or Ranka in F?) and Siren is like Basara(or Shirley in F?). Siren case, of course, is different from Basara, but Beat appearance has Basara image (rock and roll) However, in SPC, the staff didn’t make use of the difference of fighting force (SPC) to singing force (singing princess)\n\nB. Onegai My Melody series.\n\nThe series I always mention in my SPC reviews. SPC systems are very similar to OMM, such as collecting notes, black and white mascots’ relationship (Melody and Kuromi) and the atmosphere in SPC ep 21 (like the last few eps in OMM). In OMM, they (Melody and Kuromi) collect the notes from people (any, including the main heroine), the notes’ colour depends on people’s satisfaction of their dream (opened by Kuromi). We don’t know who wins in each ep. Nevertheless, in SPC, we are very sure that SPC will win because Minor trio change the note to Negatone and Hummy changes it back at the end and collected, unless Minor trio didn’t use for Negatone. In addition, there are specific numbers of notes for OMM to collect, i.e. there is a goal, unlike SPC, the staff like to start and end the note collection as they wish. In OMM season 1, both Melody and Kuromi have to collect 100 notes. How they obtain the 100 notes in just 47 ep (48 onwards they need to deal with Hiiragi)? If you had watched it, you will know that sometimes they can collect more than 1 note from a person. (eg. Shiroyama) When the story goes to the end, where Melody and Kuromi are almost finished collecting, Melody, even how airhead she is, she also count the notes. For Kuromi, because the notes are collected (swallowed) by Baku, they can’t take out the note, unless Baku vomit them out. In SPC, Minor Trio still do something to the notes (either to Negatone or putting them into the score), but SPC do nothing after the collection. We only can see Hummy always peek into Fairy tones’ head…(Fairy tones: Ah~don’t peek!)SPC is lack of excitement for notes collection.\n\nHummy and Siren relationship is definitely more serious than Melody and Kuromi, however, I buy the reason why Kuromi hates Melody more than Siren hates Hummy. If Siren hates Hummy due to jealousy, she can fight against (by her own will) Hummy to the end, like how Kuromi to Melody. (She hates Melody also due to jealousy, but in different way) Also, in SPC, sometimes Although Siren said she dislikes Hummy’s airhead (inconsideration), the staffs didn’t elaborate more on that. We only know their past mainly in ep 14, and some shots in ep 23 & 24, which is too little. It doesn’t need to be so detailed like OMM (Kuromi mentions and notes down almost every ep), but as for Siren/Ellen character development, they should tell us more.\n\nLastly, the atmosphere in SPC ep 21-opening a dark concert is almost the same as what OMM does in the last few eps. For this idea, SPC does better than OMM by having more members involved in the concert, to form a orchestra, unlike OMM which is a solo performance. Actually, this idea can reuse in ep 40+ when Falsetto completes the score, but Falsetto seems not bother to hire people and hold a concert.\n\nAs for the music knowledge, I had said before, OMM does much better than SPC, by researching the type of musical instruments, the violin score, C Major scale and creating a duet performance using electronic guitar and violin. On the contrary, SPC make a big mistake in the note collection-bass clef included, whereas there is no bass clef in the score, and the score is not for vocal to sing (at least the score is tough for Bassdra and Baritone). For the score appearance, OMM presents it well that the audience hardly spot the mistake. In OMM, the heroine and villain doesn’t have any score book to put the notes. Melody and Kuromi just collect them into their treasure boxes (but I am not sure if it is a musical box)or Baku. Another special arrangement for OMM score is that the score is not visible for everybody. For Melody, only Uta, Melody and Mariland people can see the score (Uta can see due to the rainbow strings tied to Melody); for Kuromi side, besides Kuromi and Baku, only Hiiragi can see (due to his genius). That’s why they don’t need a score book like SPC. The score book itself is unfair to SPC side because the score book is in Minor group, they can arrange the notes but SPC can’t. Also, SPC never plan for taking the book back in the whole series, which make me shocked…\n\nFor the story wise, SPC is surely lose to OMM because SPC can’t even win HCPC, yes, the writer of OMM is the same person as HCPC.\n\nC. Symphogear\n\nWhen I watch this series, I thought the staff of this anime is going to comment how bad SPC is via its story. The naming has so many coincidence! Enemy is called Noise, the main characters’ name also are Hibiki and Kanade (only Kanade is died in ep 1), and then Tsubasa is Blossom ( I know you get what I mean), Kanade is Dark Precure, Hibiki is Madoka….the seiyuu is not the main point anyway. I only watched up to ep 4, so I can’t talk much about this series. However, they really put in the element which SPC should have-singing while fighting! Noise really means noise, the creatures create noisy sound while they invade. Comparing to SPC, excluding they hold weapon, the fighting quality is better than SPC. The staff of Symphogear doesn’t really meant to emphasis the music theme like SPC-having music town, musical weapon etc. In fact, it has the same theme as SPC, music and friendship. In Symphogear, the music theme applies more in the fighting part and concert, while they elaborate the friendship part in the storyline/character development, like how Tsubasa recovers from Kanade’s death and the interaction between Hibiki and Tsubasa. I don’t know if it is better than SPC for the whole series, but up to ep 4, they interpret what SPC lacks.\n\nFinally…I finish this lengthy review. If you feel it is too long, you can skip my ep 43 onwards review in my story section, because most of the content are my grumbles…I hope you enjoy reading /scanning my review…and hopefully SmPC last review won’t be so long…"
