In their imaginative play, they face numerous whimsical scenarios, including building a giant robot from the blanket fort.

Their adventure concludes happily when Ignacio’s dad announces they’re having tacos for dinner, much to their excitement.\n\nRed Ranger Sebastian Hernandez Pink Ranger Ignacio\n\nNotes[]\n\nIn a Q&A made by the channel Famous Birthdays, Brandon was asked: What is your favorite all-time video that you've made?.

They are primarily known for their plays, but also have a comic book series as well as a toyline. Kabbu is a huge fan of the Bug Rangers, stating that they \"inspire young bugs all over the land.\"\n\nTeam Snakemouth bear a striking resemblence to the Bug Rangers, as both teams consist of a bee, beetle and moth with similar coloring.

It was followed a year later by Cho Ninjatai Inazuma!! SPARK. It features many actors from Super Sentai, including Atsushi Hashimoto, Hiroya Matsumoto, Asami Kai, Mika Kikuchi, and Mika Kikuchi.\n\nThe Hyper Hero Team Series is an obvious parody of Super Sentai.

Predating Hikonin Sentai Akibaranger, Cho Ninjatai Inazuma! is Toei's first attempt at a parody of their Super Sentai series.\n\nCho Ninjatai Inazuma[]\n\nRaiden Hosomatsu Senden Kankichi Shiden Kaguya Tsubame Hien\n\nChromebook commercial[]\n\nDuring the commercial, the Dino Megazord is seen fighting Goldar to illustrate virus protection.\n\nChroma Squad[]\n\nA tactical RPG video game developed by Behold Studio launching on Kickstarter in July 2013, the basis of the game revolves around a studio trying to create a Sentai-esque TV show.

After kicking out a second black recruit and a Jewish recruit, the remaining recruits call out Zordon on his bigotry and walk away in disgust.\n\nCrystal Story[]\n\nAn indie RPG commercially released on February 6th, 2015. The primary antagonist of the game is a witch just named \"Witch Rita\", who bares a resemblance to Rita Repulsa, more so in her clothing than physical appearance. Moreover, the games true antagonist is her superior, a villain simply named \"Z\". Z's costume is heavily based off of Lord Zedd's design. Additionally, Z's name could be a reference to the fact that \"Zedd\" is an alternate pronunciation to the letter \"Z\".\n\nCutie Honey: The Live[]\n\nCutie Honey: The Live is a live action adaptation of Go Nagai's anime and manga Cutie Honey.

It was a play on either Power Rangers or Super Sentai. A lone ninja-themed hero is later seen facing the same villain as the Dino Troopers during a live stage show in Ninja Nightmare!.

Translating to English as End of Century Heroes Five Range-i, it is a parody of Himitsu Sentai Gorenger -- the last syllable in renjaa (\"ranger\") is replaced to avoid copyright issues. Each episode begins with the evil Dokuro Kamen (\"Skull Mask\", played by Hamada) often stopping for a friendly chat with the lady's friend before attacking the lady (played by You) in her home. The sentai heroes, the five renjai, then burst into the scene one at a time to save her and attempt to fight Dokuro Kamen, who is too distracted and unable to fight due to their appearances.\n\nIn the first episode, they have three red renjai and two yellow (breaking the usual sentai convention of having each hero in a different color). Dokuro Kamen lectures them and tells them to try better next time. Each subsequent episode has Dokuro Kamen attacking the same woman in the same room (often stopping for a friendly chat with the lady's friend before he attacks her), and the renjai appearing in mismatched costumes -- such as Tiger Mask, Falkor, and a waitress from a No-pan Shabu shabu-- or ridiculously modified versions of their uniforms.

They also have have different colors based on their skin. Notably when Captain Ginyu later faced Goku, not only did Goku imitate the pose, he also made a note that doing the pose was a big waste of time that angered Ginyu as a result. Turns out in the fighting game Dragon Ball FighterZ that Ginyu Force’s posing is the main reason why Gohan become the superhero Great Saiyaman. In the video game Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, which uncover the untold stories that are not in either manga nor anime, the Ginyu Force use to have had a sixth ranger, who is a female.\n\nPurple Captain Ginyu Blue Burter Red Jeice Orange Recoome Green Guldo Pink Bonyu (formerly)\n\nCooler's Armored Squadron (クウラ機甲戦隊 'Kūra Kikō Sentai') is a mercenary platoon that works under Cooler, the brother of Frieza through the Frieza Force.

Promotional images for the event featured the armor on a team of 5 in the iconic Gorenger color scheme, but the actual in-game item could be dyed any color of the player's choice.

This suit gives the player invincibility for 30 minutes and improves fishing, but can only be used once every 24 hours.\n\nHowever, their original design was too similar to the costumes of the 2017 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie and Saban threatened to sue Square Enix if they did not change it. This resulted in the Magitek Exosuit DLC being delayed until the suits could be re-designed. Fans reacted negatively to Saban's copyright claim as it ruined a pre-determined DLC release that players were waiting for.[2].\n\nFood Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma[]\n\nWhen the judges reacted after eating Chef Kojiro Shinomya's meal, an entire sequence of Magical Cabbage, with the team interestingly contains both magical girl (primarily Sailor Moon) and Super Sentai throwbacks (color coded designations).\n\nMagical Cabbage[]\n\nCabbage Red Hinako Inui Cabbage Blue Fuyumi Mizuhara Cabbage Pink Gin Dōjima Tuxedo Cabbage?

In addition to being an official assassin organization, the Handsome Men are also featured as characters in a comic book created by Trevor Pearlharbor and published by ZTT Comics. When the real-world group appears and begins to carry out the stories he writes in reality, Pearlharbor believes himself to be controlling them; in actuality, he is only a seer, and his comics are simply predictions of what they will do. LOVE Wilcox, a teenage girl and participant in the underground Internet, may be the actual coordinator of the Handsome Men's actions.\n\nHandsome Red Handsome Blue Handsome Light Brown Handsome Purple Handsome Pink Handsome Dead Handsome White Pearl Handsome Black Handsome Gold\n\nA television news announcement reports that a group resembling the comic book characters has assassinated Democratic Party member Steve Thunderson during a meeting of Congress. As a result, Mills dispatches the Killer 7 to kill Pearlharbor, who is writing their adventures into his comics in the week preceding their actual actions, and therefore appears to be controlling them, or at least some sort of terrorist. The Killer 7 tracks Pearlharbor to his studio in the Dominican Republic, where he is in the midst of drawing a scene of himself killing Dan Smith, and thus believes he cannot die. However, Handsome Black suddenly appears and fires his Handsome Wink at Dan, who successfully dodges; the attack hits Pearlharbor, killing him.\n\nDan kills Handsome Black in retaliation; Handsome Red appears on the scene and, surveying it, concludes that Dan killed both Pearlharbor and Black unprovoked.

A series of one-on-one matches ensues.\n\nKill la Kill[]\n\nIn episode 21 of Kill la Kill, Mako Mankanshoku makes a reference to Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger/Power Rangers Dino Thunder, when she tried to reason with Ryūko Matoi by quoting part of the Abaranger theme.
