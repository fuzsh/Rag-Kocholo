        "text": "From the theoretical perspective regarding communication as culture, this article focuses on the communicative dimension of cultural processes in contemporary times. Its objective is to report and discuss the widespread image of the social group referred to as Otaku, which is characterized by great ambivalence resulting from its Japanese origin and its subsequent insertion into mediatized imagery on a worldwide scale. In Japan, Otaku imagery carries the negative connotation of individuals who are fanatical about the consumption of entertainment-industry products, have little inclination for social life, and are associated with psycho-pathological and criminal behavior. In Asia and Brazil, the term Otaku has come to designate fans of Japanese pop culture but is characterized by its reference to a youth in search of informational exchanges and new modes of social interaction within urban life. It is concluded that Otaku imagery in the mundialized culture is altered to the extent that ...\n\nIn the age of the “transmediagesamtkunstwerk” – that is, a “total work of art” in which we no longer have one single work that concentrates a variety of media, but rather a work that finds expression through multiple media – the concept of kyara has become a key aesthetic strategy within Japanese popular culture (manga, anime, computer games, novels, pop music). I will address its relationship with the “total work of art” in three steps: the kyara-moé (consumption of characters) as a binding element in multimedia projects; merchandise as commoditization of the idea of \"total building\"; and fan labor (derivative work created by fans) as hypothetical 12th art, seeking a redefinition of \"totality” in the context of late modernity. I will briefly discuss some case studies from Japanese popular culture and contemporary art: the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise and works by artists associated with the Superflat movement, namely, Takashi Murakami and Yoshitomo Nara."
