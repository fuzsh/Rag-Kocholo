        "text": "Today's episode rotates back to the ongoing \"Chibikko King\" segment and before a proper introduction can be made the little guy heads straight over to the computer console to show team Musume what they're up against. Takuyakun is amazingly quick on the keyboard as he shows his typing prowess. :O And when it comes to typing Japanese characters/kanji on a keyboard it's quite a challenge with so many variations involved. As we get to watch him go to work his fingers fly with ease in an almost \"computer\" like fashion…that is if yours is quick…not like mine which seems to process data in a leisurely way. 😛\n\nTo get things started the girls begin questioning him about a few things and Tanakachi asks if he \"has a girl that he likes.\" Takuyakun answers everything by typing on the keyboard and quickly replies \"no\"…and when asked again suggesting that he's lying…\"definitely no.\" Heheh who has time for a girlfriend when you're a typing wizard!\n\nIn order to display his typing ability Takuyakun first challenges a computer game. \"The Typing of Dead\" is a Mac based game and it's gameplay is like nothing I've ever seen before. Players are challenged to maneuver through a zombie infested setting and your means of defeating the zombies lies in your ability to type proficiently as each enemy has a particular set of letters or Japanese characters/kanji above them which you must correctly type in in order to defeat them. As the level of enemies gets higher the level of difficulty also reflects on your typing skills and speed is factor. Now if only they had this available in typing class it would've been much more entertaining although I don't know if it would have helped my poor typing skills any. 😛\n\n\"Types like the wind\" looking extremely calm as he begins to challenge the game and amidst the gasps of \"sugoi\" & \"hayai\" he effortlessly makes his way through the first level clearing out the zombies before they can become a threat of any kind and he didn't even have to take out his AK47! :O After witnessing this first keyboard onslaught Sayu who dressed like a cute pink bunny seems to have a bit of confidence that she'll be able to do well in the upcoming challenge. Today's team Musume is comprised of Sayu, Gakisan, Lin Lin, Mitsii, & Tanakachi. But before going against such a daunting task a few pointers are handed out as the girls are treated to a brief lesson in typing prowess. Starting with your index fingers, Gakisan & Sayu show us a cute \"Sexy Boy~soyo kaze ni yorisotte~\" impression. 🙂 \"f j d k s l a ;\" okay now we're ready!!\n\nSayu is first face the trials of typing and right away we see just how difficult it is to produce the correct kanji characters on a keyboard when there are so many different variations in meaning available. Sayu manages to type in a few rather amusing phrases as she brings up some incorrect characters along the way. It's also interesting to note that some character combinations require isolated entries which need to be altered before the rest of the phrase can be typed otherwise the results can be quite different from what is originally intended. It looks like it's going to be a long day at the office for Sayu! :O Mitsii, Lin Lin, & Gakisan also get some practice time and it's funny seeing Mitsii cracking up all by herself…perhaps as she ponders their upcoming doom.\n\nAh but watching Tanakachi type is the best of all!! For a while it looked like I was trying to type in Japanese instead of her! :O Slowly…slowwwwly. And then a moment of surprise occurs when she can't find the question mark on the keyboard. \"Types Like the Wind\" can be seen having a good laugh on the side as he witnesses the event. They may have to tie one hand behind his back in order for Tanakachi to have a chance! 😛 In a panic Tanakachi keeps typing in periods as the search for the question mark continues…and her team mates can't seem to help her either! :O Watching Tanakachi type is the equivalent of seeing Miyabi taking a test. Her end score is zero as she runs out of time. :O Afterwards it's pointed out that the shift key is required to bring up the question mark…….and in slight embarrassment Tanakachi holds the keys down…?????????????????????????\n\nTeam Musume sends their top performer into battle and it's Sayu vs. \"Types Like the Wind.\" They'll be required to type the lyrics for \"Onna ni sachi are\" and Sayu will be given a much needed handicap as she gets to start quite far into the song while the challenger will be required to type all of the song's lyrics. Types Like the Wind will have to type in 382 \"moji\" (letter, characters) while Sayu is challenged to type in 154 moji. Sayu tries to copy him by answering by typing as she's posed a question about the upcoming challenge saying she will not lose with a few extra \"nu nu nu's\" added in for good measure all in a very large font size. :P To show just how quickly today's Chibikko King challenger types, a split screen is used showing the pv for \"Onna ni sachi are\" playing in super sped up hyper mode reflecting his machine like speed & efficiency! It's like the keyboard Terminator has arrived to destroy Sayu! :O It doesn't take long before the Keyboard Terminator has reached Sayu's progress point as he then quickly passes her in amazing fashion! Heheh Sayu's \"pv\" is playing in super slo mo! It's unbelievable how quickly he types!!! I've never seen anyone type this quickly ever!!! He's so quick that it looks like the film's been sped up! :O We witness the first spoken words from Takuyakun as he declares his sweet reward \"delicious\" without the use of his keyboard. Somehow I think he could have typed his response faster.\n\nNext we're off to another episode of \"Gourmet Kids\" as Aichan, Gakisan, & Lin Lin (where's Jun Jun?!!) meet up with their special hungry friend. Just watching this 13 year old eat is entertainment in itself. Look at him go! :O Heheh Lin Lin is a bit confused as to the meaning of his \"opening act.\" \"Peking duck\" spring rolls are on the menu and since this is HM of course there is a game in place to see which members get to eat. Mr. Shuffle Man aka \"the Joker\" is back to once again try to foil their eyes. Using 3 cards including one Joker and two blank cards he will attempt to shuffle them face down in an attempt to hide the single joker. The member who chooses the Joker card will not be eating any peking duck today! I must say that this time around the Joker did a much better job of deceiving my eyes as I actually lost track of where the Joker card was. 😛 Poor Aichan ends up picking the Joker card! Lin Lin continues to show off her growing Japanese vocabulary while Gakisan's \"what is this?\" reaction was quite funny.\n\nThe Kirarin Revolution/ Morning Musume collaboration continues and the winning character design will at last be announced…please let it be Kamei's strange robot cat! 😛 But first it's a visit to the official Kirarin Revolution shop as Jun Jun (there she is! 🙂 ), Aichan, Kamei, & Kohachan pay a visit. After the top 5 items are introduced (#1 is a berry filled crepe!) it's time for the winning drawing to be announced…please let it be Kamei's strange robot cat! Or Sayu's \"Nightmare Before Christmas\" cat! Amazing I just typed that before she pulled it out of the envelope! :O Sayu's \"Nightmare…\" cat has won!! Tamorisan will be proud. Sayu has such a wonderful shocked reaction!!…as does Gakisan but for a different reason. 😛\n\nAs HM@ has been improving its format recently, we now are treated to the addition of a live music performance like we used to see on episodes of H!M whenever a H!P group/artist released a new single. The palace set is beautiful as Buono! performs their debut single \"Honto no jibun.\" Momo's anime voice is the best!! The only downfall about this performance is that it's edited and Momo's \"Wakaru\" has been cut out. The more you hear this song the more you absolutely love it!! Okay I've now finally decided on where Airichan & Miya rank in this unit. 1. Momo 2. Airichan 3. Miya. Airichan & Miya are really just a coin flip apart!\n\nIt looks like the next episode will have team Musume facing a great challenge in the \"Uso Queen\" segment as they will face the power of female intuition. Can they still outsmart them? Tanoshimi desu ne…"
