Weekly Famitsu celebrated with five issues recapping the game scene since its first issue, published on 6/6/1986.\n\nAs we tend to do with most major Japanese magazines, we've been summarizing the content of the Weekly Famitsu anniversary issues in our magazine section. Turn the page and also check out our archives for summaries of all five anniversary issues, filled with little bits of trivia and some interesting score trends.\n\nIn addition to the history lesson, the five anniversary issues have featured interviews with some big Japanese game industry movers and shakers. Since there are lots of cool facts in the interviews, we thought we'd summarize them right here.\n\nFamitsu interviewed fourteen people, touching on everything from the development of the Dreamcast to the start of console porn. Here are some highlights.\n\nTOSHIO TABETA\n\nTabeta worked at NEC Avenue at the start of the PC Engine's life and was responsible for arcade ports. He later oversaw the release of numerous bishojo games (games with cute anime chicks), which eventually lead to his current status as one of the pioneers of the bishojo game industry. At the time of the PC Engine's release, a computer with a CD-ROM cost around 400,000 yen, so the idea of a game system with a CD-ROM drive was initially rejected. However, Tabeta had a powerful boss who, having seen Hudson's plan for the PC Engine, solidified the idea of a high class CD-ROM machine. The CD-ROM2 system ended up costing 60,000 yen, but it was a success.\n\nNEC wanted to establish a difference between the Famicom and the PC Engine, so Tabeta worked on arcade ports, initially getting the rights to games from Taito, including Darius. He then attempted to get the rights to Sega's arcade titles, and assumed it would be impossible because Sega had its own Mark III home videogame system. He was surprised at how quickly he got permission, and ten years later, he learned that the person who'd given the okay over at Sega was later scolded.\n\nTabeta's title was a producer, and he had a hand in many of the PC Engine's big names. He recalls Monster Maker being delayed for around a year. Later, as the number of arcade ports decreased, he got to work on PC ports of bishojo games. His first adult title was Dragon Knight II, which he started in secret as he couldn't get permission from his superiors. He also worked on Sotsugyou (Graduation) and Dokyuusei (Classmate), all of which went on to become hits and establish the console bishojo market.\n\nMASANOBU ENDO\n\nEndo entered Namco in 1981 and worked on Xevious and Tower of Druaga before going independent in 1985. A year later, he was asked by Bandai to produce Kidou Senshi Z Gundam: Hot Scramble, the first Gundam videogame, and he commented to Famitsu that this was when things really heated up for him in the game industry. At the time of its release, he felt that the Famicom was the most powerful hardware around, as its three color sprites allowed for a look closer to the arcades than the other machines like the MSX and SG-1000.\n\nTOSHIYUKI TAKAHASHI\n\nThis is the same Takahashi who's used as the \"Takahashi Meijin\" in the Japanese version of Hudson Soft's New Adventure Island. Takahashi shared thoughts on the \"Caravan,\" a national gaming tournament held during the 8-bit days. He feels that the Famicom was at its height during the 1986 Star Soldier caravan. This followed the November 1985 release of Super Mario Bros., which lead to nation-wide shortages of the base Famicom, and even the 15 inch and 20 inch Sharp C1 Famicom/television combo units. Things heated up for him once the PC Engine was released in October 1987, as he worked in PR and marketing for the system's biggest software provider.\n\nYUJI NAKA\n\nNaka took some time to reflect on 1990, prior to the release of Sonic for the Mega Drive (Genesis). Sega had its Sega Mark III (Master System) and Mega Drive hardware, both of which focused on arcade ports, as Sega's goal was to make the platforms the machines for bringing the arcade experience home. Naka himself worked on programming for Mark III games like Space Harrier and Outrun. It was a tough schedule, as games were made in two and a half months. He recalled finishing Phantasy Star for the Mark III, then having to jump right into Super Thunder Blade, developing it in time for the Mega Drive's launch less than three months later. With development tools practically non existent at the time, he had to do everything from scratch.\n\nMoving on to Phantasy Star II, Naka recalled that the game came at a time when resetting your system would often cause your data to be lost. With PSII, he implemented a system where the game would recover your data if damaged. The title would determine when your data had been damaged and would repair it, stating at the end, \"Your Backup Data Has Just Been Recovered.\"\n\nNaka also revealed in this interview that Sega had actually been considering using cartridges for the Saturn! He insisted that Sega use CD-ROM as the media, and in the end, Sega determined that, for production reasons, CD-ROM was the way to go. At the time, cartridges caused production problems, as if your game sold out, it would take three months for more units to arrive at retail. On the other hand, Naka feels that cartridges offer a better experience for users, noting that game systems today take many seconds to start up, an unacceptable delay in today's fast digital world.\n\nNORITAKA FUNAMIZU\n\nStreet Fighter II was born when Capcom America's president visited Japan and said that he wanted a sequel to the original Street Fighter, Funamizu commented to Famitsu. Double Dragon was a hit at the time, and Final Fight ended up being a game that resembled that title in structure. However, the Capcom America president wanted a versus fighter owing to the fact that Street Fighter's versus play was becoming popular in America. In Japan, the first version of SFII didn't sell all that well, leaving Capcom with excess stock of arcade units. His superiors ordered him to do something with the stock, leading to the birth of Street Fighter II Dash, or Street Fighter II Championship Edition in America. This is where the game reached popularity in Japan.\n\nAt this time, Capcom asked for a port to the Super Famicom. This caused some concern amongst Funamizu's team members, as the game hadn't been made with a port in mind. However, by placing bars at the top and bottom of the screen, shrinking the characters down and reducing animation patterns, they were able to port the game over successfully.\n\nDevelopment on Super Street Fighter II started after this, but was halted due to spread of pirated versions of Dash. As a means of stopping this spread, Capcom made Street Fighter II Turbo, giving the game's development staff just one and a half months development time.\n\nSuper Street Fighter IIX followed Super SFII, and Funamizu feels that while this game has quite a few holes, it's the best game in the SFII series.\n\nDue to the mass production of CPS-2 arcade boards, Capcom was faced with a surplus of arcade hardware. Although the build up wasn't the fault of Street Fighter, Funamizu was asked to do something about the problem, so he got staff together and, in three weeks (you read that right -- weeks!) they produced Street Fighter Zero.\n\nYU SUZUKI\n\nSuzuki's first title for Sega was the arcade game Championship Boxing, which came two years after he became an employee. This was followed by Hang On, which was developed as a response to Namco's Final Lap. Suzuki wanted to make a game where, different from other racers at the time, even if you made a mistake, you could get back into the race. Hang On was followed by Space Harrier, which used 2D visuals but had 3D gameplay.\n\nVirtua Racing came after this. Suzuki had studied 3D in college, and he really wanted to make a game that used a 3D board. He was familiar with the racing genre, so he was able to focus his efforts on the polygons.\n\nA year later, Suzuki followed VR with Virtua Fighter. With the success of Street Fighter II, there was a desire at Sega to top that title. However, most questioned the notion of a 3D fighter, claiming that it would be difficult for players to grasp the 3D space. Suzuki felt that all would be okay if the camera always returned to a wide view of the action.\n\nIn making VF, Suzuki commented, development of character motion was the toughest part. There was no motion capture technology at the time, so character movement had to often be hand created. What we saw in the first Virtua Fighter was only 30% of what Suzuki had originally wanted to do, he revealed to the magazine.\n\nVirtua Fighter 2's development started following Sega's adoption of motion capture. Of course, when you think VFII, you immediately think texture mapping. According to Suzuki, texture mapping technology was developed in Florida for military-use simulators as an attempt to make simulations more realistic. Suzuki wanted to use texture mapping so much that he went to Florida and worked on the development of the required graphics chip. The simulation system cost 3.2 billion yen per machine, with the texture mapping chip alone costing 200 million yen. Eventually, Suzuki and Sega's development partners were able to create a low-cost chip which could be used in Virtua Fighter 2.\n\nKOICHI NAKAMURA\n\nNakamura is president of Chun Soft, a development studio that made its mark as the developer of the early Dragon Quest titles. Chun Soft worked on DQIV for the NES and DQV for the Super Famicom. Once the newer hardware came out, they wanted to make something that made use of the system's excellent sound functions. This lead to their development of the sound novel Initially, development started with text on top of a paper texture, but the company's marketing department said that, while the game was interesting, it would be difficult to sell, and asked that visuals be included. The development staff also wanted to make sure that the resulting title, which would cost 8,800 yen, or the price of 10 books, would be interesting enough to justify the cost, and so they included multiple choose-your-path scenarios. The resulting title, Otogirisou, was the first game under Chun Soft's independent publishing label and marked the birth of the sound novel genre.\n\nISAO NAKAMURA\n\nNakamura entered Namco in 1988 and developed games like Final Lap 2 and MotoGP. He's currently working on the development of Ridge Racer 7. At the time of release for the PlayStation version of Ridge Racer, he was working on arcade games. However, he heard many stories about the development of the title. When Ridge Racer was announced as a launch title, not everyone at Namco was pleased. The arcade game used a Namco-developed System 22 architecture and included lots of RAM and ROM space. The PlayStation would require loading times as well as plenty of effort to fit everything into the limited space and onto the new Sony architecture. Furthermore, there was the difficulty that this was the first home game for many of the development staff.\n\nHIROYUKI KOBAYASHI\n\nKobayashi was a new programmer at the time of the original Resident Evil's development, with Shinji Murakami serving as the game's director. The game was developed originally without a title, and was referred to simply as \"Horror\" by the development staff. When they first heard the name \"Bio Hazard,\" they felt that it sounded like a cleaning solution.\n\nDuring its initial stages of development, Resident Evil was being created as a first person title. However, right before Kobayashi joined in, development switched a 3rd person perspective. Development was difficult in the early stages, as changes to puzzles or traps took a long time to put into the game. Designers were paired off with programmers. Kobayashi feels that times have changed considerably, as with proper tools, designers can work alone on gameplay aspects of titles.\n\nResident Evil's difficulty is often noted, Kobayashi commented to the magazine, but surprisingly, the game was originally supposed to be more difficult. For instance, item boxes were originally scheduled to be completely isolated from one another, so if you wanted to get an item out, you'd have to go back to the item box in which you placed it. The game was originally planned without automatic reloading of your gun. While the staff at the time felt that these were unnecessary features, Kobayashi has since had a change of heart.\n\nFollowing his comments on RE's development, Kobayashi voiced some criticism about the lack of coverage of the game in Famitsu at the time. He recalls only one article on the game prior to its release, and also remembers no one coming to the game's launch events. The game received strong cross reviews and good word of mouth, though, and ended up selling a million over a one year period.\n\nDevelopment on Resident Evil 2 had some hurdles. When development was half way complete, the project was scrapped and started over again. Kobayashi refers to the phantom game that was scrapped as Resident Evil 1.5. The game was scrapped after pictures had been published in magazines, including Famitsu.\n\nSHINICHI OKAMOTO\n\nOkamoto entered Sony in 1989 and had a hand in the development of the PlayStation. He then moved on to work on the PlayStation 2. He was involved in multiple areas of the PlayStation 2: as project manager, handing out work to engineers and outside forms, as a developer for software tools, something that he started back in the PlayStation days, and as head of development of peripherals. He was first told that he would be working on a machine that would probably be called PlayStation 2 back in 1996.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment president Ken Kutaragi wanted two capabilities built into the PlayStation 2, according to Okamoto: DVD playback and backwards compatibility. The problem with DVD playback was that a finalized format didn't exist in 1997 and 1998. However, Okamoto feels that if DVD playback hadn't been included, the system wouldn't have sold as well as it did in its first few months. As for backwards compatibility, Okamoto's team initially thought Kutaragi was joking about the idea. The problem was how to make the huge PlayStation lineup fully compatible with the system. The solution was to include all the PlayStation processors in the PS2, and use the Emotion Engine and Graphics Synthesizers to emulate the graphics.\n\nSHOICHIRO IRIMAJIRI\n\nFollowing a successful stay at Honda, Irimajiri became president of Sega in 1998 and lead the development and launch of the Dreamcast. At the early stages of the Saturn's life, according to Irimajiri, there were requests from the development staff to release a system capable of producing better 3D visuals. Development on the Dreamcast starting in 1996, with the main goals being to create a system for creating perfect 3D games, featuring a simple development environment for 3rd parties, and featuring network capabilities right out of the box.\n\nIn this interview, Irimajiri made a note of Sega's perceived weaknesses in genres outside of action. He admitted to making a request of a certain developer to bring a certain RPG to the Dreamcast. This request ended up failing.\n\nIrimajiri, spotted on TV years after Dreamcast.\n\nClick here to see his television commentary.\n\nThe most difficult area of the Dreamcast for Irimarji was the network functionality. Sega included a modem with every system, which added to the cost. The system should have actually cost above 29,800 yen, Irimarji believes. Sega also invested cash in creating networks for Europe, America and Japan. In the end, there wasn't too much interest in Online gaming at the time of the Dreamcast. \"In sales, it's no good to move one step ahead of your customers. Half a step is perfect,\" explained Irimajiri.\n\nTurn the page for the latest magazines from Japan.\n\nMAG RECAP\n\nThis section of Gaming Life in Japan takes a look at what's big in the latest game magazines from Japan. From Famitsu to Dengeki to smaller publications like Dorimaga, Japan has lots of videogame magazines. While we tend to put up all the news and game info revealed in the magazines on the main pages of IGN, this section gives you a closer look just so you can be sure that you're not missing out on anything.\n\nBe sure and click on the covers of each magazine for larger versions. Print them out and hold them in your hand as you read!\n\nFAMITSU -- NO. 918\n\nRisa Kudou looks mighty hot on the cover of this week's Famitsu. The 162 centimeter, type A Kanagawa native sports traditional Japanese clothing on the cover, but she wears a whole lot less inside the issue. A whole lot less.\n\nA whole lot less.\n\nRisa was born 10/4/1983, making her legal every where in the world except in certain Middle Eastern nations. We may just have to do her... err, do a Young Idol feature about her... as she has her own game! That's right, Risa is one of the girls in Capcom's Finder Love for the PSP!\n\nThis issue marks a return to regular Famitsu following the magazine's five part anniversary special (since we didn't publish last week, we've got a summary of part 5 below). Famitsu scored a bunch of scoops for this issue, including new games from Tetsuya Mizuguchi and Nintendo! Check it out here:\n\nFamitsu recap at Gaming Life blog\n\nWild Arms update\n\nMizuguchi's newest DS and PSP titles\n\nNew mech game from Nintendo\n\nBig PSP game coming soon\n\nThe magazine also has a feature detailing what it expects will happen in the last half of 2006. There's nothing new, although the magazine speculates that Sony will show more PS3 stuff at its annual summer PlayStation Meeting. It also expects further launch details for the system to be revealed in September or October, similar to how the PSP's price and release date were announced in October of 2004.\n\nA separate feature serves as a question and answer column on all the major happenings in the industry today, from next generation release plans to the current states of the DS, PSP and PS2. This column is a good read, but the only new bit is a survey in which Famitsu asked retailers about their pre-order states for next generation hardware. 16 shops are accepting pre-orders for Wii and PS3, with one doing so just for Wii and two doing so just for PS3. 85 shops aren't taking pre-orders for either. This is to be expected, since shortages are likely.\n\nAnother survey appears in the magazine's news page on the new pink DS Lite. The magazine reveals that 44.3% of current DS Lite systems are of the crystal white variety. Enamel Navy is second at 29.5%, with Ice Blue coming in third at 26.2%.\n\nAnother packed review list leading up to a surprisingly crowded mid July.\n\nGAMESYSTEMPUBSCOREbit Generations BoundishGBANintendo7, 7, 7, 5bit Generations Dial HexGBANintendo8, 7, 6, 6bit Generations dotstreamGBANintendo9, 8, 7, 6Naruto RPG: Reijuu vs Kinoha ShoutaiNDSTakara Tomy7, 7, 7, 6Project Hacker -- KakuseiNDSNintendo7, 7, 7, 6Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 13PS2Konami Digital Entertainment9, 8, 8, 8Love Kon -- Punch De KontoPS2AQ Interactive7, 7, 7, 6Machi-ing Maker 2: Zoku -- Boku no Machi ZukuriPS2D3 Publisher6, 5, 5, 4Persona 3PS2Atlus9, 8, 8, 8Sarugetchu Million MonkeysPS2Sony Computer Entertainment Japan (SCEJ)7, 7, 6, 6LocoRocoPSPSony Computer Entertainment Japan (SCEJ)9, 9, 8, 8Quiz Kidou Senshi Gundam Monsenshi DXPSPBandai Namco Games7, 7, 7, 7\n\nFAMITSU -- NO. 917\n\nLast week's Famitsu marked the end of the magazine's five part 20th anniversary celebration. We didn't update last week, but since it was a special issue, we've decided to share some of the content with you here.\n\nThis final anniversary celebration features a historical tour of the years 2002 to 2006. In gaming news, this period had some big happenings, including the Xbox launch on 2/22/2002. April 25, 2002 saw the legalization of used game sales. October of that year marked the start of the CERO ratings system. 2003 and 2004 were a confusing time as Sega, Namco and Sammy went through various merger talks. And, of course, the end of 2004 saw the release of the PSP and DS.\n\nIn Famitsu happenings, the magazine celebrated its 700th issue in May 2002. Issue 765 featured a special on Namco because the number 765 can be red \"Na-Mu-Go.\" This was followed by issue 832, which had a special on Famitsu itself (832 = \"HA-MI-TSU\"). Famitsu set up its first Tokyo Game Show booth in the year 2003 show. Motoi Sakurai began his weekly column in the 4/18/2003 issue; that column still continues today and was the source of some initial Smash Brothers Wii leaks earlier this year. The last major Famitsu happening for the period (well, before the 20th anniversary celebrations) saw Enterbrain move its home office to Tokyo's Hanzoumon area in March of 2005.\n\nOf course, the big happening took place just prior to the start of this period as, in late August of 2001, we started doing Gaming Life in Japan! That's not listed in Famitsu, of course. Bastards.\n\nAlso included in this issue is the last volume of Famitsu's cross review catalogue. The three-part catalogue lists the entire cross review content for games that scored above 32, with mini recaps for games that scored above 30. This volume covers from 2003 through the end of 2005. Adding up the totals with the scores from the first two volumes, we get:\n\nFamicom: 34 games above 32, 41 games above 30\n\nPC Engine: 22 games above 32, 36 games above 30\n\nMega Drive: 11 games above 32, 32 games above 30\n\nGame Boy: 15 games above 32, 27 games above 30\n\nSuper Famicom: 55 games above 32, 80 games above 30\n\nSega Saturn: 52 games above 32, 58 games above 30\n\nPlayStation: 131 games above 32, 203 games above 30\n\nNintendo 64: 38 games above 32, 29 games above 30\n\nDreamcast: 62 games above 32, 67 games above 30\n\nPlayStation 2: 294 games above 32, 261 above 30\n\nGameCube: 83 games above 32, 41 games above 30\n\nXbox: 41 games above 32, 42 games above 30\n\nWonderswan: 1 game above 32, 9 games above 30\n\nGame Boy Advance: 77 games above 32, 57 games above 30\n\nXbox 360: 4 games above 32, 2 games above 30\n\nNintendo DS: 24 games above 32, 19 games above 30\n\nPSP: 19 games above 32, 19 games above 30\n\nCheck out the PS2 with its incredible lineup of 294 games scoring above 32! Best system ever? Judging by Famitsu's scores, it is by a big margin.\n\nOutside of the anniversary stuff, it was business as usual.
