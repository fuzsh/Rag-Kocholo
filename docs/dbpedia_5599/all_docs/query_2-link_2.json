Kirari Tsukishima, a gluttonous 14-year-old beauty, is a girl who does not care about idols and the entertainment world because her mind is occupied by food. Her obsession with food only causes her to be clueless about love. One day, after saving a turtle that is stranded in a tree, Kirari meets with a handsome and gentle boy named Seiji, who gives her ticket to a...",

        "text": "Both have idol and singing themes, both are really cute. ^^\n\nreport Recommended by roseice\n\nBoth revolve around singing.. and both have main characters that sing for the person they love (who is blonde in both shows!) and then yet there is a dark haired, angry \"rival\" who doesnt seem like a rival at first. Both shows have evil rivals (who have evil pets), and the list goes on. Overall, they're a fairly similar setup and if you enjoyed one, you may enjoy the other! However, Kirarin Revolution contains a lot more filler than Fullmoon.\n\nreport Recommended by katsup\n\nA young girl rises to be #1 idol. Music theme. A touch of humor. Similarity: 3*\n\nreport Recommended by yomu\n\nThe main character of each show is a young girl who dreams of becoming an idol. Both girls want to become an idol because of a boy, but along the way, their feelings change. Both also feature a lot of singing, as both Mitsuki and Kirari hold concerts, and the songs are generally fun j-pop songs. Also, both feature quite a bit of anime-original material to pad out the manga.\n\nreport Recommended by kaleidoruby\n\nsimilar because they both are a romance and there is singing in both of them\n\nreport Recommended by lily_003\n\nIn both these shows the girls wish to become idols to get closer to the guy that they love n_n\n\nreport Recommended by CuteAnimeJunkie\n\nSimilar on how a girl does her best to fulfil a dream in the show business including romance and comedy.\n\nreport Recommended by kyokyo_x\n\nIn both Kirarin Revolution and Full Moon WO Sagashite the main characters become Idols for guys that they like. In both anime the main character slowly figure out that they don't really like the boy that they think that they like but the one that has been with them from the start and that had helped them out the most. The differences in these anime are that Mistki has only a year left to live and transforms into the 16 year old body she uses to be an idol (Full Moon) while Kirari does not have a 'time limit' on life and does not transform but does more close work with the guy she likes (the one she think she likes and the one she actually likes) as well as getting partners. I recommend both anime as they are both lots of fun and have lots of comedy. &nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by AnimePikaRumple\n\nBoth heroines are cute girls who wants to be idol for person they love. Both stories have love triangle where female protagonist at start of the series loved blonde hair boy, but end up with black haired.\n\nreport Recommended by AmaTenshi\n\nDespite the fact that their reasons to enter the entertainment world are the opossite, they later discover that the entertainment world it's not as easy as it seems and it's not just about wanting to be there but that it also requires a lot of hard work. The two of them are funny and if you like this kind of shoujo,romantic, comic and idols stuff you might enjoy watching it.\n\nreport Recommended by karlala\n\nthey are both about the entertainment world.. kirarin revolution is about a girl who fall in love at 1st sight making her aim to be an idol to become close to the guy she loves.. skip beat is about a girl who devotes all her life for her childhood love that eventually making use at her that makes her so angry she aim to join the entertainment world to make revenge.. both.. as the story goes on they become happy being an idol and they both make there best for their fans..\n\nreport Recommended by anndie_rose\n\nBoth plots are very similar. Both main characters want to be popstars because of a guy popstar and actually are great at being a popstar. They love the popstar who they joined fame for, but ending falling for the other male popstar they meet. Skip beat is like the grown up version of Kirarin Revolution.\n\nreport Recommended by Dorky_Ninja\n\nboth the main females have the same attitude, all in the series are very similar.\n\nreport Recommended by animefreak1806\n\nKirarin is younger, but the show business theme is still similar. I did like Skip Beat better.\n\nreport Recommended by pandoreye\n\nBoth have very nice romance aspects and yet the quality comedy!! >W< karin's expressions remind me of kirari too. Although it doesn't have the whole idol theme, and its more of a parody of a magical girl anime, kamichama karin is a great romance-comedy to watch! ^ ^\n\nreport Recommended by kitkat23316\n\nWell, both the main character's names start with \"k\"...anyway, the characters are drawn in the same kawaii style, and both main characters have someone they like, but that changes throughout the series.\n\nreport Recommended by chibifox27\n\nYes, I love how Kirarin & Karin expressions are. Sometimes they get mad or upset ya know. && they mainly depend on the male character at times. They also try to help out of what looks good, but it doesnt always go that way. The romantic comedy is the best thing for these animes.\n\nreport Recommended by ohmiharu\n\nKirain & Karin are pretty much the same person. they both like food, have the best facial expressions, and they even look similar. The romance in both stories is very similar as well. Even though the plots are different, both have a similar feeling that just reminds you of the other one.\n\nreport Recommended by katsup\n\nkirarin revolution and kaleido star are both the same in some ways.. kirari want to make her fans and all the people around her happy by doing her best being an idol..though she 1st dream to be an idol just because she wants to be close with seiji..but as she comes an idol..she really do her best for her fans.. sora want to spread happiness in the kaleido stage.. she 1st dream to join in kaleido when she was young when she watch alice in wonderland with her real parents.. kirari & sora both don't want any competition because they want a happy stage for everyone..but they both realize that competition is always attached to their own stage..&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by anndie_rose\n\nEven though the two series are of completely different genres, both series are uniquely focused on characters aiming to become idols. In addition, both series do tend to exaggerate greatly. Whereas AKB0048 is set in a pseudo-futuristic setting, Kirarin is set in a more realistic settings. Kirarin is first of all aimed towards a younger shoujo demographic and more children-friendly. The setting and plot are more comedy oriented. However, the songs are definitely not as professional as the ones performed by AKB48. On the other hand, AKB0048 is aimed towards the AKB48 fans and general otaku culture. The soundtrack of AKB0048 is based on past AKB48 songs and the animation quality is much more modern. Overall, both series are only suggested to people interested in idol characters. Personally, neither of the series can be considered very good. People who really want to see interesting plot should watch/read Skip Beat and many other great series.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by wakka9ca"
