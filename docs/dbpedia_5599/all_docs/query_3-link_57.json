        "text": "Passion for Japanese manga and animation took Tetsuya Kakihara through an incredible journey to be one of the most respected and sought-after seiyuu in the industry.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara\n\nKANJI: 柿原彻也\n\nBORN: December 24, 1982\n\nOCCUPATION: seiyuu, singer, CEO\n\nHEIGHT: 170cm\n\nTetsuya Kakihara was born on December 24, 1982 in Dusseldorf, Germany (former Western Germany).\n\nSeiyuu\n\nKakihara recalled in an interview for Amusement Media Gakuin (video below) that, up until when he was in middle school, he wanted to be a teacher.\n\nHowever, everything changed when he fell in love anime & manga as a kid.\n\nFrom that point on, Tetsuya Kakihara was determined: he wanted to make voice acting his way of life, sharing with others these fascinating sides to Japanese culture.\n\nPrior to having the dream of being a seiyuu, Kakihara would go on vacation with his family to Japan almost every year for almost 1 month. That’s where he would read manga and watch anime to no end, bringing with him to Germany volumes and volumes of manga.\n\nBorn and raised in Germany, Tetsuya Kakihara was going to make a permanent change in his career, going all in on his career as a voice actor by moving to Japan.\n\nAt the age of 19, and 3 days after introducing himself to Amusement Media Gakuin by email, Kakihara would embark on a journey that would completely change his life.\n\nAfter introducing himself at Amusement Media Gakuin only 3 days after first contact with them – and telling the vocational school that he was coming from Germany -, Kakihara kept visiting the offices of the school until they accepted him in their voice acting programme.\n\nDespite being of Japanese origins, truth is: Tetsuya Kakihara didn’t speak nor read much Japanese before setting his mind into being a voice actor. He knew the basics but he recalls that he struggled with reading Kanji.\n\nHe knew that he had a handicap in comparison with all born and bred Japanese that were also aiming for a career as voice actors.\n\nHe would talk in Japanese for hours and hours – even alone – and listened to a lot of Japanese – anime, TV series, CDs – to learn the words and vocabulary he need, all with the goal of being able to communicate with others and understand the world around him.\n\nKakihara mentioned in a couple of interviews in the past and in his photobook that he worked part-time jobs and studied Japanese at a part-time school, trying to drill every single bit of the language to be able to give it a shot at his dream, and be taken seriously by others not as just another “foreigner” trying his luck.\n\nHe was aware of his handicap – not being fluent in Japanese – and decided to turn it into an advantage.\n\nWhile attending Amusement Media Gakuin, Tetsuya Kakihara was classmates with Tomoaki Maeno who, in an interview, mentioned that he envied Kakihara to a certain degree due to how quick he had graduated and started to have regular work in the seiyuu industry.\n\nKakihara mentioned in an interview to Amusement Media Gakuin (video above) that he was always eager to learn more therefore, when he was a rookie seiyuu and still didn’t have many lines, he’d observe the actor’s movements and skills.\n\nOn top of that, he’d also approach veteran voice actors to ask them to teach him how to do certain things – much to the confusion and / or irritation of some veterans that found his behavior to be out-of-line.\n\n2002 – 2006\n\nThe debut and 1st leading roles\n\nAfter graduating from Amusement Media Gakuin, Tetsuya Kakihara joined 81 Produce, one of Japan’s top talent agencies, at that time housing voice acting talents such as Shinichiro Miki, Kenta Miyake and Takahiro Sakurai.\n\nHe made his official debut as a voice actor in the Sentou Yousei Yukikaze OVAs, with a minor role.\n\nAfter that he landed minor roles in anime series such as Monkey Typhoon, Maburaho, Sensei no Ojikan: Doki Doki School Hours, Nepos Napos, and Futakoi.\n\nAfter 3 years of minor roles, Kakihara’s 1st chance at the spotlight came with his leading role in the magic and comedy anime, Fushigiboshi no☆Futagohime.\n\nIn this series he voiced Bright, prince of the Jewelry Kingdom and one of the main characters in the series.\n\nA year later, Kakihara was cast in the comedy / drama anime, Princess Princess as Mikoto Yutaka.\n\nMikoto Yutaka is one of the main characters in the series, considered to be a fool with a heart of gold, entirely devoted to his girlfriend while trying to avoid as much to be ridiculed in front of her.\n\nKakihara’s performance as Mikoto Yutaka earned him a Best Rookie Seiyuu award at the 1st Seiyuu Awards in 2007.\n\nStill in 2006, Tetsuya Kakihara reprised his role as Bright in Fushigiboshi no Futagohime Gyu!.\n\nOther anime he’s voiced characters in during this period of time include: Kirarin☆Revolution, Pumpkin Scissors, BLACK LAGOON The Second Barrage, Jigoku Shoujo, xxxHOLiC and more.\n\n2007 – 2010\n\nBuilding up a foundation\n\nWith a couple of leading roles under his belt and an award as Best Rookie Seiyuu, all eyes were on Tetsuya Kakihara, the voice actor from Germany that was impressing everyone with his voice acting.\n\nAnd he scored a big gig in 2007, one that would guarantee a spotlight on top of him for years to come.\n\nKakihara was cast as Simon in the critically acclaimed action / adventure anime, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\n\nSimon is the protagonist of the series, starting the story when he’s only 14 years-old. As the story progresses, viewers get to witness his growth both as a person but also getting older (the story wraps up when the character is 21 years-old).\n\nWhat this meant as a challenge for Kakihara was that he was going to mature his voice throughout the series.\n\nHe started it by using a rather high pitched, cheerful and youthful tone to later dropping his tone close to 1 or 2 octaves, sound much serious and matured.\n\nThis was one of the very first opportunities fans got to witness Kakihara’s range and how well he slowly introduced those nuances in the voice tone as the series progressed.\n\nFrom a short kid that loved drills to a well-loved, passionate leader, Simon matured in an endearing way that fans can’t help but to love to watch and listen to.\n\nKakihara ended up reprising his role as Simon in 3 movies, 1 special and 1 OVA. This amount of exposure was responsible for Kakihara’s popularity rise in 2007, leading to many of the anime series’ fans to turn into his fans.\n\nStill in the same year, Kakihara landed a supporting role in the long running and popular shounen anime, BLEACH.\n\nHe voiced the cocky and Ggio Vega, one of the arrancar in the series.\n\nAlthough it was a brief performance in the series (with appearances from 2007 to 2009), it was the start of Kakihara’s streak of voicing arrogant and sarcastic characters – something that would repeat a little bit throughout his career in both anime and games for years to come.\n\n2008 arrived and with it came 1 leading role.\n\nHe was cast as Koichi Hayase in sci-fi and mecha anime, Kurogane no Linebarrels.\n\nHayase is a high-schooler that, due to a certain event, ends up being a pilot for a mecha. Problem is: the pilot’s and the mecha’s life and strength are shared, putting new stakes in every bout in the series.\n\nWhat happens is that Hayase ends up getting stronger due to being a pilot for that specific mecha and… cue the arrogant and cocky protagonist that everyone that watched the series is disappointed in.\n\n2009 would end up being career defining for Tetsuya Kakihara.\n\nHe was cast as Natsu Dragneel in the anime adaptation of the popular action / adventure manga, Fairy Tail.\n\nAs far as a protagonist in a shounen series goes, Natsu checks all boxes.\n\nHe’s reckless, passionate, loyal, a bit carefree – which leads to hilarious bouts / exchanges with other characters within the same guild – and is more about solving issues in a practical, hands-on fashion.\n\nLiking a good challenge, Natsu is always challenging fellow guild members to fights in which he can prove his might and strength.\n\nFor Natsu, Kakihara was ready to tackle the challenge that is to voice a character that often shouts – which can seriously tire and even damage his vocal cords – but he went a step further, ensuring each scream came with a correlated emotion that fit the mood of the scene and the feelings of the character on a certain topic.\n\nAlthough much of the anime series is meant to be fights and cool displays of power, Fairy Tail still managed to deliver its emotional scenes and Kakihara more than delivered in his role as Natsu.\n\nNatsu turned into one of the most beloved anime characters and thus, the name Tetsuya Kakihara was now well known and his voice instantly recognizable.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara was cast in the popular shounen anime, Fullmetal Alchemist as the kind and cheerful Kain Fuery. This was only but a supporting role in the series but still one that his fans hold dear.\n\nStill in the same year, Kakihara voiced Tenma Pegasus, the protagonist in the OVA Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas – Meiou Shinwa.\n\nThe OVA served as a blank slate for many of its viewers and a new universe for the Saint Seiya veterans.\n\nKakihara’s performance as Tenma Pegasus ended up being praised as well as the series and characters themselves as it is note that: there is actual character development in the series, being impossible not to support the characters in their adventures and rooting for them in their fights.\n\nOther role that is held dear by his fans is Toranosuke V. Haga in the romance / drama anime series, Hanasakeru Seishounen.\n\nToranosuke serves as the bodyguard for the series’ protagonist, Kajika. He’s often teased by another main character in the series, Li Ren.\n\n2010 was a bit quieter for Kakihara, even in terms of work load in the anime industry. He picked few roles during this year but there are still some highlights in the mix.\n\nOne of those highlights is his role as the delinquent, Gouki Aratake in the shoujo, romance anime, Kaichou wa Maid-Sama!.\n\nHe counted with minor and or supporting roles in other anime series such as:\n\nOver Drive\n\nCLAYMORE\n\nZombie-Loan\n\nTerra e…\n\nDragonaut: The Resonance\n\nShounen Onmyouji\n\nRomeo x Juliet\n\nKannagi\n\nMacross F\n\nNabari no Ou\n\nMetal Fight Beyblade\n\nBattle Spirits: Brave\n\nHime Chen! Otogi Chikku Idol Lilpri\n\nぬらりひょんの孫\n\n2011 – 2013\n\nEstablishing himself as a household name\n\n2011 kicked off with a leading role as Masamune Date in the comedy and action anime, Sengoku☆Paradise Kiwami.\n\nThe anime wasn’t well received, being criticized for its random, rushed story and lack of character development, something that made Kakihara’s role in the series go under the radar despite the solid performance he delivered.\n\nStill in the same year, Tetsuya Kakihara scored a supporting role in the action anime series, Ao no Exorcist.\n\nHe voiced Amaimon, character that has an apparent calm demeanor but he is easily angered if his “fun” is ruined by any characters in the series.\n\nAside from this Amaimon is pretty tough and powerful albeit a bit carefree and arrogant. Amaimon continued the trend for Kakihara to voice carefree and arrogant characters.\n\nA year later, Kakihara was cast in K as Adolf K. Weismann.\n\nAlthough a supporting role for part of the series – later on being a bigger role -, fans of the series couldn’t help but to be glued to the screen during Kakihara’s performance as he did the script in both Japanese and German, delivering a chilling performance at the same time.\n\n2012 was more eventful for Tetsuya Kakihara as he managed to land several leading roles however, not all panned out as he’d have wanted.\n\nThe first leading role of the year was Sam Coyne in the action and sci-fi anime series, Ozma.\n\nThe series would end up being criticized for its stereotypical portrayal of an apocalyptical story and the fact that Sam Coyne was the type of character that didn’t seem to learn from past mistakes.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara’s performance as Sam wasn’t necessarily lackluster but the script certainly didn’t help him shine one bit despite all the potential that the story had, not to mention how the character could have grown but, unfortunately, didn’t.\n\nHe was then cast as Ryuuhou Dragon in Saint Seiya Omega, shounen / fantasy anime that ended up being heavily criticized for being a pale, empty reimagining / new chapter in the Saint Seiya franchise.\n\nRyuuhou is only but a kid throughout the 2 seasons of Saint Seiya Omega, due to this, Kakihara’s performance is rather high pitched and youthful to match the character’s age.\n\nStill in the same year, Kakihara reprised his role as Sakutaro Morishige in the OVA adaptation of the survival horror visual novel, Corpse Party.\n\nHis performance as Morishige is worthy of praise by how the character goes from calm and collected to completely insane in the OVA, something that Kakihara made sure would leave a mark in the viewer’s mind.\n\nAlthough with little screen time, Kakihara was still able to impact the viewer with a pretty solid – and disturbing – performance.\n\nNow, more than leaving a mark, Kakihara’s performance in the risqué yaoi OVA adaptation of the Finder manga came as a shocking.\n\nFirst off, the Finder manga is known for being extremely graphic and it was the very first time that Kakihara was openly voicing a character in a yaoi / BL series.\n\nHe voiced Akihito Takaba, a freelance photographer that is not afraid of taking risks if it means he can expose evil. However, he ends up playing a game of cat and mouse with one of the most powerful men in Japan’s underworld.\n\nIf you’re curious, remember to check the manga / OVA at your own risk, the content is pretty graphic and it is far from containing “consensual” relationship between the main characters.\n\n2013 counted with plenty of leading roles for Kakihara but it was a year of change as Kakihara decided to leave 81 Produce and go freelance in the same year.\n\nHe reprised his role as Shin in the anime adaptation of the otome game, AMNESIA.\n\nOn a first look, Shin is an outcast, cold and indifferent to others but as other characters interact with him and he slowly builds bonds with them, he shows a gentle, caring side.\n\nHowever, towards the character his caring, loving side goes the twisted, obsessive, manipulative route, doing a 180 in his personality and being, at times, pretty intimidating and scary.\n\nThe anime adaptation didn’t come close to this last part about obsession – due to episode constraints – but that is what you should be expecting of Shin.\n\nKakihara’s performance covered all those emotions to the point that you couldn’t swoon when he started opening to the heroine but slowly, distance yourself from the character as soon as those red flags appeared (unless you enjoy yandere protagonists/romantic interests), with Kakihara’s voice and performance matching those changes.\n\nOne of Kakihara’s best known roles in the 10s was as Shino Inuzuka in the anime adaptation of the popular fantasy anime, Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun.\n\nShino Inuzuka is loud, energetic yet, at the same time, caring and has a loveable personality, something that draws most characters and monsters to him.\n\nAfter witnessing a certain chain of events, Shino finds himself in a bind, holding a heavy burden on his shoulders while trying to protect those he loves.\n\nKakihara’s performance as Shino was like a transposition of what he was already doing as Natsu in Fairy Tail – the intensity, sometimes childish behavior and loudness carried over – but with a twist.\n\nThe character has his fair share of fragile moments that serve as a plot device but also to deepen the viewer’s knowledge at how much Shino is actually enduring and the burden he has.\n\nKakihara tackled those feelings with a lot of emotion which made it easy to connect with the character.\n\nHe then reprised his role as Jin Kisaragi in the anime adaptation of the BlazBlue videogames, BlazBlue: Alter Memory.\n\nJin is a borderline sociopath with a cold, detached and ruthless personality that makes him stand out among the main characters in the series.\n\nKakihara’s performance enhanced those personality traits to a point in which you can’t help but to think that Jin is completely devoid of any emotions besides anger and hatred.\n\nAlthough the anime adaptation didn’t end up being as popular as the games, this is one of Kakihara’s roles that has fallen off the radar of many people.\n\nMakai Ouji: Devils and Realist premiered in 2013 and, despite the lukewarm response to it, it was a decent anime series. Kakihara was cast as Camio, one of the main characters in the series.\n\nCamio is one of the most powerful characters in the series, possessing a power above the four kings in the series. He’s intelligent, calm and collected but deeply hates his heritage as he doesn’t fit with either demons or humans.\n\nThis conflict was put into one of the most memorable performances in the series.\n\nKakihara was once again back to voicing eccentric characters. He was cast as Kouha Ren in the popular adventure anime, Magi: The Kingdom of Magic.\n\nThe appearance might be misleading but Ren is a sadist that enjoy seeing others suffering, beats his servants and loves the sight of blood. Kakihara embraced the character’s eccentric personality, making him insufferable to most viewers.\n\nThe streak of eccentric characters continued for Kakihara with him landing a supporting role in the popular cycling anime, Yowamushi Pedal.\n\nHe voiced Jinpachi Toudou, a cocky and loud mountain climber that has a thing for hoarding the spotlight and manipulating others. Toudou ends up being a torn on the side of the series’ protagonist with his technique and mind games.\n\nStill in 2013, Kakihara reprised his role as Sakutaro Morishige in the 2nd OVA for Corpse Party, Corpse Party: Tortured Souls – Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou.\n\nHe counted with minor and or supporting roles in other anime series such as:\n\nDog Days\n\nMoshidora\n\nSKET DANCE\n\nBRAVE10\n\nKamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi\n\nKetsuekigata-kun!\n\nPretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live\n\nLog Horizon\n\n2014\n\nA new beginning\n\nAfter 1 year as freelancer, Tetsuya Kakihara announced the establishment of his own talent agency, ZYNCHRO.\n\n2014 kicked off and Kakihara was cast in the mecha / pyschological anime, M3: Sono Kuroki Hagane. He voiced Minashi Maki, one of the characters part of the main cast.\n\nHe was then cast in the music anime, Shounen Hollywood: Holly Stage for 49 as Ikuma Amaki, reformed delinquent that is the life of the group and, coincidently, Shounen Hollywood’s new leader.\n\nThe anime series ended up having a total of 2 seasons however, its popularity in Japan not a lot and even that never translated to overseas, with the anime being rated pretty below average by most views.\n\nStill in the same year, Kakihara scored the leading role as Keiichiro Tokugawa in the mecha and ecchi anime series, Fuuun Ishin Dai☆Shogun.\n\nThe anime was heavily criticized for its lack of plot, ridiculous setting and passable voice acting.\n\nBefore the end of 2014, Kakihara was cast in the popular sports anime, Diamond no Ace as Inashiro’s proud 3rd baseman, Yoshizawa Hideaki.\n\nHe counted with minor and or supporting roles in other anime series such as:\n\nHoozuki no Reitetsu\n\nONE PIECE\n\nTokyo ESP\n\n2015 –\n\nAiming higher and higher\n\nIn 2015, Tetsuya Kakihara was cast as Masato in Kyokai no Rinne.\n\nNow, Masato the kanji reading means “narrow minded person” – is presented in the series as a sort of an antagonist but truth is, he’s a running gag.\n\nThe competent “incompetent” demon that fails, time after time, to mess with the series’ main character.\n\nFor this role, Kakihara brought his comedic wits and delivered a funny and loud performance that made fans of the series enjoy every episode featuring Masato – the kanji reading means “narrow minded person”\n\nThis first year as a CEO of ZYNCHRO proved to be quite challenging, with Kakihara getting a reduced stream of roles – or deliberately not auditioning to roles as everything about the company and his new status as a CEO settled down.\n\nThings changed around in 2016, with Kakihara nailing a couple of leading or relevant supporting roles.\n\nHe voiced Shun Moritsuka in the sci-fi and mystery anime, Occultic;Nine.\n\nThis wasn’t a particularly loved anime series – even with its stellar cast – because of the ridiculously fast pacing, attempt of adapting way too much content into every episode and, even so, plenty of plot holes that will make your watching session of this anime, a pretty confusing one.\n\nKakihara reprised his role as Prompto in the prequel anime to the Final Fantasy XV game, Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV.\n\nHe voiced Mikuni Arisuin in Servamp. Kakihara was back to voicing eccentric characters, this time around with Mikuni being quiet the quirky and cunning one.\n\nStill in the same year, the drama and 2D music franchise, Tsukiuta, was adapted to anime. Tetsuya Kakihara reprised his role as Procellarum’s You Hazuki in Tsukiuta. THE ANIMATION.\n\nYou Hazuki is known for his professionalism, but also for his unique sense of beauty, free-spirit and laid-back vibe.\n\nKakihara was then cast as one of the main characters in the sci-fi / fantasy anime, Divine Gate.\n\nHe voiced Akane, straightforward character that cares about the others around himself – but doesn’t like to show that -, he’s after the Divine Gate with a specific objective that, unfortunately, the anime series wasn’t too good at explaining and then fleshing out.\n\nDue to the characters’ vague intentions and the lack of depth of most – if not all – characters in the series, as well as subpar plot, Divine Gate is regarded as one of the worst anime in the Winter 2016 season.\n\nOn a different note, Kakihara was cast as Uno in the comedy anime, Nanbaka.\n\nUno is a compulsive gambler but that hobby of his comes as useful at times, as he can understand patrol patterns, quirks and more that actually play to his advantage.\n\nHe’s also pretty shallow when it comes to appearances, and considers himself as the most popularity inmate.\n\nBut aside from that eccentric behavior, Uno ends up being reliable, friendly and open character that doesn’t discriminate, accepting everyone into his circle of friends.\n\nKakihara fleshed out Uno’s personality in a way that he can in one minute be a running gag in the series and, in the other, be a pivot character that you should take – at least – a bit seriously. Uno’s shenanigans will be certain to make you crack up.\n\nIn the same year, an anime series set in the same universe as Barakamon premiered.\n\nHanda-kun went back in time to explore the life of student Sei Handa and what made the character who it was by the time of the events in Barakamon.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara voiced Reo Nikaido, character that ended up being Handa’s stalker / fan as he was determined to know the secret to Handa’s popularity.\n\nAdding up to this, the character has an overly confident demeanor in regards to his popularity status within the school. This is not the type of character to take seriously as Handa-kun is a gag / comedy anime series. Still, it was an interesting addition to Kakihara’s repertoire.\n\nOne of the most anticipated anime series – for the female demographic – was B-PROJECT. Already with a pretty big following, the franchise announced an anime adaptation and, in 2016, the series B-Project: Kodou*Ambitious.\n\nHe reprised his role as Momotaro Onzai, MooNs‘ stoic and passionate member. The role would end up being reprised in the 2nd season, B-Project: Zecchou*Emotion (2019).\n\n2016 was a year filled with Kakihara reprising roles from games. Another role he reprised was the calm and collected Uguisumaru in the slice-of-life anime, Touken Ranbu: Hanamaru.\n\nIn 2017, Kakihara reprised his role as Yuta Mirako in the anime adaptation of the visual novel, Kenka Banchou Otome: Girl Beats Boys.\n\nYuta Mirako is a former delinquent turned idol that hides a burden underneath his smiles and approachable personality.\n\nAnd because games adaptations were big in Japan in 2016, Kakihara was back to reprise yet another role, this time in the anime adaptation of the popular Otomate game, Code:Realize – Sousei no Himegimi.\n\nKakihara voiced Victor Frankenstein, an extremely intelligent researcher with ties to the English government that shares a lot of connections with the main character, even prior to their meeting.\n\nIn the anime series, although part of the main cast, Victor is a supporting character to the canon, Arsène Lupin.\n\nAs far as otome game adaptations went in 2016, DYNAMIC CHORD took the title as worst adaptation.\n\nPoor animation – if any -, confusing plot that starts way after the events of all 4 main games, weird – almost unrecognizable – character art and lack of any depth made Dynamic Chord pale a lot in comparison with the high quality of the visual novels.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara reprised his role as Seri Yuisaki, Liar-S’ drummer and a bit of an obsessive, mentally unbalanced person. Those that watched the anime series – and managed to complete it – may have not seen anything of what I mentioned in this paragraph and that is because, Seri has little to no spotlight in this series.\n\nThere was potential for Kakihara to deliver another chilling performance but the anime went in a whole different direction, making his role as Seri completely irrelevant.\n\n2018 was a quiet year for Kakihara, picking up multiple supporting roles in a couple of anime series.\n\nA year later, in 2019, Kakihara was back on track with some interesting leading roles under his belt.\n\nHe voiced one of the main characters, Dainichi Nyorai, in the anime adaptation of the DMM online fantasy game, Namu Amida Butsu!: Rendai Utena.\n\nEnsemble Stars! was green lit for anime adaptation and, in 2019, the anime premiered in Japan.\n\nKakihara reprised his role as Subaru Akehoshi, cheerful, passionate member of TRICKSTAR. He’s also the main protagonist of the Ensemble Stars!’s story and a beloved character among the fans.\n\nHis demeanor always puts a smile on the face of those around him, on stage however, his energy is infectious, being impossible of taking your eyes off of him.\n\nIn 2020, Tetsuya Kakihara was cast in the comedy / romance anime My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! as Keith Claes.\n\nKeith is a playboy that hasn’t known what love is up until the story’s protagonist, playing the role of villainess, tries her best to change the outcome of her character in the game.\n\nAlthough timid, Keith is pretty aware of his looks and can use those to his advantage should he have the need.\n\nThis is one of the highlight roles of Kakihara in 2020.\n\nStill in 2020, Kakihara was cast as Chuuya Nakahara in the adventure / fantasy anime series, Bungou to Alchemist: Shinpan no Haguruma.\n\nThe premise of the series was of renowned Japanese authors to try to preserve literature which, as a concept, is quite confusing.\n\nAlthough well executed and pretty refreshing – as far as anime featuring Japanese authors is -, the anime failed to have a consistent pacing and be interesting for those that were not familiar with the stories being adapted, leading to mixed reviews.\n\nKakihara was cast to voice the main character, Sensui Kanzaki, in what is one of the most disappointing anime series to be aired in 2020: Gibiate.\n\nThis is simultaneously an historical anime series and a futuristic anime series which, by itself was a big unique, yet confusing.\n\nThe anime was promoted to no-end about its top tier cast, unique story, how it aimed at targeting the foreign market and how their OST team was awesome.\n\nAnd the cast was top tier, the OST team is awesome, only the anime didn’t deliver anything.\n\nThis is an odd case of an overly hyped anime with everything to go well and, in a weird turn of events, turned into the laughing stock of the year.\n\nWrapping up the year, Kakihara reprised his role as the idol / hacker Kira in the Japanese localized version of the otome game, Koi to Producer: EVOL×LOVE.\n\nIn the Winter 2020 season, Kakihara reprised his role as Yukishiro Azuma in the anime adaptation of the popular theatre-centric game, A3! AUTUMN & WINTER.\n\nIn the same season, Kakihara reprised his role as You Haduki in Tsukiuta. The Animation 2.\n\nKakihara counted with minor and or supporting roles in other anime series such as:\n\nKuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan\n\nShow By Rock!!\n\nYu☆Gi☆Oh!

Iruma-kun\n\nBORUTO – NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS\n\nThrough ups and downs and new challenges, the journey continues for Tetsuya Kakihara as he further solidifies himself as one of the best seiyuu of his generation, a mentor for the young generations of seiyuu and an inspiration for all foreigners fighting for a chance to join the seiyuu industry and venture into a career as a seiyuu.\n\nAwards\n\nIn 2007, and coming as a big surprise, Tetsuya Kakihara won the Best Rookie Award at the 1st Seiyuu Awards.\n\nHe was given the award for his impressive performance as Yutaka Mikoto in the comedy and action anime, Princess Princess.\n\nHe shared the award with fellow male seiyuu, Masakazu Morita.\n\nRadio\n\nRadio has been one of the fields in which Kakihara has been active – with some consistency – since his debut in 2002.\n\nHe has 2 decades of radio shows under his belt and, since early on he showcased his talkative and friendly nature in all radio shows he’s hosted or guested in.\n\nThe 1st radio show he’s participated in was 走れ!marine wave (Ashire! marine wave) back in 2002. However, it took him 5 years to get his own radio show.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara’s Super Radi! started airing in 2007 yet, unfortunately, it wrapped up in the exact same year.\n\nLet’s have a look at some of his most relevant radio shows over the years:\n\nKakihara Tetsuya no KKHR Radio (2013 – 2015)\n\nFor 2 years, Kakihara collaborated with his former seiyuu vocational school, Amusement Media Gakuin, with a special radio show.\n\nIn Kakihara Tetsuya no KKHR Radio, Kakihara invited students from Amusement Media Gakuin to be interns, teaching them how the animation industry works, sharing his own experience and knowledge in order to support those that want to become voice actors.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara and Reona Irie’s Mega Training Station !!!（2014 – )\n\nIn 2014, Tetsuya Kakihara started co-hosting Tetsuya Kakihara and Reona Irie’s Mega Training Station !!! alongside fellow seiyuu and close friend, Reona Irie.\n\nThe show focuses on all things otaku but with a focus on merchandise from games and anime. The duo exudes a natural chemistry that makes the show flow in a pretty unique, laidback way.\n\nThis is one of Kakihara’s longest running radio shows.\n\nNama mail presents Kakihara to Ryuta no Radio + (2014 -)\n\nIn the same year, Kakihara started co-hosting the – now – long running radio show, Nama mail presents Kakihara to Ryuta no Radio +.\n\nTsuda Kenjiro to Kakihara Tetsuya no Miwaku no no pan Radio (2014 – 2017)\n\nIn 2014, Tetsuya Kakihara joined fellow seiyuu Kenjiro Tsuda to host Tsuda Kenjiro to Kakihara Tetsuya no Miwaku no no pan Radio, radio show produced by LOVE & ART.\n\nUnison! Tuesday (2015-2018)\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, Tetsuya Kakihara was in charge of hosting the Tuesday broadcasts of Unison!.\n\nFrom showcasing pride about his German roots, Kakihara also invited fellow seiyuu on the show. Among the guests were Atsushi Abe, Hiroyuki Yoshino, and Soma Saito.\n\nKakihara Tetsuya Hatanaka Tasuku Bokura ga kimi o Shiawaseni suru Radio (2018 -)\n\nIn 2018, Tetsuya Kakihara teamed up with Tasuku Hatanaka for the radio show, Kakihara Tetsuya ・ Hatanaka Tasuku Bokura ga kimi o Shiawaseni suru Radio.\n\nThe show was created to promote Voltage Inc.’s games.\n\nOther radio shows he’s guested in or hosted include:\n\nPrincess Princess RADIO Fujimori Gakuen A to Z (2006)\n\nGurren-Lagann Radio (2007)\n\nRadio Love Route Zero from Labyrinth (2007-2009)\n\nRadio Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (2008-2010)\n\nTokyo Anime Center RADIO (2008-2009)\n\nKakihara Tetsuya・Morikawa Toshiyuki no BRAVE10 on the radio（2011 – 2012)\n\nRadio sekai Fushigi Hakkenden! (2013)\n\nRadio Divine Gate (2015 – 2016)\n\nRADIO MIRACLE6 (2018)\n\nGames\n\nThere is no doubt about it.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara is one of the most prolific voice actors in otome games. By now he’s considered a household name at Otomate, voicing characters for multiple games part of the developer’s repertoire.\n\nHe’s also a big name in action and RPG’s however, with a vast repertoire in this field, I will only be mentioning a couple of big roles of his and mention a couple of other games worth checking out.\n\nKakihara’s first role in games was Krein Kiesling in the RPG game, Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana in 2004. Since then he counts with over 100 credits in games with over 50% of those being in otome games.\n\nHere’s other most notable roles of his in games:\n\nJin Kisaragi in BlazBlue Series (2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015)\n\nTetsuya Kakihara’s longest running role in games is Jin Kisaragi in the BlazBlue series. Adding to the fact that Kisaragi is a main character in the franchise is the fact that he’s a fan favorite.\n\nKakihara’s voiced and reprised his role in the fighting game series for 5 times.\n\nSakutaro Morishige in Corpse Party (2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015)\n\nSakutaro Morishige is one of Kakihara’s most iconic and – equally – disturbing roles.\n\nThis is a character like no other Kakihara has voiced in his career.\n\nMorishige may look like the regular high schooler however, he slowly gives in to madness and ends up being one of the most disturbing characters in the series.\n\nKakihara delivered his best as Morishige making those performances stand out like no other.\n\nHe’s voiced and reprised the role several times across the series’ 5 games and even its own anime series.\n\nShin in AMNESIA (2011 – 2014)\n\nThis is one of Kakihara’s first big roles in otome games.\n\nShin comes off as a cold, detached character on a first look but slowly he starts opening up to the heroine.\n\nProblem is, the way he shows his love and affection can be twisted to a point that Shin is wildly known as a yandere character.\n\nThe AMNESIA franchise was so popular in Japan that it spawned a couple of sequels and was ported to different gaming systems for a period of 3 years.\n\nShin still ranks pretty high on Otomate’s annual character rankings.\n\nZhu Ran in the Dynasty Warriors Series (2013, 2014, 2018)\n\nIn 2013, Tetsuya Kakihara was chosen to voice Zhu Ran in the popular hack & slash game series, Dynasty Warriors.\n\nHe has voiced Zhu Ran in Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends, Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires and Dynasty Warriors 9.\n\nVictor Frankenstein in Code: Realize − Guardian of Rebirth (2014 – 2016)\n\nIn 2016, Kakihara was cast as the intelligent researcher with ties to the British government, Victor Frankenstein, in the adventure otome game, Code: Realize − Guardian of Rebirth.\n\nCode: Realize − Guardian of Rebirth was so popular that it counted with a fandisk in 2016 and was adapted to anime in 2016.\n\nMio Yamanobe in I-Chu (2015 -)\n\nIn 2015, Kakihara was chosen to voice Mio Yamanobe in the rhythm game, I-Chu.\n\nYamanobe is part of RE:BERSERK, group that follows a dark master and servant theme.\n\nYamanobe looks like a sweet, devoted character – and is, depending on who he’s interacting with – but has a twist, going for a rougher, colder demeanor in front of those with whom he’s openly hostile.\n\nSubaru Akehoshi in Ensemble Stars! (2015 -) / Ensemble Stars!! MUSIC (2020 -)\n\nSince 2015, Tetsuya Kakihara is in charge of voicing TRICKSTAR‘s sunshine member, Subaru Akehoshi.\n\nBy many their favorite character, Akehoshi is know for his bright personality and passionate demeanor that make everyone around him smile.\n\nAs Akehoshi, Kakihara delivers a performance filled of energy and with a youthful edge.\n\nSeri Yuisaki DYNAMIC CHORD feat.Liar-S (2005)\n\nHe voiced Seri Yuisaki, Liar-S’ leader and drummer. He’s a childhood friend of the main character in the visual novels (the player) but despite loving the main character, he’s always been in the friendzone.\n\nWhen playing the game, you will notice how gradually more obsessive he gets, to the point that he can be considered a mentally unbalanced person.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara was once again on top of his yandere game for this role, for a character that, let’s be honest, doesn’t have any genuinely good endings in its route.\n\nFins in Walpurgis no uta ~Walpurgisgedichte~ (2015)\n\nAlthough there’s nothing outstanding coming from the game or the performances by most of the cast in the otome game, Walpurgis no uta ~Walpurgisgedichte~, I feel like Kakihara’s role as Fins is worth mentioning.\n\nThis is one role in which fans will be delighted to know that Kakihara got to do voice work in 2 languages: Japanese and German, his native language.\n\nThe German parts in the game are brief – a poem by Goethe – but set a really cool tone to this game.\n\nPrompto in Final Fantasy XV (2016)\n\nFinal Fantasy XV had a trouble development – taking almost 10 years in production, with seiyuu recording lines during that period of time – and, when the game hit stores, it wasn’t particularly well received by Final Fantasy purists.\n\nAs someone that has played the game, Final Fantasy XV isn’t a bad as people like to paint it, I dare even say that the game is a solid, fun RPG with a roadtrip theme however, it is obvious midway through how much the game ended up being rushed.\n\nThere’s a big chunk of story that isn’t there and if you’re playing while paying attention to the story, this is something that you can’t help but to feel.\n\nBut for what it ended up being, Final Fantasy XV is a solid game with good mechanics, cool animations, realistic visuals and good voice acting and that includes Tetsuya Kakihara’s performance as Prompto, a passionate photographer with a rather tragic backstory.\n\nYou’ll find yourself empathizing with Prompto the more he tells you his story and his insecurities. Kakihara gave off an honest and natural performance that make the character memorable among that “band of brothers” vying to protect Prince Noctis.\n\nYukishiro Azuma in A3! (2017 -)\n\nIn 2017, Tetsuya Kakihara joined the cast of the popular theatre-centric franchise, A3!.\n\nHe voices Yukishiro Azuma, member of the Winter Troupe, well known for being a flirt and exuding a certain sex appeal that make it impossible for others to ignore his presence.\n\nThe character is still rather shrouded in mystery, especially his occupation and age, but as time has passed since the game’s launch, that mysterious aura is slowly turning into one of Azuma’s charm points.\n\nMomotaro Onzai in B-PROJECT Kaikan＊Everyday\n\nIn 2019, Kakihara reprised his role as Momotaro Onzai, the quiet, slightly mysterious and passionate member of MooNs, in the smartphone game, B-PROJECT Kaikan＊Everyday.\n\nThe game would stop distribution in the middle of 2020.\n\nOther games Kakihara has voiced characters in include but not limited to:\n\nVALHALLA KNIGHTS (2006)\n\nPRISM ARK -AWAKE- (2008)\n\nShining Force CROSS (2009)\n\nGARNET CRADLE (2009)\n\nTHE EXORCISM OF MARIA (2009)\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki (2010)\n\nFairy Tail Series (2010, 2011, 2012, 2019)\n\nWand of Fortune (2010)\n\nTrails to Azure (2011)\n\nSengoku Paradise – Kyoku – (2011)\n\nKoibana Days (2013)\n\nJewelic Nightmare (2013)\n\nSummon Night 5 (2013)\n\nShiratsuyu no Kai (2013)\n\nMakai Ouji Devils and Realist Dairiou no hihou (2013)\n\nCV: Casting Voice (2014)\n\nThousand Memories (2014)\n\nBAD MEDICINE (2014)\n\nLost Dimension (2014)\n\nCross World (2015)\n\nPsychedelica of The Black Butterfly (2015)\n\nTouken Ranbu (2015)\n\nROOT∞REXX (2015)\n\nBlackish House sideA→ (2016)\n\nBungo to Alchemist (2016)\n\nTsukino Paradise (2017)\n\nKING OF PRISM Prism Rush! LIVE (2017)\n\nAnidol Colors (2017)\n\nDREAM!ing (2018)\n\nKenka Bancho Otome 2nd Rumble!! (2019)\n\nCaptain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions (2020)\n\nActing\n\nSince his debut in the seiyuu industry, Kakihara has done a bit of everything, trying to branch out and showcasing his talents in a wide variety of fields even outside the seiyuu industry.\n\nIn one of those said branch out opportunities for him came a roll in a Japanese tokusatsu movie, his 1st and, so far, only acting credit.\n\nChikyu Senshi ZEROS (2014)\n\nIn 2014, he joined the cast of the live-action movie 地球戦士ゼロス (Chikyu Senshi ZEROS), an Ultraman-inspired movie.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara and fellow seiyuu Toshiki Masuda played rival roles for this movie.\n\nNarration / Dubbing\n\nTetsuya Kakihara has very few narration credits under his belt.\n\nThose are Anitele Presents Anison Plus + (2010), Kiramune Company R / L (2016) and 10min. Box Chiri (2017).\n\nNow, when it comes to dubbing foreign movies and TV series, Kakihara has quite a few credits to his name.\n\nThose include Admission, The Girl in the Spider’s Web, The Long Way Home, Meet Bill, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (as Leonardo), Enter Nowhere, Baltic Storm, The Monuments Men, I’m in the Band, Naturally, Sadie, between many more.\n\nDrama CDs\n\nDrama CDs are yet another field in which Tetsuya Kakihara has always shone since his debut.\n\nHe’s picked up multiple credits in regular/otome drama CDs as well as BL (boys love), although, in recent years, he’s completely halted his work in BL.\n\nKakihara tends to voice characters that are rather intense and eccentric.\n\nAside from a couple of gentle, tsundere roles in otome games, he’s got plenty of yandere roles under his belt in drama CDs such as BAD MEDICINE, VANQUISH BROTHERS, Jooubachi no Oubou – Kougou Hen and AMNESIA (more so in the games).\n\nHe’s a known name within Rejet‘s drama CDs, some stemming from games, others original works such as Renai Bancho 2, VANQUISH BROTHERS, BAD MEDICINE, Gekka Ryoran ROMANCE, etc., and he’s a household name for Otomate, having lent his voice to a wide variety of games from the developer: AMNESIA, Wand of Fortune, Code:Realize ~Sousei no Himegimi~, etc.\n\nStemming from his work in the AMNESIA games, he’s reprised his role as Shin plenty of times in otome drama CDs and bonus tracks included with the DVD release of the anime series adaptation.\n\nHe’s also got 9 credits as Lloyd Bannings (protagonist) in the drama CDs for the RPG game, The Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki.\n\nWhile at 81 Produce, Tetsuya Kakihara participated in 3 of the various drama CDs that the talent agency has released featuring their talents.\n\nGARNET CRADLE,\n\nOdayaka Kizoku no Kyuka no Susume.,\n\nOtomari Honey,\n\nwater cube,\n\nKaichou wa Maid Sama!,\n\nKimi to Wonder ★ Kiss!,\n\nLove Root Zero,\n\nMr. Love: Dream Date,\n\nKoisuru Lesson,\n\nTales of Hearts,\n\nHidoku Shinaide,\n\nIro Otoko,\n\nShitsuji Game,\n\nJewelic Nightmare,\n\nDOG DAYS,\n\nLove on Ride,\n\nROOT∞REXX.\n\nThis is not an extensive list. As always, I recommend you to check his Japanese wikipedia page entry for a more comprehensive and updated list of the drama CDs he’s been in.\n\nMusic\n\nWhile his very first endeavors singing were not really the best ones, Tetsuya Kakihara has sure grown a lot as a singer since his debut in the seiyuu industry.\n\nHis singing tone has a nasal-y touch, something that he has, to a point, worked around to lessen its impact in his singing. Back in the day, his singing sounded too strained or off key at most times, with heavy electronica in the background trying to mask his shaky performances.\n\nHe worked on his performances and especially on improving and polishing his singing skills. And, around Saichaina‘s era, it was noticeable that he was improving a lot as a singer.\n\nSince then, Kakihara has showcased a lot of control over his vocals, having robust, warm mid-tones at his disposal, as well as a delicate falsetto and some hints of vibrato here and there.\n\nHis vibrato is certainly trained as he didn’t have it when he started singing character songs and, ultimately, when he kicked off his career as a solo artist. It slowly made its entrance in Kakihara’s solo work around 2015, 2016.\n\nThe falsetto he does have goes a lot in line with the fact that he sounds really close to being a tenor – might even be a tenor, although with a much limited range in comparison with most tenors among male seiyuu.\n\nAccording to Tetsuya Kakihara himself, he does not bother with changing his style of singing to fit a character.\n\nHe believes that, if the producers cast him in a 2D music project, it is because they want his voice and his singing quirks, not a completely different singing style created from the ground up for a certain character.\n\nThis explains why Kakihara only adds some nuances to his performances but never changes his singing tone or does a complete overhaul of his voice tone to sound like somebody else.\n\nSolo career\n\nTetsuya Kakihara made his solo debut in 2010.\n\nHe was among the very first male seiyuu to join Kiramune, music label established a year earlier, focused on anisong and male seiyuu wanting to kick off a career in the music industry.\n\nHis solo debut was with the mini-album “still on Journey“, released in 2010. Fans found Kakihara tackling peppy pop, rock and electronica.\n\nIt wasn’t the most complete release in his career but still a solid debut release that, when you look back, you can’t help but to be proud of how much Kakihara has evolved as a singer.\n\nTwo years later, in 2012, Kakihara released his 1st mini-album, Continuous.\n\nThis release focused in a blend of rock with electronica with Chaos Breaker being a stand out song in it.\n\nHikari, song also in this release, was the first ever ballad Kakihara performed.\n\nThis, original version, had an R&B sound and a gentleness that, years later, in its rearranged version included in Circle of LIFE too on a completely different, an even more special turn.\n\nIn Continue, Kakihara showcased a bit of his skillset, showing a bit a comfort in his singing tone and adding falsetto to his performance.\n\nStill, it was noticeable in songs like “Hikari” how much Kakihara was still not on top of his game as a singer. That would change around 2015.\n\nIn 2013, Kakihara would have his first ever solo song featured in anime.\n\nString of Pain is Kakihara’s 1st single, counting with its title track featured as the ending theme for the action and supernatural anime, Hakkenden: Toho Hakken Ibun.\n\nAlthough this single wasn’t a massive change from the sound that Kakihara had been exploring, it was certainly more intense and focused on electronica than any other of his previous releases.\n\nThe single’s tie-up track is the delicate R&B ballad, 運命の引力 (Unmei no Inryoku).\n\nStill in the same year, Kakihara released his 3rd mini-album, Call Me.\n\nPop-rock dominated this release, which was a pleasant surprise, especially after coming from several releases in which electronica had its spotlight.\n\nCall Me‘s standout songs are Eternal screaming and ocean flying.\n\nBut the year wasn’t over for Kakihara that still had the time to release another CD before the end of the year.\n\nGENERATIONS was released in 2013 and showcased a comfortable, slightly improved Kakihara on vocals. It was the most consistent he had been since his solo debut in 2010.\n\nRock and pop continued to be the music genres driving his music forward.\n\n2014 arrived and with it came Dandigi dan. Although, so far, Kakihara’s solo career had been hitting more towards pop-rock, this mini-album was quite different and, as a result, unexpected.\n\nDandigi dan counted with an acoustic title track with danceable, Latin-inspired beat and melodies.\n\nOn the vocal end, instead of just going for singing, Kakihara mixed clean singing with rapping and was exuding a bit more charisma in his performances.\n\nThis mini-album didn’t improve on the sound and quality of previous ones, being pretty inconsistent at times. However, it is worth mentioning that Kakihara’s vocals kept improving, something that was starting to be highly noticeable.\n\nThose improvements and years of practice led to 2015’s outstanding single that is Saichaina.\n\nIn this release, fans found a more sensible and artistic Kakihara, with beautiful melodies and tasteful compositions making the single shine like no other release in his repertoire had managed to do before.\n\nThe title track, Saichaina, put the focus on Kakihara’s improved vocals, gliding throughout the track while showing control over his mid-toned vocals and his upper range.\n\nIt was a display of quality, of growth that impressed me at the time I reviewed the single.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the tie-up track Othello was the first ever time that fans got to enjoy a funk / disco inspired song from Kakihara – and it was tastefully crafted -, plus the fact that world in bloom was a solid EDM track with an ethereal touch and you got yourselves what was his best single to date.\n\nWrapping up 2015, Kakihara released his 1st full-length album, orange.\n\nAfter 5 years of exploring pop-rock and a bit of electronica and R&B, fans weren’t sure what to expect from the album itself.\n\nGroovy rock lead the way for the album, with LessonAtoB doing the honors. That was a quirky introduction that found Kakihara tackling a wide variety of voice tones, playing around throughout the song.\n\nThe album flows through a couple of rock tunes and R&B ballads and goes bonkers with electronica in monogram.\n\n飛行機雲 (Hikokigumo) stands as the biggest highlight in this release, a sweet song that mixes ballad elements with rock to deliver and inspiring tune.\n\nMoving on to 2016 and Tetsuya Kakihara released a new single, Susumasero!.\n\nAnd the air about Kakihara changed once again.\n\nFor this release Kakihara delivered a performance that mixed rapping and singing and he did so in a flashy, charismatic way that drew me in.\n\nRock was still a bit part of his sound but electronica, dirty synths mainly, were at the basis of the groove and danceable vibe to the title track.\n\nMy Way was a summery track driven by ukelele melodies. It was fresh and unusual coming from Kakihara.\n\nThe single wrapped up with the beautiful ballad, 碧く (Aoku), which is not only packed with emotion in its stripped down sound, but also a fantastic display of technique and control by Kakihara.\n\nStill in 2016, Kakihara released the single, Tokonatsu Wave.\n\nThe title track leaned more towards what was his debut sound, being upbeat and having an uplifting twist.\n\nAlthough the rest of the single held its own rather well, Tokonatsu Wave didn’t sound like an upgrade to his work so far as a solo artist.\n\n君はどう思ってるの (Kimi wa do omotteru no) took the crown as best song in this release.\n\nTo wrap up the year, Kakihara released the soulful mini-album, Circle of LIFE. In this mini-album, there was a massive leap in quality both in the instrumentals and Kakihara’s vocals.\n\nCircle of LIFE is a complete release that revisited Hikari, song originally released in 2012 and gave it a completely revamped sound, not to mention vocals that showcased the big improvement that Kakihara’s singing technique had taken up to that point.\n\nIt resulted in what is one of the most beautiful and chilling songs in his repertoire, a sure fire highlight in Circle of LIFE.\n\nThe mini-album counts with plenty of groovy tunes but never forgetting to nod at his upbeat, playful pop-rock debut sound.\n\n2 years after his last release, Kakihara was back and he had undergone yet another new changes to his sound and performances.\n\nDIAMOND BEAT was released in 2018 and was an incisive EDM-powered title track in which deep beats and synths created a dirty, hot and danceable soundscape, something that, up until then, Kakihara had never experimented.\n\nThis was long-awaited comeback and Tetsuya Kakihara more than met the expectations of his fans with a flawless release – counting as well with the beautiful ballad in ごめんね、ありがとう。(Gomen ne, arigato.) and the dreamy EDM pop tune, MOVING.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara was in a good spell and a couple of months later, still in 2018, released his 2nd full-length album, I for U.\n\nI seldom hand full marks to full-length albums as there’s a lot going on in an album that can change its flow and tone, there may be some weird mixing or some subpar performances – it happens will all artists -, but for this album, there wasn’t any other score I could hand.\n\nI for U is genuinely a flawless album. Easily one of the best released by a male seiyuu.\n\nFrom the soulful HERE FOR U, to the funky-rock Actors, to funk/disco vibes in Don’t Doubt! and the mature R&B/Funk in Last Lady, there was not a single song that was considered weak or lacking.\n\nBut it was 五月雨 (Go gatsu Ame) that stole the show for me. If there is a track that perfectly encapsulates the talent that Kakihara has as a singer, it’s this song.\n\nOne of the most beautiful songs I’ve listened and easily Tetsuya Kakihara’s best song released to date.\n\nAfter a successful 2018, he was back with new music in 2019.\n\nRiding on a lot of momentum and with quite some pressure from the quality of his past 2 releases, Tetsuya Kakihara confidently released United Star.\n\nThe mini-album had a simpler, brighter tone than his previous releases but the quality in the instrumentals and Kakihara’s vocals was still there.\n\nUnited Star is a really consistent mini-album that starts on a cool note and wraps up with a flair and maturity that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nA couple of months later, still in 2019, Tetsuya Kakihara released his 7th mini-album, GET OVER HERE.\n\nThe title track exuded and old-school pop sound that was addictive from the get-go.\n\nThe nods to the 90s in the instrumental were executed in a tasteful. Kakihara was sounding even more confident and natural as a singer, shining in every track on GET OVER HERE.\n\nThe mini-album is clearly heavily influenced by funk-rock and has a nostalgic, retro feel that, paired up with a Tetsuya Kakihara in top of his form as a singer, was recipe for another rock solid release.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that, in this release, Kakihara performed one of his songs with 3 quarters-Japanese, 1 quarter-German lyrics.\n\nI am talking about wundervolle Nacht, the funky goodness in this mini-album, and one of its highlights.\n\nWe arrive in 2020 and Tetsuya Kakihara released his 3rd full-length album, Live in ToKyo.\n\nDue to having not reviewed the album by the time of the release of this Seiyuu Digest, I won’t dive into it (although I hope it is good).\n\nLive tours\n\nOn a live setting, Kakihara has grown a lot from a bit shy and uncomfortable to a confident, charismatic performer.\n\nSince his debut in 2010, Kakihara has held 7 live tours, with the 1st one in 2013, Kakihara Tetsuya 1st Live “GENERATIONS”.\n\nBelow is a snippet of the buddle of fun that are Kakihara’s live performances.\n\nSpecial Seiyuu Units\n\nWithin Kiramune, Kakihara has collaborated with some artists.\n\nIn 2012, he performed the first ever VERSUS live alongside labelmate, Daisuke Namikawa. However, from this collaboration, nothing concrete came in terms of new music.\n\nBy 2017, the VERSUS live shows welcomed Hiroyuki Yoshino, but it wasn’t until 2018 that the trio would collaborate to release a single titled “We’ll Versus / VERSUS“.\n\nCheck the video below for a taste of their 2018 live as well as a snippet of “VERSUS”.\n\nBut that wasn’t the only experience Kakihara got in a special seiyuu unit.\n\nIn 2020, Tetsuya Kakihara teamed up with labelmate Nobuhiko Okamoto to release what is one of the year’s best albums, trust and play.\n\nThe duo shared writing credits for this release, penning some of the best songs in the release.\n\nThe highlight of the release is the groovy “one morning“, song in which Kakihara and Okamoto were in perfect harmony, nailing the mature vibe of the track to release a stellar performance.\n\nUnits\n\nAround the 10s, Kakihara started to be a big presence in the 2D music industry, making into the lineups of several popular groups and projects.\n\nLet’s go over some of the best known groups he’s a part of or was a part of.\n\nProcellarum (2012 -)\n\nIn 2012, Tetsuya Kakihara was announced alongside Ryohei Kimura, Shouta Aoi, Wataru Hatano, Takashi Kondo, Kensho Ono, as part of Tsukino Production’s pop unit, Procellarum.\n\nSo far the group has released 2 singles:\n\nONE CHANCE? (2015)\n\nLOLV -Lots of Love- (included in the Tsukiuta. THE ANIMATION Theme Song CD)\n\nThe best of albums Shirotsuki (2016) and Kuro Mochizuki (2019) featured group and solo songs.\n\nProcellarum are going to release a new single in June 2020 titled White Sparks.\n\nAs You Haduki, the male representative for the month of August within Procellarum, Kakihara got to perform 4 solo singles:\n\nGenau!

He’s made that well known a lot of times but the most obvious of all was during an episode of Kakihara Tetsuya no Hiza Kurige back in 2018.\n\nInfectious laugh\n\nIt is well known among Kakki’s fans that he does have a pretty infectious laugh and a smile that instantly, and reflexively, will make you smile. That’s a healing smile right there.\n\nSEIYUU LOUNGE returns in February 2021"
