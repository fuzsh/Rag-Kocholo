Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines.\n\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority.\n\n[Source: AniDB]\n\nWagaya no Oinari-sama.\n\nTV (JP)\n\nReleased\n\n7.69\n\nZEXCS\n\nLight Novel\n\n24 eps × 24m\n\nThe Mizuchi bloodline has long been hunted by Yokai, or monsters.

Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.\n\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \"the Metal.\"\n\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.\n\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual's consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.\n\nExperts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.\n\nThis is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.\n\n[Source: Production I.G]\n\nStrait Jacket\n\nRLS (JP)\n\nReleased\n\n7.69\n\nfeel.\n\nLight Novel\n\n3 eps × 26m\n\nIt is the world where magic and science coexist.

She lives in a house with her husband, her kids and her parents. The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults.\n\n[Source: AniDB]\n\nOnegai♪My Melody Kirara★\n\nStudio Comet\n\nSource Unknown\n\n52 eps × 20m\n\nSequel to Onegai My Melody Sukkiri.\n\nNet Ghost Pipopa\n\nStudio HIBARI\n\nSource Unknown\n\n51 eps × 24m\n\nAbout a young boy named Akigawa Yuta who gets sucked into a virtual world through his cell phone.
