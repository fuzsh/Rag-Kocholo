        "text": "Arakawa Ep 2. The more I think about it, the more this series resembles Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. A crazy cast, a surreal sense of humor, and a chain of unpredictable short clips all wrapped up in a neat little shell. And the animation is so SHAFT. :D Easily one of the better series of the season, if not the best. I definitely have no regrets picking up this series since I was already in dire need of a good comedy. Pretty crazy stuff though. I wouldn't exactly say it's for everyone. SHAFT has come up with some crazy stuff, but this definitely takes the cake.\n\nEVERYTHING WILL BE A-OK.\n\nAngel Beats Ep 2. Honestly, I was fairly surprised at this one. They definitely cleaned up the animation a bit. Still, not much more in terms of plot development. They jump right in and end it without much explanation. The whole thing is moving too quickly for me. They really should slow down and try to explain things better, maybe add a bit of character development. The flashback scene was a bit awkward. It just wasn't enough drama to offset the general lack of seriousness of the whole episode. It ended with a bang, quite literally. It definitely didn't come up short in terms of special effects. Intro theme was pretty good and the BGM is fantastic, as expected from KEY. I'm still really not seeing the KEY story here though. At the moment, I can't seem to describe the genre of this anime as anything less than a watered down comedy with its very occasional sparks of action.\n\nGiant Killing Ep 2. I still cannot seem to properly formulate an opinion on this series. It's not bad, but it's not particularly exciting either. I have a feeling it's due to my lack of experience with sport anime, but I really can't seem to find anything \"outstanding\" about this series in terms of plot. I wasn't too impressed with the artwork, but the overall quality of the animation isn't too bad. The series is still moving pretty slowly - typical characters and an overall typical story (new coach trying to improve the underdog team). Still, it's a rather nice change of pace since I haven't heard of any other good sport anime in a while.\n\nRainbow Ep 1. I wasn't expecting this anime to be all super happy sunshine but it was unexpectedly explicit (for me). This anime is as serious as it gets. Not terribly gruesome per se, but it is terribly brutal. I honestly haven't seen much like this. It will not make you smile. If anything, it will make you want to turn your head. Pretty deep stuff."
