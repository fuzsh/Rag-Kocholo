        "text": "Virat Kohli, well, this is a name which, for sure, needs no introduction. He has carved out a niche for himself in the sphere of cricket. This has propelled him to celebrity status in a few short years. He is indeed India's pride and, not to forget, an international heartthrob, with a ton of fans from every corner of the world. We are sure that his striking good looks and unmatched skills on the field have made zillions of ladies fall madly in love with him. Plus, Virat does possess a personality that is to die for. His striking character comes through in everything he does, from the way he talks, walks, dresses and even in his home. Virat Kohli's house is indeed a masterpiece brimming with class and elegance.\n\nThis classy personality is reflected in all its splendour at Virat Kohli’s house in Gurgaon and Virat Kohli's house in Mumbai. The plot area of this house, belonging to this star player, is 500 sq. yards, and it is built upon an area of 10,000 sq. ft. His home boasts unique architecture, which gives off the vibes of a modern-day castle.\n\nWithin the house and its exterior, there is the extensive usage of geometric patterns and designs, probably owing to the fact that Virat has a strong affinity for shapes & numbers. The home's interiors are indeed breath-taking as it is the perfect blend of modern vibes with hints of ethereal glamour sprinkled throughout the house.\n\nVirat Kohli's house in Delhi was the first home that he owned. It was here that the Indian cricket team's captain, Virat Kohli, spent most of his formative years in the Uttam Nagar area in western Delhi. It was in this area that he grew up and where his roots in the sport started to grow. This humble abode is a far cry from his present home. Still, the initial glimpse of his taste for classy and aesthetically pleasing architectural elements can be traced in this house too. Virat Kohli’s old house was located in the residential area called Paschim Vihar, Meera Bagh, and then eventually, he and his family moved into the luxurious bungalow in Gurugram, Haryana.\n\nVirat Kohli House’s Address\n\nVirat Kohli's house address Delhi\n\nMeera Bagh,\n\nPaschim Vihar,\n\nDelhi metro green line.\n\nThis is the house he grew up in.\n\nThe address of Virat Kohli’s Gurugram house\n\nDLF City, Phase -1,\n\nBlock-C, Gurgaon.\n\nThis house is an architectural masterpiece.\n\nVirat Kohli’s Mumbai house address, the one he shares with his wife Anoushka Sharma\n\n35th floor of the Omkar '1973'\n\nWorli, Mumbai.\n\nThese are all of Virat Kohli's house addresses.\n\nVirat Kohli’s house price Viral Kohli’s house in Delhi is estimated at a price of around ₹80 Crores. While his house in Mumbai costs around ₹35 Crores. Both houses are lavish and built to perfection. To know more about Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s Gurgaon and Mumbai house, read the article below.\n\nVirat Kohli Gurgaon House Photos\n\nIf you are wondering what the luxurious Gurugram home of this star cricket player looks like, here are some Virat Kohli house photos to give you an idea.\n\nIf you are wondering what Virat and Anushka’s Mumbai home looks like, here are some Virat Kohli house photos in Mumbai:\n\nWhy We Love Virat Kohli’s House\n\nIt's an impressive structure\n\nMoving away from the hustle and bustle of the streets located near Meera Bagh, Kohli and his family moved to this beautiful home in DLF Phase 1, Gurugram. Virat Kohli’s Gurgaon house is a majestic architectural feat that has been covered by several magazines.\n\nWhen you first look at the house, the house looks like a group of boxes that are resting on top of each other. But then, when you look closely and start paying attention, you notice that this beautiful home is, in fact, a 3D abstraction of an interlocking geometric structure, and we all know how fond of geometry and geometric patterns the homeowner is. There is speculation that the Indian cricketer is believed to have spent Rs.80 crore for this luxurious home.\n\nThe Indian captain has kept the drawing room in his abode reasonably simple. The dark-coloured wall that forms an excellent pallet forms the base of the room; it is ideal as it balances out the wooden furniture that adorns the room. It also helps bring out the giant lamp that works as art decor and as a functional piece in the space.\n\nVirat Kohli's house is priced to have cost an estimated amount of Rs.80 crore, and we believe it is worth every penny. There is a glass wall in the space that overlooks the alley, making the area clearly attractive and a sight to behold. A beautiful round candle holder is also placed in the room that has peeked a lot of interest since it was first seen on Anushka Sharma's Instagram story.\n\nSpread over 500 square yards, this beautiful house boasts features that have been carefully designed to keep every area within Virat Kohli’s house open and accessible, thus ensuring that good positive vibes and good energy flow through. The careful placement of light also appears to be deliberately designed to avoid too much glare while illuminating paths.\n\nFun Living Room\n\nWhen Virat moved into the Bungalow, located in Gurugram in 2015, Kohli held a private party for his fellow Indian cricket teammates. Some of the big shots from the sports, music, and entertainment industries were seen at this event.\n\nSome of the Indian cricket team’s players who are huge fans of console games and play games online are said to have been in awe of Virat's arcade station in his living room. It does offer excellent seating space and a large TV to quench their thirst for games, with a fully equipped playing console. Set under the beautiful roof pattern design and with the perfect vertical gardening lining the room, the gaming experience in this space is indeed exquisite.\n\nVirat's Unique Hanging Pool\n\nFor its fantastic price, this abode comes packed with some of the best features. Virat Kohli’s Residence in Gurugram is an ideal example of a modern mansion in the 21st century. It goes without saying that everything, and when we say everything, what we mean is every single piece in this house is stunning and gives off and complements the luxurious and elegant vibes of the place. If the beautiful interiors, gorgeous floors, and a carefullycrafted structure haven’t already fascinated you, well then, get this, nestled within this house, there is a unique hanging block. This acts as a hidden pool within Virat Kohli’s house and is always something that amazes new visitors.\n\nJust across the sprawling garden, which, according to Instagram, is Anoushka's favourite part of the house, there is a tile path that leads to a rustic looking wooden staircase. Climb these stairs, and you shall reach the hanging pool. It seems like every boy’s dream, a treehouse with a pool. The only difference is this hanging pool is just as classy and glamorous as the rest of the house.\n\nMany trolls have taken to social media claiming that Virat Kohli’s house was a waste of money. Though wasting money is one thing, creating a house that is a work of art is an entirely different ball game, and that is something Kohli did with his Gurugram Bungalow. It is a work of art.\n\nThe cricketer follows a strict dietary lifestyle due to his profession and also personal ethics. Anushka Sharma, his wife, is also into training and gyming. Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's Gurgaon house has a well-equipped gym which is regularly used. The cricketer posts videos of his workout routine on his Instagram page.\n\nVirat Kohli's Delhi home is in a prime location and offers all luxe amenities.\n\nVirat Kohli's house and lifestyle are built to complement his profession. The above image features his cricket kit and his bag. The cricketer is constantly on the road due to tournaments and championships.\n\nThe wooden flooring is elegant and minimal. The large cupboard in the background features a block geometrical design which adds volume and character to the room. The white false ceiling creates an illusion of a higher ceiling making the room appear larger. Each corner of Virat Kohli's house in Mumbai is thoughtfully built. The black switchboard in the background is basic yet bold.\n\nVirat Kohli and Anushka Sharma have a daughter together, Vamika Kohli. She was born on January 11, 2021. The couple has made sure to keep their daughters face-off of social media. With a gradual shift in their Instagram from a single couple to dotting parents, their house's interior has also changed.\n\nThe above picture shows an adorable picture of Anushka with her daughter, as the actor's mother watches over them. The light shaded drapes, and off-white interiors add to the serenity of the space.\n\nThe couple's house features light featured elements. Neutral pastel shades of white, grey, beige and black are prominent in their house decor. The couple likes to goof around and is affectionate towards each other on social media.\n\nThe above image features an adorable moment of the couple. While the background also showcases the beautiful home decor of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma's Gurgaon House. The engraved Buddha paintings add a certain charm to the room.\n\nVirat Kohli and Anushka Sharma have set certain standards for parenting. They have a strict no photo policy for their daughter set for the paparazzi. Virat Kohli also made the news when he took a paternal break from Cricket and, also when he missed the ODIs for Vamika's first birthday. Virat Kohli's house in Delhi is built perfectly for his family's convenience. The above is an adorable picture of Virat and Vamika in a play pan. The safety measures around the play area are highly impeccable.\n\nVirat Kohli’s Mumbai House\n\nVirat Kohli's house in Mumbai is equally grand as his bungalow in Gurugram.\n\nVirat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s house in Mumbai has been dubbed one of the swankiest celebrity pads in the city. Anushka Sharma and her cricketer husband Virat Kohli have kept their fans curious about the interiors of their lavish home located in Mumbai. Every time they give a sneak peek into their lives during the lockdown, their fans either end up marvelling at the view from their high-rise apartment or their sprawling balcony that boasts of its own share of greenery.\n\nThe whitewashed walls and furniture in light shades hint at the couple’s penchant for simplicity and minimalism, but the extensive view of the Mumbai skyline and the sea makes it a piece of luxury. The apartment was reportedly built on an area of over 7,000 square feet and cost the couple Rs. 34 crore a few years ago. It is located on the 35th floor of a residential building in Worli.\n\nAnushka has done enough to draw the attention of her fans to the various “sunlit” corners of her house as she shares pictures of the apartment. Besides a few art pieces on the walls, the couple, who are known to love living in green space, has added a fair share of greenery to the place. What they have done is, they have adorned the balcony and the balcony walls with several potted plants, in different hues of green, to keep them close to nature and add natural elements to the living space. They chose to have a lot of open space not just for themselves but for their pets too. The apartment also comes with a private gym area where Virat and Anushka often work out together.\n\nAnushka and Virat, who often spend time away from each other due to the demands of their profession, spent more than six months at a stretch, quarantined in their home for the first time during the first phase of the Mumbai lockdown. During this time Anushka took to her Instagram to share how she enjoys the quiet and peace, sipping a cup of coffee on her balcony cherishing the time she gets to spend with her husband and watching the sunrise. She shared a few pictures on Instagram and wrote, “And just like that, a coffee under the setting sun on the balcony of our home became a memory to hold. Captured by my beloved. ” Virat Kohli’s house in Mumbai is the home the couple intends to bring up their children.\n\nAnushka had once said that staying at home with Virat feels like a vacation to her. She had told Elle magazine in 2018, “Marriage doesn’t feel different. Virat and I have been working around the clock. We hardly spend time together. We both have very hectic lives. So, we live in a house, and we have spent barely any time in it. For us, home is, like, wow! It’s a vacation.” Their houses are decorated so that any corner of the hose can be used as a prime backdrop for an impromptu photoshoot.\n\nif you wish to make your house look like Virat's house just check out NoBroker interior design.\n\nIf you are a Virat fan and would like to have a house near Virat Kohli’s house in Gurgaon or Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli's house in Mumbai, we at NoBroker can help you.
