        "text": "There are very few television characters and actors who have instant connect with audiences across age groups; mythological characters are the ones, which fall into this category. It so happens that the actor gradually becomes synonymous to the mythological character he or she is playing on screen. Be it Lord Krishna, Ram or the evil Raavan, actors who have enacted these characters onscreen in the past are more likely to be known as these said characters.\n\nSimilar is the case with television’s new Mahabharat’s Draupadi; played be Pooja Sharma. Airing on Star Plus and produced by Swastik Pictures, Mahabharat will be turning one this September.\n\nAdgully caught up with model-turned actress Pooja Sharma to know more about her journey to television and more.\n\nThe Delhi born model-turned-actor was in the top 10 finalists in Femina Miss India 2006. Prior to Mahabharat, she did an episode of Teri Meri Love Stories with Karan Kundra.\n\nSpeaking about what stimulated to her to begin her career with a mythological show, she said, “When I first got a call to audition for Mahabharat, I was little sceptical as I always perceived mythological shows to be loud and that is the reason I did not want to be in that space. When I went for the audition and was told that the makers wanted me to audition for Draupadi, I thought is this what I really want to do? The transition in the mind came to me when I got my lines and I wore the costume. I then realized that the show and my character weren’t at all loud and larger than life. It was a very real, relatable character. Since then I could not wait for the show to go on floors and give my best to do justice to this extremely strong character of Indian mythology”.\n\nEvery aspiring and establish actor goes through the same process of training, learning and executing similar tasks. Sharing her experiences in the preparation process before entering the acting zone, she said, “It was more like an on-the-job training, where my preparations were on the set. I was one of the last few people to join the cast. I had a few meetings and discussions with the creative team, but beyond that the improvising happened slowly and gradually with every shooting day”. With time, Sharma said that she learned things right from the dialects and the accent to how to emote, cry, memorise lines, making the show a real training ground for her.\n\nSharing her thoughts on ‘real Draupadi’, Sharma believes that Draupadi was an immensely beautiful woman and possessed unmatched wisdom; while Draupadi was an epitome of strength and dignity, she managed to keep her self-esteem intact despite the trials and tribulations she was put through. “Throughout her life she had to face and overcome many struggles. I have learnt a lot from Draupadi and portraying this character has changed by life”. For playing Draupadi’s role I don’t consciously prepare myself every day when I go on sets. I believe to live a character one must get into the mind of the character and only then can an actor do full justice to the part. Many a times I forget I am Pooja until my director says cut!” she added.\n\nShedding light on the difficulties she faced while essaying Draupadi, Sharma thoughtfully said, “The ‘cheerharan’ sequence was a difficult one and especially to understand the psyche as to why these five men, who were husbands let her down. In the real sense, it was emotionally traumatic to put myself through reliving what Draupadi went through. In fact this sequence had even my co-stars and crew break down as they saw me deliver the powerful dialogues. This was not only the toughest scene but the highlight of my career so far and I am hoping that it has awakened many viewers and women over all to stand up and voice their views against any wrong doings meted at them.”\n\n“I have received really overwhelming response for the ‘Game of Dice’ sequence that led to Draupadi’s dishonour. Fans have loved the way I have performed and have wept with me; many fans come on sets and wait for hours to click pictures with us. Playing Draupadi has been awarding and I couldn’t have asked for more”, she shared.\n\nSpeaking about some of the learnings she has picked up from her stint with Mahabharat, Sharma said, “The woman of today must learn to have the grace and determination that Draupadi had at times standing rock solid and fighting all odds. No matter what the situation was, she always held her head high with dignity. I have also realized that we crib about smaller issues in life but she has been put through the acid test and faced the ultimate yet she managed to retain her strength and vigour”.\n\nConcluding the conversation, Sharma stated that while currently she is occupied with Mahabharat, she is still not open to sharing anything about her future projects.
