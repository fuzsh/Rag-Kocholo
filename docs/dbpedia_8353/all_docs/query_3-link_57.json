Draupadi's character was powerful for me and it made me strong,\" said Pooja.\n\nThis Sunday, the story of the show will be narrated through the eyes of Draupadi and it will show her journey from the beginning, her quest for revenge against the Kauravas which leads to the dawn of the Kurukshetra war.\n\n\"It will capture Draupadi's birth from fire to her marriage to Arjun, her disrobing which became the clarion call for the war and her friendship with Krishna,\" said Pooja, which is currently telecast again on Star Plus."
