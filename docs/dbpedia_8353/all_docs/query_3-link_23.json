My little stint of therapeutic painting after work nearly everyday before sleep brought me into a phase of self discovery & i painted of who i am 😇 . My immortal love for animals & fantasy of fairytales inspired all brush strokes with a story. Happiness to sell the paintings to smiling faces of art lovers in first ever exhibition has been nothing less than a soulful experience. Thank you 2023 for painting my year bright ❤️ 💛 💜 💙 💚 💖 PS: Start day at work with laptop and end with canvas 🎨 🦄 #dreambeyondwork #charity #wwf #artexpo #dreams #painting #artist #followyourdreams #ai"
