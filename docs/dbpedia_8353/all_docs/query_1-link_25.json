        "text": "SABHYATA....IT HAS TO START FROM US. WE CAN CHANGE THE NORM. This is one of our favorite advertisement from Sabhyata. I always have tears imaginging what woman has to go through while she has the best news of her life. I am yet to become a mother and I think every woman today has anxiety about her job, while she wants to shout and share the happiest news of her life. But she has to hide this news from her colleagues at work. Fear that she will lose her job or is treated like she is a waste now. \"Sabhyata\" is a Hindi word that can be translated to \"culture\" or \"civilization.\" It refers to the collective customs, traditions, and way of life of a particular group of people or society. It encompasses various aspects of a culture, including its art, language, social norms, and values. I urge at least all #womenleaders to support other women while they are pregnant and in case they wish to change their job, it should not a block for their progress. Create a new SABHYATA....IT HAS TO START FROM US. Talent is always a Talent. https://lnkd.in/dP5wRvd4 #diversityequityinclusionandbelonging #dei #womanhood #womanleaders #wellness #wellbeing #wellbeingatwork\n\nTo all men, I've been talking to #women from different #communities , and here's what they have to say: They wish women were celebrated every day like on #internationalwomensday. Not because they need special motivation or appreciation, but for men to realize that all women play an important role in the #universe, and it's #irreplaceable. While organizations celebrate Women's Day, I am reminded of an old tweet by Mr. Anand Mahindra. It depicted gender inequality in the corporate world by showing #men and #women running on an even sporting track, symbolizing corporate growth with equal opportuities . However, it also highlighted how women in the corporate world often have to juggle household chores along with their careers. To understand the intensity of this problem, you should watch \"The Great Indian Kitchen\" on Prime Video & Amazon Studios. It's a movie from my native place, but subtitles will help you understand it. There's still a lot to be done for women returning from a career break. Many champions are working towards this goal. One such person I follow is Lochan Narayanan (She/Her). Another important area is our homes. I read something interesting Hita Hejmadi wrote on her LinkedIn post about the various scenarious faced by working moms (a must read ). Also I've learned #resilience , #courage , and #determination from some single-parent women colleagues at Teqfocus. They manage household, work, and parenthood with #grace. I've also seen #men and #women working together as a team to achieve #success in #life and #career. One such team I work closely with is Andy Singh & Jas Kaur. I truly believe that the #young #generation of women rising up will make a huge impact on the world. Their presence will help build great economies. #InternationalWomensDay #WomensDay2024 #CareerBreak #WorkingMoms #Resilience #GenderEquality #Teamwork #youth #nextgeneration\n\nAre #DEI Teams addressing #Caste and working towards a casteless workplace, or are we inclined to continue working in a #Corporate bubble that denies the existence & negative impact of Caste at Indian workplaces and those all over the world. To people of the oppressed castes, #Castelessness can be #Liberating . In my opinion it would be liberating to groups of individuals working together in the DEI space too. #CasteBias would be addressed to a certain degree. At Vividhataa, a DEI Consulting Firm , we are currently using only first names for email ids as an attempt to achieve this. There are orgs which use an alphanumeric before/after the name as unique identifiers. What are you doing to keep your workplaces safe, #accessible and #inclusive for Caste Oppressed Communities. #Diversity #Equity #Inclusion \"Corporations should make caste sensitivity a part of the broader organisational training and shape it as an important part of inclusion priorities. And if this seems ornamental, then let‚Äôs adopt #AffirmativeAction and call for reservations in the private sector. See, made you raise your eyebrows, didn‚Äôt it?\" https://lnkd.in/gFr-eicD\n\n*Usual Thinking* - He rejected and blocked me on dating App. Nobody likes or wants me. *Healthier Thinking* : Why am I getting upset by getting rejected by a stranger I hardly know for the last 3 days. My family and friends have been loving and accepting me for over 30 years. *Usual Thinking* They call me girly and ugly. God, why am I like this? *Healtheir Thinking* : I am not girly, I don't fit into their definition or image of manly. I am not ugly, I don't fit into their definition of beauty. *Usual Thinking* : He called be Baliyaa, Chakka & Ijaada. I am frustrated with my life. *Healthier Thinking* : His beliefs and thinking are influenced by the society, environment and upbringing. He was not born hating me, he is behaving as per what he has been told and taught. He has nothing personal against me. *Usual Thinking*: What will people think if I come out as gay. I will be shamed... *Healthier Thinking* : I have absolutely no control over what people think about me. They will think depending on thier beliefs, upbringing and mood. Behaving as per their expectations and not mine is pretending. Do I want to spend my whole life faking. *Usual Thinking* : My parents didn‚Äôt support me. They critized, neglected and tortured me. They have ruined my life. *Healthier Thinking* : My parents did what they thought what was best for me. But now I am above 18, I can do what is best for me. Do I want to spend my life blaming them for the mess, or take responsibility for getting out of the mess. Tomo I will be talking about : 1. How to shift from usual response to healthier response 2. How to shift from - he is making me angry to why am I getting angry 3 How to shift from he is selfish & rude to he is not living upto my expectations or image I have of him.

In an amusing, entertaining and perceptive way, I find myself to be the embodiment of the 9 muses of Greek mythology. In a modern, figurative usage a #muse is a literal person that serves as someone's source of artistic #inspiration . A muse has always been known as the foundation of inspiration, arts, and wisdom. I have often asked myself why I never followed the path of a single career, and therein I found the multiple muses in myself through the variety of work and roles I engage in and enable others. The #comedian aka The MadBai allowed me to break through my own limitations. The #socialworker who willingly takes on any challenge as it comes along. The #mentalhealth worker who is fearless when addressing any stigma because only awareness is key to a holistic life. The #counselor because listening alone isn't my job. Providing guidance, nurture, and compassion are key to revival. The #curator who understands the need for constant creation and provides the foundation of doing. A #human being without the limits of gender, sexuality, bias or judgement. Why limit your existence to a career. This International Women's day be an inspiration to yourself, include all of yourself. Once you accept everything you are only then you will create an inclusive world for others. video montage by Onkar Pradhan #iwd2024 #inspireinclusion #womensday #talk #innovation #creativeexpression #artist #speaker #inspire #inspireinclusion #inclusion #performer #creativespeaker #anchor #emcee #entertainer\n\nThere is an Indian Tv show I watch. It‚Äôs a bit clich√©d to be honest but the sentiments behind it are what keep me watching. This is the story of a relatively young middle aged woman with grown up married children who started her life very traditionally. She was the typical Indian wife and daughter-in-law doing as was expected which is basically to serve others first - always. There was no scope for self care or ‚Äúme time.‚Äù Her worth was based on how well she fulfilled others‚Äô needs. She divorced her husband who had an affair. She went on to the next chapter of her life. This is the story of a woman who chose to fulfil her dreams that had been halted. This is a woman who started to stand up for herself. This is a woman who started to respect herself and acknowledge her worth. This is a woman who also remained a mother, remarried and adopted another young child. This is a woman who is showing other women globally, through her character, what is possible. Those who have felt held back, without a voice, without room for self-growth and self-success are seeing they can have more. This is important to me because as a South Asian female, I grew up with imposed barriers. I was told my ambitions of a career and motherhood couldn‚Äôt be combined. How wrong traditional thinking can be. It takes a family/village/tribe to support women to achieve their full potential as mothers/sisters/carers/daughters/career women and, rather than fear how successful they could be, we all need to embrace them. Let us combine our roles without fear or judgment. The more authentic and accepted we all are ( male, female or other), the greater the potential. Everyone benefits. #equality #inclusion #impostersyndrome #womeninleadership #india #starplus #confidence #workplaceculture #DEI\n\nI received many notes and wishes regarding International Women‚Äôs Day in my messenger today. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of those who sent the messages; however, something about ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Day‚Äù pokes at me. The fact that we need a day to recognize the value and contribution of women is a statement in itself (I also feel the same about Father‚Äôs Day, Mother‚Äôs Day and Valentine‚Äôs Day). When we love, honour and respect others, they are to be celebrated and appreciated every day. The differences between men and women are worthy of celebration and must be valued. When these differences are honoured and celebrated, they work in absolute balance and complement each other perfectly. Sadly, this is not the case in our society; however, setting aside one day a year to draw attention to this fact will not change the pattern of thought or behaviour. If we genuinely want to see a world where our differences are valued and celebrated, and accomplishments are honoured, it won‚Äôt be because we marked a day on the calendar to do so. The change begins with us individually and at a heart level. We must honour, celebrate and support each other authentically daily to reclaim our power and position as the matriarchs of our homes and communities, restoring the much-needed feminine aspect to our society. When we sink into the heart and feel the truth of who we are, the illusions propagated in society are dissolved. Only then can we affect the change we desire because, in the heart, we know our contribution, ability, power, and value both as an individual and a woman. Owning our power and celebrating our differences allows for simultaneously acknowledging all beings‚Äô value and contribution. This photo was caputured last year in Uttarakhand, India. These women are building a retaining wall by hand. #shiftsinperspective #perspecitve #healing #therapy #somticcoaching #spiritualguidance #awareness #consciousness #celebrate #society #illusion #India #womensupportwomen\n\nI don't fit into the mould of what they call \"a perfect Indian girl.\" I have always struggled to fit in the box. A box of being a: ‚Üí Girly girl. ‚Üí Girl next door. ‚Üí Traditional girl. I always used to beat myself up for not liking the things the girls around me liked. ‚Üí I used to be the only girl playing cricket with the boys. ‚Üí I used to read every book I used to get my hands on. ‚Üí I used to voice my opinions and revolt. This is why I never really gelled with most girls around me. The boys in my group used to ask me \"Are you even a girl?\" It had a drastic effect on my self confidence. But as I grew up, I realized there was nothing wrong with me. Maybe I don't like most things the girls around me like. But that doesn't make me any less of a girl or woman. And now, I don't try to fit into any of the \"normal boxes.\". Why am I sharing this? Because I know many people feel like this. If you are one of them, don't beat yourself up. You are just the way you are meant to be. If you know someone like this, please don't taunt them or degrade them because they don't like the usual stuff. Different people ‚Üí Different preferences. Let's create an inclusive society where no one tries to fit in but learns to embrace themselves as they are."
