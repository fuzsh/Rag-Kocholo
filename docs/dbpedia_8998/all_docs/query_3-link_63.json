        "text": "Do you also LOVE to use props in your music classes or music therapy sessions?\n\nToday I‚Äôm sharing some of my favorite props to use in my music classes and I will also be sharing some uses of props in music education and music therapy.\n\nWhat are props?\n\nLet‚Äôs start with talking about what props are. Props is a familiar term in the theater or film realm. Props (also called, hand props) are those objects that an actor may handle or manipulate to fulfill the characteristics or actions of a character. Some examples of those items are cellphones, canes, candles, beverages, etc.\n\nIn music education and music therapy, props are those items that music therapists and music educators use as an aid to reinforce or support movements, concepts, skills, exploration, imagination and our student‚Äôs or client‚Äôs creativity in the music space.\n\nSome examples of props we may utilize as music therapists and music educators are:\n\nBean bags\n\nScarves\n\nA parachute\n\nA stretchy band\n\nPuppets\n\nMy favorite props to use in music classes & sessions\n\n1. A clear, round container\n\nYes, a container! Especially in one-on-one music therapy, I cannot go without a really good container that can hold about 15 or 28 shakers and has a flip lid. The reason this is an incredible tool when you're working with kids is because there are many ways you can use them:\n\nYou can put things in it and use it with musical cues. In example, when an egg shaker drops into the big bucket, it makes this really satisfying sound that kids can anticipate and can be encouraging for kids to actually clean up and put things away.\n\nYou can take things out of it, or dump everything all at once (it can be really silly & fun üòä)\n\nYou can use it as a bowl for stirring (like pretending to making a soup!).\n\nYou can draw silly teeth or goggly eyes on the flip so that the container can actually ‚Äúchomp up‚Äù or ‚Äúeat‚Äù the eggs.\n\nYou can close the lid on it and use it as a giant shaker with all these other shakers inside of it.\n\n2. Scarves & Streamers\n\nI love scarves & streamers! I especially like that you can throw them in the washing machine on delicate, air-dry them and they're just like as good as new. My favorite streamers are from Bear Paw Creek, which is a website that specializes in creative movement props for music therapists and music educators.\n\nWhat I like about scarves is that they're see-through. Specifically when using the song ‚ÄúPeekaboo‚Äù (which I share the lyrics with you at the bottom of this page), scarves provide a level of safety and comfort for most kids to be able to put something on their head and ‚Äúhide‚Äù with it when they can also see through it.\n\nYou can do all kinds of things with scarves:\n\nA lot of my Music For Kiddos Community members really swear by this giant blue scarf that West Music sells. It's basically a giant blue, see-through scarf that everybody tells me it's far superior than a parachute because you can see through it and it's less stimulating.\n\n3. Stuffed Animals\n\nYou can use stuffed animals as a way to communicate with kids in a really safe way. When I worked in the hospital, I would ask kids if I could meet their stuffed animals. I would often just talk to their stuffed animals instead of talking to the child if they were feeling shy while they saw that I was a safe person. This way, I gave children their space by not talking to them directly if they weren't ready for that. You can also use them for very, very silly things to get kids to laugh, like dancing stuffed animals, stuffed animals that play instruments, stuffed animals that hide under things, stuffed animals that get into trouble (fun, right?!).\n\n4. Props from Games\n\nDice are really fun. Story cubes are really fun. Spinners are a blast. There are just such cool props that come with a lot of board games that many of us already have. Taking spinners as an example, maybe you have a little spinner that it's associated with a color, then maybe you have an instrument or a song assigned to that same color that was picked by the spinner that the child chose.\n\nIf you want a creative intervention idea using Jenga, I would recommend you download the free ‚ÄúMusical Jenga‚Äù session plan on Creative Therapy Umbrella‚Äôs website by Kate Shannon, LPC, MT-BC (P.S. she‚Äôs the creator of our course ‚ÄúOut of the Music Box‚Äù!)\n\n5. Play Food or Play Dishes\n\nThere is something about pretend food that is really, really funny, fun and very engaging for kids. It immediately shows them that you are creative, that you like silly ideas and that you will run with their ideas.\n\nKids can make you some food and you can enjoy it and be silly with it. If you want to shake things up a little bit with kids, especially when working one-on-one with them, bring a tea set to music time, put your pinkies up, put on a silly & fancy hat and have a tea party as part of your music time that day.\n\nI encourage you to bring out these props and see what kind of creative ideas kids bring to you. Creativity can be mirrored in many ways, especially with kids. Kids are so creative and they have so many good ideas and it's really refreshing for them to see adults have that creative energy also.\n\nIt just shows children that the creativity that they have and that they are using is so valuable and appreciated.\n\nIf you want to get more ideas to using props in your music classroom or therapy session, listen to episode 27 of theMusic For Kiddos Podcast. AND if you use any of these props or ideas, share them with us on Instagram or Facebook and tag us so we can share it with everyone!"
