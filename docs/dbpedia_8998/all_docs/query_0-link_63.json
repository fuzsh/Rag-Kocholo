INSEMINOID was directed by British filmmaker Norman J. Warren, known primarily for a series of late '70s-'80s horror films, including SATAN'S SLAVE, PREY, BLOODY NEW YEAR and the like and produced by Richard Gordon known for a variety of films but specializing in horror movies such as THE HAUNTED STRANGLER, FIEND WITHOUT A FACE, CORRIDORS OF BLOOD, and DEVIL DOLL. Warren shot the film during May and June 1980, with a Â£1 million budget, half of which was financed by Hong Kong's Shaw Brothers (their first investment in a British film).\n\nRecord Store Day titles are strictly limited and non-returnable."
