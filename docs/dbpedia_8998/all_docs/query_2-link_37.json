        "text": "Dario Argento's \"Tenebrae\" is pretty good. There is the typical Argento highly-stylized gore, but as someone who does not like gore I find it \"artsy\" rather than \"repulsive.\"\n\nIf you can dial it back a year to 1979, the original \"When a Stranger Calls\" is great. The critical consensus is that the first 20-30 minutes is great but then it loses its way... but I think the whole film is fascinating. In general, I think the 1970s was a far better decade than the 1980s for horror (the Wicker Man, Blood on Satan's Claw, Suspiria, Black Christmas, Halloween, etc).\n\nThe first 30 minutes of \"Children of the Corn\" is really good; I saw it when I was 12, and it is the most terrified I have ever been at a movie. The middle part is a bit muddled, and the ending is cringeworthy.\n\nSomeone mentioned 'Wolfen,' which is a movie I really like. Worth watching just for the impressive scenes of apocalyptic urban decay in pre-gentrification NYC.\n\nThat is one of the few films where the sequel is significantly better. I'm not sure what kind of 80's horror you like, comedic, serious, creature FX, slashers etc. However, I'll throw some out that I think are of the best of their sub-genre, minus the big franchises and more famous films:\n\nSLASHERS: Tourist Trap, Silent Scream, Hell Night, Happy Birthday to Me, Alone in the Dark, The Slayer, Curtains, The Initiation, Stagefright, Clownhouse, Popcorn\n\nZOMBIES: Zeder, Mutant, The Stuff, Lifeforce, Night of the Creeps, Demons 2, Dead Heat, The Resurrected\n\nCREATURES: Alligator, The Pit, Q: The Winged Serpent, The Deadly Spawn, CHUD, Razorback, The Gate, Blue Monkey, Monkey Shines\n\nSUPERNATURAL: The Visitor, Dolls, Paperhouse, Lady in White, Anguish, Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II, The First Power, Woman in Black\n\n...now that's a great list! bravo!\n\nThanks. I honestly just looked at my shelf, then added a few I wish I owned. I want to give extra kudos to The Deadly Spawn for supplying a fun movie with legendary creatures on a budget of $25,000. To put this in perspective Halloween and Evil Dead both cost around $350K. Also I want to mention Psycho 3 and Body Parts as underrated films with scene stealer Jeff Fahey. And a HTF 1988 film Cameron's Closet is pretty diverting too.\n\nI sort of skipped the crazy so cheesy it's a blast films. Of those I'm thinking of Don't Go in the Woods, Pieces, Scream for Help, Blood Diner, Chopping Mall, Blood Rage, The Class of 1999, Soultaker, Waxwork 1 & 2\n\nWhile currently watching the early CG 1993 Ghost in the Machine I realized that this film and a good 1988 film Pulse were truly precursors to the Final Destination idea.\n\nI have hundreds on DVD & BD...lots of \"B\" and obscure...\n\nNot in my neck of the woods. Over a decade ago I sold the DVD used for $100 and it looks like Region 1 still fetches that much. Crazy how great movies like Woman in Black and Paperhouse are hardly available in the US.\n\nAnother I thought of is The Cellar which I saw on the big screen and got to talk to the director Kevin Tenney afterwards. I loved how the father suspected and feared the monster existing. Bloody New Year is a very imaginative one. I also always liked the 1980 Alien clone Scared to Death.\n\nI find horror anthologies to be some of the most fun, even the cheaper ones like Grim Prairie Tales, Deadtime Stories and After Midnight. Also, there are a lot kids movies from the 80's that are horror at heart, like Something Wicked This Way Comes.\n\nI really like this one. I had no idea it existed until I bought a copy of the \"folk horror\" box set All the Haunts Be Ours. For an American movie (with future voice of Pinky, Rob Paulsen, in the cast), it really flew under the radar.\n\nAll the Haunts Be Ours gives you two cuts of the movie. Eyes of Fire is the theatrical cut. Crying Blue Sky is a 30-minute longer pre-release cut approved by the director (the distributor asked that the film be cut down). There are differences - the director's cut doesn't include the scenes of the French soldiers interrogating the kids.\n\nI really like this one, too. It was unfairly dismissed at the time as an Elm Street clone, but it isn't. There are a couple of surface similarities, but that's about it.\n\nYes, should have added that I look forward to viewing the disc when I get an all-region player. Dead Of Night and The Queen Of Spades were released in North America region BRs after their UK release and I was hoping this would happen with TWIB. Unfortunately not yet."
