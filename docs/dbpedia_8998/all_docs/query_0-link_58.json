        "text": "April 21, 2021\n\nChuck Cirino – John Scott – Alan Howarth – New Horror Soundtrack CDs from Dragon’s Domain Records Announced\n\nDragon’s Domain Records, to be distributed through buysoundtrax.com, presents three soundtracks from previously unreleased or rare horror films.\n\nGHOULIES IV, featuring music composed by Chuck Cirino for the 1994 horror comedy directed by Jim Wynorski continues the long-running collaboration between the filmmaker and the composer Chuck Cirino. The electronic score for GHOULIES IV employs an arsenal of scoring techniques Cirino initially explored on CHOPPING MALL. It’s chock-full of frenetic sixteenth-note synth licks, regurgitating melodies, bizarre synth soundscapes, punctuations of synth slap bass, and a litany of pulsating percussion.\n\nNorman J. Warren’s 1981 science fiction horror film INSEMINOID featuring music composed, arranged and performed by John Scott. The film tells of a crew of interplanetary archaeologists who are threatened when an alien creature impregnates one of their members, causing her to develop a psychosis and mutilate her colleagues one by one. As the film’s budget would not allow for an orchestra, Scott created his orchestra electronically, making made use of synthesized rock-and-roll elements mixed over a variegated abundance of synthetic substances.\n\nThe second volume of THE ALAN HOWARTH COLLECTION features music composed and performed by Alan Howarth (for several projects. This collection Alan Howarth kicks off with the score for 1993’s ARCADE, directed by Albert Pyun, which tells the story of an a virtual reality game that begins taking over the minds of teenagers. In addition the collection includes a block of odds and ends from other projects in Howarth’s filmography, including unused music meant for the trailer for THE BEASTMASTER; a piece of source music specially requested by James Horner to introduce Robert Vaughn’s character in BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS; music from the syndicated 1988-91 horror anthology TV series MONSTERS (Howarth composed the 3rd season episode “Far Below”); and providing last-minute additional suspense music for Sam Peckinpah’s Lalo Schifrin-scored THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND (1983)."
