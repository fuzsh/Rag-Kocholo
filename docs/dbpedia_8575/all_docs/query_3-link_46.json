We then used a set of heuristics to eliminate those that weren't talked about very much over the past month. This leaves us with a list of about 10-20,000 people. From there, we run those through our search volume tool, which is trusted by top institutions from the New York Times to IKEA then we simply sort by the people with the most searches.\n\nNote that when we calculate the most searched person of 2023, for example, we are calculating the person whose searches reached the highest peak during the timeframe any given month. Looking at it on a yearly basis though would have put Trump at the top of the list for each year, from 2016 through even today.\n\nTo access a CSV of the top 1,000 searched people, updated every week, please contact us here."
