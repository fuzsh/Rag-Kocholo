        "text": "Bill Nighy is an award-winning British character actor. He was born William Francis Nighy on December 12, 1949 in Caterham, Surrey, England, to Catherine Josephine (Whittaker), a psychiatric nurse from Glasgow, and Alfred Martin Nighy, who was English-born and managed a garage in Croydon.\n\nAt school, he gained 'O'-levels in English Language and English Literature and enjoyed reading, particularly Ernest Hemingway. On leaving school he wanted to become a journalist but didn't have the required qualifications. He eventually went on to work as a messenger boy for the Field magazine. He stayed in Paris for a while because he wanted to write \"the great novel\", but he only managed to write the title. When he ran out of money, the British consul shipped him home.\n\nNighy wound up training at Guildford School of Dance and Drama in London, and has since then worked consistently in film, television, and on stage.\n\nNighy is perhaps best-known to international audiences for his memorable performance as washed-up pop singer Billy Mack in Tatsächlich... Liebe (2003), which won him a BAFTA for best supporting actor. He has also made appearances in major franchises: he played vampire leader Viktor in Underworld (2003), Underworld: Evolution (2006) and Underworld - Aufstand der Lykaner (2009), did the performance capture and voice for Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean - Fluch der Karibik 2 (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean - Am Ende der Welt (2007), and made a brief appearance as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010).\n\nNighy's recent film credits include roles in I Capture the Castle (2003), Shaun of the Dead (2004), Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis (2005), Der ewige Gärtner (2005), Tagebuch eines Skandals (2006), Hot Fuzz - Zwei abgewichste Profis (2007), Operation Walküre - Das Stauffenberg-Attentat (2008) and Radio Rock Revolution (2009). He has also provided voice work for many animated movies in the past few years including Flutsch und weg (2006), Astro Boy - Der Film (2009), Rango (2011) and Arthur Weihnachtsmann (2011).\n\nWith supporting turns in Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011), Zorn der Titanen (2012) and Total Recall (2012), 2012 was a busy year for Nighy. There are no signs of slowing down either, as he next appeared in Jack and the Giants (2013), Alles eine Frage der Zeit (2013), and I, Frankenstein (2014).\n\nNighy has also had an active career on the small screen, beginning with Agony (1979), and his first widely-recognized role was in 1991 mini-series The Men's Room (1991). He has also made a habit of working on television with Harry Potter director David Yates: projects together include Mord auf Seite eins (2003), The Young Visiters (2003), G8 auf Wolke Sieben (2005) and Die Verschwörung - Verrat auf höchster Ebene (2011). Nighy won a Golden Globe for his performance in Gideon's Daughter (2005).\n\nNighy actually began his career on the stage, and has earned acclaim for his work in numerous plays including \"The Vertical Hour,\" \"Pravda\". \"A Map of the World\", Tom Stoppard's Arcadia in 1993, and David Hare's Skylight. He received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance in 2001 play \"Blue/Orange.\"\n\nBill's partner was actress Diana Quick (he asked her to marry him but she said: \"don't ask me again\"; he called her his wife because anything else would have been too difficult). They have a daughter, Mary Nighy, who is studying at university and contemplating an acting career. She has already begun to appear on TV dramas and radio programs.\n\nColin Farrell is one of Ireland's biggest stars in Hollywood and abroad. His film presence has been filled with memorable roles that range from an inwardly tortured hit man, to an adventurous explorer, a determined-but-failing writer, and the greatest military leader in history.\n\nFarrell was born on May 31, 1976 in Castleknock, Dublin, Ireland to Rita (Monaghan) and Eamon Farrell. His father and uncle were both professional athletes, and briefly it looked like Farrell would follow in their footsteps. Farrell auditioned for a part in the Irish boy band Boyzone, unsuccessfully. After dropping out of the Gaiety School of Acting, Farrell was cast in Ballykissangel (1996), a BBC television drama. \"Ballykissangel\" was not his first onscreen role. Farrell had previously been in War Zone (1999), directed by Tim Roth and had appeared in the independent film Drinking Crude (1997). Farrell was soon to move on to bigger things.\n\nExchanging his thick Dublin accent for a light Texas drawl, Farrell acted in the gritty Tigerland (2000), directed by Joel Schumacher. Starring Farrell among a number of other budding young actors, the film portrays a group of new recruits being trained for the war in Vietnam. Farrell played the arrogant soldier Boz, drafted into the army and completely spiteful of authority. The film was praised by critics but made little money at the box office. It was Farrell's first big role on film, and certainly not his last. Farrell followed up with American Outlaws (2001), where he played the notorious outlaw Jesse James with Scott Caan, son of legendary actor James Caan, in the role of Cole Younger. The film was a box-office flop and a critical failure. Immediately, Farrell returned to the war drama film that had made him famous. Co-starring in the war film Das Tribunal (2002) opposite Bruce Willis, Farrell played the young officer captured by the enemy. The film was another failure. Farrell struck gold when he was cast in the Steven Spielberg film Minority Report (2002) that same year. Set in a futuristic time period, Farrell played the character Danny Witwer, a young member of the Justice Department who is sent after Tom Cruise's character. The film was a smash hit, and praised by critics.\n\nFarrell continued this success when he reunited with Joel Schumacher on the successful thriller Nicht auflegen! (2002). Farrell played the role of the victim who is harassed by an unseen killer (Kiefer Sutherland) and is made to reveal his sins to the public. 2003 was a big year for Farrell. He starred in the crime thriller Der Einsatz (2003) as a young CIA man mentored by an older CIA veteran (Al Pacino). Pacino later stated that Farrell was the best actor of his generation. Farrell certainly continued to be busy that year with Daredevil (2003), which actually allowed him to keep his thick Irish accent. The film was another success for Farrell, as was the crime film S.W.A.T. - Die Spezialeinheit (2003) where Farrell starred opposite Samuel L. Jackson and LL Cool J. Farrell also acted in the Irish black comedy film Intermission (2003) and appeared another Irish film Die Journalistin (2003) which reunited him with Joel Schumacher once again. The following year, Farrell acted in what is his most infamous film role yet: the title role in the mighty Oliver Stone film epic Alexander (2004), which is a character study of Alexander the Great as he travels across new worlds and conquers all the known world before him. Farrell donned a blond wig and retained his Irish accent, and gave a fine performance as Alexander. However, both he and the film were criticized. Despite being one of the highest grossing films internationally and doing a good job at the DVD sales, Farrell did not come out of the experience without a few hurts. Farrell attempted to rebound with his historical film The New World (2005). Reuniting with \"Alexander\" star Christopher Plummer, and also acting with Christian Bale, Farrell played the brave explorer John Smith, who would make first contacts with the Native peoples. The film did not do well at the box office, though critics praised the film's stunning appearance and cinematography.\n\nFarrell returned to act in Michael Mann's film Miami Vice (2006) alongside Jamie Foxx. The film was a film adaptation of the famous television series, and did reasonably well at the box office. Farrell also acted in In den Staub geschrieben (2006) with Salma Hayek and Donald Sutherland, though the film did not receive much distribution. The next year, Farrell acted alongside Ewan McGregor in the Woody Allen film Cassandras Traum (2007) which received mixed reviews from critics. Farrell followed up with the hilarious black comedy Brügge sehen... und sterben? (2008). Written and directed by Irish theatre director Martin McDonagh, the film stars Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two Irish hit men whose latest assignment went wrong, leaving them to hide out in Bruges, Belgium. The film has been one of Farrell's most praised work, and he was nominated for a Golden Globe. As well as Brügge sehen... und sterben? (2008), Farrell acted alongside Edward Norton in the crime film Das Gesetz der Ehre (2008) which was not as successful as the former film. As well as working with charity, and speaking at the Special Olympics World Games in 2007, he has donated his salary for Terry Gilliam's Das Kabinett des Doktor Parnassus (2009) to Heath Ledger's little daughter (who was left nothing in a will that had not been updated in time). Ledger had originally been cast in the film and was replaced by Farrell, Johnny Depp and Jude Law. The film was a critical and financial success, and Farrell also played a small role in Crazy Heart (2009) which had the Dubliner playing a country singer. Farrell even sang a few songs for the film's soundtrack. As well as those small roles, Farrell took the lead role in the war film Triage (2009). Farrell incredibly lost forty-four pounds to play the role of a war photographer who must come to terms with what he has experienced in Kurdistan. While the film was finely made, with excellent performances from all involved, the film has received almost no distribution.\n\nFarrell's other leading role that year was in Neil Jordan's Irish film Ondine - Das Mädchen aus dem Meer (2009). In recent years, he co-starred in the comedy horror film Fright Night (2011), the science fiction action film Total Recall (2012), both remakes, and McDonagh's second feature, and the black comedy crime film 7 Psychos (2012). Since the mid-2000s, Farrell has cleaned up his act, and far from being a Hollywood hell raiser and party animal, he has shown himself to be a respectable and very talented actor.\n\nHe also starred in The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), both directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. For The Lobster he was nominated for a Golden Globe.\n\nBrendan Gleeson was born in Dublin, Ireland, to Pat and Frank Gleeson. From a very young age, he loved to learn, especially reading classical text in and outside the classroom. He took great attention to Irish play writers such as Samuel Beckett, which eventually led to him performing in his high school play production of \"Waiting for Godot\", and paying great attention to detail in his high school drama classes. Upon finishing 12th grade, he spent a couple of years with the Dublin Shakespeare Festival, and under the advice of a director there, headed across to London and auditioned for drama schools. Soon to follow, he was invited to audition for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford upon Avon, and spent a couple of seasons back in England on the stage. He then, at the age of thirty five, decided to audition for films in the UK and began to build a very respectable resume playing many different diverse characters.\n\nHe made his debut as a quarryman in Das Feld (1990). He had several small roles in major Hollywood movies based in Ireland, such as In einem fernen Land (1992) and Das weiße Zauberpferd (1992). Memorably played historical Irish figure \"Michael Collins\" in The Treaty (1991). Made his breakthrough in Scottish themed Braveheart (1995), which was largely filmed in Ireland, opposite Mel Gibson. He played Gibson's right-hand man \"Hamish\". Since then, he has appeared in numerous major films such as Mission: Impossible II (2000), Lake Placid (1999), Turbulence (1997). He has made a name for himself taking the titular role in Der Meisterdieb von Dublin (1998), based on the life of Irish criminal \"Martin Cahill\", for which he won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award. He appears in director John Boorman's film Der Schneider von Panama (2001) as well as Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) and Steven Spielberg's A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001).\n\nEver since, he has continued to bring his huge stage presence to the screen, always delivering the character in full development to his audience. He is married to his lovely wife, Mary, since 1982. They have four sons."
