For Roy Jones Jr., that came during the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, Korea, when he was robbed of winning a gold medal by corrupt judges. So what did he do? He became a marquee idol and went on to become one of boxing’s most illustrious champions. Through an immense escalation of stakes with every fight, “Captain Hook” ruled four different weight classes. Headlined massive cards. Won the hearts of millions.\n\nGreatness really is born of adversity, and we’ll never forget.\n\nOfficially licensed by Roy Jones Jr.\n\nDETAILS\n\nPrinted in the USA\n\nThis garment was printed with Premium Brittle Base Ink.
