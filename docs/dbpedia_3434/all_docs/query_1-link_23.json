The news of his death brings Julia back to her first mee­ting with Xabier and another young Basque priest, Josu, in Bilbao in 1968 during the height of the Franco dictatorship. As the night of the election proceeds, Julia finds herself torn between two conti­nents and fifty years of history. She remembers the fate that befell the two priests and their tragic life paths, and at the same time tries to reconcile the dis­turbing changes that are taking place in her own country.\n\nWhat can we do when the past repeats itself? Julia finds herself wondering.

However, the process of its creation began in 1495, immediately after the Burgos merchants obtained the first Crown of Castile in 1494 from Catholic monarchs. The merchants then used this kingdom to create their own consulate. The Consulate of Bilbao is a study framed between the peninsular consular histories, from the appearance of the first consulates in the Crown of Aragon during the late Middle Ages until the Bourbon reforms of the 18th century. This book examines the actions taken between 1495 and 1511 by the merchants, the authorities of the Signory of Bizkaia, the authorities of the Provinces of Gipuzkoa and Araba, and the Monarchy to create the Consulate of Bilbao. It analyzes the ius proprium of the institution between 1511 and 1737. This entails the study of the decrees and ordinances, both general and particular, issued by the institution during the course of its history. Of particular importance were the successful ordinances of 1737 that, due to their content and dissemination, became a commercial code rather than simple corporate ordinances.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThe Bilbao Consulate and Its Ordinances on Shopify\n\nThe Bilbao Consulate and Its Ordinances on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nforthcoming\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-949805-13-0\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-949805-44-4\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n224\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nJoseba Atxotegi\n\nYear\n\n2020\n\nSeries\n\nConference Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n19\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n20\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n25\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThis book arises with a double purpose. On the one hand, to make known to scholars and to all those interested in Basque culture and society, the reality of Basque migrations from a psychological perspective. But, on the other hand, it also arises as an attempt by the authors of the book, Basque researchers, professionals, and academics, to better understand the scope of the enormous importance that migrations have had in the cultural and social structuring of the Basque Country. The book fundamentally collects the presentations made at a conference on this topic that was held on May 10, 2019 in the Aula Magna of the Faculty of Psychology of the University of the Basque Country. The conference was organized jointly with the Center for Basque Studies of the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\nReviews\n\n“What is remarkable in this book edited by Professor Joseba Atxotegi is clearly and distinctly the look at the concept of migration and everything derived from it concerning the impact on the individual. The innovative approach of Ulysses Syndrome has already made it possible to determine an extremely relevant distinction regarding the non-systematization of the psychopathological process and its exaggerated classification in the psychiatric field. Indeed, this psycho-anthropological perspective allows us to accurately assess the difficulties encountered by a person in a situation of migration or exile without stigmatizing him or her by referring to systematically to a process of mental disorder.”— Rachid Bennegadi, President of the World Association of Social Psychiatry and Professor of the Paris V University , “This book presents a fascinating and very timely account of the many consequences of the process of emigrating, particularly as it relates to the high levels of stress experienced by the emigrants. The chapters address several historic and current examples of emigrants, including children and women, as well as the various impacts of migratory policies, and the challenges of acculturation and psychological adjustment. The stress that emigrants experience is characterized as the ‘Ulysses Syndrome’—regarding the Greek hero who su ered countless adversities in lands far from his loved ones.”— Fabricio E.Balcazar, Department of Disability and Human Development, University of Illinois at Chicago.

Echeverria shows how noka became marginalized, and illustrates the vibrant sociolinguistic life noka has led over 500 hundred years of Basque history. By uncovering this rich legacy for the rst time in one monograph, and contributing original lyrics using noka of her own, Echeverria hopes to increase awareness of noka and the surprising stories it tells— and perhaps revitalize noka use. In addition to specialists in Basque studies and endangered languages, this book’s broad scope and unique methodological approach should interest readers in gender studies, folklore, folksong, linguistics, and anthropology.\n\nReviews\n\n\"Equipped with a native knowledge of Basque and a keen sense of curiosity concerning how gender issues and questions of identity are encoded in language, the author takes the reader on a fascinating journey.

It documents the history of Basques in Australia from the late eighteenth century until the present. Based upon archival and field research, the book primarily focuses on the formal recruitment of Basques as manual sugar canecutters in the late 1950s and the early 1960s in tropical Queensland’s Far North. From 1970, the mechanization of harvesting forced canecutters to develop new life strategies.

Forty-four poets took part in the 2009 literary tournament, and eight of them made it to the final. After a long day of literary competition, Maialen Lujanbio won and received the award: a big black txapela or Basque beret. That day the Basques achieved a triple triumph. First, thousands of people had gathered for an entire day to follow a literary contest, and many more had attended the event via the web all over the world. Second, all these people had followed this event entirely in Basque, a language that had been prohibited for decades during the harsh years of the Francoist dictatorship. And third, Lujanbio had become the first woman to win the championship in the history of the Basques. After being crowned with the txapela, Lujanbio stepped up to the microphone and sung a bertso or improvised poem referring to the struggle of the Basques for their language and the struggle of Basque women for their rights. It was a unique moment in the history of an ancient nation that counts its past in tens of millennia: I remember the laundry that grandmothers, of earlier times carried on the cushion [on their heads], I remember the grandmother of old times, and today’s mothers and daughters...\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nFemale Improvisational Poets on Shopify\n\nFemale Improvisational Poets on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-01-7\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n230\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nedited by Gemma Martínez and Xabier Irujo\n\nYear\n\n2018\n\nSeries\n\nClassics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n14\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n15\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nIn February 2018 Basque society celebrated the 140th anniversary of the Economic Agreement. This model of governing financial and fiscal relations with the Spanish state, based on negotiation and agreement, is one of the most and unique instruments of self-government in the Basque Country and certainly one of the most outstanding signs of Basque identity. Since February 28,1878, the Economic Agreement has overcome major challenges such as wars, political and economic crises, and dictatorial governments. The twenty-first century brings particular challenges not only at the state level—the emergence of strong centralism and constitutional crises—but also at the international level with globalization and the uniformization of the digital economy and markets. The central thread of this book is the analysis of the Basque Economic Agreement as a financial self-government tool from the perspective of some of the federal reference models in the world: the United States, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada. The Economic Agreement has contributed to the creation of a unique system in which the preservation of traditions becomes intermingled with investing in innovation, research, and development, creating synergies that have proved to be extremely effective and successful in reaching adequate levels of autonomy for sub-central governments, efficiency, income distribution, equity, accountability, and other key factors involved in nation-state building processes in federal systems: A model that can thus be considered to be a model of reference in relation to a likely devolution of powers to local government in the twenty-first century in order to tackle the current social and economic realities.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nInternational Perspectives on Fiscal Federalism: The Basque Tax System on Shopify\n\nInternational Perspectives on Fiscal Federalism: The Basque Tax System on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-82-4\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n5.5\"x8.5\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n132\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nJoan Errea\n\nYear\n\n2017\n\nSeries\n\nDiaspora and Migration Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n12\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n15\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nA Man Called Aita is Joan Errea’s loving, moving, heartfelt, and honest tribute to her father, Arnaud Paris—aita is the Basque word for “father.” But it is so much more than that: it is the continued story of her mother, also told in Joan’s book My Mama Marie; it is the story of her brothers Arnaud, Mike, Johnny, and Pete; of her adored Uncle Otto; of ranch hands; and of dogs and goats and sheep and horses and cattle. Written in beguilingly simple rhymed verse, the story is not simple, nor is it entirely carefree—there are deaths, injuries, losses great and small, disease, trials and tribulations. There is humor, there is love, there are grand personalities written across the western landscape. At its heart is a tremendous loss that has been felt by all who have lost a beloved parent. Beyond its deeply personal story, this book is also a testimony to the ranching way of life in the Western United States and the place of Basques within it. Written in the style of the Basque bertsolari, and taking as inspiration her father, who was also a troubador of this oral tradition, the small book you hold in your hands is a true gem of the West.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nA Man Called Aita on Shopify\n\nA Man Called Aita on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-78-7\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n382\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nAsun Garikano\n\nYear\n\n2017\n\nSeries\n\nDiaspora and Migration Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n5\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n31.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThe experience of Basque immigrants to the United States has come in many shapes and forms, and Asun Garikano takes nearly all of them into account in this comprehensive look at the lives of the ordinary men and women who made the brave journey to the US West in search of a better life. Although their experiences were very diverse, one commonality was the aid they received from fellow Basques. They were often met at the dock in New York City with the familiar sound of their language and helped to find a place on the transcontinental train with their names and destinations pinned to their coats. They worked at ranches, farms and businesses often owned by people from their same hometowns. They found conversation, fellowship, and cheer at boardinghouses where they shared the games, drinks, language, and food of their homeland. In Far Western Basque Country these and many other stories are told about the individual immigrants that made up the Basque diaspora in the United States. Some stayed, some returned, some lost money, some became rich and powerful. They adopted their new homeland and its ways. They fought in its wars, celebrated its highs and suffered its lows, but in the face of it, they all remained Basque.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nFar Western Basque Country on Shopify\n\nFar Western Basque Country on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-949805-74-9\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n294\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nedited by Joseba Agirreazkuenaga and Xabier Irujo\n\nYear\n\n2017\n\nSeries\n\nConference Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n11\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n35\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThe Basque Fiscal System Contrasted to Nevada and Catalonia seeks to analyze Basque fiscal systems in the context of the 2008 financial crisis. It also aimed to develop a comparative vision with the state of Nevada and Catalonia. It treats the politics of finance in multi-level public institutions during the economic crisis; long-term fiscal policies for dealing with economic downturns during the past twenty years; the development of treasuries in federal states, in non-federal states and in complex unions (Europe); taxation and citizenship in a globalized world; long-term trends for dealing with the crisis and strategies for the future in European and North American contexts (the Basque Country, Catalonia, Spain, Ireland, and Nevada). Most of the book’s contributions by distinguished scholars and public officials relate to the Basque Country, providing an analysis of fiscal policies or the evolution of public finances. A contribution on taxation and gambling is also offered. This book serves as a new contribution to studies on fiscal federalism in Europe and America. We hope that these reflections serve as a turning point to promote debate and for the formulation of future research. Fiscal analysis is now an important research line at the William A. Douglass Center for Basque studies, promoted and in cooperation with the regional government of Bizkaia, with the end of promoting research in a comparative perspective.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThe Basque Fiscal System Contrasted to Nevada and Catalonia in the Time of Major Crises on Shopify\n\nThe Basque Fiscal System Contrasted to Nevada and Catalonia in the Time of Major Crises on Amazon\n\nThe Basque Fiscal System Contrasted to Nevada and Catalonia in the Time of Major Crises on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-89-3\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-935709-88-6\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n338\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nWentworth Webster\n\nYear\n\n2017\n\nSeries\n\nClassics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n13\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n20\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n35\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nIn A Book of the Basques, Rodney Gallop notes that, “one Englishman, and one alone, has lived long enough among the Basques to write with authority upon their character, customs and language: the Reverend Wentworth Webster.” Based on information that Webster collected from servants and other domestics in the closed world of the nineteenth-century Basque etxe (house, but with a meaning much more powerful and comprehensive than we expect from the English word), especially from Stephana Hirigaray, who he employed as a maid in the Basque Country. As a French Basque woman with rural roots, Stephana Hirigaray had more than stories to give to her employer. She had an insider’s knowledge of the culture in which those stories were embedded. Hirigaray belonged to a Basque moral community in which Basque master/servant relationships were notably equal. In rural Basque culture, servants ate at the same table as their employers, who considered them as members of the family. Thus, the master/servant relationship between Webster and Hirigaray is likely to have been influenced by that Basque emphasis on equality. First published in 1877, Basque Legends consists of more than forty-six stories (and variations thereof) that feature supernatural figures such as the Tartaro or Cyclops, the Seven-Headed Serpent, and Basque fairies known as lamiñak. In addition, Webster collected stories about witches and sorcery, animal tales (such as “Acheria, the Fox”), fairy tales, and religious tales. It also contains an original essay on the Basque language by Julien Vinson, an in-depth collection of Basque poetry, and a modern introduction by Sandra Ott.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBasque Legends: Collected, Chiefly, in Labourd on Shopify\n\nBasque Legends: Collected, Chiefly, in Labourd on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-80-0\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n282\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nDavid Lyon\n\nYear\n\n2017\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Politics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n13\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n32\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nIncarceration of political enemies was a principal strategy for repression by the Francoist regime during the Civil War and Franco’s early rule and the Puerto de Santa María, in Andalusia, was a major prison. Bitter Justice tells the story of some of these prisoners, focusing on the Basque dimension and based on newly cataloged prison files, interviews with family members of prisoners, research in Basque archives. The book tells the story of these prisoners: their charges, sentences, and conditions of release, which were generally more stringent for Basque prisoners than for others. And El Puerto contained more Basque prisoners than all the other Andalusian prisons put together. In addition, Bitter Justice considers important interrelated issues: El Puerto‘s background including conditions and treatment of its inmates; Basque prisoners’ conditions; a presentation of collective memories of Basque relatives of the prisoners, relating to their life before, during, and, perhaps as important, the way they were treated after their return to their communities; and case studies of “offenders”; and, an analysis of any inconsistencies of sentences, charges, and release conditions that affected Basque and Cádiz prisoners. The research shows that irregularities and discrimination against those convicted from the Basque Country were normal. This history, the first of its kind, sheds a new light on the terrible early repression of the Franco regime and its effect on many lives.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBitter Justice on Shopify\n\nBitter Justice on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-877802-84-8\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n5.5\"x8.5\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n238\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nSydney Avey\n\nYear\n\n2017\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Originals\n\nSeries No.\n\n17\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n16\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nIn 1953, a war widow’s difficult mother dies before revealing the identity of her daughter’s father and his cultural heritage. As Dee sorts through what little her mother left, she unearths puzzling clues that raise more questions: Why did Leora send money every month to the Basque Relief Agency? Why is her own daughter so secretive about her soon-to-be published book? And what does an Anglican priest know that he isn’t telling? All of this head-spinning mystery breaks a long, dry period in Dee’s life and leads her to embark on an odyssey. She might just as well lose her job and see where the counsel of her new spiritual advisor and the attentions of an enigmatic ex-coworker lead her. The Sheep Walker’s Daughter pairs a colorful Basque immigrant history of loss, survival, and tough choices with one woman’s search for identity and fulfillment. Dee’s journey will take her through the Northern and Central California valleys of the 1950s and reach across the world to the Basque Country. Along the way, she will discover who she is and why family history matters.\n\nReviews\n\n“Avey has an artist’s gift for using strong visual language, and a counselor’s gift for describing the conditions of her characters’ hearts.” “Explores complex relationships between richly developed characters.

This led to a series of events that culminated in their October massacre at hands of the islanders. The Basque mariners’ bodies, dismembered, would not be buried. However, not all Icelanders saw that massacre with good eyes. One of them, Jón Guðmundsson, better known as Jón lærði (1574–1658) or “the wise man”, wrote an essay on those events in defense of the victims titled “Sönn frásaga” (The true story). Four hundred years later, on April 20, 2015, an international conference investigated various aspects of this tragic episode of the history of Iceland and the Basque Country. The academic meeting took place at the National Library of Iceland with the participation of experts from all over the world. The program, commemorating the fourth centenary of the massacre of Basque whalers in Iceland, was sponsored by the Government of Gipuzkoa and the Government of Iceland and organized by the Etxepare Institute, the Basque-Finnish Association, the Center for Basque Studies of the University of Nevada, Reno and the Barandiaran Chair of the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nJon Gudmundsson Laedi's true Account And The Massacre of Basque Whalers In Iceland in 1615 on Shopify\n\nJon Gudmundsson Laedi's true Account And The Massacre of Basque Whalers In Iceland in 1615 on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-877802-36-2\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n5\"x8\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n146\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nPello Salaburu\n\nYear\n\n2015\n\nSeries\n\nOccasional Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n26\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n15\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nAll written languages were at some point standardized. In other words, they were subject to a process of searching for and applying coherent standards to their written form so as to be able to organize them for description in grammars and dictionaries and thereby provide a model for use in educational systems, the media, the arts and sciences, government, business, and so on. Pello Salaburu’s work is a personal overview of how the Basque language came to standardized—a process involving the unification of a small but dialectically diverse language—and embraced by Basque society in a relatively short period of time compared to many other standardization processes. What makes this story all the more remarkable is the fact that, unlike in most other cases, the Basque Country is not an independent state and is in fact divided along different political and administrative lines. Salaburu describes how the decision to standardize Basque came about, the key figures involved in the process, and the main linguistic issues debated, as well as the subsequent efforts to implement these decisions. This is a fascinating account of how, in the face of a certain degree of adversity, a modern standard written form of Basque was established and how it is thriving today.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nWriting Words: The Unique Case of the Standardization of Basque on Shopify\n\nWriting Words: The Unique Case of the Standardization of Basque on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-56-5\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n314\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nedited by Zoe Bray\n\nYear\n\n2015\n\nSeries\n\nConference Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n10\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n24\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThis book brings together experts from different fields of study, including sociology, anthropology, art history and art criticism to share their research and direct experience on the topic of art and politics. How art and politics relate with each other can be studied from numerous perspectives and standpoints. The book is structured according to three main themes: Part 1, on Valuing Art, broadly concerns the question of who, how and what value is given to art, and how this may change over time and circumstance, depending on the social and political situation and motivation of different interest groups. Part 2, on Artistic Political Engagement, reflects on another dimension of art and politics, that of how artists may be intentionally engaged with politics, either via their social and political status and/or through the kind of art they produce and how they frame it in terms of meaning. Part 3, on Exhibitions and Curating, focuses on yet another aspect of the relationship between art and politics: what gets exhibited, why, how, and with what political significance or consequence. A main focus is on the politics of art in the Basque Country, complemented by case studies and reflections from other parts of the world, both in the past and today. This book is unique by gathering a rich variety of different viewpoints and experiences, with artists, curators, art historians, sociologists and anthropologists talking to each other with sometimes quite different epistemological bases and methodological approaches.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBeyond Guernica and the Guggenheim: Art and Politics from a Comparative Perspective on Shopify\n\nBeyond Guernica and the Guggenheim: Art and Politics from a Comparative Perspective on Amazon\n\nBeyond Guernica and the Guggenheim: Art and Politics from a Comparative Perspective on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-04-6\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n336\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nNagore Calvo Mendizabal\n\nYear\n\n2015\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Politics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n10\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n25\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThe book presents a novel perspective in which the Spanish state formation and Basque nationalism develop in complex ways of antagonism and complementarity. The book questions the very notion of the Basque Country and its implications in the new global context. It examines critically some of the key institutions, territories, social practices and collective representations that historically have constituted the Basque Country. One of the most contentious current projects in the articulation of the Basque territory, conflating opposing political agendas and economic outlooks, is the High Speed Train. The author studies this project in depth to come up with valid lessons regarding the need for infrastructural development and communication between the Basque region, Spain and the European Union. The value of the work rests in her simultaneously viewing the need for inter-dependencies as well as the resulting social conflicts and strategic contradictions emerging from various constituencies. Beyond her Basque region, this work has relevant implications for a better articulation of the Spanish state in the new European context. Her analysis deals with the core issues of the current debates on city renewal, the globalization of the economy and culture, and the redefinition of the basic political and financial institutions. Her work has a bearing on new urbanism, cultural studies, Spanish society, and European infrastructures.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBuilding the Basque City: The Political Economy of Nation-Building on Shopify\n\nBuilding the Basque City: The Political Economy of Nation-Building on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-63-3\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n328\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nJuan Jose Ibarretxe\n\nYear\n\n2015\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Politics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n9\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n20\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nFirst of all I have to say this work has been carried out with the intention of settling a moral debt with the Basque People, from whom I have received so much affection and recognition over the last few years after being Lehendakari or President of the Basques from 1999 to 2009. My gratitude to Basque society is infinite. They know many things were done well and some things were done not so well, however, they were always done with awareness of our identity and with the intention of solving problems and making progress. This is how Basque Society has always considered our work, wisely, intelligently, and with deliberation. It is to Basque society itself, before the University or myself, to whom I owe this contribution. This work aims to provide a serious and serene analysis of the legal-political and socio-economic aspects, which, in the efforts to achieve sustainable human development, have been evident in Basque society from the recovery of self-government via the Statute of Gernika in the 1980’s up to today, and specifically in the period between 1998 and 2008, in three relevant but traditionally unrelated fields: economics, social balance and peacemaking. The focus of this research lies in identifying the key factors that made it possible for the Basque Country to become one of the leading nations in the Human Development Index (2007): resilience in the face of an ongoing political conflict dating back to the 19th century exacerbated by the violence of ETA since the middle of the 20th century. These factors and the lessons learned could be particularly relevant to other countries facing serious challenges and aiming to achieve sustainable human development, within the context of their own culture.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThe Basque Experience: Constructing Sustainable Human Development on Shopify\n\nThe Basque Experience: Constructing Sustainable Human Development on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-58-5\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n8\"x10\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n352\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nJoseba Zulaika\n\nYear\n\n2014\n\nSeries\n\nOccasional Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n24\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n25\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThat Old Bilbao Moon is a memoir, an ethnography of desire, an essay tracking a generation's consciousness, a manifesto for a new city and a new subject after the shipwreck.

They are rather figures under the threat of disintegration who require self-transformation for their survival. Every conversation and event here narrated is ethnographically factual, yet the book is essentially about the fundamental fantasies and subjective conversions of a generation surrendered to \"the passion for the real.\" This Bilbao generation of the sixties -- branded inaugurally by the trauma of ETA, socialism, atheism, Aresti's Maldan behere (Downfall), the survival of Euskara, the art of Oteiza and Chillida, feminism -- found in Frank Gerhy's \"shipwreck\" masterpiece its ultimate emblem and the promise of a new city. It is the architecture of labyrinth, a building of cuts and torsions, \"the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe\" (Muschamp), turned into the new face of \"that old Bilbao moon\" that Brecht sang as \"the most beautiful in the world.\" Because even after the ruins and the defeat the mandate persisted: you must change your life, you must transform your city.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThat Old Bilbao Moon: The Passion and Resurrection of a City on Shopify\n\nThat Old Bilbao Moon: The Passion and Resurrection of a City on Amazon\n\nThat Old Bilbao Moon: The Passion and Resurrection of a City on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-55-8\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n394\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nJavier Echeverria\n\nYear\n\n2014\n\nSeries\n\nDouglass Scholar Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n3\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n25\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nIn Innovation and Values, Javier Echeverría seeks both to understand why innovation policies in the European Union (EU) have not been wholly successful in the aim of transforming the EU into a global innovation leader and to offer a new way of critically thinking about innovation based on his own scholarly background in philosophy. In order to do so, he examines the broader history of innovation as well as focusing more particularly on innovation studies and policies in a variety of countries, including Australia, Canada, the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In general terms, he calls into question the linear model, according to which companies undertake innovation as a result of their own R&D knowledge and that transferred to them by universities and research centers. Specifically, Echeverria first discusses the origins and development of innovation studies, which emerged at the same time as technoscience during the final decades of the twentieth century. He then goes on to argue that the dominant paradigm in innovation studies, the OECD’s Oslo Manual (1992, 1997, and 2005), has also entered into a period of crisis. That crisis is demonstrated through multiple anomalies in the paradigm and above all by the emergence of an alternative paradigm, that of social innovation. He completes his survey by examining the so-called European Paradox, namely, why the quality of scientific research in the European Union has not been translated successfully when it comes to innovation. Echeverria concludes the work by offering a new template for innovation studies: a philosophy of innovation. The general aim of the work, as well as contributing data and references about the development of innovation policies and studies in Europe, is to point toward a new line of historical and philosophical research that takes into account the history and philosophy of science and technology, but which underscores the profound specificities of the concept of innovation.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nInnovation and Values: European Perspectives on Shopify\n\nInnovation and Values: European Perspectives on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-877802-35-5\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-877802-34-8\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n256\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nAntonio Tovar\n\nYear\n\n2014\n\nSeries\n\nClassics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n10\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n19.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThis small book on ideas about the nature and origin of the Basque language up to the early twentieth century is a highly erudite essay, even if the motivation for its composition was ultimately political. Its erudition is guaranteed by the professional credentials of its author, Antonio Tovar, one of twentieth-century Spain’s most polymathic intellectuals and men of letters, at the same time that its reason for being was the fruit of his passionate political commitment, which originated in his early years and, modulated over the course of his life by criticism and experience, led him to take an interest in all aspects of public life, especially those related to culture. At the crucial moment of the book’s composition, near the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, there was a need for actors with a sincere desire to understand the ideas and aspirations of the opposing sides, broad-minded and generous openness when it came to revising their own decades-old views, and perceptive intelligence for building connections with the proponents of other ideologies on the basis of shared humanist values. Tovar was one of these men.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nMythology and Ideology of the Basque Language on Shopify\n\nMythology and Ideology of the Basque Language on Amazon\n\nMythology and Ideology of the Basque Language on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-48-0\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n222\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nC.F.

The son of Swedish immigrants born in 1815, this “Englishman by naturalization” spent his life wandering from one country and cause to another, often taking part in those most cruel of conflicts—civil wars. This book traces the first of these experiences he had: his involvement in the First Carlist War (1833–39) between the spring of 1834 and summer of 1835. Henningsen describes his experiences fighting with the Carlist side in the course of just over a year at the outset of the conflict. But the book is more than just an account of a military campaign. Among other things, it is a reflection on the nature of war itself, an eyewitness study of military leadership in the figure of the charismatic Carlist leader Tomás Zumalacarregui, and an observation of the Basque Country—its landscape, people, and customs—in the early decades of the nineteenth century.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nShopify link\n\nn/a\n\nThe Most Striking Events of a Twelvemonth's Campaign with Zumalacarregui, Vol.1 on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-46-6\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n298\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nJoseba Agirreazkuenaga\n\nYear\n\n2014\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Politics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n7\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n24.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThe \"Concierto Ecónomico\" or Economic Agreement regulates the fiscal ties between the Spanish state and the Basque provinces. Responding within the general framework of the 2010 financial crisis, the Documentation Centre for the Economic Agreement and the Foral Treasuries, a research group within the University of the Basque Country, presents an overall reflection on the system of the Economic Agreement, the management and overall status of the Basque provinvial treasuries. The contributions brought together in this volume try to answer questions raised in academic and nonacademic circles including: the origins and history of the economic agreement, public finances and public opinion, and the legal underpinning of the agreement. The Economic Agreement, furthermore, is a basic element in the self-government of the Basque Country and this book is an essential tool for understanding it and its broader relation to Basque society. But the Economic Agreement is not solely a matter for the Basque Country or even to Spain. It is also being examined in the European courts and in the studies of comparative fiscal federalism. This book fills a gap in the literature of the Basque Economic Agreement and on fiscal culture and its practice, fiscal federalism, and complex political unions such as the European Union.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBasque Fiscal Systems: History, Current Status, and Future Perspectives on Shopify\n\nBasque Fiscal Systems: History, Current Status, and Future Perspectives on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-59-6\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n5.5\"x8.5\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n330\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nJavi Cillero\n\nYear\n\n2014\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Literature Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n10\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n20\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThe caretaker of a collection of exotic animals embarks on a dangerous relationship with a mobster's girlfriend; the tragedy of Oediupus is retold as a Western with a happy ending; revenge is wreaked on a Bilbao art dealer for his past transgressions. In these two short story collections--\"Hollywood and I\" and \"Mad City,\" brought together here and published in English fro the first time, Javi Cillero creates an astonishing variety of different worlds: Basque cities and a city of the West; the Nevada desert; jetliners, trains, cars, ferries; classic cinema and Greek myths and legends; and much much more. All are written into existence with a distinctive voice that blends noir fiction and dark humor. These stories generally tell the stories of outsiders, and it is no coincidence that thus the city of Reno, Nevada, also forms a central heart of many stories: like them, it is a place of missed connections, of sad and broken histories, and yet has the capacity for the human spirit to persevere against the odds. The characters here are just as varied as the stories themselves: witnesses and students, cowboys and art dealers, outsider and insiders and blends of the two. The stories almost defy summary in the incredible flowering of their imaginary worlds, just as desert flowers surprise with their splash of color in the otherwise gray sagebrush steppe.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nHollywood and I and Mad City on Shopify\n\nHollywood and I and Mad City on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-42-8\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n203\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nKoldo Zuazo\n\nYear\n\n2013\n\nSeries\n\nOccasional Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n21b\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n24.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThe topic of dialectal variation in Basque, a language isolate and the last remaining descendant of the pre-Indo-European languages of Western Europe, has long been a contentious issue in both academic and wider social circles.

Kefalos. Purchased in the United States and registered in Panama to a fictitious company, the ship had a daring plan: carry arms collected in Mexico to Israel. In June, the Kefalos sailed from New York to Tampico under false pretenses. Arms, both bought from the Mexican government and smuggled in from the United States, were loaded and the ship departed from Tampico in August. Once at sea, it quickly changed its name and appearance to sneak past Gibraltar and U.N. Observers in Tel Aviv. The secret mission was carried out through vital cooperation between two apparently odd bedfellows: Jews (Israeli, European, U.S., and Mexican) and a crew of mainly Spanish/Basque exiles from Franco’s dictatorship. Afterdelivering the arms, Israeli authorities decided to repurpose the Kefalos to rescue refugee Jews from the Balkans. After a layover in Naples, two voyages were made from Bakar (modern-day Croatia) to Haifa in late 1948 with over 7,700 refugees. This is the improbable saga of the “Rust Bucket”—as it was known endearingly by those who sailed on it. Through moving narration and careful attention to detail, this history illustrates an important crucible of two seemingly disparate diasporas.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThe Odyssey of the Ship with Three Names on Shopify\n\nThe Odyssey of the Ship with Three Names on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-47-3\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n294\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nXabier Irujo and Viola Miglio\n\nYear\n\n2013\n\nSeries\n\nConference Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n9\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n24.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThere are around 6,000 living languages in the world, but as of 2012, less than 4 percent of them can claim official status in one of more of the 196 existing states. This lack of official status, along with other cultural, political, and legal factors, is contributing to a worldwide loss of linguistic diversity and cultural richness. The essays in this book explore the many facets of language rights and language protection from a variety of theoretical, legal, and academic perspectives. Important lessons are taken from the Basque case in Europe, and Native American and French-Canadian cases in North America. Woven throughout the book is the belief in the power of discourse and research to protect and even enhance linguistic diversity through legal recognition and other means. Language protection, however, is only possible if we encourage the acceptance of cultural diversity and multilingualism as a positive outcome for the whole population of the state, not just for a minority with in it. We should abandon the idea of the monolingual mono-cultural nation-state, and encourage the population of each country to adopt the concept of a multi-cultural state.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nLanguage Rights and Cultural Diversity on Shopify\n\nLanguage Rights and Cultural Diversity on Amazon\n\nLanguage Rights and Cultural Diversity on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-49-7\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n396\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nMariann Vaczi\n\nYear\n\n2013\n\nSeries\n\nConference Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n8\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n24.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nPlaying Fields presents the profound reflections of a group of international scholars on how games, sports, and motor practices interact with global-local processes, inequality, gender relations, identity, representation, performance, and emotion through varied modes of analysis, approaches, and styles. Sport here is treated with disciplinary eclecticism featuring sociology, anthropology, history, philosophy, and motor praxeology. The book is structured around three main themes: power, practice, and passion. Part 1, “Power,” considers playing fields as an arena of power and addresses what Joan Acker would call “inequality regimes” in sports. Gender discrimination; “hard” and “soft” essentialism; the concept of justice in sports; gendered collective embodiment and public agency; countercultural grassroots sports practices; and local-global dynamisms, Americanization, and hegemony are all discussed. The second part, “Practice,” focuses on the practice of games as, in the words of Pierre Parlebas, “a type of academy in which social connections are experienced by the body.” Through the study of motor praxeology—the relation of motor practices to the cultural and social context of the bodies that practice them—these chapters delve into the intellectual history of motor action; conceptualizations of the body; and the internal logic of games and how it influences risk-taking attitudes and the experience of emotions. Part 3, “Passion,” looks at the affective dimensions of sports and explores how collective desires are communicated through the emotion that playing fields generate. In the final chapter, a kind of codas and reflection on the entire experience of the remarkable group of scholars who share their work here, Jennifer Hargreaves reflects on her work and life in sport studies.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nPlaying Fields: Power, Practice, and Passion in Sport on Shopify\n\nPlaying Fields: Power, Practice, and Passion in Sport on Amazon\n\nPlaying Fields: Power, Practice, and Passion in Sport on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-44-2\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-935709-45-9\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n228\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nWilhelm von Humboldt\n\nYear\n\n2013\n\nSeries\n\nClassics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n9\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n19.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n34.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThe Selected Basque Writings of Wilhelm von Humboldt fills a gap in the scholarly literature on the renowned Prussian philosopher, linguist, and statesman by providing the first English-language translation of his own account of the second of two seminal trips to the Basque Country in 1801. Humboldt’s encounter with Basque culture was crucial to the later development of his influential thinking on progressive liberalism, and in particular his reconciliation of nationalism and liberalism, especially as a result of his first-hand observation of how the Basques’ strong sense of Basque national identity underpinned the vibrancy of their self-governing institutions and, likewise, how this independence of spirit was the bedrock of what he viewed as their well-governed and efficient society: a modern-day echo, for Humboldt, of the ancient Greek republics. Moreover, the work demonstrates Humboldt’s use of the comparative study technique, and can with reason be interpreted as an early example of both comparative anthropology and comparative linguistics. Part travelogue, part ethnography, and part treatise on the intimate relationship between language, history, and identity, the rich prose of Humboldt’s exuberant account transports readers back to the Basque Country on the eve of modernity. Here he depicts in vivid brilliance the landscape he traverses and the people he meets and observes—their clothes, food, songs and dances, working habits, business dealings, and political discussions. This work is essential to a greater appreciation for Humboldt’s pivotal encounter with the Basque culture, and to a broader historical understanding of studies on the Basque Country itself.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nSelected Basque Writings: The Basques and Announcement of Publication on Shopify\n\nSelected Basque Writings: The Basques and Announcement of Publication on Amazon\n\nSelected Basque Writings: The Basques and Announcement of Publication on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-38-1\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n184\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nIñaki Anazagasti and Josu Erkoreka\n\nYear\n\n2013\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Politics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n6\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n19.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nA Basque Patriot in New York traces the incredible journey of a young jelkide (Basque Nationalist Party activist and patriot) from Vitoria-Gasteiz. Born to a nationalist family in the Araban capital, and a staunch nationalist from a very young age, the book follows Jose Luis de la Lombana through education in Madrid, resistance and incarceration in Vitoria-Gasteiz at the time of the military coup that turned into the Civil War of 1936, escape to France, activism in Barcelona—where he served as the editor of the Basque nationalist daily Euzkadi—in support of the Basque government-in-exile, and then exile. Among others, Lombana was chosen to attend the Second World Youth Congress, held in New York in 1938. During his time of activism in the United States, Lombana made many observations about US society and about Basque nationalism and its conflicts and struggles to reach and make inroads into US and US Basque and Basque-Catholic communities, which make his testimony and story an indispensable read for understanding of this extraordinarily complex and tumultuous period both in the United States and around the world. The book also focuses on efforts to support the Basque government in France and the United States and the subject of propaganda both in favor of Basque nationalism and pro-Franco, especially with regards to the US and world Catholic Communities. Altogether, through the story of this jelkide, a vivid portrait is painted of a time of great crisis, and of extraordinary deeds by many heretofore ordinary people. In the Appendix, the book presents Lombana’s own report on his time in the United States.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nA Basque Patriot in New York on Shopify\n\nA Basque Patriot in New York on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-40-4\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n7.75\"x10\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n35\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nGuillermo Zubiaga\n\nYear\n\n2013\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Originals\n\nSeries No.\n\n10\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n10\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n7.5\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThe Church was an important patron of commercial whaling, and had great economic links with the industry. The first testimony referring to the Basque whaling industry goes back to the year 670 A.D. when Basques from Labourd shipped 40 barrels of whale oil for lighting to the Abby of Jumieges, on the banks of the river Seine, France. Later in 875 A.D. another reference to Basque whaling was Made in the Translations and miracles of Saint Waast. The church of Santa Maria de Lekeitio, built in the XVIth century, is a noteworthy example of the late Biscay Gothic style. The town of Lekeitio became a booming whaling and privateering port throughout the middle ages and the Renaissance. Bayonne’s cathedral, Sainte-Marie, was entirely funded by its whaling industry. In the Basque Country alone there are 3 skull chalices. These Chalices are relics of 3 saints and are used as sacred goblets , filled with sacramental wine or with water as some other “miracle” work such as the treatment of head illnesses. These are: Saint Victor of Gauna, in Alava, and in Navarre Saint Gregory of Sorlada, and Saint William (Guillermo) of Obanos. The word piraterie (piracy in English) may have its origins in the Basque biratari, later piratari: to navigate or better yet “navigator”. We see this Basque suffix in the words Bira(tu) (to) navigate in relation to Biratari (navigator) such as in other examples as in dantza(tu) to dance in relation to dantzari (dancer), sega(tu) to reap compared to segalari (reaper), Gida(tu) (to) lead to Gidari (leader) and so on. The XVII century staged the golden age for Basque privateers. During this century, many otherwise ordinary sailors, begin to employ themselves as corsairs making it a very lucrative business.

It studies \"Basque literary history\" from the understanding of Basque literature as part of a system-a literary system- to which it belongs and from which it receives meaning and direction. Like all languages and literatures, Basque literature has been conditioned by the relationship between language and literature. In the Basque case this is exacerbated by the subordination of Basque literature to the historical situation. Until the end of the twentieth century, to write Basque literature meant mostly to cultivate the Basque language to the extent that authors would inscribe in their works a defense of the language to prove its versatility and compare it to other, more literary-cultivated languages. In this context, a core aspect of Basque literary history's purpose is the wish to establish literature's autonomy in the context of social and cultural life. Authors, when they create literary universes, no longer feel like mere apologists of a minority language that is peripheral amidst the din of Western European literatures. These authors write in a minorized language, but one that is coming of age and hopes to function as an autonomous system in the context of Basque society and aims to get its voice heard in the World Republic of Letters.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBasque Literary History on Shopify\n\nBasque Literary History on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-23-7\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-935709-24-4\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n472\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nSanti de Pablo\n\nYear\n\n2012\n\nSeries\n\nDouglass Scholar Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n2\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n29.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n34.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nFilms may be thought of not only as witnesses to historical processes but also as models in their own right that exercise an influence on society, changing the way it sees itself. It is in this way that such representations help forge collective memory. In those places where there are national conflicts, the cinema plays an important role in shaping dichotomous identities. The Basque Country is an interesting case study in terms of exploring the complex relationships among films, society, nationalism, and political violence, which Santiago de Pablo analyzes in this work, the second in the William A. Douglass Distinguished Scholar Series. The purpose of this book is to examine the historical relationship between films and Basque nationalism from a twofold perspective: the use of cinematic productions by Basque nationalism as a means of inculcating national identity and ideology, and the depiction of Basque nationalism—and especially of ETA terrorism—in films. Cinema provides new analytical perspectives of the history of Basque nationalism and has contributed to the strengthening of Basque national identity, to shaping its collective store of ideas, and to fostering a historical memory of an unmistakably nationalist stripe that is in constant dialogue with—and at times opposed to—other views and national identities that coexist in today’s pluralistic Basque Country.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThe Basque Nation On-Screen on Shopify\n\nThe Basque Nation On-Screen on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-30-5\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n224\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nPello Salaburu and Xabier Alberdi\n\nYear\n\n2012\n\nSeries\n\nCurrent Research Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n9\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n19.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nOf the non-Indo-European languages that survive in Europe, only one of these is in the western half of the continent—Euskara (the Basque language). It is, according to every study and despite the fact that the oldest testimonies in Euskara are only two thousand years old, a language that was used in the region prior to the invasions of Indo-European peoples with other cultures and other languages six thousand years ago. The Basque language, spoken by half a million people, is not related to any other language in the world. While it has constantly been challenged by its upstart linguistic neighbors, most notably French and Spanish, this language has survived through centuries. However, it has only been quite recently—and only in one part of the Basque Country—that Basque has received the stable recognition of being a coofficial language recognized by the public administration. In the space of a few years, Euskara went from being a language spoken mostly in rural areas to being used in the media, at university, and in the offices of the Basque government. In short, it became a “visible” language in a modern society. In the current work we present some of the features that characterize this modern bilingual society and investigate this new situation in Basque history: a history that, for good or bad, is still being written by its protagonists—the inhabitants of the Basque Country, something that is quite unusual in the history of languages.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThe Challenge of a Bilingual Society in the Basque Country on Shopify\n\nThe Challenge of a Bilingual Society in the Basque Country on Amazon\n\nThe Challenge of a Bilingual Society in the Basque Country on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-20-6\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-935709-25-1\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n7\"x10\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n336\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nXabier Irujo\n\nYear\n\n2012\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Politics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n5\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n29.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n44.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\n9.99\n\nBlurb\n\nThis story - that of the government-in-exile of Lehendakari Jose Antonio Agirre and the multitudes of other Basques who were forced by war and oppression to flee their homeland - has not been written in English before and is rather unknown to the Basque, Spanish, and French historiography. Drawing on primary sources; archival documentation; and interviews with many Basque political exiles, resistance members, and former prisoners of labor camps Professor Xabier Irujo tells a gripping story of the Basque autonomous government, conceived during the beginnings of a bloody civil war, forced to organize a mass exile and then overtaken by necessity to feed and clothe its exiled population. Following this initial period, the exiled Basques were then confronted by World War and forced again into flight, this time mainly to the Americas. Never giving up their opposition to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, the government continued its struggle during forty long years of existence, through wars hot and cold as well as countless political developments. While tracing the history of Lehendakari Agirre, this book is more the story of all of the Basques who were forced into exile, and it serves as a testimony to their unwavering determination to return to their homeland. In addition, the book contains an extensive biographical index of many of the heretofore unknown exile activists: writers, politicians, soldiers, intellectuals, but even more so, Basque patriots.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nExpelled from the Motherland: The Government of President Jose Antonio Agirre in Exile, 1937-1960 on Shopify\n\nExpelled from the Motherland: The Government of President Jose Antonio Agirre in Exile, 1937-1960 on Amazon\n\nExpelled from the Motherland: The Government of President Jose Antonio Agirre in Exile, 1937-1960 on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-28-2\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n336\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nMiel Elustondo\n\nYear\n\n2012\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Originals\n\nSeries No.\n\n7\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n24.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nFor Basques around the world, Mr. Basque is the public face of the University of Nevada, Reno's Basque Studies Program, which a president of the Basque Country described as a \"candle in the night\" for the Basques during the long years of the Franco dictatorship; for the Basques of the American West (and indeed the Americas) he is the author who brought their experience to the light of day in his acclaimed book Amerikanuak: Basques in the New World; for Nevadans he is a lifelong resident, a shrewd casino operator, and a member of a true Nevada pioneering family; and for his fellow anglers and sportsmen he is a steady companion on adventures around the world.

Social, political, and cultural complexities, along with increasingly greater social and collective needs, are another feature of the environment in question. Given this environment, companies and organizations in general have to maintain a high level of strategic tension and a significant capacity to adapt and be flexible when faced with different contingencies. Organizations must be driven by people who are committed to its goals, who actively participate in the management of labor processes, who have creative skills, and who are capable of getting along well with others and working as part of a team. Likewise, leaders must lean toward transformational or shared leadership, in which both the management and workers assume responsibility for growth. Cooperation between workers and managers is based on the experience that insofar as the company’s goals are achieved, so will those of each individual person. To appreciate the change, it is important to understand organizational behavior, as there can be no sustainable organizational change without a change in people’s behavior.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBehavior and Organizational Change on Shopify\n\nBehavior and Organizational Change on Amazon\n\nBehavior and Organizational Change on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-13-8\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n232\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nBeleren Bakaikoa and Eneka Albizu\n\nYear\n\n2011\n\nSeries\n\nCurrent Research Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n6\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n19.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nCooperative companies form part of the social economy-a third economic sector beyond the private and public spheres that embraces community, voluntary, and nonprofit activities. While corporations distribute their surpluses in relation to the capital contributions of shareholders, cooperatives do so according to activity of their members; in short, in a cooperative, capital is subordinate to work. The cooperative spirit has been an important feature of Basque society, from the traditional auzolan (literally, \"neighborhood work\") to the development of major cooperative companies like Alfa, Fagor, and ultimately Mondragon, the largest cooperative in the world and a major supplier of products and services nationally and internationally. This book focuses on the changes and challenges faced by the social economy in general and Basque cooperatives in particular in light of the crisis of the welfare state, the growth of neoliberal doctrines and greater privatization, and most recently of all, the global financial crisis. The book is divided into three parts: Part 1 analyzes the origins, values, and culture of Basque cooperativism. Part 2 focuses on innovation in and the management system of Basque cooperatives as a source of competitive advantage vis-a-vis traditional corporations. Finally, part 3 addresses the response of Basque cooperatives to globalization in general and the current global financial crisis in particular.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBasque Cooperativism on Shopify\n\nBasque Cooperativism on Amazon\n\nBasque Cooperativism on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-03-9\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n7\"x9.5\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n288\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nXabier Irujo and Pedro Ibarra Güell\n\nYear\n\n2011\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Politics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n2\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n33\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nDoes the Basque Country have a separate “political system”? This book seeks to answer this complicated question. The Basque Country forms a differentiated cultural community that shares customs, folklore, a way of life, a language—Basque—that is among the oldest in Europe, and yet is divided between two international frontiers—France and Spain—and has major internal subdivisions, most notably between the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (the provinces of Araba, Bizkaia, and Gipuzkoa) and the Foral Community of Navarre. In France, the Basque provinces of Lapurdi, Lower Navarre, Zuberoa (Iparralde) have little or no administrative separation from the centralist regime, while Hegoalde—the Basque provinces on the southern side of the international frontier—has varying degrees of autonomous powers within the fitfully decentralizing Spanish state, but is split into two distinct subdivisions with different powers, relations to the central state, and historical development. An added layer of complexity is added by the supranational powers of the European Union and the Basque Country’s place in it, as well as the historically important relations of the Basque Country to the members of its worldwide diaspora. And, finally, even within the various subdivisions there are important differences of opinion regarding fundamental questions such as the desire for independence or autonomy, the political violence that has marred the region, relations to national or central states, and a variety of other issues. Any attempt to impose order on this chaos is difficult, but the author’s in this book try to respond to this question with a wealth of historical and political detail and insight.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nShopify link\n\nn/a\n\nBasque Political Systems on Amazon\n\nBasque Political Systems on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-935709-07-7\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-877802-99-7\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n460\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nPhillipe Veyrin\n\nYear\n\n2010\n\nSeries\n\nClassics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n6\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n27.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n44.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nPhilippe Veyrin wrote Les Basques de Labourd, de Soule et de Basse Navarre: leur histoire et leurs traditions during an extraordinarily tumultuous period in French Basque history. He started the manuscript in 1941, one year into the German occupation of the Basque coast when Vichy propaganda about regionalism gave some Basques hope for a new ethnic status and a restoration of ancient rights. The director of the Basque Museum (Musée Basque) in Baiona urged Veyrin to \"write a new book about the Basques . . . and to make a portrait of the Basques available to all those who are curious to know more about or who love the most interesting, albeit smallest, pays in France, known throughout the world for its language, traditions, and virtues,\" a region that \"arouses intellectual interest and commands respect.\" As the leading institutional base for Basque ethnic identity in 1942, the Musée Basque was ideally placed to publish the first four hundred copies of Les Basques. The museum brought out the second edition of Les Basques in 1943, with a print run of two thousand copies that sold out almost immediately. In his foreword, Philippe Veyrin explained that he sought not so much to describe as to explain the Basques and their land and, at every turn, to link the present with the past. The CBS Press is proud and pleased to publish Veyrin’s classic work, The Basques of Lapurdi, Zuberoa, and Lower Navarre: Their History and Their Traditions, in English translation for the first time.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThe Basques of Lapurdi, Zuberoa, and Lower Navarre: Their History and Their Traditions on Shopify\n\nThe Basques of Lapurdi, Zuberoa, and Lower Navarre: Their History and Their Traditions on Basque Books\n\nThe Basques of Lapurdi, Zuberoa, and Lower Navarre: Their History and Their Traditions on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-877802-93-5\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-877802-89-8\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n7\"x9.75\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n314\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nSabin Bikandi\n\nYear\n\n2009\n\nSeries\n\nOccasional Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n18\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n29.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n39.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThis book explores the pipe and tabor dance music of Berriz (a small town in the Basque Country), as revealed through the life and work of Alejandro Aldekoa (1920–96), dance master and txistularia (“pipe and tabor player”). His life spanned the difficult period of the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, and the present uncertain political situation. His art both responded to and shaped the times he lived through, becoming part of the process for expressing Basque nationalism. Sabin Bikandi addresses many issues: the influence of Basque nationalist ideology on music and dance, the part played by the Association of Txistulariak of the Basque Country and its journal Txistulari in articulating that ideology, the role of the dance master as a ritual specialist in the transmission and performance of the tradition, the importance placed on local knowledge of Western music theory, the repertoire of the ritual dances (including new prescriptive notations for their performance), and the significance of the ritual dances as a cohesive element of Basque identity in this ethnically mixed community.\n\nReviews\n\n“Aldekoa’s biography is not a unique, isolated, or extreme case. Instead, it reflects the ups and downs in the life of most Basques who experienced the Second Republic, the Spanish Civil War, and Franco’s dictatorship.

Swashbuckler, brawler, hard-headed businessperson, soldier, gallant, celebrity, transvestite, nun? How can one fail to be fascinated by her? A woman, yet a man; a soldier, yet a nun; Spanish, yet Basque. Catalina de Erauso embodied the contradictions and conflicts of the Early Modern Period, but she also transcended them in her own way. She became a stage on which we see how tensions between different identities played out in sixteenth—and seventeenth—century Spain, particularly the tensions between two sexual identities, male and female, and between the competing and multiple national “identities” already defined and being defined within that new thing that was “Spain.” This book explores the different facets of Erauso’s persona: her sexual identity and the factors that determined her choice of gender roles; and her Basque origin and its impact on her life and her self-image.\n\nReviews\n\n“Buckle up your seat belt, Dear Reader, since you are in for a wild ride! Catalina de Erauso, the subject of this incisive biography, was one of the more controversial (and certainly bizarre) figures of the early seventeenth century.

The multiple and varied interactions between Basque and European cultures have been historically explored from political, social, economic and anthropological perspectives. Although several books, articles and reviews have been published on the topic, the intention of the present work is to offer a series of reflections on Basque and European cultures through the lens of cultural and media studies. In this volume, several authors focus on the contribution of the cultural studies project to European academic contexts beyond traditional Anglo-American venues. They portray the difficult negotiations and, in some cases, even open resistance that these studies pose in certain contexts, but at the same time, the articles included here are living proof of a relevant presence in our universities and in our lives. This work, then, attempts to superimpose cultures and disiciplines that are often kept in fixed categories. The sixteen chapters that make up the book are divided into six sections: Basque Cultural Production, Basque Texts and Contexts: The Basque Press, European Texts and Contexts, European Case Studies, and Spanish Disciplines and Cultural Studies.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nBasque/European Perspectives on Media and Cultural Studies on Shopify\n\nBasque/European Perspectives on Media and Cultural Studies on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\nn/a\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-877802-90-4\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n7.25\"x10\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n313\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nMari Jose Olaziregi\n\nYear\n\n2009\n\nSeries\n\nConference Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n5\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\nn/a\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n39.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThis book is a collection of the contributions made by Basque writers and American and European academics to the international symposium, “Writers In Between Languages: Minority Literatures in the Global Scene,” held May 15–17, 2008 at the Center for Basque Studies, University of Nevada, Reno, in the United States. Our symposium attempted to think about the consequences of bilingualism for writers in a minority language, like Basque, in that they are located in that “in-between” of different cultural and identity communities and subjected to constant exchange and recognition of differences. One could say that practically all the current 800,000 Basque-speakers or euskaldunak who live on both sides of the Pyrenees in Spain and France are bilingual. And that this bilingualism is formed in conjunction with such widely spoken languages as Spanish and such prestigious languages in literary circles as French; languages that, in turn, have been displaced by the enormously central and legitimizing place that English occupies in the current global framework. The symposium attempted, moreover, to debate the consequences implied by linguistic extra-territorialization for many authors in a minority language, the realignment implied by the hegemony of English for all other literatures, and the options open to a minority author to get their voice heard in the World Republic of Letters. Together with the above themes, certain aspects of the academic study of a minority literature such as that of Basque completed the list of subjects we intended to examine.\n\nReviews\n\n“All authors who write in a minority language at some point find themselves struggling to answer a basic question: Why do you do what you do?

Do governments really carry out the wishes of the people who elect them? In this work, the first in the William A. Douglass Distinguished Scholar Series, Pedro Ibarra Güell questions conventional approaches to democratic theory that judge democracy by elections alone. Specifically, he argues in favor of a new interpretation of democracy that incorporates not just electoral processes but also an established set of relations between citizens and leaders that facilitate a greater harmony, or concurrence, between popular demands and political decision-making. He contends that such an approach, which he terms relational democracy, is in fact demonstrably more democratic than the purely representative emocracy of many current political systems. Yet he is also aware that many claims for greater participatory democracy fall short when it comes to their practical implementation. Therefore, his highly original proposal for relational democracy is grounded in an appreciation of the pitfalls of relying on theory alone, and instead offers what he believes to be a viable and practical alternative to representative democracy. By way of a conclusion, the book applies the basic tenets of the argument in favor of relational democracy to a specific case study, evaluating the nature of democracy in the Basque Country.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nRelational Democracy on Shopify\n\nRelational Democracy on Amazon\n\nScholarworks\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-877802-81-2\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-877802-80-5\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n375\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nedited by Pello Salaburu\n\nYear\n\n2008\n\nSeries\n\nClassics Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n4\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n29.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n39.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThis work brings together a number of texts by Koldo Mitxelena (also known as Luis Michelena) concerning the Basque language, its history, and its literature. The Basque language is used on both sides of the Pyrenees, along the Bay of Biscay, in the borderlands between Spain and France. It is a non–Indo-European language of unknown origins and with no known relatives; it is an ergative language, with a very different syntactic structure from Spanish, French, English, or German. Some of the texts in the present work are more general or informative, while others require a degree of familiarity with linguistics. The reader will find a clear explanation of the Basque language, together with a systematic account of the theories surrounding its relationship with other languages, its dialects, and its literature. Furthermore, there is ample information about certain central features associated with the history of the language, about its phonetic and phonological system, and about the first writings in Basque. Also included is the text of his unification proposal that, since 1968, has made the written unification of the language possible. As a general criterion, the texts selected here have not been previously published in English.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nKoldo Mitxelena: Selected Writings of a Basque Scholar on Shopify\n\nKoldo Mitxelena: Selected Writings of a Basque Scholar on Amazon\n\nKoldo Mitxelena: Selected Writings of a Basque Scholar on Scholarworks\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-877802-85-0\n\nISBN hardcover\n\nn/a\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n5.5\"x8.5\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n120\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nBernardo Atxaga\n\nYear\n\n2008\n\nSeries\n\nBasque Literature Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n6\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n19.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n24.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThis sixth volume of the CBS Literature series presents for the first time in English two of the author’s short stories previously published in Euskara, the Basque language, “Two Letters All at Once,” in which Old Martin, a Basque immigrant living in Boise, receives two letters from Europe in a period of ten days, and “When a Snake Stares at a Bird.” Bernardo Atxaga broke onto the international scene with the 1988 publication of Obabakoak in Euskara. The novel has been published in 26 languages, including an English edition (Vintage, 1994, Graywolf 2009), and earned the author Spain’s top narrative prize, the Premio Nacional de Narrativa, the Premio Milepages (the Paris Milepages Prize) (1991), the Premio Tres Coronas de los Pirineos Atlánticos (the Atlantic Pyrenees Three Crowns Prize) (1995), among others. That book was praised in The Observer of London as “a brilliant novel, full of life,” and by The New York Times Book Review as a “delicious paella, Baroque and Spanish.” The emotional landscape of Obaba can be described as a virtual infinite where the narrator’s memory begins weaving a fabric suggestive of stories, which thread together the meta-narrative reflection with strategies of literature of the fantastic. In Two Basque Stories, Atxaga turns his attention to complex lives lived in the “rustic” Basque village of Obaba and the creative process of identity. The first short story, “Two Letters All at Once,” tells the story of Old Martin, a former sheepherder consigned to a generic Boise neighborhood. In order to make sense of his life, Martin narrates for an un-understanding grandson the life-altering deception that led him from his native village to the American West. In “When a Snake Stares at a Bird,” a young city-bred boy spending time in his grandfather’s village comes to realize that things he once believed to be simple: nature, animals, and his grandfather, are much more complex than he could have imagined. Evocative illustrations by Antton Olariaga compliment these at once simple and deceptively complex stories. These stories, originally published in Euskara in 1984, cemented the popularity of Atxaga in his homeland.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nTwo Basque Stories on Shopify\n\nTwo Basque Storieson Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a\n\nISBN paperback\n\n978-1-877802-68-3\n\nISBN hardcover\n\n978-1-877802-77-5\n\nISBN EPUB\n\nn/a\n\nTrim Size\n\n6\"x9\"\n\nNumber of pages\n\n522\n\nAuthor/Editor\n\nJavier Corcuera Atienza\n\nYear\n\n2006\n\nSeries\n\nOccasional Papers Series\n\nSeries No.\n\n12\n\nPrice (paperback)\n\n29.95\n\nPrice (hardcover)\n\n39.95\n\nPrice (EPUB)\n\nn/a\n\nBlurb\n\nThis work seeks to interrogate the relationship between ideas and action through a historical account of how images of violence and warfare pervaded the discourse of Basque nationalism—principally through the parameters of the hegemonic Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV or Basque Nationalist Party)—from its foundation in the 1890s through the mid-twentieth century. Ultimately, it argues that a culture of political violence emerged within the Basque nationalist movement that eventually resulted in the creation of ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna, Basque Country and Freedom) in 1959. However, the undertone of violent struggle in substate Basque nationalism was itself a response to the aggressive statist nationalism of Spain, a country whose problematic transition to modernity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries engendered multiple forms of social, political, and structural violence within its own borders and beyond. The work views Basque political violence, then, as the contemporary manifestation of a past cultural experience, based on a problematic dialogue with the emergence of modern Spain. Yet it does not limit its explanation of ETA’s emergence to the Spanish context alone. Rather, it emphasizes the transnational context in which nationalist movements emerge and develop. Specifically, in the Basque case, and at varying times, the national struggles of Cuba, Morocco, and Ireland were extremely influential. Moreover, the immediate origins of ETA were strongly influenced by post–World War II intellectual currents, from existentialism to the liberating theories of anticolonial nationalist movements.\n\nReviews\n\nn/a\n\nThe Origins, Ideology, and Organization of Basque Nationalism, 1876–1903 on Shopify\n\nThe Origins, Ideology, and Organization of Basque Nationalism, 1876–1903 on Amazon\n\nScholarworks link\n\nn/a"
