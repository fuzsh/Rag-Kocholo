Hold/The National Alliance Program in RMI with my Master of Science in Risk Management and Insurance! I’m very grateful to have been able to participate in such a womderful program. Thankful for the leadership and teaching provided by Cassandra Cole, Patty Born, Paul Schriefer and the rest of the faculty from the program! And especially grateful for the support from my wonderful wife Sara Elise Stephens, AIC who was with me every step of the way (and didn’t let me use the “I’m a college student” excuse whenever I tried). Proud to be a Seminole! #gonoles"
