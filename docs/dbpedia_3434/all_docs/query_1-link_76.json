Currently, fundamental mathematical methodologies taught at undergraduate level are often advanced through independent learning by individual researchers. They develop their mathematical skills as appropriate rather than being made aware of the potential of advanced mathematical tools at the onset of their research career. Furthermore, most researchers in acoustics do not have access to master level courses to broaden their postgraduate study. Attempts to remedy this in the UK were made through summer schools held in 2003, 2005 and 2007 at Southampton and Salford Universities in the UK. The content and timetable planning, recruitment and student feedback from these Schools are reported together with general conclusions about their performance.\n\nFull Paper\n\nThe delivery of noise and vibration study material and real life practice\n\nGroothoff, Beno\n\nEnvironmental Directions, Brisbane, Australia\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPresenting workshops, lectures and seminars on noise and vibration over the last 20 years has given the author an insight into the effectiveness of the taking on board and putting into practice' of the material studied by the participants. It has also demonstrated the need for constantly updating the study material to keep the presented material relevant and meaningful for the changing audiences. The inclusion of case studies enhances students' involvement and problem solving skills. The advancement of computer technology has made it possible to make the presentations more realistic by incorporating case studies by using audio and video of noise and its effects into power point presentations to which students and other participants can relate. Despite these advancements in study material delivery, in real life basic mistakes, which should not happen, are being observed regularly when it comes to noise assessment. This is particularly true with the use of noise dose meters and, to a lesser extent, the use of sound level meters. Basic mistakes include for noise dose meters the setting-up, attachment and removal of the instrument and for sound level meters not recording where the measurement was made and not obtaining additional information e.g. about the activities and exposure duration.\n\nFull Paper\n\nProblem based learning in acoustics at Aalborg University\n\nHammershøi, Dorte , Ordoñez, Rodrigo , Christensen, Flemming , Nielsen, Sofus Birkedal\n\nAcoustics, Aalborg University, Denmark\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe master program in Acoustics (M. Sc.) from Aalborg University is taught at the Department of Electronic system. The M. Sc. program consists of three semesters with course units and problem based project work organized in groups, and a final semester for a master thesis. During the first three semesters, the learning objectives are distributed between courses with independent examination, and a semester project. Each semester has a theme the projects must comply with. Either supervisors, students or industry propose the problem that become the basis for the project work. Under supervision, the students narrow down the problem, address possible solutions, and typically implement one or more of the options for further evaluation. The courses supplement the project work by adding specific and general knowledge of the subject areas of each semester. The courses either have direct application in the project work, or are defining for the candidate‚Äôs professional profile. This presentation gives an overview of Problem Based Learning organized in groups in the M. Sc. in Acoustics program of Aalborg University. Examples of projects and course activities are presented to illustrate the relation and interaction between course and project work.\n\nFull Paper\n\nA viscoelastic figure model of tongue for understanding speech articulation\n\nHirayama, Makoto J.\n\nKanazawa Institute of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSpeech is a physiological signal which is generated by muscular motions of lung, vocal cords, larynx, jaw, tongue, and lips. Coordinated articulatory movements of these organs are so complex that they are difficult to be understood by either students or professionals. Especially for tongue, anatomical structures and functions are well studied but speech articulatory movements can be said that they are still under investigations.\n\nTo help understanding tongue shape and motions, I made a figure model of tongue using viscoelastic material of urethane rubber gel in the following procedure. At first, a cast of tongue is formed by baking clay which is hardened by heating. The shape of tongue is decided with multiple references of anatomy books, MRI images, educational models, and our real tongues. Next, I made a mold with silicon. Then, I molded and duplicated the figure model with urethane rubber gel. The model includes internal and external tongue muscles, although the current version is made as a whole shape model of tongue body consisting of combined muscles.\n\nCompared to the current materials used in speech science education, such as drawings, pictures, videos, or human body models, the proposed tongue figure model is useful for understanding three dimensional tongue shape and internal and external tongue muscles' positions and motions, too. Because students can hold and touch the realistic tongue model and make it move and deform by pushing and pulling this viscoelastic tongue body. Pictures and explanatory texts do not make sense but the proposed model can help for students to understand anatomical structures and functions of speech articulation intuitively. From questionnaires from students in a speech science seminar, it is founded that the proposed model is an effective tool for understanding speech articulation. It can be applied not only to teach speech science, but also to elucidate speech articulation by scientists and engineers, and also to develop a tongue actuator for speaking robots.\n\nFull Paper\n\nCase study of curriculum development for technical listening training for employees of an acoustic related company\n\nKawahara, Kazuhiko (1) , Ito, Toshihiro (2) , Kobayashi, Tetsu (3) , Iwamiya, Shin-ichiro (1) , Takada, Masayuki (1)\n\n(1) Faculty of Design, Kyushu University, Japan (2) Yamaha Corporation, Japan (3) Yamaha Business Support Corporation, Japan\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis is a case study of curriculum development for technical listening training. Technical listening training is a systematic education program designed to allow prospective acoustic engineers and sound designers to enhance their auditory sensitivity. Authors established a training strategy in an acoustics related company; Yamaha Corporation. We re-organized existing, and developed new, curricula for a training suite for company employees. Discrimination, level difference identification and frequency identification training were classified as 'beginners training'. Identification of reverberation time and some application specific training were classified for 'expert training'. The company successfully conducted 9 days of training for freshman engineers. Trainee learning curves showed auditory sensitivity was improved.\n\nFull Paper\n\nEAA Summer Schools\n\nMaffei, L. (1) , Vorländer, Michael (2) , Svensson, P. (3) , Jambrosic, K. (4)\n\n(1) 2nd University of Naples, Italy (2) RWTH Aachen University, Germany (3) NTNU Trondheim, Norway (4) University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nABSTRACT\n\nEAA Summer Schools are an integral part of the Young Acousticians Programme in the European Acoustics Association. They consist of various courses on advanced level, taught by internationally recognized and distinguished experts in Acoustics, and they are integrated into a European regional conference. Furthermore, structured sessions of the conference are related to the summer school courses, thus connecting basic lectures to keynotes and other invited papers on advanced topics. Those sessions are co-chaired one experienced expert and one young acoustician, typically a doctoral student. The first EAA Summer School will be held in Ljubljana, Slovenia, with short courses on Soundscapes, Voice and Musical Acoustics, Building Acoustics, Hydroacoustics, Numerical Methods, Psychoacoustics and Ultrasound. In the presentation we will illustrate the background and the motivation of this initiative. Content, organization and future plans of integration in the European higher education in acoustics will be discussed.\n\nFull Paper\n\nIntegral curriculum on noise control in Spain: a cooperative task\n\nRomeu, J. , Genesca, M. , Pamies, T.\n\nAcoustical and Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (LEAM), Technical University of Catalonia, Spain\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSince the European Directive on Environmental Noise 2002/49 came into effect requiring strategic agglomeration and infrastructure noise maps to be made, the demand on environmental acoustics knowledge has been boosted in Spain. Currently several groups and companies are available to carry out noise surveys and pointing out the noise causes in different streets or areas of a city. However, a second stage is starting now: once the noise causes are identified, control noise techniques needs to be applied. This fact is supported in the Spanish adaptation of this regulation known as Ley del Ruido (2003) that states that noise control techniques should be applied to minimize the acoustic emission of municipal work activities, municipal devices, infrastructures, road workThis means that a demand on noise control knowledge is arising. This knowledge is scarcely provided in the bachelor degrees currently available in Spain, but there are some master degrees focussed in acoustics. However, it is difficult to find an institution that can cover all the topics needed for a complete Acoustics curriculum. This work analyses the feasibility of creating an integral curriculum in noise control involving different Spanish research groups in order to take benefit of the expertise of each one to cover the legal and industrial needs of Acoustics knowledge. In that way, the teaching effort would be optimized and the appropriate facilities would be available, however funds would be necessary for the mobility of teachers and students.\n\nFull Paper\n\nDistance learning program for professional career in acoustics\n\nStead, Matthew (1) , Burgess, Marion (2)\n\n(1) AECOM, Adelaide, SA, Australia (2) Acoustics and Vibration Unit, UNSW@ADFA, Canberra, Australia\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAcoustical consulting companies frequently face the need to employ staff but find that, while there may be very good applicants with engineering and science backgrounds there are few that have any experience in acoustics. Larger consultancies can provide 'in-house' training but this is a strain on resources and smaller consultancies do not have this capacity. Any course available via the formal university system may not be available at a suitable time or location. A flexible distance learning program of study, based on the UK Institute of Acoustics Diploma, has been developed as a short course and managed via the university. A key feature of this program is that there is no need for the registrants to attend any central location at any time during the program. The early experiences with implementing the program have been influenced by the continued interest and support from the senior, experienced acoustical consultants. In this paper we will discuss the structure and experiences in the implementation of this fully flexible distance learning program.\n\nFull Paper\n\nIdentification, classification and acquisition of sounds for spatial orientation and mobility training of blind and visually impaired persons\n\nTomaszewski, Franciszek (1) , Czechyra, Bartosz (1) , Skrodzka, Ewa (2)\n\n(1) Institute of Combustion Engines and Transportation, Division of Rail Vehicles, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland (2) Institute of Acoustics, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland\n\nABSTRACT\n\nTeaching and training of spatial orientation and mobility (SOM) is an important element of their education. Despite progress in supporting equipment technology and study on spatial orientation, blind people use still old, not always effective methods. Therefore, a method of SOM training based on environmental sounds may be a huge step in \"opening\" a surrounding world for them. The method will be a supplement, not a substitution, of a popular orientation method based on a white cane. A basic tool for the method is a library of sound events and vibrations'. In the library both vibration and acoustic signals, which may be helpful or disturbing for SOM are collected as well as specific sounds of places and objects, which are often visited by persons with disabilities of sight. In the first step an identification of necessary signals was done, i.e. a questionnaire about various aspects of signals helping/disturbing spatial orientation was administered to blind and visually impaired. In the next step potential signals for recording were classified according to estimated level of teaching. Next, signals were recorded using artificial head or in-the-ear microphones at the attitude of 1.6 m and 0.9 m. A survey of collected signals and their classification will be presented.\n\nFull Paper\n\nWorkshop on advanced room acoustic prediction modelling\n\nWenmaekers, R. H. C. (1) , van Hout, N. H. A. M. (1) , van Luxemburg, L. C. J. (1) , Rindel, J. H. (2)\n\n(1) Level Acoustics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands (2) Odeon, Lyngby, Denmark\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe use of acoustic 3D modelling software has become increasingly popular among acousticians. Some software developers offer introduction courses for starting users. However, there is a need for more advanced courses for experienced modellers. Such a course should not only consist of lectures with the scientific background of the model, but should also give room for sharing practical experience so one can learn from one another. In this context a master class on room acoustic prediction modelling has taken place in January 2010. A significant part of this master class consisted of a modelling workshop. By working on an assignment in small groups participants were stimulated to discuss ideas and exchange knowledge.\n\nThe workshop was divided into four different parts, each part carefully tuned to the theoretical lectures in between. The workshop assignment was to compare predicted room acoustical parameters with measurement results concerning reverberation and speech intelligibility in an open plan office. Also an auralisation had to be made using multiple sound sources. The open plan office of the Laboratorium voor Akoestiek of Eindhoven University of Technology where the workshop took place served as an interesting modelling object. This room was interesting for educational reasons, since the participants were inside the room, as well as for acoustical reasons, because it consists of two coupled volumes, many details like furniture and a wide range of different materials.\n\nIn this paper the assignment will be elucidated and the results will be presented. The response of the participants and the experience of the master showed that a workshop is an indispensible part of master classes in the field of room acoustics.\n\nFull Paper\n\nAcoustic education: Experiments for off-campus teaching and learning\n\nWild, Graham , Swan, Geoff\n\nSchool of Engineering, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, WA, Australia\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn undergraduate Physics and Engineering courses on acoustics, experiments typically involve the use of a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) and a Function Generator (FG). These relatively expensive and bulky pieces of bench top equipment make it prohibitive for external, distance, or off-campus students to be involved in experimental work, without attending a residential school. However, there is a growing demand, particularly from the Engineering sector, for courses to be more available remotely. To that end, Edith Cowan University is investigating the possibility of remote laboratory programs, which can be completed by off-campus students to ensure their Applied Physics or Engineering knowledge, is balanced by experimental experience. In this work, we show the implementation of a computer based DSO and FG, using the computers sound card. Here the PCs microphone jack is used as the DSO input, and the speaker jack is used as the FG output. In an effort to reduce the cost of implementing the experiment, we examine software available for free online. A small number of applications were compared in terms of their interface and func-tionality, for both the DSO and FG. The software system was then used to conduct a number of acoustics experiments relevant to undergraduate Physics and Engineering. These experiments include, the Physics of Music, Standing Waves in Pipes, and the Properties of Sound Waves. There are two primary benefits to the computer based system developed. The first is in terms of the enhancement to learning by students at the undergraduate level, where the knowledge learnt by off-campus students can be significantly improved with the use of practical experimental work. Secondly, remote experiments could provide additional components of laboratory work for students in on-campus subjects where resource issues are making traditional and comprehensive supervised laboratory programs hard to maintain.\n\nFull Paper\n\nLeft-handed elastic shear and longitudinal elastic waves in 2D phononic crystals made of a solid matrix\n\nCroënne, Charles (1,3) , Hladky-Hennion, Anne-Christine (1,3) , Vasseur, Jérôme (1,3) , Bavencoffe, Maxime (1,2,3) , Tinel, Alain (2,3) , Morvan, Bruno (2,3) , Dubus, Bertrand (1,3)\n\n(1) IEMN dpt ISEN, UMR CNRS 8520, Lille, France (2) LOMC, FRE CNRS 3102, Le Havre, France (3) FANO, FR CNRS 3110, France\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWaves propagating in left-handed materials have unusual properties such as phase and group velocities of opposite signs and negative refraction index. Periodic lattices have been shown to exhibit such properties both for electromagnetic (photonic crystals) and in-fluid acoustic (phononic crystals) waves. This work addresses the question of the existence of left handed elastic waves in phononic crystals. Two-dimensional phononic crystals made of square lattices of cylindrical cavities or inclusions in a solid matrix are considered. Dispersion curves are computed using plane wave expansion method for real wave vectors in the Brillouin zone and finite element method for complex wavenumbers along a specific propagation direction. From these results, the existence and symmetry of the left-handed propagation mode in the phononic crystal is discussed and its relationship with lattice geometry and constitutive materials is analyzed.\n\nFull Paper\n\nDiffraction of bulk waves on phononic crystals\n\nHerbison, Sarah W.

Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering, Metz-Technopole, France (2) Institut FEMTO-ST, Université de Franche-Comté, Besançon, France\n\nABSTRACT\n\nPhononic crystals have attracted much research interest in the last decade due to their unique properties (band gaps, etc.) and potential applications in acoustic filtering and novel transducer design, among others. Many studies have examined the acoustic wave propagation that occurs inside (infinite) phononic crystals. However, in order for phononic crystals to find application in actual devices, they must be of finite size and the diffraction that may occur on the surface of the crystal becomes important. This work presents the results of experiments performed on a 2D phononic crystal consisting of steel cylinders in a water matrix. The diffraction of bulk waves that occurs on the exterior surface of the crystal will be examined, and the surface of the crystal will be shown to function as an acoustic diffraction grating. In addition, angular scans of the diffracted fields will examine the possibility of surface wave generation along the exterior surface of the crystal. It is expected that these results will contribute to a better understanding of finite-size phononic crystals and aid in the development of devices employing such crystals.\n\nFull Paper\n\nComposite square and monomial power sweeps for SNR customization in acoustic measurements\n\nHuszty, Csaba (1) , Sakamoto, Shinichi (2)\n\n(1) Graduate School, The University of Tokyo, Japan (2) Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSwept signals for acoustic measurements are widely used nowadays to obtain impulse responses of the system under test.
