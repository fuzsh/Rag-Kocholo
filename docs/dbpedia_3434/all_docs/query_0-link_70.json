        "text": "Last year, Rozalén and El Chojín released a song ('No es egoísmo') which combined the best of both their musical worlds. Espacio Iberia brought them together again and their talk revolved around the ‘insanity’ they devote their lives to: music.\n\nEven though there was no flamenco on at Jesús Carmona’s house when he was little, its rhythm was already coursing through his veins. He started out at the tender age of seven and is now one of the most well-regarded flamenco dancers in the world.\n\n“Wine stirs passions that go beyond reason.” Fernando Mora, who left engineering 15 years ago for wine making and is one of the greatest experts on wine in the world today, a Master of Wine (MW), knows this well.\n\nHow would you react if, at the age of 35, you saw yourself for the first time alongside your parents in a photo? Writer Laura Ferrero decided to delve into her family history and the result is one of the most acclaimed novels of 2023: ‘The Astronauts’.\n\nFor Laia Estruch, art knows no bounds. Although her work stems from sculpture, it centres around the body, its movements and the voice. Recently, her work ‘Trena’ was exhibited at the Sala Oval of the MNAC (Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya [National Art Museum of Catalonia]).\n\nEven though there was no flamenco on at Jesús Carmona’s house when he was little, its rhythm was already coursing through his veins. He started out at the tender age of seven and is now one of the most well-regarded flamenco dancers in the world.\n\nOn the 30th of May, Marina Tuset will play at Espacio Iberia Madrid, a unique opportunity to enjoy one of the most keyed up artists on the Spanish music scene live.

A dream that, after winning three silvers at the last World Championships, seems destined to come true.\n\nSince she was little, Silvia Mas learnt how to read the wind. The wind sometimes blows in your favour and other times against you, but it always brings good tidings. This is what one of the most award-winning yachtswomen in Spanish sailing believes.\n\nThe winner of the Spanish National Gastronomy Award for Best Dining Room Management has a shining career spanning 25 years. Sara Fort, who has already shaken up the industry, assures us that receiving your diners with a warm smile is the key to being a good host.\n\nEager to make people laugh and without disowning his past with Tricicle, Carles Sans celebrates being... alone at last! A sentiment that’s the name of his first solo performance, ‘¡Por fin solo!’, which will tour theatres across Spain.\n\nThis completely blind Paralympic athlete dreams of winning his third Paralympic gold medal in Paris and, to make that dream come true, he admits that mental health is just as important as physical health, if not more so. A graduate in Psychology, he defends the value of this science in sport.\n\nTu Otra Bonita is a band that has had to ‘sweat’ for each listener, as they themselves admit. After the success of ‘Crema’, they’re adding the finishing touches to their next album while preparing for a mini-tour across music halls in November.\n\nWith the prestige of being renowned and the excitement of being a contender. This is the letter of introduction of Tomás Aparicio, debater and student at the University of Vigo, at the World Universities Debating Championship in Spanish. His key to success? Never giving up.\n\nWhen Rodrigo Conde, a rower, gave up on the Games, it changed his life. For good. Now, after leaving behind the lightweight category, which forced him to take his body to the limit, he dreams of stepping on the podium in Paris.\n\nThe gold Alberto Ginés won at the Tokyo Games turned him into a star overnight. When this climber stepped out of the spotlight, he returned to his training sessions with one main goal: to get motivated again.\n\nHer passion for photography runs in the family. Her father, a shutterbug, used to take her photo often, which is why, when young Estela started shooting photos with her own camera, she featured the people who were part of her life.\n\nTime, such a valuable and rare resource in today’s world, is what Lala Serrano dedicates to her photography. Her analogue camera captures moments that she doesn’t look for, but that find her, extracting beauty and poetry.\n\nAn innate gift as clear as his ideas, Palomo Spain has an extraordinary ability to connect current needs with deep cultural roots and a constant curiosity that drives him to break the norms and fly high while keeping his feet on the ground.\n\nBeing in love with the creative process itself is what keeps pianist James Rhodes hooked on music, literature and photography. We went inside his home to get to know him a little better.\n\nA whirlwind. This is the natural phenomenon Adriana Cerezo is most like both on and off the tatami. And that strength is what carries this taekwondo athlete through the air at each championship and during each training session.\n\nDreams sometimes await us thousands of miles away. Leaving his roots behind, Hugo González de Oliveira flew to the United States to make his dream come true: becoming one of the best swimmers in the world.\n\nThis journalist and writer —or storyteller as she defines herself— Carme Chaparro remembers walking around on Sant Jordi [Saint George’s Day] with a backpack full of books for her idols to sign. Today, she’s the one doing the signing.\n\nSince last December, a severe injury has kept Niko Shera off the tatami. Any other judoka hoping to win a medal at the Paris Games would be anxious, but he keeps calm and collected, and only thinks about winning gold.\n\nYou don’t find filmmakers like Carla Simón, with a sincere, humble and honest gaze, every day. With just two films, 'Summer 1993' and 'Alcarràs', which aspires to three Platino Awards, this Catalan filmmaker has turned into a role model for Spanish film.\n\nWords are the raw material Leticia Sala works with and she has the virtue of cutting them down and conveying more with less. Her first short-story collection, ‘Los cisnes de Macy’s’, is proof of this.\n\nWhen she was a child, Inma Bermúdez didn’t know what design was, but she was already a designer. Today, with the 2022 Spanish National Design Award under her belt, she continues to create objects that cast light upon our everyday lives.\n\nVicky Sevilla’s career is dazzling. She admits that at the age of 17 she didn’t even know how to fry an egg, but at 29 she’s become the youngest chef to receive a Michelin star. It’s never too late to discover your talent.\n\nSometimes just a few notes are enough to remember a film and feel moved again. Composer Fernando Velázquez, one of the most renowned and well-respected in Spain, knows what we’re talking about.\n\nBreaking will make its debut at the next Olympic Games and Spain has one of the best b-boys in the world: Juan de la Torre, better known as Xak. Do you want to learn more about him and this sport?\n\nHis first commission was photographing the estuary in Vigo. Thirty years later, Tino Soriano has captured the most remote places on Earth on his endless travels with his camera. And he’s not planning to stop anytime soon.\n\nTwo friends with no other ambition than to make “relaxed pop” to have fun and entertain people. The Besmaya formula seems simple, but behind it is a lot of talent and many hours spent together.\n\nThis Basque actor is one of the protagonists of the successful 'Alpha Males' series, which invites us to reflect on what it means to be a man in the 21st century. And it does so through humour, turning laughter into its best ally.\n\nFor Josefa Ros Velasco, 2022 Spanish National Research Award, boredom is negative because it creates discomfort, but, at the same time, it has a positive side: it encourages us to take the next step and grow as people.\n\nAitor, Diego, and Roberto’s story is of three friends who decided to create “the most normal trainers in the world” and, at the same time, make something unique and extraordinary. Do you want to get to know their project?\n\nTogether with jockey Julia Zambudio, we visit the Hipódromo de la Zarzuela in Madrid. During the tour, this girl tells us what it's like to live among horses: looking after, training and riding them!\n\nHave you ever stopped to think about the font you choose to write with and what it expresses? Laura Meseguer asked herself this question as a child and, over time, typeface design has become her life.\n\nThe Festival Eñe Talento a bordo Award has been granted to Catalan writer Pol Guasch. With two poetry collections and one novel under his belt, the jury has highlighted the maturity of his gaze and his experimental audacity.\n\nMaría and Javier took the leap from design to public art with murals that have taken them to several cities around the world. Creations that, under the umbrella of Reskate Studio, seek to attract the public gaze and awaken consciences.\n\nHe will go down in history for being the first artist to sell a work of art in NFT (Non-Refundable Token) format at ARCO, for founding the incomparable Harddiskmuseum, and for interpreting art as an intangible concept of infinite resources.\n\nSeeing the world through the eyes of others, even a murderer, allows us to check ourselves. This is the journey writer Mónica Rouanet takes the reader on in her latest work: ‘Nada importante’.\n\nBeing an illustrator means more than drawing well, it means conveying an idea or telling a story in the simplest and most direct way possible. This goes beyond style, technique, or aesthetics, according to Del Hambre.\n\nXoel López had to travel far, really far, to find himself again. The result of this journey was ‘Atlántico’, an album that few understood but that today, coinciding with its tenth anniversary, stands unscathed.\n\nThis golfer from Extremadura reaches the Open de España after a season where he came fourth at the Omega European Masters and ninth at the Italian Open. His goal? Qualifying for the final in Dubai, playing the British Open in 2023 and, above all, continuing to enjoy a sport he’s passionate about.\n\nEach person chases their dreams in their own way, some take it step by step while others go by leaps and bounds. This is the case of actor and dancer Dani Tatay, currently playing the lead role in ‘Dirty Dancing’.\n\nDesign found Antoni Arola, and not the other way around. He saw the light and started creating inspired by it until becoming one of the most relevant designers in the world. Usefulness, yes, but also beauty and essence are the keys to his work.\n\nThe life of chef David García didn’t point towards the stove, but rather towards the stage. Somehow, fickle destiny ended up combining the two when he came to Corral de la Morería, where cuisine and flamenco equally coexist and excite its audience.\n\nAlbert Espinosa’s life hasn’t been easy, but he regards it with optimism —realism, in his own words— and refuses to give up. His philosophy, captured in his books and films, has turned him into a role model for thousands of people.\n\nIn 2001, Pau Gasol landed in Memphis at the tender age of 21. The rest is history... Two decades later, and one year younger, Santi Aldama does it again, proving his talent during his debut in the NBA.\n\nMarina Anaya’s is a universe full of colour and feeling, a world in which figures and tones transmit strength and optimism in abundance. The works of this artist touch are ‘born’ with a common spirit: the search for beauty, for positivity, for the most “beautiful and friendly” part, in her own words, of life.\n\n'Tad the Lost Explorer and The Curse of the Mummy' is out in cinemas on the 26th of August. Before its première, we chat to Enrique Gato, its director and the person who best knows the world of animation in Spain.\n\nThe blood of winners, of competitors, of cyclists, courses through the veins of Carlos and Raúl García Pierna. Both brothers have always dreamt of rubbing shoulders with the best. Getting to do it together is a feeling shared by few. Today, more than ever, they’re on the path to achieving this.\n\nShe always wanted to be an artist but didn’t always know how. Until they found her. At the last Málaga Film Festival, Lupe de la Vallina and her camera immortalised a tidy sum of the Spanish ‘star system’. 80 portraits to add to her collection.\n\nTime ago, Dani García had a dream: to achieve three Michelin stars and belong to that select club. With passion and a lot of hard work, his Dani García Restaurant (Marbella) made it. A year after reaching that goal, he took a drastic but thoughtful decision which surprised many: he closed its doors.\n\nAt the young age of 25, Aleix Megías had already been through the European Space Agency and founded his own company: Open Cosmos. Today we get to know this young prodigy who attributes everything to passion, hard work, and... luck.\n\nIt seems that Santiago Segura has one purpose in life, to make people laugh. And he’s been hell-bent on it since 1998, when ‘Torrente, the Dumb Arm of the Law’ came out. Now, he’s back on the big screen with ‘Father There Is Only One 3’.\n\nThe Spanish film industry has a new rising star, and indeed, as is becoming the norm in recent times, it’s a woman: Alauda Ruiz de Azúa. According to Pedro Almodóvar, 'Lullaby' (original title: 'Cinco lobitos') is “the best debut in years”.\n\nHis particular way of perceiving space has turned Juan Baraja into one of the leading photographers of contemporary architecture. Within the framework of PHotoESPAÑA, he presents 'Against All That Glitters: Effects of Time'.\n\nIf the Internet shook up our world, how overarching could the impact of the metaverse be? Edgar Martín-Blas, one of the leading experts on the metaverse in Spain, answers this question and invites us to join the expedition.\n\n‘Liternature’, described by Gabi Martínez as that literature that seeks to re-establish that missing dialogue between humans and all other living things, can change the course of our lives forever: discovering an unknown self in faraway destinations, or getting to know ourselves better by following animal tracks. Writer Gabi Martínez tells us about this.\n\nThe writer returns to the Madrid Book Fair with ‘Lo demás es aire’, a novel set in the small Cantabrian village of his childhood. The lives of its inhabitants - and that of the author himself - intermingle in a work that combines reality and fiction, and in which time meanders through four centuries of history.\n\nHe’s considered the best Chilean actor of all time, but... what lies behind his talent? Performing without acting. That’s the key, according to Alfredo Castro, winner of the Platino Award for Best Supporting Actor for the second year running.\n\nDani Rincón and Ariana Geerlings are two of the rising stars within Spanish tennis who train at Rafa Nadal Academy, a place where the values of this tennis player from Manacor can be felt with every step. And every stroke.\n\nTo design pieces that stand the test of time and have the capacity to transform in its wake. This is the sustainable motto of Corsicana, a brand that doesn’t believe in traditional collections, rather in fashion chapters that tell a story.\n\nShe doesn’t perform miracles, although it may seem like it. Her scientific talent is at the service of human beings. Thanks to robotics, researcher Elena Gª Armada has managed to bring the possibility of walking closer to many children.\n\nMarina Núñez traded her paintbrushes for a mouse, and oil painting for software. Perseverance has always been her greatest ally, and she demonstrates this even today, with more than two decades of experience under her belt, while she retouches some of the hundreds of stills per minute that make up her videos.\n\nWoman, winter sport and success. Few, very few, can feel represented by these three words in a country like Spain and one of them is Queralt Castellet. A ‘rara avis’ that faced a challenge: the Beijing Games.\n\nAfter appearing in just two films, 'The Good Boss' and 'The Grandmother', Almudena Amor has dazzled both critics and audience with her mysterious and magnetic charisma. A love at first sight that’s been missing from Spanish cinema for some time.\n\nThe figure of Paula Badosa rises, after her exceptional end of the season in 2021 and with the permission of Garbiñe Muguruza, as the benchmark that Spanish women's tennis has been yearning for for years.\n\nHaze is the voice of the streets and his lyrics force us to look closely at a reality to which we often prefer to turn our backs. 'Carne de cañón', his next album, is not going to leave us that choice.\n\nWe speak to Pau Gasol about the première of his documentary It’s about the journey. At a key moment in his career, he tells us how his leitmotif (“always enjoy the present”) has guided a career full of success on and off the court.\n\nMulti-award-winning visual artist Almudena Romero is able to combine art and environment through photo printing. We talk to her about sustainable and fleeting photography and how it impacts the way we understand ourselves and express ourselves within the world.\n\nEneko Atxa is one of the most award-winning Spanish chefs within Spain and abroad: five Michelin stars, Best Restaurant in Europe, and Best Chef under 40, among other awards. Innovation and sustainability are part of his DNA to achieve culinary excellence.\n\nThrough their art gallery, WE COLLECT, Enrique del Río and Amaia de Meñaka tell us how to discover the artists who will become the great masters of the future, and how to promote smart collecting.\n\nThere are few vantage points as privileged to get a feel for the talent of a country than being the creative director of an advertising agency. Toni Segarra, an indisputable guru within the sector, believes that we’re at a critical juncture, where new structures capable of releasing and setting talent free are needed. In Spain, we have a certain advantage: “No one improvises like us”.\n\nWith her first attempt at novel writing, writer Ana Merino has become the new recipient of the 2020 Nadal Award for 'El mapa de los afectos', a portrait of America’s Midwest that captures today’s main social issues and in which references to Spain abound.\n\nMaría Lemús and Víctor Alonso make up one of fashion’s most ground-breaking duos. Turning knitwear into the sought-after fabric for trap rappers and modern artists is one of their successes. Another, the fact that their production comes from a cloistered convent.\n\nThe writer brings back the crime of child killer Aurora Rodríguez Carballaira in ‘La madre de Frankenstein’, the new instalment of her series dedicated to the post-war era where the reader is submerged into the suffocating and chauvinistic Spain of the 1950s.\n\nBecause of her experience, market vision and knowledge, Almudena Heredero has played a part in the necessary renewal that the Spanish music industry has undergone over the past ten years. Among the changes are, of course, women’s fight to gain visibility and equality. We chatted with her.\n\nShe conceived ARCO, as well as many of the great contemporary art exhibitions that have been shown in Spain over the years, from Sol Lewitt to David Hockney to Andy Warhol. We are talking about Juana de Aizpuru, a gallery owner and art collector —regarded today as an iconic figure in Spanish culture — who, in the midst of the political transition, endeavoured to introduce Spain into the international art scene.\n\nBased in Valencia and Barcelona, ​​the Espai Tactel art gallery has worked as a platform for avant-garde contemporary art since 2013. Among their proposals, which in recent years have been showcased in the world’s most important art fairs, are 3D installations, net narrative, and digital art.\n\nHe is Spain’s most internationally renowned interior designer. His work is known and sought-after in many countries, including the United States, China, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal. Lorenzo Castillo leads a team of eight people carrying out comprehensive projects ranging from architecture of spaces to the last decorative detail.\n\nWork and creativity are the ingredients that are never missing in Adriana Chía’s cocktails. This formula has made her a bartending leader worldwide. Now she’s adding her facet as an entrepreneur and her life as a mother to the mix.\n\nShe has shaken up the concept of communication in the social media world using Instagram, where she has more than 655 thousand followers, as a tool to share her point of view. You could say that Isabelita Virtual is the opposite of what we know as an influencer, although the impact of her work and creative universe extends far beyond that.\n\nImmersed in an endless promotional tour, amidst talks and interviews, we stole some valuable time from writer Irene Vallejo, author of El infinito en un junco [The infinite in a Reed], to chat about the pleasure of knowledge, reading and the art of lending books, the best way, according to her, to get rid of them.\n\nSince 1882, tradition and high cuisine meet on the stoves of Asturian restaurant Casa Gerardo. These days, Marcos Morán is responsible for the menu, alongside his father—a family tradition that goes back five generations, and one that has earned them, among many other achievements, a Michelin star.\n\nCarla Suárez, one of the standard bearers of Spanish women's tennis of the past few years, will say goodbye to the courts at the end of the season. Her next move? To put herself at the service of the national team, starting on 7 and 8 February at the Fed Cup tie against Japan.\n\nThe exactitude of classic tailoring brought forth to our time is the proposal that Duarte has used to strike a chord with new generations. Impeccable patterns that work with padded waistcoats or sandals. These are the codes of the renewed wardrobe icons we have seen during his show at MBFWMadrid.\n\nVega Hernando, best known as Eating Patterns, has turned the kitsch movement, graphic surrealism and food into the three pillars of her photography. With a crowd of followers on Instagram, this designer and art director publishes her first book about recipes and patterns in March.\n\nTaking the decision to launch internationally saved them from the recession. Today, their brand The 2nd Skin Co. is one of celebrities’ favourites around the world. This February, they’ll return to IFEMA to Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Madrid to conquer the runway with their unique feminine charm full of character.\n\nThe fashion house is embarking on a new cycle led by designer Jorge Vázquez, who shares with Pertegaz a taste for bourgeoise fashion and an almost obsessive attention to detail. These are the guidelines of the new Pertegaz, which will make its debut at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Madrid.\n\nHe’s as likely to make music for a fight between virtual warriors as a futurist adventure or a battle set during World War II. A forerunner on the other side of the pond, Eduardo de la Iglesia, from Madrid, talks to Talento a bordo about one of the most creative and unknown jobs of our time: making soundtracks for video games.\n\nAlthough the saying goes “A prophet is not without honour save in his own country”, chef Ricard Camarena fully contradicts this statement. His restaurant in Valencia has not only consolidated his second Michelin Star, but has raised him up to the top of international gastronomy.\n\nKnown for his language in black and white and his visual metaphors, photographer Chema Madoz has been turning everyday objects into open-ended questions since the 80s. His exhibition ‘La naturaleza de las cosas’ [The nature of things] can be seen at the Botanical Gardens in Madrid until March 1.\n\nHaving more caps than any of his Hispanos teammates does not mean Raúl Entrerríos is any less eager to play. The captain of the Spanish men’s handball team is starting the European Championship with the same passion as ever: trying to keep the cup in Spain, where it has been since 2016, and at the same time earning a ticket for what, should he succeed, will be his final big tournament: this year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo.\n\nThe first woman in Spain to be named Master of Wine represents a new generation of winemakers who preserve the legacy of the past while working on the challenges that wineries will face in the future, the main one being the adaptation of grapes to climate change.\n\nGreta Fernández is the breakthrough actor of 2019, after winning the Concha de Plata Award at the San Sebastian Festival and being nominated for the Goya Award for her leading role in ‘A Thief’s Daughter’. Daughter of writer Esmeralda Berbel and actor Eduard Fernández, with whom she shares credits on the film, it was obvious that math wasn’t going to be her thing.\n\nThe Valencia-born designer claims there is life for fashion beyond aesthetics. A good example is to be found in her collections, which draw from the present to send a message of social transformation.\n\nIn the last four years, rapper Kase.O has taken Spanish hip-hop to the top. The proof: over 20,000 copies sold of the album ‘El círculo’, a triumphal tour of Spain and Latin America, and several awards and nominations.\n\nSettled under the goalposts of Spain’s national football team, Kepa Arrizabalaga is preparing for his first big challenge as La Roja’s goalkeeper: Euro 2020. The Basque goalie doesn’t shy away from our questions and clears each of the topics we bring up, from his feelings towards the tournament to his life in London, with the same confidence as he shows under the goalposts of his club and the national team.\n\nMadrid illustrator Fernando Vicente is a household name in Spanish illustration, with a career spanning several decades. Winner of three Awards of Excellence from the Society for News Design, his latest effort is a tribute to New York City through some of the icons that are part of our collective imagination when it comes to The Big Apple.\n\nHe started out dancing when he was a kid. And even though it hasn’t been an easy ride for him, Rubén Olmo can be proud of having reached the top, becoming the new the director of the Spanish National Ballet.\n\nAgustín Fernández Mallo has been translated into more than ten languages, which is clear evidence of the relevance of his work. Last year he published two new major books: the novel 'War Trilogy', which won the Premio Biblioteca Breve, and the essay 'Teoría general de la basura' (General Theory of Rubbish: Culture, Appropriation, Complexity), a fiction book and a non-fiction book respectively in which Mallo, a flag bearer of the Nocilla Generation, expresses his personal vision of history.\n\nThere are poets whose existence protects us from the vanities of literature and reconciles us with the troubles of life. One such poet is the winner of the latest Miguel de Cervantes Prize, Catalan writer and architect Joan Margarit (Segarra, 1938), author of such important books as ‘Joana’, ‘Cálculo de estructuras’, ‘Casa de Misericordia’ or ‘Se pierde la señal’.\n\nWe chat to poet and writer Elvira Sastre about the current literary scene and how she has made writing her way of life. We also cover her latest project, the performance ‘Desordenados’ [Disorganised], which brings protest songs and poetry back on stage.\n\nShe was one of the first to apply porcelain to jewellery. Not long after, she did the same with wood. Now, many of the pieces made by Helena Rohner are 3D printed. A new craftwork era for an entire industry that the designer unfolds first-hand.\n\nIn the last few years, Raül Refree has become one of the most important and international producers in the Spanish music scene. His name is linked to the new flamenco cultivated by Silvia Pérez Cruz, Rocío Márquez or Rosalía, but is also connected to records by Mala Rodríguez, Albert Pla, Josele Santiago, Kiko Veneno, and now also Rodrigo Cuevas’ awaited new album.\n\nThe actress is premiering the second part of the film adaptation of 'The Baztán Trilogy', by Dolores Redondo. 'The Legacy of the Bones' is darker than the more complex first instalment of the saga, and the leading character —Inspector Amaia Salazar— shares with the woman who plays her much more than a magnetic and expressive face.\n\nCurrently immersed in the World Cup, the Spain national handball team, fondly nicknamed 'Las Guerreras' (Warriors), want to continue making history after a few years in which they have established themselves among the most powerful teams in handball. To obtain their Tokyo Olympics ticket, they’re counting on Alexandrina \"Shandy\" Barbosa, who is back on the court after becoming a mother.\n\nAndrés Rábago wanders around discretely hidden behind the pseudonym El Roto: for many, the most clearheaded portrait painter in current society. Today, the illustrator is featured in the Museo Nacional del Prado with ‘One Cannot Watch’: a splendid exhibition inspired by the illustrations of Francisco de Goya.\n\nPhotography, film, painting, literature or theatre. A tireless worker, Carlos Saura doesn’t distinguish between artistic disciplines. These days, his name is clearly displayed in an exhibition dedicated to him by the Círculo de Bellas Artes, where this genius reveals his facet as a master of images.\n\nThree Michelin stars aren’t enough for Spain’s most popular cook. On the verge of opening his third StreetXo, in Dubai, Daviz confesses he’s hungry like a shark—always looking for his next prey. The chef’s secret? Surrounding himself with talented people and applying his own with iron discipline. There will be plenty of time to relax later.\n\nFerrán Adriá, Paco Roncero, Dabiz Muñoz… Many of the biggest Spanish chefs show their haute cuisine creations on crockery made by Pedro León. We met this artisan (this is what he considers himself) in his authentic workshop in Madrid to talk about his pieces, the raku technique and the growing interest in this millenary art from the world of gastronomy.\n\nIn a few months, Miren Arzalluz, the Spaniard at the helm of Paris’s fashion museum, will live a most decisive moment. The museum, currently undergoing renovation, will reopen its doors with new exhibition halls, a retrospective on Coco Chanel, and the presentation of the new permanent collection.\n\nGabriel Olivares is the man behind one of the greatest theatre hits in recent years, a stage wizard for whom directing a play consists in “caring for and enhancing talent.” The director of the famed play 'Burundanga', he currently has three other plays running in Madrid while at the same time kicking off El Gallinero, a space for creation, rehearsal and performance, an Arcadia in the heart of Carabanchel.\n\nCapturing reality with an almost painterly sensibility is part of Recuenco’s brilliance. Now, this photographer from Madrid explores his most personal universe from several angles. A compilation of one thousand and one photographs and a series are his proposal against the culture of immediacy, conformity and lack of freedom\n\nOver the past three decades, Spain has established itself as one of the great powers in tennis producing a string of talented players. Bruguera and Sánchez-Vicario were followed by Ferrero and Moyá, among others, and after them came Nadal, Muguruza and company. But what about the future? Many already point to young Nicola Kuhn as the next flag bearer of the new generations.\n\nHe chose tennis as a way of life. Perhaps he didn’t know it the first time he picked up a racket, but when Sergi Bruguera hit his first ball, his talent for the sport became obvious. Now, as Spain captain for the Davis Cup, the great standard bearer of Spanish tennis in the nineties looks at his successful past and, above all, the present and future of this sport in our country.\n\nThis is her year, even though it seems that the last few years of Spanish cinema are also hers.
