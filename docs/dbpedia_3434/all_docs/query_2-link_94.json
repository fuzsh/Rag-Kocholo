        "text": "[Links to pdf versions in English, French, and Spanish]\n\nINTERNATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL UNION COMMISSION ON GENDER AND GEOGRAPHY\n\nNEWSLETTER 64 NOVEMBER, 2020\n\nMessage from the Chair\n\nStepping up to the position of Chair in a long line of inspiring leadership is a huge honour. I also see it as an opportunity to give back to this community of feminist geographers. I thank our previous Chair Lynda Johnston for her warm support and elegant leadership. Thanks also to earlier Chairs and past and present members of the Steering Committee from whom I have received much support and encouragement.\n\nAs part of the Commission’s activities I am pleased to report the following three international conferences organised by our members and endorsed by our Commission.\n\n• Specialist session: Gender and feminist geographies: Developments, directions and tensions at the New Zealand Geographical Society Conference 2020 organized by Prof Lynda Johnston and co-sponsored by The New Zealand Geographical Society (NZGS) Women and Gender Geographies Study Group; The Women and Gender Geographies Research Network (WGGRN); The IGU Gender and Geography Commission Young or Emerging Scholars (YES)! together with IGU Gender and Geography Commission.\n\n• 4th International Congress on Gender and Space , to be held between 19th and 23rd April 2021, on the Virtual Platform of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (National Autonomous University of Mexico). This meeting is organized by Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (National Autonomous University of Mexico), Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (Metropolitan Autonomous of Mexico University) , Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México (Autonomous University of Mexico State) and Universidad Veracruzana (Veracruzana University). Steering Committee Member Prof Joseli Maria Silva is involved in supporting this conference.\n\n• The V Latin American Seminar on Geography, Gender and Sexualities to be held in Santiago, Chile at Chile University from 7th to 10th September 2021. It will be organized by Martin Ignacio Torres Rodriguez. This conference too will have the active involvement of our Steering Committee Member Prof Joseli Maria Silva.\n\nThe Commission has also put in place plans to honour the contributions of Professor Janice Monk to gender and feminist geography. These include the following:\n\n• The Jan Monk Mentorship programme: In honour of the ways Jan has supported so many of us, this program is meant for early career researchers and feminist geographers from under represented regions.\n\n• Festschrift in honour of Jan Monk to be published in 2022: This volume will also commemorate thirty years of full commission status for the IGU Commission on Gender and Geography. The CFP for this festschrift has already been shared on our listserve and is also available on our website. • Other initiatives such as special sessions named after her at annual meetings and joint sponsorship of such sessions at other meetings are being discussed.\n\nAs before, we are thankful to Dr Caroline Faria for keeping our web page refreshed and up to date. Please visit us at https://igugender.wixsite.com/igugender . We also have a twitter handle now @IgUgender. Please follow, tag, share your thoughts, achievements and ideas with us on this.\n\nThe last months have been challenging as the pandemic has impacted our taken for granted freedoms, deepened fissures in our societies and demonstrated irrevocably that we cannot ride this out unless we do it together. Across the world, feminist leadership has shown the way and underlined our focal theme ‘Care, connection and change’.\n\nIn solidarity and with good wishes to everyone!\n\nAnindita\n\nNew Steering Committee\n\nChair: Anindita Datta, India\n\nTreasurer: Ann Oberhauser, USA\n\nMembers:\n\nSybille Bauriedl, Germany\n\nMarianne Blidon, France\n\nMartina Caretta, USA\n\nMaria Prats Ferret, Spain\n\nMary Njeri Kinyanjui, Kenya\n\nJoseli Maria Silva, Brazil\n\nYvonne Underhill-Sem, New Zealand\n\nElena Vacchelli, UK\n\nYoko Yoshida, Japan\n\nWarm thanks to the former chair and steering committee members:\n\nLynda Johnston, New Zealand\n\nOrna Blumen, Israel\n\nLinda Peake, Canada\n\nAnke Strüver, Germany\n\nNews from around the world\n\nCongratulations for Linda Peake who received the Award For Scholarly Distinction In Geography 2020 of the Canadian Association of Geographers.

It was organized by Astrid Ulloa (Universidad Nacional de Colombia), Diana Ojeda (Universidad de los Andes) and Luna Cárdenas (Colectivo de Género Francia Márquez) on 16th and 17th September 2020.

Twenty-one feminist researchers from several countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru took part in it. During the meeting, specificities of the Latin American feminist geographies were addressed.

During our first online meeting on 25 June 2020, we discussed how to better support each other during the current period of pandemic. We also drafted a statement of solidarity that you can read on theYES! blogpage.\n\nIn June we also canvased for volunteers to help with various new projects and to serve as members on the YES! Committee.YES! is very excited to report a new committee member, Anjeline De Dios who is based at the Department of Cultural Studies in Lingnan University, Hong Kong. To read more about Anjeline and other members of the committee, please visit theYES! Committee page here: https://igugender.wixsite.com/igugender/yes-committee.\n\nSince June, we have met two more times in August and September to discuss fieldwork ethics during the time of pandemic, and gender, marriage and patriarchyin theAsiancontext based on the Netflix series ‘Indian Matchmaking’. To read the statement of solidarity and reflections by the facilitators of the two subsequent sessions please visit theYES! blog page at: https://igugender.wixsite.com/igugender/yes-blogs\n\nYES! is currently in the process of migrating to our own Wix website that will remain connected to the main IGU Gender Website via URL links and will be similar in terms of the overall look and feel (i.e. colour, logo etc.) of the current IGU Gender Commission website.The reason for moving to a separate site, is to allow YES! to populate more pages withYES! specific content.These include write-ups linked to our monthly webinars and also additional content provided by YES! Members. This requires more storage space, and hence the decision to create our own website.\n\nA second project that YES! Is currently working on is our podcast series.We have recorded two interviews so far – one with outgoing Chair of the commission, Lynda Johnston and the other with the current Chair, Anindita Datta. The podcasts are currently in the production phase and are likely to be published in November. YES! will send out an email to the wider IGU Gender Commission list as soon as the podcast is ready for listening. YES! has plans for more podcasts and we hope you will show us your support when we reach out to you. The podcast will serve as a way to document the IGU Gender Commission’s journey over the years.\n\nThe next YES! webinar takes place on 19 November at 19:00 Singapore Time (11:00 GMT).We’ll be discussing the value and challenges of developing a feminist voice/philosophy when writing research and teaching statements. If you are an early career feminist scholar and would like to attend the webinar, or learn more about YES! please get in touch with us at yescggigu.website@gmail.com for more details.\n\nSpecial journal issues\n\nHuman Geography (2020, 13:1) published a special issue on “Women’s resistance against the extractive industry: embodied and water dimensions”, edited by Martina Angela Caretta and Sofia Zaragocin, with the following contributions:\n\nCaretta, Martina Angela and Sofia Zaragocin (2020)Women’s resistance against the extractive\n\nindustry: embodied and water dimensions, Human Geography, 13:1, 3-5.\n\nUlloa, Astrid (2020) The rights of the Wayúu people and water in the context of mining in La Guajira, Colombia: demands of relational water justice, Human Geography,13:1, 6-15.\n\nBillo, Emily (2020) Patriarchy and progressive politics: gendered resistance to mining through everyday social relations of state formation in Intag, Ecuador, Human Geography, 13:1, 16-26.\n\nRodriguez Fernandez, Gisela V.
