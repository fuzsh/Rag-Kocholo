Sign up below to become a member of Hey Girl Nation, and bring a few friends along with you.

Hey Girl Nation is important to me because it shows the value of keeping your identity in Jesus. So many of us go through life putting our identity in what other people think and say about us, and it’s exhausting. One of my friends changed my life in seventh grade. She said to me, “Anne you are precious in the eyes of God. You are His precious daughter.” This truth blew me away. Hey Girl Nation was created to remind you that you were made in the image of God. Let that truth guide you!
