        "text": "Ghost Girl, also known as Dress Girl is an entity in Lethal Company. She will haunt one employee at a time and be invisible to everyone but the employee she's haunting, first appearing at a distance before eventually approaching and killing them through instant decapitation.\n\nShe normally attacks the employee that has the highest insanity level.\n\nIf viewed from a moderate distance away, she can appear as a flat image. This entity is undetected by the players scanner and thus does not have a journal entry in the Bestiary.\n\nBestiary[]\n\nThere is no bestiary file for this entity.\n\nOccurrence[]\n\nMoon Spawn Chance 85-Rend 4.95% 8-Titan 3.08% 68-Artifice 3.08% 7-Dine 2.04% 20-Adamance 0.55% 41-Experimentation 0.44% 220-Assurance 0.31%\n\nUnreleased Moons Spawn Chance 44-Liquidation 5.24%\n\nBehavior[]\n\nA simplified explanation for the logic of her behavior is that she is akin to a game of Hide and Seek, in which the targeted employee is the seeker, not the hider. Once engaged (the target looks at or approaches her), there is a chance she will start chasing them. She has 5 distinct behaviors/stages: \"Absent\", \"Staring\", \"Disappearing\", \"Vanishing\", and \"Chasing\".\n\nAbsent[]\n\nThe ghost girl begins in this state. She waits for 20 seconds, then attempts to select a spot to appear, repeatedly trying every 4 seconds. If the target player is in the facility, she will pick a spot in the facility. If they are in the ship, she will pick a spot on the surface. If they are outside the ship and facility, she will fail to appear. She will select AI navigation nodes with a clear line of sight between the target and her, but not within 8 units of the target, and not in the target's view: the target must either be looking more than 80 degrees away from the spot, or be more than 100 units away, or certain nonsolid foliage materials may break the line of sight for this check while not being considered for the previous line of sight check. This means that if the target player is in the ship and there's a shelf, a terminal, or even a shower (excluding the bunk bed) blocking the line of sight between them and the entrance, she will never appear, because no valid locations have line of sight to her. This is because the shower is internally treated as a material that blocks line of sight for the AIs, and she must choose a spot in line of sight to her target. Once she successfully selects a spot, she will switch to the Staring state.\n\nStaring[]\n\nIn this state, she motionlessly rotates to face her target, and a heartbeat sound plays if they are looking at her. The target player is considered to be looking at her if they have an unbroken line of sight to her (foliage materials matter), and are either within 5 units of her and facing any direction or are within 100 units of her and facing within 60 degrees of her direction. She keeps an internal timer, which lasts 15 seconds when she is indoors, or 25 seconds when she is outdoors. When the timer runs out, she will switch to the Disappearing state. The timer runs at 3x speed when the player is out of line of sight (foliage materials don't matter), and 1.25x speed when the player is looking at her (if she doesn't start to chase).\n\nQuickly looking away does not help; She does not count how long her target looks at her. She is only counting how many stares in which she was seen, and how many in which she was not seen. When looked at, if she has had at least 3 or 4 stares in which she was seen (3 or 4 is randomly selected with 50% chance), or at least 3 stares in which she was not seen, she has an 85% chance to go into the Chasing state. This is only rolled once per stare.\n\nAdditionally, if the target player moves within 7 units of her, and she has 1 or less stares in which she was seen, she has a 25% chance to go into the Disappearing state (only rolled once per staring). If she doesn't switch states and the target gets within a range of 5 units, and she has 2 or more stares in which she was looked at (including this one, because getting within 5 units counts as looking at her) then she will roll a second independent 64% chance to go into the Chasing state, on top of the 85% chance, if it occurs. If she doesn't begin to chase when her target moves within 5 units of her, she will switch to the Vanishing state. Additionally, if a non-targeted player touches her in this state, she will switch to the Vanishing state.\n\nDisappearing[]\n\nIn this state, the ghost girl tries to \"walk offscreen\". She selects an out of sight spot, and walks to it. The moment she gets out of line of sight to the player (foliage materials don't matter), or within 4 units of the target player, or within 0.2 units of her destination, she becomes invisible and switches back to the Absent state. If a non-target player touches her in this state, or if she fails to select a spot, she will switch to the Vanishing state.\n\nShe selects a spot by casting a ray up to 8 units to her right, and checking if it makes contact with a surface. If the spot of contact is out of line of sight to the targeted player (foliage materials don't matter), and brings her at most 1 unit closer to the targeted player, she will select the nearest AI navigation node to that point. Otherwise, she tries again by casting a ray diagonally to her back-right, then to her back, etc. for all 8 directions around her. If none of the 8 rays work, she checks each AI navigation node within a 7 unit sphere of her, and drops the \"at most 1 unit closer\" requirement. If none of these are valid either, she fails to select a spot.\n\nVanishing[]\n\nIn this state, she immediately turns invisible and switches to the Absent state, but makes lights and flashlights flicker for a short time afterward.\n\nChasing[]\n\nIn this state, she hops towards the target player, and if she touches them, they die. The chase lasts 20 seconds, or until the target player moves more than 50 units away from her. When it ends, she will return to the Absent state. Every 5 seconds, if the player is not looking at her (foliage matters, must be within 100 units and facing within 70 degrees of her direction, or within 10 units and facing any direction), she will try to teleport by using the code from the Absent state to select a location, but this time allowing locations that have no line of sight to the target player. Because it uses the same code, if she is unseen and then tries to select a location and fails, it will make the next Absent state skip its 20 second timer, so the ghost girl will reappear in its staring state sooner next time. If her target dies, she will select a new target, and the new target will have its own separate counters and timers and states for her, so she will be in the Absent state again with 0 stares in which she was seen or unseen.\n\nStrategy[]\n\nThere are distinct signs indicating that the ghost girl has set her sights on someone:\n\nLights or terminal flickering\n\nGiggling or heavy breathing\n\nHearing becoming muffled or difficult to perceive\n\nHearing the faint chime(s) of a grandfather clock\n\nShe does not immediately move in for the kill; instead, she appears to \"indulge\" in a period of haunting and toying with her victim, singling out one employee to haunt. When she starts skipping towards her target, this signals the beginning of her chasing phase, where contact with her will result in instant death. While not exceptionally fast, evading her is critical. If burdened with excess loot, consider dropping it to enhance chances of survival.\n\nUnlike the jester popping, the ghost girl haunting an employee does not necessarily mean the end of a run. However, this comes at the cost of that employee having to divert their attention from the compound. She can haunt players in all areas of the map, including the ship, and may appear on a ship's monitor cameras, dancing.\n\nHandling different behaviors[]\n\nBelow is an extension to her behavior which gives more information on how to handle her. The information provided may be confusing if the behavior section was not read.\n\nIf You Are Haunted[]\n\nConsider manning the ship and building a wall of objects that blocks line of sight to the door, but not necessarily blocking the door, a maze-like or zig-zag system of placeable objects is sufficient.\n\nAn alternative is always stare at the ship entrance to prevent her from spawning, as she can't spawn behind you because there's not enough space in the ship.\n\nAnother alternative is to never look at the ship entrance. She will still spawn if your back is facing the ship entrance, but as long as you don't turn to look at her, she will never chase you.\n\nIf you want to stop her from spawning while in the factory, hug a corner or even a wall and look at the room, as she is only able to spawn behind you.\n\nBe extra careful when expecting encounters with other entities who have line of sight as a mechanic, such as Brackens or Coil-Heads, as trying to move around while looking at them can naturally increase the chance of accidentally spotting the Ghost Girl as well.\n\nSee next topic for when you hear giggling, breathing, or distorted noises to find out more about what to do.\n\nChase Avoidance[]\n\nThis section provides information on how to completely avoid her from chasing you.[1]\n\nIf you hear her spawn, indicated by giggling or breathing noises:\n\nThe only rule you'll ever need is to NEVER turn around, more specifically do not look at her (engage line of sight).\n\nLine of sight is equivalent to the Ghost Girl on your screen.\n\nThere may be a small margin off screen that counts as line of sight.\n\nA single glance is an immediate failure.\n\nA clear indicator if you've looked at her is when hear the distorted noise.\n\nYou can keep moving forward, left or right, but never turn around.\n\nYou can turn around if:\n\nThere's a wall between the both of you.\n\nShe has despawned, which is indicated by her no longer breathing.\n\nIf you don't hear anything behind you, it's not necessarily safe to turn around. If the hall behind you is long, there is a chance she'll spawn far enough away for you to not hear her noise.\n\nYou can safely look at her two times, including the initial spawn. Any further attempts have a chance to trigger a chase.\n\nIf you look at her just one time, and on a separate spawn move close to her, she may enter a chase. She is only safe to approach the very first time.\n\nIf you feel that you are also being stalked by a Bracken and must turn around to look at it, exercise caution and spatial awareness in order to minimize the chance of inadvertently looking at the girl. The same can be said for Coil-Heads.\n\nDo not go near her (distance of 5 unity units).\n\nDo not go backwards towards her; coming in contact with her is counted as spotting her.\n\nIn any moment you fail to follow any of these, she may start pursuing you or may just walk away. A clear indicator of failing the round of hide and seek is when you hear your audio distorted.\n\nFollowing this advice will change the girl from a highly dangerous entity, greater than a Jester, into a very minor inconvenience, such as a Hoarding Bug.\n\nIn The Event of Being Chased[]\n\nYou can end it by:\n\nRunning far away from her (> 50 units).\n\nYou can do this by entering or exiting the facility or being teleported by a teammate.\n\nPlaying time. If you have enough stamina, you should be able to keep running away from her until she disappears. Dropping heavy items is highly recommended.\n\nShe is completely unable to reach her target if they are crouching on top of the ship's cabinet. [2]\n\nShe may randomly teleport to different places to catch you off guard.\n\nTargeting[]\n\nThe ghost girl randomly targets a living employee using a points system based on several factors. Each employee's chance to be targeted is equal to their points divided by the total points of all living employees, times 100%. She continues haunting her target until they die, and then she immediately selects a new target.\n\nCondition Points Base Points 80 The employee has the highest insanity level (at least 1.0) +50 The employee that has turned their head the most (aka the most paranoid employee) +30 Employee is currently holding a scrap item worth more than 150 c +30 Employee has never been critically injured before +10\n\nInsanity Levels[]\n\nInsanity levels increase or decrease every in-game tick based on the employee's location and actions. Every employee starts with an insanity of 0 every day that can go up to 50 depending on a number of factors. While in space or on Gordion, the insanity level stays at 0. The insanity level calculation is different in single player and multiplayer. The main difference is the presence of other players, which decreases insanity. [3]\n\nIt is important to note, that the game goes through these conditions and only picks the first applicable.\n\nCondition Singleplayer Rate Multiplayer Rate Employee is alone in the facility +0.5 / s +0.8 / s Employee is alone in the ship +0.125 / s +0.2 / s Employee is alone outdoors (before 5:20 p.m.) -2.0 / s +0.3 / s Employee is alone outdoors (after 5:20 p.m.) -2.0 / s +0.5 / s Employee is within 7 units of another employee or a player body - -3.0 / s Employee is actively listening to other employees on the walkie talkie - -3.0 / s\n\nNotes[]\n\nApproaching the ghost girl while being haunted may cause her to temporarily disappear, but it is not advisable.\n\nThough only haunted players can directly see the Ghost Girl, she can be seen by all players on the ship's camera\n\nThe ghost girl is immune to all damage and can't be stunned.\n\nThe ghost girl, tulip snake, and masked are the only entities that can be both inside and outside the factory.\n\nQuiet vocalizations (such as a gentle “Hi” or \"Hey\") with no apparent source don't actually indicate being haunted. These are random sounds that just play as ambience.\n\nNearby lights will reactivate briefly and flicker during a haunting when there is no power in the facility.\n\nThe ghost girl and masked are the only entities that do not have a bestiary entry in the ship's terminal, because they cannot be scanned.\n\nContrary to the common myth, the shower does not cause the ghost girl to change her target. The reason this is believed is because the shower blocks line of sight from all angles, preventing the ghost girl from appearing behind her target\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIf an employee is killed by the ghost girl, they will be decapitated, with blood coming out of their neck for a few seconds after. This is merely cosmetic and does not serve any gameplay function asides from alerting the others that there is a ghost girl.\n\nAudio[]\n\nAudio Description https://lethal-company.fandom.com/wiki/File:Breathing.wav Audio of Ghost Girl in her staring state.
