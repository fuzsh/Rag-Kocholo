        "text": "Every XFX knows that Xiao Zhan first entered the entertainment industry by taking part in the idol competition reality show, X-Fire. But do you know about the training camp and all the elimination rounds he had to overcome in order to get on the show?\n\nTo give a brief overview, X-Fire casting directors searched all over the world, both domestically in China and abroad, for top candidates to participate and compete for debut spots. After several rounds of selection from more than 40,000 people, 16 trainees were selected to compete on the show.\n\nThe search began on April 2015, and it was divided into several regions—Xiao Zhan belonged to the southwest region. The search methods were mainly one of two categories: either by recommendation or via university search.\n\nRecommendations can be self-recommendations or being recommended by others. For self-recommendations, candidates must provide an introduction and performance video, which is then screened by the director in charge of selecting candidates. Those who were recommended by others were usually recommended by the industry. As far as we know, Yan XuJia and Guo Zifan, both with child star performance experiences, were recommended by the industry.\n\nWithin the university search teams, the program team used 40 full-time editors and directors and a number of part-time editors, who travelled to all the universities across the country for three months. “The members of the online team targeted forum websites such as Tianya, Maopu, Weibo, and Renren.com, and gave more than a dozen keywords such as ‘school grass’ and ‘campus singers’ to search repeatedly.” Zhao Hui said. “The program team also cooperated with foreign Chinese TV and radio stations, including BBS, where some international students gathered, and also go on Facebook and Twitter to find people.”\n\nThe university search was how they found Xiao Zhan and Gu JiaCheng. On May 5, 2015, X-Fire began their search in major colleges and universities in the southwest region. In June, the Chongqing Technology and Business University was searched. Thanks to the school teacher for remembering Xiao Zhan’s phone number, he gave the contact information to the casting director.\n\nThere is also an interesting story regarding the process to choosing Xiao Zhan. Because Xiao Zhan looks very similar to a staff member, the director team thought that it would be very interesting for the staff and Xiao Zhan to stand together like twins. It was also a pleasant surprise that Xiao Zhan’s overall character quality is very good and he is also very polite to people.\n\nIn the end, the “X-Fire” program group collected more than 10,000 short videos.\n\nAfter the search concluded, each region conducted several rounds of preliminary interviews, and selected the top 120. On July 2, 2015, 120 competitors gathered in Changsha for the final trainees selection, a total of two rounds—120 entered, 50 selected; 50 entered, 26 selected. On July 5, 2015, they announced the final selection results for 26 candidates.\n\nOn July 18, 2015, he along with the 26 candidates flew to Beijing and entered the IDG training camp.\n\nThere were three teams training the boys: dance teacher Kenn’s training school, the program director group and the teachers of SM Entertainment in Korea. Working in the training camp for more than 10 hours a day, analyzing each boy, writing reports, holding meetings, making training configurations for each boy’s progress and characteristics, and discovering the charm of each person. During this period, many test sessions were also set up: three days for a small test and 5 days for a big test, and further training adjustments will be made according to the test results.” Kenn concluded. “80% of them failed in three days. Except for a few boys who can dance, none of them have the habit of exercising and fitness, which shocked me. It turns out that the 90s generation don’t weight train nor do exercise!” So 3 days before the training started, the boys collapsed: I have muscle strain, effusion in the knees, muscle soreness, not adapting to the weather in Beijing, headache and fever, etc.\n\nDuring this time Xiao Zhan’s work ethics and warm character really left a deep impression on many teachers. Kenn, his former dance teacher, shared this about Xiao Zhan:"
