        "text": "Chapter Text\n\n\"She's late.\" Arthur Watts grumbled as his gloved fingers continuously tapped against the long table at which he was sat. His attitude was expected. He never liked her after all.\n\n\"She'll be here soon. Just give her some time.\" the beast of a man named Hazel Rainart replied. The man was as calm as usual, arms crossed and eyes closed, seemingly unbothered by the world of darkness that he currently resided in.\n\n\"Our little Maiden should hurry up anyways,\" the crazed voice of Tyrian Callows cut in, \"Her Grace has been running low on patience ever since she met our new friend.\"\n\nAll of the attention in the room shifted to Loki, the man dressed in green and gold who dared to sit closest to the Grimm Queen.\n\nThe God of Mischief smirked back at them, his head resting on his hand propped up by the table. He didnâ€™t say anything and just let his smile speak for itself. Mischief was at its peak when it was silent. He basked in double glares, trying and failing to drill into either side of his skull, one from the cheap, unfaithful copy of Anthony Stark and the other from his latest business partner.\n\nSalem despised her alliance with Loki. While the trickster had already proven himself useful through his abilities and knowledge, she couldn't deny that his power made her uneasy. She had grown to be quite comfortable in her seat on top of the food chain and the man who claimed to be a god held the potential to change that. His antics and general lack of respect also made him difficult to tolerate, even if she found some of his pranks somewhat amusing.\n\nThe only reason why Salem hadn't risked another battle against Loki is simply due to the value he held. He held knowledge of powers beyond Remnant's reach and had experience against the latest set of obstacles to her goal.\n\nThey hadn't spoken of the Avengers much with her followers. She simply gave them a general warning to be careful and to keep their eyes peeled. They hadn't heard the stories that Loki loved telling her. However, with their official debut in the former Kingdom of Mantle, Salem knew that all of Remnant would learn more and more about its new heroes over the coming weeks.\n\nAnd the more they learnt, the more she would learn.\n\nSuddenly, the simple, wooden, double doors leading into the Conference Hall were pushed open. On the other side stood not only the person that they had been expecting but two more.\n\nCinder Fall, dressed in her scarlet dress and glass heels, also wore her signature of monotone neutrality, which always fell apart far too easily. Her 'friends' on the other hand, their faces showed the same fear that most would experience while walking through the Land of Darkness and Evernight Castle for the first time.\n\nCinder placed her arm across her chest and bowed to Salem and only Salem.\n\n\"My Queen, I apologise for the delay. I believed it to be appropriate to take the time to collect my allies and bring them here. Recent developments have made leaving them alone... risky. I also apologise for not notifying you.\"\n\nSalem nodded, \"You are forgiven, Cinder. Take a seat and share these developments with us.\"\n\nCinder straightened herself and nodded. She then turned to her allies, one mint-haired Emerald Sustari and silver-haired Mercury Black.\"\n\nTyrian laughed, clapping his hands while his black stinger shook like the tail of an excited puppy, \"Oooh. More fresh meat. At this rate, we'll run out of chairs.\"\n\nEmerald visibly gulped, trying to avoid meeting everyone's gaze. Mercury appeared more put together but not even he could hide the sweat leaking from his forehead. Cinder silently ordered them to take seats opposite of each other at the end of the table, while she walked to her chair second nearest to Salem.\n\nAs soon as she sat down, Loki turned towards her, now choosing to use both hands as a platform for his head. He offered her a disarming smile, \"So, you must be the one I've been hearing so much about. Cinder Fall, our queen's precious 'Vessel for the Power of the Maidens'. And I can see that you already have some but it's clearly incomplete and unrefined. Utterly useless if you ask me and not at all worth the effort that you put in to get it.\"\n\nCinder glared at Loki. She had been notified of the newcomer, the Grimm Queen's supposed equal. She didn't like him. Not one bit.\n\nSalem raised her hand, \"That's enough, Loki. I personally do not care how these meetings are held where you come from but here, we are professional and treat our allies with proper respect.\"\n\nLoki's smile shifted to a smirk as he leaned back against his chair, \"Of course, because the crazy scorpion just screams professionalism.\"\n\nTyrian cackled at the comment. He slammed his arm against the table and pointed to Loki, \"I like you, Prankster. Every day, I like you a little more.\"\n\n\"Enough.\"\n\nSalem's voice boomed across the hall. The change was instantaneous. In just a moment, everyone's muscles stiffened. The room darkened just a little bit more and the sound of Grimm howling echoed faintly from a distance. No one dared to speak, not even Loki, but curiosity or boredom were more likely to be the culprit than genuine fear.\n\nThe slight smile said as much.\n\nSalem was quick to compose herself, masterfully reeling in the anger that she had momentarily released. It was a brief and calm storm, meant to only scare her subordinates and to put them in line. If she had truly been angry, someone would have been hurt.\n\nSalem glanced at the newcomers. Utterly terrified. They didn't even dare to look in her general direction. Good.\n\n\"Now that we are all here,\" Salem said calmly, \"Why don't we begin this meeting properly?\" Salem's head slowly turned to her favourite follower, \"Why don't you begin, Cinder? How has your time in Vale been? Why did you see it necessary to bring those two here?\"\n\nCinder offered her a slight bow before she began to speak. Her voice was low and collected, each word carefully thought out and not an ounce of air wasted.\n\n\"For some time now, Vale's criminal element has been experiencing some difficulties. Vigilantes and Hunters, rumoured to all be carrying the same peculiar 'A' on the shoulders of their suits...\" Loki's eyes widened while Salem's narrowed, \"...have been running around Vale's streets, asking questions and interfering with our operations there. I had encountered one of them recently. A young girl capable of manipulating hard light with seemingly no Dust.\"\n\n\"Did you eliminate her?\" Salem questioned, barely holding back a growl.\n\nCinder's eyes widened only for a brief moment. She composed herself quicker than you could blink before answering, \"No, unfortunately not. A Huntress, one of Ozpin's sheep, was also there. Torchwick and I had to prioritise escape.\"\n\nSalem sighed with disappointment while Loki simply chuckled to himself.\n\n\"Don't feel bad, Half-Witch,\" Loki said with a smirk, \"Even their most inexperienced are nearly impossible to kill.\"\n\nCinder had to suppress her annoyance and forced herself to speak calmly, \"I assume that she is also a member of these Avengers you mentioned. The same ones that stopped the Grimm Invasion in Mantle?\"\n\nLoki nodded. He quickly gathered himself but his childish excitement was not hidden, \"I believe her name is Ms Marvel. Apologies if I'm wrong; it's been a short while since I've last seen them, and she is their newest member as far as I'm aware. Only a few months on the team. Not even old enoughto be consideredan adult by your standards.\"\n\nTyrian laughed, \"Oh? So our little Maiden couldn't even kill one little kid? Oh, that's rich!\"\n\nArthur smirked, \"It is rather disappointing.\"\n\nHazel and Cinder's lackeys stayed silent.\n\n\"Enough.\" Salem immediately silenced all of them. \"If you recall, one of Ozpin's subordinates was also there and Cinder doesn't yet have the full power of the Fall Maiden. Therefore, her successful escape should be rewarded, not belittled.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my Queen.\"\n\nSalem took a breath, \"Now, Cinder, tell me more about the situation. What exactly have the Avengers been doing in Vale?\"\n\nThe room stiffened. The Avengers were an anomaly that most of the attendees only through the vague warnings that Salem gave them and their debut in Mantle. The footage from that event, the power held by only a fraction of its members, scared them, even if they would never admit it.\n\n\"They've been mostly running around the Kingdom dressed in the pyjamas stopping muggings and helping the community,\" the words in Cinder's mouth felt forced, like simply describing the use of power for the sake others made her sick, \"But there is a pair whose efforts have been far more... focused. An archer and a woman armed with electric batons. From what I've heard, they've begun to pull every string ever since my encounter with Ms Marvel. Based on the questions that they've been asking, they're looking for Torchwick and, by extension, me.\"\n\nSalem hummed, \"That is concerning.\"\n\nShe turned to Loki and asked, \"Loki, do you know who she is talking about?\"\n\n\"Clint Barton and Natasha Romanoff,\" Loki said fondly. \"Founding members of the Avengers. A deadly pair, for mortals at least. Between them, they probably know more ways to kill a person than every Huntsman and Huntress combined. Masters in espionage and assassination. If you know something that they want to know, you will tell them.\"\n\nLoki frowned suddenly as if remembering a very unhappy memory. Salem quickly picked up on this.\n\n'So he can slip up. Good to know.'\n\n\"That sounds like it could be a major problem,\" Salem commented.\n\nLoki nodded, \"Oh, it is. Trust me when I say that a common crook won't stay hidden from them for long. The Half-Witch was wise to bring her pets here. The agents wouldn't even have needed to raise a finger to make them bark.\"\n\n\"Should we halt our operations in Vale then?\" Hazel asked.\n\nLoki thought about it for a moment before shaking his head, \"Nah. That'll just tell them that they're on the right track. But I recommend keeping this Torchwick fellow away from the action and just increasing the security overall. Multiple drop points, fewer meetings, and more inconspicuous operations. If that doesn't work, then I'll take care of it.\"\n\n\"How exactly will you 'take care of it'?\" Cinder asked.\n\nLoki turned and smiled at her directly before twirling his finger around, creating a ring of green smoke which soon dissipated.\n\nThe meeting continued without too much trouble. As the dim light outside the castle faded, everyone shared their reports. Watts' report on Atlas' sudden increase in cyber security was concerning but they could deal with it. The overall takeaway from the meeting was that everyone had to be just a little bit more careful when fulfilling their respective mission.\n\nEveryone native to Remnant left the table understanding just a little more about the threat that these Avengers posed.\n\nTheir mere presence forced them to hide just a little further into the shadows.\n\nIt was... frustrating.\n\nAs everyone cleared out of the hall, Salem stood up from her chair. She turned to her partner, disappointed to see him slouched against his seat and with his eyes shut as if he was on some kind of vacation.\n\nShe sighed.\n\nShe was probably going to regret this.\n\n\"Loki,\" the trickster opened one of his eyes, \"I need you to come with me. There is... something that I would like you to see.\"\n\nThis caught his attention. He straightened his posture as he stood up, seamlessly picking up his sceptre which rested next to him.\n\n\"Well, what are we waiting for?\" he asked, \"Lead the way.\"\n\nSalem resisted the urge to roll her eyes. She turned her back to him and began to walk out of the room. She knew Loki was following her even if his footsteps didn't make a sound. That power, that foreign magic that he held within himself was difficult to miss.\n\nThey walked through the halls of her castle, walking deeper and deeper into the darkness that made up these lands. Through winding corridors and down countless flights of uneven stairs.\n\nThe deeper they went the more uneasy Loki began to feel.\n\nHe wasn't scared of Salem. Thor would cut his hair short sooner than Salem could ever scare Loki. He had survived far worse than her and he would continue to do so.\n\nBut this place, this land, it was fueled by an ancient power Loki didn't know anything about. It was a power that Salem seemed to only borrow despite her title. The soulless beasts that were her Grimm were more in tune with it than she ever would be.\n\nDarkness Incarnate was the best way that Loki could describe it. But it was different, even if only a little, from the darkness used by characters like Knull. He could feel this power running through every crevice of these Grimm Lands, weighing down on him, choking him.\n\nIf he tried to touch it with his own power, he felt an icy shiver that caused him to immediately retreat. An unusual sensation given his Frost Giant heritage.\n\nIt seemed that Salem had full, but limited, control over this darkness, and Loki wondered how much her power would grow if she succeeded in harnessing the full power of this darkness\n\nSoon, they were so deep in the castle that it seemed like the darkness was snuffling out any light that tried to shine with its domain. Even Loki's sceptre struggled to emit light that reached further than a few centimetres.\n\n\"You always speak about the powers that lie beyond Remnant. Gods more powerful than the two Brothers and artifacts that can ascend mortals to that same level of power.\" Salem said as they reached what appeared to be a dead end. But when Loki looked closer, he realised that the wall at the end of the dark tunnel was different from the stone that surrounded them.\n\nIt was pitch black and remained pitch black no matter how much faint light hit it. It was the same substance that made up the Grimm.\n\n\"Those talks reminded me of something. Something that I came across over a millennium ago.\"\n\nShe reached out and the substance immediately began to slither away. It squelched and moaned as it moved out of the way, revealing... a tiny metal cupboard with a tiny keyhole. Salem reached into one of her gown's pockets and pulled out an equally tiny key. With a faint magical glow, she inserted it into the keyhole and turned. What sounded like a complex mechanism moved inside for a solid minute before the tiny box popped out from the wall.\n\nSalem pulled the sealed box fully from the wall, and while cradling it like a wounded puppy, she offered it to Loki and asked, \"Could you perhaps tell me what this is?\"\n\nShe opened the box and Loki's eyes widened in shock as a familiar orange glow pierced through what he had to believed to be unmovable darkness. Yet, this light cut through it like butter because, of course, it would. Loki knew full well what these little gems could do.\n\nHe chuckled for a moment before, much to Salem's surprise, he dropped to his knees and bowed.\n\n\"Our enemies will fall beneath our power, My Queen,\" Loki said almost sincerely, \"For you are the only being on Remnant to hold a piece of infinity itself. Not even their souls will survive our wrath now.\"\n\n///\n\nThe gears that decorated the walls turned as the rhythmic ticking of the clock continued. Red and orange light from the setting sun pierced through the windows, the clock hands creating an interesting shadow on the floor as they moved.\n\nOzpin sat at his desk and sipped his hot chocolate as his eyes scanned the text on the screen in front of him. Reports from his staff about the performance of students, old and new, have started to appear in his Inbox. It has been a few days since the new school year started and while he was disappointed that Captain Rogers was unable to attend his first few classes, given the circumstances, it was easily forgiven.\n\nA piece of the most advanced nation from Earth was in Menagerie. This news made Ozpin uneasy.\n\nHe was happy that there were more survivors, but the implications of their arrival were enough cause for worry. So much so that he found it difficult to focus on his job as Headmaster.\n\nA god had piggybacked off the Avengers' spell and placed a larger chunk of Earth into Remnant than just the tower. This made Oz wonder, could other gods have done the same? What if you didn't have to purposely latch onto the spell and others were unwillingly pulled through as well? If so, where were they now? Had they appeared away from civilization and been attacked by Grimm? If so, shouldn't he already be hearing news of Hunters discovering ruins of unknown towns and cities?\n\nOzpin knew that there was more to the spell that the Avengers weren't telling him and he could forgive them for it. After all, he still hasn't told them his true nature as an immortal being who reincarnates by merging with a like-minded soul.\n\nHe also hasn't told them about how there is no way to kill Salem, but he hasn't told that to anyone, so that doesn't count. Technically.\n\nSuddenly, orange sparkles appeared in the centre of the room. At first, few and faint before quickly building in number. They spun in a large circle, gathering speed and numbers until they were able to form a solid gateway.\n\nOzpin shut off his computer as the space within the perimeter bent inwards and opened up to reveal a dimly lit room. Through the hole stepped through Remnant's only Sorcerer.\n\nThe portal fizzled out as the Avengers' resident magic expert nodded to the Headmaster, \"Professor Ozpin.\n\n\"Dr Strange.\" Ozpin greeted the man, getting up from behind his desk and grabbing Long Memory. He walked in front of his desk and the two magicians stood across from each other.\n\nOzpin held his cane at his directly in front of him with both hands resting on top of the handle. Strange's cloak rested on his shoulders as if it were just another article of clothing but Ozpin knew better than that.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Ozpin began the conversation, \"Thank you for agreeing to visit me. I apologise for pulling you from your work.\"\n\nStephen waved off the apology, \"It's fine. I needed a break from transcribing all of the knowledge of the Mystic Arts that I have memorised onto paper anyway. So tell me, what does the Headmaster of Beacon need from the Sorcerer Supreme?\"\n\nOzpin released air which was clogging his throat. He had spent a long mulling this over, weighing the pros and cons and searching for the best way to word what he wished to say. Nothing that he wasn't familiar with already. He hadn't discussed this with anyone besides himself.\n\nBut no matter how much he thought about it, planned his case or asked himself if he was even worthy, the result of this conversation would always ultimately fall on Strange and a simple yes or no.\n\n\"I understand that one of the Avengers' current missions is to preserve as much of Earth's knowledge and culture as possible before ultimately sharing it with all of Remnant.\"\n\nStephen nodded, \"That is correct. We've already begun on the latter actually.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. Ms Khan's book on Earth's Fairy Tales. I must say that I look forward to reading that when it is published.\"\n\nStephen smiled, \"I'll make sure that you're the second to get a copy. The author takes priority after all.\"\n\nOzpin chuckled, \"Of course.\"\n\nThen, in a blink of an eye, Stephen's smile returned to its usual, stern and neutral shape. He looked at Ozpin with an analytical eye, one that Ozpin felt was looking into his very old and very unique soul.\n\n\"However,\" Strange spoke again, \"I doubt that's all you wish to talk about, especially with me of all people. You're leading up to something, it's obvious as you deciding to dye your hair black. So I recommend that you cut out the middle part and skip to the end.\"\n\nOzpin sighed. He had expected this.\n\n\"Of course. I apologise. I'll speed things up now.\" Another deep breath. \"A vital part of the preservation of knowledge and culture is passing that knowledge on to the next generation. While I am well aware that I am far from a spring chicken...\"\n\nOzpin retracted Long Memory into its handle and, to Stephen's great surprise, went down to his knees. With the handle of his weapon in front of him, his hands on his knees and his head bowed low, Ozpin said;\n\n\"It would be an honour to study the Mystic Arts under your guidance, Sorcerer Supreme.\""
