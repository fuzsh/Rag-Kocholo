        "text": "The board of directors plays a critical role in the success of a nonprofit organization. The board is responsible for setting the organization’s strategic direction and ensuring that the organization has the necessary resources to achieve its goals. The board is also responsible for ensuring that the organization operates within legal and ethical guidelines.\n\nFiduciary Duty\n\nWe’ve talked about the fiduciary duty of nonprofit board members before, so I highly recommend you check out our full article and video on that subject. It’s such an important issue, we need to highlight it here, as well.\n\nOne of the key responsibilities of the board is to provide financial oversight. The board is responsible for approving the organization’s budget, making sure that the organization is operating within its means, and ensuring that the organization is in compliance with all financial regulations. The board is also responsible for ensuring that the organization has adequate resources to achieve its goals and for overseeing fundraising efforts.\n\nBut it’s not just oversight. Fiduciary duty means you have to treat the organization’s assets like they’re your own. You, the nonprofit board member, are fully responsible for the management, or mismanagement, of those resources.\n\nOverseeing Management\n\nThe board of directors is also responsible for hiring and overseeing the organization’s executive director or CEO. The board sets the CEO’s compensation, evaluates their performance, and provides guidance and support to ensure that the organization is operating effectively. More on that below.\n\nLegal and Ethical Concerns\n\nAnother important role of the board is to ensure that the organization operates in compliance with legal and ethical standards. The board is responsible for ensuring that the organization is complying with all laws and regulations, and for ensuring that the organization is operating ethically and with integrity.\n\nMission\n\nFinally, the board of directors is responsible for ensuring that the organization is fulfilling its mission and achieving its goals. The board is responsible for setting the organization’s mission, vision, and values, and for ensuring that the organization is making progress towards achieving its goals.\n\nA key principle to highlight here is that most boards function best when they limit themselves to governance. Governance is high level: strategy, oversight, accountability. By contrast, management is the day-to-day operations of a nonprofit.\n\nIdeally, a nonprofit’s governance team is different from its management team, which is made up of paid or volunteer staff members. While many small nonprofits…especially those in the startup phase…have board members serving in management positions, the ultimate goal is to have board members separate from paid staff members as much as possible. The board of directors, as a governing body, should focus on the organization’s mission, strategy, and goals. Staff members are responsible for the implementation of the mission.\n\nHaving dual-capacity board members can sometimes lead to problems between a nonprofit’s mission and how it operates. However, we have to quickly acknowledge that is not always possible in very small organizations. I served for many years on a neighborhood homeowners association board of directors, and my fellow directors and I did pretty much everything. Is that ideal? No, not at all. But sometimes it is reality in micro-sized nonprofits.\n\nBoard Meetings\n\nBoard members should meet periodically to discuss and vote on the affairs of the organization. A question we are often asked is, “How often should we meet?” Well, a common answer to every question around here is, “It depends!” Same with the question of board meetings.\n\nAt a minimum, an annual meeting must occur with all board members present. That’s probably not often enough, however, to adequately plan and oversee everything that the board is responsible for. Additional meetings should take place throughout the year so board members can discuss and make other necessary decisions.\n\nTerm Length\n\nBoard memberships are not set up to be permanent positions; most organizations have terms set up for board members, which typically fall between two and five years. That said, most states allow nonprofit board members to serve indefinitely, and the IRS doesn’t say anything about that subject at all.\n\nBut even if your nonprofit wants board members to serve for a long time, we recommend setting up reasonable term lengths, say 2 or 3 years, and reelect those members whose terms are expiring, but there is mutual interest in their continued service.\n\nDon’t be fearful of bringing new members, however. Sometimes fresh ideas are exactly what a nonprofit needs in order to thrive."
