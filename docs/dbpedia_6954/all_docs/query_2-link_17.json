        "text": "Story behind the song “Hey Girl”:\n\n“This song holds such a special place in my heart. I wrote it to remind you that YOU are a child of the most high King.”\n\n\"Hey Girl Nation is important to me because it shows the value of keeping your identity in Jesus. So many of us go through life putting our identity in what other people think and say about us, and it's exhausting. One of my friends changed my life in seventh grade. She said to me, \"Anne you are precious in the eyes of God. You are His precious daughter.\" This truth blew me away. Hey Girl Nation was created to remind you that you were made in the image of God. Let that truth guide you!\"\n\n-Anne Wilson\n\nLyrics to “Hey Girl”:\n\nThere in my reflection, man, this world's been messin'\n\nIt's been messin' with your mind\n\n(Hey girl) someone stole your smile now, it's been a little while now\n\nHappiness is hard to find\n\nLetting everybody and their mother try to tell you what you're worth\n\nOh, what you're worth\n\nWhen did you forget that the one who made you told you what you're worth?\n\nRepeat after me\n\nI'm a blood bought, battle fought, all my shame long gone\n\nMade new child of the King\n\nI'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized\n\nWent down and came up clean\n\nI'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace\n\nAnd now there ain't no way, girl, can't take that away, girl\n\nDon't forget you're free\n\nIt's who you're made to be, hey girl\n\ndon't you know you're beautiful?\n\nCrazy kind of wonderful, and there's no one like you\n\n(Hey girl) you don't need to measure up\n\nYou are the treasure of the God who loves you\n\nNo more letting everybody and their mother try to tell you what you're worth\n\nWhat you're worth\n\nAnd if you should forget, let the one who made you tell you what you're worth\n\nAnd repeat after me\n\nI'm a blood bought, battle fought, all my shame long gone\n\nMade new child of the King\n\nI'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized\n\nWent down and came up clean\n\nI'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace\n\nAnd now there ain't no way, girl\n\nCan't take that away, girl, don't forget you're free\n\nIt's who you're made to be, hey girl\n\nOh yeah (hey girl)\n\n(Hey girl)\n\nI'm glad we had this talk now, think we said it all now\n\nBut here's a little last advice\n\nLive free, walk in victory\n\nAnd repeat after me\n\nI'm a blood bought, battle fought, all my shame long gone\n\nMade new child of the King\n\nI'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized\n\nWent down and came up clean\n\nI'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace\n\nAnd now there ain't no way, girl\n\nCan't take that away, girl, don't forget you're free\n\nIt's who you're made to be, hey girl\n\nOh (hey girl)\n\nHey girl"
