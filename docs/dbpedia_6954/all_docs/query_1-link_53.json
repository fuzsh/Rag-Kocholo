        "text": "Not many people cared to use the rooftops of Beacon for sparring practice. There were the typical concerns about tumbling over the edge after a heated moment, teachers getting frustrated when fighters inevitably broke through the ceiling, and the simple fact that climbing all those stairs was a pain compared to just visiting the official sparring grounds. All of which came together to make it so nobody really cared to visit, even if they did somehow learn the Invincible Spear was training his team leader up here.\n\nWhich is good, Joan thinks to herself as she stares up at the morning sky with concrete digging into her back. She’s come a long way in conquering her pride ever since that whole mess with Cardin, but having an audience to the daily humiliation of fighting Pyrrhus?\n\n“Joan? You alright?”\n\nThe Mistralan champion in question stands over her with his brow furrowed in concern, Miló and Akoúo held loosely at his side. Honestly, it’s downright unfair how at ease he looks. His short red hair and Beacon uniform are every bit as perfectly put together as they’d been when this bout began, while here she is lying flat on her back utterly disheveled.\n\nUnfairness aside though, her partner’s still waiting for a reply.\n\n“I’m good Pyr. Just taking a second to enjoy the sky you know? I get so many chances to look at it these days.”\n\nShe gives him a chuckle to take any sting out of the complaint before raising her hand.\n\n“Speaking of, would you mind helping your fearless leader off the ground?”\n\nAn easy smile spreads across Pyrrhus’ face as he stoops down to clasp her hand with his own, causing her heart to skip a beat at the contact.\n\n\"It would be my pleasure.”\n\nHow funny, Joan thinks as her partner effortlessly hauls her up, that only a year ago she’d have insisted on crawling to her feet alone. As though raw stubbornness would somehow make her strong enough to fight with her team properly, when all it’d done was isolate her from them and leave her in the desperate floundering of anyone self-taught.\n\nShaking those negative thoughts aside Joan makes sure to pay attention as Pyrrhus starts his usual post-fight summary. Sure enough, the moment he’s certain she has both feet firmly planted, advice begins to flow from the four time champion.\n\n“You kept your shield up firmly even when attacking and didn’t let me seize the initiative. That was good! Focusing too much on protecting your upper body though-”\n\nA heavy groan oozes out of Joan, “Left my legs wide open, again.”\n\nThe natural consequences of being so damned tall. Standing a few inches higher than even her champion partner felt nice at first, but actually coordinating those long limbs instead of letting them just be lengthy targets? That made being a she-giant even worse than usual.\n\nYet Pyrrhus gives a firm shake of his head in response, “Absolutely not! There was an opening, but even then you nearly reacted in time. With just a bit more footwork or against a slower opponent you’d have been fine.”\n\nHe reaches up to scratch the back of his neck with a look of contrition.\n\n“Of course... I know that doesn’t really make it feel any better to be on the losing end.”\n\nAh geez, this again. Joan sheathes Croeca Mors and waves a hand, brushing off her partner’s concern and a few stray hairs in the same motion.\n\n“Nah, it’s fine Pyr. Heck, it’d actually be pretty concerning if I managed to pull off a win. I’d wonder if you’d come down with something nasty!”\n\nShe gives a small shrug, “So don’t sweat over it. Besides, lasting a few minutes against Mr.Invincible Spear is still way better than the rest of our class, eh?”\n\nThe cheeky side of Joan swells with delight as Pyrrhus lets out a full groan at her wording.\n\n“ Please don’t say it like that.”\n\nAn impish smile spreads across Joan’s face as she takes a step forward, leaning just slightly into her partner’s personal space.\n\n“Oh? Is something wrong? I don’t mind being on the business end of your ‘Invincible Spear’ you know.”\n\nShe steps back with a light laugh, “Sure, it hurts , but no pain no gain right?”\n\nThe champion’s body falls into a slouch, collapsing his weapons into their travel forms over one shoulder as he sighs.\n\n“Please do me the favor of never making that joke again.”\n\nJoan replies with a distinctly unladylike snort, “Come on, you can’t seriously tell me I’m the first person who’s done that?”\n\n“Oh no, I’ve heard it many times before. It’s just... It’s weird to hear it coming from my actual girlfriend instead of a creepy fan.”\n\nOh. Now it’s Joan’s turn to flush, the reminder of their relationship setting her nerves ablaze.\n\n“I, uh, sorry?”\n\nPyrrhus just chuckles, “Don’t worry. It isn’t even a bad sort of weird. Just, you know, a bit off.”\n\nHe closes the distance between them with a smile, clasping their hands together before he leans in to give her a quick peck on the lips. His own cheeks showing a bit of heat as he pulls back, the sound of his own heart thumping in his ears at the touch of their lips.\n\nFor a moment the two just stare at each other, locked in their own little world. Joan starts to lean in for a deeper kiss, her mouth drawn to Pyrrhus as though his Polarity is pulling her in.\n\nThen the period bell rings, shattering the moment and causing the two lovebirds to jolt away from each other as though they’ve just touched a stove. Luckily Pyrrhus recovers quickly, coughing into his fist in a desperate attempt to clear the air.\n\n“We, ah, probably want to get to our next class.”\n\nA mute nod is all Joan’s able to manage, swiftly turning for the stairs and trying not to trip as thoughts of her partner's lips pressed to hers threaten to overwhelm any sense of balance. Any further conversation on their way down is smothered by an overwhelming air of awkwardness and the clack of their shoes against the steps.\n\nThings don’t get much better when they reach the bottom and step out into the campus proper. Between other students all around and the rush of reaching Port’s class there’s no real opportunity to finish what they started.\n\nThough, as her thoughts clear up a bit, Joan can quietly admit that they wouldn’t have gone much further even without an interruption. Neither JNPR’s leader nor its champion had the boldness to do anything more intense than a quick kiss, and even those rarely involved tongue.\n\nEven once they’ve entered professor Port’s classroom though, that kiss doesn’t leave Joan’s mind. She sits down at her usual seat beside Ruby while Pyrrhus moves a bit further down to spend time with Ren and Nora, seeing what those two girls were up to for the break.\n\nRuby all but bounces in her seat as her first Beacon friend arrives.\n\n“Hey Joan! Have a good break?”\n\nNormally the younger girl’s energy is infectious, but today Joan just gives a small nod. Staring out into the middle distance as Port begins some inane lecture on the time he beat a Boarbatusk to death with a Beowulf.\n\nWhat would it have been like if she’d had the time and bravery to go wild with Pyrrhus on that rooftop? Take turns undoing buttons on each others uniforms until both of them had their chests exposed. All of Pyr’s raw muscle on full display before he pressed her to the roof and-\n\n“Everything alright Vomit Comet? You’re drooling.”\n\nJoan jolts upright in her seat and wipes her mouth as Yang slides in next to her, a wicked grin on the other blonde’s face.\n\n“Come on sis, we’ve got a lecture!”\n\nRuby, bless her, tries to distract her sister to no avail. Yang just brushes off the attempt and Port’s indistinct ramblings with equal indifference.\n\n“Sorry Rubes, but between those drool drops I spot some gossip . Come clean to me girl, are you daydreaming of a time when you got frisky with the champ?”\n\nYang waggles her eyebrows with a suggestive smile, yet Joan feels a frown come across her lips.\n\n“No. We barely kiss, and he gets skittish about even holding hands in public.”\n\nThat wasn’t her fault, she knew. Just an unfortunate reality of dating a minor celebrity. Pyrrhus valued his privacy and didn’t want either of them getting hounded by tabloid journalists. She respected that, honest! But when he didn’t want to go further even behind closed doors…\n\nThe other blonde clearly picks up on her quiet frustration, giving a low whistle before easing back into her own seat. Yang clicks her tongue as she kicks both feet onto the desk, crossing her arms with a shake of her head.\n\n“Damn girl, looks like you’ve got a real problem. Lucky for you auntie Yang has a brilliant solution.”\n\nIgnoring the incredibly unimpressed look on Ruby’s face Yang leans over to whisper in Joan’s ear. The other’s blonde’s face flushes in an instant, but she doesn’t pull away. Instead she tilts a bit closer, eager to pick up every word. By the time Yang pulls back to their own seat Joan seems utterly transfixed, eyes wide.\n\n“Would that even work?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\nYang speaks with all the false confidence of an older sister who’d lied to Ruby about Santa’s existence for the last decade running. The brawler gives her fellow blonde a wink to seal the deal.\n\n“Once he gets a look at what you have to offer? Even the champ won’t be able to hold back. I mean I’ve got a fine set of chesticles, but you? Those are some straight up fabric stretching, wind flapping-”\n\n“Uhh, Yang?”\n\nRuby looks over these proceedings with the doubtful gaze of a little sister who knew her big sis had lied about Santa, but didn’t want to make the older girl sad by admitting that.\n\n“I don’t know if whatever you’re telling her about is a great idea. I mean, if Joan’s not happy about something shouldn’t they just talk it out?”\n\nThe younger Huntress is right of course. Clear communication is at the heart of any successful relationship. Alas, those reasonable words pass through Joan’s ears as little more than white noise. Yang’s whispers have left the bigger blonde staring into the middle distance red faced, a gentle pant leaking out of her.\n\nThe harsh scoff of an heiress breaks through those delusions, Weiss leveling a glare at Yang from her other side, “You’re incorrigible, you know that?”\n\nYang casually tosses her hands out to the side, palms wide in a gesture of surrender, “I’m just offering a friend some relationship advice! What gives Weiss cream?”\n\n“Aside from you clearly encouraging premarital relations?”\n\nNow it’s Yang’s turn to scoff, “‘Premarital relations’ come on Snow Angel, nobody cares about that sort of thing these days. Nobody worth your time at least.”\n\nWeiss narrows her eyes at her teammate. But whatever scathing rebuke she had planned is cut short as the period bell rings again, professor Port mercifully being to cut his tale short and release the students trapped in his classroom.\n\nAs the rest of her team all but sprints out Ruby gives her friend a quick pat on her shoulder, “Don’t worry! If you and Pyrrhus are having fun I’m sure all that other stuff will be fine.”\n\nJoan offers a polite nod as the younger girl rushes off in a blur of rose petals, but her thoughts are elsewhere. She has been having fun with Pyrrhus. More than just fun, he’s the only person who knows the truth about her transcripts and still believes in her. Heck, he commits a huge chunk of his time to training her! Even if she’s never been in another relationship, it’s easy to see that kind of dedication is special.\n\nBut… young loves like this don’t tend to last, do they? That’s what the internet and her parents said anyways, and both of those sources being wrong at the same time was almost unheard of.\n\nIt’s not like Pyrrhus would be hurting for options if things went bad between them. Weiss had shown interest in the champion on day one, and she was the heiress of the biggest company on Remnant! If Pyrrhus ever got tired of her he could easily do better than the middle child of eight sisters. A stupid girl who probably would’ve gotten herself killed or crippled if she hadn’t caught his eye…\n\nNo, no wallowing in negativity! She broke free of Cardin by taking bold action, and that’s exactly what she’ll do now.\n\nYang’s advice burning in her mind, Joan swiftly strides down to her teammates before hesitation can seize control. They glance up at her approach, Pyrrhus even giving a magnificent smile, but she can’t let herself get distracted.\n\n“Hey Pyrrhus, do you mind going ahead of us? I wanted to talk to Nora about something.”\n\nHer partner briefly looks confused at that, but luckily he doesn’t press her for details. The former champion collects his school supplies and moves on to the next period, giving his team an incredibly handsome glance over his shoulder as he departs\n\nDamn, but he really is good at that over the shoulder look. Did he practice it? Joan remembers he mentioned a bit of modeling as part of his tourney career, but it’s not like she’s ever heard of Nikos brand underwear or anything. Although, now that she’s thinking of it-\n\n“Noble leader, what would you request of this queen?”\n\nOh right, talking to Nora. Okay. Deep breathes Joan, you’re not asking for anything crazy. Just making a request with implications even Ruby could spot from a mile out.\n\n“I was wondering if, uh, P-Pyrrhus and I could have the dorm to ourselves tonight?”\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nNora adopts an unusually pensive stare, stroking her chin as she rotates her head between her leader and the door their champion just used to leave. It’s an odd expression to see on the normally bombastic girl, her brow furrowed with concentration and her eyes narrow as though she can see through Joan’s thoughts if she squints hard enough.\n\nFor a moment Joan starts to sweat, but Nora’s impromptu investigation promptly ends in favor of her usual bubbly grin, “Can do boss babe! Ren and I wanted to go hang around Vale anyway. Know any cool arcades or hotels a couple gal pals could use?”\n\nSuppressing a sigh of relief Joan smiles back at her friend, “I’m as new to Vale as you are, but I’ve heard the Four Seasons has a nice arcade inside.”\n\nNora slams both palms together like a thunderclap, eagerness writ plain across her face, “Then it is settled! We shall venture to the land of Four Seasons and return on the morrow, or I’m not queen of the castle!”\n\nRen lets out a heavy breath at having her evening adjusted on short notice, but it’s a fond sort of exasperation. At least Joan’s pretty sure it is. Hard to imagine living with Nora for years on end without learning to love her spontaneous moments.\n\nNow she thinks about it, those girls really are cute together. Ren’s sleek physique makes for a fine contrast to Nora’s stouter figure. Careful precision and brute force, calm and crazy, Lean queen and short stack-\n\nAh ah ah, none of that for Joan. Not when she needs to get everything ready for tonight! With a firm nod to herself, team JNPR’s team leader sets out to collect her supplies so she can give Pyrrhus one hell of a surprise.\n\n-Several Hours Later-\n\nPyrrhus rolls out his shoulders as he makes his way back to the dorms, feeling the straps of his backpack digging into the muscle. It’s not his only source of tension of course, but it’s an easy scapegoat.\n\nThe four time champion steps up to his team’s room and gives it a few quick knocks. Living with three girls meant he had to be careful about this sort of thing. Luckily it was a precaution he’d figured out before catching Nora’s hammer or a disappointed stare from Ren.\n\n“C-come in.”\n\nJoan’s voice sounds through the door and Pyrrhus swings it open a moment later, greeted by the brilliant sight of his girlfriend in her bunny onesie. Some might question how a onesie of all things could be attractive, but those people didn’t get to see Joan’s chest strain the fabric of pajamas that were clearly purchased when she was several cup sizes smaller. They also didn’t get to see the outline of her underwear through said fabric.\n\nMore importantly though, seeing Joan so cozy is wonderful in a way unrelated to the head between his legs. Lying on her bed, watching some sort of video on her Scroll… getting to see that relaxed side of her just makes him feel warm in a way that’s hard to describe. It’s a privileged view of her that not many people are allowed, and part of him wishes Ren and Nora had their own dorm so he had it all to himself.\n\nShe shuts off her Scroll as Pyrrhus closes the door and slips off his backpack, sliding off her bed into a standing position as his school supplies hit the ground. With hands clasped behind her back she matches his gaze, cheeks just a bit flushed as their eyes meet.\n\n“So! I was, uh, thinking you must get a lot of soreness built up from our extra training on top of your normal workout. Which, one thing led to another, and I figured it’d be cool if I gave you a m-massage.”\n\nSomething’s a little off about his team leader. She’s bouncing a bit on the balls of her feet and nibbling her lower lip as she waits for a reply. Whatever it is that has her nervous though, Pyrrhus is confident she’ll open up soon. Joan has plenty of talents she didn’t have a chance to explore before Beacon, but keeping secrets isn’t one of them.\n\nWhatever that is aside, tugging off his uniform shirt and lying face down on the bed is a simple task. He’s not quite tired enough to consider falling asleep on the spot, but Joan wasn’t wrong in her assessment. Helping her improve while not letting his own edge dull didn’t leave a lot of time for the stretches he’d normally use to ward off the tension built up between his shoulder blades.\n\nThere’s a rustle of something behind him, but he’s not given long to think about it before Joan’s strong fingers descend a moment later. All the rigor of a full day melts away as Joan kneads his skin beneath her palms and digs down to the muscles, working through his knots with surprising skill.\n\nHe barely resists the urge to moan as she untangles a particularly foul tangle of muscle, “Joan, you’ve got a downright amazing touch. How long have you been doing this?”\n\n“A while.”\n\nWhatever nerves were holding her back before, they seem to have faded a bit as she loses herself in her element, “Whenever I wanted something from my sisters they always had me give them a backrub in exchange. It was a bit of a joke around the house that I’d do better as a masseuse than Huntress.”\n\nIs that a bit of self doubt slipping into her tone? Can’t have that! “Well, I’m glad you decided to come here instead of letting them get to you. Otherwise we’d have never met!”\n\nJoan’s ministrations pause for a moment, and in that heartbeat Pyrrhus worries he’s misspoke. Her hands continue a moment later though, pushing out his new unease along with the old. Her heft settles against him, and this time Pyrrhus can’t help himself from groaning into the mattress as she does. Thank the gods he’s face down, because otherwise she’d have a very clear indicator of how good this is making him feel.\n\nYet as soon as he thinks that her weight rises off him and the sound of a zipper coming undone reaches his ears. Before he can question what’s going on and whether or not he should turn around, Joan speaks in a faltering voice.\n\n“F-flip onto your back, please.”\n\nAh. Well, there’s no hiding his erection now. With the weary energy of a man heading to his execution Pyrrhus rotates to face upwards. Yet instead of whatever he’d expected he’s shocked into silence as Joan drops her weight back down onto his clothed waist. His girlfriend sits straddled over him in a two piece swimsuit that leaves little to the imagination. The fabric desperately strains to contain her generous bust, and Pyrrhus finds himself completely and utterly hypnotized at the sight before him.\n\nHer ample chest rises and falls with anxious breaths, and Pyrrhus can feel his cock growing hard against her between the layers of cloth and spandex. Then he directs his gaze down, taking in her full figure. The toned stomach with a thin cover of fat, thick thighs resting on either side of his waist, and her crotch . Where just a hint of neatly trimmed blonde hair peeks over the edge of her bikini, teasing at the treasure hidden so very close by.\n\nFor a moment he just gazes in stunned awe, without a single word passing through his head. Joan fidgets against him at the silence, gnawing on her lower lip in a deliciously anxious expression.\n\n“I-I don’t have any fancy underwear. But... I figured a swimsuit is good enough?”\n\nGood enough? Good enough?! If Pyrrhus wasn’t a gentleman paralyzed with shock he’d have torn that flimsy tie-off bikini off her in a heartbeat! He is a gentleman though, and even as the paralysis starts to fade hesitation is starting to build up. This is a huge leap compared to anything they’d ever done before, is he really ready to take that plunge?\n\nAs his silence draws out Joans hands quietly tighten into fists against his abs, the edges of her eyes starting to redden with tears at what she assumes to be rejection, and Pyrrhus makes his choice.\n\nShe wants this. He wants this, and that’s enough. They can talk more about it later, but to back away here after she’s taken this leap of faith? No. He’s not going to destroy her confidence like that. Raising one hand to wipe away the wetness of her eyes Pyrrhus gives her his most genuine smile.\n\n“You’re beautiful, and more than good enough.”\n\nThe honest compliment sets Joan’s face on fire, and her expression lights up in the most amazing way he’s ever seen. She raises a trembling hand between her breasts, reaching between them to withdraw a single condom. The display makes Pyrrhus’ cock strain even harder against his pants, and his own breaths start coming out a little ragged in anticipation.\n\nHe eagerly unbuttons his pants, Joan lifting herself off him just a bit so he can kick them off and let his staff rise to full mast. Pride swells in his heart as Joan’s eyes widen just from looking at his length, but luckily for both of them she’s not half as captivated as Pyrrhus was. Not when there’s a goal sitting right in front of her hard and ready.\n\nJoan’s hands are a bit clumsy as she wraps his rod, anticipation causes just a slight shudder to pass through her. If anything though that just makes it better, and Pyrrhus can barely contain himself as she finishes her task. With deliberate slowness Joan rises up to her knees, using one hand to guide him into position while the other tugs her thong-like swimsuit aside. Then, with his cock kissing her entrance, Joan locks eyes with him. He gives her a little nod, and that’s all she needs to impale herself on his length.\n\nThe full force of her weight coming down almost knocks the wind out of him, but the wet heat of her insides soothe any discomfort. Joan’s eyes widen at the sensation of his cock spear through her, mouth open in a silent O as she falls forward, hands splayed against his chest for balance.\n\nFor a few seconds she just breathes heavily against him, getting used to the feeling of a dick inside her. Joan learns fast though, and in only a moment she’s lifting herself up to slam his cock into her depths again, bouncing up and down with the clapping sound of flesh on flesh.\n\nThere were no words that could describe the sensation. Her wet walls squeeze Pyrrhus for all he’s worth, and despite the thin layer of plastic between them it’s all he can do to stop himself from cumming on the spot. His hands grasp at Joan’s hips and he thrusts back, jerking his hips against hers. It’s awkward at first, out of sync, but after a few attempts they find a rhythm. A rhythm that has Joan outright moan, then suddenly shudder against him.\n\nPyrrhus doesn’t quite realize what’s happened at first, continuing his thrusts even as Joan slows, but as her wetness leaks against his pelvis he realizes he’s just made his girlfriend cum for the first time. It lights a fire in his heart, and a moment later he uses her higher center of gravity to reverse their positions, tossing Joan down to the mattress so he can loom over her.\n\nBlonde hair spreads out across the bed in a glorious vision as she looks up at him with a dazed expression, bliss spreading through her entire body. Unable to resist the sight, Pyrrhus leans down to kiss her. It’s not even close to their usual pecks, more like their mouths are trying to devour one another and strangle the other’s tongue with their own.\n\nHis hands move to spread her legs apart she wraps her arms around him in a hug, pulling him in as their thrusting continues. Joan’s cum soaked flesh lets out wet plaps as he pistons inside her again and again, the physique of a champion propelling him forward with enough eagerness to overwhelm any virgin fumbling.\n\nJoan gasps into his mouth, throwing her head back from the raw sensation. That leaves her throat wide open though, and Pyrrhus seizes the chance to lock his lips against her neck. He’s rewarded by an even tighter squeeze around his cock, and as his teeth dig into soft skin Pyrrhus feels his entire body shudder with pleasure as a jet of cum sprays into the condom.\n\nSlowly, Pyrrhus pulls himself out of her and sits up on his knees. The thin plastic at the end of his cock is heavy with sperm, and a burst of pride fills him as Joan’s mouth drops at the sight. Then she rolls over onto her front, raising her ass in an impossibly attractive pose while locking him in place with a desperate stare over her shoulder.\n\n“I... I’m on the pill. You can go again, right Pyr?”\n\nAny semblance of caution flies out the window at the siren song of her eager begging, and Pyrrhus grasps her juicy butt with both hands to force himself inside yet again. Without a condom in the way he can feel her warmth pressed directly against his cock, and the edge of her swimsuit brush against his balls as they slap against her cheeks.\n\nFilled with a wild energy, Pyrrhus leans down to shove his hands beneath her bikini. Joan gasps as he squeezes those succulent orbs, kneading both breasts in his hands as he continues pumping into her from behind. Each palm can barely contain the massive tits, and for a fleeting instant Pyrrhus wonders how much bigger they’d get if she was pregnant. Fat tits swelling with milk for him and their child.\n\nAny further thought is abandoned as Joan throws her head back for a kiss, and Pyrrhus takes a hand away from her chest to pull her up even more so he can lock lips yet again. He feels like a beast in heat, thrusting into her with a desperate need to breed even as a tiny part of him screams in terror at the idea.\n\nThat tiny voice can’t hope to stop him now though, and a few thrusts later Pyrrhus lets his churning balls erupt once again. The feeling of his seed filling her causes him to see white for a moment, and if the full body shudder is anything to go off of Joan feels just the same.\n\nFinally, Pyrrhus allows himself to tumble down into the sheets. His heart pounds more than it has in his most intense tournaments and a thrill beyond even the greatest victories fills him even as what little stamina he has drains away.\n\nHe did it. Had bareback sex with the girl of his dreams. Joan had to make the first move, but he really did it! Two rounds back to back on top of that. Pretty damn good for his first time!\n\nBut a bit of fear starts leaking in as he comes down from the high of going balls deep into his girlfriend. The potential consequences of that impulsive act creeping into his mind. Joan said she was on birth control, and his leader would never lie about that sort of thing. Even so, the only absolute certainty of avoiding pregnancy was abstinence, and they’d definitely failed at that.\n\nNo. Pyrrhus shakes his head. Even in that worst case scenario, they’ll be fine. Morning after pills, discrete clinics, there are plenty of options if Joan’s precautions don’t work. Yeah, they’ll be fine .\n\nAny fears for the future are cast aside as Joan rises from the mattress. Sweat drips from the girl as she sits up to her full height, and Pyrrhus is struck by the sudden reminder that his girlfriend is notably taller than him. A heartbeat later both of her legs are thrown across his waist to straddle him yet again, and in that moment Pyr looks up to Joan looming over him with a barely controlled frenzy behind her eyes.\n\nShe tucks disheveled blonde hair behind an ear to fix him with a hungry gaze. Her tongue runs across her lips as she tucks both hands behind her back to unclip the bikini that was already struggling to stay on. That weighty chest heaves with pants just as his own does as the bikini falls, diamond hard nipples on full display. Yet it’s with a slowly dawning horror that Pyrrhus realizes she’s not breathing so hard from exhaustion, but eagerness .\n\n“I want more ... we go just a bit more, right Pyr?”\n\nHer voice comes out as breathless, but the light in those eyes tells him she has more energy now than ever before. Each limb is coiled with a quiet desperation to continue, her trimmed nails dig into the meat of Pyrrhus’ pecs with a carnal thirst just barely kept from devouring him on the spot.\n\nA smarter, less competitive man would realize he’s awakened something he can’t control and call it quits here. Alas, poor Pyrrhus has never been one to back down from a challenge.\n\n“S-sure Joan, I can go all night!”\n\n-Twelve Hours Later-\n\n“Mr.Nikos, are you well?”\n\nGlynda Goodwitch allows herself an expression of concern as the finest member of her class lies slumped over his desk, all but dead to the world around him. The ordinarily attentive boy appears concerningly pale, notably dehydrated, and instead of his usual polite response or even bothering to sit up? Pyrrhus just lets out a tired groan at her words.\n\nLuckily his team leader appears incredibly energetic this morning, Joan Arc all but bouncing in her seat as she raises her hand to speak.\n\n“Don’t worry Miss Goodwitch! He’s just a little tuckered out today. I can totally fight in his place though!”\n\nHmm... a tad strange, but not an occurrence worth questioning.\n\n“No need, Ms.Arc. Do your partner the favor of taking notes for today’s class and ensure he’s in good health.”\n\nAn absolutely beaming smile splits Joan’s face, the girl’s aura shining so brightly that some nearby students cover their eyes from combat class’s latest light source."
