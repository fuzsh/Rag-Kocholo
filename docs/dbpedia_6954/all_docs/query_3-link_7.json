        "text": "The Post Office opened the first automatic exchange on the public network at Epsom in Surrey in May 1912. This was the same year it had obtained a near-monopoly on the provision of the country’s telephone service.\n\nIt took decades for automatic dialling to roll out across the country. Installing an automatic exchange was expensive, and while savings were made by making operators redundant, it took time for this to generate cash. The two world wars also had a depressing effect on investment.\n\nOne of the last manual switchboards in the UK—and the last to run in London—was at Enfield, north London. It switched to automatic connection at 13.30 on Wednesday 5 October 1960.\n\nTelephone systems worldwide have since adopted digital technology. The now-familiar keypad has replaced the rotary dial, as exchanges no longer need sequential electrical pulses to drive machinery.\n\nThe London region’s last manual exchange, at Upminster in Essex, finally converted in 1970. The last manual exchange in mainland UK, at Abingdon, closed in 1975.\n\nLike computers and other modern digital technologies, today’s electronic exchanges occupy far less space and have many times the capacity of the earlier manual exchanges. But the operator is not entirely extinct. If you’re having trouble making a call, you can still dial 100 and ask a human being for help."
