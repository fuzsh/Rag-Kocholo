Cheng Xiao is also a member of Cosmic Girls' sub-unit 'Wonder'.\n\nShe debuted in early 2016 in the originally twelve but now thirteen member girl group, WJSN, otherwise known as Cosmic Girls, with the mini album 'Would You Like'. In 2016, she also joined the five member Inkigayo's Muisc Crush project Sunny Girls, where they release the song 'Mr Taxi'. The same year, she and seven other members of WJSN, joined seven members of the group Monsta X to create Y-Teen, during their promotion they released the single 'Do Better'.\n\nCheng Xiao didn't gain popularity, however, until she competed and won gold in ISAC (Idol Championship) in their Rhythmic Gymnastics segment as well as being proclaimed the first Pitch King. She would go on to join variety shows both in Korea and China with noticeable people like Twice's Sana, BTS's Jin and Jimin, Astro's Cha Eun Woo and Uniq's Wang Yibo.\n\nIn 2018, Cheng Xiao went back to China to be a dance mentor on the music survival show, Idol Producer.
