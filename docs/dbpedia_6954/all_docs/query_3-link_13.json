        "text": "Robin McBride\n\nRobin serves as the Board Chair and President of McBride Sisters Wine Company, a multinational organization headquartered in Oakland, California. It is in the top 1% of volume, largest Black-owned and largest women founded wine company in the United States, as well as one of the most inclusive, accessible, and socially aware. Robin and her sister began importing wines from New Zealand in 2005 and started making their own wine together in 2009.\n\nBy spring 2017, the pair were producing wine from their hometowns in Monterey California and Aotearoa New Zealand under one label, McBride Sisters Collection. In 2018, they launched Black Girl Magic Wines, a celebratory wine brand paying homage to women in their family and community, and in 2019 the sisters debuted SHE CAN Wines, a premium canned wine in 2019 on International Women’s Day.\n\nRobin serves as a Board Chair for the McBride Sisters SHE CAN Professional Development Fund which she founded in 2019 with her sister Andréa. Since its inception the fund has awarded over $3M in scholarships, grants and technical training to 3,000 professional women in wine & spirits, hospitality and finance. In 2021 the fund partnered with Southern University of Louisiana as their flagship HBCU, to create a career pipeline for diverse students into the wine industry.\n\nRobin and Andréa were the first Black women winery owners on the cover of Wine Enthusiast magazine and were nominated for the Wine Star Award for the US Winery of the Year in 202. Robin resides in the San Francisco Bay Area and has three children Daneia, Domenic and Angelo who all have pursuits in the wine & food industries.\n\nAndréa McBride John\n\nAndréa serves as CEO of McBride Sisters Wine Company, a multinational organization headquartered in Oakland, California. It is in the top 1% of volume, largest Black-owned and largest women founded wine company in the United States, as well as one of the most inclusive, accessible, and socially aware.

She is a member of the 2022 Class of Henry Crown Fellows within the Aspen Global Leadership Network at the Aspen Institute and she resides in San Francisco with her husband Fabian and daughter Meursault.\n\nAmy Butler\n\nBy 2018, the McBride Sisters had grown their brand to the point where they needed a dedicated winemaker based on the Central Coast and met Amy Butler through a trusted advisor and fellow Central Coast viticulturist. After starting her career in Napa, Amy had racked up a 16-year history of contract and consulting winemaking in and around Paso Robles and was instantly a perfect match for the McBride Sisters’ philosophy and company culture. Amy's UC Davis enology degree, her broad experience building and growing boutique wine brands, and her \"liquid resumé\" made her a strong candidate for the job. After two and a half years as a consultant, the Sisters finally convinced Amy to join the company full-time. While spearheading the winemaking efforts of a growth leader in all wine categories, Amy brings her small-production focus on quality and authenticity to all the wines in the McBride Sisters Wine Company portfolio.\n\nWine for the new world\n\nFounded by real-life sisters Robin McBride and Andréa McBride John, McBride Sisters Wine Company is the largest Black-owned and largest all women-founded wine company in the United States. Our mission is to transform the industry, lead by example and cultivate community, one delicious glass at a time.\n\nWe serve the “New Majority”, that have been ignored by the U.S. wine industry for many years, who are thirsty and want to be welcomed into the world of wine. Our mission is to break down barriers and make the future of wine more accessible.\n\nWe produce wine across two hemispheres, from premier coastal winemaking regions which are at the root of our story - where Andréa and Robin each grew up - in Aotearoa (pronounced “ah-oh teh-ah ROH-ah”) New Zealand and the Central Coast of California, in the United States. We offer a unique portfolio of leading brands; McBride Sisters Collection, Black Girl Magic Wines, and SHE CAN Wines and spritzers.\n\nMcBride Sisters Wine Company produces, imports and markets its own wines. It specializes in the Fortune 500 grocery stores and mass retailers, as well as wine and spirits chains, hotels, restaurants, independent wine shops, sports arenas and airlines across almost all 50 states of the U.S, Caribbean and Canada.\n\nIn March of 2023, McBride Sisters Wine Company became Certified Carbon Neutral and offset our 2022 carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits from projects around the world that are focused on environmental, social equity and economic equity for historically marginalized communities.\n\nWe are Wine for the New World.\n\nShe Can Have It All\n\nWe are a women-first, women-owned and women led company. We show up and advocate for all\n\nwomen. We walk the walk, talk the talk, break the rules, make the wine and then DRINK IT!\n\nDelivering lip-smackingly delicious, lower calorie, affordable, premium quality wines and spritzers in a can, SHE CANs are nimble and ready to show up to your journey. Versatility and experimentation are our priority. One 250mL can of SHE CAN Wines is just over one and a half 5oz glasses of wine, so there is no pressure to commit to overindulging in (or wasting!) an entire bottle to enjoy the experience. We are change agents who advocate for fun, experimentation, inclusivity, and empowerment to revolutionize the wine industry and beyond. We see you, and invite you to show up and discover a like-minded community with SHE CAN.\n\nThe McBride Sisters Story\n\nThe McBride Sisters story is one like no other. One could say that their path to sisterhood and ultimately changing the face of the wine industry was destiny at work. Sisters Robin McBride and Andréa McBride John were raised across the globe from one another in two of the world's most iconic wine growing, agriculture and farming regions — Monterey, California and Aotearoa New Zealand. Each thought they were only children until fate united them in 1999 and their discovery of one another, along with a shared love affair with wine, food and culture, sparked a creative and entrepreneurial force.\n\nWelcome to M Ranch\n\nOn Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 2023, we received the keys to M Ranch: a proud new milestone and chapter in our wine journey. By acquiring this historic vineyard property in Napa Valley’s breezy and beautiful Carneros District, we finally have a place to call our own. What we build here will surely make history in Napa Valley, where wineries owned by Black women are hard to come by.\n\nOur 12-acre property has been a family ranch for more than 100 years – with a name that immediately felt like home. We celebrated our first M Ranch harvest in 2023, and will be working to restore and enhance the landscape as the new stewards of this magical place. We have big plans for M Ranch, and we look forward to welcoming the public to our Napa Valley home in 2024.\n\nStay tuned for updates!\n\nNorthern Hemisphere\n\nAmy Butler\n\nFor me, the Holidays are about sharing the table and the kitchen. I spend all year looking at cookbooks and planning the feast. We [me and my family] enjoy our traditional favorites of course, with seasonal flavors like pumpkin, sage, and cranberry, but we can't help changing up the recipes from year to year. The versatility of our McBride Sisters Collection Red Blend finds a home with all of these dishes, fruity enough to pair with roast turkey or pork, and bright enough to emphasize the richness of buttery potatoes and herby stuffing. In my family, we've learned that what's in the glass during the preparation of the food is almost as important as what's in the glass on the table! The festive mood in the bustling kitchen lends itself to a glass (or two) of the McBride Sisters Collection Sparkling Brut Rosé, our nod to the sunny southern hemisphere as we welcome California's cozy winter."
