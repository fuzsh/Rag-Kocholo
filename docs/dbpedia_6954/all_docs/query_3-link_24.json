        "text": "re: \"I have the same concern regarding this. My client asked me to fill out the NDA and on that NDA, they ask for my id card number and password number. Can I give this to the client before we start the contract?\"\n\nAxel: What you said here does not make sense.\n\nReal NDAs do not ask for ID card numbers or passwords.\n\nWhat ID card are they asking for? (They should not be asking for any.)\n\nPassword to what? Of course a real NDA doesn't ask for a password. But I am curious about what they are asking for. People use dozens of different usernames and passwords.\n\nAxel G wrote:\n\nHi!\n\nI have the same concern regarding this. My client asked me to fill out the NDA and on that NDA, they ask for my id card number and passport number. Can I give this to the client before we start the contract?\n\nWe are not supposed to provide any means of contacting us off the platform prior to a contract, however, an exception can be made if it's necessary to share information required to scope the project. So, if the client needs to share proprietary info with you in order for you to provide cost, schedule, etc. and they need you to sign an NDA, that's OK. However, I personally would not provide my passport number or any other identification on the NDA. Name and address should suffice. As others have pointed out, the enforceability of NDAs in this context can be questionable and in practical terms, they are mostly for the client's comfort level. That is no reason to create any vulnerability for yourself by sharing more contact/identification info than absolutely necessary. IMO.\n\nVikas:\n\nI have signed dozens of NDAs for clients. Typically before a contract has started.\n\nThis is a normal thing. It's not a big deal.\n\n\"NDA\" is short for \"Non-Disclosure Agreement.\"\n\nAn NDA is an agreement that states that I won't tell other people about the work I'm doing on behalf of the client. That I won't tell other people about the information relating to their business, etc.\n\nSo that means that the NDA is completely meaningless to me, because I wouldn't tell people anyway, with or without the agreement.\n\nI regularly advise freelancers:\n\nJust read the agreement, and if there is nothing weird in it, then go ahead and sign it.\n\nThe one thing to watch out for is that you don't want the NDA contract to have OTHER stuff in it that isn't about \"non-disclosure.\" Like you don't want it to say \"if you sign this contract you can't work for any other company for a period of 10 years\" or \"if anything goes wrong in our company it will be all your fault\" or \"If you give birth to a child you must give him to us.\"\n\nIf there is nothing weird like that, then sign it. If there is something you know you shouldn't agree to, then you can tell the client that you will sign the NDA after they remove that line.\n\nVikas:\n\nA few other points:\n\nYou live in India. The client who sent you the NDA probably does not.\n\nAs a practical matter, anything in the NDA is completely unenforceable. You're basically on the honor system.\n\nWhat if the NDA says \"You won't tell anybody about this project.\"\n\nAnd then you tell your mom about the project.\n\nWhat is the client going to do about that?\n\nNothing, really. There is nothing he can do.\n\nHe probably won't even know.\n\nMost of the time:\n\nThe main reason that the client is sending you an NDA is that he thinks he is supposed to have you sign an NDA. He read about that somewhere or somebody told him about it.\n\nMost people who ask you to sign an NDA have not even read the NDA themselves. Somebody in the legal department told them to have freelancers sign it. Or they downloaded the NDA off the Internet.\n\nBased on my experience, Preston, you hit the nail on the head when it comes to Upwork clients who require NDAs:\n\n\"The main reason that the client is sending you an NDA is that he thinks he is supposed to have you sign an NDA. He read about that somewhere or somebody told him about it.\n\nMost people who ask you to sign an NDA have not even read the NDA themselves. Somebody in the legal department told them to have freelancers sign it. Or they downloaded the NDA off the Internet.\"\n\nBut I see why some companies would want them, even if they are difficult/impossible to enforce globally.\n\nIf I receive an NDA that the client wants me to print, sign and return, I strike through and initial sections I think are irrelevant to the project or touch on my future activities the client has no right or reason to limit. Some clients accept those changes; others send me a new version to sign that doesn't contain the offending sections.\n\nIf I receive an NDA from one of the electronic NDA platforms that includes unreasonable or irrelevant sections, I ask the client to change or delete that text, which I have never gotten pushback on.\n\nRegardless, when I get an NDA that is 8, 10 or more pages long, I assume the client is relatively inexperienced or just plain clueless, which is a big red flag. I am especially careful in defining what the project will and will not include, hoping to head off any potential for \"misunderstandings\" or other foolishness once the project begins.\n\nI have only once refused to work for a client whose lawyer would not agree to changes to his overlong/over-reaching NDA, which the lawyer apparently was paid to create on a per word basis. I guess he didn't want the client to realize he'd overpaid for the lawyer's verbosity.\n\nDepends of the line of work.\n\nI never sign NDA's in my line of work. Every venture or start-up coming at me to sign a stack of papers for whatever ridiculous reason that I am going to leak their concept or business model or anything related to is a nutcase.\n\nI also say that do not come with that ridiculous stuff to VC firms or PE funds because they will just throw it in the bin, take a good look at you and you can forget about any future conversation.\n\nSimply because we don't sign them. It would be a massive conflict in our line of work why we sign them. Because we look at most times at similar models and deals at the same time. So I tell them to take it with them.\n\n95% of them understand why i do not sign them. the other 5% is still desperately looking for someone to sign it and help them.\n\nThat said,\n\nin many cases, an NDA is easy to break and is not stopping most people to move on with their lives or jobs.\n\nin many cases, an NDA is applicable for most industries and gives so many smaller entities a false sense of feeling. Unless you are in the same country, same city etc, there is just no problem.\n\nNothing will prevent you from behind your desk in a different country to talk about their things to person A B C.\n\nSimply because, whenever a startup or business comes to me with an idea or an actual IP or whatever unique model. I guarantee you, at least 8 other people around the world are trying to do the same or have it already.\n\nSign the NDA, if nothing goes against you and you see no immediate threat to your professional career, and it will establish a good start in a relationship with a client.\n\nDO not sign it, if they're too ridiculous or too stupid in their terms and conditions.\n\nre: \"In general terms, if a stranger on the internet is going to do some work for me, I would want some documentation to coorborate who is signing the nda.\"\n\nOkay.\n\nBut an NDA that you ask a stranger on the Internet to sign is largely unenforceable.\n\nMany clients don't worry about it.\n\nThe majority of freelancers who are hired by clients on Upwork are never asked to sign an NDA.\n\nThe majority of clients I work for on Upwork don't ask me to sign an NDA. But many DO ask me to sign an external NDA. In 7 years, I have been asked to sign dozens of NDAs. But that is out of hundreds of jobs.\n\nI definitely did NOT modify how I worked on any project based on any external NDA I signed. I ALREADY accord my clients the highest possible levels of security, privacy and non-disclosure. I don't need any additional contract OR Upwork's default contract language for me to do that. That is what any true professional would do.\n\nre: \"My question is this: does Upwork's portal and user agreement make this unnecessary?\"\n\nYes.\n\nUpwork's portal and user agreement make this unnecessary.\n\nUpwork's default contract language already contain the same stipulations as a standard NDA. So an additional NDA is superfluous. And Upwork already confirms the credentials of freelancers through its multiple identity verification protocols.\n\nre: \"I mean, whats to prevent a freelancer to signing an NDA with fake credentials?\"\n\nA freelancer you meet on the Internet could do that whether he is working through Upwork or otherwise."
