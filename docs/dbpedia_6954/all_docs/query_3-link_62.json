        "text": "How to Get Auto Insurance for Teen Drivers\n\nFinding the right car insurance for teenagers is crucial for both peace of mind and financial protection. While auto insurance for teens can be pricier due to their lack of driving experience, GEICO is here to help you find the right car insurance rates for your new driver.\n\nAs parents and young drivers navigate the roads together, understanding the unique considerations and options available can make all the difference. From exploring coverage tailored to inexperienced drivers to accessing resources aimed at promoting safe driving habits, our insurance solutions are designed to support teens and their families every mile of the journey.\n\nSave on Car Insurance Cost for Teens and Young Drivers\n\nGEICO DriveEasy\n\nDriveEasy offers discounts on car insurance premiums by monitoring safe driving habits through the GEICO mobile app.\n\nDriveEasy tracks the driving habits of every enrolled insured and rewards safe driving habits with a discount (all eligible drivers must enroll).\n\nDrivers are eligible for a discount of up to 10% simply for enrolling in the program and monitoring their driving.\n\nAfter the monitoring period, drivers who demonstrate safe driving habits can receive a discount that exceeds 10%.\n\nJoin the 260,000+ teen drivers that have enrolled in DriveEasy already, 75% of which received a discount after renewal!\n\nOther GEICO Discounts\n\nCar insurance for new teen drivers can be costly due to their limited driving experience and higher accident rates. You can save money by adding your licensed teen to your existing car insurance policy and extending your coverage to them.\n\nYour young driver could also qualify for these money-saving discounts.*\n\nGood student discount-available when you maintain a \"B\" average or better. Teenage drivers can get up to 15% off on certain coverages.\n\nGood driver discount-available if you have not been in an accident within the last 5 years. Teenage drivers can save up to 22% on most coverages.\n\n*Discounts available in most states.\n\nReduce Teen Active Distracted Driving\n\nData collected from drivers shows teens spend 55% more time directly handling their phone while driving! Work with your teen to improve their safe driving skills by reducing their distracted driving time.\n\nAvoiding active distraction is simple. Avoid the handheld use of your phone at all times when driving\n\nReplace active distraction habits with a handsfree alternative like:\n\nAnswering calls through a Bluetooth enabled device\n\nControlling music and GPS through the voice activated assistant in your car or phone\n\nUtilizing steering wheel controls for music and phone call activities\n\nEnabling Apple CarPlay or Android Auto if available\n\nTips for parents of new teen drivers\n\nDiscuss when, where, how, and who your teen can drive\n\nDiscuss limiting the number of passengers in the car\n\nTry to establish a curfew\n\nInsist your driver (and passengers) wear seat belts at all times\n\nLimit teen driving during high-risk times, like Friday or Saturday nights\n\nSet driving-area limits\n\nProhibit driving under the influence—or riding with friends who are\n\nHow much is car insurance for teens and new drivers\n\nCar insurance for teens and new drivers tends to have higher premiums because younger drivers statistically pose higher risks.\n\nTeenage car insurance premiums are also impacted by whether they purchase a separate policy or are added to an existing one. When teens are added to policies as drivers, they can typically secure lower rates.\n\nFactors that influence the cost of insuring a teen driver\n\nWhen determining insurance premiums for teen drivers, GEICO considers individual factors such as age, driving record, and type of vehicle. However, we offer discounts and personalized solutions to help mitigate expenses and ensure comprehensive coverage for your teen.\n\nWill the rate drop as my teen gets older?\n\nWhile rates typically decrease as teen drivers gain experience and reach milestones like turning 25, individual circumstances vary. Factors like driving record, vehicle type, and coverage choices influence rate adjustments. Maintaining a clean driving record and completing driving courses can help lower premiums over time.\n\nHow to Add a Teen Driver to your Car Insurance\n\nFor parents, it's important that your teen driver has the proper amount of car insurance coverage before they get behind the wheel. Luckily, adding them to your auto insurance policy is easy. It may also be cheaper than getting them a new policy of their own. Contact a GEICO agent when your teen gets their permit or driver's license to get a quote for a new driver on your policy.\n\nMoving a Teen or Young Driver to Their Own Policy\n\nGEICO makes it easy to move a teen or young driver to their own auto insurance policy. We can apply discounts they qualify for and give them the benefit of their experience on an existing policy. They'll also continue getting the same great customer service. We are here to help—from making a policy change, filing a claim, or even just asking us a question.\n\nWhen adding a teen driver to your policy, your existing car insurance coverage extends to them. To ensure adequate protection for every driver’s unique circumstance, you can differentiate your coverage based on the vehicle your teen driver uses. Older vehicles, for example, typically carry lower coverage limits to reduce costs, while newer vehicles typically have higher limits. With GEICO, you can confidently insure multiple drivers while staying within budget.\n\nChoosing the Right Car Insurance for Teens and New Drivers\n\nConsider the type of car: Young drivers are inexperienced and should never be allowed to drive high-performance cars. Keep in mind, too, that insurance costs are lower on more conventional vehicles.\n\nReview your deductible: This applies to all drivers, not just young teen drivers. Increasing deductibles, which results in sharing a greater portion of any comprehensive or collision loss, can reduce auto insurance premiums. Again, check with insurers to find out exactly how much is saved by increasing the deductible from, say, $200 to $500 or even $1,000.\n\nDrop some coverage: Consider dropping collision and comprehensive coverage for an older car, your teenage driver might be using. Policies will only cover the current value of the car.\n\nEducating Parents and Teen Drivers\n\nExperience helps teen drivers stay safe on the road. Experience also helps share a responsible attitude about driving. Responsible driving could help keep your car insurance rates low. We've compiled some helpful resources to get teens and parents started.\n\nSafety Resources for Teen Drivers\n\nTeen Drivers channel on You Tube: Subscribe for safety videos for and about teens.\n\nTeen Driving Resources: Find brochures, presentations, and a parent-teen contract for educating teens and parents on the challenges facing young drivers.\n\nIIHS Teen Driver Info: The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has information and statistics about graduated licenses, safe cars, and more.\n\nAre you a distracted driver?: From cell phones to eating your lunch, distracted driving is common and dangerous. Think you know how to drive and multi-task? Read on for tips that might surprise you.\n\nParents' Role in Teen Safety: Tips to help parents shape a responsible driving attitude for their teen driver.\n\nReducing the Cost of a Teen Driver: Recommendations to help parents watch costs with a new teen driver.\n\nCar Insurance and Accidents"
