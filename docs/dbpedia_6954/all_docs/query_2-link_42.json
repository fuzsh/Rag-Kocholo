        "text": "The Temptations are always on the Top\n\nMy personal favorite song from The Temptations is \"Standing on the Top.\" This hit record features Rick James and 7 men who performed with the group at one time or another. These were 8 talented men who set their egos aside to produce a record and video that thrilled the world. Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Glen Leonard, Richard Street, Eddie Kendricks, David Ruffin, and Dennis Edwards were all on hand but there was one man who was missing. Baritone singer and choreographer. Paul Williams, the brother of founder Otis had passed away years before.\n\nPaul was noted for being one of the founding members and the original lead singer of the Motown group, His career began with Elbridge \"Al\" Bryant, Otis, and fellow Alabamians Eddie Kendricks and Melvin Franklin, The Temptations were born. Williams was forced to retire from the world-renowned group in 1971 due to health issues. The following is what took place along the way.\n\nPaul Williams made his mark\n\nWilliams sang lead on several of the group's songs and was the main lead singer during the group's early years. His early leads included, the group's first single \"Oh, Mother of Mine\" and \"Your Wonderful Love\" both in 1961 \"Slow Down Heart\" (1962), \"I Want a Love I Can See\" (1963), and \"Farewell My Love\" (1963), The last two were shared with Eddie Kendricks. Williams was considered the best dancer and served as the group's original choreographer.\n\nHe devised routines for The Temptations and also the Supremes (most notably their trademark \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" routine), Williams' later leads on Temptations songs include, \"Just Another Lonely Night\" (1965), \"No More Water in the Well\" (1967), and a cover version of \"Hey Girl\" (1969).\n\nWilliams was often overlooked\n\nPaul Williams's role as lead singer for The Temptations began being eclipsed around 1965 by Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin who had both sung lead on Temptations hit singles. This led to Williams being over looked for lead songs and this included album tracks and B-sides of recordings. His response was \"shit, I can sing too!\" and shortly after was given lead vocals in 1965 on the song, \"Don't Look Back\". When Dennis Edwards joined the group in 1968 Williams shared leads with him on Cloud Nine which won the group their first Grammy. When David Ruffin left the group Williams began singing lead on My Girl.\n\nPaul Williams suffered from sickle-cell anemia, which frequently wreaked havoc on his physical health. Cholly Atkins' presence now made Williams' former role as choreographer essentially non-existant, As he began the choreography for The Temptations it decreased Williams's role. Life on the road led Paul to alcoholism when previously he drank nothing stronger than milk. His brother Otis Williams once said \"So to see a guy come from drinking milk to drinking, sometimes, two to three fifths of Courvoisier a dayâ€”that was kind of hard to take.\n\nHelth problems increased\n\nBy 1969 Williams health had deteriorated to the point that he would be suffering from combinations of exhaustion and pain which he combated with heavy drinking. This made him unable to perform and each of the other four Temptations did what they could to help him. They took turns raiding and draining his alcohol stashes, tried personal interventions, and keeping oxygen tanks backstage for the singer. Williams refused medical assistance and his health. as well as his voice, continued to decline. This is when Richard Street was hired to sing all of Paul William's leads from back stage.\n\nEventually Richard Street took over for Paul Williams because of his deteriorating condition. In April 1971, the singer finally agreed to see a doctor. and a spot was found on his liver. Street officially became one of the Temptations and Williams was paid his one-fifth share of the group's royalties, in the hopes that he would get back on his feet. Paul remained on the payroll as an advisor and choreographer for the next two years.\n\nThe beginning of the end\n\nWilliams embarked on a solo career for Motown in early 1973. Eddie Kendricks, who had quit the Temptations shortly before Williams made his exit produced and co-wrote Paul Williams' first single, \"Feel Like Givin' Up\", but Motown decided not to release the single. On August 17, 1973, the singer was found dead inside a car parked in an alley. He had just left the new house of his then-girlfriend after they had an argument.\n\nHis death was ruled as an apparent suicide as a gun was located next to his body. His brother Otis Williams has confirmed that Paul had expressed suicidal thoughts to him and also to Melvin Franklin months before he died. Paul Williams's funeral was held on August 24, 1973, with his family and former bandmates in attendance. He was survived by his wife, Mary Agnes Williams, and five children: Sarita, Kenneth, Paula, Mary, and Paul Jr. P Williams also had three other children, Paul Williams Lucas, Anthony Johnson, and Derrick Vinyard, with three different women.\n\nThe Williams family suspected that foul play was the actual cause of Paul's death because of questionable circumstances. According to the coroner, Williams had used his right hand to shoot himself on the left side of his head. The gun used in the shooting was found to have fired two shots, only one of which had killed Williams. A bottle of alcohol was found near the singer's left side as if he had dropped it while being shot by someone other than himself. To this day the facts have not come to light. Paul Williams was only 34 years of age to have gone through so much."
