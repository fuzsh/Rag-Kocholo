        "text": "If you’ve been keeping up with internet memes on social media, or do your fair share of social media scrolling, you may have come across a video of the Chinese man commonly known as 蛋哥 (dàn gē) - the “Eggman”.\n\nHe has recently become an international internet sensation, at the same time repopularizing a Chinese song from back in the ‘80s, called 一剪梅 (yì jiǎn méi) - A Spray of Plum Blossoms. The song is also commonly referred to by one of it’s main lines, “Xue Hua Piao Piao (Bei Feng Xiao Xiao)”.\n\nYou can check out Yangyang’s recent cover of this famous song here!\n\nBe sure to read until the end to learn about a fun contest we’re having as well!\n\nHow It All Started\n\nIt all began when he uploaded a short clip of himself singing part of the song while outside in the snow, and along with the reposting and remixes of the clip on several different platforms, it gained immense popularity.\n\nThe man’s name is Aiqin Zhang, a director, actor and movie producer in Beijing, China. He started from humble beginnings, doing odd jobs until entering the entertainment industry a little over 10 years ago, and his clip singing the traditional Chinese song in the snow is a breath of fresh air for many people in the chaos that is 2020.\n\nMeaning of the Hit Line\n\nThe line of 雪花飘飘，北风萧萧 (xuě huā piāo piāo běi fēng xiāo xiāo) literally means “snowflakes falling and the north wind howling”, though its extended meaning about life in general very accurately describes the feelings we all have about the year 2020.\n\nThe line resonates well with people in 2020, carrying the following meaning:\n\n“Life has reached a low point, and our environment has gradually deteriorated, but it’s hard to change.”\n\nSome people say that this is a manifestation of \"mourning culture\". Young people from all over the world have expressed the difficulties and frustrations they have encountered in 2020, but with a relaxed “What can you do?” mindset.\n\nFacing these hardships isn’t easy, all we can do is try our best to learn from our experiences and try to handle these situations with a “can-do” attitude, one step at a time.\n\nAn International Hit\n\nMr. Zhang’s video was reposted across several social media platforms, including Tik Tok and Youtube, and soon started trending, becoming an international hit! One of the most popular remixes of his video, posted under the account “Goated Beats” on Youtube, has over 6 million views!\n\nI’ll admit - the remix is pretty catchy!\n\nCheck it out here:\n\nSince the clip went viral, so has the original version of the song, 一剪梅 (yì jiǎn méi) - A Spray of Plum Blossoms, by Taiwanese singer 费玉清 (fēi yù qīng) - Fei Yu Qing, which has been trending on Spotify and Youtube over the past few weeks.\n\nVideo Contest Details\n\nDue to the popularity of the song and Mr. Zhang’s video, we wanted to share the full lyrics of the song, so you can sing along and join our contest!\n\nMake a video of yourself singing the song and send it to info@yoyochinese.com for a chance to win lifetime access to a free Yoyo Chinese course of your choosing!\n\nThe deadline to send in your video is Monday, July 27th, so don't wait! Join the contest now!\n\nBy the way, you can watch the original video from 费玉清 (fēi yù qīng), with over 17 million views on Youtube, here:\n\nLyrics\n\nTitle:\n\n一剪梅\n\n(yì jiǎn méi)\n\nA Spray of Plum Blossoms\n\nSinger:\n\n费玉清\n\nfēi yù qīng\n\nFei Yu Qing\n\n真情像草原广阔\n\n(zhēn qíng xiàng cǎo yuán guǎng kuò)\n\nTrue love is vast like a grassland\n\n层层风雨不能阻隔\n\ncéng céng fēng yǔ bù néng zǔ gé\n\nIt cannot be separated by layers and layers of wind and rain\n\n总有云开 日出时候\n\nzǒng yǒu yún kāi rì chū shí hòu\n\nThere will be a time when the clouds go away and the sun shines\n\n万丈阳光照耀你我\n\nwàn zhàng yáng guāng zhào yaò nǐ wǒ\n\nA thousand meters of sunlight will shine on you and me\n\n真情像梅花开过\n\nzhēn qíng xiàng méi huā kāi guò\n\nTrue love blossoms like plum blossoms do\n\n冷冷冰雪不能淹没\n\nlěng lěng bīng xuě bù néng yān mò\n\nCold snow and ice cannot submerge it\n\n就在最冷\n\njiù zài zuì lěng\n\nAt its coldest\n\n枝头绽放\n\nzhī tóu zhàn fàng\n\nThe tips of its branches blossom\n\n看见春天走向你我\n\nkàn jiàn chūn tiān zǒu xiàng nǐ wǒ\n\nSpring is in sight, approaching you and me\n\n雪花飘飘北风萧萧\n\nxuě huā piāo piāo běi fēng xiāo xiāo\n\nSnowflakes falling and the north wind howling\n\n天地一片苍茫\n\ntiān dì yí piàn cāng máng\n\nThe world is boundless\n\n一剪寒梅\n\nyì jiǎn hán méi\n\nA spray of winter plum blossoms\n\n傲立雪中\n\nào lì xuě zhōng\n\nStanding proudly in the snow\n\n只为伊人飘香\n\nzhǐ wèi yī rén piāo xiāng\n\nIts fragrance only wafts about for her\n\n爱我所爱无怨无悔\n\nài wǒ suǒ ài wú yuàn wú huǐ\n\nI love who I love, without regrets\n\n此情长留\n\ncǐ qíng cháng liú\n\nThis love will last forever\n\n心间\n\nxīn jiān\n\nIn my heart\n\nWrap Up\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this post and the song as well!\n\nIf you liked learning this song, check out this blog post for some easy-to-learn Chinese songs for every level.\n\nIf you’re just starting out learning Mandarin, be sure to check out our Beginner Conversational Course!\n\nLevel 1 of the course is totally free, with over 40 lesson videos and tons of study tools.
