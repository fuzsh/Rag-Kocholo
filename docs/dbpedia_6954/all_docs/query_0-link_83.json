        "text": "Student? Heh, it really is a strange form of address. How did he do it? She can actually express the stranger so vividly. Oh … Right, isn't he a heartless man? \"Not to mention not seeing him for five days, even if I hadn't seen him for a day, I might have forgotten someone.\" Thank you, Mr. Yu. \" Receiving the envelope, Yaoyao walked down the stage expressionlessly.\n\nShe did not remember what the rest of the ceremony was about to take place. She only felt a dull feeling in her chest.\n\n\"Phew, the ceremony is finally over.\" Walking out of the auditorium, Gong Xiaoman let out a long sigh of relief: \"Yaoyao, that Royal Director is also so handsome, but I feel like I've seen him somewhere before.\"\n\n\"Yaoyao? Are you listening to me? \"\n\n\"Xiaoman, I have something to tell you.\" Yaoyao suddenly stopped in her tracks.\n\n\"What is it? Why is your expression so serious?\"\n\nShould I tell Xiaoman? But wasn't Xiaoman her best friend? She shouldn't keep it a secret from Xiaoman. She bit her lips and slowly said: \"Xiaoman, actually that Royal Director is …\"\n\n\"Hey, junior.\" Four senior year male students surrounded Yaoyao and Gong Xiaoman.\n\nShe nervously pulled Gong Xiaoman's hand, \"Senior, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing. Senior just wants to ask, do you have a boyfriend?\"\n\nGong Xiaoman glared at the unruly seniors and said coldly: \"Of course we Yaoyao have boyfriends. Senior, you should give up on that idea!\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" I was talking to her. \" Saying that, one of the yellow-haired seniors wrapped his arm around Yaoyao's shoulders.\n\n\"Let me go, let me go!\"\n\n\"Hey, senior, I advise you to quickly release Yaoyao, otherwise we will complain to the student union about you!\"\n\n\"What a spicy little girl, I've fallen for you.\" Another slightly fat senior looked at Gong Xiaoman.\n\n\"Ha, like me? If you don't look at your morals, are you even worthy of it? \"\n\n\"Hey, girl, do you know what you're saying?\"\n\n\"Of course I know.\"\n\n\"Damn it!\" You're looking for a fight, aren't you? \" After saying that, the fat senior raised his hand.\n\n\"Stop!\" Yaoyao shook off the yellow hair in her arms and took a step forward to grab the fat man who was about to hit Gong Xiaoman.\n\n\"Ai, junior, you are mine. Don't run around.\" The blonde tightly hugged her from behind.\n\n\"Let go, save …\" Just as she was about to shout out loud, that yellow hair covered her mouth. \"Junior sister, it's useless. My name is Lu Chuan, you can ask around in this school to find out who I am, even if you scream your head off, no one will care about this. \"\n\nSeeing that Yaoyao was in trouble, just as Gong Xiaoman was about to go forward to rescue him, she was also entangled tightly by the fat senior.\n\nWhen the two girls faced off against four burly men, the disparity couldn't help but make them nervous.\n\nYaoyao looked left and right, hoping to find help. Two or three students passed by, but when they saw the direction they were heading in, those students hastened their steps as if they did not see anything.\n\nCould it be that this Lu Chuan is the school's bully? Why was everyone so afraid of her? His helpless eyes fixed on something not too far away...\n\n\"Ugh!\" Ugh! \"Ugh!\" She could clearly see that five meters away, Yu Aotian, Mo Xuetong and the others were slowly walking in their direction.\n\n\"Lu Chuan, what do we do? That seems to be the board member.\" The fat senior also felt that something was wrong.\n\n\"It's fine, just pretend to be in love.\" Lu Chuan nervously said, and calmly laughed: \"Junior sister, if you dare call me that, I will definitely not let you go.\" He slowly released the hand that was covering Yaoyao's mouth.\n\nJust then, Yu Aotian and the rest walked past them.\n\n\"Help! \"Save me!\"\n\nYu Aotian stopped and coldly turned his head around.\n\nHer arm was grabbed by Lu Chuan, so she could not escape. She could only look at Yu Aotian as if she was trying to save him.\n\n\"Damn it!\" Lu Chuan gritted his teeth as he muttered to himself, his fists tightly clenched and he forced out a smile. \"Be good, don't scare others.\"\n\nShe wasn't afraid of this bully called Lu Chuan pretending to be a couple with her at all. Maybe if others saw him, they wouldn't think too much about it, but he was Yu Aotian, so he definitely knew what was going on.\n\n\"Save me!\" Yaoyao's eyes were filled with anticipation, but...\n\nYu Aotian turned his head around emotionlessly, and kept one hand in his pocket as he walked forward.\n\nShe didn't think that Yu Aotian would just sit there and do nothing. Even if he was still angry over what happened last time, he would probably ask a few questions even if he saw a stranger being surrounded by thugs, right? \"Why is it that he can act so emotionless as soon as he arrives at her place?\" Yu Aotian! Yu Aotian! \"\n\nBehind him, Yaoyao's shouts unceasingly sounded. Mo Xuetong coldly turned around to look at him, \"Ao Tian, do you really not care?\"\n\nThe hand that was in his pocket tightened a fist, his deep eyes flashed, and he sinisterly said: \"Leave it to the people from Imperial Dragon Society to settle this.\"\n\n\"Yes sir!\"\n\n\"Junior, stop calling me that. Even Royal Director thinks that we're a couple now. Who do you think will save you?\"\n\nHearing Lu Chuan's sarcastic remarks, Yaoyao bit her lips in anger. \"Yu Aotian, I hate you!\" I hate you!\n\n\"Junior, let's get along. Don't worry, I'll treat you well.\" Lu Chuan laughed sinisterly, he extended his hand and lifted her chin, and slowly kissed his.\n\nNo expression, no struggle. Her mind was already elsewhere.\n\n\"Yaoyao? Yaoyao? \" Gong Xiaoman saw that the situation was bad and anxiously shouted for her.\n\nBut Yaoyao still had no reaction, as if she had sealed herself.\n\nJust as Lu Chuan was about to kiss her lips …\n\n\"Take your dirty hands away!\" A cold voice rang out.\n\nLu Chuan looked over nervously.\n\n\"Qilian Toyun!\" Damn it, why is he here?\n\n\"Hey, Lu Chuan, are you messing with your junior again? \"You've already shouldered two punishments, are you really waiting for the school to expel you?\" The lady beside Qilian Toyun opened her mouth.\n\n\"Tsk, thank you for your reminder, Vice President Gu Xiaoming.\" However, which eye of yours has seen me teasing junior sister? \" After he finished speaking, Lu Chuan smiled and let go of his hand, and the fat senior also let go of Gong Xiaoman.\n\n\"Lu Chuan, do you think I'm blind …\"\n\n\"Forget it, Little Ming.\" Qilian Toyun stopped Gu Xiaoming from speaking and slowly walked to Lu Chuan's front: \"I don't wish for another time, scram!\"\n\nObviously, Lu Chuan was afraid of Qilian Toyun, after he finished speaking, Lu Chuan unwillingly clenched his fists and left with his tail between his legs.\n\n\"Thank you, Senior Qilian.\" Gong Xiaoman had completely forgotten about his nightmare as he looked at Qilian Toyun with an infatuated expression. Only the heavens knew how infatuated he was with her, speaking to Lu Chuan with such an overbearing tone.\n\n\"Hehe, you're too polite.\" Qilian Toyun laughed gently. Her gloomy eyes could not help but turn to the expressionless Yaoyao, and helplessly shook her head. \"Why are you always so down and down every time I see you?\""
