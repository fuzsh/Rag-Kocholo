        "text": "ü§ùü§ù As I conclude my tenure at Dyson after nearly nine years, I find it important to convey a message that reflects the range of emotions during this period of transition. The recent organizational changes have been challenging, particularly for many colleagues and friends globally, including here in Canada, who have been affected by redundancies. In light of this, I kindly request the support of my network in sharing opportunities that I can pass along to those interested. More specifically networking opportunities and roles across various critical areas within organizations, such as sales, marketing, finance, supply chain, commercial leadership, engineering, and others. üì¢üì¢ Initially, I had prepared an email draft expressing gratitude to my Dyson colleagues, but given recent developments, I feel it is fitting to share my sentiments here. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge those who have significantly contributed to making my journey at Dyson truly memorable. As many will embark on new opportunities, I am optimistic about the future. And for those who remain at Dyson, where the relentless spirit of problem-solving and innovation always prevails, I am confident there is a bright future ahead. üôèüôè I am especially thankful for the leadership, friendship, and mentorship of Chandra Colbear throughout my time at Dyson. I extend my gratitude as well to all my past and current immediate team, Katie Murray and Dayna Marshall, and countless others who have evolved from colleagues to lifelong friends. I eagerly anticipate staying connected and witnessing your continued personal and professional growth. üöÄüöÄ In the immediate future, I plan to take a brief respite with loved ones, before pursuing new aspirations inclusive of venturing into entrepreneurial endeavors. Keep an eye out for a call to action to collaborate in new and exciting territory.\n\nI worked at Nike I worked at eBay I worked at AT&T I worked at Ramsey And you wanna know something? They‚Äôre all the same. Different, but the same. They have their own personality and culture, but at the end of the day, they‚Äôre all groups of people just trying to make something happen. They‚Äôre all concerned with what the competition is doing. They all deal with the same struggles that come with trying to get hundreds or thousands of people moving in the same direction. They‚Äôre all filled with people trying to navigate the internal systems and processes, and live by (or redefine) the company‚Äôs spoken and unspoken rules. But you know what? They‚Äôre also all places where people can thrive‚Ä¶ if they choose to. The people who thrived at each of these organizations were those who had strong agency, believed in the company‚Äôs mission, and were willing to lean into their role, and reached beyond their role. They were the people who brought their best every day and felt like they were part of something bigger than themselves. The people who look forward to Mondays are the people who view the problems at their organization as something to be faced head on. They‚Äôre people on a mission. It‚Äôs not the quiet quitters. It‚Äôs not the people looking for work-life balance. It‚Äôs the people who embrace being fully present at work and fully present at home. The people who bring their entire selves to work, and hold fast to their integrity. They‚Äôre the people who build up their teammates, don‚Äôt care who gets the credit, and just want to leave the place in a better state than they found it. These are my people. These are the people I want to connect with, spend time with, encourage, teach, and learn from. These are the people I want to walk alongside. Here‚Äôs to all the hard working, growth minded, ideal team players out there who haven‚Äôt given up on the idea that work can be rich and fulfilling. Here‚Äôs to you, thriving at work!\n\nA year ago today, I thought I had officially hit the peak of my career. It was announced that we (Digitas North America) had won our pitch to LVMH, which simultaneously felt like a dream come true after all the hard work, late nights, and invigorating creative moments (and it is genuinely my dream company to work for) while also feeling very much like the bittersweet conclusion, as I knew I would not be continuing to officially onboard this incredible new client. However, two days later I realized that I had received the greatest promotion of my career. Under my new title, mom, I found that my career wasn‚Äôt over. My skills of organization, time management, creative problem solving under pressure, and training/teaching were just given a new challenge and opportunity for me to level up. Returning to work after my maternity leave, I have found myself bursting at the seams with growth and feeling so ready to continue to level up. I got lucky (or maybe I made my own luck) in that I was able to work for that dream client, building their audiences, for a small stint while transitioning back, before rolling on full time to another pretty incredible team serving another extraordinary client, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company . I used to think that life and work were in competition. That was why you need to \"balance\" in the work/life arena. But in reality, work is part of life and growth in life is a part of growth in the workplace. These are not competing parts of ourselves, but rather an integrated apparatus from which we form our whole selves. Do not fear growth in any area of your life. Let it lead you forward in all aspects of yourself. #inspiration #careergrowth #growthmindset\n\nI've been working at Nike for sixteen years. This summer, I am reflecting back on what I have learned and sharing in the hope that it helps you on your path. Learning One: You will miss the people deeply when they are no longer around. When you begin your career it is easy to see those around you as fixed, static, ones who will always be there. Yet that‚Äôs not how it will be. There will come a time when you will change jobs, leave, move, or retire. And so will they. What seems normal now, saying hi as you walk in the building, past a desk, or on the Zoom will be a distant memory. You will both evolve, and their influence on you will help you as you experience something similar ahead‚Ä¶ or when you see someone who has. But that isn‚Äôt fully the point. As Andy Barnard from the Office put it, ‚ÄúI wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.‚Äù I miss so many of my former teammates, and I am so grateful for the way they have collectively shaped who I am today. If I could go back, what would I do? I‚Äôd keep a journal. In that journal I would reflect on the people who made a difference in my journey, while it was happening. I‚Äôd use that as a reason to keep in touch better, even when they weren‚Äôt on my team, in my city, or at my company. What about you? How do you keep in touch with incredible people you meet on tbe way? #careers #thoughtleadership #learning\n\nAs we head into Thanksgiving weekend, I am taking a moment to reflect on all the ways I am thankful and grateful for the work I have the opportunity to do every day. I have so many reasons to love recruiting, but I think most of all, I truly love the opportunity to help people. Help people find their dream job. Help people navigate what can be a challenging job search/career landscape. Help people realize their potential. Help people learn/hone interview skills. Help people with constructive feedback. Help teams find amazing talent. I think the second think I love about recruiting is how much I get to learn on a daily basis. I get to learn about different aspects of a complex business by working with different groups, functions and candidates. I get to continuously learn about best practices, new technologies, and most of all, I get to learn about myself and all the areas I am growing in. Grateful for VF Corporation and the amazing teams I get to work with. Happy Thanksgiving ü¶É üß° ! #dailyinspiration #grateful #recruiting #talentacquisition\n\n\"You are not just a UMC, but an embodiment of ambition and potential‚Äù, that‚Äôs how I embrace my new path in Uniqlo as my journey doesn‚Äôt only change my wardrobe but also my life. I had left my home to pursue a degree abroad, living on a tight pocket money just enough to get by. Uniqlo, the tech-fashion giant, has always been my dream company, even though my closet was devoid of their stylish garments. All day studying as an Engineer & freelancing as a Digital Artist never dampened my determination to be a part of Uniqlo, but not as a Top Spender, yet as a Business Leader within this organization. One day, stumbled upon a job posting that seemed tailor-made for my aspirations - UMC program. The role was challenging, with high expectations, but I poured my heart and soul into each selection stages. The period was a rollercoaster. Days felt like weeks, and uncertainty clouded my thoughts. Then, an email I had been eagerly waiting for finally \"Congratulations!\" Ecstasy washed over me like a tidal wave as I realized that I, who was once only be able to window shop at Uniqlo, now am on the path to becoming a Leader within the company. I finally have not only filled my wardrobe with Uniqlo now also have my heart with a sense of accomplishment that no price tag could ever measure. #UNIQLO #UMCBatch13 #LifeWear #FastRetailing #HR #LifeatUNIQLO"
