        "text": "Founded in late December of 1965, The Daughters of Eve were Chicago’s first fully female rock band. Carl Bonafede was the group’s manager — a DJ as well as the manager of the pop group The Buckinghams, who were formed in the same city that year.\n\nThe Daughters of Eve’s lineup originally consisted of singer and organist Marsha Tomal, lead guitarist and vocalist Judy Johnson, bassist Andrea (Andee) Levin, and drummer Connie, who was shortly replaced by Debi Pomeroy. Levin and Pomeroy were interviewed about their experiences with the band and provide much of the information regarding the group’s history.\n\nHow did this forgotten girl-group come to be?\n\nDebi describes the events that took place leading her to secure a spot in the band. 15 years of age at the time, she was the only girl, a lead guitarist, in a surf band with her boyfriend. Her brother was also in a band, managed by their dad, named “The Dirty Wurds”. The Daughters of Eve’s manager, Carl, had found his lead singer (Marsha) and guitarist (Judy) already, however their drummer Connie had decided not to continue in the group. A friend of Debi’s (named John) was familiar with Marsha and Judy, and one day hearing Debi playing drums with her brother in their basement made her an offer to audition as a drummer for a new all-girl group, which she accepted. She auditioned at Marsha’s house and their manager was so impressed with Debi’s playing that he hired her without hesitation, insisting to her parents that they buy her a drum set. Debi ended up in the band, playing drums rather than guitar, with a drumset identical to Ringo’s (drummer of The Beatles). Her father — a minister dubbed “The Rock ‘N Roll Preacher” — was completely supportive of Debi’s venture, helping her come up with the name for the group and providing a rehearsal space for his children’s bands in the gymnasium of his church.\n\nAndrea was a friend of Debi’s. They met through Debi’s brother and grew to become close friends due to their shared love of folk music. Describing Andrea on the day of their meeting as having long red hair and always wearing black, Debi thought of Andee “Wow, that’s a pretty cool chick.” They soon began playing music together for fun, and another girl named Sue joined them, forming a musical trio. After Debi had secured a position in The Daughters of Eve, one day during rehearsals, Andrea filled in for the missing bassist — though she had never picked up a bass before. Her musical knowledge and experience led her to being a natural at it, and Carl offered her a spot in the band to replace the previous bassist. Andrea had reservations going into it, as she did not consider herself to be a part of the rock ‘n roll scene. However, Carl convinced her parents to let her in and they made the choice for her, though ultimately she stated having no regrets by joining.\n\nThe band kept up with trends when it came to their choice of style. Andrea recalls the first stage outfits bought for the girls as being “…so God awful…”. Debi agreed, describing the clothes they wore: “…just maroon v-neck tops with black cotton turtlenecks under them, and dark green jeans with Beatle boots.” They soon found their desired style, however, indulging in Nehru jackets and suits, hot pants paired with mesh stockings, white mary jane style shoes, and in the late ’60s purple and green bell-bottoms, bright green turtlenecks, and Beatle boots made of suede.\n\nThe Daughters of Eve traveled for two and a half years Midwest, South as far down as Panama City, and North as far as Iron Mountain (MI), playing one-nighters at teen establishments to promote their singles. According to Debi, they traveled in a Dodge van and the girls’ mom’s took turns chaperoning them as they were still underage at the time. Eventually, when trust was built between the parents and Carl, he was put in charge of the care of the girls, acting as a protective older brother to them. Debi did not recall any bad times on the road with her bandmates and manager. She did recall, however, the band’s worst gig: they were in Rapid City (SD), on a stage with no rugs to keep the drums steady and in place. Their roadie suggested Debi put a fire extinguisher in front of the drums to keep them still, which didn’t work, leading her to place it in the bass drum. When she kicked the drum the extinguisher exploded into the audience, and though Debi wasn’t amused the crowd surely was — they cheered believing it was a planned part of the show.\n\nAndrea describes the overall reaction to the band as very positive: “We had a good sound and a good energy, and the audience was always very receptive, just thrilled.” Apart from the group being a novelty as they were one of the only girl-bands around at the time, they had quite a good response from teenagers, specifically boys. Debi compared the band’s effect on those who would swoon over the first all-girl group they’d ever seen to the effect the Beatles had on their crazed girl audiences.\n\nThe Daughters of Eve released 8 tracks in total from 1966 to 1968, all singles.\n\nTheir first was “Hey Lover”, the groovy, melodious song they’ve found fame with in the modern day. The song was written by John Barry, English composer known for his work on some of the James Bond scores, and Don Covay, an American singer-songwriter involved in the rock, soul, and R&B scene spanning the 1950s to 1970s. “Hey Lover” was first recorded by Debbie Dovale in 1963 and a year later by Susan Maughan before the Daughters of Eve covered it in ‘66.\n\n“Stand By Me” is the B-Side to their initial single, a cover of one of Ben E. King’s iconic hits. The band’s original bassist, Andrea Levin, features only on “Hey Lover”, being replaced with Marylou Davidson for their next single “Symphony of (My) Soul”/”Help Me Boy”. “Symphony of (My) Soul” is a jolly love song in which lead vocalist Martha and lead guitarist Judy sing solo in parts and in harmony for its chorus. “Help Me Boy” is a mystical, catchy tune that draws the listener into a world of fantasy — and makes one want to begin dancing. The band also released “Don’t Waste My Time”/ “He Cried” in 1967, featuring Lori Wax rather than Marylou Davidson on bass. In “He Cried”, one can hear both Martha and Judy harmonizing on the vocals, Marsha sings with a low voice and Judy with a high voice. The Daughters of Eve’s final single, released in 1968, was “Social Tragedy”/ “A Thousand Stars”. Though the bassists in the group came and went, Debi recalls playing on all tracks except for “Social Tragedy” and “Symphony of Soul”, which she lists as her favourite of the band’s songs. So well-liked was their music that “Social Tragedy”, a quick upbeat melody highlighting the band’s captivating garage rock/pop sound, overtook the Beatles’ “Lady Madonna” on the radio’s Top 40 hits.\n\nThe Daughters of Eve certainly took inspiration from the popular music acts at the time, ranging from doo-wop artists to psychedelic rock musicians. Attending the concerts of some of these groups and seeing the musicians’ techniques and reception from the fans, surely the girls were influenced in incorporating these artists’ musical styles into their own music. Andrea was a huge lover of folk, listening to records by Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and Peter, Paul, & Mary — practicing until she learned the chords on guitar and could play the songs thoroughly herself. A large part of Andrea’s hesitation to join the band at first stemmed from the idea that she wouldn’t like or be as good at playing rock and roll, reservations which she soon put aside after beginning to play in the group. Debi cites her influences to include Dion & Belmonts, The Four Seasons, Wanda Jackson, Johnny Cash, Harry Belafonte, the Yardbirds, and the Rolling Stones in the early ’60s. Later in the decade, what we now recognise as classic rock took over her interests: Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Vanilla Fudge, Jethro Tull, and The Velvet Underground. Like Andee, a lot of Debi’s inspiration also came from the folk music scene, namely the “Old Town School of Folk Music” artists in Chicago. Despite being a loving fan of the folk genre, Debi picked up the electric guitar to challenge the assumption that girls liked to and could only play acoustic folk music. With the success of The Daughters of Eve, Debi and her bandmates rejected the gender roles assigned to women in music, proving girls could indeed rock out just as well as, if not better than, boys.\n\nThe group was in fact often on the same circuit as the rising rock, folk, and country acts of the time. Debi describes being on a local TV show with folk singer-songwriter Janis Ian around the time her hit single “Society’s Child” was released in 1967. The Daughters of Eve also shared the stage with some such as Neil Diamond, a small artist at the time who would grow to be one of the most well recognised pop artists of the ’60s and ’70s. Another instance involved the band opening for the pop-rock group Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, coincidentally at the Surf Ballroom in Iowa — the same place that Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens were at years before prior to boarding the plane that would ultimately lead to their deaths and would instill a cultural shock in the music world.\n\nThe Daughters of Eve officially broke up in late 1968 as Judy and Marsha got married. Andrea had already left the band after recording one song with them due to her parents’ disagreements with Carl, though she continued pursuing music by joining a funkier Chicago group after The Daughters of Eve. She eventually abandoned her musical career to focus on being a mother and today teaches music in San Jose. Marylou, the group’s second bassist, left the band to pursue an education at college. The band’s third bassist, Lori, today lives in Georgia, while Judy lives in Florida and Marsha in San Diego. In the 1990s the group’s then ex-manager, Carl, tried to get the girls back together, however, the reunion did not end up happening. After the demise of the band, Debi joined diverse bands and was even considered by Kim Fowley, manager of The Runaways — one of the most famous all-girl rock bands of the ’70s — to join the group. She was however deemed “too old” as Fowley wanted a band with only teen-aged girls, an irony as The Daughters of Eve had also rejected an older musician in their day. Today, Debi lives in Los Angeles and has remained friends with Andrea. She hopes to one day release all of the group’s singles on a CD for people of the modern day to discover and enjoy.\n\nThe Daughters of Eve were one of the first all-girl groups to find success and positive attention across America at a time when women in music, especially rock, were fairly looked down upon.\n\nThough after their break-up in 1968 their music had been largely forgotten, their songs have resurfaced in the current decade due to the far reach of social media. The influence of The Daughters of Eve is undervalued, they are a huge inspiration as both an all-female band as well as one that found its roots amongst four teenagers playing rock and roll in a church gymnasium — transforming into a garage-pop-rock band adored by many back then and to this day."
