When the demon first begins to manifest, it torments the cursed person over a prolonged period of time through illusions and various other malicious tricks before moving on to possess them, whereupon it will use the victim's body to commit suicide in front of a nearby witness, who then becomes the demon's next host. Before driving them to suicide, the demon always forces its hosts to wear a sinister, unpleasant smile. Some theories suggest the demon consumes the souls of its victims, adding to its collection of terrible grins in this manner. The demon can alter a person's perceptions to mislead them into thinking they’ve managed to beat it, before resuming the haunting as before. As such, the only way to be rid of this entity is to pass on the curse which carries it on to another person.\n\nIt was portrayed by Marti Matulis, who also portrayed The Apparition from the eponymous movie. The nightmare-mom-version of the entity was played by Kevin Keppy.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nThe Entity has the ability to shape-shift and take on the appearance of any individual nearby, though it usually takes on the appearance of those close to its current victim, such as Rose's mother, Carl Renken, and Dr. Madeline Northcott. The demon’s actual form is much more horrifying, to the point where simply looking at it for a prolonged period will drive a person insane; a tall red humanoid with multiple smiling mouths nested one into another, with beady eyes that are perfectly round. It’s arms are lanky and thin, as are its legs, with long curled fingers upon hands that resemble those of a half-flayed corpse.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWhile not much of its character has been shown, the Smile Entity portrays itself as a malevolent and evil being that appears to find great pleasure in psychologically tormenting its victims, driving them to complete insanity before ultimately making them kill themselves. It has also shown itself to be cunning and deceitful, as well as skilled in imitating other people and making its current host lower their guard through horrific hallucinations, as it had presented itself to Rose as her therapist and had engaged in conversation with her until her real therapist called and the entity revealed itself by smiling.\n\nThe second was when it made Rose believe that she had killed it and lifted the curse off her, leave her mom's old house, and while taking on Joel's form, listened to her until she had realized that it was in fact the entity as soon as it started smiling. It is revealed that she had never left and that it had deceived her, leading to Rose finally snapping and succumbing to possession.\n\nIt is also shown that this entity is highly intelligent and very conniving. First, it infects its hosts which allows it to play mind games in order to fester deeper into the vessel. When the victim has finally broken, the demon possesses them and forces them to kill themselves. It even knew about Rose's chat with Trevor earlier when he selfishly pushed her away during its conversation with Rose when it disguised itself as her old therapist. Meaning it followed her every location Rose went to, taking pleasure out of watching her panic and being rejected by people who selfishly refused to help her, even the ones she trusted. And later was able to trick her into thinking she defeated it but no, and knew Joel would track her down so he'd use him next.\n\nDespite that most people on their own selfishly and foolishly turned their backs on Rose and the Entity's other victims, not listening when they needed them, the Entity's actions turn friends into enemies, changing its victims behavior's, which in the movie made Rose bitter after being pushed away by immature adults. Which made Rose finally insult people back even the ones she trusted, as she tells off Trevor after he cowardly called Madeline for help when its only been a day since she told him what's happening and immediately overreacts to her problem and walked away from her like nothing and then later Holly for comparing Rose's behavior to their late mother, when this situation had nothing to do with her, causing Rose to bitterly call out Holly's selfish childish behavior, and telling her she knows nothing of what happened between Rose and their mom because she selfishly abandoned Rose before she died. Even Rose started being rude to people who never wronged her, even those who actually cared but didn't know what was wrong.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nPowers[]\n\nShapeshifting: The demon can freely shape-shift into any kind of individual at will, as is shown when it appears disguised as Laura, Carl, Stephanie, Holly, Rose's deceased mother, Rose's therapist, and Joel, maintaining the facade until it revealed its true appearance to Rose. It also impersonates the voice of a First Line Security woman when Rose's house alarm goes off.\n\nDemonic Strength: It has been confirmed that the Entity has enough strength to strangle Rose.\n\nFear Inducement: The Entity is intimidating enough to make its victims look at it with immense fear, dread, and trauma. It also uses its intimidation to jumpscare the victim without warning.\n\nPossession: Like most demons, the Entity can possess its victims by simply entering through the mouth to completely take over their bodies.\n\nTrauma Absorption: According to the imprisoned survivor of its curse, it has the ability to feed on trauma to survive.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nCunning Intellect: The demon has been confirmed to be unnaturally clever, it was shown that it tricked Rose into thinking she ended its curse by making her hallucinate.\n\nBiography[]\n\nSmile (2022)[]\n\nThe demon has no true name, nor are its origins clearly explained. All that is known is that it passes from host to host like a virus, seemingly growing stronger with every life it takes. The demon spreads its influence by pushing its victims to suicide in any number of horrific manners, preferring to possess them itself after breaking them mentally and then killing them in an equally gruesome fashion, preferably in front of a witness, who will then become the demon's new host. How long it’s done this, or to how many individuals, remains unknown.\n\nAs Joel, a police detective, explains, there have been over 19 documented suicide cases within the United States alone where the victim has committed suicide in front of someone else. All of the victims claimed to have been tormented by a demonic entity before their deaths, and all were found wearing a sinister smile before killing themselves. The only instances where the curse seemingly \"skipped over\" a victim is when a man named Robert Talley murdered a stranger before a witness. While this allowed him to survive, it consequently earned him a life sentence in prison while the curse passed from him to the witness and continued from there.\n\nRobert learned of the tactic from the only other known person to survive the Smile Entity's curse; a Brazilian man who murdered his neighbor in front of the latter's wife, and this caused the demon to pass over to her. Dr. Rose Cotter, a psychiatrist, was granted the case of Laura Weaver, a Ph.D. student who claimed that she was being haunted by a demonic entity. Laura witnessed her professor, Dr. Muñoz, commit suicide in front of her by bludgeoning himself to death with a ball peen hammer, traumatizing her and, unknowingly, passing the demon to her. After ranting about being followed by a demonic entity that can wear the faces of other people, and pleading to Rose that she's not crazy, she suffers a severe panic attack and insists that the entity is in the room with them, unseen by Rose. The entity possesses Laura's body by crawling into her mouth. As Rose calls the security staff, she notices a smiling Laura slice her face and then her own throat with a shard of a broken pottery. Laura falls to the ground and dies while her corpse is still smiling, as Rose watches on in horror.\n\nFrom there, Rose suffers several supernatural occurrences where she sees Laura and many others smiling at her, as the Entity can take on the appearance of anyone she knows, including her deceased mother and older sister. The Entity makes Rose kill her pet cat mustache, and unknowingly put it into a gift box meant for her nephew Jackson as a birthday gift. The demon also impersonates the voice of a First Line Security woman on the phone when its presence trigger's Rose's house alarm.\n\nHorrified, Rose has a panic attack when the boy opens the box before being attacked by the Smile Entity and crashing through a glass table. She continues to investigate to learn what happened before the deaths of Laura, and her professor, Dr. Muñoz. She visits the professor's wife to find that he had also witnessed a suicide and made made various drawings and artworks of the Entity that terrorized him. She then expands her search, discovering that multiple people had died before Dr. Muñoz., Rose and Joel then go to the state prison to locate and meet with Robert Talley, who reveals to Rose (believing her simply a concerned friend of a cursed victim and not the victim herself) that she must kill another person in front of a witness, as he did in the past, in order to save herself from the curse. When Rose accidentally yelled out in anger and opposition that she can't kill anyone, Robert was horrified to realize that Rose has the curse. Not wanting to take it back and go through it again, he began having a severe panic attack, where he screams at Rose to get away from him before he is restrained by the prison guards.\n\nThe Smile Entity later takes on the appearance of Rose's psychiatrist, Dr. Madeline Northcott. It enters Rose's home and conducting a brief therapy session before revealing itself to her, laughing and telling her that it’s almost time for her. It then attacks Rose by slamming the back of her head into a wall and growling into her face, laughing and drooling as she screams in terror.\n\nRose then returns to the hospital to find someone to kill. She then attempts to kill one of the patients while her boss watches, seemingly succeeding. The Entity then reveals itself to be disguised as her boss, tearing off its face and howling madly. Rose then wakes up in her car, having never entered the hospital at all, with her previous actions revealed to be little more than a dream concocted by the Entity to further break her spirit and mind.\n\nEventually, Rose learns that the Entity is drawn to trauma, feeding off of its victims' past mental anguishes, so she decides to confront her trauma head-on by returning to her old childhood home. Rose fights with what appears to be her mother wearing only a tank top and underwear, confronting her past by revealing that she was frightened of her mother and that, though she loves her, she couldn’t bring herself to help her when she died. The entity smiles, revealing itself, before contorting into a grotesque version of her mother. Rose demands the demon on why it won’t leave her alone, to which it responds: “Because your mind is so…inviting.”\n\nRose flees the demon, but it follows and attacks her. It holds her to the floor and chokes her, growling: “You can’t escape your own mind, Rose.”, only for Rose to retaliate that it that it can’t escape either, before fighting back. After seemingly setting the Entity ablaze, Rose runs from the collapsing house and reunites with Joel asking if she could spend the night with him. Smiling, the entity (disguised as Joel) says that it will stay with her forever.\n\nShocked, she runs out of Joel's apartment only to realize that she never left her old home and that Joel is already there, hoping to help her. It turns out, the Smile Entity had outsmarted Rose and she had fallen right into its trap. She attempts to barricade herself inside the house with the creature to prevent the curse from spreading, only to be confronted by the Smile Entity, who rips off its own face to reveal its true from: a tall, demonic, skinless humanoid entity with multiple contorted mouths nested one within the other, all twisted into a horrifying grin. Frightened to the point of catatonia, Rose collapses, whereupon the demon crawls into her mouth and takes over her body completely. Joel breaks through the door but is forced to watch as Rose covers herself in kerosene and self-immolates, smiling even as she burns.\n\nWhat happened to Joel and the Entity afterwards is unknown. It can be presumed that Joel will eventually fall victim to the Entity's curse, killing himself or killing someone else and passing the demon over to another.\n\nSmile 2 (2024)[]\n\nThe Smile Entity will return in the upcoming sequel. After making Joel kill himself by getting run over by a truck (as first seen in the trailer), he passed to Lewis, who then ran to the room of famous pop star Skye Riley. The demon will then pass the curse onto her by making her watch Lewis hitting himself with a dumbbell plate, killing himself. After this, Skye is threatened by the Entity and her life began to down spiral into disaster.\n\nVictims[]\n\nSeventeen (possibly more) unknown victims\n\nMan at gas station - chest impaled with garden sheers\n\nAngela Powell - eyes gouged out\n\nDr. Gabriel Muñoz - skull bludgeoned repeatedly with a hammer\n\nLaura Weaver - face and throat sliced with a vase shard\n\nMustache (Rose's cat) - killed off-screen\n\nDr. Rose Cotter - doused with kerosene and set on fire\n\nJoel - ran over by a truck (possibly killed)\n\nLewis - face smashed with a dumbbell plate\n\nTotal - 25 (possibly more)\n\nGallery[]\n\nSmile (2022)[]\n\nSmile 2 (2024)[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThere's evidence to support the theory that The Smile Entity is a collector of souls, consuming its victims and adding their souls to its own. In the drawings made by Dr. Muñoz, faces are shown embedded all over its body, heavily implying that it brings its victims' souls into itself after killing them, perhaps as a form of sustenance. Another clue is when The Smile Entity tells Rose that it will stay with her forever, implying that not only did it kill her, but also consumed her.\n\nUnlike typical demons which possess a vessel and attempt to stay with it indefinitely, this demon acts as a type of living virus transferring from one host to the next. It can be assumed that it does this to sustain itself, consuming the souls of its victims for strength and power before moving on to the next target.\n\n[]"
