So I email customer service and there are supposed to get back to you with in 48 hours ( which is a lie I waited almost a week for a response!) they first responded that they would take this to the higher ups and then a few days later one responded that it was a technical error and app should be fixed now, the next rep responded that I violated their terms and was removed because of this. I then proceeded to ask what terms I violated and they responded that they couldnât tell me due to privacy reasons ( so you cant tell me about my own account great). Horrible customer service I called in and a rep with a really heavy accent said something about having my Snapchat info on the bio and deleting my account to make a new one. ( doing that didnât help Iâm blocked so every account I make keeps being disabled ) their reps are incompetent that rep obviously didnât know what a hold button was kept me on hold with no music. And kept giving me the run around. Their follow up is horrible and their communication between reps is as well how does one rep tell me technical issues and the other says violation get if together people. If I could give them 0 stars I would! My sc info was in my bio for years now why didnât you flag a warning and remove the info itâs not that serious. The way this app handles people is ridiculous. STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP PEOPLE!\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHello! It's terrible to hear that you had a bad experience with our app and support. We'll like to hear more about your experience so we can improve things and of course, improve our app. Our email is appreviews@blk-app.com.\n\nCaramelS24 ,\n\nThere are better dating apps with nicer platforms\n\nThis app name is misleading because it allows every race/ethnicity, which wouldnât be a cause for concern if the ânameâ and slogan/headline would be changed. Itâs a bait and switch theme to pander to African American people for âgood ratingsâ. However, like many other things, itâs not about us and not for us. There are better apps such as Facebook dating, Bumble, Match, POF etc., Customer Service? What is that? Whatâs the point of having an app for people to meet if you are doing everything in your power to remove that opportunity. Plus, if you look through the reviews, almost everyone has had the same experience so thousands of people who donât know one another, canât be lying. I hadnât been on this app in almost two years, and thatâs telling enough. They allow predatory behavior, vulgar language, and disrespectful behavior towards people on here. If you report it, nothing will happen! Another hollyweird app.. I wouldnât recommend this app to a dog!\n\nEdit per Apple suggestion: thereâs no need to contact you all when yâall practice is to play games with the exact consumers youâre fishing for. Iâve reached out before with no resolution, so why would I waste my time doing so again? I wouldnât dare recommend yâall to my network, friends, or even people that Iâm passing by. Take a look at all of those reviews and see which entity is playing games, itâs YOU ALL. Good day\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us - we're sorry to hear you haven't been happy with your experience.
