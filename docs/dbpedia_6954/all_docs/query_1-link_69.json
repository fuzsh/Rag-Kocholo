        "text": "Incurable Pain | Chapter 86\n\nOn the morning of the second day of the lunar new year, the two of them drove to the ancient town.\n\nWith nearly five hours of driving, Bai Xunyin felt a bit reluctant to let Yu Luoyin drive alone for so long. She had volunteered to drive for a portion of the journey—however, Yu Luoyin insisted and only allowed her to drive for half an hour.\n\nActually, for a man who was used to standing for over ten hours in the operating room with intense concentration, driving for a few hours was almost enjoyable.\n\nAs they approached noon and arrived at the old mansion in the ancient town, Yu Luoyin remained as energetic as ever.\n\nIt was Bai Xunyin, who wasn’t very keen on staying in cramped spaces, even if she was sitting in the passenger seat, who seemed a bit listless.\n\nCarrying their belongings and holding hands, the two entered the old mansion, where they caught a whiff of fragrance wafting from the courtyard.\n\nBai Xunyin’s delicate nose sniffed, and she said confidently, “Lotus root and chicken stew.”\n\nThis dish was her grandmother’s specialty. Every time she came home, her grandmother would make it for her to eat. Thinking about it now, her stomach, which didn’t feel empty before, inexplicably grumbled.\n\nBai Xunyin pulled Yu Luoyin along and walked quickly inside.\n\nIn the hall of the old mansion, Ji Huiying, with his white hair, was sitting on a peach wood chair reading a newspaper. When he heard movement at the door, he raised his head, and the sharp eyes behind his old glasses widened in surprise.\n\nBai Xunyin walked over quickly, her cool voice tinged with a hint of coquetry, “Grandpa.”\n\nJi Huiying smiled and gently patted the back of the girl’s hand.\n\n“Grandpa, let me introduce you.”\n\nBai Xunyin pulled Yu Luoyin’s wrist, her smile gentle and serene.\n\n“He is Yu Luoyin, my boyfriend.”\n\nFacing this scholarly, slender, and cultured old man, Yu Luoyin quickly said, “Hello, Grandpa.”\n\n“Hmm.”\n\nThe old man didn’t mind Yu Luoyin’s familiar address. He looked Yu Luoyin up and down and said slowly, “Not bad.”\n\nJi Huiying had worked in the Education Bureau for decades and had seen countless people.\n\nWith just one glance, he could tell that Yu Luoyin was not a simple young man—but what did it matter? As long as he saw the love in his granddaughter’s eyes, it was enough.\n\nWith a warm smile on his face, the old man patted the armrest of another chair.\n\n“Xiao Yu, have a seat.”\n\nSoon, Ji Huiying and the grandmother also came out of the kitchen in the inner room.\n\nThe hall, which was originally quiet, became lively with more people.\n\nYu Luoyin wasn’t exactly a very ‘easygoing’ person. From his teenage years to his youth, he seemed polite and courteous on the surface but actually kept people at a distance.\n\nAs long as one didn’t enter his world, the only feeling one could get from him was his coldness, and he never concealed his indifference.\n\nBut facing Bai Xunyin’s family, he poured out all his tenderness, trying to eliminate the vacuum around him as much as possible, revealing only true emotions.\n\nAnd indeed, he truly felt that Bai Xunyin’s little home was even more warm-hearted.\n\nAt least during meals, there were people sharing food with each other.\n\nYu Luoyin’s mood was as placid as it was when he first tasted the dish Ji Huiying made.\n\nOld people usually couldn’t sleep at night, feeling drowsy in the afternoon after meals. After dinner, Grandpa and Grandma naturally went to rest.\n\nJi Huiying was going to play mahjong. Before she left, she asked Bai Xunyin to go to the tailor’s shop to make a qipao.\n\n“You can stay here for a few more days. My cousin’s daughter is getting married on the fifth day of the lunar new year, so we can go together.”\n\nJi Huiying tidied up her hair and spoke softly, “Luoyin can also make a suit to wear.”\n\nAfter Ji Huiying left, Yu Luoyin asked the question in his mind—\n\n“Why make a qipao?”\n\n“It’s a tradition in the ancient town.”\n\nBai Xunyin smiled and gently closed the door of the old mansion, explaining to him as they walked away, accompanied by the crisp sound of the door closing, “When attending important occasions, you should dress a bit more formally.”\n\nActually, this kind of tradition existed everywhere, but many people in this town liked to wear qipaos.\n\nHearing this, Yu Luoyin imagined Bai Xunyin wearing a qipao and suddenly felt excited.\n\n“Okay.”\n\nHis voice carried a hint of eagerness, but his expression remained serious.\n\n“Where is the tailor’s shop?”\n\n…\n\nThere was a well-known tailor’s shop on the East Street of the ancient town, where many experienced craftsmen had been working for many years. Basically, anyone who came to tour would make one or two items to take away.\n\nWhen Bai Xunyin was thirteen or fourteen, she had come back to the ancient town and made a qipao, but it had been many years since she last tried one.\n\nShe had long forgotten how taboo and tempting qipaos could be, enough to make even the most modest gentlemen lose control…\n\nNot to mention Yu Luoyin, this ‘pervert’.\n\nFortunately, it was the off-season for tourism now, and there was only one assistant on duty in the tailor’s shop on the second day of the lunar new year. Although it seemed a bit deserted, trying on clothes was still convenient.\n\nBai Xunyin chose a navy blue qipao and walked towards the fitting room. After a while, she came out and met Yu Luoyin, who was sitting on the bench waiting for her, with a pair of deep eyes.\n\nThose black pupils seemed to be lit with flames, shining brightly.\n\nThere was a ‘thud’ in Bai Xunyin’s heart, and her ears inexplicably felt a bit hot—sometimes she really couldn’t stand Yu Luoyin’s gaze, so invasive, as if he wanted to devour her.\n\nShe uncomfortably pursed her lips, pretending to be indifferent as she turned her back to the man, looking at herself in the mirror, she casually tousled her hair and asked, “Does it look good?”\n\nIn the blue mirror, the woman’s fair skin looked even more tender, her willowy shoulders and slender waist, soft and delicate as if they were not within grasp. The qipao could outline every aspect of a woman’s beauty perfectly, naturally and seductively.\n\nYu Luoyin looked at Bai Xunyin’s slender and graceful figure reflected in the mirror, and the clearly visible Adam’s apple couldn’t help but roll.\n\nIf he were to feel uncontrollably warm, if he were to have crazy thoughts like a naughty kid to press the girl against the mirror and kiss her, then it definitely wouldn’t be because of this qipao—it would be because the person wearing it is Bai Xunyin.\n\n“What a pity.”\n\nThe young man’s clear voice was somewhat hoarse, and he smiled gently, “If this weren’t a public place, with no surveillance cameras…”\n\nThen he might not be able to resist being a ‘Sven scum’*.\n\n*T/N: Well-dressed scum or hooligan\n\nBai Xunyin heard his murmuring and couldn’t help but bite her lower lip and smile.\n\n“Fool.”\n\n“Tsk.”\n\nYu Luoyin stood up and walked to her. The man was almost a head taller than her, and his presence in front of her was quite imposing.\n\nBai Xunyin felt as if she was enveloped in a black shadow. Her pointed chin was gently lifted by the long fingers, and Yu Luoyin’s voice, full of meaning, sounded in her ears.\n\n“Shall we buy a few more to take home?”\n\nThen, we can play however we want, tearing them apart one by one, like an extremely wasteful playboy.\n\nBai Xunyin blinked, fearlessly responding, “Sure.”\n\nActually, she was looking forward to it too.\n\nIn the end, Yu Luoyin, without considering that he hadn’t received his salary as high as Bai Xunyin’s each month, went wild and returned to his past appearance as an extravagant young master, buying eight sets of cheongsams for Bai Xunyin in one go.\n\nHe felt that every color and style would be extremely suitable for his little girl, almost wanting to buy out the entire tailor shop.\n\nThe on-duty assistant was stunned by his lavish appearance, ecstatic to help with the packaging while also thinking that his performance today was enough to make others envious.\n\nWhen Yu Luoyin left with a bunch of packages, he jumped off the steps, as cheerful as a seventeen or eighteen-year-old.\n\nHis messy black hair partially covered his smiling eyes.\n\nBai Xunyin stood on the steps, gazing for a while, feeling her heart pounding.\n\nBecause his carefree appearance was because of her.\n\nSo the young girl tilted her head and thought for a moment before reaching out to him, “Carry me.”\n\nShe rarely acted coquettish or made demands, but once she wanted something, she could be quite demanding.\n\nYu Luoyin smiled and didn’t mind carrying a bunch of stuff himself. In fact, he hadn’t even considered this issue.\n\nThe young man was eager to show his ‘infinite strength’ in front of Bai Xunyin, giving her a secure feeling.\n\nWithout further ado, he walked to her and half-knelt down, “Get on.”\n\nBai Xunyin lowered her eyes to his slender and broad back, slowly bending down and lying on it.\n\nThis road was not easy to walk, so having someone carry her was definitely good, especially since Yu Luoyin’s back felt reassuring.\n\nThe girl wore dark gray jeans, her two long legs swinging gently as the man carried her, feeling relaxed.\n\n“Darling,” Yu Luoyin’s voice remained light and relaxed, still joking with her, “Let’s go to the mountainside tonight.”\n\nBai Xunyin turned her translucent eyes and understood in her heart, “To see the stars, right?”\n\n“Mm.”\n\nYu Luoyin had no idea what a gentleman’s hand was for, lightly pinching her calf, “Didn’t we agree on that before?”\n\nBai Xunyin whispered softly by his ear, “Then you beg me.”\n\nYu Luoyin’s eyebrows lifted in surprise.\n\nThe young girl was unusually compliant and clingy today, almost like an unexpectedly sweet surprise popping out of a candy jar.\n\nIt was a pity to carry her; otherwise, he really wanted to give her a kiss. Yu Luoyin sighed with some regret and then complied with a light laugh, “Alright, I’ll beg you, beg you, Yinyin, accompany me to see the stars, have mercy on me, hmm?”\n\n“Heh.”\n\nBai Xunyin couldn’t help but laugh, biting his earlobe as she turned her head, “Alright.”\n\nThen she kicked her legs, indicating to Yu Luoyin to put her down.\n\n“Hmm? What’s up?”\n\nYu Luoyin stopped by a tree and set her down, “Should I still carry you…”\n\nBefore he could finish his slightly surprised words, his thin lips were covered by a pair of soft lips, the girl’s teeth lightly nibbling, cutting off the words the man wanted to say.\n\nThe young girl launched a sudden attack.\n\n“Nothing else.”\n\nBai Xunyin let go of him, licking her lips, her eyes flashing with a mischievous and wild light, “Just suddenly wanted to kiss you.”\n\nWho says only men like to press against walls and kiss forcefully?\n\nShe was the same; she could press Yu Luoyin against a big tree and kiss him.\n\nIn fact, she wanted to kiss him in the tailor shop just now, but there was no one around, so there was no need to restrain herself.\n\nYu Luoyin looked at the girl’s wild appearance, and a light chuckle escaped his throat uncontrollably.\n\n“A forceful kiss isn’t done like this.”\n\nHe grabbed Bai Xunyin’s slender waist, turning her against the tree while she was caught off guard.\n\nAs he kissed her, Yu Luoyin mumbled, “Let me teach you.”\n\nHere to do on you what the spring does with the cherry trees.\n\n–Pablo Neruda"
