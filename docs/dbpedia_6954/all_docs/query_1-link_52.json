        "text": "Key events\n\nShow key events only\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n\nI reckon I’ll wrap it up there, folks. That was fun, particularly the late-night pool party. Just before I go, in comes a message from Doug Fenner.\n\nWe finally had a GB boxer, in Lewis Richardson, progress. Surely worth mentioning the lad from Colchester.\n\nRichardson defeated Serbia’s Vakhid Abbasov to advance to the quarter-finals of the men’s 71kg category. Up next: Jordan’s Zeyad Eashash.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 00.49 CEST\n\nTom Garry has been taking in Emma Hayes’ strong start with the USA.\n\nShare\n\nAndy Bull, quite brilliantly, lays out the scale of Léon Marchand’s double achievement.\n\nWorld Aquatics even had to rearrange the schedule so Marchand could even try and do it. The races were supposed to run back to back because it simply didn’t occur to them that anyone would try to take both events on, least of all Marchand, who had never competed in the breaststroke at an international championships.\n\nShare\n\nTumaini Carayol was at the Bercy Arena for Shinnosuke Oka’s all-round exhibition.\n\nShare\n\nSome stunning grabs in here.\n\nShare\n\nLéon Marchand’s grin refuses to go away, sticking around for the national anthem too. And who can blame him? Grin away; it’s the best night of your life.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.18 CEST\n\nThose last few minutes have changed the complexion of the medals table.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s swimming: An incredible session takes in another staggering feat, Pan beating his previous world record by four-tenths of a second. Kyle Chalmers takes silver, David Popovici bronze.\n\nShare\n\nPan Zhanle breaks world record to win men's 100m freestyle\n\nTime for the 100m men’s freestyle … and it’s world record time! Pan Zhanle wins by more than a second, clocking 46.40!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.52 CEST\n\nLéon Marchand wins the men's 200m breaststroke - his second victory of the night\n\nMarchand is in lane four, next to Zac Stubblety-Cook, the Olympic record holder in this race. Marchand starts well and leads, and it grows after the 50m turn … he’s threatening the world record. This is history we’re seeing as he closes in … and he wins his second gold medal of the evening! Marchand has to settle for the Olympic record, not the world – that’ll come another time. He clocks 2:05.85. Stubblety-Cook takes silver, 0.94 seconds behind. Caspar Corbeau has bronze.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.50 CEST\n\nMen’s swimming: OK, back to The Marchand Show we go. He’s won the 200m butterfly already tonight; 200m breaststroke next?\n\nShare\n\nMy dad saw it before I did. He saw the potential I had, but my potential wouldn’t have been unlocked without the girls that crossed the line with me today. I’m grateful for everyone who has got me here and he would be very proud if he was here.\n\nLola Anderson’s Olympic glory meant a great deal.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.22 CEST\n\nTom Lutz\n\nWomen’s 3x3 basketball: USA, the defending champions, have now lost both their games in Paris. Losing their opener to Germany was bad enough, but it got worse on Wednesday when they were well beaten by basketball powerhouse, Azerbaijan. It’s not over for the Americans: six of the eight teams in the group stage qualify for the knockout rounds, but on this evidence they’ve got A LOT of work to do.\n\nShare\n\nAs we wait for some more swimming action … here’s the overall leaderboard.\n\nShare\n\nAn email in from Laura, with the excellent subject line of ‘BMXcellent’:\n\nWe’ve been loving the BMX this evening on catch-up. Firm highlights- the skills from “Maligno” Torres, the commentators’ wild enthusiasm.\n\nThe lowlights – the mullets on show, the lack of adequate personal protective equipment, the stinging reminder of a failed cycling proficiency course. Keep up the blog!\n\nShare\n\nHere’s a roundup of the tennis action from today. Andy Murray – refusing to end his one last ride – and Dan Evans will take on Tommy Paul and Taylor Fritz tomorrow in the men’s doubles quarter-finals.\n\nShare\n\nLedecky has medals at four different Games now, reports Bryan Armen Graham. Silly stuff.\n\nShare\n\nKatie Ledecky wins the 1500m women's freestyle ... again\n\nLedecky cruises to her eighth Olympic gold medal, with the real battle for the silver and bronze. There’s plenty of noise as France’s Kirpichnikova claims second and Germany’s Gose third. Ledecky has a new Olympic record, finishing on 15:30.02. She has more than 10 seconds on second place. Sublime.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.42 CEST\n\nWomen’s football: USA beat Australia 2-1 after goals from Korbin Albert and Trinity Rodman. Kieran Pender has more:\n\nShare\n\nWomen’s swimming: And we’re off in the 1500m women’s freestyle final, with Katie Ledecky, world and Olympic record holder, the overwhelming favourite. She’s into the lead quickly.\n\nShare\n\nAnd a bit more reading for you, before the imminent start of the women’s 1500m freestyle.\n\nShare\n\nAs Sarah Sjöström wears her gold medal and stands for the anthem, here’s how she ended up there.\n\nShare\n\nWomen’s football: Late drama in USA’s group clash with Australia …\n\nShare\n\nMen’s swimming: Silly me; I forgot to note that Marchand’s 200m butterfly final effort also saw him claim a new Olympic record, beating Milak’s 1:51:25 from the Tokyo Games.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s tennis: The big-name pairing of Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz have lost in straight sets; the USA pair of Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram bag a 6-2, 6-4 win to advance to the doubles semi-finals.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.15 CEST\n\nMike Hytner\n\nThe heavily fancied duo Mollie O’Callaghan and Shayna Jack failed to get on the podium on the 100m freestyle, in a disappointing start to the evening at the pool for Australia. O’Callaghan, winner of two gold medals already this Games, could not add to her tally, touching home in fourth place. Jack finished in fifth.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.21 CEST\n\nMen’s swimming: Marchand wins with 1:51.21, Milak is second on 1:51.75, and Ilya Kharun of Canada takes bronze.\n\nShare\n\nLéon Marchand wins the men's 200m butterfly\n\nTime for the men’s 200m butterfly and an epic matchup between home star Léon Marchand and Kristof Milak. Milak starts best, holding off Marchand by 0.64secs after 50m. The Hungarian swimmer keeps the lead at the 100m mark, and it doesn’t change at 150m but Marchand stuns at the backend, winning gold to send the crowd absolutely berserk!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.55 CEST\n\nWomen’s swimming: Sweden’s Sjöström wins with 52.16, having been fourth at the 50m mark. Torri Huske takes silver with 52.29, and Hong Kong’s Siobhan Haughey has bronze with 52.33.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.50 CEST\n\nSarah Sjöström wins the women's 100m freestyle\n\nO’Callaghan is in lane three, it’s Walsh who starts well in lane eight. Huske has the lead as we close in, but it’s Sarah Sjöström who takes gold!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.48 CEST\n\nWomen’s swimming: Gretchen Walsh of the USA is the first swimmer out of the tunnel as we get set for the women’s 100m freestyle.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.33 CEST\n\nNot long before the swimming gets going, with the women’s 100m freestyle first up on the schedule. Mollie O’Callaghan took the 200m freestyle gold on Monday and is gunning for another bit of bling.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Japan’s domination of this event continues; Daiki Hashimoto, who won gold in Tokyo, has to settle for sixth after erring on the pommel horse. Joe Fraser finishes fifth, while Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun falls juuust short of a medal.\n\nShare\n\nShinnosuke Oka wins the men's all-round gymnastics final\n\nZhang Boheng finishes up, cueing the anxious wait for the final results … my word it’s nervy. The audience claps away …. and it’s Oka who is the all-round champion. The 20-year-old has gold with 86.832, Boheng trails with 86.599. Xiao Ruoteng has bronze with 86.364.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.44 CEST\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Xiao Ruoteng leaps to the top of the board, extinguishing Jake Jarman’s hopes of a medal. Right then, here comes Shinnosuke Oka, dreaming of gold. “Double twist and double straight,” comes the excited shout from comms as he dismounts … and he scores 14.500 to take the lead! Now time for Zhang Boheng.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s tennis: Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal are down a set to Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram. It’s 1-0 to the Spaniards in the second, with the Americans now serving.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Can Jarman trump Fraser?

Illia Kovtun leads after a fine floor routine.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Joe Fraser steps up to the high bar and pumps the fists after a wonderful routine, scoring 14.266 to finish on 85.532. He scored 84.666 in qualification.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s gymnastics: The numbers before the final rotation.\n\n1. Shinnosuke Oka – 72.332\n\n2. Xiao Ruoteng – 71.998\n\n3. Zhang Boheng – 71.966\n\n4. Illia Kovtun – 71.465\n\n5. Joe Fraser – 71.266\n\nShare\n\nMen’s gymnastics: How do I feel watching this? Like I should probably head to the gym tomorrow, maybe stretch a bit more in the mornings, too. Shinnosuke Oka is still in business here, scoring 15.100 on the parallel bars to head to the top before the final rotation! He leads on 72.332.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 20.00 CEST\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Xiao Ruoteng shoots up to first despite not matching his compatriot Zhang Boheng on the parallel bars; he scores 14.766 to Zhang’s 15.300.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s gymnastics: GB’s Joe Fraser leaps up to third after scoring 14.933 in the parallel bars. Jake Jarman follows him on the same apparatus and looks a happy man with a dismount that really pleases the Beeb commentary team. He scores 14.300 to move up to fourth.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s tennis: Some early jeopardy for Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, a break down in their first set against Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram. The USA pair lead 3-1 in this doubles quarter-final.\n\nShare\n\nWomen’s football: Spain have beaten Brazil 2-0 in their Group C clash, with Alexia Putellas scoring in the, um, 17th minute of injury time.

Let’s keep our focus on the big one …\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Oleg Verniaiev nails it on the parallel bars to score 15! He’s at the top of the leaderboard. And up steps GB’s Jake Jarman on the vault … he sparkles with three and a half twists.

No room for sentimentality here.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.55 CEST\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Felix Dolci is allowed a second chance at the high bar after the equipment failure last time. His hands must be painful after the cuts. He goes for a big swing and tries to grab hold but can’t grab the bar and falls to the ground because his hands are in agony. Such a shame. He goes back to complete the job with a fine dismount. You have to have a lot of respect for him.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.01 CEST\n\nMen’s gymnastics: The main thing to takeaway from this event is that no one really likes the rings. They all just put up with it and do their best.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Jake Jarman is on the rings, not his favourite piece of apparatus. It is pretty solid and brings out a good finish, earning a respectable score of 12.800. He will be pleased to have that out of the way.\n\nShare\n\nWomen’s football: Want some more specific football content? There is a live blog of USA v Australia.\n\nShare\n\nMen’s gymnastics: Verniaiev comes up with a stunning piece of work on the vault, needing a little hop forward to sort the landing. It is a cracking effort that will help his challenge for a medal.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.38 CEST"
