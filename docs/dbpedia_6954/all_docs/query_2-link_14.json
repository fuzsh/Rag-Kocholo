        "text": "The Jaggerz still experience the thrill a few dozen times a year.\n\n“We’ll be near the end of our last set, and we’ve already done our soul songs,” Jaggerz guitarist Benny Faiella of Aliquippa explains. “I can see the faces in the crowd and tell there’s this anticipation for what’s going to come. They can’t wait to hear ’The Rapper.’”\n\nWhether clustered in a hotel lounge, banquet hall, car cruise or outdoor summer festival, Jaggerz fans burst into smiles, and cheer the moment they recognize those first smooth, seductive notes and the harmonized opening line to “The Rapper.”\n\nNext Friday marks the 50th anniversary of “The Rapper” pushing past John Lennon, Santana and Simon and Garfunkel to reach the No. 1 spot on a prestigious national music sales chart, a feat no Beaver County-based band has duplicated since.\n\n“It can’t be 50 years,” said the song’s lyricist, Donnie Iris. “It can’t be, man.”\n\nHey, girl ... I bet ya’\n\nBy 1969, the Jaggerz were the undisputed biggest band in the Beaver Valley, and maybe Pittsburgh, too.\n\nThey’d come a long way in the three years prior, when their Motown-inspired, rhythm and blues act had been packing the Club Naturale in Beaver Falls six nights a week and drawing similarly huge crowds in the Geneva-on-the-Lake resort area along Ohio’s North Coast.\n\nWith a lineup of Faiella, bassist-vocalist Jimmie Ross, organist Thom Davies, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Billy Maybray, drummer Jim Pugliano, and rhythm guitarist/vocalist Dominic Ierace (who since his school days had gone by the name “Donnie Iris”), the Jaggerz joined the big leagues in 1969 when recording a debut album for the acclaimed Gamble Records soul label in Philadelphia.\n\nThat album, “Introducing the Jaggerz,” featured R&B covers, along with tunes by Kenneth Gamble and his songwriting partner Leon Huff, plus the song “Gotta Find My Way Back Home” penned by Aliquippa twins Melvin and Mervin Steals.\n\nThe Jaggerz rookie album showed the band’s promise, but didn’t spawn any hit singles, so the Beaver Valley group jumped to another label, the New York-based Kama Sutra, which they believed would provide a bigger promotional push.\n\nThe Jaggerz had hired Joe Rock as their manager, knowing he had achieved major chart success a decade earlier with Pittsburgh doo wop group the Skyliners, writing lyrics for their smash hit “Since I Don’t Have You.”\n\nHeeding Rock’s advice, the Jaggerz began writing more of their own material.\n\nIris began cobbling together lyrics based on something he regularly spotted during the band’s gigs: guys hitting on girls, trying to get their phone numbers or more.\n\nIris put a cautionary tone to his song, with the opening verse:\n\n“Hey girl, I bet ya,\n\nThere's someone out to get you.\n\nYou'll find him anywhere,\n\nOn a bus, in a bar, in a grocery store.\n\nHe'll say, \"Excuse me, haven't I seen you somewhere before?\"\n\nInterviewed last month, on his 77th birthday, Iris recalled, “I got the idea from playing all the clubs and I’d see guys rapping to the chicks. That’s what we called it then, rapping. Being hit on. Of course, there’s a whole new meaning to rap now. But back then, rapping was hitting on somebody. So I came up with the idea, and we started working on the lyrics together.”\n\nThe Jaggerz were a very collaborative band\n\n“We brought stuff together in a group. Everybody was receptive to everything, and we worked hard at all the things that everybody brought in,” Iris said when interviewed for “The Story of Donnie Iris and the Cruisers,” the authorized biography about the Beaver Valley’s resident rock star, written by D.X. Ferris.\n\n“I wrote the riff, too,” Iris says in Ferris’ 2016 book. “ At the time, I was kind of a (Rolling) Stones fan. And I liked the simple kind of riffs that (Keith) Richards did. That’s probably where I got some of the inspiration for some of the stuff on that tune. And then the strumming guitar was probably a Creedence Clearwater kind of thing.”\n\nIris first pitched the lyrics and melody to Faiella one night outside the band’s New Brighton rehearsal studio.\n\nFaiella, 76, recalls, “He said, ’Hey Euge’ -- that’s what everyone called me then -- I’ve got this song I’ve been writing.”\n\n“I said, ’OK, let me hear it.’”\n\nFaiella continues, “We were on the sidewalk leaning up against a building and he had a guitar, so he started playing it.”\n\nThe lyrics and melody intrigued Faiella, though he wondered if it was the kind of bubblegum tune that would bring the band a younger, more teenage audience.\n\n“At the time, we were a very soulful band,” Faiella said, “and we were influenced by R&B and like the Temptations and the Impressions and all the black music we played a lot. That song was nowhere like where we were. It sounded entirely different, you know?”\n\nIris’s song had much more of a pop music feel to it. Though the Jaggerz fleshed it out in their New Brighton rehearsal space, and Rock, liking what he heard, pitching it to a label representative.\n\n“He said, ’I can help you with this,’” Faiella said.\n\nSo the Jaggerz began recording “The Rapper” as a track and eventual single for their sophomore album, “We Went to Different Schools Together.”\n\n“I remember it like it was yesterday,” remembers bassist-vocalist Ross, the current frontman of the Jaggerz, who lives in Center Township. “We would rehearse ’The Rapper’ back here before we went to New York. Once we got in the studio, we just refined it a little bit and we put a fuzz bass in there and the cowbell.\n\n“The cowbell was real important in that song,” Ross says with a laugh, reciting the punchline from a famed “Saturday Night Live” skit: “More cowbell!”\n\nWhile in the New York studio, the Jaggerz recorded two versions of “The Rapper.”\n\nOne became the chart-topping hit that landed the band on national TV (and 50 years later is still played regular’y on SiriusXM’s 1970s channel).\n\nThe other, alternative version of “The Rapper” sounded the exact same “except for the part where it says ’coffee, tea or me,’ they put ’me, me, me, me ...’” Ross said. “That one didn’t come out. But then we’re signing autographs somewhere in a record store one day, and the song is playing, and it goes ’coffee, tea or me, me, me, me.’ There were some shady things going on back then.”\n\nSomebody bootlegged “The Rapper”?\n\n“Exactly,” Ross said. “So somebody in the studio got that tape and pressed it out on their own. I don’t own a copy of that. But when I hear it, I cringe.”\n\nOnce the legitimate version of “The Rapper” had been pressed to vinyl, did the Jaggerz then assume they had a hit record on their hands?\n\n“Heck no. Not at all,” Iris said. “Like anything else, you go in and do the recording and hope for the best from there. And after it did happen, we were like, ’Did this really happen?’’’\n\nTen years later, Iris would experience a similar surprise with “Ah! Leah!” his post-Jaggerz Top-40 hit and FM radio staple with Donnie Iris and the Cruisers.\n\n’The Rapper’ rises\n\nReleased in January 1970, “The Rapper” soon found its way to radio -- one of those instances where one or two deejays began spinning a record, and word-of-mouth caused its success to spread.\n\n“I was driving through Freedom one day, and I put the radio on -- I can’t remember what station it was -- maybe WLS in Chicago or WABC in New York,” Iris said. “It was AM obviously, but I heard it. That was maybe a couple of weeks after it came out. Then I started hearing it on all the big AM stations.\n\n“I started hearing it everywhere.”\n\nListeners loved “The Rapper,” causing radio airplay to spread rapidly throughout the Midwest and then coast to coast.\n\nOn a wall in their New Brighton rehearsal room, the band taped up a map of the U.S., putting pushpins in the escalating number of cities where a radio station was spinning “The Rapper.”\n\n“I remember thinking ’Look at that. ... It’s getting played all over the place,’” Faiella said.\n\n“I’ve heard of only one station in the U.S. that wouldn’t play the song because of the line ’Coffee, tea or me,’” Ross said. “It was in the Bible belt, probably.”\n\nThe band’s record label told them “The Rapper” had landed on both of the top music charts in those days: Billboard and Record World.\n\nThe Jaggerz started buying copies of both publications to see how high “The Rapper” would rise.\n\nFor the next few weeks, the band excitedly kept tabs, as the song climbed steadily up both charts. It stalled at No. 2 on Billboard behind Simon and Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Trouble Waters.” But on March 20, 1970, the latest copy of Record World, a trade publication for the radio industry, showed the Jaggerz and “The Rapper” were No. 1 in the nation.\n\nNeither Ross nor Faiella nor Iris -- the three surviving Jaggerz -- can remember the exact moment they learned their Beaver Valley band was sitting at the top of the chart.\n\n“To tell you the truth, we kind of expected it, because it just kept going up the charts,” Ross said. “But to be in the same company with John Lennon’s ”Instant Karma“ and Simon and Garfunkel, it was amazing,” Ross said.\n\nAround that same time, the Jaggerz flew to California to appear on Dick Clark’s “American Bandstand,” long the standard-bearer of music-minded TV shows. Before the show, the Jaggerz, then in their 20s, got to meet the legendary Clark.\n\n“That was pretty cool,” Ross said. “I mean, you watched him every time you came home from high school, and then a couple years later he’s asking about our album.”\n\nIn those days, chart success was one of the two big barometers to know your band “had made it.” A bigger deal was achieving gold record status, given to musical acts whose records sold 1 million copies.\n\nIris’ father, who owned Lou’s Bar in Ellwood City, had been monitoring the success of “The Rapper,” too. He spray-painted a 45 rpm record of “The Rapper” and hung it in his bar, along with a homemade illustration of a thermometer, showing how far “The Rapper” needed to go to be certified gold.\n\nHe filled in the marks on the thermometer when “The Rapper” reached the 100,000 plateau, then 200,000, then 300,000 ...\n\n“I can remember it inching up the thermometer,” Iris said.\n\nThere was a joyous celebration at Lou’s Bar when the Recording Industry Association of America announced “The Rapper” officially had gone gold on March 27, 1970 -- exactly one week after topping the chart.\n\n“My dad walked around with his chest puffed out with pride,” Iris said. “He was very proud. My mother, too.”\n\nEach member of the Jaggerz received a copy of “The Rapper” after the band performed on a New York TV show.\n\n“I think it was called ’Scene 70’” Ross said. “We did the song, and right after that a representative from Buddha Records, which was with Kama Sutra, presented us with the gold record. And right after the show, we each got one.”\n\nRoss’ gold record hangs in his basement with framed newspaper and magazine clippings about the band from throughout the country, and as far as Japan.\n\nFor three weeks, “The Rapper” stayed in the Top 10 of the charts.\n\nThe Jaggerz never got there again.\n\nStill Rapping\n\nRiding their wave of popularity, the Jaggerz began touring nationally.\n\n“They were bigger crowds. And the money went up, which was cool,” Ross said.\n\nHighlights included a show with the Beach Boys and Andy Kim of “Baby I Love You” and “Rock Me Gently” fame.\n\nWhile “The Rapper” achieved major success, the “We Went to Different Schools Together” album stalled at No. 62 on the albums chart.\n\nThe Jaggerz released “I Call My Baby Candy” as a follow-up single, but it only reached No. 75. The next single, “What a Bummer,” only made it to No. 88, though it’s B-side song, “Memoirs of the Traveler,” would earn the band royalties years later when sampled by rappers such as the Game (featuring Nas), Curren$y (with Pittsburgh rap star Wiz Khalifa) and Dilated Peoples.\n\nThe three living Jaggerz have never been told officially what made the psychedelic “Memoirs of the Traveler” a popular pick for rap stars. Though it stands to reason those artists probably learned about the Jaggerz after doing a little web research on the name “The Rapper.”\n\nThere were glimmers of continued success in the early 1970s, like when famed L.A. radio deejay Wolfman Jack hired the Jaggerz as his backup band for an album that included his cover of “The Rapper.“ The album was a flop.\n\nBy 1977, the Jaggerz’s fortunes had subsided, and the band broke up. Iris joined Ohio Valley rockers Wild Cherry before embarking on a solo career that brought national hits and iconic stature in western Pennsylvania.\n\nMinus Iris, the Jaggerz played a 1989 reunion show at the Golden Dome of Beaver County, with original members Pugliano, Faiella, Ross and Maybray.\n\nRoss, Faiella and Pugliano picked up the torch again for a 1998 Jaggerz comeback album “And the Band Played On,” adding keyboardist Hermie Granati from another venerable Beaver County band, the Granati Brothers.\n\nThey soon discovered the timing was now right for the revamped Jaggerz, as nostalgia-driven fans would turn out in droves wherever the band played regionally. The Jaggerz have remained fixtures on the Pittsburgh area music scene ever since, with Ross on lead vocals and bass, and Faiella on guitar, still averaging 25 to 30 shows a year.\n\nThe band’s New Year’s Eve concerts have packed The Fez in Hopewell Township and the Airport Marriott in Findlay Township, drawing fans from throughout the country.\n\nUpcoming gigs include the San Rocco Festival in Center Township in August and a July 11 concert at The Cove in Geneva-on-the-Lake in Ohio, which they haven’t played since 1967, according to Ross.\n\n“People from back then remember us more as an R&B band,” Ross said. “And to tell you the truth, everyone says, ’I like ”The Rapper,“ but your best song was ”Gotta Find My Way Back Home.“ But ”The Rapper“ is the one that made it.”\n\nThat begs a question: What made “The Rapper” so popular?\n\n“The beat of it was good,” Faiella said. “And the words, ’Hey girl, I bet ya, There’s someone out to get you.’ ... Those are catchy ol’ lyrics, plus the vocals -- the lead and the harmony -- are amazing. The hook is good.”\n\n“It was the right song for the right time,” Ross said. “And it’s a singalong type tune. It had everything a hit song could have back then.”\n\n“I think people related to it, because that was what was going on, not only in bars, but anywhere. Just like today,” Iris said. “We just called it something else then. Rapping.”\n\nFor Iris, it’s still fun to hear and perform with his band, the Cruisers.\n\n“Absolutely. People will bring it up, how much they like that song,” Iris said. “I’ll hear it at a wedding or on the radio every once in awhile. It still sounds great. I thought we had a really good mix. I like how the drums and the bass are totally pumping.”\n\nRoss and Faiella still save “The Rapper” for the very end of their Jaggerz shows, savoring the smiles, cheers and dancing it sparks in audience.\n\n“I don’t know how many times we’ve played ’The Rapper,’” Faiella said. “But I still love it.”\n\nFriday marks the 50th anniversary of “The Rapper” by Beaver County’s the Jaggerz.
