        "text": "Back in the mists of the twentieth century, most television stations in the United States of America and Canada did not operate on 24-hour broadcast schedules, but shut down for a period of time each night during the wee hours. For some, it was a chance to perform routine maintenance that was not doable while the station was actively broadcasting; for others, it was a limitation of sponsors, funds, facilities and/or personnel that prevented them from providing programming for those overnight hours. For still others, it was simply an acknowledgement that the vast majority of their viewers held daytime jobs and couldn’t stay up all night watching TV, and so it wasn’t economical to air any programs in those hours.\n\nThis gradually changed as technology advanced and stations became more conscious that not all viewers held day jobs…and that they were leaving money on the table by not airing shows (and selling advertising time therein) for a huge chunk of the day. Today, most stations run paid programming (otherwise known as “infomercials”), reruns of old network shows and/or films, or overnight news reports in the hours between midnight and sunrise. Those few that still sign off and on overnight today may show weather radar, and many only sign off for a few moments as a formality before signing right back on again.\n\nBut back in the day, the necessity of a nightly shutdown meant that stations needed to come up with a way to notify viewers still awake that their programming was over for the day, and of when it would resume. This gave rise to a peculiar genre of film and video that held a strange fascination for a generation or two of young viewers (including me) and formed part of the cultural background of their lives, such that whole websites and video-sharing website channels and playlists are now devoted to it: local TV station sign-on and sign-off videos.\n\nEach night at the appointed hour (usually somewhere between midnight and 1:00 AM), the station would run a sign-off video to officially end its broadcast day. This video typically included a voiceover reciting the station’s call letters, channel and city of service, its ownership, its licensure by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), technical specifications (broadcast frequency, visual and audio wattage, call signs/frequencies of studio-to-transmitter microwave links etc.), location of the station’s studios and transmitter facilities, the height of their transmitter tower, network affiliation (if they had one; back then, a whole lot more stations were independent) and membership in trade associations such as the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) and the now-defunct Association of Independent Television Stations. (Some stations had to go through the call signs and specs of two or more stations, translators and/or repeaters in smaller towns nearby, such as stations in a statewide public-TV network with programming emanating from a central hub.) Most would invite the viewer to tune in again the next morning, and some would give the sign-on time. This would often be followed by the playing of the US national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” either sung or instrumental. (Canadian stations did something similar, using their own country’s anthem, “O Canada,” and sometimes an image of the currently reigning King or Queen of England, Canada being part of the Commonwealth of Great Britain. A few American stations located near the US-Canada border would play both anthems, as a nod to their viewers on each side.) Then the screen would fill with snow accompanied by the sound of static, a test pattern (in TV’s early black-and-white days) or the vertical color test bars later developed by the Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers (known for this reason as “SMPTE color bars”), plus a loud, obnoxious audio tone designed to induce the viewer to switch off the set—or at least change the channel.\n\nThese remained until the scheduled sign-on time the next morning, at which time all of the above would be played again in reverse order, starting with the anthem and ending with a wish from the station’s staff and management for viewers to have a good day (usually by the same announcer who’d wished them “a very pleasant good night and good morning” just hours earlier). This was the sign-on video, and these two sequences bookended a great many stations’ broadcast days in my youth.\n\n(A word about studio-to-transmitter microwave links, or STLs: These devices are commonly used by stations unable to have their studios and transmitter tower in the same location, which is to say the vast majority. STLs are required to have their own separate call letters and licenses; and unlike the stations themselves, these links have alphanumeric callsigns not limited to four characters, such as \"K25AC\" or \"WAC-275.\" For best coverage, especially for low-power stations, the transmitter has to be mounted atop either a very tall tower or building or a mountain or escarpment nearby. For example, from their 1973 opening to their destruction in 2001, the World Trade Center's Twin Towers mounted rooftop transmitters for several New York City TV and radio stations.)\n\nIn what would appear to be a massive number of copyright violations in at least some cases, thousands of these old sign-on and sign-off videos from US and Canadian stations have been uploaded to YouTube and other video-sharing websites by users who happened to have recordings of them. Some are for stations that either no longer exist or have different call letters and/or owners now, and thus can be considered historical artifacts. They can also be seen on websites such as the Sign-ons and Sign-offs Wiki, maintained by a company called Fandom at signons-and-signoffs.fandom.com, successor to the old TV Signoffs Guy website where many of them used to reside.\n\nSo what makes these seemingly mundane video curios of a bygone era so interesting? Well, for one thing, every one of the hundreds (and later thousands) of US and Canadian stations handled the ritual differently, with a wide range of approaches from very elaborate productions lasting several minutes to short announcements that basically said, “We’re going off the air now, and will return in the morning; thanks for watching. Good night.” Since there were no state or federal regulations dictating in detail any required content of such segments, stations took advantage of this to display their creativity and local/regional pride.\n\nFor another, many of them offer a look back at the periods in which they were made: the clothing and hairstyles, the background music, former logos and retro graphics, famous faces in their younger days, and other elements that can induce nostalgia for older viewers and provide creative inspiration for younger ones. An old sign-on or sign-off video can be like a time capsule from decades past—especially if it includes parts of programs that aired before or after it, and/or commercials of the period. Some of these videos begin with late-night replays of the day’s final newscast or a voiceover reading of headline news stories with a static slide; public service announcements (\"PSAs\") that were unpaid and therefore shown in \"off hours\" rather than letting them use up more lucrative time slots; or promos for shows then airing on the station.\n\nSign-on/sign-off visuals could be as simple as a card shown onscreen with the station’s logo and technical information, and perhaps some appropriate generic graphics such as a forest of TV antennae atop houses, images of a giant satellite antenna dish or a tall transmitter tower. Some would run video over the announcements, featuring local scenery and cultural events or scenes of the station’s studio complex and staff members operating machinery and/or working in the offices, soundstages and newsroom. As computer-graphics imagery (CGI) became widely available, stations began using it to animate their station logo, network logo or other visual elements. A few stations—KTCA in Minneapolis/St. Paul and San Francisco's KTZO (now KOFY) among them—made their sign-offs resemble the closing credits of a program, listing names and sometimes showing images of all the station's personnel. Many would also invite viewer comments and suggestions, showing a postal mailing address and (rarely) a phone number on screen. (One suspects station execs quite understandably preferred that viewer contacts be by mail rather than having viewers tie up phone lines during the day.) When the McClatchy newspaper chain still owned a string of stations around the country, those stations would sign on and off with a short, hand-animated film starring their corporate mascot, the McClatchy Bee (designed by Walt Disney and named “Teevy”), wishing viewers good morning and good night.\n\nFrequently, stations’ sign-offs would be preceded by a “sermonette,” a very brief religious program (around 3-5 minutes) featuring local clergy saying prayers or discussing topics relevant to members of their faiths. (WNEW in New York showed one that appears at about 10:00 in this video.) Often these segments were sponsored by religious organizations, local churches and/or synagogues. Sermonettes had titles like “Daily Meditations,” “Give Us This Day” or “Thoughts for Today,” and some stations aired the same sort of “commercial for God” after their sign-on in the morning. One station in my hometown of Lafayette, LA, KLFY, took this idea a step further, catering to southwest Louisiana’s heavily French-speaking, Roman Catholic population—many of whom were elderly or ailing shut-ins—by daily airing a complete recitation of the Holy Rosary by a priest and a small congregation in English and French, on a soundstage in their studios, right after sign-on each morning. Viewers could hold their own rosary beads and follow along. (Alas, I have yet to find it anywhere online.) And Los Angeles' KHJ (now KCAL) had an unusual sermonette: \"The Lord's Prayer\" in Native American sign language, performed by a Nez Perce chief, Shatka Bear-Step (see it at 2:38 here). Tulsa, OK station KTUL made a similar film featuring Cheyenne tribesman Dick West signing the same prayer around that time.\n\nThe national anthem segment also contained a great deal of variety from region to region, and even from station to station in the same city. Renditions of “The Star-Spangled Banner” could be symphonic and accompanied by shots of a waving US flag and patriotic imagery; sung over films of military personnel, ships and planes that were basically recruitment videos for the armed forces; instrumental solos over majestic shots of the country’s various natural wonders (as in a film produced by The Sierra Club in 1972); or everyday scenes of Americans at work and play (as in the “Moog SSB” video, featuring a version of the anthem played on a Moog synthesizer, which was quite popular with stations around the nation). Some used animated images of paintings and archival photos from US history; one widely used video of this type is called “Flag Evolution,” and uses the various versions of the US flag from 1776 onward to punctuate archival images depicting events from the earliest European settlements in North America up to the 1969 moon landing. This film was produced by a company called Saxton Graphic Associates Ltd. in 1971, just two years after Apollo XI, and stands out as a high-quality example of the genre. A similar film was produced by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (“the Mormons,” as the end credit usually explained) in 1965 and aired on several stations. It features animated patriotic images and paintings of historical figures over a sung version of the anthem by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. A different LDS sign-off film, set to the Choir's rendition of \"My Country 'Tis Of Thee,\" can be seen at 0:47 here.\n\nAs noted above, the sound of the anthem could be varied, ranging from local high-school or college band performances (a Los Angeles station, KCET, used to show this film of the University of Southern California’s Trojan Marching Band spelling out the station’s call letters on the field of L.A. Memorial Coliseum and playing the anthem) to choral groups singing it a capella, to the Moog version mentioned above. A Las Vegas station, KLAS, for many years used a piano version of the anthem (played in an unusual 4/4-time arrangement) over scenes of Nevadan history and local sights such as the Hoover Dam and the Las Vegas Strip, ending with a shot of the Nevada state seal. Not every station used “The Star-Spangled Banner”; some played other patriotic songs such as Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “This Is My Country,” Ray Charles’ iconic 1976 live performance of “America the Beautiful” or Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America.” Some used music with no patriotic themes at all, such as WYES in New Orleans, which played a slow pop theme over aerial shots of the city at night, or WFAA in Dallas, which used a segment of Neil Diamond’s 1970 instrumental “African Trilogy” over shots of local scenery and a brief female voiceover in the late 1970s and early 1980s (I lived in that area then, and was able to see it myself a number of times). You can see it at 1:25 in this video. And Honolulu's KHON had a sign-off with still photos of local lifestyles over a chorus singing \"America the Beautiful\" with lyrics translated into Hawaiian. But by far the weirdest music for signing off was used by Jackson, MS station WLBT, which in 1990 announced its sign-off over Jimi Hendrix's famous 1967 rock anthem \"Purple Haze,\" complete with psychedelic on-screen graphics.\n\nIn most cases, a station’s sign-on and sign-off are more or less identical, but not always. Lafayette, LA station KLFY signed off in the 1970s with a recording of Elvis Presley singing “An American Trilogy,” a medley of three slow-sung songs (“Dixie,” “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “All My Trials”) composed and arranged by Mickey Newbury in 1972, played over footage of swamps, rivers and rural locations in the Acadiana region. It made for an unusually long sign-off; the song lasts four minutes and 34 seconds. The segment concluded with an announcer reading the sign-off script over the last minute or so of music. The station’s morning sign-on had similar imagery, but was accompanied by a lively Cajun instrumental dance number on accordion, guitar and fiddle. (Another one I haven't yet found online, sad to say.) Later on, the sign-on became much shorter, with just a single title slide, no music and narration lasting less than a minute.\n\nRarely, sign-ons and sign-offs could even include a bit of humor. During his early career, before becoming a nationally-known talk show host, comedian David Letterman made a sign-off video for his then-employer, WLIW in Indianapolis (now WHTR) that featured a crude scale model of the station's studio building being blown apart on camera with his voiceover (“It’s quiet now in the television studios...”). It's on YouTube at 2:59 in this compilation video. (You'll have to ask him whether this was a reflection of how he felt about working there.) WQEX, a public TV station in Pittsburgh, PA (now WINP and commercial) made whole comedy skits to air with its sign-offs, along with crazy credit crawls, which you can see here. And some sign-offs provided educational material, most often on stations affiliated with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) or its predecessor, National Educational Television (NET); one example is the series of weekly four-minute \"Star Hustler\" videos made and hosted by the late Jack Horkheimer, former director of a Miami planetarium, telling amateur stargazers what they could look forward to seeing in the skies that week.\n\nSome stations would include legal disclaimers in their sign-on and sign-off sequences, usually reminding the viewer that all their programming was copyrighted. One common announcement ran, in one variant or another, like this: “Programs broadcast on this station may not be used for any purpose except exhibition at the time of their broadcast, on receivers of the type ordinarily used for home reception, in places where no admission, cover or mechanical operating charges are made.” (WNYC in New York has a good example here.)\n\n(Obviously, in our present age of TV-capable computers, tablets and smartphones that can be taken just about anywhere, the part about “receivers of the type ordinarily used for home reception” would be somewhat problematic to enforce. With VCRs, DVRs, streaming video and on-demand services, the part about “exhibition at the time of their broadcast” would have the same problem.) Some would advertise their station as being “an equal opportunity employer” (this was back in the days when women and minority members often had a tougher time getting high-level broadcast-industry jobs; the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Act was still fairly new, having been enacted in 1972).\n\nOlder stations would brag about their longevity, informing viewers that they were their city’s, state’s or region’s earliest TV station; KXAS in Dallas, for example, touted itself as “the pioneer television station of the Great Southwest,” and WDSU noted it was “New Orleans’ first television station.” Those that were co-owned with radio stations would often invite viewers who were not yet ready to hit the sack to check out their sister stations’ all-night broadcasts for music, news, talk or other entertainment during the pre-dawn hours. Many sign-ons and sign-offs also included a notice that some or all of the station’s programming was pre-recorded (“Portions of our programming may be brought to you by means of mechanical transcription or reproduction,” in the most commonly used wording). This was a holdover from the 1950s infancy of the medium (and from radio before it), when most TV shows were transmitted “live” without the use of film or videotape. The alt-rock band Everclear used an audio clip of one of these to open its nostalgia-soaked 2000 hit song and music video “AM Radio.”\n\nSome of these old videos mark historical events in the television industry or the area of their operation. One video available on YouTube contains the very first sign-on of WNEV in Boston, from Saturday, May 22, 1982. WNEV was created to take over the facilities and operations of WNAC, which had lost its FCC license after its parent company, RKO General, was found to have committed fraud and illegal political contributions. RKOG waged a protracted legal battle to keep its stations, which ended with the US Supreme Court refusing to hear their appeal, and the company was eventually forced out of the broadcasting business altogether. This video features an early morning gathering of the WNEV staff outside the studios being interviewed by reporter Mike Taibbi (father of more recent Rolling Stone magazine muckraker Matt Taibbi) as they began their first full day of operations. This is followed by a promotional spot showing the staff setting up the new station and installing its new logo on various equipment, vehicles and doors to the tune of a jingle called “There’s A New Day Dawning.” (The station still operates, but is now known as WHDH and independent.)\n\nMore recent videos feature the final sign-offs of analog transmission by stations switching from that now-obsolete broadcasting technology to new digital systems, as required by the FCC by mid-June of 2009. Some end with an on-screen “night light” notice shown to analog viewers following the switchover, advising them of the end of analog broadcasts and offering advice or phone numbers to call to find out how to receive the new digital signal. Overall, these videos show how stations have changed call letters, channels, owners, networks, studio locations and programming formats over the years. Some really old videos offer a glimpse into the earliest days of American TV, such as the very first sign-on for Roanoke, VA station WDBJ (1955), a 1958 sign-on of WBTV in Charlotte, NC, or the 1969 sign-off of WDAU in Scranton, PA (no audio included). Some mark sad endings, like the final sign-offs of Green Bay, WI station WXGZ and Burlington / Philadelphia station WKBS, both of which include farewell speeches by station executives announcing the failure of efforts to keep them on the air.\n\nOne key feature of sign-on and sign-off videos in the mid-to-late 20th century was the display of a logo and announcements signifying the station’s adherence to the NAB’s Code of Practice for Television Broadcasters, informally and much better known as the Television Code. This was the earliest effort by the industry to self-regulate by getting member stations to agree to police their own practices and program content (and thereby discourage the federal government from doing so far more intrusively and punitively).\n\nFor decades, the Code’s laurel-leaf-bordered “Seal of Good Practice” was seen not only on stations’ sign-off and sign-on videos, but also at the end of closing-credit crawls on many network shows, including ones aired in \"prime time\" (the period between 8:00 and 11:00 PM Eastern Monday through Friday, which networks use to sell their priciest ads and ratings services such as Nielsen use to gauge viewership). Some stations would simply display the seal and mention it briefly, while others would describe some of the Code’s major requirements, such as accurate and unbiased news coverage, careful handling of children’s programming and regularly scheduled religious shows. (That last was probably the main reason so many stations aired sermonettes.) Many of these ended with some variation of “To see better TV, watch Channel [number], a Television Code station.” WDSU in New Orleans, for some reason, designed its own “handmade” version of the seal, with differing colors, typefaces and composition from the original (seen at 0:57).\n\nThe Code was discontinued in the 1980s after federal courts found it unconstitutional and in violation of the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine, which mandated that stations present a variety of viewpoints on major issues of the day. The Fairness Doctrine was ended as official federal policy by the Reagan administration not long after that at the instigation of conservatives. Today, stations and networks have their own internal departments to monitor programming for controversial and/or offensive content, usually called Standards & Practices.\n\nThis only scratches the surface of the variety and complexity of station sign-ons and sign-offs over the decades, and most of them can be found online for those who remember them, or for those who don’t and are curious. One YouTube playlist has over 1,000 different sign-on and sign-off videos, some including segments of programs just prior or after. One doesn’t have to be autistic (as I am) to enjoy these videos necessarily…but it may help. For many years I thought I was the only one who was interested in sign-on and sign-off videos, figuring it was just one of many ways I was a weirdo. The advent of the Internet and digital video made it possible for me to finally learn that I was not alone—and if you share this esoteric interest, neither are you.\n\nA similar interest that a whole lot of people seem to have is TV newscast theme music, which is a whole industry by itself, with several firms selling ready-made themes to stations. Many of the best-known themes can also be found online at the News Music Search Archive (newsmusicsearcharchive.com), which is searchable by station, region, theme, composer or year(s) aired. If one of those themes got stuck in your head decades ago, you can probably find and hear it here...but that’s a whole other article."
