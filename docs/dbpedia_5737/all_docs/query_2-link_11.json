        "text": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. – It was an accident, according to police, as the 76-year-old man who lived inside a home on the 700 block of 7th Street didn’t have electricity or water and had been using 20-pound propane tanks to heat his home when something ignited the gas.\n\nWhen Ann Arbor police arrived at the explosion, their body cameras were running, and you could feel the adrenaline as they rushed to get people away from the fire and to figure out whether anyone else was hurt.\n\nThe video shows the homeowner walking away from the explosion. He has a bad concussion but managed to escape being hit by flying debris.\n\nThere’s nothing left of the home. A community effort has sprung up on GoFundMe and has already surpassed the amount they were looking to raise.\n\nIt will go toward helping him find a new place to live as well as medical expenses."
