        "text": ".\n\nIn case you havenât read it, the title of this post is in reference to the if-I-do-say-so-myself-despite-a-few-tiny-inaccuracies-great-and-rather-large-piece-on-me in last Sundayâs Washington Post.\n\nIn current news, I will be taking to the stage in LA again for the first time in over a year, actually the first two times, as there are two impending opportunities for me to regale you with my most humiliating show business stories and watch the audience remember my lyrics better than I do as we sing-along to some of my greatest hits!\n\nFirst, I will be performing my infamous poolside with Sammy Davis Jr., Elizabeth Taylor slab oâ ribs story as well as a retelling of the single most ego-numbing, dignity-deprivation moment of my career, the Phoebe Snow/Paul Simon âIâm so f%#king hungry and yes, youâre Still Crazy after all these hoursâ story at Beth Lapidesâ Iâm With The Band (sorry, Pamela DesBarres who HAS been with the band!) evening at the Skirball Center, Friday night, June 5. Itâs rock & roll comedy told by very funny people like John Riggie (30 Rock, The Comeback), Greg Behrendt Heâs Just Not That Into You), the lovely Moon Zappa (Curb Your Enthusiasm, America the Beautiful) and, of course, ME, featuring stories about some of musicâs biggest legends and presented lounge-style with cocktails and snacks available for purchase. Tickets here.\n\nThen on Sunday night, July 12, itâs big olâ party time when the illustrious Andrae and I + band hit the stage for a wild, so-affordable-itâs-crazy fundraiser for my Detroit-inspired record, video and feature length film about human spirit, âThe Dâ/ Allee Willis Loves Detroitâ!! Featuring a sneak peek world premiere of the record and video with more people in history than have ever been the original artist on a record, joined by some of the biggest stars to ever emerge from the Motor City. Also sing-alongs to some of some of my fattys like âSeptember,â âBoogie Wonderland,â âNeutron Dance,â and the Friends theme, as well as auctions from the legendary Allee Willis Museum Of Kitsch collection! Many more surprises at this outrageous multimedia live feast for the eyes, ears and soul!! Tickets, thankfully going fast, are here.\n\nAnd last but far from least, we are making fairly stunning progress on âThe Dâ record and video, both of which are in the area of 85/90% finished. We are constantly diverted from the filmmaking mission having to prepare things like a marketing deck and a movie trailer so we can all stop eating up to the green edges of our food and raise some real money to get this car on the road. But I must admit, despite the financial deprivation â PLEASE COME TO THE BENEFIT ON JULY 12 â we are all having the time of our lives working on something this creative and worthwhile. All we do is laugh, and all we do is feel better and better about what weâre doing every time we look at the joy pouring out of Detroiters eyes, mouths and hearts as we pull everything together.\n\nExciting news on âThe Dâ song front is that Detroitâs own Maejor, an artist with hundreds of millions of YouTube views and the smoothest voice this Motor City side of Marvin Gaye, is the latest superstar to add his voice to the record.\n\nPlus recent interviews for Allee Willis Loves Detroit, the film, include the multi-seriesed Michael Patrick King, the shy and retiring Jenifer Lewis, the demure Sandra Bernhard, and Earth, Wind & Fireâs stupendous Philip Bailey, among illustrious others.\n\nThatâs about it for now. Hereâs the link to my story in the Washington Post again: âMost interesting woman youâve never heard ofâ (so please get your ass to my show and help rectify the situation!)\n\nOnward, Detroit! And remember to gimme some gas money on July 12 or pop it down here if youâre in generous spirit and unable to attend.\n\nI know, I knowâ¦ Itâs been pathetically long since my last update. That might be because of the 20-hour-days-minimum-six-days-a-week schedule those of us working on the Detroit record, video, and filmhave been adhering to, handstitching everything together as if we were Betsy Ross making that flag. There have been great, jubilant daysâ¦\n\nâ¦as well as days that make you want to roll onto the freeway and pray an 18 wheeler puts you out of your miseryâ¦.\n\nBut thatâs the life of an independent 99%-self funded artist and I wouldnât change anything for the world. Well, I WOULD love someone to dunk me into a big olâ vat of Lincolnsâ¦\n\nOld photo I knowâ¦ If you canât tell by the lack of wrinkles on my face you can certainly tell by it being the last time I ever wore a dress. But aside from that I leave each day totally uplifted by the spirit pouring out of the footage and sounds leaping off the record. Wish I could leak a teeeeeny tiny sample but letâs just say that no other city has had a song that sounded so insanely jubilant and looked quite so unique.\n\nI donât wanna let too much cat outta the bag until we premiere the record and video in Detroit this SEPTEMBER. Now that the year-long jotting down of logs has ended the videoâs about 60% finished. In the meantime weâve also begun interviewing some of my esteemed friends and colleagues for Allee Willis Loves Detroit, the film. The bounty includes this young Detroiter:\n\nâ¦and this young man who gave me my big break by having me write for his group, Earth, Wind & Fire:\n\nThe celeb list in the film is long because people have a lot to say about Detroit (and apparently me). This includes many Color Purple people and a stunning array of Grammy, Emmy, Tony, Academy Award, and Pulitzer Prize winners, a smattering of whom weâve filmed so far including RuPaul, Ricki Lake, Bruce Vilanch, Lesley Ann Warren, Marsha Norman, and Luenell with a whole slew yet to come.\n\nNot to say that the finish line of the feature film is in sight but we are crawling towards it with skinned knees, blisters on our fingers and faith in our hearts!\n\nAs for âThe Dâ, the record is about 95% done. Just in need of us moving out of my home studio â not to berate my little studio which back in the day James Brown called one of the best and funkiest sounding in LA â but so we have a shot at mixing in more opportune acoustic conditions so the 40 basses, 35 guitars and over 5000 singers donât make everything too wobbly sounding as they bounce off the heads of Sammy Davis Jr., Groove On Brother, and other soulful onlookers here at Willis Wonderland.\n\nWeâve also been putting together a marketing deck so we can raise real money to get âThe Dâ/ Allee Willis Loves Detroit finally on the road. As all of us normally peer through artistsâ eyes we had no idea what we were doing here and this took some months of concentration not to mention putting any further record, video or documentary editing on hold.\n\nIf you know of any deep pocket persons or company/institutions that should see our lovely and provocative marketing deck please let me know. And to drop a few coins of your own in the tank you can always go here.\n\nIn the meantime, go on wit yo bad self, Detroit!\n\nAll around it was a very good SEPTEMBER week here at Willis Wonderland LA as well as Willis W in Detroit.\n\nYes I know there is a Willis Street in almost every major city in the country. But this particular one is not only the exact spot my parents first met when they lived kitty corner from each in Detroit oh so may years ago, but itâs also the street that was taken over to make way for this intersection below, in a housing complex started by retired Motown singers and where we sang one of the sing-alongs for âThe Dâ record and videos.\n\nAs the reliably magic day â the 21st of September â approached, NPR did a great story on the timelessness of my very first hit, âSeptemberâ, co-written with Al McKay and Maurice White. Professors of Musicology even broke it down for analysis as to why it is so eternally happy and a song that will literally never end.\n\n0Itâs been decades now that every weekend I receive at least 5 videos of the song played at someoneâs wedding or drunken karaoke spree or thereâs a bar mitzvah boy spinning around his blond dream girl, anywhere and everywhere happiness is the intention. And indeed THAT makes me very happy!\n\nThen I had literally one if the greatest days of my life in Detroit on THE BaDeYa 21st of September when I performed my very sold out âBaDeYa, Detroit!â show, featuring a 15 piece band put together from musicians and singers we discovered at the sing-alongs and while filming the feature-length-exceedingly-hybrid-documentary, Allee Willis Loves Detroit.\n\nThe show/party also included dancers from Mosaic Youth Theatre Of Detroit, one of âThe Dâ/ Allee Willis Loves Detroitâs beneficiaries, spinning car tires over their heads, choreographed videographers leaping over drums on cymbal crashes and organ sweeps, as well as the obligatory obsessive amount of junk food I subsist on.\n\nAnd then how much better does it get when you get Tavis Smily in an Afro (attempting to) shake his booty to âSeptemberââs sister, âBoogie Wonderlandâ, on Dancing With The Stars, all in the same week?! Though he sported one of those chopped down naturals when a good footlong Billy Preston was called for.\n\nI have been blessed with a wonderful (albeit challenging) life and am living my creative (albeit money challenged) dream right now and I thank all of you who made it possible! Remember to throw some gas money in the tank please.\n\nBaDeYa!\n\nFor the past few few years now on the âBaDeYa, say do you remember 21st night of Septemberâ, my blessed and magic day because itâs the first line in the first hit record I ever had, Iâve made a tradition of performing live, something that took me over three decades to get together. Other than last year when I was in Detroit conducting one of the 50 sing-alongs for âThe Dâ, the unofficial official theme song I cowrote for Detroit, in a laundromat with people essentially spinning around in dryers while singing.\n\nAs luck would have it, THIS year was a particularly special September 21st as just a couple days earlier NPR did a story on why âSeptemberâ, co-written with Maurice White and Al McKay, remains such a timeless song, symbolizing warmth, love, and soul.\n\nThis year September 21 was even more special because I decided to perform live for the very first time EVER in Detroit, my beloved hometown for whom Iâve (unofficially) been slaving away on a project, âThe Dâ, a record and multiple music videos, and Allee Willis Loves Detroit, a feature length film, for the last 2 1/2 years. As such, my co-writer and partner on the music portion of the project, Andrae Alexander, and I put together a 15 piece band made up of the very best musicians and singers we found during the 50 D sing-alongs we led last year to perform live with us in the show, BaDeYa, Detroit!.\n\nWe also wanted to give everyone a preview of the song which finally has a preliminary mix after over a solid year of trying to deal with 5000 vocal and instrument tracks, each one with up to hundreds of voices on them. Thereâs just so much room in the sound spectrum and every inch of it we have taken up truly sounds like something you have never heard before. We also gave the audience a sneak peak at the beginnings of the first of many music videos to follow. (Sorry â no preview here; only a few shots so you can see it ainât no normal thang and to insure that you get the full punch once the first videoâs actually delivered.)\n\nFor an artist such as myself who dotes on every detail of a stage production from designing the invitations to handmaking the set, picking theme food, designing the merchandise, casting people who help us like Iâm casting characters in a musical, shipping 20 crates of everything to Detroit, directing, co-producing, and doing just about everything else involved in a production â albeit all with fantastic collaborators â this was no easy feat. And performing out of town for essentially the first time in my adult life makes that even harder. But donât even ask me how worth it it was!!! Easily one of the best days/nights of my life was this â21st (almost) night of Septemberâ!\n\nWe performed at United Sound, a still-in-existence historic recording studio in Detroit where everyone from Charlie Parker to The Rolling Stones and some of my all-time favorite records like Isaac Hayesâ âShaftâ, The Dramaticsâ âWhatcha See Is Whatcha Getâ, and Marvin Gayeâs âWhatâs Goinâ Onâ were recorded.\n\nBut to turn a brilliant recording studio into a brilliant performance space is another issue entirely, especially when it involves things like sets, choreographed videographers who leap over drums on crash cymbal cues and organ sweeps, and all the other madness that goes into an Allee Willis production..\n\nOf this now 2 1/2 year Detroit gargantuan mofo project, âThe Dâ and Allee Willis Willis Loves Detroit, the feature-length film about human spirit as seen through the people of Detroit and how my life, a constant conscious battle to keep my own spirit going, parallels that struggle, 99% of it has been funded by me. (Put some gas money here please.) So this meant getting people involved in BaDeYa, Detroit! working for gratis. Which they thankfully, gratefully, and miraculously did. From the band to just about everyone else who worked in any capacity on the show. They are saints. They are insanely talented. They are blissfully soulful, and primary examples of why I feel so compelled to make a film about the people of Detroit and how it is THEY who will rebuild the city because of their resilient spirit.\n\nI want to give a special shout out to Malcolm Haris and Donnevan Tolbert, two young gentleman I saw play Mister and Harpo when their high school, Cass Tech, became the first in the country to license the musical I cowrote, The Color Purple, a couple years ago, and who did a brilliant spoken word intro to my show.\n\nAnd I want to thank the five brilliant dancers from The Mosaic Youth Theater of Detroit, one of the two beneficiaries of all profits from my Detroit efforts, who donned mechanics uniforms and spun car tires over their heads during the sneak peak world premiere of the first mix of âThe Dâ and boogied their butts off during my second hit, âBoogie Wonderlandâ.\n\nI want to also thank the stupendous audience not only for showing up, as songwriters remain the buried treasure of the music industry, but also for participating so wildly so that the show came off just as I had prayed it would. Like a party in my living room. And if you donât know my reputation for throwing parties you better go here now.\n\nAs a result of having so much fun not to mention hitting a new plateau in my budding performing career, I love Detroit even more than I have kvelled about it before, as if that was even possible. And I will eternally love the 21st of September for doing everything from giving me a second birthday because every year since I wrote it I hear from thousands of people that day telling me how happy the song makes them feel. This year it made me the happiest of all.\n\nI hope you can see the spirit that was jumping off of the stage and ricocheting back to us in all the above photos as well as all of these. That room was an automatic power generator and from what Iâve heard everyone, certainly including me, is still buzzing. So BaDeYa Detroit!\n\nI know. Itâs been pathetically long since my last update. This is not due to inactivity! Weâve been having 12 hour days here at Willis Wonderland since January and STILL havenât quite gotten through all the footage and recording tracks, close to 3000 hours and 5000 tracks respectively, for âThe Dâ record and multiple music videos, and Allee Willis Loves Detroit our feature-length hybrid documentary. Not that this has been driving us crazy or to drink.\n\nThere are a lot of D deputies in the way of engineers, editors, and assorted characters here every day:\n\nI know it might seem like we do a lot of lying around but this rarely occurs unless eyeballs start rolling in the back of our heads after working 16 straight hours looking at 743 takes of various groups singing the same line. Two of these folks in the above photo are gone already. We hate to lose them, well one of them at least, but when one is paying such a high salary, as close to zero dollars as humanly possible due to our expansive budget known as my pocket, these things are inevitable.\n\nChallenges have abounded. Like having to replace my hundred terabyte server in the middle of editing and mixing so that master files are scattered around on a trillion different drives and computers as opposed to one central location while the switchover happens. So this includes helpful things like servers constantly going down or computers not being able to talk to each other, watching files getting eaten up before your eyes, overwriting files, and all the other joys that come with working in a part-time dysfunctional digital environment.\n\nAnd then there was the hideous discovery that due to brain slippage of a certain IT person (no longer) working here nothing had been backed up since February and we lost at least a monthâs worth of footage of us figuring out how to jam thousands of voices and instruments into one record so everyoneâs heard. Not to mention the fits of hysteria incurred after looking at blurry key footage and figuring out how to work around it. This had me in a such a comatose state I had to shoot Vernorâs, Detroitâs beverage of choice, into my veins to keep me from slipping into a coma.\n\nBut the trauma has always been tamed by the joy of working on such a unique project. Sometimes we have even have FRIENDS drop in to bring us matzoh ball soup, cupcakes, and other modes of sustenance to remind us we have a life on the outside.\n\nAnd now traveling for âThe Dâ crew kicks up again. I will be spending one week out of each of the next four months in the Motor City, this month to attend my 107th high school reunion!\n\nThen I return two weeks later in August to give a speech on Creativity And Detroit at the Crooked Tree Arts Center in Petoskey, four hours from the city and where my parents bought their very first first house. Then Iâm elated to report that on September 21 (yes, the âBaDeYa, say do you rememberâ 21st of September!) I will be performing LIVE in Detroit at the historic United Sound, the recording studio where the very first Motown records were made and still a vital part of Detroit music history. And then again at the end of October when the musical I co-wrote, The Color Purple, comes back to the D for the fourth time, this time starring Dreamgirl Jennifer Holliday, who I wrote for many a year ago and havenât seen since, making for a Dream D reunion! All these extravaganzas will be filmed and recorded for âThe Dâ and Allee Willis Loves Detroit.\n\nSo as we cut and paste, chop, mix, curse, cry, hug and exhibit all the various kinds of behavior that come with undertaking a task of this girth I thank all of you who have donated or contributed your services thus far. Itâs not too late to donate!! We will do you proud!\n\nYours in The D,\n\nAllee The D/ Allee Willis Loves Detroit home: http://www.WeSingTheD.com Sneak Peak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rkbTpZdxy8 WDIV/ NBC Allee Willis Does Detroit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8HdLEfw1zg Fox 2 News: http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/video?autoStart=true&topVideoCatNo=default&clipId=9361767"
