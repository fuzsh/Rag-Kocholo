        "text": "The identity of Scott County’s second superintendent of schools has long been something of a mystery.\n\nNote: The Scott County School System did not exist prior to 1867. Before that, there were a number of individual school systems in Scott County (19 in 1853, for example), with each electing three commissioners, who were responsible for hiring the teachers to serve in their schools. From 1867 to 192, the superintendent of schools was appointed by the Scott County Quarterly Court, a forerunner to what we now know as Scott County Commission, and served two-year terms. Voters elected school superintendents beginning in 1924.\n\nIt’s long been established that Scott County’s first school superintendent, from 1867 to 1869, was John Crawford Parker, the Helenwood attorney who would later serve as county judge. And it’s well-known that the third school superintendent, from 1871 to 1873 was Laban Riseden, a New River attorney who later moved to Morgan County and served as county judge there; whose daughter, Maude, was the first female superintendent of schools in Tennessee (while in Morgan County), and the first woman to graduate from the University of Tennessee School of Law and be admitted to the bar.\n\nBut what about the period in between?\n\nIn 1981, members of the Scott County Retired Teachers Association presented portraits of each of Scott County’s school superintendents to hang in the board room at the Central Office in Huntsville. Only one was missing: the second school superintendent, who was identified as Lafayette Spaule and served from 1869 to 1871.\n\nSix years later, the Retired Teachers Association published a book with biographical sketches of Scott County’s school superintendents, again without any information about Lafayette Spaule.\n\nThe Winter 1998 edition of the FNB Chronicle included a photo and brief biography of each school superintendent — again, without Spaule. It noted: “The second superintendent of schools in Scott County was Lafayette Spaule, who served from 1869-1871. No biographical information and no photo of Spaule was located during the nine years required for the Retired Teachers Association to compile this listing.”\n\nWho was Lafayette Spaule?\n\nFinding information on a Lafayette Spaule has proven futile for many — including the Retired Teachers Association in the 1980s. The only person in Scott County named Lafayette when the 1870 census was taken was a baby boy named Lafayette Chambers, who appears to have been the child of Riley Chambers and his second wife, Polly Anderson.\n\nSo who was Lafayette Spaule?\n\nThe answer appears to lie within the famous story of Scott County’s Civil War heroine, Julia Marcum.\n\nMarcum was the 16-year-old girl from Smith Creek near Buffalo who fended off Confederate soldiers who were attacking her home and family in September 1861, losing an eye and a finger in the process.\n\nJulia had an older sister, Didama, who married a man named Lafayette Sproule. They were married in June 1865 in Pulaski County, Ky.\n\nThe names are so similar — Lafayette Spaule and Lafayette Sproule — that it seems impossible for it to be a coincidence. Could the surname of Scott County’s second school superintendent have been spelled incorrectly at some point?\n\nThe problem is that the 1870 census, which was taken when Lafayette Spaule is believed to have still been the superintendent of schools in Scott County, shows that Lafayette Sproule and his wife, Didama, were living in Williamsburg, Ky. — along with their children, four-year-old Laura and two-year-old Charles, and Didama’s heroine sister, 24-year-old Julia Marcum. There’s no record that the Sproules ever spent any time in Scott County.\n\nSo does that mean Lafayette Spaule and Lafayette Sproule weren’t the same person, after all?\n\nThe answer lies in an old record from the U.S. Freedmen’s Bureau, which had been established by Congress in March 1865 and abolished in 1872. It was charged with dealing with freedmen and lands that had been abandoned or seized during the Civil War.\n\nThe record in question is a handwritten list of Tennessee’s county school superintendents during the years the Freedmen’s Bureau was active, 1865-1872. It lists Scott County’s school superintendent as Lafayette Sproule, and lists his residence as being in Huntsville. Furthermore, the record refers to him as “Dr. Lafayette Sproule.” The Lafayette Sproule who Didama Marcum married was a physician.\n\nThe Marcum story\n\nThe Marcum family’s story began in 1861, when Tennessee had voted to secede from the Union, and Scott County had declared its independence from Tennessee. East Tennessee as a whole had been strongly opposed to secession, and thousands of men were traveling north into Kentucky to sign up with the Union army.\n\nAs a county situated on the Tennessee-Kentucky border, Scott County was on the way to Kentucky for many of these volunteers who were headed northward. Several men from Scott County worked as scouts to guide these men north to the state line and see them on their way. One of those men was Hiram C. Marcum, who lived on Smith Creek.\n\nThe son of Arthur Marcum and Anna Bransgrove, Hiram Marcum was a brother to John Marcum Sr., the patriarch of the Marcum family that populated the area of Pine Creek west of Oneida.\n\nThe slave schedule of the 1860 U.S. Census shows Hiram Marcum owning a single slave — a one-year-old black girl. He was one of 10 slaveowners identified in Scott County in that 1860 census.\n\nBut Marcum was also staunchly pro-Union. He “was for freedom of our nation and its liberties for the people,” his daughter, Julia, later wrote. “In the year of 1861, the secedents declared war against the North. Father stood for the Union and its principles. He was a farmer, lived on his farm, made a living, and was a happy, law-abiding Christian man and also his family. He stood for the flag, the freedom of America, and its perfect laws.”\n\nAs summer turned to fall in 1861, Tennessee Gov. Isham Harris grew tired of gently persuading Union loyalists in East Tennessee to drop their resistance to the Confederacy. He called up thousands of additional troops and deployed them to East Tennessee, and ordered Gen. Felix Zolicoffer — the politician and newspaper editor who was in command of the Rebel forces in East Tennessee — to squelch the rebellion against the rebellion at any cost … including forcing pro-Union residents from their home and banishing them from the state, if necessary.\n\nBy the time September rolled around, the 11th Tennessee Infantry had encamped at Buffalo Creek, a mile and a half from Marcum’s farm. He had gotten word that they intended to hang him for helping to guide Union loyalists north to Kentucky, and so he had started hiding out in the forest at night rather than sleeping in his house.\n\nAt two o’clock in the morning on Sept. 7, 1861, a group of three dozen soldiers from the Confederate army arrived at the Marcum farm on Smith Creek. Inside the home were Hiram Marcum’s wife, Parmelia, and his children: 19-year-old Didama, 17-year-old Minerva, 16-year-old Julia, 14-year-old Claborn, and seven-year-old Martha.\n\n“They came to our house and hunted for father, watched night and day to kill him because he was a Union man for the federal side, and threatened his family with death if we did not tell where he was,” Julia wrote.\n\nThe Rebels busted down the door, demanding to know where Hiram Marcum was at. If they wouldn’t tell, the soldiers threatened, they would kill the women and children and burn their bodies inside the home.\n\nAs the women and children inside the home screamed for help, most of the soldiers ventured back outside, perhaps believing that the cries for help would bring Hiram Marcum out of hiding. But one remained. He grabbed Permelia Marcum and began choking her. The oldest daughter, Didama, ran upstairs to get a candle for light. The soldier grabbed her and said he was going to cut her throat and burn the house.\n\nMinerva and Julia grabbed axes — the only weapons in the home. Two more Confederate soldiers burst through the door, and Minerva dropped her axe in panic. But Julia ignored them. Desperate to save her sister, Didama, she swung at one of the soldiers and struck him in the face with the axe.\n\n“Cut him to the hollow and split his chin open with the axe, getting the best of him,” she wrote.\n\nThe soldier pleaded for mercy, saying, “Don’t chop me any more.” But he was able to get his hands back on his gun, and struck Julia in the forehead with his bayonet. “Burst my skull, knocked my brains out, put out my left eye and shot the third finger off my right hand,” she said.\n\nThe soldier was likely mortally wounded. But Hiram Marcum came through the door at just that time, and finished off the Rebel with a shot from his rifle.\n\nThe commander of the Confederate camp nearby, Col. George W. Gordon — who played a key role in the formation of the Ku Klux Klan after the war — arrived with some of his men to retrieve the dead soldier. When he saw Julia — gravely wounded and unconscious — he sent for the camp physician and had her wounds treated. David Jeffers, president of the Scott County Historical Society, says that Gordon intended to kill the family and burn the house, but when he saw that Julia Marcum was so badly injured, he assumed she would die and told the men under his command to leave them alone.\n\nJulia Marcum spent several months in bed, but eventually recovered. That winter, Confederate soldiers returned to the Marcum farm on Smith Creek. This time, Julia’s cousin, George Marcum, was on the farm. He was enlisted in the Union army, but wasn’t in uniform. He was attempting to slip past the Confederate regiments that were patrolling the area and return to his unit in Kentucky. He was hiding in the barn when the Rebels arrived. Julia, recently recovered from her wounds, saw the soldiers coming and ran from the home in an attempt to alert George. One of the Confederates fired at her, the bullet missing her but passing so close that she would later say it cut off a lock of her hair. George bolted from the barn in an effort to escape. But he was gunned down. He died a few hours later, and was buried at the Lloyd Cemetery on Smith Creek.\n\nThis second raid by the Confederate army was enough to convince the Marcum family it was time to leave. Hiram Marcum enlisted in the Union army. He would later die of smallpox while stationed at a federal army camp in Nashville. His wife and children went north to Kentucky, stopping first on the Green River in Casey County, Ky., before later settling on Flat Lick Creek, near Somerset.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nHiram Marcum is buried at a military cemetery in Nashville. Parmelia died in August 1865 and is buried at the Flat Lick Baptist Church in Pulaski County.\n\nIt was two months before her mother’s death in 1865 that Didama — the sister that Julia saved with the axe that night on their Smith Creek farm — married Dr. Lafayette Sproule in Pulaski County. Sproule was originally from Whitley County, Ky., south of Williamsburg and just a short distance northeast of Jellico.\n\nMinerva Marcum, the other sister who grabbed an axe that night on the farm, married Albert Wolford. He was a brother of Union Col. Frank Wolford — a famous cavalry commander during the Civil War. He was dishonorably discharged from the Union army during the war because he protested President Abraham Lincoln’s policy of enlisting African-American soldiers. He later delivered an anti-Lincoln speech in Danville, Ky. and was arrested by authorities. Lincoln intervened and ordered him released from prison. Wolford continued his speeches and was later arrested a second time. When he was told the charges would be dropped if he would stop speaking negatively against the president, he wrote to Lincoln, “Excuse the bluntness of a soldier, (but you have) by an exercise of arbitrary power caused me to be arrested and held in confinement contrary to law, not for the good of our common country, but to increase the chances of your re-election.”\n\nFrank Wolford was later elected to Congress, and worked to secure a pension for Julia Marcum. She became the first woman in the U.S. to be granted a pension as a combatant in the Civil War.\n\nBack to Scott County\n\nMuch surrounding the time that Dr. Lafayette Sproule and his wife, Didama Marcum, spent in Scott County remains a mystery. It is also a mystery how Sproule — who by any account would’ve been considered an outsider — managed to be elected school superintendent by the county court in a rural community where outsiders were generally distrusted. It’s simply conjecture, but one can only assume that Julia Marcum’s heroic actions from 1861 in this county that was so deeply loyal to the Union resonated with members of the county court.\n\nAnother assumption would be that Sproule did not serve a full term as school superintendent, since the family was listed in Williamsburg, Ky. when the 1870 census was taken.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that when she wrote her short autobiography in 1926, Julia Marcum wrote that she moved back to Tennessee for 12 years after the war and taught school before her injuries forced her to retire. Julia was living with her sister, Didama, when the 1870 census was taken. When the 1880 census was taken 10 years later, she was living with her younger sister, Martha, north of Somerset, while the Sproule family had moved to Casey County, Ky.\n\nBased on Julia Marcum’s own writings, she appears to have spent 12 years teaching school in Tennessee between 1865 and 1880. It’s not clear how Lafayette Sproule and family are listed — along with Julia — in Williamsburg, Ky. in 1870, when he was ostensibly serving as school superintendent in Scott County and Julia was ostensibly teaching here.\n\nNevertheless, it seems clear that Lafayette Spaule who served as Scott County’s second superintendent of schools beginning in 1869 was actually Dr. Lafayette Sproule, the wife of Didama Marcum and brother-in-law of Civil War heroine Julia Marcum.\n\nJulia eventually settled down near Dr. Sproule and her sister Didama in Williamsburg. By 1926, she was the only surviving member of her family. She wrote: “I am still here yet to enjoy the great blessings of life and God’s love.”\n\nTen years later, Julia Marcum died of pneumonia at age 91. She, Didama, and Didama’s husband, Lafayette Sproule, are all buried near one another at Williamsburg’s Highland Cemetery."
