ZUUS reverts to its original name...\n\n29-3\n\n(480i/2.0) Primarily western and action movies.\n\n11-1\n\n15-1 CHCH\n\nCHCH-DT 132 kW 1175' Hamilton\n\n(1080i/5.1) Despite financial problems, CHCH remains on the air with news, shows, movies and more.\n\n56-X\n\n17-1 Independent\n\nWBXZ-LP 15 kW 548' Buffalo\n\nSince WBXZ does not have a true primary affiliation, its substations are listed below. Note that this is a \"Low Power\" station, so reception will be greatly limited outside of the Buffalo area. NOTE Nov/17: this listing is not current. Reports are there may be no subchannels currently?\n\n56-1\n\n(480i/2.0) Classic television and movies from the 1950's to the 1980's.\n\n56-2\n\n(480i/2.0) Sitcoms and dramas from the 1950's to the 1980's and beyond.\n\n56-3\n\n(480i/2.0) Focused on cars.\n\n56-4\n\nThrowback TV\n\n(480i/2.0) An independent station featuring public domain content, infomercials, and so forth.\n\n56-5\n\n(480i/2.0) Children's television network primarily broadcasting from the DreamWorks Classics library of shows.\n\n19-1\n\n19-1 TV Ontario\n\nCICA-DT 107 kW 1611' CN Tower\n\n(Toronto)\n\n(1080i/5.1) TVO has a strong, reliable signal!\n\n5-1\n\n20-1 CBC\n\nCBLT-DT 38 kW 1611' 100 kW\n\n1640' CN Tower\n\n(Toronto)\n\n(720p/5.1 & 2.0)\n\n51-1\n\n23-1 ION\n\nWPXJ-DT 455 kW 906' Batavia\n\n(Buffalo)\n\n(720p/2.0) The situation is a little confusing in Buffalo now - with \"channel 23\" broadcasting on 32-1, and \"channel 51\" broadcasting on 23-1...\n\n51-2\n\n(480i/2.0) Childrens' programming made up of a 6-hour block of shows repeated 4 times each day.\n\n51-3\n\n(480i/2.0) Lifestyle programming: health and wellness, cooking, home decor, travel and more.\n\n51-4\n\nIon SHOP\n\n(480i/2.0) Mostly paid programming.\n\n51-5\n\n(480i/2.0) Televised home shopping.\n\n51-6\n\n(480i/2.0) More televised home shopping.\n\n25-1\n\n25-1 CBC French\n\nCBLFT-DT 99 kW 1640' CN Tower\n\n(Toronto)\n\n(720p/5.1) French programming from Radio-Canada.\n\n26-1\n\n26-1 TCT\n\nWNYB-DT 234 kW 1519' 1000 kW Jamestown\n\n(480i/2.0) Religious network. WNYB has applied for an increase to 1000 kW transmission power.\n\n26-2\n\nTCT-HD\n\n(1080i/5.1) Interestingly, the high definition channel is a subchannel rather than the primary channel. Occasionally shows old TV shows such as Bonanza.\n\n39-1\n\n29-1 Daystar\n\nWDTB-LP 15 kW 586' Hamburg\n\n(Buffalo)\n\nLow-powered channel with religious programming.\n\n23-1\n\n32-1 The CW\n\nWNLO-DT 1000 kW 994' Grand Island\n\n(Buffalo)\n\n(1080i/5.1) One of the two highest powered HDTV channels in the region, and very reliable for both Canadians and Americans.\n\n23-2\n\n(480i/2.0) Programming geared towards African American viewers.\n\n2-1\n\n33-1 NBC\n\nWGRZ-DT 480 kW 968' South Wales\n\n(Buffalo)\n\n(1080i/5.1) WGRZ can be one of the more difficult channels from south Buffalo to receive reliably, even compared to the lower-powered WKBW.\n\n2-2\n\n(480i/2.0) Airs retro television shows.\n\n2-3\n\n(480i/2.0) Features true crime, investigation, and forensic science documentary series.\n\n36-1\n\n36-1 YesTV\n\nCITS-DT 493 kW 1110' Hamilton\n\n(1080i/5.1) Formerly Crossroads, now with mainstream programming.\n\n7-1\n\n38-1 ABC\n\nWKBW-DT 358 kW 1420' 723 kW Colden\n\n(Buffalo)\n\n(720p/5.1) Despite WKBW's power level and distance, their signal has been unexpectedly reliable for me personally - better than the higher powered WIVB or WGRZ. Heavy echo effect used to matrix local 2.0 audio to 5.1 surround can be distracting.\n\n7-2\n\n(480i/2.0) Features comedy programms, such as movies and sitcom reruns.\n\n7-3\n\n(480i/2.0) Targeted to women. Features movies and true crime documentary series.\n\n4-1\n\n39-1 CBS\n\nWIVB-DT 790 kW 1368' Colden\n\n(Buffalo)\n\n(1080i/5.1) Considering their high power levels, WIVB is inexplicably one of the most difficult of the 3 South Buffalo channels to receive reliably from my location.\n\n40-1\n\n40-1 OMNI.2\n\nCJMT-DT 19.5 kW 1645' CN Tower\n\n(Toronto)\n\n(1080i/5.1)\n\n41-1\n\n41-1 Global\n\nCIII-DT 100 kW 1650' CN Tower\n\n(Toronto)\n\n(1080i/5.1) Now broadcasting from channel 41. Global shows a wide range of high definition content, although I personally find their image a touch on the soft side compared to other stations and occasionally suffers from visible compression artifacts. Note to Global engineers: please turn off the volume compression!\n\n41-2\n\nGlobal SD\n\n(480i/2.0) Duplicate SD rebroadcast.\n\n17-1\n\n43-1 PBS\n\nWNED-DT 156 kW 1076' Grand Island\n\n(Buffalo)\n\n(1080i/5.1 & 2.0) As close to rock solid 24 x 7 HDTV as you can get! Will begin broadcasting PBS Kids on a subchannel in Spring 2017.\n\n17-2\n\nCREATE/div>\n\n(480i/2.0 & 1.0) WNED-Th, featuring how-to, DIY and lifestyle-oriented programming.\n\nAUD\n\nWNED-FM Classical 94.5\n\n(2.0) Auxiliary audio program (also available on 17-2). Might get this on some sets as 43-10?\n\nAUD\n\nWBFO-FM 88.7\n\n(2.0) Auxiliary audio program (also available on 17-2).\n\n57-1\n\n44-1 Citytv\n\nCITY-DT 21 kW 1645' CN Tower\n\n(Toronto)\n\n(1080i/5.1)\n\n47-1\n\n47-1 OMNI.1\n\nCFMT-DT 22.2 kW 1645' CN Tower\n\n(Toronto)\n\n(1080i/5.1)\n\n49-1\n\n49-1 My TV\n\nWNYO-DT 198 kW 1165' Wyoming\n\n(Buffalo)\n\n(720p/5.1) Now with numerous subchannels.\n\n49-2\n\n(480i/2.0) All music videos, plus a three-hour block of children's programming.\n\n49-3\n\n(480i/2.0) Science fiction and fantasy television shows and movies, primarily from the MGM library."
