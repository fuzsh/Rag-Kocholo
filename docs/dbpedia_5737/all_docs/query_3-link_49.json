        "text": "Good morning! Today we’re lowering our price ranges a bit again, and looking at two nice old sedans from defunct GM brand Oldsmobile. Eagle-eyed Coen Brothers fans will also recognize these two as the Oldsmobile models most prominently featured in the 1996 film Fargo. That’s not important, but it just occurred to me, so I had to point it out.\n\nYesterday we looked at a couple of Ford-based RVs, and I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect. Would you choose the cheaper, larger, but scruffier option, or the tiny, neat-as-a-pin truck that might be a bit overpriced? Well, it looks like your frugal side won this round by quite a large margin; the F-250 took an easy win.\n\nAnd I suppose I have to agree. That little Courier is way cool, but it’s expensive for what it is. The F-250, with more room and more amenities for three grand less, just makes more sense. Man, practicality is annoying sometimes.\n\nAll right; let’s check out some nice bargain-priced Oldsmobile sedans. Yah? Yaaah. Real good.\n\n1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera LS – $2,400\n\nEngine/drivetrain: 3.0-liter overhead valve V6, four-speed automatic, FWD\n\nLocation: Littleton, CO\n\nOdometer reading: 97,000 miles\n\nOperational status: “Runs and drives like new”\n\nWhen an automaker has a really popular nameplate, they tend to milk it for all it’s worth. Oldsmobile had a hit on its hands with the Cutlass nameplate; for a few years it was the best-selling car in the US. But then things got confusing. In 1985, when this car was built, Oldsmobile sold three completely different cars, all with the Cutlass nameplate. There was the FWD compact Cutlass Calais, the RWD Cutlass Supreme, and this car: the mid-sized FWD Cutlass Ciera.\n\nThe Ciera highlights Oldsmobile’s identity crisis in the ’80s; they weren’t really the sporty division; that was Pontiac. Neither were they the low-end luxury division; that spot was taken by Buick. The ads told us “This Is Not Your Father’s Oldsmobile,” but then, whose was it? They were nice cars, but sort of redundant, which is why Oldsmobile ended up getting axed later. (GM’s decision to end Pontiac is far more confusing.)\n\nThis Ciera is powered by a Buick-sourced 90-degree V6, a de-stroked version of the famous 3.8/3800, displacing 3.0 liters. It’s backed by an overdrive automatic with a traditional column-mounted shifter. It’s still under 100,000 miles, and the seller says it runs and drives like new. Cieras, and the A-body cars in general, enjoyed a pretty good reputation for durability and reliability, so this car should have lots of life left if it has been maintained.\n\nCosmetically, it’s OK, but not great. The interior is a little grubby, and the driver’s seat has a popped seam, and the seller admits they took the exterior photos of the car in the rain. It’s probably nowhere near that shiny in person. Still, it’s rust-free, and straight, which is more than I can say for the seller’s parking job.\n\n1989 Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight Royale – $1,995\n\nEngine/drivetrain: 3.8-liter overhead valve V6, four-speed automatic, FWD\n\nLocation: Hanover, PA\n\nOdometer reading: 141,000 miles\n\nOperational status: Runs and drives well\n\nOldsmobile played a bit of a name game with its full-sized sedan, too. One year earlier, this car would have worn a badge that said “Delta 88.” But for 1989, Oldsmobile dropped the “Delta,” in use since 1965, and spelled out the name as “Eighty-Eight.” The larger and fancier 98 got the same treatment, becoming the Ninety-Eight. These new names were spelled out in a neat sans-serif font on the rear quarter panels, a more modern look than the script font of the old badges.\n\nAll Eighty-Eights got the same engine and transmission: Buick’s 3800 V6 and a four-speed 4T60 automatic. We are told this one runs and drives, but we don’t get a lot more detail. It’s being sold by a dealership, and I get the feeling they’re just trying to get rid of it, probably because of its age. It’s not quite old enough to be a classic, and it’s definitely not special enough. It’s just an old car, but it’s in nice condition.\n\nThis is the fancy Royale version, so it has a bunch of power toys to play with, more trim outside, and more padding inside. It looks like it has been well cared for. Being a thirty-five-year-old GM product, some of the fancy power stuff probably doesn’t work, but at least the upholstery and carpets are clean and intact. These are quite comfortable cars, too.\n\nOutside, it’s a nice shiny dark blue, with lots of brightwork. The whitewalls are a nice period touch, but you’d be well advised to check the date codes on them; better to deal with blackwalls if you have to than risk a blowout. And since it’s in Pennsylvania, a peek underneath to check for rust isn’t a terrible idea either.\n\nWhen you’re looking at these, consider the price: Two grand or thereabouts is cheap for a car that isn’t a rustbucket or gushing fluids these days. The days of the $500 beater are gone, and they aren’t coming back. These are both low-mileage, fairly clean, honest-looking used cars. Which one strikes you as the better deal?\n\n(Image credits: Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist sellers)"
