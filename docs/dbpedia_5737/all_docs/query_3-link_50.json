        "text": "The swift demise of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2022 had damaging domino effects on the cryptocurrency industry, stoking widespread mistrust among the public and toppling cryptocurrency services that did business with it. At the time, FTX was the third-largest crypto exchange.\n\nLearn more about what went wrong with FTX, including the role and trial outcome of its founder and former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWhat Happened to FTX?\n\nFTX was a leading cryptocurrency exchange that went bankrupt in November 2022 amid allegations that its owners had embezzled and misused customer funds. Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of the exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to repay $11 billion.\n\nThe catalyst was a Nov. 2 scoop by crypto news site CoinDesk revealing that the majority of assets held by Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm and sister company also run by Bankman-Fried, consisted of FTT and other tokens invented and controlled by FTX and its insiders, rather than a fiat currency or cryptocurrency with market-driven and time-tested value.\n\nScores of investors and customers pulled their funds out of FTX, forcing the exchange to become insolvent and declare bankruptcy. The revelations prompted concern across the cryptocurrency industry that FTX was overly leveraged with Alameda Research, relied on precarious financial accounting metrics, and faced associated financial management risks.\n\nThe End of FTX: A Sequence of Events\n\nThe following is a play-by-play recapping of FTX's implosion and bankruptcy, and law enforcement's civil and criminal prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nBinance Sells All Its FTT Tokens\n\nBinance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, announced on Nov. 6 that it would sell its entire position in FTT tokens—roughly 23 million FTT tokens valued at about $529 million. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said the decision to liquidate the exchange’s FTT position was based on risk management following the collapse of the Terra (LUNA) stablecoin earlier in 2022.\n\nFTX Liquidity Crisis and Binance Deal\n\nBy the next day, on Nov. 7, 2022, FTX was experiencing a liquidity crisis. Bankman-Fried attempted to reassure FTX investors that its assets were stable, but customers demanded withdrawals worth $6 billion following the CoinDesk report. Bankman-Fried sought additional money from venture capitalists before turning to Binance, its competitor. The value of FTT fell by more than 80% in two days.\n\nOn Nov. 8, Binance announced it had reached a non-binding agreement to buy the non-U.S. business of FTX for an undisclosed sum, potentially bailing out its close rival.\n\nBinance Cancels FTX Bail Out\n\nThe promise of a rescue was short-lived. One day later, on Nov. 8, Binance backed out of the deal. On Nov. 9, 2022, the exchange said it would cancel the transaction after corporate due diligence raised concerns about FTX's mishandling of customer funds, among other issues.\n\nFTX Assets Frozen\n\nOn Nov. 10, 2022, The Bahamas’ securities regulator froze the assets of FTX Digital Markets, FTX’s Bahamian subsidiary, following news that Bankman-Fried was seeking up to $8 billion in capital to bail out the exchange. On the same day, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation announced it had initiated an investigation into FTX.\n\nBankman-Fried apologized for the liquidity crisis and admitted on Twitter (now known as X) that FTX’s non-U.S. exchange had insufficient funds in reserve to meet customer demands. Bankman-Fried said “poor internal labeling” caused FTX to miscalculate leverage and liquidity and that Alameda would shutter its trading operations.\n\nBankman-Fried Steps Down and FTX Files for Bankruptcy\n\nBankman-Fried stepped down on Nov. 11 as CEO of FTX and a court appointed as his successor John J. Ray III, an American executive who led energy trading firm Enron through bankruptcy proceedings after an accounting scandal fabricating corporate earnings was discovered.\n\nFTX, along with a vast corporate structure of roughly 130 other affiliated companies, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the same day. The bankruptcy filings indicated FTX had assets and liabilities each in the range of $10 billion to $50 billion.\n\nSuspected FTX Hack\n\nWithin hours of filing for bankruptcy, FTX said it was the victim of “unauthorized transactions” and that it would move its digital assets to cold storage for security purposes. Outside analysts said they suspected about $477 million was stolen from FTX in the purported hack.\n\nLawsuit Filed Against FTX and Celebrity Promoters\n\nOn Nov. 16, a class-action lawsuit was filed in a Florida federal court, alleging FTX was a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme designed to take advantage of unsophisticated investors across the U.S. High-profile celebrities and professional athletes such as Stephen Curry, Shaquille O’Neal, Shohei Ohtani, Naomi Osaka, Larry David, and Kevin O’Leary were liable for promoting FTX, the lawsuit further claimed.\n\nThe Bahamas Takes Control of FTX Digital Assets\n\nOn Nov. 18, the Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB) seized cryptocurrency assets held by FTX. The SCB said it instructed Bankman-Fried to move crypto assets to the regulator’s possession to protect creditors from suspected cyberattacks.\n\nBankman-Fried Arrested and Charged\n\nBahamian authorities arrested and jailed Bankman-Fried on Dec. 12, 2022, at the request of the U.S. government. Bankman-Fried was then extradited to the U.S. on Dec. 21.\n\nOn Dec. 13, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment charging Bankman-Fried with eight criminal counts alleging wire and securities fraud, money laundering, and unlawful campaign finance contributions. The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also brought enforcement actions pursuing civil claims of securities and commodities fraud.\n\nAccording to the agencies, Bankman-Fried and top executives lied about FTX's financial health to investors, customers, and lenders and hid a billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet with fake financial statements, inflated valuations of speculative tokens like FTX's FTT exchange coin, and cryptocurrencies borrowed from lenders.\n\nExchange reserves were depleted, exacerbating the risk of insolvency, after FTX management allegedly misappropriated at least $8 billion in customer deposits to foot heavy Alameda losses, luxury real estate and yacht purchases, business investments, and charitable and political donations.\n\nNew FTX CEO Ray stated in a bankruptcy court filing on Nov. 17: \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\" Ray went on to tell U.S. Congress on Dec. 13 that FTX practiced \"no bookkeeping\" and \"old-fashioned embezzlement.”\n\nBankman-Fried Released on Bail\n\nFollowing a court hearing on Dec. 22, a federal judge decided to release Bankman-Fried from custody after his attorneys and federal prosecutors agreed to a $250 million bond, the largest bail amount on record in the U.S.\n\nUnder the terms of his bail, the 30-year-old former crypto executive was permitted to live under house arrest with his Stanford law professor parents in Palo Alto, Calif., while wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet. Bankman-Fried pled not guilty to all criminal charges on Jan. 3, 2023.\n\nBankman-Fried Charged Again\n\nThe DOJ filed an additional four criminal charges related to unlicensed money transmission and other categories of fraud against Bankman-Fried on Feb. 23, 2023, and a foreign bribery charge on March 28, 2023.\n\nThe superseding indictment alleged Bankman-Fried violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by authorizing a $40 million bribe to one or more Chinese government officials to restore Alameda Research cryptocurrency holdings frozen by Chinese law enforcement. Bankman-Fried pled not guilty to these charges on March 30, 2023.\n\nBankman-Fried Moved Back to Prison\n\nOn July 20, 2023, prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried of attempted witness tampering toward his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison by leaking contents of her diary to the New York Times. Ellison succeeded him as CEO of Alameda when he launched FTX.\n\nA week later, on July 26, a federal judge placed Bankman-Fried under a gag order, prohibiting him from communicating with the public and the media. Bankman-Fried then had his bail revoked on Aug. 11 and was remanded on Aug. 14, 2023, to the Metropolitan Detention Center, a notorious prison in Brooklyn.\n\nEllison and other FTX and Alameda Research executives, including Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, and Ryan Salame, had been criminally charged on similar counts and agreed to testify for the government as part of their guilty pleas.\n\nBankman-Fried Convicted on First Set of Charges\n\nBankman-Fried's trial for seven of the eight pre-extradition criminal charges began Oct. 2, 2023, and ended Nov. 1. The jury returned guilty convictions on all seven charges on Nov. 2.\n\nThroughout the trial, executives, customers, and investors testified that Bankman-Fried directed employees or acted in his personal capacity to spend customer deposits for non-business purposes and to make material misstatements about FTX's solvency and relationship with Alameda Research.\n\nThe DOJ had dropped an eighth charge, a campaign finance charge, on Jul. 26, 2023, to comply with procedural rules of the U.S.'s extradition treaty with The Bahamas.\n\nDamian Williams, the U.S. District Attorney leading the criminal prosecution, said when announcing the charges and convictions that Bankman-Fried \"perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.\"\n\nBankman-Fried Sentenced\n\nOn March 28, 2024, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $11 billion.\n\nFuture of FTX and Consequences of Collapse\n\nAs the largest collapse of an exchange in the short history of cryptocurrencies, the events at FTX have deterred cautious investors from staying put in the market, and business partners owed money have shuttered.\n\nCrypto Contagion\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges like Crypto.com downsized due to a surge of customer withdrawals following FTX's collapse. Cryptocurrency lenders and banks BlockFi, Genesis Global, Celsius, and Voyager Digital underwent bankruptcy liquidations and legal proceedings themselves for authorizing severely undercollateralized loans to FTX and Alameda Research and overlooking the risk profile on repayments. One lender, Genesis, and its parent company, Digital Currency Group, were sued by the Winklevoss-founded crypto exchange Gemini for defaulting on lending agreements with Gemini's Earn product.\n\nBlockFi began shutting down its services in November 2022 and declared bankruptcy. Its web platform was deactivated on May 31, 2024.\n\nRegulatory Crackdown\n\nRegulators have called for greater government oversight of cryptocurrencies. Law enforcement has tightened scrutiny of cryptocurrencies, both domestically and internationally, and has sought to limit exposure to traditional markets. Members of Congress have said they are more inclined to legislate new protections governing digital tokens and exchanges.\n\nReimbursements\n\nOn May 7, 2024, Kroll Restructuring filed a disclosure statement outlining a plan to repay creditors and customers. According to the plan, customers will receive 100% of their holdings back at the bankruptcy petition date rate, but with interest. The plan anticipates a repayment rate of between 127% and 142% for website and U.S. customers, who have been given priority over several other claimants, who are planned to receive between zero and 118% depending on the claim class they belong to.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFTX is a prime example of how not to run a business, especially one in an industry so young as cryptocurrency. In addition to being sloppily managed, its owners used it to take money from investors for personal use and to fund bad business decisions.\n\nThe stunning collapse of FTX and the following shock waves that razed other businesses have further increased the slippery slope the industry is built on. It will be used for many years to come as a case study for examining modern financial crimes and corporate compliance and governance."
