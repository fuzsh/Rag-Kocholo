The period of 1922 to 193 2 saw the birth of this new medium with its capacity for public service. The next decade, 1932-42 were years of commercial development with the pattern of potentialities seemingly boundless. In the third period, 1942-195 2 radio at- tained its full stature as a medium of com- munications. This year with radio on the threshold of a prosperous new decade, Radio Annual is proud to record the progress of the commu- nications art. In this, our 15 th annual edition, we give permanent record to the achievements of those whose creative energy sustains this expanding communications ser- vice.

WALKER Chairman Federal Communications Commission THE year 1952 will be forever memorable in broadcasting history for the inaugura- tion of America's new nationwide, improved, expanded, and competitive system of televi- sion. That this system will be accorded a hearty welcome by the American public goes with- out saying. The hunger for television all over the nation can be judged no better than by examining the huge volume of correspondence with which the Commission has been deluged. The great mass of people who have seen televisionhave taken it to their hearts. The great mass who do not have it are demanding it with ever-increasing impatience. The scope of this industry is so great, the potential investments are sohuge, the stake of the public in its stability and acceptability is so vital that the Commission has had to exercise maximum care in laying the foundation. The new system will provide for a minimu mof 2000 assignments. Just how soon that many stations can be built remains to be seen. The enterprise of industry, the ability of smaller communities to support stations, the availability of materials and manpower — all these are factors in determining the speed at which the new system will grow. Here I would sound a note of warning. With television station construction dammed up for three and a half years, it is easy to sympathize with the eagerness of those entrepreneurs who have been waiting so long to start building. I know their problems. Their money has been earmarked. Their plans have long been made. They want to see their towers go up. But they must realize the realities of the Commission's position. With a limited staff, the Commission cannot process applications on a land-office scale. These applications, with their legal, technical and financial questions, are complex matters. It takes experienced personnel to process them. When new people are hired they must be specially trained. And the many hearings that we know will be necessary involve even greater delays. Applicants would do well to inform themselves of the real nature of* the task that con- fronts the Commission not only for their own benefit but also so that they can intelligently answer the questions that are asked of them by members of their community. While the Commission bends every effort to foster the growth of this new medium of mass communications, it is well to ponder the responsibilities that industry has to build soundly for the future. Every attention should be given to the development of program- ming that will truly serve the real needs of the communities. Television cannot be merely a luxury service or a toy or a pastime. To play an indispensable role in the nation's life, television must perform the crucial service of informing the citizens on the issues of the day. While many basic questions involved in building television have been decided or are in the process of being decided, many others will confront us in the future. 33 GUY LOMBARDO and his Royal Canadians AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE BAND LUCKY STRIKES' \"YOUR HIT PARADE\", NBC HOTEL ROOSEVELT GRILL, NEW YORK F. W. ZIV CO. TRANSCRIPTIONS DECCA RECORDS CONCERTS NUMBER ONE WITH FANS AND EDITORS Publicity: DAVID O. ALBER ASSOC Gene Shefrin 34 NARTB PROGRESS REPORT By HAROLD E. FELLOWS, President, National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters Fellows example of this JUST as they have throughout the his- tory of radio and television, legislative and regulatory matters continue to be among the major problems facing the broadcasting indus- try. It is heartening to note, however, that some of our leg- islators are well aware of the vital role played by broad- casting on the nation- al scene in times of peace and war. As more of the public's elected representa- tives learn something of our business, the task of preserving the system of free enterprise broadcast- ing will be eased. A most encouragim legislative understanding is contained in recent statements and discussions by Sen- ator Edwin C. Johnson, Chairman of the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, and some of his colleagues on that committee, and in some of the regu- lations issued by the Federal Communi- cations Commission. It is gratifying to observe the develop- ment of this type of thinking. Our in- tegrity, objectives and sense of personal and professional responsibility constitute a \"priceless ingredient.\" It must be cher- ished, nurtured and protected. We can and will, through daily performance, maintain this high regard for our efforts. Broadcasting stands at the threshold of its greatest era. As the new year opened broadcasters were serving ap- proximately forty-three million radio homes. Most of the nearly fourteen mil- lion home receivers manufactured, ac- cording to RTMA figures, since the 1950 national census are in use. More than seventy-five per cent of all new automo- biles are radio equipped. Indications are that set manufacturers will be unable to meet 1952 demands if defense needs con- tinue to restrict materials. As 1951 closed there were 2,327 AM stations— 95 more than when the year opened — 648 FM sta- tions and 108 TV stations on the air. I am confident that when the \"freeze\" is lifted television will keep apace of this expansion and join other mass communi- cations media in all the national markets. I do not agree, however, with those who doom radio to oblivion with the advent of the \"thaw.\" In the light of mass media history it seems more logical to regard radio and television as complementary rather than competing, media. Each will command specific areas of service in our ever-enlarging nation. Advertising, the nerve system of Amer- ica's economy, is getting bigger and bet- ter. So long as consumers need goods and services and manufacturers and suppliers need customers both radio and television will perform importantly in the success- ful fusion of these elements. There may of necessity be a period of adjustment as television undergoes its growing pains, ailments very similar to those suffered and survived by radio back in the 1920s; and as radio is shaken from a complacency developed through long- time dominance in the communications field. But each will survive to find a right- ful position in the plane of national pros- perity and the family circle of mass com- munications media. Radio and television have compiled im- pressive records of public service to the nation. This year will be no exception. Since the outbreak of hostilities in Korea each has volunteered heavily of facilities for broadcasting in the emergency. To cite cases . . . Civil Defense instruction; De- fense Bond sales; blood bank appeals; recruitment campaigns; state-of-the-na- tion addresses by the President and other governmental leaders. I doubt that a single broadcaster has let these patriotic calls go unheeded. I also doubt that any of the other media have made more substantial contributions. This policy of cooperation will continue as long as there is a job to be done. In this year of national elections both media welcome the opportunity to further serve the public interest by performing the important task of bringing the candi- dates and their platforms into the living rooms of the voters. Arrangements have already been made to broadcast and tele- cast the national conventions of both major political parties, to stage get-out- the-vote campaigns and to give election (Continued on Page 74) 35 JACK BENNY 36 RADIO-TV FORGING AHEAD By FRANK BURKE, Editor of Radio-Television Daily Burke RADIO and television are doing right well in this year 1952 despite prophets of gloom who had radio on the ropes the past year and television trying to find its place in the nation's advertising pattern. After a year of re- appraisal in which radio took stock of its potency as a medium and counted its cir- culation as compared to other advertising services, both net- works and stations predicted that 1952 would bring billing increases from 10 to 15 per cent. Total gross radio billings of the networks last year aggregated $185,- 000,000. The television outlook is even brighter. In 1950 the four TV networks billings totalled around $45,000,000, while the past year saw TV billings mount to over 239.5 million. Some are predicting that billings this year will pass the $300,000,000 mark. Of 106 TV stations (i.e., including all but two of the network owned and op- erated stations for which data was not separately available) 93 reported profit- able operations during 1951. Of these, 10 stations reported income between $600,000 and $1.0 million; eight stations between $1.0 and $1.5 million and five stations re- ported incomes in excess of $1.5 million. The median income of the 93 stations was $350,000 as compared to a median income of $129,200 for 53 stations reporting a profit in 1950. Several factors contributed to revitalized radio sales and promotion drives. Efforts of the Association of National Advertisers to beat down radio rates in TV markets and the subsequent radio rate cuts by net- works put the radio broadcasters in a fighting mood. This was especially true in non-TV markets with the broadcasters stepping up the tempo of their sales promotion. The advent of Broadcast Advertising Bureau, Inc., as a sales and promotion ser- vice organization to the radio broadcasters was a stimulating hypo to the industry. During the past year BAB under the able direction of William B. Ryan, president, has brought the story of radio's sales effectiveness to all sections of the country and has engendered enthusiastic support of broadcaster members in the work of the organization. Another campaign which attracted na- tion-wide attention was the combined ef- forts of radio broadcasters in the Detroit area to sell radio as a community service to the listeners as well as the advertisers. Adopting the slogan, \"Everywhere You Go There's Radio,\" the Motor City broad- casters staged a most effective campaign which was copied in many other com- munities and brought revived interest in the medium. National spot radio and sales on the local level have aided materially in keep- ing up the billings of stations throughout the country. The spot business picture is bright and 1952 should find more national advertisers using local and regional webs than ever before in the history of broad- casting. The television outlook is most promis- ing. With the lifting of the TV freeze and the channel allocations in many secondary markets it is expected that before year's end the number of TV stations on the air will increase from 108 stations operating in 67 cities to probably 200 stations. On January 15 there were a total of 450 VHF applications on file and 29 UHF applicants. It is expected that the number of UHF applications will increase considerably with the lifting of the freeze. The UHF stations, according to IRE spokesmen, will probably spread to the secondary markets where UHF transmitters and receivers will be the first television to be introduced in those areas. The coming national political conven- tions and the national election is expected to boom TV receiver sales in established markets this summer and fall. Manufac- turers, distributors and dealers are plan- ning intensive promotional and sales cam- paigns to swell the TV audience to around 20,000,000 sets by Election Day. At present there are around 15,000,000 sets in use in the United States. The audience potential for this election year is expected to swell to around 65,000,000 persons. The rejuvenation of radio and the boundless opportunities for expansion in the television industry augurs well for 1952-53. 37 MR. TELEVISION 38 TEN T©IP IflAPOO-TV NEW!

NINETEEN HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO will mark .the Broadcast Advertising Bu- reau's first full year as a completely independent corporation. We feel that this calls for a restate- ment of aims and an elaboration of activi- ties. First, a little back- ground information. The BAB is an out- growth of the Broad- cast Advertising De- s^J partment of the Na- tional Association of Broadcasters. In June of 1949 it was estab- lished as a Bureau of that organization and then in April 1951 Ryan started functioning as a separate corporation. It grew out of radio's need for an independent, alert and progressive pro- motion Bureau. Upon becoming an independent and autonomous corporation this past April, BAB had two immediate objectives: 1. It had to organize itself and redefine its objectives in order to be in a position to immediately render ser- vice to the entire industry. 2. It had to increase and extend the number and variety of services for- merly provided. Both of these were accomplished. Here's a report of how the BAB is ac- complishing these aims. Services are distributed within the two general categories of national and local promotion. The distinction between the two can best be arrived at by an analyza- tion of the individual projects. On the national level, BAB promotional activities concern themselves basically with spot and network advertisers. This is being accomplished through a series of projects designed to present radio's im- pact to national advertisers, national chains and associations, and national-local advertisers. For instance, a series of spe- cial presentations on radio's values are now underway and include those scaled to the needs of specific industries. Plans also call for a basic presentation on radio and another dealing with the farm market. BAB's national promotion department is also instituting regular communication with advertisers and agencies in the form of two direct mail pieces, each to be issued twice monthly. Advertisers receive a sales letter containing special data pertinent to radio sales while agencies are earmarked for a \"Kiplinger-type\" newsletter on radio advertising activities. In the field of basic research BAB is not only collecting and evaluating extant materials, but also plans a series of studies to learn the true value of radio coverage, saturation and sales impact. There will be a pilot study to determine the size of the extra-set market; a test to determine the sales impact of radio vis-a-vis other advertising media in the packaged goods and heavy appliance field; an interim report on all material now extant on all out-of-home listening plus automobile- radio coverage and listening pattern, to be followed in the spring by a national sampling of car-radio listening. In the competitive aspects of radio sales, BAB will publish a salesman's handbook containing basic facts of newspaper read- ership. Preparation is also underway on a second edition of a previously BAJ3- distributed volume on magazine county- by-county circulation statistics, with a comparison of radio-magazine penetration on a national basis plus an additional pres- entation containing all information avail- able on the trend, pattern and size of radio listening in radio-TV homes. Local promotional activities will in- clude a continuation of several services instituted to stations during the past year; the revision from a quality and quantity standpoint of many ohers, plus the addi- tion of three new projects. BAB's local promotion falls into two basic categories: 1. Regular releases on a weekly or monthly basis, and 2. Special projects. The first category includes such well- received services as BAB Salesman, Retail Information Folders, Co-op Cards & Bulle- tins, Local Business Sales Aids, Sales Opportunities, Library Bulletin, Radio Gets Results, Reports and Copy-Minded Selling Aids. . . . while BAB's plans in the special project field include a master presentation containing a summary of all salient rea- sons why local merchants should buy (Continued on Page 74) 41 RED SKELTON TELEVISION For Procter and Gamble (A Russell M.

GAMBLE, President, A.A.A.A. R Gamble WHAT is the year's outlook for adver- tising volume, and hence for radio and television billings? The new year brings a number of rea- sons why there should be no letup in advertising effort — but rather a step- up. While many com- panies have reported increased sales, they have also shown a considerable decline in their net profits; they will need to in- crease sales even further to maintain profits in the face of higher taxes and higher break - even points. We have seen continued buyer resis- tance in a number of lines that are still in ready supply. There is still a considerable accumu- lation of inventories in distribution chan- nels. We are hearing concern, already, whether industry will successfully adjust from defense production — whether we can find customers over the next few years for a vastly expanded output of goods and services without some degree of re- cession. Whether or not there will be a substan- tial increase in advertising effort will be at the decision of business management. And it will depend to a large extent on advertising agencies. Agencies have the job of convincing business that the results will justify aggressive advertising activity. In the midst of high costs, their advertising plans must be still more effective. They will need all the help, ammunition and co- operation that media can give. Among media, it seems to me that broadcasting faces the year's opportuni- ties with some new assets to its credit. There is the recomposition of the na- tional organization, as the NARTB, under new leadership. And there is the recon- stitution of Broadcast Advertising Bu- reau, with an organized sales program and under new leadership. There is also the reconstitution of Ad- vertising Research Foundation, as a fully tri-partite organization open to broad- casters and other media as participating subscribers. Given strong support by broadcasters, there is machinery here to do broadcasting research that has recently been much agitated for. There has also been a healthy tendency, in broadcasting, to review time and talent costs in relation to general program effec- tiveness. It is healthy and fore-armed, I think, because advertisers will be in- creasingly cost conscious about all media during 1952. At the same time, there are places in the broadcaster-agency relationship where we are still surprisingly weak. We must strengthen our business rela- tionship— in such fundamentals as rate cards and contracts, to facilitate time buying — in improving station billing prac- tices, in speeding up collections and in warding off credit losses. It should be a cause of serious concern that the credit losses by broadcasters have been far, far higher than those of any other media and bad in comparison even with most other industries. Now, when advertisers are up against material shortages and the other difficult factors of a semimobilized economy, business failures can come most unexpectedly. There are several ways to guard your- self against credit losses on general ad- vertising. First, you can make sure that the ad- vertising agencies which you \"recognize\" are sound financially. This means that the agency should have financial integrity, collect promptly from its clients, pay media by their due dates and have enough capital on hand to meet emer- gencies. You can determine agency finan- cial capacity by reviewing the agency's balance sheet. There will soon be ma- chinery in broadcasting, we hope — as maintained among other major media — to collect such facts about agencies for the information of individual stations. Second, you can be prompt and meticu- lous in submitting your invoices and affi- davits of broadcast. Agencies tell us that many invoices from broadcasters are lave and some are inaccurate. Third, you can install the payment stim- ulus and credit safeguard that is in effect with majorities of other media — the cus- tomary 2 per cent cash discount. 43 SPADE COOLEY THE SPADE COOLEY SHOW\" — TV Decca Records • Santa Monica Ballroom • Motion Pictures • Standard Transcriptions 44 TELEVISION PROGRESS REPORT By BRIG. GENERAL DAVID SARNOFF, Chairman of the Board of RCA TELEVISION in 1951 revealed a number of significant advances that portend a great future. Television stations have proved their ability to operate suc- cessfully on the eco- nomic foundation of the American system of broadcasting. The television man- ufacturing industry has survived its early economic hills and valleys. The sales curve climbed at the beginning of the year, then dipped to a low level during the sum- mer. In the final months, a new up- swing in sales began. Sarnoff That fact, together with the sell-out of television time on the air, demonstrated the public confidence in the new art and guaranteed its permanence as a new industry. The truth about color television became evident in 1951. The public learned the basic meaning of compatibility — 'a funda- mental characteristic of the RCA color system — and that an all-electronic com- patible system will make it possible for owners of present television sets to re- ceive color programs, in black-and-white, without any change whatever, and with- out any contraptions. This all-electronic, compatible system with its tri-color picture tube, was pub- licly shown. It transmitted programs from studios and field-pickups over microwave radio relays and the coaxial cable, to other cities. Its superiority over an in- compatible system equipped with whirl- ing mechanical discs, which limit the size of the television picture, became self- evident. In addition, color pictures produced by the RCA compatible system, were suc- cessfully projected on a 9 x 12-foot screen in a Broadway theatre. Television programming in 1951 demon- strated that the new art has a keen appe- tite for talent and ideas. If all the feature motion pictures produced during a year in Hollywood were available to television, they would only cover about 600 hours, or six weeks out of a year's programs. TV, in a year, presents more new programs than all other media of public contact combined. Extension of religious programs and the use of television in education during 1951 revealed the marked effectiveness of such telecasts in vast new fields of service to church, school and home. Coast-to-coast TV network programs, made possible by cross-country micro- wave radio relays and coaxial cable ex- tensions, demonstrated that the day is not far distant when every corner of the country will have a reserved seat in the amphitheatre of television. When the TV station \"freeze\" is lifted many addi- tional communities will enjoy the bene- fits of television. Television's expansion in the UHF (ul- tra high frequency) portion of the broad- casting spectrum was proven in 1951 to be both possible and practical by RCA- NBC scientists and engineers, \"who two years earlier built an experimental UHF station near Bridgeport, Conn. This is the first UHF television station to operate on a regular schedule. Full-scale tests at Bridgeport climaxed more than 20 years of continuous research by RCA in UHF. Results from the incep- tion of the project were made available to the entire TV-engineering profession as a major contribution to television's fu- ture since UHF can accommodate 70 new TV channels, providing for perhaps more than 2,000 UHF stations. The development of the RCA Vidicon tube, or small electronic \"eye,\" has made possible portable television cameras and transmitters, even of back-pack size, per- mitting on-the-spot pickups of special events as well as the remote viewing of industrial processes and other operations. The Vidicon has also led to the develop- ment of a television microscope which extends the range and versatility of the light microscope to facilitate group study of living celLs at high magnification. Achievement of coast-to- coast service during the year gave eloquent promise that television would eventually become international in scope. While television has thus advanced, its older brother radio, too, has continued to move forward. Today there are 2,400 AM and 680 FM stations in the United States. Daily broadcasts cover 95 per cent of the country. 45 PICTURES - TELEVISION - RADIO - RECORDS AND JIMMY DURANTE MUSIC PUBLISHING CO. INC MANAGEMENT: WILLIAM MORRIS AGENCY NEW YORK —CHICAGO — HOLLYWOOD 46 PRODUCTION REPORT FOR '51 By JAMES D. SECREST, General Manager, Radio-Television Manufacturers Association Secrest THE radio-television industry, caught between the prolonged \"freeze\" on TV station construction and the economic and material curbs brought on by the rearma- ment program, had its ups and downs in 1951. However, by the end of the year it appeared to have attained some stabil- ity and faced the fu- ture with renewed optimism. Production of radio and TV sets boomed in the first quarter in anticipation of in- creased shortages of raw materials. Gov- ernment-imposed curbs on consumer buying, however, early in 1951 slowed down the scare buy- ing which followed the Korean outbreak. TV set inventories rose to dangerous levels among dealers, distributors, and manufacturers. With the spring came sharp cutbacks in set production, followed by a substantial reduction in employment and some plant shut-down. The industry, under RTMA leadership, sought relief via a modification of Regu- lation W. When the Federal Reserve Board refused to act, the plea was taken to Congress which in the summer com- pelled the Board to cut credit terms from 25 to 15 percent down payment and ex- tend installment periods from 15 to 18 months. The industry, through RTMA, also succeeded in persuading Congress not to increase excise taxes from 10 to 25 percent as recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury. In the early fall production rose again as retail inventories declined and public demand for consumer goods recovered. However, government allocation of critical raw materials had reduced the industry's potential so that TV set production re- mained well behind the record-breaking level of the last quarter of 1950. Final tabulations are expected to show industry output of about 5,250,000 TV sets compared with 7,400,000 in 1950 and more than 12,500,000 radios as against 14,600,000 in the previous year. About half the radios manufactured in 1951 were home sets, while auto receiver production accounted for more than one-third and portables for the remainder. The value of radio and TV sets pro- duced in 1951, at the manufacturer level, was approximately $1,250,000,000 as com- pared with $1,700,000,000 in 1950. How- ever, military production of electronic equipment rose from about $500,000,000 to more than $1,000,000,000 during the same periods. The year's set production brought total TV sets either sold or in distribution chan- nels to more than 16,600.000. Radios pro- duced since World War II totalled 92,000,000. As for 1952, the industry expects ma- terial shortages and other economic curbs to reduce further the output of radio and TV receivers. While all forecasts are necessarily \"guess-estimates,\" the con- sensus is that less than 5,000,000 TV sets and under 11,000,000 radios will be the limits on the year's production. The decisive role of electronic equip- ment in warfare was apparent in the large military appropriations made by Congress since the Korean outbreak. Officials esti- mated military orders for electronics- communications equipment as $3.8 billion during the first fiscal year after the Korean outbreak and at an equal amount for the 1951-52 fiscal year. Appropriations in this category during the first two years of rearmament consequently represented three-fourths of expenditures throughout World War II. However, due to the highly intricate nature of much of the equipment and the high ratio of engineering to labor in- volved, military orders were not evenly distributed within the industry. Procure- ment officials estimated that only 20 per- cent of the electronic and radar equip- ment required by the Armed Services was for mass-produced items comparable to those normally manufactured by radio- television producers. Defense officials estimate that the output of electronic equipment and components for the armed services will reach its peak in 1952 and level out at about $600 million a quarter. 47 FAYE EMERSON— SKITCH HENDERSON 48 RCA INCREASES PRODUCTION CAPACITY By FRANK M. FOLSOM, President, Radio Corporation oj America Folsom DURING 1951, the Radio Corporation of America as one of the radio-television industry's major producers continued a multi-million dollar plant expansion pro- gram to help meet the dual require- ments of military and domestic consumers. New manufacturing facilities, plus those established in earlier postwar years under the impetus of tele- vision, give RCA the greatest production potential of its 32- year history. Throughout 19 5 1, RCA accepted a rap- idly increasing num- ber of Government contracts for scientific research, engineer- ing development, and production of mili- tary equipment in the radio-electronics field. This volume of work, substantial in 1951, is expected to be three to four times greater in 1952, and will reach record levels during 1953. Next year's military output will probably equal in dollar vol- ume the 1942 rate, when RCA plants were devoted 100 per cent to war production. Military equipment produced by RCA in 1951 included various types of radio communication instruments, \"walkie-talk- ies,\" radar and sonar equipment, range- finding and navigational instruments, au- dio and radio devices for airplanes, and numerous types of electron tubes. Radio- electronic instruments currently required by the nation's military forces are far more complex than those used in World War II. For this reason a large and in- creasing number of RCA engineers is en- gaged in research and engineering devel- opment work on Government projects. One of RCA's outstanding engineering contributions is in the miniaturization of equipment. Major advance in both elec- tron tubes and circuit designs have made this possible, 'an excellent example being the Signal Corps' new \"walkie-talkie,\" which is half as big and twice as powerful as the one used in the last war. Similarly, it is now possible to get far more elec- tronic control equipment into airplanes than was heretofore possible. In addition to RCA's military develon- ment and production projects, more than 600 engineers and technicians of the RCA Service Company are working with the United States Armed Forces in twenty different countries. Their job is to service military radio-electronic equipment and assist in the training of military personnel in the equipment's operation. In the expanding field of Government electronics, RCA, during 1951, increased its tube design and manufacturing activi- ties significantly and geared its facilities for still greater operations in this field during the coming year. In .the domestic field, RCA, as well as other leading manufacturers in the in- dustry, maintained relatively high levels of production of television and radio sets and phonograph records. The American public purchased approx- imately 5,000,000 television receivers dur- ing 1951, bringing the total in use through- out the nation to more than 15,000,000. These sales, plus new installation and servicing, added more than $iy2 billion to the national income. A normal upward trend in sales de- veloped during September and, through- out the fourth quarter of 1951, most top- brand producers were manufacturing tele- vision sets up to the limit of the Govern- ment's material allocations. The New York market, largest in the country with more than 2,500,000 sets in use, was, for example, absorbing the RCA Victor tele- vision line as rapidly as shipments could be made. The glamour of television sometimes overshadows the fact that the radio and phonograph business are also in a very healthy condition. As a matter of fact, production of radio receivers and radio- phonograph combinations during the year was approximately 12,000,000 units — more than twice the figure for television sales. As a result, the number of radio sets in use throughout the United States at the year-end is more than 100.000,000, or an average of more than two sets per family. No other medium of communications reaches so many persons. Sales of recorded music rose sharply during 1951, setting a trend that is ex- pected to continue throughout the next year. 49 1902 MY FIFTIETH THEATRICAL YEAR 7952 •^ NIGHTCLUBS RADIO # ED WYNN C.A.B. ACTIVITIES IN 1951 By MALCOLM NEILL, Chairman, Board of Directors of CAB Neill THE Canadian Association of Broad- casters continued to grow in 1951. The Association now numbers among its mem- bers one hundred and five of the one hundred and thirty- five privately owned stations in Canada plus thirty- one asso- ciate members. Three major activi- ties have occupied the Association this year in addition to normal and routine matters. Preparation of a brief for the Parliamentary Com- mittee on Radio of the Federal Govern- ment and appear- ances before this Committee. The preparation of volumes of material for argument before the Copy- right Appeal Board which is conducting hearings as this report is being prepared and detailed work with the Federal Gov- ernment Civil Defense authorities. In our brief to the Parliamentary Com- mittee on Radio the main point of empha- sis was that Canadian broadcasting sta- tions should be free to operate under the law like other publishers. In addition to our 160,000 word brief, five appendices were presented to the federal committee. They included material (a) showing that the trend of public opinion in Canada is overwhelmingly in favor of placing all broadcasting under private management; (b) surveys of program preference show- ing a marked preference among Canadians for programs offered by private stations; (c) a history and background of radio broadcasting; (d) comment upon, and analysis of some of the recommendations contained in the report of the Massey Commission; and (e) a summary of the public service activities provided by com- munity broadcasting stations across Can- ada. The chief witnesses were T. J. Allard, C.A.B. 's General Manager, Joseph Sedg- wick, K.C. C.A.B.'s General Counsel, and Guy Roberge, C.A..B.'s Associate Counsel. The membership was outstanding in their support of the presentation to the Com- mittee. This support is best illustrated by the fact that 97 out of 104 stations who were then members sent telegrams to the committee backing up the Association brief. In the copyright field a serious situation has developed for broadcasters through a demand by CAPAC as ASCAP is known in Canada for greatly increased fees from broadcasters effective January 1, 1952. The C.AjB. is appealing CAPAC's demands and as stated earlier hearings are now proceeding before the Copyright Appeal Board in Ottawa. A considerable amount of progress has been made in establishing the role Cana- dian private stations will play in the mat- ter of Civil Defense. In the event of any emergency, no matter how caused, broad- casting will have a tremendously impor- tant part to play in providing information, maintaining civilian morale and giving instructions to the civilian defense popu- lace. During 1951 the Sales and Research Department broke new ground in the field of inter-media comparison and conducted extensive research to contrast Canadian time costs and circulations with those in the United States. An original study examined Canadian radio trends and circulations during the past ten years. This material was pre- sented to the ACA and CBC; the latter presentation opened discussions on the present unrealistic network station rates. These and other studies have formed the basis for special Canadian sections in the United States trade press. An \"ideal\" rate card was drafted for consideration by the industry. Extensive work was also carried on in the field of promotion. The practice of holding regional meet- ings— meetings of such groups as the Western Association of Broadcasters, the Central Canadian Broadcaster's Associa- tion, etc., was also continued and this years annual meeting, held at the Chateau Frontenac, Quebec City from February 26 to March 1st, 1951, was one of the most successful ever held. It was at the 1951 annual meeting that the Johnny J. Gillin, Jr. Memorial Award, an annual award to be presented to the Canadian station which has performed the most outstand- ing public service during the year, was presented for the first time. This award was set up in memory of the late Mr. John J. Gillin, Jr. of WOW, Omaha, Nebraska. 51 Exclusive Representative: Ted Ashley Associates Press Relations: Solters-O'Rourke Associates ALL EYES ARE ON TV By THAD H. BROWN, Jr., Director Television Operations NARTB Brown ALL eyes are on TV! Since 1946, neither the public nor the industry has had a chance to catch its breath. There's no doubt about it, the Cathode Ray tube is a goldfish bowl. As applied to any other industry, 1951 might have been con- sidered a peak year in development and activity. It was just normal for television broadcast: Coming of age, television war- ranted a place of its own in the NAB and that organization be- came the National Association of Radio and Television Broad- casters. Senator Ke- fauver's crime investigation via TV rocked the land. The FCC issued its famous \"Third Notice\" and the end of the freeze looked like more than a prediction. The President of the United States stepped on a platform in San Francisco and was seen 3,000 miles away. NARTB proposed, and the Commission agreed, that expedition was paramount and literally hundreds of cases were \"heard\" by \"written testimony\" in the Specific Allocations hearing. Senator Ben- ton personally decided that radio and television broadcast needed government program control and proposed the estab- lishment of a \"National Citizens' Advisory Board.\" \"Non-commercial\" colleges and universities limited television broadcast of their physical education programs in the interest of the \"gate.\" The nation's heart skipped a beat when a fellow named Bobby Thompson changed the complexion of a World Series right before its eyes. The 108th television station went on the air. As television reported the discourag- ing war scenes to the public, Red Skelton helped to take their minds off of it. Gen- eral MacArthur made his Congressional and television debut. Initial experimen- tation in specific educational program- ming was continued. As the sands of 1951 were running out, television receivers in the United States hit the 15- million mark. 476 applicants were beating on the doors of the FCC with an estimated 500 more all ready to make their moves when the freeze ended. Television network gross time sales approached the 125-million mark. The Television Code of the National As- sociation of Radio and Television Broad- casters was promulgated, and the Seal of Good Practice adopted — to go into effect March 1, 1952. In this regard, for Men of the Year, the diary of 1951 in television should record the Television Program Standards Committee: Bob Swezey, Chair- man, Harry Bannister, James L. Caddigan, Walter Damm, James C. Hanrahan, Harold Hough, Clair McCollough, Paul Raibourn, Leonard Reinsch, Henry Slavick, David- son Taylor and Donald Thornburgh. 1952? It already presents a congested calendar — and above all, it's a Presidential election year. A lot of people got into the TV act in 1951. Most of them were still in the act as the year 1952 was entered, and early in January it appeared that they would have plenty of company. The can- didates and politicians haven't really started yet, but soon will be donning grease-paint for the greatest show of all. Whatever happens during this year, one thing is sure— NARTB will watch it closely. In many cases, will do a lot more than \"watch.\" Real money will be dedicated toward TV construction, installation ad operation in 1952. NARTB-TV's \"Television Con- struction Costs — December, 1951,\" will have to be hurriedly up-dated in accord- ance with shifting economic requirements, but it presently estimates minimum costs for construction of a VHF station in cities with a population between 50,000 and 250,- 000 to be approximately $274,000; UHF construction costs for comparable popu- lation, $281,250. Add to this, NARTB's minimum operating expense estimate of 4>168,530 and one sees the smallest opera- tion spending close to one-half a million dollars the first year. At the Commission—after the freeze is lifted there will literally be a frenzy of hearings — straining that bureau's capaci- ties to the utmost. 1952 in Television will be another ban- ner year. The miracle of sound plus sight will grow and become even more miracu- lous, especially as its effect is reflected in the voting process. 53 Best Wishes Kate Smith 54 THIS IS U. N. RADIO Bxj DOROTHY LEWIS, U. S. Stations Relations. United Nations Mrs. Lewis IN times of crisis people everywhere seek the facts upon which to form a balanced judgment. 1951 was such a time and United Nations Radio presented the facts in 30 languages to hundreds of mil- lions throughout the world. Its news pro- grams in all lan- guages were strength- ened in response to increasing demands ever since the out- break of hostilities in Korea. Thus, objec- tive presentation of international news on AM and TV and such worldwide symposia as \"The Price of Peace\" were major contributions of United Nations Radio to- ward clarifying public thinking on the great issues of today. Newscasts and feature programs are pre- pared by the several services: English Language Service; European and Middle Eastern Service; Latin American Service and the Trans-Pacific Service. This regu- lar operation at the United Nations head- quarters, with its staff of international civil servants drawn from many systems of broadcasting of member states has been greatly increased during 1951 with the scheduling of the Sixth General Assembly in Paris. Circuits from Paris and from U.N. Correspondents in Korea, as well as material from the many U.N. Information Centers around the world bring daily recorded news, interviews and proceedings for inclusion on all U.N. programs broad- cast daily in some 30 languages. U. S. COVERAGE In the U.S.A., emphasis during 1951 was laid on several projects and developments: 1. Worldwide distribution of \"The Price Of Peace\" series of talks by world states- men, climaxed by the cease-fire proposals by Yakov A. Malik in June. This series was relayed to all English-speaking coun- tries and by a news release of the text to all other member states simultaneously each week. CBS aired the talks in thp U. S. A. 2. Inauguration of the \"Citizens of the World\" (dramatic episodes in the lives of U.N. men and women) in the U.N. STORY series heard on 500 U. S. stations and in other English-speaking countries, and which was awarded the 1951 Ohio State and School Broadcast awards. 3. The television services have been ex- panded materially. Since November 6, 1951, there has been full coverage by tele- vision of the Sixth U.N. General Assem- bly in Paris over TV in cooperation with the U.N. Department of Public Informa- tion. The half-hour program, \"The U.N. In Action\" (Mondays through Fridays — CBS Network) presents debates, inter- views, special features and ceremonies, and on Sundays, a half-hour summary is telecast, \"The U.N. This Week.\" Daily TV coverage of the U.N. meetings taking place in Paris is produced and directed by the U.N. staff, and viewed the follow- ing day in the United States by means of Paramount kinescope. This TV coverage of U.N. activities is also released by RDF in France and over the BBC by means of kinescopes flown nightly to London. The weekly half-hour program over the American Broadcasting Company, \"United Or Not,\" with John MacVane as moderator, presents members of the U.N. Correspondents' Association interviewing a different delegate each week. Other U.N. television in 1951 in- cluded special Security Council meetings, and the weekly half-hour program for children, \"The U.N. Stamp Club,\" which was seen over WNBT for 45 weeks in 1950-1951 using philately as a vehicle to disseminate U.N. information. 4. A nationwide project, \"U.N. Com- munications Campaign,\" was launched in the United States to increase the number of listeners to U.N. shows by 20,000,000. It is sponsored by U.N. Radio and 35 ma- jor national organizations. A chairman in each of the 250 selected cities was ap- pointed and 8,000 persons designated by these national groups to serve locally. 5. Another preoccupation of U.N. Radio for 1951 had to do with the move from Lake Success to the permanent headquar- ters in New York. Each of the Council and conference rooms at Headquarters is provided with a number of booths de- signed specifically for radio and TV broad- casting. 55 RALPH EDWARDS Ha/ing wonderful -funnowonTV Meetmefoday!

This new high figure represents an increase of 9,300,000 radio sets, some 9.7 per cent over the 96,000,000 estimate of a year ago and reveals radio to be in a healthy and growing period, despite the tremendous growth of television in the year's time. According to the estimates of the com- mittee, 900,000 new radio households were added in a year's time. Secondary and portable sets, added during the year to already existing radio homes came to 4,000,000 while 4,400,000 additional radio- equipped automobiles, completed the in- crease of 9,300,000 sets. For the first time this year, a new cate- gory— sets in institutions, dormitories and barracks was instituted. This, plus the out-of-home sets, cars and portables, have always been overlooked in totalling up the number of national sets, but, never- theless, account for an imposing total. In a breakdown of the figures the Joint Committee finds that 42,800,000 homes in the country have at least one radio. Sec- ondary and portable sets in households, in all radio homes, add up to 34,000,000. Auto- mobiles on the roads today have an esti- mated 23,500,000 radios and there are 5,000,000 sets in other places. showed higher radios, but since they seemed inadequate for projections, they were dismissed and the national figure was taken. It may be recalled, at this point, that the BMB study, 1948, gave the per- centage figure of homes with radios at 94.2 per cent. Sectionally, however, New England as an example in that study had a figure of 98.2 per cent in the nation, closely followed by the Pacific area with a saturation figure of 98.0 per cent. Most significant of the findings, in the opinion of the committee, is the 4,000,000 increase in the new estimate of secondary and portable sets in radio homes. This, the committee noted provides for greater radio listening opportunity in homes. The committee bases this opinion on the nu- merous available studies which have been made and which unanimously agree that listening to secondary sets in homes con- stitutes an important part of total listening time. The estimate of automobiles equipped with radios, 23,500,000, is predicted on surveys which show that nearly 64 per cent of the nation's 37,000,000 passenger cars are so equipped. This figure could receive an even higher percentage, the committee feels, since new cars to be sold this year will have a higher per- centage of radios. With 1950 Census data available for the first time, the committee was able to estimate the number of sets in college dormitories, institutions and barracks of the Armed Forces. The figure of 900,000 Radio Households Secondary & Portable Sets in Homes Radio-Equipped Cars Sets in Institutions, Dormitories and Barracks Sets in Other Places Number of Radio 7952 42,800,000 34,000,000 23,500,000 900,000 4,100,000 Sets as of Jan. 1 7957 41,900,000 30,000,000 19,100,000 5,000,066 TOTAL SETS 105,300,000 96,000,000 Referring to the Housing Census of 1950, which showed a saturation of 95.6 per cent, for radio, in U. S. homes, the Joint Com- mittee arrived at the total of 42.800,000 radio households. This ratio was then applied to Sales Management's preliminary estimate of 44,737,900, as of January 1, 1952, in order to qualify the figure. While the 95.6 per cent saturation was taken for the country as a whole, local surveys, in many sections of the country sets in these places, the committee notes, represents a definite bonus to advertisers who use radio. Breakdown of the other 4,100,000 sets finds them in other places which includes business establishments, offices, restaur- ants and other public places. Finally, the committee in releasing their 1952 esti- mates emphasized that the figures which they have come up with in each category are conservative. 61 'Be Good To Yourself\" is the wish of TOASTMASTER of The SWIFT PH I LCO JELL-0 don McNeill Breakfast Club 19th Year MONDAY through FRIDAY ABC — 8 to 9 A.M., C.S.T. 62 Top Ten News Selections of Networks for 1951 The network selections of top ten news events for 1951 follow: — NBC — Firing and return of MacArthur.

Industrialization of the whole Island is the principal aim of Governor Luis Munoz Marin's Administration. Our | \"\":l^L'~ civilization had its foundation in ancient Europe, with a com- bination of modern American ways of living. Continentals who have visited Puerto Rico on dif- ferent times express their surprise at the great development of progress attained during the last years. Housing facilities; hotel accommoda- tions; means of com- munication; the great decrease in illiteracy; health conditions and the willingness of the Puerto Ricans to fulfill their duty in order to make of Puerto Rico the Island of Enchantment, had resulted in this great progress. Radio industry is not an exception. We, the men in the radio industry in Puerto Rico, feel proud in claiming that we are following — step by step — the great revolutionary movement in \"the United States in order to offer the listening audience the best programs available. Whoever has followed the great development in our radio dur- ing the last twenty-five years has to admit that our industry has done its part for the realization of the progress in Puerto Rico. We can say in all truth that radio is part of our daily life. In our ever green mountains, lives the hillbilly. We know him as \"jibaro.\" That \"jibaro\" spends his time from sunrise to sunset plowing the earth; planting the seed; harvesting the crop. After a day's work that \"jibaro\" can stand the luxury of listening to his favor- ite radio program. Wherever the electri- fication project has not as yet reached the rural zone, this hillbilly of ours, can always secure a battery for his radio. The latest news flashes; the struggle of the baseball teams in the American and National Leagues in order to secure the pennant; the great deeds of our brave soldiers in Korea; the advices of doctors in their health program; the lectures about agriculture and cattle raising and even the lectures about beauty care are of the complete domain of that \"jibaro\" living in the mountains, miles away from the city. We of the radio industry have given our time and talent in order to help those who are willing to do everything possible in order to cooperate with our government in its effort to secure finan- cial stability for the people of Puerto Rico. True, that television is still a dream for our industry. Nevertheless we are in the alert to offer our people the facilities of television as soon as this project will prove to be a success in our Island. Engi- neers from the United States have made complete studies and have rendered their official reports. We of the radio industry are ready to act as soon as the time comes to start this new era. Many years ago, in case of a tropical hurricane, warnings had to be carried to the rural zone by messengers or through the use of flag warnings. Today all the inhabitants of Puerto Rico are well in- formed of the progress of any hurricane through the twenty-five radio stations in the different cities. Well known interpreters of music have written the name of Puerto Rico in golden letters. Sanroma, Graciela Rivera, the Figueroa brothers, Rafael Hernandez, Boby Capo, Mapy Cortez — to mention only a few — have received the applause of multitudes through all the world. Puerto Rico with its 2,200,000 popula- tion squeezed in an area of 3,600 sq. mi. is at the present time United States' first cus- tomer per capita. Businessmen throughout continental U. S. realize the importance of our market and they have esstablished central offices in our capital city — San Juan — in order to take care of the thou- sands of customers patronizing th"
