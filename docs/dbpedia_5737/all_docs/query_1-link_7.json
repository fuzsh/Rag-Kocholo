        "text": "This week's \"Buffalo being Buffalo\" kerfuffle is \"PermitGate,\" with many of the city's notable music and entertainment venues getting hit with letters \"reminding\" them to pay a per-show fee to offer cultural fare to the masses. The reaction to these letters was reported by Investigative Post, which also commented on the antiquated section of the Buffalo City Code that enabled the charges.\n\nAnyone seeking to throw shade on this law can simply point to some of its outdated and wince-inducing language (\"Kinetoscopes,\" \"Freaks of Nature,\" \"Minstrel Entertainments\"—language so outdated, it was grossly quaint when Mr. Burns used it in the 90's on The Simpsons).\n\nIn addition to pointing out that the law is antiquated, anyone seeking to fight this law might be able to argue that it violates Article I, Section 8 of the New York State Constitution (a.k.a \"New York's version of the First Amendment\").\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe law at issue, Buffalo City Code Chapter 75, divides types of entertainment into \"classes\"—sixteen of them, to be precise—and those classes (such as they are) determine what has to get a permit for what and when.\n\nFor example, as provided by Chapter 75, a person can send their 10-year-old child to go to a \"circus or menagerie\" (fourth class) unaccompanied, but cannot allow them to go to the opera (first class) without a parent or guardian. That's right, Buffalo: our City Code is so old, it deems the circus a safe place for unaccompanied minors but protects them from the seamier elements of the opera.[1]\n\nThese classes also arbitrarily impose vague divisions and conditions on various types of art and culture. For instance, per Section 75 of the Code, \"Entertainments of the first, second and third class shall be given only in a duly licensed place.\" So, opera, art exhibits, lectures, and \"musical entertainments\" can only happen in Buffalo at a place with a license.\n\nMeanwhile, per Section 75-5, none of the 16 classes of entertainment (except classes 4 and 5—primarily circuses and concerts under tents) can happen \"at any place in the City other than within a duly licensed theater, opera house, hall or other enclosure or place without a license issued for that purpose,\"[2] except that \"no license fee shall be charged for amateur athletic games.\"\n\nIf you're still hanging in there, here's a final wild combo: per Article 75-7, no license for classes 1, 4, or 5 (opera, circus, sideshow) can be issued unless the \"Commissioner of Inspection and Licenses\" has certified to the Commissioner of Permit & Inspection Services that the space complies with all building ordinance requirements. But if you're at a lecture, demonstrating a \"galvanic battery\" (class 8), or attending an art show, well... you're rolling the structural dice.\n\nThese classes of entertainment and the odd array of requirements that might or might not apply to them may be the reason why some Buffalo entertainment venues got letters, and some didn't.\n\nAll of which brings us back to New York’s Constitution, Article I, Section 8.\n\nUnder both our state and federal constitutions, local governments are absolutely allowed to impose restrictions on communications and commercial activity that constitutes speech,[3] so long as the restrictions meet the precise formulas to not unduly infringe on civil liberties.\n\nThere are countless tomes written about these \"precise formulas\" but essentially they require that when the government imposes a restriction (such as a permit) on speech, there must be a good reason to do so. In addition, the restrictions—if justified by a good reason—must be clear and not be so vague as to impose a \"chilling effect\" on protected activities.\n\nAs the law stands right now, anyone offering opera should feel really nervous about whether or not 15-year-olds can attend unaccompanied. Anyone offering a lecture or art exhibition might want to consider rebranding to offer \"amateur athletic games\" to avoid licensing fees. And whether we're pros or hobbyists, we should all hide our mutoscopes (class 6).\n\nI am of course citing the more ridiculous examples, but the point is, when it can impact art—even commercial presentation of art—laws must be clear, must not risk \"over-breadth,\" and must be applied in a way that is fair.\n\nIronically, Buffalo has a solid model for this in chapter 496 of the Code, which covers how Buffalo puts different uses and activities in different \"zones\" (and which has the advantage of having been adopted more recently, in 2017).\n\nHere is how Chapter 496 defines an \"Adult Bookstore\":\n\na. Adult Bookstore. A business having five percent or more of its floor area devoted to sale or rent of, or five percent or more of its stock-in-trade in, publications, books, magazines, periodicals, photographs, films, motion pictures, video cassettes or video reproductions, or other visual representations that depict or describe specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas, or instruments, devices, or paraphernalia that are designed for use in connection with specified sexual activities.\n\nLook at that crisp, clear language! No confusion here.\n\nTo compare, if this section on \"Adult Bookstore\" was part of Article 75, it would probably say:\n\nNo Bookseller shall offer to the general public lascivious materials except that for healthy adult male consumption. Such lascivious materials shall be divided into 3 classes: Smut (from which shall be excluded all materials related to study of classical Greek, as well as Latin studied for religious purposes), Materials damaging to the Ladies, and Scandalous Literature. Sales of Smut and Scandalous Literature are limited to the third block of Main Street on Tuesday, and the Health Inspector shall confirm the Good Moral Character of all Booksellers before the sale of Damaging Materials.\n\nWhat is my point here? This law might not just be infuriatingly outdated, but unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.\n\nNow, I have to say: a genuine First Amendment/Article 8 analysis has to not only deeply parse the law but precisely analyze how it is being applied. In the case of PermitGate, that would require looking at the letters that were sent and other specifics.\n\nBut having spent an hour or two poking around the law, I think anyone who is facing costly business consequences because of it would be wise to conduct a further analysis. It may be that this law needs to put on its top hat, get on its velocipede, and become a cringe-worthy footnote in Buffalo's history.\n\nStephanie (\"Cole\") Adams is an attorney in Buffalo. She represents libraries across the State of New York and handles First Amendment issues as part of her practice.\n\n[1] I concede it's possible the Code is actually protecting the opera from the ravages of unaccompanied minors--but that too is culturally out of step.\n\n[2] If the above quote is confusing, it's not because I am a bad writer or because I misquoted the Code. Read the quoted language again and tell me if it's clear or not. Commas matter!\n\n[3] Music, dancing, visual art, poetry, etc. can all be \"speech\" in the First Amendment realm.\n\nIn 2021, a marketing agency called The Martin Group and a commission empaneled by the Mayor of Buffalo produced a report known as the Buffalo Reform Agenda, pursuant to an executive order by Governor Andrew Cuomo requiring all local governments to adopt a plan to reform their police forces.\n\nThe reform agenda was the culmination of the City of Buffalo’s response to the racial justice protests of 2020 that broke out in Buffalo and across the world in response to a Minneapolis police officer’s murder of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd. The Buffalo Common Council approved the reform agenda by a 6-to-3 vote on a resolution that set forth nineteen commitments for police reform.\n\nThree years later, few of these objectives have been accomplished, and the city hasn’t publicly reported its progress or expanded the reform agenda, both of which the resolution promised.\n\nThe resolution’s most detailed objectives included a “community planning process” pledged to be undertaken by the Commission on Citizen Rights and Community Relations, a commitment to “implementing Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion,” a promise of improved “Data Transparency,” and revisions to the police department’s use-of-force policy. Three years later, none of these key reforms have materialized.\n\nCommunity planning process\n\nThe 2021 reform agenda resolved that the Commission on Citizen Rights and Community Relations (CCRCR) would issue bi-annual reports, publish a survey, and produce findings and recommendations about community-police relations and the CCRCR’s membership, structure, and powers. As this blog reported last year, the CCRCR has not met or produced any material since 2020, although its staff continue to be paid full-time salaries.\n\n“At the beginning of the pandemic, an administrative hold was placed on all commission’s activities including the CCRCR,” said its executive director, Jason Whitaker. In response to subsequent Freedom of Information request, Whitaker and a city attorney stated that there are no records related to the “administrative hold” and that no officer or employee of the CCRCR maintains a work calendar.\n\nThe CCRCR’s work program statistics in the mayor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2025 say that, in fiscal year 2024, the CCRCR had 93 customer visits, serviced 93 non-police complaints, opened 30 cases, and closed 30 cases, but these and the CCRCR’s other work program statistics are identical to those in last year’s budget.\n\nLaw enforcement assisted diversion\n\nThe reform agenda states that the “City of Buffalo is committed to implementing Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) as a pilot program in B District.” According to a May 2023 story in The Buffalo News, the city never did so, nor has it launched the full program, which promised alternatives to arrest for petty crimes related to drug use, sex work, poverty, and mental illness.\n\n“We have moved it as far as a coalition of community groups and health agencies can,” said Andrea Ó Súilleabháin, executive director of the nonprofit organization that developed the planned program in partnership with the city, Buffalo police, and district attorney. “The only thing we’re missing is action from City Hall or the Police Department to do the work of getting a pilot up and running,” Ó Súilleabháin told the newspaper.\n\nData transparency\n\nThe reform agenda made the ambitious claim that “the Buffalo Police Department is well-situated to become one of the most data-driven and transparent police departments in the nation” through its partnership with the data analytics company SAS Institute. Far from it, the results of Buffalo’s $2.2 million dollar contract with SAS remain a mystery. The city denied a Freedom of Information request for its SAS dashboards, and there’s no trace of the “publicly accessible reports on the metrics regarding the implementation of the reform initiatives,” which the reform agenda promised. Although the reform agenda states that “the City of Buffalo is committed to joining the Police Data Initiative (PDI)” to promote public access to the SAS data, Buffalo does not appear on PDI’s list of participating agencies.\n\n“The primary focus of the SAS contract was the Department of Permits and Inspections,” said the city's former Open Data and Analytics Project Coordinator, Matthew Austin. “Towards the end of the consultants’ hours, SAS developed a use-of-force dashboard for the police department that to my knowledge was never used. It was almost a carbon copy of the publicly available dashboard SAS developed for the Ventura County Sheriff in California,” Austin said. That dashboard is available on the Ventura County Sheriff Office’s website and breaks down use of force by year, location, and category. It further breaks down police shootings by suspect race and sex, officer race and sex, and the number of officers firing, among other details.\n\nThe Data Transparency section of the reform agenda concludes that the “Buffalo Police Department will also issue a Departmental Report to the Community and an Internal Affairs Report to the Community, annually.” Last year, the department issued its first annual report since 2005, though it has not updated its published Internal Affairs statistics since 2021.\n\nUse-of-force policy\n\nIn its seventeenth and wordiest objective, the reform agenda recommended three changes to the police department’s use-of-force policy based on “comments received by the City of Buffalo from the New York State Office of the Attorney General.” On the proposed change of the policy’s recognition of “the value of human life and dignity” to “an active duty to preserve that life,” the agenda states that the “City is committing to make this change in its Use of Force Policy and then training each officer in its meaning and practice.” Second, the agenda states that the policy “must be updated” to make de-escalation “an active duty” rather than something that officers merely “should” do. Third, the agenda states that the policy “must also be amended to include clear definitions of ‘necessity’ and ‘proportionality’” and stresses that this change is necessary “for the protection of the officers and the community.”\n\nThe use-of-force policy on the police department’s website, posted as a PDF last modified March 25, 2024, contains none of these changes. The version of the policy in the department’s Manual of Procedures does not either.\n\nIn summation\n\nMost of the nineteen commitments in the Buffalo Police Reform Agenda—and all of the most detailed—appear to have been abandoned or forgotten. The status of several of the minor reforms are unclear, though in cases such as such as the pledge to “expand the Police And Community Together (PACT), Citizen’s Police Academy,” a definite lack of commitment is evident. the PACT webpage appears not to have been updated since 2020.\n\nA contemporary evaluation of the last item on the reform agenda gives a small but unambiguous measure of the agenda’s success. Of the four bills that the “City will work with the local State Delegation to pass,” three of the four never became law. The one that did, the HALT Solitary Confinement Act, had already been passed by the state legislature two weeks before the reform agenda was completed.\n\nThe Law Office of Stephanie Adams takes compliance with New York State’s Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) very seriously. Our client base include numerous entities that maintain compliance with FOIL, and we send FOIL requests to various state and local agencies to serve the interests of our clients.\n\nOver the last couple years, we have observed inconsistent and, in some cases, declining compliance with the provisions of FOIL by divisions of our hometown government, the City of Buffalo. We want to encourage improvement by the weakest performers and commend the most compliant, so today we are publishing letter grades for several municipal agencies, accompanied by a percentage determined by a 5-item weighted total:\n\n15 points for listing a FOIL officer’s contact information online\n\n15 points if listed on the city’s FOIL submission web portal and a request can be submitted without getting an error message\n\n20 points for responding within the required 5 days of receipt, in a FOIL-compliant manner (partial points awarded for each request)\n\n20 points if the agency makes its determination within its given timeframe (partial points awarded for each request)\n\n30 points for disclosing records sought or if a denial is affirmed on appeal (partial points awarded for each request)\n\nThis scale allows for a maximum score of 100% (A+), which no city agency has yet achieved. Unlike many county agencies, none of the below-listed city agencies listed a FOIL officer online, so the highest assigned score is 85% (B), while the lowest score is 10% (F).\n\nDepartment of Administration, Finance, Policy, & Urban Affairs — 40% (F)\n\nThis agency didn’t respond to a FOIL request submitted through the web portal. It didn’t respond in a compliant way to one request sent by e-mail and didn’t respond at all to another. In one case, this agency e-mailed records in a timely fashion.\n\nDepartment of Audit & Control — 72% (C−)\n\nThis agency didn’t respond to a FOIL request submitted through the web portal, but it has since claimed to have added its staff to the web portal system. When requests were sent by e-mail, the agency didn’t issue a compliant response within 5 days of receipt in two of three cases and didn’t make a timely determination in one case, but it disclosed at least some records in all three cases.\n\nBoard of Ethics — 75% (C)\n\nThe city clerk’s office acknowledged in a compliant manner all requests submitted to the Board of Ethics through the web portal and usually made timely determinations. In one case, the city’s law department reversed a denial by the clerk’s office on appeal.\n\nBuffalo Police Department — 65% (D)\n\nThis agency is usually compliant in acknowledging FOIL requests submitted online and makes timely determinations, but it improperly denied records in most cases. One such denial was reversed by a state judge.\n\nDepartment of Citizen Services — 70% (C−)\n\nDespite this agency controlling Buffalo’s 311 system, which is integrated with its FOIL portal, submitting a request to this agency on the web portal produced an error message. When a request was sent by e-mail, this agency responded in a compliant way, made a timely determination, and produced the requested records.\n\nCity Clerk’s Office — 85% (B)\n\nThis agency gets full Marks, except it doesn’t list a FOIL officer on its webpage.\n\nCivil Service Division, Department of Human Resources — 15% (F)\n\nThis agency is listed on the FOIL portal, but it never responded to a FOIL request submitted there.\n\nCommission on Citizens Rights and Community Relations — 50% (F)\n\nThis agency isn’t listed on the FOIL portal. It didn’t acknowledge in a compliant way two e-mailed requests, but it issued timely determinations for both. This agency pointed to limited information online to satisfy one request, and responded to the other that the agency did not possess the requested records, including any employee’s work calendar.\n\nDepartment of Law — 30% (F)\n\nThis agency responded to a request from the web portal but did not respond to a request by e-mail. It did not give timely notices of receipt or timely determinations. In one case, it eventually provided the requested records.\n\nMayor’s Office — 10% (F)\n\nThis agency isn’t listed on the FOIL portal. Two requests sent by e-mail were never acknowledged, while another wasn’t acknowledged or decided in a timely fashion. A city attorney eventually provided the requested records in that case.\n\nDepartment of Parking — 75% (C)\n\nThis agency responded in a compliant way to requests submitted online, made timely determinations, and in two of three cases, provided the records sought.\n\nDepartment of Public Works — 40% (F)\n\nThis agency is listed on the FOIL portal, but submitting requests yielded error messages. It responded to a request by e-mail in a compliant way and made a timely determination but did not provide public records which the city code provides that it maintains.\n\nOne passage in an October 15, 2023 story in The Buffalo News, City of Buffalo rejects News' request for public records about potential lawsuits, took me by surprise. Out of 378 lawsuits brought or pending against the City of Buffalo between January and August of 2023, the newspaper singled out just one case for which it named a litigant—me.\n\nThe 378 notices of claim filed against the city since Jan. 1 that are listed in the spreadsheet include allegations of sewer backups, vehicle damages, drinking water issues, a wrongful conviction, a property that was improperly demolished and more than three dozen property damage claims, many of them due to trees falling in the 2022 Christmas weekend blizzard.\n\nAlso among the claims – a case involving the city’s denial of a FOIL request for records by a private citizen. The citizen, Nathan Feist, ultimately prevailed by taking his case to state Supreme Court, where Judge Emilio Colaiacovo in July ordered the city to disclose the records to Feist within five days.\n\nTechnically, the five-day order wasn’t handed down until September. Justice Colaiacovo ruled from the bench in July that the City of Buffalo must disclose the records I sought, and the city prevaricated concerning the court’s expectation that the city submit a draft order for the judge to sign. Seven weeks later, I submitted the draft order myself, which the court issued on September 22, after a week of attempting in vain to learn if the city had any objection. A city attorney sent me copies of twenty-five e-mails six days later.\n\nThe process began over one year prior, when I submitted a request under New York State’s Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) for records related to a trip to Walt Disney World which WIVB News 4 Buffalo reported the Buffalo Police Department was awarding to a Buffalo family because this family is “an example of a great family.” This reporting brought to mind several questions: What makes a family great? How does the police department determine a family’s greatness? How did this family stand out among other great families to the degree that the police department decided to send this family on all-expenses-paid trip to Disney World?\n\nTo my disappointment, the city’s response to my FOIL request answered none of these questions. Instead, it claimed that its records search “revealed only inter-agency materials and agreements that are exempt from disclosure.” However, I did not request any inter-agency materials, and basic materials that I did request, including financial records and correspondence between the police department and the family that the department selected, do not categorically fall under any exemption to disclosure.\n\nSo, I wrote to the agency that issues advisory opinions on FOIL, the New York State Committee on Open Government. The committee advised that I ask the police department for a certification allowed by FOIL to establish which records, if any, weren’t revealed by the records search, leaving the remaining records as those the department claimed to be “inter-agency materials and agreements.”\n\nAfter my request for this certification went unanswered for two weeks, I called the police department’s FOIL division. The officer who answered my call said nothing more would be provided, and when I explained that FOIL requires agencies to certify if records are not found, the officer hung up. So, I appealed the department’s determination to the city’s law department.\n\nIn the city’s response denying my appeal, the police department’s Disney World trip awarded for being a great family transformed into what the city now referred to as “a raffle of a trip” that was “voluntarily organized and privately funded.” Nevertheless, the factual materials which the police department admitted to possessing are public records, so I took the matter to court.\n\nIn response to my lawsuit, the city continued to insist that the trip was a raffle, testifying that the department “was aware of some internal emails spreading the word about a raffle trip to Walt Disney World.” After I pointed out that such e-mails are not subject to the only statutory exemption to disclosure cited by the city, Justice Colaiacovo asked the city to send him the records so he could inspect them himself—a so-called in camera review. Three and a half months later, the city sent him a collection of e-mails that an IT contractor determined were related to the Disney World trip and which the judge then ruled should be made public once the city redacts personal information, such as the names of the great family’s children.\n\nThe e-mails that the city eventually provided do not contain such redactions and reveal that the trip was not a raffle, contrary to what city attorneys stated in sworn testimony. Rather, a Buffalo Police chief e-mailed his mother (a substitute teacher at the Charter School of Inquiry) at her work address and asked for help selecting a family, which her school did less than an hour and half later.\n\n“I talked to Mr. Rembert who said it would amazing to be selected for the Disney trip,” wrote Associate Principal Joseph Peek, 59 minutes after receiving the police chief’s forwarded e-mail.\n\nFour months later, the police chief told an inquiring Mr. Rembert that the deputy commissioner of police was still waiting for approval from the city’s law department. “I apologize for the wait time but unfortunately we have to wait for clearance on their end,” wrote the police chief.\n\nThe records disclosed in response to the court order do not include any materials submitted for approval. Shortly after I received the e-mail trove, I asked the city attorney assigned to the case if there are any records of the law department issuing the approval. “There are not,” he replied.\n\nAccording to the last e-mail from the police department, the trip was paid for “using the funds raised by the Buffalo Police officers football pool.” Offline sports betting in New York State is only legal at four casinos operated by Indian nations, and knowingly collecting over $500 dollars a day in proceeds from a gambling ring is a felony pursuant to New York State Penal Code Section 225.10, punishable by up to four years in prison and five years’ probation.\n\nEarlier this year, a handful of New York State Assembly members introduced bills to amend the state constitution and pass a law to legalize football pools for restaurants and bars, which the assembly may vote on next year.\n\nOn Wednesday, October 25, 2023, I attended the first meeting of the City of Buffalo’s Board of Ethics since July 2023. These meetings are not widely announced; Stephanie Adams and I are the only members of the public who attend them. At this meeting, the ethics board took the remarkable step of unanimously moving to issue subpoenas to fourteen current and former city employees and members of other boards who have failed to submit annual financial disclosures as required by the city’s code of ethics. The ethics board said that the subpoenas will call the fourteen people to testify at the next ethics board meeting, on November 29, where the ethics board will ask them why they haven’t filed the required disclosures. If the board finds a city officer or employee in violation of the code of ethics, it can impose a fine of up to $10,000 dollars for each violation.\n\nAccording to meeting materials obtained via a Freedom of Information Law request, one of the fourteen in delinquency is former Preservation Board member Terrence Gilbride, currently an attorney at Hodgson Russ LLP, who hasn’t filed disclosures for 2019, 2020, or 2021. Another attorney in delinquency is Environmental Management Commission member Charles Grieco, who hasn’t filed disclosures since 2020, although it’s unclear if the environmental commission has met in recent years. Two current Preservation Board members, four Buffalo Sewer employees, and two Planning Board members are among those who have not filed their 2023 disclosures, which were due in January.\n\nHow did we get here? In September 2021, Stephanie Adams, on behalf of herself and about 140 other residents of Buffalo, submitted to the Board of Ethics a letter of complaint concerning a political advertisement for Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown’s 2021 reelection campaign, which appeared on local television and on Facebook. The campaign ad featured nearly twenty people whom the ad identified as Buffalo police officers and falsely claimed that proposed budget cuts by the Democratic nominee, India Walton, required police officers to lose their jobs. The complaint did not concern the content of the ad’s messaging but rather the participation of police officers who invoked their official roles for a political purpose, which is prohibited by state and federal law, as well as the Buffalo Police Department’s policies, and could be a violation of the city’s code of ethics.\n\nHaving heard nothing about the status of the complaint nearly one year later, I requested the ethics board’s 2021 and 2022 meeting materials from the city clerk, who replied that the board had not been meeting since 2020. I mentioned this to an Investigative Post journalist, who then reported in August 2022 that the Board of Ethics had not met since February 2020 and that all five of its appointed seats were vacant. Three weeks later, the mayor appointed five new members to the board, four of them having donated to his electoral campaigns.\n\nSince then, Stephanie Adams and I have closely followed the proceedings of the ethics board, which has been investigating and discussing the complaint in private since December 2022, in addition to scrutinizing delinquencies in the filing of financial disclosures. At the end of the October 25 meeting, the board chair reported that the board believes that it will come to a decision on the complaint at its November 29 meeting, which will is scheduled at 1 P.M. in Buffalo City Hall Room 1417.\n\nAlong with approving a $600 million dollar project to redevelop two of Buffalo’s municipal housing complexes on July 31, 2023, the Buffalo Planning Board approved plans for the completion of Elmwood Crossing: a massive and privately-led, mixed-use redevelopment project at the site of Buffalo’s former Women and Children’s Hospital in the Elmwood Village neighborhood.\n\nOne resident who spoke at the planning board meeting, Daniel Sack, asked the board to adjourn the meeting since its agenda packet had grown from 841 to 879 pages the Friday before the meeting and grew to 909 pages on the Monday that the meeting was held, depriving board members and the public of a reasonable amount of time to review the material. Sack noted that three of the pages added Friday comprised a Planned Unit Development—or “PUD” (rhymes with “bud”)—for Elmwood Crossing, which had never before been published in the time since the Buffalo Common Council adopted the PUD on October 4, 2022. (A PUD comprises the rules and standards against which the Planning Board is to evaluate an application such as the one for Elmwood Crossing.)\n\nSack also took issue with the fact that the board was willing to entertain the Elmwood Crossing application while the site in question included signs advertising commercial leasing whose size Sack claimed violates Buffalo’s Green Code zoning ordinances.\n\n“The illegal real estate signs were still there as of a few days ago. I asked the board to table this item until the applicant takes our laws more seriously,” Sack said.\n\nThe planning board discounted Sack’s concerns after those related to the PUD were echoed by attorney Stephanie Adams, who represents several residents whose properties abut the former hospital. Adams asked the board for time to review the newly published PUD with her clients to determine whether Elmwood Crossing’s planning board application complied with it.\n\nThe Planning Board was not moved, and the five members present approved the application fifteen minutes after opening the item for a presentation from the developer, comments from the public, and discussion by board members.\n\n“We’re just not in a situation where, when hundreds of people are involved in this overall process, that two or three people who are not satisfied with the change or feel that they’re not fully informed should be able to hold up what is otherwise a pretty robust process,” said planning board member Cynthia Schwartz.\n\nResidents including Sack have been concerned that potential conflicts of interest concerning Elmwood Crossing could affect the planning board’s decision-making. Schwartz sat on the neighborhood committee that advised Kaleida Health on selling the former hospital to the present owners. Public records reveal that planning board member Martha Lamparelli’s husband Paul and her brother-in-law Joseph Jacobi jointly own a house less than one hundred feet from the northeast corner of the hospital property. Two other board members have not filed their annual financial disclosures for 2023.\n\nThe non-profit Kaleida Health sold the hospital complex, assessed in excess of $22 million dollars, to Elmwood Crossing, LLC for $1 million dollars in 2017. The LLC is a collaboration between Ellicott Development—a real estate company long operated by Carl Paladino—and Sinatra & Company, led by Nick Sinatra. Both men have been the subject of public scrutiny. Paladino was removed from the Buffalo School Board in 2017 after making racist comments about Barack and Michelle Obama and later expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler in his 2022 campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives. Sinatra has kept a lower profile, but Public Accountability Initiative and The Buffalo News singled him out in 2018 for deliberate nonpayment of property taxes.\n\nAccording to purchasing records I obtained through a Freedom of Information Law request, the administration of Mayor Byron Brown purchased for BPD two DJI Mavic drones from B&H Photo in May 2020, two Loki MK2 drones from Aardvark Tactical along with a DJI Mavic from Enterprise UAS in May 2021, a Loki MK2 from Aardvark in December 2022 to replace a Loki that had crashed, and another DJI Mavic from B&H Photo in June 2023.\n\nBPD’s use of DJI drones poses national security risks. In August 2017, sUAS News reported that the U.S. Army issued a prohibition on its use of DJI drones due to “cyber vulnerabilities,” citing a classified Army Research Laboratory report and a Navy memorandum from May 2017. A few days later, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Intelligence Program Los Angeles assessed with moderate confidence that American-operated DJI drones are “providing U.S. critical infrastructure and law enforcement data to the Chinese government” and assessed with high confidence that DJI “is selectively targeting government and privately owned entities within [infrastructure and law enforcement] sectors to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive U.S. data… that the Chinese government could use to conduct physical or cyber attacks against the United States and its population.”\n\nBloomberg reported in March 2020 that DJI created a program for China’s air force to track civilian DJI drones and identify drone operators from their phone numbers and that DJI partnered with China’s government to provide drones for the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, which operates internment camps for the arbitrary detention of over one million Muslims (the largest internment of an ethnoreligious group since the Holocaust). In December 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce banned American companies from selling components and other technologies to DJI, claiming that the company, along with three others, has “enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance.”\n\nSome of BPD’s DJI drones possess “intelligent flight modes” that allow them to autonomously follow targets including vehicles and pedestrians, although federal regulations prohibit flying drones outside of a remote pilot’s line of sight and prohibit sustained flight over people and moving vehicles by heavier drones with exposed rotors, such as BPD’s DJI Mavics, or by drones without Remote ID, such as the Loki MK2. FAA regulations also prohibit drone operation at night without anti-collision lights, but BPD’s $7,274 dollar Mavic 2 Enterprise Advanced includes a “discrete mode” that turns off its navigation LEDs so the drone can operate undetected while using thermal imaging to see in the dark.\n\nA review of the approximately 13,000 active FAA authorizations for drones registered in New York State reveals only one attributable to BPD—a DJI Mavic registered to its SWAT team. The Buffalo News bears two drone registrations—also for DJI models—and the Erie County Sheriff’s Office is down to one Autel drone (made by a Chinese competitor of DJI) after registrations for its three DJI drones expired in January 2023.\n\nBPD’s only FAA authorized drone was registered May 23, 2022, but Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia had earlier disclosed use of a BPD drone to search for a missing woman in January of 2022, while serving as a deputy commissioner. BPD later published a glimpse of its drones in a May 2023 social media video, which also shows off its Vantage robot and Lenco BearCat SWAT truck. Unlike in the case of six $8,626 sniper rifles—or even for an innocuous $2,500 dollars worth of second-hand groundskeeping equipment—none of BPD’s drones (nor its Vantage robot or Lenco BearCat) appear to have been the subject of requests to the Buffalo Common Council for permission to purchase.\n\nBPD has not provided other drone-related records I requested, including records of the funding and bidding for its drone purchases. Only some of the provided purchase orders reflect that drones were purchased pursuant to a bid. They also show that most of the drones were ordered by BPD’s grants office, but the leading provider of law enforcement grants, the U.S. Department of Justice, forbids the purchase of DJI drones with its grant money and requires that drones which aren’t forbidden to be accompanied by a comprehensive risk mitigation plan as well as policies and procedures for cybersecurity, for privacy protection, and to ensure compliance with federal law, regulations, and the U.S. Constitution. BPD’s Manual of Procedures does not cover drone use, and BPD did not provide any policies, procedures, or any records other than purchase orders in the time that BPD allotted to respond to my request for all its drone-related records.\n\nBPD’s steadily growing fleet of currently up to six drones is known to few and appears to be operating without the federal oversight which is required by law. The drone fleet’s capabilities and vulnerabilities pose significant safety hazards, security risks, and threats to civil liberties. Drone technology must be strictly stewarded with appropriate and well-enforced protocols for training, certification, deployment, operation, data encryption, and record-keeping, but BPD may not be exercising any such safeguards, and its records access division has not been able to provide reassurance to the contrary.\n\nThis blog remarked in April on Buffalo’s former Commission on Human Relations, which investigated a Buffalo police officer in 1966 for the fatal shooting of an unarmed Black youth. That body’s present-day successor, the Commission on Citizens' Rights and Community Relations (CCRCR), has the power to issue subpoenas and hold public and private hearings to mediate discrimination disputes, including police misconduct complaints, pursuant to the Charter of the City of Buffalo.\n\nThe CCRCR’s bylaws require it to meet quarterly to fulfill the City Charter’s requirement that it meet at least four times a year. The Charter also requires each of the city’s boards and commissions, including the CCRCR, to produce an annual report.\n\nAccording to public records, the CCRCR has not met since 2020, and its last annual report was for the year of 2019.\n\nIn response to a Freedom of Information Law request that I filed in my free time this March, the CCRCR’s executive director, Jason Whitaker, stated that the CCRCR has no records of any subsequent meetings, hearings, or reports, since “at the beginning of the pandemic, an administrative hold was placed on all commission’s activities including the CCRCR.” In response to a second request, Mr. Whitaker and a city attorney replied that there are no records related to the “administrative hold” and that no officer or employee of the CCRCR has a work calendar.\n\nMy initial request also sought a reasonably detailed current list by subject matter of all records in the possession of the agency (which each state or local government agency in New York State is required by law to update each year) and a record of the name, public office address, title, and salary of every officer and employee (which state law also requires each agency maintain). Mr. Whitaker declined to provide either of these records but pointed to the CCRCR’s website and to the OpenData Buffalo website, whose payroll records indicate that in 2022, the city paid the CCRCR director $101,071 dollars and the CCRCR secretary $54,724 dollars. Their combined pay since 2020 tops $500,174 dollars, according to the payroll dataset.\n\nOf the budgeted salaries for the 34 directorships in the city’s 2022-2023 adopted budget, the CCRCR director’s $102,683-dollar budgeted salary is higher than half. Of the 16 other secretaries budgeted, the CCCRC secretary has a higher budgeted salary than 13 of them and the same budgeted salary as the Secretary to the Commissioner of Police. Buffalo’s Police Commissioner oversees over one thousand employees, while the CCRCR director oversees just one (the CCRCR secretary).\n\nIn the Mayor of Buffalo’s 2023-2024 recommended budget, salaries for the CCRCR director and CCRCR secretary increase to $105,764 and $55,061 dollars. After the inclusion of $700 dollars budgeted for supplies, rentals, printing, and binding (up from $600, despite that the recommended budget shows that the CCRCR has not used any of these funds from the last two budgets), the budget’s recommended allocation for the CCRCR is $166,175 dollars.\n\nThis sizeable taxpayer expense appears wholly unjustified in light of the city’s indication that the CCRCR is paralyzed by an undocumented prohibition on the duties it is empowered by law to perform. Even worse, these duties include responding to and resolving complaints of discrimination by our government, which are allegations of serious federal crimes.\n\nBuffalo’s elected officials must take action if they are to honor their oaths of office. The clear long-term solution is to replace unaccountable bureaucratic appointees with a transparent and directly elected citizens review board, for which this blog has previously advocated.\n\nDuring its budget deliberations this month, the Buffalo Common Council has an opportunity to reallocate the CCRCR’s funding and earmark it for an independent and effectual oversight body. Buffalo residents have opportunities to demand that change when completing the council’s budget survey and when speaking in person or remotely at the council’s public hearing on the budget, which is scheduled for Tuesday, May 16 at 5:00 PM. The social welfare organization Our City Action Buffalo is scheduled to host an online budget information session the night before."
