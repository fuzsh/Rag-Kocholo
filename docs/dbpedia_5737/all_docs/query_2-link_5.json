        "text": "One of the most defining factors of a hurricane’s severity is the strength and speed of the wind it produces.\n\nHurricanes are violent storms that produce a number of deadly hazards, especially if they make landfall, including intense winds, a storm surge, rainfall flooding and tornadoes. Weather experts urge people affected by a hurricane to take protective action when any of these hazards present themselves, or when they’re expected to.\n\nRelated: Hurricane Ian strikes Cuba, Florida braces for Cat 4 damage\n\nHurricane winds have the potential to cause significant to “catastrophic” damage to affected communities, depending on how fast those sustained winds are moving. Hurricanes are, in fact, categorized based on the speed of its winds.\n\nThe storms, which most often occur in the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern north Pacific Ocean, are placed into one of five categories based on their wind speeds using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nA Category 1 hurricane is the lowest category and causes the least amount of damage, while a Category 5 hurricane is the most dangerous type of hurricane. A Category 1 hurricane is still capable of causing serious damage, though.\n\nAny hurricane identified as a Category 3 or higher is considered a “major” hurricane.\n\nHere’s how each hurricane category is broken down, as explained by the National Hurricane Center:\n\nThe document down below offers more details about the type of damage that can occur from winds during each hurricane category.\n\nIt’s also important to note that severe winds are not the only danger posed to residents and communities during a hurricane. A storm surge, for example, is an abnormal rise of water associated with a storm, and it brings the water level above its normal tidal level, infiltrating communities and damaging them. A storm surge can be deadly.\n\nStorm surge is not included on the SSHWS scale ranking hurricanes because there are “too many exceptions,” according to the NHC. For example, Hurricane Katrina, a Category 3 hurricane, produced a 28-foot storm surge, while Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 Hurricane, produced a 6-8-foot storm surge.\n\nLearn more on the NHC’s website right here."
