        "text": "So retail workers might hate me for this one.\n\nAnd I don’t blame them if they do. But this weekend I found the absolute best time to go shopping at the outlets.\n\nThe ones closest to me are the Jackson Outlets and they’re always packed to the brim with people. Any day of the week, and usually any time.\n\nSEE MORE: Hidden gem public golf course in a South Jersey town\n\nUnless you go an hour or less before closing.\n\nYeah, I know that’s probably not the best for making the workers like you, but it’s true.\n\nThey closed at 7 on Sunday and I got there at 6:30 p.m. and it was basically a ghost town there.\n\nStores had little to no people in them, there were zero lines for checkout. You basically had the entire store to yourself.\n\nAnd while it might not be great etiquette because the workers probably want to leave as soon as possible, they are open until 7 p.m. so I was there within store hours.\n\nI’m sure there’s probably unwritten rules about not being that kind of shopper, but I knew exactly what I needed to get and was in and out within 5 minutes.\n\nIt was the most stress free shopping I’ve ever done.\n\nIt will likely be the only time I go there from now on.\n\nForget the lines, forget the crowds of people everywhere, forget trying to find a parking spot.\n\nWhen you go later in the day none of that is an issue. And you can get your shopping done quick and efficiently.\n\nIt really makes a world of a difference.\n\nThe post above reflects the thoughts and observations of New Jersey 101.5's Kyle Clark. Any opinions expressed are his own."
