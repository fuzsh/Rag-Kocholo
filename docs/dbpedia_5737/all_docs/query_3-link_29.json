As at then, most European countries were still oblivious of the tube. Then, the usual congregation at the compound square for tales by moonlight shifted to the houses of the few affluent individuals who could afford a television set which supplanted the compound griot with its captivating black and white light and pictures that move and talk.\n\nToday, the television is one of the commonest things to find with almost every household in Nigeria having a set.\n\nCome, along as we take you through some of the television houses that have yielded their space as the history of television unfolds in Nigeria.\n\nWNTV\n\nThe first television station in Nigeria was the Western Nigerian Government Broadcasting Corporation (WNTV).
