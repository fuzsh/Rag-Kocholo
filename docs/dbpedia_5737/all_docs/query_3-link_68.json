        "text": "SEEKONK (WBSM) — The Big Lots location in Seekonk appears to be the only SouthCoast location currently set to close following the chain’s recent announcement that it would be shuttering 35 to 40 stores this year.\n\nFour other Massachusetts stores are also set to close.\n\nAs reported by WPRI, the Seekonk store, located at 179 Highland Avenue (Route 6), has a banner outside that reads “Closing This Store Only.”\n\nHowever, the Big Lots website also lists Ashland, Dennis Port, Northampton and West Springfield as the only other Massachusetts stores set to close. Overall, there are currently 23 Big Lots in the Bay State.\n\nThe chain’s only Rhode Island location, in Warwick, also appears safe.\n\nREAD MORE: Fairhaven Big Lots Store Says It Isn't Closing\n\nThe Seekonk store closure is not completely surprising, seeing as there is a store the next town over in Swansea.\n\nThe Seekonk location's website says \"Save up to 20 percent off\" with some exclusions.\n\nWhen Big Lots first announced it would close some stores, the Fairhaven Big Lots told WBSM it would remain open. This was after some confusion over the way a Boston news station reported the announcement.\n\nBig Lots, founded in 1967, has more than 1,400 stores across the United States, with other nearby locations including Raynham and Plymouth."
