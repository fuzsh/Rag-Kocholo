        "text": "Aug. 13, 2024, 10:18 a.m. ET\n\nThe data keep telling us that inflation is basically over as a problem.\n\nOn Tuesday morning we got the latest report on producer prices, and it was “soft.” That’s a good indicator for the much more widely watched Consumer Price Index, which we’ll get Wednesday. More important, the details in the report were especially encouraging for yet another price index, personal consumption expenditures, which won’t be released until later this month but which the Federal Reserve prefers as a basis for monetary policy.\n\nThis report follows some good news about inflation expectations.\n\nEconomists generally believe that the stagflation of the 1970s was so hard to end, requiring years of high unemployment, because expectations of continuing high inflation had become entrenched among businesses and consumers. Two years ago, when inflation was near its recent peak, I argued that disinflation would be much easier this time because it wasn’t similarly entrenched.\n\nI was right. In fact, on Monday the widely followed New York Fed survey of consumer expectations found that expected inflation over the next three years has fallen to its lowest level since the survey began in 2013:\n\nStill, some people are having a hard time letting go of the narrative that America is suffering from runaway inflation. Among those people, of course, is Donald Trump, who ranted about consumer prices in Monday night’s conversation with Elon Musk.\n\nI continue to be especially struck by Trump’s odd obsession with the price of bacon, which he insists costs “four or five times more than it did a few years ago.” This simply isn’t true. Indeed, while bacon prices are up, most workers’ wages are up considerably more:\n\nHonestly, I find Trump’s delusions about smoked pork harder to understand than his conspiracy theories about crowd sizes. After all, grocery prices are part of everyday experience, and easy to check. Why haven’t some big, strong men with tears in their eyes come up to him to say, “Sir, you’re wrong about bacon”?\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 1:57 p.m. ET\n\nCurrent artificial intelligence technologies have become surprisingly good at creating realistic images and video, unleashing fears that fake images can be used for political and election manipulation.\n\nWell, yes and no.\n\nFake A.I. imagery is a challenging problem, and not simply because it looks realistic. The key issue is that these images muddy the waters of credibility for everyone while providing a handy excuse for political operatives willing to lie to their supporters already eager to believe the lie.\n\nTake Donald Trump’s social media post on Sunday in which he accused Kamala Harris’s campaign of manipulating an image to make her crowd seem bigger at a Detroit airplane hangar last week.\n\n“Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport?” he wrote. “There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive ‘crowd’ of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!”\n\nHow do we know an image is real in this day and age? An average person can no longer be certain of the authenticity of images or, increasingly, even videos through individual sleuthing. The A.I. is that good and is getting better. (That’s why the classic media literacy advice — do your own research — doesn’t work anymore.)\n\nThis makes it difficult to know what to believe, except through a key mechanism: trusting sources and trusting that they have either taken the image or video themselves or carefully vetted it as authentic.\n\nThat’s how we know that the crowd waiting for Harris was real, because there are pictures from photo agencies like Getty, as well as images and reports from multiple other news organizations that were on the tarmac, that match the circulating social media photos that caught Trump’s ire. We know that credible news organizations and photo agencies have very strict rules about images and videos. But that, in turn, requires trusting the photo agency or other media source furnishing the image or video.\n\nIt’s no accident that Trump has made it a habit to portray credible news organizations as untrustworthy liars, and many of his supporters seem to have internalized that message they were open to in the first place.\n\nOnce trust is lost and all credibility is questioned, the lie doesn’t have to be high quality. It doesn’t have to be supported by highly realistic fake A.I. It doesn’t have to be so easily disprovable. To work, the lie just needs a willing purveyor and an eager audience. The A.I., then, is but a fig leaf.\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 11:06 a.m. ET\n\nChina and the United States tied for gold medals at 40 apiece, and the United States had more medals overall, but the most successful nation at the Paris Olympics was Australia. France was second, followed by Britain and the Netherlands, with the United States coming in fifth and China 89th.\n\nThat’s according to a new ranking method that I wrote about ahead of the Games. Its inventors, Robert Duncan and Andrew Parece, wanted a method that wouldn’t overly favor the most-populous nations, but also wouldn’t give the top ranking every four years to a small country that gets a medal or two. (This year Grenada, with two medals, had the most per capita, followed by Dominica and St. Lucia.)\n\nAustralia tends to do well by their method. It also came out on top in the Tokyo Games. (It bears repeating, of course, that there is no official national winner, because the Games are a competition among athletes, not countries.)\n\nThe Duncan-Parece method ranks countries according to how improbable their medal counts are, on the assumption that all medal-winning nations have an equal propensity per capita for winning medals.\n\nAs they wrote in their paper on the subject: “We simply ask: how probable is it, in this idealization, for a given high-performing country (with a given population) to have won as many medals as it actually did, or more medals?”\n\nTheir measure of improbability is the one you would use to calculate the likelihood of flipping heads, say, 10 times in a row.\n\nThere seems to be growing interest in the subject. Duncan emailed me on Sunday to say that people from 153 countries had visited their website, olympicnationalrankings.com.\n\nAug. 9, 2024, 3:03 p.m. ET\n\nThe first atomic bomb used in war, which was dropped on Hiroshima by the United States, heralded a new age in warfare and World War II’s imminent end. Three days later, on Aug. 9, 1945, Americans dropped a second bomb, on Nagasaki. In that city, even to this day, officials, survivors and ordinary residents insist that Nagasaki should be remembered not as one of the first cities to suffer devastation from the wartime use of a nuclear weapon, but as the last.\n\n“If a nuclear weapon were to be used, what will happen beneath the mushroom cloud?” Mayor Shiro Suzuki of Nagasaki, the child of atomic bomb survivors, said in an interview last fall. “What will happen to the humans below?”\n\nNagasaki, a centuries-old trading port, was never meant to be the target. It was a sick twist of fortune: the city had barely made the Americans’ strike list; on the day of the attack, it became the target only when the original target, Kokura, a city of some 130,000 people, was too difficult for the bombers to see.\n\nAnd even then, the atomic bomb dubbed “Fat Man” missed its mark, exploding roughly 1,650 feet above the area of Nagasaki known as Urakami — home to Japan’s largest Catholic population — instead of the original target downtown.\n\nThe bomb killed an estimated 70,000 people. Within 10,000 feet of the epicenter, combustible material burst into flames, and Urakami Cathedral, then the largest Catholic church in Asia, was ablaze. The flames in the Urakami district burned for around 14 hours.\n\nNear what was once ground zero for the explosion, there are small reminders of the bomb’s devastation. A thin tower of bricks from the original Urakami Cathedral stands above the grass and stone a few feet from the epicenter. There’s half a torii gate, split cleanly down the middle by the blast, that stands at the foot of the Sanno Shrine. Nearby, camphor trees, once stripped bare by the bomb, have grown back lush and green.\n\nWith conflicts raging in places such as Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan, the feeling that the world is on a path to repeat itself is palpable among atomic bomb survivors, known in Japan as hibakusha. Seiichiro Mise, who was 10 years old when America dropped the bomb on Nagasaki, said that on television he saw a young boy inside an air raid shelter in Ukraine. The boy was shaking and tearful, Mise said, wishing the war would end — a feeling he once shared. “All of us here,” he said, “have the potential to become a victim of nuclear weapons.”\n\nToday, standing atop Mount Nabekanmuri, in the southeast of the city, you see the sprawl of a modern metropolis, home to some 400,000 residents, that with hope could be the last place to ever experience the horrors of nuclear war.\n\nAug. 9, 2024, 12:12 p.m. ET\n\nAnyone who has ever stood in line at a modern coffee shop and eavesdropped on fellow patrons’ painstakingly specific orders (skim milk, soy milk, oat milk, decaf, half-caf, blended, frothed, iced) knows that the adage is wrong: We are not what we eat. We are what we drink. It’s how we intentionally brand ourselves, unintentionally reveal ourselves or some combination of the two.\n\nWhich brings me to Diet Mountain Dew.\n\nThe beverage has had a starring role in the 2024 campaign because, it turns out, both vice-presidential candidates are fans of it. That suggests some artificially sweetened version of horseshoe theory, with left and right arriving at a similar destination, a carbonated détente.\n\nIt also makes sense. The beverage — advertised as citrusy, experienced as syrupy — enjoys special popularity in the middle of the country, where Senator JD Vance of Ohio and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota reside. It’s an elixir without airs, in keeping with both men’s preferred public images. It’s also zero calories per serving, and neither man seems to be a metabolic marvel liberated from any worry about weight.\n\nPoliticians and their potions — the subject could fill a tome, equal parts history, psychology, anthropology and gastronomy. President Thomas Jefferson, so aristocracy-minded, spent scandalous amounts of money on wine. President Theodore Roosevelt, so appreciative of nature, plucked mint from the White House garden for juleps. President Donald Trump, so given to excess, drank as many as 12 Diet Cokes a day.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush, so quintessentially patrician, savored vodka martinis. President George W. Bush, so proud of his sobriety, favored nonalcoholic beer — and his aides took care not to have him photographed with one, lest someone mistake it for the real thing and falsely accuse him of tumbling off the wagon.\n\nVance started the ado about Dew by joking at a rally that lefties would probably deem him racist for drinking it. (He never really explained that.) Then Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, a Democrat, shot back: “Who drinks Diet Mountain Dew?” Um, many Kentuckians. Beshear apologized even before Walz came out as a Dew devotee.\n\nIn a land of plenty that reveres personal freedom, I say we imbibe as we wish. And interpret what we may. And stay hydrated. You Dew you. I’ll have a Yoo-hoo.\n\nAug. 9, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET\n\nAuthenticity is one of the most underrated human qualities. In our prepackaged, fully spun, Instagram-ready age, it’s harder to find than ever. Politically speaking, it is Gov. Tim Walz’s great advantage as a vice-presidential candidate, particularly in comparison with Vice President Kamala Harris, who often speaks in the kind of jargon pablum that feels fundamentally dishonest. She may believe what she says, but she doesn’t say it clearly enough for me to know what she believes.\n\nFor me, at least, that changed on Wednesday when Harris responded decisively to a heckler at her rally in Detroit.\n\n“I am speaking now,” she said calmly. When the protesters continued to interrupt Harris’s remarks, she lost her patience. As The Times reported: “‘You know what?’ Harris said, with the sudden force and resolve of a parent in the driver’s seat who has had it. ‘If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I’m speaking.’”\n\nThere was something so refreshing, so real about Harris (slightly) losing her cool. She didn’t sputter or flail about like Donald Trump or like many a political candidate before him. She even smiled as she spoke, a delicious power move on her part.\n\nStudies have consistently shown that men are more prone to interrupting than women and interrupt more frequently when the other person talking is a woman. In one study on language and sex, researchers found that in conversations between a man and a woman, 96 percent of the interruptions were initiated by men.\n\nThis was not Harris’s first time at that rodeo. In her 2020 debate with former Vice President Mike Pence, she chastised him with the same line — “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking” — after he repeatedly interrupted her. And back in 2017, The Times described an instance in which Harris was twice interrupted by male Republican senators, John McCain and Richard Burr. At the time, she was interrogating then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. If this was Harris the prosecutor speaking on Wednesday, it would be great to hear a lot more from that Harris. Next time, without interruption.\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 6:30 p.m. ET\n\nIn a forbidding and deliberately frightening news conference on Thursday, Donald Trump took listeners on what sounded like a tour of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Mordor. But the fetid swamps and jagged mountains of the shadowy land that Donald Trump described were the streets of the United States under the Biden/Harris administration, all of which he suggested will grow more foul should the country’s people make the fatal mistake of electing Kamala Harris president instead of him. His list of the plagues facing America included:\n\n“Both gangs on the street and frankly gangs outside of our country.”\n\n“We could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety, which would be devastating.”\n\n“We’ll be very close to a world war.”\n\n“You have millions and millions of dead people and you have people dying financially because they can’t buy bacon. They can’t buy food, they can’t buy groceries, they can’t do anything. And they’re living horribly in our country right now.”\n\n“Our country is right now in the most dangerous position it’s ever been in from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint.”\n\nTim Walz “has positions that are just not even possible to believe that they exist. He’s going for things that nobody’s ever heard of. Heavy into the transgender world, heavy into lots of different worlds, having to do with safety.”\n\nThe description of these evils was so over the top that it strongly suggested Trump had simply lost his bearings in the face of the surge of enthusiasm that has been unleashed by Harris and Walz, evident in their poll numbers, prolific fund-raising and overflowing rally crowds. Having lost his earlier lead over President Biden, Trump has been complaining about his campaign lately, The Washington Post reported on Thursday, and his frustration was evident in his attempt to simply scare the public into voting for him.\n\nHe really lost it when a reporter asked him about the size of Harris’s crowds, frothing that she was getting crowds of 1,000 or 1,500 people (it was actually about 15,000 on Tuesday in Detroit) while he got a crowd on the New Jersey shore in May of more than 100,000, which even Fox News said was no more than 30,000. At one point, bizarrely and nonsensically, he claimed that his crowd on Jan. 6, 2021 (about 10,000 people, many of whom went on to trash the Capitol) was bigger than that of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..’s March on Washington in 1963, which drew about 250,000 people. Clearly the Harris rallies are getting to him.\n\nBut most of all, he can’t stand the sense of joyful enthusiasm that Harris and Walz are bringing to their campaign. He can’t come to grips with the sunny optimism of his opponents, their laughter and energy as they sketch out plans for a brighter day. Lacking joy himself, all he can counter with is darkness and permanent rain.\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 5:11 p.m. ET\n\nOver the years, Americans have become inured to Donald Trump’s contempt for the military. Trump, who got out of service in Vietnam by claiming to have bone spurs, has frequently mocked P.O.W.s, denigrated wounded veterans and called those interred at Arlington National Cemetery (including members of my family) “losers.”\n\nNow the Trump campaign is once again demonstrating its lack of respect for military service as Trump’s running mate, a former Marine, denigrates Gov. Tim Walz’s 24 years of duty in the National Guard, during which he served as a command sergeant major. In remarks in Michigan on Wednesday, Senator JD Vance accused Walz — with little evidence — of “stolen valor,” saying he lied about seeing combat “in war.” And then Vance drew a comparison between his four years of service, during which he was a combat correspondent, and Walz’s 24.\n\n“When the U.S. Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,” Vance said. “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.”\n\nFor the most part, these claims, repeated uncritically by the internet’s MAGA faithful, don’t pass muster. It took precisely no time to figure out that Walz filed the paperwork to run for Congress and submitted his request to retire months before any official order to deploy to Iraq was received. According to a National Guardsman who served under Walz, he had been weighing the decision to run for Congress for quite a while.\n\nLike many Guard members in the early 2000s, Walz was deployed overseas. His unit went to Italy as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. He did not see combat; however, he did say, in comments supporting a ban on assault weapons, “We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.” Walz should clarify the record on this point at the earliest opportunity, lest someone assume — to be frank, fairly — that he intended to claim that he had seen combat.\n\nFalsehoods can be debunked and records can be corrected, but Vance’s insidiously clever accusation will linger. For one, many people won’t care to parse the details of Vance’s spurious claims and the facts of Walz’s record, but they may remember some vague idea that Walz lied about his service. Vance’s line of attack was also perfectly calibrated to undermine Walz’s gentle masculinity, by not so subtly implying that his combatless service record somehow makes him less of a soldier and, by extension, less of a man.\n\nTo be clear: Neither Walz nor Vance has seen, as Vance says, “any real fighting.” In either case, their choice to serve was commendable. Should Vance wish for anyone to take seriously his lectures about honoring members of the armed services, he ought to start by giving one to the draft dodger at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 10:12 a.m. ET\n\nPity Tanya Chutkan, the punctilious federal district judge in Washington who inherited the ill-fated Jan. 6 prosecution of Donald Trump one year ago and has since done everything by the book, only to be rewarded with an eight-month delay while the defendant pressed his claim that he exists magically above the law.\n\nIt was a claim so outrageous, so detached from basic constitutional principles and hard-won lessons of American history, so fundamentally Trumpian, that virtually no serious person would countenance it — no one, that is, until six Supreme Court justices did last month, on the final day of the term.\n\nNow Chutkan has to clean up the mess the right-wing majority made in its ruling, which created a shockingly broad yet poorly defined zone of immunity from criminal prosecution for presidents who can argue that they were engaged in their “official” duties.\n\nThis means going line by line through the special counsel Jack Smith’s 45-page indictment and separating the charges that involve official acts from those that are unofficial. The former must be dismissed; the latter might survive. The process will most likely include what some legal observers are calling a “mini-trial,” in which the government would be able to present some of its evidence in open court. It’s a far cry from an actual jury trial — which could and should have taken place months ago and surely would have if the defendant was not named Trump — but at this point it’s the only chance the American people will have to get more clarity on the details of the former president’s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nIt’s also an opportunity for Chutkan to call the justices’ bluff. When they wrote that it remains possible to hold a president to account for breaking the law, did they mean it?\n\nThe best way to get an answer to that question is to apply the methodological rigor the court refused to use. This work is already underway, thanks to the good folks at Just Security, the national-security site that has been obsessively tracking and analyzing the various Trump prosecutions. In a color-coded annotation of the indictment, Just Security breaks down which charges are almost certain to be dismissed (red), which are on the fence (yellow) and which are likely to survive (green).\n\nIn the first category are the charges involving Trump’s communications with Justice Department officials, which the Supreme Court explicitly said count as official acts, even though they were plainly based on allegations of election fraud he had been told were false.\n\nBeyond those communications and a few others that Trump had with then-Vice President Mike Pence, however, Just Security’s annotation is a sea of greens and yellows. In other words, a vast majority of Trump’s behavior on and around Jan. 6, 2021, was not taken in any official capacity and should not be immune from prosecution.\n\nThis is obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes and a memory of that awful day. The question is whether that category includes the right-wing supermajority of the Supreme Court.\n\nAug. 8, 2024, 5:06 a.m. ET\n\nShortly before primary polls opened in Michigan last winter, an antiwar movement appeared to be gaining popularity, pledging to cast “uncommitted” votes unless President Biden ended the U.S. government’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza. At the time, one Democrat reportedly said of Biden and his retinue: “They are freaking out about the uncommitted vote.”\n\nAbout 100,000 primary votes in Michigan, home to the country’s largest population of Arab Americans, were cast for uncommitted; the statewide campaign had aimed to reach just 10,000. Similar results poured in across the country, and established the antiwar movement as a real political force.\n\nThe uncommitted bloc spoke in a language that elected officials could understand: the language of primary voting. But for that very reason, the upcoming Democratic convention will not be an electoral-political showdown over Gaza. There are only 30 uncommitted delegates; over 4,500 other delegates have already pledged their support for Kamala Harris.\n\nBut those 30 delegates still have demands — a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and an embargo of U.S. weapons for Israel — which they hope their presence will prevent Harris from forgetting. Ending the war and halting military aid “should be the lowest hanging fruit,” June Rose, an uncommitted delegate from Rhode Island, told me. “It’s time for us to stop killing and killing Palestinian children.”\n\nThe delegates say they want the Democratic nominee to remember the electoral threat that uncommitted voters produced during the primaries. “The ball is in their court,” Rose said. “This is about saving democracy, and this is about ending a genocide.”\n\nWhile party progressives see Biden as Israel’s enabler in chief, his second in command has received a relatively warmer welcome. “She was one person who’s constantly calling for cease-fires,” Asma Mohammed, a delegate in Minnesota who is the head organizer of the state’s uncommitted campaign, told me. “She’s maybe more sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people, and we’re hopeful in that.”\n\nBut there is also concern that, like about half of congressional Democrats, Harris has received money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, a pro-Israel group.\n\nAs a senator, Harris hewed closely to the Washington consensus on Israel. Lately her message has changed. Unlike most public officials, she has acknowledged that Palestinians in Gaza, subject to Israel’s blockade of food, are “eating leaves or animal feed” to survive. Her team has privately engaged Arab and Muslim communities, as well as elected officials, to encourage activism for a cease-fire, according to Abbas Alawieh, director of the national Uncommitted Movement.\n\nEven if Harris’s rhetorical shift is evident, her policy position is not. “I need to hear from Vice President Harris how it is that she will differentiate her Gaza policy from President Biden’s,” said Alawieh, who is an uncommitted delegate in Michigan. “What voters here, especially in Michigan, are very interested in hearing about isn’t just if you’re asking me to vote for one candidate or the other. It’s: How are these candidates communicating about whether or not they will stop killing our families?”\n\nA correction was made on\n\nAug. 11, 2024\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the food crisis in Gaza. Although Israel has severely limited the amount of food aid that reaches Palestinians in Gaza, some trucks have been allowed in; the blockade is not a “blanket blockade.”\n\nHow we handle corrections\n\nAug. 7, 2024, 4:15 p.m. ET\n\nDonald Trump wants to eliminate taxation of Social Security benefits. That may be a political winner, but it’s bad idea economically for at least four reasons.\n\nFirst, those taxes support trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. Eliminating them would cost around $1.7 trillion over 10 years, accelerating the exhaustion of the trust fund for Social Security retirement benefits by more than one year and for Medicare hospital insurance by six years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nTo keep the programs solvent, either some other tax would have to be raised or benefits would have to be cut. If the former president has a plan for doing one or both of those two things, he should spell it out now, but he has avoided discussing the implications of his idea. Most likely, any fix would shift the burden to young working people, Romina Boccia, the director of budget and entitlement policy at the conservative Cato Institute, told The Times.\n\nSecond, eliminating taxation of Social Security would violate the principle that people with equal incomes should be taxed equally. Other retirement income, such as from private pensions, is taxed, so it’s hard to justify why Social Security benefits shouldn’t be. “There is no sound reason why two retirees with identical total pretax incomes should have vastly different after-tax incomes due to having different mixes of retirement saving,” Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote last week.\n\nThird, the wealthy would benefit the most. “In dollar terms, the biggest winners would be those in the top 0.1 percent of income,” the Tax Policy Center wrote last week. Households earning $63,000 to $200,000 would get the biggest tax break as a share of their after-tax income, the center added.\n\nFourth, why? If stimulating economic growth is what you’re after, cutting Social Security taxation won’t get you there. If anything, by in effect increasing benefits, it could encourage people to retire earlier, shrinking the work force, as The Wall Street Journal editorialized last week. If intergenerational equity is what matters, this goes the wrong direction. As it is, young people are slated to get a worse deal from Social Security than their elders.\n\nThis feels like Trumpian pandering. Unfortunately for the Democrats, they have to make this point carefully because, as The Times points out, their vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, as governor of Minnesota signed a bill exempting Social Security payments from state taxes for many seniors. (True, only a minority of states — the number keeps changing — tax Social Security benefits at all, and Minnesota’s decision has no effect on the finances of Social Security and Medicare.)\n\nFor sensible tax policy, election seasons are perilous.\n\nAug. 7, 2024, 1:50 p.m. ET\n\nIn tapping Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota for her running mate, Kamala Harris is experimenting with a quality not often seen in high-level national politics: the goofball factor.\n\nPart of Walz’s charm is his lack of political polish: his penchant for silly jokes and faces, his willingness to risk looking ridiculous (I trust you’ve seen the piglet pic), his smiley, gee-whiz amazement. The goofball factor is slightly different from the Regular-Guy vibe or the Small-Town vibe — although there is considerable overlap. Hailing from a culture that values tater tots can convey a real edge in the goofball department.\n\nMany of us have a friend like Walz: the dorky dad/cousin/high school geography teacher who loves to make his wife or kids roll their eyes at him. If you haven’t seen the “Turkey is meat” exchange between the governor and his daughter, check it out. I’ll wait.\n\nAs a political matter, the goofball factor risks making one seem unpresidential. But for a V.P. contender, there are upsides. One, it helps the ticket seem less intimidating, more relatable, and certainly less patronizing. I mean, it’s hard to look down on folks while snuggling a pig.\n\nMore specifically, it allows Walz to serve as an attack dog without seeming mean. At the rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, he tossed off multiple zingers — about Donald Trump’s criminality, about how “creepy and weird as hell” the Republican ticket is and even about JD Vance’s apocryphal affection for couches — while sounding downright genial.\n\nI watched Walz’s remarks repeatedly, mostly to observe Harris’s reactions. Mostly, she nodded along, smiling indulgently or looking thoughtfully concerned as the moment dictated. Now and then, she’d laugh and clap. For the more eyebrow-raising bits — including the couch line — she looked to be consciously tamping down her reaction, even fighting not to burst out laughing.\n\nThis speaks to how Walz could be of particular value to Harris. Too often, women can have a hard time convincing some people that they have the gravitas to be strong leaders. Harris in particular has faced a … weird amount of criticism over her laugh, which many voters think makes her seem unserious and not that bright.\n\nSimply by contrast, Walz’s dorky dad energy could aid Harris’s quest to seem more presidential. She can play the straight woman, staying above the fray while he brings the fun with partisan barbs and groaners she could never get away with.\n\nEverybody understands his or her mission. And Harris can steer clear of camo ball caps, hunting vests and farm animals for the duration.\n\nAug. 6, 2024, 10:49 a.m. ET\n\nThere’s a lot of talk that Kamala Harris picked Tim Walz to prevent Josh Shapiro’s views on the Middle East from becoming a distraction. But the more relevant reason that Walz was chosen is electoral.\n\nIt’s true that we were told for weeks that Electoral College criteria would lead to Shapiro, in the hopes that he could put the crucial state of Pennsylvania in Harris’s column. And if Harris narrowly loses Pennsylvania and thus the election, the failure to pick Shapiro will reverberate for generations.\n\nBut electoral math has many permutations. Shapiro, like Harris, is from the coastal elite. By contrast, Walz — a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard — graduated from high school in a Nebraska town of 400 and later coached the Mankato West Scarlets to a Minnesota high school football championship. Unlike JD Vance, Walz didn’t leave home for Yale and private equity. Once his life story penetrates among voters, he will probably shore up Democrats in parts of the country where they need help the most.\n\nOver the years, rural counties in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada have felt abandoned by Democrats. Many went for Donald Trump in the last two elections by 20 points or more, and he remains very popular in those places. But Walz, an authentic rural voice, might change that outcome and reduce Trump’s share to 55 percent from roughly 60 percent in enough counties. If that happens, Harris will win the election.\n\nAug. 6, 2024, 5:04 a.m. ET\n\nOne key reason that Google was found to be an illegal monopoly in an important antitrust decision on Monday was that it paid billions of dollars to be the default search engine for companies like Apple. But that’s not the only way the digital world has become so centralized, giving just a few companies the ability to dominate the industry.\n\nAll too often in the digital world, rich companies get richer and big ones get bigger thanks partly to something called network effects, which allow the early winners to build on that advantage to resist competition and shield themselves against market pressures — even if their product later loses its luster.\n\nImagine there are two standards for making phone calls, and each phone can use only one. Let’s say one standard gets to market first or has better sales, and 65 percent of the people you regularly call use it. Then a second standard comes in with much better sound quality, but not many people are using it.\n\nYou’d likely pick the one with the most users you call, despite the inferior sound, since the ability to call others is the critical reason for the phone. The superior phone has little to no chance. That’s called a network effect.\n\nIf many people are on WhatsApp, that’s what people and businesses will use to communicate, which makes the platform even stronger — and that’s why it mattered that Facebook was allowed to purchase WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.\n\nTo many at the time, it seemed like a crazy price, because WhatsApp had made only about $10 million in revenue in 2013. But Facebook was buying the network effect and killing a potential competitor at once. It’s probably one of the best purchases the company made.\n\nThis, then, can build on itself. Google’s search engine initially pulled ahead through a genuinely better product, but it also got something that its competitors didn’t have: billions of searches helping it understand what people were looking for, which the company then could use to improve its search results.\n\nIt also made sense for advertisers to go where the users were, which gave Google all those billions to pay Apple to remain its default search engine — something that worked even if the quality of the search results went down, which they did, at least in my experience.\n\nSuch effects are everywhere in the digital world.\n\nFor example, Apple and Google’s Android have the biggest app stores, so naturally most companies will write apps for their platforms, further incentivizing a consumer to purchase an Apple or Android phone because that’s where the best programs are — and so on.\n\nThe Google antitrust ruling is the first big win of its kind for the government in a long time, and it may be a good first step, but the anti-competitive forces that dominate the digital world go beyond that. And countering them will require new, sensible regulation that matches how digital technology actually works.\n\nAug. 5, 2024, 5:49 p.m. ET\n\nUpdate: Representative Shri Thanedar won the Aug. 6 primary with about 54 percent of the vote.\n\nThis election season has been studded with stories about race, mainly because of dumb things that Donald Trump has said about “Black jobs” and Kamala Harris’s racial identity. But race is also coming up in a congressional race in Detroit, in which Democrats are trying to take out one of their own — Representative Shri Thanedar, a freshman and an Indian-born entrepreneur — in Tuesday’s primary election.\n\nPowerful figures in Detroit, including Mayor Mike Duggan, have endorsed Thanedar’s most serious rival, City Council member Mary Waters, who is Black, arguing that Thanedar hasn’t been helpful when the city needs it. That might be payback for Thanedar’s opposition to a hefty package of tax breaks to wealthy developers. But others oppose Thanedar because they say the seat, representing a majority Black city, should be held by a Black person.\n\n“When it’s all said and done, we’ve got to have somebody there who understands the unique needs of African Americans,” Waters told the Michigan Advance, a nonprofit news site. “Because we do have some unique needs — some of the things that we should be fighting for, when it comes to voting rights, for example.”\n\nThanedar, who came from humble beginnings in India and got rich from starting a pharmaceutical company in the United States after years of struggle, won the election two years ago in a nine-way contest. News outlets noted that his election marked the first time in nearly 70 years that Detroit didn’t have a Black lawmaker representing it in Congress. (The other congressional seat that includes parts of Detroit is held by Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman in Congress.)\n\nThanedar says that the poverty he grew up in allows him to relate to his voters in a way that other politicians can’t. In any case, he swears that his ethnicity is not important to them.\n\n“The people on the street don’t care,” he told me. “They tell me all the time: ‘Solve our problems. Fix the crime. I don’t have public transportation. Take care of that.’” It’s the media and the establishment Democrats that created the narrative that his seat is a “Black seat,” he said. On Tuesday, in a primary that is tantamount to the general election, we will see if he’s right.\n\nAug. 5, 2024, 4:50 p.m. ET\n\nGOAT. Most decorated. Winningest. It sounds hokey, but the most satisfying and joyful part of the Olympics for me is not which country is leading the medal count but when the best athletes in the world show their respect and admiration for one another, especially after an underperformance. On Monday, the last day of the artistic gymnastics competition, Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles, the Americans who took silver and bronze medals in the floor exercise final, showed such sportsmanship to Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade, who won gold.\n\nDuring the medal ceremony, Biles and Chiles bowed down to the Brazilian as she climbed the podium to receive her medal. Andrade had already come in second to Biles in the all-around and vault event finals, but she took advantage of Biles’s two out-of-bounds landings to take first on floor.\n\nAndrade was runner-up to Biles at the 2023 World Championships and second to Suni Lee at the Tokyo Olympics all-around. It may have been frustrating to keep coming in second, but she has been consistently supportive over the years, saying, for instance, that it was an “honor” to compete against Biles.\n\nFor her part, Biles has acknowledged her own fallibility and reminded us that just because she makes winning look easy does not mean that it is. After the all-around final, Biles said of Andrade: “She’s way too close. I’ve never had an athlete that close, so it definitely put me on my toes, and it brought out the best athlete in myself.”\n\nOf course, it’s easy to be gracious when you’ve won the gold. On Monday, in what might be her final Olympic performance, Biles took the silver on floor after a disappointing fifth-place finish on the balance beam. But when Chiles suggested that they bow down to Andrade, Biles eagerly agreed, creating one of the most iconic images from these Olympics.\n\nChiles explained their thinking during an interview after the competition. “Why don’t we just give her her flowers?” she said. “Not only has she given Simone her flowers but a lot of us in the United States our flowers as well. So giving it back is what makes it so beautiful. So I felt like it was needed.”\n\nAug. 5, 2024, 2:04 p.m. ET\n\nThe secret to making money in the stock market is to buy low and sell high. Right? Not buy high and sell low.\n\nSo loading up on stocks when the market is breaking records and then dumping them when something bad happens is not the road to riches.\n\nYet that’s exactly what a lot of investors are undoubtedly doing, or contemplating, right now. I typed “Should I” into the Google search bar on Monday and the first autocomplete choice was “Should I sell my stocks now?” The third choice was “Should I sell my stocks?”\n\nIn between, by the way, was “Should I buy Nvidia stock?” Apparently, there are still some optimists out there.\n\nI’m a journalist, not an investment adviser, so I don’t have any bright ideas for how to cope with market turmoil. I’ll just repeat the standard advice: Most of us amateurs should be long-term, buy-and-hold investors. Trying to time the ups and downs of the market rarely works.\n\nIt’s different if you have a big expense coming up soon. Then you really should think about selling stocks and putting the money in something safe, like a checking account. It would have been smarter to do that before the market broke, but better late than never.\n\nAug. 5, 2024, 11:13 a.m. ET\n\nA jury in Tampa, Fla., has ordered a now-defunct stem cell clinic to pay at least $9 million in damages to more than 1,000 patients who say they were misled, lied to and put at medical risk by unscrupulous doctors offering scam therapies. The decision, nearly a decade in the making, is a welcome one for plaintiffs — and for anyone who cares about accountability.\n\nBut it will not do much for countless other patients who have been similarly duped.\n\nNearly a decade after a spate of mishaps first drew attention to the problem, clinics promoting dubious “adult stem cell” treatments for just about any medical condition you can think of (from autism to sexual dysfunction and diabetes) are still flourishing in the United States. These treatments are not only expensive and unproved, they can be dangerous. They have left some patients blind, others paralyzed and at least one dead.\n\nSo far, the Food and Drug Administration has made only vague gestures toward addressing the problem. In 2017, the agency said that at least some adult stem cell treatments would need to secure federal approval. Companies whose products had not been deemed an imminent threat to human health were given three years to comply with the requirement, and those with particularly risky offerings (such as products that get injected directly into the veins or the central nervous system) were threatened with imminent sanctions.\n\nFor the most part, though, nothing happened. “You’d think the F.D.A. would have taken dozens of actions,” Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell scientist at the University of California at Davis, told me. “But it just hasn’t happened.” The agency has long maintained that it lacks the resources to do much. But critics say that what officials there really lack is resolve.\n\nIt’s easy to see where such apathy might come from. Once revered as a bulwark against snake oil medicine, the F.D.A. is now seen by many Americans as a mere tool of the pharmaceutical industry, tasked with promoting and protecting corporate profits above all else. Attempts to regulate certain products (stem cells, dietary supplements, e-cigarettes) have been met with public outcries in some cases — and with countermeasures led by interest groups meant to undermine the agency in others. A recent Supreme Court decision limiting federal regulatory powers will only make this problem worse.\n\nThe F.D.A. should be doing everything in its power to reverse this erosion of trust. It can start by drawing much more attention to the harms caused by untested products and then working aggressively to hold the purveyors of those products to account. Class-action victories against snake oil salesmen are great. But the goal should still be to protect patients before they are harmed, not just to compensate them after the fact.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nAug. 6, 2024\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misidentified the campus of the University of California where Paul Knoepfler works as a scientist.
