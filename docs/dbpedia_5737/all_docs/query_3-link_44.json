        "text": "On Iris, leave almost well enough alone\n\nYes, one more letter about Iris Avenue. This one comes from someone with a lifelong background as a teacher. More about that in a moment. My proposal for Iris is to pretty much leave almost well enough alone! It’s a major east/west arterial with admittedly too high speeds. Here is where the teacher part comes in. There is a speed limit. Enforce it! Install speed control cameras and send a message that speeding has logical consequences. Stick with it. Rules without fair and consistent enforcement are ineffective at changing behaviors. An added bonus is that the speeding scofflaws will be contributing to the city coffers.\n\nAnd what about cyclists on Iris? As I write, many cyclists who find Iris daunting are already using Kalmia, Grape and Glenwood. They can continue to do so. Other cyclists take advantage of the arterial nature of Iris to quickly (and safely) use the existing bike lanes to get into or out of town. The proposed two-direction bike lane on the north side seems fraught with peril. Cyclists riding in both directions without a physical separation feels and often is unsafe. How are cyclists to safely cross BOTH bike and traffic lanes to get on and off the two-lane path?\n\nHere’s the solution: pave and re-stripe Iris. Post and consistently enforce a reasonable speed limit. Trust cyclists to know whether they want to ride on Iris or on the adjacent side streets. The bottom line … civic goodwill and savings of a significant amount of public funds.\n\nJohn Zola, Boulder\n\nThe dustbin of history is waiting for Trump\n\nWhat would I say to ex-President Trump if I had a chance? I’d say, Mister, at 88 years of age I am ten years your senior and know and remember things that you do not. For example, an actual personal remembrance of WWII, and of pulling my wagon around the neighborhood to collect twisted wire coat hangers and flattened tin cans for the scrap drive, of our neighbors’ windows with red and white banners with blue stars in them that sometimes turned to gold, and of my older brother going off to fight and help to corner and kill the German dictator and kill the Japanese dictator and kill the Italian dictator and hang his body from a lamp-post for all the world to see and know that the dictators were dead.\n\nSince you have announced your intention to be a dictator over all of us here in the United States of America, if you think that I would support you in that effort … then, Sonny, you have your head up your “anatomy.” Finally, I would say that, after Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as the Democratic candidate against you for president in this fall’s national election, the Dustbin of History has opened its mouth wide and is waiting for you.\n\nDon Bryan, Boulder\n\nPublic servants deserve their retirement benefits\n\nRegarding the proposed repeal of the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO).\n\nThere is absolutely no excuse to delay and delay and delay bringing this to a vote. It has long since garnered enough support to do so. The Republicans need to quit dragging their feet on passing this and other bills. Bring it to a vote and then get it passed once and for all.\n\nI have dedicated over 32 years of my life working for GSA, the BOM (now defunct), and the Dept of Transportation. As I approach retirement, I had always hoped for a secure and comfortable future. However, the unfair impact of the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset has left me facing unexpected financial challenges during my retirement.\n\nHaving devoted my career to public service, I knew that my pension would be a vital component of my retirement income. Yet, the reduction in my Social Security benefits due to the WEP and GPO has taken a toll on my financial stability, leaving me with far less than what I had anticipated. This unjust double-dipping penalty has left me questioning the recognition of the contributions made by public servants like myself.\n\nThe Social Security Fairness Act presents an opportunity to rectify these inequalities and provide hardworking public servants with the retirement benefits they rightfully deserve. It seeks to eliminate the WEP/ GPO, ensuring that individuals like me, who have paid into both Social Security and their pension systems, receive fair treatment and financial security in our golden years.\n\nSandy Uffman, Littleton"
