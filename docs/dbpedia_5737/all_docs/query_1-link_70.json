He made a living as a hard working, blue-collar man, driving a truck and delivering heavy loads of milk and other dairy products. He worked long shifts, starting very early in the morning and finishing well into the late afternoon. It was back breaking work and he came home exhausted. Yet, no matter how tired he was, no matter how frustrating his day might have been, my Dad greeted his family with warm hugs and kisses. Dinner almost immediately followed his arrival. Sitting around the kitchen table my brothers and sisters and I would sit and listen in amazement as he would recall in minute detail the many funny and interesting stories that occurred throughout his day. How exciting he made delivering milk sound! Thinking back, I know now it wasn't just his stories that I liked. It was the fact that my sad was sharing with us; letting us in on the adventures that happened to him while he was away from us. It made me feel so important to him. I loved that about him. I loved that he would ignore his fatigue and give to his family the attention and love we all needed.

He told the LA Times, \"I believe there's no reason you can't do a morning show in the afternoon.\" In October 1991, Matt's contract was not renewed due to \"philosophical differences.\" Matt contended that the station cut him to cut costs. He told the Times that he had been seeking a raise of no more than 2%, of his rumored salary in the $500,000-a-year range. Matt kept his home in the hills of Encino when he went to KKLQ-San Diego and WYXR-Philadelphia. He said over lunch at the Magic Castle, \"I will always consider Los Angeles my love.\" Speaking of another kind of love, a flight attendant from American Airlines attended one of his performances at the Magic Castle and performed her own magic, resulting in marriage in 1993. The former VH1 and MTV jock has been working with the owner of the Magic Castle, Milt Larsen, on a tv show.\n\nALAN, \"Radio Rick\": KWIZ, 1982-89; KWDJ, 1983-84; KQLH, 1991-92; KOLA, 1994-2012. Rick had been working part-time at KOLA in the Inland Empire until late 2013.\n\n\"My mentor in college radio was a man named Jim Bain. He's pretty well-known among those who came up in So. Cal radio in the 60's and 70's. Great teacher, believed in me when few others did. It was his first year teaching at FJC and the only reason I landed at FJC the same time as Jim was because I spent 5 years after high school kind of knocking around in college and not very focused until I just decided to go for my radio dream. Not only did he give me a great radio foundation, he also was responsible for me getting my first paid gig - a union shop in Southern California. Yah, believe me,I knew how lucky this green kid was. But here is the real kicker: In the Fall of 1968, I was riding in my step moms car. It was afternoon drive and the jock on the radio was on fire. I said to myself, 'what a great job that would be\" (which led to the aforementioned lecture at the dining room table later that night). Anyway, years later we figured out that the guy on the radio that day, that this 11 year old kid was so impressed with, was Jim Bain.\"\n\nRick is now director of Publications/Graphics & Branding Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona.\n\nAlbert, Lee: KROQ, 1985-90.

Mitch first gained notoriety as a sports columnist for 12 years for the Detroit Free Press, where he was named the #1 sports columnist for 12 years by the Sports Editors of America, an honor never won by any other journalist more than once. His first love is music, which explains his affection for live bands in his studio during The Mitch Albom Show. Mitch, an accomplished pianist and composer whose music has been recorded and featured in a number of network tv films, still performs on occasion.\n\nHe graduated from Brandeis University and earned a Master of Science degree from Columbia University School of Journalism and an MBA from Columbia University School of Business.

Eventually he became general manager of several stations in San Diego. Dex made one of those rare journeys from dj to station owner.\n\nBorn Claude Turner in Ventura, Dex graduated from John Burroughs High School in Burbank and the University of Denver. His career can almost be broken down into decades. During the '60s Dex was a dj at KBLA, KTLN-Denver, KQV-Pittsburgh, KOL-Seattle, and KCBQ-San Diego.

Allen was born and raised in Lubbock, Texas. In 1961, she married artist and singer Terry Allen and moved to the Southland where she walked away from a BFA degree from the Woodbury College of Design over a disputed sixty dollar fee.\n\nIn the 1970s, she was one of the first performance artists appearing in alternative spaces, cafes, art galleries and museums. She is best known, however, for her work in film and for her one-woman plays which she has toured extensively including off-Broadway productions written and performed by Allen of A Moment's Hesitation, As It Is in Texas, and Counter Angel.\n\nJo Harvey and her husband Terry live in Santa Fe and a small town in Texas.\n\nAllen, Keith: KTWV, 1991-97. Keith is retired and living in Lake Tahoe.\n\nShe looks back fondly on the national attention she and her former-husband received in People magazine and on Good Morning America.The media was fascinated with the fact that the husband/wife team were on competing radio stations - occasionally in the same time slot.\n\n\"We had our own careers plus each other’s to consider and with all our moving around it put a professional strain on us, but it had some fun advantages, too.\" Since 1987 Laurie has hosted a \"classic rock\" show on Armed Forces Radio. One of her career highlights was an AFRTS Tour of Europe in 1992.\"I feel privileged to have been a part of thechanges for women while working on some very high-profile stations.\"\n\nFor 11 years, Laurie worked at the Bright AC format at Dial-Global (Westwood One Radio Networks) until late 2008.

He was 75.\n\nBorn Perry Gerstein in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, Perry attended Denver University on a broadcasting scholarship and arrived at KRLA from an enormously successful stint on Buffalo powerhouse, WKBW. He was almost one of the original \"11-10 Men.\" Perry arrived two months into the new format in November 1959. KRLA ran a contest to \"locate Perry Allen\" with a $50,000 prize. KFWB knew that Perry hadn't left WKBW yet and dispatched newsman Charlie Arlington to Buffalo where he \"found Perry Allen\" and KRLA had to pay their crosstown rivals $50,000.\n\nWhile he was working at KTLK-Denver, Perry hosted a children's program. \"I brushed immortality by throwing up on camera.\"\n\nHe stayed with KRLA until 1960 when there was a legendary switch of morning men with Wink Martindale, who did morning drive at KHJ. Perry worked the talk format on KFI and hosted a KHJ/Channel 9 kid's show called Cartoonsville. He went to KCBQ-San Diego in 1979, then returned to KFI. If you were in San Diego in the 1970s and early 1980s, you should remember Perry Allen as one of the funniest, smartest, wittiest disc jockeys ever heard on local radio. First on KDEO in El Cajon, and later on KFMB, KSDO, KCBQ and KOGO, Allen entertained listeners with his infectiously irreverent spirit, off-the-cuff quips and bizarre stunts.\n\nThrough the 1950s and 1960s, Allen was on both KHJ radio and television. He also wrote scripts for The Danny Thomas Show and McHale's Navy. \"They were truly awful,\" he said. He also wrote sketches for Laugh-In and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. \"I also hosted a terrible kids cartoon show on Channel 9 that my own kid wouldn't watch,\" Allen said. Once, he recalled, he \"told the kids to go down to Dad's workshop and get a hammer and nail, and nail the dial in position\" so the channel couldn't be changed. \"We got numerous protests, and I got off the show. There was a lot of anger in the air. Those people get so sensitive.\" Fired from KHJ, Allen went to San Diego and then worked stints in Seattle, and Denver. Allen also set up his own company producing radio and television commercials. Allen made so many moves over so many years, their precise sequence eludes him today. \"My resume,\" he once said, \"was written on change-of-address cards.”\n\nAllen recounted his firing from KFI. “I was summoned into the office of the sales manager. He directed me out of his office and away from that facility. Painfully I schlepped down the hall toward my now ex-office to purge my desk of whatever remained to be exorcised. On my junket, the station manager stopped me just long enough to smile brightly and to solidly quip, ‘Perry, you're sounding better than ever and I want to thank you for being with the station.’ There must be something profound about irony in this saga. But, I doubt it.\"\n\nMany skits and gags he originated in his early television days have been copied and repeated by the current generation of late-night television talk-show hosts. His PBS program Meeting of the Minds offered imagined conversations between such figures as Darwin, Galileo and Attila the Hun with Mr. Allen as moderator. He was keenly interested in social justice, often writing on the subject, and in recent years became an activist against what he saw as a rising tide of smut on television, condemning shows he felt had, “taken television to the garbage dump.”\n\nSteve died October 30, 2000, following injuries he received in a traffic accident. He was 78.\n\nAllen, Terry: KPPC. Terry is a professional storyteller/songwriter and author, living in the Southwest.\n\nALLEN, Whitney: KQLZ, 1989-91; KIIS, 1991-94; KMLT, 1998-2004; KZLA, 2003-06; KKGO, 2007. Whitney worked afternoons at Country KZLA until a format flip in late summer of 2006. She worked afternoons at Country 540 and 1260. In the summer of 2022, Whitney was inducted into the Country Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were 5? And really…what kid actually gets to be the astronaut, rockstar, explorer, or radio host?!? Whitney Allen, that’s who! Her parents bought her a red transistor radio (that she slept with under her pillow every night) and adopted her first cat, Thomasina (who slept with her every night.) That’s when she knew, it was radio or animals. Since she was better at talking than biology, she knew she was going to be on the radio.\n\nSo at the age of 5, she set out to make it BIG. Before her first radio gig, Whitney heard a dj who sounded like a woman that wanted to steal your boyfriend. If Whitney was going to be a dj, that was not the sound she was going for. KATA in Eureka was the first station to give her a shot on the air. There, Whitney spent 2 years in place of that exact girl that wanted to “steal your boyfriend.” When she had enough of the northern California rain, Whitney headed south to San Diego.\n\nIn 1989, Whitney was part of the launch of Scott Shannon's Pirate Radio (KQLZ). Then KIIS/fm for 3 years where she hosted nights, middays, filled in and even co-hosted some mornings with the legendary Rick Dees.\n\nBlair Garner who worked at KIIS with Whitney, left to start his syndicated show “After Midnite.” He asked Whitney to join him, so she became the host of “After Midnite Weekends with Whitney Allen” for 8 years, on over 200 country stations. She went on to host the syndicated, “The Big Time Saturday Night.”\n\nALLISON, Hank: KFWB, 1968-74. Henry Roger Allison III, better known as Hank Allison, died September 6, 2008, of a blood clot at the age of 64 in Nashville. “After covering the SLA shoot-out, I figured that I didn’t survive Vietnam to be killed on the streets of Los Angeles,” Hank said while being interviewed for Los Angeles Radio People. After the SLA shoot-out he was given a “safe” assignment covering a court hearing, when he ended up in the middle of another shoot-out, this time a domestic quarrel. Hank and his wife bought a farm and moved to Montesano, Washington.\n\nHe went back to school to earn a clinical psychology degree.\n\nBorn in Patterson, New Jersey on October 8, 1943, Hank moved to the Southland with his parents when he was 6. After San Fernando High School and Woodbury College, Hank served two years in the Army with the 1st Cavalry Division. After the service he pursued journalism and became a writer for the South Bay Daily Breeze followed by the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. During the 1968 Examiner strike, Hank was driving his car when he heard that KFWB was going all-News. “I pulled my car over to the curb, called the station and applied for a job.” He started as an editor and moved to outside reporter.\n\n“It was a fascinating time working for a news station. We covered the Manson trial, Bobby Kennedy’s assassination and the Ellsburg trial. KFWB was on top of all of it.” In 1974 Hank moved to Nashville and for the better part of a decade worked for the CBS and ABC stations while attending law school. He graduated from the Nashville School of Law in 1983 and began practicing law in Nashville. “The information gathering, organization and public speaking skills from that first career are brought to bear now as a trial lawyer,” he said.\n\nALLISON, Joe: KXLA, 1952; KRKD, 1957; KFOX, 1960. Joe, a former Country dj, died of a heart attack on August 2, 2002, at the age of 77.\n\nHe was one of the most influential figures in the rise of modern country music. Born October 3, 1924, in McKinney, Texas, he began his career as a disc jockey in 1944 at KPLT-Paris, Texas and went on to become a songwriter, recording and music publishing executive, record producer and tv producer. He moved to Los Angeles in 1952, succeeding Tennessee Ernie Ford on his daily KXLA radio program. While at KRKD, Joe hosted Town Hall Party on KTTV/Channel 11 and ABC’s Country America.\n\nHe and his wife, Audrey, wrote Teenage Crush for Tommy Sands. As the former pd of KFOX, he joined the country music department at Liberty Records in the early 1960s. He was a founder of both the Country Music Association and the Country Music Foundation. He wrote for Jim Reeves’ a huge crossover hit, He’ll Have To Go that topped the country charts for 14 weeks and inspired cover versions by Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Eddy Arnold, and Mills Brothers. In 1976, Joe was elected to the Country Music Disc Jockey Hall of Fame. In a R&R salute to Country, Joe reflected: \"My best memory was having Tex Ritter as my mentor and father figure. He would take the time to show me things and teach me. He taught me to be fair and to give back to the business the things you take out of it. Tex was that way; he was probably the greatest man who was ever in our business. He was the wisest man I ever met. My worst memories are now. The business itself is beginning to forget the people who brought them here.\" He retired from the music business in 1970 and spent his later years buying and selling antiques and paintings, finally retiring in 1988.\n\nAllison, Mike: The former announcer for the Los Angeles Kings hockey on radio is now living in Minnesota and teaching.\n\nAllison, Randi: KRLA, 1983; KRTH, 1983-84; KFI, 1984-87. Randi was a newswoman for KFI. She now writes for tv and films.\n\nALLISON, Steve: KABC, 1967-69. How often does a radio personality make a market move and it gets entered into the Congressional Record? Well, that’s what happened when Steve left WWDC-Washington DC to join KABC in 1967.\n\nHe left WPEN-Philadelphia for DC. After a decade in Washington, ‘the Man Who Owned Midnight’ (as he was known) traveled west to be one of the early Talkers at 790AM. John Conyers entered into the House record on March 13, 1967: “I know that many of my colleagues had the opportunity to appear on Steve’s show. Congressmen were among his favorite guests.”\n\nConyers had high praise for Allison: “The city is not the same without one of its major promoters. I wish Steve much luck in Los Angeles at station KABC. I would like to insert after my remarks several articles which describe Steve’s long career in Washington radio and as a personality in his own right.”\n\nSteve died in 1969, at age 53, of lung cancer.\n\nALLRED, Gloria: KABC, 1993-2002. Gloria left KABC on October 29, 2002. Gloria continues with her high profile law career. In the fall of 2011, she started hosting a new courtroom tv show, We the People.\n\nShe was featured in a 10-page article in a 2017 issue of The New Yorker. Some highlights: \"Gloria Allred may be the most famous practicing attorney in the United States. What she does, as far as the public can see, is show up in front of tv cameras, five feet two, in her black turtleneck, with her gold jewelry and her brightly colored jacket and her clients by her side, and deliver her message with bulldog aplomb. She has a dry sense of humor, which, these days, tends to emerge in a bemused tone or a sly look, and in a general willingness to play herself as a character.\n\n\"Allred's career can be seen as a decades-long project to expand the boundaries of legitimate victimhood. She was born Gloria Rachel Bloom on July 3, 1941, to two doting Jewish parents, Morris and Stella. Stella was English, she and Morris had met in Baltimore, on a streetcar named desire. When Gloria was in junior high, she and her mother would put on American Bandstand and dance around the living room after school.\n\nIn 1960, at nineteen, she married a tall, attractive senior, from a patrician family, named Peyton Bray. In her sophomore year, she got pregnant and gave birth to their daughter, Lisa. Allred writes that Bray left her side while she was in labor and went out for a beer. He committed suicide in 2003. Allred majored in English at Penn, and wrote her undergraduate honors thesis on Ralph Ellison, Alex Haley, and James Baldwin. She graduated as a single mother, flat broke, recently divorced, and undecided about how to make my way in life. By all accounts, Allred refuses to consider retirement. \"You'd have to drag her kicking and screaming out of the office,\" said Lisa Bloom.\n\nAlpert, Dave: Dave is with ABC News.\n\nALSPAUGH, Blanton: KKGO, 1997-98. Blanton left his program director position at KKGO in the summer of 1998.\n\nHe is a multiple Grammy-winning record producer who has received nominations for Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Classical in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, winning in 2013. Blanton has been a member of the Soundmirror team since 1999. He is a senior producer who oversees recording projects ranging in size from the largest operatic and symphonic productions to solo piano.\n\nHe received a B.S. in Music Education from Tennessee Technological University and a M.M. in Orchestral Conducting from the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University.\n\nAlvarez, Arturo: KWKW, 1988-90; KTNQ, 1990-92; KWKW, 1992-98.

Nicole joined all-nights at KROQ in the summer of 2004 and now works middays. Her show is now syndicated into a number of Audacy (formerlyEntercom) markets.\n\nShe is a proud Cuban American born and raised mostly in Miami. Nicole tells her story on the KROQ website: \"To cut to the chase, I am a fiery wild child who has gotten in a fair share of trouble, but somehow I've always managed to get to the other side. I have been a radio baby my entire life. At 11 I told my parents that I would work in radio when I grew up and that was that. I fully committed. I have done most of my growing up at KROQ. I find people and the psychology of behavior fascinating, so I do pride myself on conducting in-depth interviews. It's the scariest part of my job but also my favorite.\n\nI was recently asked to serve on the rock committee for the Grammy's and I fully intend to move the needle in the right direction. My other huge passion is The Suitcase Joe Foundation. I am actively involved with the homeless community, from warehouse work to fully immersing myself in the street culture. My team and I focus on distributions and creating awareness, plus bringing dignity back to the forgotten people of the streets.\n\nI have a little girl. Her name is Evie. I named her after my hero and she set my sails on a better course. I keep her close to the vest. Music, my kiddo, my passport, my family, some whiskey, and the ocean...that's a good life more me. I try to be fearless with my words and will always try to sum up a situation poetically. If you were to ask me what else I want to do in life, I would most likely smile and say, 'live it.' The end.\"\n\nAmador, Andrew: SEE John Clark\n\nAmaya, Pam: KRLA, 1995-99. Pam left radio to go to law school.\n\nAMBROSINI, Michael: KNX, 1980-2006. Michael was a reporter for KNXNewsradio.

Wally \"Famous\" Amos, the cookie creator, is a motivational speaker. He was a semi-regular with Matthew \"Doc\" Frail, mornings on KRLA. He's been an ongoing media happening, a high school dropout, a secretGeorgia, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif school graduate, an Air Force radio and radar repair specialist, a Saks Fifth Avenue executive, a talent representative for the William Morris Agency in New York, a Hollywood show-business personal manager, a cookie magnate, a writer and a muffin maker. Wally has been about anything you can name, but mostly he was just famous. “I never burned my bridges behind me. I got the job at William Morris Agency because of a great letter of recommendation from Saks, even though I quit there because they wouldn't give me even a $5-a-week raise.\"\n\nA few months later he was a talent representative, pulling down $30,000 a year. Amos soon moved to Hollywood and opened a personal management agency. He was a one-man band doing everything that William Morris did, but with a limited clientele. “It didn't last long. The business was just crumbling around me, but everybody loved my cookies. I'd bake up a batch and take 'em to meetings with clients, lawyers, whoever.\n\nThey encouraged me to try the cookie business, and some of them even invested.\" A tasty product and upbeat promotional program built sales to $11 million at its 1982 peak, but Amos \"just lost control\" of his own business. One of the problems, he now realizes, was trying to retail a product with no retail expertise and Amos had to keep selling off bits of his control. Finally, with no equity stake left and unable to get along with the venture capitalists who were calling the shots, \"I just quit.\" His parting from the cookie company became fairly ugly, but in his last book, Man With No Name, he even thanked the lawyers who had obtained a court order prohibiting him from using his own name on any future food product.\n\nIn typical Amos style, he said it turned out to be one of the best favors they could have done him and he began selling cookies, and later muffins, under the brand name Uncle Noname. \"It gave me a story…a lot of people identified with this little guy and his legal problems.” Wally has lived in Hawaii for decades. \"I love it out there in the middle of the Pacific,\" he said.\n\nAnders, Holly: SEE Whitney Allen\n\nANDERSON, Bob: KMPC, 1948-52; KNX, 1957; KPOL, 1958-59; KLAC, 1959-61; KABC, 1961-2007.

He also did stories with Elmer Dills and \"The Food Life\" for Channel 7. His roots are in radio and they laid the foundation for his move into tv.\n\n\"When Eyewitness News was launched, there were many seasoned tv news people who auditioned. Robert Irvine hired ONLY radio people for the first team of Eyewitness News reporters. He believed the tv reporters of that day had developed lazy habits,\" said Fred, when interviewed for Los Angeles Radio People. They usually had all day to think about their story. Radio reporters, however, were used to meeting several deadlines a day, dashing to a phone to report a tight, coherent report and then rushing on to another story.\"\n\nFred was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and caught the radio bug at 15 after a visit to a local station. Two weeks after his 16th birthday he was working part-time at WAAB-Worcester, through high school. He really wanted to be a musician, playing the trumpet and later switching to string bass. He went to Leland Powers School of Theater in Boston and then the New England Conservatory of Music.

Before arriving in the Southland, Fred was nd of WJBW-New Orleans. His first job in L.A. in 1960 was, as Fred recalled, \"A little FM classical music station in the Farmers Market on Fairfax, KFMU. We all lost our jobs when it became one of the first stations to be completely automated.\"\n\nIn the early 1960s Fred was part of the ABC Radio series, \"Weekend West\" which led directly to his being hired by KNX in November of 1963 to take over a half-hour program called \"Kaleidoscope.\" To survive in the early 1960s, he also did engineer work for ABC and was one of the regular engineers for acerbic-tongued Joe Pyne.

The Times said: \"Fred Anderson anchored numerous special reports for KNX over the years, handling every assignment with forcefulness and integrity.\" Three weeks before his death: \"I have many fond memories of radio and its power to be the theater of the mind. I love being in tv...but I do miss radio a lot.\" Fred died June 23, 1996. A week before his death he suffered a heart attack and had triple bypass surgery. Fred had been in critical and unstable condition after the surgery and suffered a fatal heart attack.

After beginning his career at KDYL/TV in Salt Lake City, Howard moved to WFAA/TV in Dallas, and then ABC Films in Chicago and later, New York.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Television came calling, first in New York and then in Los Angeles, followed by the Hughes Television Network, and ultimately the Summa Corporation. Howard made his childhood dream come true in 1980, when he created KHWY/fm, and became the Big Broadcast Baron of Barstow. Beyond his career, Howard cherished his years as a Mission President for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, servi!lg as the President of the California Mission -- including all of Southern California, the State of Arizona, and Clark County, Nevada -- from 1962 to 1965.\n\nHoward loved his sayings: \"It's better to be seen than viewed;\" \"Every day above ground is a good one;\" and \"It doesn't get any better than this.\"\n\nANDERSON-POWELL, Lynn: KHJ, 1979; KIIS, 1980-89.

To everyone’s surprise, including mine, I have been totally clean and sober since leaving Hazelden Center in Minnesota after six weeks of treatment. Over many years, I have owned a couple of ad agencies and a marketing consulting firm. I also have published a couple of textbooks on marketing [The Handbook of Successful Marketing for the Professions] and done hundreds of seminars on the topic. I taught Marketing at the University of Tennessee. I retired from air work in 1993. I had been among the pioneers in the South to do a talk show, which I did for about ten years at a number of stations in Knoxville. At the same time, I was doing a highly controversial news commentary at several stations.” When interviewed recently he said his sole occupation/avocation those days was writing – for publication – and songs for his daughter who sings country soul and lives in Santa Rosa, California. “Unfortunately, that's about all I can do – I suffer from heart failure, prostate cancer and diabetes.

Suzanne left the Washington, DC Classic Rock station in September 2011 following a format flip. She's now an AE at K-EARTH.\n\nFollowing a management change in the mid-1980s, Suzanne found herself in Miami without a job. Instead of sending out tapes, she hopped on a plane and went skiing in Europe for a month and a half. The attractive, free-spirited single woman took off over the weekend on a Travels With Charley-type John Steinbeck trip around the United States. How long? Suzanne doesn’t know.\n\nSuzanne grew up in Pennsylvania where her father was in the flower business. She went to East Stroudsburg State College (now university). She got her first radio job because her father used to advertise on radio in Wilkes-Barre. “My dad met one of the program directors, Rich Piombino, and asked him to interview his daughter. I went in to see him and he asked for an aircheck. ‘What’s that?’ I asked. Rich introduced me to the production guy, gave me some liner notes and I cut an aircheck. Later that day I took a job as the diving coach at my former high school. I was a diver all through school.”\n\nRich didn’t have a job for Suzanne. He didn’t think she was ready yet but encouraged her to hang out at the radio station. He told her she had a nice voice. “He told me to practice in the production room when it wasn’t being used and when I was ready, he would put me on the air. It wasn’t like I had to make a bunch of money all of a sudden. I was 22 years old and living at home.”\n\nShe worked in Tampa for two and a half years and then got a call from Rad Messick, a pd in Orlando. “He was one of my favorite program directors. I had a blast in Orlando and had many cool girlfriends,” enthused Suzanne as she ordered a French Dip sandwich from the Rancho Golf Course restaurant where we were meeting before she hit a bucket of balls. A competing pd in Orlando also was in charge of a station in Miami. “Gerry Cagle wanted me out of the Orlando market and offered me a job in south Florida. I took it and six months later they fired Gerry and the new pd wanted to bring in all his friends.”\n\nSuzanne went to the owner of the Miami station and explained that she left a very secure job in Orlando and didn’t think it was fair to be booted after a half year. He agreed and immediately wrote out a check. On a visit to L.A. before she left Orlando, Suzanne applied to be a contestant on the Wheel of Fortune. “I’m a real game show junkie,” admitted Suzanne. The timing was right because the popular syndicated program had recently abandoned the studio filled with wonderful prizes and went to a cash-only payout for the winners. Suzanne won $13,950.\n\nSuzanne went overseas to ski. She booked a room for a week in Chamonix, France and from there just “winged it.” She went on to St. Moritz where she met an American stationed in Germany. They spent some time together in Paris. “And then I went on to London because I had money to do my thing,” said Suzanne.\n\nShe briefly went to work for the music trade publication, the Hand Report. “He loved how I sounded on the phone, but within a day there was no way I was going to sit at a desk all day and talk with music directors about what they think of the new INXS record.” She got job offers in Phoenix (too hot) and Cleveland where she joined WNCX, a competitor to the legendary Buzzard, WMMS. Turned out the pd at WMMS was her first boss, Rich Piombino. “He was so kind to send me tickets to concerts they were sponsoring. I got to play lots of golf, and go to Browns football games.”\n\nOne day Suzanne received a message from the 213 area code. She had been attempting to establish relationships with the record companies in California to get new music. She didn’t recognize the name Steve Ellis, but called anyway. “When the receptionist answered, she said ‘KLSX.’ Ellis said he was looking for a female rock jock for his Classic Rock station. He flew me out and I did an on-air interview. The guy who recommended me was Dave Hamilton, one of the top guys for ABC Radio. He had been a pd at the very successful WQRS-Minneapolis.” She didn’t know Hamilton but later learned how it all came together. When Suzanne went on the Wheel of Fortune, she put a package together with a resume, tape and a photo. “I had a big, white envelope made up with big red lettering across the front, “See me on Wheel of Fortune on such and such a day.” She sent the package to program directors all over the country and Hamilton was impressed. Ellis and Hamilton grew up together. When the opening at KLSX came, Hamilton recommended Ansilio to Ellis. “The package was a very successful marketing ploy.\n\nTrip Reeb was programming a station in San Diego and he remembered the package.” At KLSX, Suzanne changed names one more time – Suzy Who – which was her favorite name. Before long, Ellis was leaving and Andy Bloom was coming into KLSX. “Andy was a consultant for stations I worked for in the past. He always had nice things to say to me and about me, so I wasn’t too concerned about him coming in.”\n\nBefore long Suzanne heard that he wanted to bring in Shana, a name that Bloom felt had more market recognition. Suzanne was out. But not for long. She called her buddy Cary Curelop who has now pd at KLOS. They went to lunch and Cary told Suzanne that he and Bob Moore were headed for Pirate Radio (KQLZ, 100.3/fm) and she was part of their plans. “Unbeknownst to me, before I got fired they had already decided to take me to Pirate,” said Suzanne. “The change happened really fast with Scott Shannon leaving and Curelop taking over.” Suzanne was at Pirate from 1989 to 1991. The relationship came to an end on a holiday weekend. Suzanne was frustrated when her replacement didn’t show up. “I played my favorite new song, You’re Invited but Your Friend Can’t Come, the first song from Vince Neil after he left Motley Crue, 25 times in a row. The building was empty except for Jay Resnick [who still works for Westwood One] and he kept saying, ‘Do it, man, do it.’ He gave me tons of encouragement. If I had taken a second to think about that decision to play one song for an hour and half, I probably would not have done something like that. I just did it!”\n\nLater that night Bob Moore called and told her to come to his office on Tuesday. “I stopped in Cary’s office and he said that Bob wasn’t ready for me yet and to come back in an hour. When I returned Cary said that he couldn’t save my job. He also told me that he just resigned from Pirate.” Turned out the Curelop was headed back to KLOS and he hired Suzanne for her 13-year run at the Classic Rock station that came to an end when Joe Benson was hired. “I had a good long run at KLOS. The move didn’t surprise me. Nothing shocks me about this business. I have a lot of good memories.”\n\nANSON, Bill: KFWB. Born in Chicago in 1908, he was discovered by Paul Whiteman.

It took years of moving to bigger and bigger cities to condition me for when the opportunity came to program one of Southern California’s strongest signals,” he emailed.\n\nThe intimidation factor had vanished, but he discovered a new personal challenge. “Coaching on-air talent that had already achieved true greatness by the time I was just getting started in radio. What on earth could I possibly teach these guys? Yet looking back, I consider my years in LA to be among my biggest personal successes because of what those professionals taught me while I thought I might have been teaching them. No question, I was the bigger beneficiary.”\n\nBroadcast management soon beckoned, and Dave became a very successful program director for companies like CBS, Metromedia, and Doubleday in cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Denver, Las Vegas, Jacksonville, and Tucson. Broadcast consulting quickly followed, with clients across the U.S. and internationally. Providing voiceovers for commercials and corporate videos was a natural extension of his radio career and has been a fulltime occupation for years.\n\nANTHONY, Ken: KLOS, 1991-92; KLSX, 1994; KLOS, 2015-19.

In 1975 Don started Anti/Muscolo Promotions. Five years later he joined Feedback Magazine and then became an independent record promoter.\n\n“In 1985 I joined Jeff McClusky in a partnership.” Don had been recovering and making nice rehabilitative progress following a series of strokes that sidelined him for a time.\n\nAntoinette, Karla: SEE Karla with a K\n\nBorn in Wilmington, Delaware, and raised in Southern California, Terry began her career in journalism at the age of eight with a byline in the Pasadena Star-News. Terry was one of the youngest women to gain a solo anchor position when, at age 23, she headed a newscast at WCHS/TV in Charleston, West Virginia.\n\nOne of Terry’s greatest accomplishments was co-hosting In Depth Coast to Coast from 1994 to 1996 on America’s Talking, the NBC-owned national cable network. Terry traveled to Poland while it was under martial law to document the delivery of humanitarian aid. Sidestepping the threat of riots, bombs and tear gas, she interviewed Lech Walesa while he was still under house arrest.

Nestor left Sporting News 1540AM in late 2001 and he retired from daily radio in 2004 to concentrate on running WNST-Baltimore, which he owns and operates as Nasty 1570 Sports.\n\nBorn October 14, 1968, in Dundalk, Maryland, he's best known by the nickname 'Nasty Nestor.' He is Venezuelan-American, and the first cousin, once removed of former MLB shortstop Luis Aparicio, as his father is a first cousin of Luis Aparicio. Nestor began as a sports writer at The Baltimore Sun where he continued as a sportswriter and music critic from 1986 until 1992. Starting in 1992 at WITH-AM 1230, Aparicio began doing daily sports talk radio both in Baltimore and later for three years at Sporting News Radio in national-syndication with 425 markets, including KMPC-Los Angeles.\n\nApplegate, Bobby: KPPC, 1971-72. Bobby is the father of Christina Applegate. He lives in Grover City.\n\nArbogast was born on April Fool’s Day, 1927 in Bellingham, Washington. Bob was the only child of Lewis, a champion tennis player and veteran of two World Wars and Christine, also a champion tennis player, both of whom preceded him in death.\n\nBob attended John Marshall High School, where he was an accomplished tennis player. He graduated in 1944. He enlisted in the navy and was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for his work during a multi-ship raid on Tokyo Harbor. When the war ended he attended Los Angeles City College, then the University of Arizona.\n\nWhile attending the University of Arizona on a tennis scholarship, he studied broadcast journalism. As part of a class assignment, he broadcast the noon news over the campus P.A. system. “I could see out the window that no one was paying attention to the news so I began broadcasting outlandish stories.” It was the beginning of a new career. His efforts led to an offer to do a comedy show on a local station.\n\nA big break came when the owner of WHB-Kansas City, Charles R. Cook, had a summer home in Tucson. In 1950 while vacationing, Cook was listening and was so impressed with Bob’s comedy that Bob was soon headed for Kansas City. Bob later went on to Chicago’s WMAQ.\n\nBob then turned to writing, one featuring Tom Poston, the other Peter Marshall. It was on to San Francisco where Bob worked with Stan Bohrman on KSFO and KFRC, before finally landing – many stations later – in Los Angeles. While in the middle of a show with Stan, the pd asked Bob to come into the hallway. “He fired me and it was my birthday. I must have offended him,” remembered Bob when being interviewed for Los Angeles Radio People.\n\nAt KMPC, he wrote for Dick Whittinghill and Gary Owens. Bob moved up the dial to KLAC, where he partnered with Jack Margolis. Despite high ratings, their objection to the Vietnam War and their pro-choice stance resulted in both being fired. The pair also hosted a television show called To Be Announced on KTTV/Channel 11.\n\nThere were a number of popular characters created by Bob. One of his most popular characters was that of little old lady Emily Norton for KMPC. Earlier, Arbogast created the “Question Man” in Kansas City in 1951. It was used by Poston in New York and eventually by Steve Allen, who credited Bob with the idea in his book The Question Man. The concept – divulging the answer before the question was offered – lived on with Johnny Carson for ‘Carnac the Magnificent’ and is still used today on the tv show Jeopardy.\n\nIn 1958, Arbogast teamed with Stanley Ralph Ross to write and perform a hit 45-rpm single Chaos Pt. 1 & 2, which was banned from play on many radio stations for satirizing the Top 40 formats of the day. George Carlin later used some of the material in his parody of the same sort of radio stations. In addition, Arbogast and Ross co-wrote an album of parody songs titled My Son, the Copycat, a play on Allan Sherman’s My Son the Folksinger.\n\n“By 1969 I decided to leave radio for an even more insecure career in commercials and cartoon voice work,” said Arbogast when he was reviewing his career in the 90s. He was one of the first writers for Sesame Street and received substantial residuals for his voice work. Bob voiced 100 episodes of Roger Ramjet and hundreds of cartoons. “In 1994 I received a residual check for 2 cents for my earlier work on Jetsons. From 40 cartoon shows I received a total of $25 in residuals.” He was the original voice for the ‘What would you do for a Klondike Bar?’ commercials. Still, among Bob’s hundreds of voices, he is probably best known for those on the Roger Ramjet cartoon series.\n\nBob won several awards, including an Emmy as writer for Stars of Jazz in 1958 and a Clio in the 1970s. He also wrote for the Pat Paulsen Show and has the distinction of being a writer for the tv show Turn On, which for many years held the dubious distinction of being the shortest-lived tv show – it was cancelled after one night. Bob also appeared in the movie The Falcon and the Snowman and drove the bus in Linda Lovelace for President.\n\nIn 1992 Bob and his wife packed up for Mariposa and they worked and lived on a 5-acre ranch. “I’m pretty good with a tractor. I’m a city boy who has adjusted to the country quite nicely. Our area is made up of either six-toed hillbillies or those who are sophisticated and funny. We haven’t had a murder in our county for two years.”\n\nBob was a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan and has left them a World Series championship in his will. He was also a fan of the UCLA Bruins.\n\nARBOGAST, Pete: KGIL; KFOX; KNX, 1983-95; KDAY, 1984-85; KFI, 1985-86; KHJ/KRTH, 1986-87; KNX, 1984-95; KFWB, 1997; KMPC (1540), 2001-06; KSPN, 2006-19; KABC, 2019-20. Pete is the play-by-play announcer for the USC Trojans.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Pete was the voice of the Cincinnati Bengals. Then the Bengals switched radio outlets and the new station had their own guy. Pete takes it from there: “In early 2001, I felt pretty low, and was trying to find a new direction. Maybe teaching, or coaching full time, even considered being a postal carrier. Then, Brian Kennedy called out of the blue and asked if I might be interested in coming back home to be the voice of the Trojans again. “So we drove across country, landing back in So Cal in early August of ’01. On August 14, 2001 I began a long stay at 1540 KMPC in Santa Monica.\"\n\n\"Our first show was in studios barely finished on a Tuesday night doing USC Insider. Outside the studio a party was going on to welcome the new station into the world. Nancy Cole was the gm, and I have only worked for one or two others in my entire career whom I can say was as good a boss as ever there was to work for. Kurt Kretzchmar, a big Bruin, was the pd, but was very supportive of USC during his tenure there. We picked up Fred Roggin for his radio show very early on. Good guy, funny guy. Although, no one wrote down in their ratings books that they were listening, we figured with USC on board, how could we not get into the book eventually. The signal was so bad you couldn’t hear it in Santa Monica! They tried and tried to fix it, but there’s only so much that can be done with FCC restrictions on such things.\"\n\nARCHER: KQLZ, 1989. Archer is now doing copywriting, voiceovers and production.\n\nARCHER, Robert: KBIG, 1999-2006; KFI, 2007-15; KNX, 2015-23. Archer left KFI News in April 2015 and later joined KNX News.\n\nArcher was born November 2, 1963, in Belle Glade, Florida. “When I was 16, my dad announced it was time for me to learn the value of money, so he started charging me rent. I lined up two jobs: one at the drug store, and one at the local Country station, WSWN/fm. I took the radio job so I wouldn't have to work in a stock room loading heavy boxes. Within a few months I was doing afternoon drive, after school. Eventually I performed every job at the station, except engineer and salesperson. When I left in 1985, I was the pd and morning host.”\n\nHe moved on to WSTU-Stuart, Florida for afternoons/md, ending up doing mornings. “I was hired away by Adult Contemporary WSTF in Orlando in 1988. In 1993, the station changed format to Alternative Rock WJRR, where they kept me on as afternoon driver. I was hired by heritage rocker WSHE-Miami right in the middle of a format/identity change there, once again for afternoons. The station became Modern A/C WPLL in 1996. I was elevated to apd and had the most fun of my career. In 1999, I re-located to Los Angeles to be with my fiancée, budding actress Lauren Nissi. We packed up the Jeep and drove to L.A. with no jobs, no home and no money. But the Gods of Radio took pity on me and I landed a spot on KBIG, and the rest, as they say, is history.”\n\nARCHERD, Army: KABC, 1972. Army spent most of a half-century in show business, most of it at Daily Variety. The former talk show host at KABC in the early 1970s died September 8, 2009, at age 87. According to Variety’s Web site, Archer died of a rare form of mesothelioma, “a cancer thought to be the result of his exposure to asbestos in the Navy during WWII.”\n\nArmy introduced the stars on their arrival at the Academy Awards for 30 years. Army’s Star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame is in front of the Chinese theater, where he emceed dozens of movie premieres.

He graduated from UCLA at age 19 and started work in the mail room at Paramount Pictures. A few months later when World War II was declared, Army joined the Navy. After the war, Army and Bob Thomas opened the AP bureau at the Hollywood Citizen News. Army covered Hollywood. His first local tv show in the ’50s was Heart of Hollywood on KNXT/Channel 2. He talked about the tv show: “I’d call up Bob Hope and Bing Crosby and say, ‘Come on down and be on my tv show tonight’ – and they’d say, ‘Why not?’ and come on the show.” Over the years Army appeared as himself in over 100 movies and tv shows. He has been honored by every major press group in the Southland. On April 15, 1996, Army was saluted by the Museum of Television and Radio with “An Evening With Army Archerd,” celebrating his showbiz coverage for 50 years. Generations of show business actors and studio heads respected Army because of his integrity, truthfulness and kindness.\n\n(Bill Alexander and Pat Alexander)\n\nARCHULETA, Jr, Alfred: KFWB, 1973; KJOI, 1973-75.

The forty-year veteran of Los Angeles radio and tv died in 1989 at the age of 74, following surgery. He was born September 23, 1905. One of his quiet pass times was repairing grandmother and grandfather clocks in his San Fernando Valley garage. One of his peers said of Charlie: \"He was always meticulously dressed. He wore a shirt, tie and jacket as he popped out of his mobile unit, bullets at his feet! Somewhere in the early 40s he made his name as the feds closed in on an illegal gambling ship off the Southern California coast. With bullets flying Charlie did a live broadcast of the incident and the arrests that followed.\"\n\nCharlie graduated from Syracuse University.

They’ve remained at KSTE while syndicated to many markets, incluing Los Angeles and heard in San Francisco and San Diego.\n\n“When I first heard them years ago, they sounded to me more like the kind of talk show hosts one would expect to hear on a rock station than on a serious news outlet,\" said TALKERS founder Michael Harrison. \"They were funny and irreverent and surrounded with a cast of characters that gave their show more of the feeling of a morning zoo than a round table of stuffy panelists. But even though they were zany and played the goofball roll to a certain degree, their antics were offset by obvious intelligence, keen insight, excellent interviewing skills and a ton of information about what was happening in the news.”\n\nARMSTRONG, Dave: KWIZ, 1981-87; KYMS, 1987-91; KKLA, 1994-2000; KIEV, 1999-2000; KRLA/KFSH/KKLA, 2001-03.

He started his radio career at age 14 at KOSY-Texarkana in 1954. \"They had these new things called 45 rpm records that were replacing 78s and I was hired to create a filing system.\" Less than six months later he had his own show called \"Rockin' with Eddy.\" His first live remote was from the local theater showing Rock Around the Clock.

After two years at KNX, Bob started at KABC in 1969 as a newsman.\n\nBeginning in 1973 and for the next 17 years \"EGBOK\" was Ken Minyard and Bob's catch phrase for \"everything's gonna be OK.\" There was a spontaneous chemistry between the two.
