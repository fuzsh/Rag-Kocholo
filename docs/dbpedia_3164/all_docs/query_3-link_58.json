I currently connect a PC Laptop to Pactor Dragon via Bluetooth and then on to control an ICOM M802. I use Airmail and Winmail. Is there an iOS App for the iPad that will connect through the Bluetooth Pactor and control the radio for email GRIBS etc?\n\nIf the answer is no that is fine but I am not looking for any Windows via Mac or Raspberry Pi options please. After decades of being completely absorbed with computers of all kinds ..loving the simplicity and reliability of the iPad.\n\nEdenRose\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2016\n\nLocation: San Francisco\n\nBoat: Morgan 382\n\nPosts: 3,189\n\nRe: Is there and iOS App that connects iPad to SSB?\n\nNeither Airmail or Winmail work on an iPad. But that doesn't mean the ipad won't work. For Winlink (HAM radio service) it Sortof can. For Sailmail (Maritime radio service), no dice.\n\nFor Winlink, you can't use the Pactor modem, and need to get a \"KISS Packet\" modem with bluetooth. It will be slower than the pactor, but it will work with the winlink system.\n\nThe Sailmail system only works with the Pactor, so because the ipad won't work with pactor it won't work with the Sailmail system.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/radiomail/id1613839993\n\nEdit: If the developers of the above software added support for pactor modems, they would gain many more potential customers in the sailing community. Maybe if you ask them they will work on adding it.\n\n__________________\n\n-Warren\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2020\n\nPosts: 106\n\nRe: Is there and iOS App that connects iPad to SSB?\n\nThank you for the direction.

The connectivity from the iPad to said audio interface will have to be researched. It may or may not work.\n\nThen, the audio interface will be connected to the SSB by means of whatever connections are required.\n\nBut, instead of using an iPad, you might want to think about a used Windows Based tablet. Will that tablet run Winlink? I don't know. An addition to Winlink is a software called Vara HF, which has a faster data transfer than Winlink, but uses Winlink as it's medium vehicle. Probably not as fast as Pactor() though.\n\nJust some thoughts and as always, JMHO.\n\n__________________\n\nBrian D\n\nKF6BL\n\nS/V Takara\n\nMarine Service Provider\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2013\n\nLocation: Kimberton,Pa.\n\nBoat: Cabo Rico 34\n\nPosts: 1,055\n\nRe: Is there and iOS App that connects iPad to SSB?\n\nFrom the Winlink News..\n\nAnnouncing RadioMail for iOS\n\nWe are excited to announce the release of RadioMail, a new client app for the iPhone by Island Magic Co. of Kaua'i, Hawaii. With RadioMail, you can easily send and receive Winlink emails via telnet or pair with modems to exchange emails over the air.\n\nTo use RadioMail with your radio, you will need to connect an external TNC interface. You can do this through WiFi or Bluetooth, using a VARA modem or KISS packet modem. Radio control can be setup through rigctld if necessary. Note that RadioMail requires a running version of the VARA modem on a separate computer. For packet mode, the Mobilinkd and Dire Wolf packet modems are supported.\n\nThe built-in station directory automatically retrieves available station details and organizes them by proximity based on your current location. You can also add custom stations for peer-to-peer connections (outbound only). The favorites list is where you manage the preferred stations you want to connect to. Favorites stations can quickly be selected by modes and bands when youre ready to initiate a connection.\n\nThe app makes it easy to share images and files. You can access your phone's camera directly, or attach photos from your photo library. RadioMail automatically optimizes images to reduce the transmission time. When you receive an attachment, you can preview it and add annotations if you like. You can also save attachments to local folders or iCloud, or share them via other apps.\n\nRadioMail can also check for new emails in the background at regular intervals, and notify you when a new message comes in. This way, you won't miss important emails even when you're not actively using the app. Additionally, you can use the phone's internal GPS to automatically provide an accurate location for position reports, which are posted to the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) network.\n\nTo learn more visit RadioMail or download the app from the App Store. You can also refer to the web site https://radiomail.app/ for a description of features. See a comparison of all Winlink client programs."
