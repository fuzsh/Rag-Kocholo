        "text": "Having a strange issue at home and don't know if it's related to my iPad or my RBR50.\n\nI own an iPad 8, my wife a 7 and daughter an old Air 2.\n\nAll three iPads are always at home, connected to the RBR50 (and two satellites)\n\nMy 8 sometimes looses connection. Wifi symbol is active and has full reception, but there's no internet connection.\n\nSwitching to Airplane mode and back solves the issue for a few days.\n\nAlready did a complete system wipe, let everything standaard. After one week the same issue.\n\nNot my wife, nor my daughter have the same issue with their iPads.\n\nRouter is setup as accespoint to my ISP, Telenet Belgium.\n\nIs this a known problem, with the RBR50?\n\nthanks\n\nGert\n\nI indeed switched on the data counter on the RBR. I wasn't aware about the issue around it and it gave me a crazy problem.\n\nI think this topic can be closed. I bought a new iPad Air 2022 and for the time being, this device doesn't gives problems.\n\nIn the future I think the old iPad will be used as a central homekit control panel and will be continuously on the charger.\n\nIn the mean time, Apple released iPadOS16.4.1. I read somewhere on reddit this could solve some connection issues. Further experiments are necessary.\n\nBe sure that any WiFi Private IP address is disabled on Apple mobile devices if present:\n\nhttps://community.netgear.com/t5/Orbi-App/NETGEAR-Mobile-Applications-and-Apple-Devices-FAQ/td-p/222...\n\nDoesn't need to be enabled while at home.\n\nIf other Apple devices are working and the one particular one isn't, maybe something with the device rather than Orbi. Would be something to contact Apple about.\n\nWhat channels are you using? Auto? Try setting manual channel 1, 6 or 11 on 2.4Ghz and 40 to 48 channel on 5Ghz.\n\nAny Wifi Neighbors near by? If so, how many?\n\nHow many RBS are deployed?\n\nWhat is the size of your home? Sq Ft?\n\nWhat is the distance between the router and satellite(s)? 30 feet or more is recommended in between RBR and RBS ️ to begin with depending upon building materials when wirelessly connected.\n\nTry disabling the following and see:\n\nArmor, Smart Parental Controls or Circle, Traffic Meter.\n\nOne User Experience/Configuration:\n\nhttps://community.netgear.com/t5/Orbi/Most-Stable-Orbi-Configuration/m-p/1941087/highlight/true#M970...\n\nHas a power off for 1 minute then back ON with the ISP modem and router been performed since last update?\n\nBe sure to restart your network in this sequence:\n\nTurn off and unplug modem.\n\nTurn off router and computers.\n\nPlug in and turn on modem. Wait 2 minutes for it to connect.\n\nTurn on the router and wait 2 minutes for it to connect.\n\nTurn on computers and rest of network.\n\nWhat Firmware version is currently loaded?\n\nWhat is the Mfr and model# of the Internet Service Providers modem/ONT the NG router is connected too?\n\nBe sure your using a good quality LAN cable between the modem and router. CAT6 is recommended.\n\nWow, a lot of possible tips...\n\nI asked it to Apple and Apple communities before I posted here. They also gave me the clue to turn off the private network option. I also did this, but it didn't work. After that, I did the complete wipe of the tablet, but the \"private\" function was enabled again. So this is disabled now.\n\nNo free time to check all those things now. Will be something for next Sunday. I'll report back later.\n\nthanks so far!\n\nGood, past weekend I had plenty of time to do some experiments and after doing those, I'll try to answer.\n\nFirst things first, after posting my previous post, I connected the iPad to the wifi of my isp modem. No internet loss at all. Another positive point: my iPad's battery life has a huge increase when connecting to the isp modem. Normally the battery is empty after 5-6 days. Now, after one week, it's still on 60%. So the problem is for sure related to the Netgear.\n\nI'll try to answer on the post of 03-14\n\nI did a software upgrade to the last version available here on this forum. Upgraded successful my RBR and two RBS.\n\nDid a factory restore, so the RBR is setup as a router now and not as an accesspoint. Except my login data and Wifi name and password, I let everything by default.\n\nI did this Sunday morning, Monday morning again, battery drain on the iPad and no internet, but still reception.\n\nExcept the wifi signal of the isp modem there's no other wifi signal in my house. Switching off the wifi of the isp doesn't solve it.\n\nChannels are on auto now, before the reset and before my first post, I already tried to switch them. Tried 1 and 11, but no succes. I had 36 on 5GHz.\n\nhouse of 328sq ft. Around 25ft. between the satellites and router. But also a ceiling with ferroconcrete between 2 satellites.\n\nAfter a factory restore of the router, I restarted everything as you advised.\n\nI can try just one thing: place the iPad in a room (cellar) with absolutely no reception of the satellites.\n\nSorry, I did a wrong copy-paste this morning... It must be 1076,4 Square foot. (not that familiar with the US metric. It's 100 square meter)\n\nIt's not possible to turn off the RBS, because the RBR is in the cellar. Only on my office there could be wifi from the RBR. Therefore, I told that I have to move the iPad to the cellar where there's just wifi from RBR. I will put the iPad there tonight and tomorrow. On Thursday, I'll know more.\n\nThe Netgear runs 2.7.5.4.\n\nModem is a Docsis 3.1 modem from Telenet CH8568. I don't know a specific brandname. They are distributed by our Belgian ISP provider Telenet. I know they don't manufacture their own hardware, but I only find the brand \"Telenet\" on the box.\n\nIpad is an iPad 8, running iPadOS 16.3.1.\n\nWifi Private IP has been disabled.\n\nCellar would not be a recommended placement location for any WiFi router. Based on any concrete, steel or rock in the area, would cause problems with wifi signal coverage from this area. The RBR should be on main level floor thats recommended.\n\nThe modem seems to be gateway modem with built in router and wifi as well. This would be a double NAT (two router) condition which isn't recommended. https://kb.netgear.com/30186/What-is-Double-NAT\n\nhttps://kb.netgear.com/30187/How-to-fix-issues-with-Double-NAT\n\nCouple of options,\n\n1. Configure the modem for transparent bridge or modem only mode. Then use the Orbi router in router mode. You'll need to contact the ISP for help and information in regards to the modem being bridged correctly.\n\n2. If you can't bridge the modem, disable ALL wifi radios on the modem, configure the modems DMZ/ExposedHost or IP Pass-Through for the IP address the Orbi router gets from the modem. Then you can use the Orbi router in Router mode.\n\n3. Or disable all wifi radios on the modem and connect the Orbi router to the modem, configure AP mode on the Orbi router. https://kb.netgear.com/31218/How-do-I-configure-my-Orbi-router-to-act-as-an-access-point and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7LOcJ8GdDo&app=desktop\n\nTry option #2 first...\n\nI know about the Cellar, but everything like Coax cable, switches, electricity etc is centralized in my cellar. It's not possible to install the ISP modem somewhere else. The cellar is also my hobby room, so I like to have stable wifi at that location.\n\nBut, the satellites are connected by fixed LAN to the RBR. The two satellites do cover my entire house. Because they're connected by fixed LAN cable to the RBR, there will be no problem, will it?\n\nIt's not possible to bridge a Telenet modem. I can configure the DMZ, this is no problem. But before last Sunday, the RBR was configured as AP and my iPad has exactly the same behavior... Knowing that, is it worth the risk to disable the ISP's firewall by using the DMZ?\n\nYou wouldn't be disabling the Firewall on the modem, just using the DMZ for the RBR in router mode to see of this help with getting the configuration out of a double NAT condition for one thing.\n\nStill seems like if this is the only device having issues and others don't, something could be going on with this one device.\n\nI would also turn OFF one or both RBS and see if the pad can maintain the connection at the RBR alone. Possible the pad maybe ping ponging back and forth between the RBR, and two RBS and not being able to lock on to one signal wifi source connection. Seen this before with other device and having too much wifi signal or too much wifi signal over lap. To troubleshoot this, turn off all but the main RBR and observe behavior, then turn on one RBS then observe again.\n\n@FURRYe38 wrote:\n\nYou wouldn't be disabling the Firewall on the modem, just using the DMZ for the RBR in router mode to see of this help with getting the configuration out of a double NAT condition for one thing.\n\nAllright I will try this also.\n\n@FURRYe38 wrote:\n\nPossible the pad maybe ping ponging back and forth between the RBR, and two RBS and not being able to lock on to one signal wifi source connection.

I discovered the \"guest-network\". I tried to set this up and connect the famous iPad to it.\n\nI connected to the guest network yesterday around 6pm, now, I lost around 3% in 24 hours and watched around 20min YouTube. So I can conclude the issue doesn't happen on the Guest network.\n\nThis implies it has nothing to do with reception, satellites etc.\n\nCoincidence: last night I discovered a nice deal for a Netgear Orbi Pro AX6000. It comes also with a router and two satellites. It's Wifi6, so I decided to upgrade. If it solves the problem, it would be nice, if not, I can send it back and get a refund.\n\nHopefully this AX6000 is a better system as the RBR. Expected by the end of this week.\n\nHello @Beeldbuisje ,\n\nThank you for your post!\n\nI understand that you are having issues with connections between your Orbi network and iOS / IPadOS. This could be due to the privacy feature added to those devices in the recent updates. Please turn off your private IP address if you are using an iOS / iPadOS device.\n\nTo turn off the Private IP address please follow the directions listed below:\n\nOpen \"Settings\"\n\n\"Wi-Fi\"\n\nSelect the \"i\" icon next to your connected network\n\nToggle off \"Private Wi-Fi Address\"\n\nBest,\n\nKevin\n\nCommunity Team\n\n@KevinLiT wrote:\n\nPlease turn off your private IP address if you are using an iOS / iPadOS device.\n\nTo turn off the Private IP address please follow the directions listed below:\n\npfff, this makes no sense.\n\nI'm very happy people trying to help me, but when something already mentioned and answered many posts before, it's not necessary to repeat al those things again and again.\n\nI just wanna know one thing: why should I not place the RBR into the cellar when my satellites are on ground and first floor and hardwired...\n\nI indeed switched on the data counter on the RBR. I wasn't aware about the issue around it and it gave me a crazy problem.\n\nI think this topic can be closed. I bought a new iPad Air 2022 and for the time being, this device doesn't gives problems.\n\nIn the future I think the old iPad will be used as a central homekit control panel and will be continuously on the charger.\n\nIn the mean time, Apple released iPadOS16.4.1.
