        "text": "@cyril777 said:\n\nI precise that I have zero notion concerning routing, networks, bandwidth and stuff like that so please be indulgent with my questions! I always dreamt of having a flawless midi connection between 2 iPads (and I donâ€™t want to buy an iConnect interface). So, after Apollo helped a lot a few years ago and despite the regular optimisation of Bluetooth and the possibilities offered by new apps like MidiFire, I never been satisfied by the quality of wireless communication between my devices. I have a very very good internet connection but using midi over wifi is far from being satisfying. So hereâ€™s the thing I keep asking myself each time I look at the Ethernet port of the new usb hub I bought for my iPad : is it possible to create some kind of network, like you would do usually for a Mac, but just between 2 iPads (now that I can use an Ethernet connection)? Thereâ€™s a pretty good chance my question is ridiculous but one never knows....\n\nThank you\n\n@cyril777 said:\n\n@rs2000 said:\n\nBluetooth MIDI has been the best option here, no need for wired or wireless networks except when using Sonobus ðŸ˜Š\n\nDid you ever try to use a midi sequencer on one iPad connected in Bluetooth to sequence what's running on a second iPad ?\n\nYou loose the synchro almost immediately . It's not obvious like it's offbeat but it's like you add a strong shuffle or a Dj who's constantly adjusting his vinyls... I tried a lot of different setups, very simple configuration and some a lot more \"heavy\", like my favorite couple, the AUM / AB3 combo. I can tell you that the synth loaded in will never stay in line, whatever sequencer you're using on the other device...\n\nWhat kills me is that you've got more and more reasons to work like this, I mean using 2 devices sending/ receiving MIDI to each other. Look at the LK Control app : I do not especially like this app but it's meant to be used in standalone, sending its MIDI to a second iPad ... And even if combining AUM and AB3 in order to facilitate the switching between the apps, nothing is more easy and pleasant to use than running Poly2 or Polyphase while tweaking your synth apps with your controller and don't have to choose between one part or the other. And I dare you to use Gestrument Pro without watching the synths it controls.\n\nBut yes, if it's just to use KB-1 to enter some parts in Gadget running on another device in Bluetooth, it works fine...\n\n@SevenSystems said:\n\nIf at least one of the iPads has a SIM card, you can also enable \"Personal Hotspot\" (or whatever it's called nowadays) on that device, then connect the other iPad to that Hotspot. Boom. Both iPads connected over Wi-Fi without a router.\n\nIT would make me buy another adapter and only my old iPad Air 1 is packed with Cellular ...\n\n@cyril777 said:\n\n@rs2000 said:\n\nBluetooth MIDI has been the best option here, no need for wired or wireless networks except when using Sonobus ðŸ˜Š\n\nDid you ever try to use a midi sequencer on one iPad connected in Bluetooth to sequence what's running on a second iPad ?\n\nYou loose the synchro almost immediately .
