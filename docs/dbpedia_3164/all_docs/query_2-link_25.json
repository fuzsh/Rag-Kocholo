        "text": "Satellite is by far the most widely available type of wireless connection out there. No matter how remote your location is, you can still connect to satellite internet as long as you have a clear view of the southern sky.\n\nSatellite internet also has several downsides. Most satellite plans have very restrictive data limits and high latency. That can make activities like online games and video chat difficult or impossible. Hughesnet has attempted to address the latency issue with its Hughesnet Fusion plans. Hughesnet Fusion combines satellite and terrestrial wireless connections into a single connection. With some additional equipment, it will correctly route your connection over satellite or wireless, giving you low latency when you need it, though other issues associated with satellite internet, such as low speeds and data caps, could still be an issue.\n\nNew developments in low-Earth orbit satellite technology, pioneered by Starlink and OneWeb, could significantly mitigate these problems. Although these new satellite services have a lot of potential, they all—including Starlink—are struggling to scale their operations up to be a reliable, nationwide internet service provider. As a general rule, you shouldn’t rely on satellite internet unless it’s your only option.\n\nOptions for city folk\n\nWireless internet connections are also helpful for people living in urban areas, particularly in those with less competition among internet service providers (ISPs). As 5G service becomes more widespread, going wireless doesn’t necessarily mean settling for slower speeds, either. Wireless connections can save you money on installation fees too, which can still cost a lot, even in the city.\n\nFixed wireless\n\nFixed wireless connections can be good options in the city, just as they are in rural areas. It’s more common in urban and suburban areas than it is farther away from city centers and can often fill in the coverage gaps within a city. That means if you live in the part of town between two major providers’ coverage areas, a fixed wireless provider might give you the speed you’re looking for instead of settling for slower options.\n\n5G home internet uses cellular technology to connect you to the internet, and it has several advantages over the previous generation. It will be up to ten times faster than 4G (and even faster when compared to some 4G LTE connections). 5G will also have incredibly low latency compared to other wireless technologies, making it excellent for online games and video chat. It’s also well-suited to deal with high volumes of traffic that often cause older connections like cable to slow down at peak hours.\n\nThe biggest players in home 5G are mobile wireless companies like Verizon and T-Mobile. These companies are already upgrading their infrastructure for their mobile customers, which will also give them the opportunity to expand their home internet coverage. AT&T also recently launched its own 5G home service, Internet Air, but it’s mostly meant for former DSL customers who can’t get their copper connections anymore.\n\n5G is currently only available in certain cities, but that number is slowly growing. As it becomes more widely available, 5G will become an increasingly attractive alternative to older wired connections.\n\nMore flexible options\n\nWireless internet gives you a lot of options, but some people need even more flexibility. If you travel frequently or live in an RV, you might want to take your internet connection with you.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is simply to use your cell phone as a mobile hotspot. This will allow laptops and other devices to connect to the internet via your phone, using the data on your phone plan. A better long-term option is to buy a dedicated mobile hotspot.\n\nMobile hotspots work similarly to 4G home internet, but they don’t have to stay in one place. You can use them anywhere your plan gets service. The tradeoff is that these plans typically cost much more per month than a similar 4G home internet plan would, so make sure you need the added flexibility before you buy one.\n\nWireless internet FAQ\n\nHow do I get standalone internet?\n\nAlthough many ISPs offer discounted plans when bundling with phone or cable, all of these plans are also available as standalone plans. If you’re currently getting your internet through a 4G or 5G phone plan but you don’t want the phone part, you can switch over to a home internet plan, which uses a Wi-Fi router instead of your phone. If portability is important to you, you could also look into getting a dedicated mobile hotspot.\n\nHow do I get Wi-Fi at home without a cable?\n\nAny wireless internet plan can be used to set up a home Wi-Fi network using a Wi-Fi router. To do this, you simply need to take your Wi-Fi router and connect it to your modem or receiver using an ethernet cable. It’s also important to note that many modems come with a built in Wi-Fi router, so the device you got from your internet provider can probably be used to set up your home Wi-Fi network without purchasing any additional equipment.\n\nTo find out more about what makes a good Wi-Fi router, check out our recommendations for the best Wi-Fi routers.\n\nCan cutting the cord save me money?\n\nCutting the cord and switching to a wireless internet plan can often save you money. This is especially true if your current plan is bundled with other services that you don’t need. Fixed wireless, 4G home internet, and 5G all average around the same price or cheaper than a cable connection.\n\nBefore cutting the cable, make sure that your new plan can give you the speed that you need. Both 4G home internet and fixed wireless are often cheaper than cable, but don’t offer the same speeds. 5G can match or beat cable in almost every way, which makes it a serious competitor to older cable networks.\n\nWhat alternatives are there to cable?\n\nThe best alternatives to cable internet are fiber and 5G. Fiber has faster download speeds than cable and much faster upload speeds. 5G is on par with cable speeds and might soon overtake them. It also has the advantage of being wireless. Both 5G and fiber are better at dealing with high volumes of traffic than cable networks, which means your speeds won’t drop during peak hours.\n\nCan I get satellite internet if I live in a city?\n\nYes, you can get satellite internet even if you live in an urban area with other options, though we suggest choosing another type of connection. Satellite has a lot of downsides. High latency makes video chat and online games difficult, while low data caps make streaming video impractical. It’s also much more expensive compared to other plans with similar speeds.\n\nBecause of these factors, we highly suggest going with another option (including other wireless options) over satellite unless it is your only choice."
