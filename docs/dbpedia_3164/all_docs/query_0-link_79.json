See Apple’s commitment.\n\n* To identify your iPhone model number, see support.apple.com/kb/HT3939. For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see apple.com/iphone/cellular. Cellular technology support is based on iPhone model number and configuration for either CDMA or GSM networks.\n\nAvailable space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 11GB to 14GB of space (including iOS and preinstalled apps) depending on the model and settings. Preinstalled apps use about 4GB, and you can delete these apps and restore them. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version and may vary by device.\n\nSize and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process.\n\niPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes). Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty.\n\nData plan required. 5G, Gigabit LTE, VoLTE, and Wi-Fi calling are available in select markets and through select carriers. Speeds are based on theoretical throughput and vary based on site conditions and carrier. For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see apple.com/iphone/cellular.\n\nUltra Wideband availability varies by region.\n\nFaceTime calling requires a FaceTime‑enabled device for the caller and recipient and a Wi‑Fi connection. Availability over a cellular network depends on carrier policies; data charges may apply.\n\nStandard Dynamic Range video content only.\n\nSiri may not be available in all languages or in all areas, and features may vary by area. Internet access required. Cellular data charges may apply.\n\nAll battery claims depend on network configuration and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced by Apple service provider. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. See apple.com/batteries and apple.com/iphone/battery.html for more information.\n\nWireless chargers sold separately.\n\nTesting conducted by Apple in September 2020 using preproduction iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max units and software and accessory Apple USB‑C Power Adapter (20W Model A2305). Fast‑charge testing conducted with drained iPhone units. Charge time varies with settings and environmental factors; actual results will vary.\n\nUse of eSIM requires a wireless service plan (which may include restrictions on switching service providers and roaming, even after contract expiration). Not all carriers support eSIM. Use of eSIM in iPhone may be disabled when purchased from some carriers. See your carrier for details. To learn more, visit support.apple.com/kb/HT209044.\n\nWireless broadband recommended; fees may apply.\n\nData accurate as of product launch.\n\nApple defines its restrictions on harmful substances, including definitions for what Apple considers to be “free of,” in the Apple Regulated Substances Specification. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates with the exception of AC power cords in India, Thailand (for two-prong AC power cords), and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement."
