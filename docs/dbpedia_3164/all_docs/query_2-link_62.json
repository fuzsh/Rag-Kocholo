        "text": "Once, you needed a desktop computer and dial-up to connect to the internet. Then came mobile phones. Today, certain tablets, including a range of Apple iPads, can connect to mobile services as stand-alone devices.\n\nThis is made possible by iPad eSIM technology, the same embedded SIM that can be found in Apple’s latest SE series and the Google Pixel 4.\n\neSIM has already extended to cars and other electronics, so there is no doubt it is here to stay. The demand for embedded SIM technology is disrupting the mobile telecommunications industry as it’s introducing consumers to a whole new world of flexibility and connectivity at home and abroad.\n\nInfographic: What is an eSIM and How Does it Work?\n\nTech giants like Apple were the first to invest in the technology and it has taken off from there, with most new devices being developed with the revolutionary smart card. Apple first introduced eSIM to its smartwatches, then to its phones, and finally, its iPads.\n\nThis guide covers which iPad devices have an eSIM and how to set it up. It also covers how to choose a data plan and other frequently asked questions about the iPad eSIM.\n\nRead | Tablets with eSIM: Is Your Device Compatible?\n\nDo All iPads Have eSIMs?\n\nNot all of them. The first iPad was released in 2010 and eSIM was first introduced in 2016, so there are ‘old’ and ‘new’ generations of iPads in terms of eSIM technology.\n\nHowever, the iPad eSIM landscape is more confusing because even some of the newer models don’t support eSIM. Apple seems to be selective about which devices are released with an eSIM and which are not.\n\nSee: Which Compatible Devices Support eSIM Service\n\nDoes iPad Pro have an eSIM?\n\nThe Pro was the first range of iPads to support embedded SIM technology.\n\neSIM is currently supported on the iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st and 2nd generation) and iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd and 4th generation). The iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st and 2nd generation), iPad Pro 9.7-inch, and iPad Pro 10.5-inch do not have an eSIM.\n\nDoes iPad 7th Gen have an eSIM?\n\nYes, eSIM is supported on the 7th Generation iPad.\n\nIt also has a slot for an Apple SIM or micro-SIM card from a dedicated service provider. This means you can switch between the physical SIM and the eSIM, which may be one of the reasons it is the most popular iPad on the market right now.\n\nDoes iPad Air have an eSIM?\n\nOnly the 3rd Generation iPad Air has an eSIM. It is cellular-enabled so you also have the option of using the Apple SIM that comes with the device, or a third party nano-SIM.\n\nIf you choose the latter option, you can use the nano-SIM together with the iPad eSIM embedded in the device. Add a data plan to it and it becomes a great tool if you’re always on the go for work and need the flexibility of an eSIM plan.\n\nDoes the iPad Mini support eSIM?\n\nThe 5th Generation iPad Mini has an eSIM, as well as a slot for an Apple or third-party nano-SIM. The SIM card and iPad eSIM can work in parallel to each other, which is ideal if you use your iPad Mini often, at home, work, or while travelling.\n\nThe Air’s small size and the option of adding an eSIM service make it the perfect travel companion.\n\nHow Do I Activate eSIM on My iPad?\n\nYou will need an eSIM mobile plan to use the iPad eSIM.\n\nPlans are available from eSIM providers like eSIM.net. Customers can choose from global roaming plans or data-only plans for specific countries. It all depends on how much data you want to buy, how long you want it to last, and how much you want to pay.\n\nThe plan is purchased online and a QR code is sent to your email so you can activate data services immediately.\n\nAfter you have signed up for service you will need to add your new plan. These 3 steps will guide you through the process of adding a new mobile plan to your iPad eSIM:\n\nNavigate to Settings > Cellular Data > Add a New Plan\n\nScan QR code provided by your eSIM provider and follow the prompts\n\nTap Confirm\n\nFor more advice, visit Apple’s official support site.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Using an eSIM on a Tablet?\n\nWith the option of being able to connect to local networks easily without the need for a physical SIM card, the benefits of the eSIM are undeniable.\n\nThese are the four major benefits of the iPad eSIM:\n\nIf you are travelling abroad and your regular SIM doesn’t work, you can use the eSIM to connect to local networks. By doing this you’ll also pay near-local prices and avoid expensive roaming charges. A global plan allows you to remotely connect to a wide range of local providers wherever you are in the world. You will never be out of touch again or have to rely on Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nYou can easily switch between networks if you need to for any reason, or even if you just find a better plan that suits your needs. The process is simple and can be done entirely remotely using remote provisioning.\n\nMore telecommunications providers are opening their networks to eSIM technology, which means more coverage whether you’re in the UK or Europe.\n\nIf a thief manages to get their hands on your iPad, they will not be able to dispose of the SIM card, so it will be possible to trace and retrieve it.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between an iPad with WiFi and Cellular?\n\nThere are two kinds of iPads: WiFi-only and WiFi + cellular.\n\nThe WiFi-only iPad connects to the internet using wireless access. Because it is the only option for this particular iPad, you will only be able to connect to the internet when you are within range of a WiFi hotspot.\n\nNone of the WiFi-only iPads support eSIM technology.\n\nThe cellular iPad has WiFi and cellular access so you can use it whenever, wherever you want. However, it must be activated with a plan in order to access cellular services. Although the cellular iPad cannot make calls and send text messages, it does connect using data. This means it can support apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, and Skype.\n\nSome cellular iPads are eSIM enabled.\n\nHow do you know if your iPad has cellular capability?\n\nYou can tell if your iPad is cellular by looking at the top of it. Does it have a black or white strip? If it does, it has cellular capabilities. It will also have a SIM slot, like a mobile phone, that you can put a nano-SIM card into.\n\nThese cellular iPads usually come with an Apple SIM.\n\nIf your iPad is eSIM-enabled you can use it without a SIM card. You can also use it anywhere and at any time, taking away the restrictions of a regular SIM.\n\nIs your iPad compatible with eSIM?
