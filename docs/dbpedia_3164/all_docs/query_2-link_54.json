        "text": "Apple broke the mold when they first released the original iPad back in 2010, forever changing how we browse the internet and get things done. Today, Apple's iPad lineup is the broadest it's ever been, offering several versions of the iconic product, from the affordable iPad to the iPad mini and Air to the iPad Pro. The iPad Air and the range-topping Pro are available in two iterations, meaning you can browse six different products before making your final decision.\n\nShop Prime Day Deals\n\nThis Spring, Apple significantly refreshed the iPad lineup by introducing new Air and Pro iterations. The iPad Pro got a complete design and hardware overhaul, headlined by the Apple M4 chip and an Ultra Retina XDR OLED display tucked into an extremely slim metal housing. On the other hand, the iPad Air received a power upgrade via the Apple M2 and an additional 13-inch screen size option.\n\nApple also treated the 10th-generation iPad to a permanent $100 price cut. The product now starts at $349, so it’s an even sweeter bargain. It replaces the previous iteration as the entry-level option in the iPad range, ensuring that every device has an all-screen design with gesture controls and a USB-C connector.\n\nThe with a Lightning port and a home button underneath the display is no longer available from Apple. You can still find it on sale from major retailers, but I’d recommend the follow-up for its design and hardware.\n\nWith so many iPad models to choose from before factoring in additional bits like storage capacity and optional cellular connectivity, we understand why some might find choosing which one to buy a tad overwhelming. We tested and compared every iPad available today to help you pick the right one for your needs and budget.\n\nToday's iPad Lineup\n\nBest for Most Consumers —\n\nBest Budget —\n\nBest Premium —\n\nBest Compact —\n\nWhy You Should Buy an iPad\n\nBest-in-Class Hardware and Performance\n\nWe can tell you with complete confidence that no matter which iPad you choose, it will be the best in its respective category and price range. You can expect elegant design, excellent craftsmanship, top-tier hardware that includes a powerful chip and a crisp Retina display, and incredible performance from every product in this list — all of which make the iPad price tag worth pressing the “buy” button every single time.\n\niPadOS\n\nYou'll get iPadOS with every new iPad. The platform has unique features that take advantage of the tablet's big screen. It has for a and a , making the iPad an even more appealing laptop alternative.\n\nSome of the features that left me impressed with — the latest release of the Apple platform — include elaborate lock screen customization options and interactive home screen widgets that make accessing a multitude of commonly used features — from the calendar to connected home controls — more effortless.\n\nThe new bits join Stage Manager and Freeform, which debuted alongside iPadOS 16 last year. Stage Manager made multitasking with the iPad Pro on an external 4K monitor a breeze by neatly displaying the open apps on the left side of the screen. The functionality will also allow you to group specific apps based on your workflow.\n\nAvailable for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, is a new standalone app that takes note-taking and collaboration with others to a whole new level. I used it to jot down notes with the Apple Pencil on the iPad Pro while taking an online course. By syncing with iCloud, Freeform allowed me to access my writings anywhere for impromptu study sessions.\n\nThe iPadOS selection of apps and games is the best in the industry. They range from apps for streaming content to immersive augmented reality titles. In this instance, tablet rivals that use Android, Chrome OS, and Microsoft Windows are so far behind that there’s no point in comparing them.\n\nBest of all, every new iPad comes with many years' worth of timely iPadOS updates, ensuring you'll always get the best, most up-to-date experience.\n\nRegardless of which Apple Pencil you choose, you’ll get one of the best screen input accessories in the business. I recommend any version for students and those who frequently take notes, though experienced digital artists and creative personalities should spend extra on the Pro.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nThe most important thing you need to know when shopping for an iPad is that the more you spend, the better the performance and available features will be. Opting for a pricier model will inevitably get you a more powerful chip, a higher-quality display panel, and a better camera setup, to name a couple of features.\n\nOn the other hand, spending the same amount of money on a lesser model will inevitably get you more storage and (possibly) a more flexible cellular connectivity option.\n\nStorage is essential, so we always suggest skipping the entry-level variant of every iPad iteration for one with more memory. It probably won’t take long before you find the additional expense to be well worth it.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the latest iPad Pro models with more than 512GB of storage come with 16GB of RAM for next-level multitasking. Versions with less storage have 8GB of RAM — enough for most consumers. That said, if you plan to multitask on your iPad and use it with an external monitor, I highly recommend spending extra on this upgrade.\n\nEvery new iPad has a FaceTime camera with Center Stage. With the help of machine-learning tech, Center Stage can keep you in the center of the frame (hence the name) even if you move around. It's great for video calls and virtual work meetings.\n\nIn a manner befitting their “Pro” moniker, the range-topping iPads have a capable dual rear camera that's also great for capturing content, especially video. Their big screens and powerful chips make composing and editing content a breeze.\n\nSave for the most affordable option, every new iPad offers optional 5G connectivity for $150 extra. In the case of the Pro models, the fast cellular option costs $200 more.\n\nBy delivering fast network speeds, the functionality makes the slate a great tool for staying connected and productive while commuting or in places without access to a Wi-Fi network. We highly recommend this option if you plan to use your iPad on the go frequently.\n\nWhy Trust Us\n\nThe iPad has been a part of my daily gadget routine since I bought my first one —a 3rd-generation model that was the first to rock a Retina display — back in 2012. In the years that followed, I’ve tested every iPad model that's hit the market, as well as countless original and third-party accessories for the slate.\n\nEvery iPad that’s part of this guide has been thoroughly tested over weeks, months (or longer). An in-depth review is available alongside every product, should you choose to learn even more about it.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each iPad offers so you can pick the best one to suit your needs or to make a foolproof gift to someone you care about.\n\nBest iPad for Most Consumers\n\nWho Is It For? →\n\nThe iPad Air is a great buy for anyone looking to upgrade to a new Apple slate — from longtime users to first-time buyers. Now available in two screen sizes, it offers a combination of approachable design and futureproof hardware that make it the best tablet for the money and beyond.\n\nFresh off an upgrade with the Apple M2 chip, the latest iPad Air is the best option for most buyers, offering a sleek design and futureproof performance — all at an agreeable price. Available for the first time in two screen sizes — 11- and — the slate is the fastest, most powerful product in its price range and beyond. Its design with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor integrated into the power button has remained unchanged from the last two generations, but the new position of the front-facing camera in landscape mode makes the device comfier when used instead of a laptop.\n\nWhile testing the all-new 13-inch iPad Air, I discovered that there is no work- or entertainment-related task it isn’t up for. The bigger Retina display screen was a game changer, allowing me to run two apps side-by-side comfortably, just like on the 13-inch MacBook Air I replaced with it. As always, Apple’s True Tone tech helped me avoid eye strain by automatically adjusting the white balance and color temperature depending on the lighting conditions.\n\nCompared to the considerably pricier , the new iPad Air is noticeably thicker and equipped with a lower-grade IPS screen sans ProMotion. The newer Pro also has a beefier M4 chip, Face ID, a superior read camera with a LiDAR scanner, double the storage capacity in the starter version, and a fancier optional Magic Keyboard.\n\nThe sixth-generation iPad Air has recycled aluminum housing available in five colors (blue, purple, space gray, and starlight). Because it’s a full-blown laptop replacement, the is my pick in the range and worth the $200 premium over the 11-inch variant. I tip my hat to Apple for offering the product with 128 GB of storage — a significant leap over the 64 GB of the fifth-generation Air — in an entry-level guise while keeping pricing unchanged. More memory options are also available, topping out at a hefty .\n\nBest Budget iPad\n\nWho Is It For? →\n\nThis iPad iteration is an excellent option for first-time buyers and longtime Apple faithfuls who don't want to drop $500+ to get a new Apple slate. Starting well below $400, the product has an up-to-date design, hardware, and connectivity features. Its vibrant colors and rich selection of accessories also make it a great buy for students.\n\nThe 10th-generation iPad is the one to get if you want to keep your upgrade budget well below $500 without skimping on essential features like Wi-Fi 6 and optional 5G, to name a few. The slate has the same modern design as the iPad Air and Pro but slightly toned-down specs.\n\nOverall, this iPad iteration is an excellent one for everyday use and school work, among other tasks. I spent days using the device to work on the move, and it performed exceptionally, allowing me to switch between several of my go-to productivity apps effortlessly.\n\nWhen it comes to differences between the iPad and the pricier Air, the most notable ones include the former’s Apple A14 Bionic chip — the same silicon that powers the 4th-generation iPad Air from 2020 — and lack of support for the Apple Pencil Pro. The iPad has a similar screen size and resolution as the Air, but its panel lacks antireflective coating and support for the P3 color gamut.\n\nThe slate isn’t compatible with the Apple Magic Keyboard either — it works with the more affordable instead. You can order the 10th-generation iPad with up to 256GB of storage in blue, silver, pink, and yellow. The last-mentioned color is particularly striking and the flashiest we’ve seen on an iPad.\n\nThe Ultimate iPad\n\nWho Is It For? →\n\nThe iPad Pro is worth every penny of its hefty price tag if you're looking for laptop-conquering power and touchscreen versatility in a more compact form factor. Its M4 chip offers more graphics and processing power than the latest MacBook Air, as well as countless PC laptops and Chromebooks.\n\nThe thoroughly redesigned, impossibly thin iPad Pro is Apple’s most powerful and feature-packed yet. In addition to a striking new design, the Pro brings a host of hardware improvements over the previous iteration, headlined by the Apple M4 chip and a stunningly bright Ultra Retina XDR display. The slate also arrived with an , in addition to to support.\n\nAvailable for the first time in an Apple device, the new M4 silicon of the iPad Pro delivers a bump in graphics and processing power over the M2 chip that powers its predecessor. The chip upgrade makes the thin slate more powerful than the latest MacBook Air. It’s proficient at conquering complex workflows and more capable than most laptop computers.\n\nFeaturing a pair of OLED panels, the iPad Pro’s Ultra Retina XDR display delivers captivating visuals with vibrant colors, deep contrast, and, thanks to ProMotion, smooth visuals. The screen is nothing short of spectacular — and a joy to use. Impressively, the screen is also available with optional nano-texture glass for uncompromising color accuracy regardless of the lighting.\n\nThe Apple M4 chip, in tandem with a platform that's tailor-made for it, made the iPad Pro power through my multi-app workflow with ease. Better yet, the device's captivating display provided better visuals than the screen of any MacBook.\n\nThankfully, both the 11- and the pack an Ultra Retina XDR screen. For comparison, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the M2 chip has a nicer mini-LED display than its 11-inch sibling. The mini-LED panel of the older iPad Pro was excellent, but I noticed that the Ultra Retina XDR of the sequel was on a higher level in contrast and color reproduction the moment I powered it on.\n\nCompared to the cheaper iPad Air, the Pro has a beefier chip, a vastly superior display, a Thunderbolt-compatible USB-C connector, more storage options, Face ID, a more sophisticated rear camera with a LiDar scanner, and studio-grade microphones. Overall, it is the best tablet money can buy — by an insurmountable margin.\n\nApple offers the new iPad Pro in silver or space black with up to 2 TB of storage. The starter version comes with ample 256 GB of storage.\n\nMost Compact iPad\n\nWho Is It For? →\n\nWhen it comes to sheer portability, the iPad mini is truly in a league of its own and hands-down the best small tablet worth your attention today. The device is perfect for anyone looking to read, browse the web, and even crank out work on a screen that's bigger than their smartphone's but doesn't want to lug around a full-size tablet.\n\nYears after launching the previous iteration, Apple completely revamped the beloved iPad mini with an iPad Air-like design, a bigger display, and a Touch ID sensor that’s integrated into its power button. The slate packs the same Apple A15 Bionic chip as the iPhone 14, an upgraded camera setup with Center Stage tech and 4K video recording, optional 5G network connectivity, and a USB-C connector. You can order it in a quartet of eye-catching colors: space gray, starlight, pink, and purple.\n\nThe iPad mini has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone technology and compatibility with the P3 color gamut. It’s bigger and more vibrant than the 7.9-inch panel of the outgoing model. The screen size bump made me reach for the iPad mini over a few iPhone Pro Max iterations every time I wanted to read a book or parse through a magazine in Apple News+.\n\nTo my surprise, I also found the bigger screen of the small iPad better for touchscreen gaming than the 6.7-inch panel of my iPhone. I could hold the slate comfortably and without sacrificing game inputs like I would with a bigger iPad."
