        "text": "It can be a frustrating moment if your Wi-Fi is not working but the people around you are using it just fine. There can be a lot of reasons for it. Maybe there is some issue in your phone or maybe your iPhone or iPad cannot connect to this particular router? There can be a lot of reasons that might make you confused. All you need to do is to diagnose the real reason behind it. We are here to help you diagnose and fix this problem if your iPhone cannot connect to Wi-Fi. In this article, we are going to discuss different reasons and solutions for them to fix your Wi-Fi connectivity.\n\nWhy isn’t my Wifi connecting to my iPhone?\n\nOnce you connect your wifi to your phone, it should be showing the signals whenever you are in the range. For example, when you enter your home, your iPhone automatically gets connected to your iPhone. But what if your phone is not connecting to the wifi? There are several reasons why your iPhone won’t connect to the Wifi. These reasons include:\n\nSome people face issue connecting wifi to their iPhone right after they have updated iOS\n\nChanges in the settings by mistake\n\nThere is an issue in the router when your device is connecting to all other Wifi routers\n\nThe antenna in your phone might be damaged\n\nEvery time you connect your iPhone with wifi, it keeps getting disconnected\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these problems, do not panic. Here are some solutions that you can try to fix this issue.\n\nTop Solutions to Fix the Problem\n\nReboot your iPhone:\n\nThe first solution that comes to everyone’s mind is to restart your phone whenever the Wi-Fi is not connecting to your iPhone. Sometimes a minor issue in connectivity can be resolved by just rebooting your device. You can restart your iPhone/iPad to see if the Wi-Fi sign is appearing and catching signals. This technique works most of the time as it dumps the corrupt network data from your iPhone. If you are still confused about the technique, then these easy steps will help you reboot your iPhone. Note that this procedure is applied for iPhone x and the models that came out after it.\n\nThere is a side button on your iPhone. Press the button and hold until notification of “Power Off” shows up.\n\nThen, a slider will appear on your iPhone. Slide it to turn off your device.\n\nWait for at least 30 seconds before you turn off your iPhone.\n\nTurn on the device with the same procedure by long-pressing the side button.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are using versions like iPhone 8 plus or any of the earlier models, then you will have to follow these steps:\n\nThere is a top button on your iPhone.\n\nPress the button and hold until notification of “Power Off” shows up.\n\nTurn off your iPhone by sliding the “Power Off” slider. Wait for 30 seconds\n\nNow, turn on the device by long pressing the top button.\n\nOnce your iPhone is switched on, go to the “Settings” and turn on your Wi-Fi. Hopefully, it will turn on. If it still does not connect to the Wi-Fi router, then you should try out other options.\n\nTurn on and off the Airplane mode:\n\nAnother thing you can do is to turn on the airplane mode and then switch off it to see if your Wi-Fi is connecting to the router or not. This is an old trick that you can try out. Trust us, it works like magic. Follow these simple steps to switch on and off the Airplane mode in your iPhone:\n\nGo to the “Settings” option\n\nNow go to the “Airplane Mode”\n\nYou will find an option to toggle the switch “ON”. As soon as you turn on the airplane mode, the phone will disconnect all the wireless radios. This way you will give your iPhone/iPad a chance to reboot\n\nNow toggle off the “Airplane mode” after a few seconds to see if your Wi-Fi is working\n\nSometimes this method is all you need to bring back the connection on your phone. If the problem is still not fixed, then you can go with another method. But chances are that your device will be connected to the Wi-Fi as soon as you do this technique.\n\nDelete Corrupt Wi-Fi connections:\n\nThere can be other complicated reasons why your Wi-Fi is not working. One of them the corrupt Wi-Fi networks on your iPhone. Sometimes we go to different places and connect to the Wi-Fi devices there and forget to delete even if we are not going to go there again. It is better to delete extra Wi-Fi networks from your phone as they might be causing the trouble. Here are the steps to do this technique if your Wi-Fi isn’t working.\n\nThere will be a “Settings” option on your home screen. Tap on it\n\nNow tap “Wi-Fi” to see all the networks that are available in the list. Make sure your Wi-Fi is switched on already\n\nStart selecting the Wi-Fi networks to forget their password by tapping on each of them\n\nOnce you are done, Switch off your Wi-Fi and restart your iPhone\n\nOnce you have restarted your iPhone, now go the “Settings” again to switch your Wi-Fi back ON.\n\nThen, connect to the Wi-Fi that you want to use.\n\nIt is important to enter the correct password to connect with the Wi-Fi. It should connect to the router but if it still does not work, you can try out the next solution.\n\nSave 60% OFF iPhone 11 Series with code: SALEIPHONE\n\nReset your iPhone’s Network Settings:\n\nIf the above solutions did not fix the connectivity issue, then this technique will surely do! You can simply reset the settings on your iPhone to resolve the issue. By resetting the network, you get rid of all the networks that might contain corrupt files, APNs, unwanted Bluetooth connections, etc. During the process, you will be able to clear out invalid configurations that might have affected your Wi-Fi connection. Here are the easy steps that you can follow to reset the network settings:\n\nTap on the “Settings” option\n\nThen, go to the “General” option\n\nNow you have to scroll down and select the option of “Reset”\n\nThere will be a “Reset Network Settings” option on the screen; Tap on it\n\nYou will be required to enter a passcode\n\nOnce you have entered it, now continue by tapping to confirm the reset\n\nYour iPhone will take some time to reset the settings. Once the process has been completed, you can go back to the “Settings” from where you can enter the Wi-Fi menu. Now connect the Wi-Fi to the router by entering the password. Hopefully, it is going to work this time.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nThese are the top solutions that you can try out if your iPhone cannot connect to WiFi. If one technique does not work, you can go with another but make sure to follow the procedure correctly. In addition to that, you need to be aware of the carrier settings updates. These updates should not go unnoticed as many of them are mandatory to be installed. We hope these solutions helped you fix your Wi-Fi connection.\n\nYou May Also Like to Read:\n\nIs Charging Your iPhone Overnight Bad For the Battery? 2022 Update\n\nHow to update MagSafe Battery Pack Firmware for Faster iPhone Charge in 2022"
