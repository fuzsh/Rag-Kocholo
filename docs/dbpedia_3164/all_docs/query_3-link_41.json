        "text": "iPadOS 15\n\nApple's previous-generation operating system for the iPad.\n\nBy MacRumors Staff on December 29, 2022\n\niPadOS 15 Overview\n\nApple in June 2021 introduced iPadOS 15, which went on to be released on September 20, 2021. iPadOS 15 introduced a new Home Screen design with integrated widgets and the App Library, system-wide fast note-taking with Quick Note, new features for FaceTime calls, a redesigned Safari experience, new tools to reduce distractions, and more.\n\nMultitasking was redesigned in iPadOS 15 with a new multitasking menu at the top of apps, letting users enter Split View or Slide Over more easily, quick access to the Home Screen when using Split View, a new shelf allows for easier multitasking with apps that have multiple windows, and more, making it easier to work with multiple apps at once.\n\nUsers can now place widgets among apps on the iPad's Home Screen pages, and there is a new, bigger widget option. Apple is also bringing the App Library to the iPad for effortless organization of apps, accessible directly from the dock.\n\nQuick Note is a new iPad feature that offers a fast and easy way to take notes anywhere across the system. Users can bring up Quick Note anywhere to jot down a thought and add links, providing an easy way to get back to exactly what they were looking at. In the Notes app, there are new Tags, a Tag Browser, and tag-based Smart Folders. Shared notes now feature mentions to notify collaborators and an Activity view.\n\nFocus is a new feature that can filter notifications and apps based on what a user wishes to focus on at a certain time. When a user's Focus is blocking incoming notifications, their status will be displayed to others in Messages. iPadOS will suggest a Focus for different occasions, such as work hours or winding down for bed, using on-device intelligence, but users can also create a custom Focus. When a Focus is set on one Apple device, it automatically applies to other Apple devices.\n\nLive Text is a new feature that uses on-device intelligence to recognize text in a photo that users can search for, highlight, and copy. Spotlight can now search for photos by location, people, scenes, objects, and text. Spotlight now offers web image search and richer results for actors, musicians, TV shows, and movies. Enhanced results for contacts show recent conversations, shared photos, and location if it is shared through Find My.\n\nThe iPad can now be used to build iPhone and iPad apps using Swift Playgrounds and submit them directly to the App Store. Code is immediately reflected in a live preview while building apps, and users can run created apps full screen to test them out. A new project format based on Swift packages can be opened and edited in Swift Playgrounds for iPad as well as within Xcode on Mac.\n\niPadOS 15 brings voice isolation and Spatial Audio to FaceTime calls so that voices sound as if they are coming from where the person is located on the screen. FaceTime also supports Portrait mode and offers a new grid view to see more faces at the same time. SharePlay is a new feature that allows users to share media together in sync during a FaceTime call. Users can also generate shareable links to a scheduled FaceTime call, which can also be opened on Android and Windows devices.\n\nSafari now features an optional new tab bar design that takes on the color of webpages and combines tabs, the toolbar, and the search field into a compact design. There are also tab groups for managing tabs more easily across devices and web extensions for the first time.\n\niPadOS 15 brings the Translate app to the iPad, with new features that automatically detect when someone is speaking and Auto Translate their speech, an option for a face-to-face view, and system-wide text translation, including for handwritten text.\n\nThere are dozens of tweaks and improvements, such as Universal Control to seamlessly use a single mouse and keyboard across the iPad and the Mac and drag and drop files, features in the Maps app including a globe view and a new 3D experience in cities, all new features for Memories in the Photos app, a system-wide Shared with You feature for highlighting content that has been shared in Messages conversations, a new For All of You row in the TV app to recommend entertainment for the whole household, and more.\n\niPadOS 15 is compatible with the iPad mini 4 and later, iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and all iPad Pro models, and was released on September 20, 2021. iPadOS 15 is being succeeded by iPadOS 16, releasing in October 2022.\n\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\n\nHow to Download and Install iPadOS 15\n\niPadOS 15 is now available to all users with compatible devices, and it is possible to update in the Software Update section of the Settings app.\n\nQuestion or issues can be directed to our iPadOS 15 forum where readers are discussing the release.\n\nCurrent Version\n\nThe current version of iPadOS is iPadOS 15.7.1, featuring security fixes. A previous update, iPadOS 15.7, added the ability to restart, pause, rewind, and fast-forward live sports games in the TV app and bug fixes for Settings, Safari, and braille devices.\n\nA previous update, iPadOS 15.5, added settings to limit downloaded podcast episodes, external links in reader apps, Communication Safety in more countries around the world, references to Apple Classical, SportsKit improvements, bug fixes, and more.\n\niPadOS 15.4.1 introduced Universal Control, added new emojis, support for Universal Control, the ability to turn off notifications for Shortcuts automations, keyboard brightness controls in Control Center, iCloud Keychain notes, improvements to saving passwords, custom email domains, SharePlay in the share sheet, anti-stalking improvements for AirTags, a new Siri voice, a range of other security improvements and bug fixes, and more.\n\nAn earlier update, iPadOS 15.2, introduced a large number of new features, including support for the Apple Music Voice Plan and App Privacy Report, plus it adds playlist search in Apple Music, Hide My Email, Communication Safety for kids, Digital Legacy, and more.\n\niOS 15.4: How to Adjust Magic Keyboard Brightness on iPad From Control Center\n\nHow to Set Up Universal Control Between Mac and iPad\n\nUniversal Control Not Working? Here's How to Fix It\n\nApple has seeded two release candidate versions of iPadOS 15.6 to developers and public beta testers.\n\nMultitasking Improvements\n\niPadOS 15 brings a range of multitasking improvements to the iPad. A new multitasking menu at the top of apps lets users enter Split View, Slide Over, full screen, center window, or close a window more easily.\n\nThere is a new multiwindow shelf that gives quick access to all of the open windows for an app. The shelf appears when you open an app and fades away as soon as you interact with the app. From the shelf, users can tap a window to open it or flick it away to close it.\n\nNow, when a user enters Split View, the app moves aside to reveal the Home Screen, giving access to all Home Screen pages and the App Library.\n\nHow to Use Split Screen on iPad\n\nHow to Multitask on iPad With Slide Over\n\nUsers can open a window in the center of a screen in apps like Messages, Notes, or Mail. Touching and holding an email message, note, or message conversation will open it in a window centered on the screen, allowing you to quickly preview content without leaving the current view, and you can swipe down on the multitasking control to put the centered window in the shelf or create a Split View or Slide Over.\n\nThere is also an improved app switcher to include Slide Over apps and users can now create Split View spaces by simply dragging one app over another. In addition, users can quickly set up and switch between Split View and Slide Over with new shortcuts for multitasking right from the keyboard.\n\nHome Screen Design\n\nWidgets\n\nIn iPadOS 15, it is now possible to place widgets directly on the Home Screen and they will stay in place whether the iPad is being used in portrait or landscape.\n\nWhen you first upgrade to iPadOS 15, there is a new default layout with widgets from the apps you use most arranged in Smart Stacks. Suggested widgets for apps you already use can automatically appear in your Smart Stack at the right time based on your past activity. In addition, you can easily reorder the widgets in your Smart Stacks right from the Home Screen with new controls.\n\nThere are also brand-new widgets for the friends and personal items in the Find My app, friends, and family in the Contacts app, \"Continue Playing\" and \"Friends Are Playing\" in Game Center, items from the Today tab in the App Store, and mailboxes from the Mail app.\n\nApp Library\n\niPadOS 15 brings the App Library to the iPad for the first time. The App Library automatically organizes apps into helpful categories such as Productivity and Games, as well as intelligent categories like Suggestions, to provide a simple, easy-to-navigate view of all your iPad apps. The App Library is accessible in the dock, even when inside an app, and new apps downloaded from the App Store automatically go into the App Library.\n\nHome Screen Pages\n\nUsers can now easily reorder Home Screen pages, as well as hide pages to streamline the Home Screen. With a Focus, users can make certain Home Screen pages appear conditionally.\n\niOS 15: How to Rearrange and Delete Home Screen Pages\n\nSpotlight\n\nSpotlight can now use intelligence to search for photos by location, people, scenes, or objects, and using the new Live Text feature, Spotlight can find text and handwriting in photos.\n\nSpotlight also supports web image searches and significantly richer results for actors, musicians, TV shows, and movies. Enhanced results for contact cards show recent conversations, shared photos, and location if it is shared through Find My.\n\nIt is also possible to access Spotlight from the Lock Screen and quickly install apps from the App Store without leaving Spotlight. For businesses that support App Clips, there is an action button on the Maps result in Spotlight.\n\niOS 15: How to Use Spotlight to Search for Photos\n\nFocus\n\niPadOS 15 features a new tool to help users reduce distraction called Focus. A Focus can filter notifications and home screen pages based on what a users wishes to focus on at a particular time, while still allowing urgent notifications through. When a user's Focus is currently blocking incoming notifications, their status is automatically displayed to other people in Messages, showing that a user is not currently available unless it is urgent.\n\niPadOS will automatically suggest Focuses to users using on-device intelligence to determine which people and apps should notify them at certain times. Focus suggestions are based on users' contexts, such as work hours, personal time, or winding down for bed. Users can also create a custom Focus to only show certain notifications and Home Screen pages, select allowed interruptions for the most important notifications and apps, and set up auto-replies for Messages during a Focus.\n\nWhen a user sets a Focus, it syncs across Apple devices. Developers can implement a new Status API for third-party messaging apps to reflect a Focus status.\n\niOS 15: How to Create a Focus\n\niOS 15: How to Delete a Focus\n\niOS 15: How to Customize a Focus\n\niOS 15: How to Activate a Focus\n\nHow to Schedule and Automate Focus Modes\n\niOS 15: How to Allow Time Sensitive Notifications to Bypass Focus Mode\n\niOS 15: How to Adjust Home Screen and Lock Screen Settings in Focus Mode\n\niOS 15: How to Enable Smart Activation for Focus Modes\n\nNotifications Redesign\n\niPadOS 15 introduces completely redesigned notifications. Notifications will now display contact photos for people and larger icons for apps to make them easier to identify.\n\nThere is an all-new personalized notification summary that collects non-urgent notifications together to be delivered at a more appropriate time, such as in the morning or evening. Notifications in the summary are arranged by priority using on-device intelligence that analyses users' interactions with apps, with the most important and relevant notifications rising to the top. Urgent messages and time-sensitive notifications will still be delivered immediately.\n\nThere is now the option to mute any app or messaging thread's notifications temporarily, and iPadOS 15 will suggest muting a thread if it is unusually active but you are not engaging with it.\n\nThere is also a new notification API for developers, allowing them to send Time Sensitive notifications and adopt the new look for notifications coming from people.\n\niOS 15: How to Set Up a Notification Summary\n\nUniversal Control\n\nUniversal Control is a new iPad feature that allows users to use a single keyboard, mouse, or trackpad across the iPad and the Mac. When you move from your Mac to your iPad, the cursor for your mouse or trackpad transforms from an arrow to a round dot, automatically changing shape to what is best suited for the device.\n\nNo setup is required. Users simply push their cursor from one device toward the other until it pops onto the second device. Then you can move your cursor seamlessly between the two. There is also an option to set up Universal Control to work continuously in System Preferences, preventing the need to link the two devices each time.\n\nUniversal Control allows users to drag and drop content between devices and works with up to three devices. It's compatible with MacBook Pro (2016 and later), MacBook (2016 and later), MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2017 and later), iMac (5K Retina 27-inch, Late 2015), iMac Pro, Mac mini (2018 and later), and Mac Pro (2019); and iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later), and iPad mini (5th generation and later).\n\nUniversal Control is not available with the initial public release of macOS Monterey, but the feature is currently in beta testing and is expected to be released in the spring.\n\nUniversal Control vs. Sidecar: What's the Difference?\n\nSwift Playgrounds\n\nSwift Playgrounds now allows users to build iPhone and iPad apps with SwiftUI. Code is immediately reflected in the live preview while building apps, and users can run their apps full-screen to test them out. Users can even submit apps built in Swift Playgrounds directly to the App Store.\n\nSwift Playgrounds uses a new open project format based on Swift packages, which can also be opened and be edited within Xcode on the Mac, offering users the opportunity to develop apps across the iPad and the Mac.\n\nNotes\n\nQuick Note\n\nQuick Note is a new feature accessible from anywhere in the system, and allows users to quickly jot down information. Users can bring up Quick Note with a swipe of the finger or the Apple Pencil from the corner of the screen, Control Center, or a keyboard shortcut.\n\nThe size or position of a Quick Note is adjustable, and it can be hidden on the side of the screen to be brought back up quickly. Quick Note supports links from an app to create context, adding a thumbnail of the Quick Note when you next use the app to remind you of what you noted earlier. Quick Note can also keep track of websites you have visited by highlighting text or images in Safari and adding them directly to your note.\n\niPadOS 15: How to Use Quick Notes\n\niOS 15.4: How to Customize iPadOS Corner Gestures\n\niOS 15: How to Use Tags to Organize Your Notes\n\niOS 15.4: How to Scan Printed and Handwritten Notes into the Notes App\n\nThe Notes app in iPadOS 15 features user-created tags to conveniently sort and categorize notes in new ways. There is a Tag Browser to tap combinations of tabs and quickly view tagged notes and new custom folders that automatically collect notes based on tags.\n\nShared Notes Improvements\n\nFor shared notes, it is now possible to mention other users to notify one another of updates, and an all-new Activity view to see the recent edit history.\n\nImages in Handwritten Notes\n\nUsers can now combine handwriting and images in handwritten notes. Images can be dragged into the drawing area, then positioned, resized, or directly drawn on.\n\nReminders\n\nReminders now features tags to help with organizations, and it is possible to search and filter reminders based on tags. There is a new Tag Browser to tap combinations of tabs and quickly view tagged reminders. There are also new custom smart lists that automatically collect reminders together based on tags.\n\niPadOS 15 also brings quick-access options to easily delete completed reminders, improved natural language support, and expanded suggested attributes such as tags, flags, priority, and more.\n\nFaceTime\n\nIn iPadOS 15, FaceTime offers Spatial Audio so that voices in a video call sound as if they are coming from where the person is located on the screen.

There is also a new grid view for group FaceTime calls, enabling participants to see more faces at the same time, and an optical zoom control for the back camera.\n\niOS 15: How to Blur Your Background on a FaceTime Call\n\niOS 15: How to Block Background Noise in FaceTime With Voice Isolation\n\niOS 15: How to Enable Wide Spectrum Audio on a FaceTime Call\n\nSharePlay\n\nSharePlay is a new feature that allows users to share experiences with each other during FaceTime calls, including media like Apple Music songs, TV shows, or movies. Media is played in sync for all participants and there are shared playback controls, so anyone in a SharePlay session can play, pause, or skip content, as well as add to a shared queue. SharePlay also gives users the ability to share their screens to view apps together in FaceTime calls.\n\nThird-party apps such as Disney+, ESPN+, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount+, Pluto TV, TikTok, Twitch, and others have committed to integrating SharePlay.\n\nSharePlay extends to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, so users can watch shows or movies on a bigger screen while connecting over FaceTime.

It is also now possible to find images shared through Messages using a contact name.\n\niOS 15: How to See All the Photos People Have Shared With You in Messages\n\nPhotos\n\nThe Photos app contains a considerable update to Memories, which now features a new design, integration with Apple Music, a more interactive interface, and Memory looks.\n\nMemories will suggest songs based on your Apple Music listening history that synchronize with videos and photos for a more personalized experience. Users can customize memories by swiping through Memory mixes, which let you audition different songs with a different pace and atmosphere.\n\nThere are 12 Memory looks that add mood by analyzing each photo and video and applying the correct amount of contrast and color adjustment for a consistent look. There are also new Memory types, including additional international holidays, child-focused memories, trends over time, and improved pet memories, including the ability to recognize individual dogs and cats.\n\nIt is also possible to view and edit all of the content from a Memory in a bird's-eye view, and a Watch Next section suggests related memories to watch.\n\nPeople identification features improved recognition for individuals, and it is easier to correct naming mistakes in the People album.

Siri is also able to learn about the contacts you interact with most, new words you type, and topics you read about to provide better responses.\n\nSiri can now share onscreen items such as photos, web pages, content from Apple Music or Apple Podcasts, Apple News stories, Maps locations, and more, in a Message, or even take a screenshot to send. In addition, Siri can now use onscreen context to send a message or start a call.\n\nSiri is now better at maintaining context between requests, so you can conversationally refer to what you previously asked. You can also make requests to control a HomeKit device at a specific time or under certain circumstances, like when you leave home.\n\nSiri is also able to Announce Notifications, such as Reminders, on AirPods and users can ask Siri what is on their screen.\n\nSiri offers neural text-to-speech voice in more languages in iPadOS 15, including Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Finnish.

The company said the features will be available in the U.S. only at launch and will be expanded to other regions over time.\n\nCommunication Safety\n\nThe Messages app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac will be getting a new Communication Safety feature to warn children and their parents when receiving or sending sexually explicit photos. Apple has said that the Messages app will use on-device machine learning to analyze image attachments, and if a photo is determined to be sexually explicit, the photo will be automatically blurred and the child will be warned.\n\nWhen a child attempts to view a photo flagged as sensitive in the Messages app, they will be alerted that the photo may contain private body parts, and that the photo may be hurtful. Depending on the age of the child, there will also be an option for parents to receive a notification if their child proceeds to view the sensitive photo or if they choose to send a sexually explicit photo to another contact after being warned.\n\nThe Communication Safety feature will be coming in updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey for accounts set up as families in iCloud. iMessage conversations will remain protected with end-to-end encryption, meaning that private communications will be unreadable to Apple.\n\nScanning Photos for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)\n\nUsing a new feature, Apple will be able to detect known Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) images stored in iCloud Photos, enabling Apple to report these instances to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a non-profit organization that works in collaboration with U.S. law enforcement agencies.\n\nApple says the method of detecting known CSAM is designed with user privacy in mind. Instead of scanning images in the cloud, Apple said the system will perform on-device matching against a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by the NCMEC and other child safety organizations. It will transform this database into an unreadable set of hashes that is securely stored on users' devices.\n\nBefore an image is stored in iCloud Photos, an on-device matching process will be performed for that image against the unreadable set of known CSAM hashes. If there is a match, the device creates a cryptographic safety voucher. This voucher is uploaded to iCloud Photos along with the image, and once an undisclosed threshold of matches is exceeded, Apple is able to interpret the contents of the vouchers for CSAM matches.\n\nApple then manually reviews each report to confirm there is a match, disables the user's iCloud account, and sends a report to NCMEC. Apple has not shared what its exact threshold is, but it has an \"extremely high level of accuracy\" to ensure that accounts are not incorrectly flagged.\n\nThe hashing technology, called NeuralHash, analyzes an image and converts it to a unique number specific to that image. The underlying technology behind Apple's system is quite complex and it has published a technical summary with more details.\n\nExpanded CSAM Guidance in Siri and Search\n\nApple will expand guidance in Siri and Spotlight Search across devices by providing additional resources to help children and parents stay safe online and get help with unsafe situations. For example, users who ask Siri how they can report CSAM or child exploitation will be pointed to resources for where and how to file a report.\n\nThese updates to Siri and Search are coming in an update to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey.\n\nOther Features\n\n5G\n\nEnhanced connectivity using 5G - More app and system experiences are improved by using faster 5G on compatible devices, including support to back up to iCloud and restore from an iCloud backup, stream audio and video on Apple and third-party apps, download higher-quality Apple TV+ content, sync photos to iCloud Photos, update Apple News+ articles for offline reading, and download machine learning models.\n\n5G preferred over Wi-Fi - Your 11-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation) and 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th generation) will now automatically prioritize 5G when Wi-Fi connectivity on networks you visit occasionally is slow, or when you are connected to captive or insecure networks.\n\nGaming\n\nGame Center recents and group invitations - Users' most recent Messages friends and groups are brought into Game Center-enabled games with a new multiplayer friend selector.\n\nGame Center friend requests - Game Center now shows incoming requests in the Game Center friend request inbox.\n\nGame highlights - Users can save a video clip of up to the last 15 seconds of gameplay by pressing the share button on game controllers like the Xbox Series X or Series S Wireless Controller or Sony PS5 DualSense Wireless Controller.\n\nGame Center widgets - There is a new Continue Playing widget that displays recently played Game Center-enabled games across devices.
