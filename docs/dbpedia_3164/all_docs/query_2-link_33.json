Apple sells four main iPad models, each with its own strengths. In addition, a growing number of older iPads are floating around the eBays of the world. Since all of these devices look pretty much the same, it’s important to know what you’re buying and what you should pay for it. This guide covers the best iPad models available right now, what’s coming up, the important differences between models, and the old models that exist (including the ones you shouldn’t buy at any price). We also talk about which Apple Pencil is right for you.\n\nBe sure to check out all our buying guides, including the Best iPad Accessories, Best iPhones, Best iPhone 15 Cases, Best Tablets, and Best MacBooks.\n\nUpdated June 2024: We added our thoughts on the new 13-inch iPad Air with M2.\n\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get WIRED for just $5 ($25 off).
