        "text": "Why you can trust ZDNET\n\n33 years of experience\n\n30 hands-on product reviewers\n\n10,000 square feet of lab space\n\nWhat to Consider\n\n+ -\n\nPurpose\n\nTablets serve different purposes for different users, so the purpose of your soon-to-be tablet is worth considering when choosing the right one. Kids may use one to play and stream, while adults may use one for reading or graphic design. If you’re looking for an entertainment tablet, it’s worth considering one with a high-resolution display and good speakers. If you need one for productivity or work, you’re better off with a strong processor and the ability to use it with a keyboard or stylus.\n\n+ -\n\nPerformance\n\nA tablet is only as good as it performs, so if a fast processor and good responsiveness are essential to you, look for tablets with a powerful processor. Storage is equally important; larger RAM translates into better multitasking capabilities. Also consider internal storage and if there are options for expandable storage.\n\n+ -\n\nOperating system and compatibility\n\niPhone users may prefer an iPad with seamless integration with more Apple products, like AirPods being able to switch between the iPhone and iPad without intervention. The same can be true for Samsung fans. Android tablets feature various brands and models, have more customization power, and are available in wider price ranges. Windows tablets are good for productivity, especially if you need compatibility across desktop apps.\n\n+ -\n\nPrice\n\nThe price range will narrow down the list of tablets considerably. These devices are already expensive to start, but budget and premium options are available. It’s worth considering if high-end features justify the cost for your needs.\n\n+ -\n\nBattery life\n\nLook for long battery life, especially if you plan to use your tablet on the go. You’ll need it to last for the duration of your task.\n\n+ -\n\nExtra features\n\nSome extra features may be exclusive to only some tablets, so consider whether these are important. These features include camera quality, headphone jack, USB-C charging port, weight, compatibility with accessories, and size.\n\niPad Air (5th generation) | Best iPad overall\n\niPad Air (5th generation)\n\nBest iPad overall\n\nView now View at Apple\n\niPad (10th generation) | Best iPad for FaceTime and Zoom\n\niPad (10th generation)\n\nBest iPad for FaceTime and Zoom\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\niPad (9th generation) | Best budget iPad\n\niPad (9th generation)\n\nBest budget iPad\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\niPad Pro (6th generation) | Best iPad money can buy\n\niPad Pro (6th generation)\n\nBest iPad money can buy\n\nView now View at Apple\n\niPad Mini (6th generation) | Best iPad for specific use cases\n\niPad Mini (6th generation)\n\nBest iPad for specific use cases\n\nView now View at Amazon\n\nThe iPad remains the gold standard for tablets because of its wide array of quality apps and content, as well as its integration with other products within the Apple ecosystem. And Apple recently announced two upgraded iPad models: the sixth-generation iPad Air and the seventh-generation iPad Pro.\n\nAlso: The best iPad stylus\n\nWhether you're looking for the best iPad for you, or you're buying one for a kid, a parent, or another friend or relative, there are now essentially five options to choose from -- two variations of the standard iPad, the iPad Mini, and the new iPad Air, iPad Pro models (both in two sizes).\n\nAlso: iPad Pro (2024) vs. iPad Air (2024): Which Apple tablet should you buy?\n\nWhat is the best iPad right now?\n\nI've been using an iPad nearly every day since the product first launched in April 2010, and I've tried all the various models over the years and used them for many different things. My current pick for the best iPad for most people is the iPad Air, because it includes nearly all of the best features the iPad has to offer at a price that's more approachable than the iPad Pro. Below is my full breakdown of the current iPad lineup -- based on my hands-on experience and product testing -- as well as my buying recommendations for each model to help you pick the best one for various needs and budgets. (You can also check out some great iPad Memorial Day deals right now.)\n\nThe best iPads of 2024\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nHas 80% of the Pro features\n\nFive color options\n\nSupports 2nd-gen Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard case\n\nHas speedy M1 chip inside\n\nCons\n\n64GB storage in base model is not great\n\nBattery life struggles to get through a full day if using like a laptop\n\nTouch ID is less convenient than Face ID\n\nConfigured with accessories, it gets expensive quickly\n\niPad Air (5th generation)\n\nBest iPad overall\n\nThe iPad Air looks and feels a lot like the iPad Pro, especially if it's in the Magic Keyboard case and it has the Apple Pencil (2nd generation) magnetically attached. It's truly a slightly less expensive iPad Pro that's only missing a few features (primarily an upgraded processor, an even better display, and more powerful cameras for AR and pro video capture).\n\nThis is the iPad to get if you want to use your iPad nearly every day and do more than just read and watch videos. You want to use it to answer emails, write up documents, take notes, draw a little bit, and maybe play games, for example. The iPad Air is much more powerful device than the base-level iPad, and it's meant for doing more. That's why it has a nicer display and cameras (back and front) than the standard 9th- and 10th-gen iPad models.\n\nReview: iPad Air (2022): So good I almost regret buying my iPad Pro\n\nMy biggest complaint with the iPad Air is that if you're stepping up to this model, then you'll want to get the most out of it and include the add-ons to it -- upgrade from the base 64GB of storage to 256GB, include the cellular connectivity option, and add the Apple Pencil (2nd generation) and the Magic Keyboard. By the time you do all that, it's going to cost you $1,300. That's only $200 less than a similarly configured 11-inch iPad Pro. It's also about the same price as an M2 MacBook Air.\n\nOverall, 98% customers who have purchased the iPad Air at Best Buy said they would recommend this model, and gave it an average rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars.\n\niPad Air (5th generation) specs: Display: 10.9-inch Retina display | Processor: Apple Silicon M1 | Storage: 64GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Space gray, starlight, pink, purple, blue | Cameras: 12MP rear, 4K video. 12MP Ultra Wide camera | Weight: 1.02 pounds | Dimensions: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.24 inches | Connections: USB-C port | Battery life: 10 hours\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nCentered camera for landscape video calls\n\nFour color options\n\nUSB-C charging\n\nSimilar design to iPad Air and iPad Pro\n\nCons\n\nNearly as expensive as iPad Air\n\nDoesn't support 2nd-gen Apple Pencil\n\niPad (10th generation)\n\nBest iPad for FaceTime and Zoom\n\nWhen Apple upgraded its 10th generation base-level iPad with a new design to match the iPad Pro and iPad Air, it added a surprising number of features that had been limited to the high-end models, including USB-C, 5G, 4K video capture, and Wi-Fi 6.\n\nReview: iPad 2022 (10th Gen): Better than the Pro in two ways\n\nBut Apple also gave the 10th-gen iPad something no other iPad has: a front-facing camera that is centered horizontally and optimized for video calls when the iPad is docking in its keyboard case -- which has now become the preferred position for many iPad users. This unequivocally makes the iPad 10th-gen the best iPad for FaceTime calls, Zoom meetings, and other types of video calls. And, based on customer reviews, this iPad would be a good option for those new to Apple as well as those looking for something easy to use for kids or seniors.\n\nThe biggest drawback to this model is the price. Starting at $450, it's $130 more expensive than the iPad 9th generation, which Apple still sells and remains the best budget iPad.\n\niPad (10th generation) specs: Display: 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone | Processor: A14 Bionic chip with 16-core Neural Engine | Storage: 64GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Silver, Pink, Blue, Yellow | Cameras: 12MP f/1.8 wide, 12MP Landscape f/2.4 front | Weight: 1.05 pounds | Dimensions: 9.79 x 7.07 x .28 inches | Connections: USB-C, Smart Connector | Battery life: Up to 10 hours of video playback with USB-C charging\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nGreat price\n\nSolid display\n\nTraditional Touch ID home button\n\nSupports Apple Pencil (1st generation)\n\nCons\n\nFilled with last-generation tech\n\nVery large bezels\n\nUses Lightning port for charging\n\niPad (9th generation)\n\nBest budget iPad\n\nIf you just need a basic, full-screen iPad to watch videos, play games, answer messages, and do an occasional video call, for example, then the base-level iPad (9th generation) will suit plenty of people just fine. And it starts at $329, which makes it very accessible. It's a great first iPad for kids. It's also a good one to give elderly relatives and friends who are still a little uncomfortable with technology and just need a device to do a few simple things.\n\nThe 9th-gen iPad is filled with last-generation technology such as the Lightning connector for charging, a Touch ID home button, 4G LTE connectivity, the A13 chip, and the 1st-gen Apple Pencil. But it does have a 12MP front-facing camera and so it's still a good video call device. And overall, these older technologies are still good enough to handle the basics for most people -- and will be for several years to come.\n\nReview:Apple iPad (2021) review: If it's not broke, don't fix it\n\nAnd the customer reviews speak for themselves: 98% of customers who have purchased this generation iPad at Best Buy would recommend it to a friend, and gave it a rating of 4.9 stars out of 5.\n\niPad (9th generation) tech specs: Display: 10.2-inch Retina display | Processor: A13 Bionic | Storage: 64GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Silver, space gray | Cameras: 8MP rear, 1080p video, 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage | Weight: 1.07 pounds | Dimensions: 9.8 x 6.8 x 0.29 inches | Connections: 3.5mm headphone jack, Lightning port | Battery life: 10 hours\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nGorgeous display with Retina XDR and ProMotion\n\nHas M2, most powerful chip in an iPad\n\nWi-Fi 6E for faster connectivity\n\nAdvanced camera system for AR and pro video capture\n\nCons\n\nCosts as much as a powerful laptop\n\nCamera placement is awkward for video calls\n\nHeavy when combined with Magic Keyboard\n\niPad Pro (6th generation)\n\nBest iPad money can buy\n\nThe iPad Pro is the ultimate iPad, where Apple has pushed the boundaries of what's possible for a tablet and even tempted people to make this their only computing device. Customers who have bought it praise this processor upgrade, saying it makes the iPad Pro \"future-proof\" and worth the cost in the long run. But I would argue that most people shouldn't buy the iPad Pro thinking it's a replacement for your laptop, because many of you would be disappointed and frustrated.\n\nInstead, you should buy the iPad Pro for the things it does well that you can't do with a laptop. The three big ones are:\n\nBuilt-in 5G for simplified, always-on connectivity\n\nDigital drawing capabilities with the Apple Pencil (2nd generation)\n\nAdvanced camera system for capturing augmented reality and ProRes video\n\nThe always-on 5G is its best feature because it always beats having to use your phone as a hotspot -- or worse, public Wi-Fi from your laptop. Being able fire up the iPad Pro with its excellent keyboard, beautiful screen, and faster processor and power through messages and documents from anywhere is truly a treat. And for professionals who want the flexibility of drawing with a digital device or working with AR for viewing and capturing high-quality video without a heavy, bulky rig, the iPad Pro is a purpose-built device that works great.\n\nReview: iPad Pro (2022): I'm cautiously optimistic. Or foolish\n\nWhere the iPad Pro falls down is when you want to start multitasking and doing more complicated tasks that you'd normally do on your laptop. There almost always ends up being a task that's more frustrating or takes extra steps or simply doesn't have all of the functionality you get when you perform the task from a Mac or a Windows PC. And for now, I'd also recommend waiting until Apple announces the next iPad Pro in the spring before making an investment this big -- unless you have an urgent need and won't have FOMO about the latest new features.\n\niPad Pro (6th generation) specs: Display: 11-inch Liquid Retina display or 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion and True Tone | Processor: Apple Silicon M2 | Storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB | Biometrics: Face ID | Colors: Silver, space gray | Cameras: 12MP wide, 10MP ultrawide rear and 12MP TrueDepth FaceTime front | Weight: 11-inch: 1.03 pounds, 12.9-inch: 1.5 pounds | Dimensions: 11-inch: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.23 inches, 12.9-inch: 11.04 x 8.46 x 0.25-inches | Connections: USB-C Thunderbolt/USB-4 | Battery life: 10 hours\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nShow less\n\nPros\n\nLight and compact\n\nSupports 2nd-gen Apple Pencil\n\nUSB-C charging\n\nComes in four colors\n\nCons\n\nNo official keyboard case\n\nExpensive for the feature set\n\nHas the 64GB storage limitation for the base model\n\niPad Mini (6th generation)\n\nBest iPad for specific use cases\n\nThe design of the iPad Mini (6th generation) makes it look a lot like a smaller iPad Air, and the technology inside the product is very consistent with that impression. The 8.3-inch tablet is nearly identical in specs to the 10.9-inch iPad Air. It's essentially the smaller sibling, but it's only $100 less expensive, starting at $499.\n\nThe iPad Mini feels more like a big smartphone than a small tablet at times. It can easily slip into bags, purses, and even the pockets of some cargo pants and vests. Compared to a phone, it's better for reading ebooks, PDFs, documents, news apps, and other digital content -- especially when leaning back in a chair or a couch. But it's not quite as nice as reading on a full-size iPad propped up horizontally in a case when reading at a desk or table. The portability of the iPad Mini along with its support for the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil make note-taking a popular use case -- although I consider the a better note-taking tablet, if that's the primary function you're looking for.\n\nReview: Why the iPad Mini 6 is Apple's most exciting new product in years\n\nThe main audience for the iPad Mini might be businesses with specific use cases such as retail customer service, point-of-sale, and logistics apps such as delivery. It's also good to give to young kids as a first iPad since it's smaller, lighter, and easier to handle. And there are rugged cases for it -- which is critical for both little kids and many business use cases.\n\nCustomers who bought the iPad Mini reported in reviews that they were impressed by its battery life, durability, and its display, also noting its portability to fit in purses and bags, particularly for entertainment purposes.\n\niPad Mini (6th generation) specs: Display: 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display | Processor: A15 Bionic | Storage: 64GB or 256GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Space gray, pink, purple, starlight | Cameras: 8MP rear, 1080p video. 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage | Weight: 0.65 pounds | Dimensions: 7.69 x 5.3 x 0.25 inches | Connections: USB-C | Battery life: 10 hours\n\nShow Expert Take Show less\n\nWhat is the best iPad?\n\nThe best iPad overall is the iPad Air since it has many of the high-end features of the iPad Pro but isn't quite as expensive. However, if you're going to add all of the accessories like the Apple Pencil, the Magic Keyboard, cellular connectivity, and extra storage then you're still going to spend over $1,000 with the iPad Air and will only save a couple hundred dollars off the price of the iPad Pro. In that case, you should strongly consider opting for the iPad Pro.\n\niPad modelPrice (starting cost)DisplayProcessorWeightiPad Air$59910.9-inch Retina displayApple Silicon M11.02 poundsiPad (10th gen)$44910.9-inch Liquid Retina display with True ToneA14 Bionic1.05 poundsiPad (9th gen)$32910.2-inch Retina displayA13 Bionic1.07 pounds\n\niPad Pro (6th gen)$79911-inch Liquid Retina display or 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display\n\nApple Silicon M2\n\n1.03-1.5 pounds\n\niPad Mini$4998.3-inch Liquid Retina displayA15 Bionic0.65 pound\n\n*MSRP at the time of writing. Please note that actual prices may vary depending on available sales, deals, discounts, and coupons.\n\nWhich is the best iPad for you?\n\nWhether you're buying a new iPad or upgrading an old iPad, the first thing to do before you buy is to get really clear about what you're planning to use it for the most.\n\nFactors to consider when choosing the best iPad:\n\nIf you're looking to buy an iPad, here are the top factors you should consider before making a purchase:\n\nMobility: The iPad lineup now ranges from the very small and light iPad Mini to the iPad Pro 13-inch, which can be heavier and more bulky than a laptop (once you attach the Magic Keyboard Case or another third-party case). In between these two you have the rest of the iPad lineup that comes in slight variations of the traditional 10-inch iPad form factor. Think about how much you want to use the iPad on the go and the bag you want to carry it in. Will you be carrying just the iPad or will you also be carrying a laptop?\n\nAccessories: Think about which iPads are compatible with the accessories you'd like to use such as the Magic Keyboard Case and the three different versions of the Apple Pencil.\n\nPrice: There are now iPads for nearly every budget, especially when you include the last-generation models we've highlighted below in the Alternatives section. You can get a standard iPad for around $300 and it will be fine for watching videos, doing light web surfing, and answering messages. This is a great choice for a first iPad or to upgrade an older one used for the same tasks. The premium iPad Pro models are loaded with features, have incredible displays, and cost the same as a premium laptop. However, they are best for creative professionals, artists, and those who want to use the device as their full laptop replacement, which can still be a frustrating endeavor if you're a power user with a long history on a laptop and you have a lot of work to do.\n\nHow do we test iPads?\n\nI have been using an iPad since the day the first Apple tablet was released in 2010, and I have tried out nearly every iPad model at one point or another since then. I've tested the modern iPad models in real-world situations to evaluate their features, design, performance, and overall value.\n\nFor example, I've used the iPad Mini to take notes and read documents on the road. I've used the standard iPad for web browsing and watching YouTube. I've used the iPad Pro models for lots of Zoom calls, Slack, web apps, creating Google Docs, reading during lunch using the Kindle app and the Magic Keyboard case since it props up the iPad quite nicely, and downloading and watching videos while traveling. I've recently tried using the iPad Air for all the things I typically do with an iPad Pro and found that it works great with only two exceptions: the battery life isn't as good and the fingerprint sensor isn't as convenient as Face ID for all day use during a long day of meetings or work.\n\nWhat are the newest iPad models?\n\nApple announced the 6th-generation iPad Air and the 7th-generation iPad Pro models on May 7. You can preorder the tablets now at Apple's website, and they are officially available on May 17.\n\nAlso: How to preorder the new iPad Air, iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil Pro\n\nThe new iPad Air comes in two sizes for the first time (11 inches and 13 inches) and features the M2 chip. In addition, the iPad Air now starts at 128GB instead of the mere 64GB that Apple previous included in the base model.\n\nThe iPad Pro now comes with the new M4 chip which Apple says delivers up to 4x faster GPU rendering and a 50% faster CPU performance than the M2 in the previous iPad Pro. The Pro tablets also feature an Ultra Retina XDR display, which Apple called \"the world's most advanced display.\"\n\nWhat is the best iPad for kids?\n\nThe base model iPad is the best tablet for kids since it's easy to use, lightweight, and can grow with your child as they need it for different purposes. The iPad Mini would also be a good choice since it's the smallest iPad in the lineup, perfect for little hands.\n\nWhat is the best iPad for drawing?\n\nThe best iPad for drawing is definitely the iPad Pro, thanks to its mini LED display that Apple calls Liquid Retina XDR, which is brighter and offers more color contrast when you're drawing. The Pro is also great for drawing since it supports the 2nd-generation Apple Pencil, with a magnetic spot on the side to charge it.\n\nAll that said, the iPad Air also supports the Apple Pencil and is solid drawing tablet as well -- just a step down from the Pro because of the screen quality.\n\nWhat is the best iPad for students?\n\nThe best iPad for students is the 5th-generation iPad Air. It has many of the same features as the powerful iPad Pro but costs less for students' budgets.\n\nAlso: The best note-taking apps for iPad\n\nIt's also compatible with the Magic Keyboard and the 2nd-generation Apple Pencil, so students can utilize it for different forms of note-taking.\n\nShould I get the iPad Pro or the iPad Air?\n\nWhere the iPad Pro is the model for those who want the upgraded cameras, AR features, and the high-quality display, the iPad Air is the model for those who want to use the tablet for work and play, without big sacrifices in performance or features.\n\nAlso: iPad Air (2022) vs iPad Pro (2022): How to choose\n\nWhat are the differences between an iPad, Amazon Fire, and a Samsung tablet?\n\nIt's easy to see the price difference between one of Amazon's Fire tablets and an iPad. However, you have to remember that Amazon designs and builds its tablets as entry-level tablets that do the bare minimum.\n\nPerformance is going to be slower and app selection is going to be worse on Amazon's Fire tablet lineup. The iPad has access to the same App Store as the iPhone, with many apps optimized to take advantage of the larger display on the iPad.\n\nAs far as Samsung tablets go, these devices will run on Android and are closer to iPads in terms of performance, design, and features. The Galaxy Tab S series is ideal for users who need power, such as creators and professionals. The tablets in this series have larger screens and more processing power, comparable to the iPad Pro.\n\nOn the other hand, Samsung also makes a Galaxy Tab A series, which comes at a lower price point with smaller screens for those who need a simple tablet for everyday tasks and entertainment.\n\nAre there alternative iPad models to consider?\n\nView at AmazonView at AmazonView at AmazonView at Best Buy\n\nEditorial standards"
