        "text": "If you replaced your router, changed to a new Wi-Fi network, or updated your current Wi-Fi network’s password, you’ll need to reconnect your Sensi thermostat to Wi-Fi.\n\nConnecting to Wi-Fi may be different depending on which Sensi model you have, and what type of phone you’re using to set it up. Find your product below and then find the instructions for your type of phone.\n\nSensi smart thermostat\n\niOS - iPhone/iPad\n\nTo reconnect using an iOS device, determine what type of Sensi you have first:\n\nOn the thermostat itself, press “Menu”.\n\nPress “Connect”.\n\nIf you don’t have a “Connect” option, you may need to replace your batteries and reset the thermostat.\n\nWhat display do you see? There are 4 different options:\n\nDisplay is blank\n\nDisplay shows 00\n\nDisplay shows 11\n\nDisplay shows 22\n\nDISPLAY SHOWS 11 OR 22:\n\nYour Sensi should be displaying 11 or 22 already. If it isn't, press \"Menu\" and then \"Connect\" again.\n\nOn your iOS device, open the phone Settings.\n\nTap Wi-Fi. Your phone should be connected to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network that you’re going to use with Sensi. If it isn’t, do so now, and “forget” any 5GHz Wi-Fi networks your phone may try to auto-join.\n\nScroll down to “Set up a new device…” and tap your Sensi network name (i.e. Sensi-XXXXXX).\n\nIn “Accessory Setup” you should already be connected to your 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network so tap \"Next\". This process may take up to 5 minutes.\n\nAfter it has joined, tap Done.\n\nYour Sensi should be reconnected now. You may have to press “Exit” on the Sensi thermostat screen to get it to go back to the main screen. Check the Sensi app to make sure you can access it again.\n\nProblems?\n\nIf you're having issues with this setup process, remove the Sensi face plate from the wall by pulling it straight towards you. Press \"Menu\" and then \"Connect\" again. You should see the display show \"00\" now.\n\nFollow \"Display is blank or shows 00\" instructions below for different setup instructions.\n\nDISPLAY IS BLANK OR SHOWS 00:\n\nOn your iOS device, open the Sensi app.\n\nTap the + sign.\n\nChoose your Sensi product.\n\nChoose the option, “Connect to Wi-Fi”.\n\nTap Next through the screen about pressing \"Menu\" and \"Connect\" on the thermostat. Your thermostat should still have the Wi-Fi icon flashing. If it isn't, you can press the buttons specified in the app.\n\nChoose what your Sensi model is displaying (blank, 00, 11 or 22), and tap Next.\n\nThe app will bring you to a page with several steps.\n\nTap the Home button on your iPhone/iPad and go into your phone's Settings.\n\nTap Wi-Fi.\n\nYou will see the Sensi network in your list of available Wi-Fi networks. Tap Sensi-XXXXXX and “join” that network.\n\nIf your Sensi screen is blank (not 00), the Sensi network will require a password to connect to it. The Sensi network password is the Security Code that came on a black card in the packaging.\n\nIf you don’t have the card anymore, the Security Code is also found on the back of the thermostat face plate.\n\nOnce you have the blue check mark next to the Sensi network, return to the Sensi app. Tap Next.\n\nEnter the Sensi PIN/password. If your Sensi screen shows 00, 11, or 22, the app will prompt you for the Security Code/PIN. The Sensi PIN/password is the Security Code that was on the back of the Welcome Guide.\n\nIf you don’t have the Welcome Guide anymore, the Security Code is also found on the back of the thermostat face plate.\n\nTap Next.\n\nSelect your home Wi-Fi network and tap Next.\n\nEnter the password for your Wi-Fi network and tap Join Network.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you should be reconnected, and can now access your thermostat.\n\nAndroid\n\nTo reconnect using an Android device, follow these steps:\n\nOn the thermostat itself, press “Menu”.\n\nPress “Connect”.\n\nIf you don’t have a “Connect” option, you may need to replace your batteries and reset the thermostat.\n\nOn your phone, open the Sensi app.\n\nTap the + sign.\n\nChoose your Sensi product.\n\nChoose the option, “Connect to Wi-Fi”.\n\nTap Next through the screen about pressing \"Menu \"and \"Connect\" on your thermostat.
