        "text": "On stock (unjailbroken) iOS it is not quite possible.\n\nHowever, if your device is jailbroken, then you can use some tweaks to make it possible. Firewall iP7 allows you to monitor all applications & decide whether to allow or deny any outgoing connection.\n\nIt is possible to restrict WiFi or Cellular data for all the apps on your iPhone, but only for iPhones sold in China.\n\nChinese iPhones have an extra option called \"Apps using WLAN & Cellular\" in Settings > Wi-Fi.\n\nIn that section you can control apps from accessing data on Wi-FI or Cellular. If you don't want that app to access data, there is \"Off\" option and the app can't access data on cellular or Wi-Fi.\n\nI'm sorry for it's not possible but you can disabled the app from running. These are the steps to follow:\n\nGo to General,\n\nClick on Restrictions,\n\nEnter your device password,\n\nSwitch off the App you want to disconnect.\n\nI use it to stop Facebook from consuming Data at the background.\n\nFOR NEWER OS VERSION 12.4.6, YOU CAN FIND SIMILAR OPTION IN:\n\nGo to Screen Time,\n\nClick Content & Privacy Restrictions,\n\nTurn on Content & Privacy Restrictions,\n\nThen select what you want to restrict e.g Background App Activities.\n\nFor iOS 13 (2020), it appears that what you want is called Background App Refresh. This is located in Setup > General > Background App Refresh.\n\nYou can set each app individually, and you can make the controls active with Wifi+Cellular, Wifi only, or off."
