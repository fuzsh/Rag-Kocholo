        "text": "Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 12GB to 17GB of space, including iPadOS 15 with its latest features and Apple apps that can be deleted. Apple apps that can be deleted use about 4.5GB of space, and you can download them back from the App Store. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version, settings, and iPad model.\n\nSize and weight vary by conﬁguration and manufacturing process.\n\nFaceTime calling requires a FaceTime-enabled device for the caller and recipient and a Wi-Fi connection. Availability over a cellular network depends on carrier policies; data charges may apply.\n\nData plan required. Gigabit-class LTE and Wi-Fi calling are available in select markets and through select carriers. Speeds are based on theoretical throughput and vary based on site conditions and carrier. For details on LTE support, contact your carrier and see apple.com/ipad/cellular.\n\nCellular data plan is sold separately.

Testing consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video playback and internet browsing using Wi-Fi or cellular data network. Video content was a repeated 2-hour 23-minute movie purchased from the iTunes Store. Internet over Wi-Fi and cellular data network tests were conducted using dedicated web servers, browsing snapshot versions of 20 popular web pages. All settings were default except: Wi-Fi was associated with a network (except for internet browsing over cellular data network); the Wi-Fi feature Ask to Join Networks and Auto-Brightness were turned off; Brightness was set to 50%; and WPA2 encryption was enabled. Battery life depends on device settings, usage, and many other factors. Battery tests are conducted using specific iPad units; actual results may vary.\n\nWireless broadband recommended; fees may apply.\n\nIn China mainland, you can use Apple Pay on the web in Safari only on compatible iPhone and iPad models using iOS 11.2 or later.\n\nData accurate as of product launch.\n\nApple defines its restrictions on harmful substances, including definitions for what Apple considers to be “free of,” in the Apple Regulated Substances Specification.
