This helps you stay connected when you're away from a Wi-Fi hotspot.\n\nUse an eSIM\n\nThere are multiple ways to activate mobile data on iPad using eSIM.

Find out more about using eSIM with your iPad in China mainland.\n\nUse a physical SIM card from your network provider\n\nIf your iPad supports it, you can use a physical SIM card from your network provider to activate a mobile data plan1. If you set up a mobile data plan using a physical SIM card at your local network provider, then the SIM card will be activated. Just open the SIM card tray and insert the SIM card from your network provider. If you have a SIM card from your previous iPad that you would like to transfer to your new iPad, remove the SIM card from your previous iPad and insert it into the SIM card tray on your new iPad.\n\nIf you can't connect to mobile data, go to Settings > Mobile Data and make sure that mobile data is on.\n\nIf you need help transferring a plan, or if you use a corporate or post-paid account, you might need to contact your network provider.2\n\nChange your plan\n\nTo change or check the status of your plan, go to Settings > Mobile Data. If you set up your mobile data plan with a network provider, you might need to contact them directly to change your plan.\n\nYou can have multiple plans on your iPad by signing up with multiple network providers, adding multiple eSIM plans and inserting a SIM card in the Nano SIM tray. To switch between active plans, go to Settings > Mobile Data and tap the plan you want to use under Mobile Data Plans.\n\nDeactivate your plan\n\nSome network providers allow you to deactivate your mobile data plan, which is either pre-paid or post-paid, on your device. To deactivate a pre-paid plan, which is contract free, don't renew it at the end of the month.\n\nPost-paid plans are renewed monthly. To deactivate a post-paid plan:\n\nGo to Settings > Mobile Data.\n\nTap the name of your network provider and choose not to renew your plan.\n\nIf a message says that the account type isn't supported or if you got a SIM from your network provider and you don't see a Manage Carrier Account button, call your network provider and ask them to deactivate your account.\n\nIf you have an iPad with Apple SIM or embedded Apple SIM\n\nAs of 1 October 2022, Apple SIM technology is no longer available for activating new mobile data plans on iPad. Contact your network provider for details on how to activate a mobile data plan on iPad."
