I connect to the website (Blackboard if you are interested) through my Macbook and I can share my screen and applications through Blackboard (an option not available when connecting through an iPad) so that my students see my Macbook scree, the slides there etc.. I use a lot of graphs in my teaching and I would like to use an iPad to draw the graphs as I can draw them there in real time, rather than having to create them beforehand.\n\nI have a Macbook (mid 2014) with OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 (I will update the os at the end of the term) and an iPad Air 2 version 11.2.5.\n\nI have tried Duet and Air Display but I have realized that those apps just extend the Macbook screen, using the iPad as a second screen. That is not what I want. I want to be able to show, through my Macbook, the drawing apps I am using on my iPad. I have a lightning to USB cable and so I can physically connect the iPad to my Macbook. Thanks."
