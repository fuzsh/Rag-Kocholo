        "text": "What are all the differences between the iPad Air 4 (4th Gen) models?\n\nPlease note that the iPad Air 4 models have been discontinued. However, has been updated subsequently with current operating system support and other details and can be quite helpful for anyone buying or selling one of these tablets on the used market.\n\nThere are four iPad Air 4th Gen models -- the iPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi Only), iPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi+Cell US/CA), iPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi+Cell Global), and iPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi+Cell China). These four models -- commonly refered to as the iPad Air 4 -- vary by location sold, connectivity, battery life, identifiers, and price.\n\nPhoto Credit: Apple, Inc. (iPad Air 4th Gen)\n\nDevice Similarities\n\nAll iPad Air 4 tablets share the same thin case design with rounded corners and flat sides, weigh about a pound, and have a black front. Color options for the back and sides include silver, darker \"Space Gray\", \"Rose Gold\", (Light) Green, and \"Sky Blue\".\n\nPhoto Credit: Apple, Inc. (iPad Air 4th Gen Color Options)\n\nEach iPad Air 4 model uses the same fully-laminated, antireflective 10.9\" LED-backlit 2360x1640 \"Liquid Retina\" display (264 ppi, 500 nits) surrounded by a thin black bezel. The display offers \"wide color\" (DCI-P3) support and Apple's \"True Tone\" technology. They do not support ProMotion (120 Hz refresh rate).\n\nAll iPad Air 4 models also share the same six-core 3.0 GHz Apple A14 Bionic processor, a 16-core \"Neural Engine\", have 4 GB of RAM, and are equipped with either 64 GB or 256 GB of flash storage. In addition to a USB-C port -- the first on an iPad Air -- other connectivity includes 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) with HT80 with MIMO capability and Bluetooth 5.0. All have a front-mounted 7 megapixel \"FaceTime HD\" camera that shoots up to 1080p video, a rear-mounted 12 megapixel camera that shoots up to 4K video, dual microphones, and stereo speakers.\n\nOther notable features include a \"Touch ID\" authentication sensor built into the top button -- a first for an Apple device -- as well as support for the Apple Pencil 2 (A2051, MU8F2AM/A, US$129) that conveniently charges via a magnetic connection on the side.\n\niOS Support Similarities\n\nThe iPad Air 4 models first shipped with iPadOS 14.1 and are fully compatible with iPadOS 15, as well. The iPad Air 4 models also are compatible with iPadOS 16, and iPadOS 17, as well.\n\nHowever, running iPadOS 16, the iPad Air 4 models do not support the advanced Stage Manager, Reference Mode, Accessibility Detection, and Virtual Memory Swap features (Apple mistakenly initially listed it as compatible with Virtual Memory Swap, but this was an error).\n\nRunning iPadOS 17, the iPad Air 4 lacks support for the minor Screen Distance and External Camera for FaceTime features.\n\nIdentification Differences\n\nWhen side-by-side, the Wi-Fi only and cellular iPad Air 4 models can be differentiated visually because the iPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi Only) -- left -- has a solid aluminum back whereas the cellular iPad Air 4 models -- right -- have a subtle antenna line at the top of the back of each device:\n\nPhoto Credit: Apple, Inc. (iPad Air 4: Wi-Fi - Left; Cellular - Right)\n\nHowever, it is not possible to visually distinguish the three cellular-capable iPad Air 4 models and it is easy to mix up all of these tablets with iPad Pro models, as well. Consequently, one of the best methods for external identification is via Model Number.\n\nModel numbers are listed in small type toward the bottom of the back of each iPad Air:\n\niPad Air\n\nModel No\n\niPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi Only)\n\nA2316\n\niPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi+Cell US/CA)\n\nA2324\n\niPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi+Cell Global)\n\nA2072\n\niPad Air 4th Gen (Wi-Fi+Cell China)\n\nA2325\n\nInitially, these cellular-equipped iPad Air 4 models probably will not often cross paths because of their different geographic distribution, but over time, they will find their way around the globe on the used market.\n\nAll iPad models can be differentiated by other identifiers as well, such as the Order Number, which can be located by selecting the Settings app and pressing General > About and scrolling down to what is specified as \"Model\" within the iOS. For example, the cellular-equipped configuration of the iPad Air 4 in green with 256 GB of storage sold in the United States is MYJ72LL/A.\n\nTo pinpoint an exact iPad Air 4 by a number of different identifiers -- including its Serial Number -- please refer to the Ultimate iLookup feature.\n\nConnectivity & Battery Life Differences\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this Q&A, the iPad Air 4 models have major differences in connectivity. All iPad Air 4 models support 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) with HT80 with MIMO capability and Bluetooth 5.0.\n\nAll cellular iPad Air 4 models support A-GPS, UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA (850, 900, 1700/2100, 1900, 2100 MHz), and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz), but Gigabit-class LTE cellular connectivity varies accordingly:\n\niPad Air Model 4G LTE Bands 4 (Wi-Fi Only) A2316 None 4 (Wi-Fi+Cell US/CA) A2324 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 48, 66, 71 4 (Wi-Fi+Cell Global) A2072 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 48, 66, 71 4 (Wi-Fi+Cell China) A2325 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48, 66\n\nFor battery life, Apple estimates that all iPad Air 4 models provide up to ten hours of runtime on Wi-Fi whereas the cellular-equipped models provide up to nine hours using a cellular network.\n\nEvery cellular iPad Air 4 models ship unlocked. In the US, the applicable tablet works with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Some carriers may still require activation or configuration before it will work properly -- or at all -- on their network.\n\nIn the US and UK, if purchased from Apple or an Apple Authorized Reseller -- like site sponsor Adorama -- the cellular-capable iPad Air 4 also ships with an \"Apple SIM\" that is designed to support multiple carriers via a single Apple-issued Nano SIM card.\n\nPricing Comparison Chart\n\nAll iPad Air 4 color options cost the same amount. Original pricing is differentiated by capacity and connectivity alone:\n\nCapacity: 64 GB 256 GB Wi-Fi Only Price: US$599 US$749 Wi-Fi/Cellular & A-GPS Price: US$729 US$879\n\nFor original pricing details in dozens of other countries, please refer to the iPad specs page for the device of interest as well as EveryiPad.com's Global Original Prices section.\n\nComparison Summary\n\nUltimately, the iPad Air 4 models are differentiated from each other by connectivity and battery life. Like earlier iPad Air models, the iPad Air 4 still is considered to be positioned above the entry-level \"regular\" iPad and below the more expensive iPad Pro line, but the iPad Air 4 actually was faster than the iPad Pro models available when the iPad Air 4 was introduced in single-core tasks. It introduced a slick \"Touch ID\" in the power button that the iPad Pro lacked, too.\n\nThe iPad Pro models still have bigger and better displays and better cameras, but the iPad Air 4 represents a major bump up in the capabilities of the \"mid-range\" iPad Air series.\n\nWhether to choose a Wi-Fi only or cellular iPad Air 4 is a personal decision as to whether or not the A-GPS and cellular capability originally was worth the extra US$130 upfront plus the extra ongoing costs for cellular connectivity, but on the used market, the value proposition may have changed somewhat.\n\nIf the iPad Air 4 is going to be your only computer and you likely will be on the go frequently, the cellular connection could be quite worthwhile. On the other hand, if you plan to use your iPad mostly in your Wi-Fi-equipped home, office, and coffee shop (and don't mind occasionally tethering your iPad Air to a cellular-equipped device like an iPhone or Android mobile), the Wi-Fi only model could be perfect for your needs.\n\nIn the US, site sponsor Adorama sells new iPad Air models with free shipping. Other World Computing and JemJem sell used and refurb iPad Air models at bargain prices with free shipping, as well. Finally, if you need to sell an iPad, A+ BBB-rated Cash for Your Mac and GoRoostr will buy your older iPad with an instant quote and prompt payment.\n\nIn the UK, site sponsor Hoxton Macs has a large number of used and refurbished iPad models with a one-year warranty and free next day delivery throughout the UK. Delivery across Europe also is available starting at just £9.99 for two-day delivery to France and Germany.\n\nIn Australia, site sponsor Mac City may have used iPad models in stock, as well.
