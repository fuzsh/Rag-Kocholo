        "text": "Hi, I am having trouble with the WiFi connection of my MacBook Pro (macOS Monterey 12.0.1). I am using a WiFi that is shared between all residents of the building I am living and I do not have admin access to it. I noticed that the WiFi becomes extremely slow as soon as my Mac switches to the 5 GHz band while it is fine when it is connected to the 2.4 GHz band. Unfortunately this switch happens automatically all the time. Is there a way to make sure that my Mac always uses the 2.4 GHz band?\n\nDo the 5 and 2.5 GHz networks use the same SSID? If so you can't select which one to use. Frequently the network with greater signal strength will be selected but if the 2.4 one is higher it is also slower.\n\nWhat does a tool such as Wi-Fi Explorer show for the local Wi-Fi network environment?\n\nThis wouldn't be the first case with a misconfigured network, or with conflicting networks, or that's just overloaded.\n\nSome potential options: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/131852/how-do-you-force-a-5-ghz-wifi-connection#202085\n\nBasically, select a 2,4 GHz channel, and see if that meets your needs. (I don't have a way to test this right now.)"
