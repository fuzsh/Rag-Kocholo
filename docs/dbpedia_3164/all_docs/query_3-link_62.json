Mirrored content could be content that’s on the device, or live streams of what’s happening on the device screen. To use AirPlay, devices don’t need to be on the same network, or on any network at all.\n\nA device can discover Apple TV using Bonjour discovery, Bluetooth® IP address advertisement, or peer-to-peer discovery.\n\nDevices prefer peer-to-peer discovery but typically establish a connection using the method that’s the most responsive or the one most recently used.\n\nPublished Date: October 27, 2021"
