        "text": "If you can't connect your iPadÂ® to Wi-Fi, you won't be able to stream a show, check email, or do any of the things you want and need to do. Fortunately, this is almost always an easy fix, and we'll walk you through it.\n\nAt Asurion, we find and fix any issue with your techâfast. Whether it's securing your phone from hackers or finding a lost or stolen laptop, our experts can help. Here are simple steps to take when your iPad won't connect to Wi-Fi.\n\nMove closer to your router\n\nIf your iPad is too far away from your router, the signal may not be strong enough for your device to connect to Wi-Fi. Make sure your router is turned on and try moving it closer to get your iPad online.\n\nMake sure that Wi-Fi is on and that you can see your network\n\nGo to Settings > Wi-Fi.\n\nMake sure that Wi-Fi is on (the switch will be green).\n\nTap the name of the Wi-Fi network you want to join. If there's a blue checkmark beside the network name, you're connected.\n\nIf you see Auto-Join disabled under your Wi-Fi network name, tap it to turn on Auto-Join.\n\nEnter your Wi-Fi password\n\nWhen trying to connect with a Wi-Fi network, you may be prompted to enter your password. Even if you enter it correctly, there's a chance an âunable to join the network\" or âincorrect password\" message may appear. If this happens, follow the steps in the Restart your iPad section.\n\nCheck for Wi-Fi network issues\n\nIf iOSÂ® or iPadOSÂ® detects an issue with your Wi-Fi connection, you'll see a message (like âNo Internet Connection\") under the name of the Wi-Fi network that you're connected to. Tap the Wi-Fi network for more information.\n\nYou may also try connecting to a Wi-Fi network in a different part of your house or building. If your device still can't connect, you may need help with your network.\n\nTip: If you're connected to a Wi-Fi network but can't get online, try to connect using another device. If you can't get online with a different device, you may have a service outage. Call your internet provider for help.\n\nRestart your iPad\n\nIf you still can't connect to your network or get online, try restarting your device.\n\nTo restart iPads with a Home button:\n\nPress and hold the Top button until the power off slider appears onscreen, then drag the slider.\n\nWait a few seconds, then press and hold the Top button to turn it on.\n\nTo restart iPads without a Home button:\n\nPress and hold the Top button and one of the Volume buttons until the power off slider appears onscreen.\n\nDrag the slider to turn your iPad off.\n\nWait a few seconds, then press and hold the Top button to turn it back on.\n\nFor more about simple restarts, check out our step-by-step guide to how to hard reset your iPad,\n\nRestart your wireless router and modem\n\nIf your iPad didn't connect to Wi-Fi after you restarted your device, try restarting both your router and modem (sometimes they are two separate pieces, but often they are combined in one device). Here's how:\n\nMake sure the router is connected to the modem and that your cables are plugged in securely.\n\nTurn off the modem/router.\n\nWait 30 seconds, then press the Power button to restart the modem/router.\n\nTip: Make sure to update your Wi-Fi router with the latest firmware, and make sure that the router works with your iPad. Contact the router's manufacturer if you're not sure.\n\nCheck your network settings\n\nIf you still can't connect, try resetting your network settings.\n\nFor iOS or iPadOS 15Â® or later: Go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset [Device] > Reset > Reset Network Settings.\n\nFor iOS or iPadOS 14Â® or earlier: Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.\n\nNote: This will also reset your Wi-Fi networks and passwords, mobile network settings, and virtual private network (VPN) and access point name (APN) settings.\n\nUpdate your software\n\nA software update may solve any issues you're still having with connecting your iPad to Wi-Fi and prevent future problems. To download available updates:\n\nGo to Settings > General > Software Update > Install Now."
