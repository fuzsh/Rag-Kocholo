You simply buy the phone and then get it connected to any compatible network and service plan you choose. An unlocked phone needs a SIM card from a communications service provider or carrier before it will work.\n\nWhat's a compatible network?\n\nUnlocked phones use either CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) or GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks with an interchangeable SIM card. The GSM network is used by AT&T and T-Mobile while the CDMA network is used by Sprint and Verizon. When you buy your unlocked phone, make note of which networks it can utilize so you can find the appropriate service provider.\n\nWhat's a SIM card?\n\nA SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card is a small, removable plastic card with a chip that holds personal information such as your phone number, address book, text messages and more. The SIM card also includes a security key with authentication information that specifically identifies the phone. Typically, an unlocked phone will not include a SIM card. You'll likely receive one through your carrier when you connect your phone to a new or existing service plan. Regardless of the SIM card's origin, the unlocked phone will recognize it and start sending voice and data over the network.\n\nWhat are the advantages of an unlocked phone?\n\nThe first big advantage of an unlocked phone is that you're not limited to the small selection of devices that a particular carrier offers. You get to choose your unlocked phone from any of the available mobile devices that have a SIM card slot and are compatible with your network.\n\nAlong those same lines, you can buy an unlocked phone and add it to your current service plan without requiring a new contract. (Note that bringing the unlocked phone to a new carrier will most likely require you to sign a contract with that carrier.) You can take any SIM card from any carrier and put it in your unlocked phone as long as the phone is compatible with the network and bands. So, if you sign up your unlocked phone for service with AT&T and decide later to switch it to T-Mobile, you can still use the unlocked phone you originally purchased.\n\nAnd with an unlocked phone, you don't need to wait for your contract to expire to upgrade your phone. Instead of waiting for your contract renewal to get a new phone, you can purchase an unlocked phone and use it now on your existing service contract. The added benefit is that when your current contract is up, you'd be free to cancel your plan and switch to any network or carrier you wanted – taking your phone with you to your new plan and carrier! You could also purchase prepaid plans so you'd have no monthly fees.\n\nOne last thing for you international travelers: With an unlocked phone, you'd be able to purchase and install a new SIM card from a carrier operating within your destination country so you could avoid paying the astronomical roaming charges associated with using a mobile phone outside the United States. And maybe you just want to purchase a cheaper unlocked phone for your trip and leave your expensive phone at home to keep it from getting lost, stolen or damaged.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of an unlocked phone?\n\nWhen purchasing a new \"locked\" phone, the carrier often subsidizes the cost of the mobile phone. (They're making money off the service plans and other add-ons, not the device itself.) So an unlocked phone does not benefit from the subsidy offered when bundling the phone with a carrier contracted plan. You're responsible for the entire cost of the phone up front.\n\nRefurbished\n\nWhat are refurbished items?\n\nRefurbished products are items that have been returned by customers and then sent back to the manufacturer. Some refurbished products may have been returned because they were not working properly, while others were simply opened but the customer decided not to keep their purchase.\n\nDo they work like new?\n\nThese items have been restored to \"like-new\" condition and tested by factory technicians to ensure that your product works to its capabilities. All items include the necessary accessories.\n\nWhy buy refurbished?\n\nBuying refurbished is a fantastic way to save money, as the items are sold at a much lower cost than that of the same product, brand new. Buying refurbished also helps the environment, since you've prevented the disposal of these fully capable products.\n\nCan I return refurbished items?\n\nYes! Standard Evine return policy still applies.\n\nWhat about the warranty?\n\nA manufacturer's warranty may be included, so please reference our product description to find any warranty information."
