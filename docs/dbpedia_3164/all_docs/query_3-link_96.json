        "text": "With supported Apple and Beats headphones, you can amplify soft sounds and adjust certain frequencies to best suit your hearing. These adjustments help music, movies, phone calls, and podcasts sound crisper and clearer.\n\nMake sure you’re in a quiet environment and that you’ve paired your AirPods, paired other supported Bluetooth® headphones, or connected your EarPods.\n\nGo to Settings > Accessibility > Audio & Visual > Headphone Accommodations, then turn on Headphone Accommodations.\n\nTap Custom Audio Setup, then follow the onscreen instructions. Or manually set any of the following:\n\nFrequencies: Below Tune Audio For, choose an option to boost different frequencies.\n\nSoft sounds: Drag the slider to set the amplification level.\n\nScroll down, then do any of the following:\n\nTurn on Phone to apply the settings to phone calls.\n\nTurn on Media to apply the settings to media playback like music, movies, and podcasts.\n\nTip: Quickly access Headphone Accommodations by tapping in Control Center. (If you don’t see , add it to Control Center—go to Settings > Control Center, then tap next to Hearing.)\n\nFor information about applying Headphone Accommodations settings to Transparency Mode and Conversation Boost when using AirPods Pro and iPad, see Customize Transparency mode for AirPods Pro in the AirPods User Guide.\n\nYou can use an audiogram to customize the audio settings on supported Apple and Beats headphones and improve their accuracy and sound quality.\n\nUsing pure-tone audio tests, audiograms display how loud sounds need to be in order for you to hear them.\n\nGo to Settings > Accessibility > Audio & Visual > Headphone Accommodations.\n\nTurn on Headphone Accommodations, then tap Custom Audio Setup.\n\nFollow the onscreen instructions to add an audiogram. See Use audiogram data in Health on iPad.\n\nIf the audiogram results from both ears are nearly symmetric, both left and right outputs are fit with the average of their profiles. If they’re asymmetric, the outputs are fit for the better ear."
