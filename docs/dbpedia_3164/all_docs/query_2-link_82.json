        "text": "The following are Wi-Fi specification details for Apple devices. Descriptions of the details are as follows:\n\n802.11 compatibility and frequency band: 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E), 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5), 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4), 802.11a, 802.11b/g and 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz.\n\nApple platforms supporting Wi-Fi 6E can join Wi-Fi 6E networks that are discoverable on 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz channels, and on 6 GHz Preferred Scanning Channels, where 6 GHz is allowed by regulatory domain.\n\nNote: Wi‑Fi 6E isn’t available in mainland China.\n\nPhysical layer (PHY) data rate: The highest rate at which a client can transmit data over Wi-Fi.\n\nChannel bandwidth: The maximum channel bandwidth that is supported. Beginning with 802.11n, channels can be combined to create a wider channel that allows for more data to be transmitted during a single transmission. With 802.11n for 5 GHz band, two 20 MHz channels can be combined to create a 40 MHz channel. With 802.11ac for 5 GHz band, four 20 MHz channels can be combined to create an 80 MHz channel.\n\nMCS index: The Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) index defines the maximum transmission rate at which 802.11ac/n devices can communicate; 802.11ac uses Very High Throughput (VHT), and 802.11n uses High Throughput (HT) frames.\n\nSpatial streams/SISO/MIMO: Each radio can send a specific number of independent data streams, called spatial streams, at the same time, which can increase overall throughput. Single input single output (SISO) uses a single radio and antenna and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) uses multiple radios and antennas.\n\nPublished Date: May 13, 2024"
