        "text": "Hi:\n\nI received a nice iPad Air for Christmas and my husband thought it had the internet connection type where (like a cell phone) you can connect to the 'net pretty much everywhere i.e. driving down the highway, on a mountain top, in other words without hooking into a wifi. I think this one cannot do that. It's 32 GB and says supports wifi but so did my old ipad. And with my old one you had to hook into a wifi connection. I looked on Apple.com and compared iPads and it appears I'd need to have the iPad Air model that says either 'Cell' or '3G' to be able to connect to the 'net this way? This iPad cost $599. Is this right? If so what's the difference between the 'cell' feature and '3G' feature?\n\nAlso, if I'm right and I want to turn it in for a new one, will getting a higher model with cell or 3G feature require me to buy a monthly plan just like a cell phone or can I piggy back on my current iPhone AT&T plan or basically use that plan with iPad too? Thanks.\n\nThe iPad Air Wi-Fi + Cellular will do what you want. I don't know where Apple refers to the iPad Air with \"3G.\"\n\nYou cannot piggyback on your iPhone plan, you will need to purchase a data allowance separately for the iPad. You can do this right on the iPad itself. Also there is no contract so you can stop service whenever you want.\n\nMost of the carriers off far more data plans than what is listed above. I usually just leave data turned on 24/7 and it does not use any more battery power than if I have WiFi turned on. I go to photo heavy sites frequently but no video streaming.\n\nI usually go for the 4.5GB plan on T-Mobile for $40 and it lasts me the entire month just leaving WiFi off. I leave it on because T-Mobiles LTE in my area is super fast, giving me between 26-46Mbps, the fastest out of all the carriers in my area and I have tried them all."
