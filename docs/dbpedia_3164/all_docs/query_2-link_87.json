        "text": "@dmaksymec\n\nI've been having the same issue with mine for the last 6 months. Very disappointed to see no action on this. And... NO FIRMWARE UPDATES SINCE 7/17 !?!?! What the what TP. You have a massively buggy product and can't be troubled to work it? I like a lot of things about this product, but the apprent lack of interest in keeping your products functional beyond sale is all i need to NEVER buy your stuff again. NEVER. I'll go with a supplier that cares about customer satisfaction.\n\n@PiperX\n\nHello\n\nDo you have an Archer C3200 router and encounter the wireless issue with your iPhone or iPad? If yes, please verify the below details and we will try to fix it together:\n\n1. Are all other devices connecting to the router's wireless properly? What is the model of your iPhone or iPad and how about its OS? Keep its OS up-to-date.\n\n2. When there is no internet on your iPhone or iPad, does it still connect to the router wireless (2.4G or 5G?) and can you still ping the router's gateway which is 192.168.0.1 by default?\n\n3. Did you ever try to reset the router to its factory defaults? If not yet, please give it a go.\n\nMy problem is the wifi seems to be very spotty when connected to my iMac.\n\nWifi works fine one my iPhone 7s, but it is disconnected often on my iMac. Both are in the same room. My TP Link Archer A7 is in another room that is literally 15 steps away. It is driving me nuts.\n\nI am seeing this same behavior on my\n\nTP-Link AX6000 and on my iPhone 12 Pro with iOS15. It is driving me insane.\n\nWorks fine right after connecting to the networking, however after some idle time if I go back the only way I can get network connectivity is by toggling WiFi on and off. The network remains connected but doesn't have actual internet access and no other devices seem to have this issue aside from Apple devices running iOS15."
