When you get to the screen on the computer that asks if you want to restore a backup, that means activation was successful. You cannot trade in the iPad with activation lock enabled. All trade-in services refuse to take locked devices.\n\nReactions: hooptyuber\n\nhooptyuber\n\nmacrumors regular\n\nJan 21, 2017\n\n227\n\n306\n\nJun 6, 2023\n\n#24\n\nThe process iStorm referenced above removes activation lock, correct? I removed the iPad from my Apple account on my Mac. I ran the recovery process on the iPad a couple of times and get the multilingual “hello” greeting so I'm hoping that took care of it."
