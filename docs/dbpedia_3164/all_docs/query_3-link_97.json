        "text": "I have multiple iPhones, iPads, and various Mac computers on my account sharing the same iCloud identity. The iPhones have separate carrier accounts and all of the iPads are also carrier enabled. All of the devices get used due to various dedicated working locations, testing, travel (hotspot, national vs international, etc), workstations in the field, and numerous other situations.\n\nI'm routinely getting notifications for new devices being added, and similar queries, that are already on my network. Worst, the notifications come for each affected service: iCloud account, iMessage, Facetime, etc. I know my situation is somewhat unique being a one-man-operation, but it's still frustrating that I have to keep re-adding the same devices over and over and over again.\n\nIt also routinely pops up when I'm in the middle of something time critical and forces me to go through the second factor authentication if I choose Allow.\n\nI understand the intent of this security process for normal users, but would love any input on how to disable or dramatically lengthen these.\n\nI got this when I changed my iPhone - so quite sensible. I also seem to get it every time one of my devices installs a software update. As I have at least 3 Macs online at any time (sometimes more), and an iPhone and an iPad, all of which are set to auto-install security updates (they ask before installing major releases) then that can be a lot of messages - and because the updates are automatic I don't know in advance when to expect such a message.\n\nThe problem for me is that because these messages are so frequent they have become just a routine irritation, and they no longer alert me to a potential intrusion on my network. Given that it is perfectly feasible for the system to check whether or not there really is a \"new\" device on the network (by checking hardware serial numbers, for example, and possibly also checking the time the device was last seen on the network) then the frequency of these false alerts could - and should, for reasons of security! - be much reduced, and for installing minor OS updates they should be eliminated entirely. For a company normally so careful about security, Apple have really dropped the ball here."
