        "text": "My first time exploring the world of IoT and the technology the powers it. Playing around with the newly introduced AirTag after opening it up revealed a common theme.\n\nBackground: Apple AirTag is designed to be attached to keys, bags, wallets, or whatever items you want. The smart tag is an IoT device. Air tags are paired with an iPhone or iPad. They represent part of the find my app functionality. After the successful set, users can see the tag’s location automatically inside the find by an app, but how does it happen. Let’s delve into the technologies that make this happen:\n\nBluetooth Low Energy (LE)\n\nThese devices communicate using low-power radio waves on a frequency band between 2.400 GHz and 2.483.5 GHz. Tags are equipped with Bluetooth chips and tiny speakers, they send short range Bluetooth signals containing a unique encrypted ID, the paired device obtains these signals and identifies the trackers location. So, if the tag is nearby. Users can either play sound via the app, or ask Siri to locate it with a sound alert when the tag is lost or stolen.\n\nNear-field communication (NFC) aka Crowd GPS\n\nThe tags use the help of the crowd of people using the same Bluetooth location chip app, it means that anyone who has an Apple device can pick up the trackers Bluetooth signals, then this device sends the tag’s ID, and its current location to the central server, the server, in its turn, forwards, a notification with the last tax location to its owner. In 2021, Apple reached 1.65 billion active devices worldwide. It is a massive digital network. So, the likelihood that someone will be close enough to receive your tax signal is really high.\n\nUltra Wideband range aka Precision Finding\n\nThe IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) developed a UWB standard called 802.15.4 more than 15 years ago, but it didn’t catch on for its original intended use, sending data fast. UWB’s renaissance is occurring because its super-short radio pulses let computers calculate distances very precisely.\n\niPhones with the U1 chip provides Ultra Wideband (UWB) connectivity that, in conjunction with Internet of Things (IoT) technology, could offers “spatial awareness” — the ability for your phone to recognize its surroundings and the objects in it. It takes advantage of the phone’s camera, gyroscope, accelerometer and AR kit. Apple last year began to give third-party developers access to its U1 chip, which uses UWB technology to make the iPhone spatially aware, via its “NearbyInteraction” framework.\n\nUWB calculates locations to within less than a half inch by measuring how long it takes super-short radio pulses to travel between devices. When UWB isn’t in range, a Bluetooth connection means AirTags tap into Apple’s Find My system, which lets other people’s devices discover your AirTag’s location and share it privately with you.\n\nConclusion"
