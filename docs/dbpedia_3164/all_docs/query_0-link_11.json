Contact your carrier for more information.\n\nIf you can't set up your eSIM\n\nCheck with your carrier to see if your iPhone plan is eligible for Dual SIM service.\n\nIf you have an enterprise or corporate cellular service plan, check with your company or carrier to see if they support this feature.\n\nMake sure that your carriers support coverage in your area and that there are no service outages.\n\nMake sure that your cellular plans are set up, ready to use, and don’t have a billing-related blockage.\n\nIf you still can't set up your eSIM, contact your carriers for support.\n\nIf you don't see one or both cellular plans\n\nYou should see both of your plans when you go to Settings > Cellular or Settings > Mobile Data. Here's what to do if you don't.\n\nIf you're on a call and see No Service on your other line\n\nYour iPhone can use one cellular data network at a time. When you're using one line to make a call, your other line shows No Service. If your carrier supports Wi-Fi Calling on your other phone number and you have Wi-Fi Calling turned on, you can answer incoming calls on that number. When you're on a call that isn't your default data line, you need to turn on Allow Cellular Data Switching.\n\nStill need help?"
