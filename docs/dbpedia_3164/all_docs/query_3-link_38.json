        "text": "The Geode is designed to provide industry-standard NMEA-0183 messages via Bluetooth® to all of the major operating systems in use today. Designed to be \"open,\" the Geode works with the majority of apps used for GIS, field mapping, and GPS data collection.\n\nAlong with our Uinta Data Collection software, popular applications used with the Geode include: ESRI Field maps for ArcGIS, ESRI Survey123 for ArcGIS, ArcPad, MapIt GIS, EZTag CE, Avenza Maps, iForm, Fulcrum, OnX, SW Maps, GPS Fields Area Measure, Cybertracker, Carlson SurvCE and Juniper Systems Aspect - to name a few. Learn more about these applications and more here.\n\nThe Geode Connect app can serve as the \"location service provider\" in instances where apps rely on the operating system to deliver location information.\n\nSome modern apps are not able to connect to an external device and read NMEA messages natively, or they rely on the operating system to deliver location data. Along with the industry-standard NMEA-0183 message format, the Geode Connect for Android app can serve as a \"mock location provider\" to deliver the GNSS data from the Geode to the operating system. This allows other applications to capture higher accuracy data than is achievable through the location device in a smartphone or tablet.\n\nAll Geode GNS3 models come with multi-GNSS enabled.\n\nUsers can purchase a GPS-only Geode or a multi-GNSS configuration. The multi-GNSS configuration is able to track and use satellite data from GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou satellite constellations. This provides the ability to use over 100 satellites orbiting the Earth - along with SBAS corrections from several different regional providers, network-based DGNSS corrections from CORS/RTK networks, and Atlas L-Band corrections for worldwide corrections with multiple accuracy levels.\n\nWhen tracking four or more GPS satellites and with a fixed SBAS correction signal, the Geode can achieve 30 cm horizontal accuracy (RMS root mean square) with 67 percent probability. That’s just under one foot.\n\nFor Atlas enabled Geode receivers there are three accuracy levels available. Atlas Basic (50 cm), Atlas H30 (30 cm), and Atlas H10 (10 cm). These are 95 percent accuracy estimates.\n\nThe Geode can also calculate a RTK float solution when used with RTK/ CORS/ NTRIP networks. Delivering 25-30 cm typical accuracy (RMS 68%). Multi-Frequency models can achieve up to 15 cm accuracy in good conditions (68%).\n\nAccuracy may vary relative to observation conditions, multipath environment, number of satellites in view, satellite geometry, and ionospheric activity\n\nGeode Connect is a simple utility app designed to make the Geode easy to use. Geode Connect provides the user with the ability to easily establish a Bluetooth® connection with their handheld device, report position information of the Geode, and provide access to the most accessed user settings.\n\nThe Geode also works with our Uinta mapping software for those who need a data-collection solution.\n\nGeode Connect is not a data collection or GIS/Mapping app, but a configuration utility for the Geode. Juniper Systems partners with several software developers who offer mapping applications used with the Geode.\n\nGeode Connect is free for download from the Juniper Systems website and various app stores.\n\nThe Geode is designed for the most common professional GIS mapping use cases where 1-2 ft. of accuracy is required. The Geode can provide greater accuracy in special use cases (short baseline post-processing).\n\nGPS receivers that provide centimeter or less accuracy are often designed for specific use cases within the land surveying industry. The Geode's accuracy-to-price ratio is the economic sweet spot for most professional GIS mapping use cases where submeter, subfoot, or decimeter (4inch) accuracy is required.\n\nThe price of the Geode ranges based on the configuration needed for each use case. By filling out our contact us form here, we'll be able to better understand your needs and get you a price on the configuration that best fits your needs.\n\nGNS3 uses Overtime Technology™ designed to give you a full day use in the field. The battery runs about 10 or more hours on multi-frequency models.\n\nBecause of the improved processor and receiver engine, the single frequency has even more battery life,, they will run for up to 16 hours.\n\nGNS3 has a USB Type-C port which reduces charging time and provides compatibility with the latest devices.\n\nAtlas is a worldwide, real-time satellite-based (“L-Band”) broadcast subscription correction service. With the Atlas correction service, users can achieve various levels of positioning accuracy, almost anywhere on the Earth (from 75 degrees North to South). The Geode, when enabled with Atlas Tracking and an active Atlas Activation or Subscription, receives the Atlas correction service from the Atlas geostationary satellites, and over time calculates a “converged” correction it’s GNSS position. Once “convergence” is achieved, the receiver will deliver Sub-meter (50 cm), Sub-Foot (30 cm) or Decimeter (10 cm) accuracy, depending on the subscription applied."
