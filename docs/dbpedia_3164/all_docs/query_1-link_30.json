        "text": "Along with the Apple Watch, the iPad family of devices took center stage at the September 2020 Apple Event. Apple revealed the eighth generation of iPads, as well as a new iPad Air 4. When detailing the iPad Air, it was confirmed that the devices will use a USB-C cable instead of the Lightning connector that Apple uses across many of their other devices.\n\nWhile most Apple devices use the Lightning cable for charging and connection, a small handful have opted for other methods. The iPad Pros have also supported USB-C. The first three iPad Air devices all fell in line with the Lightning cable, but that seems to be changing with the upcoming fourth generation. The iPad Air 4 looks inspired by the design of the iPad Pro, so the switch makes sense.\n\nThe switch to USB-C will be convenient for many users, as USB cords are simply more common than Apple’s family-exclusive Lightning cables. Many third-party devices already use USB-C, meaning the iPad Air 4 will likely be more compatible with other devices without the use of a dongle or connector. This shouldn’t be taken as a sign that Apple is planning to slowly ditch the Lightning cable entirely, rather just a result of available resources and design choices specific to the new generation of iPad Airs."
