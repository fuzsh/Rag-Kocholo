        "text": "Charge and connect with the USB-C port on your iPad\n\nUse the versatile USB-C port on your iPad to charge, connect to accessories like external storage devices, cameras, and displays, and power other devices.\n\nWhat you need\n\nYou need an iPad model that has a USB-C port:\n\niPad Pro (M4)\n\niPad Pro 11-inch (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation)\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th generation)\n\niPad Air (M2)\n\niPad Air (4th or 5th generation)\n\niPad mini (6th generation)\n\nCharge your iPad\n\nTo charge your iPad, connect the included USB-C cable to the device's USB-C port and to a compatible power adapter. Then plug the adapter into a wall outlet.\n\nIf you have a higher-wattage USB-C power adapter—such as the one that came with your Mac laptop—you can use it with your iPad for faster charging. You can also charge your iPad by connecting it to the USB-C port on your computer.\n\nConnect iPad to your Mac or other computer\n\nYou can connect iPad to your Mac or PC to charge the device or sync content using iTunes or the Finder.*\n\nFirst, identify the ports on your computer. If your computer is a more recent model that has a USB-C port, use the USB-C cable that came with your iPad.\n\nIf your computer has only USB-A ports, you need a USB-A to USB-C cable to connect to your iPad. One example is the mophie USB-A Cable with USB-C Connector; many other USB-certified brands available in your country or region might also work. The correct cable has connectors that look like this:\n\nConnect to displays and monitors\n\nThe USB-C port on your iPad connects to external displays so that you can watch video, play Keynote presentations, and more on a larger screen. Depending on the display that you're connecting to, you might need an adapter.\n\nWhen you connect an external display, it shows what you see on the built-in display of your iPad, unless you're using an app that has a second-screen experience (such as a video app).\n\nUSB-C displays\n\nYour iPad uses the DisplayPort protocol to support connections to USB-C displays1 with these resolutions:\n\nUp to 4K for iPad Air (4th generation) and iPad mini (6th generation)\n\nUp to 5K for iPad Pro 11-inch (1st and 2nd generation), and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd and 4th generation)\n\nUp to 6K for iPad Pro (M4), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd and 4th generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th and 6th generation), iPad Air (M2), and iPad Air (5th generation) with Pro Display XDR\n\niPad Pro (M4), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th and 6th generation), and iPad Air (M2) also support Thunderbolt displays.\n\nTo connect your iPad to high-resolution displays, use a USB-C cable that supports high-bandwidth connections, such as the cable included with the display, the Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Cable (USB-C to USB-C), or the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) Cable (sold separately).2\n\nYour iPad also supports high-dynamic-range USB-C displays that use the HDR10 standard. You can switch between SDR and HDR modes by going to Settings > Display & Brightness and selecting your connected display. Your iPad matches the frame rate and dynamic range of currently playing content when you turn on Allow Display Mode Changes.\n\nSome USB-C displays can also charge your iPad while it's connected.\n\n1. iPad Pro 11-inch (1st and 2nd generation), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd and 4th generation), and iPad Air (5th generation) support the 2019 LG UltraFine 5K Display at 4K resolution with video, audio, data, and power. These iPad models don't support Thunderbolt displays such as the 2016 LG UltraFine 5K Display.\n\n2. The Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) Cable has a Thunderbolt symbol to distinguish it from a USB-C cable.\n\nHDMI displays or TVs\n\nYou can connect your iPad to an HDMI display or TV with a USB-C to HDMI adapter. Adapters that support HDMI 2.0 can output video from iPad Pro and iPad Air (5th generation) at 4K resolution and 60Hz, while iPad Air (4th generation) and iPad mini (6th generation) can output video at 4K resolution and 30Hz.\n\nThe Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter is also compatible with iPad. This adapter can output video from iPad Pro and iPad Air (5th generation) up to 4K resolution and 60Hz,* while iPad Air (4th generation) and iPad mini (6th generation) can output video up to 4K resolution and 30Hz.\n\nYour iPad can output Dolby Digital Plus audio streams via HDMI, but not Dolby Atmos. Also note that your iPad will play HDR10 or Dolby Vision content via HDMI when HDMI 2.0 adapters that support these formats become available.\n\n* When you use the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter with your iPad, its Home Screen and apps appear on HDMI displays at 1080p and 60Hz. When you begin playing video content, the resolution switches to match the content, up to 4K at 60Hz. Turn on the Match Content option on your iPad in Settings > Displays.\n\nPlay audio\n\nTo play audio on your iPad, you can use its built-in speakers, connect to AirPods or other Bluetooth devices, or use AirPlay. You can also use the USB-C port to connect to USB-C docks, displays, audio interfaces, or wired headphones that have a USB-C connector.\n\nIf you need to play audio through the USB-C port to other speakers or headphones, connect using the Apple USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter (sold separately).\n\nConnect to other devices\n\nThe USB-C port on your iPad allows connections to a variety of devices.* For example, you can connect a digital camera or the Apple USB-C to SD Card Reader to import photos. Other USB devices that you can connect to your iPad include these:\n\nExternal storage devices\n\nHubs and docks\n\nKeyboards\n\nAudio interfaces and MIDI devices\n\nUSB to Ethernet adapters\n\nUse an adapter\n\nDepending on the device, you might need an adapter. Here are some common connections:\n\nIf the device that you're connecting to has a USB-C port, all you need is a cable with USB-C connectors on each end, such as the cable that came with your iPad.\n\nIf the device has a USB-C connector, you can plug it directly into the iPad Pro USB-C port.\n\nIf the device has a USB-A connector, you can plug it into the Apple USB-C to USB adapter, then plug the adapter intothe USB-C port of your iPad.\n\nThunderbolt and USB 4\n\niPad Pro (M4), iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation) and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th and 6th generation) also support a wide ecosystem of high-performance Thunderbolt and USB 4 accessories. Some accessories can request higher power from your iPad, which might affect battery life. To extend battery life, remember to disconnect these accessories from iPad Pro when you aren't using them. Refer to your accessory manufacturer's specifications for more information.\n\nUse your iPad to charge other devices\n\nAway from a power outlet and need to charge your iPhone, other iPad, Apple Watch, or third-party USB device? Just connect the right cable or adapter to your iPad to share its long-lasting battery with your other devices:\n\nTo charge your iPhone or earlier-model iPad that has a Lightning port, connect it to your iPad using the Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable (1 m). If you have a Lightning to USB cable, you can combine it with the Apple USB-C to USB Adapter, then connect the adapter to your iPad.\n\nIf you have two iPad models with USB-C ports, you can connect them directly with a USB-C cable. One iPad will draw power from the other. If you want to change which iPad charges, unplug the USB-C cable and then reconnect them.\n\nCharge your Apple Watch by connecting its Magnetic Charging Cable to your iPad via the Apple USB-C to USB Adapter. If you have an Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable, you can connect it directly to your iPad."
