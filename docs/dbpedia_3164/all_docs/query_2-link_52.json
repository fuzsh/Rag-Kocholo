        "text": "Not everyone is hooked into Apple's ecosystem, which is why the best iPad alternatives are a fantastic way to get similar performance while using Google or Windows accounts. These tablets offer similar functionality, comparable specs and good apps, and often cost less.\n\nWe've tested and reviewed every iPad, and we've reviewed a lot of their alternatives too, so we're in a good position to compare the options and pick out the best iPad alternatives for different needs. Below, I pick our favourites, including high-end options, tablets with that run desktop software, budget alternatives and even a specialist iPad alternative for drawing, including models from Samsung, Microsoft and more.\n\nThe closest alternatives to iPad are Samsung's tablets, and you can find the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra at No.2 on my list. To get the lowdown on how these range compares to Apple's read our iPad vs Samsung explainer. If you are still considering an iPad, or want to compare the specs of these against those of Apple tablets, see our full iPad generations list for details of all the current models.\n\nQuick list\n\nThe best iPad alternatives in full\n\nThe best iPad alternative overall\n\nMicrosoft's Surface Pro 9 tops our list as the best iPad alternative, and indeed the best iPad Pro alternative if you go for the Intel i7 version (avoid the SQ3 5G variant unless you really need that connectivity). We found the latest Surface Pro to have a convincingly Apple-like high-end feel, with a stand that feels solid and well-designed – it's true competition for the best iPad for drawing.\n\nThe best thing about this tablet is that it runs Windows, allowing us to use fully fledged desktop software. And it has to the power for it too. We found that the i7 16GB RAM configuration handled most of what we hit it with, and was easily able to run multiple programs at once, although it did start to stutter under complex 4K video editing in Davinci Pro, but, hey, this is a tablet with integrated graphics.\n\nWe liked the PixelSense screen for watching films and photo editing, and the sketching experience was nice with the Surface Slim Pen (sold separately). The the 10MP camera can follow you around a room, much like Apple's Centre Stage feature. Add on the Type Cover keyboard and you effectively have a compact hybrid laptop (just note that like the stylus, the Type Cover is sold separately).\n\nRead our full hands-on Microsoft Surface Pro 9 review for more details.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nThe Android iPad Pro alternative\n\nAt 14.6-inches, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra is larger than the biggest iPad Pro, but it's still slim and portable. When we reviewed it, we found the power and performance to be impressive, making it a compelling option as a tablet for work. Meanwhile, the AMOLED screen technology made for an impressively rich display for watching films or creating digital art.\n\nWe appreciate the fact that the S Pen ships in the box, so we don't have to buy a stylus as an extra like with iPads or the Surface Pro. Overall the stylus experience is smooth, if not quite as seamless as that of the Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro.\n\nOf course, the downside is that you're limited to Android apps. There's no shortage of apps in the Play store but some creatives may miss things like Adobe's iOS apps. Compared with an iPad Pro, the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra is a pretty hefty tablet, and if you're going to carry it around you'll need a sizeable bag, but you do get more screen space to work on.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nThe best iPad alternative for drawing\n\nWhile you can use an iPad for digital painting, and the iPad Pro, in particular, is a great choice, it's not designed specifically for creating art. In steps the Magic Pad, billed as the first dedicated portable drawing tablet. Most drawing tablets can only be used to draw, but the Magic Pad runs Android OS. It can play games, take photos, play music. It's basically XPPen's fantastic drawing tablet tech put into a mobile tablet.\n\nThe 2160 x 1440 resolution, anti-glare etched display is slightly flexible, so it reacts more to your sketching and pen strokes than the rigid screen of an iPad. We particularly liked the XPPen X3 Pro Pencil, which offers 16,000 levels of pen pressure, the same as XPPen's desktop pen displays and more than iPad (Apple keeps its specs secret but we estimate that Apple Pencil 2 provide around 8,000 pressure levels).\n\nIn our XPPen Magic Drawing Pad review, we found this to be a joy to sketch on. It is notably less powerful than an iPad Pro, but it's a good deal cheaper (and cheaper even than an iPad Air). Since it runs on Android, you're limited to the best drawing apps for Android, but the are now some great options, such as ArtRage Vitae and ibisPaint X, both of which come pre-installed.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nThe best laptop iPad alternative\n\nSo this isn't actually a tablet, but we think this 2-in-1 laptop with tablet mode is so light and portable that it qualifies as an iPad alternative. The keyboard flips nicely over on its hinges, allowing us to quickly swap to tablet mode and use the Zenbook Flip just as we would an iPad. It also has a handy 'tent' mode that allows it to free-stand – perfect for streaming.\n\nIn our review, we found a lot to love about it. The QHD OLED touchscreen has great colours (100% of the sRGB , 99.9% of DCI P3 and 97.4% of Adobe RGB) and deep blacks, and the 90Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth experience for drawing.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Zenbook Flip pushes 1.5kg, so it's not the lightest iPad alternative to tote around. The lack of a side power button in tablet mode can also be a little annoying. Read our full ASUS Zenbook 14x Flip review for more details.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest basic iPad alternative\n\nThis offering from Lenovo takes on the standard iPad in terms of cost and performance. It isn't quite as fast as the standard iPad, but it is cheaper, and performance and battery life were sound in our tests.\n\nA panel attaches to the back of the tablet to form a stand, and there's even a little nook for a stylus to slot in neatly, and charge. Bear in mind that this tablet doesn't support LTE, which means you can't connect to the internet without a WiFi connection – a pain if you work a lot on the go. Overall, though, this is a solid tablet at a great price. If you liked the look of the iPad Mini but want something cheaper, it's definitely worth considering.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nThe best budget iPad alternative\n\nIf you're looking for an iPad alternative that offers unique specs, a focused use and won't break the bank, then the Lenovo Tab P12 with Matte Display is a good option. The standout features of this Lenovo variant model are the large 3K matte display, ideal for note-taking and e-reading, as well as offering support for the best Android apps and Lenovo's keyboard and stylus.\n\nYou'll also find this iPad alt on our best tablets with a stylus for drawing and note-taking because it's ideally designed for both uses, much like the iPad. Unlike Apple's tablet, this Lenovo isn't expensive. At just £449.99 for an 8GB RAM model it's a steal, the Matte finish is not yet available in the US but the non-Matte edition costs just $347.88 with a stylus and case.\n\nThe downside, as expected at this price and as raised by our reviewer, is the MediaTek CPU lacks power and the battery life can sap fast in heavy use. But it's fine for everyday use, such as web browsing, streaming and notes.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nThe best compact iPad alternative\n\nThis tablet from Amazon doesn't exactly rival any of the iPads in terms of functionality, but if just need something that enables you to browse the web and stream content, the Fire 7 tablet is a very cheap and cheerful solution.\n\nYou won't be able to run all the apps you're used to, as neither the Google Play Store nor Apple's App Store are supported, but Amazon does have its own alternatives. The camera isn't really up to much, especially compared to Apple's offerings, but again, you get what you pay for, and you're not paying an awful lot for this budget iPad alternative.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nHow to choose the best iPad alternatives\n\nWhen choosing the best iPad alternatives, the first thing to do is to establish what you're going to use it for, as this will determine which features you need. If you're just going to be using the tablet for a light browsing and maybe some streaming, your needs will be different than if you are planning on using the tablet as your main work tool and need to run resource-intensive apps. Once that's established, here are some criteria to consider.\n\nScreen size: The size of a tablets screen is expressed in inches, referring to the diagonal distance between two corners. So, a 14-inch tablet means a tablet with 14 inches between the top left and the bottom right of the screen. A larger screen gives you more space to work with – useful for creative work and great for watching movies. However, it also means the tablet is physically larger and heavier, which impacts portability.\n\nScreen resolution: The higher the screen resolution, the more detail it is able to display and the better your content will look.\n\nScreen brightness/colour: A higher level of brightness, expressed in nits, will make your screen easier to see in a variety of conditions. Generally 300 nits is acceptable, 400 nits is good and anything above 500 is excellent. You may also see reference to a screen's coverage of various colour gamuts, such as sRGB, DCI P3 and Adobe RGB, etc. The higher the percentage of these spaces, the richer and more accurate colours a screen can display.\n\nStylus compatibility: If you're planning on drawing or doing other creative work on a tablet, having a compatible active stylus like the Apple Pencil is a must.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nHow we test the best iPad alternatives\n\nAt Creative Bloq, we regularly review tablets from a range of different manufacturers. We will spend a significant amount of time with any tablet we review, and test it against a series of benchmarks designed to assess how well it performs.\n\nWe run different productivity apps, creative programs, browsers and games on the tablet (where possible) to see how well it is able to cope with such tasks. We look at screen quality, measuring brightness and refresh rate. We try out any compatible accessories available to us such as styluses and stands, and we also look at the physical design of the tablet to assess whether it is convenient to use, easy to carry and robustly constructed.\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are the best iPad alternatives for drawing?\n\niPads have been gaining popularity as drawing tablets for amateurs and professionals alike – but many are understandably put off by the cost, especially when you consider the extra $100 or so for an Apple Pencil.\n\nThere are plenty of tablets that can work as iPad alternatives for drawing – the key is to make sure you get one with an active stylus. This means a stylus that can communicate with the tablet electronically (rather than essentially being a pointed stick), and can therefore offer vital artistic features like pressure sensitivity, palm rejection and tilt sensitivity.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab range is a good place to start, and we like the XPPen Magic Drawing Pad since this was made specifically with drawing in mind. If you specifically want a dedicated device for drawing without other features, see our guide to the best drawing tablets.\n\nWhat is a good iPad alternative for toddlers?\n\nKids love tablets – but you may not want to give them something as expensive and breakable as an iPad. There are plenty of kid-friendly tablets out there that offer features like parental control settings and content restrictions. Amazon's Fire Kids range is a great place to start, offering a number of tablets specifically designed for little ones.\n\nAre Android tablets a good alternative to iPads?\n\nAbsolutely! While the Android interface still isn't as smooth and well-integrated on tablets as Apple's iOS, the Android ecosystem offers a level of choice and customisability that Apple simply can't match.\n\nWhat are the best iPad alternatives for students?\n\nStudent life can be very busy, rushing between classes, often with commutes and studying at several different locations, so it’s important to have an alternative that is lightweight and super portable. For this we’d recommend a hybrid tablet such as the Surface Pro 9, which is an excellent all-rounder to fulfil any students needs, with a system that allows for smooth studying, a PixelSense screen perfect for gaming and streaming, and a 10MP camera for those online seminars and study groups."
