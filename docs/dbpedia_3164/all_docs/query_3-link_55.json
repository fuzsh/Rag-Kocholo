        "text": "There are times when your Wi-Fi network just can’t provide the connection to the internet you need. Perhaps you are at work and the office Wi-Fi just can’t cope with all the iPads and iPhones accessing it so it slows your browsing to a crawl (or your boss decides to change the password for the same reason).\n\nMaybe you are in a hotel and can’t connect all your devices to the room’s Wi-Fi at once. Or possibly you want to allow someone onto your Wi-Fi but you don’t want to give away the password.\n\nOr perhaps it’s the end of the month and you are running out of data. You don’t have to stop surfing! It’s easy to create a hotspot from your Mac and share your connection with other devices via Wi-Fi, and here’s where we show you how.\n\nBefore we do, the update to macOS Ventura has brought with it some changes to how this works, so we will show both methods below. Skip to the next section if you aren’t running Ventura.\n\nHow to share Wi-Fi from Mac to iPhone (in macOS Ventura)\n\nHow to share Wi-Fi from Mac to iPhone (pre macOS Ventura)\n\nIf you haven’t yet installed Ventura, or your Mac isn’t compatible with the 2022 version of macOS, here are the steps you meed to follow.\n\nOpen System Preferences and select Sharing. If you don’t see the below screen, click on the icon showing 12 dots.\n\nClick on Sharing.\n\nNow click on the box beside Internet Sharing.\n\nBeside ‘Share your connection from:’ choose Ethernet.\n\nBelow that, beside ‘To computers using:’ choose Wi-Fi.\n\nNext click Wi-Fi Options, this will give you the option to choose a password so that strangers can’t jump on your Wi-Fi (it should be least eight characters). Next to Security choose WPA2 Personal and then enter your Password and verify it. (WPA2 is the 802.11i standard for encryption.)\n\nNow click on the box beside Internet Sharing.\n\nConfirm that you want to turn on Internet sharing by clicking Start.\n\nYou have now created a Wi-Fi hotspot using your Mac. Note that where you would normally see that you had a Wi-Fi signal, now you see an icon with an arrow indicating that you are sharing your connection.\n\nHow to join the Hotspot you have created\n\nNow that you have set up your hotspot you will be able to join the network you have created on your Mac from your other devices.\n\nHow to join the Hotspot from your iPad or iPhone\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad go to Settings > Wi-Fi.\n\nSelect the network you just created.\n\nEnter the password you set and you are good to go.\n\nHow to join the Hotspot from another Mac\n\nTo add a second Mac to your Wi-Fi hotspot click on the Wi-Fi icon at the top of the screen.\n\nSelect the name of the Wi-Fi hotspot you wish to join.\n\nNow enter the password for that Wi-Fi network.\n\nHow to create a Mac Wi-Fi hotspot without Ethernet\n\nBut what if you don’t have an Ethernet connection, perhaps your MacBook doesn’t have an Ethernet port and you don’t fancy getting an adaptor, let alone plugging into a wired connection?\n\nUnfortunately your Mac cannot share an internet connection from Wi-Fi using Wi-Fi… unless you have an additional accessory.\n\nWhile the Mac’s built-in networking card can either connect to Wi-Fi or host its own network, users can buy a Wi-Fi network adapter that should allow one network interface to receive the Wi-Fi connection while the other re-broadcasts it. You could use a USB Wifi Adapter dongle such as this: $16.99 from Amazon or £9.99 from Amazon UK.\n\nOnce the Wi-Fi adapter has been plugged in and installed, follow the above instructions and select one of your two Wi-Fi adapters instead of the Ethernet connection used in step 3 above.\n\nHow to share internet from Mac to iPhone via Bluetooth\n\nBut what about if you don’t want to fork out for a Wi-Fi network adapter? There is another option, although it won’t be as fast as Wi-Fi and may not be compatible with as many devices. That’s because, instead of using Wi-Fi to share the internet connection with your other devices, it’ll be using Bluetooth; or, more specifically, Bluetooth PAN (Personal Area Network).\n\nThe initial connection to devices will take longer due to the Bluetooth pairing process, but is a free alternative when looking to share your internet connection from Wi-Fi and it should work with most smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe setup is the same as if you were sharing via Wi-Fi (see the steps above), but make sure you select Bluetooth PAN in the “To computers using” box when confronted with the Configure an internet-sharing network.\n\nTo join the Bluetooth network from your iPhone, follow these steps:\n\nMake sure that your Mac has Bluetooth turned on.\n\nOn your iPhone go to Settings >Bluetooth and make sure Bluetooth is turned on.\n\nNow go to Settings > Cellular Data (or Mobile Data) and tap on Personal Hotspot.\n\nNow you need to pair your iPhone with your computer. Open up the Bluetooth pane in System Preferences and scroll down until you see your iPhone, then click on Connect.\n\nA code will appear on both of your devices, click on Pair on your iPhone to pair both devices. Tap Pair and enter the code shown on your computer.\n\nNow you should see a blue Bluetooth icon in the top left of your iPhone screen indicating the devices are connected.\n\nOn your Mac the usual symbol showing Wi-Fi will show an arrow.\n\nOn your iPhone go to Wi-Fi and find the Mac you want to link to.\n\nOn your iPhone you will see the option to join the Personal Hotspot, tap on Join.\n\nEnter the password if you set one."
