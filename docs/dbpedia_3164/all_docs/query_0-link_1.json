        "text": "On models that support eSIM, you can activate the cellular service from your iPad. You may also be able to travel abroad with iPad and sign up for cellular service with a local carrier in the country or region you’re visiting.\n\nNote: eSIM isn’t available in all countries and regions, and not all carriers are supported.\n\nGo to Settings > Cellular Data.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nSet up the first cellular plan on your iPad: Select a carrier, then follow the onscreen instructions.\n\nAdd another cellular plan: Tap Add a New Plan.\n\nScan a QR code provided by a carrier: Tap Other, then position iPad so that the QR code provided by your carrier appears in the frame, or enter the details manually. You may be asked to enter a confirmation code provided by your carrier.\n\nAlternatively, you can activate your cellular plan through your carrier’s app (if supported). Go to the App Store, download your carrier’s app, then use the app to purchase a cellular plan.\n\nYou can store more than one eSIM on your iPad, but you can use only one eSIM at a time. To switch to another eSIM, go to Settings > Cellular Data, then tap the plan you want to use (below SIMs)."
