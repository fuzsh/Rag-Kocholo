        "text": "Friends star Courteney Cox has dropped her actor husband's last name from her moniker, but that doesn't mean there is trouble in her three-year marriage, explains the actress in a new interview.\n\nSpeaking to this month's In Style magazine, the popular TV actress reveals she has reverted to her maiden name out of respect for her father Richard Cox, who died of cancer last year. \"When I was a kid, I wanted to change my name so badly because I didn't like it,\" she says. \"Now that my dad's gone, I don't want to lose it.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old star denies rumours that her decision indicates trouble in her marriage to her Scream co-star David Arquette. \"It's not an issue for David,\" she says. \"I am an Arquette, but I'm also a Coxâ€¦ And when we have children they will not be Cox-Arquettes, they will be Arquettes.\"\n\nThough all is well in her marriage, Courteney admits that she thought David was \"way too wild\" when they first met. One of the actress' longtime friends volunteers: \"He's probably more a live-for-the-moment type and she really thinks about the future. But he is nuts about her, and she is nuts about him. They balance each other out.\""
