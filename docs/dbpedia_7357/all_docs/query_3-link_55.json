        "text": "Ben Affleck\n\nBen Affleck's full name is Ben Géza Affleck-Boldt and he has a wonderful story as to why he was given his middle name.\n\nBen told the Boston Herald: \"My mom told me that Géza was a friend of hers who died around the time I was born. He was a Holocaust survivor from Hungary and he was the most exceptional person she knew. He had leapt from a train during the Holocaust taking Jews to the death camps, and he went back to save several other people to try to break them out.\n\n\"She told me 6 million Jews were murdered and that men like him, brave and selfless, were what stood between us and the evil that people were capable of doing to one another. That name has never been anything short of a tremendous honor to me since that day. I came to understand and better identify with the suffering of others.\"\n\nYou may know Kiefer Sutherland from TV shows like 24 and Designated Survivor but what you may not know is that his full name is Kiefer William Frederick Dempsey George Rufus Sutherland!\n\nApparently, Kiefer is after Warren Kiefer, who wrote his father's first TV role in England. William is a middle name. Dempsey is Kiefer's mother's mother's maiden name. Frederick is his father's father's first name. George was his father's best friend George Metcalfe and Rufus remains a mystery!"
