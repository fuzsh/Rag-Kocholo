        "text": "Courteney Cox’s 18-year-old daughter, Coco Arquette, looked all grown up as she accompanied her mom to the “Scream VI” premiere in New York City on Monday night.\n\nCox and Coco hit the red carpet at the AMC Lincoln Square Theater, where they were seen posing for photos together.\n\nCoco, the daughter of Cox and her ex-husband David Arquette, stunned in a corseted red midi dress and black platform sandals.\n\nMeanwhile, the 58-year-old “Friends” actress looked chic in a black blazer layered over a clingy LBD, opaque tights and slingback pumps.\n\nThe mother-daughter-duo sweetly held hands while flashing nearly identical smiles for shutterbugs.\n\nOther A-listers in attendance at the movie premiere included Demi Lovato, Hayden Panettiere and Jenna Ortega.\n\nThe “Cougar Town” alum and Coco appear to have a close relationship, and even got matching tattoos in January.\n\nAnd last June, Coco’s “proud” mom marked her 18th birthday with a sweet message on Instagram.\n\n“You are courageous, smart, deep, funny, unique and beautiful with the biggest heart,” Cox wrote at the time. “I can’t wait to see what’s next. I love you x.”\n\nCourteney and David, who divorced in 2013, welcomed Coco in June 2004. The actress had struggled with fertility issues for years and suffered multiple miscarriages before welcoming their daughter.\n\n“It was really weird because everyone in my family has kids,” she told NBC News in May 2004. “I mean, they pop out like it’s nobody’s business. No one in my family has a problem. So to me, I just thought this would not be a problem at all.”\n\nShe also shared how her struggle to conceive had affected her work on “Friends.”\n\n“I remember one time I just had a miscarriage and Rachel [Jennifer Aniston’s character] was giving birth. It was, like, that same time,” she said, adding, “Oh, my God, it was terrible having to be funny.”\n\nSince splitting, she and David, 51, continue to co-parent Coco and remain on good terms.\n\n“We’ve communicated a lot because of Coco,” David told Yahoo! Entertainment in August 2020.“We’ve been really open and supportive of each other.”\n\nHe added, “We never went head-to-head [or] battled each other through the process of divorce and through the process of raising our kid, so it’s made for a … relationship that is out of respect.”\n\nDavid shares sons Charlie, 8, and Augustus, 5, with his wife, 41-year-old Christina McLarty.\n\nMeanwhile, Cox has been in a relationship Johnny McDaid, 46, since 2013."
