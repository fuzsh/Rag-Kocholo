        "text": "Courteney Cox’s Dermalogica Partnership Was Decades in the Making\n\nWhen Courteney Cox launched her home care brand, Homecourt, the connection to her Friends character Monica Geller was clear. But as she enters the skincare arena as the new face of Dermalogica, only fans of the show with keen eyes and even sharper memories will pick up on this overlooked connection.\n\nCox, a longtime fan of the brand, was first introduced to the line of products while filming Friends. But it gets better. They were even used as props in Monica and Rachel’s bathroom.\n\n“There are certain products that you love because they smell great and are so natural and fresh, but I want mine to be like that and be backed by science. That’s why I’ve always loved Dermalogica,” Cox tells BAZAAR.com exclusively.\n\nAhead Cox shares her top shelf beauty picks, the skincare advice she gives to her daughter, and more of her beauty wisdom.\n\nHarper’s Bazaar\n\nCourteney Cox Reflects on ‘Friends,’ Her Career, and Yes, Prince Harry Doing Mushrooms at Her House: ‘I Definitely Wasn’t Passing Them Out’\n\nFrom the start, Courteney Cox was different. She was from Alabama — a place where, she recalls, people were steelworkers or doctors — and didn’t know anything about show business. So, she sought it out. Never in her wildest dreams did she think it’d lead her to a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, to be unveiled Feb. 27.\n\nThe summer after she graduated high school, Cox moved to New York City and began modelling.\n\n“I got a job right away and I thought, that was easy,” she recalls. Then the changes came. “It was a makeover. They took the Alabama fresh face and made a little funky style and it was really fun. They changed everything about me — they said I was Kentucky-born and they changed my last name to Myles. I don’t know why! But I never thought that when I was 18 it would lead to a career that I love and have really learned so much … I just kept doing things that led me to something else and I just kept learning and learning and learning.”\n\nShe never imagined a time when she’d land a leading role on the biggest show on TV and star in all 236 episodes. She didn’t see a time when she’d be a seven-time Screen Actors Guild Award nominee, one of which she won. Cox wasn’t aware that when she took on the part of a horror movie “bitch,” as she describes it, she’d hold on to the role for nearly three decades.\n\nBut that all happened, thanks to her hard work.\n\nContinue reading Variety Interview"
