        "text": "Arquette – who Cox shares with her ex-husband, actor David Arquette – is a first-year in university and already has almost 300 thousand followers on Instagram. This probably shouldn’t be surprising, given that she is the daughter of Hollywood royalty.\n\nBut what else do we know about her … and can we expect her to follow in her famous parents’ showbiz footsteps?\n\nCoco Arquette was a miracle baby\n\nCox has a rare gene mutation called MTHFR that makes pregnancy difficult, as it leads to miscarriages. During her 14-year marriage to Arquette from 1999 to 2013, Cox suffered through several miscarriages – all while she was still filming for Friends.\n\nCox eventually got pregnant after two rounds of IVF treatments and welcomed Coco at the age of 40.\n\nActing runs in the blood\n\nCoco’s father, David Arquette, comes from a family of actors. Her aunts are Patricia Arquette (CSI: Cyber, Medium) and Rosanna Arquette (Pulp Fiction), and her uncle is Richmond Arquette (Zodiac).\n\nShe appeared in her father’s documentary in 2020 with her aunts and uncle, You Cannot Kill David Arquette, which documents dad David’s journey back to wrestling. (Yes, that’s right, he had a brief wrestling career, too!)\n\nCoco’s mum, Cox, is of course best known as Monica Geller in Friends. Her first appearance on screen dates back to 1984, bringing her Hollywood presence to 38 years (so far).\n\nTwo of Coco’s acting credits come from her mother’s directorial forays – an episode of the TV show Cougar Town (where her mum plays the main character) and the movie, Just Before I Go.\n\nShe often makes appearances on her mum’s Instagram account, singing while Cox plays the piano.\n\nMore often than not, the mother-daughter pair are accompanied by famous artists including Ed Sheeran, Elton John, Brandi Carlile, Snow Patrol vocalist Gary Lightbody, Foy Vance and Joel Taylor, to name a few.\n\nShe’s best friends with Iris Apatow\n\nOn Iris’ birthday in October 2021, Arquette posted a shout-out to her on Instagram, and also called her “so talented it hurts” after she was filmed singing “Burn” from Hamilton.\n\nAside from her friend squad, Arquette is also besties with her mum’s beloved dogs, Lily and Bear.\n\nOf course, she’s also tight with her mum – which is definitely obvious from their social media, where they post everything from TikTok dances to embarrassing photos and clips.\n\nArquette has reportedly always had a passion for make-up and fashion and, in an episode of The Drew Barrymore Show last year, Cox explained that she didn’t mind letting her daughter experiment with hair dye and cosmetics at a young age because she deemed it a great form of self-expression.\n\nHer godmother is one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood\n\nCox and Aniston’s friendship is an open book. Everyone knows how close the two are, whether it’s in their sitcom Friends or in real life. So it was only natural that Aniston would become Arquette’s godmother. After all, Arquette was in her mum’s belly even while she was still filming the famous sitcom. The trio was often seen together on trips to the beach when Arquette was younger.\n\nIn a game of who knows who best, when Arquette was asked who she would rather date – a young Joey or Chandler – she chose Joey. Her mother’s character in the sitcom ended up with Chandler.\n\nShe’s involved in philanthropic causes\n\nArquette might be your typical Gen Z girl, but she’s also a bit of a social warrior, regularly taking part in various welfare causes. In 2019, she sang onstage for Chords2cure, a student-centric organisation raising funds for paediatric cancer research.\n\nShe also duetted with Snow Patrol vocalist Lightbody on a rendition of “Chasing Cars”. Together with her mum, the pair also attended the 15th Annual LA County Walk to Defeat ALS. And she has also been spotted at climate change rallies.\n\nAdditional reporting by Sumnima Kandangwa"
