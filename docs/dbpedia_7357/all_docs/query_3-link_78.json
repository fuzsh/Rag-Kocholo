        "text": "Actor David Arquette has spoken candidly about how his ego impacted his marriage to ex-wife Courteney Cox in a recent interview on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live.\n\nThe couple, who first met while filming the iconic 1996 horror movie Scream, tied the knot in 1999. At the time, Cox was at the height of her fame with her role on the hit sitcom Friends, which debuted in 1994.\n\nArquette admitted that Cox's success made him feel inferior, and that he struggled with his traditional male desire to provide for his family.\n\nHe explained that in the acting world, it's difficult to maintain a steady career and that when comparing himself to someone like Cox, who was at the top of the TV world, it was hard for him to feel adequate. He also acknowledged that he had a lot of \"learning\" to do to navigate the pain, arguments, and ego that came with their relationship.\n\nDavid Arquette talks painful lessons learned from relationship with Courteney Cox\n\nDespite the challenges they faced, Arquette and Cox were able to work through their issues and maintain a strong bond. They split in 2010 and filed for divorce two years later, but continue to remain \"best friends.\" They even reunited for several Scream movies, which Arquette called a \"cathartic experience.\"\n\nArquette also encouraged others to work through their differences instead of battling it out in court. He shared that many couples end up spending a lot of money fighting when they could be trying to work things out."
