        "text": "Courteney Cox is mourning Matthew Perry, who played her husband on the NBC sitcom “Friends,” following his death on Oct. 28 at 54.\n\n“I am so grateful for every moment I had with you Matty and I miss you every day,” Cox posted on Instagram.\n\n“When you work with someone as closely as I did with Matthew, there are thousands of moments I wish I could share. For now here’s one of my favorites.”\n\n“To give a little backstory, Chandler and Monica were supposed to have a one night fling in London,” she wrote alongside a clip from the sitcom. “But because of the audience’s reaction, it became the beginning of their love story. In this scene, before we started rolling, he whispered a funny line for me to say. He often did things like that. He was funny and he was kind.”\n\nCox’s tribute came just hours after Matt LeBlanc shared his own on social media.\n\nPerry was found dead in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home. He drowned, according to TMZ, which reported that prescription drugs were found inside Perry’s home.\n\nHe was best known for his role as Chandler Bing, the affable neighbor-turned-husband of Cox’s Monica Geller on “Friends.”\n\nCox, 59, shared a special bond with Perry off-screen as well, with the pair making guest appearances on each other’s sitcoms after “Friends” wrapped its 10-season run in 2004.\n\n“She is fantastic, obviously. And my desire to show off in front of her is back in full swing,” Perry tweeted in February 2013 as Cox guest starred on his NBC sitcom “Go On.”\n\nPerry returned the favor months later, when he appeared on Cox’s comedy “Cougar Town.”\n\n“It was so great to work with him. He’s so sweet,” Cox said on “Conan” in January 2014, per Us Weekly.\n\n“When I worked with him on ‘Friends,’ he literally gave me my personality for 10 years,” she added.\n\nPerry spoke on the “Friends” cast’s friendships to BuzzFeed in 2015.\n\n“We try to get together when we can,” he said. “Courteney is a great host, and she has a nice place in Malibu, and we try to go out there as often as possible. But the six of us haven’t been in a room together for a number of years.”\n\nIn November 2019, Cox shared a pic of her and Perry via Instagram.\n\n“Guess who I had lunch with today … I KNOW!! Could I BE any happier?” she captioned the post, referencing Chandler’s iconic cadence employed on “Friends.”\n\nThe cast of the hit show reunited in 2021, with Cox saying she thought Monica and Chandler would still be married.\n\nThe fictional couple tied the knot in 2001.\n\n“I think my character, Monica, is still really competitive,” Cox opined at the reunion.\n\n“And you are making me laugh every day,” she said of jokester Chandler.\n\nAnd before Perry released his memoir — “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,” which explored his drug and alcohol addiction — Cox gave an update on her beloved co-star.\n\n“He’s just struggled for a while. I think he’s doing great now,” she told the Times of London in February 2022.\n\nCox — alongside co-stars LeBlanc, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer — attended Perry’s funeral service in LA on Nov. 8.\n\nThe Post reached out to Cox’s reps for comment."
