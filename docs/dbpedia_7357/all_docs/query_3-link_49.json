        "text": "Courtney is an associate who provides comprehensive legal guidance to clients on estate planning, trust and estate disputes, and general business matters.\n\nWhether offering guidance to parents who want to ensure their children’s well-being, assisting those developing or revising their estate planning documents, or supporting fiduciaries and beneficiaries entangled in estate litigation, Courtney excels at having the uncomfortable but crucial conversations to ensure her clients’ interests are met.\n\nShe particularly enjoys helping young adults and other individuals without essential estate planning documents realize their benefits, and she helps them put advance medical directives, power of attorney documents, and wills or trusts, in place. Whether you are just starting out or have an established estate plan, Courtney will walk alongside you and help achieve your goals.\n\nCourtney also provides fiduciaries and beneficiaries with litigation support. These cases include proceedings for guardianship and conservatorships, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of trust claims, challenging the validity of a will or trust, and seeking court interpretation of the language within wills and trusts. Courtney understands that family disputes often give rise to great amounts of stress and heartache and therefore she encourages individuals to plan ahead and seek guidance if they have concerns.\n\nAs both a counselor and litigator, Courtney strives to make difficult concepts understandable and uncertainty manageable. Her significant litigation experience extends beyond estate litigation and includes representing businesses in contract disputes, claims of fraud, and other general civil litigation matters. In each representation, Courtney provides steadfast support, ensuring her clients always know she is in their corner.\n\nBeyond her work, Courtney takes solace in watching sunsets on her farm and enjoys precious moments with her husband, young son, and their dogs."
