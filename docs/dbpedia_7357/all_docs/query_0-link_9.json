        "text": "Courteney Bass Cox is an American actress, director and producer. She portrays Gale Weathers in all six films of the Scream franchise. She is also producer and starring in Shining Vales (2022) on Starz, another horror comedy series, and soon executive producing Last Chance on U (2022).\n\nShe previously gained recognition for her role as Monica Geller on the sitcom, Friends (1994-2004), and later led the sitcom Cougar Town (2009-2015).\n\nCox's other films include the action fantasy Masters of the Universe (1987), the comedy Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), the animated comedy Barnyard (2006), the fantasy comedy Bedtime Stories (2008), and the independent drama Mothers and Daughters (2016).\n\nOn Set\n\nTrivia\n\nCourteney Cox got married to co-star David Arquette in 1999. They met on the set of Scream, began dating around Scream 2, and had just returned from their honeymoon for Scream 3. They separated in 2010, shortly after production on Scream 4 had finished, and were divorced in Scream 5.\n\nCourteney Cox originally only agreed to return for Scream 3 if it was going to be her character's final appearance in the series. She nonetheless appeared in the sequels, 11 years apart each, in 2011 and 2022.\n\nShe and David made their own motion film production company named Coquette Productions.\n\nCourteney portrayed Monica Geller on Friends, along with David Schwimmer, who is mentioned as having portrayed Dewey in Stab and Stab 2.\n\nShe and Drew Barrymore were well known actresses before being cast in Scream. However, she returned for the sequels, while Drew Barrymore did not."
