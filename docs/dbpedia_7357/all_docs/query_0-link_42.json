        "text": "Full Name: Courteney Bass Cox\n\nAge: 59 years old\n\nBirthday: June 15, 1964\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham, Alabama, United States\n\nPartner: Johnny McDaid (2014–present)\n\nHeight: 5‘ 5\" (1.65 m)\n\nNet Worth: $150 million (Estimated)\n\nSocial Media: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n\nCourteney Cox is an actress, director and producer best known for her iconic role as the cleanly, hypercompetitive Monica Geller on the hit sitcom Friends. Her portrayal earned her a Screen Actors Guild Award and worldwide fame. Cox is also known for starring in the Scream horror franchise and on TV shows like Cougar Town.\n\nAccolades and Achievements\n\nOver her decades-long career, Cox‘s brilliant comedic skills and emotional depth as an actress has earned her significant accolades:\n\n6 Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress for Friends (1995-2000)\n\nGolden Globe Award nominations for Cougar Town (2010-2011)\n\nScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series for Friends (1996)\n\nPeople‘s Choice Award for Favorite Female TV Performer for Friends (1995)\n\nDefining Role on the Hit Sitcom Friends\n\nWithout a doubt, Courteney Cox‘s career-defining role came when she was cast as Monica Geller on Friends. As Monica, Cox perfectly portrayed her neurotic yet lovable clean-freak nature. According to co-star Lisa Kudrow:\n\n_\"Courteney‘s energy set the tone for the rest of us. She infused Monica with a little Jack Tripper [from Three‘s Company], a little Lucy Ricardo [from I Love Lucy]. She‘s the glue that held Friends together.\"_\n\nMonica was the central \"mother hen\" that kept the Friends gang together, and Cox‘s immaculate comedic skills helped make the show a monster success. During its 10 season run, Friends became a global phenomenon and remains one of the most popular sitcoms ever made.\n\nMarriages, Divorce, and Daughter Coco\n\nIn 1999, Courteney married fellow actor David Arquette who she met on the set of the first Scream movie. Their marriage was often tabloid fodder, with Cox publicly acknowledging its struggles. In 2010 they announced their separation after 11 years of marriage. They were officially divorced in 2013.\n\nDuring happier times, Cox and Arquette had a daughter together named Coco Riley Arquette, born in June 2004. Cox said becoming a mother was \"the most beautiful, amazing, exciting thing that ever happened\" to her. She maintains an amicable relationship with Arquette while raising 14-year-old Coco.\n\nDriven Personality and Lasting Friendship with Aniston\n\nCox has a reputation for being very driven, competitive, and business-minded in her work. During Friends, she was the primary cast member to pay attention to production details. She also became an adept producer and director later on.\n\nHer close friendship with Jennifer Aniston that began before either found fame remains a cornerstone in her life. Cox was even maid of honor at Aniston‘s wedding to Brad Pitt. They constantly support each other‘s projects andcox calls Aniston her \"best friend since she was 25.\"\n\nLife Outside Acting: Homebody, Swimming, Ping Pong\n\nThough a huge star, Cox has said she prefers staying home over going out. Her longtime home is a $20 million beachfront property in Malibu. She enjoys swimming regularly, playing ping pong, and spending quiet time with her dogs. She has also became an avid guitarist later in life.\n\nCox keeps a relatively low profile but devotes time to causes like environmental protection and disadvantaged youth when she isn‘t busy acting, directing or producing.\n\nConclusion: An Enduring Pop Culture Icon\n\nCourteney Cox‘s public image is practically synonymous with her Friends character Monica Geller – and for good reason. Cox‘s comedic skills, emotional depth, and universal likeability made Monica an all-time classic sitcom character. Off-screen, her driven personality allowed her to succeed as an actress, producer and director. Cox remains a pop culture fixture who will forever be beloved for the laughter and tears she brought audiences as Monica."
