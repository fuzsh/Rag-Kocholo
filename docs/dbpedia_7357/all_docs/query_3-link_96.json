        "text": "Before Friends, Courteney Cox needed a little help from an iconic singer to become a household name in Hollywood.\n\nThe beloved star, who is known around the world for playing Monica Geller in the hit '90s show, was still a struggling actress back in 1984.\n\nIt was 10 long years before she won her role on Friends when Cox was scouted to star in the music video for Bruce Springsteen's hit song Dancing in the Dark.\n\nNot only would this song become one of Springsteen's most iconic tracks in his catalogue, but it also launched the career of an A-lister.\n\nWatch the video above.\n\nREAD MORE: How Liv Tyler discovered Aerosmith's frontman was her real father\n\nREAD MORE: It took three divorces and 17 years for Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell's love story to finally begin\n\nIn the music video, Springsteen – now known as \"the Boss\" – was performing in St. Paul, Minnesota when he invited a then-unknown fan to dance with him on stage.\n\nThe premise of the video was that Cox, then aged 20, was a superfan who was lucky enough to meet Springsteen on the world stage during one of his concerts.\n\nHer 25-second cameo in the video soon became known as a \"Courteney Cox moment\" – now referred to whenever Springsteen would bring random fans on stage with him when he performed the song.\n\nBut, of course, Cox's appearance in the video was anything but random.\n\nSpringsteen himself didn't realise the moment would be staged. He was informed to pick a fan from the crowd for the video and Cox was a well-placed plant.\n\nREAD MORE: In 1982, the world fell in love with a seven-year-old Drew Barrymore\n\nNevertheless, it marked an unforgettable debut for Cox, who was dressed in a Springsteen shirt and a pair of blue jeans with a deeply '80s shag haircut.\n\nThe video premiered on MTV in 1984 and would go on to win the MTV VMA for 'Best Stage Performance' that year.\n\nI'm not a bad dancer, but that was horrible. I was so nervous.\n\nSuddenly, Cox was the new \"it\" girl in Hollywood. It launched an iconic career, with roles in Family Ties, Friends and the Scream franchise.\n\nBy the mid-90s, Cox's role as Monica in Friends had catapulted her into an unprecedented level of stardom. She played that character until the show's end in 2004 and has maintained a steady and successful Hollywood career since then.\n\nREAD MORE: The story behind Jane Fonda's infamous 1970 mugshot\n\nDecades later, Cox spoke about how she auditioned for the coveted Springsteen video role alongside professional dancers, despite having no real dancing experience herself.\n\n\"I thought I was in the wrong place,\" Cox recalled on the Howard Stern Show in 2022. \"I was like, 'I don't know what they're doing, but I can't even bend my leg. Like, this is it.'\"\n\nIt was so embarrassing. I think that's why I got it, because I was literally like [nervously saying], 'OK.' I think that's what they wanted, a fan that just couldn't believe it.\"\n\nNext year will mark 40 years since Cox became a star overnight.\n\nThough she has many more accolades to her name, the actress, now aged 59, doesn't shy away from reflecting on the moment that changed her life.\n\nREAD MORE: Winona Ryder's scandalous magazine shoot after being arrested in 2001\n\n\"Bruce Springsteen, God, he's so incredible. I love that song,\" Cox gushed to Howard Stern in the same interview.\n\nHowever, four decades has also given Cox some time to cringe about her '80s dance moves, and she admits she does \"get a little embarrassed\" when she watches the video back.\n\n\"I do feel like when I watch the video, when I see it, I mean, God, did you see my dance? It was pathetic,\" she laughed. \"I'm not a bad dancer, but that was horrible. I was so nervous.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
