        "text": "Courteney Cox opened up about aging and how the “confidence of time” affects her work as an actor, director, and producer.\n\n“The place I am in right now is the happiest I’ve ever been,” she said.\n\nHer latest film, Scream VI, hits theaters March 10.\n\nCourteney Cox may have recently played gen Z dress-up on Instagram (winged liner, crop top, and all!), but in reality, the actress is thrilled with where she’s landed at 58. Last month, she was honored with her very own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and work is as busy as ever with her new series Shining Vale and the upcoming release of Scream VI. Now, the star is opening up about aging and how things are only getting better.\n\n“The place I am in right now is the happiest I’ve ever been,” she recently told Variety. “There’s a lot of things that are not great about getting older, but there’s a lot of great things and that is being in a place where I love working,” she continued. “I try harder now at things. I care more. I love directing. I love acting. I love producing. I feel like I’ve been doing it long enough that I actually know what I’m doing and then I can excel. I can be better. I take more chances. There’s just something about the confidence of time, of doing something so long, I probably love it more now than I ever have.”\n\nIn the past, Cox has opened up about the more difficult sides of aging, including the pressure she felt to maintain a certain appearance with fillers, procedures, and the like. “There was a time when you go, ‘Oh, I’m changing. I’m looking older.’ And I tried to chase that [youthfulness] for years,” she told The Sunday Times last year. “And I didn’t realize that … I’m actually looking really strange with injections and doing stuff to my face that I would never do now.”\n\nShe continued: “People would talk about me, I think. But there was a period where I went, ‘I’ve got to stop. That’s just crazy.’”\n\nAlong with confidence in her work, she added that time has also leveled her out a bit. “There’s no question that I am more grounded, I’ve learned so much in my life,” she said. “What to enjoy, what to try to do more of, and what to let go of.”\n\nAnd that, in turn, has fed her craft on-screen—a preparedness that can only come from experience. “Experience changes things,” she told Variety. “I mean, it’s crazy how you can be so close to your emotions when you get older because you’ve been through so many more things.”\n\nYou can catch Cox in Scream VI out March 10 or watch Shining Vale, now streaming on Starz."
