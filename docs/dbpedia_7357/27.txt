Defining Role on the Hit Sitcom Friends

_"Courteney‘s energy set the tone for the rest of us. She infused Monica with a little Jack Tripper [from Three‘s Company], a little Lucy Ricardo [from I Love Lucy]. She‘s the glue that held Friends together."_

During happier times, Cox and Arquette had a daughter together named Coco Riley Arquette, born in June 2004. Cox said becoming a mother was "the most beautiful, amazing, exciting thing that ever happened" to her. She maintains an amicable relationship with Arquette while raising 14-year-old Coco.
