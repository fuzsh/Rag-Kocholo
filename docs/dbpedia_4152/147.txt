I don't really know what to think. Would never let myself say this film was bad, it really wasn't in terms of cinematography. But what is good cinematography with a crap story. This is my problem with Noe, if only he could have a good screenwriter, sometimes I think. The style and leaps of time are still very attractive to me. It seems that the whole film is a stream of consciousness of Murphy. But honestly, I hated the female actress for the role, whoever she was, I thought the casting was done very poorly.

After watching irreversible, Love was considerably weaker and worse. Again, the use of color was something... remarkable, the editing, the pacing, everything in terms of production were great. But I keep realizing that great production with a bad story does not have much value.
