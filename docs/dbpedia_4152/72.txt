4/19/05, 9:06 pm EST - Xoanon

Emily writes: Thought you might like to know that The Lord of the Rings Symphony was a nominee earlier today for the Artistic Excellence Award given by the Greater Columbus Arts Council each year. The award is presented to an arts organization (in this case, the Columbus Symphony Orchestra) that demonstrates innovation, risk, and artistic excellence in a performance, exhibition, or program. LOTR didn't win (it's probably the first time in a long time that it hasn't!), but I thought you might be interested in the program notes accompanying the nomination. I attended the concert last year and, as has been reported by many others, it was fabulous!

Johnny Depp isn't the only swashbuckling adventurer coming our way this year as Lord Of The Rings star Viggo Mortensen has left Middle Earth in favour of a life on the high seas. And King Aragorn had no trouble finding his sea legs when he got to work on the historical epic Alatriste in which he plays a heroic Spanish soldier.
