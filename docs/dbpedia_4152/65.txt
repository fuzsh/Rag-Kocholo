Tell the butterflies in the pit of your stomach to buckle up: An Aussie rom-com is taking flight. A seaplane pilot who flies across the breathtaking landscape of the Great Barrier Reef must fight to keep her father’s business — and her feelings — at cruising altitude when a dashing Brit comes in to shut the company down. Directed and co-written by Adrian Power (A Royal in Paradise), Katharine E. McPhee (Elegy), and Powers’ A Royal in Paradise collaborator Caera Bradshaw, Love Is in the Air stars singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem in her first lead role in a feature film since 2005.

What happens in Love Is in the Air?

Dana Randall adores her job as chief pilot at Fullerton Airways, the struggling small business her dad, Jeff, co-founded with Dana’s late mother. Dana’s a brilliant pilot who takes tour groups on sightseeing tours, and even rescues dogs in need of an emergency trip to the vet. She’s super close with her father and her bestie, airplane mechanic Nikki, and they all take pride in helping locals get where they need to go.

Over in London, William’s been pressured by his father and boss, Duncan, to find ways to cut down on their margins. Lucky for William, there’s an asset in their portfolio that isn’t doing too hot. This is his chance to prove himself to his uptight dad. His pitch: Sell Fullerton Airways for parts. Shockingly, his hard-to-please dad loves the idea. So Duncan sends William to Australia to do all his bidding. He shows up in Australia under the auspices of an audit, but as he spends time with the locals — and with Dana — he starts to question what brought him there in the first place.
