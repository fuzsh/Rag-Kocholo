        "meta_description": "When Love Walks In: Directed by The Brothers Williamson, Brad Williamson, Kent C. Williamson. With Kent C. Williamson, Maggie Jones, Bill Williamson, Terri Moore. Irresponsible... Distant... Self-serving... These are the snapshots that describe John Redgrave. But that's before his wife dies and leaves him alone to raise their three-year-old daughter. Emotionally devastated, John attempts to pick up the pieces of his shattered life as his overzealous father rushes him to find a mother for his little girl. He could fall for Annelise Machiavelli, the aspiring artist he's hired as a baby-sitter, but his lingering grief continues to make him hesitant and uncertain about committing to a new relationship. Though Annelise stands ready to teach him that even tragedy can open the door to new opportunity, self-doubt, selfish ambition, and a crazy potential mother-in-law always seem to get in the way. Grief may conquer him... Fear may ruin him... But everything changes... When Love Walks In.",

        "text": "The movie presents a great premise as well as real life situations and interchange. Being a man, the exchange between John and Anna was classic in the quest to find out the status of their relationship. It definitely highlights the difference between the sexes - caused some raucous discussion in our group. I had to adjust to the use of fewer angles and frequency of shots. It is not the new image every 3 seconds like Star Wars but more like the older generation of film that depends on the facial expression and sometimes pauses to get the emotion across. It is a good theme to use and discuss with children the impact of the death of a parent. Sometimes the plot was slow, and some scenes could have used more intensity of emotion. The scenes with Sierra were unrehearsed and very genuine. I can see why she would receive recognition."
