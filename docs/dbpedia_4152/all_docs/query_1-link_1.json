The film was made in New York City for $350,000, with a cast and crew from over 20 countries, with 168 scenes, shot at over 60 locations. The film was shot on mini DV in 20 days, transferred to 35mm film, and received high praise in the September 2005 issue of American Cinematographer for its stylish look.[citation needed]\n\nIt impressed audiences and critics at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival, Venice Film Festival, and the Oldenburg Film Festival.[citation needed] Love also won the Prix De Jeunes at the Cinéma Tout Ecran festival in Geneva, Switzerland. Critics compared the film to Pulp Fiction, Memento, Rashomon, and in its political subtext to Marathon Man and Dirty Pretty Things (Variety).\n\nTold through a non-linear narrative from each of the characters' points of view, the film reconstructs the stories of a Yugoslav hit man (Sergej Trifunovic), his former lover (Geno Lechner), and her police officer boyfriend (Peter Gevisser), as their paths cross in New York.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nSergej Trifunovic as Vanya\n\nGeno Lechner as Anna\n\nPeter Gevisser as Dirk\n\nDidier Flamand as Jean\n\nMario Padula as Manny\n\nAl Nazemian as Ali (as Al Naz)\n\nLiat Glick as Faye\n\nEric Frandsen as Hayes\n\nMariano Mederos as Rivera\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
