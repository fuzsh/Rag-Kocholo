        "meta_description": "A Lot Like Love isn't the most original romantic comedy you'll ever see. Heck, it's probably not the 475th most original romantic comedy. As a critic, you try not to go in with preconceived notions, but that's often unavoidable. I don't care for much of Peet's past work and Ashton Kutcher has never impressed me with his acting. Punk'd is sometimes amusing, but that really has nothing to do with acting, that's just being a jerk, which Kutcher certainly excels at. With all that said, sometimes a movie that you feel you shouldn't like makes you laugh. A Lot Like Love is one of those films. It's no classic, but it's amusing enough and Kutcher and Peet have a very nice chemistry.\r\n\r\nIn yet another take on the When Harry Met Sally formula that has been replicated ever since, Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet play Oliver and Emily, two opposites who share a sexual attraction. They meet in an airport and soon join the mile high club. Emily could care less (apparently she often boinks strange men in planes) but the two happen upon each other again while wondering Manhattan. They hang out and become friends, but soon return to their own lives, vowing to one day talk again and see where their lives have gone. The rest of the story covers the course of seven years in the lives of Oliver and Emily. They meet on occasion, have sex on occasion, and mostly provide a shoulder for the other to cry on throughout their countless breakups. You can probably guess where the story goes from there.",

The rest of the story covers the course of seven years in the lives of Oliver and Emily. They meet on occasion, have sex on occasion, and mostly provide a shoulder for the other to cry on throughout their countless breakups. You can probably guess where the story goes from there.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Kutcher and Peet have chemistry. In fact, their chemistry is the strength of the film. This is the best and most appealing either of these actors have ever been. They play off each other very naturally, which often culminates in some of A Lot Like Love's funniest moments. My favorite scene in the film is a dinner sequence in which the two try to see who can go the longest without talking. They try to distract each other, throwing things, making faces and nearly getting kicked out of the restaurant. It's juvenile but I've gotta admit, I've had similar experiences and I totally related. It really had me laughing.\n\nFirst time screenwriter Colin Patrick Lynch has delivered a romantic comedy that seems largely based on what he thought would sell as a romantic comedy. The story travels a well worn path and only rarely attempts anything we haven't seen dozens of times before. To his credit, he does manage to craft two strong characters that gave Peet and Kutcher something to work with. It's hard to tell where his writing ends and their own characterizations begin, but they work well together and make for memorable characters, albeit it in an unmemorable story.\n\nThe direction by Nigel Cole is anonymous. It's neither good nor bad, it's just there. There is nothing that really sets Cole's direction apart from the legion of hired gun directors of romantic comedies like this. He has turned out a competent film, but it's lacking the kind of spirited originality of his previous efforts like Saving Grace.\n\nTeen girls whose hearts flutter at the mere mention of the word Ashton will likely go ga ga over his cutesy performance as Oliver. For the guys who have to accompany them, they could do worse. Peet is appealing and fun, especially in her punk rock phase in the beginning, playing up her bad girl image. For better or worse, she becomes less of a bad girl as the story moves along. A Lot Like Love is funny and it has some fun moments. It will probably do more for the careers of Peet and Kutcher then for the state of romantic comedies in general or the career of director Nigel Cole. The romantic comedy genre is so overplayed and so filled with garbage, it's nice to see one where you at least don't wish for the death of the two leads by steamroller.\n\n3 out of 5 Stars, 6/10 Score"
