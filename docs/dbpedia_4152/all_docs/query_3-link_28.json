        "text": "Turning up to interview for top cop drunk, he is hired by the corrupt president of Paradise’s board of selectmen as they believe he will be easily manipulated into doing their bidding and turning a blind eye.\n\nStone smells what’s going on in the deceptively quaint town that is rife with organised criminal syndicates and murder and the films depict his struggles with crime and his own personal demons.\n\nStarting with Stone Cold on CBS in 2005, Selleck reprised the role another eight times till 2015s Lost in Paradise. Fans are keen to see more of Stone and Selleck has confirmed they are working on a script for a tenth film but until then, read on to find out how to immerse yourself in the world of Jesse Stone.\n\nMore like this\n\nHow to watch Jesse Stone movies in chronological order\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself in the world of Paradise, the series chronology is relatively simple: you just have to remember that the first movie to be released, Stone Cold, should be watched as the second Jesse Stone story in Parker’s series.\n\nMeanwhile, the second movie Night Passage, which was released a year later in 2006, should be watched first, as it introduces us to Stone’s LA backstory. Got it? From then on, the movies follow a straightforward chronological order.\n\nHere's a quick look at the Jesse Stone films in chronological order.\n\nJesse Stone: Night Passage (2006)\n\nJesse Stone: Stone Cold (2005)\n\nJesse Stone: Death in Paradise (2006)\n\nJesse Stone: Sea Change (2007)\n\nJesse Stone: Thin Ice (2009)\n\nJesse Stone: No Remorse (2010)\n\nJesse Stone: Innocents Lost (2011)\n\nJesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt (2012)\n\nJesse Stone: Lost in Paradise (2015)\n\nBelow we have more detailed entries for each movie in the series.\n\nJesse Stone: Night Passage (2006)\n\nBased on the first novel in Parker’s series, Night Passage sees Stone make the journey from Los Angeles (after being forced to resign from his role as a homicide detective for drinking while on duty) to Paradise, a small town on the Massachusetts coast. He is soon hired as Paradise’s chief of police, as the sleazy council leader, noting Stone’s drinking problem, reckons he will be a soft touch and turn a blind eye to his money laundering schemes.\n\nHe’s wrong, however. When the body of the previous police chief, who was forced out of the role after learning about the scheme, is found, Stone sets out to prove that his death was not an accident, and becomes embroiled in the murky world of the local gangsters who have some unsavoury links to the Boston mob. Viola Davis stars alongside Sellick as his police colleague Officer Molly Crane (she also appears in Stone Cold, Death in Paradise and Sea Change).\n\nRent or buy Jesse Stone: Night Passage on Amazon Prime Video\n\nJesse Stone: Stone Cold (2005)\n\nThe sleepy town of Paradise is left reeling after a body is discovered on the shoreline, shot twice in the heart with a .22 calibre pistol. Not long after, two more victims are discovered, each killed by the same method. Stone, who is also investigating the rape of a teenage girl, starts to piece together a potential suspect profile by cross-referencing the gun register against the registration of a red truck that was spotted fleeing the crime scene.\n\nSoon, he has discovered not one but two potential killers acting as a pair - but without concrete evidence or a clear motive, he must wait to engineer a scenario that will prove their guilt. It’s a high stakes plan, and one that will eventually come at a high personal cost to Stone.\n\nRent or buy Jesse Stone: Stone Cold on Amazon Prime Video\n\nJesse Stone: Death in Paradise (2006)\n\nStone’s next case sees him investigating the death of a teenage girl whose body is discovered floating in a lake. An autopsy reveals that she was pregnant, and that alcohol and muscle relaxer were in her bloodstream at the time of death. An initialed ring found on the body provides the first clue, eventually leading Stone and his colleague Luther Simpson (Kohl Sudduth) to discover that the victim is Billie Bishop, a high school student who was thrown out of her family home after her behaviour changed and her grades dropped.\n\nFurther investigation reveals that Billie was in the orbit of wealthy local novelist Norman Shaw, a man with rumoured connections to the criminal underworld, who has been working on a book about Boston gangster Leo Finn. The case will once again take Stone into dangerous territory.\n\nRent or buy Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise on Amazon Prime Video\n\nJesse Stone: Sea Change (2007)\n\nAfter admitting to his psychologist that he drinks more heavily when he doesn’t have a case to work on, Stone tells his new colleague Rose Gammon (Kathy Baker) to find the list of local unsolved cases. (Gammon has replaced Davis’s Officer Crane, who has resigned from the force since the events of Death in Paradise.) He then decides to reopen the investigation into the 1992 death of a bank teller who was taken hostage during a robbery.\n\nWhen they visit the site where the body was found, they discover what appear to be the gunman’s clothes covered in marks consistent with a gunshot wound - a clue which proves this case is much more complex than the police had previously assumed.\n\nRent or buy Stone: Sea Change on Amazon Prime Video\n\nJesse Stone: Thin Ice (2009)\n\nAs Thin Ice opens, Stone comes to the aid of his colleague, State Police Captain Healy (Stephen McHattie), who is attacked while keeping tabs on his nephew who he believes is in a relationship with his saxophone teacher. Stone starts to investigate the shooting, a move which doesn’t go down too well with the local council, who are wondering why he spends most of his time getting caught up in shoot-outs rather than sorting out lucrative parking tickets and speeding fines.\n\nWhile he ploughs on with the case in spite of their wishes, Stone is contacted by a woman who wants him to look into the disappearance of her baby seven years ago. Although a body with a name tag was found at the time, she was never convinced it was her child - and later received an anonymous note claiming \"your child is loved\". Though he is sympathetic to her plight, Stone decides not pursue it, thinking that opening another cold case will only rile up the council even more. Gammon, however, is determined to investigate.\n\nRent or buy Jesse Stone: Thin Ice on Amazon Prime Video\n\nJesse Stone: No Remorse (2010)\n\nSuspended from his position as Paradise’s chief of police, Stone has been banned from contacting his colleagues, and is drinking heavily, much to the concern of Gammon and Healy. After a spate of murders in a parking lot, Stone is hired as a private consultant to Boston police, who are investigating the killings.\n\nThe first victim, he soon learns, had ties to Gino Fish, a figure in the Boston mob who has cropped up in previous investigations. When he’s not on the case up in Boston, Stone also looks into a series of attacks at a local convenience store.\n\nRent or buy Jesse Stone: No Remorse on Amazon Prime Video\n\nJesse Stone: Innocents Lost (2011)\n\nThis time around, Stone has been pushed out of his job, replaced by the town council president’s son-in-law who is more concerned with Paradise’s public image than with fighting crime. Naturally, Stone is convinced that he will be reinstated one day, and is less than impressed when Butler, the new chief, tries to get him to give up his \"concealed weapon\" gun permit.\n\nEven without an official police role, Stone still manages to find himself caught up in a pair of murder investigations. One involves the death of friend, which the new police chief has ruled as a suicide rather than looking into the case further, while another sees him once again team up with old pal Healy as a consultant for the Massachusetts State Police on a murder and robbery, where Healy has doubts over the main suspect’s guilt.\n\nRent or buy Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost on Amazon Prime Video\n\nJesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt (2012)\n\nButler and one of his officers are killed in a suspicious police car explosion, and Stone is temporarily reinstated as the police chief by the town president, Carter Hansen. He soon notes that Hansen’s predecessor Hathaway, who has cropped up in a handful of previous stories, seemed to know about the death before Hansen was officially notified.\n\nA note in Butler’s calendar seems to imply that he was caught up in police corruption, and Stone’s investigation will once again draw him into the web of local gangsters and their organised crime rings. He’ll have to carry it out alone, though, as his old associates Gammon and Simpson have left the force after struggling to work with Stone’s replacement.\n\nRent or buy Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt on Amazon Prime Video\n\nJesse Stone: Lost in Paradise (2015)\n\nBy now, Stone is back in the job of police chief, yet he again agrees to help out the Massachusetts State Police as a consultant, feeling bored by the dearth of significant cases in Paradise lately. He’s given access to case files on several murders in the Boston area, including one involving a woman named Mavis Davies, the fourth victim of a serial killer known as the Boston Ripper. When Stone visits the murderer in jail, he proudly admits to the first three killings - but insists that he did not commit the fourth.\n\nStone believes that he’s telling the truth, but has trouble convincing both Davies’s widower and Detective Leary, the officer who caught the Ripper, that the case might be much more complicated than they first thought. Advice from his psychologist Dr Dix (who just so happens to be an ex-cop) helps put him on the right track, though, and while he’s looking into the cold case, Stone also befriends a troubled 13-year-old who is being mistreated by her mother.\n\nRent or buy Jesse Stone: Lost in Paradise on Amazon Prime Video\n\nHow to watch Jesse Stone movies in release order\n\nAs we said earlier, the only difference for watching it in release order is watching Stone Cold first followed by Night Passage with the rest of the order being the same. But, for completion's sake, we have listed it just below too.\n\nJesse Stone: Stone Cold (2005)\n\nJesse Stone: Night Passage (2006)\n\nJesse Stone: Death in Paradise (2006)\n\nJesse Stone: Sea Change (2007)\n\nJesse Stone: Thin Ice (2009)\n\nJesse Stone: No Remorse (2010)\n\nJesse Stone: Innocents Lost (2011)\n\nJesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt (2012)\n\nJesse Stone: Lost in Paradise (2015)\n\nWhere to watch Jesse Stone movies\n\nThe Jesse Stone films have aired on CBS and on the Hallmark Channel over in the US, but unfortunately, fans on this side of the Atlantic can only rent or buy all nine movies on Amazon Prime Video as there are no streaming options available at this time.\n\nIf physical media is your preference, there is also the DVD boxset available from Amazon.\n\nAlternatively, for the home theatre connoisseurs, the Blu-Ray set can also be purchased from Amazon and while it is predictably quite a bit more expensive, it is by far the best way to enjoy the Jesse Stone in the highest fidelity.\n\nCheck out more of our Film coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on."
