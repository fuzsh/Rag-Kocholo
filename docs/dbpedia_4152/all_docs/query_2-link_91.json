        "text": "Kang Bok Gu is a tough guy and a K-1 Fighter. Bok Gu is a character who is dynamic in nature and grew up in a foster home. He falls in love with a woman whom he should not love. It was because of the woman that his emotionally wounded brother fell off the rooftop and became a nursing case. So, his love is forbidden and inevitably tragic. The woman is Cha Eun Seok, who is a TV talent and movie actress. It is not that she jilted his brother on purpose, but upon a basis of misunderstanding, his hatred toward Cha Eun Seok grows more and more burning. By becoming Cha Eun Seok's private bodyguard, Bok Gu concretely practices his revenge upon her. He only desires 'to bring his brother's woman to her knees. He is gradually taking Cha Eun Seok to destruction while he feels his love for her growing deeper and deeper in his heart. Bok Gu is a cold guy character without any special concern for women. The martial art of hand-to-hand fighting was just a kind of escape he chose from the shock of a spinster's death whom he loved from a distance.
