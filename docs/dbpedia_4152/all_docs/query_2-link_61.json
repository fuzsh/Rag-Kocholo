        "text": "Many of Disney's classic films have become a part of pop culture history, while modern films like Frozen see unprecedented success. The Disney catalog represents magic and wonder, great stories, memorable characters, and a history of high-quality productions. While the studio has experienced highs and lows over the years, its impact and sheer creative output are unmistakable.\n\nDisney Movies by Year of Release\n\nWhile everyone can name at least a dozen Disney films, the sheer number of actual titles released may astound you. Unfortunately, not all of them are available for viewing. Many exist behind closed doors in the Disney vault.\n\nAnimated Feature Films\n\nWhen Disney released Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, it was the first animated feature film ever produced. It was only the beginning of a storied history in cartoon filmmaking.\n\n1937 - Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\n\n1940 - Pinocchio and Fantasia\n\n1941 - Dumbo\n\n1942 - Saludos Amigos and Bambi\n\n1944 - The Three Caballeros\n\n1946 - Song of the South\n\n1946 - Make Mine Music\n\n1947 - Fun and Fancy Free\n\n1948 - Melody Time\n\n1949 - The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\n\n1950 - Cinderella\n\n1951 - Alice in Wonderland\n\n1953 - Peter Pan\n\n1955 - Lady and the Tramp\n\n1959 - Sleeping Beauty\n\n1961 - One Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\n1963 - The Sword in the Stone\n\n1967 - The Jungle Book\n\n1970 - The Aristocats\n\n1973 - Robin Hood\n\n1977 - The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and The Rescuers\n\n1981 - The Fox and the Hound\n\n1985 - The Black Cauldron\n\n1986 - The Great Mouse Detective\n\n1987 - The Brave Little Toaster\n\n1988 - Oliver & Company\n\n1989 - The Little Mermaid\n\n1990 - The Rescuers Down Under\n\n1991 - Beauty and the Beast\n\n1992 - Aladdin\n\n1994 - The Lion King\n\n1995 - Pocahontas\n\n1996 - The Hunchback of Notre Dame\n\n1997 - Hercules\n\n1998 - Mulan\n\n1999 - Tarzan and Fantasia 2000\n\n2000 - The Emperor's New Groove\n\n2001 - Atlantis: The Lost Empire\n\n2002 - Lilo & Stitch and Treasure Planet\n\n2003 - Brother Bear\n\n2004 - Home on the Range\n\n2005 - Chicken Little\n\n2007 - Meet the Robinsons\n\n2008 - Bolt\n\n2009 - The Princess and the Frog\n\n2010 - Tangled\n\n2011 - Winnie the Pooh\n\n2012 - Wreck-It Ralph\n\n2013 - Frozen\n\n2014 - Big Hero 6\n\n2016 - Zootopia\n\n2019 - Frozen II\n\n2019 - Spies in Disguise\n\n2021 - Raya and the Last Dragon\n\nPixar Films\n\nPixar Animation Studios are pioneers in computer-generated animation, releasing several successful and critically-acclaimed movies.

Over the years, Disney has released many animated films directly to video. These features are primarily sequels of popular Disney releases.\n\n1994 - The Return of Jafar\n\n1995 - Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken\n\n1996 - Aladdin and the King of Thieves\n\n1997 - Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin, and Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas\n\n1998 - Belle's Magical World, Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, and Hercules: Zero to Hero\n\n1999 - Winnie the Pooh: Seasons of Giving and Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas\n\n2000 - An Extremely Goofy Movie, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins, and The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea\n\n2001 - Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure, Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse, and Recess Christmas: Miracle on Third Street\n\n2002 - Cinderella II: Dreams Come True, The Hunchback of Notre Dame II, Tarzan & Jane, Mickey's House of Villains, and Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year\n\n2003 - 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure, Atlantis: Milo's Return, Stitch!

Hayley Mills starred in beloved Disney classics like Pollyanna and The Parent Trap in the 1960's, and she returned for three made-for-TV Disney sequels to The Parent Trap in the 1980's. More recently, Disney has seen great success with the Pirates of the Caribbean feature film franchise. Malificent won hearts upon its 2014 release and showed the humanity behind the Sleeping Beauty villain. Disney's 2015 live action adaptation of Cinderella was a critical and commercial success. Over the years, Disney's live-action output has been even greater than its list of animated films. In fact, the list is too long to include here.
