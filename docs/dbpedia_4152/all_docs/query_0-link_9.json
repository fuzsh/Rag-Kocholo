I can't wait to see this movie.\n\nBack to top\n\nI noticed MovieFone mentions the Japanese cast for the film. So I wonder if Disney will be releasing both versions of the film theatrically, like they did with Spirited Away.\n\nBack to top\n\nI really hope this is better then the crappy Spirited Away. I wasn't impressed with Miyazaki's last couple films. I hope he isn't losing his touch.\n\nBack to top\n\nI was lucky enough to see this on opening day in Japan. This is my favorite Miyazaki film, and I didn't know what they were saying. As for the comment on Spirited Away. I thought that it was amazing, and really showed that Miyazaki still has the touch.\n\nBack to top\n\nGATSU wrote:\n\nI noticed MovieFone mentions the Japanese cast for the film.

I wasn't impressed with Miyazaki's last couple films. I hope he isn't losing his touch.\n\nYeah, it was just so crappy It's fine to say you didn't like it, but from a technical standpoint there was absolutely nothing \"crappy\" about it.\n\nBack to top\n\nAs far as animation and imagry go, it was quite well done. But I didn't like any other aspect of the movie.\n\nBack to top\n\nThat trailer is gorgeous! I really can't wait for this movie to come out.. I'd love to see the sub and dub in theatres.. ^^ Howl is a fancy-looking lad...\n\nBack to top\n\ncubs2084 wrote:\n\nAs far as animation and imagry go, it was quite well done.

Obviously somebody loved it.\n\nBack to top\n\nI can't wait for this movie. It looks different from the book but I don't care. Miyazaki know what he's doing and it looks beautiful.\n\nBack to top\n\nI got to see it during Christmas time. I loved the animation. The scenery was breathtaking. The VA's did a good job.\n\nI wonder how the American VA will do. They certainly have a great and well known cast.\n\nIt still cheeses me off that only selected cities (ie. NY, LA, Chicago) will have a chance to see this film. Time will tell.\n\nI loved Spirited Away. That was a great film. It made me a fan of Japanese bath houses.\n\nBack to top Tenchi\n\nJoined: 03 Jan 2002\n\nPosts: 4496\n\nLocation: Ottawa... now I'm an ex-Anglo Montrealer.\n\nPosted: Thu Apr 21, 2005 9:00 pm\n\nIt's been reported (but not yet confirmed) that it will be on up to 700 screens, which, while nowhere near a true wide release, means that it would be on one screen in every large and medium sized metropolitain area, and even some small cities.\n\nBack to top arxane\n\nJoined: 30 Oct 2002\n\nPosts: 447\n\nPosted: Thu Apr 21, 2005 11:42 pm\n\nTenchi wrote:\n\nIt's been reported (but not yet confirmed) that it will be on up to 700 screens, which, while nowhere near a true wide release, means that it would be on one screen in every large and medium sized metropolitain area, and even some small cities.\n\nI hope that's true. What I wouldn't give to have an anime in theaters here in OKC...\n\nBack to top\n\nLooks good, all I hope is that Disney release with with English Subtitles NOT Dubtitles, like with Spirited Away and the other Ghibli Films, Because I watch anime in Japanese with Subs only, and it will be pointless to own it if it's got Dubtitles, if it does, I'll stick with my Fansubbed copy, even though it's crapper Quality.\n\nBack to top\n\nIt's looking pretty good. Honestly, it doesn't look that interesting but none of Miyazaki's films look interesting until you actually watch them\n\nBack to top ShellBullet\n\nJoined: 20 Mar 2003\n\nPosts: 1051\n\nLocation: I hit things, with my fist.\n\nPosted: Fri Apr 22, 2005 7:31 pm\n\nslickwataris wrote:\n\nIt's looking pretty good.
