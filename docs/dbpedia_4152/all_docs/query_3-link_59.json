        "text": "Jennifer Garner revealed how she got “Marvel fit” for her cameo in the new “Deadpool & Wolverine” movie.\n\nOn Monday, the 52-year-old actress compiled months’ worth of workouts in an Instagram video, titled “Becoming Elektra ⚔️,” to give fans a glimpse into the intense training routine.\n\nGarner’s training included rigorous cardio circuits, weight training, swimming, boxing, HIIT workouts, water aerobics, running and more.\n\nThe “13 Going On 30” star also spent lots of time testing different stunts to prepare for her complex fight scene over 20 years after she first entered the MCU.\n\nIn the caption, Garner explained that she hadn’t used a pair of sais — her character Elektra’s go-to weapon — in two decades when Ryan Reynolds and Shawn Levy first approached her about being in the film.\n\n“Other than trying to convince my kids’ preschool buddies that I was secretly a ninja, I hadn’t picked up Elektra’s sais since 2004; I was fit, but not @marvel fit 🥷🏻👵🏼,” she wrote.\n\nOnce the “dream became reality,” Garner “amped up” her training and started working closely with a stunt double.\n\nFor months, the “Alias” star worked out twice a day, did boxing three times a week and topped it all off with “lots and lots” of Peloton classes.\n\n“We had #SuperHeroSummer over here, twirling sais in the backyard and laughing at our sore old bodies,” she wrote.\n\nAlthough Garner never realized that Elektra “needed an ending,” she is grateful that Reynolds and Levy allowed her to close that chapter.\n\n“They are gifted in many ways, but seeing and elevating people around them is at the top of the list,” she wrote.\n\n“Shooting the fight was so fun, being there all together—truly like a dream,” she continued. “I’m proud of my friends and grateful to be up there with them. Thank you doesn’t cut it, guys, but it’s a good placeholder until I figure out what does ⚔️♥️.”\n\nGarner reprised her role as the assassin-for-hire for the third installment of the Marvel franchise, which has dominated the box office since its release on July 26.\n\nShe first starred as the comic character in 2003’s “Daredevil” alongside ex Ben Affleck, whom she was married to from 2005 to 2018.\n\nIn the latest Reynolds-lead film, Garner seemingly poked fun at the pair’s split during a fight scene alongside Deadpool, played by Ryan Reynolds, and Wolverine, portrayed by Hugh Jackman.\n\nAs the group tries to hide from Emma Corrin’s character, Cassandra, Garner tells them that someone “always dies” when they spar with the supervillain — including Affleck’s old character, Daredevil.\n\nHowever, when Deadpool offered her his condolences, she simply shrugged and said, “It’s fine.”\n\nMany fans were convinced it was a jab at Affleck since the pair met and fell in love on the set of the superhero film."
