        "text": "U.K. is Virgin Territory\n\nSeptember 11th, 2005\n\nThe 40-Year Old Virgin topped the U.K. marked with an impressive $3.26 million on 394 screens in the U.K., but this is probably not indicative of its potential in other international markets. The film should do well in the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand, but will likely struggle in non-English speaking markets. (Germany may be an exception.) More...\n\nWar Ends World Tour with a Blast\n\nSeptember 4th, 2005\n\nWar of the Worlds opened in its last international market over the weekend making $3.0 million on 583 screens in China. That's about 10% more money that Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith earned, but War of the Worlds needed nearly double the number of screens. Overall the film added $4.5 million to its $345 million international total, easily the second best of the year so far. More...\n\nMillions Rent Rings, But More Buy Sin\n\nSeptember 3rd, 2005\n\nThis week there were three new releases ranking in the top five on the rental charts led by The Ring Two with $7.45 million, $6.99 million of that coming from DVD rentals. On a side note, many rental places are phasing out VHS rentals and it won't be long before the industry stop tracking these numbers entirely. More...\n\nKey Openings for Skeleton\n\nAugust 28th, 2005\n\nThe Skeleton Key opened in 10- more markets over the weekend and in now playing on 1400 screens, however, it still hasn't found the success the studio was hoping for. It did open in first place in Germany, but it still had a very soft opening with $1.6 million. It also opened in first place in Russia with $625,000 over the weekend and $780,000 since Thursday, but in Australia and New Zealand it had to settle for a distant second place with $760,000 and $110,000 respectively. The Skeleton Key also open in Austria with $230,000 for the week, but its placing is unknown at the moment. Add in holdovers in France, ($250,000 for $2.2 million) and the U.K., ($130,000 for $4.5 million) and you have roughly $4 million for the weekend and $16.5 million so far. More...\n\nDVD Releases for August 23, 2005\n\nAugust 22nd, 2005\n\nEvery week films get a second chance at success from the home market; or, in some cases, a first chance at success. Here is a list of wide releases, limited releases, classics and a few from the growing TV on DVD section. It's a strange week with several special edition releases coming out for movies that range in age from just a couple of years to a couple of decades. The quality also varies from guilty pleasure to award winning classic. It's hard to pick just one DVD pick of the week, and usually I just pick all of the DVDs I'm planning on picking up. However, this week I'll just highlight the top few choices: Harakiri - Criterion Collection - Buy from Amazon, The Truman Show - Special Edition - Buy from Amazon, and Witness - Special Collector's Edition - Buy from Amazon. Any of those would make excellent additions to most people's DVD collections. And out of the guilty pleasures selection, The Transporter - Special Delivery Edition - Buy from Amazon is the best choice. More...\n\nSmiths Still Strong on International Scene\n\nAugust 21st, 2005\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith opened in first place in both the Czech Republic with $180,000 on 20 screens and in Slovakia with $50,000 on 8 screens. The film also remained in first place in France with $2.675 million, Belgium with $635,000, The Netherlands with $490,000 and Poland with $266,000. Strangest of all, the film stayed in second place for the fourth weekend in a row in Germany adding $2.12 million to its $20.6 million running tally in the market. Overall the film has made $143 million in markets where Fox is handling the distribution and may have hit $200 million overall, but there's no conformation on that yet. More...\n\nSmiths' Summer Tour Continues\n\nAugust 14th, 2005\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith opened in Belgium with $1.7 million on 80 screens, easily enough for first place and had a similar result with $480,000 in Poland. It also remained in first place in France with $2.88 million, (despite falling 54% there) and in the Netherlands with $740,000. In Germany the film remained in second place for the third straight week with $3.06 million for a $17.06 million running tally. The film now have $140 million in territories where Fox is handling the distribution and $192 million overall. More...\n\nIsland Vacation\n\nAugust 7th, 2005\n\nThe Island managed a couple of first place finished over the weekend, but the results were still less than impressive. In Australia the film opened with $1.404 million for a close victory while in Hong Kong it earned a disappointing $490,000 over the weekend and $520,000 including previews. It's best market continued to be South Korea with $3.167 million, down 38% from last weekend dropping to second place along the way. On the other hand, no wide openings and a mere 23% drop-off allowed the film to rise to first in New Zealand. Overall the film added $7.64 million to its $24.1 million running tally on the international scene and will opens in several markets this weekend including the U.K., Germany and Spain. More...\n\nLate Numbers Lift Charlie into Top Five\n\nJuly 31st, 2005\n\nEarly numbers had Mr. and Mrs. Smith taking fifth place on the overall international box office charts, but better than expected results has Charlie and the Chocolate Factory overtaking them $6.7 million to $5.4 million. It's biggest single market continues to be France where the film dipped just 6% during its second weekend there earning $3,533,857 for a $9,034,141 running tally. But it was even more impressive in Belgium where the film shot up by 68% to $400,000 for the weekend and $785,000 in total. The film also opened in first place in three markets, Brazil with $1.1 million on 200 screens, Holland with $625,000 on 124 screens, and South Africa with $275,000 on 41 screens. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has $13.3 million so far and opens in a couple of important markets this weekend, (The U.K. and Mexico.) More...\n\nCharlie Appeals to the Sweet-tooth in its International Debut\n\nJuly 24th, 2005\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory opened in three French speaking markets over the weekend and while it didn't finish first, it still had a great start. In France the film earned $3,741,793 in 670 theaters for the best per theater average in the top ten. The result was similar in Belgium ($250,000) and Switzerland ($190,000), giving the film $4.2 million for the weekend. More...\n\nThe Smiths' Honeymoon in Asia Continues\n\nJuly 17th, 2005\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith continues its excellent run in Asia with a $2.2 million opening in 450 theatres in China. The film also added $1.8 million in South Korea for an $18 million running total in that market, (although it was pushed out of the top spot in that market. Overall the film made $4 million pushing its total to $117 million internationally and $275 million worldwide. More...\n\nCompetition Crumbles under Alien Invasion\n\nJuly 10th, 2005\n\nWith the last of this summer's worldwide releases opening last weekend, the international details are once again dominated by smaller films. And to compound matters, most of those are only making noise in one of two markets. However, over the next few weeks there are plenty of big films opening in big markets and the International Details column should start showing signs of life soon. More...\n\nFew Films Open ahead of War's Worldwide Debut\n\nJuly 3rd, 2005\n\nSummer blockbusters continue to squeeze out the competition, so much so that the only real news is about such blockbusters. For instance, War of the Worlds managed $13.35 million during its first day of release on the international scene, which is good, but below expectations. On the other hand, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith broke another record earning $4.96 million during its preview in Japan. More...\n\nSlump Spreads Internationally\n\nJune 26th, 2005\n\nThe international box office is suffering even more than the domestic box office is. In Germany the first six months of 2005 are down 14% compared to the same period in 2004 and Australia also saw double digit decline slipping by 12%. In Spain the total box office is down 8% and it was little better in France at 6%. The U.K. also fell, but at a much more reasonably 1.9%. More...\n\nCorrected - Ruling the International Box Office\n\nJune 19th, 2005\n\nJust when the International Details column was getting back to normal we have another film dominating the international scene. Mr. and Mrs. Smith led in nearly every major / midlevel market and those it didn't were mostly owned by Revenge of the Sith. Because of that there isn't as much news to tell as usual, and with Batman Begins opening worldwide this weekend and in two weeks, War of the Worlds doing the same, this trend will last until mid-July at the earliest. More...\n\nThe Largest Yard\n\nJune 12th, 2005\n\nThe Longest Yard opened in second place in Australia with $2.5 million. On the other hand, the film could only manage $750,000 on 260 screens in Mexico, not surprising since Adam Sandler has never been a big draw internationally, especially outside English speaking markets. More...\n\nLate Figures Change Top Five\n\nJune 5th, 2005\n\nIt was a slightly busier weekend as several studios were brave enough, or foolhardy enough to try and sandwich their film between the worldwide release of Revenge of the Sith and Batman Begins, which debuts in just 10 days. With War of the Worlds' worldwide release just two weeks after that, there's very little room for smaller films to survive. More...\n\nCalm Before the Storm\n\nMay 22nd, 2005\n\nIt was another slow weekend for international details as few studios were brave enough, or foolish enough to try and squeeze in a release between Kingdom of Heaven and Revenge of the Sith. It was hard to find many films that earned more than $1 million over the weekend and most of the activity came from smaller releases in midlevel markets. Next weekend there could be even fewer details as Revenge of the Sith should dominate every market, but after that the summer blockbuster season should be in full swing and things should pick up. More...\n\nNothing Lost in Translation\n\nApril 25th, 2005\n\nThis week's box office leader's opening was brighter than expected and that helped lift the overall box office up 12.25% from last weekend. However, even with such a massive jump, 2005 is still lagging behind 2004 at 5.72% for the weekend and 6% year-to-date. And that's not taking the ticket price increases into account. The number of actual admissions is nearly 10% lower this year. More...\n\nBusy Weekend Won't Help Box Office\n\nApril 22nd, 2005\n\nDespite having four wide releases this weekend the box office is likely to be relatively flat. To be more accurate, there are two wide releases, one semi-wide release and a limited release expanding wide, but such a busy schedule will result in at least one of those films getting squeezed out, possibly two or more. That will leave the overall box office nearly flat compared to last weekend and have it fall further behind with last year. Summer can't start soon enough. More...\n\nMovie Website Launches for April 15 - April 21\n\nApril 21st, 2005\n\nDuring the past week promotional websites for several movies were launched and some older ones added additional content. Here the list of this week's releases, a couple of new sites and few updates, including this week's winner, Kicking and Screaming - Official Site. More...\n\n2005 Preview: April\n\nApril 1st, 2005\n\nApril is one of the weakest months of the year because it is so close to the massive summer box office season. A film released in late April only has one or two weeks at the box office before being crushed by the competition, so studios tend to be wary of what they release at this time. On the plus side, they tend not to dump too many duds either and it doesn't take much for any of these films to please the studios since expectations are low to begin with. More...\n\nMovie Website Launches for March 25 - March 31\n\nMarch 31st, 2005\n\nDuring the past week promotional websites for several movies were launched and some older ones added additional content. Here the list of this week's releases, a couple of new sites and few updates, including this week's winner, The Longest Yard - Official Site.
