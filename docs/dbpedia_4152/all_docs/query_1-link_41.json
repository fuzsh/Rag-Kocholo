        "text": "Thursday 6th April, by Helen Hobday Team Laverne\n\nSolo style Dan Auerbach is ….back (we resisted Auer Dan is back ok, allow it) with his second solo album Waiting On A Song, which is set for release on June the second. This track ‘Shine on Me’, is the first single to be taken from the album and, like the rest of the record, is very much a love letter to Nashville, where Auerbach now lives.\n\nDan Auerbach – Shine On Me\n\nFor the recording of Waiting On A Song, Dan recorded some of Nashville’s most respected players, including Duane Eddy, Jerry Douglas, Pat McLaughlin and Bobby Wood, describing the process as follows “They’d come over, and we’d be in a little room in my house with the door closed, and we’d just write. Monday through Wednesday we’d write, and then Thursday through Sunday we’d record, every week.” The record also marks the launch of Auerbach’s new record label ‘Easy Eye Sound’.\n\nFriday 31st March, by Louise Mason Team Laverne\n\nJames Lavelle has announced UNKLE’s fifth studio album The Road Part 1 with single ‘Looking For The Rain’ ft. Mark Lanegan & Eska. The desire with this new record? To tap into the multicultural landscape of modern London with a mission to unite the eclectic mix of ideas, cultures and genres under the UNKLE umbrella. Ambitious. ‘Looking For The Rain’ is a dramatic addition to our Just Added playlist.\n\nUnkle – Looking For The Rain feat. Mark Lanegan & Eska (Songs For The Def)\n\nAfter a rollercoaster twenty-five year career as an artist, curator and tastemaker, James Lavelle has created The Road Part 1, a collection of fifteen new UNKLE tracks inspired following his curation of 2014’s Meltdown Festival at Southbank. ‘The Road Part 1’ is a collective creative venture by musicians including London folk-rock artist and poet Keaton Henson, Primal Scream’s Andrew Innes, The Duke Spirit’s Liela Moss, long time UNKLE collaboratorMark Lanegan, and Mercury prize nominee ESKA. Lavelle also found new friends and collaborators in Queens of the Stone Age drummer Jon Theodore and Beck drummer Justin Stanley, who make definitive contributions throughout the record. The Road Part 1 is the product of a desire to create something fresh and innovative, that also celebrates the rich history of UNKLE, and showcases a new wave of talent such as Elliott Power, Mïnk and YSEÉ. Looking For The Rain feat. Mark Lanegan & Eska (Songs For The Def) is a first taste of the project.\n\nThursday 30th March, by Louise Mason Team Laverne\n\nFollowing on from their self-titled debut album, All We Are have returned with a brand new track ‘Burn It All Out.’ We almost wore out their 2013 single 'Utmost Good'. We're told this album marks a shift in their sound taking in psychedelia, krautrock and post-punk. The new single makes its way straight onto our Just Added playlist.\n\nAll We Are– Burn It All Out\n\nWith their dreamy, chilled-out indie pop and dance vibe, Liverpool based All We Are have previously been described as the Bee Gees on diazepam (minus the high pitched vocals mind you). Formed in 2011 at the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts (LIPA), the trio have a unique multi-cultural makeup - Guro Gikling is from Norway (vocals, bass), Luis Santos hails from Brazil (guitars) and Richard O’Flynn comes from Ireland (drums/vocals). After their 2013 single ‘Utmost Good’ gained them a reputation in the UK, they supported Warpaint on a European tour before being signed to Domino Records. ‘Burn It All Out’ sets the tone for their forthcoming second album, which according to their manager “reflects their increasing cohesiveness as a unit and their belief in the power of friendship and togetherness in a world intent on driving us apart”. If you dig it they are confirmed to play Latitude, End of the Road and Dot to Dot festivals this summer. More news on the second album will be announced shortly so watch this space.\n\nWednesday 29th March, by Louise Mason Team Laverne\n\nA heavyweight clash of bass echoes and dub sirens – sounds perfect for a Wednesday morning Just Added. It comes in the form of new single ‘Vitals’ from Ninja Tune founders Coldcut and On-U Sound head honcho Adrian Sherwood and features South London’s Roots Manuva. The track is off their forthcoming album Outside the Echo Chamber via Coldcut’s Ahead Of Our Time label.\n\nColdcut x On-U Sound – Vitals feat. Roots Manuva\n\n‘Vitals’ was recorded with fellow On-U Sound collaborators Ghetto Priest, Skip ‘Little Axe’ McDonald on guitar and bassist Doug Wimbish. McDonald and Wimbish formed part of the house band for the pioneering rap label Sugar Hill, providing the music for some of the most seminal records of the era like Grandmaster Flash's ‘The Message', and many others. The single is also backed with a remix by dub innovator and Matumbi member, Dennis Bovell as well as Coldcut and Sherwood’s own bonafide dub. The upcoming electronic dub-pop album promises an outward-looking, globally-minded sound uniting an array of global musicians and vocalists including Roots Manuva, Junior Reid, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry and Ce’Cile – to name but a few – and made in London, Ramsgate, Jamaica, and Los Angeles – with co-producer and fellow dance heavyweight Dave Taylor (Switch & With You). Toddla T also helped to produce 2 songs. Outside the Echo Chamber is released 19th May.\n\nFriday 24th March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nIn case you’d missed the news, Gorillaz are back with a new album and four new tracks. We’re adding the LP opener to our Just Added playlist. Step up the first of many guests on the record, Vince Staples.\n\nGorillaz – Ascension (feat Vince Staples)\n\nHumanz is the new record from Gorillaz, due out on Parlophone Records on 28th April. Produced by Gorillaz, The Twilight Tone and Remi Kabaka and recorded in London, Paris, New York, Chicago and Jamaica, Humanz comes seven years on from the release of albums The Fall and Plastic Beach. Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar), Russel Hobbs (drums) and 2D (vocals) are - as always - joined by a stellar line up of featured artists which includes Jehnny Beth (Savages), Danny Brown, Benjamin Clementine, De La Soul, D.R.A.M., Peven Everett, Anthony Hamilton, Grace Jones, Zebra Katz, Kelela, Mavis Staples, Vince Staples, Popcaan, Pusha T, Jamie Principle and Kali Uchis among others. As always there’s some pretty epic Jamie Hewlett directed goodness released with news of the album too. It takes the form of this 360 / 3D film featuring track ‘Saturnz Barz’ in full, plus highlights of ‘Ascension’, ‘Andromeda’ and ‘We Got The Power’. Gorillaz will headline the recently announced, sold-out Demon Dayz Festival at Dreamland Margate on 10th June and we expect more live news is on the way.\n\nThursday 23rd March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nAll of those reeling from Bombay Bicycle Club’s hiatus last year were happily recompensed with Ed Nash’s excellent Toothless project. Well there’s even better news as last night Jack Steadman (of BBC) announced his new jazz / funk persona; Mr Jukes. Here’s the first single for the Just Added playlist.\n\nMr Jukes – Angels / Your Love feat BJ The Chicago Kid\n\nJack was inspired by his love of jazz, soul and funk for his new project, the result of which is the album God First due on 9th June. This first single is built around a sample from Argentinian jazz icon Jorge Lopez Ruiz, with Jack enlisting BJ The Chicago Kid to add some soulful vocals, “BJ was the first person I collaborated with on this record, and if you listen to the horns in the chorus of this song, that was the feeling I had coming out of the studio that day. Pure awe and excitement. I decided right then not to call this a solo record, but to seek out as many collaborators as I could.” We hear other collaborators on the LP include Charles Bradley, Horace Andy and Lalah Hathaway.\n\nWednesday 22nd March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nOur favourite dance-punk outfit are back and we’ve got an exclusive single play and album news. Chk Chk Chk have enlisted UK vocalist Lea Lea for the first cut from an album that has been created as a tool to “shake it off and dance your cares away.” We approve.\n\n!!! – The One 2\n\n!!!’s Shake The Shudder will be released on Warp Records on 19th May. Recorded at the band’s home studio in Brooklyn it produced by longtime collaborator Patrick Ford at Taaffe Palace, and mixed by dance luminaries Phil Moffa, Joakim and Matt Wiggins, The idea for the new album was born from jamming in Barcelona, and spending months afterwards cutting those recordings into loops to form new songs. Back at home in Brooklyn, lead singer Nic Offer poured over his roommate’s disco breaks. To push their boundaries, the band implemented the policy of more liberal sampling techniques as well as using whatever keyboard was available with the attitude of “there's no such thing as a bad synth.” There are currently four UK dates in May to keep an eye out for – if you’ve never been to a !!! gig THEN GO.\n\nTuesday 21st March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nBrooklyn via El Paso quartet Cigarettes After Sex are one of the biggest word-of-mouth phenomenons of recent times. Two singles down, millions of streams and millions of views, a sold out UK tour and a 6 Music playlist under the belt. Here’s single no.3 for the Just Added playlist.\n\nCigarettes After Sex - Apocalypse\n\nSoon to embark on a sold-out UK tour Cigarettes After Sex have just announced the release of their much-anticipated debut album, Cigarettes After Sex, which will be available 9th June via Partisan Records. ‘Apocalypse’ will appear on said new LP, which as frontman Greg Gonzalez explains, has cinematic aspirations “this is like the novel or feature-length version of Cigarettes. I wanted it to feel like a complete work, where some of the imagery repeats – like it’s all in the same world. It’s very much a fulfillment of the feelings in the short works.” Tickets have all gone for a run of April dates but they’ve just announced a November gig at London’s Roundhouse so keep your eyes peeled to get a chance to grab a ticket for that.\n\nMonday 20th March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nWe’re diving into another week of Just Added tracks headfirst, with a visceral, energising blast of saxophone from our go to multireedist, Colin Stetson. Hold tight, it gets intense.\n\nColin Stetson – In The Clinches\n\n‘In The Clinches’ is the second offering from Colin’s upcoming LP All This I Do For Glory which is due out on 28th April. It follows ‘Spindrift’ which he released in February. Colin’s playing a gig at the Jazz Café in London on the 23rd April, a date at the Workman’s Club in Dublin on 25th and in between, he’s popping in to the Live Room for a session (April 24th). Check out the intimate video for ‘In The Clinches’ to get a feel of what to expect. Over the years Colin has worked with musicians as varied as Tom Waits, Arcade Fire, Bon Iver, TV On The Radio, Feist, Laurie Anderson, Lou Reed, The Chemical Brothers, Animal Collective, LCD Soundsystem, The National, and David Gilmore. Last year you might have caught Sorrow, Colin’s re-imagining of Gorecki’s 3rd symphony, or heard his 2015 collaboration with Sarah Neufeld Never Were The Way She Was. He’s prolific, and amazing and we can’t wait to chat to him and watch his mastery up close.\n\nFriday 17th March, by Izzie Clarke Team Laverne\n\nGrammy-nominated Feist is BACK! It was announced this morning that the Canadian artist will be releasing her first album in six years. Let this title track give you a sneak peek of Feist's defiant new sound…\n\nFeist – Pleasure\n\nThe new album, Pleasure, will be out on April 28th on Polydor Records and follows 2011’s Metals, which was named 'Album of the Year' by the New York Times and won the Polaris Prize (Canada’s answer to the Mercury Music Prize). Pleasure is Feist’s fourth album and is her most expansive work so far. Recorded over the course of three months—in Stinson Beach, Upstate New York, and Paris — the 11-track album reflects on secrets, loneliness and is at its core a study on self-awareness.\n\nThursday 16th March, by Izzie Clarke Team Laverne\n\nWhen Snoop Dogg heard BadBadNotGood’s Lavendar, he just had to get involved and brought Kaytranada along too. We’re Just Adding it because who doesn’t love a bit of Snoop on a Thursday!?\n\nBadbadnotgood X Snoop Dogg – Lavendar (Nightfall Remix) ft. Kaytranada\n\nThe original track is from BBNG's recent critically acclaimed album, IV, and now has a new verse added by Snoop with accompanying artwork from Joe Cool, who did the iconic cover for Snoop’s 1993 debut, Doggystyle . The collaboration came about naturally after Snoop first heard the instrumental Lavender when an engineer was playing it before a studio session. Enamored with the track, Snoop quickly cut a verse to it and the rest is history. Keep an eye out for BBNG who will be playing in Bristol, Leeds and London in May.\n\nWednesday 15th March, by Izzie Clarke Team Laverne\n\nHaving collaborated with NZCA Lines, Bat For Lashes and XTC’s Andy Partridge, Charlotte Hatherley is a bit of a musical genius. The first single from her upcoming album is all about that science fiction realism. And we dig it.\n\nCharlotte Hatherley – A Sign\n\nHatherley will release her new album, True Love, on May 26th with Sylver Tongue. Influenced in equal parts by sci-fi and heartbreak, the album walks that melancholic pop line and was co-written with Michael Lovett from NZCA Lines. This Just Added is about a character called Traveller looking for True Love on a different planet. As a musical polymath, Hatherley has also worked with the likes of Ash, Bryan Ferry, Bat For Lashes, Birdy and KT Tunstall. But her talents don’t stop there, having written the score to the dystopian sci-fi short, The Last Man; Charlotte Hatherley is now beginning to work on her first feature length score.\n\nTuesday 14th March, by Izzie Clarke Team Laverne\n\nThe next release from Joe Goddard’s solo album is here. Ready your ears, because the Hot Chip founder has a disco-sampling, deep house BANGER for today’s Just Added.\n\nJoe Goddard – ‘Home’ ft Daniel Wilson\n\nJoe Goddard reveals the next track from his solo album, Electric Lines, which is out on April 21st on his own Greco-Roman label, via Domino Records. The track features vocals from bright, new, Michigan-born vocalist Daniel Wilson and it’s psychedelic video was directed by Super Furry Animal friend and artist Pete Fowler. It starts with your usual post-rave cab ride home and transports us into a world of purple dinosaurs raving on clouds and floating DJ booths. Joe Goddard has a busy year ahead of him starting with a full UK Tour and then onto Field Day Festival, Parklife, and Latitude, to name a few!\n\nMonday 13th March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nLeyya were labelled as ‘ones to watch’ by Line of Best Fit at last year’s Great Escape Festival, and have since been playing showcases across Europe. You’ll remember us playing ‘Superego’ loads too. Well they’re back and we’re Just Adding their next single because it’s great.\n\nLeyya – Zoo\n\nVienna duo Leyya return with this new single ‘Zoo’ which comes out on 28th April. It follows on from their debut album Spanish Disco which came out on Las Vegas Records in 2015 and featured aforementioned ‘Superego’. Leyya have been busy touring Europe of late, and are heading over here to play the Are You Listening Festival in Reading on 22nd April alongside Anna Meredith, Spring King and Flamingods.\n\nFriday 10th March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nIt was only a couple of weeks that Little Dragon swooped back onto the scene with the super slinky ‘High’. Well here’s more new material with the added bonus of news of an entire album.\n\nLittle Dragon - Sweet\n\n‘Sweet’ is the second track we’ve heard from Little Dragon’s upcoming album Season High which they’ve just announced will be released on Because Music on 14th April. For the record they worked with a range of producers including James Ford of Simian Mobile Disco. They’ve already announced quite a few US dates, but as yet still no work on a UK tour.\n\nThursday 9th March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nHaving embodied 15 different bands for the Belgica soundtrack last year, Soulwax are returning in their singular and original form in 2017. We’ve got the exclusive first play of the next single from it.\n\nSoulwax – Missing Wires\n\nIt’s been over a decade since Stephen and David Dewaele released the last Soulwax studio album, 2005’s Nite Versions. Recorded in the band’s studio in Ghent, Belgium, the new LP will be titled From Deewee and released on PIAS Records on 24th March. Based on the 'Transient Program For Drums And Machinery' live show which the band began touring last summer, the album was recorded in its entirety in one take. “We set out to record these songs live with the exact same setup, machines, and musicians as we had on the road\", say Soulwax of the process. That set up includes three drummers, one of which is Sepultura’s Igor Cavalera. Needless to say, you have to see this live, and there are a run of European dates including Manchester and London shows in April. If you can’t make them, we’ve got a Maida Vale session locked in on the 10th April.\n\nWednesday 8th March, by Matthew Mills Team Laverne\n\nWhen Conor Oberst was in session for us in February, he let us in on an album he’d been working on, Salutations, a companion piece to last year’s Ruminations. Well it’s nearly ready for release, and he sent us the first single from it for our Just Added playlist.\n\nConor Oberst – A Little Uncanny\n\nSalutations comes out on Nonesuch Records on March 17th and includes full band versions of the ten songs from Ruminations, plus seven additional songs. It fulfils Conor’s original ambition to record the Ruminations tracks with a band, but the responses to his solo recordings were so positive that he was persuaded to put them out in their raw original form. After that release in October, Conor headed down to Shangri-la Studios in Malibu to record Salutations with New York's The Felice Brothers plus the legendary drummer Jim Keltner (Neil Young, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and many more). The record was co-produced with Keltner and engineered by long-time musical compadre Andy LeMaster, with guest contributions from Jim James, Blake Mills, M Ward and Gillian Welch. Look out for UK and festival dates in August with The Felice Brothers in tow.\n\nMonday 6th March, by Sarah Evans Team Laverne\n\nEnglish singer, songwriter, guitarist and label boss at Bird, Jane Weaver has performed in groups Kill Laura and Misty Dixon. This is the lead single from her sixth solo album, Modern Kosmology, due out May 19th on Fire Records.\n\nJane Weaver – Slow Motion\n\nThis track is taken from her newly announced self-produced album Modern Kosmology, released 19th May on Fire Records. Can's Malcolm Mooney features on the album and it's apparently inspired by \"automatic abstract painter Hilma Af Klint and her fabled pre-surrealist secret society”. It follows 2014’s album The Silver Globe, which featured collaborators David Holmes, Andy Votel and sound effects from electronic pioneer Suzanne Ciani. Jane’s solo career had begun in 1998 when she recorded the album Supersister. However the record went unreleased. A single from the album was recorded in collaboration with Doves and Andy Votel and was released under the Supersister sessions. Her first album proper Like An Aspen Leaf was released in 2002. Now with her sixth album she has been releasing solo music steadily ever since. Weaver says of writing tracks that they come to her “like fully-formed pictures”. Catch her live at the following dates why don't you.\n\nLive:\n\nMay 18th – Hare & Hounds, Birmingham\n\nMay 19th – Band On The Wall, Manchester\n\nMay 22nd – Lexington, London\n\nThursday 2nd March, by Juliette Ivie Team Laverne\n\nLondon five-piece Ulrika Spacek return with ‘Mimi Pretend’, the first single taken from their second album Modern English Decoration out on 2nd June via Tough Love Records. Awash with jangly guitars and hazy vocals, it arrives less than 18 months after their critically acclaimed debut.\n\nUlrika Spacek – Mimi Pretend\n\nUlrika Spacek formed in Berlin in one night, when friends of 14 years Rhys Edwards and Rhys Williams came up with their band name and the title for their debut album. Since releasing The Album Paranoia just last year, the five-piece are ready to share their follow-up and this new single taken from it. Edwards explains, “Like our debut, we started with Track One on the album and went from there. Making a batch of songs then ordering them after they’re all finished isn't something we have much interest in”. Fittingly then, the new album’s title is a play on an interior design cliché that references meticulous creative processes. There’s also a nod towards the environment in which it was created: a Victorian house turned art gallery turned home studio. “This record was made in various rooms in our house… Doing everything ourselves is not just necessary: it’s important to us, as it allows us to truly create our own world”. While there’s an element of domesticity to the album’s creation, the themes that drive the songs are anything but, reflecting mid-twenties alienation and anxiety, alongside the comforts and burdens of self-awareness.\n\nUK Live Dates:\n\nMarch 8th - Sebright Arms, London\n\nMarch 27th - The Art School, Glasgow (supporting Slowdive)\n\nMarch 28th - Arts Club, Liverpool (supporting Slowdive)\n\nApril 29th - Portsmouth Psych Fest\n\nApril 30th - Festevol, Liverpool\n\nAugust 4th - OFF Festival, Katowice\n\nWednesday 1st March, by Juliette Ivie Team Laverne\n\nToday’s Just Added track marks the signing of young and up-and-coming Norwegian five-piece Broen to Bella Union. It’s the first taste from their forthcoming debut album due later this year, fusing elements of R’n’B, rap, jazz, psychedelia, dub, electronica and improvisation.\n\nBroen - <3\n\nFollowing 2015’s self-released ‘Boy’ and ‘Iris’ played here on 6 Music, Simon Raymonde welcomes Broen to his Bella Union label with this new record. Marianna Røe (vocals), Anja Lauvdall (synths), Heida Mobeck (tuba), Lars Fossheim (guitar) and Hans Hulbækmo (drums) have already built up a reputation as one of Norway’s finest live bands, donning sparkle-laden costumes and sharing bold dance moves rivalled only by their musicianship. Broen say that by lending an ear, “the listener is invited to float weightlessly on the melodic surface and let the rhythm originating from deep below pulsate through their body”. They describe themselves as “a pioneer squid, separated from the swarm, spraying its musical propaganda like ink into obscure Norwegian musical waters”. The release date for Broen’s anticipated debut full-length is yet to be set, but they have announced two shows in London on April 25th & 26th as part of Music Norway’s Oya Nights Festival."
