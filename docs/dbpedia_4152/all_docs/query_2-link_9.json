        "text": "@Grifter Prime There's little doubt that you have a direct line to Kieth. If it were me, I'd say to him that the natives are getting restless.\n\nI get the competition angle on things of late and no one wants to miss the opportunities when they come knocking. I'm sure we all get it. But 9 years is a very long time to wait for these when we've been given multiple assurances of release dates during that time. This leads to a lot of frustration, exhaustion, and outright anger. It may lead some to lose faith in XTB.\n\nMyself, Im good with XTB. I like what they have done. But I also like Fanstoys and others. I don't have one specific manufacturer on my shelves. I even immediately dumped my Takara Ratchet and Ironhide based on the release date we were given for them. But even their dates have come and gone now. I know they are close now with the release of box art, but there's others that should have taken priority.\n\nThen there are great points made about the Protectobots. Not only has Kieth announced a second combiner before finishing this one, but has gone on to release a smaller scale of Protectorbots?!?! What sense did that make? Why the new scale? It's something that just made so little sense to the faithful collectors.\n\nAgain, I get striking while the iron is hot and all, but this is not one that makes much sense.\n\nI and I suspect others have resisted the pull of FT's Sovereign in favor of Abbadon. From what I could tell from the prototypes we have seen, both of its modes show a much more coherent and cleaner transformation. Hence, I chose to stick with my pre-order.\n\nBut since it's been so long now, I would guess a lot of us might have a question in the back of our minds about his price. Is it going to change the same way they did with FT's Blitzwing? Everyone's pre-order was canceled so that the new price could be set that was more expensive. This is likely due to the costs of re-engineering the molds. Will Kieth do the same? I paid mine in full 5 years ago, will I have to hand over more money to get this in hand?\n\nX-Transbots MX-IV Abaddon (Galvatron)\n\nSadly, we lost a good one but not due to age. He was one of the best posters on here and always provided good resources on XTB. He is big reason with Apollyon that I became a fan of XTB and their figures. I didn't start posting here until 2016 but had followed this board off and on since 2007/2008. I can't really remember. I was too damn busy to post working over 100 hours a week.\n\nAbaddon goes back to this... (I know this version was a stolen Jizai Toys design just like X-1 Glider) (Ollie/Wheelie had a similar origin I believe)\n\nX-Transbot Prototype Tyrant of Darkness (Galvatron)\n\nand this...\n\nX-Transbots MX-IV Abaddon (Galvatron)\n\nuntil 539Designs/398 Robots design started this thread.\n\nGoing back to 2014/2015 - Dante/DaVinci, Locke, Virtus, Abaddon, and Zeusaurus (2016) cast a pall over XTB's future and this backlog has remained forever. The new release rollout a couple of years ago promised Abaddon and Zeusaurus and here we are with nothing. Up until that point XTB had never failed to put something out. Now, we know that XTB abandoned Frankenstein (Autobot Spike), Elita-1, Buster, Hydra, and probably the Jailer. XTB has gone to great lengths to destroy their reputation and I have always been a big defender of their designs and have a lot of their figures. All of the 13 preorders I have with The Chosen Prime are XTB except for Maketoys Grandmein. That should tell you something about failure and that I am not some hater.\n\nIn the past, XTB Defensor, Devy, and Ratchet/Ironhide would be instant preorders and purchases for me. I even like the designs. I'm out.\n\nXTB, not once, has ever hit a target release date. They have been very prolific in spurts and released a lot of figures at once. They have the capability but lack the will to communicate and operate effectively. If XTB is going to continue to be tone deaf about Abaddon and Zeusaurus, respectfully, I will be tone deaf to anything they have to say.\n\nThe picture doesn't show up but we are both talking about the same one. I didn't take the time to clarify but the Jizai design had been stolen and sold by I think multiple parties at one point. I didn't follow closely and I am not completely clear on that history. Ollie is clearly a different design. I am more referring to origins from what I heard, ie that's why so early on XTB did Ollie. At the 2016 Chicago TFCon XTB promoted Powerglide and even Brawn and Outback. These are figures they never developed but it is clear the Powerglide redesign was meant to follow up from the failure of Glider. I have that figure.\n\nI had other sources for information regarding XTB that are no longer relevant and have not always panned out. It has not always been clear or knowledgeable about all of Keith's relationships. I knew much earlier than it came about that XTB was doing Seaspray, Deathsaurus, Overlord, Rodimus Prime, leader's strategy for example. Other things are just more obvious like Buster/Hydra on Apollyon box.\n\nIf you right click and 'preview picture' you can see it. This happens quite often on tfw and knowing this can save a lot of back and forth on getting it to work and for people to understand what it was, etc.\n\nXTB wheelie did start as a KO of Jizaitoys, just like their powerglide and KFC Tempest. When they first revealed both Powerglide and Wheelie they showed instructions which are of jizaitoys wheelie. not the ollies we came to know"
