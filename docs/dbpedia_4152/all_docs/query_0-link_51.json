        "text": "I normally don’t do “chick flicks”. Hell, I usually hate any movie that makes me go running for a box of Kleenex and a bowl of rocky road. But there is one movie that I’ve been particularly fond of … it’s one of the DVDs Jim got me for my birthday: Moonstruck, with Nicholas Cage and Cher. I love this movie, I think it’s funny and kind of sweet. (and probably because Cage’s character reminds me of someone)\n\nMy favorite scene is where Cage is trying to convince Cher that he’s the right guy for her, ironic in the sense that he’s describing love in a negative light (rather than the old “Love is wonderful” dime store routine):\n\n“Love doesn’t make things nice, it ruins everything. It breaks your heart. It makes things a mess. We aren’t here to make things perfect. We’re here to ruin ourselves and to break our hearts, and to love the wrong people, and die.”\n\nTo those first three sentences, I say “Amen!” … love does make everything a mess. But without that mess, wouldn’t one feel incomplete?\n\nI would."
