        "text": "I cannot even count those because there are so many repaints/reissues. I left them out to further prove your point about how dire the circumstances really are. If XTB wanted to XTB could get out all of the repaints/reissues in a year and have the most successful year in history and STILL be stuck with this awful backlog. The reason why the Fast/Fury repaints are coming out so fast is I believe XTB runs best when they set up one mold and run all 4 or 8 of their SKUs for it at the same time. More so than other companies they rely on those repaints. By default it is necessarily going to massively slow down any other production/development.\n\nOf these 30 or so figures MORE THAN half have prototypes and maybe more. I have updated my previous post to reflect the current status of these projects. This has been the primary weakness of XTB from the beginning that they have never improved. They can get to 80% done faster than any other company but cannot close the deal. There seems to be some barrier there where they cut corners, play around with materials, cut costs and things go from working to not working as 539 Designs has mentioned. This goes back to Ollie, Ditka, Eligos. There is something going on with their manufacturing engineering team that they have never figured out. Back to the days of 539 Designs I wonder if some of the problems were miscommunication /language barrier, complexity of design, and the back and forth cycle. I have to believe they have more designers especially as KFC appears to have closed shop after God Ginrai. I cannot understand why more urgency has not been placed on KFC.\n\nXTB actually did that a couple of years ago to get from 70+ announced figures to get down below 40 remaining. They then promptly announced more to get back above 40.\n\nI thought of 2 more things to add to your list as well. Until we hear otherwise we should judge XTB by their own history and assume the Defensor and Devastator parts will be separate production runs.\n\nI think you miss my point. I have both Locke's and he's great looking and I have no problems. I applaud them for honoring their commitment. I have Virtus and love him. It took forever, close to 6 years. It's on that list because it was part of the same backlog that lasted for so long and wasn't the focus of getting things done. Those figures are grouped together for a reason. Abaddon and Zeusaurus remain. If those two had ever came out people would feel a lot differently about XTB. Dante and DaVinci were great figures when they came out and brought goodwill with showing of prototypes for Abaddon and Zeusaurus and then nothing happened. This isn't about Virtus, it's about a pattern of failure of execution and communication that has greatly damaged XTB's reputation.\n\nIt was interesting that the youth versions were a fair bit cheaper than the originals. I even wondered if XTB sold themselves short a bit there but I'm probably biased towards toy versions and maybe there's not as much appetite for them as I think (or as I think there should be!).\n\nAgree with your point on KFC too. It's mad that they didn't pick up the pace when Takara announced their Ginrai MPG - that was a chance to nip in.\n\nWas Virtus really that bad? Like, I know he was announced when Fans Toys and MMC were announcing their Springers, and they were the last ones to release by a county mile. But wasn't Dante announced before Virtus, back when Maketoys and MMC were doing their Infernos and before the official one? And didn't Dante come after Virtus?\n\nTo be clear, I'm not contesting @luckyman76's greater point, that XTB's backlog is out of hand and some of their announced products are looking like vaporware. Abaddon is an especially egregious example. But years-long gaps between announcement and release isn't that uncommon with 3Ps. I could be misremembering, but I guess I felt like Virtus was more \"normal\" slow than Dante or Abaddon.\n\nI gave the years in the post you quoted, Dante was announced a year or so earlier, then they released about 3 months apart (based on review video dates). So Virtus was not as long as Dante, but it was still a long haul wait. Of course Abaddon was announced at the same time as Dante (based on thread 1st post dates) and it is still waiting 2 years later.\n\nI feel most 3P companies that have extended gaps do catch heat to one extent or another. Look at the whole \"Where's Bandit?\" thing. I mentioned it somewhere recently, but the heat is a good thing in a way, the fact people complain so much about it proves they still care. If they weren't getting mad that would be a sign they have given up and moved on.\n\nInteresting auto-correct for your first use of Virtus' name though."
