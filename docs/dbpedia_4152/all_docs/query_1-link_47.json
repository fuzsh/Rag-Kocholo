The couple fell in love on the first film's set — and when the Disney Channel flick premiered in 2006, they instantly became teen icons. Their relationship blossomed as millions of fans watched their every move and plastered posters up on their bedroom walls.\n\nEfron and Hudgens stuck by each other's sides through all three High School Musical films and went on to support each other as their careers expanded beyond the halls of East High. Although they called it quits in 2010, the former couple remained friendly, and have each looked back on their time together with fond memories.\n\n\"We grew up together. It was nice to have someone to share all of those experiences with,\" Hudgens said following their split.\n\nFrom their High School Musical auditions to their long-distance romance, here's everything to know about Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens' relationship.\n\nEarly 2005: Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens meet while auditioning for High School Musical\n\nIn 2005, Efron and Hudgens met for the first time when they auditioned for High School Musical.

For some reason we kept sticking around [for callbacks]. I don't know what it was with Vanessa, but we kind of clicked from the very beginning.\"\n\n2005: Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron begin dating during filming\n\nAlthough Hudgens and Efron have never revealed exactly when their relationship turned romantic, Hudgens said it was at the \"very beginning\" of their High School Musical experience.

Their castmate Bart Johnson, who played Efron's on-screen dad, said he often saw the couple hanging out in Efron's neighborhood.\n\n\"Vanessa had a scooter and she'd pull Zac around on his skateboard with a rope.
