Apple also released the iPod Photo, which was the first iPod to have a color screen.\n\n12. LiveStrong bracelets were released and everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, sported one.\n\n13. Uggs (which were already popular) became an even bigger trend. I am sure you knew someone, or maybe that someone was you, who wore them ALL THE TIME.\n\n14.
