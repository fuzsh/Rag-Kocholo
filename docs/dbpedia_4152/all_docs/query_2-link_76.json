        "text": "Full Moon Features puts a modern spin on the classic vampire tale with their upcoming film Death Streamer, and you’re invited to sink your teeth into the official trailer this afternoon.\n\nDeath Streamer will be released by Full Moon on September 27, 2024.\n\nIn the film, “A modern-age vampire employs technologically advanced glasses that enable him to not only hunt his victims in and out of the virtual world…but also LIVE STREAM his bloody feasts for all to see! As this high-tech ghoul continues to glut on his screaming victims, his internet-based cult of personality expands, his fanbase addicted to watching the slaughter.\n\n“But when an intrepid trio of young supernatural investigators lock-down on the trail of the “Death Streamer”, the fiend turns the tables and begins stalking them.”\n\nFull Moon’s Charles Band directed Death Streamer, which stars Maddy May, Emma Massalone, Piper Parks, Llana Barron, Aaron McDaniel, Sean Ohlman, and Kaitlin Moore.\n\nStrange Darling starring Kyle Gallner is headed our way later this month courtesy of Magenta Light Studios, and the final trailer has been released this afternoon.\n\nStrange Darling will release in theaters August 23, 2024. Watch the official trailer below, which is loaded with rave reviews including high praise from Stephen King.\n\nKing calls the upcoming film “a clever masterpiece.”\n\n“We are thrilled to be bringing nationwide theatrical audiences this unique and exceptional film with terrific performances by Willa Fitzgerald and Kyle Gallner. This second feature from talented writer-director JT Mollner is destined to become a cult classic that defies conventional storytelling,” Magenta Light’s Bob Yari said in a recent statement.\n\nStrange Darling is currently 100% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with 21 reviews, one of which comes courtesy of Trace Thurman right here on Bloody Disgusting. Trace reviewed the film out of Fantastic Fest, giving the cat-and-mouse thriller a 3.5/5 star rating.\n\nTrace writes, “Writer/director JT Mollner’s Strange Darling [is] a film that dares us to question the roles men and women are expected to play.” He goes on to say that the film ends up being “a smarter-than-you’d-expect entry into the cat and mouse thriller genre.”\n\n“What we are left with is a grim little thriller whose lofty ambitions prove to be too much for it in the end, but you’ve got to give it credit for trying,” Trace also notes in his review.\n\nDistributed by Magenta Light Studios, Strange Darling is a Miramax and Spooky Pictures Production. The film is produced by Bill Block, Roy Lee, Steven Schneider, Giovanni Ribisi and Chris Ivan Cevic, with Giovanni Ribisi also serving as the Director of Photography."
