        "text": "A few weeks ago I sat with my 26-year-old cousin to watch a movie. We started scrolling through Netflix to find something to watch and we came across What A Girl Wants, and she was slightly taken aback that I hadnât seen it before. But due to the fact that the movie came out in 2003, the year I was born, it made sense why I hadnât seen it. She started asking me about a bunch of other movies from her childhood and teenage years, and not to my surprise, I hadnât seen most of them. So we compiled a list of the best Chick Flicks from the 2000s. Since I hadnât seen about two-thirds of the movies I decided to take it upon myself to watch them, so I could tell you which are worth watching. The list below compiles my 21 favorites from the original list I made with my cousin.\n\nFor each movie, I have included a brief description and where you can watch it. The list is in no particular order\n\n1. Bring it On (2000)\n\nThis movie is funny, sassy, and has some competition. Torrance is newly elected captain of her high schoolâs cheer team, but the Toroâs road to victory takes a shady turn when she discovers their routines are being stolen by the Clovers. Watch it for free with Amazon Prime.\n\n2. The Princess Diaries (2001)\n\nThis movie is everything. It has self-discovery, romance, and a princess. Mia Thermopolis is thrown for a loop when she finds out she is a real-life princess. As the heir to the Genovian crown, Mia begins a commercial journey when her grandmother decides to give her princess lessons. Watch it for free on Disney+.â\n\n3. Freaky Friday (2003)\n\nThis movie is a classic. The one on this list is the 2003 remake but there is also the original version from 1976. This movie is about a single mother and her daughter who couldnât be more different. After getting a strange fortune from a Chinese restaurant, the two wake up the next day having switched bodies. Unable to switch back, the masquerade as each other and in the meantime gaining newfound respect for the other. Watch it for free on Disney+.\n\n4. Mean Girls (2004)\n\nThis movie is Iconic, Revolutionary, a Comedic masterpiece, and everything you could want in a Chick Flick in and more. Cady has been homeschooled her whole life in Africa by her scientist parents. When her family moves to the suburbs of Chicago, Cady finally gets to experience public school. She quickly learns the cruel, tactical laws that divide the students into different cliques. After coming into the good graces of the most popular girls in school, âthe plastics,â she quickly learns exactly why her shallow group of friends got their nickname. Rent it on Amazon for $2.99.\n\n5. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nThis movie is special to me because itâs also my chapter movie. Itâs a heartwarming story of friendship and realistically portrays the lives of teenage girls. After many summers together four best friends go their separate ways. No matter where they are, they are connected by a pair of jeans that they take turns sharing pants that fit all four girls exemplifying their tight bond. Watch with HBO Max.\n\n6. Legally Blonde (2001)\n\nThis movie is one of my favorites of all time. Elle Woods wants nothing more than to marry Warner Huntington III, but thereâs one thing stopping him from proposing: sheâs too blonde. Set on winning him back, Elle gathers her resources and gets into Harvard Law School. Â It has many awesome girl power moments, and Elle reminds us that the way we look does not determine our self-worth and intelligence. Rent it on Amazon for $2.99.\n\n7. The Devil Wears Prada (2007)\n\nThis movie can be an eye-opener for some about the fashion industry. Andy, a recent college grad, wants to be a journalist but ends up as the assistant to the editor of a prestigious Runway magazine. The movie follows her fight for love, career, opportunity costs, and the hard/ruthless decisions you need to make to climb and stay there. Rent it on Amazon for $3.99.\n\n8. 13 Going on 30 (2004)\n\nThis movie is a must-see. 13-year-old Jenna wants a boyfriend and when she is unable to get one she wishes to be an adult. When her wish comes true and she transforms into a 30-year-old, she realizes adulthood is a lot harder than it seems. Watch with HBO Max.\n\n9. What a Girl Wants (2003)\n\nThis is one of my favorite movies on this list. Itâs funny, heartwarming, and I love that the focus of the movie is not on the romantic relationship but on the relationship the main character has with her father. Daphne boards a plane to London to look for her father only to discover that heâs Lord Henry Dashwood, a member of the British upper-class whoâs running for political office. He doesnât know she exists but once finding out, he welcomes her into his home, but sheâs not so sure she fits in with his family. Watch on Netflix.\n\n10.

But when she turns 27 she is deemed too old to be a Bunny. Kicked out into the real world, she stumbles across a college campus and becomes a House mom for a group of geeky, awkward girls. Rent on amazon for $2.99.\n\n11. Definitely, Maybe (2008)\n\nI absolutely adored this movie, itâs sweet, I didnât find it predictable, and itâs very realistic. Will Hayes is in the middle of divorce proceedings when his young daughter asks how he met and fell in love with her mom. Will has flashbacks to 1992 and recounts his romance with three women changing their names so his daughter has to guess which one is her mom. Watch on Netflix.\n\n12. Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)\n\nThis is super funny and different from some of the other more traditional movies. You will definitely have some good laughs and feel some of the heartfelt moments too. Peter Bretter is a struggling musician who gets dumped by his TV star girlfriend, Sarah Marshall. Feeling very down in the dumps he decided to make last-minute plans to go by himself to Hawaii. However, Sarah and her new boyfriend happen to be at the same hotel. Watch on Hulu.\n\n13. How to Lose a Guy In 10 Days (2003)\n\nAHHH Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson are fabulous in this movie. Their chemistry is so good, and itâs super fun and loving.

And once they meet it isnât long before their plans backfire. Rent on amazon for $2.99.\n\n14. The Wedding Planner (2001)\n\nAnother heartwarming Matthew McConaughey movie with Jennifer Lopez.

Juno (2007)\n\nSweet, fierce, and hilarious indie comedy with an incredible cast. This movie is really good and definitely different from your average teen chick flick.

Watch with HBO Max.\n\nThere are many more movies in this genre from the 2000s, that are also really good, but these are just some of my favorites. A few of my favorite movies didnât make the official list because they werenât released between 2000-2009. However, some other really good ones include: Clueless (1995), 10 Things I hate About You (1999), The First Time (2012, I loved this movie, and Iâm a big Dylan OâBrien fan so I might be a little biased), Bridesmaids (2011), Easy A (2010), The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012, more coming of age than Chick Flick but I 100% recommend), and there are so many more."
