        "text": "Watching movies is what I do — for decades as a film critic and for even longer than that, before and since, as a regular human. As a critic, I’m trained to study and coolly interpret the language of filmmakers. Off the clock, I watch to be diverted or to be dazzled, to be comforted or to escape, to be challenged or to try to better understand the world, filtered through someone else’s art. Sometimes this habit has helped me feel well equipped to deal with what’s going on in the world, sometimes less so.\n\nSince Oct. 7, I have felt underequipped. That date has become shorthand for a monstrosity perpetrated against Israelis — and in the months that have followed, Israel has retaliated by killing Palestinians, including countless children, in numbers more awful than the heart can hold. In these past months, despair has hung on my doorpost alongside my mezuza, and moviegoing has felt like thin solace. Still, I look.\n\nThere have been a number of memorable movies this year that speak to historical atrocities and tragedies. “Oppenheimer,” for one, does a pretty stunning job of conveying our human capacity to blow up the planet. “The Zone of Interest,” about the life of a concentration camp commandant and his wife living next door to Auschwitz, makes the sickness that Hannah Arendt identified as the banality of evil impossible to ignore.\n\nBut as I’ve been looking to better comprehend the current moment in the Middle East, the best film I have found is one that came out on Dec. 23, 2005. I’m talking about “Munich,” one of Steven Spielberg’s bleakest, most adult dramas, which — despite five Oscar nominations — was largely considered a misfire when it was released. Today, though, “Munich” reverberates with deep meaning and gravitas. Rewatching the film in this moment reminds us that art can sometimes prick the conscience where hours of political commentary only deaden and that historically based movies are never only about the period in which the story is set or even when the work was made. Movies morph and shift constantly, offering new insights and solaces in relation to the time in which we watch them."
