        "text": "One of Keanu Reeves’ most divisive films has finally landed on streaming, decades after it was first released.\n\nThe Hollywood icon is most known for his roles in The Matrix, Speed and the blockbuster John Wick franchise – which is set to expand even more with an upcoming sequel series.\n\nThe 59-year-old also landed the titular role in supernatural comic book movie Constantine, alongside Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf and Tilda Swinton – which has now been added to the Amazon Prime Movies slate in the UK.\n\nThe flick, based on DC’s Hellblazer comic, demon hunter John Constantine (Keanu) was approached by detective Angela Dodson (Rachel) to help her uncover the truth about her sister’s death.\n\nAs he digs deeper, he unveils a ‘dark conspiracy’ which could threaten the world as they all know it – with talks of a sequel on the way from Warner Brothers.\n\nConstantine hit the big screen in 2005 and landed an impressive audience score of 72%, based on more than 250,000 ratings, compared to a critics’ total of 46%.\n\nDavid Ansen from Newsweek described the film as ‘portentous nonsense’, while a scathing review from Time Out suggested that it was ‘entirely beyond redemption’.\n\nThe AV Club’s Tasha Robinson claimed that ‘virtually anyone but Reeves would have made a better John Constantine’.\n\nHowever, members of the public were a little nicer about the release, as Dee S penned: ‘Highly underrated movie. The cast is stellar, the production is great, and the plot keeps in line with the message of the comics. It’s one of my favorites.’\n\n‘I have watched this several times. It never fails to reel me in. Keanu Reeves is perfect. Peter Stomare is the best film devil I’ve ever seen. Just a really, really, watchable joy,’ Kim C agreed.\n\nAs Steve D said: ‘I should hate the film for completely abandoning the comics. However, it is so effective at what it is trying to do, so creepy and so interesting, I can’t help but love it.’\n\nAnd Chris G penned: ‘While the film shares little with its source material, this turned out to be one hell of an underrated work of art.\n\n‘Constantine does more right than it does wrong and, frankly, deserves a sequel even after all these years.’\n\nLuckily for Chris G, there is reportedly a sequel on the way as Constantine 2 is said to be in the works.\n\nKeanu is set to reprise his role as Constantine, while director Francis Lawrence will also be returning to the fold once again.\n\nAlthough details have been kept under wraps, the Point Break legend previously opened up about his love for the role, and all things Constantine.\n\nHe previously told Variety: ‘I just loved that world, and I love that character.’\n\nWell, until that sequel comes out, you can find us rewatching the first movie on a loop.\n\nConstantine is now available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Stars of ‘the best show of the 00s’ reunite for brand new TV project\n\nMORE : Reboot of 00s ‘greatest TV series of all time’ is ‘definitely’ going to happen"
