        "text": "Hybrid of BBM and Siege.\n\nAnd, at least in mainline, the Sentinel toy is based on the Starscream alt.\n\nWhich I could see making sense. Sentinel is the leader of the Autobots, his squadron is the Seekers, and Starscream is a defector or potentially trying to undermine him from within.\n\nOther than this alt mode heâ€™s had pretty good alt modes mostly. Shockwave though has iffy ones recently\n\nProbably not. But is a vehicle that produces actual sound waves\n\nIt actually looks good in motion. I was surprised!\n\nI think the alt mode is fine, has a enough going on that prevents it from looking like the half baked idea that was the bbm toy\n\nkinda looks like the WFC van alt he had if the lower half was replaced with the BBM version. I don't hate it, actually.\n\nCalling it now, he'll be an A Level deluxe in 2026.\n\nThat soundwave altmode will look horrible if they ever make a toy of it. It looks fine here, but man would it make for a boring toy seeing how they did BB soundwave.\n\nStill dont like that soundwave alt mode, But it looks better here than on BBM, Ill wait till they make a WFC Game soundwave for my cybertronian shelf, Starscream looks great so excited to get his figure next year and hopefully Elita and Airachnid in 2026. This is a really cool poster.\n\nI have to say that is really cool\n\nI am glad to see Sentinel Prime in this promo poster since he has been barley been seen in much marketing for this movie"
