        "text": "Is it too early for Christmas news?\n\nOn the day that Ed Sheeran revealed the story behind six of his songs which he nearly didn't release, the singer has now announced a brand new song for a Netflix animation.\n\nThe new film, called That Christmas, is based on the trilogy of books from writer/director Richard Curtis. Ed has composed a song called 'Under The Tree' for what he calls a 'heartbreaking' scene.\n\nEd announced the news by sharing a post by Netflix UK on his Instagram Stories. Netflix UK also announced the news, writing: 'CHRISTMAS NEWS IN AUGUST: Ed Sheeran has written and recorded an original song for Richard Curtis‚Äô upcoming Netflix film, That Christmas.\n\n'‚ÄúUnder The Tree‚Äù features in the animated film starring Brian Cox, Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker and Bill Nighy. Coming 6 Dec. üéÑ'. (sic)\n\nIn a statement Ed said of the new song: \"I‚Äôve been mates with Richard Curtis for years, and we‚Äôve done a load of fun work for charity, and then both were heavily involved in the movie Yesterday.\n\n\"He came to me two years ago to play me the rough of That Christmas. It was just sketches and voices, but it blew me away. So emotional, yet so heartwarmingly funny, like all Richard Curtis movies.\n\n\"I find since having kids, there‚Äôs a real lack of great animated children‚Äôs Christmas movies, so I thought this was such an amazing thing to make and put into the world.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The scene that we wrote this song for is so heartbreaking, but so real for many people at Christmas spending it without the ones they love, for so many reasons.\"\n\nEd's older brother, Matthew Sheeran, is a talented composer who has composed, or arranged songs by Dua Lipa and Lizzo, and as Ed explained he worked with him on this song.\n\n\"I got to work with my older brother on this which is such a rarity and a gift to work so closely with my only sibling,\" Ed explained. \"It felt so good to create something my children would watch, with their uncle, based in the country they live in.\n\n\"I find it mad that there isn‚Äôt more animated Christmas films for kids, but this is going to become a holiday staple, at least in our household. Hope everyone loves it, and enjoys the song, we had such a great time creating it.\"\n\nWhat is That Christmas about?\n\nThe synopsis reads: 'That Christmas follows a series of entwined tales about family and friends, love and loneliness, and Santa Claus making a big mistake, not to mention an enormous number of turkeys!\n\n'This heartwarming comedy from Locksmith Animation marks Curtis‚Äô first foray into animation, serving as the film‚Äôs writer and executive producer, and also the feature directorial debut of renowned animation veteran Simon Otto (Love, Death & Robots, How to Train Your Dragon films). Nicole P. Hearon (Moana, Frozen) and Adam Tandy (The Thick of It, Detectorists) are producers.'\n\nWhen will 'Under The Tree' be released?\n\nThe release date for the song has not yet been announced, but the animated film will be released on 6th December.\n\nYou can hear songs by Ed Sheeran on Hits Radio.\n\nTake a look through Ed's amazing career:\n\nNow read:\n\nEd Sheeran reveals the hits he nearly didn't release and the reasons why\n\nEd Sheeran's career journey: From street busker to global superstar\n\nCalum Scott joins Ed Sheeran on stage to perform one of his biggest songs\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
