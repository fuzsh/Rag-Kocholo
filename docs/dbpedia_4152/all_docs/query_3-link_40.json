        "text": "Ti West and Mia Goth are at it again with the final entry in the X trilogy: MaXXXine. This time around, ambitious porn starlet Maxine Minx (Goth) pursues stardom in '80s Hollywood. Star-studded like the first film, the third installment also stars Elizabeth Debicki, Moses Sumney, Michelle Monaghan, Bobby Cannavale, Lily Collins, Halsey, Giancarlo Esposito, and Kevin Bacon.\n\nWhile it just hit theaters in early July, it's already available to watch at home. We're unsure of when it will make its actual streaming debut, but you can purchase or rent the film on digital as of Aug. 2. Here's everything you need to know about how to watch MaXXXine from the comfort of your couch.\n\nWhat is MaXXXine about?\n\nAs the lone survivor of the first film, X, Maxine Minx finally gets her big break as a Hollywood actress six years later. But with the notorious (and real) serial killer, the Night Stalker, targeting rising stars, her brush with death is still looming. And her bloody past could come back to haunt her.\n\n\"There's a horrid determination in Maxine, who will not be slowed down by the bodies stacking up on the morgue, her grief, or the slaughterhouse secrets she ran from in Texas. To her, Los Angeles is a place of heat and promise. West paints his setting accordingly, framing Maxine as a goddess, tall and untouchable among the squalid backdrops and the blaring evening news reports of the (real) serial killer known as the Night Stalker,\" Mashable Film Editor Kristy Puchko writes in her review.\n\nTake a sneak peek at MaXXXine in the decked out '80s slasher trailer:\n\nIs MaXXXine worth watching?\n\nOriginally hitting theaters in early July, MaXXXine continues to dominate the box office a month later, surpassing the first two films in the trilogy with a $19.8 million global haul. On Rotten Tomatoes, Ti West's third and final horror installment in the trilogy has a 72 percent critic rating and 78 percent audience rating, which is not too shabby. Compared to its predecessors X and Pearl, though, it falls just a little short.\n\nAs Mashable's reviewer put it, \"Vibrant in sleaze, satire, and shocking violence, MaXXXine was on the brink of being the best West and Goth have made yet. But a bungled ending leaves a sour taste.\"\n\nRead our full review of MaXXXine.\n\nHow to watch MaXXXine at home\n\nJust a month after MaXXXine made its theatrical debut, it became available to watch at home via video-on-demand sites like Prime Video, Apple TV, and Fandango at Home (Vudu). You can either purchase the film for your digital collection or rent it for 30 days. Just remember that once you start watching a rental, you'll only have 48 hours to finish it before losing access. If you'd rather stream MaXXXine instead, scroll to learn more.\n\nAs of Aug. 2, you can purchase and rent the film at the following retailers:\n\nPrime Video — buy for $23.49, rent for $18.49 for Prime members\n\nApple TV — buy for $24.99, rent for $19.99\n\nFandango at Home (Vudu) — buy for $24.99, rent for $19.99\n\nYouTube — buy for $24.99, rent for $19.99\n\nGoogle Play — buy for $24.99, rent for $19.99\n\nIs MaXXXine streaming?\n\nThere's no official streaming date yet for MaXXXine, but as an A24 film, we know it will eventually make its streaming debut on Max (how fitting). Max is the streaming home of new A24 theatrical releases, so the Ti West and Mia Goth film will join other recent flicks like Love Lies Bleeding, The Iron Claw, and Problemista on the service.\n\nIf you want to be prepared, you can sign up for a Max subscription ahead of time. Subscriptions start at $9.99 per month, but there are some ways you can save money on your plan. Check out the best Max streaming deals below.\n\nBest Max streaming deal for most people: Save 16% on Max with ads annual subscription\n\nIf ads don't bug you, Max subscriptions start at just $9.99 per month. You can easily sign up for a single month of service once MaXXXine is released, then cancel before you're charged for another. Alternatively, you could stick around for the long haul and save some money. An annual plan with ads will run you $99.99 per year, which breaks down to just $8.33 per month. That's 16% in savings compared to the monthly plan. The only downside is that you have to splurge on a full year upfront.\n\nMashable Deals\n\nWant more hand-picked deals in your inbox?\n\nSign up for Mashable's daily Deals newsletter.\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nBest Max deal with no ads: Save 16% on a Max Ad-Free annual subscription\n\nCan't stand ads interrupting your movie? There are two ad-free tiers to choose from: Max Ad-Free and Max Ultimate Ad-Free. The basic Max Ad-Free tier will run you $16.99 per month, while Max Ultimate goes for $20.99 per month. We recommend choosing a yearly plan instead, however, as you'll save 16%. It'll only cost you $169.99 per year (about $14.17 per month) for Max Ad-Free or $209.99 per year (about $17.50 per month) for Max Ultimate.\n\nNote: Both tiers offer an ad-free viewing experience, but the Ultimate tier takes things a step further with 4K Ultra HD video quality and Dolby Atmos immersive audio.\n\nBest Max deal for Cricket customers: Free Max with ads for customers on the $60/month unlimited plan\n\nIf you're a Cricket customer on the $60 per month unlimited plan, you can sign up for Max with ads for free. That's a $99.99 per year value for zero dollars. Just do yourself a favor and head over to the Max app (or navigate to Max.com), choose Cricket as your provider, and enter your credentials to login. Then you're free to watch whatever you want, whenever you want — including MaXXXine once it's released. Check out the terms and conditions on Cricket's website to learn more. If you're wanting to watch MaXXXine for free, this is your only option.\n\nBest Max deal for students: Save 50% on Max with ads monthly for one year\n\nCollege students can now score 50% off an ad-supported monthly subscription to Max for 12 months. That drops the price down to just $4.99 per month. You'll just have to verify your student status with UNiDAYS, which will give you a unique discount code, then head back over to Max and redeem your code to stream for half price.\n\nBest bundle deal: Get Max, Disney+, and Hulu for up to 38% off"
