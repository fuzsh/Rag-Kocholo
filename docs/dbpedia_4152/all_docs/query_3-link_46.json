        "text": "Paramount+ is bringing the heat in August with a terrific lineup of shows and movies. Unfortunately, some films like the emotionally moving biopic One Life, are only going to be available on the highest tiers of Paramount+ with Showtime. But that particular movie is a can’t-miss film that features Anthony Hopkins and Johnny Flynn as Sir Nicholas Winton, a man whose actions saved innocent children during the Holocaust.\n\nThe final season of SEAL Team is also premiering this month on Paramount+, but younger fans may gravitate towars the new animated show Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Among the new arrivals in film, Election and An Inconvenient Truth seem very timely. But there are also plenty of fan-favorite titles including Airplane!, Coming to America, Almost Famous, Fatal Attraction, Face/Off, and Pulp Fiction.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCertain titles are only available to Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers.
