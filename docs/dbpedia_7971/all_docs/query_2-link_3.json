        "text": "What is your favorite type of book? Romance, Adventure, Fantasy, etc.? Yet, these books don’t only contain the story, they contain themes that the wise listen to. Every story, every book, every tale, and every movie have a purpose or a theme written mixed in with the plot-the spice of writing. The novel Tangerine, a book about the main character’s(Paul) journey on figuring out how he got blind, is no different. Edward Bloor wrote this book about the valuable and wise lesson about the theme, seeing and not seeing. In this novel, there are many characters, such as Paul, and his parents, that see or don’t see figurately and literately characters of Tangerine are devolved to represented the importance of seeing/not seeing and it retaliation about …show more content…\n\nAnother example of one such lesson is Dad’s white shirt- “Could he have seen it? Could he have seen what Erick did?”. Paul’s dad didn’t see how costly was his investment was. Mr. Fisher had invested everything in the Erick Fisher Football Dream. He had nothing to lose and everything to gain. Why would he tell stop to Erick? That would mean that he would lose everything he had. Paul’s dad chose to blind to what bad things that Erick has done, rather than have the dream and everything else crash on his head.

Now that we explore two types of seeing: fantasy and willing be blind, what other types of seeing wait to …show more content…\n\nNow, there is one special type of seeing-seeing into the future. Seeing into the future is not going to a fake fortuneteller and asking them to see into the future, rather it means making important choices by what is right, not what is easy. “We wanted to find a way to keep you from always hating your brother” is one example where Paul’s parent fail or are blind to see the effects. They thought it would best not to punish Erick and have Paul hate himself for “looking into a solar eclipse”-their excuse on what happen to Paul’s eyes. They were blind to see the ripples their choice had on the timeline; it was the turning point in the timeline of the book. If they had confronted Erick and punish him, much of the book wouldn’t have happened. For example, Erick would have never killed Lucius or done any robbery. Paul would have never had to live the life of fear and intimadation, rather friendship and brotherhood with Erick. Just not making the right choices, or not seeing into the future, you can ruin the life of your love ones.
