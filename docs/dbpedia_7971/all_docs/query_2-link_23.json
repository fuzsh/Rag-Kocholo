        "text": "Article content\n\nTwo centuries ago, on March 11, 1818, the most celebrated of all monsters was born with the publication of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. That novel has since inspired an avalanche of plays, movies and critical studies, and the mere utterance of its title has social impact. Yet there is a problem here: the book is an over-rated jumble that has actually obstructed the advancement of knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

The monster, who is nameless and well-spoken in the book, has often been called “Frankenstein” and rendered mute, among other errors, on film.\n\nHowever, Hollywood may have been right all along, because attempts to render the novel into other forms frequently produce the same result. One of the top Frankenstein experts, Radu Florescu, pointed out that stage productions in the 1820s already portrayed the monster as a grunting brute. Two annotators of the novel, Susan J. Wolfson and Ronald L. Levao, have noted that British prime minister William Gladstone (no less) denounced mules (of all things) as “Frankensteins” in 1838, so the mix-up over the name was occurring by that early point.\n\nPlainly, people love the monster but do not always honour the book. Cultural historian Christopher Frayling, listing the ridiculous aspects of the original story — including the monster’s erudition — has argued that a “parallel text” has emerged, providing greater satisfaction than the actual novel.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd there is much in the novel to bemoan. The title refers to the scientist, but the heart of the book is the monster, so confusion was inevitable. (Imagine if Herman Melville had written a tale called Ahab.) Also, the narrative is awkward, consisting of tedious correspondence and stories-within-stories. Worse yet is Mary Shelley’s ambiguity. Leslie S. Klinger, another of the book’s several annotators, has concluded that Shelley was simply “vague about the means of animation” of the monster. (So Hollywood was forced into inventing all those lightning storms.) Radu Florescu commented that “genuine scientific elements are scarce in the novel,” and that Shelley may as well have been discussing magic. Is this science fiction, or is it horror?\n\nThe tension between science fiction and horror over Frankenstein has never been resolved. Science fiction writer and historian Brian W. Aldiss declared Mary Shelley to be “the first science-fiction writer.” Another expert on the genre, Sam Lundwall, discounted that and instead portrayed her book as a mixture of British Gothic literature and German folktales. Horror critic Gary Westfahl, citing the purported origin of the novel — a ghost-story competition between Mary Shelley, her husband-to-be Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron — says that, “if classified by generic intent, then, it is a horror novel.” Klinger, for his part, avoids either label and just calls the book “the first modern myth.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut science fiction and horror are only part of the mess. Wolfson and Levao emphasize that the book was written in the wake of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. (In fact, the narrative unfolds during the lead-up to those events.) In those days, a reader reasonably could view the story as a metaphor for politics gone crazy.\n\nAnd then there is the feminist interpretation. Even though its author was a woman, Frankenstein is dominated by male characters, but a professor of English, Anne K. Mellor, believes this was deliberate. She says that Victor Frankenstein’s scheme “to eliminate women and become God the Father” is thwarted by the very femininity of the world: “Mother Nature fights back against this scientific attempt to penetrate her recesses and steal her secrets.”\n\nYes, Mary had daddy issues\n\nYet what if none of the above is true and the book is, incredibly, autobiographical? Numerous commentators — including Samuel Rosenberg, Marie Mulvey-Roberts, Daisy Hay, David J. Skal, and Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler — have all underlined the extent to which people in Mary Shelley’s life resembled her characters. Victor Frankenstein, for example, shows aspects of both Percy Shelley and William Godwin, Mary’s cold and remote father. Rosenberg suggested that the monster was Mary’s own mother, the pioneering feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who died in childbirth. The Hooblers went further and linked the monster to Mary herself. (Especially creepy here is the existence of a novella written by Mary but unpublished during her lifetime, entitled Mathilda, which discusses father-daughter incest. Yes, Mary had daddy issues.)\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBy this point, Frankenstein seems incomprehensible. Frances Wilson, reviewing for the British magazine The New Statesman in 2016, was clearly exasperated by the umpteenth volume about Frankenstein and asked: “What doesn’t Frankenstein represent?”\n\nBecause of its shapelessness, Frankenstein has been used as an all-purpose put-down against any number of things. In addition to the hapless mules of William Gladstone, the Confederacy of the American Civil War likewise got the Frankenstein label, according to Florescu. Cultural historian Susan Hitchcock has added Irish nationalists, Adolf Hitler and al-Qaida to the list.\n\nHowever, it is science and technology that have received the most slurs, meaning that Frankenstein has actually impeded human progress. This is very ironic. While the novel is so often held up as an awful warning about experimentation that goes too far, Mary Shelley’s own views — never clear from the beginning — changed over the years. In 1831, she issued a revised version of the 1818 edition that reflected her growing religious feelings. A new introduction pushed the idea of divine retribution, and some references to science in the narrative were even removed. (To cite one: Florescu says Victor Frankenstein’s father lost his interest in physics.)\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRegardless of what Mary Shelley meant, what she set in motion had future consequences, especially for biotechnology. Although nobody really knows how Victor Frankenstein gave life to the monster, biotechnology always gets Frankenstein-related tongue-lashings. In 1999, British tabloids popularized the term “Frankenfood” in connection with genetically modified crops, starting a worldwide panic. Somewhat calmer heads prevailed after a few years, but the taint lingers, and the 2017 essay by the aforementioned Anne K. Mellor dwells on current techniques of genetic manipulation.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nWorld's first human head transplant successfully performed on a corpse, scientists say\n\nIt lives! This nightmare machine is called Shelley and writes bone-chilling tales\n\nRobotics is another casualty. Frankenstein is not about a mechanical man. Nor, despite the efforts of Florescu, is it proven that Mary Shelley was inspired by the clockwork puppets, called automatons, of her era. Despite that, robot enthusiasts have long endured the Frankenstein label. As early as 1983, two experts in the field, Piers Burnett and the unfortunately named Igor Aleksander, complained that, “The roboticists, the heirs of Frankenstein, were under suspicion even before they started work.” Beginning in the 1940s, science-fiction author Isaac Asimov, prompted by editor John W. Campbell, tried to convince readers that robots were not inherently dangerous, but popular culture kept moving towards things like the Terminator.\n\nThus, Frankenstein the novel has itself become a Frankenstein monster, rampaging out of control. Is it science fictional or supernatural? Is it political, feminist or autobiographical? Does it apply at all to science and technology? (And what’s up with those poor mules?) Like a befuddled version of the famous anti-insecticide crusader Rachel Carson, Mary Shelley badly wanted to tell us something … but what?\n\nScott Van Wynsberghe lives in Winnipeg and recalls an incident in grade school in which a classmate — named Mary! — showed off an animal brain, somehow obtained by her father.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
