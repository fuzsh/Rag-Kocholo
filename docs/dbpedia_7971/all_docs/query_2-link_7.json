        "text": "September 25, 2012\n\nTHIS BOOK WAS SO BAD I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT. IT WAS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ. IT IS SO BORING AND DRY. I WILL NEVER READ AN EDWARD BLOOR BOOK AGAIN. I THINK THIS BOOK ACTUALLY MADE ME THROW UP AND I STARTED BLEEDING OUT OF MY NOSE.\n\nDecember 29, 2012\n\nWhat can I tell you except my daughter Phoebe is reading this. She's in 7th grade up here in Washington State and she brought it home and laid it down with a big thud and a groan and \"Here it is, Dad. I can't believe you want to read it too.\" Which is something I'm trying to do: read all the books my two daughters are reading, which is surprisingly easy since kids these days don't do much reading it appears at all in school. Novels anyway.\n\nSo I dug in and was immediately swept up in this story about a 7th grader who moves from the boring suburbs of Houston to a strangely overdeveloped region in Florida - another suburb once proudly occupied by tangerine groves, the best in the world. But this 7th grader is far from boring, he has a spine, a heart, and pair of glasses about an inch thick that become a lynchpin to a much darker deeper secret that had me turning the pages.... turning the pages.... until Phoebe had to rip it from my cold dead hands. \"Dad,\" she said. \"Slow down. You're ahead of me all of a sudden.\" But I couldn't slow down. I finished it just like that. And loved it.\n\nThe real beauty? So much to talk about. With my daughter. With myself. A great self-reflection in what it means to be growing, to be be giving, a piece of fine citrus upon the tongue. Few things are as sweet.\n\nThank you, Edward Bloor. And thank you, Tangerine.\n\nDecember 17, 2013\n\nTangerine by Edward Bloor is a novel about the Fisherman family and their sons, Erik and Paul. They moved from Texas to Lake Windsor Downs in Tangerine County, Florida. One of the sons is legally blind.His whole life he was told that he was blind because he stared into a full solar eclipse when he was young,but doesn't remember.Now he is in a particular time in his life where he is starting out in a new school.Their Dad is also plays a roll in why they moved due to his job as a civil engineer.\n\nWhen they started school Erik was already getting busy with his football dream. His Dad called it the \"Erik Fishermen football dream\" and this kinda left Paul in the blue.After exploring the middleschool, Paul tried out for the soccer team on the first day, he impresses the students with him in soccer.But he is later told by the coach that he is not eligible to play on the team, due to liability issues, because he has an IEP filled out by his mom for him because of his visual impairment.\n\nAfter Paul and Erik get settled they meet Mike and Joey Costello, their neighbors. When football season started for Mike and Erik, Mike was struck by lightening during practice which resulted in him dying. The parents argue about practice and how they thought they shouldn't have it because of Mike's death.\n\nFlorida is known to have many sinkholes and many natural disasters. Soon after, while Paul is at school, a field of classroom trailers at the school collapse into a sinkhole. Many people, including Paul and Joey, try to rescue the people who are trapped and fortunately, no one gets seriously injured. The emergency relocation plan gives the kids the choice to stay with a different schedule and more crowded classes or go to Tangerine Middle School, the school on the other, poorer side of the county.Soon after, Joey starts to get sick of Tangerine Middle because none of Paul's new friends don't think he is cool and he thinks that Paul acts mean around the other students at school, especially those on the soccer team. After almost getting into a fight, Joey finally goes back to Lake Windsor, leaving Tangerine Middle School and their soccer team.\n\nPaul finally has a flashback from his childhood, the day his vision was damaged. Erik said that Paul told on him and his friend Vincent Castor for spray painting a wall in their old neighborhood, so to get back at him, Erik held Paul's arms behind his back and held open his eyes while Vincent Castor sprayed spray paint in Paul's eyes. Paul is furious with his parents for lying to him all these years and finally confronts them about how his vision was really damaged. His parents insist they were trying to do the right thing and protect him from growing up hating his brother, but Paul persists and says that instead of hating his brother, he's been hating himself all along. Paul ends up getting moved to a private school.\n\nI think that the author handled the issues very well. I feel like the story teaches a lesson to the parents to not lie to your children because they will end up finding out everything eventually. Also you're teaching a wrong lesson to your children in which causes a lot more issues. But overall I do recommend this book but sometimes the plot and issues can get a bit confusing.\n\nSeptember 13, 2007\n\nAs I figured out which shelves to put this on, I was realizing that Bloor really tried to pack a lot of issues into a relatively short book and he did an excellent job of it. There's the racism/classism stuff and environmentalism (or lack thereof) and disabilities and how they are dealt with in the school system and lots of inequity that isn't related to race or class and farming and safe driving and sports and bulleying and and and.\n\nThe story is compelling. The characters are beyond believable and this is the sort of book I would love to teach because it has something for everyone who might read it. Too bad the kids I'm teaching now are a little young for it...\n\nMarch 6, 2008\n\nThis is actually the best book I've read before, even though I don't read much. I can relate to it a lot, because it's about soccer, and I play it a lot. In this book, Paul Fisher is a young boy who moved from Texas, too Tangerine, Florida. He goes to a school where he can finally play soccer, but then has a conflict because of his impaired vision. That is a whole different part of the story, my favorite part. His parents have been lying to him his whole life about why he has impaired vision. Erik, Paul's brother, is not a nice brother at all, they do not get along what so ever. Paul is terrified of Erik. Later in the story, you find out the bad stuff that Erik gets into, and how he is part of Paul's vision problems. I recommend this book to anyone, best book ever.\n\nJanuary 19, 2013\n\nThis book was depressing. It's about a little boy who is mostly blind but can't remember why, and is terrified of his psycho older brother, who everyone else thinks is wonderful. There's a lot of soccer, and that's the only part I liked. They lived in some crazy little town where weird things happen. In reality, no one would ever want to live there. People die and there is no real moral to the story, although you do eventually found out how he went blind - and it's horrifying. I finished the book thinking, \"Seriously? I can't believe I wasted my time reading that.\" I gave hours to that book and it gave me nothing back.\n\nFebruary 21, 2019\n\nI wrote an essay for this book in the 7th grade without actually reading it and got 100%\n\n(I did read it eventually, though, obviously)\n\nMarch 2, 2020\n\nthis book made me cry not cause it was sad because i hated it\n\nRead\n\nMarch 1, 2018\n\n\"Tangerine\" is about a blind boy who realizes why he is blind. I thought that this book was so metaphoric. I don't think the story is about the blind boy, Paul, though, I think it is about his brother Eric. I think that this story has a shadow of it, showing the actions and thoughts that make up a psychopath. Eric has caused a lot of trouble by stealing, spray-painting his brother's eyeballs, and killing people. I think that by putting the thought of soccer and football, it relates to all the kids who don't have a good income and depend on these kinds of sports scholarships, especially Cubans who live in Miami or Latina families in California. I think that these kinds of things, like punching, happens all the time, but this book really helps people come to a sense that they may be killing that kid.\n\nDecember 14, 2020\n\nI don't think I have ever been this furious, this hopping-mad, indignant, filled with righteous anger, seething with a Jane Eyre type impotent rage, as when I was reading this novel. Lemme think about it? Nope. Never. This is the only one.\n\nBecause I kinda figured out what was happening and what was the reason behind our hero's tragic condition. What had happened? Now that is something really revolting. Not to mention, unfair.\n\nLook, I get it; parenting is hard. Not everyone is cut out to be parents and certainly, some shouldn't even be one. But the level of negligence and utter neglect not only takes the cake but the entire goddamn bakery, too. In fact, it took the Red Riding Hood Bakery, one of my favorite places here in my new personal wasteland.\n\nWhat do you do when someone who hurts your child is also your child? For sure, no child should be exempt from accountability nor from your succor and more importantly unconditional love and parental support. How do you forgive one while aiding the other? Here, they did one but not the other. The promises made silently, do they get lost in the shuffle somehow? How do you protect a child, and here's a truly important question; how do you punish one, the one who is guilty? If you are absolving the remorseless one, then you are the one who is guilty, not just someone who benefits from your biased treatment.\n\nOur brave protagonist's eyesight was impaired in this book, but it was his parents who were truly blind. In spite of his handicap, he saw things he wasn't supposed to. But despite his skin, he had a thicker skin. Love the grandparents though.\n\nMore of this kind of YA, please. Very confident writing I must say and I will say the author has a firm grip on his pen. Watch out for his Crusader, too. One of the best YA around. Read it. Read them both.\n\nI guess you'll have to read this novel to know what I am rambling about so incoherently, now don't you?\n\nJuly 23, 2021\n\nNot bad! I read this for school, in seventh grade. It was honestly quite good!\n\nThere were many morals and themes which were portrayed throughout the book.\n\nHowever, there were some parts which were slow, which is why I took off one star.\n\nBut, otherwise I enjoyed it. It was quite fun discussing this book with my classmates. :)\n\nJune 24, 2008\n\nI read it in 7th Grade in school as required reading. Out of all the books I read that year, I personally found \"And Then There Were None\" by Agatha Christie was (and is still) the best. However, this came in second.\n\nThis book about a boy who is nearly blind and moves to Florida. The book generally was quite nice. However, I felt the plot was a tad bit weird, and the description of how he was blinded somewhat creepy and icky. However, overall, it was an ok book to read that someone else might have enjoyed more.\n\nSeptember 25, 2012\n\nso horrible made me dislike words\n\nAugust 1, 2014\n\nI live in Tangerine. Well, at least near it. The real town of Tangerine is in Orange County, Florida, about ten miles south of where I live in Lake County, and the resemblances between the fictional town and the real one are close. That's what drew me to the book, but its story kept me going. There are two boys in this family, who have just moved to a large cookiecutter house in Lake Windsor, a swanky subdivision in this town northwest of Orlando. Older son Erik: football hero, egotistical, nasty. Archetypal older brother. Younger son, Paul, our hero: introspective, alert, insightful, analytical, and - oh, yeah - a fierce soccer player, a strength ignored by the football-crazy father and tolerated by the social climbing mother. He wears thick glasses, and there's a mystery here: something in his past caused his eye problems, but no one talks about it and he can't remember. Tangerine the town is a character in the story, too, because it was the heart of the tangerine business in Florida, and its original residents are Latino families of a different social class. They go to Tangerine Middle and High Schools, and Paul and Erik are at Lake Windsor Middle and High Schools. Paul discovers that the soccer team at Tangerine is better - and meaner - than the one at Lake Windsor, and he asks for a transfer. As the story develops, we see Paul generate deep relationships with Tangerine and its students as Erik demonstrates his truly evil nature. Erik almost becomes a football star, but falls in a stunning ending. Paul learns about true friendship and leadership - and discovers why he has eye trouble.\n\nOccasionally you realize this book was written 15 years ago (the tech stuff gives it away), but the story is timeless, so that makes no difference. No \"social problems\" creep in - no drugs, no pregnancies, no hint of sexuality. The story is about how kids get along, and about soccer. It's well constructed, well written, worth a read.\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\nOkay, so I had to read this book last year in my literacy class and let me just say that it was absolutely HORRIBLE. I don't know how to explain just how bad it is, it almost literally made me want to throw the book off a cliff because there would be no other use for it. Well, maybe we can use it as kindling. BUT NOTHING ELSE. The older brother SPRAYED SPRAY PAINT INTO HIS FREAKING EYES; IT MADE HIM LEGALLY BLIND. This book disappointed me on Brobdingnagian proportions.\n\nMay 26, 2017\n\nOne of the worst books. DO NOT READ!\n\nFebruary 3, 2018\n\nI absolutely despise this book. Lterally the worst thing i've read for school, its a long pointless conveyor belt of themes that lead nowhere and characters with no archs wrapped up in pretention.\n\nFebruary 18, 2016\n\nFudge! I wrote a status update for this book, but it didn't update as I put \"I've finished this book\" instead... So sad... I cri evry tim. Okay... So part three of this book is the best part! It gets so tense and extremely suspenseful near the end. It has some extremely funny parts and some sad parts. It finally reveals why Paul has impaired vision. Something that kind of made me very mad is that :\n\nSPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT. YOU HAVE BEANED WARNED.\n\nErik did not get his proper punishment, I felt like he too, should have been arrested.\n\nIt ends off with Paul and his mom at the mall, and Paul going to the Church school thing.\n\nI didn't like that Luis died, I felt he should have been a much more major character. He is the tangerine so why isn't he a major character, he would have connected very well with Paul.\n\nI also dislike the fact that Paul has no girlfriend, when I heard about Kerri back in page... 37? I thought they would have been dating.\n\nSPOILERS END HERE.\n\nOverall the book is very good and I definitely recommended to anyone who is interested in a comedic, mystery and action type of book. 10/10 - IGN.\n\n#DuaneIsTheRealMVP\n\nMarch 4, 2009\n\nThe sibling conflict in \"Tangerine\" is raw, heartbreaking, frightening, and maddening. Bloor reveals the pivotal source of the conflict in slow, re-captured memories, until the climax, when the main character, Paul, understands both the past and the present. Bloor wrestles with the past and present throughout the book -- in form and content; at times, he loses command of past-tense and present-tense forms and the sense of timing and narrative flow falls out of whack. Paul's first-person POV accentuates the reader's perception of the wicked older brother and heartless parents. He is an unreliable narrator, albeit a likable one, because of his limited life experiences, poor vision, and hazy memories. Bloor's character development is rich and steady-handed. The reader can see these people living in Tangerine, Florida, and feel for their situations or marvel at their short-sightedness. Bloor taps the reader's desire to cheer for the underdog -- a desire for fairness and truth -- to keep the pages turning.\n\nJanuary 27, 2008\n\nThis book made it into my top ten of all time the day I read it and has never left.\n\nIt has everything I like in a book- funky setting, offbeat characters, and a great story.\n\nOne of those rare books that is loved by almost everyone who reads it.\n\nFebruary 7, 2009\n\nI absolutely, 100% despise this book! In my opinion, both the plot and the characters were poorly developed, making it a boring read.\n\nFebruary 22, 2016\n\nWarning this review has spoiler. So in the part 3 Paul goes and jump at a couch right and the get called to the principal. They got a X-ray right then he get xspelled. Erik goes to jail yeah to jail\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 24, 2016\n\nThis is the best book ever.\n\nSeptember 10, 2019\n\nI've read this before, but I didn't get to finish the whole book. So I decided to reread it from beginning to end. It surely brought me back old memories, but, more importantly, it hit me with a surprise.\n\nOne scene in the book stood out to me, how Paul was treated differently in Lake Windsor Middle School because he was in IEP. What's worse was that he couldn't play soccer because the program was holding him back. Also, teachers alike were treating him as someone \"special\" who needs care. I know he felt in a way because I was in IEP in both middle school and high school, how I've been treated differently and the fact that I couldn't learn stuff that other kids were because it was \"too hard for me to understand.\" I wanted to be treated as a normal kid, not someone special. I guess that's one reason why I loved this book.\n\nBut throughout the story, Paul gets to meet new friends and start fresh. And hopefully, he'll begin to be confident in himself which he shows showing how much he's improving. I mean, outside of his home, Paul's never scared. But when Erik, his big brother, comes around, he hides. I'm sure it's because something terrible happened to him, and it involves around Erik. It's too bad that everyone, especially his parents, were so oblivious and paid more attention to Erik and his future but not Paul, which saddens me.\n\nHopefully, everyone will enjoy this book if they read it. Believe me when I say it.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nSeptember 12, 2007\n\nPaul is the goalie for his soccer team despite the fact the he is practically blind. His parents hardly notice that he is a gifted soccer player becasue he is completely overshadowed by his older brother, Erik. His father is particularly obsessed by Erik and his chances of getting a football scholarship at a big college. Paul is the only one who notices that Erik is not a nice person, to say the least. The book begins as the family moves to Tangerine, Florida. One of the things that I particularly liked about this book was how I was transported to a place so completely different than the Midwest. The orange groves, the people, the weather--all were alien to me. What really makes this book great, though, is Paul and his experiences at a new school with new friends (and enemies) and a new soccer team. Even if you do not like soccer, you will like this book. It is a great mystery that is funny and dark at the same time. READ IT! Really, you will not be sorry you did.\n\nDecember 5, 2014\n\nI think the story was funny and sad but cool because Paul played soccer and he thought he was the best goaley in the world. And then Paul moves to a new town call tangerine he meets a new friend Joey and they both play soccer and tangerine middle school. Then a sink hole comes and destroys the school and Paul goes to a new school tangerine middle then he meets new friends and then at the end they Paul's bother and his friend goes to jail for killing pauls friends brother.\n\nFebruary 22, 2016\n\nErick can be a men person because he made fun o f mike Costello. Paul thinks that Erik is a mean and cruel person.\n\nMay 23, 2013\n\nEdward Bloor's novel, Tangerine, has too many different plots and themes to have an identity. On one hand it is a soccer story; on another hand it is a story about race and the urban school setting; also it's a story about a boy who can't remember something bad that happened to him long ago. It works best as a soccer story, as the other two stories grow cliche and uninteresting. It's not that this is a bad story. For the first 200 pages it's an engrossing tale, but it's in the last 100 pages that the story begins to go downhill. Way downhill.\n\nBecause of his dad's work situation, Paul Fisher and his family have moved to Tangerine Country, Florida, a place where tangerine oranges aren't quite as common as they once were. Despite his thick glasses, Paul sees a lot of things nobody else does. For one, he's touchy about being called legally blind. My first hope was that he was in denial of his physical defect, but as the story goes on it's clear that his eyesight is fine. It's Paul's parents who insist he's legally blind - they're the ones in denial. This sets the tone for the sophistication level of the novel. Rather than feature an unreliable narrator, it features a middle school teenager who knows more than the adults.\n\nPaul knows that his brother, Erik, is a bad person. Everyone else, especially his father, only see a future professional football kicker, and the star of his new high school team. Some of the aspects regarding Erik are quite effective. We get a glimpse at parents who witness, firsthand, some of the atrocities their son carries out, but choose to turn a blind eye as though they don't want to admit that side exists. Paul also knows the real reason why it is the town's expensive koi have been disappearing from the pond. The adults are just too dim to notice it themselves.\n\nWhat Paul is most interested in, however, is soccer. He tries out for the middle school team, but because his mom labeled him as legally blind he is not eligible to play. However, a large sinkhole destroys more than half of the school, which is made up of portable classrooms, and Paul decides to take the option of transferring to Tangerine Middle School. Tangerine Middle is a tough place. It's an urban district where whites are in the minority, but it's an opportunity for Paul to begin his soccer hobby anew. He tries out for the largely Hispanic soccer team, sans the legally blind tag, and makes it as a reserve goaltender.\n\nWhat I like about the soccer elements is that they are nice and easygoing. The focus isn't on glory and victory (though the team is very good), and Bloor seems to be making the point that the importance of sport is not to win, but to improve one's self and create positive relations with others. Though Paul is technically the back-up goalie, which inevitably means he'll get his big chance at the end, for the most part he plays offensive positions, and it turns out he's not a bad soccer player. He solidifies his position on the team when, after taking over for the team's best player, he scores a goal. That player, Victor, slaps him a high-five and all tensions regarding Paul's higher-class status disappear.\n\nThe novel's attempts to develop the relations between Paul and his teammates off the field, however, fall flat. This is largely because the Hispanic characters are one-dimensional and the off-the-field meetings are too forced. Paul becomes closest with Tino, and we learn that Tino's older brother, Luis, is busy inventing a new type of tangerine. Paul spends time at Tino's hut and learns about tangerine trees, and in one crucial moment even helps protect the young trees during a freeze. Learning about the tangerine trees served as the novel's dullest moments, particularly during the freeze. Don't get me wrong, I love gardening, but the sections with the tangerine trees do nothing to move the story forward or provide any memorable information about the trees. The reader just learns what a chore it is to do the job - and to read about it.\n\nThe story involves a lot of freak environmental occurrences, such as the sinkhole. Lightning suddenly strikes a kid on the football field, and the suburbs are plagued with the smell of an ever-burning muck fire. These environmental issues seem to serve as a warning - no matter how much money you have you can't escape mother nature. The upper-class families that live in the suburbs attempt to fix the problems with money, to no avail. Some of the problems, in fact, occur because of greed and vanity. What other reason are football practices held during the most lightning-prone time of the day? The football team wants victory at all costs. Even in the sinkhole we learn about gross negligence that could have prevented damage to the school property. As nice as these themes are, they do little to prevent the novel from delving into strange territory for the novel's final act.\n\nThe soccer season serves as the story's anchor. Soccer season is the one constant surrounded by many of the events described above. So once page 200 hits and soccer season is over, the novel loses its anchor and drifts into bad seas. Characters begin behaving in bizarre ways. Late in the novel, Paul makes horrible decisions for the sake of his Hispanic friends and, strangely, the novel seems to condone what he does. Characters undergo convenient changes as though suddenly realizing the error of their ways. Characters also become one-dimensional, or at least they are more noticeably one-dimensional. The tragedy is that the novel was rather good for a long while. It's a shame Bloor wasn't able to stay true to his characters and his story. The novel ends up doing too much, when it would have benefited from further developing a single story line.\n\nOctober 8, 2009\n\nThis just might be the greatest debut novel since Brian Jacques had \"Redwall\" published in the mid-1980s, and I do not say that without much pause.\n\nThe pulse-pounding ebb and flow of Edward Bloor's fantastic story grabbed me by the throat from the very first pages and never relinquished its grip through harrowing twist after harrowing twist. Action and adventure of a rarely seen superiority flood over and under and within the text all the way through, transforming the perception of the reader and plunging him or her directly into the cataclysms of the protagonist Paul Fisher and those who are in his life.\n\nTangerine moves along with brilliant pace and breathtaking speed, never predictable, never anything but extraordinary, never not frightening and mysterious and keenly provocative of every emotion in the spectrum of the human experience.\n\nEdward Bloor also writes tangibly and thoughtfully about human feeling through the eyes and life of a seventh grader, and does so with remarkable depth of perception. There is enough A-1 material in the pages of Tangerine to form three or four high-quality books, but he has blended these glowing pieces into a single rich, vibrant, stirring novel that will not ever be forgotten by anyone who turns its pages, I am sure.\n\nAlso, who ever thought that a writer could make soccer seem truly suspenseful and interesting to an American who doesn't take an interest in the game? This was certainly the case for me in relation to this book.\n\nI give Tangerine my proud, enthusiastic recommendation, and I now view Edward Bloor as one of a limited number of juvenile novelists to really watch for closely in the future."
