It was based on the 1965 television serial The Crusade.\n\nPublisher's summary[]\n\n1966 Frederick Muller edition[]\n\nFrom unknown Space, the Tardis returns to Earth, but not to the world Ian and Barbara know. The little blue telephone box has wheeled sharply in the cosmos and cut back through the pattern of history to the struggle between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin, Crusader v. Saracen.\n\nWhen Barbara is captured by the Saracens and later kidnapped by the monstrous El Akir, Ian appeals to Richard for help, but despite having achieved a splendid victory over Saladin at Arsuf the English King has his own troubles and cannot assist him. So Ian sets out to rescue Barbara alone, while the Doctor becomes involved in court intrigues.\n\nIn a dramatic climax, Ian finds himself fighting for his life in the harsh, cruel world of the twelfth century, where only the cleverest and strongest survive.\n\nReaders of Doctor Who's adventure with the Daleks and Doctor Who and the Zarbi will find here all the excitement that made those books firm favourites with youngsters of all age groups.\n\n1967 Green Dragon edition[]\n\nBack through time go Dr. Who, Ian and Barbara - back to the twelfth century, to Richard the Lionheart and the Crusades.\n\nBarbara is captured by the Saracens. Adventure piles on adventure as Ian and Dr. Who, in their different ways, attempt to rescue her. This is a book brimful of excitement!\n\n1973 Target Books edition[]\n\nBack on Earth again, Tardis lands DOCTOR WHO and his friends into the midst of the harsh, cruel world of the twelfth-century Crusades. Soon the adventurers are embroiled in the conflict between Richard the Lionheart and the Sultan Saladin, ruler of the warlike Saracens.\n\n`They're well-written books-adventure stories, of course, but with some thought...the creation of the character of the Doctor had a touch of genius about it.' Westminster Press\n\n1982 Target Books edition[]\n\nWithin minutes of the TARDIS' arrival on twelfth century Earth, the First Doctor and his companions are in serious trouble.\n\nThey happen to intercept a Saracen attack on Richard the Lionheart, thereby enabling the English King to escape otherwise certain capture.\n\nBut Barbara is kidnapped and carried off by the Saracens to the Sultan Saladin's court.\n\nSaladin spares her life -- on condition she entertains his court by telling stories. And, like Scheherazade, if she fails, then she must die...\n\n2011 BBC paperback edition[]\n\n\"I admire bravery, sir. And bravery and courage are clearly in you in full measure. Unfortunately, you have no brains at all. I despise fools.\"\n\nArriving in the Holy Land in the middle of the Third Crusade, the Doctor and his companions run straight into trouble. The Doctor and Vicki befriend Richard the Lionheart, but must survive the cut-throat politics of the English court. Even with the king on their side, they find they have made powerful enemies.\n\nLooking for Barbara, Ian is ambushed — staked out in the sand and daubed with honey so that the ants will eat him. With Ian unable to help, Barbara is captured by the cruel warlord El Akir. Even if Ian escapes and rescues her, will they ever see the Doctor, Vicki and the TARDIS again?\n\nThis novel is based on a Doctor Who story which was originally broadcast from 27 March–17 April 1965.\n\nFeaturing the First Doctor as played by William Hartnell, and his companions Ian, Barbara and Vicki.\n\n2016 BBC hardcover edition[]\n\nFrom unknown Space, the Tardis returns to Earth, but not to the world Ian and Barbara know. The little blue telephone box has wheeled sharply in the cosmos and cut back through the pattern of history to the struggle between Richard the Lionheart and Saladin, Crusader v. Saracen.\n\nWhen Barbara is captured by the Saracens and later kidnapped by the monstrous El Akir, Ian appeals to Richard for help, but despite having achieved a splendid victory over Saladin at Arsuf the English King has his own troubles and cannot assist him. So Ian sets out to rescue Barbara alone while the Doctor becomes involved in court intrigues. In a dramatic climax, Ian finds himself fighting for his life in the harsh, cruel world of the twelfth century, where only the cleverest and strongest survive.\n\nReaders of Doctor Who’s adventure with the Daleks and Doctor Who and the Zarbi will find here all the excitement that made those books firm favourites with youngsters of all age groups.[1]\n\nChapter titles[]\n\nPrologue\n\nDeath in the Forest\n\nThe Knight of Jaffa\n\nA New Scheherazade\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune\n\nThe Doctor in Disgrace\n\nThe Triumph of El Akir\n\nThe Will of Allah\n\nDemons and Sorcerers\n\nDeviations from televised story[]\n\nMention is made of a trip where the TARDIS crew encountered the talking stones of the tiny planet Tyron in the seventeenth galaxy.\n\nBarbara and Vicki play Martian Chess in the TARDIS at the start of the novel.\n\nThe Doctor has a lengthy discussion with Ian about altering time and the rights and wrongs in the universe.\n\nDavid Campbell, who Susan Foreman left the TARDIS in The Dalek Invasion of Earth to marry, is referred to in the opening chapter of this novelisation as \"David Cameron\". (His UK prime minister namesake was born a year after the book was published.)\n\nFerrigo is killed by Saladin's soldiers while trying to flee the palace.\n\nThe Doctor flees the court after Richard accuses him of giving away his plan to Joanna, rather than Richard realising the Doctor is innocent as in the television version.\n\nEl Akir manages to inflict several strokes of his lash on Barbara before Ian rescues her. Barbara is relieved and pleased that Ian found her with an unbroken spirit. Resilient to the last. He kisses her gently on the forehead for comfort and apologises for not arriving sooner.\n\nEl Akir is strangled and then thrown against a wall so a blow on the head kills him, rather than being stabbed, by Haroun.\n\nWriting and publishing notes[]\n\nIn 1973, this novel, along with the two preceding Frederick Muller books, was reprinted by Target Books, launching its long-running line of novelisations. The hardback edition illustrations were retained.\n\nQuickly sold out of the first 20,000 copies and was reprinted.[which?]\n\nTitle page of the Target edition includes: “THE CHANGING FACE OF DOCTOR WHO. The cover illustration and others contained within this book portray the first DOCTOR WHO whose physical appearance was later transformed when he discarded his worn-out body in favour of a new one.”\n\nThe BBC Books paperback edition, released on 7 July 2011, features an introduction by Charlie Higson, best known for writing the Young Bond novel series, focusing on the adventures of a teenaged James Bond. He later wrote the Ninth Doctor eshort The Beast of Babylon.\n\nThe 1965 first edition was the first Doctor Who novel to include an image of the TARDIS on the cover. It was also the first novelisation cover to not depict the Doctor (this wouldn't happen again for more than a decade).\n\nA hardcover facsimile of the 1965 Frederick Muller release was published by BBC Books on 3 November 2016.\n\nThis novelisation was later released as part of The History Collection.\n\nThis novelisation uses the terms \"Negro\" and \"Negress\" when referring to the Arab characters. While these were common and acceptable terms for Middle Eastern men and women when the novelisation was written, they are no longer in use in the twenty-first century due to now being deemed racist. The “Between the Lines” included in 2011 reprint mentions this as a “very clear sign of the times this book was written”.\n\nAdditional cover images[]\n\nIllustrations[]\n\nFrederick Muller edition (1966)[]\n\nIllustrations by Henry Fox\n\nGreen Dragon edition (1967)[]\n\nIllustrations by an uncredited artist\n\nBritish publication history[]\n\nFirst publication:\n\nHardback\n\nW.H.Allen & Co.
