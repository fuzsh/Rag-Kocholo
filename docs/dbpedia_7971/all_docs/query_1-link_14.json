A spirited, rambunctious girl, Annie is struck down in 1933 by the summer plague, polio. As compensation, however, she finds she has been given an extraordinary power: The ability to summon people to her in the in-between time. Annie uses her gift to summon the four most powerful men in the world—Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler, and Joseph Stalin. The four interact with Annie, her family, and each other—at first with comic, but finally with tragic, consequences."
