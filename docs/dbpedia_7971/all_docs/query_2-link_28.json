The story has been retold in recent movies, where Godâs truth is sometimes replaced by science or the imagination of Hollywood Screen Writers.\n\nFor this morningâs lesson at BLCF, we will focus our study on âThe Rainbow Covenantâ. You may ask the question: âWhat is meant by the term covenant?â Websterâs Online gives us a couple of definitions which may help us understand. Websterâs definition is as follows:\n\nCovÂ´e`nant Pronunciation: k?vÂ´?-n?nt noun\n\n(Theology) The promises of God as revealed in the Scriptures, conditioned on certain terms on the part of man, as obedience, repentance, faith, etc.I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.- Genenesis xvii. 7. A solemn compact between members of a church to maintain its faith, discipline, etc. (Law) An undertaking, on sufficient consideration, in writing and under seal, to do or to refrain from some act or thing; a contract; a stipulation; also, the document or writing containing the terms of agreement.\n\nhttp://www.webster-dictionary.org/definition/Covenant\n\nThe Biblical use of covenant describes an agreement between God and either an individual or people. Scholars generally agree that the Scriptures contain about ten covenants. These ten can be divided into one of two types: either unilaterally coming from God or bilaterally between God and the individuals or people.\n\nLooking at the chart inside the bulletin, near the bottom left (shown here, above), you can get a brief overview of Godâs Covenants found in the Holy Scriptures. Six of the Unilateral Covenants are concerned with obedience, sin, the Flood, the descendants of Abraham, and the Ten Commandments. The three Bilateral Covenants are referred to as Blood Covenants, involving the patriarchs, Israel, and all believersâ salvation. The final covenant is unilateral, which we refer to as the New Covenant between God and believers in the Gospel of Christ.\n\nLet us continue with the story of Noah and Godâs Rainbow Covenant, which begins in Genesis 6:1, and ends in Genesis 9:17.\n\nNoahâs Ark and the Flood â Story Summary (from about.com):\n\nGod saw how great wickedness had become and decided to wipe mankind from the face of the earth. However, one righteous man among all the people of that time, Noah, found favor in Godâs eyes. With very specific instructions, God told Noah to build an ark for him and his family in preparation for a catastrophic flood that would destroy every living thing on earth.\n\nGod also instructed Noah to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, along with every kind of food to be stored as food for the animals and his family while on the ark. Noah obeyed everything God commanded him to do.\n\nAfter they entered the ark, rain fell on the earth for a period of forty days and nights. The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days, and every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out. As the waters receded, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. Noah and his family continued to wait for almost eight more months while the surface of the earth dried out.\n\nFinally after an entire year, God invited Noah to come out of the ark. Immediately, he built an altar and worshiped the Lord with burnt offerings from some of the clean animals. God was pleased with the offerings and promised never again to destroy all the living creatures as he had just done. Later God established a covenant with Noah: âNever again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.â As a sign of this everlasting covenant God set a rainbow in the clouds.\n\nPoints of Interest from the Story:\n\nGodâs purpose in the flood was not to destroy people, but to destroy wickedness and sin. â¢ With more detail, God instructed Noah to take seven of every kind of clean animal, and two of every kind of unclean animal. Bible scholars have calculated that approximately 45,000 animals might have fit on the ark. â¢ Genesis 7:16 interestingly points out that God shut them in the ark, or âclosed the door,â so to speak.\n\nThe ark was exactly six times longer than it was wide. According to the Life Application Bible study notes, this is the same ratio used by modern ship builders. â¢ In modern times researchers continue to look for evidence of Noahâs Ark.\n\nNoah was righteous and blameless, but he was not sinless (see Genesis 9:20). Noah pleased God and found favor because he loved and obeyed God with his whole heart. As a result, Noahâs life was an example to his entire generation. Although everyone around him followed the evil in their hearts, Noah followed God.\n\nhttp://christianity.about.com/od/biblestorysummaries/p/noahsarkflood.htm\n\nNoahâs Ark was huge! Genesis 6:15 in the Bible tells us the Arkâs dimensions were at least 135 meters long (300 cubits), 22.5 meters wide (50 cubits), and 13.5 meters high (30 cubits). Thatâs 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high! It could have been larger, because several larger-sized cubits were used. But the 45-centimeter (18-inch) cubit is long enough to show the enormous size of the Ark. A cubit was the length of a manâs arm from fingertips to elbow.\n\nNoahâs Ark was three stories high (Genesis 6:16). Its total deck area was equivalent to the area of about 20 standard college basketball courts or 36 lawn tennis courts. The world had to wait until AD 1884 before the Arkâs size was exceeded, when the Italian liner Eturia was built.\n\nThe rectangular dimensions of the Ark show an advanced design in ship-building. Its length of six times its width and 10 times its height would have made it amazingly stable on the ocean. Remember it was made more for floating than sailing because it wasnât headed anywhere. The Ark was made to withstand a turbulent ocean voyage, not to be at a certain place at a certain time.\n\nRecent thought on the Arkâs design is that it could have had a slightly tapered top at the front and back, instead of being squared off. But the famous rock formation near Mount Ararat with pointed ends, which some think is Noahâs Ark, is definitely not!\n\nInterestingly, British civil and mechanical engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel built a steamship (the Great Britain) in 1843 that had almost the same proportions as the Ark, although it was smaller. This was regarded as a remarkable feat of Victorian and maritime engineering. The Great Britain was the first large vessel to be propelled by a screw propeller.\n\nIn summary, Noahâs Ark was taller than a 3-story building and had a deck area the size of 36 lawn tennis courts. Its length was 300 cubits (450 feet, or 135 meters); its width was 50 cubits (75 feet, or 22.5 meters); it had three stories and its height was 30 cubits (45 feet, or 13.5 meters).\n\nhttp://www.creationtips.com/arksize.html\n\nQuestions and Answers, from: biblia.com\n\nQuestion: âHow long did it take Noah to build the ark? How long was Noah on the ark?â\n\nAnswer: The Bible does not specifically say how long it took Noah to build the ark. When Noah is first mentioned in Genesis 5:32, he was 500 years old. When Noah entered the ark, he was 600 years old. The time it took to build the ark would depend on how much time had passed between Genesis 5:32 and the time that God commanded Noah to build the ark (Genesis 6:14-21). At the absolute most, it took 100 years.\n\nQuestion: How long was Noah on the ark?\n\nAnswer: Noah entered the ark in the 600th year of his life, on the 17th day of the 2nd month (Genesis 7:11-13). Noah left the ark on the 27th day of the 2nd month of the following year (Genesis 8:14-15). Therefore, assuming a lunar calendar of 360 days, Noah was on the ark for approximately 370 days, the flood lasting for 150 days. Genesis 7:11-13 (ESV):\n\n11 In the six hundredth year of Noahâs life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened. 12 And rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 13 On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noahâs wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the arkâ¦\n\nGenesis 8:14-15 (ESV):\n\n14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out. 15 Then God said to Noahâ¦\n\nQuestion: How many of each type of animal did Noah take on the ark? Seven pairs of each kind of clean animal and two pairs of each kind of other animals were taken on the ark (Genesis 6:19-20; 7:2-3). By âcleanâ the Bible means animals that were âacceptable for sacrifice.â That is why seven pairs of the clean animals were taken â so some of them could be sacrificed after the Flood was over without endangering the species. Genesis 6:19-20 (ESV):\n\n19 And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and female. 20 Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground, according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive.\n\nGenesis 7:2-3 (ESV):\n\n2 Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals,[a] the male and his mate, and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate, 3 and seven pairs[b] of the birds of the heavens also, male and female, to keep their offspring alive on the face of all the earth.\n\nFootnotes: a. Genesis 7:2 Or seven of each kind of clean animal b. Genesis 7:3 Or seven of each kind\n\nRegarding the Bibleâs account of Noah, the Ark, and the Flood, let me point out the following liberties taken in the movie, Noah which featured Russell Crowe in the title role:\n\nQuestion: How many people were on Noahâs ark?\n\nAnswer: According to Genesis 7:13, Noah, his wife, Noahâs three sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth), and their wives were on the ark. Therefore, there were eight people on the ark.\n\n13 On the very same day Noah and his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noahâs wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,\n\nQuestion: Who was Noahâs wife?\n\nAnswer: The Bible nowhere specifically gives us the name or identity of Noahâs wife. There is a tradition that she was Naamah (Genesis 4:22). While possible, this is not explicitly taught in the Bible, Genesis 4:11 (ESV):\n\n22 Zillah also bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.\n\nhttp://biblia.com\n\nIt must have been quite a curiosity to others seeing Noah, spending decades building the ark. The dedication of Noah to the task is undeniable. Others continued to offend God and ultimately their fate was sealed by the waters of the Great Flood.\n\nNow let me make a few observations about both Godâs judgment and His covenant. Actually, there are two covenants from God; the first was the judgment by God, the penalty of death. We observe that God decides to do a reset and bring the earth back to Day two of creation as told in Genesis 1:6-8, where there are only the waters, with no land. The land came on the third day of creation.\n\nWhile the judgment may seem harsh, God did not destroy all life by the flood, but He had in the ark, a means to preserve animal life and the human race, both precious to Him. The waters cleansed the world of evil.\n\nIt is interesting that Noah sent a dove to determine whether the world was safe in Genesis 8:6-12 (ESV) we read:\n\n6At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made 7and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. 8Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. 9But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him. 10He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. 11And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. 12Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove and she did not return to him anymore.\n\nThe dove is an interesting choice. Though it is mentioned over fifty times in the scriptures, that the dove is significant in appearance and what it represents in two passages:\n\nImmediately after Jesus was baptized in water by John, we read the Holy Spirit descended upon Christ: Markâs Gospel 1:10 (ESV): 10And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.\n\nSo as Jesus was baptized and reborn with the Spirit, the earth is cleansed by water and a dove descends with an olive leaf. I would like to point out that the olive branch has been used as a universal symbol of peace and reconciliation. The city-states of ancient Greece sought to end wars between its states, replacing competition and conflict with the Olympic Games. Wars and battles were suspended for the duration of the competition. The winner of a specific event was rewarded not with the medallions of the modern Olympics, but instead a garland of olive branches woven into a crown, the Olympian being crowned as a king of that event. That crown of olive branches brings to mind the crown of thorns Christ wore, as he suffered and died to atone for our sins. In the times of Christ, the oil from olives was used to fuel the lamps of the empire. And the dove carrying the olive leaf to Noah after the flood could be viewed to symbolize the Spirit bringing life, hope, and light to the world.\n\nGod made a promise never to destroy human or animal life by flood, again.\n\nGenesis 9:8-17 (ESV)\n\n8Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, 9âBehold, I establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you, 10and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the livestock, and every beast of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark; it is for every beast of the earth. 11I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.â 12And God said, âThis is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: 13I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, 15I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.â 17God said to Noah, âThis is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.â\n\nThe rainbow is significant in several ways. Like a prism, water mist can diffract or break a beam of light into a spectrum or rainbow of component colours. But you need the presence of water vapour and sunlight, under the right conditions, invisible light becomes visible as a rainbow of colours. Not only does the rainbow symbolize Godâs covenant not to kill man or beast by flood, but the rainbow is also an example of the world of the invisible becoming visible. For many people God does not exist, he is invisible. Through faith, as with Noahâs obedience by building the ark and gathering the animals and his family, he was rewarded by being saved from the flood and given the rainbow as a symbol never to bring this judgment upon the people or beasts again.\n\nA few years ago, Sophie and I took a trip to Niagara Falls. Every time we go to the falls, I am always humbled by the beauty and splendor of Godâs natural creation. Looking at the millions of liters of water cascading over the waterfall creating the sound of thunder and clouds of mist, you cannot but marvel at the site. I remember as I was walking ahead towards the more spectacular Horseshoe Falls, I saw many in the crowd turning their backs on this natural wonder, looking across to the relatively less spectacular American Falls. Some were taking pictures. As I approached these people, I looked in the same direction and saw nothing. I could not figure out why they were taking pictures of the ordinary downstream gorge when the full power and beauty of the falls were just behind them?\n\nIt wasnât until I continued 20 or 30 meters upstream, along the walkway, towards the falls did I have a glimpse of the object of the crowdâs attention. As I walked toward the falls, the mist of the falls mingled with the sunlight to reveal a beautiful rainbow. A few meters down, away from the falls, the rainbow disappeared from view.\n\nIt was then that I reflected that this rainbow is truly like Godâs presence. For those who believe, who pray, and honour Him, we are rewarded by the rainbow of His presence. But for those unfortunate who reject Him and do not accept Him, there is no rainbow. And like those who cannot see the rainbow, because they lack faith or refuse to accept His gift of love and salvation, the unbelievers believe God does not exist. While they may look at the light, they do not see the hidden beauty of the rainbow that signifies Godâs presence. Belief in God is like seeing the beauty hidden within. Faith is rewarded through confessing our sins, reading the scriptures, praying to God, and practicing brotherly love to our neighbors, as well as helping the least of our brothers and sisters. Only then are the conditions correct to see Godâs rainbow of faith.\n\nAs followers of Christ, we are admonished by Him, to use our intelligence and integrity of faith to meet the challenges and persecution that we face in our Christian walk.\n\nMatthew 10:16 (ESV) tells us that persecution will come:\n\n16 âBehold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.â\n\nThe Holy Spirit helps us to preserve what is Godly in ourselves. We must maintain the innocence of the dove and bring the good news to others as the dove had to Noah, in spite of being persecuted for our faith.\n\nMy brother-in-law, Chuck is an avid flier, having obtained his pilotâs license before his license for a car. He spent several years building his open cockpit airplane. My sister Penny told me of the occasion on one of their trips, they passed through a deck of clouds, only to witness what is called a flierâs or pilotâs rainbow, which tradition has to indicate good fortune, as they are leaving turbulent weather. The pilotâs rainbow is distinctive in that instead of being an arch of colour, the rainbow is a perfect circle surrounding the entire aircraft. I like to think that this might be the heavenly view of the rainbow. The rainbow God sees is a perfect circle, like a wedding band, the circle is continuous, unending, and just like Godâs love for us is perfect and without end.\n\nGod made another covenant; this one is bilateral but just as perfect, as beautiful, and as unending as the rainbow. Instead of the rainbow, God gave us Jesus Christ, to fulfill His promise, which states that we shall not perish or be destroyed. As Noah had shown by building the ark, filling it with the animals, and his family, we are expected to confess our sins and follow His directions by accepting that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for our sins, this sacrifice is Godâs gift to us. If we accept the gift of Christ, the lamb, we are saved and we are given the Holy Spirit as a comforter, plus the promise that as Christ overcame death and was resurrected, we too have the promise of overcoming death and eternal life. Jesus Christ is both our ark and rainbow. He provides for us the only way to forgiveness and the promise of life eternal.\n\nIn conclusion, anytime you want to witness to others who have yet to accept the sacrifice of Christ, or at times when you find that your own faith falters, remember the Rainbow, it is always there waiting to be revealed to us, when we provide the right conditions by our reading the scriptures, praying for others and ourselves, by showing the love of Christ in all that we think, all that we say, all that we do to all whom we encounter. And remember, it took Noah nearly a century of practicing faith before he saw the fulfillment of Godâs promises. But Noahâs legacy was not only a covenant to Noah and his descendants and to us as well. The rainbow is a reminder to Noah, to us, and to God, that our God is just and faithful, and that our faith will be rewarded so long as we allow him to pilot us through lifeâs troubled waters.\n\nLet us prayâ¦\n\nClosing Hymn #225 â Standing on the Promises â with Neil & Lisa Rondina (with lyrics) â https://youtu.be/QvBlrooUszQ\n\nBenediction â (Romans 15:13):\n\nMay the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.\n\nBloor Lansdowne Christian Fellowship â BLCF Church, 1307 Bloor Street West, Toronto, ON.\n\nMessage for Sunday:\n\nGod Has a Plan 2: God Whispers to Elijah\n\nÂ© August 18, 2024, by Steve Mickelson\n\nBased on Messages shared at BLCF on May 21, 2023, October 17, 2021,\n\nMarch 3, 2019, February 28, 2016, and February 23, 2014\n\nBLCF Bulletin March 3, 2019\n\nBLCF Bulletin February 28, 2016\n\nBLCF Bulletin February 23, 2014\n\nAnnouncements and Call to Worship, Prayer,\n\nPrayer and Tithing Hymn #572: Praise God from Whom All Blessings\n\nDoxology (Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow) â Instrumental â https://youtu.be/Mk4p3rihONU\n\nWorship Special: Cochren & Co. â Church (Take Me Back) [Official Lyric Video] â https://youtu.be/3eTOcrWu8mQ\n\nWorship Special: Here I am to Worship â lyrics) â Worship Central (featuring Tim Hughes & Johanna Ma) â https://youtu.be/g5hN_m55uoM\n\nWorship Special Lauren Daigle â Rescue https://youtu.be/iItpBpdjfZA\n\nMessage by Steve Mickelson: God Has a Plan 2: God Whispers to Elijah\n\nLet us prayâ¦\n\nWelcome to Bloor Lansdowne Christian Fellowship â BLCF Churchâs Sunday Praise and Worship Service. Todayâs lesson concerns waiting on the Lord and the need for Patience or longsuffering. Though we are not the first followers of God to have waited at one time upon the Lord, you may recall that the Hebrews had to wait for generations for God to send a deliver, the prophet Moses, to bring them out of bondage in Egypt and for more generations they wandered in the desert to be led to the Promised Land. Then waiting additional generations for God to send His Son, Jesus the Messiah / Word Made Flesh. And again they waited in the Upper Room praying, before the Holy Spirit raised the Saviour from the grave. The next period of waiting seemed to last a relatively short time on the earth before the Lordâs Ascension to be with the Father in Heaven. As Jesus departed, he instructed the disciples to wait and pray for a period of time until the Day of Pentecost when the Lord sent the Holy Spirit to the believers in the Upper Room and later to all who confessed their sins and accepted Jesus as their Lord and Saviour.\n\nThatâs a lot of waiting for a result that was prayed for, in some cases for hundreds of years and scores of generations. So when you look at how long the saints in the Bible trusted and waited on the Lord, the prospect of waiting a few years for the COVID-19 Pandemic to subside before we could fully reopen the church may seem, by comparison, almost trivial. But, from my perspective, what we had endured between March 16, 2020, and October 17, 2021, over some 19 months, as well as later between Boxing Day and Palm Sunday 2022, has been a challenge to Christian believers, who are admonished both in the Scriptures and by fellow believers to gather together to worship God in His Sanctuary to celebrate His Sonâs sacrifice through the observance of Communion, to show our love and support to one another by a handshake, an embrace, or a Holy kiss of affection has been nothing more than a test of patience and trust in the Lord, and go forth and share the Lordâs Gospel unto ends of the earth.\n\nHowever, the Pandemic has caused believers to put social gatherings as a body of believers on hold. For the protection of those we love and ourselves, we have had to isolate ourselves at home, don masks, wash our hands, keep a social distance apart, and avoid indoor gatherings. This has been a test of the strength of our love for our fellow brothers and sisters, by our willingness to sacrifice. by submitting to these safe practices needed to preserve the health and lives of others who are vulnerable to infection by the COVID-19 virus.\n\nEven with vaccination, we continue with precautions to protect those who we love and care for, which for Christian believers means everyone. We prepared for todayâs service by sanitizing the pulpit and pews, erecting plexiglass barriers, screening all worshippers, not distributing Bulletins, Bibles, or Hymnals, suspending choruses and songs during the service, setting up the social distance between worshipers, canceling coffee hour after the service, and providing communion in a pre-packaged sealed cup that contains both the bread and juice. These rules and restrictions apply whether we are vaccinated or not, and I believe it sure beats sitting at home and perhaps watching a stream or broadcast of a service from a remote location or previously recorded at some church! There is something about hearing Scriptures, prayers, and praise in person that restores our faith, renews our spirit, and heals the soul. Sadly, some believe that the church will never reopen, having fallen victim to the Pandemic. They cower at home or seem to have lost their hope in faith in celebrating Godâs gifts and blessings as a fellowship of believers, all members of the body of His Church. Not unlike Elijah, the subject of todayâs lesson, who hid in seclusion from God in the isolation of a remote cave.\n\nTo those who believe that Godâs Church is no more having fallen victim to the enemy of the COVID-19 virus, I say it is time to celebrate your reunion with the church body here at BLCF and see that your fears are unfounded. Perhaps it is your faith that has fallen victim to another enemy who wants you separated from your brothers and sisters in the Lord! But do not be discouraged by this fear that all is lost to an enemy, for such fear is not new to believers, as it has happened before, even to great leaders, including the prophet Elijah, who we see is the subject of todayâs lesson, God Has a Plan 2: God Whispers to Elijah.\n\nYou may notice that we are smaller in number today than our usual small size. In time, this too should improve. During the Pandemic some of our members cannot attend because they have committed to visiting loved ones in nursing homes, while others have been called away by work, health issues, and other reasons. Some have felt safe being at home for so long, that going out to church or elsewhere is a scary proposition, even though Public Health assures us that it is safe if the recommended precautions are taken. So let us begin with todayâs lesson with a faith challenge that I had experienced in my life.\n\nWhen I was 6 years of age, I found that it was good to have parents of strength around me on those occasions when fear overcame the joys of childhood innocence. I recall well when my younger sister Rhona suffered a traumatic spinal injury at the age of 3 years and was not expected to survive the night. Because of her dismal prognosis, Dad was allowed to bring me to my sisterâs hospital room, for what was possibly a final visit. Though Dad did not mention how critical her condition was, seeing a Rhona connected to tubes and monitors was a frightening specter, which she must have sensed, as upon seeing me, she told me to âGo Awayâ.\n\nOur family prayed to God and Rhona pulled through, though, for the next 39 years of her life, she would face a lifetime of many life-or-death surgeries and health challenges. At those times, we often prayed to God with the hope that he would give the family, especially Rhona, the courage to face these challenges.\n\nThrough those years, Rhona went on to create Star Tracks Talent Agency, a non-profit agency specializing in representing both disabled and elderly clients in mainstream movies, commercials, and live performances, Rhonaâs work was recognized with many awards, including the Governor Generalâs Award, the King Clancy Award. It seems that God had a plan for Rhona.\n\nRHONA MICKELSON (From Hansard Transcripts â Legislative Assembly of Ontario) 36th Parliament, 1st session, October 29, 1996:\n\nhttps://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/house-documents/parliament-36/session-1/1996-10-29/hansard#P28_4668\n\nNow back to todayâs lesson about Elijah, taken from 1 Kings 19.\n\nSome of you may recall reading the account in 1 Kings 18, where the prophet Elijah, a devout servant of God, was concerned about the waning faith of the people of Israel towards the one true God where some had begun to worship the pagan god Baal.\n\nThis was where Elijah had proposed a challenge to the 450 priests of Baal, where both he and the priests would set up sacrificial altars to their respective gods, asking him to light the altar. Elijah gave the priests of Baal a handicap by ordering a dozen urns of water to be poured on the altar he had built. The priests of Baal were unsuccessful, while Elijah prayed to God, acknowledging His authority and asking God to start the altar fires to help restore and renew the faith of His chosen people. God responded with a fire so fierce that it not only burned the wood and water but destroyed the very rocks upon which the altar sat. After the victory, Elijah had all of the priests of Baal put to death.\n\nYou would think, after this decided victory, Elijah would use the victory as an opportunity to promote God to those who may still harbor any doubts about Who was the real God, and who wasnât. Instead, Elijah fled upon learning that Jezebel had sought to give Elijah the same fate that was given to the priests of Baal. As we see in 1 Kings 19:\n\n1 Kings 19 (ESV): Elijah Flees Jezebel\n\n19 Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, âSo may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.â 3 Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.\n\nElijah was so overcome with fear and self-loathing because he felt that by not convincing Jezebel of the one true God, he had failed Him. Continuing with 1 Kings 19:\n\n4 But he himself went a dayâs journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, âIt is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.â 5 And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, âArise and eat.â 6 And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. 7 And the angel of the Lord came again a second time and touched him and said, âArise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.â 8 And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.\n\nGod had seen the faith of his servant Elijah, and in this case, denied Elijahâs request to be put to death. We see that God twice sent angels to attend to Elijah by giving him food and water. The first meal was to restore Elijahâs strength, while the second was to fortify Elijah for a forty-day journey to Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, the sacred place of God. God had planned to not only converse with Elijah but to give His prophet a lesson in what matters most in restoring faith to those who have strayed from God. Let us continue in 1 Kings 19, beginning in verse 9:\n\nThe Lord Speaks to Elijah\n\n9 There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said to him, âWhat are you doing here, Elijah?â 10 He said, âI have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.â 11 And he said, âGo out and stand on the mount before the Lord.â And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. 12 And after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper.[a] 13 And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.\n\nFootnotes: a. 1 Kings 19:12 Or a sound, a thin silence\n\nI would like to point out that this passage began with 1 Kings 19, verse 9, where the Word of the Lord came to Elijah. Who exactly is the Word of the Lord? The answer to this question is found in Johnâs Gospel, specifically John 1:14 (ESV):\n\n14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\nJust as we saw in last weekâs lesson, which describes Saul of Tarsusâ conversion to Paul, an Apostle of the Lord after Jesus, the Word made Flesh, called Saul out on the Road to Damascus, the Word has another conversation, this time with His servant, Elijah.\n\nWe see that the Lord asks Elijah, âWhat are you doing here?â In other words, why have you fled to the wilderness? Elijah confesses that following Godâs demonstration where He had started the sacrificial fire on the altar made in His honor, the people of Israel had destroyed Godâs altar and killed all His prophets, save for Elijah And because he had failed to convince the people to keep their covenant with God, Elijah had failed God. To Elijah, it seems that the glass is not just half empty, but totally so.\n\nGodâs answer to Elijah, is quite interesting. The Lord instructs Elijah to go out of the cave and to stand on the mount before the Lord. Perhaps, Elijah expected God to cast him off the mount, as punishment for his perceived failure. It is also interesting to note, that God does not speak to Elijah in a voice that is great and thunderous as one might imagine. Thanks to the likes of Cecil B. Deville, we have God speaking to Moses in a mighty, booming voice and coming from a pillar of fire. There is no reason to believe that God spoke any differently to Moses than the way He conversed with Elijah, in a quiet whisper, like a Father to a beloved child.\n\nWe see that as the Lord passes by, three great natural events occur: first strong wind, then an earthquake, and finally a fire. In each of these events, God was not present. Then Elijah hears God speaking in a low whisper, which prompts Elijah to cover his face, as he recognizes Godâs presence. We see that, though extreme natural events such as earth-shattering winds, earthquakes, and fire or even four blood moons and eclipses of the sun may occur after God passes, they do not indicate the presence of God. Only when we hear God speak, even though in a whisper, can we know for certain that God is present. Otherwise, we may mistakenly believe any and all such extreme events are a sign from God. God is quite clear and explicit that He communicates to us by his word, not through natural events or disasters. God was not in the wind.\n\nThe destruction of the altars set by the priests of Baal, by wind, earthquake, and fire are just as meaningless signs of the Divine presence unless God whispers. And what did God whisper? Continuing at 1 Kings 19, verse 13:\n\nAnd behold, there came a voice to him and said, âWhat are you doing here, Elijah?â 14 He said, âI have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away.â 15 And the Lord said to him, âGo, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. 16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place. 17 And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death. 18 Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.â\n\nFirst, Elijah gives the same refrain as an answer that we read beginning back in verse 9. This time God instructs Elijah to do what is likely what he should have done after the altar was lit instead of fleeing into the wilderness, which was: to anoint Hazael as king of Syria, anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king of Israel, and to anoint Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah in place of himself. In other words, God tells Elijah to appoint new rulers and names Elisha to be His new prophet. God not only names a successor but informs Elijah that seven thousand people of Israel have not broken their covenant with God. So the glass is not as empty as Elijah had thought.\n\nElijah then departs to do as the Lord commanded, 1Kings 19, verse 19:\n\nThe Call of Elisha\n\n19 So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast his cloak upon him. 20 And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, âLet me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.â And he said to him, âGo back again, for what have I done to you?â 21 And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and assisted him.\n\nJust as God had provided food to restore Elijah, before whispering to and restoring his prophet, Elisha celebrates his calling, first by honoring and showing affection to his parents; then by making a sacrifice of the twelve oxen, which he shares as a feast with the people; and finally, Elisha leaves to follow Elijah.\n\nGod had not only restored Elijahâs confidence and faith, but He raised Elijah to a more prominent place than before. And God had anointed those who kept His covenant. When we are afraid, God is our refuge and shelter, as we read in Psalm 91:\n\nPsalm 91 (ESV): My Refuge and My Fortress\n\n91 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High\n\nwill abide in the shadow of the Almighty.\n\n2 I will say[a] to the Lord, âMy refuge and my fortress,\n\nmy God, in whom I trust.â\n\n3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler\n\nand from the deadly pestilence.\n\n4 He will cover you with his pinions,\n\nand under his wings you will find refuge;\n\nhis faithfulness is a shield and buckler.\n\n5 You will not fear the terror of the night,\n\nnor the arrow that flies by day,\n\n6 nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness,\n\nnor the destruction that wastes at noonday.\n\nThe last three verses from Psalm 91 indicate that God not only provides refuge and protection to the faithful but abides by the faithful, giving honor and reward of salvation. Psalm 91, verse 14:\n\n14 âBecause he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him;\n\nI will protect him, because he knows my name.\n\n15 When he calls to me, I will answer him;\n\nI will be with him in trouble;\n\nI will rescue him and honor him.\n\n16 With long life I will satisfy him\n\nand show him my salvation.â\n\nFootnotes: a. Psalm 91:2 Septuagint He will say\n\nWhat is faith and how does God value it? Hebrews 11:\n\nHebrews 11 (ESV): By Faith\n\n11 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2 For by it the people of old received their commendation. 3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.\n\n4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks. 5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. 6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. 7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.\n\n8 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9 By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. 10 For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God. 11 By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised. 12 Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.\n\n13 These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14 For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 15 If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.\n\n17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, 18 of whom it was said, âThrough Isaac shall your offspring be named.â 19 He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. 20 By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. 21 By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. 22 By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.\n\n23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the kingâs edict. 24 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaohâs daughter, 25 choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. 26 He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. 27 By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. 28 By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.\n\n29 By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned. 30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31 By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.\n\n32 And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophetsâ 33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 35 Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life. 36 Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. 37 They were stoned, they were sawn in two,[a] they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreatedâ 38 of whom the world was not worthyâwandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\n\n39 And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40 since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.\n\nFootnotes: a. Hebrews 11:37 Some manuscripts add they were tempted\n\nWe see God has acknowledged and commended the faith of His prophets, though many suffered dearly, some even paying with their lives. In verse 38 we read:\n\nThey went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreatedâ 38 of whom the world was not worthyâwandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\n\nI can think of one such prophet who was destitute, afflicted, mistreated; who wandered in the deserts and mountain wilderness, in dens and caves of the earth. Sound familiar?\n\nA few years back, the Christian singing group, The Newsboys, gave a great lyrical expression of how the voice of Godâs Holy Spirit whispers to us, in their song Something Beautiful, which begins with the lyrics:\n\nI wanna start it over\n\nI wanna start again\n\nI want a new beginning\n\nOne without an end\n\nI feel it inside\n\nCalling out to me\n\nItâs a voice that whispers my name\n\nAnd Godâs love is the underlying emotion expressed in His whisper:\n\nIâve heard it in the silence\n\nSeen it on a face\n\nIâve felt it in a long hour\n\nLike a sweet embrace\n\nI know this is true\n\nItâs calling out to me\n\nItâs a voice that whispers my name\n\nSong by Â© the Newsboys: Something Beautiful: https://youtu.be/EGes0O84VbA\n\nBut God provided something better for us, than just His commendation. We received, through Christ Jesus, salvation, forgiveness, and a new covenant. Through Jesus, sacrifice, we are lifted up and restored to God, not in a cave or upon a remote mount, but everywhere we walk. For as believers in Christ, we walk with the gift of Godâs eternal presence through his Holy Spirit:\n\nDeuteronomy 33:27a (ESV):\n\n27 The eternal God is your dwelling place,[a] and underneath are the everlasting arms.[b]\n\nFootnotes: a. 1 Kings 19:12 Or a sound, a thin silence b.

Deuteronomy 33:27 Revocalization of verse 27 yields He subdues the ancient gods, and shatters the forces of old\n\nKnow His presence, when you hear His voice whisper your name through His Holy Spirit.\n\nRemember, all believers can take heart and comfort expressed in Psalm 27, verse 1, which begins with the assurance that:\n\n27 The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?\n\nThe Lord is the stronghold[a] of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?\n\nPsalm 27, verse 14, closes by urging us to not lose our faith, but to:\n\n14 Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord!\n\nFootnotes: a.

We would ask for the Lordâs Blessings for those reading our lesson online today.\n\nTodayâs lesson is entitled God Has a Plan 1: Ananias â A Disciple at Damascus. It involves the lone disciple of the Lord who was called upon by Jesus to heal and baptize Saul of Tarsus, so that he may serve as an instrument of Christ, baptized as Paul.\n\nWhile the Scriptures contain accounts of three individuals bearing the name Ananias:\n\nThree different people in the New Testament are named Ananias\n\n(from enterthebible.org):\n\nOne Ananias was a member of the church in Jerusalem in the days when the believers had all things in common. Along with his wife, Sapphira, he sold a piece of property, secretly kept some of the money, and misreported the sale price when he gave the rest of the money to the church. When Peter confronted him, Ananias fell down and died (Acts 4:32-5:11).\n\nAnother Ananias was a follower of Jesus in Damascus. Instructed by a vision, he sought out Paul (then still known as Saul) and helped to restore his sight (Acts 9:10-19).\n\nA third Ananias was the high priest in Jerusalem who convened a meeting of the Jewish ruling council to examine Paul after his arrest in the temple (Acts 23:1-5).\n\nhttps://www.enterthebible.org/resourcelink.aspx?rid=1177\n\nOur lesson will focus on the second of the three accounts of an individual named Ananias, the disciple of Jesus who lived in Damascus and was involved in the restoration of the vision to Saul of Tarsus.\n\nWe do know a little more about Ananiasâ involvement with the conversion of Saul of Tarsus:\n\nAnanias â (bible study tools.com)\n\nIn late tradition, he is placed in the list of the seventy disciples of Jesus, and represented as Bishop of Damascus, and as having died a martyrâs death.\n\nhttp://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/ananias/\n\nThe first account that involved the Bishop of Damascus is found in Acts 9:1-22 (ESV) and is told in the third person:\n\nThe Conversion of Saul\n\n9 But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.3 Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.4 And falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, âSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?â5 And he said, âWho are you, Lord?â And he said, âI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.6 But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.â7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.8 Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.9 And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.\n\n10 Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, âAnanias. âAnd he said, âHere I am, Lord.â11 And the Lord said to him, âRise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.â13 But Ananias answered, âLord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem.14 And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.â15 But the Lord said to him, âGo, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.16 For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.â17 So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, âBrother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.â18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized;19 and taking food, he was strengthened.\n\nSaul Proclaims Jesus in Synagogues\n\nFor some days he was with the disciples at Damascus.20 And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, âHe is the Son of God.â21 And all who heard him were amazed and said, âIs not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?â22 But Saul increased all the more in strength and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.\n\nThe passage from Acts 9:1-22 contains two narratives of two protagonists, Saul of Tarsus and Ananias of Damascus, who receive visions from Jesus. Our Lord has ascended to be with the Father in heaven, sending Godâs Holy Spirit to all believers in the Resurrected Christ.\n\nThis conversion, healing, and baptism of Saul resulted in a zealous persecutor of Christians becoming one of the greatest evangelists of the Gospel of Christ.\n\nWe see as a result of the two visions from the Lord, a sinner is struck blind, left helpless, weak from three days of hunger and thirst, in need of being healed and nourished by a believer who must overcome a reluctance to deal with a notoriously evil persecutor of believers in the Way of Christ.\n\nThe second account that included the disciple Ananias is found in Acts 22:1-16 (ESV):\n\n22 âBrothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you.â\n\n2 And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language,[a] they became even more quiet. And he said:\n\n3 âI am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel[b] according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day. 4 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, 5 as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them, I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.\n\n6 âAs I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me. 7 And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, âSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?â 8 And I answered, âWho are you, Lord?â And he said to me, âI am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.â 9 Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand[c] the voice of the one who was speaking to me. 10 And I said, âWhat shall I do, Lord?â And the Lord said to me, âRise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.â 11 And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.\n\n12 âAnd one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, 13 came to me, and standing by me said to me, âBrother Saul, receive your sight.â And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him. 14 And he said, âThe God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth; 15 for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard. 16 And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.â\n\nFootnotes: a. Acts 22:2 Or the Hebrew dialect (probably Aramaic) b. Acts 22:3 Or city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated c. Acts 22:9 Or hear with understanding\n\nFrom the two accounts of Ananiasâ healing and baptism of Saul of Tarsus, we see that the Lord sent his good and faithful disciple to minister to Saul by restoring his sight and baptizing him in Spirit, by calling on the name of the Lord.\n\nIn ministering to Saul of Tarsus, Ananias was instructed to visit, heal, and baptize a stranger who was imprisoned by his blindness; weak, hungry, and thirsty from fasting for three days. The sin of Saul would be washed away after he followed Ananiasâ instructions to call on the name of Jesus. By his conversion to the Way of Jesus, Saul of Tarsus would later be known as the Apostle Paul, one of the greatest proponents of the Christian faith to both Jews and Gentiles, alike.\n\nThe ministering of Ananias of Damascus to Saul of Tarsus sounds very familiar, as it is described in the Scripture passage which we have adopted as a Mission statement for our BLCF CafÃ© Community Dinner, Matthew 25:31-46 (ESV):\n\nThe Final Judgment\n\n31 âWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. 34 Then the King will say to those on his right, âCome, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 36 I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.â37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, âLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 38 And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?39 And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?â 40 And the King will answer them, âTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you did it to me.â\n\n41 âThen he will say to those on his left, âDepart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.â 44 Then they also will answer, saying, âLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?â 45 Then he will answer them, saying, âTruly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.â 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.â\n\nWhile the world may view ministering to the least of our brothers and sisters as strictly taking care of their physical needs, if we were to substitute the name of âSaul of Tarsusâ in place of âleast of my brother and sistersâ or replace âthe least of theseâ, in the above Matthew 25 passage, we have a description of how Ananias ministered to the spiritual needs of a brother in need, who was blinded, starving, and condemned to the death sentence of his sins. The first example would read:\n\n40 And the King will answer them, âTruly, I say to you, as you did it to Saul of Tarsus, you did it to me.â\n\nThe second example would read:\n\nâTruly, I say to you,\n\nas you did not do it to Saul of Tarsus,\n\nyou did not do it to me.â\n\nIn other words, on that Final Judgement Day, our salvation and eternal life depend upon how well we âministeredâ to sinners the gospel of Christ, feeding them with the Good News of the Lord and sharing as living witnesses our testimony of faith.\n\nLet us prayâ¦\n\nMusic Special â In Christ Alone cover by Lauren Daigle with Lyrics â https://youtu.be/7WS1JupSHKo\n\nClosing Music Special: In Jesusâ Name (God of Possible) â Katy Nichole â Lyric Video â https://youtu.be/R84PqRdZ7_Y\n\nBenediction â (John 13:35): By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\n\nBloor Lansdowne Christian Fellowship â BLCF Church Message for Sunday:\n\nThe Love of Jesus as Expressed in a Parable, a Lesson, and a Judgment\n\nÂ© August 4, 2024, by Steve Mickelson\n\nBased on Messages Shared at BLCF on February 5, 2023, March 7, 2021, and February 9, 2020\n\nBLCF Bulletin February 9, 2020\n\nAnnouncements and Call to Worship; Prayer\n\nPrayer and Tithing Hymn #572: Praise God from Whom All Blessings\n\nDoxology (Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow) â Instrumental â https://youtu.be/Mk4p3rihONU\n\nMusic Special â Thereâs a Quiet Understanding â (Lyrics) â Christian Music Artists â https://youtu.be/BJTj8CGjJbg\n\nMusic Special: Beatitudes â Hillsong United â (cover by Wade Cambern with Lyrics) â https://youtu.be/oFGYzpqUD7E\n\nResponsive Reading #671: Godâs Love and Ours (1 John 4)\n\nMessage by Steve Mickelson:\n\nThe Love of Jesus as Expressed in a Parable, a Lesson, and a Judgment\n\nLet us prayâ¦\n\nGood morning and welcome to BLCF Churchâs Sunday Praise and Worship Service for the first Sunday of August 2024, which also happens to be a Communion Sunday. After having a good vacation in July, Sophie and I are happy to be back in the Heart of Toronto!\n\nTodayâs lesson, entitled The Love of Jesus as Expressed in a Parable, a Lesson, and a Judgment, we will examine three expressions of our Lordâs love, from a parable, a lesson, and events on Judgment Day.\n\nJesus answered the question, âHow does one inherit eternal lifeâ, with the aid of a parable, as described in Luke 10:25-37 (ESV):\n\nThe Parable of the Good Samaritan\n\n25 And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, âTeacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?â 26 He said to him, âWhat is written in the Law? How do you read it?â 27 And he answered, âYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.â 28 And he said to him, âYou have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.â\n\n29 But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, âAnd who is my neighbor?â 30 Jesus replied, âA man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. 31 Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. 32 So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. 34 He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 And the next day he took out two denarii[a] and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, âTake care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.â 36 Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?â 37 He said, âThe one who showed him mercy.â And Jesus said to him, âYou go, and do likewise.â\n\nFootnotes: a. Luke 10:35 A denarius was a dayâs wage for a labor\n\nIn this passage, a lawyer knowledgeable in the legalities of the Scriptures sought to test Jesus by asking him what he needs to do to inherit eternal life, to which the Lord replied what is his understanding of this matter from Godâs Word. The lawyer responded by stating the requirement of unconditional love for God and to love our neighbor as ourselves, which is a distillation of Godâs Ten Words or Commandments given to Moses to be delivered to the People of Israel, dealing with how God expects his people to relate to Him and to others.\n\nA definition of the 10 Commandments comes from the online Encyclopedia Britannica:\n\nTen Commandments, also called Decalogue (Greek:deka logoi [â10 wordsâ]), list of religious precepts that, according to various passages in Exodus and Deuteronomy, were divinely revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai and were engraved on two tablets of stone. The Commandments are recorded virtually identically in Exodus 20: 2â17 and Deuteronomy 5: 6â21. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ten-Commandments\n\nWhen the lawyer asked Jesus to explain,â Who would he consider to be a neighbor?â Jesus answered the lawyerâs question by telling him a Parable about an act of kindness given to a beaten traveler by a Samaritan passing by. Jesus described how both a priest and Levite, also passing by the beaten man, refused to stop and help the beaten man. Jesus asked the lawyer, which of the three passers-by proved to be a neighbor to the man who was beaten and robbed, to which the lawyer replied, the Samaritan. Ironically, the Jews were too busy traveling to stop and give assistance to the traveler.\n\nAnd when ministering to others, Jesus emphasized humility, as we see in his lesson taught washing his disciplesâ feet, as described in John 13:1-17 (ESV):\n\nJesus Washes The Disciplesâ Feet\n\n13 Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. 2 During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simonâs son, to betray him, 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, 4 rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. 5 Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciplesâ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. 6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, âLord, do you wash my feet?â 7 Jesus answered him, âWhat I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.â 8 Peter said to him, âYou shall never wash my feet.â Jesus answered him, âIf I do not wash you, you have no share with me.â 9 Simon Peter said to him, âLord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!â 10 Jesus said to him, âThe one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet,[a] but is completely clean. And you[b] are clean, but not every one of you.â 11 For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, âNot all of you are clean.â\n\n12 When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, âDo you understand what I have done to you? 13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. 14 If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one anotherâs feet. 15 For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. 16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant[c] is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.\n\nFootnotes: a.John 13:10 Some manuscripts omit except for his feet b. John 13:10 The Greek words for you in this verse are plural c. John 13:16 Or bondservant, or slave (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word doulos, see Preface)\n\nIn this passage, Jesus indicated that we should remember his lesson of washing his disciplesâ feet and performing the act of a humble servant. This lesson emphasized a construct that happens to be inverted from how many prioritize their relationships with God and others.\n\nWe often behave in a way where we place our needs first, next giving to help our neighbors, and lastly showing honour to God. Perhaps this is the reason why so many have yet to return to worship in church since the Pandemic? COVID has caused them to place their priorities upside-down, and the result is the absence in Society of the social graces of love and compassion towards others, showing the need to renew our faith, and our spirit, and once again find the Lordâs grace through a renewal as of body of believers in spirit as members of His church.\n\nThis is the opposite of how Jesus taught in his foot-washing exercise, where he sought to have us place ourselves subservient to others, which is submissive to Godâs will.\n\nJesusâ lesson has God at the top of our priority list, with our neighbors next, and ourselves last.\n\nJust how important the relationships between ourselves to God and our neighbours are concerning how we will be judged by the Lord on Judgment Day is described as the parable of the shepherd sorting out his flock of sheep from the goats described in our final Scripture passage in our lesson today, found in Matthew 25:31-46 (ESV):\n\nThe Final Judgment\n\n31 âWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. 34 Then the King will say to those on his right, âCome, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 36 I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.â 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, âLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 38 And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? 39 And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?â 40 And the King will answer them, âTruly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters, you did it to me.â\n\n41 âThen he will say to those on his left, âDepart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.â 44 Then they also will answer, saying, âLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?â 45 Then he will answer them, saying, âTruly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.â 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.â\n\nIt is obvious how we demonstrate our love and compassion to the least of our brothers and sisters will reveal how we honour our Lord, and how in turn we will be judged and inherit eternal life, on the Day of Judgment.\n\nCommunion Special â Lauren Daigle â âWe Will Not Forgetâ (Lyric Video) â https://youtu.be/izeZa9wx8wA\n\nMark 14:22-25 ESV: Institution of the Lordâs Supper\n\n22 And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing, it broke it and gave it to them, and said, âTake; this is my body.â 23 And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. 24 And he said to them, âThis is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many. 25 Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.â\n\nLet us prayâ¦\n\nClosing Music Special: In Jesusâ Name (God of Possible) â Katy Nichole â Lyric Video â https://youtu.be/R84PqRdZ7_Y\n\nBenediction â (Romans 8:38-39):\n\nFor I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nMusic Special â The Power of the Cross (Official Lyric Video) â Keith & Kristyn Getty â https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wcULqyoINg\n\nBloor Lansdowne Christian Fellowship â BLCF Church Message for Sunday:\n\nThe Cross: A Symbol of Our Faith and Reminder of Godâs Love\n\nÂ© June 30, 2024, by Steve Mickelson\n\nBased on Messages shared at BLCF on March 20, 2022, January 14, 2018, and October 26, 2014\n\nBLCF Bulletin January 14, 2018\n\nBLCF: Bulletin October 26, 2014\n\nAnnouncements and Call to Worship; Prayer\n\nPrayer and Tithing Hymn #572: Praise God from Whom All Blessings\n\nResponsive Reading #632 (Godâs Redeeming Lover â John 3 and 1 John 4);\n\nMessage by Steve Mickelson: The Cross: A Symbol of Our Faith and Reminder of Godâs Love\n\nMusic Special: Pass It On â TheNCrew â https://youtu.be/ovdKx6lQ8OM\n\nLet us prayâ¦\n\nWelcome to our Sunday Praise and Worship service today at Bloor Lansdowne Christian Fellowship, on this the last Sunday of June 2024.\n\nIt was just over four years ago, on March 16, 2020, that Bloor Lansdowne Christian Fellowship closed its doors and suspended all in-person Church Service Meetings, as well as all outreach activities, including the BLCF Cafe Community Dinner, due to the deadly threat to the vulnerable from the COVID-19 Virus which had spread to a Pandemic.\n\nWe finally reopened our doors in October 2021, to Sunday Worship Services, under the guidelines of Public Health of wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc.\n\nServices at BLCF continued until Boxing Day, 2021, when BLCF again suspended in-person worship activities due to the BA.2 Omicron subvariant of COVID-19, from December 2021 until Palm Sunday 2022 when BLCF reopened its doors.\n\nThe two tenant congregations who also use our church building have had to deal with the threat of COVID-19 while keeping their own health and safety policies. Ultimately, the Agape Congregation left us as they had lost the majority of their members who decided to go back to Brazil during the Pandemic. If you happen to know of a congregation looking to share church facilities with two other congregations here at BLCF. Tell them to give BLCF a call if interested. The current vacancy would be for Sunday evenings and a day or so during the week.\n\nBLCF continues to maintain contact with fellow members of the BLCF Community who have yet to return to church by way of phone and via social media until those who have yet return to BLCF are able to do so. We encourage you to continue to pray for each other and contact each other with words of encouragement and hope, until the day when we are reunited not only at BLCF and at other churches experiencing a similar post-Pandemic drop in attendance.\n\nLet us now begin our lesson for today, which is entitled: The Cross: A Symbol of Our Faith and Reminder of Godâs Love.\n\nBefore we delve into the lesson, I would like to share our own miracle of the cross here at BLCF.\n\nIt was at a BLCF picnic in the back of the church at St. Helens several years ago, that the congregation decided to invite the Bloor Lansdowne Community to a simple barbeque/picnic, featuring hot dogs and corn on the cob.\n\nSince we had a small Hibachi grill, it was decided to cook the hot dogs outside and boil the corn inside the church kitchen. I was running the barbeque in the front driveway so as to catch the attention of passersby with a sign posted as an invitation to join the picnic posted above my station.\n\nAs I cooked the hot dogs, a group of four or five young people passed by, where one having read our sign commented: âWhat kind of place is this?â To which another replied: âI think it is a church.â\n\nWhen I heard their comments, I realized that the church signage consisted of a front marquee sign and another on the east wall, outside of the prayer room, both mounted high above eye level, making the signs all but invisible to pedestrians walking on the sidewalk in front of the building. The church had a small cross, composed of white bricks embedded in the red brick wall located high above the front facade of the church. No wonder many people were unaware that we were a church. The lights inside the marquee sign had stopped working several years before.\n\nLater, intrigued about the cross, I went to the roof and found an old five-foot cross made of plywood with faded white paint sitting on the roof. It looked as if the weather and wind had caused the cross to fall some years before, with the lag bolts pulling free from the peak of the front wall.\n\nHere is where our little miracle occurredâ¦\n\nAs I pondered whether the cross might be repaired, restored, and mounted back on the roof, we received an interesting message from the daughter of one of the members of our congregation, who had passed away two years before. It seemed that a nearby church had closed and the property sold for commercial use. The new owners intended to convert the building to lofts. Part of the conversion included the removal of the large twelve-foot silver cross mounted on the front of the building.\n\nIt seems that the young lady noticed the cross was placed in a scrap bin. She convinced the contractor to give her the cross, indicating that she knew of a church that needed a cross. When she contacted me, she asked: âCould use a new cross?â\n\nMy reply was an emphatic âYes, though I was not sure how to arrange delivery of a twelve-foot cross, let alone how we would mount it on the building. I did not tell her that the church at the time had funds for either.\n\nI was informed that in memory of her mother, she wanted to hire a contractor to deliver and mount the cross, all at her own expense. She also asked us not to reveal her name.\n\nWhen I received the dimensions of the donated cross, I proceeded to establish the space available on the wall based on an examination of recent photos of the building and counting the layers and columns of bricks and concluded that it would fit perfectly above the front doors, between the double arches that framed the front doorway.\n\nThe contractors asked whether we wanted the small white cross formed by white bricks embedded in the wall to be painted red so that the new cross would be the only cross above the front entrance. I told them to leave the cross untouched and asked that the small white window arch behind the new cross be painted red to match the rest of the brickwork of the front wall.\n\nThe new cross was mounted above the entrance to Bloor Lansdowne Christian Fellowship â BLCF Church and dedicated at the Good Friday 2012 Worship Service by Pastors Bob Buckley and Andrew Mugford\n\nI marvel at how the Lord provides a solution to the need to replace the old cross before it had even been raised the need to Him. And, as is often the case, the solution that the Lord provided was far better than what we had imagined. Praise the Lord! The Lord ensured that the people in the community knew without a doubt that BLCF was and is His house of worship. The Lord recognized the need for a new cross and provided both the cross, as well as the means to install it well before we had a chance to pray for it.\n\nI wonder how many times God provides for His children before the need is raised? And how many times does the Lord provide for a need before it is even recognized? This was not the first time God has provided in a miraculous way for the need at BLCF.\n\nBy the way, I did manage to repair, stain, and mount the old BLCF cross and mount it on the wall behind the risers where Terry Sywanyk performs at our BLCF Cafe Community Dinner beside the âkNOw JESUS kNOw PEACEâ sign.\n\nIt may surprise you to find out that the cross has not always been a symbol of the Christian Church. Let us check our Wikibits for the history of the cross:\n\nThe Christian Cross\n\n(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)\n\nA Latin cross\n\nThe Christian Cross, seen as a representation of the instrument of the crucifixion of Jesus, is the best-known symbol of Christianity. It is related to the crucifix (a cross that includes a usually three-dimensional representation of Jesusâ body) and to the more general family of cross symbols.\n\nIn contemporary Christianity, the cross is a symbol of the atonement and reminds Christians of Godâs love in sacrificing his own son for humanity. It represents Jesusâ victory over sin and death, since it is believed that through his death and resurrection he conquered death itself.\n\nSee Colossians 2:15, âHaving disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the crossâ.\n\nThe cross is often shown in different shapes and sizes, in many different styles. It may be used in personal jewelry, or used on top of church buildings. It is shown both empty and in crucifix form, that is, with a figure of Christ, often referred to as the corpus (Latin for âbodyâ), affixed to it. Roman Catholic, Anglican and Lutheran depictions of the cross are often crucifixes, in order to emphasize that it is Jesus that is important, rather than the cross in isolation. Large crucifixes are a prominent feature of some Lutheran churches, as illustrated in the article Rood. However, some other Protestant traditions depict the cross without the corpus, interpreting this form as an indication of belief in the resurrection rather than as representing the interval between the death and the resurrection of Jesus.\n\nCrosses are a prominent feature of Christian cemeteries, either carved on gravestones or as sculpted stelas. Because of this, planting small crosses is sometimes used in countries of Christian culture to mark the site of fatal accidents, or to protest alleged deaths.\n\nIn Catholic countries, crosses are often erected on the peaks of prominent mountains, such as the Zugspitze or Mount Royal, so as to be visible over the entire surrounding area.\n\nPatriarchal cross\n\nAlso called an archiepiscopal cross or a crux gemina. A double cross, with the two crossbars near the top. The upper one is shorter, representing the plaque nailed to Jesusâ cross. Similar to the Cross of Lorraine, though in the original version of the latter, the bottom arm is lower. The Eastern Orthodox cross adds a slanted bar near the foot.\n\nCross (disambiguation)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe Cross consists of two lines or bars, intersecting each other at a 90Â° angle and dividing one or both of the lines in half.\n\nCross or to cross may also refer to:\n\nReligion\n\nChristian cross, the basic symbol of Christianity\n\nAs a simple ritual or prayer, it is the Sign of the Cross\n\nCross necklace, a necklace worn by adherents of the Christian religion\n\nObject\n\nCross (crown), the decoration located at the highest level of a crown\n\nA cross with a human body affixed is referred to as a crucifix\n\ncross (x mark)\n\nHigh cross, early Medieval free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often richly decorated\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_(disambiguation)\n\nThe cross as a symbol in the Christian Church may refer to either an object or a motion with the hand or fingers did not come into practice in the Christian Church until the third or fourth century A.D.\n\nMembers of the early Christian church would often use a fish, represented by two intersecting arches as a symbol to represent Christian faith.\n\nSome churches avoid having a cross in their place of worship, fearing that the cross may be treated not as an icon or symbol but as an idol. In the same manner, many evangelical churches avoid having statues for the same fear that they will be prayed to and worshiped as idols.\n\nThere are some denominations who claim the cross may offend church attendees as a symbol of torture and death. I wonder what they reflect on when they partake in Communion? I think that if you sanitize what happened to Jesus on the cross wouldnât you run the risk of diminishing the impact of the resurrection? The fact that our Lord, Christ Jesus instructed all disciples to remember His sacrifice by way of the Communion observance indicates that we should not hide what the cross represents: His death and sacrifice for our sins.\n\nWhile the cross or crucifix does remind us that Christ suffered and died for the sins of humanity, without the resurrection Christâs death would have only made him a martyr. It is only after Jesus was resurrected from the grave and following the Holy Spiritâs arrival on the Day of Pentecost when the Christian Church came into being as proof of Christâs Lordship with the fulfillment of the prophecy found in the Scriptures, as we read in Isaiah 53:5-6 (ESV):\n\n5 But he was pierced for our transgressions;\n\nhe was crushed for our iniquities;\n\nupon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,\n\nand with his wounds we are healed.\n\n6 All we like sheep have gone astray;\n\nwe have turnedâevery oneâto his own way;\n\nand the Lord has laid on him\n\nthe iniquity of us all.\n\nIs it wrong to have a symbol such as the cross as a reminder of the sacrifice of the cross? I believe that Jesus felt it was useful to have visual cues to help remind us of the price that he paid for our salvation. We find that the holes left by being nailed to the cross, and by the Centurionâs spear to his side, helped Jesus demonstrate his supernatural victory over death to the disciples, including Thomas who was absent at his first appearance but arrived eight days later, John 20:19-31 (ESV):\n\nJesus Appears to the Disciples\n\n19 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, âPeace be with you.â 20 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus said to them again, âPeace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.â 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, âReceive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld.â\n\nJesus and Thomas\n\n24 Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples told him, âWe have seen the Lord.â But he said to them, âUnless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.â\n\n26 Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, âPeace be with you.â 27 Then he said to Thomas, âPut your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.â 28 Thomas answered him, âMy Lord and my God!â 29 Jesus said to him, âHave you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.â\n\nThe Purpose of This Book\n\n30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; 31 but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.\n\nFootnotes: a. John 20:19 Greek Ioudaioi probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time b. John 20:24 Greek Didymus\n\nThe signs of the wounds Jesus showed his disciples helped them to understand both the suffering he endured and the supernatural victory Christ achieved over death by his resurrection. Interestingly, though Jesus had suffered wounds from the cross, he was able to pass through the locked door of the upper room. And after showing the disciples his wounds, Jesus breathed onto them the breath of the Holy Spirit, to help them go forth in his place, no longer as his disciples, but as apostles of the Gospel of Christ. Jesusâ death on the cross had removed humanityâs debt to sin, Colossians 2:13-14 (ESV):\n\n13 And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, 14 by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.\n\nThe cross is a symbol, not just of the suffering and death that Jesus experienced, but reminds us that while we are called to follow the Lord and may suffer for our faith, we have the assurance that the judgment for our sins has been born by the Lord, 1 Peter 2:20-24 (ESV):\n\n20 For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. 21 For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. 22 He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. 23 When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. 24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.\n\nJust as the cross acts as a reminder to Christians of the sacrifice Jesus made on our behalf, our faith in the Lord is made perfect, not just because he endured the cross, but the holes in his hands and side act as a reminder to God the Father in heaven, as Jesus sits at the right-hand side of the throne of God. Our faith is made perfect through Jesus, Hebrews 12:1-2 (ESV):\n\nJesus, Founder and Perfecter of Our Faith\n\n12 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\nJesus revealed his hands and side to the disciples, it was not so that they would dwell upon his wounds upon the cross. The intent was to give encouragement and hope in the victory of his resurrection. And we read that is exactly what took place, John 20:19-20 (ESV):\n\n19 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, âPeace be with you.â 20 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.\n\nThe disciples were glad when they saw the marks of the crucifixion. Let us, therefore view the cross not as an instrument of torture and death of Christ, but as a symbol for our own hope in his resurrection and be encouraged in the truth of his promise to all believers of their own resurrection on the day Christ returns.\n\nLet us prayâ¦\n\nBenediction â (Hebrews 13:20-21):\n\nNow may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.

Most of us might agree that the recent hot-sultry weather, along with the severe pop-up thunderstorms make it seem like it is mid-summer on the calendar rather than the start.\n\nTalk about stormy weather, todayâs lesson examines two of Jesusâ miracles performed to prove to his disciples his identity as the Son of God. Both miracles occurred as the disciples struggled to overcome wind-generated storms on the Sea of Galilee to reach their appointed destination. However, as we shall see, it often happens in the Scriptures, the lessons taught from a journey are more important than the destination. One example would be Saulâs conversion experience while he journeyed on the Road to Damascus.\n\nI would like to present the first miracle for todayâs lesson, from three points of view found in the Synoptic Gospels, each bearing the common title of Jesus Calms a Storm, while mostly containing the same elements, do have some slight variances. This is what one might expect from the three different points of three different individualsâ views telling what they observed of a common event. The first example comes from the gospel of Matthew 8:23-27 (ESV):\n\nJesus Calms a Storm\n\n23 And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. 24 And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. 25 And they went and woke him, saying, âSave us, Lord; we are perishing.â 26 And he said to them, âWhy are you afraid, O you of little faith?â Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 27 And the men marveled, saying, âWhat sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?â\n\nMatthew gives an account where Jesus goes aboard a boat, followed by the disciples. While Jesus is sleeping, a great storm comes upon the vessel. Fearing for their lives, the disciples wake the Lord, asking him to save them from harm. Jesus asks them why they fear and then rebukes them for their lack of faith. Having rebuked the disciples for their lack of faith, Jesus then rebukes the wins and the sea. The resulting change from a great storm to a great calm prompts the disciples to ask what sort of man is their Lord, who can change the wind and the sea by the mere words of his commands?\n\nOur second account of this miracle of the Lord comes from the gospel of Mark 4:35-41 (ESV):\n\nJesus Calms a Storm\n\n35 On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, âLet us go across to the other side.â 36 And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him. 37 And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. 38 But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, âTeacher, do you not care that we are perishing?â 39 And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, âPeace! Be still!â And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 40 He said to them, âWhy are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?â 41 And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, âWho then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?â\n\nMarkâs account gives us additional information from Matthewâs gospel. We learn that it is the evening when the disciples join Jesus aboard a boat to cross the Sea of Galilee. However, we also learn the group sails in the boat, leaving behind a crowd. It seems that some of the crowd decided to follow the boat containing Jesus and the disciples, as we learn that other boats were with him. Mark gives additional details, indicating Jesus was at the stern of the boat, where had fallen asleep on a cushion. Mark indicates that Jesus rebukes the storm and then his disciples, whereas Matthew has the order reversed. It could be because Mark felt the Lord rebuking the sea was more significant than his personal rebuke of the disciples. We also learn that this miracle which prompted the disciples to question the identity of their Lord came out of fear, at least from Markâs point of view.\n\nNow let us look at Lukeâs take on these events, taken from the gospel of Luke 8:22-25 (ESV):\n\nJesus Calms a Storm\n\n22 One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, âLet us go across to the other side of the lake.â So they set out, 23 and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger. 24 And they went and woke him, saying, âMaster, Master, we are perishing!â And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm. 25 He said to them, âWhere i"
