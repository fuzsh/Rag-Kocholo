        "text": "In the novel “Tangerine” by Edward Bloor, on page 269 he states “The Truth Shall Set You Free”. Some might be wondering “What does this mean?” Or “Why did Edward Bloor write this?”. Edward Bloor wrote this quote because in the novel “Tangerine”, Paul has been keeping lots of secrets in his life about Erik and since he moved to Lake Windsor he’s kept even more. Paul didn’t have the guts to say everything until Antoine Thomas said “The truth shall set you free”.\n\nFor all of Paul’s life, he has been bullied by his brother Erik and hasn’t told anyone because he feared him. On page 263 and 264 of the book, Paul had a flashback “I remembered Erik’s fingers prying my eyelids open while Vincent Castor sprayed white paint into them.”. This illustrates …show more content…\n\nWhile they are trying to find the solution, Paul already found the solution but he doesn’t bother to tell the truth because he thinks no one will believe him because of his glasses. On page 147 of the online book, the homeowners association are talking about who keeps stealing the koi from the pond, Mr. Costello says “We believe that some local person stole them and sold them”, then Paul says “I don’t believe that”, “Think about it. How could some local person, some koi thief from Tangerine, stop at the front of our development, in that wide-open space, without anyone seeing him? How could he fish for, catch, and drive away with a string of big orange shiny fish with no one seeing him?” Then Mr. Costello said, “I don’t know, Paul. Maybe he does it in the middle of the night when people are asleep. Anyway, it’s the only theory we have. Unless you have a better on.” Paul then responds “The ospreys”. This illustrates that the people were thinking that someone from Tangerine did it because they are known as one of the toughest and meanest people and probably because of race. On page 5 of the online book, Paul says “But I can see. I can see everything. I can see things that Mom and Dad can’t. Or won’t.”. This shows that Paul can see things that no one else can see, like the homeowners, they didn’t"
