And he’s pummelled them all.\n\nIn Batman, DC Comics has its greatest antithesis to Superman, and that’s exactly why the caped crusader has managed to leap over him in a single bound to the top of the DC Universe.\n\nCheering for Superman is like wanting to see the guy who made it on looks continue to succeed\n\nSuperman works in the light of day, sucking up the attention of adoring masses like the sunlight that powers him. Batman works in the shadows of Gotham — and, in some cases, is even hounded by the police officers he’s trying to help. The man of steel ensures his villains are as well-taken-care-of as the civilians he rescues with the same humility and two-bit smile of a boy scout sewing his newest patch onto a sash. Batman breaks their bones and hangs them upside down from high-rise rooftops, threatening to drop them if they don’t talk.\n\nMost of all, Superman is nearly invincible. How can it possibly be entertaining for fans to cheer for a character who writers have made so powerful — with super strength, heat vision, x-ray vision, flight, super speed, cold breath and enhanced hearing — that there’s no almost no sensical way for him to ever lose in a fight, unless a wad of kryptonite is involved. That might be a good thing for the character, but it’s terrible for the audience.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAt the beginning of a typical Superman story, fans can already expect him to tidily handle Lex Luthor, Bizarro or Darkseid and walk away unscathed. There’s no mystery, no second-guessing that makes the real dangers present in a Batman comic or film to allow the audience to suspend belief and question whether the hero will win out in the end.\n\nBatman is different — he’s been broken physically and mentally — and despite his years of training in the martial arts, he could have his life ended at any time by a bank robber with a revolver and a lucky shot.\n\nNothing about Bruce Wayne’s life has been perfect. Even the exorbitant wealth he inherited came at the price of watching a mugger tragically gun down his parents in front of him as a child. Wayne trained for a decade with assassins, detectives, ninjas and crime fighters across the globe to eventually have the skill to handle the Joker’s insanity, outsmart the Riddler and defeat Bane in hand-to-hand combat. Superman’s abilities to fight crime were gifted to him.\n\nHow can it possibly be entertaining for fans to cheer for a character who writers have made so powerful?\n\nRooting for Batman is akin to supporting the little guy, the hard-worker on your team who doesn’t have the talent of his coworkers and is constantly forced to prove himself among them. Cheering for Superman is like wanting to see the guy who made it on looks alone continue to inexplicably succeed.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat’s why it was so satisfying for fans to see Batman crush Superman in a legendary moment of comics lore. In The Dark Knight Returns, a graphic novel written by Frank Miller, Batman comes out of retirement in his sixties to once again save Gotham. Superman has naturally become an errand boy for a Ronald Reagan-esque, power-hungry president who demands he takes out Batman for the good of America.\n\nSuperman was nice enough to warn Batman he’d have to put him down. That was all Batman needed to gain the edge. Clad in a suit of armour, Batman pulls out all the stops. He’s able to keep Superman at bay initially with a sonic emitter, electric gauntlets and even a splash of acid to the face.\n\nIt would be easy to expect Batman to be levelled with a quick beating, but it’s in this confrontation that he proves his brain is superior to Superman’s brawn. Batman enlists the help of a one-armed Oliver Queen to hit Superman with a kryptonite arrow. He proceeds to lay a beating on his weakened opponent, taunting him with the fact that he could have killed him if he made the kryptonite arrow stronger. With Superman bleeding profusely from his mouth, Batman grabs him by the throat and tells him:\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I want you to remember, Clark, in all the years to come … In your most private moments … I want you to remember my hand at your throat. I want you to remember the one man who beat you.”\n\nSuperman works in the light of day, sucking up the attention of adoring masses like the sunlight that powers him\n\nBatman’s ability to win battles before they even begin was even taken advantage of in JLA: Tower of Babel, where it was revealed that the caped crusader had contingency plans for each member of the Justice League in case they ever went rogue. Ra’s al Ghul steals Batman’s plans and uses them to incapacitate the entire Justice League.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nBatman vs. Superman: Why Superman’s problems are more real than emo Bruce Wayne’s\n\nThe hero we deserve: Frank Miller on the mature, edgier Batman\n\nWill there ever be a saturation point for box office superheroes?\n\nBatman is aware of his limits. He knows he’s only a man — and so does his audience. They continue to be captivated by a character still able to still find a way to defeat super-powered opponents despite his limitations.\n\nSuperman may be known as the man of tomorrow — but the realism grounded into Batman’s story and character is what will take DC into the future.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
