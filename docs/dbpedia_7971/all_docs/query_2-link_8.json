There’s little comfort for him facing challenges that often seem insurmountable, especially when he feels misunderstood by his parents and threatened by his older brother. This is the case with Paul Fisher, the protagonist of Tangerine. Does he crumble in his difficult journey to become a young adult? It would be unfair of me to reveal any part of this engrossing story. Why spoil the reader’s fun in discovering for himself the striking originality and cumulative power of this unforgettable novel?\n\nAs a parent, I find Tangerine inspiring and uplifting because it presents issues relevant to our times: race relations, sibling rivalry, competitive sports, environmental concerns, and more. But most importantly, it deals with human values—values essential to a boy’s growth into a mature and insightful young man. Paul may be visually impaired, but it’s never disabled him. If anything, his so-called handicap has enhanced his powers of perception, especially where his parents are concerned: \"But I can see. I can see everything. I can see things that Mom and Dad can’t. Or won’t.\"\n\nOr won’t are key words in Paul’s parents’ relationship with his older brother, Erik, a relationship that verges on the dark side—as does Paul’s own relationship with Erik. Both athletes, both born of the same parents, Paul and Erik are as different as night and day. The interaction of their individual personalities is what I found compelling, not only as a reader but also as a parent. Erik lurks in shadows. Paul strives for the light. Never has sibling rivalry been portrayed in such an exciting, yet menacing way.\n\nAlthough Tangerine interweaves important themes, it never bogs down in a stodgy seriousness, but always manages to be consistently entertaining. To try to describe the particular nature of Tangerine as a novel would not do it justice. It shouldn’t be pigeonholed. It’s totally unto itself. Unique! But enough of my pontificating on the virtues of Tangerine. Dear reader, please do yourself a favor: Turn this page and immerse yourself in a wondrous story that will haunt you long after you’ve read it.\n\n—Danny DeVito\n\nThe house looked strange. It was completely empty now, and the door was flung wide open, like something wild had just escaped from it. Like it was the empty, two-story tomb of some runaway zombie.\n\nMom called out to me, Take the bag, Paul. I want to have one last look around.\n\nI said, I just did. I didn’t see anything.\n\nWell, maybe you didn’t look everywhere. I’ll just be a minute.\n\nI looked everywhere.\n\nWait for me out by the car, please. We can’t have the new owners thinking we left a mess behind.\n\nI picked up the garbage bag and hauled it out to the curb. We’d already packed up our sleeping bags, suitcases, and two folding chairs—all neatly wedged into the back of Mom’s Volvo wagon. Now only this ten-gallon, self-tying, lemon-scented garbage bag remained, and we planned to toss it into the Dumpster behind the 7-Eleven. But first Mom had to make sure that I didn’t overlook anything. She was worried that the people who bought our house, people who we’ve never met, would find a McDonald’s swizzle stick and think less of us.\n\nOnce we dump this garbage bag, that will be it. That will be the last evidence that the Fisher family ever lived in Houston. Dad and my brother, Erik, are already gone. They’ve been living in Florida for a week now, with the sleeping bags, suitcases, and chairs that they stuffed into Dad’s Range Rover. The rest of our furniture left yesterday, professionally packed by two guys who came to really hate Mom. By now it should be over halfway to our new address—a place called Lake Windsor Downs in Tangerine County, Florida.\n\nI set the garbage bag down and leaned against the station wagon, staring east, directly into the rising sun. I’m not supposed to do that because my glasses are so thick. My brother, Erik, once told me that if I ever look directly into the sun with these glasses, my eyeballs will burst into flame, like dry leaves under a magnifying glass.\n\nI don’t believe that. But I turned back around anyway, and I looked west down our street at the receding line of black mailboxes. Something about them fascinated me. I leaned my chin against the top of the station wagon and continued to stare. An old familiar feeling came over me, like I had forgotten something. What was it? What did I need to remember?\n\nSomewhere behind me a car engine started up, and a scene came back to me:\n\nI remembered a black metal mailbox, on a black metal pole.\n\nI was riding my bike home at dinnertime, heading east down this street, with the sun setting behind me. I heard a loud roar like an animal’s, like a predator snarling. I swiveled my head around, still pedaling, and looked back. All I could see was the red sun, huge now, setting right over the middle of the street. I couldn’t see anything else. But I could hear the roar, even louder now, and I recognized it: the roar of an engine revved up to full throttle.\n\nI tilted up my sports goggles to unfog them. Then I turned back and saw it—a black car—just an outline at first, then clear and detailed. It came right out of the sun. I saw a man hanging out of the passenger window, hanging way out. He had something pulled over his face, some kind of ski mask, and he was holding a long metal baseball bat in both hands, like a murder weapon.\n\nThen the gears ground, the tires squealed, and the car leaped forward at an impossible speed. I swiveled back, terrified, and pedaled as hard as I could. I heard the roar of the car closing in on me, louder and louder, like it had smelled its prey. I shot a glance into my bike mirror, and there it was—half a block behind, then ten yards, then one yard. The man in the ski mask leaned farther out the window. He pulled the bat back and up. Then he brought it forward in a mighty swing, right at my head. I dove to the right, landing on my face in the grass, just as the baseball bat smashed into the mailbox, exploding it right off its pole. Voices inside the car screamed—animal-fury screams—as the crushed black metal clattered across the street.\n\nI scrambled back up. I left my bike there, its wheels spinning, and ran for home. I ran in absolute terror, listening for the sound of the car squealing back around to come after me again.\n\nI burst through the front door, crying hysterically. My goggles were twisted back around my head. I spun around and around looking for Mom. Then Mom and Dad were both in front of me, holding on to my shoulders, trying to calm me down, trying to understand the word that I was saying over and over.\n\nIt was Erik. I was saying Erik.\n\nDad finally understood. He looked right into my eyes and asked. What do you mean by ‘Erik’? Erik what, Paul?\n\nI stammered out, Erik. He tried to kill me.\n\nMom and Dad let go of my shoulders and stepped back. They looked at each other, puzzled. Then Dad raised his arm up and pointed to the right, into the dining room. There was Erik. He was sitting at the dining-room table. He was doing his homework.\n\nDad eyeballed me for a few seconds, then he went out front to look for my bike.\n\nErik called over, There he goes. Blaming me again.\n\nMom took me into the kitchen and got me a glass of water. She ran her finger under the strap of my goggles and slipped them off. Then she said, Honey, you know how it is with your eyesight. You know you can’t see very well. And that was that.\n\nBut I can see. I can see everything. I can see things that Mom and Dad can’t. Or won’t.\n\nMom’s voice broke into my remembrance. Paul?\n\nMy chin was still pressed against the car. She was standing next to me. Paul? Are you with us? I leaned back as she beeped the auto alarm and opened the tailgate. You’re remembering all the good times you had here. Aren’t you?\n\nI shook my head to clear it. I reached to pick up the garbage bag. My arms felt weak. I muttered, I was remembering. I was remembering something that happened.\n\nShe held up a white cigarette butt and said, You don’t know anything about this, do you?\n\nNo.\n\nI found it in the garage, behind the water heater.\n\nI opened up the garbage bag enough for her to slip it inside. I said, Good work, Mom. She walked quickly back up to the house, laid her keys inside the foyer, and pulled the door firmly closed.\n\nAnd that was that. The keys were locked in. The zombie was locked out. And we were on our way.\n\nPart 1\n\nFriday, August 18\n\nFor Mom the move from Texas to Florida was a military operation, like the many moves she had made as a child. We had our orders. We had our supplies. We had a timetable. If it had been necessary to do so, we would have driven the eight hundred miles from our old house to our new house straight through, without stopping at all. We would have refueled the Volvo while hurtling along at seventy-five miles per hour next to a moving convoy-refueling truck.\n\nFortunately this wasn’t necessary. Mom had calculated that we could leave at 6:00 A.M. central daylight time, stop three times at twenty minutes per stop, and still arrive at our destination at 9:00 P.M. eastern daylight time.\n\nI guess that’s challenging if you’re the driver. It’s pretty boring if you’re just sitting there, so I slept on and off until, in the early evening, we turned off Interstate 10 somewhere in western Florida.\n\nThis scenery was not what I had expected at all, and I stared out the window, fascinated by it. We passed mile after mile of green fields overflowing with tomatoes and onions and watermelons. I suddenly had this crazy feeling like I wanted to bolt from the car and run through the fields until I couldn’t run anymore. I said to Mom, This is Florida? This is what it looks like?\n\nMom laughed. Yeah. What did you think it looked like?\n\nI don’t know. A beach with a fifty-story condo on it.\n\nWell, it looks like that, too. Florida’s a huge place. We’ll be living in an area that’s more like this one. There are still a lot of farms around.\n\nWhat do they grow? I bet they grow tangerines.\n\nNo. Not too many. Not anymore. This is too far north for citrus trees. Every few years they get a deep freeze that wipes them all out. Most of the citrus growers here have sold off their land to developers.\n\nYeah? And what do the developers do with it?\n\nWell . . . they develop it. They plan communities with nice houses, and schools, and industrial parks. They create jobs—construction jobs, teaching jobs, civil engineering jobs—like your father’s.\n\nBut once we got farther south and crossed into Tangerine County, we did start to see groves of citrus trees, and they were an amazing sight. They were perfect. Thousands upon thousands of trees in the red glow of sundown, perfectly shaped and perfectly aligned, vertically and horizontally, like squares in a million-square grid.\n\nMom pointed. Look. Here comes the first industrial park.\n\nI looked up ahead and saw the highway curve off, left and right, into spiral exit ramps, like rams’ horns. Low white buildings with black windows stretched out in both directions. They were all identical.\n\nMom said, There’s our exit. Right up there.\n\nI looked ahead another quarter mile and saw another pair of spiral ramps, but I couldn’t see much else. A fine brown dust was now blowing across the highway, drifting like snow against the shoulders and swirling up into the air.\n\nWe turned off Route 27, spiraled around the rams’ horns, and headed east. Suddenly the fine brown dirt became mixed with thick black smoke.\n\nMom said, Good heavens! Look at that.\n\nI looked to where she was pointing, up to the left, out in a field, and my heart sank. The black smoke was pouring from a huge bonfire of trees. Citrus trees.\n\nI said, Why are they doing that? Why are they just burning them up?\n\nTo clear the land.\n\nWell, why don’t they build houses out of them? Or homeless shelters? Or something?\n\nMom shook her head. I don’t think they can build with them. I don’t think those trees have any use other than for fruit. She smiled. You never hear people bragging that their dining-room set is solid grapefruit, do you?\n\nI didn’t smile back.\n\nMom pointed to the right and said, There’s another one.\n\nSure enough. Same size; same flames licking up the sides; same smoke billowing out. It was like a Texas football bonfire, but nobody was dancing around it, and nobody was celebrating anything.\n\nThen, in an instant, in the blink of an eye, we crossed over from this wasteland into a place carpeted with green grass, with trees along both sides of the road and flower beds running down the middle of a median strip. We could see the roofs of big, expensive houses peeking up over the landscaping.\n\nMom said, This is where the developments begin. This one is called the Manors of Coventry. Aren’t they beautiful? Ours is a little farther in.\n\nWe went past the Villas at Versailles, which, if anything, looked even more expensive. Then we saw a high gray wall and a series of wrought-iron letters that spelled out LAKE WINDSOR DOWNS. We passed iron gates and a pond of some kind. Then we made a couple of turns and pulled into a wide driveway.\n\nMom announced, This is it. This is our house. It was big—two stories high—and very white, with aqua trim, like a Miami Dolphins football helmet. A new wooden fence ran around both sides to the back, where it met up with that high gray wall. The wall, apparently, surrounded the entire development.\n\nThe garage door opened up with a smooth mechanical hum. Dad was standing in there with his arms open. He called out, Perfect timing, you two. The pizzas got here five minutes ago.\n\nMom and I climbed out of the car, stiff and hungry. Dad came outside, clicking the garage door closed. He put an arm around each of us and guided us toward the front, saying, Let’s do this the right way. Huh? Let’s go in the visitors’ door.\n\nDad led us through the front door into a tiled foyer two stories high. We turned to the left and passed through an enormous great room with furniture and boxes piled all around it. We ended up in an area off the kitchen that had a small, round table and four chairs. Erik was sitting in one of the chairs. He waved casually to Mom. He ignored me.\n\nMom waved back at him, but she was looking at the boxes stacked in the kitchen. She said to Dad, These boxes are marked DINING ROOM.\n\nDad said, Uh-huh.\n\nUh-huh. Well, I marked DINING ROOM on them so the movers would put them in the dining room.\n\nOK. Erik’ll put them over there. He looked at me and added, Erik and Paul.\n\nMom asked, Did the movers break anything?\n\nNo. They didn’t break a thing. They were real pros. Nice guys, too.\n\nMom and I each grabbed a chair. Erik opened a pizza box, pulled out a slice, and started stuffing it into his mouth.\n\nMom said, How about waiting for the rest of us, Erik?\n\nHe gave her a tomatoey grin. Dad passed out paper plates, napkins, and cans of soda. Once Dad sat down, the rest of us started to eat.\n\nEverybody’s mouth was full for a minute; then Mom said to Dad, So? What have you been doing?\n\nDad wiped his mouth. Work. Trying to get organized up there. Trying to get in to see Old Charley Burns. He looked at me. He’s a real character. You’ll have to meet him. Spends half his life at the stock-car races. He’s crazy about stock-car racing.\n\nMom said, You mean he’s really not there? You can’t get in to see him because he’s not there?\n\nRight. He’s really not there. He’s up at Darlington, or at Talladega, or at Daytona.\n\nMom was concerned. And that’s OK?\n\nI don’t know that it’s OK, but that’s the way it is. He’s the boss. He makes his own hours. He told me I can make my own hours, too. He looked over at Erik. That’ll be good for us. I’ll be able to go to football practice every day.\n\nI thought to myself, OK, here we are. How long did it take Dad to get to his favorite topic, the Erik Fisher Football Dream? I’d heard it all before. Too many times. And I was about to hear it again. I tried to head him off by asking him something, anything, but he was too fast for me. \"It’s a great opportunity for you boys, too. Erik will get the exposure he needs in the press. The Tangerine Times is crazy about high school football. And we’re just down the road from the University of Florida—you know, the Gators? In fact, Old Charley is a big Gators fan. And Florida State and the University of Miami aren’t far away. These big-time Florida schools like to draft Florida boys for their teams.\"\n\nThat was that. Dad was now off into the Erik Fisher Football Dream. As soon as I got an opening I said, May I be excused? I’d like to go find my bedroom.\n\nDad said, Sure thing. You’re at the top of the stairs, to the right. Erik’s down at the other end. And you have two guest rooms in between. You guys should never hear each other.\n\nI retraced my steps through the great room, went up the stairs, and turned right. I had to squeeze into my bedroom past a stack of boxes. I switched on the light and saw one that had PAUL’S SHEETS written on it, so I opened it and made up my bed. Then I found my computer carton and set it up on the desk. When I got around to putting my clothes away in the dresser, I came across a box that said ERIK’S TROPHIES. I felt a surge of anger, Mom’s anger, at the moving guys for doing that. I picked it up and carried it out to the top of the stairs.\n\nErik was standing down in the foyer. He had the front door cracked open. He was talking to a group of kids—at least two girls and one guy—telling them that he would see them later.\n\nI put the box down quietly and hurried back into my room. I turned on the computer, got into my private journal, and wrote until about eleven o’clock. Then I lay down on the bed and fell asleep—but I woke up almost immediately. Someone was running down the hall. It was Erik. I heard him run down the stairs, go out the front door, and pull away in a loud car.\n\nI couldn’t get back to sleep. My mind started racing like an engine. I started thinking about our old house. Then I started thinking about a zombie, a pissed-off zombie. Dragging one foot behind him. Keeping to the right. Taking his time. Slowly, surely, stalking his way down Interstate 10.\n\nSaturday, August 19\n\nI woke up in the dark to the sound of an explosion. I groped around for my regular glasses—unable to find them in this new bedroom, upstairs in this new house. Then my glasses suddenly appeared on the nightstand, illuminated by a flash of lightning.\n\nI’d no sooner pulled them on when another explosion made the windows rattle and the walls shake. The lightning once again filled the room, painful and surprising, like the flash of a camera in my face. I waited for more explosions to follow, but none did, and I fell back asleep.\n\nI woke up again at seven, still wearing my glasses. I walked down the stairs, unbolted the front door, and stepped out into the morning air. It wasn’t what I expected. The air had a gray tint to it, and a damp, foul smell like an ashtray.\n\nSmoke, I thought. Something around here is on fire.\n\nI walked back inside and turned left, toward the sound of a television. Mom was sitting on a stool at the high counter that separates the kitchen from the rest of the great room.\n\nMom, I think something’s on fire around here.\n\nWhat? Where?\n\nStep out front and take a look. And smell the air.\n\nMom slid off the stool and hurried out the front door. She made it exactly as far as I had when the smoke stopped her in her tracks.\n\nWhere’s it coming from? she cried, shuffling backward in her bedroom slippers. She stared at the top of the house, looking for flames.\n\nI don’t know. I’ll check around back. I pulled my T-shirt up to cover my mouth and nose and ran off into the blowing gray smoke. I circled completely around our new house, but I couldn’t see the source of the fire.\n\nMom was on her way back inside. I’m calling the Fire Department.\n\nWhat about Dad and Erik? Should I wake them up?\n\nThey’re up already. They’re up and out. They went to Gainesville to look at the football stadium.\n\nGainesville?\n\nThat’s where the University of Florida is, honey.\n\nOh. I guess we don’t need to save them, then, I said as I started to feel the walls for heat. You know, it could be the electric wiring inside the walls. It could smolder for a while in there and then burst into flame.\n\nIt could? Mom replied in horror. She snatched up the portable phone and dialed 911, talking as she followed my hand’s progress along the wall of the great room.\n\nThe builder of this development certainly should have known how to wire a—Hello! Yes, I want the Fire Department. Mom felt the wall with her free hand. Yes! There’s a fire at . . . Oh, Paul! What’s our address? Lake Windsor Downs! What is it? Run outside and find the house number!\n\nI sprinted out, read the black numbers over the garage, sprinted back in, and shouted, 1225!\n\nBut Mom had already dug out a contract and was reading into the phone, 1225 Kensington Gardens Drive, Lake Windsor Downs. What? Where is it? It’s in Tangerine! It’s just outside of Tangerine! Mom listened for another ten seconds, turning red. Then, at the end of her patience, she yelled into the phone, What more do you need to know? It’s the place with the smoke pouring out of it. Get somebody out here! She listened again, said, Yes, please hurry, and hung up.\n\nWe resumed our search of the house and waited for the approaching wail of the fire engines. Twenty minutes later Mom picked up the phone to call the Fire Department again as I peered out the front window.\n\nWait, Mom! I shouted. I see them. They’re on the other side of the development.\n\nMom and I ran outside and watched an old red fire engine cruising slowly up and down the streets.\n\nThe fire engine turned in our direction. We waved and hollered and managed to attract the driver’s attention. When the engine rolled up in front of our house and the driver got out, we saw that he was alone. He didn’t look to be much older than Erik. He had on knee-high black-and-yellow boots, a pair of cutoff shorts, and a white shirt that had TANGERINE VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT—WAYNE written over the breast pocket.\n\nHe waved to us and smiled brightly. Y’all the ones who called about the fire?\n\nMom turned and pointed at our house. Yes! Yes, right here.\n\nThe young man didn’t move. Where’s the fire at, ma’am?\n\nMom directed her voice at him like a laser beam. You get in there and answer that question for yourself, young man. I called you twenty minutes ago. Is our house about to burst into flames while we’re standing out here?\n\nAny of your walls or doors feel hot, ma’am?\n\nNo.\n\nThen I’d say you don’t need to worry. You don’t got a fire. Just a bunch of smoke.\n\nSmoke? Smoke from where?\n\nWithout a moment’s hesitation, the young man’s left arm shot up and pointed to the open field just beyond the wall at the end of our street. Right out there. It’s the muck fire.\n\nIt’s the what?\n\nMuck fire, ma’am. That field probably got hit by lightning last night. Stirred up the muck fire.\n\nLast night? So . . . how long is this fire going to burn?\n\nThe young man laughed out loud and threw up his hands. It’s been burning for as long as I can remember.\n\nMom’s mouth dropped. She stared at him in disbelief as he continued cheerfully, Muck fires don’t go out. They’re burning all the time. Burning right there under the ground, all the time. Sometimes the rain’ll damp them down, but they’re still smoldering. Y’all ever hear of lignite?\n\nMom and I shook our heads dumbly. Wayne continued, Well, that field’s full of lignite. Lignite is, like, one step before coal. There’s hundreds of miles of it under here.\n\nMom turned to me with a look of pure puzzlement. Well, I’m sure your father was never told about any of this. I’m sure the Homeowners’ Association will want to know about this.\n\nOh, they know about it, ma’am. Lots of people call us when they first move in here. We wind up having to explain it to them.\n\nI watched Mom struggling to understand this. You explain it to them?\n\nYes, ma’am.\n\n\"And then what do"
