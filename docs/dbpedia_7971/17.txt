(born 1950). American children’s author and playwright Edward Bloor used various subjects and settings to engage his audience. However, he frequently wrote about underdogs who gain the strength to stand up for themselves.

Edward William Bloor was born on October 12, 1950, in Trenton, New Jersey. He graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from Fordham University in New York in 1973. From 1983 to 1986 Bloor taught high school in Florida. He then worked at Harcourt Brace School Publishers (now Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) as a language arts textbook editor. During this time he began to write books for a young-adult audience. Although he began to publish his novels, he continued to work as an editor until his retirement in 2015.

Bloor’s first published novel was Tangerine (1997). The book explores the life of an eighth-grader as he fights to overcome the evilness of his older brother. In Crusader (1999) 15-year-old Roberta fights to find out who killed her mother years ago. The story blends multiple subplots covering such areas as politics, the media, racism, alienation, and suicide. London Calling (2006) involves elements of ghosts and time travel as the main character learns to believe in himself. Bloor’s Memory Lane (2010) features a theme park where attendees can go to find such good memories from the past that they will forget the present. Summer of Smoke (2014) analyzes race relations in the 1960s and ’70s. Bloor’s Candlemas Eve (2017) follows the story of a poor brother and sister and their chosen paths during the Industrial Revolution. His other books include Story Time (2004), Taken (2007), and A Plague Year (2011).
