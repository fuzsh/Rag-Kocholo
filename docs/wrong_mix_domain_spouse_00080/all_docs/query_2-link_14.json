A9 to 5: The Musical 11/6/10 ~ Memphis Tour: Dee Hoty, Diana DeGarmo, Mamie Parris, Joseph Mahowald, Kristine Zbornik, Gregg Goodbrod. Beautiful capture of the tour cast.

A couple quick dropouts, but no major blackouts; some washout in the wides, but nothing too terrible; no obstructions from heads or railings; excellent sound 2 DVDs AThe 39 Steps 2009 ~ Broadway Arnie Burton, Charles Edwards, Jennifer Ferrin, Cliff Saunders. The 39 Steps is a play adapted from the 1915 novel by John Buchan and the 1935 film by Alfred Hitchcock. The play's concept calls for the entirety of the 1935 adventure film “The 39 Steps” to be performed nearly verbatim onstage, but with a cast of four. One actor plays the hero, Richard Hannay, an actress plays the three women whom he has romantic entanglements with, and two other actors play every other character in the show: heroes, villains, men, women, children and even the occasional inanimate object. This often requires lighting fast quick changes and occasionally for them to play multiple characters at once. Thus the film's serious spy story is played mainly for laughs, and the script is full of allusions to (and puns on the titles of) other Alfred Hitchcock films, including Rear Window, Psycho and North by Northwest”. Well filmed from the balcony. A 42nd Street 1986 ~ American cast in Tokyo Elizabeth Allen, Jamie Ross, Clare Leach, Lee Roy Reams, Carole Cook, Joseph Bova, Beth Leavel, Andy Lee-Danny Carroll.

I strongly recommend this to any comedy lover. This is such a funny show, I really enjoyed this. This is a workshop of the show so there is very little set but it does not effect it honestly. The video is great to, it has nice close ups. It also follows everything very good, the only problem is that the show takes place outside so during the last 20 mins it gets dark to show night.

B Aladdin 8/22/14 ~ Broadway Adam Jacobs, Courtney Reed, James Monroe Iglehart, Jonathan Freeman,Clifton Davis, Don Darryl Rivera, Brian Gonzales, Andrew Cao (u/s Omar) This is such a fun show, and it’s really well transferred from the film. The sets and costumes are particularly fantastic, and the cast is incredible. Act one has three major blackouts: the scene between Arabian Nights and One Jump Ahead, the scene between One Jump Ahead and Proud of Your Boy, and the last 22 minutes of the act, which is all of Friend Like Me and Act One Finale. There is also a head that blocks center stage and the action is often lost behind it. Act two is much better with no blackouts and only some heads on the bottom that are worked around well. It’s filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. There’s a lot of chatter and rustling from the audience, but the sound is otherwise excellent.

Samantha, Adam, and Savvy are fantastic in their roles, the music is gorgeous, and the sets are beautiful and clever. One of the best new shows I’ve seen in a while.

The top of the projections at the back of the stage are blocked by the top of the stage, but they're just the show names/logos, and if you're watching this dvd, you probably know what they are anyway. There are two very small blackouts during Unexpected Song for 30 seconds each, and then all of Starlight Express (Starlight sequence) is blacked out. The rest of the concert is filmed in mostly close-ups, with the occasional medium or wide shot when there were multiple singers.

She returned to find she had been replaced by her understudy (Brittney Kissinger). The firing became national news and generated a great deal of publicity.

Heads are visible in the frame throughout, and occasionally block the action onstage. B Arsenic And Old Lace 1986 ~ Broadway, Revival Jean Stapleton, Polly Holliday,Tony Roberts, Abe Vigoda, Larry Storch. Amazing quality for a show of it's age. It looks like it was recorded from a tripod, maybe this is the unedited Press Reel footage, or recorded for the cast, but it's hard to tell for sure. Some generational loss, but not too bad.

Conley is the epitome of a true star, and the way he pulls off the tricks makes this man an entertainment genius. Through out this recording there is a two minute drop-out when Barnum went off stage to talk with audience members etc, but other than that the show is intact.

A Bernarda Alba 3/14/06 ~ New York Phylicia Rashad, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Nikki M James, Sally Murphy, Saundra Santiago, Yolande Bavan, Judith Blazer, Candy Buckley. Lyrics and music by Michael John LaChiusa. \"The House of Bernarda Alba, Federico García Lorca’s final play, on which the new musical, Bernarda Alba, is based, was written in 1936, the same year in which the illustrious Spanish poet and playwright was executed by General Francisco Franco’s militia soon after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Lorca became a symbol for the thousands of martyred Spaniards who fell victim to Fascist tyranny. For many years Franco’s government attempted to eradicate the memory of Lorca—his books were prohibited, a ban that was not officially rescinded until 1971. Given the subsequent circumstances of Lorca’s tragic end, it is difficult not see his play as both a tale of a controlling woman in a man's world, and as a political allegory. The title character in the musical, played by Phylicia Rashad, proclaims that she and her household—her five grown daughters, her mother, her servants—will observe a long period of mourning, following the funeral of her second husband. “Not a breath of outside air is going to enter this house,” Bernarda declares. “It's going to feel like we've bricked up the doors and windows.” The outside world of their village, however, seeps in. Despite Bernarda’s tyrannical measures the daughters’ desires collide with their mother's iron rule. Simply set on an almost bare stage to music inspired by the rhythms of flamenco, Bernarda Alba tells a story of longing, despair and desire.\" Presented at new York's Lincoln Center. Nicely filmed, with great close-ups. Also includes scanned Playbill info, 2 short clips and a review. A The Best is Yet to Come: The Music of Cy Coleman 05/28/2011 ~Off Broadway Billy Stritch, Lillias White, Howard McGillin, Rachel York, David Burnham, Sally Mayes. Audience shot with some obstructions to the picture for the first 7 minutes ; filmed from about the 4th row and a little off to the side. AThe Best Little Whorehouse In Texas Goes Public 5/13/94 ~ Broadway Dee Hoty, Ronn Carroll, Kevin Cooney, David Doty, Scott Holmes, Joe Hart. Directed and choreographed by Tommy Tune. RARE FIND! \"A sequel to the 1978 hit The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, it is more a series of burlesque-style sketches and musical interludes than a traditional book musical. Hoping to recover $26 million in back taxes owed them by Las Vegas whorehouse Stallion Fields, the IRS lures former brothel madam Mona Stangley out of retirement to run the operation.\n\nComplications arise when billionaire Sam Dallas arranges the sale of shares in the enterprise on the stock exchange and right-wing politician Senator A. Harry Hardast objects to his plan. The Vegas locale allows for an ongoing parade of barely-dressed showgirls in glitzy Bob Mackie-esque costumes, Sonny and Cher, Elvis Presley, Liberace, and Siegfried and Roy impersonators, and a two-bit stand-up comic acting as emcee against a background of flashing neon lights and accompanied by the sound of everjangling slot machines.\" Broadway flop with just 12 official performances. Fairly good video, filmed from the orchestra section, mostly a full stage shot. Much spotlight washout, with heads along the bottom of the screen throughout, but completely watchable.

Nice intimate concert that featured her talking about each song that was requested by the audience members prior to her performing them. The stories were just as amazing as her vocals.

Songs performed were As If We Never Said Goodbye, Plays the Violin, Love Song, Meadowlark, Whoever You Are I Love You, No One is Alone, When There's No One, Memory and Send in the Clowns. A-\n\nBig 1996 ~ Broadway Daniel H Jenkins, Crista Moore, Lori Aine Bennett, Patrick Levis, Joan Barber, Brett Tabisel. This video looks to be unedited footage that was probably used for Press Reels. Has counter numbers along the bottom of the screen. It's most of the show, with all of the musical numbers, but there are times when the camera is turned off. Filmed from a tripod with audio patched in directly from the sound board. Some generational loss, and a slight hissing sound. Disc also includes an episode of Broadway Beat featuring the show. About an hour and a half in length.
