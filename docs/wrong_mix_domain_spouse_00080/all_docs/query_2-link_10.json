I have been teaching musical theatre for the past 17 years––Northern Kentucky University for 2 years and Webster University for 15 years. I entered the world of musical theatre as a music director/pianist/conductor/vocal coach. At Webster I teach all four levels of musical theatre, sometimes in collaboration with my cherished colleague, Lara Teeter and sometimes alone. I’ve described my teaching duties below. In addition, I teach the sophomore advanced theory and musicianship for the musical theatre majors. I also work with each of our majors as vocal coach on a regular basis, working both on their voice studio material and their classroom material. The goal for these coachings is to bridge the divide that we have found sometimes occurs between the voice studio and the classroom. It consists of equal parts of musical theatre vocal styles and acting work. For the last 10 years, I’ve worked freelance for Hal Leonard publishing as an arranger, working primarily in musical theatre. I was the arranger for the vocal selections of Spamalot, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Brooklyn, Jersey Boys, The Drowsy Chaperone, Grey Gardens, The Color Purple, The Pirate Queen, Young Frankenstein, The Little Mermaid, Passing Strange, Legally Blonde, Memphis, 9 to 5, Women on the Verge…, People in the Picture, Newsies, Ghost, A Christmas Story, NOW.HERE.THIS among others. The newest project for Hal Leonard is The Broadway Singer’s Edition which are new, exhaustively researched editions of shows along with a piano performance CD. The first batch of shows is Les Miserables, Rent, Sound of Music, Wicked and Annie.\n\n•\n\n• • •\n\n• •\n\nOther professional work Principal arranger for Gateway Men’s Chorus, Men Alive (Orange County), The Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington D.C.

Song Analysis as a Key to Interpretation. Neal Richardson, Webster University Conservatory of Theatre Arts Teaching Duties 2\n\n• Freshman Intro to Musical Theatre, Fall (Musical theatre and actors are combined). In this class, we focus on learning the musical theatre literature from the 20s to today. It’s not so much a history class as a crash course in what musical theatre is, the most important composers and shows, the changing styles, and how to listen with better understanding. • Freshman Intro to Musical Theatre, Spring (Musical theatre and actors are combined) Introduction to singing on stage. • Sophomore, Fall (Musical theatre and actors are combined). Song study continued. • Sophomore, Spring (Musical theatre only). Advanced song study looking at more difficult literature such as Sondheim, Rock styles, music from the 20s and 30s, and preparing a role. • Junior, Fall (Musical theatre only) Scene study with Neal and a director, currently Tim Ocel • Junior, Spring (Musical theatre only) Neal and Lara teach audition and ensemble work with a large unit on the integration of song and dance. • Senior, Fall and Spring. These last two semesters are focused on Showcase, Senior cabaret, auditions and various other finishing touches.\n\n3\n\nIntroduction to Excavating the Song Excavating the Song is a multifaceted guide to modern musical theatre performance and repertoire. It is intended for the modern musical theatre singer. I believe it is a unique book. It is not an acting book, an audition book or a book about singing. Instead it is about all of these skills and about the ways that you can integrate your acting, your singing and auditioning skills as you reach your career goals. It is my hope that it will help you in many different ways to become more secure in your craft. This book is a companion to great new books for the serious musical theatre singer which I highly recommend. At the top of my list of recent must-reads are Acting in Musical Theatre: A Comprehensive Course (Routledge), Get the Callback: The Art of Auditioning for Musical Theatre (Scarecrow Press), The Enraged Accompanist's Guide to the Perfect Audition (Hal Leonard), Rock the Audition - How to Prepare for and Get Cast in Rock Musicals (Hal Leonard), and The New Broadway Song Companion (Scarecrow Press). Each of these books should be on your reading list. It’s my hope that you will keep this book with your audition book and refer to it when you are stuck or in need a bit of inspiration and encouragement. Put in your audition bag and peruse it as you’re waiting for an audition. Each topic discussed is presented in a way that can be easily read and digested in one sitting. The book contains many repertoire lists and reference guides that will help you find great songs that you don’t yet know. An Introduction to Song Performance Even if you dance beautifully and have strong acting skills, in musical theatre, in most cases, the skill that will make you stand out more than anything else is your ability to sing a song honestly, with a strong objective and other, with a clearly devised and actable situation and sing it well. If you can do that and make us believe the song is being created by you in the moment, you can create a bit of magic in a small, poorly lit audition room. Of course, it doesn't guarantee you will get cast, but it will go a long way toward getting you in the \"Yes pile\" more often. Your dancing and acting skills matter a great deal, but being able to sing a song with these attributes is the secret that will help you more than anything. The exercises discussed in Excavating the Song were created to provide a structure and process to insure that you leave no stone uncovered when you sing a song. It is more than a worksheet or a \"by the numbers\" process, but instead, it is a tour guide to the work that can be accomplished when studying these great songs. The word, excavating, connotes the image of an archeologist digging deeply into their chosen subject while being curious and scientific about her work. As singers, it is too easy to think of a great performance as something mysterious and illusive. It is too easy to think of a great performance you admire as something like alchemy. Like magic. It is not. It can be understood and achieved with practice, time, and thoughtful consideration.\n\n4\n\nI begin using some of the ideas in this book when I started teaching musical theater over 20 years ago. I would notice that often I would see strong acting in scenes from actors who could sing well. But when called upon to sing, the character, which the actor had presented in a clear and truthful manner, disappeared once the singing started. The quality that is so special and unique in musicals is that you can have something highly realistic combined the something that can't be quite explained with mere words––music. When someone sings in the middle of a scene, something special happens. The audience is allowed inside the character's mind and we are privy to a life that goes beyond words. Songs can go deeper than words because music allows a character to express things that he would not say aloud. Much of what I discuss when preparing a song is influenced and inspired by David Craig's \"On Singing Onstage,\" published in 1978. This important book was the first to explore what it means to sing a song in a theatrical context. I have tried to clarify, simplify and update his work to aid in mastery. There is a progression to the steps with one step building off of what has been gained earlier. I wanted to take a moment to talk about the word in the title––excavate. We can use the image of the pyramid when talking about great works of art to connote and suggest that it takes a great deal of effort and time to build, step-by-step, block-by-block something significant and lasting. In the process discussed in this book, we are looking at the building blocks of creating a meaningful and significant song performance. But stepping back for a moment, now think of the song itself as the pyramid––as something that a composer and lyricist worked very hard to get just right. Most likely, the lyric has rhyme, has a syntax that strikes a balance between prose and poetry, and has meanings and associations that go beyond the surface of the words. In addition, the composer has crafted a melody and harmonic framework that supports the lyric and helps to make its point even more clearly. Good songs and especially good theater songs are more than just nice tunes. They support the allimportant lyric while providing a structure that the audience can take in and make sense of. These songs deserve, even demand, to be excavated thoroughly. Excavating the Song: A Guide to Repertoire Considering the vast numbers of Broadway and Off-Broadway musicals not to mention theatrical songs from un-produced or unfinished works, knowing the repertoire can be overwhelming. Finding the right song for the right situation is daunting. In my work on the faculty of Webster University for the past fifteen years, I’ve made discovering great under-sung songs a high priority as well as matching songs from this literature with the singer. This book will help everyone, no matter their voice type or character type, to find songs that suit them and get them noticed. What Does It Take? We all have favorite singers—ones who inspired us and helped us to decide to follow the dream of musical theatre. Some of your favorites may include Judy Garland, Idina Menzel, Sutton 5\n\nFoster, Liz Callaway, Audra McDonald, Alfred Drake, Marc Kudisch, Brian Stokes Mitchell or Gavin Creel. These singing actors are unquestionably great, but what makes their performances so compelling? Is it simply their voices? Their acting skills? Their personality? Or is it combination of these? And what do they have in common? Did they attend one of the great musical theatre training institutions? Do they share similar interpretative styles? Did they coach with great acting coaches? Each of their journeys to greatness was different and so was their training. Your path will be your own as well. You may say, “I am a good singer and a good actor, what else do I need except the chance for a breakthrough role?” You may have many skills in your back pocket but there are probably still some things you have difficulty with. You may struggle with do with your hands when you sing, or where your focus should be, or difficulty in auditions. The resource you hold in your hand will address these things and many others. There is a great chance that some of the things discussed here will be things you already know well. There may be, however, other things that will inspire an “ah-ha” moment. Some things may frustrate you. Some things may thrill you. Some things may bore you and some things may just be the break-through you need in your performance. I encourage you to engage with the tasks detailed here and give them a chance to work. Without a doubt, the skills required of the modern singing actor pose an enormous challenge. The objective of this resource is to simplify and clearly articulate some of the tasks you will be doing on a daily basis during your career. Throughout the book, there will be a need for the reader to do dig up a recording of the song being discussed. Nowadays, people generally go to YouTube if they don’t have the cast album. Take the time to find the song and listen to it. Rules or Guidelines? Do we need rules for something as ephemeral and specialized as singing a song on stage? Judy Garland breaks many of the so-called rules. Does that mean she’s not a good performer? Of course not. The guidelines here will simply give you a starting point from which you can employ your unique creative gifts. Let me restate that, it is a starting point only. Some of the activities in this resource may not work for every singing or acting opportunity, but, as the saying goes, you can’t break the rules unless you know what rules you’re breaking. If you go into each singing opportunity without a process, you’ll be reinventing the wheel with each song. In your career you will be asked to sing many different kinds of songs. Some of these songs will be classics. Some will be clunkers. Some songs you will “get” immediately and some may have\n\n6\n\nyou throwing up your hands in despair. With these resources however, you will have tools in your tool chest to tackle many issues you will face. Three Things There are three things that make up a great performance of a song: singing , acting (including physicality) and musicality. Singing pertains to the vocal sound and may include things such as vocal color, pitch and breath support. When we speak of acting in a song, as opposed to acting in a straight play, we mean things like, does the singer communicate the story of the song clearly, do they inhabit the physical life of the character, and is there a connection between singer and material? Without question, singing a theatrical song is complicated by adding the subjective, sensuous element of music. Musical theatre acting isn’t exactly naturalistic. And yet, in the today’s productions of new shows and in revivals of classics, naturalism, or maybe more specifically, realism, is the style of our time. Audiences today want “real.” If it’s not real then it’s fake. If it’s fake, the audience tunes out. But naturalism and musical theatre aren’t exactly compatible. The scale of musical theatre is much bigger than our daily lives, not to mention that there is an orchestra accompanying us as we sing about the things we want from life on stage. I do believe, however, that realism and musical theatre are a perfect match. The humanity, the warmth, the pure emotion of music is directly related to the kinds of things we think, feel and do on a daily basis. The third element, musicality, is one that is oftentimes the scariest for singers. You may struggle with learning music or you may know that you are not taping into a song’s full potential. The most exciting singers are the ones who can take what the composer and lyricist have given them a make it extra-special. A part of this intangible quality is musicality. If we were suddenly unable to see your performance, would we still be able to understand the moments from what we were hearing? A great performance is more than correct notes and rhythm. Sometimes singing the correct notes and rhythm lacks musicality. This may seem like a paradox. Music notation is highly imprecise and it takes a great deal of sensitivity and study to sing stylistically. The Challenge There is no other kind of singer working today that has more asked of them than the musical theatre singer. You are asked to belt, asked to sing so-called legit, asked to sing pop and rock, asked to sing in jazz styles, and asked to sing in a style that can only be called the Golden Age musical theatre style, something that is an amalgamation of many styles. You are also asked to do the work of an actor: to be “in the moment”, to pursue objectives, and to embody the life of your character. This is a Herculean task and I haven’t even mentioned dancing! The objective of this book is to help the singing actor become more confident in their work and to dig deeper into a song. Its aim is no less than to help you truly excavate all the amazing things that are waiting for you and your audience. You are on your way to greatness!\n\n7\n\nHelpful Tools As you read this book I would encourage you to keep a journal of your thoughts about exercises and questions you might have. You might be able to answer them yourself in time. A computer or smart phone will also be helpful as you will want to listen to examples I will discuss. Many things are on YouTube but I will help you find them if they aren’t.\n\n8\n\nContents!\n\n11\n\nImprove these chapter titles!\n\n11\n\nIntroduction!\n\n11\n\nActing the Song!\n\n11\n\nAn Introduction to Song Study!\n\n11\n\nA Guide to Preparing Your First Song!\n\n11\n\nGuidelines for Different Types of Songs!\n\n11\n\nCreating Situations!\n\n11\n\nQualities of a Great Musical Theatre Performance!11 Cabaret Styles!\n\n11\n\nPost-millennium Style!\n\n11\n\nMusical and Vocal Considerations!\n\n11\n\nExpectations of Modern Musical Theatre Singers! 11 Musical Theatre Singers to Know!\n\n11\n\nLearning Songs!\n\n11\n\nMusical Terms to Know!\n\n11\n\nVocal Colors!\n\n11\n\nRiffing!\n\n11 9\n\nImportant Musical Terms!\n\n11\n\nAnalyzing Songs!\n\n11\n\nOther Musical Considerations!\n\n11\n\nCritical Listening!\n\n11\n\nLearning from other singers!\n\n11\n\nMemorizing Songs!\n\n11\n\nMusical Style through History!\n\n11\n\nChoosing Songs!\n\n11\n\nCreating your Audition book!\n\n11\n\nInclude topics from Creating the perfect audition book! 11 Audition Book Song Categories!\n\n11\n\nChoosing Audition Songs!\n\n12\n\nChoosing Songs for Cabaret !\n\n12\n\nPost-millennium Composers!\n\n12\n\nGuide to Repertoire!\n\n12\n\nRepertoire Lists!\n\n12\n\nThe Perfect Audition Book!\n\n12\n\nGlossary!\n\n12 10\n\nBibliography!\n\n12\n\nAcknowledgements ! 12\n\n...................!\n\nA Guide to Preparing Your First Song!\n\n29\n\nExpectations of Modern Musical Theatre Singers!\n\n68\n\nContents Improve these chapter titles Introduction Acting the Song An Introduction to Song Study ....................................................

Do a YouTube search for \"Kate Baldwin\" and \"I Don't Need a Roof.\" As you watched, what did you notice? Did you notice the subtle ways that she colored important words and that there was a clear journey from beginning to end? Did you notice how she's fighting to convince her husband that things will be alright and the way she didn't give into the sad emotion of the situation? Did you notice the way her physicality communicated subtext? What else did you see? I have been fortunate to see her in four great lead performances in four wildly differing productions. Kathy in The Last Five Years at The Repertory Theatre of St. Louis, Babe in The Pajama Game at The Muny, Sharon in Finian’s Rainbow on Broadway and Big Fish. From a small black box theatre in St. Louis to an 11,000 seat outdoor auditorium to the finest Broadway houses, Kate Baldwin has truly shown in every production. As someone who lives for great performances, I have to ask myself if her performances were great because she’s beautiful and sings magnificently, regardless of whether she’s belting or singing legit soprano. While these characteristics are notable, what makes her performances so compelling is that she completely lives in her character while giving her songs shape and variety while utilizing vocal colors that communicate the inner meaning of what’s she’s thinking and feeling. We could do this exercise with any number of great performances but I wanted to start with a single, clear example of the things I will be discussing. Kate Baldwin did not read this book nor do I know her process, but I do know that she is doing all the things that this moment in Big Fish needs. We could be blown away and left speechless by the skill that she brings to her work or we can learn from it. I believe the craft of theatrical singing can be broken down for examination and that songs can be excavated for deeper meanings. My goal is to help you do that for yourself when you sing onstage. Nearly every written or taught system of acting theatrical songs is Stanislawski-based, asking who, what, when, where and why questions. Based on twenty years of research and teaching, the system I’ve devised is a method of sorting through the many things that should be considered when you prepare a song for performance. You may already be doing many of the things I'm asking you to do, but by following these guidelines, you will have thoroughly excavated the song and left no questions unanswered. There may be some activities that are new and might be strange to you, but I guarantee that they will pay off. First, we want to ask questions about the text. We want to know who the singer is, where they are, what they're doing and who they are singing to. It's very important to start with this text work first so that we don't allow the sensuous nature of music to cloud critical questions. We\n\n13\n\nmust start with the text, making thoughtfully considered decisions based on our insight, intuition and instincts. Next, we want to look at the song as a monologue, separate from its music. At this point, the music is disregarded and we can rehearse and explore the monologue as we would if it were from a straight play. The most important piece of the puzzle is understanding our objective, which we will discover by asking, “What am I really saying?” “What am I doing to my partner?” “Why do I need to do it?” and “What do I need to accomplish by saying these words?” We will also want to pay special attention to the physicality that we bring to the monologue. Pursuing an objective will cause the body to move and move in a manner that is congruent with the text being communicated. If you give yourself over completely to pursuing your objective, you won't be bothered with the common nagging question, \"What do I do with my hands?\" Before we perform the song, we will do some preliminary work with the music in order to pay special attention to phrasing, musical inflection and pacing. This is a specialized part of the process that is not often written about or discussed. Phrasing comes quite naturally to some people, while for other people it is more of a challenge. But phrasing is not mysterious. It is something that can be learned with practice. It is only at this point that we are ready to sing the song. Before we move on, it's important to mention that while some songs will suit you well, others will not. This is a fact that we cannot change and one that has nothing to do with talent. I like to use this image with my students. Imagine that you’ve visited a department store to pick out a suit or a dress for an important event. You go to the racks and pick out what you think will look best, but it is only after trying on the clothes that you can tell which one looks best on you. It is the same with songs. Give songs a period of time to settle before you sing them for an audition or you choose to discard them. Later in the book, I will give you a broad survey of song literature from the 1900s to today, theatrical and non-theatrical, in order to help you choose the perfect song for every occasion. Excavating The Song Process In the followings pages, the Excavating the Song Process will walk you through a song and guide you with selected activities and questions. 1. Write the lyrics in prose form, carefully observing punctuation marks. Song title: Dancing Through Life Composer/Lyricist: Stephen Schwartz Show Title: Wicked\n\n14\n\nThe trouble with school is they always try to teach the wrong lesson. Believe me, I’ve been kicked out of enough to them to know. They want you to become less callow, less shallow, but I say, “Why invite stress in? Stop studying strife and learn to live the unexamined life’”… Dancing through life, skimming the surface, gliding where turf is smooth. Life’s more painless for the brainless. Why think too hard when it’s so soothing? Dancing through life? No need to tough it when you can slough it off as I do. Nothing matters, but knowing nothing matters. It’s just life so keep dancing through… Dancing through life, swaying and sweeping, and always keeping cool. Life is fraughtless when you’re thoughtless. Those who don’t try never look foolish… Dancing through life…Mindless and careless, make sure you’re where less trouble is rife… Woes are fleeting, blows are glancing…when you’re dancing through life… Let’s go down to the Ozdust Ballroom. We’ll meet there later tonight. We can dance till it’s light. Find the prettiest girl…Give ‘er a whirl right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom–Come on follow me, you’ll be happy to be there…Dancing through life, down at the Ozdust, if only because dust is what we come to… Nothing matters but knowing nothing matters. It’s just life so keep dancing through. 2. What are the facts of the song? In other words, looking only at the lyrics without adding your interpretation, what can we deduce about the character and situation? This can be called the objective interpretation. It’s about a guy who thinks that life shouldn’t taken too seriously and that just having fun is the best way to live. 3. Once we have deduced the facts of the song, now begin thinking about your interpretation of the song by answering the following questions. This will will lead you to your subjective interpretation of the song. A. Who is the Singer? Describe your idea of the character using specific and precise statements. He’s not very bright. He is afraid of not succeeding. He is good-looking. For him, success is having the best time with the prettiest girl. Underneath his exterior, he’s insecure. B. Who are you singing to? Choose a person or persons that will create interest and conflict. I am singing to the prettiest girl in my class, Samantha, who also happens to the best student in school. C. When is it? At the end of last period. I’ve just seen her talking and flirting with my biggest rival, Roger. D. Where are you? The more specific your location, the more real it will be for you. Outside the library–she was flirting with Roger in the library just before this. E. Why do you need to say these words? The stronger the need, the better. I’ve just broken up with my girlfriend and the prom is this weekend. The idea of not going to the prom is unthinkable and if I don’t go, I’ll consider myself a failure. So will all my friends. F. What changes during the song? I’m able to convince her to go with me.\n\n15\n\nG. What do you want? What will happen if you don’t get it? I want her to say yes. If I don’t get it, my status as the most popular guy in school will be lost. That is the most important thing to me and the thing that my self-worth is based on. H. Why sing this song now and not yesterday or tomorrow? My girlfriend just broke up with me. I can’t wait until tomorrow because she might go to the prom with Roger.\n\nWrite a defining sentence. This sentence will be, in essence, a shorthand for the actor’s journey through the song. This is a song about a boy (a girl, a man, Dr. Monroe) who _______________________. These words should sum up in a concise sentence or two your version of what happens during the song and what your objective is. Note that this sentence may include both the objective observations about the lyric and your subjective interpretation. This is a song about Frank, me, who needs to hold on to his status as the coolest guy in school. I must convince Samantha to go with me to the prom or risk losing that status. Notice how different this sentence is from the one above: “It’s about a guy who thinks that life shouldn’t taken too seriously and that just having fun is the best way to live.” This is the difference between objective and subjective interpretation. Songs Arcs Now that the objective of the song has been explored, it’s time to get more specific with the song’s moments. All novels, short stories, plays and films have an arc. Think of your song as a 3 minute one-act play that has been thought through from beginning to end so that the conclusion is satisfying. There are four possible arcs: • • • •\n\nThe winning arc The losing arc The “ending up where you started” arc or spiral arc1 The serendipity arc - ending in a place you hadn’t anticipated.\n\n1. Winning Arc A winning arc is the most common shape. The song ends with your character achieving their objective and getting what they’ve been fighting for. But, as in life, nothing is easy and there are many obstacles you must face. Perhaps your other doesn’t want to hear what you are saying and you have to fight to get their attention. Or perhaps they don’t believe what you are saying and begin to walk away. Romantic comedies films share this story arc. In this kind of film, the couple has things that they must work through to be together—former boyfriends, a job that requires them to relocate or a complication with their sex life. Overcoming these obstacles gives the film 1\n\nJoe Deer Acting in Musical Theatre: A Comprehensive Course\n\n16\n\nshape and makes of a satisfying conclusion. There are moments of loss but in the end, there is triumph.\n\n2. Losing Arc The losing arc is like the winning arc, only inverted. There is a final losing moment but there are also some wins before that. One of my favorite examples of a losing arc song is “Good Thing Going” from Merrily We Roll Along. The lyric ends with “We had a good thing going, going gone.” But the ending is a bit of a surprise because throughout the song, the relationship has been described in mostly positive terms. “It started out like a song,/We started quiet and slow with no surprise./And then one morning I woke to realize:/We had a good thing going.”\n\n17\n\n3. Spiral Arc In the spiral arc, we end at the same place we began. The Wizard of Oz is the clearest cinematic example of this. It starts at home and ends at home. But the journey is quite an adventure and we go many places before we arrive back where we started. I see this as a sort of variation on the winning arc if the beginning place is a positive one. But if the song calls for it, the beginning and ending could be a place of struggle, making it a losing arc. The middle sections need to be the opposite of the beginning and ending. You will need to find a maximum number of contrasts to successfully achieve this story arc.\n\n4. Serendipity Arc This final story arc is rare but can be powerful. There is a logical, predictable beginning and middle but the ending is a complete surprise. This is a variation on the winning or losing arc depending on the ending direction.\n\n18\n\nFurther Exploration: “I’m Not Afraid” from Songs For a New World is a unique song in that all four types of arcs are possible. Explore these questions: •For a winning arc, what are the obstacles, how do you overcome them and what is the nature of the victory at the end? •For a losing arc, what do you lose at the end and what are the wins before that? •For a spiral arc, what is the beginning and ending place? Where do you go in the middle? •For a serendipity arc, what is the ending surprise? Where do you start and what does the middle look like? Let’s move to a different song, one with a losing arc and get more specific. “I Had a Dream About You” from Maury Yeston’s December Songs. I had a dream about you, we were together again as we had always been. It was the happiest dream I think I ever have had that you and I’ve been in. It was a dream I don’t need to explain. We’re in the care and We’re driving in Maine. It’s so incredibly beautiful I don’t know where to begin. We’re driving into the night and from a magical height we see two orange moons, they’re hangin’ up in the sky like a pair of contented balloons. And as we stare into space in astonishment, I turn to look at your face and you kiss me… All in an instant inside of a wonderful dream. Oh, I remember two orange moons rise in the sky to sound of loons and you were there, my dream. I had a dream about you, we were together again, an old familiar pair. It was the kind of a dream so absolutely convincing you believe you’re there. The open road and the dotted white lines, the crispy smell in the air of the pines, the overwhelming sensation you’re up and awake everywhere… And when we look in the sky, they’re getting higher and higher, those two orange 19\n\nmoons. There’s one for you and for me and, impossibly, both of them gleam. And I am holding your hand for eternity and you’re beginning to say that you love me. If only it really had happened, if only it all really happened. I had a dream about you but, of course i t was only a dream…It was only a dream…It was only a dream…I had a dream about you but, of course, it was only a dream. What are the facts of the song? It’s about a women relating her dream to her former partner. It starts nicely but by the end, she knows that this dream is not reality. Who is the singer? Describe the character using definite statements. She is 28 years old and works in a bookstore that she owns. She’s very intellectual but has difficulty in staying in a relationship. Who are you singing to? Choose a person or person that will create interest and conflict. I am singing to my boyfriend, Frank. We broke-up over our disagreements about having a child. He wanted a child. I am not ready. When is it? It’s 11:00 AM. Where are you? We’ve run into each other unexpectedly at Starbucks. It’s like it was ordained by the stars! Why do you need to say these words? The stronger the need, the better. I’ve just come from my therapist where we were talking about my relationship with Frank. We did not, however, talk about the dream because we ran out of time. The dream has been going through my mind constantly though. I’ve been trying to figure out what the two moons in the song mean. When I see him, I can’t help myself. I’m so happy to see him and without thinking about the wisdom of it, I start into my dream. What changes during the song? I finally hits me for the first time that there is no chance for us. I see from his reaction, that he wants to desperately leave. As I tell him the dream, I can see how uncomfortable he is. He was never a fan of fact that I was so into my head. The meaning of “of course, it was only a dream” changes during the song. The first time I say it, I’m trying to make fun of myself and make light of the fact that I’m “in my head” again. By the end of the song, it’s as if I’m waking from the dream of us ever being together. What do you want? What will happen if you don’t get it? I’m 28. I’m not ready to have a child but I am more than ready to have my “one great love.” I thought Frank was it. I thought we could work through our issues with children. I’ve placed everything, my hope for security, my dreams for a house and financial security on Frank. If I 20\n\ndon’t win Frank back, and this is my last chance, I will work in the bookstore all my life and never fulfill my dreams of becoming a writer. Why sing this song now? We are here together unexpectedly and must tell him how I feel quickly because I have to get back to the store. Write your defining sentence. These words should sum up in a concise sentence or two your version of what happens during the song and what your objective is. Note that this sentence may include both the objective observations about the lyric and your subjective interpretation. This is a story about me, Janice, who needs to seize this opportunity to win back the man I love in order to achieve the security I am lacking. Basis Structural Music Analysis An examination of the song’s musical structure will help you complete your work. Look for verse and refrain in songs before 1970 and for verse, chorus and bridge in songs after 1970. There is more about musical form in the next chapter. Also look for repeated musical sections. Below are some additional guidelines for structural analysis that will help in breaking down the song into beats. These places usually mark beat changes. 1. The change from verse to refrain. 2. The change between sections (i.e. from A to B or from B back to A). Most standards and Golden Era musical theatre begin with a verse preceding the refrain. In the refrain, there are often at least four sections of music (i.e. A, B and possible C sections). In pop/rock inflected musical theatre, this terminology is changed to Verse, Chorus and Bridge with the most common form being Verse/Chorus/Verse/Chorus with a possible Bridge someplace. 3. Changes in tempo 4. Changes in style 5. Changes in accompaniment Read the lyric again and mark places that seem like appropriate beat changes. You will also want to take musical structure and changes into consideration. The form of this song is unusual: AABAAC. The Song Broken Down into Beats Having looked at the song structurally, let’s break it down into beats.\n\n21\n\nI had a dream about you, we were together again as we had always been. It was the happiest dream I think I ever have had that you and I’ve been in. It was a dream I don’t need to explain. We’re in the car and we’re driving in Maine. It’s so incredibly beautiful I don’t know where to begin.\n\nThe first A section, rolling accompaniment. She begins telling a story, a nice story about her dream. She awakens him in order to get his attention. She is successful.\n\nWe’re driving into the night and from a magical height we see two orange moons, they’re hangin’ up in the sky like a pair of contented balloons. And as we stare into space in astonishment, I turn to look at your face and you kiss me… All in an instant inside of a wonderful dream.\n\nThe second A section. Same accompaniment. The dream gets stranger with the image of two moons but concludes with a kiss. She seduces him with this exotic story in order that he will find her charming and kiss her. In the dream he kisses her but in actuality, he does not. She is unsuccessful.\n\nOh, I remember two orange moons rise in the sky to sound of loons and you were there, my dream.\n\nB section, the accompaniment changes. No new dramatic information. She is reminding him of the image of the two moons. She worries that she is losing his attention so she pulls him by reminding him that this is a magical dream with two moons, one that represents her and one that represents him. She is successful in the objective which heartens her, propelling the song to a higher key.\n\nI had a dream about you, we were together again, an old familiar pair. It was the kind of a dream so absolutely convincing you believe you’re there. The open road and the dotted white lines, the crispy smell in the air of the pines, the overwhelming sensation you’re up and awake everywhere… And when we look in the sky, they’re getting higher and higher, those two orange moons. There’s one for you and for me and, impossibly, both of them gleam. And I am holding your hand for eternity and you’re beginning to say that you love me.\n\nKey change! Back to the accompaniment of the A sections. The situation intensifies with the key change. With the key change, her objective is to encourage him to kiss her and tell her that he will love her forever. She is unsuccessful in this objective.\n\n22\n\nIf only it really had happened, if only it all really happened. I had a dream about you but, of course it was only a dream…It was only a dream…It was only a dream…I had a dream about you but, of course, it was only a dream.\n\nNew musical material. She realizes for the first time that they will never be together and this is less of a dream and more of a nightmare, the repeated “It was only a dream” is as if the singer is waking up to the reality of the doomed relationship. She ends up in a place she didn’t know she would end up. This is not what she expected. She realizes that she will never get what she wants from him. She convinces him to say that everything will be okay. She is unsuccessful.\n\nAvoiding Traps Every song has a trap—something that must be avoided when you rehearse the song so that it is successful. The key to avoiding traps is to answer this question: What is the most obvious interpretation of the song? The most obvious things are to be avoided. Your audience is smart and you need to stay well ahead of them. The danger in singing a losing arc song such as “I Had a Dream About You” is to play the losses from the very beginning. The actor, who knows how the song will end, needs to be careful not to give the ending away. The character doesn’t know how it will end. Playing the end of the song from the beginning is the trap of this song. It is your job to identify the trap of the song and not fall into it. “Good Thing Going”, as discussed earlier has a similar trap. In the song, the singer speaks of all the good things that were part of their lives together. He tempers it with some clarifications that not everything was perfect. It is not until the very last word of the song, “going, going, gone,” that the singer must face the truth of the end of the relationship. If you play the end of the relationship at the beginning of the song, there is no arc, only a straight line. Actions For each beat, I ask you to choose an action verb that will give shape to your physicality for that beat. Choose verbs that are actable that will inspire your body to move. Below you will find a list of well-chosen verbs that work. You can begin by thinking about what you are doing to you partner. Are you lifting them or pushing them down? Are you reaching out to them or drawing them to you? There are four broad categories of action verbs in two pairs of opposing categories: helping verbs vs. hurting verbs and reaching verbs vs. gathering verbs.\n\n23\n\nHelping verbs to uplift to build to excite to support to overwhelm to celebrate to paint\n\nHurting verbs to destroy to crush to bombard to mock to annihilate to belittle to punish to suppress\n\nReaching verbs to share to open to push to reassure to encourage to convince to overwhelm to inspire\n\nGathering verbs to invite to welcome to seduce to pull to caress to charm to prepare\n\nUse a thesaurus to help you find others. Actions: The Actor’s Thesaurus by Marina Caldarone and Maggie Lloyd-Williams is an especially good resource. Choose words that can be physicalized easily. Remember, these are things that you are doing to achieve your objective. Most of the time, your actions will be on your unseen scene parter, your other. You are mocking them, or reassuring them or caressing them. But you may also choose actions that you are performing to affect your partner. You could paint a picture of what your life will be together or you could build a world that you two could share or you annihilate the obstacle that stands in your way. Song as Monologue Here are the steps to explore when looking at the song as a monologue. The pianist is not brought into the work until step 5. I’ve created a pneumonic device that will help you remember these steps and their order. The Six Components of Preparing a Song E-Energized speech X-EXplore objectives through movement CAV-Combine action and verse A-Act. True monologue T-Tune. Accuracy of phrasing E-Elevate your performance. Everything combined 1. Energized speech. Using a high level of vocal energy, speak the words without inflection with speed so that the words form on your tongue without stops and starts. The purpose of this is to aid in memorizing and getting the words securely into your muscle memory. Do this until you can do it without any hesitation. Do not do this, however, so quickly that the words have no meaning or can’t be understood.\n\n24\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\nAdditional activities: A. You may also choose to speak the lyrics as a dramatic recitation, savoring the images and biting into the words as you might bite into an apple. Imagine that you’ve written the lyrics and are reading them at a poetry reading. Savor every image, rhyme and alliteration. B. Locate the images in your song. As you do the monologue, physicalize the images such as love, heaven or fear. At this point, it’s preferable that you go too far in indicating the images. This will help you to see the images in later steps. In other places in the book, I discuss the pros and cons of indicating in a song. Don’t worry about that for now. EXplore objectives through movement. Physicalize the active verbs in each beat hearing the lyrics in your head but without speaking them. Once a section is finished, move on to the next verb. If it will be helpful, have a friend hold up cue cards with that verb written on it to remind you. Start in a neutral position (focus forward Center, weight on both feet and arms to your side) by saying to yourself the defining sentence. Then when you see the inciting event, begin to hear the monologue in your head while employing complete physical involvement. Don't plan what you are going to do. Let it be spontaneous. Combine action and verse. Physicalize the monologue while saying the lyrics. Start in a neutral position (focus forward, Center, weight on both feet and arms to your side) by saying to yourself the defining sentence. When you see the inciting event, begin to speak the monologue with complete physical involvement. This is not a verbal exercise, it is physical. Whisper or shout if you need to. Get down on the floor or stand on a chair if it is appropriate. The lyrics are of secondary importance to the physical life. Be sure to make a clear distinction between each action. To check this, have a friend watch and then list the actions that they saw you do. If they don’t tell you the correct actions, that means that you can be more specific with them. Act. Next, speak the monologue keeping in mind the active verbs you assigned to each beat. The words to the monologue become more important than in the previous exercise but allow your body to respond to the action of the monologue. You may use the cue cards again. Keep your focus forward, center and on your partner. Have a friend stand in for you scene partner if you find that helpful. Do an improvisation with a friend standing in for the scene partner to clearly establish the moment before. Tune. Having the pianist only play chords or a simple, out of tempo, accompaniment, sing the song repeating step 4. Take the same pauses you would take while doing the monologue. You are doing the same monologue but simply adding pitch. This is a excellent way to work on phrasing and pacing. The goal of this activity is to take full possession of the song and make it yours. The music in songs can have the tendency to take over the story-telling. You must avoid this at all costs. Songs are stories. Elevate your performance. Next, have the pianist play the actual accompaniment as you sing the song. Physicalize each moment to the degree you feel is appropriate. Do not allow the accompaniment to make your work less specific. 25\n\nFurther Exploration: Watch the videos on the DVD that demonstrates each step. Choose a song in your repertoire and apply the six steps. It’s important that each activity is secure before moving on to the next. When you get to step 4 or 5, I suggest returning to earlier activities to refresh your work. It’s likely that they will be stronger now.\n\nMoment Before I’ve mentioned repeating the defining sentence before beginning each activity. Repeating the defining sentence before you begin is an efficient way to remind you of the objective of the song and its arc. Once you have done that, there is another step before you begin singing, seeing the moment before. The moment before consists of three steps: 1. Seeing the event (what do you see?) 2. Taking it in (what effect does it have on you?) 3. Responding to it (what is your response?) In “I Had a Dream About You,” the inciting event is the surprise of seeing Frank at Starbucks. Janice has been “in her head” after coming from the therapists office. She is still trying to put all the pieces together and she’s distracted. She sees Frank. She’s surprised and happy. Take this moment in. Respond to it. This response is called the active first beat and this is the moment when the pianist begins playing the introduction. In this song, the introduction is short but you’ll need to fill this moment with an action. You must always remember to give some consideration to the introduction of a song and the ride-out. The ride-out is the music after you complete your last note. The first verb in our analysis is “to awaken.” You are awakening Frank during the first chunk of the lyrics but possibly the introduction is you awakening from the haze you’ve been in. I find that doing an improvisation with fellow actor helps tremendously to make this active first beat more solid. Choose a partner and explain the situation, giving them an idea of what you need for them to do. Play the scene before the song begins. At the appropriate time, the pianist starts the introduction and the scene partner can stay in the scene. Your focus is on them but, just as a gentle reminder, we don’t always look at the person we’re talking to. Your focus, however, is still on them. Once the moment before is secure and you are confident in knowing what this moment is, repeat the exercise without the scene partner. Further Exploration: Choose a love song such as a standard ballad that is open to many types of interpretations. Do the activities such as locating beat changes, assigning actions to each beat and deciding on the three elements of the moment before. “You’re Nearer” or “Our Love is Here to Stay” are good choices.\n\n26\n\nSing the song given these three following contrasting situations and compare the results. Song: “Love is Here to Stay” by George and Ira Gershwin Situation #1. I’m going away on a work assignment for 9 months and we won’t be able to see each other during that time. The objective is convince my wife of 5 years that things will be okay and our relationship will stay secure while I’m gone. Suggested actions: to reassure, to paint, to caress, to pull, to uplift. Situation #2. My wife has given me hints that she’s going to end the relationship. The objective is heal over any of the problems that we have and convince her that our relationship is meant to last. Suggested actions: to reassure, to crush, to celebrate, to open, to pull. Situation #3. My fiancé and are having dinner in our favorite restaurant and this is a proposal. My objective is to convince her that our love can withstand any problem that we face. Suggested actions: to prepare, to caress, to pull, to paint, to celebrate. “Love is Here to Stay” The more I read the papers the less I comprehend (Action 1) The world with all its capers and how it all will end. Nothing seems to be lasting. But that isn't our affair; We've got something permanent, I mean in the way we care. It's very clear our love is here to stay; (Action 2) Not for a year but ever and a day. The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know (Action 3) May just be passing fancies, and in time may go. But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay; (Action 4) Together we're going a long, long way. In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble, (Action 5) They're only made of clay, but our love is here to stay. How did singing the song with these three differing situations change the vocal colors? The tempo? The stakes? The transitions? Conclusion This process will help you to find your unique interpretation of a theatrical song taken out of context. The process may seem long and arduous, but you will see the benefits in your work because it will help you to personalize the material and to dig deeply into the emotional life of the song. The more you apply this process to the songs you sing, the faster it will go. You will discover that you will need to adjust your process with other songs in other contexts such as: • Preparing a song for a role in a full musical • Preparing songs that were not intended to be theatrical, such as pop songs 27\n\n• For a cabaret setting or similar situation where you are singing as yourself You will find worksheets for these other situations in the following pages. Consider this process as a basic tool–a foundation to build your pyramid on. As you grow in your artistry, you will develop other tools that you will find helpful and develop your own process.\n\n28\n\nA Guide to Preparing Your First Song Nearly every song you sing has been sung by countless other performers. You may wonder how you can bring something new to the song or how you can make your interpretation of the song unique and interesting. The Excavating the Song process was created in response to these questions. Your interpretation of any song begins with a thorough understanding of the music and lyrics as well as how these two are interrelated. A nuanced, original and specific final performance is dependent on careful analysis, study and making smart, well-reasoned choices. Here are some things to consider when learning a new song. Lyric 1. What are your first impressions of the lyric? What does it say to you and does it touch on your life experience somehow? 2. What is the story of the song? What is it about? 3. Write out the lyric in prose form in longhand. Underline rhyming words. Are the rhyming words somehow significant? Look for internal rhyme by speaking the lyric aloud. 4. Observe the punctuation. How will the punctuation affect your phrasing? 5. Are there any words or images in the lyric that you don’t understand? Look those up. 6. What are the important images in the lyric? How do they help illustrate and enrich the song? Music It is assumed that you know the music and can sing the correct pitches and rhythms before you do this section. 1. Observe the musical indications such as tempo markings, style indications, dynamics, crescendo/decrescendo, etc. How do these things support the song and help to communicate the lyric? Look up any words you do not know. 2. How does the music tell the story of your song? Does it work with the lyric or somehow against the lyric? 3. What is the musical form? Is there something special that happens in the B section? Interpretation Although you may sing a song that many other people sing, you can bring your own interpretation to it by asking these questions. 1. How does this song reflect your personal experience? Trust that information and the unique subtext that that information gives you. 2. While we want to personalize songs so that it will appear to the listener that you are the character that is singing, they should not be sung as yourself. Instead, the character should be one you have created. But I encourage you to create a character that is similar to you in some ways.\n\n29\n\n3. Who is your character singing to? You may not be singing it to someone who is physically present. You must find a way to externalize your partner, even if you’re singing to yourself. In such cases, imagine that one part of yourself is singing to another part of yourself. Maybe your timid side is singing to your braver self. Or, perhaps your intellect is singing to your heart. 4. What do you want? What’s at stake? 5. Create a world in which your character exists and needs to say these words. Where are you? When is it? What are you wearing? These kinds of questions are invaluable. Come up with details that help make your situation more real and visceral to you. 6. What changes happen during the song? Musical Theatre songs are special moments in which a character undergoes some kind of change. As we are taking these songs out of context, you can decide what changes happen during your song. This is one of the ways that your interpretation will differ from others. Always begin by reading the lyric. No matter how much you like the music, a song is not a good choice for you if you do not connect meaningfully with the lyric. For this chapter I have chosen “Ev’ry Time We Say Goodbye” by Cole Porter. Essentially, the lyric is about the effect the other’s absence causes. While it is tempting to look at the lyric as a sad one and concentrate only on the negative aspects, I encourage you to always make an attempt to find the positive in every song. While a losing arc or a serendipity arc are possible for this song, a winning arc is nearly always preferable. The reason a standard from the first part of the 20th century is such a good starting point for song study is that the dramatic layout and form of the song is so clear. This particular song, like many other standard ballads, begins with a verse followed by a refrain with an ABAB form. The verse sets up the circumstances and conflict within the song and the refrain allows each performer a wide variety of variations on the basic story. Standards have a wonderful combination of specific action and story mixed with a certain openness to interpretation.\n\nEv’ry Time We Say Goodbye From Seven Lively Arts Music and Lyrics by Cole Porter Verse: We love each other so deeply / That I ask you this, sweetheart Why should we quarrel ever, / Why can't we be enough clever, Never to part?\n\n30\n\nRefrain: Ev'ry time we say goodbye / I die a little Ev'ry time we say goodbye / I wonder why a little Why the gods above me / Who must be in the know Think so little of me / They allow you to go When you're near / There's such an air of spring about it I can hear a lark somewhere / Begin to sing about it There's no love song finer, But how strange the change from major to minor Ev'ry time we say goodbye Ev'ry single time we say goodbye Context and Situation It is traditional to take classic American popular songs from the first half of the 20th century out of their show contexts, even when they were written for a stage musical. “Ev’ry Time We Say Goodbye” first appeared in Seven Lively Arts—an interesting musical revue that celebrated the art forms of music, theatre, ballet and painting. The context of this song in its original setting, while interesting, is of no real value to a modern audience. It will be much more interesting and valuable for you to create your own story. Of course, there will be opportunities when you will want to sing a song using the givens of the show that it is from, but for now, let’s be creative with the storytelling. Read the lyric carefully. Look for keywords and phrases. Also look for the song’s conflict. All great dramatic literature has conflict and that conflict is the fuel for a strong performance. Great lyrics are akin to poetry, and as such, they contain hidden treasures that you must discover through thoughtful excavation. Failure to excavate these treasures runs the risk of a performance lacking specificity and nuance. A few keywords or phrases in the verse are “love,” “deeply,” “sweetheart,” “quarrel,” “clever,” and “never to part.” It is useful to think about how the Verse/Refrain song form came about and how verses function in relationship to the refrain. A song beginning with a verse originates in early musical theatre as a way to transition seamlessly from dialogue into true song. Without the verse, the transition could be awkward or even laughable. We can understand the verse as having a characteristic more closely aligned with speech—more rhythmically free and less about melody and more about setting up the context for the refrain. In the following analysis, I make a clear differentiation between objective observations and subjective observations. The objective observations are based directly on meanings inherent in the words of the lyrics. The subjective observations are the ones you, the performer, make about a song. You must begin with the objective observations which are in black and white in the text. These are the ones that any singer coming to the material, no matter their stylistic differences will or should see. From the text, we can draw the conclusion that the singer has a significant 31\n\nlove for the other, enough to use the word “sweetheart.” But there is a conflict involving something that causes them to be separated. With this separation comes quarreling. The singer wishes that they could be smart enough, or clever enough, to find a way to not be separated. This is the objective observation. Next comes the subjective interpretation. Subjective Interpretation By the time you begin this step of the work, you should have written out the lyrics in longhand and taken note of the punctuation. Punctuation is especially important later when we choose where to take breaths. The commas in the verse after “this” and “clever” will be places that cry out for a slight pause (if not a full breath) before the next word. The act of writing the lyrics cannot be over emphasized. It is too easy to overlook details and slowing down to write the lyrics will force you to take a deeper look. Consider what questions remain that need to be answered and which answers will lead to a more satisfying performance. Think carefully about what is not in the lyric. What is left unstated between the lines? You may ask, “Why are these two separating?” and “What is the nature of the relationship?” and “How long have they known each other?” and “How long are they separated?” There are other questions that may occur to you. The big question that is among the first that must be answered is “Who is the other?” The answer to this question will inform nearly every other question and answer. I find that many young singers choose the most obvious answers to their questions. The conventional wisdom is that the choices with the most turmoil provide the greatest fuel for a performance. There is a logic to this way of thinking and finding the conflict in songs is excellent. But “Ev’ry Time We Say Goodbye”, with its slow tempo and static melody, has a musical and an emotional intensity that may lead you down the wrong path. Remember, the positive choice is usually the better one. Some may choose a situation where the other is a spouse and that the two are separating due to irreconcilable differences. Maybe there is a divorce looming or maybe a lover is choosing to enter the military during a time of war to avoid a marriage proposal. While these kinds of choices may result in a useful analysis leading to a satisfying interpretation, I will ask you to look for positive choices. Sample Interpretations What follows are a couple of different possibilities for an original situation. Situation 1: A 20-year old college student with a girlfriend of one year has to say goodbye to his sweetheart, Grace, for summer break. Grace wanted them to stay at college during the summer and take classes together and spend time at the beach. Fredrick needs to work to earn money for college and the best place for him to do this is at home in his family’s business. They quarrel over this repeatedly. The reason he needs to sing this now is because it is the last day before summer break and his father needs him for a big project in the morning. Fredrick must catch the 32\n\ntrain and convince his sweetheart that he will call her everyday, that he will miss her terribly and that his love for her is real and lasting. Lyrics such as “I die a little” are evidence of how enduring his love is for her. “The gods who think so little of him” is perhaps not so much from a sense of desperation or sadness but a somewhat comic hyperbole. Maybe he is using poetry and humor at the same time. It is an excellent tactic. The lyric “They allow you to go” must be reinterpreted in the singer’s mind to mean “They allow us to be separated.” You will need to do minor reinterpretations such as this often in your work if it does not destroy the intent of the lyric. Situation 2: A young mother must say goodbye to her 7-year-old daughter who is going to summer camp. She must sing these words to comfort her daughter before she gets on the bus. The daughter feels as if she is being punished by being sent away. The mother sings this song to reassure her that she’s not being punished and that she will be missed terribly. She will be coming back in a month and everything will be the same when she returns. The benefit in choosing a situation like this is that the moment is quite rich. The mother is upset about having to say goodbye but must put on a brave face to comfort the child and to keep her from crying. While there is sadness and longing, it becomes more about the love the mother has for the daughter than the separation. It has conflict, but it is more positive than negative. As a side note, we are often told to make life and death choices in our acting. This is wise advice, but can lead us to a morass of angst and “feeling sorry for one’s self.” This is a trap that is to be avoided at all costs. Musical theatre songs are at their most powerful when they are about working through a problem by making positive, life-affirming choices. “The sun’ll come up tomorrow/bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there’ll be sun” and “Look for the silver lining/ whene’er a cloud appears in the blue” are two great examples. You may think these songs are corny but they are great theatre. Analyzing the Refrain Once you have created the situation for your song, the real work of interpretation begins. Often people make the mistake of stopping their exploration and asking questions once they have created the situation. This is only the beginning of the process. You will need to analyze the poetry, analyze the form, consider the ways that the music and the lyrics are related, then look for ways to keep the song “in motion” and active. You must find ways for the song to progress through time such that discoveries are made and that there is a clear beginning, middle and end. Remember, lyrics are like poetry. Let’s look at the poetic devices in the refrain.\n\n33\n\nEv'ry time we say goodbye / I die a little Ev'ry time we say goodbye / I wonder why a little Why the gods above me / Who must be in the know Think so little of me / They allow you to go\n\nRhyme Musical scheme form A A A B B\n\nB\n\nWhen you're near / There's such an air of spring about it C I can hear a lark somewhere / Begin to sing about it C\n\nA\n\nThere's no love song finer, But how strange the change from major to minor Ev'ry time we say goodbye\n\nD D E\n\nB\n\nEv'ry single time we say goodbye\n\nE\n\nCoda\n\nThe refrain falls into a traditional scheme of four pairs of rhymed couplets (A,A,B,B,C,C,D,D) with a coda. The Coda, or tag, has two lines, each of which ends with “goodbye.” The rhymes in each A section are notable because they are quadruple rhymes – “die a little” rhymes with “why a little” and “spring about it” rhymes with “sing about it.” A good rhyme emphasizes important words. The italicized words are made more important because of their rhyme. You will need to consider why these rhymed words are important. The two B sections contain the rhyming pairs of know/go and finer/minor. The musical form of this song is ABAB with a tag. This means that the first section and the third section of the refrain are closely related, or are an exact repetition (with different lyrics, of course). The second section and the last section are also related. Note that we call this last section a “B” even though it ends differently than the first B section. Cole Porter then adds an additional 4 bars of music for the lyric, “Ev’ry single time we say goodbye.” Approximately 15 percent of standards have an ABAB form. The most common form, AABA, is found so frequently that it is referred to as “Song Form.” Most American popular songs of this period were composed first and the lyrics were added later. But since Cole Porter was both the composer and lyricist for this song, we are not sure which came first. According to at least one source2, Porter’s lyrics may have come first. Whichever the case, it is clear that there is much word painting 3 in the refrain. Each A section is notable in that\n\n2\n\nForte, Allen. Interview with Andrew Ford. The Music Show. January 4, 2003\n\n3\n\nWord painting is the musical technique of writing music which reflects the literal meaning of a song\n\n34\n\nthe melody stays fixed on a single note (eight repetitions!) before changing pitch (figure 1). The note change always corresponds with an important word like “die” and “why.” Figure 1\n\nThis static melody may suggest a sense of hesitation or a desire to make time stop. The B sections are much more melodic and higher in pitch (see measure 19 and following in the full song reproduced in figure 2, below). This musical change is in response to the lyric, “Why the gods above me . . . Think so little of me” and “There’s no love song finer.” At the end of the second B section, there is a remarkable musical moment when the lyric, “the change from major to minor” is reflected in a change in harmony from A-flat major to A-flat minor. Other instances of word painting are discussed in figure 2 (below). You might wonder why this is important or how someone without an advanced degree in music theory can find such connections between the music and lyric. The reason this is important is that great songs work on multiple levels. When the art forms of music and poetry are combined, the results are complex and subtle. When you are singing a great song, it is your responsibility to understand it to the best of your ability. Finding these kinds of connections does not take any special knowledge but it does take time and careful listening. Digging Deeper into the Refrain Now that you have a better understanding of the refrain’s structure, you can put your “actor hat” back on. You have answered many of the questions from the Actor’s Homework such as “Who is the singer?”, “Who are you singing to?”, “Where are you?”, and “Why do you need to say these words?” But we have not addressed the all-important question: “What changes during the song?” Refrains generally fall into 4 sections of approximately 8 bars each. There is no fixed rule about this, but I encourage you to give each of these sections a difference action. It is possible to combine sections into a single action but having 5 actions, the four from the refrain plus and additional action for the verse, will give the song more shape, more variety and more colors. I have chosen situation #1 from above: A college student with a girlfriend of one year has to say goodbye to her for the summer. A 20-year old college student with a girlfriend of one year has to say goodbye to his sweetheart, Grace, for the summer. Grace wanted them to stay at college during the 35\n\nsummer and take classes together and spend time at the beach. He needs to work to earn money for college and the best place for him to do this is at home in his family’s business. They quarrel over this constantly. The reason he needs to sing this now is because it is the last day before summer break and his father needs him for a big project in the morning. He must catch the train and convince his sweetheart that he will call her everyday, that he will miss her terribly and that his love for her is real and lasting. The pertinent details of this situation are: 1. I need Grace to know that I will return to her after summer break if I can make money at home. 2. I need Grace to understand that I must earn money this summer or I cannot return to school in the fall. 3. I know that Grace is very upset with the fact that I am leaving. 4. I don’t want to fight about this anymore. 5. I must catch the train. 6. I have to tell Grace all of these things carefully or I run the risk of leaving on a sour note. 7. I want Grace to be okay and to understand that I must leave. I need for her to accept this decision. 8. I need Grace to know that my love for her is real and lasting. These are the givens. They are the things that I must accomplish during the song. They are my objectives. Once you have done this work, you can create the defining sentence: “This is a song about a college student who needs my girlfriend to understand that I must work during the summer so that I can be with her in the fall. I need her to understand that our relationship can stand three months of separation.” The defining sentence incapsulates your story in a concise way so that you can repeat it to yourself before beginning to sing. What follows is an example of how I might assign different actions, based on our givens, to each section to give the song a clear shape. We love each other so deeply That I ask you this, sweetheart Why should we quarrel ever Why can't we be enough clever Never to part\n\nTo Prepare. I know this could be very difficult so I must prepare Grace for the words I need to say by assuring her that I do love her and that I do not want to live my life without her. The tone of this opening verse will be very conversational and yet loving.\n\n36\n\nEv'ry time we say goodbye I die a little Ev'ry time we say goodbye I wonder why a little\n\nTo Convince. I must convince Grace that I have to leave or I cannot return in the fall. I will use logic. While my action is to persuade, I have to be careful with my words so as not to allow her to interrupt me. I must be firm but gentle. This will likely prompt me to sing this passage with a great deal of legato.\n\nWhy the gods above me Who must be in the know Think so little of me They allow you to go\n\nTo Tease. I need to bring in a little humor at this point because she is beginning to get upset. I will cry out to the gods about how unfair the situation is and do so in an overly dramatic way to get her to laugh, or at least smile. When I say, “They allow you to go,” I really mean that the gods have created a situation where I have to leave in order to work for my father. I hope that by giving this a heightened tone that she will first understand how hard this is for me and also laugh. This will prompt me to make much of the fact that the tune becomes much more melodic and higher. I will “milk” this in a playful manner.\n\nWhen you're near There's such an air of spring about it I can hear a lark somewhere Begin to sing about it\n\nTo Overwhelm. I will shower her with my affection and the beauty of my words. I want her to know what her presence does to me and how hard it will be for me to be away from her. I need her to know that my love is real and lasting. This will cause me to sing with a great deal of warmth and expression.\n\nThere's no love song finer, But how strange the change from major to minor Ev'ry time we say goodbye Ev'ry single time we say goodbye\n\nTo Pull. I need to ready her for my departure because the train is here now. I may want to speed up this section a bit because I have to get on the train.\n\nThese five verbs are just some that are possible. Work to achieve a sequence of actions that vary in texture and emotion. The verbs will delineate beats and give structure to the song. Notice that in my sequence of verbs there is a variety of actions and tactics. Creating this kind of variety will give your interpretation distinctive qualities that will set it apart from other interpretations. Putting your Choices into Action All of this work is well and good but is only theoretical until we make the song “live” in real time, moment to moment. The only way to do this is by building it layer upon layer. The image of a pyramid is helpful. All the work we have done thus far has laid the foundation of the\n\n37\n\npyramid. Now we must build upon this solid foundation by doing the “Song as Monologue” exercises. 1. Energized speech. Using a high level of vocal energy, speak the words without inflection with speed so that the words form on your tongue without stops and starts. The purpose of this is to aid in memorizing and getting the words securely into your muscle memory. Do this until you can do it without any hesitation. Do not do this, however, so quickly that the words have no meaning or can’t be understood. Additional activities: A. You may also choose to speak the lyrics as a dramatic recitation, savoring the images and biting into the words as you might bite into an apple. Imagine that you’ve written the lyrics and are reading them at a poetry reading. Savor every image, rhyme and alliteration. B. Locate the images in your song. As you do the monologue, physicalize the images such as love, heaven or fear. At this point, it’s preferable that you go too far in indicating the images. This will help you to see the images in later steps. In other places in the book, I discuss the pros and cons of indicating in a song. Don’t worry about that for now. 2. EXplore objectives through movement. Physicalize the active verbs in each beat hearing the lyrics in your head but without speaking them. Once a section is finished, move on to the next verb. If it will be helpful, have a friend hold up cue cards with that verb written on it to remind you. Start in a neutral position (focus forward Center, weight on both feet and arms to your side) by saying to yourself the defining sentence. Then when you see the inciting event, begin to hear the monologue in your head while employing complete physical involvement. Don't plan what you are going to do. Let it be spontaneous. 3. Combine action and verse. Physicalize the monologue while saying the lyrics. Start in a neutral position (focus forward, Center, weight on both feet and arms to your side) by saying to yourself the defining sentence. When you see the inciting event, begin to speak the monologue with complete physical involvement. This is not a verbal exercise, it is physical. Whisper or shout if you need to. Get down on the floor or stand on a chair if it is appropriate. The lyrics are of secondary importance to the physical life. Be sure to make a clear distinction between each action. To check this, have a friend watch and then list the actions that they saw you do. If they don’t tell you the correct actions, that means that you can be more specific with them. 4. Act. Next, speak the monologue keeping in mind the active verbs you assigned to each beat. The words to the monologue become more important than in the previous exercise but allow your body to respond to the action of the monologue. You may use the cue cards again. Keep your focus forward, center and on your partner. Have a friend stand in for you scene partner if you find that helpful. Do an improvisation with a friend standing in for the scene partner to clearly establish the moment before. 5. Tune. Having the pianist only play chords or a simple, out of tempo, accompaniment, sing the song repeating step 4.\n\n38\n\nTake the same pauses you would take while doing the monologue. You are doing the same monologue but simply adding pitch. This is a excellent way to work on phrasing and pacing. The goal of this activity is to take full possession of the song and make it yours. The music in songs can have the tendency to take over the story-telling. You must avoid this at all costs. Songs are stories. 6. Elevate your performance. Next, have the pianist play the actual accompaniment as you sing the song. Physicalize each moment to the degree you feel is appropriate. Do not allow the accompaniment to make your work less specific. Use this pneumonic device to help you remember the order of the monologue steps. E-Energized speech X-EXplore objectives through movement CAV-Combine action and verse A-Act. True monologue T-Tune. Accuracy of phrasing E-Elevate your performance. Everything combined\n\nConclusion Doing all of this work is crucial in making your performance more specific, detailed and nuanced. It may seem time-consuming and may be frustrating. But if you do it, step-by-step, and build it layer upon layer, it will show in your performance. You will find that the song will be shaped organically, moment to moment with a clear beginning, middle and end. There will be a clear pursuit of objective. You will also find that being specific will keep you from getting distracted with thoughts such as, “How am I doing?” or “Do I sound okay? or “What do I do with my hands?” Your singing will be more effortless and your work more specific.\n\n39\n\nFigure 2\n\n40\n\n41\n\nGuidelines for Different Types of Songs: The Actor’s Homework The three sets of questions which follow will guide you in preparing three different kinds of songs for three different contexts. The first is for creating an original situation. It is recommended that you do this for most of your songs, including songs for an audition. The second is for preparing a role in a show. The story and situation is supplied for you and it is your job to bring the character to life and for the song to make sense at that exact location in the show. The last is for a kind of song I call the “I Am” song. The process described for this kind of song is for such situations as a cabaret or simply when it is desirable for the character in the song to be YOU. This kind of work is especially beneficial when you need to personalize a song no matter what context.\n\n42\n\nThe Actor’s Homework: A Song With a New Context and Situation Song title: Composer/Lyricist: Show title: Write the lyrics in prose form, carefully observing punctuation marks. Objective Interpretation What is this song about objectively? Looking at the lyrics, and without adding your interpretation, what is the song about and what happens? One or two sentences.\n\nSubjective Interpretation A. Who is the singer? Describe the singer using clear, definite statements. B. Who are you singing to? Choose a person or persons that will create interest and conflict. C. When is it? D. Where are you? The more specific your location, the more real it will be for you. E. Why do you need to say these words? Obviously, the stronger the need, the better. F. What changes during the song? G. What do you want? What will happen if you don’t get it? H. Why sing this song now, and not yesterday or tomorrow? Your Created Situation Write the details of the situation you have created. If you are using the situation from the show, use the next set of questions.\n\nDefining Sentence This is a song about_____________________that (continue the sentence below)\n\n43\n\nSong Analysis What is the arc of your song? Winning, losing, “ending up where you started”, or a serendipity arc? Looking at the sheet music, do an analysis of the music making specific note of the relationship between the lyric and the music. Make mention of the song’s formal structure, changes in tempo, changes in style, and changes in accompaniment. Read the lyric and make decisions as to where beat changes occur. Deciding where beat changes happen is a delicate balance between musical understanding, dramatic understanding and intuition. Summarize the beats below. You may want to include a few lyrics that indicate beat changes. Choose a strong, active verb for each beat. Helping verbs to uplift to build to excite to support to overwhelm to celebrate to paint\n\nHurting verbs to destroy to crush to bombard to mock to annihilate to belittle to punish to suppress\n\nReaching verbs to share to open to push to reassure to encourage to convince to overwhelm to inspire\n\nGathering verbs to invite to welcome to seduce to pull to caress to charm to prepare\n\nDescribe the three moment before events: seeing the event (what do you see?), taking it in (what effect does it have on you?) and responding to it (what is your response?).\n\n44\n\nThe Actor’s Homework: Using the Givens from the Musical Before you complete this sheet, it is assumed that you have read the libretto and are able to sing the song in the correct style with the correct pitches and rhythms. Song title: Show title: Year of the show’s opening: Composer/Lyricist: List a few of the important musicals this team wrote:\n\nWrite the lyrics in prose form, carefully observing punctuation marks.\n\nCharacter Analysis 1. List and briefly describe the significant relationships your character has with other characters in the musical. (For example: Curley in OKLAHOMA!) Laurie - the love of my life. Judd - my adversary. He's the guy that stands in the way of my happiness with Laurie. Aunt Eller 2. In one paragraph, write the essential story of your character from their first entrance to their last scene. What is their story arch and super objective? 3. Describe the important details about the location and time period of the events in the musical.\n\nSong Analysis 1. Why have the show's creators decided that this moment in the musical is better sung than spoken? This question is, of course, subjective but nonetheless important to consider. 2. What information about the character and situation is revealed in the song? 3. What information do we get about the character and/or situation from the music (without the lyrics)? You will want to listen just to the piano accompaniment.\n\nWho, What, When, Where & Why • Describe your character using clear, definitive statements. • Who are you singing to?\n\n45\n\n• When is it? • Where are you? • Why do you need to say these words? • What changes during the song? • What do you want during the song? What will happen if you don’t get it? • Why sing this song now and not yesterday or tomorrow?\n\nDefining Sentence The form of the defining sentence is slightly different for book musicals. Follow this model. Soliloquy is the moment where Billy decides that he will do whatever it takes to provide for his child.\n\nThe Bigger Picture • What is the arc of your song? Winning, losing, “ending up where you started”, or a serendipity arc? • Looking at the sheet music, do a simple analysis of the form. What does the music communicate about the character and the situation? • Read the lyric where the beat changes occur. Look for musical changes as well as changes in the lyric. Summarize the events of the song in one or two paragraphs making note of the beat changes. Considering what you now know about the character, situation and the song’s arch, choose a strong, active verb for each beat and write that verb next to the beat in the section just above. I would advise you to choose verbs that are what the character is actually doing with their words and body for each beat. Actions such as caress are fine if that is actually what your character is doing. In other words, don’t choose caress if it is a metaphorical caress. Describe the three moment before events: seeing the event, taking it in, and responding to it. Also consider your character’s history, story arch and super objective as you think about the moment before.\n\n46\n\nThe Actor’s Homework” The “I Am Song” Define the I Am Song When singing an \"I Am\" Song I suggest choosing a real-life situation you can sing about. One caveat, please don't choose truly painful situations. This will likely lead to a performance that is too inward looking and the discomfort it will bring up will not helpful to your work. Really recent events are also problematic. An actor friend of mine calls this \"picking wounds.\" When working on this kind of song, you'll want to steer clear of playing mood or emotion. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking, \"This song is sentimental\" or \"This song is sad.\" Instead, you will be much more specific and the song will be more interesting if it has a conflict, an objective and has a beginning, middle and ending. But I am not saying that you should only use happy situations for an \"I Am\" Song. Tears may come in your work and that is not a bad thing. But crying during a performance is not a good thing for all the obvious reasons. Tears come either when we make a connection to something or someone or a connection is broken. These things aren't necessarily bad. My best advice about tears during a song is that you should allow the tears to come if you're singing about a lost connection but only during your rehearsal. Let them flow freely because in doing so, you'll be able to work through the situation in a healthy manner that will help the song. The feelings you felt in your rehearsal will still be evident in the final performance but you'll be able to avoid them. I like this image. Think of tears and situations that cause them as a fire. If you feel cold, move toward the fire or the feelings. If you feel too warm, move away from them by thinking of something less painful and more positive. I want to share a beautiful cabaret video by Karen Mason illustrating this point beautifully. Youtube: Karen Mason “We Never Ran Out of Love” You’ll want answer the questions and do the associated activities keeping the work very personal, so personal that you’ll want to keep it private. This set of questions can be used when you prepare a song for a cabaret.

What it is about you that makes this song a good choice for you? What do you need to say through this song? What are the traps of this song? Are there ways that the music, accompaniment or melody, could or should be adjusted for the story you want to tell? Describe the situation.\n\nWho, What, When, Where & Why • Who are you singing to? • • When is it? • Where are you? • Why do you need to say these words? • What changes during the song? • What do you want during the song?

You might begin with: “This song is about . . .” or “This song is the moment where . . .”\n\n48\n\nInner Monologue “Power of Two” by the Indigo Girls This is a song about me in which I must awaken my partner of 2 years, Francis, to the depression she’s in that is affecting our relationship. We must both break out of the patterns we’ve been following or risk having an unhappy life together. I’ve been under a lot of stress at work because my job might be eliminated. I also have recently been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. I’m singing to Francis who is very distracted by the long hours at work and a rigorous travel schedule. The trap of the song is that since it’s so positive I could just make this a straight ahead love song and forget about the conflict. I had to remember a time where it would make sense for me to say these words It is the morning of our drive to her parents for Thanksgiving. I need to say these words because we are stuck. We aren’t going to see each other for the next two weeks. We both feel the weight of each of our lives impacting us to the point of despair. When I woke up, I had a moment of clarity where I know we need to put everything aside for a period so that we can get our lives figured out and make plans for a more productive existence. During the song, I’m able to get Francis to admit to her depression and for us both to begin making plans for our future. I need real peace and happiness for us both and for us to spend more time together. I need to seize this moment to confront the situation because I can’t continue in the way we’re living. We’ve both been complaining about our lives but not doing anything about it. The moment before is when I hear Francis say that he’s going to be traveling for 2 weeks and when she gets back she has a huge project that must be completed. At first this makes me mad but then it lights a fire in my heart to try to make some changes. My response is unlike my typical response. Instead of being sad, I decide I have to take action. It’s a winning arc because I am able to awaken Francis and create a space where we can talk about the changes we need to make. I will ask my Musical Director/Pianist to make the song a little more gentle than the original version. I also think it would be smart to simplify the accompaniment in both of the verses so that I can tell the story and not feel like I’m just singing a pop song.\n\n49\n\nNow the parking lot is empty, everyone’s gone someplace. I’ll pick you up and in the trunk I’ve packed a cooler and a two-day suitcase. Cause there’s a place we like to drive way out in the country. And five miles out of the the city limit we’re singing and your hands upon my knee\n\nFrancis, I have something serious that I need to talk about. I know you hate talking about work but you have to admit that it’s coming between us. Can we use this time to reconnect?\n\nTo paint\n\nSo we’re okay, we’re fine. Baby I’m here to stop you’re crying. Chase all the ghosts from your head. I’m stronger than the monster beneath your bed. I’m smarter than the tricks played on your heart. We’ll look at them together and we’ll take them apart. Adding up the total of a love that’s true. Multiply life by the power of two.\n\nYou and made a commitment to each other 2 years ago that we would stick together and work our our problems.

But I took us for better and I took us for worse. Don’t you ever forget. The steel bars between me and a promise suddenly bend with ease. And the closer I’m bound in love with you, the closer I am to free.\n\nI don’t know what’s going to happen with my health. I don’t know how it’s going to affect me but through it all, I can be strong with your help. And I can help you with your struggles too if we could just talk about it. You give me the\n\nto lay bare.\n\n50\n\nI’m painting the picture of how our life is right now and how it needs to change.\n\nI’m reminding Francis of our commitment and telling her that things will be okay. Things aren’t going to be perfect but they can be perfectly fine. I need to caress her in a way that comforts his heart and soul and reaches into her core.\n\nI’m laying bare my heart and saying I don’t know what the future is going to hold for us and that we have to take hold of the moment and make our lives into what we truly want.\n\nSo we’re okay, we’re fine. Baby I’m here to stop you’re crying. Chase all the ghosts from your head. I’m stronger than the monster beneath your bed. I’m smarter than the tricks played on your heart.

Multiply life by the power of two.\n\nI love you and I want to spend the rest of our lives together.\n\n51\n\nto Celebrate What am i doing?\n\nCreating Situations for Songs In a musical, songs exist in a specific context within the story. All the details about the character, the situation, the character’s relationship to other people and the reason for singing the song are given to you. Just because you are given this information doesn’t mean that singing the song is easy. You will still need to do a great deal of excavation to make the song believable and you’ll need to explore what is really going on with the character beyond the surface level. Great Pop music also has an associated story but it’s not always as obvious or clear. Why do we need to create situations for songs if most of the songs we sing are theatrical? Creating your own story for a song will make it more personal and make it more as if you are saying these words and making them up as you go. You will be telling your story and not the story of character that someone else created. You’ll be better able to live in the moment because you’ve made it personal. A great situation does a lot of the work for you. Work toward creating a situation that gets your juices flowing. What follows is a discussion of what makes a great situation for a song. There are a number of traps you’ll want to learn to steer clear of. For instance, using a “best friend” as a partner is usually a trap as it doesn’t have enough conflict. In addition, try to steer clear of making the song and your story too negative. It’s very difficult if your situation has too much negativity in it. What makes a good situation? 1. It has conflict. 2. It has interesting details (location and characters). 3. It has a strong other (the person you are singing to). 4. It must give your character a chance to change during the song. 5. It must have a why. It should give you a strong need to say these words. Conflict Conflict is an important aspect of every good story. Without it, the story is without a reason to exist. Conflict comes in many different forms. The conflict could be that your intended lover is interested in someone else.
