        "text": "Marlene Rosten is the wife of Marine Lieutenant Gary Rosten, horrified by her husband being accusation of rape while stationed in Iraq by Jessica Crewes, another veteran. Marlene asked Jessica herself and was devastated finding out the truth, wanting to make things right and support Jessica. However, Gary found out she was pregnant with a child from the rape and thus killed her by stabbing her to death. Marlene, out of duress and threats from Gary and shock and confusion from the murder, assisted in covering up the murder by placing Crewes' corpse in the trunk of her car and making the fetus be born prematurely, who was then killed and thrown into the Hudson River by Gary.\n\nWhen Marlene's involvement was discovered, she was interrogated and confessed to her part in the murders. She expressed her regret and, as Jessica was found but not her baby, Marlene told police where he was. She and Gary were arrested, found guilty on all charges, and imprisoned for life.
