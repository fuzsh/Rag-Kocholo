Amy is a Drama Desk nominated actress who is a veteran of eight Broadway shows and originated Susan in tick, tick… boom! Off-Broadway. She has appeared on television in “The Blacklist,” “Chicago Med,” “Law & Order: SVU,” and more. She’s also known for her performance as Sally in Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical.
