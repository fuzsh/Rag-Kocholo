Stiles told Us Magazine at the time: "I have absolutely nothing to do with the split between Michael and Jennifer. We are good friends and enjoyed working together.

"This is a personal matter between them, and we should respect their privacy.

“Although I too prefer to keep my private life private, I felt compelled to dispel the rumors [sic] I was somehow the cause for this matter."

Carpenter and Hall subsequently addressed their divorce and continuing to work together.

The actor was first married to American actress and singer Amy Spanger between 2002 and 2007.

Carpenter got hitched to folk singer Seth Avett in 2016 with the couple having one son together.

Dexter ran for eight seasons from 2006 to 2013 before it finished on a controversial note, which left fans angered and dissatisfied with the series finale.

Viewers have welcomed the show’s return with hopes the ending will be rectified to deliver something more palatable for long-time fans.
