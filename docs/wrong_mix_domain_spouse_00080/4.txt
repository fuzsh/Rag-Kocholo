Third time's a charm! 'Dexter' star Michael C. Hall is a married man, again!

The actor married his girlfriend, Morgan Mcgregor, at a ceremony in New York's City Hall on Monday morning, February 29, his rep confirms to Us Weekly.

The duo met back in 2012, after Hall's split from his ex-wife, actress Jennifer Carpenter. That separation hit the headlines in 2010, when Hall's then-costar Julia Stiles issued a statement denying reports she was to blame for the end of his marriage.

Prior to his split from Carpenter, Hall was married to his first wife, Amy Spanger, from 2002 to 2007.

Apart from confirmation of the nuptials, all other details of 45-year-old Hall and his Los Angelesâ€“based novelist wife have been kept private. The pair made their first official appearance as boyfriend and girlfriend at the 2012 Emmy Awards.
