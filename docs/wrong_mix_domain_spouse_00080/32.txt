Michael C. Hall is a newlywed once again.

A spokesman for Hall says the former Dexter star married writer Morgan Macgregor on Monday morning at New York City Hall. Publicist Craig Bankey released no other details.

Hall and Macgregor first appeared publicly as a couple in 2012.

Hall has been performing onstage in New York stage since wrapping Dexter in 2013. Macgregor is a Los Angeles-based book critic.

This is the 45-year-old actor's third marriage. He was previously wed to actress Amy Spanger and his Dexter co-star Jennifer Carpenter, who stood by Hall's side as he battled Hodgkin's lymphoma.

In April 2010, Hall announced his cancer was fully in remission. Eight months later, he and Carpenter split up, and their divorce was finalized a year later.

Meanwhile, Hall has revealed late rock icon David Bowie gave him an 'artifact from his past' he now treasures 'like a talisman' on the opening night of his musical Lazarus.

The actor has just finished a run filling the pop king's shoes in the off-Broadway play, which is a sequel to the singer's 1976 film The Man Who Fell to Earth and features new songs by the Starman favorite.

Michael said the music legend, who died earlier this month after a secret battle with cancer, went out of his way to put him at ease.

The Dexter star told The Guardian the generous musician sent him a 'a very, very amazing gift and note' on opening night for the play, which is staged at The New York Theater Workshop.

'Out of respect for his intense privacy Iâ€™ll just say that it was an artifact from his past that he had passed on to me,' said Michael.
