The VAV-4040 variable air volume (VAV)/variable volume and temperature (VVT) controller features an integrated damper actuator. It can be used on single-duct or dual-duct VAV boxes, boxes that have a reheat fan, or boxes that have built-in staged or modulating heat. The VVT mode allows the damper output to reverse its action in response to the air temperature supplied to it by an HVAC unit. The controller has an air quality compensation/ventilation override, which uses an analog or digital CO2 input or indoor air quality input, which it can accept directly or via a network. The module features an onboard differential pressure airflow sensor, staged reheat control, tristate or 2- to 10-VDC modulating reheat control, and series or parallel reheat fan control.
