I have a few questions, please bear with me. Most of the people I'm surrounded by have never really put any effort into it and therefore they don't have any good answers for these questions.\n\nStarting from the most fundamental understanding. Where should one begin when learning about control work?\n\nIs there any reason, other than securing a certain market, to have a proprietary control language.\n\nWhy does it seem that the industry doesn't utilize computer programming languages for controls.\n\nIn short, I'm pretty ignorant in regard to the control side of things. I'd like to be much better, please tell me where I should begin. Links are very much appreciated"
