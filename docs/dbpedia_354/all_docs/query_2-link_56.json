        "text": "Controls of all kinds are integral parts of restaurant equipment operation. A control is a switch or other device by which a machine is regulated. A control may be manual or automatically operated. An electro-mechanical control typically consists of multiple relays, timers, and/or counters wired together on an enclosure panel. Electro-mechanical control is also referred to simply as \"Relay Control\", which is a more accurate term since solid state electronic relays, timers, and counters are standard components. Contactors, motor and compressor starters, valves, thermostats, and other output devices are used to turn on/off motors, indicator lights, heating elements, and other components used in the equipment."
