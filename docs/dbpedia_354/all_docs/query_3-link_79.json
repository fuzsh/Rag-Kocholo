        "text": "A number of additional requirements for solar on agricultural and natural lands were presented in the room letter \"Tightened Preferred Solar Order. A number of already existing items are also mentioned. Below are the additional requirements for a solar farm on agricultural and natural lands:\n\nThe legally binding 'solar ladder'\n\nIt is an oft-used term in solar and energy transition: the solar ladder. The solar ladder originated from the National Environmental Vision (NOVI). This contains agreements on the spatial planning of the Netherlands. The solar ladder consists of four steps. Each step indicates a preferred location for solar energy development. Steps one, two and three are preferred. If it turns out that step four is necessary to achieve the goals of energy transition, this remains possible.\n\nThe solar ladder is not \"sequential. Sequentiality would mean that steps one, two and three should be developed first. If it turns out later that step four is necessary, it can only be used in the future. Given the urgency of energy transition, this was deliberately not chosen. Steps one, two and three are preferred, step four can and may be used if necessary. So all four steps are worked on simultaneously. Below are the four steps of the solar ladder:\n\nRoofs and facades\n\nUnused land in built-up area\n\nIn rural areas (garbage dumps, roadsides of railroads and highways)\n\nAgricultural and natural lands\n\nThe 'No, unless' policy\n\nThere are additional requirements for developing a solar farm in tier four - agricultural and natural lands. This is called the \"No, unless\" policy. If research shows that stage four is necessary, a solar park can be developed if one of the following exceptions applies:\n\nAgri-PV. This is combining an agricultural activity with solar energy generation.\n\nTransition areas. When an area is in transition, for example, a piece of land with the zoning 'agricultural' will eventually change to 'nature', then a solar park may be built there temporarily. This way, while the land is in transition, it can remain of value.\n\nGrid neutrality. If a solar farm contributes to reducing grid congestion, it may be built. There are two forms of grid congestion: there is (temporarily) too much power on the electricity grid or too little. In both cases a solar farm, for example supplemented with a battery or a direct cable to an industrial estate, can offer a solution.\n\nAdditional incentives step one, two and three\n\nThe minister writes that placing additional requirements on solar parks on agricultural natural lands (step four), leads to fewer new solar parks. Of course, this also means that less renewable energy can be generated. To compensate for this, the aforementioned steps one, two and three are given additional financial incentives. How this will look in practice is still unclear. One option is to do this through the existing SDE++ or by enabling other government budgets.\n\nExisting boundary conditions solar parks\n\nFinally, the letter also re-emphasizes three pre-existing preconditions for a solar park. These are:\n\nGood landscaping. Consider a line of trees around the solar farm and enough space between the panels for soil quality.\n\nCompatible with the power grid. A solar farm generates renewable energy. When this power is supplied to the electricity grid, it has an impact. In order to spare the electricity grid, many (technical) things are already being applied. These include storing electricity and 'capping' maximum production.\n\nStriving for 50% participation. Support in the energy transition is important. The solar sector embraces the aim of the Climate Accord to involve the environment in solar parks. This always takes into account the needs of the environment.\n\nThe results of the Administrative Consultation on Spatial Planning are a kind of \"working agreements\" between the parties involved. These agreements are not legally binding. For that, the agreements must be adopted in provincial (environmental) regulations.\n\nAs of Jan. 1, 2024, the new Environment Act will be in effect. Many things are going to change under the Environment Act. This is important for the development of solar parks as well as the exceptions mentioned in the room letter. However, this law has already been postponed several times. Recently, the Senate passed a motion to postpone the Environment Act again. For now, this has not happened. Novar is preparing for both scenarios.\n\nScenario one: the Environment Act is in effect from Jan. 1, 2024\n\nTo capture the outcomes of the Administrative Consultation, provinces must amend their provincial environmental ordinances. Each province must do this individually. The Provincial Council, the general government of the province, is authorized to do this.\n\nScenario two: the Environment Act is postponed\n\nIf the Environment Act is postponed then nothing will change (yet). The provinces can then still adopt the outcomes of the Administrative Consultation, this time through a \"normal\" regulation.\n\nIn either case, the provinces can adopt the outcomes.\n\nThe room letter writes the following about ongoing projects:\n\nProjects whose participation processes are already at an advanced stage and have not been designed (entirely) in accordance with the agreements under four [point 4 in the room letter, the \"No, unless\"] may proceed.\n\nThis means that ongoing projects can continue. Applications for new projects that are submitted -before the provinces adjust their (environmental) regulations- still fall under the old (read: current) laws and regulations. As soon as provinces amend their (environmental) regulations, the additional requirements from the Administrative Consultation will be legally binding.\n\nNovar chose to submit some projects scheduled for the last quarter of 2023 to the municipality earlier. This seems contradictory. If Novar is developing solar parks in line with the exceptions mentioned in the Administrative Consultation, why were these projects submitted earlier anyway?\n\nAs a renewable energy project developer, we take our role in the energy transition seriously. Trust is more than important. Therefore, this decision did not happen overnight. Political sentiment in the provinces is unruly. The province of Overijssel, for example, has pressed the pause button for new solar parks for six months.\n\nThis is not good for Novar and the solar industry, but it certainly hits local businesses hard. The social damage is great. For this reason, in cooperation with the parties involved, Novar has submitted a number of projects earlier. This way, these projects will not be unnecessarily delayed and the energy transition can continue.\n\nWe want to emphasize that with an accelerated permit application there is still plenty of room to make changes together regarding the spatial integration and the participation plan. Nothing is fixed. This means that an accelerated application has no effect on the further course and possible realization of the renewable energy project.\n\nNovar is a developer of renewable energy systems. Solar systems, both on roofs, carports and land, is part of this. The extra incentive, as mentioned in the room letter, which will be available for these categories (steps one, two and three) is positive.\n\nNovar's strategy is in line with the exceptions covered by the \"No, unless. Novar does not develop new solar parks that do not meet any of these conditions. The (legal) impact on new and ongoing projects is therefore small.\n\nAt the same time, sentiment about the realization of solar energy does worry. Solar energy plays an important role in the energy mix of the future. The energy transition is crucial to combat climate change. Novar therefore calls on policymakers to emphasize the importance of solar in the energy transition and not pursue policies that undermine it."
