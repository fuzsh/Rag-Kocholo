        "text": "Best Air Conditioning Replacement or Installation Service Evansville, IN\n\nThe key to getting through a hot summer in Evansville, Indiana is by relying on your air conditioning unit. If the one you have has worn out or if you’re building a new home, you may need to consider AC installation. This will ensure you have the cool air in your living space when it’s hot outdoors. Baylor Heating and Air Conditioning, Inc. has been in business since 1984, and we have the expertise to ensure your unit is installed with the precision that is needed for it to function at its best.\n\nReasons to Install a New Air Conditioner\n\nDealing with the heat of summer can be exhausting. If you’re like most people, you want to relax and unwind once you get home from work and you’ll want your home to be comfortable. There are many reasons to replace the unit you have, and some of these are listed below:\n\nAvoid toxic leaks from your unit\n\nIncrease the output of your AC by 95 percent\n\nLess chance of needed repairs\n\nLife expectancy of a new unit can be 15 years or more\n\nAir Conditioner Installation Cost\n\nThe cost of installing an air conditioner will vary depending on the size of the unit being installed, the number of units required, the brand and the labor that goes into installing said unit. Most homeowners will ultimately pay between $500 and $4,000 for their central air conditioning unit, or somewhere in that ballpark.\n\nHomeowners should avoid wasting their time by simply reaching out to a professional installation company for a reliable and reasonable quote. A quote is completely free to receive, of course, which makes receiving one a no-brainer.\n\nFor a small home, a window air conditioner will suffice. These units only cost between $150 to $300. For a larger home or an office, however, a large central air unit will be required to cool the entire building. These units will be more costly, but lower electrical bills for the entire office over time. It all depends on the size of the building in question.\n\nMini Split Ductless Air Conditioning Installation\n\nWhen your situation doesn’t allow for central air conditioning, but you’re still in need of the cooling comfort of A/C, a mini split or ductless air conditioning unit is the next best thing. Mini split air conditioners consist of a two-part system and can cool spaces up to 1,500 square feet, depending on the size of the unit. Most mini split air conditioners are wall-hung units with an exterior compressor hung or located near the exterior wall of the room(s) you want cooled. Baylor has installed countless mini split systems for homeowners in need of relief from the summer heat. Call us today for an estimate!"
