        "text": "Annual Gas Savings:20%\n\nBuildings In Complex:8\n\nArea (Square Feet):264k\n\nThe B/E Aerospace facility is an eight-building complex in North Carolina taking up more than 264,000 square feet of manufacturing floor space. Housing the company’s Seating Products and Design Studio division, the needs of this manufacturing are constantly changing.\n\nExisting equipment was already 20 years old when they elected to partner with Piedmont for equipment maintenance over 10 years ago. 80% of the original equipment is still under contract and operating today (at 30 years old!). With every retrofit project, B/E Aerospace has recognized significant energy and operational savings. Automated Facility Solutions (AFS), a division of Piedmont Service Group, designed and installed a flexible HVAC control and energy management system using a single type of controller, keeping upfront costs to a minimum. As the aging HVAC equipment is replaced, B/E Aerospace maintenance staff can easily modify the controllers to reflect the new energy management and control strategies.\n\nAnnual Energy Savings:$11,200\n\nAnnual Energy Savings:20%\n\nReturn On Investment:16.5%\n\nENERGY STAR Rating:87\n\nEagle Transport has been a long term partner with Piedmont since 1990 and the service agreement has been self-funding since year one. The journey began with a service contract on the HVAC equipment.\n\nIn 1996 the pneumatic control system was replaced with a Novar Logic One full building control system. In 2010, the HVAC equipment serving the building was 23 years old and still running well. Piedmont performed an energy survey of the building to identify potential energy improvements. Faced with the opportunity to reduce their energy bills by 20%, Eagle Transport decided to replace the aging rooftop units with newer, high efficiency, environmentally friendly units. A lighting study was also performed to measure the lighting levels and density. Based on the results, Piedmont’s solution was to do a complete lighting retrofit and adjust the layout to better meet the current lighting requirements. As a result of these changes and improvements over the years, Eagle Transport scored an 87 on Energy Star.\n\nBuildings Across The State Of NC:100+\n\nService To Insure Uptime:24/7\n\nPlanned Energy Reduction:30%\n\nPNC Financial Services, headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA, is a diversified international financial services company. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. serves corporations, government and not-for-profit entities, middle-market companies, and institutional and retail clients through its branch network, call centers, and online banking channels. When PNC was looking for someone who could provide a comfortable and efficient environment for their customers and employees in the North Carolina area, they turned to Piedmont Service Group to maintain over 100 branches across the state.\n\nSignature Forbes 5 Star Hotel:5 Star\n\nLuxury Rooms:150\n\n5 Diamond Award:AAA\n\nGreen Plus Certification Since 2010:Green+\n\nThe Umstead Hotel and Spa is a AAA Five Diamond rated luxury located in the heart of the triangle. They offer unparalleled luxury in an environment that expresses an appreciation for the arts and embraces the wonders of nature. The six-story hotel, nestled against a 3-acre lake, resides on 12 acres and is surrounded by plush gardens. It was only natural that when The Umstead was looking for a company to maintain all of their HVAC, Chilled Water, and Building Automation Systems, that they would look to Piedmont Service Group.\n\nIndustrial & Office Space:101k sq. feet\n\nForward & Backward Compatibility :TREND Controls\n\nLiberty Property Trust was struggling with a failing controller on their existing automation system. PSG developed a solution involving TREND Controls, which provided the customer the ability to access their BAS from any computer with an internet connection. It also eliminated their dependency on Trane products as the Trend solution is an open protocol system. This solution will also help LPT reduce their future capital outlay for the facility because the Trend Controls are forward & backward compatible which won't require replacement due to obsolescence or software compatibility\n\nLiberty Property Trust (NYSE: LPT) is a $8.8 billion real estate investment trust which owns 101 million square feet of industrial and office space throughout the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nBuilt In:1978\n\nSq.Ft.:38,000+\n\nHenrico Medical Office Building, located in Richmond Virginia, was experiencing diculties with their aging HVAC equipment. After 30 years, parts were beginning to fail. Unable to shut down their building for extensive repairs Henrico MOB needed a company who could complete the renovations and replacements with little or no downtime. Piedmont Service Group was up to the challenge and completed the project to the highest standards.\n\nHenrico Medical Offce Building is part of Henrico Doctor’s Hospital which is a 340-bed community hospital with the latest in advanced technology, a combination that enables us to deliver exceptional results."
