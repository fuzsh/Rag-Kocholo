When I'm on site I am told to call the iControl Center (1-800-663-6391), they then dial into the site and can tell me which units are not operating.  They can also force units to call which helps when testing during the maintenance, and reduces the time I have to Freeze my @$$ off on the roof.  They can make all the units call for heat and look at the SAT, then tell me",
