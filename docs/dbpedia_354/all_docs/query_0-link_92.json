He also led the integration team of two acquired companies, the expansion of the company business in the OEM segment, and a sales expansion in the South America region. After Novar was acquired by Honeywell International, he led the supply chain integration team creating synergies above project goals, supporting a large new product introduction effort, and improving overall process efficiency.\n\nCommenting on his new role, Mr. Parmeziani stated, “I am honored to take the responsibility to lead a great team of professionals and to continue the long tradition of excellence and customer focus that Seagrave has established over more than 130 years of innovation and service to our brave and mission-driven customers, helping them to safely protect their communities.”\n\nSeagrave designs, engineers and builds its own aerial apparatus and custom chassis in a variety of models to meet the demands of diverse firefighting needs.
