        "text": "In 2014 we transitioned from Trend to Alerton, which was offered through our same dealer network supply channel, and began installing the Alerton Ascent product line on all new projects. The Alerton Ascent system utilizes native BACnet programming and the Ascent Compass software provides a professional looking, state of the art front end platform for system programming, commissioning, monitoring and management.\n\nControls at CRAFT – Navigating the Changes\n\nThe change from Novar to Trend to Alerton in a relatively short period of time provided challenges to our client base, but James CRAFT & Son was there to provide assistance and guidance along the way. One nice thing is that these three companies share a common thread – Honeywell International – and have been related with one another for many years. Novar merged with Caradon plc, the parent company of Trend in 2001 and became Novar plc. Alerton was acquired by Novar plc in 2003. Honeywell International acquired Novar plc in 2005 to enhance Honeywell’s intelligent building controls portfolio which now includes Alerton, Trend, Novar and Tridium.\n\nLife & business are full of changes, but a constant value of James CRAFT & Son is commitment to its valued clients, then, now and always.\n\nJames CRAFT & Son became a System Provider for Trend Controls in 2007 and began installing the Trend IQ3 control system on our projects. Trend is a UK based company founded in 1982 that began North American operations in 2004 and distributed the Trend IQ3 product line primarily through the existing network of Novar dealers. The reason for taking on the Trend product line was that the Novar Logic One system was becoming obsolete as it was based on older technology with proprietary programming. The Trend IQ3 system was more advanced and aligned with current industry trends which were moving toward open protocol standards and interoperability. The Trend IQ3 system is BACnet compliant and includes web access capabilities; features that Novar wasn’t able to accommodate with the Logic One system.\n\nAlthough Trend withdrew from the North American market in 2014 they continue to be one of the largest building control system manufacturers in the world, operating in over 50 other countries. New and replacement components are available through our existing supply channel and James CRAFT & Son continues to provide sales, service and technical support to new or existing Trend customers.\n\nExisting systems can be modified or expanded using new Trend or Alerton products.\n\nAn offspring of our electrical construction department; the controls department was formed in 1984 when we became an authorized dealer of Novar Controls, Inc. We completed our first Novar Logic One – Building Management Control System installation at the York County Hospital and Home in 1985 to control the central steam boiler plant and chilled water systems throughout the complex. Since that time we have installed Novar control systems for numerous clients throughout the region, as well as our own office, warehouse & shop facilities completed in 1986 (even the coffee pot is controlled through this system).\n\nThe Novar Logic One product line was discontinued in 2007 and a very limited supply of new or refurbished replacement components is still available. However, James CRAFT & Son continues to provide service and technical support to any building owner with an existing Novar system. We are ready to assist with anything from a simple repair to a minor system modification or reconfiguration.\n\nIf necessary, a complete system replacement can also be designed and proposed."
