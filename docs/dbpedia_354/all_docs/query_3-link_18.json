This includes the processing of data through our website www.novar.nl.\n\nWe are the so-called data controller for the processing of this data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (\"AVG\").

We will only do so when we deem it necessary or when we are required to do so by laws and regulations. We only share your data with trusted parties and ensure that the process of sharing this data is covered by appropriate safeguards. We may share your personal data with:\n\ngovernment agencies such as the IRS;\n\nclients and customers of Novar;\n\nchain partners and other service providers such as banks, insurers, accountants, tax consultants and other advisors;\n\nexternal suppliers such as ICT service providers, hosting and cloud service providers or other suppliers to whom we outsource support services.\n\nIn addition, if the third party with whom your data is shared is considered a processor within the meaning of the AVG, we will enter into a processor agreement with that third party.\n\nTransfer of personal data outside the European Union\n\nIn principle, we do not share personal data with parties outside the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"). However, should we decide to provide your personal data to parties outside the EEA, we will only do so if an appropriate level of protection for the processing of personal data is ensured. This may mean, for example, that we use a model agreement from the European Commission or make specific arrangements regarding the handling of personal data.\n\nRetention periods\n\nWe store your personal data in accordance with the AVG and specific mandatory legal retention periods.\n\nThe period for which we will retain your personal data depends on the purpose for which it was obtained. If your data is used for multiple purposes with different retention periods, we will apply the longest period.\n\nPersonal data processed on the basis of your consent will be retained until you withdraw your consent or request that your data be deleted or object to its processing.\n\nPersonal data processed for the performance of a contract will be retained throughout the relevant contractual relationship.\n\nPersonal data processed on the basis of Novar's legitimate interests are retained for as long as Novar needs to comply with/achieve these interests.\n\nOnce these periods have expired or your request to erase your personal data has been granted, we will retain your personal data only for the periods required by law.\n\nYour privacy rights\n\nUnder the AVG, you have a number of rights.

If you wish to exercise these rights please contact us. Our contact details can be found at the end of this privacy statement.\n\nWe may not (be able to) comply with your request.

Should we not (be able to) comply with a particular request, we will of course inform you of our reasons.\n\nTo the extent that the processing of your personal data is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time. Any withdrawal of your consent shall not affect the lawfulness of previous processing based on it.\n\nYou also have the right to file a complaint with the supervisory authority: the Personal Data Authority (\"AP\").
