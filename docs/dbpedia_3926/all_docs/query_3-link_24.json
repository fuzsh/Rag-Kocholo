        "text": "Michael Dell is the founder of Dell Inc., the second largest computer manufacturer in the world. With a net worth of about $ 14.6 billion, the Texas billionaire was the 44th richest man in the world according to Forbes 2011.\n\nDuring the preparation of his degree in physics at the University of Texas, at Austin. Michael Dell spends all his time to the creation of PC's Limited, an IT company. PC’s Limited only manufactures custom-built computers. In 2004, Michael Dell founded the company Dell with only $ 1000.\n\nAnxious to streamline its expenditures, Michael Dell develops an innovative strategy which, by assembling customized computers (only made-to-order) ensures to avoid costly and unnecessary inventory management. The concept really works so Michael Dell leaves the school to devote to the launch of Dell Computer Corporation. With a turnover of $ 35 billion and $ 2 billion of profits in 2002, Dell generates enormous profits.\n\nIn 2004, Michael Dell gives up his seat to Kevin Rollins as CEO but keeps the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nTaking advantage of the internet boom, Dell realizes nearly 50% of its business online. Every day, the company generates about $ 40 million.\n\nBut in 2007, Dell makes a succession of errors; delivery time are not guaranteed anymore, the manufacturer has to bring back nearly 4.2 million of defective batteries and HP, the main Dell’s competitor takes the first place. Michael Dell fires Kevin Rollins and takes charge.\n\nThe founder of the Texas firm manages to put Dell in the good direction but nevertheless his fortune markedly reduces because of the crisis and the decline in Dell stock prices.\n\nFollowing the example of Bill Gates, Michel Dell has created “Michael and Susan Dell Foundation”, a foundation committed in education and health."
