        "text": "Michael Saul Dell, born in 1965, is a super-rich American guy who's into business and investing. He's the big boss of Dell Technologies, which is all about tech stuff and is super big worldwide. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he's the 12th richest person globally, with a crazy amount of money, around $104 billion by March 2024. Forbes says most of this cash comes from his shares in Dell and another company called VMWare, with some of it managed by his family office, DFO Management. Back in 2013, he made headlines by offering a whopping $24.4 billion to make Dell Inc. a private company again, which was a huge deal at the time. And he succeeded! Dell Inc. officially became a private company again in October 2013. But then, in December 2018, it went public once more. Crazy, right?\n\nMichael Dell: A Journey from Childhood, Education to Entrepreneurship\n\nMichael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston to a Jewish family. His parents, Lorraine Charlotte and Alexander Dell, had different professional backgrounds - his mother was a stockbroker while his father worked as an orthodontist. Growing up, Michael attended Herod Elementary School in Houston. Showing an early interest in business, he even attempted to take a high school equivalency exam at the young age of eight. At an early age, Michael showed a knack for investing, putting his earnings from part-time jobs into stocks and precious metals. His fascination with technology began when he purchased his first calculator at seven and encountered a teletype terminal in junior high. His interest deepened at age 15 when he got his hands on his first computer, an Apple II, which he eagerly disassembled to understand its inner workings.\n\nWhile attending Memorial High School in Houston, Michael took on a summer job selling subscriptions to the Houston Post. Despite his parents' aspirations for him to become a doctor, Michael continued to explore his entrepreneurial side. He enrolled in pre-med at the University of Texas in 1983 to fulfill his parents' wishes but remained committed to his business pursuits. During his time at university, Michael honed his sales skills by targeting specific populations for newspaper subscriptions rather than making cold calls. He identified niches like newlyweds and people moving to new homes as prime subscription candidates. Leveraging public records, he amassed contact information and sent direct mail appeals, which proved successful, earning him $18,000 in one year.\n\nSeeing the potential in his business endeavors, Michael made a bold decision. At the age of 19, after earning a substantial gross profit of nearly $200,000 in his first year of business, he made the pivotal choice to drop out of the University of Texas. This marked the beginning of his journey as a full-time entrepreneur, setting the stage for the founding of Dell Inc., a company that would revolutionize the computer industry. Michael Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989, in Austin, Texas. The couple resides in Austin with their four children.\n\nMichael Dell: A Legacy of Innovation, Philanthropy, Entrepreneurial Spirit\n\nA Vision for Direct Sales: The Birth of Dell Computer Corporation\n\nAs a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Michael Dell began his entrepreneurial journey by assembling and selling upgrade kits for personal computers out of his dorm room in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. By cutting out the overhead costs of a traditional computer store, Dell was able to secure contracts with the State of Texas, winning bids and establishing his early business success.\n\nIn January 1984, Dell recognized the potential for selling PCs directly to customers, seeing the cost-saving benefits over the conventional retail channel. He registered his company as \"PC's Limited\" and adopted a strategy of manufacturing computers only after they were ordered. Operating initially out of a condominium, Dell's business quickly grew, selling between $50,000 and $80,000 worth of PC upgrades and components. By May of the same year, he incorporated the company as \"Dell Computer Corporation\" and relocated to North Austin, employing a small staff to handle orders and assembly.\n\nBy 1992, at the age of 27, Michael Dell became the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Under his leadership, Dell Inc. continued to innovate, launching its online sales platform in 1996 and expanding into server production the same year. By 1997, dell.com was generating approximately $1 million in sales per day, solidifying Dell's position as a leader in the computer industry.\n\nIn 2001, Dell Inc. reached a significant milestone, surpassing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker with a market share of 12.8 percent. This achievement marked a shift in the industry, with Dell's shipments of desktops, notebooks, and servers experiencing substantial growth while competitors struggled.\n\nTransition and Return: Michael Dell's CEO Journey\n\nIn 2004, Michael Dell stepped down as CEO but remained chairman of the board, with Kevin Rollins taking over as CEO. However, Dell returned as CEO in 2007 at the request of the board, leading the company through a period of strategic restructuring.\n\nIn 2013, Michael Dell, with the support of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell Inc. private in a deal worth $25 billion. Despite facing challenges during execution, including resistance from investor Carl Icahn, Dell successfully acquired a 75% stake in the company.\n\nIn 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intention to acquire EMC Corporation, a leading enterprise software and storage company, in a deal valued at $67 billion. This acquisition, finalized in 2016, marked one of the largest tech acquisitions in history, further solidifying Dell's position as a powerhouse in the technology sector.\n\nMichael Dell: Beyond Tech - Investments, Real Estate, In 1998, Michael Dell ventured into investment management by founding MSD Capital L.P., later renamed DFO Management, to oversee his family's financial interests. In February 2018, Dell made headlines for purchasing Manhattan's One57 penthouse for $100.5 million, setting a record as the most expensive home ever sold in the city at that time.\n\nMarch 1, 2024, marked a significant milestone for Dell as his net worth surpassed $100 billion. This achievement came after Dell, Inc. reported impressive earnings, leading to a 32% increase in stock value in a single trading day.\n\nPhilanthropy and Legacy\n\nMichael Dell's legacy extends far beyond his pioneering role in the tech industry. His entrepreneurial spirit and innovative business strategies have left an indelible mark on the world of technology and beyond. Through his company, Dell Inc., he revolutionized the computer industry by introducing the concept of direct sales to consumers, bypassing traditional retail channels and offering customizable, made-to-order computers at competitive prices.\n\nBeyond his business ventures, Michael Dell's legacy includes his philanthropic efforts. Alongside his wife, Susan, he established the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation in 1999, which focuses on addressing pressing issues in health and education. Through strategic investments and partnerships, the foundation has made significant contributions to improving the lives of underserved communities around the world. Michael Dell's impact also extends to the realm of investment management. With the founding of MSD Capital L.P. (later renamed DFO Management), he demonstrated his acumen in managing his family's financial interests, diversifying his portfolio beyond the technology sector.\n\nIn addition to his professional and philanthropic endeavors, Michael Dell's personal values and leadership style have shaped his legacy. He is admired for his commitment to innovation, customer satisfaction, and employee empowerment. His journey from a college dorm room entrepreneur to one of the wealthiest individuals in the world serves as inspiration for aspiring entrepreneurs and business leaders globally."
