        "text": "Michael Dell Net Worth: How rich is Michael Dell? & How much money is Michael Dell worth? Time to find out!\n\nMichael Dell is an American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, and author and his current net worth is $22.4 billion.\n\nBorn in Houston, as the son of Lorraine Charlotte, a stockbroker, and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, he grew up in a Jewish family.\n\nGrowing up, he attended the Herod Elementary School in Houston, and had invested his earnings from part time jobs in stocks and precious metals.\n\nAs a result of a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at the age of eight.\n\nAt seven he had already purchased his first calculator and in junior high he encountered an early teletype terminal.\n\nThen at 15, he got his first Apple II, which he quickly disassembled to see how it worked.\n\nHe took a job as a dishwasher at 12 years old and quickly advanced to maître d’. Later it followed the school, which he attended at Memorial High School in Huston. There he used to sell subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer.\n\nDell noticed that the people most likely to buy subscriptions were those who wanted to move there for good.\n\nAfter hiring some friends to scour local court record so that he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications, he divided those numbers by the size of the mortgage. He started calling those with the highest mortgages first.\n\nHe earned $18,000 that year, while making the annual income of his history and economics teacher significantly higher.\n\nHow did Michel Dell get famous?\n\nAt 19 he started selling computers out of his University of Texas dorm room, grossing $80,000 by the end of his freshman year.\n\nThen he applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts, which made selling PCs directly more advantageous over the conventional indirect retail channel.\n\nHow does Michel Dell make money?\n\nHe registered his company as PC’s Limited, in 1984, operating out of a condominium. Then he sold the business for a number between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components.\n\nIn May, Dell incorporated the company as “Dell Computer Corporation” and moved it to a business center in North Austin.\n\nBack then, the company only had a few orders, few people to fulfill them, and a capital cost of $1,000.\n\nAt 27 years old, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine’s list of the top 500 corporations.\n\nFour years later, he started selling computers over the web, the same year his company launched its first servers.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world’s largest PC maker.\n\nNow, the company is one of the top rated brands.\n\nDell’s personal net worth is around $22.4 billion, according to Forbes magazine."
