        "text": "Michael Saul Dell famous also as Michael Dell is the American businessman, the founder and the permanent head of Dell corporation. The State of Texas (USA) was born on February 23, 1965 in Houston.\n\nBiography\n\nMichael Dell was born in the Jewish devout family on February 23, 1965. The family was safe if not to call it prosperous. Michael's father, Alexander Dell, worked as the orthodontist, at that time his mother, Lorain, was a quite good broker. Professionalism and some life skills of parents allowed Michael's family to rise to the most upper bound of the middle class. It gave Dellam all grounds to believe that the model of their course of life is safe, and they persistently advised the son to go by a medical part. It is strange that Lorraine shared opinion of the husband, Michael in the childhood showed independence of thinking, persistence and an entrepreneurial grasp.\n\nIn 8 years he decided to pass high school of high school – important issues in life supposedly and so is enough – and submitted the application for obtaining the document on the correspondence senior secondary education. Not less amazing history happened to 12-year-old Dell on fishing. While seniors with might and main caught fish, Michael sat ashore and patiently weaved the intricate tackle capable to bear at once tens of hooks from the loess. Wise adults laughed at him, a pier: \"That you fool about, we came not to work, and to have a rest and all the same nothing will turn out\". Stubborn Michael believed that is more visible to him. He finished only by a lunch. Nevertheless, when time to leave came, it turned out that he caught fish most than other combined. Since then in any vital circumstances Dell conforms to the rule: \"If it seems to you that some idea is good, without fail try it in practice\".\n\nSeveral years later Michael other good idea - to trade in brands visited, placing advertisements in philatelic magazines. Very quickly he earned $2 thousand and purchased the first computer which without delay took to pieces to look how it works.\n\nLater, the grown-up Dell, the pupil of high school, decided to earn additionally, selling a subscription for the city newspaper Houston Post. By that moment he, probably, already quite accurately formulated the vital credo: \"It is not so important that you sell how many that is as you do it\". It did not begin to go from a door to a door. Came to its mind that newlyweds - an ideal object for its direct marketing. For the money he employed friends who got for it names and the addresses svezheobruchivshikhsya. Michael brought them in the computer and sent to each pair the personal, but not standard letter, offering a free subscription to two weeks as a wedding gift. This time Dell earned already $18 thousand and purchased BMW. The seller of machines nearly lost a speech power when the 17-year-old fellow pulled out all cash amount from a pocket.\n\nConcept of business\n\nThe first employee of the company, in addition to Dell, was the manager who was engaged in finance and administration. Undoubtedly, the company needed advertizing. Dell made the first sketch of Dell Computer on an empty box from under pizza. The friend copied it on paper and carried in the newspaper. Dell still specialized in direct marketing of the IBM PC to which he added those \"frills\" that were fashionable among users at the moment. The philosophy of Dell already developed: \"Sell to the user not that was overlooked in a warehouse, and the fact that it is necessary for it. And cheaper, than others\". That Dell if did not eliminate the concept \"warehouse\" from production process, then transferred it from a key position to insignificant. In process of emergence of orders Dell looked for the necessary spare parts for the equipment of each specific machine. As a result for the first month of work of sale reached $180 thousand, for the second - already $265 thousand. None of \"whales\" of computer business paid attention to revolutionism of methods of the entrepreneur self-educated person. Meanwhile, a year later Dell sells already one thousand PCs a month, all hires new employees, but component parts are still ordered as required, and profit margin everything grows. So in the American market the new model of effective creation of production appeared. And case was not only in the \"facilitated\" warehouse and low price: before to guess – not a task. Dell Computer was the small company and already at least therefore had to love users stronger, than \"whales\" with billion turnovers. Dell decided \"warm\" love to the user to degree extraordinary high for those times - and more not to reduce it.\n\nFirst, unlike other producers of that time, Dell gave to the buyers a refund guarantee. Secondly, he understood that the computer not luxury, but \"vehicle\" therefore he in case of breakdown guaranteed instant service next day, and implemented the round-the-clock free line later for users that they could talk directly to computer specialists (90 percent of \"breakdowns\", according to Dell, are liquidated after five-minute telephone consultation with the aware person). Thirdly, the permanent telephone contact did not allow Dell to come off expectations of the ordinary user. \"My competitors developed products, and then said to users that it is necessary for them instead of at first understanding that it is necessary for the market, and then to make\" - here the head of Dell Computer corporation, the third in world tables of ranks of computer makers so convicts bad \"whales\" (after IBM and Compaq). That day when Michael would have to graduate Dell from college, sales to his company around the world grew to $70 million a year. Dell ceased to trade in computers of other producers and began \"untwist\" own brand. However at some point life proved to Michael Dell that the corresponding diploma - piece reasonably useful. He was excessively talented as the entrepreneur also \"grew\" so quickly that \"it was knocked by the head about a ceiling\", and is quite painful, and the company created by it not cemented by the experienced, diplomaed managers suddenly began to be scattered in the eyes under own weight. The share value which jumped up from 23 cents in 1990 to 40 dollars in 1992 fell several times. Some time Dell was just in panic: \"Every day, having heard bad news, I expected that the following will be even worse\". However, the talented businessman quickly got it together, having remembered what he knows, and, first, immediately contracted sales through shops: \"Our case - to sell cheap and high-quality computers directly in hands to the buyer\", and secondly, enticed several top managers at \"whales\" of the world computer industry (Apple, Motorola, IBM, Tricord). Then left to public and said: \"We are going not just to survive in computer wars. We are going to prosper\". And it appeared the rights.\n\nOther activity\n\nDell who selected the, independent way could earn a status equal to 12.3 billion US dollars. These data are right for the beginning of 2009 and are provided to log readers of Forbes. Nevertheless, Dell's interests are not limited to only one earning money and dispersion of computer iron worldwide. In particular in 2005 a couple Dellov 250 thousand US dollars (a maximum amount of a grant) for the second inauguration of the president George Bush Jr. offered. As well as Dell donates most of rich people of the West for charity much. For example, the couple Dellov offered in May, 2006 to the University of Texas (to that which was not finished by Michael Dell) 50 million dollars. This grant allowed to organize and construct three new faculties with the additional body and extensions.\n\nStatus\n\n2015: $19.4 billion — Forbes\n\nIn August, 2015 the authoritative magazine Forbes published the rating of the most secure figures of the information technology industry. Michael Dell's fortune was estimated in $19.4 billion Read more here.\n\n2016: $22 billion — Forbes\n\nIn August, 2016 the Forbes magazine provided the rating of the richest businessmen in the field of the information technologies (IT). Michael Dell's fortune was estimated in $22 billion Read more here.\n\nFamily\n\nMichael Dell still lives in Austin, the State of Texas (USA) where he was born. This person differs in surprising constancy. Dell still is married to one woman - Susan. They have four daughters: Cyrus, Alex, Zachariah and Juliette.\n\nMichael Dell with the wife Susan\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nBeing \"true American\" a brand of Dell tries to support the brand by the most radical methods. In particular Michael Dell has an irreconcilable hostility with famous Steve Jobs. Both CEOs during the serious interviews or actions try to start without fail a needle in the competitor. With the first war there began Jobs who condemned Dell for the same boring body which completes solutions of an eminent brand. In response to it M. Dell a question of journalists what he would make first of all if the Apple company belonged to it, with inherent sarcasm answered: \"First of all I would close it, and distributed money to shareholders\".\n\nIn 19 years Michael Dell considered that training in college interferes it with computer business, gave up study and concentrated on development of the firm. By that moment when Michael Dell would have to graduate from college, sales to his company around the world grew to $70 million a year.\n\nLinks"
