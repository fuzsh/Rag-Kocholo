His remaining investments count to $10 billion and it is managed by his other company, MSD Capital. It was declared in 2013 that he had to bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout. Thus Dell Inc. officially became private in 2013. While it became public again in 2018.\n\nMichel Dell - Write-ups\n\nMichael Dell wrote a book in 1999 named, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry.
