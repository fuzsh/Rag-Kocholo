        "text": "Michael Dell, born on February 23, 1965, in Houston, Texas, is a prominent American entrepreneur and businessman known for founding Dell Technologies, one of the world's largest technology infrastructure companies. Dell remains a key figure in the technology industry, recognized for his entrepreneurial vision and contributions to computing innovation.\n\nDell's journey began in 1984 when he founded PC's Limited (later renamed Dell Computer Corporation) from his dormitory room at the University of Texas at Austin. He pioneered the direct-to-consumer model for selling personal computers, allowing customers to customize their PCs onlineâ€”an innovative approach that disrupted traditional distribution channels.\n\nUnder Dell's leadership, the company expanded rapidly, driven by its efficient supply chain and customer-centric business model. By the early 1990s, Dell became one of the largest PC manufacturers globally, known for its high-quality products and competitive pricing. The company went public in 1988 and continued to grow, diversifying into enterprise solutions, software, and services.\n\nIn 2016, Dell Technologies completed a landmark acquisition of EMC Corporation, forming one of the largest technology mergers in history. The acquisition bolstered Dell's position in the data storage and cloud computing markets, broadening its capabilities in enterprise IT solutions.\n\nBeyond his role at Dell Technologies, Michael Dell is actively involved in philanthropy through the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on improving education, healthcare, and economic stability for children and families in the United States, India, and South Africa. The foundation has committed millions to initiatives supporting education reform, youth development, and disaster relief efforts."
