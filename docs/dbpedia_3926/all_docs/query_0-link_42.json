        "text": "Michael Dell is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Inc; one of the largest sellers of personal computers in the world. Michael was born in Houston, Texas, on 23rd February 1965 to Lorraine Charlotte; a stockbroker, and Alexander Dell; an Orthodontist.\n\nFrom a very young age, Dell showed a peculiar liking for two things; business and technology. A very hardworking boy, he did a lot of part-time jobs in his early teens and most of his earnings from these jobs he invested in stocks and precious metals. When he was in High school, he sold newspaper subscriptions for the Houston Post. Due to his innate business acumen and ability to sift through tons of data, he was able to find new customers for his newspaper subscription, and in just one year he earned $18,000 selling newspaper subscription. This was more than the annual income of his history and economics teacher.\n\nDell got his first computer at the age of 15; an Apple II, intrigued by the machine he took it apart just to know how it worked. That was how his journey into the world of computers began. At first, he created an informal business, during his freshman year as a pre-med student (his parent wanted him to be a doctor) that was involved in putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers.\n\nAnd then in 1984, when the personal computer world was still very young, Dell realized no company had tried selling computers directly to customers, they were all involved in indirect retail trade. Dell thought that if he could bypass the middlemen then he could make substantial returns for himself. Hence, he tapped into his savings account of $1,000 and started building and selling computers for people he knew in college. His emphasis wasn’t just on good machines but strong customer support and cheaper prices. He soon had accounts outside of school and it wasn’t long before he dropped out to focus entirely on his business.\n\nread the complete article on http://yne.ng/amazing-business-stories-michael-dell/"
