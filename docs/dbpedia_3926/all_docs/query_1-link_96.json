Dell revolutionized the retail computer industry by instituting a direct sales approach, where the customer places their customized order via phone or the internet directly with Dell Computer versus a retail store. In 1998, Dell generated $18.2 billion in revenues, and its total annualized shareholder return that year was 249%."
