        "text": "Michael Saul Dell (born February 23, 1965, Houston, Texas, USA) is an American entrepreneur, founder and CEO of Dell. He started his company in artisanal conditions, providing home-made modifications of the IBM PC. In 2013, he took 49th place in the list of the 100 richest people in the world with a fortune of $ 15.9 billion.\n\nDell grew up in a family of Jewish dental technicians. He attended Memorial High School in Houston (Texas), but did not show much promise there. Already at the age of twelve, Michael began to show signs of rare intelligence. During the holidays, he worked part-time at the post office; his job was to convince residents to start subscribing to the local newspaper. For each new subscriber, he was paid interest. The boy noticed that the easiest way to convince those residents who have recently arrived in the city to sign. Dell began to pay his friends two dollars a day to find new settlers. This is how twelve-year-old Michael Dell made his first $ 2,000.\n\nLater, he sold a subscription to the Houston Post magazine, while using the direct selling technique: he learned the names and addresses of the newlyweds and sent them specially composed letters of congratulations, and as a gift he offered a two-week free subscription to the magazine.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, he entered the University of Texas at Austin and was going to become a doctor in the future. During his studies, he founded a computer sales company PC's Limited. The company soon began to bring good profits, so at the age of 19, Dell left the university and began to spend all his time on business. In 1987, PC's Limited was renamed Dell Computer Corporation. Despite the numerous problems that plagued the company (including the fire hazard of laptops in 1993, the temporary concession of significant market share to Gateway in the mid-1990s, and others), the company was able not only to survive, but also to become the most profitable manufacturer of personal computers in the world. ... In 2004, the company had sales of more than $ 49 billion and revenues of about $ 3 billion. In 2003, the company changed its name to Dell, Inc., as by that time the list of its products had expanded significantly.\n\nOn March 4, 2004, Michael Dell stepped down as CEO, but remained chairman of the board of directors, and Kevin Rollins took his place.\n\nIn 2005, in Forbes magazine's list of the 400 richest people, Dell was 4th in the United States and 18th in the world. His fortune was estimated at approximately US $ 18 billion.\n\nIn February 2017, he was the 37th richest person in the world with a fortune of US $ 20.8 billion.\n\nMichael Dell lives in Malibu, California. His home is ranked 15th on the list of the largest houses in the world, and its value is estimated at approximately US $ 18.7 million.\n\nMay 6, 2021 Bloomberg estimated his fortune at $ 50,600 million"
