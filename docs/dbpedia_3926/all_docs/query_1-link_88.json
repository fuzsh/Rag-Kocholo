        "text": "The Life Story of Michael Saul Dell\n\nDell Inc. is a household name in the personal computer industry. It is one of the eight most recognized computer companies in the world.\n\nWhat you may know about this company is it bears the name of its founder, Michael Saul Dell.\n\nMichael Dell is an American entrepreneur and businessman best known as the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies (parent company of Dell Inc.), one of the world’s largest computer and technology companies.\n\nDell founded PC’s Limited (thereafter named Dell Computer Corporation and finally, Dell Inc.) at 19 years while still a freshman on campus. He built computers and sold them directly from his dorm room.\n\nIn 1992, he became the youngest CEO and founder of a company featured on the Fortune 500 list.\n\nDell is one of the entrepreneurs behind the PC revolution in the 1970s and 1980s. Let’s discover how he went into the PC industry and started one of the best PC manufacturers in the world.\n\n“Buying a company that is number one in its business is hard to do. When something is for sale, it’s often not a leader.” – Michael Dell\n\nBirth and Childhood\n\nMichael Saul Dell was born in Houston, Texas, on February 23, 1965. He grew up in a well-off Jewish family, with his mother (Lorraine Charlotte) working as a stockbroker and his father (Alexander Dell) as an orthodontist.\n\nDell’s parents wanted him to pursue medicine. However, he exhibited enthusiasm for business and electronics.\n\nEducation\n\nDell studied at Herod Elementary School in Houston, Texas, and then went to Memorial High School.\n\nEver the go-getter, he applied for the high school equivalency exam at eight, hoping to complete school quicker to join the business world.\n\nOutside school, Dell worked part-time roles. He used his earnings to invest in stocks and precious metals.\n\nDell once worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant. He also sold newspaper subscriptions for the Houston Post. On one occasion, he made $18,000 in one year.\n\n“I always knew I wanted to run a business someday.” – Michael Dell\n\nDell’s interest in technology and business didn’t diminish as he grew older.\n\nAt age 15, he purchased an Apple II PC with the sole intention of dismantling it to learn more about computers.\n\nHis parents still wanted him to become a doctor, so he enrolled in a pre-med course at the University of Texas.\n\nFounding Dell Inc.\n\nDell had no sooner settled in to study medicine at the University of Texas than a new business idea popped into his mind.\n\nHe established a small business selling PC disk drives on campus, allowing computer owners to customize their memory disks.\n\nUsing $1,000 in personal startup funding, he registered his venture with the state of Texas and named it PC’s Limited. This startup became the foundation for Dell Inc.\n\nThrough word of mouth and low-budget advertising techniques, Dell made approximately $80,000 in his freshman year, his first year in business.\n\nHe dropped out of college, against his parent’s wishes, to focus on running his business.\n\n“A company is only as good as the people it keeps.”- Michael Dell\n\nIn 1986, Dell’s company became the first to offer toll-free technical customer support, now offered by every PC maker.\n\nUnder Dell’s leadership and innovation, the company grew and became a dominating player in the computer industry.\n\nDell took PC’s Limited public in 1988 and changed its name to Dell Computer Corporation.

Rollins, the then president and COO. He, however, remained chairman of the board. Dell returned to become CEO in 2007 after the resignation of Kevin Rollins.\n\nBusiness Philosophy\n\nDell learned about business from his early entrepreneurial ventures as a kid and teenager. He emphasized affordable, high-quality machines and excellent customer service.\n\nDell published his autobiography, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry, in 1999.\n\n“I do think a founder has special permission to make sweeping changes across an organization.” – Michael Dell\n\nThis book recounts how he built a $100 billion business using only $1,000. Dell is today one of the wealthiest men in America, with $52 billion as of 2023.\n\nHis company, now called Dell Technologies, is a multi-billion dollar company and one of the largest technology firms in the world.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nOutside of his work at Dell Technologies, Michael Dell married Susan Lieberman, with whom he has four children.\n\nMichael and Susan Dell are known for their philanthropy and have donated millions of dollars to various causes, including education and healthcare initiatives.\n\nThe couple engages in philanthropic work through their foundation Michael and Susan Dell Foundation.\n\nClosing Remarks: Be Ambitious Like Michael Dell\n\nMichael Dell’s life and business career are a testament to the power of ambition and tenacity.\n\nHe is an inspiration to all who seek to have the world at their feet in the business arena.\n\nDell started as a computer enthusiast who later established a computer company that would become a luminary in its industry.\n\n“It’s through curiosity and looking at opportunities in new ways that we’ve always mapped our path at Dell. There’s always an opportunity to make a difference.” – Michael Dell\n\nMichael Dell Timeline\n\n1965:\n\nMichael Saul Dell is born in Houston, Texas.\n\n1980:\n\nDell gets his first Apple II computer, disassembles it, and learns how it works.\n\n1983:\n\nDell joins a pre-med program at the University of Texas and informally sells computer upgrades and kits that he assembles within his residential building.\n\n1984:\n\nDell makes $80,000 in sales and officially registers his company as PC’s Limited.

Next are three lessons from him we can look at.\n\nLesson One, Find a Target Market and Don’t Try To Please Everyone.\n\nMarketing begins with identifying your target market. Advertising to everyone results in a weak message because you’re trying to please everyone instead of a specific group.\n\nYou’ll have a much better conversion rate when you target specific people because you can address their needs as opposed to trying to address the needs of everyone.\n\nIt’s important to understand that you can have more than one target market. For example, with Dell computers, one target market may be students.\n\nAnother might be gamers, and a third might be business people. Each of these markets has specific needs, and when you address each, you have a better chance to provide the products and services that each target market wants.\n\nLesson Two, You Can Learn As You Go.\n\nFor example, if you’re starting a business, you don’t have to know everything about it before you get started. Instead, you can learn as you go. There are two approaches that I like to use.\n\nLearn more about your industry every day, week, or month, make it a habit, and never stop learning and reviewing information relevant to your company.\n\nSecond, you can learn as you need information. This approach can be very effective when you need information and can make immediate use of it.\n\nLesson Three, Dell Guides People and Inspires Them To Follow His Goals.\n\nThis approach is much more powerful than forcing people to follow your goals.\n\nUsing inspiration invokes emotions which will result in a better outcome. Therefore, people will want to be a part of and put effort into reaching the goal.\n\nThe key is inspiring people.\n\nOne key factor is presenting your goal so people will fully understand it. People will not engage without a clear understanding.\n\nNext, you can explain why you are doing it. When people fully understand the reason for your goal, they may get on board and even offer feedback and ideas.\n\nFinally, you can explain the benefit to them if the goal is reached.\n\nInstead of simply presenting a goal and telling people to achieve it, people are more likely to support your goal if they understand why you’re pursuing it.\n\n5 Facts Related to Dell\n\n1.
