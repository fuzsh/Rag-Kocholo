        "text": "In this success post, we are going to share the story of Michael Dell, an American businessman, philanthropist, investor, and author from Houston. Michael Dell is the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world’s largest technology infrastructure companies. He is ranked as the 28th richest person in the world by the Forbes list.\n\nAs of 2020, Michael Dell’s net worth is around $40 billion dollars.\n\nMichael Dell Early Life\n\nMichael Dell was born on the 23rd of February 1965 in Houston. Dell was born to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into the English of the original German Tal.\n\nDell is the son of Lorraine Charlotte and Alexander Dell. He attended Herod Elementary School in Houston. In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight.\n\nMichael Dell Career\n\nDell registered his company at “PC Limited” in the year 1984. The same year he changed the name of the company to Dell Computer Corporation. By now, his business had grown to include a few employees to take and fill orders and upgrade some of the basic machines.\n\nHe emphasized on customer focus and made quality products and excellent customer services his priorities. His convictions paid off, and the company sales grew manifold in the months to come.\n\nIn the year 1986, Dell revealed a 12-MegaHertz 286 processor, the fastest personal computer at that time. The price of this product compared favorably with a competing computer by IBM, and it became a huge success in the market.\n\nBy the year 1992, the company was ranked in Fortune magazine list of top 500 corporations. Dell, aged just 27 at that time, was the CEO of one of the most successful companies across the globe.\n\nDell launched its first servers in the year 1996 storage products in the year 1998. In the year 1998, he also founded the MSD capital LP to manage his family investment activities, which include publicly traded securities, real estate, and private equity activities.\n\nEntrepreneurship Lessons from Michael Dell\n\nAs now, we have looked into the life of Michael Dell. Now, let’s take a look at some of the best lessons we can learn from him:\n\n1. Innovate When You See an Opportunity\n\nMichael Dell is famous for saying: “There is got to be a better way of doing it”. When he sees an opportunity, he wants to take full advantage of it.\n\nMichael recognized the huge opportunity he had to offer better service and cheaper laptops in a market that was gradually warming up to the personal computers in a big way. He started his own company in the year 1984 and sold $80000 worth of devices in the first year itself.\n\n2. Fuel Your Passion\n\nMichael has been a vocal supporter of entrepreneurship across the globe. He wants founders to find what moves them and then go ahead with its full steam.\n\nHe says: “Whether you’ve found your calling, or if you’re still searching, passion should be the fire that drives your life’s work.” If you are not passionate about what you do, it will reflect on your work and performance, and eventually stop you from achieving your full potential.\n\n3. Failure is a Part of Life\n\nMichel has gone his whole career failing from one project to another, but he has always maintained that what he learned, in the end, is invaluable. In his words, “Recognize that there will be failures and acknowledge that there will be obstacles.\n\nBut you will learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others, for there is very little learning in success.” Nobody who has ever become successful has done so without fail. Accept it as part and parcel of your journey, focus on the lessons you can take away and move on."
