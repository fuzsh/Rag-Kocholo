The Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union from 5 December 1936 to 31 August 1991, with Frunze (Bishkek) serving as its capital. The Kirghiz SSR replaced the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast, and the Soviets saw to it that Islam was suppressed and replaced by atheism. The Communist Party of Kyrgyzstan governed the republic from 1936 to 1990, when the republic was renamed to the Socialist Republic of Kirghizia. On 31 August 1991, the Kirghiz SSR became the independent "Republic of Kyrgyzstan".
