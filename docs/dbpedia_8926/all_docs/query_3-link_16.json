        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nA Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, most of the territory of the present-day Kyrgyz Republic was formally annexed to the Russian Empire in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. The Kyrgyz Republic became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in 2005 and 2010 resulted in the ouster of the country’s first two presidents, Askar AKAEV and Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Interim President Roza OTUNBAEVA led a transitional government and following a nation-wide election, President Almazbek ATAMBAEV was sworn in as president in 2011. In 2017, ATAMBAEV became the first Kyrgyzstani president to step down after serving one full six-year term as required in the country’s constitution. Former prime minister and ruling Social-Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan member Sooronbay JEENBEKOV replaced him after winning an October 2017 presidential election that was the most competitive in the country’s history, although international and local election observers noted cases of vote buying and abuse of public resources. The president holds substantial powers as head of state even though the prime minister oversees the Kyrgyzstani Government and selects most cabinet members. The president represents the country internationally and can sign or veto laws, call for new elections, and nominate Supreme Court judges, cabinet members for posts related to security or defense, and numerous other high-level positions. Continuing concerns for the Kyrgyz Republic include the trajectory of democratization, endemic corruption, a history of tense, and at times violent, interethnic relations, border security vulnerabilities, and potential terrorist threats.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Asia, west of China, south of Kazakhstan\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n41 00 N, 75 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAsia\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 199,951 sq km\n\nland: 191,801 sq km\n\nwater: 8,150 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 88\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than South Dakota\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 4,573 km\n\nborder countries (4): China 1063 km, Kazakhstan 1212 km, Tajikistan 984 km, Uzbekistan 1314 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km(landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\ndry continental to polar in high Tien Shan Mountains;

Cotton, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although only cotton is exported in any quantity. Other exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and - in some years - electricity. The country has sought to attract foreign investment to expand its export base, including construction of hydroelectric dams, but a difficult investment climate and an ongoing legal battle with a Canadian firm over the joint ownership structure of the nation’s largest gold mine deter potential investors. Remittances from Kyrgyz migrant workers, predominantly in Russia and Kazakhstan, are equivalent to more than one-quarter of Kyrgyzstan’s GDP.Following independence, Kyrgyzstan rapidly implemented market reforms, such as improving the regulatory system and instituting land reform. In 1998, Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. The government has privatized much of its ownership shares in public enterprises. Despite these reforms, the country suffered a severe drop in production in the early 1990s and has again faced slow growth in recent years as the global financial crisis and declining oil prices have dampened economies across Central Asia. The Kyrgyz government remains dependent on foreign donor support to finance its annual budget deficit of approximately 3 to 5% of GDP.Kyrgyz leaders hope the country’s August 2015 accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) will bolster trade and investment, but slowing economies in Russia and China and low commodity prices continue to hamper economic growth. Large-scale trade and investment pledged by Kyrgyz leaders has been slow to develop. Many Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and politicians complain that non-tariff measures imposed by other EAEU member states are hurting certain sectors of the Kyrgyz economy, such as meat and dairy production, in which they have comparative advantage. Since acceding to the EAEU, the Kyrgyz Republic has continued harmonizing its laws and regulations to meet EAEU standards, though many local entrepreneurs believe this process as disjointed and incomplete. Kyrgyzstan’s economic development continues to be hampered by corruption, lack of administrative transparency, lack of diversity in domestic industries, and difficulty attracting foreign aid and investment.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$23.15 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$22.14 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$21.22 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 144\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$7.565 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n4.6% (2017 est.)\n\n4.3% (2016 est.)\n\n3.9% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 63\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$3,700 (2017 est.)\n\n$3,600 (2016 est.)\n\n$3,500 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 183\n\nGross national saving\n\n27.3% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n20.1% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n18.3% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 42\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 85.4% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 18.9% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 33.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 1.8% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 39.7% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -79% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 14.6% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 31.2% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 54.2% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncotton, potatoes, vegetables, grapes, fruits and berries;
