        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nA Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, Kyrgyzstan was annexed by Russia in 1864; it achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Nationwide demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of President Askar AKAYEV, who had run the country since 1990. Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIYEV. Current concerns include: privatization of state-owned enterprises, expansion of democracy and political freedoms, reduction of corruption, improving interethnic relations, and combating terrorism.\n\n» Geography\n\n» People\n\n» Government\n\n» Economy\n\n» Communications\n\n» Transportation\n\n» Military\n\n» Transnational Issues\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Asia, west of China\n\nGeographic Coordinates\n\n41 00 N, 75 00 E\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 198,500 sq km;

Cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although only tobacco and cotton are exported in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and electricity. Kyrgyzstan has been progressive in carrying out market reforms, such as an improved regulatory system and land reform. Kyrgyzstan was the first CIS country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of the government’s stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and exports began to increase. Kyrgyzstan has distinguished itself by adopting relatively liberal economic policies. The drop in output at the Kumtor gold mine sparked a 0.5% decline in GDP in 2002, but GDP growth bounced back in 2003-05. The government has made steady strides in controlling its substantial fiscal deficit and reduced the deficit to 1% of GDP in 2005. The government and international financial institutions have been engaged in a comprehensive medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy, and in 2005 agreed to pursue much-needed tax reform. Progress fighting corruption, further restructuring of domestic industry, and success in attracting foreign investment are keys to future growth.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$9.033 billion (2005 est.)\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$2.041 billion (2005 est.)\n\nGDP – real growth rate\n\n2% (2005 est.)\n\nGDP – per capita (PPP)\n\n$1,800 (2005 est.)\n\nGDP – composition by sector\n\nagriculture: 37.1%; industry: 21.9%; services: 41% (2005 est.)\n\nLabor Force\n\n2.7 million (2000)\n\nLabor Force – By Occupation\n\nagriculture 55%, industry 15%, services 30% (2000 est.)\n\nUnemployment Rate\n\n18% (2004 est.)\n\nPopulation Below Poverty Line\n\n40% (2004 est.)\n\nHousehold Income or Consumption by Percentage Share\n\nlowest 10%: 3.9%; highest 10%: 23.3% (2001)\n\nDistribution of Family Income – Gini Index\n\n29 (2001)\n\nInflation Rate (Consumer Prices)\n\n4.2% (2005 est.)\n\nInvestment (gross fixed)\n\n15% of GDP (2005 est.)\n\nBudget\n\nrevenues: $516.3 million; expenditures: $539.9 million; including capital expenditures of $NA (2005 est.)\n\nAgriculture – Products\n\ntobacco, cotton, potatoes, vegetables, grapes, fruits and berries; sheep, goats, cattle, wool\n\nIndustries\n\nsmall machinery, textiles, food processing, cement, shoes, sawn logs, refrigerators, furniture, electric motors, gold, rare earth metals\n\nIndustrial Production Growth Rate\n\n7.1% (2004 est.)\n\nElectricity – Production\n\n13.77 billion kWh (2003)\n\nElectricity – Consumption\n\n8.783 billion kWh (2003)\n\nElectricity – Exports\n\n4.13 billion kWh (2003)\n\nElectricity – Imports\n\n108 million kWh (2003)\n\nOil – Production\n\n1,990 bbl/day (2003)\n\nOil – Consumption\n\n11,000 bbl/day (2003 est.)\n\nOil – Exports\n\nNA bbl/day\n\nOil – Imports\n\nNA bbl/day\n\nNatural Gas – Production\n\n6 million cu m (2003 est.)\n\nNatural Gas – Consumption\n\n1.5 billion cu m (2004 est.)\n\nNatural Gas – Exports\n\n0 cu m (2004 est.)\n\nNatural Gas – Imports\n\n1.5 billion cu m (2004 est.)\n\nCurrent Account Balance\n\n$-77.02 million (2005 est.)\n\nExports\n\n$759 million f.o.b.
