        "text": "Background\n\nA Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, most of the territory of present-day Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed by the Russian Empire in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1926 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in 2005 and 2010 resulted in the ouster of the countryâs first two presidents, Askar AKAEV and Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Interim President Roza OTUNBAEVA led a transitional government and following a nation-wide election, President Almazbek ATAMBAEV was sworn in as president in 2011. In 2017, ATAMBAEV became the first Kyrgyzstani president to step down after serving one full six-year term as required at the time in the countryâs constitution. Former prime minister and ruling Social-Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan member, Sooronbay JEENBEKOV, replaced him after winning the 2017 presidential election, which was the most competitive in the countryâs history, although international and local election observers noted cases of vote buying and abuse of public resources. In October 2020, protests against parliamentary election results spread across Kyrgyzstan, leading to JEENBEKOVâs resignation from the presidency, and catapulting previously imprisoned Sadyr JAPAROV to acting president. In January 2021, Kyrgyzstanis formally elected JAPAROV as president and approved a referendum to move Kyrgyzstan from a parliamentary to a presidential system. In April 2021, Kyrgyzstanis voted in favor of draft constitutional changes that consolidated power in the presidency. Pro-government parties won a majority in the Jogorku Kenesh (Kyrgyzstanâs legislature) in November 2021 elections. Continuing concerns for Kyrgyzstan include the trajectory of democratization, endemic corruption, tense regional relations, vulnerabilities due to climate change, border security vulnerabilities, and potential terrorist threats.\n\nDemographic profile\n\nKyrgyzstan is a sparsely populated country whose population is unevenly distributed.Â More than 50% of the population lives in or around the two cities of Bishkek and Osh and their surrounding districts, which together account for about 12% of the countryâs area.Â Kyrgyzstanâs population continues to grow rapidly owing to its high fertility rate and the traditional preference for larger families, a low mortality rate, a growing share of women of reproductive age, and measures to support families with children. The country has a youthful age structure; over 45% of the population is under the age of 25 as of 2022.Â Nevertheless, Kyrgyzstan is transitioning from an agricultural society with high fertility and mortality rates to an industrial society with lower fertility and mortality rates.\n\nAs part of the USSR, Kyrgyzstanâs rapid population growth was not problematic because its needs were redistributed among the Soviet States.Â As an independent state, however, population growth became burdensome.Â International labor migration continues to serve as a safety valve that decreases pressure on the labor market and resources (healthcare, education, and pensions), while also reducing poverty through much-needed remittances.Â The main destinations for labor migrants are Russia and Kazakhstan, where wages are higher; almost a third of Kyrgyzstanâs working-age population migrates to Russia alone.Â Outmigration was most pronounced in the 1990s, after the collapse of the USSR, when ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Germans left Kyrgyzstan, changing the proportion of ethnic Kyrgyz in the country from barely 50% in 1992 to almost three-quarters today.\n\nWhile Kyrgyzstan is a net emigration country, it does receive immigrants.Â The majority of immigrants are from the Commonwealth of Independent States â particularly Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan â but more recent arrivals also include persons from China, Turkey, and Turkmenistan.Â Chinese immigrants work primarily in construction and gold mining, while Turkish immigrants mainly work in construction, trade, education, and services.Â Border areas between Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan experience irregular migration, but many of these migrants plan to move on to Europe.\n\nConstitution\n\nhistory: previous 1993, 2007, 2010; latest approved by referendum in April 2021 that transitioned Kyrgyzstan from a parliamentary to a presidential system, and implemented changes that allow the president to serve for two 5-year terms rather than one 6-year term, reduced the number of seats in Kyrgyzstan's legislature from 120 to 90, and established a Kurultay - a public advisory council\n\namendments: proposed as a draft law by the majority of the Supreme Council membership or by petition of 300,000 voters; passage requires at least two-thirds majority vote of the Council membership in each of at least three readings of the draft two months apart; the draft may be submitted to a referendum if approved by two thirds of the Council membership; adoption requires the signature of the president\n\nTelecommunication systems\n\ngeneral assessment: the countryâs telecom sector (specifically the mobile segment) has been able to prosper; Kyrgyzstan has opened up its telecom market to competition; the mobile market has achieved high levels of penetration (140% in 2021) along with a fairly competitive operating environment with four major players; mobile broadband has come along strongly, reaching over 125% penetration in 2019 before falling back slightly during the COVID-19 crisis; slow-to-moderate growth is expected for both segments in coming years, supported by the anticipated rollout of 5G services which began testing in 2022 with a pilot service to follow some time in 2023 (2022)\n\ndomestic: fixed-line subscriptions 5 per 100; mobile-cellular subscribership up to over 130 per 100 persons (2021)\n\ninternational: country code - 996; connections with other CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States, 9 members post-Soviet Republics in EU) countries by landline or microwave radio relay and with other countries by leased connections with Moscow international gateway switch and by satellite; satellite earth stations - 2 (1 Intersputnik, 1 Intelsat) (2019)\n\nMilitary - note\n\nKyrgyzstan has been a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) since 1994 and contributes troops to CSTO's rapid reaction force; it also started a relationship with NATO in 1992 and joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1994\n\nthe Kyrgyz militaryâs primary responsibility is defense of the countryâs sovereignty and territory, although it also has some internal security duties; elements of the military were called out in 2020 to respond to post-election demonstrations for example, and the National Guardâs missions include counterterrorism, responding to emergencies, and the protection of government facilities; the military also participates in UN and CSTO peacekeeping missions; border disputes with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, as well as the threat posed by militant Islamic groups, have been particular areas of concern for both the military and internal security forces; the militaryâs closest security partner is Russia, which provides training and material assistance, and maintains a presence in the country, including an airbase; the military also conducts training with other regional countries such as India, traditionally with a focus on counterterrorism\n\nthe Kyrgyz military was formed in 1992 from Soviet Army units then based in Kyrgyzstan following the dissolution of the USSR; while the current organization continues to be based on those former Soviet formations, specific information is limited and varied; the Armyâs principal combat units are reportedly a few small Soviet-style âmotor rifleâ (mechanized) infantry brigades, plus brigades of mountain infantry, special forces, and artillery; the National Guard has some rapid reaction and special forces units; the Air Defense Forces reportedly have only a few operational combat helicopters (2023)"
