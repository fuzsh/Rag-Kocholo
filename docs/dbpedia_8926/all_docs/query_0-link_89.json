        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nA Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions, most of the territory of present-day Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed by the Russian Empire in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1926 and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide demonstrations in 2005 and 2010 resulted in the ouster of the countryâs first two presidents, Askar AKAEV and Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Interim President Roza OTUNBAEVA led a transitional government and following a nation-wide election, President Almazbek ATAMBAEV was sworn in as president in 2011. In 2017, ATAMBAEV became the first Kyrgyzstani president to step down after serving one full six-year term as required in the countryâs constitution. Former prime minister and ruling Social-Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan member, Sooronbay JEENBEKOV, replaced him after winning the 2017 presidential election, which was the most competitive in the countryâs history, although international and local election observers noted cases of vote buying and abuse of public resources. In October 2020, protests against legislative election results spread across Kyrgyzstan, leading to JEENBEKOVâs resignation from the presidency, and catapulting previously imprisoned Sadyr JAPAROV to acting president. In January 2021, Kyrgyzstanis formerly elected JAPAROV as president and approved a referendum to move Kyrgyzstan from a parliamentary to a presidential system. In April 2021, Kyrgyzstanis voted in favor of draft constitutional changes that consolidated power in the presidency. Pro-government parties won a majority in the Jogorku Kenesh (Kyrgyzstanâs legislature) in November 2021 elections. Continuing concerns for Kyrgyzstan include the trajectory of democratization, endemic corruption, a history of tense, and at times violent, interethnic relations, border security vulnerabilities, and potential terrorist threats.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Asia, west of China, south of Kazakhstan\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n41 00 N, 75 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAsia\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 199,951 sq km\n\nland: 191,801 sq km\n\nwater: 8,150 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 87\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than South Dakota\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 4,573 km\n\nborder countries (4): China 1,063 km; Kazakhstan 1,212 km; Tajikistan 984 km; Uzbekistan 1,314 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\ndry continental to polar in high Tien Shan Mountains; subtropical in southwest (Fergana Valley); temperate in northern foothill zone\n\nTerrain\n\npeaks of the Tien Shan mountain range and associated valleys and basins encompass the entire country\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Jengish Chokusu (Pik Pobedy) 7,439 m\n\nlowest point: Kara-Daryya (Karadar'ya) 132 m\n\nmean elevation: 2,988 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nabundant hydropower; gold, rare earth metals; locally exploitable coal, oil, and natural gas; other deposits of nepheline, mercury, bismuth, lead, and zinc\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 55.4% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 6.7% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.4% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 48.3% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 5.1% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 39.5% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n10,043 sq km (2020)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nsalt water lake(s): Ozero Issyk-Kul 6,240 sq km\n\nnote - second largest saline lake after the Caspian Sea; second highest mountain lake after Lake Titicaca; it is an endorheic mountain basin; although surrounded by snow capped mountains it never freezes\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\nSyr Darya river source (shared with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan [m] ) - 3,078 km\n\nnote â [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nInternal (endorheic basin) drainage: Tarim Basin (1,152,448 sq km), (Aral Sea basin) Amu Darya (534,739 sq km), Syr Darya (782,617 sq km)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe vast majority of Kyrgyzstanis live in rural areas; densest population settlement is to the north in and around the capital, Bishkek, followed by Osh in the west; the least densely populated area is the east, southeast in the Tien Shan mountains\n\nNatural hazards\n\nmajor flooding during snow melt; prone to earthquakes\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked; entirely mountainous, dominated by the Tien Shan range; 94% of the country is 1,000 m above sea level with an average elevation of 2,750 m; many tall peaks, glaciers, and high-altitude lakes\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n6,071,750 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 112\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Kyrgyzstani(s)\n\nadjective: Kyrgyzstani\n\nEthnic groups\n\nKyrgyz 73.8%, Uzbek 14.8%, Russian 5.1%, Dungan 1.1%, other 5.2% (includes Uyghur, Tajik, Turk, Kazakh, Tatar, Ukrainian, Korean, German) (2021 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nKyrgyz (official) 71.4%, Uzbek 14.4%, Russian (official) 9%, other 5.2% (2009 est.)\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nÐÒ¯Ð¹Ð½Ó©Ð»Ò¯Ðº ÑÐ°ÐºÑÑÐ»Ð°Ñ ÐºÐ¸ÑÐµÐ±Ð¸, Ð½ÐµÐ³Ð¸Ð·Ð³Ð¸ Ð¼Ð°Ð°Ð»ÑÐ¼Ð°ÑÑÑÐ½ Ð¼Ð°Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ð»Ò¯Ò¯ Ð±ÑÐ»Ð°Ð³Ñ.

The country has a youthful age structure; over 45% of the population is under the age of 25 as of 2022.Â Nevertheless, Kyrgyzstan is transitioning from an agricultural society with high fertility and mortality rates to an industrial society with lower fertility and mortality rates.\n\nAs part of the USSR, Kyrgyzstanâs rapid population growth was not problematic because its needs were redistributed among the Soviet States.Â As an independent state, however, population growth became burdensome.Â International labor migration continues to serve as a safety valve that decreases pressure on the labor market and resources (healthcare, education, and pensions), while also reducing poverty through much-needed remittances.Â The main destinations for labor migrants are Russia and Kazakhstan, where wages are higher; almost a third of Kyrgyzstanâs working-age population migrates to Russia alone.Â Outmigration was most pronounced in the 1990s, after the collapse of the USSR, when ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Germans left Kyrgyzstan, changing the proportion of ethnic Kyrgyz in the country from barely 50% in 1992 to almost three-quarters today.\n\nWhile Kyrgyzstan is a net emigration country, it does receive immigrants.Â The majority of immigrants are from the Commonwealth of Independent States â particularly Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan â but more recent arrivals also include persons from China, Turkey, and Turkmenistan.Â Chinese immigrants work primarily in construction and gold mining, while Turkish immigrants mainly work in construction, trade, education, and services.Â Border areas between Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan experience irregular migration, but many of these migrants plan to move on to Europe.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 30.39% (male 930,455/female 882,137)\n\n15-24 years: 15.7% (male 475,915/female 460,604)\n\n25-54 years: 40.02% (male 1,172,719/female 1,214,624)\n\n55-64 years: 8.09% (male 210,994/female 271,480)\n\n65 years and over: 5.8% (male 132,134/female 213,835) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 63.5\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 56.4\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 7.2\n\npotential support ratio: 13.9 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 27.3 years\n\nmale: 26.1 years\n\nfemale: 28.5 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 147\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.86% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 110\n\nBirth rate\n\n19.54 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 72\n\nDeath rate\n\n6.12 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 151\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-4.87 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 201\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe vast majority of Kyrgyzstanis live in rural areas;

Cotton, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products, although only cotton is exported in any quantity. Other exports include gold, mercury, uranium, natural gas, and - in some years - electricity. The country has sought to attract foreign investment to expand its export base, including construction of hydroelectric dams, but a difficult investment climate and an ongoing legal battle with a Canadian firm over the joint ownership structure of the nationâs largest gold mine deter potential investors. Remittances from Kyrgyz migrant workers, predominantly in Russia and Kazakhstan, are equivalent to more than one-quarter of Kyrgyzstanâs GDP.\n\nÂ\n\nFollowing independence, Kyrgyzstan rapidly implemented market reforms, such as improving the regulatory system and instituting land reform. In 1998, Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. The government has privatized much of its ownership shares in public enterprises. Despite these reforms, the country suffered a severe drop in production in the early 1990s and has again faced slow growth in recent years as the global financial crisis and declining oil prices have dampened economies across Central Asia. The Kyrgyz government remains dependent on foreign donor support to finance its annual budget deficit of approximately 3 to 5% of GDP.\n\nÂ\n\nKyrgyz leaders hope the countryâs August 2015 accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) will bolster trade and investment, but slowing economies in Russia and China and low commodity prices continue to hamper economic growth. Large-scale trade and investment pledged by Kyrgyz leaders has been slow to develop. Many Kyrgyz entrepreneurs and politicians complain that non-tariff measures imposed by other EAEU member states are hurting certain sectors of the Kyrgyz economy, such as meat and dairy production, in which they have comparative advantage. Since acceding to the EAEU, the Kyrgyz Republic has continued harmonizing its laws and regulations to meet EAEU standards, though many local entrepreneurs believe this process as disjointed and incomplete. Kyrgyzstanâs economic development continues to be hampered by corruption, lack of administrative transparency, lack of diversity in domestic industries, and difficulty attracting foreign aid and investment.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$31.02 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$33.95 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$32.46 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 136\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n4.6% (2017 est.)\n\n4.3% (2016 est.)\n\n3.9% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 59\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$4,700 (2020 est.)\n\n$5,300 (2019 est.)\n\n$5,100 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 176\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$8.442 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n1.1% (2019 est.)\n\n1.5% (2018 est.)\n\n3.1% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 72\n\nCredit ratings\n\nMoody's rating: B2 (2015)\n\nStandard & Poors rating: NR (2016)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP -
