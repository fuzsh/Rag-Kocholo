        "text": "Thursday, 28 January 2021, Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic: Sadyr Nurgozhoevich Japarov was installed as the eight President of the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nAccording to the Kyrgyz constitution, the president “is the symbol of the unity of people and state power, and is the guarantor of the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, and of an individual and citizen.” The president is directly elected for no more than one six-year term by the Kyrgyz electorate. The office of president was established in 1990 replacing the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet that existed, in different forms, from 1927 whilst the country was known as the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nKyrgyzstan’s president is the country’s head of state, appoints the prime minister, all cabinet members, and directs foreign policy.\n\nPresident Japarov, in his capacity then as prime minister, had been acting as the country’s presidential head since 16 October 2020 after the resignation of President Sooronbay Jeenbekov.\n\nOn 10 January 2021, Japarov was elected as President of Kyrgyzstan, garnering over 79% of the votes. On the same day, a proposal to strengthen the role of the presidency and to decrease the powers of the Parliament was adopted with more than 80% of the votes. His inauguration on 28 January took place at the Philarmonic Hall Toktogul Satylganov. President Japarov is known for his pro-Russian policies but also for his eagerness to bring financial stability to Kyrgyzstan.\n\nDuring the event, the special representative of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, Zhanseit Tuimebayev, read out his welcoming message, and the greeting from the President of the European Council Charles Michel was read out by the EU Special Representative for Central Asia, Ambassador Peter Burian.\n\nFor further information\n\nhttp://president.kg/ru/sobytiya/18479_fotoreportagh_ceremoniya_vstupleniya_sadira_ghaparova_vdolghnost_prezidenta_kirgizskoy_respubliki\n\nPicture by Kyrgyz Presidency."
