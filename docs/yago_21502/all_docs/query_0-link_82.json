        "text": "I liked it. I wasn’t crazy about the visuals but I see what they were going for. (I prefer B&W). And I’m not a big Madonna fan either. Or Beatty. Still, I love the Tracy character.\n\n1990 was 25 years ago and I’d love to see another remake made with new actors. Who would you cast in a new film?\n\nOffhand I could see George Clooney in the lead role. I think he’d do a fine job.\n\nIs Robert Downey Jr tall enough? I don’t know. I like him though.\n\nI don’t remember in the comic strip if Tess Trueheart’s hair was red of blond. I thought she was a blond. She was a redhead in the latest film. Who would play her?\n\nAlso, what would you like the plot to be? Any major villain from the series you’d like to see them focus on? Breathless Mahoney has already been used. Cueball might be interesting but I fear he’d run the risk of being compared to Lex Luthor. Flattop is a favorite of mine.\n\nI don’t know if they *had* a villain like this, but one villain type I’d like to see them use would be a Dr Fu-Manchu type. It wouldn’t even have to be male. I saw a good Victor Mature film called The Shanghai Gesture and the main villainess in that movie was Mother\" Gin Sling, played by Ona Munson. She was really good in that role and her type would make a heckuva good villain in a new Tracy film. J\n\nI liked it. I wasn’t crazy about the visuals but I see what they were going for. (I prefer B&W)...\n\nI understand why they went with only primary and secondary colors (they wanted it to look like a live-action comic book), but that look didn't really work for me. I'd much rather they would have gone with a more natural/realistic color palette, or black and white.\n\n...1990 was 25 years ago and I’d love to see another remake made with new actors. Who would you cast in a new film? Offhand I could see George Clooney in the lead role. I think he’d do a fine job...\n\nI think Clooney would be a good choice. I know this was something of a \"pet\" project for Beatty, but I wish he would have stayed behind the camera and cast someone else to play Tracy because his performance in the movie didn't remind me of the Dick Tracy I remember from the comic strip.\n\nA couple of years ago there was a rumor going around that Beatty wanted to make a sequel to Dick Tracy and wanted to play the character again. I, for one, hope that doesn't happen.\n\n...Is Robert Downey Jr tall enough? I don’t know. I like him though...\n\nRobert Downey Jr. is reportedly 5'8-1/2\" tall. I don't know how tall Tracy is supposed to be, but I always got the impression that he was of an above-average height. Then again, Clooney is allegedly 5'11\", so he's not what I'd call \"towering\" either.\n\n...I don’t remember in the comic strip if Tess Trueheart’s hair was red of blond. I thought she was a blond. She was a redhead in the latest film...\n\nShe was blonde in the comic strip. And since you mentioned Madonna, I've never thought she was attractive except for her appearance in this movie (probably because she had to gain weight to \"fill in\" her wardrobe, and I prefer curvy women).\n\nMorgan Conway played Tracy in the 1940s.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: RKO's earliest publicity photos posed Conway in profile, hoping to emulate Gould's square-jawed caricatures. Although this screen Tracy didn't resemble the print Tracy physically, Conway's dramatic interpretation was faithful; he gave the role an understated, businesslike quality totally in keeping with a police procedural. Morgan Conway is considered by many (including Dick Tracy writer Max Allan Collins\n\n) to be the best screen Dick Tracy.\n\nI think that would be important. The business-like quality of the character. Though one might say Beatty did this as well, he seems almost too stoic for me. But I guess he did ok. But to revisit the character? How old is Beatty now anyway? I’m not sure what it would look like to have grampa out there trying to be Dick Tracy…maybe like the Simpsons’ Montgomery Burns trying to play the role lol"
