        "text": "Warren Beatty has been pretty quiet and reclusive the last few years. But the famed Oscar winning director and writer pulled off a surprise move tonight with an impromptu special on TCM.\n\nBeatty appeared on the special in character as Dick Tracy and as himself. As you know, Beatty acted in and directed the movie “Dick Tracy” thirty three years ago. The movie won high praise — and three Oscars — and was a big hit. Al Pacino was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Madonna sang a now classic Stephen Sondheim song. Subsequently, Beatty bought the rights to the character out of a bankruptcy. (Long story there.)\n\nIn 2008, Beatty cut a short film playing Tracy being interviewed by Leonard Maltin on TCM. This was said to be to extend the copyright.\n\nTonight, Maltin and Ben Mankiewicz participated in the new piece. This time, however, Beatty also appeared as himself, talking to Dick Tracy in a Zoom set up. At the end, he and “Dick Tracy” are shown having lunch at the Polo Lounge.\n\nBeatty makes the point several times that he owns the rights to Dick Tracy. Then he says he will make a new film about an older Tracy, and this time make it “more real” and less stylistic than the original film.\n\nSince Warren Beatty never does TV and rarely does interviews, this was something to behold. I can’t wait for more details. Anyway, it was great to see Beatty after a long period of silence."
