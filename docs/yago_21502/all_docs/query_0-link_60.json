        "text": "Long before comic-book movies ruled the global box office, the genre only had Superman, Batman, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to boast about. But in 1990 Warren Beatty took a stab at winning fanboy’s hard-earned money with the big-budget adaptation of 1930s comic strip hero Dick Tracy.\n\nBased on the Chester Gould comic-strip character of the same name, “Dick Tracy” re-imagined a stylized, 1930s world where law and justice matters and all the bad guys, well, are kind of deformed. This film was a passion project for Warren Beatty who produced, directed, and starred in the film as Dick Tracy. The film featured Al Pacino, Madonna, Glenne Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Dustin Hoffman, Dick Van Dyke, and many others in supporting roles. Now, as “Dick Tracy” turns 30 years old, it’s time to look back at a film that still hasn’t gotten the respect it deserves.\n\nThe film follows Detective Dick Tracy (Beatty), who is waist-deep in a crime war against the city’s mob lead by Alphonse “Big Boy” Caprice (Al Pacino). Big Boy’s crime syndicate is aggressively taking over small businesses in the city and so far the police department has been unable to stop Big Boy and his freaky band of henchmen. While this is going on, Dick Tracy also has to juggle his relationship with the long-suffering Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who wants a commitment from Tracy.\n\nUnfortunately for Tess, Dick Tracy is always putting his work ahead of her, and until Big Boy is behind bars this seems unlikely to change. I don’t think Dick Tracy was doing this on purpose, but it came off that way more often than not. Their relationship gets even stranger thanks to the arrival of a foul-mouthed nameless orphan played by Charlie Korsmo. And if that wasn’t enough to deal with, Dick Tracy also has to fight off the advances of nightclub singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna). But to be fair, this was the “Blonde Ambition” era Madonna, so it was only natural for Tracy to be tempted by her charms.\n\nBefore the film’s release, my knowledge of Dick Tracy was limited. I knew he was a cop who always wore yellow, but that was about it. I was not aware of his rogue’s gallery or even that Tracy’s adventures took place during the Great Depression. One thing I do remember well is that for months before the movie opened in theaters, every comic book I read had at least one ad for the movie. I think more than the trailers and tv spots, it was the comic book advertisements that made me want to see the movie on the big screen.\n\nOnce I got the chance to see the movie I was blown away by Warren Beatty’s production. From the colors to the music to the cartoonish villains, “Dick Tracy” felt like a comic book came to life. Sure, the title hero didn’t have super strength or x-ray vision, but Dick Tracy was a superhero nonetheless. The movie was so good I ended up seeing it multiple times in multiple states! First at home in Boston, then during my summer vacation in the Outer Banks, then during a weekend in Connecticut. And each time I noticed something new in “Dick Tracy.”\n\nThe casting for the film is brilliant from top to bottom. Warren Beatty had the perfect face to play the squared jawed detective, and he looked awesome in the yellow hat an trenchcoat. His scenes with the Kid are terrific, one of my favorite scenes comes after Tracy has been framed for murder and the two ask each other how the food is in jail and at the orphanage. It’s a simple scene, but quite effective I thought because we got to see Dick Tracy grow from tough cop to father figure during the film.\n\nMadonna as Breathless Mahoney was quite a surprise in 1990. The singer was probably at the height of her powers, but her acting career had been less than stellar. It’s easy to forget now, but casting Madonna for this part was a big gamble on Warren Beatty’s part. Then again, I seem to recall the two were dating at the time or had dated, so maybe he had no choice in the matter. Whatever the reason was, I think it paid off because this might be Madonna’s best acting work.\n\nDick Van Dyke is also terrific as the city’s corrupt District Attorney John Fletcher. It’s a small role, but Van Dyke makes the most of his screen time. Other supporting characters make their mark as well, such as Dick Tracy’s two buddies at the police department, Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles and Mandy Patinkin as 88 Keys. All of them get a moment to shine, even the cook at the diner Tracy and Tess are always eating at gets a couple of good lines.\n\nHowever, to the surprise of no one, the scene-stealer in “Dick Tracy” is Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice. His transformation is uncanny and I’m not just talking about the awesome makeup he wears. My favorite Big Boy scenes are when he “teaches” Breathless Mahoney how to do her job and when he asks his henchmen whether there are any generals in their ranks. But there are other great moments like when he’s dancing in his office after Dick Tracy lands in jail. His rants to Tess in the film’s final act still make me laugh today.\n\nI had seen Al Pacino in other movies before this, but “Dick Tracy” is the movie where I realized just how good an actor Al Pacino is. He became a different person here and it looked like he had a ball doing this movie. Big Boy maybe the bad guy of the movie but Pacino made him a very likable character. Pacino’s hard work in “Dick Tracy” paid off with an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nPacino wasn’t alone at the Academy Awards in the following years. Production designer Richard Sylbert and set decorator Rick Simpson won Best Art Direction, while John Caglione Jr. and Doug Drexler won the Oscar for Best Makeup. Stephen Sondheim also walked away with Oscar gold for Best Original Song “Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)” which Madonna performed at the ceremony. In total, “Dick Tracy” was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, which I believe was a record for a comic book movie. A record that stood (I believe) until “Black Panther” along a couple of years ago.\n\nBut even with all those awards, “Dick Tracy” is never given the respect I think it deserves. To me, this is still one of the best comic book movies from my childhood. “Dick Tracy” had everything I could have asked for from a comic book movie in 1990: stellar visual effects, a phenomenal cast, and even a love triangle. The film brought the Dick Tracy characters to a brand new generation of fans many of which had never heard of Tracy before.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about Warren Beatty’s film is that we never had a “Dick Tracy” sequel. I know Warren Beatty held the right for a long time (he may still own them) but he hasn’t done much with them other than a brief appearance as Tracy on TCM over a decade ago. Whoever has the right should reboot Dick Tracy now so that a brand new generation can become fans like I did 30 years ago."
