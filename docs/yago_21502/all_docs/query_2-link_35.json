        "text": "When Warren Beatty first directed and starred in the big screen adaptation of Dick Tracy back in 1990, there was surely no way he thought he would still be suiting up as the character 33 years later. And yet, here we are. Beatty has filmed a new special featuring the character, and it premieres Friday night, February 10, on TCM.\n\nDick Tracy Special: Tracy Zooms In is a brand new half-hour special that will be making its debut on the network. When reached for comment, TCM sent along a brief description of what to expect. \"Film experts Leonard Maltin and Ben Mankiewicz interview famous detective Dick Tracy about his life and career, with a surprise appearance by legendary actor and director Warren Beatty,\" it reads.\n\nWhy was this special made? Most likely as a way for Beatty to continue his hold on the film rights for the character. After all, this isn't the first time a new special featuring the yellow-coated cop has been made. Back in 2008, Dick Tracy Special aired on TCM, featuring Maltin interviewing Beatty in character as Tracy. If you haven't seen it, YouTube is your friend.\n\nWith a title like Tracy Zooms In, chances are this will be a virtual interview done over Zoom rather than having Tracy in the room with Maltin and Mankiewicz. It's also interesting to note that, based on the description, Beatty will also appear as himself, which was not the case for the original Dick Tracy Special.\n\nWhether or not this will actually lead to a new Dick Tracy movie is unknown, though not very likely. If the special from 15 years ago didn't help, why would this one? Perhaps now, though, they should just reboot the franchise with a younger Tracy, earlier in his career.\n\nWhatever the case, fans of the film can get a small taste of the character when Dick Tracy Special: Tracy Zooms In premieres Friday, February 10, at 10:30 PM ET/PT on TCM."
