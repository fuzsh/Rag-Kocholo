        "text": "Turner Classic Movies is an essential channel for the preservation of film culture, and frequently a necessary oasis against the noise and clutter of contemporary pop culture. But twice now it has acted as what appears to be an active participant in a bizarre battle between a Hollywood icon and lawyers looking to take away one of his favorite toys. This led to Friday night’s surprising (and very meme-able) 30-minute broadcast: Tracy Zooms In.\n\nIn 1990, Warren Beatty directed himself as the tech-forward police detective Dick Tracy, alongside Al Pacino and Madonna, and a slew of phenomenal people like Dick Van Dyke, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O’Hara, and Mary Woronov in an early stab at the comic book movie\n\nThe studio hoped it was launching a franchise at the time, but soon after the premiere the project got tied up in a series of byzantine lawsuits. Ownership of the intellectual property has passed between Disney, Tribune Media Services (who distributed the newspaper comic strip since its debut in the Detroit Mirror in the early 1930s), and Beatty himself. Here’s where it gets fun.\n\nIn order to keep hold of the rights, Beatty must, periodically, get back into his yellow duster and appear somewhere as the character Dick Tracy. And Turner Classic Movies is more than eager to help him with this ruse.\n\nIndeed, they’ve done it before. The first time was in 2010. A California judge ruled that “commencement of principal photography of his television special on November 8, 2008 was sufficient for him to retain the Dick Tracy rights.” That 30-minute special (which you can watch here) has some outdoor photography and schtick, but is mostly “Dick Tracy” chatting with film critic Leonard Maltin. (The project was shot by Oscar-winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.) The show aired once and that was that, but, thankfully, made its way to YouTube, where the strangeness of it all has become something of a phenomenon to comedy podcasters.\n\nBut for this latest escapade in legal shenanigans, Turner Classics is leaning into it a bit more. While the show is not yet streaming on its TCM Watch app, three Dick Tracy movies from the 1940s (Dick Tracy, Dick Tracy vs. Cueball, and Dick Tracy's Dillema) were just added. And with capturing material to YouTube a little easier these days, a high resolution version is, at least for now, viewable. (And appears at the bottom of this page.)\n\nSo what happens in this television special, beyond outfoxing The Suits? Matt Singer of ScreenCrush summarizes it thusly:\n\nTCM host Ben Mankiewicz invites film critic Leonard Maltin over to his office as he prepares for a Zoom call with the famous comic strip and movie cop, Dick Tracy. Tracy (Beatty) calls Mankiewicz and Maltin on Zoom—Beatty is seated in a black void while wearing Tracy’s trademark yellow hat and overcoat — first to compliment Mankiewicz on an interview he did with Beatty for TCM some time earlier. Then “Dick Tracy” explains his issues with the movie Beatty made about him in 1990, while he watches clips from the film. A good five minutes of this 30 minute show were literally just Warren Beatty dressed as Dick Tracy watching the Dick Tracy movie while muttering things like “Yes! Yes, that’s good!” and “No! No! That’s terrible!”\n\nThen, making things stranger, “Warren Beatty” (played by Warren Beatty) appears, and Beatty and Tracy get into a “rambling debate about the Dick Tracy movie and moviemaking in general.” Singer adds that “It‘s worth noting that through all of this, Mankiewicz and Maltin barely say a word. After facilitating this call, they are less participants in it than bewildered observers.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPolygon’s Matt Patches compared the special to something you’d more likely see on Adult Swim than TCM. “If you have ever wanted to watch an 85-year-old man bicker and make amends with himself, while one version of him wears a big yellow coat, the day has arrived,” he wrote.\n\nNow, considering Beatty’s age (and the fact that his last movie, Rules Don’t Apply, hardly lit up the box office) the chances of him actually doing something with the Dick Tracy IP are close to nil. But it’s possible the man just doesn’t want to see someone else making Apple Watch cracks on a Hulu show with a character he holds so dear. Fair enough.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that Beatty's true motivations are known to him alone. Maybe he just thought doing this li'l show would be fun project, and that's all there is to it. Or maybe he felt it would generate some kind thoughts about him, considering it was just a few months ago that he was accused of sexually assaulting a minor back in 1973. Beatty did not respond to requests for a comment at that time, and has not commented on the lawsuit, which was filed shortly before a “look-back window” closed on January 1, 2023.\n\nEither way it is amusing that film scholars Mankiewicz and Maltin are eager to aid a living legend in his curious quest, and that TCM is ready to devote a half hour of air time to a baffling little experiment. The public access quality of it all is extremely charming, as is “Dick Tracy” sighing that “fighting crime is serious!” during an Al Pacino musical number."
