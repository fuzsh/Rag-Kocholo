        "text": "The Dick Tracy is a small bakelite camera for 127 film, made c.1947 by Seymour Products Co, using a 1938 design by Jack Galter[1]. The camera was sold in a red cardboard box illustrated with the Dick Tracy character using the camera and the improbable claim, \"America's most popular-priced precision-made camera!\"[2]\n\nA printed ad from the 1950s lists the camera complete with a film developing kit for $4.98 USD[3]. According to Dick Tracy collector Larry Doucet, this camera in working condition may be worth anywhere from $20 to $45 USD alone and original packaging is worth another $20 USD.[4]\n\nThe same camera with an alternate faceplate was marketed as the Brenda Starr Cub Reporter camera.\n\nVariations\n\nBlack faceplate\n\nBlack/chrome faceplate\n\nRed/chrome faceplate\n\nThe graphics on the faceplate are based on the Dick Tracy comic strip.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBadging: Dick Tracy\n\nManufacturer: Seymour Products Co\n\nFilm: 127 roll film\n\nFormat: 3x4 cm\n\nLens: Fixed focus meniscus lens\n\nAperture: unknown\n\nShutter: mechanical leaf shutter\n\nShutter speed: unknown\n\nNotes"
