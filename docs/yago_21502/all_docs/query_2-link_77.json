        "text": "Last night the LA Times sponsored Hero Complex Film Festival kicked off with a screening of actor/director Warren Beatty’s adaption of Chester Gould’s classic comic strip Dick Tracy. Afterwards, Beatty fielded questions from the audience for nearly two hours about the film and in the process revealed that in addition to a blu-ray of the 1990 film being in the works, he is working on a sequel.\n\nBeatty was tight-lipped on both projects, offering no real concrete details on either. He did state that work on the sequel was ongoing and that he wants to “get it right.”\n\n”I think it’s dumb to talk about movies before you make them,” Beatty explained as to why he didn’t want to elaborate on his sequel plans. “I just don’t do it. It gives you a reason to avoid making them.”\n\nBeatty did elaborate on his love for the original comic strip, explaining why it inspired him to bring it to the big screen.\n\nIt was the first comic strip I got involved with as a kid. You know, Dick Tracy was the first non-funny comic strip… People got shot, times were tough in the Depression, things had to be done, and he went and did them.\n\nAlthough Beatty had been mentioning the possibility of a Dick Tracy sequel for several years, his hands had been tied by the ongoing legal dispute he had with the comic strip syndicators Kings Features over ownership of the film rights to the character. A judge recently resolved the conflict by ruling that Beatty still had control of the film rights, thus paving the way for him to actually invest the time and energy into getting the sequel made. I know that I for one would welcome a return to the stylized world that Beatty created for the first film."
