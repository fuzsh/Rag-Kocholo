The 1990 film Dick Tracy is a classic and one of my favorite many movies from when I was growing up. Well, over the weekend, Warren Beatty reprised his role as the old-school fictional pulp detective complete in his bright yellow coat and hat in a TCM special titled Tracy Zooms In.

He jumped in on a Zoom call with TCM personalities Ben Mankiewicz and Leonard Maltin. Back in 2010, Beatty did a similar special for TCM, which also included Maltin. Beatty does these little silly specials so that he can keep the rights to the character, which he personally owns.

Beatty has teased over the years that he would like to make a sequel to the 1990 movie one day, so I assume he’s holding out and hoping that one day Disney might come knocking to make that sequel happen. Or maybe he hopes that someone will want to drop some big money to buy the rights from him.

In the special, Maltin and Mankiewicz look back on the film with Beatty and discuss his process in making it. Then there’s a point where Beatty himself shows up as himself and they start to argue about whether or not the filmmaker will ever get to make his sequel, and what that might look like now.

The whole thing is a little strange, but charming. You can watch both Dick Tracy specials below!
