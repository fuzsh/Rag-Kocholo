The papers carry the names of the authors and should be cited accordingly. The findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed in this paper are entirely those of the authors. They do not necessarily represent the view of the World Bank, its Executive Directors, or the countries they represent.\n\nPurpose of the study: This paper examines the main factors and prerequisites for the intensive economic development of the Netherlands by taking into account the contribution of tourism, logistics, industry, and agriculture to the economic miracle. Methodology: In this work, the historical methods, as well as the theory of relative advantages and the general methods of scientific research, were used. Main findings: The preconditions for the rapid growth of the Dutch economy include successful domestic reforms carried out by the Government at the end of the 1990-is; a favorable trade regime focused on the freedom to exercise an economic or commercial activity; as well as deep integration of the country with the European Union that allows it to take full advantage of the European single market and remain one of the economic leaders within this Community. Research limitations/implications: In this study, authors propose a roadmap for those countries that are struggling because of the l...\n\n'The Netherlands Yearbook on International Cooperation 2008' is the second of the series yearbooks. The Yearbook has as objectives: to stimulate and feed the scientific and political debate on the Dutch international cooperation; to offer opportunities for publication for researchers in the field of international cooperation; to stimulate young researchers to undertake research on Dutch international cooperation and to publish on MA and PhD research. In the first part of the Yearbook, the Forum, articles are offered on the Dutch Africa policy, the Dutch debate on research and development, and on the conservative criticism of development assistance in the Netherlands. In the second part, called Articles, the first three articles are focusing on private aid organisations in the Netherlands.. Not only the geographical distribution of Dutch private aid is analysed, but also the relations between Dutch NGOs and their Southern partners and their policies regarding enterprise development are discussed. Two articles analyse the situation in Chad and Darfur and the complex relation between security, development and humanitarian assistance. The other two articles in this section discuss impact evaluation of development interventions and the support for citizensâ€™ initiatives in development cooperation. In the last section three overviews are presented of Dutch development cooperation, private aid organisations and business and development in 2007.\n\nIntroduction Suriname is a small country in the North of South America, rich in natural resources and biodiversity. It became a Dutch colony in 1667 and over three-hundred years later, having gone through the hardships of Dutch domination related to slavery and exploitation, the country became independent from the Netherlands in 1975. Since, the two countries have kept close ties, partly because a large number or Surinamese migrated to the Netherlands. In fact, 40% of all Surinamese lives in the Netherlands (CIA World Factbook, 2017; Leuwsha, 2015). However, the relationship has always been strained due to the old grudges borne by many of the Surinamese political elite against the Netherlands as the former colonist (Van Dijck, 2004). With regards to development cooperation, a colonial past can be regarded as one of the major determinants of foreign aid (Alesina & Dollar, 2000). Against this backdrop, the main objective of this paper is to find out what kind of relationship the Netherlands and Suriname have had in terms of development cooperation. Therefore, the following sections comprise a literature review to contextualise the research and leading to the research questions. Subsequently, the research methodology will be explained, followed by the presentation and discussion of the results, which will be summed up in the conclusion."
