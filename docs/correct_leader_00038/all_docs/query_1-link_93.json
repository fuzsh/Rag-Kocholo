Notes\n\n\"Sister\" article\n\n- Dutch Joris Demmink Affair Reveals Heroin, Cocaine and Pedophile Entrapment Affairs; Orange Royal Family Similarly Linked to Child Abuse and Mafia Networks\n\n\"Pim Fortuyn will become prime minister and his party, LPF, will be the largest. According to polling agency Intomart, we should be prepared for these outcomes on and after May the 15th. Director T. van Dijk: 'The polls underestimate the power of Fortuyn. A national revolution is on the way. Fortuyn will be prime minister.'\n\n\"Intomart is the bureau that before March 6th predicted that Fortuyn would end up with 10 seats in Rotterdam [the highest estimate]. ... [Van Dijk:] \"The result: it became 17. Fortuyn blasted straight through our polls.\" ... Van Dijk ascribes this to the enormous mobility of the floating voters. A large chunk in Rotterdam ended up with Fortuyn. ... Van Dijk hardly has any doubts because he noticed something else very noteworthy: the voters may be floating en masse, but once they've picked Fortuyn [after overcoming massive mainstream propaganda of him being a racist], it is almost impossible to make them change their minds.'\n\n\"Thus the weekly polls of NIPO and Interview are systematically too low, Intomart thinks. '[In our polls] the responders aren't asked to name a favorite party, but to provide for each party the chance of them voting for that party ... from one to ten.' According to Intomart this polling method is the one that most takes into account the large group of floating voters.\"\n\nMay 6, 2002, Volkskrant, 'Opiniepeiler: LPF grootste, Pim premier', hours before Fortuyn was shot (today's online edition misses the \"revolution\" sentence of Van Dijk). Update: The Los Angeles Times used the same method of polling with Donald Trump and turned out to be much more accurate than any of usual polls that the super-biased Liberal Establishment was pushing. Of course, Fortuyn's rise and situation was much the same as Trump's, except that Trump lived.\n\n\"The List Pim Fortuyn has overtaken the VVD with one seat... In percentages the LPF only scored 0.3 percent more than the VVD on Sunday evening. ... The lead on the CDA is only one more seat, or 0.7 percent of the voting percentage.\"\n\nMay 6, 2002, Volkskrant, 'Lijst Fortuyn passeert VVD', hours before Fortuyn was shot. Apparently also one of numerous reports biased against Fortuyn, as the newspaper is making it sound as if the CDA was gaining on Fortuyn while the reverse was going on.\n\nBack in 2012 I was looking into the 2002 Pim Fortuyn assassination, basically to assess widely-reported claims that there was a second shooter involved. As it turns out, this is one of the more blatant pieces of disinformation ever spread, on par with theories that a missile or small plane hit the Pentagon on 9/11. An article was published at the time, which has now been enormously expanded. The purpose of this article is roughly three-fold:\n\nExplore the connections and activities of Republican Society / Republikeins Genootschap members, especially those involved in anti-establishment activism and linked to the Pim Fortuyn assassination.\n\nCounter disinformation surrounding a second shooter in the Fortuyn case.\n\nExplain how the environmental movement from which Fortuyn killer Volkert van der Graaf sprang is dominated by a tight network of billion dollar \"liberal CIA\" superclass NGOs belonging to the supranational establishment which most wanted to see Fortuyn gone - and that this NGO network directly put a little over €150,000 in Van der Graaf's pocket.\n\nPart 1\n\nRepublican Society history: Bilderberg and 1001 Club ties\n\nThe Republican Society was founded on September 11, 1996, 1 [1] with the purpose of starting a public discussion on the pros and cons of the present parliamentary monarchy versus switching to a republican political model. It seems like an obvious question to ponder, but in the innocent 90s this was still an enormous taboo to break, at least in establishment circles. Top politicians and leading newspapers in the country all harshly, and above all, irrationally attacked the Republican Society founders of being a group of drunkards and subversives. 2 After a few weeks of reporting, the society basically dropped from sight and has hardly been discussed anymore.\n\nGoing through the biographies of the 14 co-founders 3, a pattern emerges. The Society is basically a collaboration between, on the one hand, top-level managers at the RABO, ABN-AMRO and Mees Pierson banks, as well as Royal Dutch Shell, and, on the other hand, chief editors of NRC Handelsblad newspaper and the magazines De Groene Amsterdammer (The Green Amsterdammer), Vrij Nederland (Free Netherlands) and Elsevier. The first three of these media outlets are considered relatively liberal and left wing; Elsevier is politically conservative. Keep in mind though, that the situation between liberals and conservatives isn't nearly as polarized as in the United States.\n\nThe collaboration between these two elements makes a lot of sense. The bankers and CEOs provide funding and have access to the highest levels of society, while the media outlets, in this case of moderate influence in the Netherlands, can deliver their opinions to the masses.\n\nSo, anno 2016, 20 years after the founding of the Society, did it succeed in its efforts? It appears not, because the royal house of Orange is still there and the majority of people have no clue that there even exists such a thing as the Republican Society. The new King Alexander and his wife Maxima are really well liked by the population and as long as that continues to be the case, it's unlikely that any kind of pressure from the public will emerge to abolish the monarchy. True, Alexander's grandfather, Prince Bernhard, was well-known for his wheeling and dealing, always suspected to be a bit of an opportunist, and carried the vast majority of the baggage attached to the royal house, mainly due to the Lockheed affair. However, at the same time it has been recognized that mainly the American connections he made during World War II and maintained since have really benefited the Netherlands economically. Bernhard's relatively liberal views, his sense of social justice, and his deep involvement in the environmental movement are also highly appreciated by the masses. On top of that, King's Day or Queen's Day is a guaranteed day off for the entire country. In other words, members of the Republican Society can talk until they way an ounce, but until one or more major scandals surrounding the royal family hits the front pages, nothing is going to change.\n\nAll this does not mean that we should forget about the Republican Society. Looking at the historical membership of the Society, there are a few questions to ask. And that's exactly what we're going to do in this article.\n\nISGP surrounded by Republican Society members, but never realizing it\n\nLuckily, figuring out who the members of the Republican Society are is easy enough. They have been listed on their website, www.republikeinsgenootschap.nl since the early 2000s. A few names immediately stand out, as they are just about the only widely-published authors and activists to have written articles and supported works critical of Bilderberg and Prince Bernhard. These include Gerard Aalders (member), Rene Zwaap of the Groene Amsterdammer (member) - strangely, De Groene Amsterdammer's 1984-1997 editor-in-chief Martin van Amerongen, a Republican Society co-founder, had become close friends with Prince Bernhard in 1996 - and Philip Droge (his work has been promoted, but he's not listed as a member). Aalders is a researcher at the Netherlands Institute of War Documentation (Instituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie). Despite sounding more academic than political, the head of this institute, Hans Blom, is a member of the Republican Society. Zwaap is a journalist of the Groene Amsterdammer, whose leadership is strongly represented in the Republican Society. Droge has written various hard-hitting books about the life of Prince Bernhard and related members of the royal family, to the point that he can be considered a leading conspiracy author.\n\nRepublican Society members Harry van Bommel (picture 2), Rene Zwaap, Gerard Aalders and the society-backed Philip Droge - organized opposition to Bilderberg and the liberal establishment? Why don't they dig deeper?.\n\nInterestingly, these three men - Aalders, Zwaap and Droge - are just about the only available sources on the 1001 Club, whose membership lists happen to be first published by ISGP. However, in contrast to ISGP, these authors never went all the way, only putting out a couple of teasers here and there. As for my \"relationship\" to these men: I once asked Zwaap for the 1001 Club lists, but didn't get them. This story is actually quite hilarious. I had literally just started out with conspiracy research and was a total and complete newcomer to any kind of research. I told Zwaap I had a membership list of the Pilgrims and asked if he wanted to trade for a 1001 Club list. He agreed and I sent him my Pilgrims Society list. Only problem: I didn't have any photocopies at the time. I only had a compilation of names with individual sources that included such \"reliable\" sources as Fritz Springmeier (looking back, the majority, if not all of Springmeier's names are true). Needless to say, that was the last I heard of Zwaap. Later on, of course, I did acquire photocopies of the 1001 Club and Pilgrims Society. Six months after publishing the 1001 Club photocopies, Gerard Aalders picked up on that and the group made the evening news for the first time ever. Needless to say, I was later quite surprised to see that Zwaap and Aalders were members of the rather elitist Republican Society.\n\nAnother surprise was to see Harry van Bommel of the Socialist Party. In late 2010 I was told by a foreign policy expert of a Socialist Party senator that Van Bommel was the ONLY member of Dutch parliament who dared to ask questions about Bilderberg 4 - and he just also happens to be a member of the Republican Society, as well as a pro-Palestinian agitator, a first-rate \"liberal CIA\" job. Based on that last fact, it is only to be expected that Van Bommel has worked with Gretta Duisenberg, Holland's most famous pro-Palestine and anti-Israel lobby activist. He's been involved with her as leaders of at least one major pro-Palestine demonstration against Israel. In the aftermath both were unsuccessfully sued by Holland's most famous lawyer, Bram Moszkowicz 5, a Jew whose family has been defending Holland's top criminals for decades, some with links to the Dutch royal family. In its 2014 Demmink affair article, ISGP wrote about Moszkowicz and related Dutch conspiracy affairs - all of which seem to transpire as some kind of screen play in a tiny superclass bubble. Moszkowicz suing Van Bommel and Duisenberg is just one more example.\n\nAs expected, Duisenberg herself has a curious past. In the late 1970s she became involved in the Netherlands-based Transnational Institute (TNI) where she worked closely with notorious CIA whistleblower and CounterSpy magazine founder Philip Agee. 6 Interestingly, and as discussed in ISGP's \"liberal CIA\" article, TNI (as well as CounterSpy) was a branch of the U.S.-based Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), a socialist-activist group founded by dissenting government employees of John McCloy and McGeorge Bundy, both well-known Ford Foundation chiefs and Rockefeller men. McCloy also was a member of the elite Pilgrims Society. To this day IPS receives millions of dollars from \"liberal CIA\" Eastern Establishment foundations as Rockefeller, Ford, MacArthur and Soros. The group also maintains the anti-conservative online encyclopedia Rightweb-irc-online.org, where people can find information on leading neocons and their favorite think tanks. After Duisenberg's flirt with TNI and Agee, who eventually was evicted from the Netherlands, she had a brief relationship with minister of defense and 1982 Bilderberg visitor Hans van Mierlo 7, before moving on to Wim Duisenberg:\n\nan IMF staffer in Washington, D.C. 1966-1969;\n\na supervisory board member of Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) since 1979, shortly after Prince Bernhard was forced to leave here over the Lockheed affair;\n\na vice president of the RABO Bank (1979-1981);\n\na director of the internationalist and Basel-based Bank for International Settlements (1982-1997, president 1988-1990);\n\na president of the Dutch Central Bank (1982-1997);\n\na first president of the European Central Bank (1998-2003)\n\na supervisory board member of the RABO Bank (2003-2005). 8\n\nWhile Wim Duisenberg was not known as a Palestinian activist, the Dutch monarchy and the establishment surrounding it has always had a bias towards the Palestinians over the Israelis, much in line with the traditional Eastern Establishment. Almost certainly this has a lot to do with oil interests, in case of the Dutch establishment through Shell and various oil corporations operating in the huge Rotterdam harbor. One of the clearest examples of superclass support for the Palestinian cause is the pro-Palestinian The Rights Forum, a Dutch NGO we'll come across again later on in this article. It has a large group of retired Dutch politicians on its board. 9\n\nSo, what other Republican Society members was I already familiar with in a conspiracy context? How about Willem Oltmans? In the 1970s this person took an interest in the Kennedy assassination and even brought to the Netherlands George de Mohrenschildt, a CIA handler of Lee Harvey Oswald who maintained top-level Texas oil connections. He's also the one who put the Oswalds in touch with Michael Paine and his wife Ruth Paine, the latter equally serving as a handler of the Oswalds. Michael Paine's parents were part of an extensive CIA-ran new age disinformation network and also connected closely to CIA director Allen Dulles, as did De Mohrenschildt and some of his oil industry buddies. Not particularly surprising, De Mohrenschildt committed suicide hours before HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi would have interviewed him, making him one of many Kennedy assassination suspects who suddenly died in this period.\n\nThen there's Republican Society member Pamela Hemelrijk, another name that sounds familiar. A columnist and journalist for the Algemeen Dagblad, a leading Dutch newspaper, she was fired in the wake of the Pim Fortuyn assassination for her irrational behavior and aggressive columns in which she attacked the political and media establishment that had demonized Fortuyn. Pim Fortuyn was a somewhat neoconservative political candidate who also happened to be a member of the Republican Society. Theo van Gogh, another member of the Republican Society and political ally of Fortuyn, was among Hemelrijk's supporters. 10 Towards the end of her life in 2009, Hemelrijk was secretary and treasurer of the Whistleblowers Online Foundation (Klokkenluiders Online Stichting), chaired and maintained by Micha Kat. 11\n\nISGP is very familiar with Kat, because he greatly supported the 2007 Beyond the Dutroux Affair article, as well as an early version of ISGP's Demmink affair article. I appreciate the support, but personally always felt that his website was a turn off to most people for the radical, accusatory tone. Only years later did I (fully) realize that Kat was part of a disinformation network financed by elite Dutch-American interests, among them Robert Rubinstein. A bit more on this connection later in this article. Not particularly surprising, Kat was also supported by Theo van Gogh, on whose website The Healthy Smoker (De Gezonde Roker) Kat was allowed to campaign against \"the establishment\" in the 2001-2004 period. 12\n\nA name in the Republican Society list that I only noticed right before finishing up this article is Britta Bohler, who two years after joining the Society 13 became the lawyer for Pim Fortuyn's assassin, a radical environmentalist named Volkert van der Graaf. Because of this new function of her, she was actually forced to step down as chair of the \"liberal CIA\"-financed Greenpeace Netherlands. And only 7 years after writing this original article, did I found out that in 2010 Bohler was invited to the advisory board of the (Dutch) Nexus Institute, where she was flanked by former Bilderberg secretary-general and future Bilderberg co-chair Victor Halberstadt, and other Bilderberger veterans as former Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers, Herman Wijffels (a top banker who became a UFO cultist), Frits Bolkestein (the old neocon mentor to \"alt right\" Fortuyn-successor Geert Wilders); and, over at the supervisory board, Alexander Rinnooy Kan. 14 We will discuss Bohler in more details later on.\n\nOh, and then there is Tomas Ross, Holland's most famous conspiracy theory author who spread disinformation on the Pim Fortuyn case with fellow-Republican Society member Theo van Gogh. 15\n\nA John Birch Society for the Netherlands?\n\nConsidering the Republican Society only consists of about 200 members or so, aren't the names mentioned until now not just incredible? Here we have a network of conspiracy authors, activists and even a prime ministerial candidate allied against the influence of the royal family, influence which mainly runs through the family's deep involvement in Bilderberg. It appears that outside of this little network, no one is allowed to have his or her books published and certainly isn't allowed space in any major Dutch newspaper or magazine. On top of that, these authors and activists only go so far with the facts they mention and sometimes even spread blatant disinformation.\n\nIt's here where the Republican Society starts to become really interesting: it does a terrible job of enforcing such scandals. Looking at the Republican Society's resources and the number of partially-exposed scandals attached to the royal family, or at least their elite and seemingly underground connections, and it appears that catastrophic damage can be done with a little hard-hitting investigative journalism and historical research. But the society has always held back.\n\nLooking at overall membership of the Republican Society, it has gathered a bunch of anarchist- and activist-minded individuals. On the left we have communists, \"pacifist socialists\", \"provos\", \"radicals\", Vietnam War protesters, Green Party founders, anti-apartheid activists, conspiracy theorists, feminists, and - in professor Erik van Ree - even a former Maoist who became a virulent defender of the rights of pedophiles. That's some alliance to have against the royal house of Orange and Bilderberg establishment. The biographies of these persons can be read in Appendix B of this article.\n\nI'm not sure how much we have on the right-wing of the political spectrum in the Republican Society. Or had, considering two of three main right-wingers/neocons - Pim Fortuyn, Theo van Gogh and Tomas Ross - were killed off in the 2002-2004 period. Then there are the editors of Elsevier, probably the most right-wing mainstream political magazine the Netherlands has to offer. To illustrate, co-founder and editor of Elsevier from the 1950s to the 1970s, Henk Lunshof, was a notorious red baiter. And this stance hardly seems to have softened. In the run up to the 2012 Dutch elections, for example, Elsevier was publishing ridiculous articles with headlines as Netherlands much too sober for SP-dictatorship (Nederland is veel te nuchter voor SP-dictatuur), in which it was explaining in almost John Birch Society terms that \"the media are still representing the church of the left.\" 16 Silly ultraright stuff, but the magazine has been represented in the Republican Society by a number of founders and members.\n\nIt's quite incredible to see the far-left cooperating with the far-right within the Republican Society. Things become even more intriguing when we observe that the glue holding these polarizing elements together is a group of top bankers and oil managers, some of them with ties to Prince Bernhard's Bilderberg group and 1001 Club, NGOs the husband of Queen Juliana was overseeing with the Rockefellers.\n\nAs for Bilderberg, three Republican Society founders have been visitors. Roelof Nelissen, of ABN-AMRO bank and what soon became the Mees Pierson bank, visited in 1979. Ben Knapen was invited in 1991, when he had just become editor-in-chief of NRC Handelsblad, one of the largest Dutch newspapers.\n\nPieter Korteweg, chairman of Robeco until 1996, when it was taken over by the RABO Bank, is the most interesting of all. Like Knapen, he first visited Bilderberg in 1991, but then, from 1992 to 1995, he served as Bilderberg's honorary treasurer and also could be found on the group's steering committee, along with names as Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller. Despite Korteweg's involvement in setting up the Republican Society in 1996, he still visited Bilderberg in 1997 and 1998, along with the royal family. 19\n\nOf course, just because a person is of the opinion that it might be better to remove the Orange royal family as the symbolic head of the Dutch state, does not mean that this person has to be bitter enemies with the royal house. In fact, a good portion of the \"internationalist\" clique at Bilderberg probably is of the opinion that it is a legitimate discussion to have. However, one shouldn't forget that domestically the Republican Society was harshly and bitterly attacked by much of the Dutch establishment after its founding. The Philips concern actually forced Ben Knapen to distance himself from the Society over fears of losing its good relationship with the royal family. 20 Also, Republican Society members have been responsible for publishing a large portion of the serious criticism leveled against members of the royal family. The two definitely seem to have opposing interests.\n\nThen there are the Republican Society links to Prince Bernhard's 1001 Club. These ties mainly go through Society chairman Hans van den Bergh, a nephew of former minister of defense, NRC Handelsblad advisory board member and 1001 Club member Sidney van den Bergh. A cousin of Hans and Sidney, Lily van den Bergh, is a regular member of the Republican Society. Hans and Lily have written for typical Republican Society media outlets as NRC Handelsblad, Vrij Nederland and De Groene Amsterdammer.\n\nIn addition, particularly the politically conservative and Republican Society-dominated Elsevier magazine has strong ties to the 1001 Club. From 1954 to 1987 Elsevier was headed by 1001 Club member Rudolf van den Brink, whose brother, the influential banker and business magnate (AMRO Bank, Ford Netherlands, etc.) Jan van den Brink, was another 1001 Club member. To this day Rudolf's son plays a key role in the Elsevier network. Various other Dutch 1001 Club members could be found on the board of Elsevier over the decades:\n\nDr. Pieter A. Blaisse of Philips, AMRO Bank, Thyssen-Bornemisza and Bilderberg;\n\nAllard Jiskoot, an AMRO Bank director and heir of the Pierson banking fortune (also of Elsevier), and;\n\nCees van Lede of Bilderberg 1989, Philips, the Rockefeller's JPMorgan Chase and the Carlyle Group.\n\nLooking at this information, it's definitely interesting to see Elsevier magazine showing up prominently among founders and and non-founding members of the Republican Society. It certainly is a curious opposition movement. There appear to be similarities here to the fringe ultraright in the United States (John Birch Society, Liberty Lobby, Alex Jones, etc.) that has been attacking the liberal establishment. This fringe group never crosses certain lines and to a very large extent is focused on spreading disinformation. Occasionally it can be demonstrated that this has been happening under the guidance of CIA, Pentagon and superclass elements.\n\nWithout even looking at America's ultraright I personally would not be surprised if the CIA and Dutch intelligence have been working through the Republican Society to help organize and manage Dutch opposition to the dominant liberal establishment. In a democratic society the public can become restless when no dissident voices are heard, so what better way is there than to set up a small clique of rebels?\n\nI actually do not claim to know for certain what the Republican Society is about, except to say that it has gathered many leftist elements that without a doubt would have been put on the watch list of Dutch intelligence if the Cold War was still going strong. The other claim that can be made with relative safety is that there's an incredible discrepancy between the leadership of the Republican Society and the many left-leaning, green and anarchist types having joined the society over the years. This low level membership may be honest and sincere in their beliefs that the Netherlands should be transformed into a Republic, but at the same time PCM publishers and the political magazine Elsevier, which have played an important role in the founding of the Republican Society, certainly are part of the establishment and are not particularly socialist-oriented.\n\nThe New Republican Society: similar liberal establishment ties?\n\nLooking at these ideas and ties of the Republican Society, I began to wonder about a sister group that has been active in the Netherlands: the Nieuw Republikeins Genootschap, translating in English to \"New Republican Society\". The group was founded on January 20, 1998, one and a half years after the Republican Society was set up. The New Republican Society was disappointed with the relative inaction of the Republican Society and also opposed its elite character. The New Republican Society allowed anyone to join their group. 21\n\nSo, who founded the group? That would be Ewout Irrgang 22 and Elisabeth van der Steenhoven. Not much is known about this last person, but Irrgang is quite well-known and he has an interesting background to say the least. He's one of these university boys who does everything perfect and shoots straight to the top. He actually founded the Republican Society while still a student. A biography:\n\nBorn in 1976.\n\nSecretary student union SRVU (Free University) 1996-1997;\n\nJoined the Socialist Party in 1997;\n\nBA in political science 1999 and a BA or MA in economics in 2000;\n\nCo-organizer of the Socialist Party delegation to the IMF and World Bank top in Prague in 2000;\n\nFounder and chair New Republican Society 1998-2001;\n\nCo-organizer of the Klote Koninklijke Kermis (KKK) [F*cked up/hoi polloi Royal Circus] on Queen Beatrix's birthday at The Dam in Amsterdam in 1999 23;\n\nAt least a spiritual supporter of the Het Witte Plein Comite, a protest group campaigning against the royal marriage in February 2002 that also included Irrgang's successor on the committee board 24 ;\n\nDirector Socialist Party 1999-2005;\n\nStaff member in the monetary and economic department of De Nederlandsche Bank (Dutch Federal Reserve) May-October 2005;\n\nSocialist Party congressman 2005-2012;\n\nTechnical director of the PharmAccess Foundation in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, since 2013. 25\n\nI was already scratching my head about Irrgang's biography before learning he went to work for the PharmAccess Foundation, as he could well have been recruited as an intelligence asset at the Free University. And then the last entry of his biography reads PharmAccess, an NGO whose project overlap with the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation 26, two elite foundations that have deep and long-standing ties to the liberal wing of the CIA. The CIA ties have been discussed in-depth in ISGP's Pilgrims Society and \"Liberal CIA\" articles.\n\nTo finish up this little unplanned D-tour, Anjo Clement has been a board member of the New Republican Society since 2002 and chairman since 2011. University of Tilburg educated, he has been involved in national protests since the 1960s. In more modern times he has been a staffer in the The Hague civil administration, where he served as a liaison with the European Union. Among the projects he worked on is one that allowed five Israeli and Palestinian communities to work together in peace, a first-rate liberal establishment or \"liberal CIA\" project. 27\n\nIt remains remarkable: like Irrgang, Clement would make an ideal asset of the Atlantic liberal elite, which even today actually is more pro-Arab than it is pro-Israel. The only observable difference of opinion with this elite is that he would like to turn the Netherlands into a republic like France or the United States. That's it. The New Republican Society might not be as elite as the Republican Society, but one hardly gets the impression of a genuine \"grassroots\" effort here either.\n\nPart 2\n\nThe deaths of Republican Society members Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh\n\nThere's certainly more intriguing information than what has been discussed until this point. Two important members of the Republican Society that have already been mentioned were professor Pim Fortuyn, a former Elsevier columnist (which explains his membership) who became a leading candidate for the prime ministership in the 2002 elections; and his media friend Theo van Gogh. Fortuyn was a long-time campaigner against the Islam. In 1997, for example, he wrote the book Tegen de islamitisering van onze cultuur (Against the Islamization of our culture), today more relevant than ever before. At the same time he was very pro-Israel and thus could be labeled a neocon, albeit a rational and practical one. 28 Paradoxically, he was shot to death in 2002 by an environmental activist, one week before the elections. Two years later, in 2004, Van Gogh was publicly executed by a radical Muslim.\n\nVan Gogh had been one of the most vocal supporters of Ayaan Hirsi Ali 29, a women whose parliamentary campaign revolved around the fact that as a young Muslim girl her genitals had been cut. When Van Gogh was murdered, the Jihadist perpetrator used his knife to stick a note on Van Gogh's chest, which read that Ali would be next. 30 Intimidated, Ali fled to the United States and just happens to land a job as visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute 31, home to neocon extremists as Richard Perle, Michael Ledeen and the like. Eventually she married key superclass member Niall Ferguson with whom she attended Nat Rothschild's 40th birthday party in 2011. 32 Over the years, while filling in ISGP's NGO list, I've spotted Hirsi Ali in other NGOs. She's listed as a researcher at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, a very elite group with board members and advisors as Nat Rothschild, Russian oligarch and prime Rothschild business partner Oleg Deripaska, former CIA directors James Schlesinger and John Deutch, and some of David Rockefeller's closest economic advisors and friends. 33 Hirsi Ali is also a minor contributor to the OpenDemocracy Foundation, along with George Soros, who also helps finance the project along with the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers Fund. 34 Finally, Hirsi Ali has been involved with the Mont Pelerin Society 35, along with her husband, Niall Ferguson, whom we can also spot in NGOs as the Munich Security Conference, Institute for Strategic Dialogue, Hudson Institute, Herzliya Conference (Israel) and Tomorrow: The Israel Presidential Conferences.\n\nMany Dutch people were already worried at the time that Fortuyn was going to be killed before election day. He had been threatened and attacked on several occasions and became increasingly afraid to walk the streets - at least in some of the big cities. During several television interviews Fortuyn stated that he needed protection. But he wasn't offered any by the government (headed by Wim Kok, a later advisory board member of Royal Dutch Shell (2003-2005), president of the Club of Madrid (2010-2014) and a trustee of George Soros' International Crisis Group 36). This would cause a lot of heat after his death. 37\n\nFortuyn never deserved the vocal and physical abuse he was subjected to. He was just being realistic on the immigration problem, a huge issue for the native Dutch population, but made completely impossible to discuss by the media and political establishment. To illustrate, here are Fortuyn's words during a March 21, 2002 debate at Rotterdam's Erasmus University with other leading political candidates:\n\n\"Of course you have to praise what is going well, but you do have to see this in the context of 20 years of failure. And I come from a city, Rotterdam, were things have gone terribly wrong and where we have developed a severely unbalanced population growth. In which the PvdA, the [Labour] party which turned its back on its own following, has made sure that the multicultural problem couldn't be discussed at all. Every time we tried, even with [senior] widows of harbor workers, in which I was involved, [who] were stashed in communities in which 70 foreign [Third World, Arab and black] nationalities were living ... they were accused of being racists by your party members and by your city councilman, Mr. Rosenmoller [of the Green-Left Party]. And that is not what these women were.\n\n\"We couldn't discuss anything. We could measure anything. ... Everything was considered stigmatizing. We couldn't measure and we weren't allow to know [the facts]. All thanks to the Leftists Church. And you belong to that also [pointing to the Democrats 66 leader Thom de Graaf].\"\n\nCandidates of the traditional parties had little to counter this with apart from the usual politically-correct empty rhetoric. PvdA leader Ad Melkert rebutted with: \"You can learn a whole lot from other cultures.\" Paul Rosenmoller of the Green Party added with great fake emotion: \"But be careful that you don't create any problems where there aren't any! ... Don't just stare yourself blind on numbers. To you and me and others it is about the people.\" 38 In other words, these traditional politicians wouldn't have changed a thing. But change is exactly what people demanded.\n\nTwo years earlier, in 2000, it had already been admitted in the press that statistics revealed the obvious: \"Unemployment, poverty, dropping out and crime were heaping themselves up with ethnic minorities.\" 39 In the years after Fortuyn's death other studies completely confirmed and even expanded on this. ISGP has discussed these studies in detail in a number of articles, including one on black crime levels - which also gives information on Arab crime numbers in the Netherlands - and and another on the Arab sexual assault crisis in Dutch and international swimming pools. The fact is, the numbers are nothing short of apocalyptic when it comes to crime levels and Jihadism support. Western Europe's loading capacity for the culturally unsophisticated Third World masses, most of whom refuse to integrate, has been far exceeded. Then again, It appears this is the only solution elites see to the graying of the population, which most certainly is a daunting problem.\n\nFortuyn was demonized, spied upon and apparently intimidated by Dutch intelligence for the political stances he took, only to be snuffed by an environmental activist days before a prime ministerial elections that he had a very good chance of winning. More about these aspects of the story later.\n\nTheo van Gogh's death was almost as peculiar as Fortuyn's. He was killed by Mohammed Bouyeri, a member of the Hofstad group that was completely penetrated by Dutch intelligence. Dutch intelligence had managed to house the group in a specialized home that was bugged from top to bottom. A portion of the men also worked as informers for Dutch intelligence. Needless to say, questions were raised how this group managed to publicly execute Theo van Gogh without being stopped beforehand.\n\nTomas Ross, Republican Society, spreads disinformation on Fortuyn shooting\n\nThings get weirder. Before his death, van Gogh and \"faction\" (read: fact + fiction) author Tomas Ross, Holland's media guru on conspiracies and intelligence, had been working on a movie that implied Fortuyn was killed in a high-level conspiracy similar to John F. Kennedy. Ross was yet another member of the Republican Society. In May 2012 he again made the newspapers, still claiming that Fortuyn had been killed in similar fashion as Kennedy. However, a simple analysis of his arguments reveals that these are deeply flawed. Let's lift out two aspects: his claim that it would have been technically impossibly for a shell casing to have been found at \"more than 10 meters\" distance from Fortuyn, and also that there is evidence that shots were coming from two different directions. Here's an excerpt of one of the articles that deals with the claims of Tomas Ross:\n\n\"A bullet casing has been found at more than 10 meters distance from Fortuyn, which technically should not be possible with the gun Volkert van der G. used during the murder. Also a sentence would have been removed from the autopsy report. In there the pathologist describes that one of the bullets in the head of Fortuyn would not have entered the head from behind, but from the front. ...\n\nBesides that, there are witnesses as radio presenter Ruud de Wild and LPF-er Albert de Booy that Fortuyn would have already slumped to his knees before Van der G. fired his first shot, so Van der G. was basically firing at the corpse of Fortuyn.\" 40\n\nThe fact is that these statements could not be further from the truth. Let's take a look at what the witnesses exactly said about this event. Here's the official testimony of Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's driver and good friend, who was sitting in the car when the shots were fired:\n\n\"On May 6, 2002, from 4:00 to 6:00 pm Fortuyn would give an interview at Studio 3 FM (the court understands: in Hilversum). The program lasted until a few minutes before 6 pm. Subsequently Fortuyn and I walked outside. Then I heard shots [when I was in the car and Fortuyn outside], I believe two. I saw Fortuyn fall to the ground. At about 1.5 meters from Fortuyn I saw a man standing with a gun in his hand. I heard that man fire several additional shots, this time three or four times. The shooter ran away quickly and I chased him.\"\n\nWitnesses Ruud de Wild, Sander de Heer and Jeroen Kijk were on the Barend and van Dorp (Villa BvD) television program one day after the shooting. It might be a coincidence, but co-host Fritz Barend is a member of the Republican Society. Jan Mulder is sitting at the table as a regular guest - he is another Republican Society member. You almost begin to think that this society has massive membership among the Dutch people, but there have only been about 200.\n\n1) Volkert van der Graaf, environmental activist and killer of Fortuyn; 2) Pim Fortuyn, shot; 3) Hans Smolders with Fortuyn; 4) Sander de Heer (red sweater), Ruud de Wild (cigarette) and Jeroen Kijk on Villa BvD, May 7, 2002.\n\nFortuyn was actually holding the arm of Ruud de Wild when the shooting began. Remember, according to Ross, Ruud de Wild has claimed that Fortuyn slumped to the ground before Volkert van der Graaf began firing on him. Here's the account of de Wild, who, by the way, went through a very rough time in the months ahead for having witnessed the shooting:\n\n\"I turn back and a guy comes walking [onto the car park]. ... The only thing that I see is a ... gray baseball cap. I haven't seen anything else about this man. With a plastic bag up in the air. And he starts shooting from above, to the side of the plastic bag. After the second bang I got such a headache, because my left ear slammed shut. ... It began to hurt my ears so bad that I had to duck away. … He had fired his fourth shot, and after that the fifth and sixth came – and he took those from a distance, as he had already begun to ran. He kept shooting. That's when I ducked behind [Pim's] car. And that was shot number 6, which landed in the car. … That's what I keep feeling, the hand of Pim - and then I lose it.\"\n\nInteresting. It's more than clear that the first two shots were fired by Van der Graaf, because De Wild's ears began to hurt and slammed shut because of the noise. If Fortuyn would have been shot first from a different angle, wouldn't De Wild, whose arm Fortuyn held, or anyone else present not have noticed and described it during the television interview? They probably would have. Reading how Van der Graaf is firing his final shots while running away also easily explains why one of the shell casings was found over 10 meters away. The other two witnesses on Barend and Van Dorp, Sander de Heer and Jeroen Kijk, gave similar descriptions of the event.\n\nAnd here is how Van der Graaf himself remembered the event while he was on trial:\n\n\"I walked into the direction [of the victim] with cap and sunglasses on. ... I raised both arms [while] the gun was still in the plastic bag ... When I had approached him at a distance of 1.5 meters [I began to shoot] ... I still remember that I fired the first two shots at the upper portion of the [victim's] back. I fired a total of five times. ... The sixth shot went off by accident and I believe to have hit the ground with it. I saw the victim go down and then fired more shots. I purposely aimed and fired at his head.\"\n\nThat's all the testimony I can find at the moment and comes from court documents. For some reason these little details have hardly been reported in the Dutch media. But what precisely happened seems quite clear: Van der Graaf approached Pim Fortuyn from behind, fired two shots, walked past him, saw Fortuyn slump to his knees (and eventually onto his back), and fired three more shots at his head (Ruud de Wild had seen the holes in his head). By the time he fired his final shots, Van der Graaf was running away and would be chased by Fortuyn's driver, Hans Smolders. No mystery here at this point.\n\nRoss the neocon\n\nIt is somewhat known that Ross' father was a resistance fighter and \"pioneer\" of Dutch intelligence in the years after World War II 41 ; and also that Theo van Gogh, the person Ross was working with in an effort to raise questions about the Pim Fortuyn murder, had a father who was a Soviet expert within Dutch intelligence. 42 An uncle and namesake of Theo van Gogh was executed by the Nazis for being in the resistance, but little detail is known about all these \"forefathers\" - which is unfortunate considering Prince Bernhard had deep involvement with former resistance fighters and the top of post-World War II Dutch intelligence. While Van Gogh is relatively moderate, Ross is a real neoconservative right-winger, as evidenced by his completely discredited and rather insane claim that Iraq was the mastermind behind 9/11. That's right out of former CIA director James Woolsey's playbook. Ross is also of the opinion that the state has every right to limit personal freedom in name of national security. Doesn't this sound like a really independent, objective investigator of the Fortuyn case?\n\nHere we have Ross theorizing about Iraq and 9/11, two months after the attack:\n\n\"With the attack on the WTC the first step has been made. They want to give power to the masses in the Middle East. A feeling of self-worth. We can beat the Americans! ... They knew a counter-attack would come. Now they want to come up with something that will turn everything around again. No more grand terrorist attacks, but creating streams of refugees, of which the images will go around the world. Slowly part of the western civilization won't see America anymore as a victim, but as aggressor. ... All of a sudden Saddam Hussein will present himself as a mediator. Bin Laden is the terrorist, America the aggressor and Hussein the savior. With his diplomacy he ensures support for his regime from moderate Muslim countries in the Middle East.\" 43\n\nYou've got to hand it to him, Ross has been spinning a really nice piece of fiction here. Then again, Ross can always hide behind his role as an author of \"faction\", a combination of fact and fiction. Doesn't he sound like the ultimate tool to discredit \"conspiracy theories\" in general by typecasting the entire subject each time he goes on national television? Here are some more words of Ross, where he uses the exact same logic as the persons who brought us the U.S. Patriot Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 2003:\n\n\"[The Schengen Agreement, limiting border controls between various European countries] is no good whatsoever ... They should screen everybody. It's for out own security, right? I don't think that's a problem. ...\n\n\"The politicians who claim that privacy is more important than security themselves sit in a very privileged position [the best parts of the country]. ...\n\n\"It's too simplistic to say that someone is innocent because he didn't do it, even though he has concrete plans. That's how it is in criminal law. ... Criminal law is outdated, so that has to change. ... The boundaries are still moving towards the benefit of the suspect. The boundaries should shift towards the benefit of the potential victims.\" 44\n\nLet's just say I'm just waiting for links between Tomas Ross and the network of Le Cercle to surface. He probably never visited, but I'd be surprised if the associates of his father at Dutch intelligence didn't include Cercle associates as Louis Einthoven and Cees van den Heuvel (who set up the Dutch branch of the MK-ULTRA-linked Human Ecology Fund). More about that in ISGP's Demmink affair article.\n\nRoss lying about a second shooter? Then so is Ine Veen.\n\nIne Veen. Ideal setting and outfit for a political discussion, enough to make one immediately skeptical - and rightly so.\n\nRoss hasn't been the only person making the claim that two different types of bullets have been found in Fortuyn's body and that evidence of a second shooter can be found in the testimonies of the witnesses. The exact same things have been claimed by Ine Veen, author of the 2007 book Moord names de Kroon? (Murder ordered by the Throne?). Veen's uncle was Johan van Hulst, a leading Christian politician with positions in Dutch and European Parliament. As a model, singer and actress from the 1950s to the 1980s, Veen also used to know many people in the media.\n\nLike the work of Tomas Ross, Veen's book was given a degree of attention on Dutch evening news. At the time I thought it peculiar that she was interviewed in a badly-lit room, basically coming across as a UFO cultist. Later conferences where she gave speeches had a similar ambiance. It always made me wary of the validity of her claims. Having read good portions of her book recently, my skepticism only grew. One of the key things she does is rehash a theory of the \"Mishima Cyber Command\" (seemingly just one or two long-forgotten forum posters at a Pim Fortuyn site) that the Syrian arms dealer Monzer al-Kasser was used to recruit a Muslim fundamentalist with the name Abu Fatah, and that this Abu Fatah was the second gunman during the murder of Pim Fortuyn. Veen supposedly identifies the Dutch intelligence officer behind the \"Mishima Cyber Command\" and explains that he worked with the CIA. Well, considering the amount of knowledge of whoever wrote those MCC posts, that doesn't surprise me. But Veen, for some reason, then assumes that these MCC posts were, in fact, truthful. I read the pages in question repeatedly, trying to figure out how she made this leap of logic, but to no avail. The fact is, the claims of MCC were nonsense, because there's no evidence of a second gunman - at all. It's really nice that a police report was leaked to Ine Veen that is supposed to provide evidence of this second bullet, but the report must have been fake - because based on the witness testimonies, there's no evidence of second gunman (in complete contrast to the Kennedy case, by the way).\n\nBasic truths: late ambulance, malfunctioning gate and a quick arrest\n\nSeeing all the nonsense promoted by Tomas Ross and Ine Veen, you'd almost forget that there are legitimate questions surrounding the death of Fortuyn. It's true, for instance, that the ambulance arrived very late, in part because the gate to access the car park, where Fortuyn was laying, malfunctioned. To get an idea of what happened in the first half hour after the shooting, we again turn to witnesses Ruud de Wild, Sander de Heer and Jeroen Kijk, whose earlier descriptions of the event ruled out the possibility of a second shooter. These excerpts are from the same May 7, 2000 interview:\n\nRuud de Wild:\n\n\"The ambulance [arrived] in 9 minutes? That's bullshit. Pure hogwash. And everything in the newspapers, all hearsay.\"\n\nJeroen Kijk:\n\n\"The policewoman in Hilversum said that there were rumors that shots were still being fired in the area, but the truth was that the computer of the gate had crashed.\"\n\nSander de Heer:\n\n\"I just heard it again from the police spokesman: \"We don't know if he died immediately.\" I was standing above him. He was still breathing. … He was just breathing softly and relaxed. … What I just said, just this evening I heard the police say that, \"We didn't know if he died immediately.\" I was thinking: \"Yeah, you should have interviewed me then. What bullshit. I have seen him breathing for another 15 minutes. ...\n\n\"It took at least 20 minutes for police and ambulance to arrive. The gate at the entrance didn't even open . … I even walked off the terrain. I think, maybe … an ambulance will come this way; then, when I walk past the car barriers, I can at least point out to them: \"Here you need to be; here you need to go inside.\" Nothing. Just nothing. … The ambulance has stood five minutes in front of the gate. I stood in front of the ambulance, with the gate in between. The gate wasn't opening. ... [Ruud de Wild yells: \"A disgrace!\"]\n\n\"I stood next to the security booth of the gate and I asked \"Why doesn't the gate open? Somebody is dying in here!\" Answer: \"Oh, we just need to reboot the computer. Just a minute.\" He literally said that. And I've seen the computer system boot and boot until the gate opened again.\"\n\nSander de Heer also commented on the contrast between the capture of the shooter and the response of the ambulance:\n\n\"Yeah, I though that was such a strange story. We have been waiting forever for an ambulance and already at 12 past 6 he had been arrested by a police team.\"\n\nHans Smolders, Fortuyn's driver who had been running after the shooter, explained how Van der Graaf was captured this fast, but was still a little bit surprised at the amount of police present at Van der Graaf's arrest:\n\n\"I called 112 [911] and gave directions to the police where we were walking, what street, and that is how he walked into the trap of the police at the gas station. ... Yeah, there was a lot of police actually, which also surprised me. But at the moment I was really glad with that, of course - I was glad we had him.\" 45\n\nFortuyn's former driver suspects establishment conspiracy\n\nSmolders was invited to the show of Menno Buch on March 17, 2003. Instead of allowing himself to be praised as a hero by either the Dutch government or Buch, he actually criticized the political establishment:\n\n\"I really don't want to accept that award [from the queen]. It seems like many people have forgotten what was done to Pim. Look, we're talking about Volkert van der G., who pulled the trigger, and he has to take full 100 percent responsibility for that, and has to be punished severely. But those who claimed that Pim was a racist ... really created the [political] climate that pushed that Volkert to his actions. ...\n\n\"Well, yeah, but that establishment and political elite [of which the queen is part] are the ones who went ballistic when Pim came onto the scene. They were probably prepared to commit murder in order to get Pim to disappear from the political scene. And then he is actually murdered! If it hadn't been Volkert, it would have been someone else. Hadn't it been the 6th of May, then it would have been the 10th of May or the 2nd of June. The [political] climate that was created was very grave. And if you see this so up close, then you really don't know what is happening to you. You go: this is not possible in this country.\"\n\nSome favored institutes of former prime minister Wim Kok, his predecessor Ruud Lubbers, as well as Mabel Wisse Smit. George Soros money has been behind the ICG and ECFR. Bilderberg is more involved with active ministers.\n\nThis is by far the biggest point Smolders kept making. He seems to somewhat agree with Buch that Van der Graaf may have never been caught if he hadn't chased him. Smolders gave several additional interviews on Dutch television around the first anniversary of the murder of Pim Fortuyn. In each case he attacked the establishment and defended Fortuyn's legacy. Here's what Smolders said to Daphne Bunsboek on Good Morning Netherland, May 6, 2003:\n\n\"Yes, there has come a degree of anger in me. Before this I was really a very quiet guy. They were the people I used to look up to, a [prime minister Wim] Kok, etc. And then I became involved in this. And then you see that there is a layer in this country which sees nothing and really keeps this country in a stranglehold. A PvdA where an [Ad] Melkert and [Wim] Kok, who kept the whole PvdA in a stranglehold - if Mr. [Rob] van Gijzel hadn't had the courage to go against them we would still not know anything about the Construction Fraud [Bouwfraude]. And so there are stacks of dossiers about which we know nothing. The JSF affair, you name it. With the Construction Fraud they are just lying, those ministers, [and] talking about nothing important. And [Tineke] Netelenbos says: \"A shadow account? Has that to do with real money?\" That is what has to rule the country? What are we talking about here? ... [Jan Peter Balkenende] is not honest. Jan Peter has everything to be a good prime minister, but you see him squirming. Just speak the truth. Throw it on the table. ... Listen, the queen has abused her power and Wim Kok knew about it. Done. ...\n\n\"Look, it's only logical when a leader is taken out, there are people [in the party] who don't belong there. Who weren't able to act decently, because they were continually contacting the media. Well, those people were put in front of the camera. Because it is true that the media has destroyed the reputation of Pim Fortuyn. They blindly followed the elite. If Wim Kok says: \"He's going to divide the country and he is asocial and he is seeding hate.\" Well, he did that himself by throwing those poor immigrants in old districts without any prospects - and put them on welfare.\"\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010 Smolders served in congress for four years in a futile attempt to save Pim Fortuyn's legacy. In 2012 he gave another interview and clearly hadn't changed his opinions:\n\n\"I myself didn't want to go into politics, but I thought, let me then help someone [Pim] who takes on those establishment parties. I am not so naive to think that you can just change something in politics. That's a mafia-like structure. You don't just walk through that. They will do anything to destroy you.\" 46 [45]\n\nIn that same interview Smolders clearly stated he believes that there were people who manipulated or ordered Van der Graaf to commit the murder:\n\n\"I am happy that he has actually begun to talk, because I want the truth why he did what he did. With what purpose. ... To me it comes across as an incoherent story, as it has been told by him during the trial. So I think it would be really good if he is going to tell what the deeper background is and with whom - at the orders of whom - he committed that murder.\"\n\nFor some reason the person doing the interview didn't ask Smolders to explain this statement. Strange, because pimfortuyn.com is a (not too well-documented) conspiracy site. And, of course, an ISGP email to the site with questions went unanswered.\n\nFortuyn killer's telephone monitored\n\nRemember the earlier discussed neocon Republican Society member Tomas Ross who disinformed the Dutch public about Iraq's ties to 9/11 and a second shooter being involved in the Pim Fortuyn assassination? Ross actually did say a few things about the Fortuyn case that I can agree with, at least to some extent:\n\n\"The theory has always been, although I can't prove it, that they [Dutch intelligence] knew that Volkert van der G. would murder Fortuyn. The AIVD [Dutch intelligence] Volkert had been monitoring Volkert for a long time. He was suspected in the murder of an environmental civil servant [Chris van der Werken] in 1996, together with a friend of his. His environmental movement \"Milieu Offensive\" was seen as a national security threat and a very radical movement. They were monitored by the local police, because the AIVD doesn't do that itself. Four months before the murder Volkert speaks with his friend Sjoerd van der W. over the telephone. One says, \"the bastard has to die.\" \"Ssst\", says the other voice. \"We might be monitored.\" \"I mean shut his mouth of course,\" says the other again.\" 47\n\nIt is true that the killer of Fortuyn, Volkert van der Graaf, is quite strongly linked to the murder of environmental officer Chris van der Werken in 1996. Just the fact that van der Graaf sat across the table with Van der Werken, having heated arguments with him immediately before his death is already seriously bizarre. But a red Opel Kadett, a car similar to the one of van der Graaf at the time, was also seen near the murder site. Reportedly van der Graaf had threatened to kill Van der Werken. 48 So it is very much possible that the AIVD and Justice Department had something on Van der Graaf and were using it against him in their manipulations.\n\nThe conversation mentioned by Ross, however, is not at all strong evidence of a murder plot by Dutch intelligence. It's just a small, isolated section of a longer conversation. In private many people say things like this all the time without literally meaning it. Maybe they were even joking. Who knows? But certainly it can't be denied that van der Graaf was monitored by Dutch intelligence and should have been a major suspect in a previous murder case.\n\nSecurity state fully penetrated terrorist cell of Van Gogh killer\n\nAlso with the death of Theo van Gogh links to Dutch intelligence are all over the place. Ross:\n\n\"The AIVD hired out a flat to Samir A. They bugged that flat from top to bottom. That's how they knew [there were plans to murder van Gogh]. Is this allowed? Apparently it is. The AIVD was not reprimanded over that. With Mohammed B. nothing happened anymore, he was just allowed to do as he pleased, even though the AIVD knew. Unbelievable.\" 49\n\nThe details of Theo van Gogh's murder were discussed in the 2005 documentary Prettig Weekend Ondanks Alles (Despite Everything, Have a Great Weekend) with media personality Katja Schuurman and Stan de Jong, a relatively mainstream journalist who was acquainted with Micha Kat and has written about controversial affairs, including the Dutroux X-Dossiers. A summary of the documentary:\n\nAfter Van Gogh's murder, the police raided the house of the neighbor of Mohammed B. The international media is shown this house at the time - not the one of Mohammed B. It takes two days for the police to figure out their mistake, despite the fact that Mohammed B. is already known as a criminal by the police and a dangerous radical by Dutch intelligence. The neighbor of Mohammed B., Ibrahim ben Salah, who actually looks like a Middle-Eastern gangster, states: \"The Justice Department claims that Mohammed B. often came here. That's not possible. Mohammed B. never came here. I didn't even have contact with Mohammed B.\"\n\nA tape is shown of an initial press conference with a police chief and chief prosecutor Leo de Wit. The latter claims: \"Er, er, in our local police and, er, justice files he was, er, let me say, with exception of a relatively minor, er, incident, not known.\" A year later, reminded by Schuurman of his statement \"[one] relatively minor incident\", de Wit reacts: \"No, no, no. That is not true. That has not been said in that sense.\" De Wit is also confronted with his reply at the time to the question: \"Was [Mohammed] known with the intelligence services, the RID for example?,\" to which De Wit responded: \"Er, no. [comes across as really unsure]\" To Schuurman de Wit claims: \"This has not been recorded from my mouth. Because I wouldn't say that.\"\n\nDe Wit had to crawl back, because Mohammed B. was involved in more than \"[one] relatively minor incident\". The documentary provides the following incidents:\n\nSpring 2000: Mohammed's 17-year-old sister calls the police and claims that she is being kidnapped by her older brother, who doesn't agree with her choice to have a person with the name Abdul as a boyfriend.\n\nSummer 2000: Causes a fight to break out at a local bar when walking in front of a television several times. He is convicted of assault.\n\nJuly 2001: Mohammed runs into his sister's ex, Abdul. A fight breaks out, Mohammed grabs a knife, and soon even attacks a police officer with it. Mohammed is given a three month jail sentence for intimidation and public violence.\n\nMay 2004: Mohammed is involved in a scuffle with a security guard at social services, because he's of the opinion that he is not helped quickly enough. He throws around a dustbin and shouts: \"I will kill you. I will rip out your heart.\"\n\nSeptember 2004: Control officers catch Mohammed without a card in the tram. He fights with the officers and is arrested by the police. During a hearing he refuses to give the police officer a hand and spits on the floor. During a search of his house the police finds telephone numbers and email addresses belonging to members of the Hofstad group. These are given to Dutch intelligence, who already at this point knew Mohammed was a dangerous radical.\n\nMohammed was involved in the terrorist Hofstad group. The imam of the Hofstad Group was \"the Syrian\", who was recruiting members for the Jihad and lived above an Amsterdam call store where the Hofstad Group held meetings. A witness from across the street explained that several police searches had been carried out at the call store and sometimes police was apparently on the lookout for persons involved in the store. Mohammed B. was among the visitors of this store. Another was Samir A., who worked at the call store and is a known terrorist plotter.\n\nHofstad Group member Jason Walthers (a.k.a. Abu Amrikie, a son of an American soldier who was stationed in the Netherlands) and an accomplice were arrested on November 10, 2004, after a raid on his house in the wake of the Theo van Gogh murder. During the raid a grenade is thrown to the police. Several years before, Jason and other members of the Hofstad Group would have followed a terrorist training course in Pakistan. However, according to the defense of Walthers, the grenade was delivered by Saleh Bouali, an informant/employee of Dutch intelligence. This was never proved, but there were other indications of penetration by Dutch intelligence. Robert Maanicus, the lawyer of Jason Walthers: \"He has had contact with Ed Aarts from a certain real estate company who made sure that he was able to get into that apartment. And who that Ed Aarts is, I don't know. For some obscure reason all information concerning Ed Aarts has disappeared. The business card with his phone number that my client carried with him is gone and all the information in the dossier that can be traced to Ed Aerts have somehow been terminated. The mobile phone number doesn't exist anymore. The company doesn't exist anymore. It's all a little mysterious.\"\n\nRuud Lubbers, VPRO Argos, 2005: \"A peculiar situation ... I think that the intelligence service put into practice something that is very common: give us all the information, but don't arrest this man. We follow them and this is how we get additional information.\"\n\nJan Vlug, lawyer of Hofstad Group member Zakaria T. : \"Let I put it this way: they were in the bushes of everyone except with Mohammed B. And that is very strange, because he was once arrested [with] a martyr testament in his pocket. That has been copied and sent to the AIVD [Dutch intelligence]. Nothing was done with it. There have been more run-ins with the police. Nothing done with it. All the meetings [of the Hofstad Group] took place at his home. Nothing done with it. ... Several have been approached to become informants of the AIVD. Zakaria also. When Zakaria came back from Pakistan [from terrorist training] he was awaited at Schiphol. ... in January 2004. ... Both Jason and Zakaria said no to that [Jason's lawyer claimed that Jason was not approached, but others had been] ... I don't know, but if [Mohammed B.] has been an informant of Dutch intelligence that would explain a lot.\"\n\nAlthough it's entirely possible that Dutch intelligence couldn't have prevented the murder of Theo van Gogh, because this specific murder plot was not discussed in the Hofstad Group's apartment or with informants, clearly there are additional questions to be asked here. Certainly the Netherlands could be much stricter in dealing with Jihadists, for example by not providing citizenship to any overly religious Muslims.\n\nFortuyn spied on by Dutch intelligence, sensitive information leaked\n\nWhen it comes to preventing the murders of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh one can argue that Dutch intelligence, the AIVD, failed. However, the AIVD was also spying on Pim Fortuyn and in this case they appear to have overstepped democratic boundaries and at the same time failed to blow the whistle on certain \"extracurricular\" activities of Fortuyn and friends.\n\nIt was initially denied by the AIVD and the interior minister, Klaas de Vries. When interviewed by the evening news, De Vries came across as incredibly nervous and uptight, so it was clear from the beginning that something was not in order:\n\n\"That is absolute hogwash [that Pim Fortuyn was spied upon]. It wouldn't come in the heads of the secret services in the Netherlands to tap politicians and on top of that one wouldn't find a minister who would sign off on that. So it is total hogwash. ... Yes, with all eavesdropping activities of the BVD [AIVD] autographs of four ministers are necessary, but, well, such a case wouldn't even be presented because the BVD [AIVD] is busy with entirely different things. It's busy with the protection of democracy, not subverting it. ... Completely impossible [that the AIVD acted on its own initiative]. ... I can't say anything about all [this], lady. I can only briefly inform you that that is complete nonsense.\" 50\n\nThese initial statements of De Vries are really fascinating, because, first of all, Fortuyn most certainly had been spied upon. 51 And secondly, in 2013 it was revealed that \"the AIVD taps members of the political parties\" and that the security service has been trying to hide this fact. 52\n\nThe spy operations against Fortuyn appear to have exceeded mere eavesdropping. According to close friends, not only were Fortuyn's home, car and mobile phone tapped, confidential information discussed in private was sometimes leaked to the press. To counter the intrusions, Fortuyn's electoral clique actually spoke in code on occasion and invited individuals they met with to public places, keeping their cell phones out of range of any sensitive discussions. Just before his death, it was even decided that Fortuyn would stay with friends in order to increase his safety and privacy. These aspects were mentioned in 2005 round table discussion on Barend and van Dorp with former minister of the interior Klaas de Vries present. A partial transcript:\n\nFrits Barend: Next Sunday Peter R. de Vries will reveal in his program discs that should show that Pim Fortuyn definitely has been listened in upon and has been been followed. That has always been denied ...\n\nKlaas de Vries: You are telling me things that I have not yet seen, er, ... no, certainly not. I didn't know anything about that. [comes across as really nervous] ... You may be saying that [I should have known about the eavesdropping as the minister responsible for the AIVD], but what has happened is that it was local police and that they have looked into if there was a question of a problematic situation with Pim Fortuyn - if he was being threatened, or if he might be susceptible to blackmail. ... After consulting with the Justice Department they concluded that there were no problems. ...\n\nYves Gijrath, organizer Millionaire's Fair: Did you know that he was being followed? Did you know that his house was being bugged? That he was being followed on the streets? That he was deathly afraid? ...\n\nDe Vries: No, absolutely not. ...\n\nGijrath: That in March he was threatened in a restaurant in The Hague? There's a police report of that [which] has never been made public. You know about that.\n\nDe Vries: Yes, but all that has been investigated, right?\n\nGijrath: He was deathly afraid and he only wanted security if it was offered by Wim Kok and not by anyone else. And so I asked him once, \"So, why are you so afraid?\" It was April 30, Queen's Day, six days before his death. ...Isn't it about time you get some real security? He was not going to sleep at home anymore. He was going to spent nights somewhere in Groningen. I say, \"Are you still not being offered any security?\" \"No, because they are eavesdropping on me.\" So I say, \"How is that possible? Who is doing that?\" There's only one person. That is you.\n\nDe Vries: Yeah, but that is just not the case.\n\nGijrath: Is he making it up then? I walked through his house. That thing [telephone] didn't even work. It was completely [jammed]. ...\n\nDe Vries: Yeah, well, I have not been jamming that phone there and there has been an unbelievably in-depth investigation of the Van den Haak Commission and they was concluded that this is all not true.\n\nFrits Barend: We also read other things. I think it was a very concealed investigation, a very bad investigation if I'm being honest.\n\nDe Vries: Yeah, well. [Huge smug on his face.]\n\nFrits Barend: All you read is the Justice Department didn't do anything wrong. The police didn't do anything wrong. The AIVD didn't do anything wrong. Nobody did anything wrong. ...\n\nVan Dorp: I will give you one example. On the day that he was murdered, four hours later, detectives from Gooi and Vechstreek enter his home, make a mess of everything and check everything. What are they doing there? ...\n\nDe Vries: At the moment I think they were busy to see if there indeed were threats, or something like that, but I mean the Van den Haak Commission really has investigated everything.\n\nFrits Barend: Well, that certainly happened, because a realtor was present and [a policeman] says \"Ha! We found it!\" And that realtor was never interviewed. He was not believed. And [Rotterdam mayor's secretary and Pim Fortuyn party member] Joost Eerdmans concludes from that that most certainly eavesdropping equipment was gathered. And what's also strange is that with [the home of killer] Volkert van der G. it was four to five days before the search warrant was provided. 53\n\nKlaas de Vries comes across as a character from a movie. Even though he's terse, arrogant, and considers the government as the absolute and final authority, he's also absolutely hilarious. He looks like a gerbil in distress and is witty in all the wrong ways. As for his biography, naturally he has been hanging out with the \"in\" crowd for a good number of years:\n\nLabor MP 1973-1988.\n\nChair Inquiry Commission on Construction Subsidies 1986-1988.\n\nChair of the elite Social-Economic Council 1996-1998.\n\nMinister of labor and social affairs 1998-2000.\n\nMinister of the interior 2000-2002.\n\nVisitor of Bilderberg in 2003.\n\nDirector Atlantic Commission.\n\nMember North-Atlantic Assembly.\n\nAdvisory board of the leading energy company Eneco 2007-.\n\nSenator 2007-2015.\n\nOn the board of the in 2009 founded and pro-Palestinian The Rights Forum, together with Holland's political elite: Dries van Agt (founder and chair), Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, Hans van den Broek, Wim van Eekelen, Hedy d'Ancona (Republican Society), Pieter Kooijmans and Jan Pronk.\n\nIt's hard to say who exactly gave the order to tap Pim Fortuyn's phone and for exactly what reason. I myself experienced a number of \"anomalies\" when first establishing ISGP. For a brief while, all books ordered from England permanently disappeared while books from the U.S. or elsewhere caused no problems. At least one major phone anomaly occurred in this same period, with me picking up the phone and having some type of instant connection to a room where apparently servers were running in the background. I even received a bogus top secret JASON Group briefing document on how to protect America's nuclear power plants from terrorist attacks. A full week later this email and everything in the inbox vanished all of a sudden, something that has never happened before or since. In my case it appears that an international element was involved. To what extent the AIVD or interior minister Klaas de Vries were informed, I cannot say. With Fortuyn it is also anybody's guess to what extent official protocol was followed.\n\nIn any case, it's quite incredible that this is how soon-to-be Holland's most powerful politician was forced to live in the months before his death: demonized, afraid for his life and spied on by unknown forces. Assuming that the claims of his friends are true, it's hard to imagine that the powers that be had any intention of letting Fortuyn become prime minister. His eventual murder seems to have been almost inevitable.\n\nFortuyn's lawyer, Oscar Hammerstein, linked to state manipulation\n\nWhen a few days after the Barend and van Dorp round table discussion Holland's most famous crime reporter, Peter R. de Vries, a major disinformer on the John F. Kennedy assassination 54, revealed that indeed the AIVD had been tapping Fortuyn's phone, he also informed the world that the security service had gathered evidence that Pim Fortuyn was a child rapist. 55 Apart from this curious \"leak\" being incredibly convenient to the ruling establishment, some circumstantial evidence exists that this claim might well be true. Theo van Gogh and Tomas Ross were not Fortuyn's only peculiar friends. We definitely shouldn't overlook well-known Dutch attorney Oscar Hammerstein, who was Fortuyn's chief lawyer throughout his political campaign and after his death also the one who prominently criticized the media and political establishment for having demonized Fortuyn. 56\n\nHammerstein has been a close friend and long-time law partner of Frits Salomonson, in turn a chief advisor and very close friend of the Dutch royal family. He himself is said to have regularly met with Crown Prince Alexander (now king). In addition, both lawyers have been accused of child abuse. Salomonson publicly; Hammerstein only in a file that has never been discussed by the mainstream media. Then there is the old law partner of this duo, Count Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck (b. 1949), who ISGP independently connected to the Westerflier child abuse cult described in the Dutroux X-Dossiers, also first made available by ISGP, and certainly to the English-speaking world. Accusations of mafia connections are mixed in with these lesser known suspicions. 57\n\nIf that's not enough, in 2004 Hammerstein put up the funds for \"alternative\" media outlet The Stopped Smoker (De Gestopte Roker), a continuation of Van Gogh's activist internet platform The Healthy Smoker (De Gezonde Roker). 58 This enterprise appears to have cost Hammerstein several tens of thousands of euros per year. 59 It also means that Hammerstein provided a platform for Republican Society member Pamela Hemelrijk and her fellow activist Micha Kat, who in this period began a soon-to-be very prominent campaign against Joris Demmink, a Justice Department secretary general repeatedly accused of child sexual abuse, along with a number of high-level colleagues. The problem is, as ISGP has been writing about in another article, that Kat and a handful of activists have been logistically and financially backed by persons with questionable ties to the U.S. national security state and CIA drug trafficking. In addition, a lot of the witnesses and evidence Kat and associates have produced is completely bogus. Therefore one is forced to concluded that all these individuals are involved in some kind of high level security state scheme.\n\nThere are additional indications to draw this conclusion. First there are the child abuse accusations against Hammerstein and Salomonson. These accusations also exist against Pim Fortuyn and Gerard Spong, another very prominent lawyer who, along with Hammerstein, tried to sue members of the establishment after the assassination of Fortuyn. 60 The person most doggedly pursuing these accusations? Hammerstein's old employee at the The Healthy Smoker, Micha Kat. 61 How bizarre is that? And how strange is it that all the child abuse accusations that have been thrown about in the Netherlands involve homosexual sex, including those leveled against Demmink and his fellow Prosecutor Office officials? The only heterosexual ones about the Netherlands are those unearthed in the Dutroux X-Dossiers by this author.\n\nIt seems that we can go on forever with bizarre coincidences and associations. How about the fact that another financier of the The Stopped Smoker was the More Freedom Foundation (Stichting MeerVrijheid), a typical Old Right libertarian controlled opposition outfit. On its advisory board is a person from the Ludwig von Mises Institute and another with an extensive background in NATO, the Dutch version of the Council on Foreign Relations (Clingendael) and various conservative American institutes. 62 It's very hard to imagine that Hammerstein and Stichting MeerVrijheid were running a truly alternative media outlet independent of the security state.\n\nHammerstein may not have been Republican Society, but judging by his friends and activities he easily could have been. Most likely he was just a little too close to the royal house for his membership to be credible. In any case, Hammerstein provides additional evidence that Fortuyn was part of a very peculiar set of intelligence assets. He was not independent at all.\n\nPart 3\n\nFortuyn killer financed by Rockefeller-Orange NGO network\n\nIn his 2014 book, Hammerstein fiercely criticizes the green activists who opposed his friend Fortuyn, comparing them to Muslim extremists. 63 He wasn't just referring to Fortuyn's assassin Volkert van der Graaf, but also to three environmentalists of the \"Biological Bakery Brigade\" who on March 14, 2002, about 7 weeks before the assassination, threw cakes filled with animal feces into Fortuyn's face. Hammerstein went along to the police with Fortuyn to press charges. 64 No action was taken at the time.\n\nAfter the assassination, the press still hardly paid any attention to the activist network of the cake throwers and the assassin, Volkert van der Graaf. The only \"authority\" on these green activist networks sporadically allowed in the press was Peter Siebelt, an ultra-right wing asset of the security state who has been equating green activism with terrorism and organized crime. According to Siebelt, there's evidence that the activist networks of Van der Graaf and the \"Biological Bakery Brigade\" overlapped, but in the end he sticks to the conclusion that these green \"terrorist\" activists are controlled by the Dutch Green Party and a handful of well-known lawyers. 65\n\nHowever, let's face it, the green movement is controlled by the globalist group, in the Netherlands centered around Hammerstein's beloved royal family. And thus it is no surprise to see that the bizarre incestuous connections and associations continue when we shift our focus from Fortuyn's coterie and look into the direction of his killer, environmental activist Volkert van der Graaf. We already discussed how the police considered Van der Graaf a major suspect in the still unexplained murder of environmental officer Chris van der Werken and how Van der Graaf's phone was tapped by Dutch intelligence in the period leading up to the death of Fortuyn. If these two facts were connected is not known. One is tempted to think that the monitoring of Van der Graaf's phone simply had to do with his activities for the Vereniging Milieu Offensief (Milieu Front Association) and was just a left-over of the old Cold War security service paranoia against anything even remotely leftist.\n\nWhatever the exact reasons were for the tapping of Van der Graaf's phone, his position as co-founder, secretary and treasurer of Vereniging Milieu Offensief (Milieu Front Association) 66 put him right on the frontline of the battle between the international liberal and conservative superclass. Any right-wing or establishment-oriented security service would consider a group as the Vereniging Milieu Offensief a prime target for putting one of their agents in.\n\nMore importantly, the liberal establishment has literally built up and continues to maintain the international green movement. ISGP first noticed this with the secretive 1001 Club, which helps maintain the World Wide Fund for Nature. Founded by Prince Bernhard, among its members have been Prince Philip, the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Bechtels, Liechtensteins, Habsburgs and other top families. But the WWF is not unique at all in this regard. Dozens and dozens of environmentalist groups receive millions upon millions from the top liberal foundations: Packard Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Tides, etc. Among the more important environmentalist groups they maintain are:\n\nWWF and Peace Parks Foundation\n\nGreenpeace\n\nFriends of the Earth\n\nSierra Club\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council\n\nRainforest Action Network\n\nWondering if Fortuyn assassin Volkert van der Graaf had any connection to these groups, I quickly noticed that his Vereniging Milieu Offensief (Milieu Front Association) had its headquarters at Milieudefensie (Milieu Defense). 67 And lo and behold, Milieudefensie is the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth 68, one of these heavily NGO-funded environmental groups by the liberal establishment. Just a few years ago, I was only able to figure out that 1001 Club members as Robert Anderson, Maurice Strong, the Rockefellers, Aurelio Peccei (subordinate of Gianni Agnelli of the 1001 Club) and the billionaire Ted Turner were involved in financing and even running Friends of the Earth. 69 Today ISGP has gathered much more information. What follows is a partial, cumulative list of grants by major foundations to Friends of the Earth in the years surrounding the assassination of Pim Fortuyn.\n\nPartial Friends of the Earth financing surrounding the death of Pim Fortuyn\n\n1999 Kellogg Foundation $20,000 1999 Packard Foundation $45,000 2000 John Merck Fund $45,000 2000 Hochschild Foundation $30,000 2001 Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors $50,000 2001 Rockefeller Brothers Fund $1,427,500 2001 Merck Family Fund $105,444 2001 MacArthur Foundation $870,000 2001 Threshold Foundation $86,000 2002 Rockefeller Family Fund $400,000 2002 Pew Charitable Trusts $555,000 2002 Turner Foundation $425,000 2003 Ford Foundation $2,243,901 2004 Mott Foundation $7,303,965 2005 Tides Foundation $142,811 TOTAL $13,749,621\n\nWhat is a shame is that most of these numbers have to come from conservative ultraright websites as activistfacts.com. Most numbers and foundation names can be confirmed though through available annual reports of Friends of the Earth. Exact sources are provided in ISGP's \"liberal CIA\" oversight, where also much more information about all these foundations can be found.\n\nBased on the name (offense vs defense) of Van der Graaf's tiny Vereniging Milieu Offensief (Milieu Front Association) and its location in the same building as the Wageningen branch of Milieudefensie / Friends of the Earth 70, it makes one wonder to what extent Van der Graaf coordinated the founding of his group with Friends of the Earth. Curiously, little to nothing has been written about this subject. What we do know is that Vereniging Milieu Offensief (Milieu Front Association) and Friends of the Earth were closely working together in filing a constant stream of law suits against farmers over environmental issues. 71 Another very significant clue appears to be that Sjoerd van der Wouw, the person with whom Van der Graaf founded Vereniging Milieu Offensief (Milieu Front Association) in 1992 and his chief partner throughout the 1990s in operating the NGO (Van der Wouw as chair and Van der Graaf as secretary-treasurer) at some point worked for Milieudefensie / Friends of the Earth Netherlands. 72\n\nEven more significant, Van der Graaf's Vereniging Milieu Offensief (Milieu Front Association), as well as the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth, were financed by the solidly \"liberal CIA\" Nationale Postcode Loterij (Dutch National Lottery). Through the Stichting Doen (Doen Foundation) the Dutch National Lottery put just over 150,000 euros in the treasure chest of the Vereniging Milieu Offensief (Milieu Front Association) in the 1992-1998 period. 73 It appears these funds, which would have largely been managed by co-founder, secretary and treasurer Volkert van der Graaf, were used to get the Milieu Front Association going until it could operate independently. By the late 1990s a lot of income was generated by farmers buying off the Milieu Front Association to prevent expensive law suits 74, which may explain why the funds of the Nationale Postcode loterij dried up.\n\nAll this may not seem very exciting until we realize that the Doen Foundation is a partner of the Rockefeller, Ford, Open Society (Soros), Omidyar and other \"liberal CIA\" foundations in a variety of international programs. 75 Also, the Nationale Postcode Loterij was co-founded in 1989 by Boudewijn Poelmann, the European director of the UN- and \"liberal CIA\"-funded Inter Press Service and a 10-year employee of Novib; and Simon Jelsma, who, judging by the portrait of Prince Bernhard hanging on the wall of his home 76, most likely was very friendly with the prince. In 1959 Jelsma and Prince Bernhard both founded Novib, the Dutch branch of the prestigious pro-Third World immigration \"liberal CIA\" NGO Oxfam International.\n\nOxfam Novib has counted the involvement of numerous members of the Dutch political elite. On the board over the decades we find former prime ministers and secretaries of state, some whom have also headed the Dutch Carnegie Foundation, the Dutch Institute of International Affairs (Clingendael), visited Bilderberg or have other international superclass ties. Outgoing prime minister at the time of the Fortuyn assassination, Wim Kok, has been among them. 77 International branches of Oxfam are financed by the same foundations we have just mentioned in relation to Friends of the Earth. The Holland-based Stichting Oxfam Novib itself received $1.5 million from the Ford Foundation alone in the 2008-2014 period. 78 As for the Nationale Postcode loterij / Dutch National Lottery, Jelsma and friends established it as a milch cow to fund their favorite sustainable development NGOs. Unsurprisingly, the Postcode Loterij has become a mainstay of the Dutch media cult, especially around New Year's; a national lottery that invests in charitable causes truly is one of the best ways ever devised to fund an NGO network.\n\nIf these facts ever become widely-reported, the mainstream media will undoubtedly spin the story by suggesting that the public - those participating in the National Lottery - financed the assassination of Fortuyn. The fact, however, is that the political elite and superclass surrounding the Dutch royal family and the Rockefeller philanthropy network directly financed the activities of Fortuyn killer Volkert van der Graaf. Not only that, Dutch elites managing the Oxfam Novib/National Lottery network (or their sons) held positions in the cabinets of Wim Kok and even of Jan-Peter Balkenende, the guaranteed prime minister after the death of Fortuyn. Individuals that come to mind are Wim Kok, Ben Bot, Benk Korthals from Oxfam Novib 79, as well as Dutch National Lottery Holding chairs Cees Veerman and Pieter Winsemius.\n\nVeerman and Winsemius in particular are quite incredible conflicts of interests and a slap in the face of the public. In the 1997-2002 period Veerman was chair of Wageningen University, where Volkert van der Graaf had first become part of an organized and radical environmentalist network and apparently also where \"several professors ... maintain very radical [environmentalist] convictions.\" 80 After the death of Fortuyn, new prime minister Balkenende made Veerman minister of agriculture and nature/the environment (2002-2007). After his retirement, he's provided a seat on the advisory board of the huge Rabobank and is made chair of the Dutch National Lottery Holding, which used to finance Van der Graaf's activities. 81\n\nBefore him, in the 2001-2012 period, the elitist Winsemius held the chairmanship of the Dutch National Lottery Holding, thus in the period it financed Van der Graaf's activities. In 2006-2007 he briefly became Balkenende's minister for housing, spatial planning and the environment. 82\n\nIf anybody wonders if maybe the Dutch Justice Department wouldn't have been worried about these conflicts of interest, a month after the death of Fortuyn, prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende appointed Piet Hein Donner as his minister of justice. Donner was personally familiar with Volkert van der Graaf. Just months before his appointment as justice minister, he was chairman of the environmental affairs room of the Council of State / Privy Council which processed Van der Graaf numerous law suits. He personally met Fortuyn's assassin before Fortuyn's death and then was tasked with investigating the case. 83 The more one thinks about it, the more it boggles the mind.\n\nAnother person Donner was tasked to investigate was a certain Baroness Pauline van Tuyll van Serooskerken, one of three environmentalists of the \"Biological Bakery Brigade\" who on March 14, 2002, about 7 weeks before the assassination, threw cakes filled with animal feces into Fortuyn's face. Fortuyn and his lawyer Oscar Hammerstein complained to the police at the time, but no action was undertaken until Fortuyn was shot. At this point the three were arrested, but also quickly released, not to be heard of again. The baroness' name was mentioned in only a few newspapers (as \"Pauline van T. van S.\") 84 and the only reason ISGP is writing about her here is after writing biographies of all Dutch members of Prince Bernhard's 1001 Club. As it turns out, Baroness Pauline van Tuyll van Serooskerken is a member of a sustainable development-obsessed family with two members in the 1001 Club and with additional ties to the British aristocracy. 85 One member of the family slithered into Fortuyn's LPF 86; another joined the peculiar Party for the Animals as 14th on the list of electable candidates. The number one on the list, Marianne Thieme 87, hired Sjoerd van der Wouw, the chief partner of Fortuyn killer Volkert van der Graaf in the Milieu Front Association, as her personal assistant. 88 In another coincidence, the most important financier of Thieme's Party for the Animals and her congressional campaign was a member of the Pierson banking fortune 89 - the same family that could be found in Prince Bernhard's 1001 Club. 90 Ironically, the Pierson bank is also linked to the Republican Society and Elsevier magazine, the most virulent anti-socialist/green party publication around.\n\nWe can continue discussing anomalies surrounding Marianne Thieme and her Party for the Animals. As discussed in ISGP's article on crop circle, at one point this author looked up a person in the audience of Catherine Keyl back in 1998 who backed up the stories of program guest Robbert van den Broeke, a notorious crop circle and paranormal hoaxer with high level family ties to the RABO Bank. This person, Janny Korteweg, appears to have have been the mother-in-law of Marianne Thieme. One wonders what the chances of that are.\n\nGoing back to Pim Fortuyn cake thrower Barones Pauline van Tuyll van Serooskerken, her family associations have not been investigated by the mainstream media. The situation is so bad that in 2013 Baroness Pauline could go on mainstream television without anyone even recognizing her as one of the cake throwers. The baroness even lists on her LinkedIn to have worked for Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth in 2010, but no one has picked up on this either. 91\n\nOnly much later than the 1001 Club link, I also noticed that the Van Tuyll van Serooskerken family has been rather prominent in the so-called Illustrious Sweet Woman Brotherhood (Illustre lieve vrouwe broederschap), also known as the Swan Brothers (Zwanenbroeders), that has revolved around the Orange royal family for centuries and goes back to 1316 - the era of Habsburg domination of the Holy Roman Empire, the Black Plague and the Mongol Empire stretching to Eastern Europe. Quite a few other aristocratic Dutch families can be found in the Swan Brothers - Van Lanschot, Fentener van Vlissingen, de Vos van Steenwijk, Philips and others 92 - with a degree of overlap existing with Bernhard's 1001 Club. The overlap is not very great, however, but the fact that the Van Tuyll van Serooskerken family has been rather prominent in both strongly indicates that a good number of family members have been close to Prince Bernhard and Queen Beatrix over the years.\n\nThe connection of cake thrower Baroness Pauline to the Swan Brothers (or Brotherhood of the Swan) is actually slightly closer than to the 1001 Club, at least when looking at family ties. The Tuyll van Serooskerken family members in the 1001 Club have been Baron Freddie and his son Baron George. The last common ancestor they had with Baroness Pauline is Baron Frederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken (1742-1805). That's a long time ago. With the Swan Brothers, her connection runs through her great-grandfather Baron Frederick (1886-1958). 93\n\nFurthermore, it would be interesting to know how close Baroness Pauline has been to her cousin, the Swan Brother Sammy Tuyll van Serooskerken, a liberal politician of moderate standing who held posts at the Dutch Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and the European Union in Brussels. Significantly, in the 1994-1995 period this Serooskerken co-founded the Tindemans Group that looked into how to best bring the general public into the \"debate\" (read: \"agenda\") of the eastward expansion of the European Union, which came to pass over the next 10-13 years. Leo Tindemans, a former prime minister of Belgian, was a close ally of the ultraright Opus Dei figure Otto von Habsburg. He co-founded the Luxembourg branch of the Europaeisches Institut fuer Sicherheitsfragen with Habsburg and is known to visited the notorious Cercle group. Another member of the Tindemans Group was the then Dutch MP Ernst Hirsch Ballin, who benefited from Fortuyn's death because Balkenende, the prime minister who won the elections due to Fortuyn's death, appointed Ballin minister of justice in 2006. Ballin is also among a number of key protectors Joris Demmink seems to have had in government.\n\nObviously, in a normal, free society the media would be digging as deep as they could to find any potential links between Van der Graaf, Baroness Pauline and their Friends of the Earth-centered activism, as well as any government or other elite ties. Only one ultraright intelligence asset, Peter Siebelt, has been doing this, but, of course, this individual never mentions the liberal superclass control over the environmental movement, instead preferring to label the Green Party, Socialist Party and Labor Party as the controlling forces of the major national \"green\" foundations and the action groups underneath them. 94\n\nFortuyn killer's lawyers linked to Rockefeller-Soros superclass AND Republican Society\n\nThere's another aspect of the \"eco nostra\" that Siebelt described, but in which he also ignored the superclass aspect: lawyers that support green activists. As it happens, the first lawyer Van der Graaf asked for after his arrest was Pieter Bakker Schut. Schut declined 95, but a radical left-wing ally of his who worked with some of his former law partners 96 and had been a fellow sympathizer of the Rote Armee Fraktion terrorist group 97, Britta Bohler, did take the case and handed it to her employee, A.A. Stijn Franken. 98\n\nLooking at her background, in the 1991-1994 period Bohler worked at Loeff Claeys Verbeke 99, the same law firm the notorious duo Hammerstein and royal family lawyer Salomonson worked for a few years earlier. 100 Hammerstein, of course, became Fortuyn's trusted sidekick during the electoral process. Then, from 1994 to 1999, Bohler was secretary of Greenpeace Netherlands, followed by a stint, from 1999 to 2002, as chairman. 101 In fact, she was forced to resign as chairman of Greenpeace as a result of picking up the defense of Fortuyn. 102 How amazing is this? Here we have the national Greenpeace head picking up legal defense of a Friends of the Earth-affiliated environmental terrorist. One would think that the environmental movement would prefer to distance itself as far as possible from one of their activists-turned-political assassins. It is that the national newspapers have been cooperative in not raising any questions, but Bohler has made it rather easy for them to portray the environmental movement as a unified front supporting political assassinations. Of course, as already mentioned, Greenpeace is financed by the exact same superclass foundations as Friends of the Earth: Rockefeller Foundation, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Ford Foundation, Mott, Tides, Turner, Packard, Hewlett, etc. These foundations are always among the top donors. 103 And in ISGP's Pilgrims Society it has also already been documented in detail how foundations as Rockefeller and Ford operated as an extension of the CIA and a number of U.S. cabinet officials.\n\nAmazingly, Britta Bohler was another member of the Republican Soci"
