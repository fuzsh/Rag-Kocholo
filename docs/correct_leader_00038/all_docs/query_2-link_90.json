Jan. 18, 1960, Béziers, Hérault, France), high commissioner of French Polynesia (2016-19). He was also prefect of the French départements of Hautes-Pyrénées (2010-11), Pyrénées-Orientales (2011-14), Eure (2014-16), and Maine-et-Loire (2019-20).\n\nBidault\n\nBidault, Georges (Augustin) (b. Oct. 5, 1899, Moulins, Allier, France - d. Jan. 27, 1983, Cambo-les-Bains, Pyrénées-Atlantiques), prime minister of France (1946, 1949-50). In 1941 he joined the National Council of Resistance, of which he became president in 1943 after the death of Jean Moulin. In 1944 he was a founder of the Mouvement Républicain Populaire, a Christian-Democratic party. As foreign minister (1944-46) in Charles de Gaulle's provisional government, Bidault signed the Franco-Soviet alliance in December 1944 and in the following year signed the UN Charter. After heading the provisional government in 1946, he was again foreign minister in 1947-48, prime minister in 1949-50, defense minister in 1951-52, and once more foreign minister in 1953-54. With the return of de Gaulle to power (1958), Bidault broke with his wartime friend over the issue of Algerian independence and founded a new, right-wing Christian-Democratic Party. When de Gaulle put down a coup and negotiated Algerian independence in 1961, Bidault, still a member of the National Assembly, created a national council of resistance that advocated terrorism in France and Algeria to prevent Algerian independence, and went underground, claiming the illegality of de Gaulle's government. Charged with conspiracy and stripped of his parliamentary immunity from arrest, he fled France in 1962, living in neighbouring countries and Brazil (1963-67). In 1968, after an amnesty declared by de Gaulle for all those accused of crimes against the state during the Algerian war, Bidault returned to France and founded the right-wing Mouvement pour la justice et la liberté, but this failed to make a mark in French politics. He became honorary president of the Christian-Democratic Party in 1977.\n\nBiddle, Charles (b. Dec. 24, 1745, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - d. April 4, 1821, Philadelphia), acting president of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania (1785).\n\nBiddle, Francis (Beverley) (b. May 9, 1886, Paris, France - d. Oct. 4, 1968, Hyannis, Mass.), U.S. solicitor general (1940-41) and attorney general (1941-45).\n\nBiddle, Livingston L(udlow), Jr. (b. May 26, 1918, Bryn Mawr, Pa. - d. May 3, 2002, Washington, D.C.), chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (1977-81).\n\nBiddulph, John (b. July 25, 1840 - d. Dec. 31, 1921, Ham Common, Surrey [now part of London], England), acting chief commissioner of Baluchistan (1891).\n\nBiddulph, Sir Robert (b. Aug. 26, 1835, London, England - d. Nov. 18, 1918, London), high commissioner of Cyprus (1879-86) and governor of Gibraltar (1893-1900); knighted 1880.\n\nBiden\n\nBiden, Joe, byname of Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. (b. Nov. 20, 1942, Scranton, Pa.), vice president (2009-17) and president (2021- ) of the United States. The Democrat from Delaware was first elected to the Senate in 1972. He unsuccessfully ran for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations. In 2008 he became Democratic candidate Barack Obama's running mate. Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, brought years of experience that served to help counter Republican arguments that an Obama administration would be inexperienced on foreign policy. With the success of the ticket, he became vice-president-elect in November. In office, he maintained his reputation of being prone to verbal gaffes. In April 2019 he entered the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. He fared poorly in the first three contests, and his gaffes only became more serious, but when he won in South Carolina - his first win in any of his presidential runs - the Democratic establishment rallied around him as the candidate to stop progressive insurgent Bernie Sanders; at Super Tuesday (March 3, 2020), he took over the lead from Sanders. When Sanders dropped out of the race in April 2020, Biden emerged as the presumptive nominee. In June he secured a majority of delegates. In August he named Kamala Harris as his running mate and was officially nominated. It was clear that the election would be more than anything a referendum on Pres. Donald Trump, Biden being essentially a placeholder for a return to normalcy, without provoking excitement for any policy proposals of his own. He conducted a low-key campaign, explained - or conveniently excused - by the COVID-19 pandemic, and stayed behind expectations in the November election, while still defeating Trump 51%-47% and flipping five states to win 306 electoral votes. His proclaimed \"battle for the soul of the nation\" had not been won as decisively as to put an immediate end to the cult of Trump, who refused to concede and rallied his forces behind the fiction of a \"stolen\" election. On taking office, Biden, at 78, not only obliterated the record that had just been set by Trump as the oldest person to become president, but also immediately became the oldest president in office at any time (i.e., older than Ronald Reagan on leaving office). In 2021 he effected the final withdrawal from Afghanistan, ending a 20-year intervention whose futility was proved by an immediate Taliban takeover. His support of Israel's genocidal rampage in Gaza from 2023 not just led to a near-wipeout of his previously strong support among Muslim Americans, but also to a steep drop in support among young people; students protested across the country, but their encampments were ultimately shut down by police. This already made his electoral prospects precarious when the 2024 election shaped up to be a rematch of 2020. Then his poor performance in a debate with Trump in June 2024 brought the issue of his age to the centre of discussion and led to increasing calls for his withdrawal from the race. He submitted to the pressure in July.\n\nBidouzo, Barnabé (b. June 11, 1937, Covè, Dahomey [now Benin]), finance minister of Benin (1987-88).\n\nBidwell\n\nBidwell, John (b. Aug. 5, 1819, Chautauqua county, N.Y. - d. April 4, 1900, Chico, Calif.), U.S. politician. Reluctant to join the Bear Flag revolt of Americans in California against Mexico, he nonetheless helped draw up the Bear Flag Republic's resolution of independence in July 1846. He attained the rank of major while participating in the Mexican War; he marched to Monterey (California) with Col. John C. Frémont, served as civil magistrate in Los Angeles, and finally assisted Commodore Robert F. Stockton in the recapture of Los Angeles in 1847. He later served in the California senate in 1849, supervised the census of California in 1850 and again in 1860, and was a delegate to the Democratic Party national convention of 1860. With the advent of the Civil War, Bidwell, a staunch Unionist, became a supporter of Abraham Lincoln. He was appointed brigadier general of the California Militia in 1863 and was a delegate to the Republican national convention of 1864. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1864, he declined renomination in order to run for governor of California on the Republican ticket in 1867; his bid was unsuccessful, as were his two others, one in 1875 on the Anti-Monopoly ticket and another in 1890 as a candidate of the Prohibition Party, which nominated him for president in 1892. He received 2.5% of the vote, the best result ever for a Prohibition Party candidate.\n\nBiebrich Torres, Carlos Armando (b. Nov. 19, 1939, Sahuaripa, Sonora, Mexico - d. Jan. 14, 2021, Hermosillo, Sonora), governor of Sonora (1973-75).\n\nBiedenkopf\n\nBielecki\n\nBiedenkopf, Kurt (Hans) (b. Jan. 28, 1930, Ludwigshafen, Bayern [now in Rheinland-Pfalz], Germany - d.

He has also been ambassador to Chile (2020- ).\n\nBienert\n\nBienert, Richard (b. Sept. 5, 1881, Prague, Austria [now in Czech Republic] - d. Feb. 3, 1949, Prague, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic]), interior minister (1942-45) and prime minister (1945) of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

March 7, 1767, Paris, France), governor of Louisiana (1701-12, 1718-24, 1733-43). Entering the French navy at age 12, he served as midshipman in the last expedition of his noted elder brother, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, into the Hudson Bay region (1697) during King William's War (War of the Grand Alliance). When the conflict with England ended, he accompanied his brother on a colonizing expedition to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A settlement was founded near the area of modern Biloxi in early 1699, and he was made second in command of the colony when his brother departed in the spring. When the colony's leader, Sauvole, died in 1701, Bienville was commissioned as commandant. He transferred the colony to Mobile Bay in 1702 and founded Mobile in 1710. In 1712 he was replaced by Antoine de Lamothe Cadillac, under whom he served as deputy for three years. In 1718, Bienville regained the governor's post. At that time he founded the settlement of New Orleans on the Mississippi River, and four years later he made that city the new capital of the colony. In 1719 he twice captured Pensacola from the Spanish. Fearing insurrections of black slaves, he instituted a \"Code Noir\" regulating their conduct (1724). When the Company of the Indies, which had been financing Louisiana, became unable to continue its support, Bienville's enemies succeeded in having him recalled to France. Upon Louisiana's subsequent decline, however, he was asked to return as governor in 1733. His final term was marked by indecisive expeditions against the Natchez and Chickasaw Indians. He voluntarily resigned the governorship in May 1743 and retired to Paris.\n\nBierlein\n\nBierlein, Brigitte (b. June 25, 1949, Vienna, Austria - d. June 3, 2024), chancellor of Austria (2019-20).

He joined the Polish Communist Party in 1918 and became an underground organizer in Poland as well as in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. Arrested and imprisoned several times in the 1920s and '30s for his activities in Poland, he went to Russia after his release in 1938 and remained there during most of World War II. He returned to Poland at the end of 1943 and with Wladyslaw Gomulka and others formed the Polish National Council. He became provisional head of the Polish republic in 1944, even before the last Germans were driven from the country, and in 1947 was elected to a seven-year term as president. By that time Bierut and his fellow Communists, with the backing of Stalin and the Soviet army, had disposed of all effective opposition, and he began his efforts to Sovietize all aspects of Polish life. Always a loyal follower of party directives from Moscow, he was instrumental in the September 1948 deposition as secretary-general of the Polish Workers' Party of Gomulka, who had attempted to bend the Soviet party line to Polish circumstances. Bierut replaced him and reorganized the party to form the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) in December 1948, becoming chairman of its Central Committee. In 1952, when the president's duties were taken over by a State Council, he became premier, but he resigned that post also in 1954, when he became secretary-general of the PZPR.

During the years of non-Socialist rule in Sweden between 1976 and 1982, he played an important role as a policy coordinator behind the scenes. After two years as adviser at the Finance Ministry, he was elected in 1979 to parliament from Stockholm. He served on various committees including the Defense Committee, before replacing Ulf Adelsohn as Moderate Party leader in August 1986. He owed his rapid advance through the party ranks to a ferocious attack launched on him in 1983 by Prime Minister Olof Palme, who alleged that he was a \"security risk.\" He stood up to Palme's offensive and won the admiration of many conservatives. After the defeat of the Social Democrats in the 1991 election, he became Sweden's youngest prime minister in more than 150 years and the first conservative to lead the country since 1928.

The son of a Saudi construction magnate, he used his millions to buy bulldozers to gouge guerrilla trails in the heart of Afghanistan and to bring in, by his count, thousands of Egyptians, Lebanese, Turks, and others to join their Afghan Muslim brothers in the struggle against the Soviet Union, which invaded Afghanistan to prop up a Communist government in December 1979. After the war, he returned home, but the Saudi government, fearing his brand of militant Islam, expelled him and in April 1994 stripped him of his Saudi citizenship for \"irresponsible behaviour.\" He ventured to Sudan, but because of Western pressure he was forced to leave in mid-1996, returning to Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime gave him shelter. In a series of fatwas (religious edicts) faxed to the outside world from his Afghan hideout, he laid out his case against the U.S.: its soldiers protecting oil in his homeland are desecrating Muslim holy sites with their very presence; its power has emasculated Arab countries, turning them into client states; its friend is Israel. In February 1998, he helped form the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, a coalition that brought together two Egyptian militant groups, two Pakistani groups, and a Bangladeshi group. His network, referred to from August 1998 as al-Qaeda (\"The Base\"), was considered responsible for bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in the latter month and other terrorist acts, and he definitely became the U.S. \"public enemy number one\" after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks which destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City. The U.S. then overthrew the Taliban in Afghanistan but failed to capture Bin Laden, who escaped to Pakistan where he managed to live in hiding for almost ten years. His compound was finally tracked down by the U.S. and he was shot in a carefully-planned raid by a U.S. military team.\n\nBin Momen, Masud (b. Dec. 6, 1963, Dacca, East Pakistan [now Dhaka, Bangladesh]), Bangladeshi diplomat. He was ambassador to Italy (2008-12) and Japan (2012-15) and permanent representative to the United Nations (2015-19).\n\nBin Mubarak\n\nBin Mubarak, Ahmad Awad (b. 1968, Aden, South Yemen [now in Yemen]), foreign minister (2020-24) and prime minister (2024- ) of Yemen (internationally recognized government). He was also ambassador to the United States (2015-20) and permanent representative to the United Nations (2018).\n\nBinabo, Nestor (Kemepadei) (d.

Aug. 5, 2010, Kampala), president of Uganda (1979-80). In October 1959 he founded the Uganda League, one of several parties seeking self-government for the then-British protectorate. His appointment as attorney general followed the April 1962 elections that brought Milton Obote to the premiership and preceded Uganda's independence in October of that year. Binaisa was one of the few prominent Baganda tribal members to oppose the kabaka (king) of Buganda in the latter's resistance to the Obote government, a conflict that ended in the kabaka's defeat in 1966. In 1967 Binaisa broke with Obote over his use of authoritarian tactics and proposals to change the constitution. As a believer in constitutional law Binaisa felt bound to resign from the government. He returned to private legal practice and in 1968 was elected chairman of the Law Development Centre and president of the Uganda Law Society. In 1970 he became a member of the Uganda Judicial Service Commission and two years later was made chairman of the organizing committee of the Commonwealth Lawyers' Conference. Unlike many of Obote's critics, Binaisa was not among those who welcomed Idi Amin's coup in 1971. He was forced into exile and began a law practice in New York City, which he used as a base to campaign against Amin's rule. After the overthrow of General Amin in April 1979, Uganda needed an experienced and impartial leader capable of firmly reestablishing law and order and of binding up the tribal and religious wounds inflicted during years of tyrannical rule. When the first man chosen to take Amin's place as president, Yusufu Lule, proved unequal to this difficult task, he was replaced in June by Binaisa. He returned to Uganda on April 13, 2001, after more than 10 years of self-imposed exile in the United States.\n\nBindzi (Amougou), Benoît (b. 1924, Ekok, French Cameroons [now in Cameroon] - d.

June 28, 1999, St. John's), prime minister (1981-94), finance minister (1982-84, 1991), and foreign minister (1991) of Antigua and Barbuda. He was a founding member of the Antigua Trades and Labour Union and rose rapidly to become its president (1943-69). In 1945 he ran for the Legislative Council and was easily elected. A defining moment in the history of Antigua and Barbuda is a legendary - some say apocryphal - speech by Bird under a tamarind tree near the village of Bethesda in January 1951. Bird threatened a strike if sugarcane workers were not given a raise. When Alexander Moody-Stuart, the powerful head of the Antigua Sugar Estates, scoffed and asked what the striking workers would eat, Bird replied: \"We will eat cockles and the widdy widdy bush. We will drink pond water.\" The widdy widdy bush is a common weed in Antigua that was part of the diet of slaves. Bird's reply became a permanent part of the lexicon of political oratory in Antigua. Bird did organize the strike and there was no sugar harvest that year. Through encouraging union members to run for public office, he formed the basis for what became the Antigua Labour Party. When universal adult suffrage was introduced in 1951, the union won every seat in the legislature, a feat it repeated until 1967. In 1960 he became the island's first chief minister, retaining office, with the title of premier, when the island achieved associated statehood in 1967. A split within labour lost him his seat in elections in 1971. However, in 1976 he was returned to power and he led the final constitutional negotiations in London in 1980 that brought the two-island state to independence (Nov. 1, 1981). The dominant figure in Antiguan politics for more than 50 years, Bird retired in 1994. He was knighted in 1999.\n\nBird, Wallace Samuel (b. Dec. 7, 1917, Marysville, N.B. - d.

He traveled extensively around the world before acceding to the throne on his father's death on Jan. 31, 1972; he was crowned on Feb. 24, 1975. Birendra continued the autocratic tradition of his father, who had dissolved the elected parliament in 1960 and banned political parties in the constitution of 1962; indeed, for a time, Birendra was one of the world's few remaining absolute monarchs. He managed to defend Nepal's independence against encroaching influences by India, China, and the Soviet Union. During his reign Nepal was opened up to extensive tourism. In 1990 a popular pro-democracy movement erupted into bloody riots between police and demonstrators. On April 8 Birendra acceded to the opposition's demand to lift the ban on political parties, and on November 9 he promulgated a new constitution that preserved his status as chief of state but confirmed multiparty democracy, a separation of powers, and the protection of human rights. In 1996 Maoist rebels launched an armed insurgency aimed at replacing the monarchy; they succeeded in gaining control over large areas of the countryside. On May 2, 1969, he married Aishwarya (b. Nov. 7, 1949, Lazimpat, Kathmandu). They had two sons, Dipendra (b. June 27, 1971) and Nirajan (b. Nov. 6, 1978), and one daughter, Shruti (b. Oct. 16, 1976).

He won election to the Kentucky legislature in 1816, and in 1818 he moved to Alabama, where he was elected to the legislature in the following year. There he helped incorporate into the state constitution provisions that empowered the legislature to emancipate slaves and to prohibit selling slaves brought into the state. He was also repeatedly elected mayor of Huntsville and for several years was the confidential adviser and counsel of the Cherokee nation. At first an advocate of gradual emancipation, in 1834 he publicly endorsed immediate emancipation and freed his six slaves. In 1836 he established an anti-slavery newspaper, the Philanthropist.

On the night of Nov. 18, 1973, he and his companions were severely beaten by members of the Mongoose Gang (the notorious parapolice aids of the regime of Sir Eric Gairy) in full view of the police and held without medical attention in appalling conditions. Two months later his father, Rupert Bishop, was killed. From that point on, he swore to bring down Gairy's administration. This was attempted through a coalition of the Movement for Assemblies of the People and the New Jewel Movement (Jewel being an acronym for Joint Endeavour for Welfare, Education, and Liberation). In 1976 he was elected to parliament, and Gairy's majority was reduced from 13 seats to 3. As a result of suspicions that Gairy had decided to move against New Jewel, a successful coup was mounted early in the morning of March 13, 1979. Bishop emerged as leader and, subsequently, prime minister. Though New Jewel embraced broad Marxist-Leninist beliefs, its policy was much in line with pragmatic Caribbean interpretations. His more moderate stance was felt to have enraged his deputy prime minister Bernard Coard, who toppled Bishop in a power struggle in October 1983, though the army quickly took control and Coard disappeared. Bishop was being held under an army-imposed house arrest when throngs of his supporters pushed past the guards and carried him outdoors, after which they proceeded to Market Square and then to Ft. Rupert, a Grenadian Army compound. Eyewitness reports revealed that army troops opened fire on the crowd and forced Bishop and his cabinet ministers inside the fort where they were executed.\n\nBishop, Richard M(oore) (b. March 4, 1812, Fleming county, Ky. - d. March 2, 1893, Jacksonville, Fla.), governor of Ohio (1878-80).\n\nBishti, Ahmad (b. Aug. 8, 1927), foreign minister of Libya (1965-68). He was also health minister (1963-64) and ambassador to Lebanon (1964-65) and Turkey (1968-69).\n\nBislip, Pedro (b. Nov. 1, 1937 - d. June 18, 2007), administrator of Aruba (1983-85).\n\nH. von Bismarck\n\nBismarck, (Nikolaus Heinrich Ferdinand) Herbert Fürst von (b. Dec. 28, 1849, Berlin, Prussia [Germany] - d. Sept. 18, 1904, Friedrichsruh, Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia, Germany), foreign minister of Germany (1885-90); son of Otto Fürst von Bismarck. He was also minister to the Netherlands (1884-85). Previously Graf von Bismarck-Schönhausen, he succeeded as Fürst von Bismarck in 1898.\n\nO. von Bismarck\n\nBismarck, Otto (Eduard Leopold) (from March 21, 1871, Fürst) von, (from Sept. 15, 1865) Graf von Bismarck-Schönhausen, (from March 1890) Herzog von Lauenburg (b. April 1, 1815, Schönhausen, Prussia [now in Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany] - d. July 30, 1898, Friedrichsruh, Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia, Germany), chancellor of Germany (1871-90). In 1849 he was elected to the Prussian Chamber of Deputies (the lower chamber of the Prussian Diet). In 1851 he was chosen to represent Prussia in the federal Diet in Frankfurt. In 1859 he was sent to Russia as Prussian ambassador, and not long thereafter (May 1862) he moved to Paris as ambassador to the court of Napoléon III. He became prime minister and foreign minister of Prussia in September 1862. He involved his country in the Franco-German War (1870-71), a conflict that ended with Prussian success and a measure of German unity. In January 1871 the four southern German states joined the North German Confederation to create the German Empire. Having already served as federal chancellor of the North German Confederation from 1867, Bismarck became imperial chancellor under the constitution of April 16, 1871. He also remained prime minister of Prussia until 1890, except for a period in 1873. He actively and skillfully pursued pacific policies in foreign affairs, succeeding in preserving the peace in Europe for about two decades. He banned the Social Democratic Party in 1878. He also introduced social legislation to woo the workers away from political radicalism. But his two-pronged strategy did not succeed. Support for the Social Democrats increased with each election. The 1890 election was a disaster for Bismarck. The parties that he had termed enemies of the empire gained more than half of the seats in the new Reichstag. The new emperor Wilhelm II did not want to begin his reign with a bloodbath or a coup d'état by the state. On March 18, 1890, Bismarck was forced to resign.\n\nBismarck-Bohlen, Friedrich (Theodor Alexander) Graf von (b. June 25, 1818, Karlsburg, Prussia [now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany] - d.

July 21, 1980, Paris, France), foreign minister (1956-58, 1963, 1966) and prime minister (1963, 1964, 1966) of Syria. Bitar, who founded (with Michel Aflaq) the Ba`th Party, later criticized the policies of both wings of the party as editor in chief of the journal Al Ahaa al-Arabi (\"Arab Renaissance\"); in 1966 he clashed with younger members of the party who felt he was too conservative. Bitar was forced into exile after being ousted as premier. Earlier he served as minister of state when Egypt and Syria were temporarily merged to form the United Arab Republic. During the last ten years of his life, Bitar lived in exile in Paris where he reportedly associated with other exiles. He was assassinated outside the building where he edited his magazine. The Syrian government denied reports that he was \"marked for murder\" because of his opposition to Pres. Hafez al-Assad.\n\nBitarov, Aleksandr (Semyonovich) (b. Oct. 7, 1957, Tbilisi, Georgian S.S.R.), chairman of the government of Irkutsk oblast (2015-17).\n\nV. Bitarov\n\nBitarov, Vyacheslav (Zelimkhanovich) (b.

Jan. 9, 1984, Athens), foreign minister of Greece (1974-77). A career diplomat from 1939, Bitsios headed departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was a delegate (1956-61) and permanent representative (1961-65 and 1967-72) to the UN. In 1966 he acted as political adviser to King Konstantinos. He became foreign minister in 1974 in the government headed by Konstantinos Karamanlis that followed the fall of the military dictatorship and the restoration of democracy that year. In this position, he negotiated with U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger on the establishment of a U.S.-Greek defense agreement, but this was not signed.\n\nBittel (Van Strad), Deolindo Felipe (b. June 10, 1922, Villa Ángela, Chaco, Argentina - d. Sept. 22, 1997, Resistencia, Chaco), governor of Chaco (1963-66, 1973-76).

Oct. 12, 1965, Popokabaka, Kwango, Congo [Léopoldville (now Kinshasa)]), governor of Kwango (2024- ).\n\nBiya\n\nBiya, Paul, original name Paul Barthélemy Biya'a bi Mvondo (b. Feb. 13, 1933, Mvomeka'a village, near Sangmelima, South province, French Cameroons), president of Cameroon (1982- ). In 1962, he became head of the Department of Development Aid for a year before becoming director of the cabinet of the Ministry of National Education, Youth, and Culture. In 1967 he was appointed director of the cabinet of Pres. Ahmadou Ahidjo and the following year was named minister of state and secretary-general of the presidency. When the post of prime minister was created in July 1975, Biya was appointed to it and remained in that office until he became president following Ahidjo's voluntary retirement on Nov. 6, 1982. He was thus one of Ahidjo's closest collaborators during a period of 15 years. On Sept. 14, 1983, Biya also succeeded Ahidjo as chairman of the republic's sole political party, the Cameroonian National Union (CNU). The seemingly smooth transfer of power was disrupted when Ahidjo, while still CNU president, realized that he would not be able to retain effective control as the \"power behind the throne,\" as he had apparently intended. Biya was clearly his own man, with his own ideas on how the country should be run, and his election as CNU president enabled him to plan for a more democratic political system. Considered to be tolerant and moderate in his outlook, Biya nevertheless possessed determination, as was shown during the brief crisis in his relations with his predecessor in the summer of 1983. He also had a reputation for integrity and a capacity for hard work. Most popular in the south of the country, where his roots were, he was nonetheless respected in the north, where support for Ahidjo had been strongest. He was reelected in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1997, 2004, 2011, and 2018. He was OAU chairman in 1996-97.\n\nBiyama, Roy (b. Aug. 23, 1967 - d. Sept. 11, 2021), governor of Western province (2017).

April 18, 1953, Donguila, Gabon), prime minister of Gabon (2009-12). He was also minister of trade, consumption, and the transfer of technology (1989-90), state control, parastatal reform, and privatization (1992-94), small and medium-sized enterprises, small and medium-sized industries, and the craft industry (1999-2003), trade and industrial development (2003-08), agriculture, animal husbandry, and rural development (2008-09), health, social welfare, family, and national solidarity (2015-16), social and family development, social welfare, and national solidarity (2016-17), and social protection, family, and national solidarity (2017-18) and first deputy prime minister (2015-16).\n\nBiyogho, Jacques, Gabonese diplomat. He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1966-67).\n\nBiyogo Nsue, Teodoro (b. Jan. 12, 1956, Angong-Obuc, Mongomo, Spanish Guinea [now Equatorial Guinea]), Equatorial Guinean diplomat.

Nov. 25, 1941, Yalanets, Vinnitsa [Vinnytsya] oblast, Ukrainian S.S.R.), acting defense minister of Ukraine (1993).\n\nBizimana, Jean-Damascène (b. 1963, Cyanika sector, Nyamagabe district, Rwanda), Rwandan politician. He has been permanent representative to the United Nations (1992-94) and minister of national unity and civic engagement (2021- ).\n\nBizimungu, Casimir (b. March 4, 1951, Nyamugari, Rwanda), foreign minister of Rwanda (1989-92). He was also minister of public health and social affairs (1987-89). He was transferred to the UN tribunal in Arusha on Feb. 23, 1999, being accused of genocide.\n\nP. Bizimungu\n\nBizimungu, Pasteur (b. April 1950, Gisenyi prefecture, Rwanda), president of Rwanda (1994-2000). An ethnic Hutu himself, in 1990 he denounced the nepotism and ethnic discrimination of the Hutu-dominated regime of Pres. Juvénal Habyarimana, and he helped convince leaders of the exile group Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) that his grip on power was tenuous. That same year the RPF began the first of a long series of protracted guerrilla attacks against government forces. When the death of Habyarimana in a plane crash in 1994 was blamed on the Tutsi-led RPF, Hutu forces unleashed a genocide against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. After three months the RPF managed to defeat the government forces. It installed a mixed Hutu-Tutsi government and Bizimungu was appointed president. He resigned in 2000 after a series of disagreements with Vice Pres. Paul Kagame, who then succeeded him as president. Analysts counted Bizimungu as the eighth Hutu to resign from an important post citing the impunity of a powerful Tutsi clique and unfair reprisals and corruption witch hunts against prominent Hutus. He was imprisoned from April 19, 2002, for \"attacking the safety of the state.\" This accusation emerged after he announced the formation of a new political party which, according to the government, wanted to preach ethnic division. He was sentenced on June 7, 2004, to 15 years' imprisonment for attempting to form a militia group, inciting violence, and embezzlement; he denied the charges. He was released from prison on April 6, 2007, after receiving a pardon from Kagame.\n\nBizjak, Ivan (b. Jan. 6, 1956, Kranj, Slovenia - d. May 6, 2023, Zgornja Bela, Slovenia), interior minister (1993-94) and justice minister (2000-04) of Slovenia.\n\nBjarnason, Björn (b. Nov. 14, 1944, Reykjavík, Iceland), justice and church minister of Iceland (2003-09); son of Bjarni Benediktsson (1908-1970). He was also minister of education (1995-2002).\n\nBjegovic, Djordje (b. Aug. 9, 1941, Sibenik, Italian-occupied Dalmatia [now in Croatia]), prime minister of Krajina (1993-94).\n\nBjelke-Petersen\n\nBjelke-Petersen, Sir Johannes, byname Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen (b. Jan. 13, 1911, Dannevirke, N.Z. - d. April 23, 2005, Kingaroy, Qld.), premier of Queensland (1968-87). In 1946 he was elected to the Kingaroy Shire Council for the Country Party (later renamed National Party) and three years later entered state parliament. In 1963 he moved into state cabinet as works and housing minister, a post he held until he came from obscurity to become premier in 1968 after the sudden death of Premier Jack Pizzey. Within a few years he made his presence felt. The southern press loved to lampoon him as a bible-thumping, anti-union, right-wing peanut farmer, ready to lend his name to a wide variety of mad schemes. Never one to take any notice of the doctrines of ministerial responsibility or separation of powers, he managed to disarm journalists and critics alike with his homespun mantra of \"don't you worry about that.\" But he was also a Machiavellian politician which his rivals on both sides of politics would underestimate at their own peril. In 1975 he helped topple Gough Whitlam's Labor government by breaking convention to nominate the Whitlam-hating Albert Patrick Field to fill a casual Labor vacancy in the Senate; this gave the opposition the numbers to block supply and led to the eventual election of Malcolm Fraser. After his second state election win, he was ready to face a decade of protests, led by militant unionists and left-wing university students. At one of the largest protests, in October 1977, a total of 662 people were arrested. He was knighted in 1984. After an unsuccessful campaign for prime minister, which ultimately benefited the Labor Party, and escalating claims of official corruption and wrongdoing he resigned in 1987.\n\nBjerregaard, Ritt (Jytte) (b. May 19, 1941, Copenhagen, Denmark - d. Jan. 21, 2023, Copenhagen), Danish politician. She was minister of education (1973, 1975-78), social affairs (1979-81), and food, agriculture, and fisheries (2000-01), European commissioner for environment (1995-99), and lord mayor of Copenhagen (2006-09).\n\nBjerve, Petter Jakob (b.

Jan. 25, 1952, Reykjavík), president of Iceland (1944-52); son of Björn Jónsson. He became a member of the Reykjavík town council in 1912, was its president in 1918-20, and was a member of the Althing (parliament) in 1914-16 and 1920. In 1914 he was special envoy to the United States, where he obtained for his country medicines, grain, and other goods that could not be imported from Europe because of the German and British blockades in World War I. A year later, as special envoy to London, he arranged the first British-Icelandic trade agreement. He served as minister to Denmark (1920-24, 1926-41) and attended several international conferences. Although Iceland had been independent since 1918, its foreign affairs were conducted by Denmark until the beginning of World War II. Following the German occupation of Denmark in May 1940, Björnsson was elected to three one-year terms as regent beginning in June 1941, assuming all the prerogatives in Icelandic affairs previously held by the Danish king. In July 1941, U.S. troops entered Iceland on the invitation of Björnsson's government and remained, in reduced numbers, after the war; their continued presence was the leading controversy in the nation's postwar foreign policy. In 1944 the republic was proclaimed and he was chosen by parliament to serve the first term as president. In 1945 and 1949 he was reelected unopposed as no other candidate stood. Björnsson declared Bessastadir the official presidential residence and set the precedent for presidential protocol and tradition which have been broadly continued by his successors, although each new incumbent of the nation's highest office has inevitably added an element of personal style. He died in office.\n\nBjörnstjerna, Johan Magnus (b. Jan. 28, 1805, Arby socken [now part of Kalmar municipality], Kalmar, Sweden - d.

Jan. 7, 1873, Atlanta, Ga. - d. Dec. 19, 1934, Atlanta), governor of the Federal Reserve System (1933-34).\n\nBlack, Eugene R(obert) (b. May 1, 1898, Atlanta, Ga. - d. Feb. 20, 1992, Southampton, N.Y.), president of the World Bank (1949-63); son of Eugene R. Black (1873-1934).\n\nBlack, Frank S(wett) (b. March 8, 1853, Limington, Maine - d. March 22, 1913, New York City), governor of New York (1897-99).\n\nG. Black\n\nBlack, George (b. April 10, 1873, Woodstock, N.B. - d. Aug. 23, 1965, Vancouver, B.C.), commissioner of the Yukon Territory (1912-16). In 1905, he was elected to the Yukon Council. Reelected twice, he served in that position until Feb. 1, 1912, when he was appointed commissioner of the Yukon. In both positions, he fought graft in the public service, greatly extended the road system, and brought in legislation to protect workers, in particular the Miners' and Woodsmen's Lien Ordinances. George and his wife Martha were both extremely popular, and they always remained close to the \"common man\" - miners were always welcome in their home, and that remained their policy at Government House, despite counsel to the contrary which they often received. In 1916, George resigned as commissioner in order to join the war effort. He enlisted 275 men and formed the Yukon Infantry Company (later the 17th Canadian Machine Gun Company). At the Battle of Amiens, George was severely wounded, but he was able to return to the Yukon at the war's end. In 1921, George was elected as the member of parliament for the Yukon. He retained the seat until 1935, when he was forced to resign due to ill health. Martha then ran in his place, and at the age of 69, she became only the second woman ever to be elected to Canada's parliament (the first had been Agnes McPhail) - the honour was made even more significant by the fact that she had won as a Conservative member in a Liberal landslide. However, Martha was a woman of her times - entries from Martha's diary make it clear that Martha considered George to be a better MP than her, and her duty was to hold the seat until George was physically able to take over again. In 1940 George did regain the seat, remaining until 1949.\n\nBlack, George A(dolph) (b. 1841 - d. Nov. 27, 1914, Tacoma, Wash.), acting governor of Utah (1871).\n\nBlack, James D(ixon) (b. Sept. 24, 1849, Knox county, Ky. - d. Aug. 4, 1938, Barbourville, Ky.), governor of Kentucky (1919).\n\nBlack, Jeremiah S(ullivan) (b. Jan. 10, 1810, near Stony Creek, Pa. - d.

Black served in the administration of Britain's colonies for more than three decades. He spent several years in a Japanese prison camp during World War II. Returning to the colonial service in 1946, he served in North Borneo and Hong Kong before moving on to Singapore as governor (1955-57). Subsequently, he was governor of Hong Kong from 1958 to 1964. He saw the colony prosper during that period, even though hundreds of thousands of refugees were crossing the border from mainland China. Thousands of the refugees settled there illegally, and Black repeatedly appealed to London for help in housing them. Black was chancellor of both the English- and Chinese-speaking universities. He was made K.C.M.G. in 1955 and G.C.M.G. in 1962.\n\nBlack, Samuel (baptized May 3, 1780 - d.

April 23, 1928, Santa Monica, Calif. - d. Feb. 10, 2014, Woodside, Calif.), U.S. diplomat. A famous child actress, she was ambassador to Ghana (1974-76) and Czechoslovakia (1989-92).\n\nBlackall, Samuel Wensley (b. May 1, 1809, Dublin, Ireland - d.

He was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1875-85) and Senate (1885-97).\n\nBlackburn, Luke P(ryor) (b. June 16, 1816, Woodford county, Ky. - d. Sept. 14, 1887, Frankfort, Ky.), governor of Kentucky (1879-83).\n\nBlackburn Cortés, José (b. 1948? - d. Sept. 16, 2020), Colombian politician. He was president of the Senate (1992-93).\n\nBlackburne, Sir Kenneth (William) (b. Dec. 12, 1907, Bristol, England - d. Nov. 4, 1980, Douglas, Isle of Man), governor-general of Jamaica (1962). He joined the Colonial Service in 1930 and served in Nigeria, Palestine, and The Gambia before his appointment in 1943 as administrative secretary to the comptroller for development and welfare in the West Indies. As director of information services (1947-50) at the Colonial Office in London, he was particularly concerned with improving understanding in Britain of the peoples of the colonial territories. Blackburne was knighted in 1952. He was governor of the Leeward Islands (1950-56) before succeeding Sir Hugh Foot in Jamaica. He was captain general and governor in chief (1957-62) and became governor-general when Jamaica became independent. At a crucial time in Jamaica's history, both because of local political issues and because of the increasing Jamaican immigration to the U.K., Blackburne brought to his task a wide experience of colonial administration and a specialized knowledge of the Caribbean.\n\nBlacker Miller, (Manuel) Augusto (b. Oct. 18, 1945, Lima, Peru), foreign minister of Peru (1991-92). He was declared in contempt of court in October 2005 for failing to appear at a trial of former cabinet members involved in Pres.

Nov. 21, 1878, Spartanburg county, S.C. - d. Feb. 12, 1936, Spartanburg, S.C.), governor of South Carolina (1931-35).\n\nBlades (y Bellido de Luna), Rubén (Darío) (b. July 16, 1948, Panama City, Panama), Panamanian politician. In the early 1970s, he and his family were sent into exile when his father (a former member of the secret police) ran afoul of Manuel Noriega, then head of military intelligence. He became a salsa singer, composer, and Hollywood actor. In May 1994, Blades returned to Panama to run for the presidency. As the populist candidate of Papa Egoró (Mother Earth), the party that he had formed during a brief return to Panama in 1991, Blades campaigned with songs and guitar, attracting support from those disillusioned with corrupt politicians. His campaign, however, was underfinanced, and although Blades proved a popular candidate, some thought that his extended absence from the country had left him out of touch. In the May 8 elections, he placed third, winning only 17% of the vote. In 2004-09 he was minister of tourism.\n\nBlaga, Vasile (b. July 26, 1956, Petrileni, Bihor county, Romania), interior minister of Romania (2004-07, 2009-10). He was also minister of regional development and housing (2008-09) and president of the Senate (2011-12).\n\nBlagojevich, Rod (R.1) (b. Dec. 10, 1956, Chicago, Ill.), governor of Illinois (2003-09). In December 2008 he was arrested on corruption charges. It was alleged, among other things, that he conspired to benefit financially from his role in appointing a U.S. senator to fill the vacancy left by Barack Obama's election as president. In January 2009 the Illinois Senate convicted him on a sprawling article of impeachment that charged him with abusing his power; Blagojevich, who pleaded his innocence, was thus immediately ousted, and the Senate also voted to ban him from ever again holding office in the state. In December 2011 he was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Pres. Donald Trump commuted his sentence in 2020.\n\n1 He does not have a middle name, but uses the initial R. as a tribute to his late father, Radisa.\n\nBlagué, Alphonse (b. 1948, Bangui, Oubangui-Chari [now Central African Republic]), Central African Republic politician.

He was permanent representative to the United Nations (1982-84), ambassador/high commissioner to the United Kingdom (2017-21), and ambassador to the Vatican (2018-21).\n\nJ.G. Blaine\n\nBlaine, James G(illespie) (b. Jan. 31, 1830, West Brownsville, Pa. - d. Jan. 27, 1893, Washington, D.C.), U.S. politician. He was a delegate to the first national convention of the new Republican Party in 1856. In 1858 he was elected to the Maine legislature and in 1862 to the U.S. House of Representatives. A leader in the formation of the Republican Party in Maine, he was state chairman from 1859 to 1881. After the Civil War, he favoured a moderate Reconstruction policy but was a strong advocate of Negro suffrage. In 1869-75 he was speaker of the House, where his eloquence and leadership won him a devoted following. He led the \"Half-Breed\" faction of the Republicans in a feud with the \"Stalwart\" faction of Roscoe Conkling, and the opposition of the Stalwarts helped to deny him presidential nominations in 1876 and 1880. In 1876 he failed to reply convincingly to a corruption charge and lost to Rutherford B. Hayes. Immediately after the convention he was appointed to the Senate to fill a vacancy, and he soon won election to a full term. After the election of James A. Garfield in 1880, he resigned his Senate seat to become secretary of state. In this office he was particularly energetic in fostering closer relations with the Latin American nations. Soon after the assassination of Garfield (1881) Blaine resigned. He finally was nominated for the presidency in 1884, only to lose by a narrow margin to the Democratic candidate, Grover Cleveland. In 1888 Blaine unexpectedly declined to run for president, supporting Benjamin Harrison, who, upon becoming president, made him secretary of state again. He assumed the chairmanship of the first Pan-American Conference, but his proposals for a customs union and arbitration system were defeated. He resigned in June 1892.\n\nBlaine, John J(ames) (b. May 4, 1875, Wingville, Wis. - d. April 16, 1934, Boscobel, Wis.), governor of Wisconsin (1921-27).\n\nBlair, Austin (b. Feb. 8, 1818, Caroline, N.Y. - d.

Blair\n\nBlair, Sir Tony, byname of Sir Anthony Charles Lynton Blair (b. May 6, 1953, Edinburgh, Scotland), British prime minister (1997-2007). He entered the House of Commons in 1983 for the safe Labour constituency of Sedgefield in Durham. Pro-European unity and pro-NATO, he was one of the keenest supporters of Neil Kinnock, who, as party leader in 1983-92, sought to modernize Labour. Labour MPs elected him to their shadow cabinet in 1988 at the unusually young age of 35. After Labour's defeat in the April 1992 general election, Blair became the most outspoken of the \"modernizers.\" In July 1992 John Smith was elected Labour leader and appointed Blair as shadow home secretary. Blair's task was to jettison Labour's reputation for being \"soft\" on criminals. He argued that the right approach was to be \"tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.\" Smith died in May 1994, and Blair succeeded him as party leader in July. About two months later he told Labour's annual conference that he wished to rewrite the party's constitution and abandon its commitment to \"the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.\" At a special conference in April 1995, he secured agreement to a new set of party objectives that acknowledged the virtues of market competition. He led \"New Labour\" to a landslide victory in the general election of May 1997 and became the U.K.'s youngest prime minister in 185 years. He started a process of constitutional change, including devolu"
