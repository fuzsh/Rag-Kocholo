        "text": "A Foundational Report of Findings and Observations from an Exploratory Assessment of the History and Evolution of the Concept of Leadership with Reference to the Development of an African Leadership Approach\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is customary for scholars and researchers of universal or contentious concepts to announce their contributions to the debate about aspects of such concepts or themes with a litany of apologies and qualified excuses why they opted to approach the topic of their investigation the way they did. After agonising about the prospects of offending professional archaeologists through his amateurish report about the Mapungubwe archaeological project, Gardiner (1) came to the conclusion that 'excuses are usually futile and denote incompetency or worse�but I trust that this brief account of some of our difficulties will render our critics more lenient towards us. They may rest assured that no important fact was overlooked and that no negligent or scrappy excavation was undertaken�That this book is full of deficiencies nobody knows better than the author�I have given the facts as they appeared�and the conclusions are my own, interpreted from the facts. Everybody's interpretation may not agree with mine; but one has to offer a hypothesis that will embrace and include all the known phenomena, both cultural and anthropological, for the one cannot be divorced from the other'.\n\nWhile anticipating negative Jewish reactions to his book on the Arab-Israeli conflict, Alfred M. Lilienthal (2) prefaced his work thus: \"while I have no illusions as to the storm that would descend on me for writing so frankly on so sensitive a subject, it was my hope that the gravity of the problems I discussed and their profound consequences for the United States and the free world, and for Jewry and Judaism, would win from readers a minimum of group emotionalism and maximum of individual thought.\n\nWhile he was about to launch a book which resulted in his leadership being likened to that of the 'king' or 'messiah' of modern Israel, Theodor Herzl (3) chose to defend his book thus: \"I wish it to be clearly understood from the outset that no portion of my argument is based on a new discovery. I have discovered neither the historic condition of the Jews nor the means to improve it. In fact every man will see for himself that the materials of the structure I am designing are not only in existence, but actually ready to hand�I must, in the first place, guard my scheme from being treated as Utopian by superficial critics who might commit this error of judgment if I did not warn them. I should obviously have done nothing to be ashamed of if I had described a Utopia on philanthropic lines; and I should also, in all probability, have obtained literary success more easily if I had set forth my plan in the irresponsible guise of a romantic tale. But this Utopia is far less attractive than any one of those portrayed by Sir Thomas More and his numerous forerunners and successors. And I believe the situation of the Jews in many countries is grave enough to make preliminary trifling superfluous\".\n\nTo begin with, we must invoke established clichés that warn readers that they are about to embark on an intellectual journey into well-known but little understood territory. It is in place to state that the ideas and ideals surrounding the concept of leadership are as many and as different as there are people willing to define them. The central of leadership is one of the most observed and least understood traditions of human society. Man's fascination with the qualities and deeds of effective leaders has nourished an undying quest to discover both the shorthand and the shortcut to leadership. Not a science but more of an ancient art form, the study reveals that mentions of leadership will be found not only in Plato, Caesar, and Plutarch but also in biblical texts e.g. the Pentateuch or the first five books of Moses.\n\nThe Chinese classics are filled with hortatory advice to the country's leaders. The ancient Egyptians attributed three qualities of divinity to their king: authoritative utterances, perception, and justice. (4) They also demanded that their leaders possess all the ingredients of the first unknown quality ('x-factor') of effective leadership, namely, authority, discrimination, and just behaviour. The Greeks, on the other hand, believed the important ingredients of leadership include justice and judgment, wisdom and counsel, shrewdness and cunning, and valour and action. And the British, according to Shakespeare, believed the combination code of leadership comprised 'king-becoming graces' such as justice, verity, temperance, stableness, bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, devotion, patience, courage, and fortitude. (18)\n\nOne of the most important findings to emerge from the interim study on the leadership approaches, practices and experiences of five different ethnic or societal groups � western, Indian, Jewish, Afrikaner and African � is that contrary to what racially prejudiced historians and other classes of social commentators have preached over centuries, African society possesses a highly dynamic history. Granted that it has suffered and continues to suffer immensely from lack of mastery of science and technology, African society had � until it was disrupted by the combined scourge of slavery, colonialism, racism and exploitation � a highly effective leadership system which was backed by traditional customs, philosophies, rituals and taboos. Africa's leadership problems started when western explorers, travellers or settlers sought to interpret its societal institutions and leadership systems according to the mindsets and value-judgements already etched in the minds of foreign explorers, travellers or settlers.\n\nContemporary historians have often referred to the fact that foreign travellers and explorers went about looking for African equivalents of western rulers i.e. kings, queens, captains and so forth. Where no such equivalents existed, the indigenous people were dismissed as inconsequential and backward. Conversely, where African leaders of formidable power, clout and resources were encountered � as in the citadel of the Zimbabwe � the foreign travellers paid similar respect as they did their own rulers back in Europe or wherever. Unfortunately, highly developed empires of the calibre of Mapungubwe, Zimbabwe and several mentioned in the works of Davidson (8), (11), (27); Cheik Anta Diop (28); Ken Mufuka (30), and Eric R Wolf (29), were literally and figuratively too far and few between. As the review of the birth, growth and demise of Afrikaner leadership has revealed, the Khoisan's lack of elaborate leadership or kingship institutions contributed, in large measure, to their ruthless exploitation by both burgers and boers. Yet, the Bantu groups were saved from similar harsh treatment by the protection offered them by relatively strong traditional leadership systems � although these were eventually conquered by a combination of British and Boer military might.\n\nResearch has established that leadership occurs universally among all people regardless of culture. Bass (4) notes that the earliest literature on leadership was concerned almost entirely with theoretical issues. Theorists sought to identify different types of leadership and to relate them to the functional demands of society. In addition, they sought to account for the emergence of leadership either by examining the qualities of the leader or the elements of the situation. Earlier theorists can be differentiated from more recent ones primarily by virtue of the fact that they failed to consider the interaction between individual and situational variables; and they tended to develop more comprehensive theories than do their more recent counterparts. The failure of recent researchers to investigate certain areas of the leadership problem can be attributed in part to their empirical as opposed to their theoretical orientation. Whereas theorists may attempt to comprehend a problem in its entirety, empiricists tend to concern themselves with those aspects of the problem that are perceived as researchable in terms of availability of samples and measurability of variables. But theory and research combine to yield insight into a problem.\n\nThe current study on the identification of suitable and relevant ingredients for the development of an African Leadership Model has been motivated by a widely shared belief among contemporary black leaders that it is time for Africa to produce leaders with the requisite capacity for high performance and moral impact to ensure that the people of the continent secure their fair share of opportunities in the twenty-first century. For decades black leaders have watched leaders of rival communities transform and record achievements that relieved their communities of under-dog status and all the complexes that undermine capacity for high performance. While they did not sit on their hands, blacks found out that whatever actions they took to ameliorate their predicament, their actions were never enough to keep pace with the progress of rival communities.\n\nThe case is illustrated by the relative progress made by Jewish, Indian and Portuguese communities whose first generation immigrants started life in South Africa as poor and unsophisticated working class labourers. Beside the protection and privileges that came with the awarding of a 'white' status especially to Jews and Portuguese in this example, black South Africans find themselves at a loss to explain why these erstwhile underdog communities streaked ahead while the indigenous people remained mired in ignorance, poverty and helplessness. Thus began the search for the first unknown factor or factors behind the successes and achievements of South Africa's ethnic groups.\n\nSince the days of colonial and apartheid rule, black South Africans have cursed their gods for not endowing them with the factor or factors that determine which, how and why particular individuals are blessed with an abundance of 'king-making' virtues and the attributes of high performance and effectiveness. Simultaneously, humankind also wants to understand the circumstances, which condemn the many among us who have the blessing of Sisyphus* i.e. to work very hard and diligently without much to show for it. Research has to date failed to reveal the 'x-factor' that lies hidden in the Pandora's box of our communities. This failure has largely been responsible for many flawed scientific and quasi-scientific or 'flavour of the decade' leadership theories that sought to quench our burning thirst for leadership knowledge and wisdom. Each year, institutions spend or make fortunes over these failed leadership theories or so-called breakthroughs in leadership knowledge or development.\n\nAs in many areas of human endeavour, whenever everything else fails, the last resort is basic personal instinct or our rich store of superstition. Throughout history, man has always relied on his superstition capital to explain extraordinary occurrences. Such explanations cannot fail because they are attributed and justified on the basis of divine intervention. Even here, at the level of divine or supernatural intervention, the problem has always been: how and why certain individuals have reaped disproportionately more benefits while others' rewards have been dismal in spite of the fact that they all relied on the aid of the supernatural? To illustrate with more familiar contemporary example: the issue is why one shopkeeper is able to attract more and profitable custom while another failed dismally to generate enough traffic from the same community with identical merchandise and service � regardless of supernatural aid.\n\nIt is this failure of the rich and famous to explain how they made their fortunes that sets our tongues wagging. We become suspicious and even resentful when the recipes offered by our high performers fail to advance us one bit. For this reason, society has over the years had mixed feelings towards high achievers who fail to give convincing accounts of how they got it right. Many a reputation, property or life has been lost largely because the community's serial high performers eclipse us ordinary mortals with superior business or trading outputs, artistic products or productions, livestock or produce from their fields. In practice our ambivalence makes us switch from admiration to envy, jealousy, the ejection of the offending high performer from the community of under-achievers and lacklustre leadership. By the same token high performing members of the community were also blamed for natural disasters that befell the communities in which they lived. As the expression goes, the effective individuals discovered to their sorrow that the journey 'from hero to zero' depended on the speed of rumour spread by rivals who failed in the game of life and work.\n\nIn their sojourn along the route to enlightenment, communities and societies have had to graduate from a way of life and work dominated by knowledge based predominately on belief in the power of supernatural forces and superstition. Those who have failed or are yet to move out of the realm of superstition to embrace ways of life and work determined by science-based knowledge continue to treat their leaders and high performers indifferently. It is not surprising that many ordinary men and women will decline leadership or supervisory positions for fear of having their lives extinguished both literally and figuratively.\n\nTo the extent that many African communities remain trapped in the clasp of 'primitive' superstition, it is to be expected that school children will continue to lead their communities as 'morality and ethics police' against people who resort to or are alleged to resort to supernatural forces (witchcraft) to enhance aspects of the lives or work. Our urban and rural communities will continue to endure their seasonal 'witch-bashing'. In its proper context the campaign to rid the community of witches and other miscreants is about the persecution of high performers and serial over-achievers whose only crime is failure to curb their industrious spirit or competitiveness.\n\nAt another level, the foregoing behaviour has left our leadership wondering whether or not contemporary African communities have fully escaped from the pull of the superstition-based culture. The leadership and social commentators have been at pains to explain this society's habit of destroying its heroes. Many in the African community are now convinced that self-destructive behaviour is a product of unrestrained envy and jealousy. Envy and jealousy have spawned a pervasive syndrome commonly known, among the African-American community, as the 'PHD' 'pull-him-down' syndrome that is so typical of crabs in a barrel. This behaviour can only be explained in terms of the prolonged and pervasive culture of deprivation and dysfunctionality that has not lost its grip on contemporary black society both in the continent and the diaspora.\n\nAs Huggins points out, the habit of envy and resentment towards the successful sections of the black community accounts, in part, for its inability to compete or out-compete the non-African elements of whatever society black people find themselves operating in. Therefore, the black community's inability to share and celebrate the achievements of individual members continues to destroy many an illustrious career or reputation while leadership looks on powerlessly.\n\nIn its transition from chronic deprivation to a world characterised by an abundance of opportunity, post-apartheid black South African society continues to be frustrated and embarrassed by a spate of endless incidents of impropriety including acts - real and imagined - of corruption, neglect or abuse of power and authority. True, the sudden release of abundant opportunities without proper internal discipline and controls has placed many inexperienced men and women into situations where temptation is never too far away. Yet, there are also stories about men and women who have and are making progress on the ladder of leadership success. The heavy cloud of corruption and impropriety surrounding the insurgent black leadership/managerial class comes like manna to those without and within the black community who, for different reasons, revel in sustaining the belief that Africans are genetically incapable of rising above centuries of bad press. The said irony within both the South African and black-American communities is that the modern peddlers of African incompetence and corruption are, in the main, black people themselves.\n\nThe hatchet of the destruction of African success and achievement lies firmly in the hands of a category of black men and women who, themselves, suffer from serial under-achievement. This is simply a case of those sinking to the bottom being resentful of those who escaped a similar fate. And there is very little else to it. Yet, hiding behind the noble duty of protecting and promoting our rainbow democracy and the leadership, some African commentators have attempted to demolish the reputations and integrity of some of Africa's most revered leaders - Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu included. Coming as they do from the supposedly enlightened sections of the black community, the mudslinging tactics have been a growing cause for concern among the remaining black leaders and managers who go about their business with the proverbial sword coming closer each day. The interim study has established, inter alia, that large sections of the black community are beginning to see through the hidden motive of the African self-demolition brigade.\n\nWhile many concerned black leaders had initially dismissed the African character assassination phenomenon as entirely the work of so-called third-force of the disgruntled white right, the leadership has been forced to revise its position somewhat. Findings from the interim research suggest that many of these activities are fabricated and promoted by well-placed members of the black elite. Acting under the guise of concerned employees or committed members of society, they cover their reprehensible actions under the guise of blowing the whistle against corrupt colleagues. Some black leaders and managers have gone as far as to suggest that instead of heaping all blame on the mass media, corrective action should be taken against the true culprits, namely, disgruntled or undisciplined members and/or employees within organizations. This does not let off the hook some black journalists whose hobby and business is to publish unsubstantiated allegations against innocent members of the black elite in general, and black leaders in particular. Looked at from this point, there is little to separate under-informed, superstitious youths from their modern-day African scribes. As will become evident, the behaviour under discussion has roots which are deeply imbedded both in the soul and the underdog history of the black community. Among the Jewish ghettos of Nazi Europe, this behaviour was known as selbsthaste (self-hatred).\n\nIn terms of the foregoing, it is not surprising that elements within our society have succeeded in dissuading our high performers/achievers and leaders from playing their roles. Consequently many black leaders and achievers turn their backs on leadership roles in whatever form they may come. It is safe to say, therefore, that for as long as ordinary men and women remain ignorant about the 'X-factor'(s) behind the effective behaviour of colleagues and associates, they will remain reluctant to embrace the achievers as useful path-finders. They would rather make do with external or foreign role models that, historically, have been associated with high performance. Foreign high achievers are seldom begrudged their achievements for the simple reason that the 'x-factor'(s) of their successes remain unknown. For similar reasons, traditional Africans will prefer to consult a spiritual diviner who is either a foreigner or lives in foreign or remote places because such a diviner is associated with extraordinary powers and insights. Locals are more interested in obtaining the assistance of the 'foreign' spiritual guide rather than finding out why he is so good.\n\nThe foregoing also explains, in part, black South Africans' misperceptions that members of the white ethnic groups are generally more effective than their indigenous counterparts. Many aspirant black managers are routinely frustrated by those of their colleagues who, on making it into the top executive clubs, elect to surround themselves with an exclusive set of white advisors and specialists. The common explanation is that these white advisors and specialists are prepared to work harder than the newly arrived aspirant black managers. This position holds throughout both the public and the private sectors: the practice is more pronounced the higher one goes up the management/leadership echelons. In short, the first generation of black leaders and managers who are breaking through the remaining complex maze of unwritten practices that were meant to keep the indigenous majority on the outer reaches of white boardrooms and management teams are learning the aphorism 'and please close the door behind you'. This effectively shuts off hordes of black aspirant brothers and sisters who 'could not crack it'. They are said not to possess the 'Effectiveness DNA' of their white counterparts.\n\nFor this and other reasons, the study is required to answer the question: how does one go about encouraging white ethnic groups to share the secrets of their success with the insurgent black management/leadership cadres without resorting to punitive measures such as Affirmative Action? At the same time, we are required to establish whether or not the African component of the 'rainbow'* democracy possesses anything that resembles the leadership 'x-factor' of highly effective ethnic groups that have operated within our society for decades or centuries. What is it that the African element of post-apartheid South Africa needs to retain or let go as he or she borrows the effectiveness code from white ethnic groups or individuals who have amassed reputations for high performance and high leadership effectiveness?\n\nThe findings of the interim study indicate that the search for a single reason for the effectiveness of one race or ethnic group is less likely to produce the desired results. Faced with this question, a section of the Jewish community proceeded to lecture the black researchers about the danger of providing short and over-simplified answers to situations that require detailed, complex explanations. Without any hint of discourtesy, the Jewish leaders graciously told the non-Jewish researchers a little story about an encounter between one of Jewry's most revered sages, Hillel*, and a keen student of the Jewish Bible. The sage advised the proselyte to pay attention to the item relating to neighbourly love. But the real sting in the tail of the story is the advice to the student to study, study, and study the rest of the biblical text in order to acquire the requisite wisdom. By the same token, the Jewish leaders were telling the non-Jewish researchers that there are no short cuts to the question: what makes the Jews behave differently from other groups inside or outside business? Yes, they pay attention to the survival interests of the group but, in addition, they work painstakingly harder and smarter than the other guy.\n\nIn the context of the search for the most effective and suitable leadership effectiveness model, Hillel's wise counsel is that we should not go for the short and simple answers � what is commonly known in leadership/management circles as a one or two answers. In truth, there is no such thing as a single-cell summary or x-factor of leadership. As the saying goes, the devil lies in the detail. It is the lazy man or woman's lot to be content with the over-digested regurgitations of others. Contemporary writers and researchers on the topic of leadership effectiveness warn against the human propensity for the passepartout � the panacea or silver bullet that saves us from digging through mounds of detail before we could get to the enlightening truth. In essence, the fact that real solutions have the knack of appearing too simple does not mean that the processes used to discover them are equally simple. Our science does not as yet possess the requisite capacity to produce single simple solutions.\n\nII. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF LEADERSHIP\n\n1. Leadership through Traditional Knowledge Systems and Concepts\n\nThe relationship between leadership and philosophy has not seen much improvement since the demise of ancient western civilizations. Casual references from scholars and admirers of both philosophy and leadership have kept alive memories of the once flourishing relationship. Such mentions go as far back as Plato, Caesar, and Plutarch. And some of them can be found in the biblical texts of the Pentateuch. The lack of improvement in the tenuous relationship lies in the perception that both philosophy and leadership trace their roots not to science but to a form of ancient art that was the preserve of the intellectual elite of society.\n\nThe foregoing highlights an attitude that has existed largely in the west and in societies whose systems are now calibrated according to the systems imposed by or received from the west. Conversely, societies whose traditional systems have � with periodic interruptions - kept their knowledge capital alive through customs and ritual practice view and approach philosophy and leadership rather differently. The same goes for religion, art, music and other disciplines which have retained their currency since time out of mind. They continue to exist and are practised and enjoyed by not only by the intellectual elite but also by ordinary women and men throughout society albeit with the stigma of being backward. However, the value and relevance of traditional systems of knowledge including religion, philosophical thought, and leadership have and continue to be under attack from of the race towards modernization. Many of the world's contemporary societies or communities are experiencing deep and bitter internal divisions over whether or not they should retain traditional knowledge forms whose currency has been questioned by the advocates of modernization.\n\nCompared to many disciplines which are central to traditional knowledge systems - religion, philosophy, traditional medicine, to name a few, leadership appears to have fared rather badly. Attitudes towards leaders and leadership, as topics for study and comment, are not as clearly articulated among old societies or communities that relied almost exclusively on oral tradition to store and transport, from one generation to another, their knowledge, wisdoms, philosophies, and ideas. Many philosophical thoughts, concepts and ideas have lost the tributaries on which they had relied for integrity, completeness or impact. This is particularly true of part of African society which were either ignorant or lacked the habit to preserve their knowledge and experiential capital through the medium of the written word. This, therefore, makes the task of piecing together pieces of old philosophical concepts and ideas exceedingly difficult. The scholar or researcher has to employ an array of tools and resources to accomplish such a task. It is not entirely true to suggest that all is lost for, as we shall soon see, there are communities and societies that have successfully kept alive their traditional thoughts, concepts and ideas. It is to these enduring concepts and ideas that we return later for a preliminary study and analysis of the concept of leadership.\n\nThe issue of whether or not this or that society recorded valuable concepts and ideas in writing does not in any way mean they neither knew nor experienced leadership. The fact that they have thrived to this day is sufficient proof of the effectiveness of whatever leadership systems and approaches were available to them. As we shall soon see from arguments based on African, Indian and Jewish philosophies and traditional concepts, ideas and processes, the very basis of modern knowledge is oral tradition. As scholars point out, it is unfortunate that the communities of Africa did not preserve or transfer their wisdoms, customs, and ritual systems in written form. These issues are presented in more detail in the section(s) of the report dedicated to the philosophical thought and traditional concepts and ideas of African and Indian peoples.\n\nSuffice it to state at this juncture that contemporary research has established that leadership occurs universally. To this end, Bass (4) observes that the earliest literature on leadership was concerned almost entirely with theoretical issues. Theorists sought to identify different types of leadership and to relate them to the functional demands of society. In addition, they sought to account for the emergence of leadership either by examining the qualities of the leader or the elements of the situation. Earlier theorists can be differentiated from more recent ones primarily by virtue of the fact that they failed to consider the interaction between individual and situational variables; and they tended to develop more comprehensive theories than do their more recent counterparts. The failure of recent researchers to investigate certain areas of the leadership problem can be attributed in part to their empirical as opposed to their theoretical orientation. Whereas theorists may attempt to comprehend a problem in its entirety, empiricists tend to concern themselves with those aspects of the problem that are perceived as researchable in terms of availability of samples and measurability of variables. But theory and research combine to yield insight into a problem.\n\n2. Brief Review of the Leadership Thought of Traditional Societies\n\nWe have, therefore, looked at two to three approaches which are familiar among scholars and researchers of Indian and Jewish societies. Given that until the last decade of the twentieth century South Africa was regarded by itself and others to be a country more in tune with the western than African way of life and thought, we have decided to introduce methodological approaches and concepts that reflect more fully and accurately the stance to be adopted by scholars and researchers within post-apartheid South Africa. The African approach identifies and confirms aspects of the African mind which appear to have been lost to generations of South Africans who were, for many decades, effectively cut off from their motherland. With few exceptions, the vast majority of South African scholars, researchers and intelligentsia missed out on processes and developments which shaped post-colonial African thinking about approaches to philosophical thought and traditions.\n\nIn essence, the contemporary African approach holds that African concepts and ideas about life have survived the combined onslaught of colonial and post-colonial domination and influence. Enduring African concepts are reflected in the way contemporary African people define, approach and relate to the world around them. Notwithstanding the fact that for centuries African people were force-fed foreign or western concepts and ideas � under the guise of modernization � these foreign ideas and concepts failed to dislodge Africa's indigenous concepts and ideas. However, in their daily life, African people have memorised western ways of coping with western-ordered life, work and worship. The task facing researchers of African leadership is which of the enduring traditional African concepts and ideas can be salvaged for adoption or re-use in a situation where Africans continue to experience ongoing conflicts between foreign and indigenous concepts and ideas.\n\nAfrican traditional concepts and methods are compared with those of tradition-rich philosophical systems of India and Jewry. Both these peoples have travelled a similar road through histories dominated by tensions and conflicts with foreign concepts and ideas. Yet, both have successfully held on to their traditions and concepts. Both have used and continue to use home-grown methods to maintain some workable co-existence between indigenous systems of knowledge and those borrowed from foreign cultures. Their respective leaders and intelligentsia can and do function productively and effectively through combinations of indigenous and foreign concepts. Jewish thought leaders have been most active and most successful at influencing western thought and development. There is no area of contemporary society which has not benefited from the outstanding contributions of individual Jewish thinkers, scientists, artists and so forth.\n\nThe current research into the philosophical and traditional foundations of leadership is particularly interested in learning about and from the approaches and processes followed by Jewish and Indian thought leaders. We wish to know and understand the strategies and tactics adopted by Indian and Jewish leadership to manage or contain foreign influences which, at one time or other, threatened to extinguish the life out of indigenous tradition knowledge systems they had reduce to embers.\n\nIII. THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF AFRICAN LEADERSHIP\n\n1. Conflict between Old and Contemporary Approaches\n\nAn evaluation of the history and evolution of African leadership cannot be considered comprehensive without a review of African philosophical traditions and thought. A people's philosophy reflects the essence of who they are and where they are headed vis-à-vis their history, values, ideals, self-image and the nature of their relationships with the world around them. Leadership is at the centre of these social dynamics and relationships.\n\nPreliminary research interviews conducted thus far suggest that a section of the black population is either sceptical or suspicious of the motives underlying the decision to conduct a wide-ranging study of African leadership. The sceptics maintain that African community has made little or no meaningful contribution to the development of leadership and whatever body of knowledge or science lies behind it. Some suggest that Africa's contribution can be summed up in one word: uBuntu � a concept they believe is often applied out of context. Others have proposed that the study or promotion of African leadership themes and values runs the risk of launching contemporary African society and its institutions on a retrogressive path. Such a path, it is said, will lead to pre-historic African tribal life that has existed only in the minds of romantic historians and writers of African fantasies. The sceptics argue further that contemporary western leadership principles and values have served this country's institutions well and they do not, therefore, see any reason for replacing them with something that has neither proven credibility nor track record.\n\nThe position adopted by those against the pursuit of African leadership is identical to that used by scholars who question the legitimacy of African philosophical tradition and thought. Our view is that students of African leadership should borrow the analytic approaches and methodologies used by the proponents of African philosophy � more notably, Gyekye (5), and Owomoyela (6). These approaches and methodologies are highlighted in what follows. Gyekye's approach is premised on the argument that it is legitimate and intelligible to talk of \"African philosophy,\" the basis of which is the common or pervasive features in African cultural and thought systems. He does not claim that the features of African life and thought he presents are peculiarly African, for they are in fact found in non-African traditional settings as well. But this observation is harmless in itself, and does not detract from the need to explore ideas from African perspective.\n\nGiven that African philosophical systems will not be unique, the important thing is to see how the ideas of being, causation, the nature of a person, destiny, evil, morality, the nature of human society and social relationships, etc., are comprehended and analysed by African thinkers on the basis of African cultural and intellectual experience. African perspectives on these ideas may be similar to those of others; nevertheless, they are worth examining within African conceptual crucible. After all, the fact that Indians, Chinese and Japanese have concepts of communalism or destiny, for instance, does not mean that those concepts are necessarily the same as those of African thinkers (5).\n\n2. Points of Conceptual Convergence in African Philosophical Thought\n\nThe foregoing must be read against Gyekye's argument that a given culture forms the basis of a philosophy and creates the controlling and organising categories and principles for philosophising. Then, a philosophical discourse that critically interacts or communes with African cultural and intellectual experiences, with African mentalities and traditions, will be African. That thesis does not have to be accepted by all Africans in order for it to be African, nor does it have to be generalised for all Africans. It only needs to be the results of the reflective exertions of an African thinker, aimed at giving analytical attention to the intellectual foundations of African culture and experience. That is all.\n\nWhen modern African philosophers discuss ideas produced by African traditional thinkers, or when they philosophise with the contemporary African situation in mind, diverse, even incompatible, analyses will undoubtedly emerge. Yet they will all come under the umbrella of African philosophy. Even though what will emerge as African philosophy will in reality be a philosophical mosaic, this fact will not detract from Africanness of those philosophies. They will, after all, be the product of the \"African mind,\" just as western culture -western mind - constitutes the ground for western philosophy, which also consists of numerous philosophies. (5)\n\nThere is indeed no single philosophical idea or doctrine shared or adhered to by all Europeans or westerners; yet such an idea or doctrine does not, on that account, cease to be European or western. As noted recently by a western philosopher, \"There is no such thing as contemporary philosophy, of course, at least if this is construed as some sum total of commonly held tenets of the day. There are contemporary philosophies, philosophies as numerous, one sometimes thinks, as philosophers.\" But it must be noted that despite the numerousness of these philosophies (produced by western philosophers), they all come, nevertheless, under the umbrella of western philosophy. The reason for this is that they are all grounded in the western cultural experience. (5)\n\nGyekye concludes that modern African philosophers should turn their philosophical gaze on the intellectual foundations of African culture and experience (in addition to contributions to western philosophy, which some of them are in a hurry to pursue). It is never too late in human history to start from where one should start (or should have started). As part of the people of Africa and speaking their languages - which fact is essential for investigating the philosophy of a people - modern African philosophers are in a unique position to elucidate, analyse, and interpret the philosophy of African peoples and to sharpen its contours on the global philosophical map.\n\nIn terms of the approach adopted by African philosophers and Africanist writers, arguments against the existence or legitimacy of the concept of African leadership are, therefore, unwarranted. African people are entitled to exercise their right to conduct comparative analyses of the strengths and weaknesses of traditional and contemporary African leadership styles against those adopted or adapted from non-African societies. They cannot be expected to continue clinging on to foreign leadership approaches, styles or practices that neither acknowledge nor incorporate indigenous leadership principles, values or experiences that are more effective than the former. Further, they should be excused for increasingly questioning the importance of leadership values and practices that not resonate with enduring African values including communalism, humanism, egalitarianism, consensus, and a sense of hierarchy. The affirmation of the existence of African leadership does not imply that this brand of leadership is totally different from, inferior or superior to the western or oriental brands of leadership. The affirmation is brought about by the need to allow Africans to apply and adopt and adapt different leadership practices or styles to circumstances that are uniquely African. (5)\n\nJanheinz Jahn (7) argues that the example of Japan teaches us that a people can appropriate modern technology and modern forms of organisation without abandoning their traditional culture; that modernity can be assimilated into a non-European culture without destroying it. Could something of the same kind happen in Africa? It will be objected that Japan and Africa are not comparable, since their cultures lie on different levels. According to Jaspers (7), history has shown two great advances. First, after the age of myth, which includes pre-history and the history of the great early cultures, reflective thought began between 900 and 800 BC in Greece and Asia Minor, simultaneously but independently. It was this advance that really set history in motion, transformed it and determined its direction.\n\nThe second advance is the age of science and technology, which now in its turn is everywhere taking the lead and transforming all mankind. Japan, like Europe, is said to have been affected by the first advance and thus to be a land of higher culture, while Africa is only just being brought into the mainstream of history. Here all signs of a higher culture are wanting. This part of the globe is inhabited by primitive peoples who may choose between extinction or what, asks Jahn?\n\nJaspers (7) does not even allow these primitive peoples a chance of adaptation. He foresees for them no adjustment, but only their extinction or the fate of becoming mere raw material to be processed by technological civilisation. For the Australian aborigines, the South Sea Islanders, and the American Indians, the thesis of Jaspers seems largely valid. For Africans it clearly fails to hold, for they managed to survive despite the most intense pressure of slave trading and slavery; nor does it look as if they were prepared to furnish the raw material for a technical world civilisation. The present flood of literature on Africa arises precisely from the disquieting fact that Africans are not behaving as those planners and prophets who arrogantly dispose of them predicted they would behave. So the reader rushes from one analysis to another, for he cannot shake off the feeling that Africans themselves have a part to play; he wants to know what Africans are really feeling and thinking, yet the shrewder authors leave him with a question mark.\n\nJahn poses the question: whether in confronting western culture, Africa reacts differently today from the way she did in the past. Basil Davidson (8) has covered most of the ground raised by Jahn's question. For instance, Davidson maintains that it will be found that even when African peoples have taken much from outside, at different times and places, their process of borrowing � whether of techniques or beliefs � has always undergone an adaptation, through environment and circumstance, into societies and cultures and civilisations which became specifically and uniquely African. Achievement and failure can both be traced to the same complex and endlessly interesting source: the interplay of men and their environment. It is, therefore, within Africa's capacity to fashion the right solutions to its prevailing developmental problems. Africa can match the example of post-Hiroshima Japan. It is our hope that, in the weeks and months that lie ahead, the African leadership initiative will focus attention on ways through which African leaders can or should tackle the 'Japanese challenge'. (8) (cf. Satoru Tsuchiya, \"The Prospects for the African Culture: in Appendix I.)\n\n3. False Impressions about African Traditional Philosophy\n\nAs has been the case with African traditional philosophy, the sceptics are bound to argue that the legitimacy of the concept of African leadership is grossly compromised by the absence of a well-documented body of knowledge based on the accumulated practices and experiences of generations of African people. Gyekye (5) concludes that the complete denial by some scholars of philosophy among African peoples, the assumed monolithic nature of African traditional thought, the alleged non-individualistic (collective) and uncritical nature of that thought are some of the mistaken impressions about African traditional philosophical thought.\n\nThere are two principal reasons for the currency of these impressions. The first relates of course to the lack of literate culture in Africa's history, which has wrought untold, irretrievable damage not only to African philosophy but to other aspects African life, such as its history. The second reason is that some scholars have come to their conclusions on the basis of incomplete and superficial research and analysis. (5)\n\n4. Constraints Impeding the Study of African Traditional Leadership\n\nContemporary African and Africanist scholars � and notably Kwame Gyekye - have identified a number of methodological constraints and challenges that must be heeded by those intending to study issues such as African philosophy, culture or leadership. The ideas presented in the next few paragraphs are paraphrased and borrowed from an essay by Gyekye on the study of African philosophy.\n\n4.1.. Lack of Doxographic Tradition\n\nThe most obvious and the greatest difficulty in studying or researching African traditional philosophy stems from the fact that it is an unwritten, an undocumented philosophy. The question then becomes how one can succeed in resurrecting the philosophical doctrines and arguments of African thinkers. In Africa, philosophy can be found in the myths, proverbs, folk tales, and beliefs of the people. There are, however, enormous difficulties in understanding and interpreting them. The possibility of misunderstanding and misinterpretation is real; the possibility of wrongly attributing views is always there. One may undertake interviews and discussions with living traditional wise people in an attempt to overcome this difficulty, but one can never be sure that the conceptions or interpretations of the traditional elders are themselves not coloured by ideas and doctrines of Christianity or Islam* with which some of them are acquainted. (5)\n\n4.2.. Connecting Isolated and Unrelated Ideas\n\nAlthough some philosophical ideas can certainly be distilled from sources mentioned above and from discussions with traditional thinkers, a further difficulty arises in connecting isolated and sometimes unrelated ideas into a coherent system, even assuming the compatibility of those ideas. The scholar of African philosophy must pay attention to the logic of ideas, that is, the logical relations between them, draw inferences, and suggest explanations that introduce some order into the fragmentary and chaotic mass of discrete ideas. This exercise in logic, conceptual ordering, and theorising is not easy. It requires a great deal of experience in scholarship and textual analysis; it requires painstaking care; it presupposes a great deal of sustained interest and enthusiasm on the part of the scholar. Unless one's analytical interpretation is marked by such intellectual and dispositional virtues, one may not make much of it. (5)\n\n5. Introducing Foreign Ideas and Concepts\n\nThe scholar of African traditional philosophy, who almost invariably was trained in a western philosophical environment and who perhaps cannot completely and immediately divorce him- or herself from that philosophical background, faces another difficulty viz. the possibility of introducing foreign ideas into the analyses, and thus understanding African philosophy through foreign eyes. This danger becomes more real when one considers that the scholar probably will be using a foreign language in interpreting and analysing African thought, a (foreign) language that is both structurally different from African language (in which the concepts originally occur) and that is rooted in the life of a rather different culture. (5)\n\n6. Translating Concepts\n\nThe analysis in one language of concepts originally expressed in another language naturally involves translation. But in translation we are dealing not just with words but with concepts as well. It is the translation of concepts that gives rise to serious problems. This is a further difficulty: how does one deal with the diverse and sometimes incompatible views that emerge from interviews and discussions with traditional thinkers and from proverbs and other sources? These difficulties are not insurmountable nor are they peculiar to the study of an unwritten philosophy. The serious scholar should be able to study and present doctrines in African traditional philosophy as clearly and accurately as possible. (5)\n\nThe ideas of one conceptual system can be explicated in the language of another system. In explicating and analysing African concepts in a foreign language, a number of things need to be done. These include profound inquiry into the nature of the concept in both African language and the language which is to be used for translation; where a word has diverse or complex meanings, the necessary qualifications must be made; it may be necessary sometimes both to give reasons why a particular word is being used to translate another word, and to show one's awareness of the difficulties in translating a particular word. Even though these operations may not necessarily achieve complete success, they should ensure a high degree of correctness in our translation and thus our understanding. Thus, even though Akan (Yoruba) thought may in some respects be different in its concepts and doctrines from western philosophy, the differences are such as can be captured by the resources of a western language like English. The problem of translation therefore is not insurmountable. (5)\n\nOn the question of understanding and interpretation, the scholar should try to get at the inner meaning of the material in question. Even if one speaks the language of the thinkers whose philosophical ideas he is studying, one should pay particular attention to the philology and semantics of that language. On points of interpretation one should frequently consult not only with those known to be well versed in the nuances of the language, but also with the traditional thinkers about concepts expressed in the language and the designata of those concepts. How a thinker handles a concept expressed in the original language is an essential part of any attempt to interpret and appreciate that thought. The attempt to analyse, interpret, and present philosophical ideas unavoidably requires one to engage in supplying, within limits, \"the missing links in thought\" (5).\n\n7. Unscrambling Indigenous Ideas from Christianity and Islam\n\nRegarding the difficulty of getting at indigenous ideas in the light of Africa's historical contact with Christianity and Islam, it must be borne in mind that in every African community, there are certain individuals who are steeped in the traditional lore. These individuals are regarded as wise persons in their own right. They stand out in their own communities and command the respect and esteem of their townsfolk. Some of them have had no formal education at all; others have had some formal (Western) education, mostly through elementary school. While some may be Christians or churchgoers and so have some acquaintance with Christianity, all of them, in discussions, are able intellectually to distinguish between traditional conceptions and those of Christianity and of Islam as well. (5)\n\nThe scholar should also be constantly on guard against reading preconceived notions into a study of African thought. Consciousness of this pitfall will do much to ward off the temptation to analyse the ideas of African philosophy within a foreign conceptual framework.\n\n8. Prejudicial Profiling of Africa and its Traditions\n\nThis search for deeper knowledge and understanding of Africa's traditions and leadership practices starts by looking into the people's group memory that stretches well beyond the first written word about Africa, its peoples and their ways. A mammoth task indeed. The magnitude of the task is compounded by scholastic rivalries that break out each time some essay or (quasi-) scientific paper or book is published about Africa.\n\nEvidently, tenderfoot commentators on matters African need more than the proverbial intellectual thick skin. To be taken seriously by hardboiled Africanists (and their detractors), they need a crash course on competing schools of thought and their respective methodological approaches. They also need to acquaint themselves with important themes and trends that have emerged out of the post-1960s period of heightened African scholarship. In this regard, they can take comfort in the fact that the second half of the 20th century saw African scholarship and literature catching up with trends emanating from western and eastern cultures. By the close of the previous century, trends in African scholarship and literature had almost gone full circle.\n\nCommenting on the status of African scholarship and literature, Jahn observes that Africa is entering world history. There is a flow of books and articles dealing with this process in its political, economic, sociological and psychological aspects. But all these expositions have in common a single conviction; they are all persuaded that one single pattern of cultural change is forming. Through the influence of Europe, it is believed, Africa is adapting herself, giving up her traditions and adopting foreign ideas, methods of work, forms of government and principles of economic organisation. (7)\n\nThe time of transition, whether short or long, is thought to be a time of crisis which confronts all Africans with the decision either to accept modern civilisation and survive, or to perish with their own traditions. Some observers believe in a gradual transition, and others in a sudden transition, but all are agreed that a fully Europeanised Africa will be the end product of the process. Europe is alleged to provide the model, Africa to copy it; Europe to be spiritually the giving, Africa the receiving partner. (7)\n\nSince Europe is held to be the teacher and Africa the pupil, Europe is to decide when Africa is ripe: ripe for a faith, ripe for action, ripe for freedom. Europe is thought to know what is good for Africa, better than Africa herself. Admittedly, Europe offers different and rival doctrines - democracy or communism, Christianity or atheism - and in choosing between these the pupil may gain status for herself - a process which is usually regretted; yet this alters nothing in the general pattern. Whether Africa accepts the doctrines one recommends or those one warns her against, she must give up her own traditions: there are no other possibilities to be considered. (7)\n\nThe justification for this is that the age of technology has produced conditions from which it is no longer possible for any nation to escape. Therefore those who wish to give up hoe, machete, bow and arrow and to have combines and guns, must also give up healing by witchcraft, polygamy and 'superstition'; in short, they must give up their whole culture. If this argument is valid, then the pattern of African assimilation to Europe is valid also. But if it is not valid, and a third possibility is conceivable - if Africa can master modern technology yet retain a modified African culture - what then are all the prognoses and projects which fail to take this culture into consideration? Thus the question of the future of Africa becomes the question of the existence of Africa with its own culture. (7\n\nJahn contends Africa is the bedrock on which African leadership is founded. Our view is that, before we start analysing the nature, strengths and weaknesses of African leadership and its values, we have first to come to terms with the influence that African culture has had on the behaviour of African leaders and the nature, quality and performance of African leadership institutions. A review of African leadership becomes, in essence, a review of African history and development, culture and values, philosophy, identity and belief systems.\n\nThere are, indeed, no shortcuts and no 'two-pager' answers to questions about the nature and relevance of African leadership in contemporary African society. Such an analysis does not limit itself to so-called primitive African culture and leadership systems. On the contrary, the review of contemporary African leadership focuses on neo-African culture. This is a culture built on two components - the European component, which is generally known to most South Africans, and the traditional African component, which is a source of controversy or scepticism especially among the indigenous African elite.\n\nJahn posits the view that this needs justification, for it will be objected that there has never been a traditional African culture as a whole, but only a plurality of different 'primitive' cultures. This objection will be supported by various investigations of ethnologists. But the question of whether or not a plurality can also be understood as a unity is to a great extent one of interpretation. European research has always had the plurality in view and has scarcely noticed the common denominator. When it comes to the neo-African culture, it is the unity that is slightly stressed.\n\nJahn further states, it will be objected that this produces a false picture of the past, a myth instead of an objective picture of history. But this is the case with every history. Every age has a definite picture of all past events accessible to it, a picture peculiar to itself. Legend is not one of the forms, but rather the only form, in which we can imaginatively consider and relive history. All history is saga and myth, and as such the product of the state of our intellectual powers at a particular time: of our capacity for comprehension, the vigour of our imagination, our feeling for reality. The Africa presented by the ethnologist is a legend in which we used to believe. African tradition as it appears in the light of neo-African culture may also be a legend - but it is the legend in which African intelligence believes. And it is their perfect right to declare authentic, correct and true those components of their past which they believe to be so.\n\nMoreover, if it is not objective, the conception of the tradition as it appears in the light of neo-African culture is nevertheless the only true one, since it is the one which will from now on determine the future of Africa. For several centuries Africa has had to suffer under the conception of the African past formed by Europe. As long as this was so, that European conception was 'true', that is to say effective. But the present and the future on the other hand will be determined by the conception that African intelligence forms of the African past. Neo-African culture appears as an unbroken extension, as the legitimate heir of tradition. Only where man feels himself to be heir and successor to the past has he the strength for a new beginning.\n\nSouth Africans who stayed to fight the scourge of apartheid from within had little involvement in debates concerning the nature and profile of the post-colonial African state. Many were routinely incarcerated, maimed or killed for daring to think aloud about the prospects of a post-apartheid, democratic state. For the majority of black South Africans dreams about Pan-Africanism were safer unexpressed even within one's immediate family. Graduate and postgraduate students were encouraged to steer clear of political themes for their research topics. In the Apartheid State everything was political. It was, therefore, impossible for black people to relate to their children the history, philosophy, self-identity, or aspirations of their own tribe, ethnic or race group without risking being locked up for indulging in some treasonable offence. To the majority of black and white South Africans living under apartheid, Africa was some faraway place that had little or nothing similar to or to do with South Africa.\n\nGiven this mindset, generations of black and white South Africans grew up despising anything that came from or happened in Africa. For them, nothing good or better happened in Africa. Now that the apartheid nightmare has evaporated, many South Africans, black South Africans in particular, have to face the uphill task of learning to come to terms with the rest of Africa. More especially, they need to know and understand what it is they may have missed or gained during the decades of colonial and apartheid isolation. Further, they need to work out what or why it is that, whenever they engage with fellow Africans, they experience a sense of incompleteness. In other words, what makes them feel less African than other Africans? And what, if anything, do they need to do or not do in order to gain a sense of African wholeness?\n\nOne of the objectives of this project is to find suitable ways to help South Africans in general, and black South Africans in particular, to reconnect with African historical facts, cultural values and philosophy that have hitherto been presented as neither similar nor connected. This is important especially for those generations of black South Africans who grew up believing that they had more in common with African-Americans than with continental African communities to whom they remained tethered by geography, culture and history. Irrespective of levels of ignorance and literacy, South African black people have, over decades, held firmly to the belief that they have a history � one that binds them to the one common ancestor with Africans elsewhere in the continent.\n\nYet, many generations of black South Africans are poorly informed about how their particular community relates to its continental counterparts especially in the context of the pre-colonial era and the early contact with Europeans, slavery, colonial and neo-colonial periods. Apartheid and its impact on the cultural values and self-image of black South Africans complicate their attempts at building working relationships with fellow Africans. Africa's southward migration to the post-apartheid economic powerhouse creates immense psychological, social and economic strains on African leaders and their attempts to, finally, realize the centuries-old Pan-African dream.\n\n9. Uncomplimentary Positioning of Africa and the African Mind\n\nThe battle for Africa (and Africanity) (6) is in a new and more difficult phase than during colonialism, more difficult because in the earlier phase the lines were clearly drawn, and the choices were simple � submission to alien rule or insistence on self-determination. The enemy was also easily identifiable; he was a foreigner and an oppressor. Now the issues are not so clear-cut and the adversary not so easily apparent. The enemy is not necessarily foreign, and his rhetoric is often patriotic and bolstered with concern, undoubtedly genuine, for \"development\", or scientific and technological advancement.\n\nThe scrutiny of the essence of African leadership must pay particular attention to the observations, admonitions and criticisms that African and Africanist scholars have made in analytic projects of this type.\n\n10. Historical Romance and Prejudice\n\nAs they take a fresh look at what has been written about Africa's history, South Africans will do well to align themselves with the school(s) of thought whose approach and assumptions reflect accurately or sympathetically their position throughout the continent's history i.e. from the proto-historic era through the episodic periods characterized by slavery, colonial conquest and the post-colonial and apartheid era. Contemporary historiographers and a variety of commentators have, to date, exposed as romantic conjecture, racist and prejudicial, the foundations of most influential history books produced by western writers and explorers on Africa. Davidson agrees that the credibility of many of these anthologies has since foundered on the rocks of prejudice and the whirlpool of romance. (8)\n\nThose who have gone down in the whirlpool of romance are of two kinds. Some have thought it wise and necessary to fill their charts of the African past with tales of Sheba and Ophir, of strange Phoenicians building cities in Rhodesia and mysterious peoples \"from the north\" who came and stayed but they vanished altogether.* These are the modern versions, to vary the metaphor, of bearded monsters and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders; and a better understanding of the subject is gently but firmly erasing them from the map. Other romantics, moved by a sentiment that may be more generous but is no more scientific, have come to grief through writing \"high civilisations\" into Africa's past where evidence for them is entirely lacking. On the opposite side there are those who have shipwrecked themselves on the rocks of prejudice: the rock, in this case, of unremitting scepticism. It is an old and hoary rock, mute and menacing, covered with the debris of sad reputations. (8)\n\nMcLynn (9) notes that Africa remains the focus for the fanciful imaginations of non-Africans. 'Africa will always be the Africa of the Victorian atlas, the blank unexplored continent the shape of the human heart.' The African heart so described by Graham Greene acquired a new layer of meaning when Joseph Conrad portrayed the Congo under King Leopold as a heart of darkness, a place where barbarism triumphs over humanity, nature over technology, biology over culture, id over superego.\n\n11. Africa seen as a \"Continent without a Past\"\n\nGraham Connah (10) remarks that four decades ago, Grahame Clarke characterized Africa as a continent that had already during Late Pleistocene times slipped far behind in the race of progress. Such a view at best seems quaint and dated, at worst Eurocentric and prejudiced. This view was indicative not only of the lack of research into Africa's later past but also of an attitude that still exists, at least in the public mind, in many parts of the world outside Africa. In terms of its perceived backward or static image, particularly prevalent around the 1960s, Africa was to be denied parts of itself, its northern extremes being regarded as more Mediterranean than African and Egypt being thought of as more Near-Eastern. In the view of some European historians, however, there was not really anything to remember.\n\nReturning to writers of the early twentieth century, Davidson (11) observes that Georg Hegel - most notably - claimed that Africa had no history prior to direct contact with Europe. Therefore Africans, having made no history of their own, had clearly made no development of their own. Therefore they were not properly human, and could not be left to themselves, but had to be 'led' towards civilization by other people: that is, by the people of Europe and most particularly of Britain and France.\n\nTypically, these myths projected the picture of an Africa inhabited by 'grown-up children' by beings who, in the words of the famous nineteenth century explorer Richard Burton, might be normal when children, but regressed ever backwards once they reached adulthood. Now this was a picture, aside from its inherent absurdity, that denied all previous European understanding of Africa and its peoples. Previous European scholars knew that the foundations of European civilization derived from classical Greek civilization. That scholarship further accepted what the Greeks had laid down as patently obvious: that classical Greek civilization derived, in its region, its philosophy, its mathematics and much else, from the ancient civilizations of Africa, above all from Egypt of the Pharaohs. To those 'founding fathers' in classical Greece, any notion that Africans were inferior, morally or intellectually, would have seemed merely silly. (11)\n\nIn a number of his books on Africa, Davidson* has repeatedly pointed out how western historians and writers have deliberately and over centuries twisted Africa's historical facts to support their prejudiced viewpoints about Africa's perceived inferiority. These writers subscribed, from the onset, to the myth of \"hamitic superiority\" based on an imaginary early African people who had a \"white\" morphology which was linked with Caucasian stocks that produced most Europeans. The imagined superiority of hamite over negro � read white over black � has been, and sometimes still is, what Mr. Justice Holmes called \"the inarticulate major premise\". The Hamites were believed to have been more creative and more adaptable than their more inferior negro compatriots.(11)\n\nTime and again the achievements of men in Africa � men of Africa � have been laid at the door of some mysterious but otherwise unexplained \"people from outside Africa\".* Whenever anything remarkable or inexplicable has turned up in Africa, a whole galaxy of non-African peoples are dragged in to explain it. Given such a mind-set, it is no surprise that some Europeans should have tried so desperately to attribute the achievements of African people to non-Africans. The Phoenicians are brought in to explain Zimbabwe; the Egyptians are produced as painters of the \"white lady\" of the Brandberg (Namibia); Greeks or Portuguese are paraded as the inspirers and teachers of those who worked the terracotta and in bronze in medieval west Africa; and Arab colonists are credited with the founding of Swahili cities. (11)\n\nSuch views still had currency in the early 1960s when the gates of a South African prison closed on Nelson Mandela. But when at last he walked free, in 1990, those views were under wide attack even in white South Africa itself. In a crucial restoration of Africa's history, the scholarship of the second half of the twentieth century had proceeded from 'what is near', as al-Buruni recommended a thousand years ago, to 'what is distant', and had done this with such success that a reliable outline of Africa's history was available even for remote times, and with clarity and precision from the fifteenth century onward. And this has proved to be a history of development, of self-development, from one level of achievement to another. (11)\n\nNow, every one of these achievements and phenomena is presented as having a purely African origin. The problems of backwardness and progress � even when and where they really exist � cannot be explained along these simple lines. They cannot be explained along any racial lines. Environment, not race, provides the key. And that is why it will be found that even when African peoples have taken much from outside, at different times and places, their process of borrowing � whether of techniques or beliefs � has always undergone an adaptation, through environment and circumstance, into societies and cultures and civilisations which became specifically and uniquely African. Achievement and failure can be traced to the same complex and endlessly interesting source: the interplay of men and their environment. (11)\n\nNelson Mandela's liberation from prison was received as a moment of affirmation in the record of Africa's history, which has long been one of subjection to foreign powers. It was a moment of celebration of Africa's self-development, of Africa's indigenous history prior to that subjection. Specifically it was a moment to recall that the facts of Africa's own history have always been, and remain, an entirely convincing denial of the mythologies of median racism, in the name of whose lies and legends so many have suffered persecution in South Africa, as in the entire continent. The history of racist persecution is an old one. In a less critical tone, Connah asserts that, quite understandably, African scholars now regard such ideas as the result of blatant racism, but ignorance and stupidity were probably more important. (11)\n\n12. Discarding the Antiquated Racist Mindset\n\nOne of the fundamental problems confronting post-apartheid South African scholars and commentators revolves around the need to look at issues outside the context of apartheid. An impossible task, given the ubiquitous phenomenon that apartheid was and, to a large extent, remains. It is still an unavoidable fact of daily life among all segments of South African society. Caught in the euphoric glare of Africa's 'miracle democracy', black and white South Africans profess � to one another's face at least � that they have rid themselves of apartheid's bad habits. Yet a cursory look at the values of apartheid-bequeathed institutions and South Africans' view of and relations with their continental brothers and sisters contradict these otherwise non-racial surface pronouncements. We argue that, given their recent past history, South African scholars, commentators and observers alike cannot be relied on to conduct scholarly analysis without the risk of being influenced or wrong-footed by views and values that were entrenched � over decades � by an apartheid way of work and life.\n\nOne of the observations made during 1960s by both historians and Africanist scholars including Jahn (7) dealt with the emergence of a post-colonial African elite whose circumstances and values were referred to as 'hybrids' or 'skokians'* which, in reality, are new forms taken neither from the European nor the African tradition. Similarly, in Malinowski's view, all new objects, facts and forms of life in Africa are the results of European pressure and African resistance. Even African nationalism, which invokes and revives an African culture is, according to Malinowski, nothing but 'skokian': the African, he believes, is seduced by the enticements of western civilisation, and accepts new forms of life. His ultimate aim is to be 'if not European, then at least a master or part master of some of the devices, possessions and influences which in his eyes constitute European superiority'.\n\nFanon's (7)explanation is that, psychologically, the majority of Afro-Americans are ill, and he shows how they react to the terrible spiritual pressure placed on them. One group wants to become white, to liberate itself from the burdensome memory that a more highly pigmented skin represents. The others seek their salvation in the acquisition of the African heritage of which they have been deprived. Through an emotional stimulus a conscious step is taken - the first step into neo-African culture. The emotional need, admittedly, is for an intoxicant - 'skokian'- yet when it is voluntarily sought it produces an attitude that is of interest to us here as the approach to neo-African culture.\n\nThe 'living experience of the black' which Frantz Fanon so vividly portrays, exhibits two facts. It is a fact that whites think they are better than blacks. And it is also a fact that blacks want at any price to prove to whites that their thought life is just as rich, their intellect as powerful. As long as one tries to produce this proof by seeking in African culture values which correspond exactly to the standards valid for European culture, one is bound to fail. But if one measures values by the standards proper to African culture, the question of valuation is shown to be falsely put, since there is no universal standard for the evaluation of cultures. According to its own standard - who does not know this? Every culture is superior to every other. (7)\n\n13. Non-Indigenous Informational Sources and Borrowed Skills\n\nAccording to Connah (10) the history of Africa is a neglected subject, not only because the evidence is thin, but also because such a variety of skills is necessary to master what evidence there is. The written sources of African history are in English, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian, Afrikaans, Amharic, Greek, Latin and ancient Egyptian, to name only the most important. The unwritten lore of pre-colonial times must be recovered from peoples speaking some six or seven hundred other languages. This early recognition that the study of the later African past must involve written sources, oral traditions, and the interpretation of archaeological data, is most important. At the brink of the twenty-first century, a surprising number of scholars are still clinging to the concepts of the nineteenth. Static images take a long time to get rid of. Times are changing, however, and it is most encouraging to find evidence of a growing tendency to abandon epochalistic terminology and the concepts that gave rise to it. (10)\n\nAccording to Davidson (11), another legacy of the static image has been the extent to which writers about the later African past have used diffusion from external sources as an explanation for culture change. It would be unrealistic to claim that diffusion did not occur to some extent during the last few millennia in Africa, just as it also occurred in other parts of the world, but it seems most unlikely that it was the major cause of change as was previously thought. It is now being realized that indigenous developments within the African continent were a far more significant factor than external influences, important though these sometimes were. Perhaps also arising from the old static image was a tendency to compartmentalize the later African past. For example, there was the prehistoric past, the ethnohistorical past, the historical past, and the ethnographic 'present' (often at some distance in the past). In the new and more dynamic approach to the later African past, there seems to be a more seamless view of the past. It is nonetheless already possible to know a great deal about African history.\n\nWhether in the field of scientific archaeology, the study of languages or the movement of ideas, the assembly of historical tradition or the elucidation of records written by Africans, Europeans, Asians and Americans, fruitful labour and learning in several countries over the past few decades have produced a large body of explanatory work, and have proved that the writing of African history need be neither the repetition of romantic legend nor the mere listing of faceless names and battles long ago. (11)\n\nThese historical advances have swept away some old myths and established some new truths. The seductively agreeable belief so dear to nineteenth century Europe that all in Africa was savage chaos before the coming of the Europeans may linger here and there but among historians concerned with Africa. The happy conviction of European conquerors that they were bringing civilization to Africans against whom the Gates of Eden had barely closed may still have its adherents, yet not among those who have looked at the evidence. Far from being a museum of barbarism whose populations have stayed outside the laws of human growth and change through some natural failing or inferiority, Africa is now seen to possess a history which demands as serious an approach as that of any other continent. What we now have, more and more clearly, is the moving forth of a broad and vivid process of human development. (11)\n\nIV. ENDURING AFRICAN PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS AND IDEAS\n\nJahn (7) states that after surveying the fifty years of modern African literature, we may say that it began with the rejection of the African tradition and the emphasis on Christianity, but turned further and further away from Christianity, and has now returned to the African way of thinking.\n\n1. The Concept of Africa as an Indivisible, Single Cultural Region\n\nDavidson (11) argues that a rigid dividing of Africa into historical regions can be useful for purposes of detailed study; it will no longer satisfy a balanced view of the past. For while it is true that the Sahara has long placed a barrier between northern Africa and the rest of the continent, and that the great rain forests, further south, have sometimes proved to be a great barrier in relation to central-southern Africa, it is also true that all these regions really belong together, and that what is particular to each of them is general to them all in their foundation and emergence. So there can be little more sense in studying southern Africa in separation from central and northern Africa than in trying to understand northern Europe apart from central and southern Europe. This is not to deny the obvious fact that some of Africa's large regions have developed in ways distinct from the other regions.\n\nMost people tend to view with scepticism the accusation that colonial boundaries have \"balkanised\" Africa. The scepticism is an indication of the extent to which we have imbibed colonial propaganda which portrayed pre-colonial Africa as a collection of isolated tribes, engaged in regular internecine war, and that it was colonialism that \"pacified\" and unified these tribes into the various states of modern Africa. Even otherwise radical critics of colonial rule are inclined to concede, or take for granted, pacification and unification as unquestionable virtues of colonialism. The argument is that colonial rule attempted to break down the isolating walls of tribalism in Africa, that it created larger socio-economic horizons, built roads, bridges, railways and markets, and bequeathed supra tribal states which the postcolonial African leaders were tearing apart through incurable tribalism and sheer ineptitude. On what grounds then do we accuse colonialism of being a divisive force in Africa? Are there any historical bases for claiming a unity of African cultures? (11)\n\nThe study of African history since the end of World War II, culminating in the UNESCO General History of Africa (12), has shown how very misleading the colonial picture is. In place of isolated tribes unified by colonial boundaries, historians now see a pre-colonial Africa in which cultural frontiers, being nowhere factors of human divide, tended to unite rather than divide neighbours all across the continent. That these cultures, through change and adaptation, have proved resilient and are even today, in spite of the colonial boundaries, still exercising a pull towards unity.\n\nThe foundation of African cultural unity lies in the nature of the continent which has provided the geographical context within which African cultures have been formed and developed. Africa provides a number of different ecological zones, with innumerable variations both at local and regional levels. Within each zone, there are variations arising from differences in rainfall, heights, soil formations, human pressure and other factors. These variations over the centuries have facilitated differences in the means and modes of production, and specializations in agricultural produce, crafts, minerals and manufactured goods. These in turn have encouraged exchange, barter and interaction. These varieties of ecological zones have themselves been changing and so have the different African peoples been adapting to the environment and at the same time modifying it in their means and modes of production. (13)\n\nBut it needs to be emphasised that these different zones merge one into the other. There are no insuperable human barriers within the continent. Over the centuries, different channels of communication have been developed linking different parts of the Maghreb with the Nile Valley; the Nile Valley and headwaters of the Nile with Eastern and Central Africa, as with the western Sudan; so also the Maghreb with the western Sudan, and the forest belt of west Africa across the Cameroon mountains with the grasslands and forests of the Congo/Zaire basin, and with Southern Africa. From archaeological and linguistic studies, and the oral traditions of various peoples preserved in group memory and handed down over the ages, we know enough about population movements on the continent to say that the geography of the continent has provided the base for the unity of African cultures. (13)\n\nJ. F. Ade Ajayi (14) Every African group has traditions of origin often involving stories of migration. If these are taken too literally, you will get a false picture of perpetual and unceasing movement of groups which may be just as false as the picture of isolated tribes painted by colonialists. There have also been significant migrations in African history. Similarly we know, largely from linguistic studies, that Bantu languages were originally spoken in the Cross River basin, and that they spread fairly rapidly from there to Central and Southern Africa, largely in the first millennium A.D.\n\nThis spread is associated with population movements due to the rise of iron technology, the planting of new crops, and the spread of new types of cattle. We also know from recorded traditions and linguistic studies about the invasion of Africa by Arab groups from the seventh century onwards, initially as rulers and propagators of Islam. Under the impact of Islam, Arabic language and culture also spread over wide areas of Africa, replacing some earlier languages, and leaving strong semitic influences on others. This immigration of Arabic culture has provided some unities of its own, but has not destroyed the underlying unity of African cultures generally. (14)\n\nAjayi asserts that Africans have rejected the old dichotomy by which anthropologists used to divide African societies into those with states and those without. We understand states to mean sovereign governments within defined boundaries, and we are not aware of any African peoples that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries lacked defined territorial claims or failed to recognise some ultimate sovereign power. The jurisdiction of some states was small, sometimes no larger than a village group or clan; in others the jurisdiction covered wide areas and several peoples. In some, power was centralised in the person of a king or chief, with or without a council; in others, power was diffused with the council of elders, cult priests, lineage heads, heads of age-group associations and other exercising different authorities - in a relatively informal, often democratic manner. (14)\n\nNowhere in Africa were there no authorities deciding war and peace, allocation of land and other economic resources, regulating festivals and other religious matters, marriage and family affairs, markets and so on. Rather than think of states and stateless societies, we should conceive of two models of government at two poles, centralised and non-centralised, with a continuum of patterns of authorities in between. (14)\n\nAccording to the historical development and modes of production in response to the ecology, some centralised states have grown into empires and then collapsed during succession disputes. And dissolved into smaller states maintaining a balance in the competition for land. Other non-centralised states, in periods of prosperity, then perhaps arising from the invention of a new technique or the cultivation of a new crop, expanded their populations and exploited such new technologies to break through the existing balance, dominate their neighbours and establish centralised states with a hierarchy of officials. (14)\n\nFor the majority of African peoples, basic economic life depended on the exploitation of land resources at the local level, and this was effectively managed by authorities within the lineage. Higher authorities provided mainly security in return for tribute. Even in the most centralised of states, power remained comparatively diffused. Most people pursued their economic, social and cultural lives with little interference from \"government.\" Cutting across government were age-grade associations, marriage alliances, long-distance trading and other networks of communications. Sometimes it was not certain whether some particular groups were subject to kings and empires claiming rights over them. Some paid tribute to two rival sovereigns just to buy peace. (14)\n\nWhat we are trying to highlight is that it was not only the geography of Africa, but also the nature of African societies that provided no lines of human divide throughout the continent. The states, kingdoms, empires and peoples never had defined boundaries as such. At any given period, each had territorial claims which it tried to sustain but even these were not static. What existed were cultural frontiers between linguistic groupings, with various other channels of communication and various solidarity contracts cutting across. Thus, when the colonial powers came and were seeking out these frontiers as a basis for establishing colonial boundaries, they had an impossible task. Yet the essential truths and probabilities yielded by research over the past few decades repeatedly insist on two great underlying themes, manifest or hidden, concerning all African development, no matter what the region may be. These themes are unity and continuity of cultural growth among them all, and from an immense depth of time. (14)*\n\n2. Harmony in African Conceptions and Traditional Thought\n\nWhen we say that the traditional African view of the world is one of extraordinary harmony, then except for the word 'African' every single word in the sentence\n\nis both right and wrong. For in the first place the traditional world view is still alive today; secondly it is a question not of a world view in the European sense, since things that are contemplated, experienced and lived are not separable in it; thirdly\n\nit can be called extraordinary only in the European sense, while for the African it is entirely commonplace; and fourth, the expression ' harmony' is entirely inadequate, since it does not indicate what parts are being harmonized in what whole. And if we\n\nsay 'everything' is harmonized, that tells us less than ever. 'Everything' cannot be imagined, nor can we say in a few words what it means. (14)\n\nAdebayo Adesanya (7), a Yoruba writer, found a pretty formulation to characterize briefly the harmony of African conceptions. This is not simply a coherence of fact and faith, nor of reason and traditional beliefs, nor of reason and contingent facts, but a coherence or compatibility among all the disciplines. A medical theory, for example, which contradicted a theological conclusion was rejected as absurd and vice versa. This demand of mutual compatibility among all the disciplines considered as a system was the main weapon of Yoruba thinking. God might be banished from Greek thought without any harm being done to the logical architecture of it, but this cannot be done in the case of the Yoruba.\n\nIn medieval thought, science could be dismissed at pleasure, but this is impossible in the case of Yoruba thought, since faith and reason are mutually dependent. In modern times, God even has no place in scientific thinking. This was impossible to the Yorubas since from the Olodumare an architectonic of knowledge was built in which the finger of God is manifest in the most rudimentary elements of nature. Philosophy, theology, politics, social theory, land law, medicine, psychology, birth and burial, all find themselves logically concatenated in a system so tight that to subtract one item from the whole is to paralyse the structure of the whole.' (7)\n\nThe unity of which Adesanya is speaking here holds not only for Yoruba thought, but presumably also for the whole of traditional thinking in Africa, for African philosophy as such. This systematic unity of views and attitudes that often appear irreconcilable in European terms has indeed been observed by European scholars, but has led to serious misunderstandings. Since it could not be accommodated to European systems of thought, the African way of thinking was considered non-logical. Levy-Bruhl (7) called the attitude of the primitives ' pre-logical' � a term by which he meant to characterize a kind of thought which does not refrain from inner self-contradiction, a kind of thought in consequence of which objects, beings and phenomena can be, in a fashion unintelligible to us, both themselves and at the same time something other than themselves. At the end of his life Levy-Bruhl renounced his theory of 'prelogicism' and thus furnished a rare example of scholarly integrity. In his posthumous notes he asks himself how he could ever have conceived so ill-founded an hypothesis, and he comes to the conclusion that the logical structure of the human mind is the same in all men.\n\nLevy-Bruhl's insight and recantation, however, left a gap. Till then Europeans had been able to subsume whatever was unintelligible to them under such vague headings as 'pre-logical' or, 'mystical'; now there was no longer any system at their disposal to make the unintelligible intelligible to the non-African. So research workers buried themselves in useful investigations of special subjects and avoided every sort of generalization. But now there have appeared a small series of systematic presentations from particular, strictly limited areas, each of which reveals to us the material for and the possibility of seeking their common denominator. (7>)\n\n3. Continuity and Innovation in African Thought\n\nAnother perspective of the historian that needs emphasizing is the dynamic factor in African societies. In the process of earning their living and raising their families, there was not only an ability to interact and exchange but also of constant adaptation and innovation. We need to emphasise this because in the false colonial picture of Africa the tribe was not only isolated but also endowed with an unchanging culture, and therefore without history since change is of the essence of history. Even those who have learnt to accept that African cultures had been changing still insist that European colonialism brought a different order of change. They therefore erect a false dichotomy between Traditional and Modern Africa, with colonial rule marking the dividing line. (14)\n\nSuch a dichotomy is false because it assumes that African societies lost their dynamism on the coming of colonial rule, while ignoring the continuities with the past. In the dialectics of change, we must emphasise not only innovation but also continuity. This is as true of the various changes involved in the population movements referred to above, as in the colonial experience. In every case of revolution, conversion, modernisation, etc, we need to explore what is old, how it has been adapted, and what is entirely new. Thus we find that pre-colonial African cultures have responded to the impasse of colonialism not through extinction, but through adaptation and continuities with remarkable resilience. The perpetual confrontation between the modern and the traditional featured in some novels may be good literature because of the drama involved. It may also represent reality at the personal level, and in the short run. The historical reality must however also emphasise the innumerable compromises and adaptations and conflict resolutions, the dynamic factors which recognise in man, each man, neither traditional nor modern, but just man, a product of history and the constant adaptation and innovation.\n\nIn particular, we need to emphasise that colonialism did not and could not have meant a sudden and complete transference of loyalties, values and expectation from the pre-colonial cultures to the new states. Neither colonialism nor the post-colonial new states have so far succeeded in dissolving ethnicity. The pre-colonial polity, linguistic or cultural group, not the new nations, has remained the basis of solidarity contracts in Africa. This is not to deny that the nature of ethnicity itself has been changing. The definition of what is an ethnic group in each particular case has varied according to the changing needs of those who wish to exploit the ethnic sentiment. What is clear is that the modern state with its precise boundaries, foreign inspired laws and judicial procedures, new basis of election and representation, has so far failed to displace ethnicity in the instinctive loyalties of people.\n\nWhat we call ethnicity or traditional culture, which implies continuities from the past within a dynamic context, has been and remains the instrument of survival from the pressures both of colonial and neo-colonial external factors, as of the injustices and inadequacies of the post-colonial state. Witness the continued vitality of the so-called traditional institutions and how often we have recourse to them in our search for identity and legitimacy, and for channels of communication between the modern state and the masses of the people. Witness also the current revival of traditional religions and cultural values throughout Africa. (14)\n\nThis vitality may be due as much to the resilience of our pre-colonial cultures as to the failings of the modern states; or, more specifically, our failure to recognise this resilience and harness it to our development strategies. In particular, the boundaries of the new states have so far failed to become lines of human divide. As in pre-colonial times, a network of ethnic, social, religious and economic relationships cut across every African boundary. Most of the time, our governments ignore this network. There are no mechanisms for coping with the movement of migrant workers and refugees following pre-colonial channels of communication across the borders. The considerable amount of trade, euphemistically referred to as smuggling or trading in the informal sector, remains a problem for those planning the economy of every African country, currency exchange exercises not excepted. (14)\n\nAjayi states that the argument, here, is not that there is one single African culture. The evidence so far is that in the evolution of man, the transition from hominids to homo sapiens, first took place in Africa. This does not mean that all world cultures resulted from that single breakthrough. The same development could have taken place at a number of other centres. Even in Africa, in the evolution of settled societies in the late Stone Age, several cultures and languages must have evolved. Among the oldest are the Khoisan cultures of Central and Southern Africa. It is still not clear whether the Negro who has now become predominant evolved within Africa or came in from Southeast Asia via Madagascar. But from what we know of developments since historical times, mobility, contact and exchange were far more typical of African cultures than isolation. Similarly, dynamic change and adaptation were more characteristic than the unchanging balance of man and nature pictured in colonial books of anthropology. (14)\n\nThe geography of the continent facilitated mobility, contact and exchange. The nature of African societies was such that cultural frontiers developed more as points of contact between neighbours than as lines of human divide. There thus developed a network of channels and institutions of communication, cutting across political frontiers. This is the historical basis for the unity claimed for African cultures. It is this historical basis and the resilience of pre-colonial African cultures that provide the cultural foundation of possible African unity.
