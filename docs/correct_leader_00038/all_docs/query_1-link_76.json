        "text": "Against a backdrop of post-war turmoil and burgeoning optimism, 1920 embarked on what would become an era etched in history for its extraordinary progress. Amidst this turbulence, a remarkable group of individuals began their journey into the world, destined to leave an impressive mark on various fields and inspire generations to come. A group of trailblazers born in 1920 stepped into a changing world, ready to shape history through their incredible talent and hard work. Their accomplishments not only inspired future generations but also demonstrated how one person's incredible talent could impact the world.\n\nWhen talking about influential musicians, Charlie Parker's innovative jazz compositions can't be overlooked. His improvisational genius brought bebop to life during the '40s and revolutionized the genre forever. Equally groundbreaking within his musical sphere was master sitar player Ravi Shankar. He introduced Indian classical music to Western audiences through mesmerizing collaborations with artists like George Harrison.\n\nFilm enthusiasts would instantly recognize Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini for his one-of-a-kind cinematic creations such as La Dolce Vita. This film continues to be celebrated for its thought-provoking portrayal of societal disillusionment. British director Michael Anderson showcased his knack for storytelling with memorable works like Around The World In Eighty Days, captivating audiences worldwide. Taking a trip down Hollywood’s memory lane, Gene Tierney graced silver screens with her heartwarming performances in films like Laura while leaving moviegoers spellbound with her beauty. Mickey Rooney's spirited presence shone brightly throughout his extensive acting career - from childhood stardom in Boys Town (1938) right up until he passed away in 2014.\n\nThe legacies of these extraordinary individuals serve as a reminder that even amidst challenging times, greatness can emerge and thrive. Their achievements have left lasting impressions on history, entertaining and inspiring countless individuals over time. As they carved their paths within their respective fields, these luminaries forever altered the world as we know it today - a testament that even in times of upheaval, greatness can be cultivated and cherished.\n\nGene Eliza Tierney (November 19, 1920 – November 6, 1991) was an American film and stage actress. Acclaimed as a great beauty, she became established as a leading lady. Tierney was best known for her portrayal of the title character in the film Laura (1944), and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Ellen Berent Harland in Leave Her to Heaven (1945).Tierney's other roles include Martha Strable Van Cleve in Heaven Can Wait (1943), Isabel Bradley Maturin in The Razor's Edge (1946), Lucy Muir in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), Ann Sutton in Whirlpool (1949), Maggie Carleton McNulty in The Mating Season (1951), and Anne Scott in The Left Hand of God (1955).\n\nAge : Dec. at 70 (1920-1991)\n\nBirthplace : Brooklyn, New York, USA\n\nHenry Charles Bukowski (born Heinrich Karl Bukowski; August 16, 1920 – March 9, 1994) was a German-American poet, novelist, and short story writer. His writing was influenced by the social, cultural, and economic ambiance of his home city of Los Angeles. His work addresses the ordinary lives of poor Americans, the act of writing, alcohol, relationships with women, and the drudgery of work. Bukowski wrote thousands of poems, hundreds of short stories and six novels, eventually publishing over 60 books. The FBI kept a file on him as a result of his column Notes of a Dirty Old Man in the LA underground newspaper Open City.Bukowski published extensively in small literary magazines and with small presses beginning in the early 1940s and continuing on through the early 1990s. As noted by one reviewer, \"Bukowski continued to be, thanks to his antics and deliberate clownish performances, the king of the underground and the epitome of the littles in the ensuing decades, stressing his loyalty to those small press editors who had first championed his work and consolidating his presence in new ventures such as the New York Quarterly, Chiron Review, or Slipstream.\" Some of these works include his Poems Written Before Jumping Out of an 8 Story Window, published by his friend and fellow poet Charles Potts, and better known works such as Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame. These poems and stories were later republished by John Martin's Black Sparrow Press (now HarperCollins/Ecco Press) as collected volumes of his work. In 1986 Time called Bukowski a \"laureate of American lowlife\". Regarding Bukowski's enduring popular appeal, Adam Kirsch of The New Yorker wrote, \"the secret of Bukowski's appeal ... [is that] he combines the confessional poet's promise of intimacy with the larger-than-life aplomb of a pulp-fiction hero.\"Since his death in 1994, Bukowski has been the subject of a number of critical articles and books about both his life and writings, despite his work having received relatively little attention from academic critics in America during his lifetime. In contrast, Bukowski enjoyed extraordinary fame in Europe, especially in Germany, the place of his birth.\n\nAge : Dec. at 73 (1920-1994)\n\nBirthplace : Andernach, Germany\n\nFederico Fellini, (Italian: [fedeˈriːko felˈliːni]; 20 January 1920 – 31 October 1993) was an Italian film director and screenwriter. Known for his distinct style that blends fantasy and baroque images with earthiness, he is recognized as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time. His films have ranked, in polls such as Cahiers du cinéma and Sight & Sound, as some of the greatest films of all time. Sight & Sound lists his 1963 film 8½ as the 10th-greatest film of all time. In a career spanning almost fifty years, Fellini won the Palme d'Or for La Dolce Vita, was nominated for twelve Academy Awards and won four in the category of Best Foreign Language Film, the most for any director in the history of the Academy. At the 65th Annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles, he received an honorary award for Lifetime Achievement. Besides La Dolce Vita and 8½, his other well-known films include La Strada, Nights of Cabiria, Juliet of the Spirits, Satyricon, Amarcord and Fellini's Casanova.\n\nAge : Dec. at 73 (1920-1993)\n\nBirthplace : Rimini, Italy\n\nCharles Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920 – March 12, 1955), also known as Yardbird and Bird, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Parker acquired the nickname \"Yardbird\" early in his career on the road with Jay McShann. This, and the shortened form \"Bird\", continued to be used for the rest of his life, inspiring the titles of a number of Parker compositions, such as \"Yardbird Suite\", \"Ornithology\", \"Bird Gets the Worm\", and \"Bird of Paradise\". Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual rather than just an entertainer.\n\nAge : Dec. at 34 (1920-1955)\n\nBirthplace : USA, Kansas City, Kansas\n\nEsther Rolle (November 8, 1920 – November 17, 1998) was an American actress. Rolle is best known for her role as Florida Evans, on the CBS television sitcom Maude, for two seasons (1972–1974), and its spin-off series Good Times, for five seasons (1974–77, 1978–79), for which Rolle was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1976. In 1979, Rolle accepted the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Special: Summer of My German Soldier.\n\nAge : Dec. at 78 (1920-1998)\n\nBirthplace : Pompano Beach, Florida, USA\n\nHelen Amelia Thomas (August 4, 1920 – July 20, 2013) was an American reporter and author best known for her longtime membership in the White House press corps. She covered the White House during the administrations of ten U.S. presidents—from the start of the Kennedy administration to the second year of the Obama administration. Thomas worked for the United Press and post-1958 successor United Press International (UPI) for 57 years, first as a correspondent, and later as White House bureau manager. She then served as a columnist for Hearst Newspapers from 2000 to 2010, writing on national affairs and the White House. Thomas was the first female officer of the National Press Club, the first female member and president of the White House Correspondents' Association and the first female member of the Gridiron Club. She wrote six books; her last, with co-author Craig Crawford, was Listen Up, Mr. President: Everything You Always Wanted Your President to Know and Do (2009). Thomas retired from Hearst Newspapers on June 7, 2010, following controversial comments she made about Jews, Israel, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and her claims that \"Congress, the White House, Hollywood and Wall Street are owned by Zionists\", that led to numerous allegations of antisemitism. She then served as an opinion columnist for the Falls Church News-Press until February 2012.\n\nAge : Dec. at 92 (1920-2013)\n\nBirthplace : Winchester, USA, Kentucky"
