Jim Tucker has spent 25 years reporting on the secretive Bilderberg Group meetings, following them around the United States and Europe. His new book Bilderberg Diary provides the firsthand account of his efforts to shed light on Bilderberg's activities and influence international politics from behind closed doors. Early in his reporting, mainstream media suppressed any news or information about Bilderberg. Tucker established himself as the foremost expert on Bilderberg by procuring their private documents and forcing public scrutiny of their affairs. The book takes readers on a memorable journey through Tucker's experiences covering Bilderberg meetings over 25 years and reveals the secret realities behind their modern-day political influence.",
