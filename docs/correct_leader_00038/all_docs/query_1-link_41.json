Military manpower estimates are as of 1 January 1973 except for average number of males reaching military age, which are projected averages for the 5-year period 1972-76. Military and communications data are as of 1 October 1972 unless otherwise indicated. Most of the land utilization estimates are rough approximations, and most of the statistical data are rounded (thousands and millions). Figures for \"arable\" may reflect only the area actually under crops rather than the potential cultivable. Fishing limits are included only when they differ from the territorial limits. For some countries GDP, rather than GNP, is shown. The difference between the two is in the addition or subtraction of the value of return on foreign investment. GDP equals GNP plus income earned in the country but sent abroad, minus income earned abroad but sent into the country. GDP thus tends to exceed GNP in debtor countries, ip and the reverse is true in creditor countries. Major ports are the largest maritime ports of the country, relative to other ports of the same country, on the basis of estimated port capacity, alongside berthing accommodations, and commercial or naval importance. Minor ports are the remaining ports of a country which have, relative to the major ports, significantly lower estimated port capactiy, fewer alongside berthing accommodations, are of less commercial or naval importance. Major transport aircraft are those weighing over 20,000 pounds. Military budgets are in U.S. dollar equivalents. The dollar sign refers to U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. The abbreviation FY stands for U.S. fiscal year; all years are calendar years unless otherwise indicated.
