Yet, if this work has a political purpose, it is to convince its reader that we as citizens share responsibility with national and European politicians for the unique creature the EU has become. Today, probably more so than twenty years ago, Europeans are rethinking and remaking integration, well aware that in one form or another the EU is here to stay. So, this is an ‘unfinished’ history – the EU is by nature a work-in-progress and we are nowhere near fully understanding its nature. The present book was initially written for university courses for historians, political and social scientists, and students in cognate disciplines. It avoids jargon unknown to a well-informed newspaper reader and tells its ‘unfinished’ story in fewer than 150 pages. All of its contributors lecture on European integration at universities in the Netherlands. The first edition (2013) sought to satisfy the particular demands of two distinct disciplinary worlds: history and political science. Typically, political science textbooks on the EU are precise and systematic in explaining the institutional architecture and theories of integration, but their attention to its history prior to 1979, or even prior to Maastricht, is almost always inadequate. Conversely, even newer historical textbooks often end their narrative with Maastricht and Amsterdam, focussing on leaders and summits to the detriment of institutions and procedures. Our Dutch colleagues have not only encouraged us to take up the gauntlet here, but have also commented on draft chapters and offered answers to intricate EU questions. Meanwhile, five cohorts of students in Amsterdam and Nijmegen, born between the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, have studied the European Union using this textbook; they in turn gave us plenty of feedback, which has helped us to further improve this edition. We are grateful to Kiran Patel, Ann-Christina Knudsen, Jan-Henrik Meyer and other colleagues at home and abroad, who encouraged us to have this textbook published in English and German for the international reader. The original edition of this text ended with Croatia’s accession to the EU in July 2013. To say that much has happened since is a gross understatement. In this updated version, the introduction has been rewritten to take into account new insights, the five chronological chapters have been updated where necessary, and a sixth chapter on new developments in the EU since 2013 has been added, ending with the first year of formal Brexit negotiations. The chronology and bibliography were updated to 2017 as well.\n\n8\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nThe original project for a Dutch textbook on EU history owes much to Marc Beerens of Vantilt Publishers in Nijmegen, who was the first to embrace our aspirations and, together with his editors, helped to turn them into an elegant book. The same goes for the Faculty of Arts at Radboud University in Nijmegen and its History Department. Their financial support helped us to translate the enthusiasm of the initial brainstorm into a fully-fledged book manuscript, for the original Dutch edition and again for the present English edition and the concise German version (published by Dietz Verlag in Bonn, in cooperation with the Bundeszentrale für Politische Bildung). The Pademia Award for outstanding teaching on parliamentary democracy in Europe 2016 additionally motivated us to reconvene for updated editions in English and German. Thanks to the professionalism and commitment of Amsterdam University Press and editor Rixt Runia, the complex process of updating, translating and editing was completed in less than a year, from the publishing contract to the bookstore shelves. Special thanks go to our assistants Dana van Beurden and Joske Dekkers in Nijmegen for painstakingly compiling the large bibliography and other annexes, as well as for generating the multipurpose index. We are greatly indebted to John Eyck (New York) and Amanda Getty (Los Angeles) who proofread the English manuscript. Needless to say, we are solely responsible for the imperfections that inevitably remain. Due to its complex institutional and procedural architecture and the political imbroglio of its seven-decade history, the European Union is a challenging subject for a textbook. We hope that we have succeeded in presenting to the reader both less and more than a plethora of historical and contemporary facts and institutional idiosyncrasies: Less, by being highly selective in which events, names and events we chose to include in the text as an introduction to the European Union; and more, by offering context to historical events and a systematic analysis of the institutional architecture. We have succeeded in our mission if the reader finds the seven ‘eternal’ strategic dilemmas of the integration process, the central theme of this book, useful in making sense of day-to-day media reporting on Europe. We welcome comments and suggestions by students and faculty for an updated edition that will certainly be due in a few years’ time, given the pace of European politics today.

Predictably, now that the EU is for the first time in its history witnessing a decline in membership, pamphlets proffering sweeping verdicts on Brussels are very much in vogue. The authors of this book, however, believe that recent developments should be met with fresh study into the past and present functioning of the EU and the long-term dynamics of European integration. After all, today’s uncertainties and controversies over the future of the European Union not only impact our reading of the present, as is visible in Brexit and the consequent soul-searching of the remaining 27. Current problems require a revisiting of the historical past. Events like Brexit or the migration crisis motivate historians to review historical crossroads in integration history, which is all too often reduced to unilinear progress. The impact of external structural forces such as climate change or conflict in the Middle East, the autonomous power of grand concepts – federalist aims, monetary union – and the motives of political agents both within and outside the Union are all being re-evaluated and scrutinized anew. This textbook responds to the demand to revisit the past on two levels. First, in the central chronological chapters, the authors present their versions of a consolidated, uncluttered narrative of European integration. Whereas some of the nuance and alternative perspectives suggested by recent scholarly work may find their way into these chapters, much more of this is offered in the thematic sections that are presented separately. Here, students will find that the challenging of the well-known grand narrative of integration history opens up new vistas for term papers, while the general reader will see how, through new interpretations of past events, political spice is added to present controversies. As a consequence of today’s turmoil, any presentation or interpretation of the history of European integration, no matter how academic or impartial, is inevitably perceived as a public statement weighing in as pro- or anti-Brussels by those championing re-nationalization, a federalist future, a two-speed Europe or an avalanche of national exits. As the reader of older textbooks on European integration will find, the classic narrative of European integration was one of optimism and progress – European integration as an incremental development towards an ever-closer union. In this model, intricacies and tensions, such as the stagnation of the seventies for instance, are reduced to temporary setbacks and decisions made prematurely. The terms ‘cul-de-sac,’\n\n10\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nfor the aborted plans for a European Defence Community in the fifties, and ‘relaunch’ for Europe’s new ambitions thereafter, testify to this perspective. Today, the forced optimism of such a historical perspective has gone. By all appearances, this artificially-confident narrative has been replaced by an equally dominant negative one. While the optimistic view transformed any past decision into another step towards European federalism, the pessimistic view anachronizes present controversies, such as the democratic deficit, to the founding decades of the European Communities. In these Eurosceptical accounts just as in the classical narrative, the constraints of historical context are woefully ignored as the (controversies of) today’s reality are projected onto the past. This book is neither an uncritical panegyric nor a vituperative attack on European integration. Instead, the mission of The Unfinished History of European Integration is to unpack the inherent tensions in the concepts and realities of EU history. With the help of the seven ‘strategic dilemmas’ below, we aim to debunk both the narrative of the inexorable deepening of integration as well as the counter-narrative of ‘we the citizens versus Brussels.’ The attentive reader will encounter these dilemmas time and again as the chequered life story of Europe unfolds in the chapters that follow. They highlight structural contextual factors, question idealistic motives, identify ambiguities in citizens’ expectations and historicize the European project. This exercise neither attempts to proselytize die-hard Eurosceptics nor disconcert staunch believers in an ever closer union. It may, however, provide orientation to all other readers in the arcane and unfinished story of European integration.\n\nBuilding Europe: Seven Dilemmas Throughout the chronological narrative of the European Union, seven ‘strategic dilemmas’ will help to identify continuity and change in the more than 70 years of its history. The seven dilemmas may be divided into two categories. Four concern conflicts over competencies and responsibilities: Who shapes Europe? The other three relate to the ideals and objectives of the integration process: What should a united Europe be? All seven are permanent issues in the process of European integration. Their relative importance, however, changes over time. The first dilemma is the one most acutely felt today – citizens versus states. From the very beginning, the EU has represented both member states and European citizens. Tellingly, each member state has its own European\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n11\n\nCommissioner as well as one representative in the European Council or the Council of Ministers. The weight of a minister’s vote, however, depends on the size of his or her country’s population. Seats in the European Parliament are allocated more or less proportionally to the number of citizens of each member state. Some federalists have gone so far as to suggest that citizens should be able to vote for MPs from any member state. A citizens’ initiative requires one million signatures from eight countries. More than any one of the other dilemmas, citizens versus states is inherent to the very process of European integration and is indissoluble. The next dilemma – intergovernmentalism versus supranationalism – is on the other hand often construed as a binary choice, with the European Union wavering from one extreme to the other. Throughout the decades, both politicians and analysts have used these two terms as a measure to assess any strategic proposal as a choice for ‘more’ Europe, or ‘less.’ Realities and ideals have thus evolved around these terms. Fischer’s Humboldt speech in 2000 was both hailed and denounced as a supranational endeavour. Half a century earlier, the same qualifications shaped the debate over direct elections for a European Parliament. The transfer of sovereignty to Brussels is real, but observers should be aware that these terms are political weapons as well. A third dilemma, often eclipsed by the aforementioned tension between Europe as a whole and individual nation states, concerns the division of labour between Europe and the world as a whole. Those who focus on Europeanization tend to forget the parallel process of globalization. Within the expanding Union, the deepening of integration, encompassing ever more policy fields, has led to demands for re-nationalization and a curtailing of European policymaking competencies. In many fields, however, the question is whether Europe has the size and power to cope with key challenges. Environmental issues, terrorism and financial markets respect neither the borders of nation states nor the outer borders of the European Union. On a slightly different note, the fourth dilemma pertains to the tension between external relations and the domestic affairs of Europe. For most of its existence the European Union has enjoyed a relatively comfortable position in this respect. On the one hand, Brussels has only had EU member states to take into account in setting incremental steps towards enhanced cooperation in (new) policy fields. On the other hand, Brussels has been free to define its own ambitions vis-à-vis neighbouring regions and countries. For a long time, the constellation produced by the Cold War and the Iron Curtain freed Brussels from extensive dealings with neighbours and Union applicants to the east. After the fall of communism, Europe was the only game in town and the single prospective future for more than a dozen countries. All this\n\n12\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nhas changed in recent years, with Turkey and Russia offering alternatives to countries in Europe’s periphery (and even within the Union) and building their own spheres of influence. Furthermore, both external and domestic tensions have become entangled in critical challenges like Eurosceptical populism, the Syrian and Ukrainian conflicts and, most importantly, the issue of refugees and migrants. The fifth dilemma of the intertwined dynamics of deepening and enlargement is associated with the fourth. Since the eighties, consecutive rounds of enlargement have tended to coincide with reforms of the European Union. Some have argued that the EU ought to decide on treaty reforms, modified institutional arrangements and major new policies well in advance of the next round of enlargement, as each round taxes political energy and makes consensus harder to come by. Conversely, others have argued that EU member states need the time pressure and the tangible problems that emerge from the accession of yet more nation states to garner the political will needed to overcome deadlock. Like the fifth, the sixth dilemma concerns the very ideal of Europe. In their strong reliance on technical expertise and the reconciliation of conflicting political and societal interests, the European Communities reveal their origins in the early post-war decades. The High Authority, the European Commission(s), the European Economic and Social Committee and the Court of Justice are cases in point. The rationale of output legitimacy, wherein the European project is validated through the products of its legislative work for all states and citizens, is akin to Monnet’s functionalism. In recent decades, the power of the directly elected European Parliament has increased and demands for more citizen participation are louder than ever. Partly due to the EU’s sheer size and complex nature as a union of both states and citizens, European politics bear few similarities to the politics of a national polity, the obvious point of reference. Europe’s Parliament is not driven by the dynamics of coalition and opposition, and plenary debates fail to enthuse what little European public sphere exists as a consequence. That said, not unlike in national politics today, the public’s conflicting demands for the politicization of policy decisions and for de-politicization as an alternative to much-detested politicking, coexist. The seventh dilemma is a classic, on par with intergovernmentalism versus supranationalism: Is Europe a solid community based on solidarity and shared values or norms? Or is Europe an ephemeral collusion of national interests that is perpetually re-negotiated? Thatcher’s ‘I want my money back’ and the endless debates over the costs and benefits for net contributors to the EU’s budget strongly suggest the latter. The recent euro crisis\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n13\n\nand the transfer of billions to Southern Europe have strained the ideal of European solidarity to breaking point. Brexit has arguably demonstrated to most other members the risks and limits of such a utilitarian perception of the EU. If the EU is accepted as legitimate only in its capacity to solve cross-border problems that require collective action, but is mistrusted or even rejected outright for all other policy issues, disintegration may be the result. In non-monetary terms, Turkey, Poland and Hungary have triggered recent debates on inalienable European values with their controversial reforms of constitutional and media laws, much like issues of war guilt and reconciliation in the Balkan countries or the status of non-nationals in the Baltic states.\n\nUnderstanding Europe: Analytical Challenges As these seven dilemmas demonstrate, for those in Brussels and in national capitals attempting to manage European integration, this process is one of avoiding myriad pitfalls and often choosing between two evils. Hindsight is the advantage of historians, who reflect on strategic choices made in the past and their unintended consequences. Those writing the history of this process at the present time, however, find themselves facing challenges of their own. A survey like this book, which aims to contribute to both the history and political science disciplines, to be at the same time innovative and classic, both narrative and systematic, cannot escape hard choices in its set-up and selection of topics. Perhaps surprisingly, historians are latecomers to the field of EU studies. Prior to the nineties, historical studies on the European Communities in any language of the founding six were few and far between. In the first post-war decades and the early years of European integration, historians were focused predominantly on high politics and national politics; the European treaties and Communities were discussed only on the periphery. Academic disciplines other than history – political science and legal studies in particular – dominate the scholarly literature on the more than half century of EU history. Legal scholars above all are interested in the formal ‘reality’ of European treaties, institutional architecture and decision-making procedures. Political scientists with a background in international relations view the EU as an intergovernmental organization, whereas their colleagues in comparative politics take the supranational position of Brussels as their point of departure. Interpreting long-term processes and informal interactions beyond the institutional and procedural formalities may provide the\n\n14\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nhistorian’s in. The discipline’s attention has recently shifted from the high politics of key figures, conferences and treaties to a more structural and embedded history of European integration as a complex and multi-faceted process, rather than a simple chain of events. Conversely, the multifaceted character of the EU itself and the disciplinary plurality of European Studies, including economists and sociologists as well, are far beyond the competencies of even a large team of authors. The required conciseness of an introductory textbook thwarts ambitions to present an innovative perspective on the European Union in several respects. No textbook can make do without discussion of quite a number of key actors, conferences, treaties, institutions and other ‘memorabilia’ from high politics. Societal actors and processes, rather than the eventoriented institutions of low politics, are by default subordinated in such a historical overview. Similarly, the authors are acutely aware of the risk of teleological bias in examining incremental progress from early ideals and ambitions to institutional fruition and membership extension. High politics is particularly prone to omitting alternative options, roads not taken and unfinished projects. Finally, one of the major drawbacks of most EU history writing cannot be remedied here – its de-contextualization. Political events of the Cold War, economic issues such as oil crises or societal trends such as citizens’ disenchantment with politics, national and European, cannot be fully and systematically integrated. The systematic and comprehensive bibliography for both generic and thematic studies of European integration since the turn of the century, at the end of this textbook, is intended as a resource for further reading for the student writing a thesis or term paper on the European Union.\n\nAn Unfinished History Seldom has the direction of European integration been as uncertain as it is now, including as it does the possibility of disintegration. For that reason – and contrary to the customary practice of textbooks and the intuition of historians – the authors have updated this text as late as the publication process would allow. The manuscript was finished in December 2017, in total covering nine decades of European history, from Briand to Brexit. The authors have opted to first relate the classic historical narrative of European integration in each chapter. Additionally, the first five chapters each include three sections to supplement the historical narrative and the institutions under discussion. The ‘Theory and Historiography’ section\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n15\n\nintroduces paradigms in the development of integration theory in political science, as well as schools of thought in historiography, within the particular temporal context of the chapter, offering further consideration and elaboration of the time period discussed. The ‘The Other Europe’ section offers selected topics concerning political and institutional actors within the integration process that are often disregarded in the classic narrative of high politics. Finally, the section ‘From the Sources’ attends to specific categories of sources and introduces basic skills for using them analytically. The latter sections in particular aim at classroom use, providing introductory-level students with practical starting points for their own research projects. More general readers with a primary interest in the historical narrative can easily leave these sections aside. Alternatively, those who have sufficient prior knowledge of institutions and history can study these three sections alone as well – each is varied and comprises approximately 30 pages. The historical narrative of the European Union is divided into six phases, each with their own central topics that follow both from the experiences of the politicians and citizens for whom European integration is a lived reality, and from the analyses of political scientists, historians and others. As discussed in the first chapter, which ends with the Treaty of Rome (1957-58), the relation of politicians and citizens to the grand ideals of the federalists took centre stage in these initial years, and tensions between normative ideals and political pragmatism is discernable in the work of early EU theoreticians and historians. As Chapter 2 describes, the subsequent era – lasting until the first expansion of the EU in 1973 – witnessed the consolidation of political power relations in the new Europe, the result of struggle between the larger and smaller member states and between member states and European institutions. This highly political and critical phase too had its impact on the development of theory and resulted in a more cynical perspective on the part of historians. In the third phase, from 1973 to 1985, which is covered by Chapter 3, both the successes and the conflicts in Europe were more economic than political in nature. Around 1980, the economy was increasingly foregrounded, both in the historical narratives and in the academic search for the driving force behind the integration process. As Chapter 4 demonstrates, it was not until the leadership of Jacques Delors and Jacques Santer (1985-99) that the political centre once located in the national capitals began to shift to Brussels. The question was no longer whether Europe would increasingly take the lead in policymaking, but how. Historians, political scientists, sociologists and public administration experts likewise began to focus their attention to an increasing extent on the functioning of the EU as a new, unique political system with an\n\n16\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nunprecedented number of policy fields and levels of governance. Consequently, as thematized in Chapters 5 and 6, there is but one question left that interests citizens, politicians and academics alike in the twenty-first century. In many respects, even the euro crisis is derivative of this issue. How do we identify European democracy and its deficiencies? Both in Brussels and in the national capitals the need for a more participatory and representative democracy for the increasingly unpopular European Union is more and more at odds with the need for pragmatic crisis management, including tough measures for saving the euro and coping with the influx of refugees. Each chapter in this textbook introduces the reader to major theoretical perspectives on European integration in their historical context. After all, theory not only explains the process of integration, but often has a normative function as well, indicating how politics and integration ought to operate. It has influenced the goals and strategies pursued in politics. The development of theory concerning European integration in political science can be described as a succession of schools of thought, which have at their core new questions and lines of inquiry; these questions, as well as their answers, are directly related to the ups and downs of the integration process itself and its perceived character. During the first two decades of European integration, most studies offered explanatory models as to why national governments were willing to transfer sovereignty to an international organization. The integration crisis of the sixties and seventies affirmed the theory of neorealism or intergovernmentalism, which approaches the hybrid EC/EU above all from the perspective of international relations. In the earlier optimistic phase federalists and (neo)functionalists had viewed the (unique) dynamics of European integration with much more confidence, but with the same ‘Why?’ question in mind. As states were transferring competences, a new line of inquiry came to light. From the perspective of comparative politics, the how concerning joint European policymaking could now be hashed out, with a focus on Brussels as a new and unique political system. Since the eighties, a third question has also arisen: In whose name has this Europeanization taken place? Alongside the administrative ‘How?’ the need for democratic legitimacy and public support for policymaking became a matter of increasing concern, both at European and national levels. The discussion of constructivism – e.g. the ‘national interest’ as a public and political construct, includes democratic and non-democratic forms of influence and the formation of public opinion. In the historiographical sections, it becomes clear that history writing does not allow for such clear division in schools of thought or for such inflexible coupling of developments in the integration process itself. By virtue\n\nIntroduc tion\n\n17\n\nof the heterogeneity of the discipline and the sources they use, historians are less inclined to choose a theoretical or methodological school explicitly. Additionally, the requirement of a certain temporal distance and the need for lengthy and labour-intensive archival research mean an inevitable delay before there can be any talk of well-defined conceptualizations among historians. However, with a bit of persistence, the pattern in political science texts described above is also recognisable in history texts on the EU. Until well into the seventies, historians showed little interest in the process of European integration. Following the German expert Walter Lipgens, their work focussed above all on Europe as an idea and an ideal, with a clearly normative bias. Just as neo-functionalism emphasises the ‘spill-over’ effects from optimistic visions of the future, these historians concentrated on the power of the European idea and its advocates. For most historians (just as for the intergovernmentalists among the political scientists), the new communities maintained ‘business as usual’ – a particular form of multilateral relations between sovereign states. Diplomatic history and archival research was the preview of classic political history in this regard. In view of the fact that most archive legislation provides for access to official documents only after thirty years, it was not until the eighties that studies based on internal negotiation documents could be performed. These tended to emphasize national interests, though attention did shift from international diplomatic history to decision-making and positions taken within each member state. Even as an innovator in archival research, Alan Milward and his famous The European Rescue of the Nation State from 1992 still fits within this realistic school of historiography, in terms of its economic angle and the attention Milward paid to the European Economic Community. The rise of new approaches to political history in the past twenty or thirty years – from conceptual history to the history of policy fields, from political culture to neo-institutionalism – has also impacted the history of European integration. Just like the development of theory in political science, ideas of a fixed national interest and the state as the (only) arbitrator between its citizens and Europe have grown obsolete as points of departure. In conjunction with the concept of multilevel governance since Maastricht, historians have recently begun to concentrate on European policy development, decision-making and implementation at national level. Similarly, since the nineties the public and political debate has drawn academic attention to the democratic deficit of the European Union. Whereas governance and policy history focus above all on the output of (democratic) policymaking, other historians (together with the constructivists) are interested in forms of representation, advocacy and participation at national and European levels.\n\n18\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nIn each chapter that follows, the sections ‘The Other Europe’ and ‘From the Sources’ discuss those skills, sources and issues that make innovative contributions to advanced studies concerning the history of integration. New approaches are key to the selected topics, which address historical moments or actors that have remained underexposed from the classic perspective of international relations and the historical narrative sections of this book. As such aspects and actors are numerous, the selected topics (more than elsewhere in the book) bear the signature of the respective authors of the chapters. In ‘The Other Europe,’ European officials, the European Court of Justice, European political parties, interest groups, lobby organizations and think tanks and finally the European Central Bank are highlighted. In ‘From the Sources,’ approaches to different source types are discussed not only on the basis of practical examples but also systematically, including discussions of methodological pointers and pitfalls. Again aiming for the greatest possible variation of the most relevant categories, the sources discussed in these sections vary greatly, from memoirs and other autobiographical documents to national archives, the Eurobarometer surveys, treaties and finally European policy documents. For those who read critically between the lines, these sources yield valuable information concerning underlying conflicts of interest and institutional turf wars. The reader will explicitly and implicitly encounter the seven strategic dilemmas time and again as the story unfolds in The Unfinished History of European Integration. The analytical challenges are the sole responsibility of the authors. In this respect, the book is a balancing act. It offers a concise narrative of the key actors, events, institutions and treaties in the history and current reality of the European Union. It has been written with the general reader in mind and requires little or no prior knowledge, but offers some additional assistance for secondary school teachers and students in higher education. Finally, students writing a paper or thesis on an EU-related topic may find this book a welcome reference for the historical and institutional basics, a hub for the multidisciplinary and inexhaustible academic literature on the EU, as well as a toolbox of analytical skills.

Today’s awareness of the problems, successes and failures in the integration process over the ensuing decades hinders an evaluation of the EU’s predecessors such as the ECSC. National interests, as well as the pressure of the Cold War present at its founding, cannot allow either the daring or the European idealism of these initial European institutions to be forgotten. Caution is quite advisable, then, when evaluating the ‘visionary thinkers’ of the nineteenth century and the interwar years. The supranational European integration after the Second World War, in which national governments put themselves under a higher European authority in specific policy areas, would to a significant extent come about as the consequence of the experience of that war, under the pressure of international developments. Yet there are substantial similarities between the foresight of these ‘visionary thinkers’ and subsequent European integration. The combination of economic integration and the promotion of prosperity, on the one hand, and peace in Europe, on the other, is but one example. Other recurring elements include the conviction that European institutions might create a sense of a shared European destiny as well as the perceived need for European unity in order to give Europe weight in world politics.\n\nEuropean Cooperation Before the Second World War If there was ever any talk of cooperation and unity in (part of) Europe in past centuries, then it was seldom based on any grand design. Sometimes the circumstances obliged political leaders to cooperate economically or militarily. At other times unity was the consequence of wars motivated by economic gain or power politics. Occasionally, plans were made for peaceful, unforced political or economic integration – literally the fusion of parts into a greater whole. Some of these plans and initiatives were intended as mere means to promote economic prosperity; for others, European political unity was the ultimate goal. Between these ‘functional’ and ‘idealist’ plans, however, no hard and fast dividing line can be drawn. Claude-Henri de Rouvroy, count of Saint-Simon, was one of the important early thinkers of European political unification. In October 1814, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars and on the eve of the Congress of Vienna, he drew\n\n22\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nup a sketch for a united Europe. It was intended for the parliaments of the United Kingdom and France. As a start, those countries were supposed to set up a joint parliament. Other European countries could join this Europe yet in the making, provided they abolished their absolutist monarchies. Eventually, this future Europe should include the German nation. According to Saint-Simon, this nation – in view of the size of their population and the area it inhabited in the heart of Europe – would irreversibly acquire a leading role in Europe in the long term. Striking similarities exist between Saint-Simon’s ideas and the character of European integration after the Second World War. He advocated an ordered, planned collaborative society with ‘men of outstanding merit’ leading the way. Other similarities between his plan and the European Union included a social peace between the haves and the have-nots as well as an emphasis on economic rationalization. The integration of Europe that led to the European Union is often associated with perpetual peace among the countries in Europe. This idea was not foreign to Saint-Simon either. Whereas some thinkers from the beginning of the nineteenth century saw rivalry among the states of Europe either as the reason why European countries set out to explore and colonize the world, or as a source of vitality and strength, Saint-Simon saw disunity in Europe as a weakness instead. Just as in the EU later on, in Saint-Simon’s plans nation states were to keep their own parliaments. At the European level, however, accommodation was made for a representative body made up of the educated professional classes in Europe. People were shaped by their institutions, according to Saint-Simon, and this kind of a European ‘parliament’ would lead to a European harmonization of interests and even to European patriotism. Following Saint-Simon, many thinkers in the nineteenth century developed ideas on future European cooperation. This situation is remarkable, because the nineteenth century is generally seen as the century of nationalism and national unification. However, some nationalists like Giuseppe Mazzini – a champion of the pursuit of Italian unity in the nineteenth century – saw the ideal of cooperating European nations as an extension of their pursuit of national unification, equality and fraternity. Unlike the optimistic plans for Europe in the nineteenth century, the plans for Europe in the interwar years were driven by intensely felt political and economic crisis. At the beginning of the twentieth century, large parts of the world were ruled by European colonial powers. The First World War brought a relative decline in their position of power and marked the economic ascent of the United States. This first modern war with its\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n23\n\nmillions of dead and inhuman trench warfare was also perceived as a deep crisis for European civilization and damaged the self-esteem of Europe’s political elites. Such feelings of doom and crisis were intensified by the communist seizure of power in Russia in 1917, and by the fear that this ideology and Soviet influence would spread to Central and Western Europe. After the First World War, more and more trade restrictions were introduced by nation states to protect their own economies. After the war, the global market in the agriculture sector witnessed a sharp fall in the price of food crops, specifically grain. During the war grain production had increased markedly in the United States, Canada and Argentina – as had exports to the European market – Central Europe’s own production shrank as a result of the warfare. When European production again reached its pre-war capacity after the end of the war, an oversupply arose. Beginning in the summer of 1921, a crisis ensued. After the First World War, new hope for preserving peace was placed in the League of Nations – a global organization that was supposed to effect peace among the nations of the world – established at the initiative of the United States. The division of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (as a loser of the war) into smaller states was in accordance with the League of Nations’ initial ideal of national self-determination. The initial concept of the League of Nations for peace and cooperation was thwarted, however, by the draconian conditions for peace that the United Kingdom and France placed upon Germany. As the main culprit of the war, Germany had to make enormous reparations by way of the Treaty of Versailles. After the First World War, the Austro-Japanese count Richard Nicolaus Coudenhove-Kalergi, a fervent anti-communist, had initially been an enthusiastic propagandist for the League of Nations. Yet, he gradually became disappointed in this organization. In response to the sense of crisis in Europe, he published his famous book Pan-Europa in 1923. The book put forward a plan for the political and economic unification of Europe. ‘Europeans’ like Coudenhove-Kalergi actually considered the unity of Europe as a second-best option, because the League of Nations was not functioning well. Just as in Saint-Simon’s plan and the later European Communities, Coudenhove-Kalergi’s plan was based on ideas about peace among the nations of Europe as well as socioeconomic peace between capital and labour. In Pan-Europa Coudenhove-Kalergi elaborated a vision for the future. From his point of view, the European tendency toward ‘Kleinstaaterei’ (territorial fragmentation) was at odds with the increase in size of the four global power blocs of the future (Pan-America, the British Empire, the\n\n24\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nSoviet Union and the Far East). Compared to the size of these empires, a fragmented Europe could not hold its own, in spite of its colonies in Africa, South-America, Indochina and Indonesia. In Coudenhove-Kalergi’s eyes, the European continent, together with these colonies, would have to form one large economic entity without internal tariff barriers. It was relatively easy to fit French ‘Eurafrica’ into this project. However, a Dutch economic free trade policy in Indonesia had resulted in extensive trade between the Dutch East Indies and the extra-European world, especially the United States. The interests of Dutch colonial enterprises could not easily be reconciled with the building up of tariff walls around the borders of Pan-Europe. Pan-Europe would have to develop a strongly regulated economy. PanEuropean agriculture and industry had to be protected from cheap imported products. In the area of agriculture, Pan-Europe would even have to become self-sufficient. The assumption that larger economic entities would lead to better coordination of economic production and more mass production constituted the core of his thinking. European economic unity would lead to rationalization, an increase in production and lower prices. As a consequence, prosperity would increase and become more widespread. The ‘class struggle’ between the propertied class and the workers would be prevented by European unity. And communism would lose its appeal. Poverty, after all, was the breeding ground for communism. In the 1920s, the problems caused by the peace treaties after World War I, seemed to be solved. This situation induced the French statesman Aristide Briand to bring forth the 1930 Briand Memorandum, which contained a plan for European cooperation within the framework of the League of Nations. Much like in the League of Nations, his plan envisioned complete sovereignty for the affiliated countries. Although the plan did mention a common market, for Briand peace among the great European powers came first. Institutions of the envisioned cooperation were a European conference with representatives from the national governments, a permanent political committee as an executive body for the conference, and a secretariat. The plan did not arouse much enthusiasm in Germany or the United Kingdom. Germany read it as a French attempt to consolidate its own position of power in Europe. The British felt the same way and were more focussed on their empire outside Europe than on the European continent anyway. Economically speaking, the times were unfavourable for the plan too. After the October 1929 Stock Market Crash, a worldwide economic crisis had broken out, which led to nation states embracing economic protectionism. When the National Socialists came to power in Germany in 1933, all hope for cooperation in Europe evaporated.\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n25\n\nThe League of Nations also constituted the point of departure for another European initiative for economic cooperation. In order to fight the economic crisis, the League of Nations was pursuing the reduction of barriers to international trade. In December 1930, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg signed the so-called ‘Oslo Convention’ to that end. In this rather modest trade agreement, no increase in existing import tariffs without prior consultation and no promulgation of new duties unilaterally and without prior consultation, were stipulated. The Oslo countries wanted to set a good example in trade policy for the major European powers. As the United Kingdom and other countries refused to join, their objective shifted to the expansion of trade among members of the agreement instead. In July 1932, three Oslo countries (the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) concluded the more ambitious Ouchy Convention. The goal was the phased reduction of tariffs among the signatories. Existing import duties would not be raised, nor would new ones be introduced. The agreement, which was intended as the first step towards a customs union in Europe, was open to accession by the Oslo states and other countries on an equal footing. Yet, after the United Kingdom rejected this convention, too, and allowed its imperial trade interests to prevail over continental trade, hope for liberalising European trade disappeared. A 1933 attempt by the League of Nations to put an end to increasing national protectionism in international trade by organising an economic world conference failed as well. Nor was this economic nationalism limited to the protection of one’s own market against products from aboard. One by one, countries proceeded to devalue their own currencies vis-à-vis those of their trading partners, which made their own exports cheaper. Some countries even ‘dumped’, selling their products onto the markets of their trading partners at rock-bottom prices in order to ruin competition from those countries. The memory of this economic warfare during the 1930s was the most significant economic motivation for a common market in Western Europe after the Second World War. In the second half of the 1930s, the Oslo states put themselves to the political task of international detente among the major European powers. Nobody suspected these smaller countries of pursuing territorial expansion or dominance in Europe. Attempts at detente proved to be fruitless, however, and the economic advantages of the agreement, became increasingly meagre for the Member States. At the end of the 1930s, there was barely any talk of cooperation among the Oslo states.\n\n26\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nHitler’s New Order and the Federalist Europe of the Resistance In the end, plans and initiatives for cooperation and unity in Europe all broke down as a result of the unwillingness of the national states before the Second World War. European cooperation in and of itself had often been a second option, after worldwide cooperation for the sake of peace or free trade failed in the League of Nations. Hitler’s Nazi Germany would have nothing of either the League of Nations, or Coudenhove-Kalergi’s Pan-Europa. According to the Nazis, it was not peoples but governments that created these artificial institutions. To them, moreover, Coudenhove-Kalergi’s Pan-Europa was the overture to global capitalism, while they pursued a Europe under German leadership that would be independent of imports from the rest of the world. In spite of their objections to Pan-Europa, the Nazi leaders championed a European vision of their own. Albert Speer – a key economic figure in Hitler’s Third Reich during the Second World War – had wanted to create an organization similar to the ECSC in terms of economic goals (albeit an undemocratic version). As the dominant power on the European continent, Nazi Germany propagated European economic cooperation in a ‘Großraumwirtschaft’ (‘bloc economy’). On 25 July 1940, for example, the German minister for Economic Affairs presented a financial plan for a multilateral ‘clearing’ of assets and debts in territories under German rule: when the balance of trade between two countries was out of balance, the assets and shortages would thenceforth no longer be calculated ‘bilaterally’ but rather ‘multilaterally’ among all the countries participating. Thus, currency restrictions for mutual trade between these countries could be downsized, which would intensely simplify trade with one another. The plan resembled the European Payment Union subsequently created in August 1950. In Nazi Germany, many farther-reaching plans were considered, such as a customs union with free movement of capital, but these plans were not a priority for the political leadership. National Socialism was primarily geared towards the military conquest of territory for the German ‘Herrenvolk’ (‘master race’) in Poland and (from June 1941 onwards) in the Soviet Union. The National Socialist plans for an economic ‘Großraum’ in Western and Central Europe were a façade for economic exploitation by Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, some institutions in Nazi Germany as well as a few authorities in the occupied territories believed in a new economic Europe under German leadership. Among these ‘believers’ were many non-Nazis as well. To them these plans constituted the first step toward economic unification on the European continent. Many hoped that\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n27\n\nthe Hitler regime would be pushed aside by more moderate forces from the German army after the passage of time, so that the fall of the Nazis would not be followed by the collapse of Germany. Such a collapse, in their mind, would open the door to a Soviet invasion of Europe. Because of the German hegemony that existed on the continent in 1941 and 1942, the organized German resistance against Hitler was compelled to develop a vision for Europe. There had to be a plan for the occupied territories, once Hitler was pushed aside. Carl Goerdeler, the new chancellor the German resistance had in mind, hoped for a unification of the European people against Soviet communism. In 1941 he foresaw a future European league of states under German leadership. Even though he was still thinking of a separate German Wehrmacht at that moment, a year later he was a proponent for creating a European army. The leaders of the Kreisau Circle, a Christian-social resistance group, wanted to turn the economic exploitation of the National Socialists into economic cooperation in Europe. Europe was supposed to become a federation of historical entities of similar size that would break the spell of nationalism. Later on, the Kreisau Circle developed a so-called ‘Europe Plan’ as blueprint for a European community (with European legislative institutions and a constitution). Much like in the EU many years later, the principle of subsidiarity was emphasized – decisions should be taken at the lowest possible level of governance. Furthermore, the Kreisau Circle spoke out in favour of a world organization stronger than the League of Nations. Outside of Germany, in the ranks of the resistance against National Socialism and fascism, a federalist European ideal also developed during the war. It sought an alternative to the National Socialists’ pursuit of a European ‘Großraum’, and a form of collective security against the Soviet Union. According to these federalists, the German conquest of the European continent proved that European countries could not defend themselves individually, and that national sovereignty in Europe had become a chimera. The era of Kleinstaaterei, according to them, was at an end, both militarily and economically. Despite fundamental differences, like respect for human values, their federalist ideal had a few similarities with the National Socialists’ Europe. Both for the Nazis and the resistance, ‘Europa’ had undertones of a socioeconomic ‘third way’ between the capitalist free-market economy of the United States and the communist centrally-planned economy of the Soviet Union. Increasing the scale of the market to all of Europe was bound to lead to rising prosperity. After the downfall of Nazi Germany in May 1945, champions of a stronger European continent, were more or less opposed by proponents of Europe\n\n28\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nas a building block for broader political cooperation and unification in an Atlantic context or in the context of the United Nations, the successor to the League of Nations. Some thought along the lines of Aristide Briand, whose European plans of 1930 proposed initiating a caucus for European cooperation within the League of Nations. In the early post-war years, ideas about federalist cooperation and strengthening the community of European states existed alongside even more ambitious prospects, such as so-called ‘world federalism’. In the second half of the 1940s, however, these visions for worldwide cooperation dwindled under the impact of the Cold War. The European federalists constituted a colourful elitist club, united as the Union of European Federalists under the presidency of Hendrik Brugmans on 17 December 1946. At that time, many members envisioned a Europe consisting of smaller regions united into one European federation. To their mind, the power of the nation states had to be broken. That process would politically integrate post-war Germany (the anticipated economic engine of Western Europe) without it having to be curtailed economically for fear of renewed German military aggression. Though these federalists did have their long-term objectives, they lacked a concrete strategy to achieve these ends.\n\nThe Cold War and the German Question After the end of the Second World War, the Cold War and the division of Germany constituted important catalysts for economic cooperation in Western Europe. Western European democracies were under pressure to provide higher levels of prosperity for their citizens. Poverty as a consequence of the crisis in the 1930s, was one of the root causes of the Second World War, still fresh in the collective memory. States wanted to prevent their own citizens from becoming receptive to communism due to material poverty. Economic integration of the western half of Germany into Western Europe was a significant pursuit for Western European countries. They sought to profit economically from rebuilding western Germany without risking a renewed threat from Germany as a dominant economic and political power at the heart of Europe. Integration, moreover, prevented the creation of a reunited and neutral Germany, which over time might have ended up siding with the Soviet Union. The Allies disagreed on the question of what was supposed to happen with Germany after the Nazi regime had been defeated. Toward the end of the Second World War, there were initially plans in the United States to re-agriculturalize Germany as a punishment. Germany, which from\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n29\n\nthe nineteenth century onwards had been the industrial core of Europe, was supposedly to be divided up to become primarily agricultural. The objective was to prevent it from ever being able to produce tanks, airplanes and explosives, whereby it could once again become a threat. That plan quickly proved to be impracticable. Keeping Germany economically low, would lead to an economic downturn for Germany’s trading partners too. Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill met at the Yalta conference at the beginning of 1945. On that occasion and at the Potsdam conference, after the capitulation of Nazi Germany on 8 May 1945, post-war European order and the German question were high on the agenda. As a result of these conferences, Europe was divided into Eastern and Western spheres of influence. Germany was divided up into four occupation zones. As Germany ceased to be a common enemy, the mutual fear of the communist East and the democratic and capitalist West increased ever more, resulting in the Cold War. On 12 March 1947, American president Harry S. Truman gave an historic address to the American Congress, in which he promised aid to all countries that felt threatened by communist expansion. The so-called ‘Truman Doctrine’ was translated into the policy of ‘containment’, with the objective of blocking further expansion of communism in the entire world, including Western European colonies, where the pursuit of independence was rising markedly. The Cold War had a strong economic, in addition to a geopolitical dimension. The fact that the United States and the Soviet Union wanted to acquire as much worldwide economic influence as possible constituted a significant cause of the Cold War. Moreover, the West and the East were determined to maximize their economic power as a precondition for military power as well as to demonstrate the superiority of their respective ideological systems. The post-war economic order of the Western world had already been set up during the Second World War. The 1944 Bretton Woods system for regulating reciprocal international payment transactions, in which Western European states also participated after liberation, was of major importance. Thenceforth, the currencies of the various participating countries had fixed exchange rates vis-à-vis the American dollar. The dollar was further convertible to gold and thus inflation-proof. This system, which held on until 1973, envisioned liberalization of trade, yet providing for the possibility of limiting imports from countries with scarce currencies. After the war, the economies of European countries had to be rebuild once again. Just as in the 1930s, economies in Western European countries were heavily closed off to one another as a result of tariff barriers and other national protectionist measures. An even more urgent foreign trade\n\n30\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nproblem for Western European countries was a shortage of dollars, caused by an increased demand for imports from America after the elimination of Germany as a capital goods supplier. This hindered exports for the United States. The government of the United States was willing to help, but insisted on European economic integration, a precondition for efficiency in production and, therefore, rising prosperity. Last, but not least, integration would facilitate American exports to Europe. In June 1947, the U.S. secretary of State George Marshall made a speech declaring American intentions in the matter of aid through dollars to Europe, whereupon, on the Americans’ orders, a conference for European economic cooperation was organized in the summer of 1947. On that occasion, participating European countries were expected to organize the distribution of Marshall aid – officially called the European Recovery Program (ERP). According to the Marshall Plan, European importers would deposit money for imports from the United States in national currencies into a so-called ‘counterpart account’ for their own country. The exporter from the United States had the owed amount paid for by his own government in dollars. The European country repaid the national debt and paid for reconstruction projects with money in the counterpart account. The money (thirteen billion dollars) pledged by George Marshall, the American minister for Foreign Affairs, was initially intended for all European countries, but the countries under the influence of the Soviet Union were forced by Stalin to turn down the aid. Occupied territories in western Germany were not represented at the conference, nor were they represented by the occupying Allied authorities. At the meeting in Paris in July 1947, the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) acted in unison for the economic benefit of western Germany. Between the Benelux countries and France intense controversy arose over the inclusion of these German territories into the recovery programme. The French took the position that a recovery of German industry constituted a threat to the security of Europe and preferred to maintain the Allies’ production restrictions for Germany. The Benelux delegation successfully insisted on including the German economy in the European economy because of their substantial dependence on exports to Germany. The Americans were the driving force behind the formation of the most important institution for economic cooperation in Europe in the 1940s. In April 1948, in the context of Marshall aid, the Organization for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) was established. OEEC increasingly acquired its own competences. For instance, beginning in the autumn of 1948, proposals for the use of Marshall dollars from the various European\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n31\n\ncountries were evaluated internally. Subsequently, these proposals were presented to the American Congress for approval. The total aid between 1948 and 1952 amounted to more than 12.4 billion dollars and was distributed across sixteen European countries, including Turkey. The aid helped restore confidence in the economy of Western European countries, while the East European states kept their distance on Stalin’s order – an initial indication of the division of Europe. At the same time, financial support from the United States forced the Western European countries to cooperate. OEEC’s role was not only limited to Marshall aid. The initiative of the OEEC to cancel claims and debts in a multilateral West European framework constituted the first step towards the European Payments Union (EPU), created in August 1950. Currencies became convertible: no restrictions on currencies applied for reciprocal trade, whereby that trade was not hampered by deficits or surpluses in the balance of trade between two countries. In addition to the above forms of cooperation, joint action also emerged on a smaller scale. The spirit of cooperation between the Ouchy countries was revitalized in September 1944, for example, when the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments-in-exile signed the Benelux Treaty. They committed themselves to forming a customs union after the war. This commitment is often seen as preparing the way for European economic integration. The fact that the Benelux did not function too well economically was not widely known. The motives for the founding of the Benelux were economic in nature. Initially, the economies of Belgium and the Netherlands were expected to complement each other. A customs union was deemed beneficial to both. In reality, Belgium’s economy recovered fairly quickly after its liberation in 1944, whereas the Dutch economy came out of the war battered eight months later. As a result of its meagre exports, the Netherlands had to urgently deal with problems in its payments balance. While wages and prices were allowed to rise quickly in Belgium, the Netherlands held on to low wages and prices. It was not until the 1950s, when Dutch exports rose more strongly, that this situation changed. In February 1958, the Benelux states signed a treaty for economic union, a label that this intergovernmental alliance did not deserve, in practice. Therefore, the Benelux barely qualifies as a meaningful forerunner of the European Economic Community. In sum, after the Second World War Western Europe feared both a renewed threat from Germany and communism from the East. In the minds of policy makers, the best remedy for communism was more prosperity for their own citizens, but for such welfare, a vibrant West-German economy was indispensable. The economic integration of Europe offered a solution to this dilemma.\n\n32\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nIntergovernmental and Federalist Routes to Europe Functional economic cooperation among the nation states in Western Europe, as with the Marshall aid, arose independently of political European idealism and its two currents of intergovernmentalism (or unionism) and federalism at the end of the 1940s. In the case of intergovernmentalism, cooperation beween states was based on conferences and each kept its sovereignty. Conversely, European federalism pursued a federal European state with a supranational government and parliament. In supranational organizations competences of national states were transferred to institutions above the nation states. Federalists like Altiero Spinelli, former member of the Italian Resistance, wanted to integrate the European nations through a directlyelected constituent assembly. Thus, the retarding effects of national governments would be avoided in the formation of a European political community. In May 1948, a large European congress was organized where representatives of European movements came together in The Hague – prominent people from dozens of European countries, as well as Canada and America. They came from labour movements, churches, youth organizations, the business community and politics. One of these prominent figures was Winston Churchill, who advocated an intergovernmentalist position. As Britain’s former prime minister, he was an ambivalent advocate of a united Europe. In a famous speech in Zurich in September 1946, he had spoken out in favour of Franco-German reconciliation as an initial step toward the United States of Europe. Yet, in his view the United Kingdom as a colonial power should initially stay aloof. The foremost question in The Hague was whether the European countries could accept the principle of a common authority for common interests. Despite the lip service paid to federalism at the congress, this pivotal question remained unanswered. It was agreed that a Council of Europe had to be created as a European body for human rights, along with a court of justice to ascertain that those rights were respected. The international study commission for this Council of Europe, consisting of delegations from the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, tackled the question of whether this future organization should hold supranational authority. Owing to British disapproval, power was placed in the hands of an intergovernmental Council of Ministers. Additionally, the British kept the supranational parliamentary assembly, set up as counterpart to the Council of Ministers, from acquiring any real competences. The Council of Europe in Strasbourg emerged from these talks on 5 May 1949. Initially, ten countries took part: the five countries mentioned above, as well as Italy, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n33\n\nThe Council of Europe had a Council of Ministers and a Consultative Parliamentary Assembly (Assemblée consultative). Initially, some federalists hoped that this assembly would become the germ for political unity, but the impotence of the advisory body became apparent rather quickly, characterized as it was by internal discord and poor relations with the Council of Ministers. The Council of Europe was responsible for supervising observance of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), which stipulated the rights of individuals and citizens for all inhabitants of the contracting states. The Convention was drawn up in 1950, following the example set by the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Council of Europe expanded quickly in terms of Member States. From 1959 on, citizens who believed their rights as set forth in the ECHR had been violated, could take legal proceedings before the European Court for Human Rights headquartered in Strasbourg.\n\nFunctionalist Routes to Europe During the establishment of the Council of Europe, federalism proved to be an unachievable ideal as a result of the opposition of national states. After the creation of the Council of Europe, attempts were made to bring about an integrated Europe by way of the so-called ‘functionalist’ route. Functionalism was a method to effect unity in a stealthy manner. In view of the fact that, according to the functionalists, Europe could not be created all at once or by following one single plan, they sought out a supranational shared destiny in a crucial ‘sector’, like heavy industry, agriculture or the military apparatus. In doing, they expected that the foundation could be laid for an increasingly closer union of nations. This method was called ‘sectoral integration’. The original functionalist ideal was technocratic administration by experts. In practice functionalists were just as attached to supranational political institutions as federalists, because those entities would aid in the formation of a European spirit among politicians. The Frenchman Jean Monnet is seen as the driving force behind this functionalist method and thus as the ‘founding father’ of post-war European integration. Yet at the end of the Second World War he was above all still looking after the interests of French industry. As a high-ranking official, he developed a plan for modernising the French economy, which was adopted by the French government under the leadership of De Gaulle. According to France, Germany had to be kept small in order to prevent it from once again constituting a military threat as well as to provide room for the French\n\n34\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\neconomy. For that development and modernization, France needed German coal and for that purpose it demanded assurances. Germany’s Saarland (in the French occupation zone) was placed under French administration. In addition, the Ruhr region (in the British occupation zone) as well as the Rhineland were to come under French or international administration, according to the French. The Americans, however, did not want to detach these territories from Germany, for fear that it would drive the Germans into the hands of Stalin, just as the Treaty of Versailles had driven them into the arms of Hitler. Instead, in 1949, the International Authority for the Ruhr (IAR) was created as a precondition of the Western allies for establishing the Federal Republic of Germany in the Western occupation zones. This IAR – an international entity that in effect controlled the West German economy by way of the Ruhr region – was a thorn in the side of the young Federal Republic. The French strategy had failed, but Monnet had a good eye for the American desire for European cooperation. For the sake of French economic interests, he elaborated a plan in which French management of German raw materials was worked into a comprehensive peace plan. Prompted by Monnet, Robert Schuman, the French minister for Foreign Affairs made an appeal for Franco-German reconciliation on 9 May 1950. Schuman argued that France had already been a champion of a united Europe for more than twenty years (ever since the Briand Plan). Because that plan had not been created at the crucial time, war had broken out once again. Now the age-old opposition between France and Germany was finally to disappear. The countries were to be brought closer to each other by the institution of a supranational High Authority for heavy industry, that is, for the production of coal and steel. In 1950 coal still constituted the most important industrial fuel, and steel was essential for the arms industry. Given the installation of a High Authority for coal and steel, a war between France and the Federal Republic became not only unthinkable but also materially impossible, according to Schuman. Participation was open to all European countries that wanted to join. The Schuman Plan was in essence a peace project. Even the day of its declaration – one day after the fifth anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany – recalled that intention. Without growing solidarity in production, the nations of Europe would be headed for a new war. In addition, Schuman’s declaration was a combination of various objectives. The spirit of European colonialism resounded in Schuman’s announcement that this new European community would acquire more (financial) resources for its most prominent task: the development of the African continent, which was\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n35\n\nat that time largely under French administration. Here, the reformist nature of Europe went hand-in-hand with imperial conservatism. Other countries participated for their own reasons. The Netherlands, for example, was interested in participation with an eye toward a future without its most important overseas territory, Indonesia, which had become independent in 1949. Decolonization obliged the Netherlands to undertake economic reorientation through industrialization, among other things. The Schuman Plan transferred control of coal and steel production to a supranational body. This entity would hinder dumping and other forms of improper competition resulting from government protectionism for trading partners. On account of its recent past, the Federal Republic could not count on very much international prestige. For Bonn, participating in the plan was a strategy to gain back some foreign influence. On top of that, the United States exerted pressure on the Federal Republic to participate in the integration process. After the introduction of the plan the Federal Republic would be rewarded with the elimination of the International Authority for the Ruhr. France, the Federal Republic, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg subsequently established the ECSC, the first supranational community with functionalist principles, based on a treaty that was valid for 50 years. This Treaty of Paris was signed 18 April 1951, whereby the ECSC brought it into effect on 25 July 1952. As its central mission, the Community was to ensure the permanent supply of coal and steel, important for the reconstruction of Europe after the Second World War. The ECSC preamble saw an increase in production as contributing to the ‘workings of peace’. In August 1952, the High Authority – the administration of the ECSC – met for the first time. The Council of (national) Ministers followed in September. The approval of this Council was required for important High Authority decisions. Additionally, the consultative Common Assembly, the parliament of the ECSC, came together for the first time in September. As the ECSC went into effect, it led to high expectations in the Member States. The ECSC was directed by the High Authority. This entity consisted of nine members (at most two per member state) to avoid any appearance that members of the High Authority were representatives of their Member States rather than acting as supranational European government ministers. Eight of these officials were appointed in talks between the Member States; the ninth was appointed by those eight. Members had to swear an oath that they would represent the interests of the Community as a whole and as such give no priority to the interests of their Member State. Initially the members of the High Authority had a mandate of six years; later on, this term was reduced to four years.\n\n36\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nCouncil of Ministers Ministers of the Member States\n\nCourt of Justice Nominated and appointed by the Member States\n\nppro va advis es\n\nand g rants a initia te\n\ns mea\n\nsures\n\nNominated by labour and employer organizations, appointed by the Council of Ministers\n\nes advis\n\nl\n\nConsultative Committee\n\nHigh Authority\n\nmonitors\n\nNominated and appointed by the Member States and by cooptation\n\nCommon Assembly Delegates from the national parliaments (double mandates)\n\nEuropean institutions: Treaty of Paris (1951/1952)\n\nThe High Authority supervized execution of the Treaty and for that purpose could provide non-binding advisory opinions to Member States and individual parties; make recommendations that were only binding in regard to the objectives but that left the way of implementing these objectives to the Member States; and reach decisions that were binding to all parties. The High Authority, then, came above national governments in areas strongly demarcated in the ECSC Treaty. In its first two and a half years the High Authority was under the presidency of Monnet. The Netherlands and Belgium had demanded robust competences for a Council of Ministers in the ECSC. This so-called ‘Council’ – from whom approval was required in the case of important decisions – was a community body that was deemed to represent the general interest in relation to coal and steel, while individual ministers also represented the interests of their Member States in the Council. In practice, the Council constituted an intergovernmental counterweight to the supranational High Authority. In this line of reasoning, political and democratic responsibility for decision-making lay with the Council of Ministers. Initially every state delegated one member of its cabinet to the Council. With the exception\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n37\n\nof the very first president – Konrad Adenauer, the West German federal chancellor and minister for Foreign Affairs – these delegates were mostly ministers for Economic Affairs or for Industry and Trade. The presidency was carried out in rotation for a time period lasting three months according to the alphabetical order of the participating states. The High Authority was controlled by the so-called Common Assembly (Assemblée commune), usually called ‘the Assembly’. This forerunner of the European Parliament came together at Strasbourg once a year and furthermore in extraordinary session upon request of the Council. In anticipation of future direct elections, the 78 members of the Assembly were provisionally delegated by their national parliaments. This simultaneous membership in the national parliament and the Assembly was called the ‘double mandate’. The delegates were not representatives of their national states but, rather, of their political parties. The main parties represented in the Assembly were Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and Liberals, though representatives of smaller parties could also be found there. Sister parties from the various Member States worked together, yet there was still no talk of forming European parties. In the ECSC there was a Consultative Committee, consisting of employers, employees and business people, the members of which were appointed by the Council. The goal of involving these interested parties, was to create consensus for the policy that was to be executed so that social peace would be maintained. This Consultative Committee was a forerunner of the later Economic and Social Committee in the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Community for Atomic Energy (ECA or Euratom). Finally, there was the Court of Justice, where Member States or Community institutions were able to have disputes adjudicated concerning decisions and recommendations of the High Authority. Businesses and organizations could do the same thing in certain cases. The Court consisted of seven judges and two advocates general. This court was seated in Luxembourg and ought not be confused with the Council of Europe’s European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg.\n\nFailed Attempt at a ‘Constitution’ for Europe Under pressure from the Cold War, sector integration for Western Europe was also pursued in the military. In spite of the Truman Doctrine, the United States reduced their troops in Europe. When the communists seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, it led to a reaction of anti-communist alarm\n\n38\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nin Western Europe. It was feared that Western Europe would be handed over to communism from the East. Various Western European countries pursued Western European cooperation in the military arena, which would also strengthen ties with the United States. This pursuit took shape in the Brussels Pact that was concluded by France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in March 1948, and was formally a military alliance against the threat from Germany. Subsequently the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established in 1949, which created a shared military destiny between the United States and European countries against the communist threat from the East: an attack on one of the countries was conceived as an attack on all of them. The intensification of the Cold War from 1948 forward resulted in plans for a European Defence Community (EDC) in 1950. The German question played a significant role in security policy. After the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was established in East Germany in that same year. The United States insisted upon the rearmament of the Federal Republic in 1950. That remilitarization had to do with increasing tensions with the Soviet Union and the outbreak of the Korean War. A re-armed West Germany would make Western Europe less vulnerable to an attack from the East. At the head of the Federal Republic stood Adenauer, a Christian Democrat and a Rhinelander, who with his policy of ‘Westbindung’ (‘connecting to the West’) wanted there to be no doubt that his Federal Republic belonged to the West. This position was in contrast to Kurt Schumacher, his Socialist political rival, who seemed to give priority to a ‘Wiedervereinigung’, (‘re-unification’) of Germany that implied concessions to Moscow. In 1952 Stalin offered to allow both Germanies to re-unite, provided this re-united Germany would be neutral in the Cold War. The Socialists in West Germany were – in spite of their fierce anti-communism – more susceptible to this notion than the Christian Democrats. Under Adenauer’s leadership, West Germany withstood the tempting appeal from Moscow. Many European countries felt no enthusiasm for an autonomous WestGerman army with German commanders. Under pressure from his former leader Monnet, French minister-president René Pleven therefore drafted a plan for a European army. West German troops, would participate in this army, thus expressing mutual reconciliation and the pursuit of peace in Western Europe. The army would be under orders from a joint European command. There was much resistance to establishing this European Defence Community. The Federal Republic initially had little say in the plan and felt degraded as a result, whereas other potential participants were\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n39\n\nafraid of too much West German power. The Americans were initially not enthusiastic about the plan, because they saw it as a French attempt to drag out the re-armament of the Federal Republic. Monnet hammered away at the American allies about the need for integrating the Federal Republic into Western Europe and convinced them of the value of the plan, which was altered to the benefit of the Federal Republic. Under intense American pressure, the EDC Treaty was signed in Paris on 27 May 1952. In accordance with the usual procedures, the EDC could begin after the parliaments of the Member States had ratified the treaty. The political leadership of the EDC was to be in the hands of a supranational European Political Community (EPC). When the ECSC Assembly came together for the first time on 10 September 1952, it was directly charged with the task of drawing up a European Constitution. All at once it seemed like a European federal state with a democratic parliament had come within arm’s reach. For this occasion, the members of the Assembly of the ECSC constituted a so-called Assemblée ad hoc, in which a few members from the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe were chosen as well. Their selection was necessary for achieving the correct number of representatives that had been granted each country in the EDC. A committee consisting of 26 members was formed to draw up the constitution, with subcommittees that tackled the questions of competences, political institutions and external relations, respectively, of the envisioned EPC. The results of the constitutional committee were discussed by the Assemblée ad hoc in January 1953, after which the draft version of the statutes for the EPC was tendered to the ministers. Federalists wanted to take advantage of what they perceived as positive public opinion. In the early 1950s, national branches of the European Movement, a European lobbying group for European unity, organized several referendums on European unity in selected West European cities. Just how high expectations were in 1952 and 1953 among the population of, for example, the Netherlands, and how great their enthusiasm, was apparent in a trial referendum organized on 17 December 1952. Approximately 95 per cent of those entitled to vote who turned out in the Dutch towns of Bolsward and Delft (considered to be representative for the Netherlands as a whole) desired a united Europe with a European government and a democratic representative body. At the end of 1952, against a backdrop of talks concerning the EPC, the Dutch minister for Foreign Affairs Wim Beyen presented the Beyen Plan, for a customs union that was to make economic warfare as waged in the 1930s impossible once and for all. During times of crisis, according\n\n40\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nto leading politicians, a lax form of economic cooperation would not be able to withstand the egoism of national states, which would want to solve their own economic problems at the expense of their trading partners, if necessary. Whereas France, specifically, did not in fact want any customs union on account of the weak competitive strength of its own economy, the Netherlands considered the Beyen Plan to be the most attractive component of the agenda for European integration. The Dutch government did not want any integration without also having something economically substantive to it. For the Netherlands as a trading country, the creation of a customs union and, subsequently, of a fully-developed common market constituted a precondition for economic survival and modernization. West European politicians were deeply suspicious that the EDC would eventually come to be regarded as an opportunity for the U.S. to withdraw its troops from Western Europe, which would imply a strong rise in defence costs for Western European countries themselves. In 1953 the death of Stalin led to a period of detente in the Cold War, and the Korean War ended in an armistice. Once again the Americans had ratcheted up their military presence in Europe, and the need for a defence community seemed less urgent. The plans for the EPC had already landed in a drawer in 1953. Ultimately, the EDC Treaty was taken off the table by the French parliament, in 1954. For European federalists this dismissal was a major disappointment. In all other countries except Italy, the treaty had already been ratified. It signified the definitive end for the EPC and the EDC. Another solution was found for the rearmament of Germany, which was to take place within the context of the EDC. In 1955 West Germany, along with Italy, entered NATO by way of the Western European Union (WEU, a 1954 successor to the Brussels Pact). The countries in the Eastern bloc formed the Warsaw Pact a few days after this accession. As a joint European voice in NATO, the WEU never weighed very heavily, because the participants were afraid that if they acted jointly they would distance themselves from the United States. Tension between European cooperation in the area of defence and the necessary support of the United States in NATO would return as a problem in the 1990s.\n\n‘Relance’ ‘Relance’ (‘new start’) is the conventional term for the resumption of deliberations concerning European integration after the rejection of the EDC. This term gave expression to the hope and expectation of many contemporaries\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n41\n\nthat, in spite of that rejection, a kind of European unity was nevertheless in the making, even if it still was not certain in the least in 1955. Monnet left his post as the president of the ECSC’s High Authority prematurely, convinced that he could better serve the mired process of integration elsewhere. In October 1955, he set up the now famous Action Committee for the United States of Europe, an organization that was to incite the most important politicians into conducting a European policy. In that same year he and Paul-Henri Spaak, the Belgian minister for Foreign Affairs, presented an initiative to establish a community for atomic energy, the energy source of the future. Much more broadly set up than this sectoral atomic community of Monnet and Spaak was the new proposal by the Dutch minister Beyen for a European market, which was to start off with a common customs union. This union led to the EEC, which would become far and away the most important Community of the European project as well as the most important column upon which the European Union would be built two generations later. These plans were discussed by the assembled ministers for Foreign Affairs from the ECSC Member States at the Conference of Messina in June 1955. Subsequently, under Spaak’s leadership in Brussels, a report was drawn up concerning the direction for this integration. Initially the British also took part in these discussions, but they withdrew when it became clear that the talks were aimed at the creation of a customs union. London did not want to go any further than a free trade zone. Under Spaak’s leadership, following his report, negotiations ensued over an economic community and an atomic energy community in 1956 and 1957. During the negotiations in Brussels talks concerning ‘supranational’ objectives were avoided by the negotiators. After the rejection of the EDC as a result of French politics in 1954, no one wanted to endanger these new negotiations in any way at all. The French were above all interested in the community for atomic energy and had to take the customs union as part of the bargain. During negotiations, the question for the French was whether their own economy was competitive enough to remain standing in such a customs union. The French demand for social ‘harmonization’ in Europe – the accomodation of generous French policy in matters of overtime, vacation and equal pay for women and men – ran into robust German resistance at a ministerial conference in Paris in October 1956. During increasing international tensions however, as a consequence of the Suez Crisis and of the defeat of the Hungarian uprising by the Soviet Union, in November 1956, the willingness to compromise increased on the part of both Adenauer as well as the French prime minister Guy Mollet. American resistance to the Anglo-French military intervention\n\n42\n\nThe Unfinished History of European Integr ation\n\nin the Suez convinced France that its interests did not run parallel to those of the United States. The French gaze subsequently focussed on the European continent. For the Federal Republic, too, it was international developments that caused its willingness for European integration to increase. The Federal Republic had no confidence in lasting protection from the United States and saw in European integration a safeguard against communism from the East. In the new harmonious relations between France and the Federal Republic, a supranational authority was no longer taboo. At the request of the Netherlands and France earlier ideas about integration in the agricultural sector were incorporated into the common market. A hot potato in the concluding phase of the negotiations concerning the EEC Treaty was the association of overseas territories, an affiliation desired by France and Belgium, in which their colonies were to receive money from a European fund to bring about development. Other Member States were not very enthusiastic about paying for the colonial policy of France, in particular, which had been wrapped up in a complicated and bloody war of decolonization in Algeria. The laborious, conclusive negotiations were conducted by government leaders and ministers for Foreign Affairs in February 1957. After an informal bilateral meeting between Mollet and Adenauer, a breakthrough was reached – an example of the Franco-German ‘engine’ in the process of integration. During the negotiations, the United Kingdom entered into troubled waters with the EEC as a result of coming up with its own proposal for a free trade zone for industrial products within the framework of the OEEC – without any plans for agriculture, though, on account of the cheap agricultural imports by the United Kingdom from its own former colonies. With some good faith, the proposed intergovernmental free trade zone could be seen as a complement to the EEC. Yet many saw in it a divide-and-conquer tactic by the British for torpedoing the EEC customs union – potentially a much more powerful trading partner than the individual Member States. The plan ran into resistance from Adenauer and Mollet, who stuck to a customs union of ‘the Six’ (the common name for the six founding Member States of the ECSC, the EEC and Euratom). The Treaties of Rome were signed in a grand ceremony on 25 March 1957, thus establishing the EEC and Euratom. More so than the establishment of the ECSC, the establishment of the EEC and Euratom were considered by many contemporaries to be the beginning of a common future for the Six. The EEC and Euratom officially commenced as of 1 January 1958. The EEC was to become a customs union in multiple steps. The existing external tariffs differed among the countries of the Six. Those of a trading country like the Netherlands were generally low compared to those of\n\nMany Roads to Europe\n\n43\n\nFrance, which shielded its own economy from foreign competition with these duties. As a trading country, the Netherlands benefited from low common external tariffs and wanted to head toward a customs union at high speed. This customs union subsequently needed – as agreed in the EEC Treaty – to be developed further into a fully-fledged common market, that is to say, with free cross-border movement of goods, as well as services, capital and labour. Ultimately, these so-called ‘four freedoms’ have been brought about in the European Union. In 1957, in contrast, Paris wanted high external tariffs instead and tried to put the brakes on the speed of mutual economic integration. The outcome of the negotiation process was high external tariffs to start, which would be lowered subsequently in phases. The customs union was completed in 1968. In terms of institutions, the EEC and Euratom were each dressed up with their own administrative bodies, which were comparable to the High Authority of the ECSC. The Assembly was expanded from 78 to 142 members and henceforth also included the two new Communities in its parliamentary oversight. While the ECSC Treaty still exclusively made mention of the competency for exercising oversight by the Assembly, this authority was expanded in the EEC Treaty and the Euratom Treaty to ‘the powers of deliberation and control’. Later expansions of competences in the European Parliament were based on that crucial addition. In spite of the many similarities among Communities, the EEC and Euratom had a different nature to that of the ECSC. In the two new Communities, the Council was central to the decision-making process. From the very beginning it was clear that the Member States would monitor their national interests, whereby they would be supported by the Committee of Permanent Representatives to the European Communities, the so-called Coreper (Comité des Représentants Permanents). Just like the ECSC, Euratom was a sectoral community, concentrating on a demarcated economic sector. At the end of the 1950s it had become clear that the primary interest of Member States was not in these kinds of communities but in the much broader EEC. As a result, it also became clear that the sectoral approach had become sidetracked. The EEC was less ‘supranational’ but at the same time more political than the ECSC. The High Authority of the ECSC had to adhere strictly to the letter of the Treaty; the Commission of the EEC could develop its own initiatives and thus expand its power to br"
