        "text": "The article discusses the rise and fall of the two famous left-wing terrorist groups, namely Rote Armee Fraktion and Brigate Rosse. After a brief discussion about left-wing extremism, following sections will focus on each group in more detail. After these sections, an analysis of commonalities and differences about their rise and fall will be presented. It is expected that a causal mechanism will be fleshed out not only regarding left-wing terrorist groups but also terrorist groups all around the world regardless of their particular mind-set, which can both open up space for future research and help devising more effective counter-terrorism strategies."
