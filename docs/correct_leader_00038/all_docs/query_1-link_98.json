Hitlers right hand man, and chosen successor, Martin Bormanns retirement was detailed in the book Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile by Paul Manning. Evil doctor Josef Mengeles retirement in Paraguay was detailed in a Granada TV World In Action documentary.\n\nWorld In Action volume 2\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Action-Vol-2-DVD/dp/B002KAIVYU/\n\nAnd there is witness testimony. Hampshires Idris Francis explains that his uncle, when escorting two senior Nazi SS officers to their trial at Nurenberg, found them laughing at their British guards. Boasting that the Allies thought they had won the second world war, but they hadnt, and that the Nazis would return as an even greater force in the future. And you wont even know what hit you, they scoffed.\n\nIn 1944/45 Bormann's 'Aktion Feuerland plan paved the way for looted securities to be smuggled through Argentina and thence laundered through Sullivan and Cromwell law firm in New York. With the aid of Allen Welsh Dulles who was busy recruiting former Nazis into his OSS, soon to be renamed the CIA.\n\nAmerica's Nazi Secret by John Loftus (2010)\n\nhttp://trineday.com/paypal_store/product_pages/Americas_Nazi_Secret/index.html\n\nAt the Maison Rouge Hotel in Strasbourg on August 10, 1944 Nazis at the so-called 'Red House' meeting, met to finalise a post war continuity network which may now be one of the greatest problems in the Western world, almost invisible, and almost ignored by the mainstream press. A contemporary US intelligence report of the Maison Rouge meeting recently made it out to the public.\n\nRevealed: The secret report that shows how the Nazis planned a Fourth Reich ...in the EU\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1179902/Revealed-The-secret-report-shows-Nazis-planned-Fourth-Reich--EU.html\n\nFormer SS Panzer Corps comander Paul Hausser calmly explained after the war that the initial meetings of NATO were made up of international supporters of the SS. In the 1950s NATO then developed a secret political wing, Bilderberg. It was founded in 1955 in a hotel owned by, and the meeting convened and chaired by, former SS officer, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. More recently the 'Atlantic Alliance' has renounced its founding charter becoming a proactive war-starting, resource grabbing, mercenary outfit.\n\nFeature films such as The Quiller Memorandum (1966) and The Odessa File (1974) make it clear that, in the days when writers and producers could get the funding, Nazi continuity was not a 'cospiracy theory' but a plotline that attracted the worlds greatest actors and directors.\n\nWhat you dont know about the Bilderberg-Group\n\nhttp://www.voltairenet.org/What-you-don-t-know-about-the\n\nHow many more examples do we require of a ruthless and effective Nazi continuity network?\n\nPaving the way to an open third world war\n\nIn the grim days of empire, British explorers used the excuse of 'trade' to infiltrate, then betray, communities they wanted to colonise. One could come to love the honesty of a Roman shield wall. Now, under the same 'trade' banner, Britains industrial wealth is being stripped, our cities are becoming like an animal carcass, being pecked at by crows. Some might cry 'justice' for being the biggest empire the world has ever seen, at its height controlling a quater of the world's population, 450 million in 1922.\n\nBut we do have the choice to bring the rest of the world up to Britain's standard, rather than dumb Britain back down to the stone age. David Cameron's elite Bullingdon Club cult-government have chosen the latter. The potential of Britain's youth has been abandoned, all but obedient, soulless automata and the offspring of the elite. We are witnessing the dumbing down of a nation in our schools, and in broadcasting, which no longer care who Moses was.\n\nEarth into Property: Colonization, Decolonization, and Capitalism by Anthony Hall\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Earth-into-Property-Decolonization-McGill-Queens/dp/077353122X/\n\nThe early promise of television was it seems, just a ruse to get sets into our living rooms to tell us what to think. No wonder our wise young people don't watch it. Josef Goebells would be proud of the pro-NATO war propaganda 'news' shown daily on our TV screens to an older, guillible generation. All social ills can be 'accidents' and 'unfortunate' with no-one to blame and no option in the ballot box for the simple policies that will solve the crisis.\n\nMuslim culture, faith and lands are not only under military assault but mass media and cultural assault, exactly as the Jews were in 1930s Germany. The present financial crisis is creeping in the direction of the social deprivation which existed in 1930s Germany. Upon the accession of the Nazi party economic conditions vastly improved giving Adolf Hitler enormous internal kudos within Germany itself. What may be being created, right now, is a kind of red carpet for the next Hitler. At the least, social deprivation is always a fertile ground for racism and fascism.\n\nThe mechanism of social strangulation\n\nIn peacetime the favourite method of treasonous organizing is the cult coven or lodge. The iron power of secret societies lies in their blood-curdling oaths - the initiate trembles as he or she willingly agrees to be murdered - renouncing the wider community and pledging two things. To keep the secrets of the craft and to always protect a fellow member above all others. This cult organisation is highly dangerous, particularly in the financal sector, justice, lawmaking and when managing thermonuclear weapons.\n\nFreemason, Jim Bevan & Independent Radio Journalist, Tony Gosling on The Moore Show\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEAeJ1mOL3Y\n\nAdolf Hitler understood the power of these cults, the most populous of which is 'golf club' freemasonry, and he had them all shut down as soon as he had risen to prominence. To make it certain nobody could use this powerful political tool to unseat him. Make no mistake his SS high priest, Heinrich Himmler, was a neo-pagan. A throwback to pre-Christian, brutal religion based on cults, elitism and rule by fear.\n\nJonathan Meades' - Jerry Building: Unholy Relics of Nazi Germany (1994)\n\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7166801834924005619\n\nWhilst British freemasonry retained an outward Christian character in the eighteenth & ninteenth centuries that has changed since the second world war. Formerly respectable masters of lodges have been and are being supplanted by ruthless, criminal individuals waiting for a 'convenient death' or using Mafia style bullying tactics to oust an opponent. The subsequent network is strangling our criminal justice system, particularly in the Crown Prosecution service where, according to my sources, cases like that of Gwent's Sarfraz Ibrahim are the tip of the iceberg.\n\nA senior lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service has admitted taking a £20,000 bribe to drop a criminal trial.\n\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7861092/Senior-CPS-lawyer-admits-taking-20000-bribe.html\n\nThe unaccountable CPS have led the way to a creeping South American dictatorship style culture of impunity here in Britain. Where are the Fraud squad? How can Andy Coulson run a criminal phone hacking operation where the victims are murdered children, dead British soldiers and 7/7 bombing victims? Then, rather than be jailed, Coulson is promoted to a job in No. 10 Downing Street. Unbelievably, Scotland Yard are now being asked to investigate its own officers for authorising undercover police in environmental groups to go through trials remaining undercover and perjuring themselves. The rot goes right to the top, our Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke is the UK's steering group representative on the aforementoned, Nazi founded Bilderberg conference.\n\nTwo messages for this age from jolly decent eighteenth century types\n\nIn the late eighteenth century John Robison and Abbé Augustin Barruel wrote and published books detailing the Illuminated takeover of freemasonry. Robison translated seized documents and interviewed continental Masons, cataloguing an organisational paradigm shift in the craft. Robison's book is Proofs of a Conspiracy (1793) in which leaks reveal a clear new operational focus on infiltrating the top echelons of six key areas of public life: media; politics and royalty; finance; law enforcement; military Generals; and finally bishops, churches and religion.\n\nReligions and Governments, being the heart and the head of the body politic, are spelt out as the two key targets. Abbé Barruel's book details some of the specific ritest and rituals that locked men in to this particularly anti-social cult.\n\nProofs of a Conspiracy\n\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/pc/index.htm\n\nCode of the Illuminati\n\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/mhj/index.htm\n\nIf one pictures the whole of human society as a pyramid, this new Illuminated freemasonry had as its target the apex of power, aiming to become the capstone from which all ideas and orders emanate. Audacious and patient efforts to control publishing and media would ensure that all discussion would take place within pre-determined bounds, thus limiting the broad masses of the population from understanding anything and protecting the elite from all accountability.\n\nSecret plans confiscated by the eighteenth century Bavarian officials and translated into English by Robison, show clearly that the organisation would target media, the law, buiiness and civil service, specifically the organs of appointment and promotion, todays Human Resources industry.\n\nToday freemasonrys Grand Master is 28th in line to the throne, Edward, HRH the Duke of Kent. With approximately 300,000 men initiated into the Masonic religious cult in Britain alone how does one identify one of these? Watch out for the squeezed knuckle handshakes and a difficult to define bluster when questioned about their faith and, as with all cults, use your sixth sense or 'second sight'.\n\nIn Abrahamic and in early Christian times Judaism and Christianity held to Saturday as the Sabbath. Over centuries and through corruption in the early Catholic church this was changed to Sunday. This change increasingly suited the cult-clergy since they could appear in church on a Sunday presiding over a Christian service, leaving them free to partake in an anti-Christian sabbat on a Saturday. So keep a close eye on those you suspect of being part of one of these covens on these nights.\n\nThe Sarumen of the 'white hand' - Meetings of satan's earthly disciples - esbats, sabbats and grand sabbats - from essays of Dennis Wheatley\n\nDoes someone you know 'dissapear off' some nights of the year? Do they make up an excuse that you don't trust in your guts? Many followers of the devil are in denial and believe their lord is still called Lucifer. Get active. The Christian has a duty to take an interest in and shine the light of love on satanic ceremonies.\n\nPagan rites are loosely based on the four ancient Egyptian mystery-religion quarter days, that is the summer and winter solstices and spring and autumn equinoxes. Dates which sometimes vary from year to year are June 21st and December 22nd for the solstices and March 21st and September 23rd for the equinoxes.\n\nBecoming a Vessel of Honour by Rebecca Brown - final chapter: To Satanists with Love\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Vessel-Honor-BROWN-REBECCA/dp/0883683229/\n\nThe satanic esbat is the weekly ritual gathering whereas satanic sabbats take place at midnight on every full moon. In addition grand sabbats take place four times a year on nights following February 2nd (Candlemas), April 30th (Walpurgisnacht), August 1st (Lammas) and October 31st (Halloween).\n\nThe witches sabbath occurs only once in seven years and the other meetings are merely 'covens'. At the sabbaths the black mass is performed which is a reversal and perversion of the catholic mass. The black mass is performed between 11pm and midnight with the subsequent drugged, drunken and debauched revellings continuing until dawn.\n\nThe culmination of the 'ultimate' black mass is the murderous 'sacrifice' of an innocent person, preferably a virgin of either sex. Human Sacrifice was normal under the Druid cult in the Celtic Britain that has become so fashionable today. See the hard evidence of the well-preserved and 'thrice killed' Lindow Man, discovered near Wilmslow in Cheshire in 1984.\n\nChildren who are being secretly brought up in the 'left-hand path' may be spectators at these ritualistic orgies. The horror and secrecy these rites can lock participants into is what the elite value, and can be used, of course, for the purposes of blackmail. Only through faithful prayer can those bonds be broken.\n\nThe answer in truth and faith from our Lord Jesus Christ\n\nAs has been foretold in Holy Scripture Jesus Christ, Yeshuah, the Messiah's Church, his living body, will be the most steadfast entity to stand against the violence and schemes of that old dragon the devil called satan who will send false prophets and mean-spirited illusionists to blind the people. Hoping for a massive blood sacrifice to the old gods and to use his religious fraudsters to instigate sectarian massacres. However, there is a God in Heaven that steadfastly loves his children, and would rather they did not have to grow up at the school of hard knocks.\n\nFurther reading -\n\nThe Devil and All his Works by Dennis Wheatley (1971) and The Satanist (1960)\n\nThe Antichrist and a Cup of Tea by Tim Cohen (1998)\n\nThe Antichrist and the Green Prince by John D.

'We lost money, then we made more than we lost because of the shorts,' referring to the practice of shorting, or betting against an investment.\n\nAnother email, from Fabrice Tourre, said the money-losing investments he sold were 'like Frankenstein turning against Frankenstein's monster'.\n\nToday, seven senior executives - including Mr Blankfein and Fabrice Tourre - are to be questioned in a Senate hearing in Washington.\n\nConcern over the outcome of that hearing is palpable throughout the workforce - not least because the annual bonus round is coming up, and Goldman Sachs is expected to pay out $5billion this year.\n\nAll of which explains why, as they sipped their morning coffees, the staff knew that Monday last week was not a day for the customary swaggering. Soon, lights began to blink on internal phones. A voicemail message to all staff had arrived from Lloyd Blankfein.\n\nFabrice Tourre has been charged by U.S. authorities with a £650million fraud He was the man who recently said that the bank did 'God's work' by 'helping companies to grow by helping them to raise capital [which] allows people to have jobs that create more growth and more wealth. We have a social purpose'.\n\nHe also claimed that he personally had 'attained perfection'.\n\nMy source at the bank tells me that the divine ambassador was slightly more subdued this week in his message, recorded before the markets opened.\n\n'It was a circle the wagons pep talk,' says an analyst at the institution, who would speak to the Mail only in confidence.\n\n'He calls [these speeches] \"mind bullets\". He reminded us of the Goldman way: we are the best, and we always, always put our clients first - which is why we are the best.'\n\nBlankfein - who is presiding over one of the bank's most profitable eras in history, began: 'This is Lloyd, on Sunday in New York.'\n\nWith magnificent understatement, he said that the furore over the allegations of fraud was 'uncomfortable, but given the anger directed at the financial services, not completely surprising'.\n\nHe ended with something of a battle cry: 'We have faced challenges before and our people have always responded through their skills, talent and focus on our clients.\n\n'We will do that now, and in the process, re-affirm everything that defines Goldman Sachs.'\n\nThe message was clear: Goldman Sachs is unbowed. As ever, its self-interests justify all - never mind the impact on the wider financial system. The biggest predators in the financial jungle would emerge unscathed. Just what is this institution, then, that believes it can shrug off the official hand on its shoulder?\n\nWho are these bankers who play God? And are they about to be cast out of heaven?\n\nTo answer these questions, we have to go back to the beginning and discover what made Goldman - as historian Charles Ellis describes in his book The Partnership - 'the most powerful and most dynamic organisation in the history of finance'.\n\n'Goldman Sachs employees would sell their grandmother if the company required it' Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869 by German immigrant Marcus Goldman, who had worked as a peddler from a horse-drawn cart when he first arrived in New York.\n\nHis fortunes soon improved, however, and in 1882, Goldman's son-in-law Samuel Sachs joined the firm, which pioneered new business techniques.\n\nIt joined the New York Stock Exchange in 1896. In the early 20th century, Goldman became one of the first companies to recruit top graduates from the new business schools.\n\nThe company was hit badly by the 1929 Wall Street crash - but soon, a mighty bank emerged from the ashes of the Depression.\n\nThis 'new' Goldman was driven by a 'long-term greedy' philosophy: if money was made over the long term, short-term trading losses could be written off.\n\nThis strategy was backed by a work ethic that still exists - during the Seventies, most ordinary bankers began work at 9am. At Goldman Sachs, under the stewardship of the workaholic Gus Levy, every employee was at his desk before 7am.\n\nThe bank was handling big money and by the Eighties, Goldman Sachs men - and they were almost entirely men - epitomised the world of Tom Wolfe's novel Bonfire Of The Vanities.\n\nWolf coined the phrase Master of the Universe for his anti-hero, bond trader Sherman McCoy, who lived an opulent Manhattan lifestyle with his trophy wife, until his house of cards tumbled down.\n\nA rare visitor describes the scene at the company's 50th-floor trading office in One New York Plaza, saying: 'A sea of twenty and thirty-somethings in pink and blue button-down shirts huddle around screens, discussing strategies.\n\n'In a small back office, a bald trader with sleeves rolled to his elbows hovers over a table of men at computers, repeatedly slapping his hand with a wooden cricket bat. 'They don't seem superhuman exactly, just singularly focused.'\n\nThe entrance to the bank's London office is at Peterborough Court, 133 Fleet Street. An in-and-out driveway allows visitors to leave the bustle of the City behind them and enter Goldman's reception.\n\nUp a flight of escalators is the trading floor, with around 700 chairs. This is where the profits are made.\n\n'I was expecting it to be manic, but actually it was very quiet,' ,'says one former employee.\n\n'It is like a cult, and working for Goldman is like being part of a cult - you are completely brainwashed into the Goldman Sachs way.'\n\nThirteen-hour days start before 6.30am, and most staff are young - partners earn enough to retire by the age of 40.\n\nThe company is characterised by an extraordinary culture of secrecy.\n\nAnother former employee tells me: 'No one on the inside will speak out. We were trained to be part of a team, and not to push ourselves forward as individuals.\n\n'The firm thrives on the fact that it is a club: an elite. Over and over again we repeated: we are the best of the best.\n\n'You are made to feel you are entitled to success. It is the most incredibly driven atmosphere. You become addicted to the adrenaline, to the arrogance and to belonging.\n\n'Goldman Sachs employees would sell their grandmother if the company required it.\n\n'It is like a cult, and working for Goldman is like being part of a cult - you are completely brainwashed into the Goldman Sachs way.'\n\nRegular 'class reunions' for those who joined the company at the same time ensure a strong alumni culture is maintained.\n\nAnother former employee - who worked trading bonds for the bank in London, Tokyo and New York for nine years until 2004 - tells me:\n\n'People used to joke that it was almost like joining the Mormons. 'I went through 70 interviews to get the job, including one in New York.\n\n'The Goldman way is knocked into you during the training; it is incredibly intensive. You learn you are not an individual, but part of a team - the best team.'\n\nHaving left at the age of 33, because he was wealthy enough to retire, he says: 'My theory is that Goldman's actively hires overachieving, insecure people, who want to do a good job and be liked, so they go on to work incredibly hard and become very committed.\n\n'It helps that you are paid telephone-number amounts of money.'\n\nJohn Rogers, Goldman chief of staff, says: 'People say: \"What's the secret sauce?\" Well, one of the most important ingredients in the sauce is the culture.'\n\nThe firm's culture has been compared, variously, to the Army, the KGB, the Mafia and - as we have heard - to a cult. Staff tend to socialise together, live in the same Manhattan apartment buildings and have summer homes around the same ponds in the Hamptons.\n\nGoldman Sachs might be about to find out that the wheels have fallen off The Machine In London, they live in a select number of Chelsea streets around the exclusive area of The Boltons, and send their children to the same private schools.\n\nFitting in is of the utmost importance. Subtle social tics - a bow tie, moustache, colourful personality - can eliminate you from the club.\n\n'The cult of the individual, which I think has been a disadvantage to so many of the firm's competitors, really doesn't exist here,' says Lucas van Praag, the British-born communications director. 'The more you have acceptance, the easier it is to be effective.'\n\nAs another Wall Street veteran puts it: 'The god is Goldman. You subjugate yourself to that god, and in return we will make you a gazillionaire.'\n\nThe Goldman way is enshrined in a set of 14 totemic principles written in the Seventies, and reprinted in every annual report.\n\nEmployees have to learn them by heart, and are encouraged to recite them before going to sleep each night.\n\nNumber one is: 'Our clients' interests always come first.'\n\nOther mantras include: 'We have yet to find the limits to the responsibility that our best people are able to assume.' Or: 'To breach a confidence would be unthinkable.' Another again asserts the belief that Goldman employees are better than mere mortals.\n\nIt reads: 'Although our activities are measured in billions of dollars, we select our people one by one. Without the best people, we cannot be the best firm.'\n\nIronically, it is this outlook that could lead to the firm's downfall.\n\nIts critics believe the bank has become overwhelmingly arrogant.\n\nIndeed, one partner spelt out this process to author Charles Ellis: 'We had always been the best - always the top students and the best athletes and the class leaders.\n\n'And now we were the best firm - in our self-appraisal. But that was the first step towards arrogance.'\n\nAs well as constantly asserting that its employees are the best, Goldman Sachs also sets itself up as their surrogate family.\n\nThe junior partners are told to go to every employee's major life events - marriages, funerals, bar mitzvahs.\n\nIn return, absolute loyalty to the firm is expected. The hours are long, and spouses and children pay a price - no one takes their full holiday entitlement because this would be frowned on - but the financial rewards are huge.\n\nGoldman Sachs gives the biggest bonuses in banking. Basic salaries are capped at £300,000 - the bulk of pay is performance related. In good years, the average employee is given a bonus of around £400,000. Many receive £1million, but the big players can easily collect several million.\n\nBlankfein rewarded himself with the highest payouts in Wall Street history, $53million in 2006 and $68million in 2007. Quite simply, making money is the foremost principle at Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe company ethos is a clean-living one: I spoke to one trader who told me that, unlike other cocaine-fuelled banking firms, drug taking is a complete no-no at Goldman's.\n\nIn the offices, gigantic, communal bowls of fresh fruit are laid out every morning.\n\nThe really big earners - Wolfe's Masters of the Universe - have their own personal assistants.\n\nOne recalls her everyday tasks: picking up dry- cleaning, buying stamps, paying gardeners, shopping for Christmas presents.\n\nA compensation for Goldman Sachs widows - the nickname for bankers' wives because they see so little of their husbands - is that many of their household chores are taken care of. One PA was even asked to help out with her boss's children's school project.\n\nFlouting wealth in the office is discouraged - Goldman employees are expected to be modest. Clearly, this ethos had slipped rather in the London office.\n\nLast week, the Mail revealed that Tetsuya Ishikawa, a banker who worked on the controversial fund set up by Fabrice Tourre, lived high on the hog.\n\nHe admitted that on his regular jaunts abroad, 'the first thing I asked was: \"Where is the brothel?\" '\n\nHe also wrote a novel based on his time at Goldman - and described a world where bankers drove only Ferraris or Lamborghinis because 'Porsches were for the commoners'.\n\nThe excess of Goldman employees was also revealed in the notorious case of Joyti De-Laurey, a former secretary at the bank, who was convicted in 2004 of stealing £4million from her bosses and spending it on hotels and jewellery.\n\n'They made it so easy, they deserved it,' she said at the time. 'Their money was just left lying about: if it wasn't for me, it would have been someone else.'\n\nThe backlash against the bank - which seems to have mopped up the financial crisis to its own gain - has intensified with the latest revelations. So just how is Goldman Sachs handling the criticism and the investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission?\n\nA London employee says: 'At first, we were all in shock. Now people are angry. We work very hard, and we do believe we are the best at what we do - which is making money, lots of money.\n\n'We've been told to go back to our core principles, and fight this latest attack. That is what we will do.'\n\nGiven that those core principles seem largely based on arrogance and greed, Goldman Sachs might be about to find out that the wheels have fallen off The Machine.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1269057/Goldman-Sachs-fraud-Damning-insight-beleaguered-cult-secrecy.html\n\n07Mar10 - PEPIS #124 CFR War & Peace studies - created Bilderberg\n\n01Mar10 - PEPIS #123 - Capitalism's terminal crisis?\n\n1 Mar, 23:33\n\nsee also\n\nEnron review could free Conrad Black\n\nbelow\n\nDear all,\n\nAs what could be capitalism's terminal crisis enters ever more dysfunctional phases, with fake recoveries and artificial traumatising of medium and small businesses by politically motivated private banks (and public banks where political control has been blocked) it is frustrating to hear mainstream media repeating the lie that nobody foresaw this crisis.\n\nUnfortunately the vast majority of mainstream media economic analysts are spellbound by entryist middle media managers and vested interests from the very financial system on which they report. The worst of them are steeped in vanity, but could their naivety be the outstanding quality for which they have been employed? This propaganda methodology is exacerbated because the majority of the national press employ compliant, young, naïve and docile economics correspondents. The archetype of which is the BBCs Robert Peston. His appears usable by The City as a star-struck conduit for ready spun leaks. In the days and weeks following a Peston pronouncement it is followed up by fake analysis by anonymous writers in the Economist and broadsheet economics editors. Their task is to tack Pestons hogwash down with suitable authoritative sounding gravitas.\n\nBut for the latest economic advice untrammelled by the NATO zone private military/financial media grid do check out the commercial French economic analysts at LEAP 2020.

I have been given a complete PDF of the first ever Bilderberg attendee list as well as a photograph to complement the famous black & white photo, with Bernhard in the Chair, taken in the first Bilderberg meeting. It shows the other side of the room and one can even see a sceptical looking Hugh Gaitskell in the corner of the room scratching his chin.\n\nhttp://bilderberg.org/bildhist.htm#1954\n\nhttp://bilderberg.org/bildhist.htm\n\nall the best\n\nTony Gosling\n\n(supporter of analogue TV and radio)\n\nwww.thisweek.org.uk\n\nEnron review could free Conrad Black\n\nDominic Rushe New York\n\nhttp://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article7043931.ece\n\nTHE US Supreme Court will begin reviewing the conviction of Enron boss Jeff Skilling on Monday in a move that could also lead to the release of Conrad Black, the jailed press baron.\n\nSkilling was sentenced to 24 years in jail in 2006 for his role in the collapse of the Houston energy company. He was convicted of depriving shareholders of his honest services, a Federal offence that has been widely used in white-collar criminal prosecutions.\n\nThe 1988 law that says public officials and executives can be convicted of fraud if they deprive those they represent of the right to honest services has already attracted the criticism of Supreme Court judges. Justice Antonin Scalia called the law mush and Justice Stephen Breyer said the laws language was so broad it could apply to a man who falsely compliments his boss.\n\nJohn Coffee, Adolf A Berle professor of law at Columbia Law School, said he expects the court will limit the honest-services fraud statute for not being clear enough and could throw it out. It is clear that the statute is in danger of being void for vagueness, said Coffee.\n\nBlack, serving a six-and-a-half-year sentence, was prosecuted using the honest-services statute. His case, and a third involving the former Alaska legislator Bruce Weyhrauch, will also be reviewed by the Supreme Court before this summer. All three could appeal against their sentences and be released if the statute is thrown out.\n\nBlack was convicted of three counts of mail fraud and one count of obstruction of justice in December 2007. He was acquitted of nine other counts, including racketeering and misuse of corporate perks.\n\nEven if the statute is thrown out, Black would still be guilty of obstruction of justice but a court could decide he had served that part of his sentence.\n\nJames Cox, law professor at Duke University, said the honest-services statute had been a useful tool in bringing white-collar criminals to court: But I think this is one of those cases where the court is going to read the statute fairly narrowly. Depriving a corporation of your fiduciary obligations, even where there is a self-serving motive, isnt going to be enough, he said.\n\nStanley Twardy, a former US prosecutor who is now a partner at Day Pitney, said the statute has been overused by the government. He said there was a good chance that government prosecutors would now lose their favourite weapon.\n\nRewriting the statute will present many difficulties for US prosecutors. Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich is now awaiting trial for corruption in Chicago and had been charged with a variety of breaches of the honest-services statute. This month he was charged for a second time, a move lawyers suggest was motivated by prosecutors fears that the honest-services fraud statute will not hold up.\n\n18Feb10 - PEPIS#122 Theo Chalmers interviews Martin Summers & Tony Gosling\n\nTheo Chalmers interviews Martin Summers & Tony Gosling for two hours on Edge Media TV this coming Monday 22nd February at 2pm GMT.\n\nTopics covered include: the orchestrated economic crisis, Obama administration's composition and motives, clandestine influence and objectives of the occult, Prescott Bush's coup attempt in the 1930s & collaboration with the Nazis as well as the Christmas Eve 'underpant bomber' and false flag terrorism in general.\n\nIf you have a Sky satellite reciever you can watch it on 'Controversial TV' which is Channel 200.\n\nAlternatively you can watch it online at http://www.edgemediatv.com\n\n09Feb10 - #121 Freemason judges shake off declaration of interest rules\n\nDear all,\n\nBilderberg founder Josef Retinger was an MI6 agent and Freemason, Andrew Palmer, organiser of the Turnberry Bilderberg meeting in 1998 was PA to the Grand Master of world Freemasonry The Duke of Kent, Bill Clinton is a freemason (I have been shown about 20 photographs of him in his regalia from the age of 21) though Wikipedia and other internet sources deny it\n\nBilderberg is throttling democracy in the West. It is an occult political tool ... of the dark side of freemasonry.\n\nNo freemason should ever be allowed to hold public office because of the oaths they all swear on initiation to protect their fellow masons above the general public. This oath is incompatible with duties discharged in public office.\n\nIf a freemason fails to declare that he knows someone who has an interest in a decision he is making and does not step down from making that decision or step out of the room in a case of eg. a planning meeting he commits a criminal offence of Misconduct in Public office.\n\nFreemasons are currently attempting to fill ALL magistrate positions in Britain, starting with the senior magistrates, with their brethren. A highly dangerous situation which must be stopped at all costs.\n\nThe best source of information for local lists of freemasons are the private books or 'provincial yearbook' which are published in each masonic province every year. These contain names of all local masons. Remember though many freemasons are members of London Lodges.\n\nFreemasons favour 'brethren' over the public so no wonder Bilderberg wants to keep its decisions and even the names of certain attendees secret. Please send me any info on other masonic connections to Bilderberg meetings.\n\nTony\n\nFreemasons shake off ruling on judiciary\n\nHelen Pidd guardian.co.uk, Thursday 5 November 2009 18.32 GMT\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/nov/05/freemasons-judges-magistrate...\n\nProspective judges will no longer have to declare if they are Freemasons, the government has announced .\n\nFor the past 11 years, anyone applying to be a judge or a magistrate for the first time had to declare on an application form whether they belong to the Freemasonry.\n\nBut Jack Straw, the justice secretary, said that as a review had shown no evidence of impropriety or malpractice as a result of a judge being a Freemason it would be \"disproportionate\" to continue with the practice, introduced in 1998.\n\nThere were \"existing safeguards that help support the proper performance of judicial functions\", including the judicial oath and an official complaints procedure, Straw said.\n\nThe United Grand Lodge of England made representations to ministers in May and indicated it may seek judicial review of the policy. This followed two cases at the European court of human rights where Italian Freemasons successfully argued it was discriminatory to be asked to declare membership of a non-secret society.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said all levels of the judiciary were affected by the decision, but not coroners, who are appointed by local authorities.\n\nChris Connop, the United Grand Lodge's information officer and a magistrate for 17 years, said: \"We are delighted at the decision. We have been feeling very miffed about this for a very long time.\n\n\"Even when the rule was introduced in 1998 after a report by the home affairs select committee, we were told there was no evidence of any impropriety on the part of judges who were members, but merely that there was a perception that it could be a problem, which is ridiculous.\"\n\nConnop said he hoped the Home Office would now change the rules which currently require potential police officers and anyone working for the probation or prison service to declare whether they are Freemasons.\n\nThe Freemasonry is \"blatantly\" not a secret society, said Connop, adding that members were forbidden to use Freemasonry for financial gain.\n\n\"We never objected to declaration, but we objected to being singled out. Where do you think most business deals take place? On the golf course. So shouldn't people have to declare which golf course they are members of?\" he added.\n\nThere are more than 330,000 Freemasons in England and Wales, and an estimated 6 million in the world.\n\n14Jan10 - PEPIS #120 Ergenekon & Obamas Brzezinski Plan\n\nbefore we begin...............\n\nJustice Ministry inspectors to be judged\n\nThursday, January 14, 2010 - ANKARA - Hürriyet Daily News\n\nhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=justice-ministry-inspectors-...\n\nThe Council of State has paved the way for Justice Ministry inspectors\n\nwho wiretapped 56 judges and prosecutors to be investigated, a probe\n\nprompted by a former chairman of the Judges and Prosecutors\n\nAssociation, or YARSAV.

I shall comment on each of these in turn.\n\n Islam is not an enemy, and the global war on terror does not\n\ndefine the United States current role in the world;\n\nThis has always been Americas policy. Even Bush 44, with his neocon\n\nstalwarts, refused, after 9/11, to identify the enemy as Islam. He\n\navoided naming the enemy by declaring war on terror. He went so far\n\nas to declare Islam, a religion of peace.\n\nWhat Obama has done differently was to publicly praise Islam, at the\n\nexpense of truth and to bow down to its titular head, the King of\n\nSaudi Arabia. He has moved from tolerance to overt partnership.\n\nBut a form of partnership has existed between Britain, US and the Arab\n\noil interests ever since last centurys thirties. The British worked\n\nwith the Arabs in the Middle East to thwart Germanys expansion there\n\nall at the expense of Jewish settlement rights. In the late seventies\n\nBritain, with the complicity of the US brought about the downfall of\n\nthe Shah because the Shah wanted to have an independent oil policy and\n\nnot one controlled by Britain.\n\nAccording to A Century Of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the\n\nNew World Order, by William Engdahl, a German historian.\n\nTheir scheme was based on a detailed study of the phenomenon of\n\nIslamic fundamentalism, as presented by British Islamic expert, Dr.\n\nBernard Lewis, then on assignment at Princeton University in the\n\nUnited States. Lewiss scheme, which was unveiled at the May 1979\n\nBilderberg meeting in Austria, endorsed the radical Muslim Brotherhood\n\nmovement behind Khomeini, in order to promote balkanization of the\n\nentire Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines. Lewis argued\n\nthat the West should encourage autonomous groups such as the Kurds,\n\nArmenians, Lebanese Maronites, Ethiopian Copts, Azerbaijani Turks, and\n\nso forth. The chaos would spread in what he termed an Arc of Crisis,\n\nwhich would spill over into Muslim regions of the Soviet Union.\n\nSo not only was this scheme intended to protect British oil interests\n\nin Iran, it was also intended to put pressure on the Soviets.\n\nIn a Counterpunch translation of interview of Zbigniew Brzezinski in\n\nLe Nouvel Observateur (France) 1998, Brzezinski took pride in having\n\nbrought on the Russian defeat in Afghanistan by supporting some\n\nstirred up Moslems, the Mujahedeen, and dismissed the idea that\n\nIslamic fundamentalism represents a world menace today. He said,.\n\nNonsense! It is said that the West had a global policy in regard to\n\nIslam. That is stupid. There isnt a global Islam. Look at Islam in a\n\nrational manner and without demagoguery or emotion. It is the leading\n\nreligion of the world with 1.5 billion followers. But what is there in\n\ncommon among Saudi Arabian fundamentalism, moderate Morocco, Pakistan\n\nmilitarism, Egyptian pro-Western or Central Asian secularism? Nothing\n\nmore than what unites the Christian countries.\n\nPres Reagan continued this policy of working with Islamic\n\nfundamentalists when he rescued Arafat and his minions from total\n\ndestruction by the IDF in Beirut. What other reason could there have\n\nbeen other than to use them one day to put pressure on Israel to\n\nreturn to the 67 armistice lines.\n\nPresent Clinton also co-opted Islamic fundamentalist, this time from\n\nKosovo, to dismember Serbia in order to reduce the power of Russia.\n\nObamas policies totally reflect this mentality in his downplaying the\n\nwar on terror and overplaying engagement. Obama wants to deal with\n\neach Moslem country as though it was not part of the whole of them, as\n\nthough they arent all followers of Islam as represented by the Koran\n\nor The Holy Koran as he refers to it.\n\nSaudi Arabian fundamentalism has invaded Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen,\n\nEurope, US and parts of Africa. It has influenced the Muslim\n\nBrotherhood which is attempting to overthrow Egypt. Al Qaeda is an\n\noutgrowth of such fundamentalism. Iran with its Shiite brand of\n\nIslamic fundamentalism has taken over Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza at\n\nleast politically if not religiously. Iraq with its 60% Shiite\n\npopulation could fall to them and already Turkey is cozying up to\n\nthem.\n\nYet Brzezinski and Obama maintain Islam is not an enemy even while\n\nthe fundamentalists and the Arab street attack America as the Great\n\nSatin and not Russia.\n\nRemember that Brzezinski was a founder the Trilateral Commission along\n\nwith Rockefeller, is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations in\n\nNew York and has attended meetings of the Bilderberg Group. Thus he\n\nstrongly favours World Government and its institutions as does Obama.\n\nNation states, such as Israel, are in their way. They find common\n\ncause with Islam because Islam too favours its own version of world\n\ngovernment, namely, the Caliphate.\n\n the United States will be a fair-minded and assertive mediator when\n\nit comes to attaining lasting peace between Israel and Palestine;\n\nThis conflict is so politicized as to make it impossible for anyone to\n\nbe fair minded or even handed or any other liberal balm. While\n\nthese notions sound great, they both ignore the facts and the law. You\n\ncannot do this and reach a just solution.\n\nThe US and Britain are just as determined to undermine Israel as they\n\nwere the Shah and for the same reason, oil. How can they be fair\n\nminded or trusted?\n\nassertive mediator is an oxymoron. Mediation is not arbitration. The\n\nrole of the mediator is to help the parties reconcile their\n\ndifferences without coercion. To assertively mediate is to coerce.\n\nObama certainly has been coercive to Israel. But all US\n\nadministrations have been coercive to varying degrees. The difference\n\nbeing that Obama intends to impose a solution if he can.\n\nBrzezinski and Obama propose that\n\n1. Jerusalem has to be shared, and shared genuinely.\n\n2. a settlement must be based on the 1967 lines, but with territorial\n\nswaps\n\n3. US or NATO station troops along the Jordon River.\n\n4. Palestinian refugees should not be granted the right of return to\n\nwhat is now Israel.\n\nHe argues that\n\nIt is important to remember that although the Israeli and Palestinian\n\npopulations are almost equal in number, under the 1967 lines the\n\nPalestinian territories account for only 22 percent of the old British\n\nmandate, whereas the Israeli territories account for 78 percent.\n\nHow could a man of his experience be so wrong. Israel together with\n\nJudea, Samaria and Gaza comprise 22% of the Mandate. The rest was\n\ngiven to Jordan in 1922. Now the international community wants Israel\n\nto divide up the 22% remaining, leaving even less for Israel than the\n\n22%.\n\nHe wants the refugees to be resettled within the Palestinian state.\n\nThey number in the many millions. How could Judea and Samaria possibly\n\naccommodate them. Imagine how destabilizing that would be. I venture\n\nto say that the present Arab inhabitants would be the most vociferous\n\nopponents to such an influx.\n\nWould it not be a better solution to resettle them all in Jordan. Not\n\nonly is Jordan Palestine, its population is 60% Palestinian. Thus\n\nthere would be no need to divide Jerusalem or put foreign troops along\n\nthe Jordan.\n\n the United States ought to pursue serious negotiations with Iran\n\nover its nuclear program, as well as other issues;\n\nThe US, even under Bush, has been unwilling to really challenge Iran,\n\npreferring to talk them out of their agenda. Obama made engagement\n\nwith Iran, a political platform. After a year of trying to engage Iran\n\nin a most humiliating manner, he has achieved nothing. And yet\n\nBrzezinski is still beating the same drum. Give it up already.\n\nWhat might the other issues be? Presumably, Middle East hegemony.\n\nHow much hegemony is he or Obama prepared to concede? If none or very\n\nlittle, there is no point in negotiations. Besides, what would Saudi\n\nArabia and Egypt have to say about this, to say nothing about Israel.\n\nBrzezinski argues\n\nBut it is still possible, perhaps through a more intrusive inspection\n\nregime, to fashion a reasonably credible arrangement that prevents\n\nweaponization.\n\nIt would not be conducive to serious negotiations if the United States\n\nwere to persist in publicly labeling Iran as a terrorist state, as a\n\nstate that is not to be trusted, as a state against which sanctions or\n\neven a military option should be prepared.\n\nSanctions must punish those in power  not the Iranian middle class,\n\nas an embargo on gasoline would do. The unintended result of imposing\n\nindiscriminately crippling sanctions would likely be to give the\n\nIranians the impression that the United States real objective is to\n\nprevent their country from acquiring even a peaceful nuclear program \n\nand that, in turn, would fuel nationalism and outrage.\n\nObama is following this prescription to a T, without good results I\n\nmight add. He is even unwilling to seriously support the opposition\n\nwith words to say nothing of deeds.\n\n the counterinsurgency campaign in the Taliban-controlled parts of\n\nAfghanistan should be part of a larger political undertaking, rather\n\nthan a predominantly military one;\n\nHe wants to engage with receptive elements of the Taliban arguing\n\nthat the Taliban are not a global revolutionary or terrorist\n\nmovement, they do not directly threaten the West. But they do host\n\nal Qaeda who is a threat.\n\nHis prescription is to enlist the majority Afghans to defeat them.\n\nDoes this not oppose the idea of engaging them? Will this plan work?\n\nThe US has been trying for the last five years or so to build up Iraqi\n\nforces to maintain order. Many believe that were the US to withdraw\n\nfrom Iraq as Obama intends, that the Iraqi forces would not be able to\n\ndo so. So much more so, for Afghanistan.\n\nBrzezinski recognizes that the support of Pakistan is a prerequisite\n\nbut recognizes how difficult this would be.\n\nGiven that many Pakistanis may prefer a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan\n\nto a secular Afghanistan that leans toward Pakistans archival, India,\n\nthe United States needs to assuage Pakistans security concerns in\n\norder to gain its full cooperation in the campaign against the\n\nirreconcilable elements of the Taliban.\n\nWill this result in ceding Afghanistan to the fundamentalists?\n\nPakistan wants to focus the war in Afghanistan rather than Pakistan\n\nand thus has different objectives to those of the US. So the US will\n\nhave to reconcile her objectives with those of the Pakistanis, to\n\ngain their cooperation.\n\n the United States should respect Latin Americas cultural and\n\nhistorical sensitivities and expand its contacts with Cuba;\n\nIs that another way of saying that the US should accept that they are\n\nsocialists?\n\n the United States ought to energize its commitment to significantly\n\nreducing its nuclear arsenal and embrace the eventual goal of a world\n\nfree of nuclear weapons;\n\nComing from the master of real politique, thats quite a fantasy.\n\n in coping with global problems, China should be treated not only as\n\nan economic partner but also as a geopolitical one;\n\n improving U.S.-Russian relations is in the obvious interest of both\n\nsides, although this must be done in a manner that accepts, rather\n\nthan seeks to undo, post-Cold War geopolitical realities; and\n\n a truly collegial transatlantic partnership should be given deeper\n\nmeaning, particularly in order to heal the rifts caused by the\n\ndestructive controversies of the past few years.\n\nQuite a workload.\n\nPEPIS #119 Bilderberg book out for Christmas\n\n9 Dec 2009\n\nI couldn't find a single proper review.

As the activists attempted to ask the former Secretary of State some probing questions, they were shoved and assaulted by Albright's entourage.\n\nAlbright spoke at the Borders bookstore in Chicago on Wednesday, October 7th to flog her book and to propagandize the public.\n\nAlbright, who is a Director of the Rockefeller/British-controlled Council on Foreign Relations, was told that the American people would not stand for another false flag attack like on 9/11.\n\nAnthony from WeAreChange Ohio stepped up and asked Albright about her appearance at the 2008 Bilderberg conference in Chantilly, Virginia. At first, Albright lied and said that she was not at the meeting but eyewitnesses had videotaped her arrival at the secret gathering.\n\nWhen notified of this fact, she backpeddled and said that she \"went in to pick somebody up.\"\n\nAlbright may be hesitant to admit her links to the Bilderberg Group because evidence has shown that the Bilderberg members intentionally planned to crash the U.S. economy in order to consolidate their economic power. In the film \"The Obama Deception\" by Alex Jones, author Daniel Estulin stated at the 2006 conference that members of the Bilderberg Group admitted that the group was planning to manipulate the housing market, create oil price fluctuations, and ultimately crash the economy.\n\nHer attendance at the Bilderberg meeting would also be considered a violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits U.S. citizens from interacting with a foreign government without the authority of the United States.\n\nAlbright and her entourage seemed to think that she was only going to get puffball questions from a sycophantic public. Anthony of WeAreChange Ohio stated emphatically, \"it was very interesting as soon as I asked her about Bilderberg, they said 'You can't ask any questions' and shoved me away!\" Both Anthony and Steve of We Are Change Chicago were immediately removed once they begin to question Albright.\n\nPEPIS#117 Completed masonic initiation rituals\n\nOct 20, 7:40 pm\n\nDear All,\n\n\"...I solemnly swear ... under no less a penalty than that of being severed in two, my body burnt to ashes and those ashes scattered over the face of earth and water by the four cardinal winds of heaven, that no trace or remembrance of so vile a wretch may longer be found among men...\" Sworn by the candidate in the Master Mason ritual\n\nThen, if you haven't understood the connections between Bilderberg and the inner core of freemasonry then this link should help. http://www.bilderberg.org/1998.htm#palmer Andrew Palmer organised the last Bilderberg conference to take place in Britain back in 1998.\n\nI suggest you also check out John Robison's 'Proofs Of A Conspiracy' and send it on to anyone you know who might be interested.\n\nhttp://www.bilderberg.org/lucis.htm\n\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/pc/index.htm\n\nNow, worrying news then good news, from France:\n\nIsrael planning New Year attack on Iran? http://www.ww4report.com/node/7833\n\nHistoric 9/11 Debate on French TV http://www.911forum.org.uk/board/viewtopic.php?t=18196\n\nbest wishes\n\nTony\n\nUnited Grand Lodge\n\nhttp://www.bilderberg.org/masons.htm#ritual_texts\n\nComplete texts of masonic rituals - three craft degrees and royal arch\n\nThe following rituals are copied directly from the small black (craft) and red (royal arch) books of masonic ritual given to candidates.

They became connected due to Carter's support from the Atlanta corporate elite, who had extensive ties to the Rockefellers. So in 1973, when David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski were picking people to join the Trilateral Commission, Carter was selected for membership. Carter thus attended every meeting, and even paid for his trip to the 1976 meeting in Japan with his campaign funds, as he was running for president at the time. Brzezinski was Carter's closest adviser, writing Carter's major campaign speeches.[73]\n\nWhen Jimmy Carter became President, he appointed over two-dozen members of the Trilateral Commission to key positions in his cabinet, among them, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who became National Security Adviser; Samuel P. Huntington, Coordinator of National Security and Deputy to Brzezinski; Harold Brown, Secretary of Defense; Warren Christopher, Deputy Secretary of State; Walter Mondale, Vice President; Cyrus Vance, Secretary of State; and in 1979, he appointed David Rockefeller's friend, Paul Volcker, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.[74]\n\nIn 1979, the Iranian Revolution spurred another massive increase in the price of oil. The Western nations, particularly the United States, had put a freeze on Iranian assets, \"effectively restricting the access of Iran to the global oil market, the Iranian assets freeze became a major factor in the huge oil price increases of 1979 and 1981.\"[75] Added to this, in 1979, British Petroleum cancelled major oil contracts for oil supply, which along with cancellations taken by Royal Dutch Shell, drove the price of oil up higher.[76]\n\nHowever, in 1979, the Federal Reserve, now the lynch-pin of the international monetary system, which was awash in petro-dollars (US dollars) as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, decided to take a different action from the one it had taken earlier. In August of 1979, \"on the advice of David Rockefeller and other influential voices of the Wall Street banking establishment, President Carter appointed Paul A. Volcker, the man who, back in August 1971, had been a key architect of the policy of taking the dollar off the gold standard, to head the Federal Reserve.\"[77]\n\nVolcker got his start as a staff economist at the New York Federal Reserve Bank in the early 50s. After five years there, \"David Rockefeller's Chase Bank lured him away.\"[78] So in 1957, Volcker went to work at Chase, where Rockefeller \"recruited him as his special assistant on a congressional commission on money and credit in America and for help, later, on an advisory commission to the Treasury Department.\"[79] In the early 60s, Volcker went to work in the Treasury Department, and returned to Chase in 1965 \"as an aide to Rockefeller, this time as vice president dealing with international business.\" With Nixon entering the White House, Volcker got the third highest job in the Treasury Department. This put him at the center of the decision making process behind the dissolution of the Bretton Woods agreement.[80] In 1973, Volcker became a member of Rockefeller's Trilateral Commission. In 1975, he got the job as President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the most powerful of the 12 branches of the Fed.\n\nIn 1979, Carter gave the job of Treasury Secretary to Arthur Miller, who had been Chairman of the Fed. This left an opening at the Fed, which was initially offered by Carter to David Rockefeller, who declined, and then to A.W. Clausen, Chairman of Bank of America, who also declined. Carter repeatedly tried to get Rockefeller to accept, and ultimately Rockefeller recommended Volcker for the job.[81] Volcker became Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, and immediately took drastic action to fight inflation by radically increasing interest rates.\n\nThe world was taken by shock. This was not a policy that would only be felt in the US with a recession, but was to send shock waves around the world, devastating the Third World debtor nations. This was likely the ultimate aim of the 1970s oil shocks and the 1979 Federal Reserve shock therapy. With the raising of interest rates, the cost of international money also rose. Thus, the interest rates on international loans made throughout the 1970s rose from 2% in the 1970s to 18% in the 1980s, dramatically increasing the interest charges on loans to developing countries.[82]\n\nIn the developing world, states that had to import oil faced enormous bills to cover their debts, and even oil producing countries, such as Mexico, faced huge problems as they had borrowed heavily in order to industrialize, and then suffered when oil prices fell again as the recession occurring in the developed states reduced demand. Thus, in 1982, Mexico declared that it could no longer pay its debt, meaning that, \"they could no longer cover the cost of interest payments, much less hope to repay the debt.\" The result was the bursting of the debt bubble. Banks then halted their loans to Mexico, and \"Before long it was evident that states such as Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and many sub-Saharan African countries were in equally difficult financial positions.\"[83]\n\nThe IMF and World Bank entered the scene newly refurnished with a whole new outlook and policy program designed just in time for the arrival of the debt crisis. The IMF \"negotiated standby loans with debtors offering temporary assistance to states in need. In return for the loans states agreed to undertake structural adjustment programs (SAPs). These programs entailed the liberalization of economies to trade and foreign investment as well as the reduction of state subsidies and bureaucracies to balance national budgets.\"[84] Thus, the neoliberal project of 1973 in Chile was expanded into the very functioning of the International Financial Institutions (IFIs).\n\nNeoliberalism is \"a particular organization of capitalism, which has evolved to protect capital(ism) and to reduce the power of labour. This is achieved by means of social, economic and political transformations imposed by internal forces as well as external pressure,\" and it entails the \"shameless use of foreign aid, debt relief and balance of payments support to promote the neoliberal programme, and diplomatic pressure, political unrest and military intervention when necessary.\"[85] Further, \"neoliberalism is part of a hegemonic project concentrating power and wealth in elite groups around the world, benefiting especially the financial interests within each country, and US capital internationally. Therefore, globalization and imperialism cannot be analysed separately from neoliberalism.\"[86]\n\nJoseph Stiglitz, former Chief Economist of the World Bank, wrote in his book, Globalization and its Discontents, \"In the 1980s, the Bank went beyond just lending for projects (like roads and dams) to providing broad-based support, in the form of structural adjustment loans; but it did this only when the IMF gave its approval - and with that approval came IMF-imposed conditions on the country.\"[87] As economist Michel Chossudovsky wrote, \"Because countries were indebted, the Bretton Woods institutions were able to oblige them through the so- called 'conditionalities' attached to the loan agreements to appropriately redirect their macro-economic policy in accordance with the interests of the official and commercial creditors.\"[88]\n\nThe nature of SAPs is such that the conditions imposed upon countries that sign onto these agreements include: lowering budget deficits, devaluing the currency, limiting government borrowing from the central bank, liberalizing foreign trade, reducing public sector wages, price liberalization, deregulation and altering interest rates.[89] For reducing budget deficits, \"precise 'ceilings' are placed on all categories of expenditure; the state is no longer permitted to mobilize its own resources for the building of public infrastructure, roads, or hospitals, etc.\"[90]\n\nJoseph Stiglitz wrote that, \"the IMF staff monitored progress, not just on the relevant indicators for sound macromanagement - inflation, growth, and unemployment - but on intermediate variables, such as the money supply,\" and that \"In some cases the agreements stipulated what laws the country's Parliament would have to pass to meet IMF requirements or 'targets' - and by when.\"[91] Further, \"The conditions went beyond economics into areas that properly belong in the realm of politics,\" and that \"the way conditionality was imposed made the conditions politically unsustainable; when a new government came into power, they would be abandoned. Such conditions were seen as the intrusion by the new colonial power on the country's own sovereignty.\"[92]\n\n\"The phrase 'Washington Consensus' was coined to capture the agreement upon economic policy that was shared between the two major international financial institutions in Washington (IMF and World Bank) and the US government itself. This consensus stipulated that the best path to economic development was through financial and trade liberalization and that international institutions should persuade countries to adopt such measures as quickly as possible.\"[93] The debt crisis provided the perfect opportunity to quickly impose these conditions upon countries that were not in a position to negotiate and with no time to spare, desperately in need of loans. Without the debt crisis, such policies may have been subject to greater scrutiny, and with a case-by-case analysis of countries adopting SAPs, the world would become quickly aware of their dangerous implications. The debt crisis was absolutely necessary in implementing the SAPs on an international scale in a short amount of time.\n\nThe effect became quite clear, as the result \"of these policies on the population of developing countries was devastating. The 1980s is known as the 'lost decade' of development. Many developing countries' economies were smaller and poorer in 1990 than in 1980. Over the 1980s and 1990s, debt in many developing countries was so great that governments had few resources to spend on social services and development.\"[94] With the debt crisis, countries in the developing world were \"[s]tarved of international finance, [and] states had little choice but to open their economies to foreign investors and trade.\"[95] The \"Third World\" was recaptured in the cold grasp of economic colonialism under the auspices of neo-liberal economic theory.\n\nA Return to Statist Theory\n\nSince the 1970s, mercantilist thought had re-emerged in mainstream political-economic theory. Under various names such as neo- mercantilism, economic nationalism or statism, they hold as vital the centrality of the state in the global political economy. Much \"Globalization\" literature puts an emphasis on the \"decline of the state\" in the face of an integrated international economic order, where borders are made illusory. However, statist theory at least helps us understand that the state is still a vital factor within the global political economy, even in the midst of a neo-liberal economic order.\n\nWithin the neo-liberal economic order, it was the powerful western (primarily US and Western European) states that imposed neo- mercantilist or statist policies in order to protect and promote their interests within the global political economy. Some of these methods were revolved around policy tools such as export subsidies, imposed to lower the price of goods, which would make them more attractive to importers, giving that particular nation an advantage over the competition.\n\nFor example, the US has enormous agriculture export subsidies, which make US agriculture and grain an easily affordable, attractive and accessible commodity for importing nations. Countries of the global south (the Lesser-Developed Countries, LDCs), subject to neo-liberal policies imposed upon them by the World Bank and IMF were forced to open their economies up to foreign capital. The World Bank would bring in heavily subsidized US grain to these poor nations under the guise of \"food aid,\" which would have the affect of destabilizing the nation's agriculture market, as the heavily subsidized US grains would be cheaper than local produce, putting farmers out of business. Most LDCs are predominantly rural based, so when the farming sector is devastated, so too is the entire nation. They plunge into economic crisis and even famine.\n\nWith the statist approach, theorists examine how the state is still relevant in shaping economic outcomes and still remains a powerful entity in the international arena. One theorist who is prominent within the statist school is Robert Gilpin. Gilpin, a professor at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. In his book, Global Political Economy, Gilpin postulated that multinational corporations were an invention of the United States, and indeed an \"American phenomenon\" upon which European and Asian states responded by internationalizing their own firms. In this sense, his theory postulated to a return to the competitive nature of mercantilist economic theory, in which one state gains at the expense of another. He also addresses the nature of the international economy, in that both historically and presently, there was a single state acting as the main enforcer and manager of the global economy. Historically, it was Britain, and presently, it was the United States.\n\nOne cannot deny the significance of the state in the global political economy, as it has been, and still remains very relevant. The events of 1973 are exemplary of this, however, more must be examined in order to better understand the situation. Though states are still prominent actors, it is vital to address in whose interest they act. Mercantilist and statist theorists tend to focus on the concept that states act in their own selfish interest, for the benefit of the state, both politically and economically. However, this is somewhat linear and diversionary, as it does not address the precise structure of the state economy, specifically in terms of its monetary and central banking system.\n\nStates, most especially the large hegemonic ones, such as the United States and Great Britain, are controlled by the international central banking system, working through secret agreements at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and operating through national central banks (such as the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve). The state is thus owned by an international banking cartel, and though the state acts in such a way that proves its continual relevance in the global economy, it acts so not in terms of self-interest for the state itself, but for the powerful interests that control that state. The same international banking cartel that controls the United States today previously controlled Great Britain and held it up as the international hegemon. When the British order faded, and was replaced by the United States, the US ran the global economy. However, the same interests are served. States will be used and discarded at will by the international banking cartel; they are simply tools.\n\nIn this sense, interdependence theory, which presumes the decline of the state in international affairs, fails to acknowledge the role of the state in promoting and undertaking the process of interdependence. The decline of the nation-state is a state-driven process, and is a process that leads to a rise of the continental state and the global state. States, are still very relevant, but both liberal and mercantilist theorists, while helpful in understanding the concepts behind the global economy, lay the theoretical groundwork for a political economic agenda being undertaken by powerful interests. Like Robert Cox said, \"Theory is always for someone and for some purpose.\"\n\nHegemonic-Stability Theory\n\nIn his book, Global Political Economy, Gilpin explained that, \"In time, if unchecked, the integration of an economy into the world economy, the intensifying pressures of foreign competition, and the necessity to be efficient in order to survive economically could undermine the independence of a society and force it to adopt new values and forms of social organization. Fear that economic globalization and the integration of national markets are destroying or could destroy the political, economic, and cultural autonomy of national societies has become widespread.\"[96]\n\nHowever, Gilpin explains that the \"Creation of effective international regimes and solutions to the compliance problem require both strong international leadership and an effective international governance structure.\" Yet, he explains, \"Regimes in themselves cannot provide governance structure because they lack the most critical component of governance - the power to enforce compliance. Regimes must rest instead on a political base established through leadership and cooperation.\"[97] This is where we see the emergence of Hegemonic Stability Theory.\n\nGilpin explains that, \"The theory of hegemonic stability posits that the leader or hegemon facilitates international cooperation and prevents defection from the rules of the regime through use of side payments (bribes), sanctions, and/or other means, but can seldom, if ever, coerce reluctant states to obey the rules of a liberal international economic order.\" As he explained, \"The American hegemon did indeed play a crucial role in establishing and managing the world economy following World War II.\"[98]\n\nThe roots of Hegemonic Stability Theory (HST) lie within both liberal and statist theory, as it is representative of a crossover theory that cannot be so easily placed in either category. The main concept champions the liberal notion of the open international economic system, guided by liberal principles of open-markets and free trade, while bringing in the statist concept of a single hegemonic state representing the concentration of political and economic power, as it is the enforcer of the liberal international economy.\n\nThe more liberal-leaning theorists of HST argue that a liberal economic order requires a strong, hegemonic state to maintain the smooth functioning of the international economy. One thing this state must do is maintain the international monetary system, as Britain did under the gold standard and the United States did under the Dollar- Wall Street Regime, following the end of the Bretton-Woods dollar-gold link.\n\nRegime Theory Regime Theory is another crossover theory between liberal and mercantilist theorists. Its rise was primarily in reaction to the emergence of Hegemonic Stability Theory, in order to address the concern of a perceived decline in the power of the US. This was due to the rise of new economic powers in the 1970s, and another major purveyor of this theory was Robert Keohane. They needed to address how the international order could be maintained as the hegemonic power declined. The answer was in the building of international organizations to manage the international regime.\n\nIn this sense, Regime Theory has identified an important aspect of the global political economy, in that though states have upheld the international order in the past, never before has there been such an undertaking to institutionalize the authority over the international order through international organizations. These organizations, such as the World Bank, IMF, UN, and WTO, though still controlled and influenced by states, predominantly the international hegemon, the United States, represent a changing direction of internationalization and transnationalism. Regime Theorists tend to justify the formation of a more transnational apparatus of power, beyond just a single hegemonic state, into a more internationalized structure of authority.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] CBC, Informal forum or global conspiracy?
