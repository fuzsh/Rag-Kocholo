        "text": "It turns out that Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, one of the first two men on the moon, not only helped make that giant step for mankind, but made one for Christianity as well. In London, Dr. Thomas Paine, former chief of NASA, disclosed that during radio blackout Aldrin opened two little plastic packages, one containing bread, the other wine. “I poured the wine into the chalice which our church [Webster Presbyterian Church] had given me,” Aldrin radioed later to Houston. “In the one-sixth gravity of the moon, the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon and the first food eaten there were Communion elements. Just before I partook of the elements, I read the words which I had chosen to indicate our trust: John 15: 5, ‘I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit.’ ”\n\nRoyalty, like well-mannered children, should be seen and not heard. That is why naughty Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands was scolded and put in a corner last week by Dutch Prime Minister Barend Biesheuvel. The prince had sounded off in a newspaper interview about the country’s system of parliamentary democracy; the Cabinet, he suggested, should be immune to parliamentary interference for periods of one or two years at a stretch. Said Bernhard: “The government could then really get down to some work without having to spend half its time answering questions in Parliament.” The predictable uproar that resulted finally died down when Prime Minister Biesheuvel assured Parliament that he had told Bernhard in no uncertain terms to button his royal lip.\n\nFood was running low that winter in the Klondike, and the jumpy little hero of the 1925 hit, The Gold Rush, was reduced to dining on boiled shoe. In London to work on the music for some of his old movies that he is rereleasing.\n\nCharlie Chaplin—82, and no longer as jumpy and little as he used to be—tried to look as if he were getting a real boot out of a publicity reprise of one of his more famous scenes.\n\nThe war between Lieut. Colonel Anthony B. Herbert and the U.S. Army (TIME, March 22) continues at a level of light skirmishing and enfilading fire. After repeated requests for permission to make a second appearance on the Dick Cavett Show, Combat Hero Herbert finally got an O.K. from his commanding officer, Colonel Tom Reid, five minutes before the taping was scheduled to begin eleven miles away. Cavett instead reran the earlier program, in which the Korean War’s most decorated hero told of his demotion and disgrace when he reported instances of war crimes in Viet Nam. Early next morning, Herbert was summoned to Colonel Reid’s office. “Informed sources” report the following exchange on the subject of Lieut. Colonel Herbert’s saluting style:\n\nReid: Close your fingers.\n\nHerbert: I think they are closed, sir.\n\nReid: Tilt your hand.\n\nHerbert: I think it is tilted, sir.\n\nReid: Tilt your fingers in so you can see them.\n\nHerbert: Like this, sir?\n\nReid: You slurred the word sir. Say it sharp.\n\nPaying off a World Series bet, Maryland Republican Senators Charles Mathias and J. Glenn Beall Jr.—Baltimore Oriole fans to the end—dutifully led two elephants around to the front of the Capitol. Riding the pachyderms and still gloating over the triumph of the Pittsburgh Pirates were Pennsylvania Republican Senators Hugh Scott and Richard Schweiker. Later, Senator Scott met the visiting King and Queen of Sikkim and told them about his lofty ride. “Didn’t you use a ladder to mount?” asked the Queen, onetime Manhattan Debutante Hope Cooke. “In Sikkim, we always use a ladder.” Said Scott: “We like to rough it in our country.”\n\nDressing women has long been the bag of Couturier Yves St. Laurent. Nobody knows better than he the way to a lady’s checkbook. The way to a man’s, though, seems to have been too much of a problem for the flame-haired designer. To plug his new line of male fragrances, St. Laurent simply took all his clothes off and collapsed in a full-page advertising spread in the French edition of Vogue. The Paris Couturiers’ Association unofficially declared itself “astonished.” Vogue admitted it was “a little surprised.” Said Yves, “I wanted shock. But you’ll notice I have a halo to give a biblical look.”\n\nSince it is the world’s largest corporation, there are probably more alcoholics at General Motors than at any other company. Board Chairman James M. Roche has announced that G.M. will try to find them, then fire them if they refuse the free treatment provided by the company’s medical-insurance program. Those successfully treated will be kept on—business conditions permitting—”the same as if they were out for a heart attack.” U.S. industry loses $8 billion to $10 billion a year because of alcoholism, said Roche, and “ignoring the alcoholic until it is too late is not only a waste of human abilities and industrial funds, it is, in the long run, an inhumanity to the individuals involved.”\n\nWhile talking to black Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm about her candidacy for the White House, New York Representative Edward I. Koch put his tongue firmly in his cheek and asked her if she would consider him as a running mate. “No, Ed,” muskied Mrs. Chisholm. “I don’t think the country is ready for a Jewish Vice President.”"
