How did that happen and what consequences did it have? These are the core questions addressed in this book. The answers to these questions are encapsulated in a history that is often dominated by misconceptions. The history of European integration is regularly and grossly oversimplified. The incomprehension, the controversy and the amazement that the integration process so often invokes call for the development of concepts and theories to explain how it is possible that things go the way they go in ‘Europe’. The process has always led to heated debate and sharp differences of opinion, not to mention an overfull international library of documentation, which continues to expand. But exactly what European integration is we do not (yet) know. If – after substantial study in that international library – one thing becomes clear, it is that in the history of European integration, very little is what it seems to be. If possible, that applies even more to the Netherlands’ role in that process. This is perhaps because the shelves in the library annexe dealing specifically with Dutch policy are relatively empty. But perhaps it is also because, in the years following the Second World War, the Netherlands focused more on international cooperation that reached beyond Western Europe. At that time, it was more enthusiastic about transatlantic organisation and free trade than European integration. That preference did not make the Netherlands’ starting position in Europe any easier and has been a complicating factor in the history of its involvement in European integration. It is a history that has continually been played out in an extensive twilight world between dream and reality – a world that mostly remains hidden, overshadowed by the apparent logic of rationalisations made with hindsight. That is partly why that world has received little attention in existing explanations of the how and why of Dutch engagement in Europe. It is relatively simple to explain with hindsight why the Netherlands had little choice in taking part in the process of European integration: the material benefits were (and still are) enormous and disproportionate. That is easy to say looking back from where we are now but, at the moment the decisions were made, Europe was often much more complex. The history of European integration is made even more impenetrable by the thick mist surrounding its final goal. That vagueness makes ideal types and blueprints seem much more realistic than they actually are. And that not only leads to much teleological debate about the future of\n\n8\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nthe EU and the deterministic models in which it is framed (a federation, superstate or nation-state); it also makes it difficult to analyse the history of integration, which can only be achieved if historical facts can be clearly distinguished from the rhetoric surrounding the final goal – and that is no simple task. Attempts to do so have a chance of succeeding only if they include a study of the primary sources: sources that can tell us something about the circumstances and ideas prevailing at moments when decisions were made to take important steps towards integration – or not. Most relevant primary sources are accessible to researchers only after thirty years. Consequently, international research into the history of European integration did not really start until the beginning of the 1980s (it now extends up to the end of the 1970s/early 1980s). Since then, time and time again, one conclusion proves inescapable: none of the parties involved – the governments of the member states, European institutions and their predecessors, the business community, lobbies, political parties, individuals, etc. – have ever been able to control the integration process, let alone dominate it, not even for a short time. The process has been uncontrollable from the very beginning, even for the United States. The ‘normal’ situation in the history of European integration comes close to one of chaos. In the midst of the unpredictable circumstances that such a situation generates, emotions, coincidence and intrigues have often been (and still are) more decisive than policy choices made on the basis of rational consideration. That makes the history of European integration, in the first place, political: it is the art of achieving what is possible in unforeseen circumstances. Some of those involved have had better command of that art than others. It is often difficult to predict how political processes will develop, especially if there is great uncertainty and when a large number of widely varying actors are involved. For the different actors in Europe, therefore, it is more often a matter of responding and anticipating than creating. For the Netherlands, as for the other member states, the integration process was primarily something that happened to the country. It was, at crucial moments, even overwhelmed. That had much to do with the gaping hole between the European reality and how it was presented in The Hague. In the Netherlands, it was long believed – and asserted – that the final destination of the whole European integration project could not be understood within the borders of continental Western Europe. Although this is exactly how integration proceeded from the start of the 1950s onwards (and would continue to do so until the early 1970s), the Netherlands still had its sights set elsewhere. Its future was to be Atlantic. At the same time, however,\n\nPreface\n\n9\n\nits reality became increasingly continental European, and especially more German. In the post-war period, the Netherlands kept up this pretence, with one foot in reality and the other in its interpretation of that reality, for an alarmingly long time. It is this delicate balancing act that is central to the history of Dutch involvement in European integration. And that is where the Netherlands differs from its European partners. Like the other five founders of the European project, from 1950 the Netherlands embarked on a journey to the continent – away from a past of world wars and global ambitions to a much smaller world of Western bloc-forming and, especially, Western European cooperation. But mentally, the Netherlands travelled somewhere else. It wanted to go to a different destination than the one it was heading towards ‘physically’, i.e. economically and politically. This book is about the history of those two journeys – the mental one and the physical one. The account of those journeys is at the heart of the book. It is a story full of drama. But that drama is mostly hidden away in technical policy dossiers – behind their dry and rational exterior, the most unpredictable political battles have been fought out. To make the journey, therefore, the reader also has to plunge into the dossiers and become familiar with the economic and monetary methods found within them. That can often be more exciting than you might imagine. Reading between the lines in the policy dossiers reveals unexpected facts. And, at least as important, a close reading of the dossiers often provides a deeper understanding of the political processes behind them. To analyse how the Netherlands responded to European developments, it is crucial to reconstruct European reality. And that is only possible by adopting a multinational perspective. This book is thus based on archive material not only from the Netherlands but also from elsewhere. The analysis rests, to a significant degree, on new or as yet unknown source material from within and outside the Netherlands. In addition, it ties in with recent insights from international research into the history of European integration. Any sources quoted in languages other than English have been translated where necessary, in the interests of readability. This attention for the international and European context means that the account in this book is not only about the Netherlands and its role in European integration but also addresses issues like European power relations, the international economy and the ‘high politics’ of the Cold War. Consequently, to make it clear to the reader what situation the Netherlands found itself in, the discussion is often less directly about the Netherlands than the reader might expect. Much attention is also given to other states involved in the process of European integration, such as France, Germany, the\n\n10\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nUnited States and the United Kingdom. That context is mostly indispensable in understanding why the situation developed as it did in the Netherlands, and in analysing the Netherlands’ positions, choices and dilemmas. Clearly, in a book like this, certain themes will be explored in greater detail than others. The choices I have made are derived from two main areas of attention. Firstly, I focus on the start of the integration process and the position originally taken by the Netherlands in relation to that process; much of what happened later can be traced back to that starting point. Secondly, I look at the actual steps and developments taken in the process of European integration: facts, treaties, failures, etc. – in short, things that were actually achieved or took place and were relevant to European integration between 1950 and the present day. Other approaches are, of course, possible and indeed desirable. It would be a welcome development if this book were to encourage more substantive debate and follow-up research on the Netherlands and Europe. The history of European integration is still being written. The current episode in that history is dominated by crisis. That is raising pressing existential questions about how the integration process should move forward. The Netherlands is clearly grappling with these questions, and a book such as this can hardly ignore these developments as they unfold in front of our eyes. The prelude to the current state of affairs is the main theme of the final chapter, which focuses on the ‘new’ post-1989 Europe, the old and new issues that this brings with it, and their significance for the Netherlands. Because primary sources for the most recent period are not yet or hardly accessible, this last chapter is somewhat more reflective. It is simply not possible to reconstruct the history of the past 25 years in the same way as that preceding it. The repercussions of many developments from the recent period, such as the substantial expansion of the EU with new member states from Central and Eastern Europe and as yet barely successful attempts by the EU to present a more united profile in the international political arena after the Cold War, cannot yet be clearly estimated. What the last 25 years of European integration do force us to confront is the far-reaching significance of a Europe of the euro, the money and the banks. That Europe has actually been achieved. The deep grooves that the eurocrisis has gouged across the EU and its member states have pushed the history of that same EU towards other, new perspectives. It is difficult as yet to see what they are, but we can already conclude that the origins of the monetary dimension of European integration will perhaps prove even more important for the history of integration than was long asserted, believed or estimated. That is one reason why the history of the European\n\nPreface\n\n11\n\nEconomic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the euro is a central theme in this book. In many respects, that history remains under-researched and even less understood. This book, and chapter 6 in particular, therefore devotes considerable attention to the origins and development of the EMU. The Netherlands’ role in the history of European integration clearly shows how the pressure to deepen monetary cooperation drove the integration process long before the Treaty of Maastricht and the introduction of the euro. The pre-history of the EMU explains much of how and why the Netherlands resolutely persisted in keeping a foot in both the European and Atlantic camps, first until 1989 and even, under duress, for several years after that. In addition, the history of the EMU provides new insights into the tangled state of crisis in which the Europe of today (and tomorrow) finds itself. The current state of Europe calls for an urgent re-interpretation of existing explanations of the integration process. What exactly are we facing? The history of European integration – including the Netherlands’ part in that history – has become different since 1989 from what it seemed to be before. For the time being at least, European integration seems viable without the Cold War and the Pax Americana, and in the context of the unprecedented transatlantic rift. But is that really true, or just an illusion? And if it is true, how is it possible? These questions are the most important parts of the puzzle currently facing researchers of European integration. That is why this book not only ends with an epilogue on Europe and the Netherlands after the Cold War but starts with a prologue set in 1989, the most important historical turning point in the history of European integration to date. Mathieu Segers Amersfoort, January 2013 and Maastricht, August 2018\n\nPrologue: Dinner in Laeken (1989) Abstract The period immediately following the fall of the Berlin Wall is key to studying the Netherlands’ role in European integration. After a brief moment of paralysing doubt, this unbelievable turnaround was celebrated as a victory after Europe’s horrific recent history. But when the dust began to settle, the Netherlands found itself in an uneasy position. The Treaty of Maastricht (1992) made German unification and European integration ‘two sides of the same coin’, catapulting the Netherlands into a political situation comparable to that of the 1950s. On the euro’s debut, the country once again became part of a continental circle in which France and Germany set the pace while the UK, Denmark and Sweden wished the Netherlands luck from the sidelines. Keywords: Treaty of Maastricht, European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), German unification, Franco-German relations, end of the Cold War, Helmut Kohl\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 marked the beginning of a series of radical historic changes in Germany, Europe and the world. Clearly, much would be very different than it had been in the preceding decades, especially in Europe. But how exactly things would be different was less clear. A majority of the Netherlands’ partners quickly clung tightly to the process of further European integration which, in those uncertain times, seemed to offer a beacon of stability. It also offered tried and tested ways of achieving reconciliation with Europe’s dark past – which now, after the fall of the Wall, was once again very topical. The year 1989 offers a unique starting point for examining the history of European integration, as the member states involved in the process were abruptly compelled to fall back on the values that they had relied upon in their post-war foreign and European policies. What were those values? The widely varying ways in which the member states answered this question revealed much about the past history of\n\nSegers, Mathieu, The Netherlands and European Integration, 1950 to Present.

That is why this book starts in the midst of the exciting developments of 1989. At that moment, the Netherlands was not at the centre of events – and this would not be the first time. Much in Europe happened (and happens) without the Netherlands being directly involved. Sometimes, that was a deliberate choice, but more often it was not. Most of the time, the Netherlands would have liked things to have been different. To understand the Netherlands’ attitude to European integration, knowledge of European reality can be more useful than knowing how the Netherlands interprets it. It was European reality, much more than that of The Hague, that dictated the Netherlands’ options for action. That is no different now. And within that European reality, the Netherlands usually – and often more or less consciously – stands in the wings. That is why this book starts with an event that took place outside the Netherlands. The opening scene is a confidential conversation between the Netherlands’ two most important post-war partners. The location is the capital of Belgium; the date, early December 1989. On the eve of the NATO summit in Brussels on 4 December 1989, US President George Bush went to Stuyvenberg Castle, a residence of the Belgian Royal family in the Brussels suburb of Laeken, for a dinner with the West German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Earlier that day, Bush had arrived from Malta where he had had a two-day summit meeting with Soviet leader Michael Gorbachev. The summit on the Mediterranean island had been an exceptional event. Initially, the leaders were to meet alternately on naval vessels of the two superpowers, which were moored just off the coast: the cruiser USS Belknap, the flagship of the US Sixth Fleet, and the Soviet cruisers Slava and Maxim Gorki. But things turned out differently than planned. On the night of 2 December, the Maltese coast was hit by a fierce storm. As evening fell, the Americans had watched as the officers’ sloop had been smashed to pieces on the starboard deck of the Belknap. It was clear that the American delegation would have to enjoy the festive meal in the absence of their main guest and his entourage. The meeting on the Slava, which lay at anchor further off the coast, had already been cancelled earlier, because Gorbachev did not want to take any chances with the storm. Consequently, what should have been four meetings on different ships ended up as two afternoon sessions on the comfortable Maxim Gorki, which lay safely in port. The extreme circumstances in and around the port of Valetta, the Maltese capital, formed the backdrop to a historic breakthrough. It would mark the start of the end of the Cold War and act as a catalyst for peaceful German\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n15\n\nunification exactly ten months later – though that was unimaginable at the time. The summit ended on 3 December with the first joint press conference in the history of relations between the US and the Soviet Union – a hopeful omen. The American delegation in any case were confident that an important step had been taken towards mutual trust. They were moreover convinced that Gorbachev might perhaps from then on be less concerned that the Americans would take advantage of the situation in Eastern Europe, where a number of Soviet states were grappling with democratic revolutions. After his press conference with Gorbachev on 3 December, Bush continued on to Belgium for the NATO summit a day later. He had declined an invitation from French president François Mitterrand to travel to Brussels via the south of France.1 He preferred to dine with Helmut Kohl. Some weeks earlier, on 9 November, the Berlin Wall had fallen. Since then, a wave of radical changes had swept not only Eastern Europe but the whole world. There were glimmers of a Western victory in the Cold War and of Germany being reunited. And history had taught that, at such times, violence was a real threat. The quarantine in which the German question had been placed after the Second World War had been continually extended by the Cold War and had been consolidated, since 1961, in the form of a real wall. But now, after more than four decades of stability, that comforting situation had been thrown up in the air from one moment to the next by developments in Germany. This was certain to have far-reaching consequences. After gathering dust for 44 years, the non-decisions of Yalta and Potsdam on which the world order was built were once again laid large as life on the table of international politics. And international relations, which had been frozen into the bipolar mould of the Cold War, were ready to explode. International law offered little solace. After all, the essence of the ‘Yalta order’ was that, after the Second World War, there had been no peace agreement signed with (and regarding) Germany. The post-war borders were provisional. The whole system of German, European and global division was based on the confrontation between East and West. For Europe, it had proved to be an unprecedentedly stable and peaceful arrangement. And now, that was all starting to shift. What did it mean? At what point in history did Germany, Europe and the world find itself in now? The most logical answer was: back in 1945. Or was it 1939? What if Germany had the audacity to claim its rights to the pre-war borders and call into question the provisional Oder-Neisse border with Poland, which was at the heart of the Yalta order? British prime 1\n\nGeorge Bush and Brent Scowcroft, A World Transformed (New York: Vintage, 1998), pp. 160-173.\n\n16\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nminister Margaret Thatcher had in any case put a map into her handbag showing Germany’s different past geographical boundaries (1871, 1939, etc.) to warn her fellow allies of what could happen. Her historical map was ‘not altogether reassuring’.2 During a hastily arranged summit of the heads of government of the European Community on 18 November in Paris, two weeks before his dinner with George Bush in Laeken, it became clear to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl just how far his European partners had indeed moved back in the direction of 1945 and how quickly mistrust of Germany and the Germans was increasing. France, which held the presidency of the European Community in the second half of 1989, had called the extra summit. According to Paris, what was at stake was nothing less than ‘saving the Community’. The summit discussed more extensive aid programmes for reform-minded states in Central and Eastern Europe. During the talks, Kohl was dismayed to discover that the subject of German unification was taboo: not a single word was said about it. It was bizarre, as though the Berlin Wall had not fallen on 9 November at all. The elephant was in the middle of the room, but everyone pretended it was not there. Kohl had initially decided to go along with this mass exercise in denial, but during dessert, Margaret Thatcher broke the spell and launched a frontal attack. According to the British prime minister, any thoughts of German unification were preposterous. Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers agreed entirely.3 When Kohl replied that NATO had formally been positive about German unification since 1970, Thatcher was beside herself with rage. Stamping her feet, she snapped at Kohl that the declaration he referred to dated from a time when everyone was convinced that German reunification would never become a reality. Any review of the post-war borders was out of the question – and that applied equally to the border between East and West Germany! It was a shocking experience for Kohl, especially as this hysterical response was openly supported by his Christian Democrat colleague Lubbers and silently approved by the other leaders present at the summit. 4 Kohl saw the writing on the wall. Western Europe – which was also his Western Europe – was being overwhelmed by old fear reflexes triggered by the developments in Germany. This was a painful and tragic conclusion for a West German, but it was perhaps understandable and inevitable. Either way, Western European mistrust of the Germans and of the chancellor 2 3 4\n\nMargaret Thatcher, The Downing Street Years (New York: Harper Collins, 1993), p. 796.

How different was the openness he experienced during that dinner in Laeken. The contrast could hardly have been greater. Five days earlier, Kohl had made use of the budget debate in the Bundestag to present his ten-point plan for the unification of Germany. Even though Kohl’s announcement had surprised practically everyone – friend and foe at home and abroad – and had placed Gorbachev, already forced into a corner by the developments, under greater pressure – something that the Americans were very concerned about – it did nothing to upset the atmosphere of trust between the two leaders. There was a good reason for the deep mutual trust between Bush and Kohl that evening. Bush was the only one of Kohl’s international partners who had been informed beforehand of the bold unilateral political course that the chancellor announced at the end of November.\n\nKohl’s great leap forward At a meeting of Kohl’s communications staff on the evening of 23 November, Horst Teltschik – Director General at the German Chancellery and for many years a close confidant of the chancellor – had argued forcefully in favour of taking a bold step. Teltschik impressed on Kohl that if he wanted to influence the course of history, he had to act now. Through his contacts in the Soviet Union, it had recently become painfully clear to Teltschik that Moscow already had advanced plans for the future of Germany. These plans were essentially old wine in new bottles. They were based on the Yalta order and assumed that the Occupation Statute still applied and that the former occupying powers had the right to decide Germany’s future – as though nothing had changed since 1945! The most alarming aspect of all was that at that point Bonn did not have even the bare bones of a plan for a unified Germany. Teltschik continued to insist that it was time to take the initiative quickly. But he encountered fierce resistance from his colleagues, who found his pleas impetuous. They felt that such audacious behaviour by the chancellor could especially have a counterproductive effect on the people of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Nevertheless, the communications staff produced a memorandum that the chancellor could take along in his weekend bag, laying out a ten-stage plan for German unification. It was up to the chancellor to decide what to do with it. The general mood among the experts was clear: restraint was better than causing a stir.\n\n18\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nThe memorandum from the communications staff sketched out the main outlines of the development of a treaty-based community between the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the GDR via a confederation between the two Germanies, with the ultimate aim of a single German federation. This would, of course, all take place within the framework of the overall European and multilateral relations and partnerships that West Germany had entered into in the post-war period. If such a route to unification could be completed before the end of the millennium, it would be a ‘Glücksfall der Geschichte’, a stroke of historical luck.5 In the weekend of 25 and 26 November, Kohl himself set to work on the ten points. At home, in his bungalow in Ludwigshafen, he focused especially on the passages about ‘confederation’ and ‘federation’. The chancellor rewrote the memorandum without his official staff, but he was not alone. He was assisted by his wife Hannelore and Erich and Fritz Ramstetter, local Catholic priests (who were brothers) whom Kohl often consulted. Kohl also called CDU member of parliament Rupert Scholz, a professor of constitutional law in Munich, to discuss specific points. The final ten-point plan contained concrete measures to facilitate travel between the GDR and West Germany and confirmed the West-German government’s commitment to economic and political cooperation. It stated emphatically that this depended on far-reaching democratic reforms and the creation of conditions for a market economy in East Germany. These changes, laid out in the first three points, also had to be ‘irreversible’. Only in this way could they form the basis of an increasingly close community between the two states (point 4). The treaty-based community would be the first step towards the second phase (a short period of confederation) and third phase of unification (federation). The period of confederation would have to be short to prevent the institutionalisation of two states existing alongside each other (point 5). The process of German unification had to be embedded in a pan-European security concept, the ongoing process of European integration and the pan-European cooperation process within the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), all within the framework of new measures to precipitate further disarmament (points 6-9). The completion of the ten-point plan would entail the creation of a federation leading to a unified Germany (point 10).6 5 Horst Teltschik, 329 Tage: Innenansichten der Einigung (Berlin: Siedler, 1991), p. 52. 6 Bundesministerium des Innern unter Mitwirkung des Bundesarchivs, Dokumente zur Deutschlandpolitik.

For Germany’s former enemies in Europe – with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France at the forefront – this was tantamount to standing the world on its head. Kohl brazenly staked a claim for German unification and, in doing so, denied the realities of post-war history. The fact that he had dared to do this, without prior consultation, was seen as an ominous sign. The American government responded differently. Washington acknowledged that, by presenting the ten-point plan, Kohl had unequivocally taken the initiative. In doing so, the chancellor had not only taken the wind out of the sails of the plan for a permanent treaty-based community, as presented earlier by East German leader Hans Modrow, he had also unleashed among the people of Germany the exciting prospect of a rapid process of unification. This was to give his popularity a great boost, as was clear from the broad support with which his plan was received in the Federal Republic.7 In the midst of all this tumult, the US government was decisive and placatory. Washington was anxious not to turn against Kohl or to publicly question his initiative. The US covered the chancellor’s back and allowed him to take the lead in the process of unification. In so doing, the Bush administration forged an American-German axis around which everything would eventually turn. The official reaction from Washington was announced the day after the presentation of the ten-point plan. Secretary of State James Baker’s press conference was initially aimed at ensuring that Kohl’s somewhat impetuous act did not provoke Gorbachev.8 The US took a simple and hard-line position. In that way, it could both take the sting out of the situation and give it direction. Baker explained that German unification had to be a gradual process based on self-determination and taking account of the inviolability of the post-war borders which, under the terms of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Helsinki in 1975, could only be changed through peaceful means. And, without batting an eyelid, Washington laid one other sine qua non on the table: the US would only agree to German unification if the reunified Germany became a member of NATO, the embodiment of the Western alliance and Western solidarity in the Cold War. In this way, Kohl’s great leap forward was coupled to an equally breathtaking leap forward by the Americans. The hopes for a rapid unification were 7 DzDPDE, Conversation between Kohl and Bush, Laeken, 3 December 1989, pp. 604-5. 8 Philip Zelikow and Condoleeza Rice, Germany Unified and Europe Transformed (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 118-121.\n\n20\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nstill alive and kicking, but the US position had linked it irrevocable to the rapid triumph of the West in the Cold War. After the presentation of the ten-point plan and Baker’s press conference, there was little doubt about who was pulling the strings or where the initiative now lay. The AmericanGerman axis was turning at full power and had already been doing so for some time. Kohl had, for example, been closely involved in the preparations for Bush’s meeting with Gorbachev off the Maltese coast.9 During the dinner in Laeken, Bush and Kohl agreed that they had to make sure that Gorbachev stayed in the Kremlin. It was their responsibility to make the Soviet leader the ‘advocate of peaceful change’ that they both believed he could be.10 That was a little too much like wishful thinking, as it would have called not only for Gorbachev to elect voluntarily for the unification of Germany – the Soviet Union’s archenemy in the war – but also for a humiliating defeat in the Cold War, the global conflict that typified the prestige and credibility of the modern Soviet Union. In addition, there was the humiliation of seeing a reunited Germany joining the Soviet Union’s greatest enemy, NATO. That would be a bitter pill to swallow even for ‘Gorby’, who had become a cult figure in the West. Furthermore, would the Western countries be able to close ranks and keep them closed? With the exception of Hannelore Kohl, the Ramstetter brothers, Professor Scholz, a select group of the chancellor’s staff and President Bush, everyone was completely taken by surprise when Kohl presented his ten-point plan on 28 November. How to respond to this sudden turn of events, which threatened to leave them hopelessly playing catch-up in the historic restructuring of post-war Europe was a painful question not only in Moscow and East Berlin but also in Western Europe, especially in London and Paris. If we are to believe Margaret Thatcher’s memoirs, the events that took place in the autumn of 1989 were ‘the most welcome political change’ of her lifetime. But in reality, the Iron Lady was above all concerned. She saw the threat of war. It was no coincidence that, at the same time, the German question was once more at the top of the international political agenda. After all, the two things – war and Germany – went hand in hand. Thatcher knew her history. During the first period of German unity, from 1870 to 1945, Germany had ‘veered unpredictably between aggression and self-doubt’. That was perhaps because a united Germany was simply too big to fit into a stable European order. In that respect, certainly, Germany’s neighbours were traumatised. But that applied even more to the Germans themselves. 9 DzDPDE, Kohl to Bush, 28 November 1989, pp. 567-73; Kohl, Erinnerungen, pp. 999-1000. 10 DzDPDE, Conversation between Kohl and Bush, Laeken, 3 December 1989, pp. 605-606.\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n21\n\n‘The true origin of German angst is the agony of self-knowledge,’ wrote Thatcher. In her eyes, this painful truth, as she described her own vision of the German soul, had convinced the Germans of a dangerous misconception. They themselves wanted to be ‘locked in to a federal Europe’. But precisely within that geographically limited European framework, they would have more rather than less opportunity to emerge again as the dominant power on the continent.11 In short, German unification in itself was certain to create the risk of destabilisation in Europe, but the inauspicious idea now being proposed – to temper the destabilising effects through a process of advanced European integration – was downright dangerous, a potentially fatal idea based on a misinterpretation of history. Kohl’s ten-point plan was therefore, for Thatcher too, a very unwelcome surprise. In her eyes, there was only one response possible: a full, frontal counterattack with the aim of delaying, containing and blocking the momentum towards unification unleashed by Kohl. When her closest advisers warned her some weeks later during consultations at Chequers, the prime minister’s country estate, that this was all getting to sound ‘a little like 1938’, the time of appeasement with Hitler’s Germany, she flashed her eyes back at them and answered ‘Yes, and I’m not an appeaser.’12 She would not back down. In any case, in the autumn of 1989, the chances of German unification being postponed and ultimately abandoned did not yet seem to be completely lost. Thatcher knew only too well that you don’t introduce a free market and democracy overnight, and certainly not in Germany. Concerned as she was about the increasing excitement in Germany, Thatcher had already contacted Bush before Kohl presented his ten-point plan. The American president had told her that he was looking forward to ‘a really good talk’ with her at Camp David on 24 November. But there was to be no meeting of minds there. Bush may not have disagreed with her openly but was ‘distracted and uneasy’ and had harped on about Thatcher’s relationship with Kohl. Wouldn’t her attitude give rise to difficulties in her relationship with the German chancellor? After her visit to Camp David, Thatcher was by no means confident that her American friends understood what was at stake. When Thatcher heard James Baker’s press conference a day after the presentation of the ten-point plan, she heaved a sigh of relief at most of what the Secretary of State was saying, except on one crucial point: that, in the future, Germany would have to be part of ‘an increasingly integrated 11 Thatcher, Downing Street, pp. 790-791. 12 Zelikow and Rice, Germany Unified, p. 207.\n\n22\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nEuropean Community’. At the NATO summit on 4 November – the day after the dinner in Laeken – she would hear Bush elaborate on this point in detail. Thatcher was shocked. Bush was turning out not only to be Kohl’s best friend, he ‘was aligning America with the federalists’! The situation was now painfully clear to Thatcher. She couldn’t rely on the Americans, either on the issue of German unification or on tempering European integration. The only card she had left to play was to work together with Paris, but that was by no means a trump card.13 And that was putting it mildly.\n\nThe surgeons of French realpolitik The way in which Paris responded to the vagaries of these circumstances was such that an entente with Thatcher’s United Kingdom was an illusion from the outset. The European realities that François Mitterrand and his advisers saw unfolding in front of their eyes may have been disconcerting, but they heralded the beginning of the unavoidable future that France had succeeded in postponing for so long. That future represented the decline of French power in the world. A central and painful aspect of that process was the relative loss of power in relation to the ‘German colossus’ that had arisen under Bismarck, the official foundation of which had been celebrated on 18 January 1871 in the Palace of Versailles after the Germans had crushed the French empire in the war of 1870-1871. Paris had long known that France ultimately lacked the brute force to compete with Germany. The only option left was to keep the ‘Teutons’ at arm’s length.14 This was a precarious strategy, but they had no choice. The colossus may have been reassuringly divided into two since the end of the Second World War, but in Paris, officials were constantly aware of the temporary nature of that arrangement. The hard reality was the prospect of their own decline, and they were confronted with that once again in 1989 when – as so often before – future power relations in Europe revealed their true face. In the 1950s, the French political elite had discovered European cooperation as the perfect instrument to keep in check the decay of their country’s power. But that had been a problematic undertaking. European integration after all also implied increasing rapprochement with Germany, France’s traditional rival on the continent. In 1989, after more than four decades of 13 Thatcher, Downing Street, pp. 793-796. 14 Lois Pattison de Ménil, Who Speaks for Europe? The Vision of Charles de Gaulle (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1977), p. 21.\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n23\n\ndivision in Germany and Europe, there was no avoiding the conclusion that this problematic aspect had ultimately not stopped France from pushing the process of integration ever forwards and ever deeper. Indeed, one could perhaps say that European integration – as it had taken shape since 1950 – was more the outcome of French realpolitik than anything else. That constant factor had primarily manifested itself in the uncompromising way in which countless leaders from the variegated French elite had proved, time and time again, willing to slice ruthlessly into the flesh of their own national sentiments and pride. If France’s position in the world was at stake, the surgeons of French realpolitik pulled very few punches. For France, Europe’s integration was dictated by that realism, and that meant slicing into its own flesh: France had to surrender power to Europe in order to retain power and influence in the global arena, and all sentiments were subordinate to that goal. In other words, they had to make a convincing show of loving the archenemy across the Rhine. There was no other choice. The deal had proved very lucrative, not least because the same applied to the newly born Federal Republic of Germany. Through its liaison dangereuse with France, the still insecure and provisionally constructed West German state was able to take giant steps towards international rehabilitation following the disaster of Nazism. This Gleichberechtigung, as the first West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer called the equal status between West Germany and its partners, was thus able to take shape credibly within the Western bloc and to be completed within less than ten years, when West Germany joined the Western European Union (WEU) and NATO in 1955. Hardly five years after the end of the Second World War, talks had already started with the French about the rearmament of West Germany within European institutional structures. Outside the political elite, however, this Franco-German reconciliation coming so soon after the war came across as downright bizarre. The stiff injections of ice-cold realpolitik administered by the surgeons of political realism ravaged the open nerves of French popular sentiment. FrancoGerman reconciliation proved difficult to sell to a chauvinistic population still traumatised by the war. So soon after the third humiliating war with the Germans in a century, reconciliation could easily be seen as a fatal Faustian pact. And this is exactly how it was seen by many Frenchmen, as became clear when the French plan for a European Defence Community (EDC) – after years of negotiations between 1950 and 1954 – was dramatically rejected by the French parliament in August 1954 (see chapter 3). Slashing one’s own political autonomy to retain power was one thing but, in the 1950s, the radical Europeanisation of the French soul that the EDC implied was,\n\n24\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nat that moment in history, going too far. The result was an existential crisis for the embryonic process of European integration.15 A common European foreign and defence policy was to remain both a dream and a nightmare in the decades that followed. Nevertheless, in the 1950s, the French policy of European integration achieved the desired effect. Cutting back on policy autonomy had made modern France leaner and meaner in European – and global – power politics. The lever of European integration worked perfectly. Slowly but surely, European integration based on Franco-German reconciliation became the backbone of French foreign policy, and with good reason. The disproportional benefits of this policy in terms of power politics steadily eroded the fears of the French people and tempered economic protectionism and other conservative reflexes. Moreover, time and growing prosperity in Western Europe had done their relentless work during Les Trente Glorieuses, the three decades following the end of the Second World War. This pre-history of European integration was an integral part of the dilemma facing Mitterrand and his advisers in the autumn of 1989. Exploiting Franco-German reconciliation to benefit France’s standing in Europe and the world had been a central mainstay of the country’s European and foreign policy for many decades. But would that course now have to be abandoned? Had this European leverage mechanism, which had proved its worth over and over again, finally had its time? The fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to catapult France and Europe into two directions at the same time: forwards into the future, into the post-Cold War era, but also back to 1945, when all capacity to think was frozen in fear of the shadow cast by the German colossus. What should France do now? What rationale should it adopt to protect its power position in this new situation? Answering these questions was no simple task. Was there actually any difference between the two opposing directions in which history now seemed to be moving? Or did it only appear that way? How much of a solid footing for the future did Franco-German reconciliation offer in an era without the Cold War? In the third volume of his war memoirs, published in the 1950s, Charles de Gaulle describes a message that he received in 1945 from Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS and the Gestapo. Himmler wrote the following: You have won, but what will you do now? Submit yourself to the AngloSaxons? They will treat you like a satellite and you will lose all honour. 15 Mathieu Segers, De Europese dagboeken van Max Kohnstamm: Augustus 1953-September 1957 (Amsterdam: Boom, 2008), pp. 37-41 and elsewhere.\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n25\n\nAssociate with the Soviets? They will force France to submit to their law and liquidate you personally… In reality, the only way to lead your people to greatness and independence is an entente with defeated Germany. Proclaim it immediately! Make contact without delay with those men in the Reich who still have de facto power and want to lead their country in a new direction… They are ready and waiting for your offer… If you can master the spirit of vengeance, if you seize this occasion that history offers you, you will be the greatest man of all time.\n\nDe Gaulle’s commentary on this incident is revealing: ‘Apart from the flattery that this missive from the edge of the grave directed toward me, there is undoubtedly some truth in the picture it paints.’16 After his return as head of the French government in 1958, when he was elected first president of the Fifth Republic, de Gaulle continued – and deepened – the policy of the Fourth Republic to exploit Franco-German reconciliation within the framework of the ‘Europe of the Six’ (France, West Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries). De Gaulle had frequently explained the rationale behind this, but rarely as clearly as he did on 22 August 1962 to his state secretary Alain Peyrefitte (who would be promoted some weeks later to the post of minister of information): What is the point of Europe? It should serve to prevent us from being dominated by America or Russia. The six of us together should be able to do as well as each of the two superpowers. France could be the strongest of the six members. We could control this lever of Archimedes. We could carry away the others. Europe represents the first opportunity France has to regain what she lost at Waterloo: world dominance.17\n\nDuring the Cold War, that French ‘instrumental Europe’ was identical to the Europe that rotated around the Franco-German axis. After all, West Germany was due to its war history, under the temporary provisions of international law, by definition the junior partner in the relationship. This paradoxical maxim of French grandeur via Franco-German reconciliation and European integration was the essence of France’s post-war European 16 Charles de Gaulle, Mémoires de guerre, 3 (Paris: Plon, 1959), pp. 175-79; Jeffrey Glenn Giauque, Grand Designs and Visions of Unity (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002), pp. 77-78. 17 Alain Peyrefitte, C’était de Gaulle, 1 (Paris: Fayard, 1994/95), pp. 158-59; Luuk van Middelaar, De passage naar Europa: Geschiedenis van een begin (Groningen: Historische Uitgeverij, 2009), p. 192.\n\n26\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\npolicy. That did not change under Mitterrand. It should therefore come as no surprise that, during the tumultuous developments in Europe in the final months of 1989, alongside the dominant German-American axis, a second smaller one was also turning, but now at full speed: the Franco-German axis within the framework of European integration. Bush got a few glimpses of it during the dinner in Laeken – and of the disturbed relations between Bonn and London. After discussing the revolutionary developments in the Eastern Bloc, their consequences for the Soviet Union and Gorbachev’s leadership and the impressions he had brought with him from Malta, Bush wanted to talk to Kohl about Western Europe. Bush:\n\nHow did your Western European partners respond to the ten-point plan?\n\nKohl explained that there were great differences. Belgium and Luxembourg had few problems with Germany’s wish for and moves towards self-determination. Felipe González’ Spain had even been enthusiastic, while Austria and Switzerland had also responded positively. As far as Mitterrand was concerned, Kohl was in no doubt at all that he was wise enough to realise that it was in no way in France’s interests to oppose German self-determination. According to Kohl, the French president’s main concern was that the developments did not lead to chaotic scenes. Kohl:\n\nMitterrand wants German unification to remain part of the process of European integration.18\n\nWith this explanation of France’s position, Kohl left it at that for the time being. He did not bring Bush up to date on the finer points of the intensive coordination between the Elysée and the Bundeskanzleramt. Later that same evening, this would prove to have been a good decision, as Thatcher’s visit to Camp David had made Bush suspicious of the European dimension of Kohl’s plans for German unification. By now, it was obvious to Kohl what the French had in mind. That had all become crystal clear at the extra European summit on 18 November in Paris. The talks may have focused on consolidating the historical importance of European integration and setting up comprehensive aid programmes for reform-minded Eastern Bloc countries, but it had not escaped Kohl’s notice that French priorities lay elsewhere. As president of the European 18 DzDPDE, Conversation between Kohl and Bush, Laeken, 3 December 1989, p. 606.\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n27\n\nCommunity, France was very concerned that developments in Eastern Europe and Germany would push the negotiations on the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) into the background at the forthcoming European summit in Strasbourg in mid-December.19 The Strasbourg Summit was to be the provisional climax of the momentum surrounding the EMU, carefully orchestrated by Paris, which had reached a high point earlier that year in April with the presentation of the unanimous Delors Report (see chapter 8). That high point had perhaps come as something of a surprise to many, but not to Mitterrand and his entourage. Jacques Delors, the French president of the European Commission, had performed the excellent work that the Elysée had demanded, and at an opportune time. The report, drawn up under Delors’ presidency, increased the pressure on the EMU dossier to the maximum at exactly the right moment, so that it was logical to take the first irreversible steps towards realisation of the EMU in the second half of the year, under the French presidency.\n\nExploiting Franco-German reconciliation The EMU had been a long-cherished wish of the surgeons of French realpolitik. France could only escape the ‘tyranny of the Deutschmark’ by sacrificing the franc. The French had learned by experience that fusing the sorrow of France (its declining power) with that of Germany (its war guilt) – through the mutual post-war reconciliation exercise under the cover of European integration – acquired an increasingly strong financial-economic dimension. And this was not necessarily to France’s benefit. In that respect, Paris was forced to learn a rather ironic European lesson, a lesson that found its best expression in monetary matters. It was saliently summed up by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve (Fed): ‘In order to stand up to the Germans, you had to be subservient to them – by following their lead in key questions of monetary affairs’. In other words, for France, the EMU was the best possible way to escape the yoke of the Bundesbank. Indeed, there was no other way, at least no longer. Or, as French president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing had put it as early as 1978, ‘we need an organised Europe to escape German domination’.20 France’s calculations after the fall of the Wall proved diametrically opposed to those of Margaret Thatcher: France 19 Kohl, Erinnerungen, p. 983. 20 David Marsh, The Euro: The Politics of the New Global Currency (New Haven, London: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 68-69.\n\n28\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nunderstood that European integration was necessary to break German domination. During the 1980s, after being forced to abandon his fanciful socialist experiments because of their dramatic consequences for the position of the franc within the European Monetary System (EMS), Mitterrand had come to the same conclusion as Giscard when it came to economic and monetary affairs (see chapter 8). The EMU had even become the alpha and the omega of his European policy. Mitterrand described it himself as follows: ‘The Germans are a great people deprived of certain attributes of sovereignty, with reduced diplomatic status. Germany compensates for this weakness with its economic power. The Deutschmark is to some extent its nuclear force’.21 This also made the challenge facing the French president immediately clear which was to dismantle Germany’s ‘nuclear force’. Mitterrand understood that this had to be achieved through Franco-German reconciliation and certainly not through Franco-German estrangement, as this would jeopardise France’s achievements in the process of European integration. Under the blankets of European integration, it had to stay warm and enticing. After the presentation of the Delors Report, Paris was closer to a historic step towards the EMU than ever. But then developments in Germany threatened to put a spoke in the wheel of the French strategy in sight of the finish line in Strasbourg. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mitterrand had to find a way to regain some degree of control over the process, so that he could use the completely new situation that had emerged to France’s benefit. That seemed a gargantuan task but soon proved easier than he had thought. The new state of affairs actually presented an opportunity for the EMU. To take advantage of it, Mitterrand had to take a leap forward for France, in the same way that Kohl had done to open the path to German unification and Bush had done to ensure American victory in the Cold War. Mitterrand did not tire of emphasising that the developments in Eastern Europe demanded not only continuation of the process of European integration. That in itself was not enough. He urged that Europe had to go further and had to strengthen and speed up the process. Mitterrand had repeated this mantra at the extra summit ‘to save the European Community’ on 18 November. He had received the unequivocal support of Helmut Kohl. Yet the French president had also sat by and allowed Thatcher to engage in her hysterics. He clearly shared her concerns: the historic developments 21 Jacques Attali, Verbatim III: Première partie 1988-1989 (Paris: Fayard, le livre de poche, 1995), p. 92.\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n29\n\nin Europe also deeply affected the sly fox of the Elysée. But Mitterrand was not ready to shoot himself in the foot at that time so as to ensure a glorious survival. The old fears flared up and prevented him from performing this brutal but necessary surgical intervention on himself. He let it go, for the moment. Only years later did his friend Helmut Kohl discover that, in those days, Mitterrand had not hidden his fears of war and violent conflict from those close to him. In contrast to his public statements, he found the Germans’ excitement over possible unification above all alarming, saying ‘these people are playing with a world war, without seeing it’.22 What Thatcher would never understand, however, was that Mitterrand chose to continue to suppress these ‘secret fears’ rather than sharing them with like-minded colleagues in Europe.23 How could he see the threat of war and yet close his eyes to it? And, even worse, how could he publicly support a development that he was terrified of?! Thatcher sought the explanation in the hesitant fatalism that Mitterrand displayed in his encounters with her. But she was wrong. The Iron Lady was being taken for a ride. In the autumn months of 1989, the French president was hastily working up to the tour de force of power politics that, at least according to the French interpretation, the situation now forced upon him. The acceleration of history that the whole world was now witnessing called for an equally revolutionary response in terms of Franco-German reconciliation (and thereby a slice into France’s own flesh). Mitterrand’s conclusion took concrete shape and the catapult of history launched France and Europe into a new future beyond the Cold War, just as a radically different future had dawned in 1945. Partly on the advice of his adviser Jacques Attali, Mitterrand had already made the necessary Franco-German preparations in the days leading up to the fall of the Berlin Wall.24 Initially, in light of the momentous changes in the air, he had done that purely to keep his options as open as possible. Kohl had, however, made the choice much easier. Well before taking his great leap forward on the matter of German unification, the chancellor had given the process of European integration new and unmistakable impulses. As early as the summer of 1989, the revolutionary developments in Eastern Europe had set Joachim Bitterlich, Kohl’s main adviser on European matters, thinking. Germany’s European policy faced the threat of being rather uninvitingly forced on the defensive: if developments in Eastern Europe 22 Kohl, Erinnerungen, p. 984. 23 Thatcher, Downing Street, p. 796. 24 Attali, Verbatim III, p. 403f.\n\n30\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nwere to suddenly make the issue of German unification urgent – and that was no longer as unlikely as it may have seemed – the chancellor would be forced to or would probably wish to provide evidence of German loyalty to Western Europe, to the West and to European integration. But if that call for new West-German commitment were to coincide with France’s presidency of the EU in the second half of the year, the Federal Republic could be placed under extra pressure regarding the EMU. To prevent Germany from finding itself in a tight corner in which it would be forced to make unacceptable concessions, it was imperative that Bonn took the initiative in developments in the EMU dossier. That was particularly important because the EMU was certainly not a popular issue in domestic politics. The Deutschmark was stable, it was free of political influence, and it was sacrosanct. All things considered, in the summer of 1989, this left Kohl with only one option open if he was to be well prepared for what was possibly going to happen. Bonn had to leapfrog the shadow of its own technical and financial-economic reservations about the EMU by seeking constructive rapprochement with the French presidency – and precisely on that EMU dossier. The French had to be convinced of the sincerity of Kohl’s intentions. One way of achieving that was to confirm unequivocally the continuity of the pro-European policy of a committed partnership with France, which was embodied in the crucial 1950s more than anyone by Konrad Adenauer, the most illustrious German friend of post-war France. As Adenauer was a fellow Rhinelander and Kohl’s godfather in the CDU, the current chancellor could make this point with pathos and conviction.25 Seeking greater rapprochement with France on the EMU dossier was, however, no easy task. First of all, it had to take place in secret, as it would not have survived in the full daylight of German public opinion. Secondly, it meant that Kohl would have to keep the two ministers with primary responsibility – Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Foreign Minister HansDietrich Genscher – as far as possible from the EMU dossier. That was not only necessary for the sake of secrecy; it was also crucial for the credibility of Kohl’s strategy of rapprochement. It was, after all, a public secret that, besides the majority of West-German citizens, the influential financial-economic elite were also extremely sceptical about the plans for the EMU (and the associated costs and disadvantages for the Federal Republic, not to mention the ultimate surrender of the Deutschmark). 25 Joachim Bitterlich, 1998, ‘In Memoriam Werner Rouget: Frankreichs (und Europas) Weg nach Maastricht im Jahr der Deutsche Einheit’, in Joachim Bitterlich and Ernst Weisenfeld (eds.), Schwierige Nachbarschaft am Rhein (Bonn: Bouvier), p. 113.\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n31\n\nPartly with an eye on these domestic feelings, Bitterlich had built a super-offensive element into his plan for stepped-up rapprochement to Paris. Bitterlich’s ‘surprise’ was the European Political Union: the EPU was a vision of the future that could count on broad and enthusiastic support in the Federal Republic, especially if it were linked to more rights and competences for the European Parliament – in other words, more European democracy. Not only could this be used in the future to influence German public opinion,26 it could also be deployed to exert pressure on the French in future EMU negotiations. For France, an EPU that gave the European Parliament more competences represented overly far-reaching interference in national sovereignty. That made the EPU a potentially powerful weapon in forcing concessions from France in the EMU talks. In short, Kohl’s European policy focused on the EMU to enhance FrancoGerman rapprochement – with a view to the impending discussion on German unification – and was rounded off by linking the EMU to the EPU. Furthermore, it gave en passant the position of the chancellor the gloss of European idealism, which could only benefit the credibility of German European policy. The strategy that Bitterlich had come up with was not at all badly formulated. It was Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, a fervent EMU supporter, who had the honour of unwrapping the Germans’ EPU surprise. During a meeting with his Italian counterpart on 18 October in Bonn, Kohl had explained that, in his opinion, European integration would by no means be finished with the completion of the internal market, planned for 1992. He added that, at the forthcoming European summit in Strasbourg – the finale of the French presidency of the Community – Europe’s leaders should discuss how the integration process should move forward after 1992. For the Federal Republic, this was the essential issue. Kohl emphasised that, in the future, European integration should go much further towards greater democracy – in other words, towards a political union. He assured Andreotti that he also wanted to see progress on the EMU but stressed that this was only possible if the ultimate aim was the EPU.27 During the regular talks within the framework of the Franco-German friendship treaty in Bonn on 2 November, Kohl had revealed his proactive European agenda in a conversation with Mitterrand. After they had established that European integration was of eminent importance for the future of Germany and Eastern Europe, Kohl said that it was his wish to work 26 Interview by the author with Bitterlich, Paris, 2003. 27 DzDPDE, Conversation between Kohl and Andreotti, Bonn, 18 October 1989, p. 453.\n\n32\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nas closely as possible with the Elysée to prepare the European Council in Strasbourg. The Elysée and the Bundeskanzleramt would discuss and solve any differences of opinion in advance and in confidence. The chancellor emphasised that he wanted Strasbourg to be a success and that was why he felt that it was important to avoid discussing the content of the EMU as much as possible. He had already instructed Genscher and Waigel to put the EMU dossier on hold and not discuss the details in the preparatory meetings of the Council of Ministers. Kohl had also made it clear to Mitterrand that he would support the EMU on one condition: that there be a debate on the ultimate political dimension of European integration. This issue therefore had to be on the agenda for Strasbourg too. In particular, the summit had to address expanding the competences of the European Parliament. Mitterrand responded to these demands in generalities.28 During the joint press conference after the meeting, Mitterrand had responded to a question about German unification by saying ‘I am not afraid of unification. I do not ask myself that kind of question. History is there. I take it as it is. I see the German desire for reunification as legitimate.’29 But at that moment, the Berlin Wall had not yet fallen. Nine days later – after the Wall had fallen – Kohl called Mitterrand and thanked him for his ‘sehr wichtiges Wort’ (very important words) of a few days previously. Before hanging up he also thanked him ‘für seine Freundschaft’, at which the president once again assured the chancellor of his friendship.30 When Bush and Kohl dined in Laeken, therefore, there was besides an American-German line of advance also a Franco-German one. Six days before the fall of the Berlin Wall, it had already become clear that the question of German unification would be tied to further European integration in the shape of the EMU and that the EMU, in turn, was linked to Germany’s ambitions for the EPU. The crux of this embryonic deal, however, was that discussing the details of the EMU – the core element that bound France and Germany together – had been declared taboo. The differences of opinion between the two countries were simply too fundamental. They took diametrically opposed positions on key questions like fiscal harmonisation and budget discipline, which the Germans insisted had to be necessary conditions for the EMU. That had become clear immediately after the conversation between Kohl and Mitterrand on 2 November, in follow-up 28 DzDPDE, Franco-German consultations, Bonn, 2 and 3 November 1989, pp. 471-473. 29 DzDPDE, Press conference, 3 November 1989, p. 472, note 8. 30 DzDPDE, Telephone conversation between Kohl and Mitterrand, 11 November 1989, p. 512\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n33\n\ndiscussions between the German chancellor and the French prime minister Michel Rocard. And then there was the EPU, such an unpleasant surprise for the French. Rocard had diplomatically manoeuvred his way around the issue to avoid broaching it head on.31 Yet, no matter how high the technical obstacles were, they proved completely subordinate in importance to the political objectives of Kohl and Mitterrand – German unification and the EMU – which came together so very opportunely due to the circumstances. On 27 November, one day before he presented his ten-point plan, Kohl had sent a letter to Mitterrand. It outlined a timetable for the EMU that could be set in motion immediately after the summit in Strasbourg and a proposal to submit a Franco-German plan for the EMU at the summit, coordinated and agreed by the two countries in advance. This was Kohl’s way of preparing his friend in the Elysée for the shock that was to come. It had been a complicated message. Kohl’s timetable seemed to propose substantial progress and irreversible steps towards the EMU, but there were three other noteworthy points. Firstly, Kohl wrote that he did not wish the intergovernmental negotiations on the EMU to start earlier than December 1990. He wanted to ensure that they did not begin until after the German elections, so that the EMU would not become an issue in the election campaign. Secondly, he did not want the negotiations to start until there had been sufficient progress on the more controversial points, notably fiscal and budgetary issues. Thirdly, he expressed in no uncertain terms his serious concerns about the problems surrounding fiscal harmonisation inherent to the EMU project and about the high budget deficits of some members of the Community. He also insisted again on expansion of the competences of the European Parliament, long a popular theme in West German politics.32 The letter reflected the difficult position in which Kohl found himself. The chancellor felt obliged to do something to temper the increasing concerns in his cabinet about the EMU. In the end, he had decided to make a virtue of necessity by writting down all the German demands and reservations clearly and concisely for his friend Mitterrand. Although this ended up being a source of irritation for the French president, the letter was a sign of far-reaching transparency on Kohl’s part. His intention was that the Elysée should study it carefully. 31 DzDPDE, Conversation between Kohl and Rocard, 2 November 1989, pp. 474-476. 32 DzDPDE, Kohl to Mitterrand, 27 November 1989 and conversation between Kohl and Rocard, 2 November 1989, pp. 565-567 and 475.\n\n34\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nKohl received a reply from Mitterrand just before his dinner with Bush. The French president now laid his wishes on the table. In Strasbourg, the ‘definitive’ decision had to be taken to start the intergovernmental negotiations on the EMU, by the end of 1990 at the latest. That was Mitterrand’s first – and only – concession to Kohl. He did not deign to devote a single word to the European Parliament. In his view, the EPU should not be discussed until the EMU had been established. Nor did he refer to Kohl’s detailed agenda. He dismissed the substantive problem areas identified by Kohl as truisms. Bitterlich, who added explanatory comments to Mitterrand’s reply for Kohl’s benefit, summarised it succinctly as follows: For M., the EMU has priority over everything else. It is the main objective for the coming period. All other issues relating to European integration are completely subordinate to it […]. M. sees your demands and conditions regarding the EMU as ‘diversionary measures’ […]. On more than one point, M. leads one to suspect that he is only concerned with achieving the EMU as quickly as possible; from his perspective, France has already more than contributed its share, by allowing liberalisation of the movement of capital and accepting the leading role of the Deutschmark and the German orientation in the design of the EMU [in the Delors Report].33\n\nBitterlich added that this reaction from Paris was to be expected and did not feel that this open exchange of views would put ‘Strasbourg’ in jeopardy. According to Bitterlich, Kohl had to understand now that, for Mitterrand, the EMU was the necessary counterweight to the neoliberal character that the common market had acquired in the preceding years – and which Paris had never supported. This new point from the French side made it considerably more difficult for Kohl to get something in return for a constructive German approach to the EMU dossier. Lastly, Bitterlich outlined just how limited support for France’s EMU plans was: only Italy and Greece supported them wholeheartedly. That meant that, in Strasbourg, Kohl would still have opportunities to get a number of Germany’s points – so superciliously ignored by Mitterrand at this stage – into the conclusions of the European Council. Those opportunities could be made even greater by coordinating with Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg in advance.34 Kohl knew what he had to do. He made sure that Waigel and Genscher were not informed of 33 DzDPDE, Memorandum from Bitterlich to Kohl, 2/3 December 1989, p. 597. 34 DzDPDE, Memorandum from Bitterlich to Kohl, 2/3 December 1989, p. 598.\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n35\n\nall this in detail. And they were not the only ones. With the exception of Bitterlich, almost no one knew of Kohl’s agenda.\n\nThe Netherlands between the Anglo-Saxons and the Teutons Kohl’s statement on French support for German unification, about which he informed Bush during their dinner in Laeken, was thus based on the truth. The same applied to his explanation about it being tied to European integration. But behind this lay an unruly world in which the French and the Germans wrestled over the EMU and EPU dossiers. Kohl did not tell Bush about these wranglings. Instead, he answered Bush’s question about how his Western European partners had responded to his ten-point plan. As mentioned above, the chancellor had already indicated that there were serious differences between the partners. And that included the Netherlands. Kohl: Bush: Kohl:\n\nBush:\n\nThe Netherlands has always been strongly focused on London. And London is very reticent regarding the ten-point plan. That is the understatement of the year! This abnormal Dutch response, has it anything to do with the Second World War? Yes. And I respect that. The Nazis treated the Dutch exceptionally badly. And that was an even harder blow for the Netherlands because, before 1933, they had always been very supportive of Germany; for example, offering asylum to Keizer Wilhelm II. The day before the German army invaded, Von Ribbentrop had assured the people of the Netherlands that Germany had no plans to invade their country. The Dutch have never forgotten that. On top of that, the Nazis established a civil government in the Netherlands, unlike Belgium, for example, where the country was governed by a military commander. That civil government was made up of Viennese Nazis of the worst kind. And then, of course, came the persecution of Dutch Jews. The Queen of the Netherlands told me that she has released a number of Nazis and that she was heavily criticised for that. But how does Mrs Thatcher stand on German unif ication?35\n\n35 DzDPDE, Conversation between Kohl and Bush, Laeken, 3 December 1989, p. 606.\n\n36\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nThis led Kohl to explain at length how Margaret Thatcher was stuck in the past and, above all, that she did not understand the historic significance of European integration. Kohl:\n\nBush: Kohl:\n\nIn her view, the European Parliament cannot have any rights, because Westminster is not able to surrender them. Only two weeks ago, she said ‘What kind of parliament is that European Parliament? It doesn’t even speak one language.’ Mrs Thatcher’s ideas simply no longer belong to these times. As for Germany, she believes that the post-war period has still not come to an end. Does she mistrust Germany? No. But she finds historic developments unjust. And, to be fair, that is also understandable. The United Kingdom put its own survival in danger in the Second World War and sacrificed its empire. It won the war, but lost a lot, too. That plays a large part in her response.\n\nKohl then explained to Bush that he could not understand why Thatcher chose the wrong strategy. In her place, he would take the lead in the European process to incorporate Germany even further into Western alliances. The conditions for achieving that were extremely favourable. After all, it was this chancellor who had made it clear over and over again that, for Germany, a future in peace and freedom was only possible under a common European roof. Kohl: Bush:\n\nKohl:\n\nMitterrand does understand this. I know you have excellent contact with Mitterrand. I was recently at Camp David with Margaret Thatcher. I am very concerned about the emergence of a fortress Europe and that ‘Brussels’ will take over sovereignty in Europe. As far as I’m concerned, there will be no fortress Europe. I support free global trade and absolutely oppose a central bureaucracy. And there is no majority in favour of that in Europe. Europe can only survive if it continues to have close ties with the United States. The truth is that Mrs Thatcher believes that London takes the lead in Europe. There is nothing I can do to change that, but she is well wide of the truth.36\n\n36 DzDPDE, Conversation between Kohl and Bush, Laeken, 3 December 1989, p. 607.\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n37\n\nOn 20 September 1988, Thatcher had explained her vision of the future of European integration in a speech at the College of Europe in Bruges, which caused quite a stir. After she had begun ‘by doing what the Foreign Office wished’, i.e. pointing out how much Britain had contributed to Europe over the centuries and how much it still contributed, the Iron Lady had broached a heftier topic: ‘What is Europe?’. She started to answer the question by comparing the Soviet Union and European integration. She concluded by saying ‘We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain only to see them re-imposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.’ Instead of this, she called for something completely different, a ‘Europe of enterprise’, part of the global free-trade project established in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). That Europe was not an inward-looking protectionist fortress but an open structure serving the ‘Atlantic Community – that Europe on both sides of the Atlantic – which is our noblest inheritance and our greatest strength’. She did not mince her words – and that is putting it mildly. Thatcher’s speech in Bruges boosted her popularity at home but, not completely to her surprise, she had to conclude that the response in ‘European circles’ was one of ‘stunned outrage’. ‘The federalists’ were seething with rage. Only Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers proved willing to support her position. But the isolation simply strengthened her conviction that, by following Delors’ plans for the EMU, Europe was on the wrong track. She did not doubt for a moment that ‘in the long term a proud, ancient nation like Spain would balk at continued loss of national self-determination in exchange for German-financed subsidies’.37 Kohl considered this a hopeless position. He was convinced that things were different to how Thatcher saw them. And he was the best of friends with Spanish leader Felipe González. Together with his Belgian counterpart Wilfried Martens, González was the only fellow European leader who could depend on receiving a regular invitation to the chancellor’s birthday parties. Lubbers and Thatcher would never be on that list.38 Not that Thatcher lost any sleep on that count. She had an ‘aversion’ to ‘all things German’ and to Kohl, ‘the wurst-eating, corpulent, plodding Teuton’, in particular.39 37 Bruges Speech, 20 September 1988, http://www.margaretthatcher.org; Thatcher, Downing Street, pp. 744-46 and 766. 38 Hans-Peter Schwarz, Helmut Kohl: Eine politische Biographie (Munich: DVA, 2012), p. 358f; interview with Hans-Gert Pöttering, KAS, Berlin, 2012. 39 George Urban, Diplomacy and Disillusion at the Court of Margaret Thatcher: An Insider’s View (London: I.B. Tauris, 1996), p. 131.\n\n38\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nJourney to the continent In the conversation between George Bush and Helmut Kohl in Laeken on 3 December 1989, the whole complex of problems and mechanisms that had driven the process of European integration forward in the past 39 years were put on the table, including the aversion to integration in London and the powerful encouragement from Washington. In the autumn of 1989, under the force of circumstances, it was time to take stock. Western European realities that could be covered up during the quarantine imposed by the Cold War now had to be confronted. And those realities determined the state of affairs. Their essence could be encapsulated in four general developments in post-war Western Europe and the integration process or, better yet, in four journeys that the Western European powers had undertaken, sometimes together, sometimes individually, sometimes intentionally, but often by coincidence or through circumstances, as they were forced to seek ways towards a shared future after 1945. In the first instance, there was the unprecedented journey that France and West Germany had undertaken jointly that had led them from being archenemies to reconciliation and eventually to a sustainable partnership, even friendship, embedded within the multilateral structures of European integration. Secondly, there was the decisive defeat of the British alternative to European integration that, despite Britain’s victory in the Second World War, had been the consequence of Franco-German rapprochement. The humiliating nature of that defeat became painfully and belatedly clear in 1973, when the British set off on their own journey to the continent – as inevitable as it was uncomfortable – by joining the EEC, with the Irish and the Danes in their wake. But that only came to pass after the UK had twice been refused membership. For more than ten years, France had used the leverage it had found and claimed in the process of European integration to keep the door to British entry closed. This had widened the gap between France and Britain within Europe. Thirdly, there was Western Europe’s withdrawal from the non-Western world. Post-war Western Europe was suffering from the loss of its colonies. After 1956, this withdrawal was symbolised by the French-British debacle in the Suez Crisis. Suez represented the fall of what had once been European empires. Lastly, there were the journeys that the people of Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg had undertaken on the road to greater European integration within the framework of their cultural affinities with the Franco-German tandem. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Spanish, Greeks and Portuguese had embarked on similar journeys. Like their predecessors, these medium-sized and smaller Western European\n\nPrologue: Dinner in L aeken (1989)\n\n39\n\npowers regularly acquired positions of trust in Bonn and/or Paris, often completely independent of the political colour of their governments. In the margins of the conversation between Bush and Kohl, something else also became clear. One of the founders of European integration had adopted an exceptional and mistrustful position: the Netherlands. How was that to be explained? Why did Kohl coordinate his position on the EMU with Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy (especially via Paris) and Spain and not with the Netherlands? How did the Netherlands end up so far out in the periphery of European developments? Why did the Netherlands actually embark in 1950 on its journey towards increasingly far-reaching European integration? Its cultural similarities with the other partners were not so self-evident. Was it purely a matter of calculation? Why had The Hague abandoned its British friends of free trade in the 1950s in favour of largely Catholic partners from Mediterranean and semi-Mediterranean Europe? How could this decision be explained? How was it taken and maintained? Was the Netherlands fully aware of what it was getting itself into in 1950? All things considered, the Scandinavian countries – with which in many respects the Netherlands had much more in common than with Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy – stayed outside Franco-German Europe and remained with both feet in the British camp, a pattern that was repeated in the EMU and the euro. Switzerland, the country of Calvin and haute finance, had also taken the well-considered decision to stay outside Europe. So why not the Netherlands? Why had the Dutch – with their much more Anglo-Saxon, Atlantic orientation – allowed themselves to be encapsulated in continental Europe? How disruptive or misleading had the Cold War been? Why did the Netherlands set off on its own journey to the continent in 1950? Before the Second World War, the famous Dutch historian Johan Huizinga described the Netherlands as having ‘its sights set on the sea, and even beyond the sea’ and as a nation in which ‘the centre of gravity of its national existence is hardly located in the country itself, but much more in a virtual point in the sea’. 40 What interest does such a country have in continental Europe? How does the Netherlands of the post-war period fit into the process of European integration? What were the Dutch looking for in Europe? Only export markets and free trade? Was that not too little? In May 1962, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maurice Couve de Murville, was asking himself the same questions. Shortly after the failure 40 Johan Huizinga, ‘Die Mittlerstellung der Niederlande zwischen West- und Mitteleuropa’, Grundfragen der Internationalen Politik, Heft 5 (Leipzig, Berlin: B.G. Teubner, 1933), p. 5.\n\n40\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nof France’s plans for more intensive political consultations between the six EEC member states – which the Netherlands fiercely opposed – Couve de Murville told George Ball, his American counterpart on European affairs: The Netherlands was an island, in the same sense that the United Kingdom was an island. The Dutch had never been really interested in Europe; they have always been looking out over the waters at other areas of the world. As a consequence they had resisted the development of Europe at almost every point. The Dutch were, of course, in many ways, the best of partners in the Community since they were the most honest and the most steady. But they were not Europeans – at least they were not continental Europeans – as were the French and the Germans. 41\n\nWhy the Netherlands made this journey to the continent is the subject of this book. The account of that journey forms the core of the book and is presented in chapters 2 to 8. The preceding chapter (chapter one) outlines the pre-history and the international context within which the first initiatives towards European integration were taken. Chapter 9 resumes where this prologue stops, focusing on Dutch European policy in response to the issues of German unity and the end of the Cold War. After the events of 1989, following several decades of status quo, these issues were abruptly pushed back up to the top of the agenda. They also proved to give the latest project of European integration, the EMU, a massive boost. In the years following that historic period of the fall of the Wall, the end of the Cold War and the establishment of the EMU, the Netherlands was slowly but surely forced to face up to European reality – a reality that did not stand outside of itself but of which it was itself an integral part. The epilogue offers a first step towards reconstructing the long and difficult process of navigation and re-orientation in which the country still finds itself.\n\n41 Couve de Murville quoted in Sebastian Reyn, Atlantis Lost: The American Experience with De Gaulle, 1958-1969 (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2009), p. 414.\n\n1\n\nAmerican concepts: Building Europe (1947-1949) Abstract Dutch ambitions for post-war Europe thrived within the wider goal of constructing a transatlantic free-trade zone in the wake of the establishment of the Bretton Woods system (1944). In the late 1940s, The Hague’s European and foreign policy focused on economic cooperation within the framework of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), the multilateral organisation linked to the Marshall Plan. This transatlantic arena had been created after the launch of the Plan in 1947 by energetic American diplomacy strongly promoting European integration to tackle the German question in light of the unfolding Cold War. Keywords: Bretton Woods, Marshall Plan, Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), European Payments Union, Cold War, American foreign policy\n\nHarvard, 5 June 1947: in a speech, US Secretary of State George Marshall announces an extensive American plan for reconstruction in Europe. The plan implied a radical revision of the mission of the World Bank, established at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, to support European reconstruction financially. The new American engagement with Europe propagated by Marshall made the World Bank loans meaningless. In 1947, the total sum of these loans to Europe was less than half a million dollars, while the Marshall Plan pumped around four billion dollars into European reconstruction. As a result, the World Bank switched to its second mission – promoting the development of backward member countries – much earlier than expected.1 1 Michele Alacevich, ‘The World Bank’s early reflections on development: A development institution or a bank’, Centro Studi Luca D’Agliano Development Studies Working Papers, 122 (2007), pp. 1-2.\n\nSegers, Mathieu, The Netherlands and European Integration, 1950 to Present.

Marshall’s message was clear: the United States was offering a massive aid programme but the Europeans had to take responsibility for implementing it. Reconstruction was ‘the business of the Europeans’. It soon became clear that the Soviet Union would reject Marshall Aid. Washington had anticipated this response; the aid programme was an American instrument in the rapidly escalating Cold War. What was disappointing, however, albeit not unexpected, was that all Central and Eastern European countries followed the Soviet example. From that moment on, ‘Europe’ for the Americans meant Western Europe. And what they asked for in return for Marshall Aid and the recovery programme was ‘European integration’.2 But why did they want Europe to be more integrated? And what did they believe that should entail? During the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945, it had become clear that a peace treaty with and regarding Germany could not be achieved for some time. The differences of opinion between the Western Allies on the one side and the Soviet Union on the other were too fundamental. As a result, the decision taken by the Allies at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 to divide Germany into four occupation zones remained in place. The same applied to the agreement that each occupying power represented the highest authority in its own zone, which boiled down to a right of veto in all matters of policy concerning the whole of Germany. That essentially prevented the development of a policy for Germany as a whole. Thus, the provisional ‘Yalta order’ continued, also after the unconditional capitulation of the German Reich on 8 May 1945. This divided Germany and Europe into two.3 On 1 January 1947, the American and the British occupation zones merged to form the Bizone, which the French zone would later also join. For the United States, this situation meant that cooperation with the Soviet Union, initially anticipated by Washington, rapidly became increasingly unlikely and impossible. The American position towards Europe needed to be reviewed, and thinking soon moved in a new direction. The prevailing view in Washington was that, in any case, a customs union needed to be created in Western Europe to promote free trade. This was the overriding objective that the 2 Geir Lundestad, ‘Empire’ by integration: The United States and European integration, 1945-1997 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 6. 3 Dokumente zur Deutschlandpolitik, II.

But it did not solve the most glaring problem in Europe: how to deal with the question of Germany and its provisional status in the Yalta agreement? At an interdepartmental meeting in August 1947, Charles ‘Chip’ Bohlen – one of Marshall’s chief advisors – formulated a new perspective that would become prominent in America’s European policy. He turned things around: the question of Germany was not an occupation issue but a European matter. In Bohlen’s words, ‘the three Western zones should be regarded not as part of Germany but as part of Western Europe’. This offered greater opportunities for America’s European policy for two reasons. First, the German threat could be neutralised by enclosing it in a larger, Western European context. Second, this would make it easier to drive the Western European economy forward. As ‘part of Western Europe’, the potential of the Western German economy could be better mobilised for reconstruction, which was of vital importance for Western Europe. The situation, it was claimed, should therefore not be viewed from the perspective of a divided Germany but from that of a unified Western Europe! It was now a priority to establish a West-German state to make that unity in Western Europe possible and to support it politically and, above all, economically. That meant a radical shift in America’s European policy. From the end of 1947, Washington embraced a new post-war mission: ‘building Europe’. 4 The original American idea was that European unity had to be enforced by free trade. To achieve this, the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established. Setting up the OEEC was the condition that the American Congress attached to Marshall Aid, and it opened its doors in the spring of 1948.5 It did not, however, function as had been intended. Rather than having an ‘integrating effect’, OEEC consultations increased economic tensions within the Western bloc, painfully emphasising national differences within Western Europe. The conflicting interests between Western Europe and the United States also became unmistakably clear, as did the divisive monetary forces at work between the dollar trading area, the sterling zone 4 Marc Trachtenberg, A Constructed Peace: The Making of the European Settlement 1945-1963 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999), pp. 63-65. 5 Robert Lieshout, De organisatie van de West-Europese samenwerking: Een voortdurende strijd om de macht (Bussum: Coutinho, 2004), p. 60.\n\n44\n\nThe Netherl ands and European Integr ation, 1950 to Present\n\nand continental Western Europe, where ideas for a customs union based on a ‘small’ continental Europe became increasingly concrete. In no time, all American intentions ran into a brick wall of resistance from Britain, because of its preference for more globally oriented arrangements, and from France, which wanted similar arrangements in continental Europe. In 1949, the OEEC was relieved of its formal responsibility to allocate funds for the recovery programme. This signified the de facto end of the organisation only a year after its establishment.6 In the years that followed, post-war history unfolded differently than the United States had anticipated. It was not the establishment of the OEEC but that of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG; West Germany) that would prove crucial for the institutionalisation of post-war Western European cooperation. As a result, Western European cooperation would take shape in different ways than had been expected. After the conference o"
