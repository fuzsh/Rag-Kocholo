        "text": "The role of traditional leaders in modern Africa is complex and has many aspects. It is discussed by advocates of “traditionalists” and of “modernists.” The traditionalists regard Africa’s traditional chiefs and elders as the true representatives of their people, accessible, respected, and legitimate, and therefore essential to politics on the continent. “Modernists,” by contrast, view traditional authority as a gerontocratic, chauvinistic, authoritarian and increasingly irrelevant form of rule that is antithetical to democracy (C. Logan, working paper 93, Afro Barometer).\n\nIn modern Africa the “traditionalists” represent the more popular view. An Afrobarometer survey of 36 African countries in 2014-15 found that 61% of people trusted local chiefs. Faith in ancient power structures has increased as people have grown more wary of modern and democratic institutions and politicians (The Economist, 19 December 2017); which is more or less the same as in West Europe. One reason is because the state in Africa is often absent. It is far more effective to ask a chief than a far-ocourt to rule in a case. Because the chief is local, his ruling may be better understood and accepted. Another reason may be that traditional leaders are seen as less corrupt, even though they tend to follow unwritten customs rather than written laws (The Economist, 19 December 2017).\n\nThese unwritten rules and customs, also called “customary law”, are defined as meaning the customs and practices traditionally observed among the indigenous African people of South Africa, which form part of the culture of those people (Bekker Seymour’s Customary Law in Southern Africa (1989) 11-13). Some African countries have definitions, whereas in other countries only descriptions can be applied and thus rules are more complex to derive. Allott says about the definitions: “Whether these definitions of customary law contribute anything by way of precision or facilitation of choice of laws is an open question.” (Allott New Essays in African Law 1970, 157).\n\nModern African Legal Systems\n\nMost African legal systems consist of a complex combination of customary law, religious laws, received law (such as common law or civil law) and state legislation. In particular customary law can be hard to define in a set of rules as we know in continental Europe. The complexity becomes apparent when the application of different sources of law leads to different outcomes in specific legal cases. In Bhe v The Magistrate, Khayelitsha; Shibi v Sithole; South African Human Rights Commission v President of the Republic of South Africa, for example, the Constitutional Court declared customary rule of male primogeniture, which allows only an oldest male descendant or relative to succeed to the estate of a Black person, unconstitutional and invalid. It also declared unconstitutional and invalid, section 23(7) of the Black Administration Act which unfairly discriminates against women and others with regard to the administration and distribution of black deceased estates. The court imposed, as an interim measure, the provisions of the Intestate Succession Act on estates previously dealt with under the Black Administration Act. It also made special provision for estates relating to polygynous marriages and that estates previously administered in terms of the Black Administration Act must be administered by the Master of the High Court in terms of the Administration of Estates Act.. (J.C. Bekker and D.S. Koyana, The judicial and legislative reform of the customary law of succession, De Jure, 45 Volume 3 2012 pp 568).\n\nIn this context some traditional African leaders have started to issue ancient European titles of nobility to westerners in order to help their people fund health care and education. The question arises to what extend such titles can be regarded as legitimate, both from a historic and legal perspective. I will discuss two cases in this respect.\n\nCase study: Ghana\n\nOn the internet, examples of European-style titles of nobility can be found that are issued by Togbe Osei III. of Godenu. For example: “The hereditary noble title of “Baron of Todome” has been conferred on November 13, 2016 by H.R.H. Togbe Osei III., by the Grace of God The Dufia of Gbi-Godenu in the Volta Region, Ghana, The Lion of Godenu, officially recognized, protected and guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana.“. The passage fees are used to contribute to important local social projects.\n\nGhana has a mixed system of English common law and customary law. Article 11(3) of the 1992 Constitution defines customary law as the rules of law which by custom are applicable to particular communities. Customary law is now a question of law to be determined by the courts. In Muslim communities, the reference to customary law is a reference to Islamic law or the Sharia. Customary law is not codified. Under Sections 42 and 43 of the Ghana Chieftaincy Act, 1971 (Act 370), as amended by Chieftaincy (Amendment) Decree, 1973(NRCD 166), Chieftaincy (Amendment) (No. 2) Decree, 1973 (NRCD 226), Chieftaincy (Amendment) Law, 1982 (PNDCL25) and Chieftaincy (Amendment) Law, 1993 (PNDCL 307), the National House of Chiefs and/or a Regional House of Chiefs, can draft their declaration of customary law for approval and publication as a legislative instrument by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice (V. Essien, Researching Ghanaian Law, Hauser Global Law School Program, New York University School of Law, 2005).\n\nI have not discovered in Ghana’s common law nor in Ghana’s customary law (as determined by the courts) a rule or basis that makes it possible to issue European-style titles of nobility. In particular, Ghana’s Constitution makes no mention of such a practice. Therefore, it seems to be the case that this practice has no legal basis. From a historical perspective, the mentioned practice has never occurred. Does this mean that such titles are not legitimate? More specifically, the question is: are there any objections regarding the issuance of western titles by Togbe Osei III and what is their value? I already addressed this question in my article about the former King Kigeli of Rwanda. That case involved a former head of state. In the Ghana-case it concernes a ruling traditional chief, as legally embedded in Ghana’s constitution.\n\nIt could be hard to embed a local nobility in Ghana’s regions, since there is no legal basis for it. Nobility can even be seen as unlawful. The President of the National House of Chiefs, the Agbogbomefia of the Ho Asogli State, Togbe Afede XIV, recently said one of the objectives of his administration would be to restore the nobility and reverence of the chieftaincy institution to enable it to effectively play its roles in society as expected (Ghanaweb, 2 February 2017, Do not meddle in politics. Togbe Afede tells chiefs). Issuing European-style titles may currently be the only safe way to bestow honours, since Ghana law is neutral about them in the same way as e.g. Italian law.\n\nLike other major Western noble titles, baron is sometimes used to render certain titles in non-Western languages with their own traditions (e.g. the Indian equivalent Rao and the Székely equivalent primor, historically used among a specific population of Hungarians in Transsylvania). From a historic perspective these titles are unrelated and thus hard to compare. They are considered comparable in relative rank. Even in Western Europe the term Baron can hardly be compared among the different European countries or even among different regions within a country. Therefore, when using the title in public, the source of the title should be mentioned; although the word is the same, internationally it has a different meaning.\n\nIn my opinion, European-style titles and honours might be unconventional, but can be accepted. There is no authority to forbid the Togbe (literally meaning “grandfather”, the Ewe (1) reference for a chief) to style Europeans and Americans in a European manner. I think the Togbe simply wants to make his titles more attractive to westerners, which is understandable. Issuing original Ghanese-style titles to westerners would be unconventional as well and could even be unlawful. On the other hand, at least one example exists that contradicts the latter suggestion. Therefore, it remains an open question to what extend it is legitimate to issue European titles. I tend to see them as legitimate, but only when used in proper circumstances as described below.\n\nAdvice\n\nAfrican leaders might not have enough insight regarding the intentions of westerners that want to be involved in charity in Africa in exchange a title of some kind. Frankly, these intentions are not important as long as the titles are bestowed upon worthy individuals and the passage fee is used for the good. However, not taking into account the character and behaviour of the recipients might lead to situations in which the issuer is disgraced. Low passage fees will contribute to attracting gold diggers. More importantly, it also designates low value.\n\nToday’s internet facilities attract numerous title hunters who make ridiculous appearances on the internet, thus jeopardising the reputation of the honour- or award-issuer. Such persons also decrease the value of the titles that are awarded. It is not easy to spot such title and medal hunters from an African perspective. Therefore, African leaders, that choose to issue titles to fund their regional charities are advised to carefully select a western intermediary of high reputation to represent them in such matters. Appointing the first person who comes knocking on the door is unwise.\n\nThe use of the title should not lead to confusion and irritation with European title holders. Therefore, on social media (e.g. the “Awards” section on LinkedIn) mentioning the title should e.g. read as: Baron of Todome (13 November 2016), title issued by the Togbe Osei III, 25th Togbe of Godenu. Extravagant use of the title should be avoided: less is more.\n\nI have a problem with use of the terms “King” and “Royal”, without any further explanation. In the context of antiquity and contemporary indigenous peoples, the title can refer to tribal kingship. Germanic kingship is cognate with Indo-European traditions of tribal rulership (c.f. Indic rājan, Gothic reiks, and Old Irish rí, etc.), but it differs from the modern use of the term “King” (head of a state). It needs to be explained that the terms “King” and “Royal” refer to tribal kingship. I suggest that this explanation is put on the website of the House of Godenu.\n\nI also have a problem with creating all kinds of “Royal” institutions, without any real substance. Some representatives of African Houses have e.g. created non-accredited Royal Universities, Honorary Guards, a Hall of Fame, a Royal Society, a Royal Warrant Holder Society, a Royal Commission of Nobility and Royalty, a Royal College of Technology Foundation, a Royal General Register of All Arms and Bearings and other institutions that try to mimic those of reigning European monarchs. All these institutions are presented in a manner that immediately shows a lack of good taste. In my opinion, these institutions are – to put it in a diplomatic manner – not appropriate and therefore should be avoided. African chiefs have their own identity and should not try to become European because of possible commercial gain. The result of these creations without any substance will be that ancient historic African families are again disgraced by westerners. They will be regarded as fake and ridiculous by the public. An example of a genuine and modest presentation, with a focus on history, research and good intentions, is the website of the House of Rwanda. I suggest this website is used as an example.\n\nComments and different points of view regarding this article are most welcome.\n\nReferences\n\n(1) Ewe (Èʋe or Èʋegbe [èβeɡ͡be]) is a Niger–Congo language spoken in southeastern Ghana by approximately 6–7 million people as either the first or second language.\n\nAppendix\n\nI have copied the opinion of Dr. W.H. Jones, because of his interesting views on the matters, discussed in my article. I was not able to trace the original anymore on the internet.\n\nGranting of Orders and Titles by H.M. King Kigeli V of Rwanda\n\n| 17.03.2007 | 18:40:33 | Views: 398\n\nPAPER PREPARED BY DR W. H. JONES, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA\n\nBSc (Econ) London, MA, PGCertTESOL, EdD Macquarie, JP NSW, 16 March 2007\n\nIs it possible for the present King of Rwanda, being King Kigeli V, to grant honours which are based on European nobiliary titles?\n\nIn February 2007, during a discussion between interested members on a public Internet discussion site devoted to heraldic matters, the question of titles being awarded by King Kigeli of Rwanda was raised.\n\nFollowing these discussions, which at times became quite heated, the current President of the International Commission for Orders of Chivalry (ICOC), (See Footnote 1) Dr Pier Felice degli Uberti, issued an invitation on 19 February 2007 as follows:\n\nFootnote 2. I offer this possibility to those who have something to say against the idea of the King Kigeli to grant “honours” using name of “European nobiliary titles” (but I repeat they are not nobiliary titles but only honours): prepare a true study supported by due documentation, historical precedents, footnotes which quote precedent studies on the matter to be published in one of my reviews or better to participate in the next III International Colloquium of Genealogy organized by Institut International d’Etudes Généalogiques et d’Histoire des Families in San Marino from 28 September to 1 October 2007.\n\nI accept the invitation to prepare a study. The study will not be published in one of Dr degli Uberti’s reviews as it is not presented in a way that meets the requirements for his reviews. In addition I am not able to participate in the International Colloquium of Genealogy organized by Institut International d’Etudes Généalogiques for September / October 2007.\n\nThe invitation was stated as being to those who have something to say against the idea of the King Kigeli to grant “honours” using name of “European nobiliary titles”. However I prefer in an academic treatise to pose a question in positive terms. That being so, the question could be posed quite succinctly as follows:\n\n“Is it possible for the present King of Rwanda, being King Kigeli, to grant honours which are based on European nobiliary titles?”\n\nThis whole matter arises because King Kigeli V of Rwanda is in fact not a reigning monarch, but a deposed monarch. He was appointed in 1959, deposed in 1961 and initially fled into exile to Tanzania. Since 1992 he has lived in exile in the USA.\n\nThe practice of referring to someone by a title and of a person using a title is one of social convention rather than a legal requirement. While a person might well be fully entitled (sic) to use a title or to be referred to as a holder of such a title, there are seldom any legal sanctions if this is not done. Within the military such disregard or disrespect might be a disciplinary offence but in the civilian world such non-use or non-recognition is normally just bad manners or ignorance. The sanction might be that one is not invited to official functions again, while for those who refuse to recognise or use titles for someone who has such an honour from a monarch in exile such as King Kigeli, then the sanction is not to be invited to future private functions.\n\nHowever, for the purposes of this study it might be useful to pose the problem in two parts.\n\nCan any modern-day monarch create honours or titles based on current or past titles which are conventionally used in European nobiliary traditions?\n\nFollowing from this, can a deposed modern-day monarch create titles based on current or past titles which are conventionally used in European nobiliary traditions?\n\nCan any modern-day monarch create honours or titles based on current or past titles which are conventionally used in European nobiliary traditions?\n\nThe term “Honours” has a wide meaning but for this question it probably means:\n\nTitles of honour in the European traditions, such as duke, marquess / marquis, earl, count, viscount, baron, lord, and baronet. There may be others of course, such as “grandee” in Spain and “noble” in some countries.\n\nDecorations, medals and orders, which can be created or issued for a very wide range of purposes, eg. Orders of chivalry with between one and any number of classes, orders of merit, also of between one and a number of classes, bravery awards, merit awards, commemoration awards and long service awards.\n\nThere are many other meanings for “honours” but these are the ones dealt with in this paper.\n\nAt Footnote 3 there is an opinion on what constitutes Orders of Knighthood. There are also comments on sources of legitimacy and legitimacy is a central element in recognition of “honours”.\n\n“Monarch”, while being a fairly specific word, really means the executive or ceremonial head of government of a country, and this could – of course – be a President. Therefore, while this paper does not look at the acts of “presidents”, it can be taken that modern-day presidents can do much the same as monarchs can do, again within the limits imposed by the type of constitution or government that any country is ruled under.\n\n“Titles” in the European context are a social construct and are not scientific phenomena. While the specific meaning of the various ranks within the nobiliary might well have had some specific meaning at some time in the past, changing over the centuries, nowadays such distinctions are mostly a matter of social recognition. One country where the nobiliary had real legal political power was the peerage in United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK), but recent reforms have reduced that power drastically. What is left in the way of “power” from the peerage in the UK is mostly persuasive and social.\n\nNote: After the British Labour Party came to power in 1997, it began the process of reforming the House of Lords. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, hereditary peerages do not entitle individuals to seats in the House of Lords. The Act did provide exemptions for the Earl Marshal, the Lord Great Chamberlain and ninety others elected by the peers. Further reform of the Lords is under consideration.\n\n“Nobles” is a more difficult concept to generalise on. Again it is a social construct, but it is nevertheless ingrained deep into the consciousness of many European traditions. Much like a grant of arms, “nobility” is seen by some as an incorporeal hereditment, perhaps inalienable in some conventions. In Britain, perhaps excepting Scotland which has some traditions of its own, there is not a “noble” class per se. Only peers are regarded as part of the peerage and their brothers and sisters normally only receive courtesy titles.\n\nGuy Stair Sainty is the author of a paper entitled, “A Summary of the Use of the Royal Prerogatives, its use by the Heirs to Former Thrones and by Republican or Revolutionary Regimes” Footnote 4. Therein he mentions that “certifications of nobility were issued by the Stuart claimants, despite being an alien practice for which there was no need in England (there being no privileged nobility other than the Peerage)” … and these were routinely accepted by nobiliary authorities in France, Spain, Italy and the Empire.) However “nobility” as a discrete element is not dealt with in this paper, as whole books can be written on the subject\n\nHonours and awards are created by convention, normally part of the executive prerogative within a state. Invariably, such honours and awards do not have extra-territorial effect but normal politeness will normally provide at least social acceptance extra-territorially.\n\nAt official or diplomatic level, one country will normally accept whatever descriptions are given by sending countries. A somewhat idiosyncratic position was taken by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam of Australia for a while during his tenure of office from 1972 to 1975. He is said to have disputed titles such as “Duke of Gloucester” and referred to the then incumbent as “Prince Henry” Prime Ministers can do much as they like but that ponderous interpretation did not last very long. (See in, Whitlam, E. G. “The Truth of the Matter”. Melbourne: Penguin Books, 1979; W H Jones, “Development of the System of Honours and Awards in Australia”, 1986, Macquarie University).\n\nThere are many good sources to find details of the honours and awards issued by the countries of the world. The Internet will provide good references. The Orders and Medals Research Society is a good source for worldwide information (http://www.omrs.org.uk/,) and has the added attraction of having HRH the Prince of Wales as its Patron. On a more esoteric and limited scale there is the private organization known as the International Commission for Orders of Chivalry (ICOC) (http://www.icocregister.org ). Both of these sites can give a guide to past and present honours.\n\nIt is a matter of international practice that governments of different countries generally recognize the acts of other countries, unless they are at war or unless there are some other reasons for not recognizing particular acts, laws or conventions. Honours and awards are no exception and countries will normally recognize the awards of other countries. This does not mean that they will give permission to use, accept or wear such honours, except under specific circumstances. Recognition does not imply “permission to wear”.\n\nSwitzerland is the only country that I am aware of that specifically does not allow its citizens to have medals and honours in the sense used in this study. This is not a prohibition on non-Swiss from having, using or accepting honours. By exception, Swiss are permitted to serve in the Pontifical Lifeguard (Swiss Guard) and to accept decorations from the Holy See.\n\nKeeping to the subject of honours, almost all countries nowadays create, amend, vary or even disestablish honours. Again a good source on new and defunct honours is the OMRS. A good example of a recent change to a Royal Order is in Britain where the Royal Victorian Order renamed the grade of MVO 4th Class to LVO (Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order). There have also been changes to the Order of the Bath within the last hundred years and of course the Order of the British Empire is less than one hundred years old. The most recent change in the Order of the British Empire is to introduce a lapel badge (2007). While not strictly relevant to the topic of this paper, a point to bear in mind is that some British honours are “dynastic” to the extent that they remain within the control of the monarch – The Garter, Thistle, Royal Victorian Order and the Order of Merit. Most UK gallantry and long service awards have undergone recent changes, particularly by the removal of distinctions between which ranks can receive which awards.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe answer to the first question – “Can any modern-day monarch create titles based on current or past titles which are conventionally used in European nobiliary traditions?” must be yes. The only way in which the executive authority of the monarch (or head of state) in power can be curtailed is by the laws and conventions of the country concerned.\n\n“How” such honours are created can differ. It may be through Orders in Council during the exercise of executive prerogative or it may be by legislation.\n\nTo look at King Kigeli of Rwanda in this context, if he had created honours and awards during his very brief period as monarch (1959 to 1961), I doubt very much if such creations would be an issue. They might have been unwise, unconventional or even bizarre, but, in my opinion, they would have been properly established. There are no governing principles or international law or custom that he must follow. The King, if he chose to do so, could create an entirely new system of aristocracy, honours, titles or anything else that followed neither European nor African precedents.\n\nMr Richard Lichten has referred me to an article on creations within the Japanese peerage. In 1869 under the new Meiji government, a Japanese peerage was created by an Imperial decree merging the former Court nobility (kuge) and former feudal lords (daimyo) into a single new aristocratic class called the kazoku. The House of Peers consisted of princes, marquises, counts, viscounts and barons. The Korean empire also had a system of aristocratic rank that equated to that of Europe, with titles similar to those of Japan. Although these titles may have seemed strange at the time, they created a hierarchy that was comprehensible to both the Japanese and Koreans, and also to outsiders. Nobody would deny the rulers of Japan and Korea the right to create European-style titles, but the main point made by Mr Lichten, is that these rulers had the right of fons honorum. King Kigeli does not.\n\nThe Emperor Napoleon 1 of France created a whole range of titles, with rules quite distinct from previous traditions. Nevertheless these were perfectly valid, because they were created by a ruling monarch – despite the interesting fact that he was the “Emperor of the Republic of France”. Footnote 5. Napoleonic Titles and Heraldry Napoléon’s official style, “Napoléon, par la grâce de Dieu et les Constitutions de la République, Empereur des Français”\n\nSource : Brigadier General D Fourie, member of the South African Defence Force Honours Advisory Committee and of the South African Heraldry Council, March 2007.\n\nCan a deposed monarch create honours or titles based on current or past titles which are conventionally used in European nobiliary traditions?\n\nWhile this question is looked at from the perspective of King Kigeli of Rwanda as a deposed monarch, the answer is likely to be the same for any ex-monarch and for their heirs who might be described as “pretenders”.\n\nThere have been many instances of deposed monarchs or governments purporting to establish governments-in-exile. These have had varying levels of support, at least for some years. There was a Polish government in exile between 1939 and 1990 and this claimed to be the de jure government of Poland according to the 1935 constitution until 1990 when communism fell and free elections were held. During this time the PGinE continued to make what might be considered by some as lawful awards of Polish orders. By the 1970s no state recognized the PGinE but such diplomatic recognition was regarded by some as irrelevant to its legality, in much the same way as an interregnum had continued in Poland between 1795 and 1919. It might well be the case that King Kigeli or any other deposed dynasties could raise similar arguments, but it is usually the de facto position that holds the most sway.\n\nIn the first place – and quite probably the most important issue – there is the lack of a system within which to establish honours, however described. A monarch in exile does not control the apparatus of the state from which he (or she) is exiled, so it is most unlikely that that state would formally recognize any acts of the former head of state. I know of no state that affords such internal recognition. Portugal is one country that treats the pretender to the throne of Portugal very well, but this does not imply any recognition of acts exercised by the pretender or any of his descendants.\n\nLooking outside Rwanda, one could look to see if honours created by a monarch in exile or a pretender to a throne are recognized, regardless of non-recognition in Rwanda. . I know of not one country that recognizes any actions of any kind by King Kigeli as being effective in Rwanda. There are no known instances in modern times of honours created by monarchs in exile being recognized extra-territorially, although for a while the honours created by the Stuart monarchs in exile received some form of acceptance in some Continental countries. There is no international system in place within which King Kigeli can create honours which have any international meaning or which any international body will acknowledge as having any meaning in Rwanda.\n\nIn general I would rely on a statement from a distinguished source:\n\nFootnote 6 Dr Pier Felice degli Uberti, 2007 President of the International Commission for Orders of Chivalry (ICOC).19 February 2007 ” … (I) consider valid and undisputable from a legal point of view only a grant of honours or nobiliary titles coming from a Sovereign on the throne or a State sovereign.\n\nAlso relevant are the following:\n\nFootnote 7. I want to precise that although I disagree from a legal point of view with the grants of nobiliary titles made from exile or by descendants, that effectively do not have any value, I consider them a good idea … PFdU\n\nFootnote 8. As you know I disagree with the grants of nobiliary titles given from exile in every case, less and less if the grants come from descendants.\n\nOf course King Kigeli could consider himself to be the Rwandan government in exile and act as a de jure monarch even though de facto deposed. If he is acting as lawful king (but lawful in whose opinion?) though in exile, the question then arises of whether he should consider himself to be guided exclusively by the laws of (Belgian) Rwanda as they existed at the time of his de facto position as monarch, or if he is free to go beyond the restricted royal role of the colonial period. This is hardly a serious question, as it would be specious to argue on the one hand that he should not have been deposed and on the other that because he is now a free agent, although in exile, he can now go beyond powers he had when de facto in power.\n\nWhat then can King Kigeli do?\n\nAs a free man King Kigeli can do virtually anything that is not illegal. It is not illegal to create titles or to purport to do so. The Stuarts in exile did so. The Hutt River Principality in Australia is a good example of self-created titles. There are hundreds if not thousands of societies that grant titles and give awards.\n\nThe only real question is what the value is of such titles.\n\nCreation of titles by King Kigeli\n\nKing Kigeli has purported to create titles-in-waiting, if I might use that expression, by the issue of Letters Patent that have no legal authority (meaning enforceable authority) but that are not in themselves illegal.They are in effect a form of promissory note without any real intention, possibility or capability of being honoured. But see Footnote 11.\n\nHere is an example of the King’s own words: (See Footnote 10)\n\nBy the Grace of God King of Rwanda etc\n\n… We do grant a title of honour, correspondent to the hereditary nobiliary title of (eg Marquis / Count / Baron etc) in the European tradition. This hereditary nobiliary title of (Marquis / Count / etc) shall descend by way of male primogeniture, We engage ourselves to make lawful, valid and executive the nobiliary title of …\n\nThese Letters Patent have as much meaning as a similar document issued by any person, but have the added cachet of being issued by a former head of state, who may – just may – become head of state again. Because King Kigeli was born in 1935 and has no known descendants the Letters Patent have doubtful value. In addition there is no indication in the Letters Patent that there is any provision or promise to bind or “engage” any person or body other than the King to make the title “lawful, valid and executive”.\n\nThe question then arises about the purpose of the Letters Patent. From Footnote 12 it is clear that the current format of the Letters Patent came after there was some concern about titles being created and granted by King Kigeli. Dr degli Uberti, because of his expertise and background in matters of honours undertook to assist in trying to put in place a system to regularize the granting of titles of honour, while making it clear that the titles had no immediate effect.\n\nFootnote 12. I … am pragmatic and for me every title coming from a former Sovereign (or his descendants) has no legal public official value … not only Africa, but particularly old Europe.\n\nOne of King Kigeli’s former close advisers sees the matter in a practical light. With regard to intention, he remarks (see Footnote 9),\n\n” … Anyone may have a political agenda in order to resume the power in his Country and has the right to invent any strategy that can bring about the realization of that plan.\n\nIn other words, it is a strategy to regain power in some way, presumably by raising money and gathering adherents for some future endeavour.\n\nA more argumentative interpretation is posed by some of the opponents of such titles, at worst, without saying that creating titles could have every indication of being a form of confidence trick, which attracts funds but offers only a chimera (vain or idle fantasy) in return, playing on individual gullibility or vanity.\n\nIssues about the validity of titles are real, as can be seen in the current controversy (2007) in the UK, on the supposed misuse of the honours system there,\n\nThe real question ten remains as to why King Kigeli felt the need to create such nobiliary titles. He had already created a number of “Orders” and other decorations and medals (See following paragraphs – Creation of other honours by King Kigeli V)\n\nThe orders and decorations created under the imprimatur of King Kigeli V seemed to find a ready supply of recipients, who, presumably, paid for such honours, either by way of contributions to the causes favoured by King Kigeli or by way of “passage” fees for admittance to the various Orders.\n\nWhy then the urge to create further honours in the form of nobiliary titles? Lacking any other plausible explanation, the indications are that it was based on advice from outside King Kigeli’s knowledge, and perhaps as an additional means of raising funds.\n\nThe possibilities are legion, but the conclusion one must come to is that King Kigeli was poorly advised in agreeing to establish a system of titles based on European traditions. They have nothing to do with Rwanda or indeed with anything in Africa and, more importantly, did not exist whill he was in power.\n\nThere have been some suggestions by his advisers, former advisers and others that there is a distinction between “honours” and “titles”. Such advice may well have been given in good faith, but it is doubtful if such a distinction is really valid.\n\nFootnote 2 (but I repeat they are not nobiliary titles but only honours)\n\nFootnote 9. These people believe incorrectly that the King has placed himself into a position whereby he grants titles of nobility. This belief is incorrect and absolutely false. This can be understood by reading and understanding the … documents signed by the King. The King of Rwanda … does not desire to, nor does He grant to individuals any European noble title (baron, count or marquis). …\n\nI repeat – King Kigeli grants ONLY honors and not titles.\n\nThese statements are contradictory within themselves and are also contradicted by the specific words of the King in the example Letters Patent mentioned above, viz;\n\nFootnote 10. We do grant a title of honour, correspondent to the hereditary nobiliary title of (eg Marquis / Count / Baron etc) in the European tradition.\n\nThis hereditary nobiliary title of (Marquis / Count / etc)\n\nWe engage ourselves to make lawful, valid and executive the nobiliary title of (etc)\n\nThe plain fact is that dukedoms, marquisates, earldoms, viscountcies, baronies lordships and baronetcies are all quite clearly titles, within the ordinary meaning of the word. One can quibble about the difference between “title of honour” and “title” but in reality it makes little difference. The grants, titles or honours are unmistakably, from the words of the Letters Patent, intended to be legitimized on the accession of King Kigeli to the throne of Rwanda, as hereditary titles with descent by primogeniture. The King’s ability to effect such legitimization must be in doubt, but this is always a possibility, however remote.\n\nCreation of honours other than titles by King Kigeli\n\nMuch the same remarks as have been made about the creation of titles apply to the creation of Orders and decorations. At country or state level, such creations are routine.At a private level, including pretenders to thrones, it is not illegal to do so, is harmless, and if anyone wishes to recognize such orders and decorations then they can do so. Governments invariably will not do so. The following words, already quoted, are apt in this context:\n\nFootnote 6. Dr Pier Felice degli Uberti, 2007 President of the International Commission for Orders of Chivalry (ICOC). 19 February 2007 ” … (I) consider valid and undisputable from a legal point of view only a grant of honours or nobiliary titles coming from a Sovereign on the throne or a State sovereign.\n\nCreation of orders and decorations, in a way, is a much less objectionable way of rewarding services and of fund-raising. Those awarded such orders and decorations can wear them privately or on any occasion where they would be socially acceptable.\n\nThe Order of the Lion of Rwanda is one Order created by King Kigeli. There are no records of the existence of such order before King Kigeli was deposed, so it must have the status of a newly-created Order in exile. There is no conflict with an existing Order in Rwanda under the control of the present government. Therefore, there is no situation comparable to the Stuarts (James II) in exile purporting to create Knights of the Garter. On the other hand, if evidence were to be provided that the Rwandan Order of the Lion did exist before King Kigeli was deposed, then the situation would be much the same as pertained during the time of ex-king James II of Britain and King William III of Britain – one set of awards would have recognition from a de facto ruler and one from a self-styled de jure ruler.\n\nUse of titles and honours from King Kigeli V\n\nOne of my functions as Chief of Protocol in Rhodesia and Zimbabwe was to deal with issues of precedence and appropriate ways of recognizing titles, honours and awards. In this regard I came in contact with current heads of government, and ministers existing royalty and former royalty.\n\nDuring the Independence celebrations for Zimbabwe (leading up to 18 April 1980, I dealt with the then Governor, Lord Soames and also had some time with HRH Prince Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles as she was then and Lt Col Andrew Parker Bowles.\n\nAt the Independence Dinner itself on 17 April 1980, I had to advise Prime Minister Mugabe on how to resolve the problem of an uninvited guest, Daniel Ortega, who announced himself as the head of the new five man ruling junta in Nicaragua. Living in Rhodesia at the time was King Leka of Albania and his wife, Queen Susan (an Australian). There were issues on how to deal with them and I had a number of problems in this regard.\n\nI looked after HRH the Duke of Kent during a brief stopover in Zimbabwe, and also various Presidents, Prime Ministers, the UN Secretary General, ambassadors, Cardinals and other prominent people in the world of politics.How then might I have advised persons honoured by King Kigeli V?\n\nI might well have given the following advice privately to those who had received decorations such as “knighthood” equivalents, and recipients of “titles” such as marquis from monarchs or pretenders in exile. I would have suggested that they treasure such honours and use them quite openly in appropriate circumstances. By all means use such titles as “Chevalier” in appropriate circumstances and even in correspondence with people who afford such recognition. I might well have suggested that it was no business of anyone else’s what was done in this regard. The appropriate circumstances, however, were unlikely to be official events. “Titles” such as marquis are always a more difficult issue, because they make a statement about social standing, not just for oneself but also for one’s family. They also place a person in a social position in relation to those who might claim “legitimate” titles, if I might use that expression.\n\nHowever, I would have advised such title-holders in much the same way as those who held positions in Orders – use the title with discretion, within the appropriate milieu. In both instances, my opinion is that recipients of such honours should not be afraid to admit belonging to an order or having a title. If a monarch in exile or a pretender saw fit to honour someone in this fashion then it would be quite proper to admit it. Not to do so would mean denying the donor. The significant issue is to use or display such titles and awards with discretion.\n\nIn general, I believe this advice is consistent with that provided by Dr degli Uberti (See Internet site rec.heraldry 18 February 2007). See Footnote 12. Edited from rec.heraldry of 18 Feb 2007. Dr degli Uberti does seem to feel the need to make a case for a distinction between “titles as honours but not titles as such” on the one hand and other forms of titles on the other. I would not agree with this interpretation but it really is not that significant. I see no problem with creating what purport to be titles and calling them titles, as long as the recipients are aware of the uncertain status of such titles within the international community and – more importantly – as long as such tiles are used with circumspection. The Letters Patent from King Kigeli make it clear that the titles are subject to being made valid if the king ever returns to his throne.\n\nConclusion and Summary\n\nThe question that was posed is “What is the position on the idea of the King Kigeli of Rwanda to grant honours using names of European nobiliary titles”\n\nAnswer\n\nIn a very few words, it is not illegal or even improper for King Kigeli to purport to grant honours using names of European nobiliary titles, but this amounts in present circumstances to a private act or acts, backed only by the cachet of being an ex-king, with a remote chance of ever becoming king again. I believe Dr degli Uberti and I are in agreement on many points, and I quote : “King Kigeli – as other former Sovereigns or Chiefs of House – is right in creating new awards (orders), that have value (private) only among his supporters and among those who want to give them value, and are different from those created in Europe” From Footnote 12.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\nFootnote 1\n\nIOCC Website.\n\nThe Commission is a private body, the worth and seriousness of which wholly depends upon the worth and seriousness of its component Members. In the past, there have been errors in scientific evaluation and interpretation, or times when the Commission exceeded its institutional role. Therefore, the new Statutes require a specific academic grounding of those who seek to become Members and these persons must demonstrate their experience in the field of the study of chivalric orders, decorations and awards systems through publications and other specific work.\n\nFootnote 2\n\nI wish only make an invitation. I offer this possibility to those who have something to say against the idea of the King Kigeli to grant “honours” using name of “European nobiliary titles”\n\nFootnote 2\n\n(but I repeat they are not nobiliary titles but only honours):\n\nContinuation of Footnote 2\n\nprepare a true study supported by due documentation, historical precedents, footnotes which quote precedent studies on the matter to be published in one of my reviews (Nobiltà http://www.iagi.info/rivistaNobilta/ or Il Mondo del Cavaliere http://www.icocregister.org/aioc/programma.htm ), or better to participate in the next III International Colloquium of Genealogy organized by Institut International d’Etudes Généalogiques et d’Histoire des Families in San Marino from 28 September to 1° October 2007.\n\nIf the person cannot participate for the distance I will publish the intervention among the proceedings of the Colloquium, so it will be conserved in many of the Libraries and Archives in the world which receive also my reviews.It must be a true study not only personal opinions without scientific support.By my side I will prepare a study on the argument supported by historical precedents of dynasties who granted nobiliary tiles from the exile in Countries where the concept of nobility (as we mean in Europe) did not exist, that should be an ahistorical precedent of common usage between historical dynasties.I will begin from the Oriental Empire, so I will utilize this study also for the next International Colloquium of Genealogy in Romania on May 2007.\n\nFootnote 3\n\nLegitimacy and [of] Orders of Knighthood\n\nThis essay was first published in December 1996. – François Velde.\n\nFootnote 4\n\nA SUMMARY OF THE USE OF THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE, ITS USE BY THE HEIRS TO FORMER THRONES, AND BY REPUBLICAN OR REVOLUTIONARY REGIMES (c) Guy Stair Sainty (Edited 3 March 2007 by W H Jones – only some elements quoted here)\n\nPORTUGAL\n\nIn Portugal, both the deposed Monarch, Miguel I, and the last King of the “liberal” Monarchy (deposed in 1910), bestowed titles of nobility while in exile. H.R.H. Dom Duarte, Duke of Braganza, the claimant to the Portuguese Throne, has not only awarded the Royal Order of the Immaculate Conception of Villa Viçosa, the only Order of the former Kingdom not taken over by the Republic, but has also re-established a long dormant Order, that of Saint Michael of the Wing, with members across Europe and a handful in the United States (now reformed as an Association rather than an Order) The Republican authorities have looked with a benevolent eye on the activities of Dom Duarte, who has a substantial following within the country and has always conducted himself with considerable dignity. His late father created a Council of Nobility, now under the Presidency of the Marques de Pombal, which he has invested with delegated powers to confirm in his name titles created during the Monarchy but now extinct or dormant. A feature of the titles created under the “liberal” monarchy was that a substantial number were created for the life of the grantee, or for one or two lives thereafter. The Council has also been given the power to revive or extend the life of such titles, generally, although not necessarily, for the representative of the original grantee. Thus, by such “revivals” the Council may sometimes be creating new titles.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIt may be safely stated that the legitimate claimants to the Headship of formerly reigning families can assume the prerogative to award their Royal or Dynastic Orders and, to the extent that the last Constitutions of those particular Monarchies so permitted, enjoy such other prerogatives as can be exercised in actuality. These may, for example, include the right to create or confirm titles of nobility, provided such creations conform with the legal requirements established before the fall of the Monarchy. They would not include, on the other hand, such provisions as being Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of that country, as that responsibility is likely to have been assumed by another under the Constitution of the successor state. It may not always be possible for a Head of a Dynasty to comply with the precise requirements of the Monarchical law because of the disappearance of an historic office or position. To the extent that it is possible and practical, such requirements should be met and the various acts properly recorded.\n\nWhether these awards have any validity outside the realm of private law would depend on the attitude of other Sovereign states. As several reigning Heads of State having accepted the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece, itself recognized by the Austrian Republic, the exercise of that particular prerogative can be considered as having been recognized in public law (precisely because it is held not to derive from the claim to the throne). The same applies to the Grand Magistery of the Constantinian Order which, although divided, is recognized as a non-national Order by the Government of Italy and, in Spain, is recognized as an award and is invited to participate in ceremonies along with the Orders of Malta and the Holy Sepulcher. German Law seems to acknowledge the right of the heads of formerly reigning families to award their Orders and several states have recognized, in the past, titles created by exiled Sovereigns whom they accorded some form of recognition (such as those by the exiled Stuarts). Whether or not a claimant chooses to exercise these prerogatives, he or she would be well advised to do so with caution and discretion; one day the Dynasty might be restored and a future Sovereign would not wish to be embarrassed by having to acknowledge as legitimate those actions of his immediate antecedents which would be better forgotten.\n\nFootnote 5\n\nSee Napoleonic Titles and Heraldry Napoléon’s official style,paper provided to me by Brigadier General D Fourie, member of the South African Defence Force Honours Advisory and of the South African Heraldry Council. “Napoléon, par la grâce de Dieu et les Constitutions de la République, Empereur des Français”\n\nFootnote 6\n\nWhat a strange thing for me (who consider valid and undisputable from a legal point of view only a grant of honours or nobiliary titles coming from a Sovereign on the throne or a State sovereign) to take on the justification of a former King who used for his honours also the name of European nobiliary titles. Dr. Pier Felice degli Uberti\n\nFootnote 7\n\nI want to precise that although I disagree from a legal point of view with the grants of nobiliary titles made from exile or by descendants, that effectively do not have any value, I consider them a good idea particularly valid as moral value which in some manner in private ambient maintain a tradition of our culture which deserves not to die. Dr. Pier Felice degli Uberti\n\nFootnote 8\n\nAs you know I disagree with the grants of nobiliary titles given from exile in every case, less and less if the grants come from descendants. Dr. Pier Felice degli Uberti\n\nFootnote 9 (edited by me, WHJ).\n\nOccasionally, on the Internet Newgroup, several have mistakenly written concerning the HONORS granted from the former King of the Rwanda. This has probably been caused in part by the ignorance (unscientific awareness) of some of the newsgroups’ frequent visitors who have seen certain web site references to European noble titles … granted by the King of Rwanda.\n\nThese people believe incorrectly that the King has placed himself into a position whereby he grants titles of nobility. This belief is incorrect and absolutely false. This can be understood by reading and understanding the ,… documents signed by the King.\n\nThe King is perfectly acquainted with the law in His Country and does not desire to, nor does He grant to individuals any European noble title (baron, count or marquis). To do so would be against the tradition of His reign as King of Rwanda and against the laws and culture of the country of Rwanda.\n\nIn commonsense terms, the King, in order to reward his faithful supporters who had worked with him in support of the causes of the Rwandan people, had decided as a “political plan” or course of action to create honors comparable or merely similar to the ancient European Noble Titles which had been granted from the European monarchs in the past or the present (as they are legally done today with full authority\n\nThe King knows well that his position is completely different from those held by current monarchs on the throne – who also have the tradition to grant noble titles\n\nThe position of King Kigeli … is one of a monarch outside of the throne or a FORMER ruler of a country … he does not have the prerogatives to grant a title of nobility in any way, much less according to the ancient rules based on the European model.\n\nHowever, it does not prohibit the Monarch from the granting of the honors that in this moment of time and space only have value to the inside or membership of his dynasty and between his diligent and loyal supporters. This does not however have any official value but reveals only a term of endearment.\n\nIn the document the King of the Rwanda engages himself with His word or promises as King to render these honors in Rwanda valid upon a day of the King’s return as Monarch to the throne, and obviously in that case He will change also the law in his Country in order to allow the full legal acknowledgment of these honors – honors that will perhaps then will also possess the European denomination of count, marquis, etc. King Kigeli is not the first African monarch who has adopted European denominations for noble titles, as has already happened in the Empire of the Central Africa (Bokassa).\n\nBut – I repeat – this is only a promised by the King and the honor will only have any value in the moment in which the King returns to the throne in Rwanda.\n\nNumerous previous histories exist relating to former monarchs who have granted titles of nobility, but even if the noble titles were in the tradition of their country, it is important to realize that no monarch removed from the throne has the legal right to grant noble titles. Perhaps in this case such titles are only known as titles of courtesy without any real value outside the dynasty or the supporters of that monarch.\n\nTherefore it is to be understood that there is no difference between monarchs with ancient custom or tradition of granting nobiliary titles and non-tradition, if neither monarch is currently on the throne or in common fact has been removed from said throne. No monarch removed from the throne has seen recognized of his titles granted by him from the exile. (exception – Carlist Spain).\n\nMoreover there are historical cases of Monarchs outside the throne who have granted noble titles with the promise to render them valid in the exact moment of their return to the throne (Two Sicilies, Montenegro, Yugoslavia) granted noble titles which they did not have right to grant because they did not exist in the tradition of their Country.\n\nI repeat – King Kigeli grants ONLY honors and not titles. Anyone may have a political agenda in order to resume the power in his Country and has the right to invent any strategy that can bring about the realization of that plan!!!\n\n…individuals receiving such “honors” from the King … only have effective value in the future event of the King returns to the Throne. Every other consideration is useless and demonstrates only a VERY bad acquaintance or awareness of the argument or a desire to not understand the truth.

Because this thing appeared … turned … to me as expert on the matter to help the King\n\nBecause some grants were still made it was necessary to correct and to justify these grants\n\nTo avoid damage to the King Kigeli …I advised about which right solution was possible in a still existing situation (this is the reason of this solution because it was conditioned by the existing reality.\n\nIf this reality was not existing clearly my advice should have been different and I had suggested to not create such kind of honours).\n\nEverybody knows that King Kigeli is not an expert about nobility or chivalric matter.\n\nIt is necessary to consider – as I made because so it was told me – that through these grants the King Kigeli was helping his people, without obtaining a personal benefit.\n\nBut I want to remember that by my point of view I don’t give value to these as other nobiliary titles or “chivalric” orders that today live only in the dreams of the persons who receive them.\n\nWhen a thing is private or of courtesy can remain only so!\n\nAnd clearly this is the case (as it is the case of all in Europe when the Sovereign is not on the throne).\n\nI met the King Kigeli in … March 2006\n\nAccording to the discussion with me and following my suggestion the King decided to grant only honors that are not nobiliary titles as in the European meaning.\n\nIn few words according to my advice the King of Rwanda decided to grant honours that can be comparable to the ancient European nobiliary titles… but in the sense it is given them after Napoleon I,that is only honours, although named nobiliary titles. The titles given after Napoleon – although they are nobiliary titles – have nothing to do with the concept of the past nobiliary titles (at least in great part of the Europe).\n\nIt is really a bit ridiculous that the King of Rwanda in exile grants honors which bring the name of ancient European nobiliary titles but as Macchiavelli affirmed “Il fine giustifica i mezzi” (the end justifies the means). In fact the King will do what He considers fit, and to grant these honors is useful to help His people. The honesty of the King stays in the promise that – if He returns to the throne – He will make valid these honors.\n\nI … am pragmatic and for me every title coming from a former Sovereign (or his descendants) has no legal public official value … not only Africa, but particularly old Europe. No official State Authority recognizes such titles (courtesy nobiliary titles), although there are today former European Royal Houses who continue to grant nobiliary titles … a recent fact.\n\nThe Rwanda Honors are honors that now have a moral value inside the Dynasty and among those who are supporters of King Kigeli. If Kigeli returns to the throne the honors will have effective value in a form that can be accepted by Kingdom of Rwanda. The honor (not the nobiliary title which did not exist in Rwanda) is immediately valid in private (as every honour or nobiliary title or chivalric order given by a private authority, a former Royal/Imperial House). But it is not possible to continue to think about the classical concept of nobility. But new times justify new solutions … the King of Rwanda has found new solutions.\n\nI received some emails asking my personal opinion about this.\n\nPublished in sections: Chivalty and Heraldry ::\n\nhttp://www.archival-project.com/showarticle.php?articleID=4\n\nThis article (San Francisco Call, Volume 102, Number 121, 29 September 1907) has been transcribed from the original scan. I have added comments and biographical notes to provide more information about the titled persons. The article gives insight in the social background of the new nobility.\n\nThe Papal Nobility of America\n\nIda Ryan\n\nMrs. THOMAS FORTUNE RYAN has been made a countess by Pope Pius X. This announcement comes close on the heels of the report that her husband is to be made a prince of the church. It has been whispered in high church circles in New York and in Rome that for the flrst time in years the red hat of a cardinal would be bestowed upon -a man of the world – and an American. While this report may be groundless, the fact has come to light that during the last few years what may possibly be termed a papal nobility has been created in the United States. Theoretically Pope Plus IX was a friend of the United States and an admirer of the church in this country, but not until the reign of Leo XIII and of the present pontiff has there been any acknowledgment of the high standing of the church in this country other than the creation of two cardinals in a hundred years. “Nobility lies not in heritage alone, but in the deeds of the living generations.” was one of the epigrams of Leo XIII. Taking this for his maxim, he placed the ancient titles of Rome upon men and women whose lives distinguished them among the good doers of the generation. Pius X has followed his policy. During the four years of his reign he has created an unprecedented number of nobles in recognition of both scientific achievement and – philanthropic work. While Pope Pius has accepted the precedent set by Leo XIII, which accorded to Cardinal Gibbons the distinction of being “the American cardinal,” and has intimated that during the life of his eminence no other prelate will be given the red hat, he has in every other way possible elevated the standing of the American church.\n\nThomas Fortune Ryan (1851–1928) was an American tobacco, insurance and transportation magnate. Although he lived in New York City for much of his adult career, Ryan was perhaps the greatest benefactor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond in the decades before the Great Depression. In addition to paying for schools, hospitals and other charitable works, Ryan’s donations paid for the construction of the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, Virginia. Ryan also made significant donations to Catholic institutions in New York City and Washington, D.C. (source: Wikipedia). As her husband’s wealth grew exponentially, Ida Barry Ryan began making large benefactions to Catholic charitable organizations in New York, Virginia, and across the country. The Ryans funded churches, convents and hospitals in Manhattan, including the architecturally important St. Jean Baptiste Catholic Church on the Upper East Side. In Washington, D.C., they paid for a gymnasium and dormitory at the Jesuit-founded Georgetown University. Pope Pius X recognized the couple’s generosity by naming him to the papal nobility and giving Ida Ryan the cross Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice for her work in the Diocese. The couple’s lifetime contributions to Catholic charities around the country totalled $20 million.\n\nThe raising of Mrs. Ryan (1854-1917) to the Catholic nobility was expected by many prelates in this country during Pops Leo’s administration. Decorations and privileges were accorded to her, but the rank of countess was held in the country only by Mils Annie Leary. Mrs. Ryan, the builder of churches and iiospitals and schools, the story of whose remarkable life was recently told in the Herald, never has sough any recognition for her deeds. While it Is known that she gives away $1,000,000 a year for charitable purposes, little Is known of her philanthropy. She has built more churches and schools in the United States than any other person in the entire world. The number of these gifts alone exceeds 30 and there is hardly a Catholic church or Institution In the eastern states or in the southwestern section to which she has not lent material aid. In placing the title of “Countess Ida” upon Mrs. Ryan Pope Pius is said to have remarked that it was not alone for the cathedrals and churches and public institutions with which Mrs. Ryan has enriched the church in this country that she has been made a member of the Vatican nobility, but more especially because of the daily Christian life she leads. Few religious orders require from their nuns more of abstinence and labor and prayer than Mrs. Ryan gives every day of her life. She begins her morning by attending mass, and from that time until she retires at night her mind and her hands are ever busy in some good work. She is a lover of working men and women, and her munificence has done much to relieve the burdens of hundreds In New York and In the far west, where she has materially aided destitute consumptives. She gave to Virginia Its cathedral at Richmond, which cost $ 1.000.000.\n\nAnnie Leary\n\nThe only other papal countess la the United States is the Countess Annie Leary, whose title was ctven by Pope Leo XIII, and expired at the pontiffs death. One of the first acts of Pope Pius’ administration waa to renew the Countess Leary’s title, with that of from other temporary nobility. Countess Leary received the title because of her extensive work for the “Welfare of working girls and emigrants. Years ago, when she very young girl, before the emigrants bureau was as well organized as it is now and prior to the time when State street was lined with homes for emigrant girls, terrible stories of the snares and temptations which were laid In the way of young girls coming as strangers to this land reached the ears of Miss Leery. She was horrified at such conditions and determined to try to find a remedy for the evil. She possessed an ample fortune and she resolved to share it with her less fortunate sisters. She gave freely to the support and management of the Irish emigrants’ home, at No. 7 State street, and also aided the German and Italian homes around Castle Garden, where a housed that steady stream of friendless girls coming to these shores to seek true honest living. But even those homes where the girls were taken on their arrival here did not solve the problem. Places of employment were found for them, and yet too often they went out Into a world they so little understood, unlearned of the ways of the world, unfitted to cope with the conditions friendless girl has to meet. Many ol those girls were of simple faith and trusting natures, and the stories which reached the ears of the clergy and those interestet in the question necessitated some action.\n\nCountess Leary learned some of these facts from her own servant girls. She became Interested, made Investigations and then resolved upen a line of action. She was the mind and often the means of establishing working girls’ clubs and homes, there being a regular network of them throughout, the east and lower west sides. She has devoted most of her life to this work, giving her personal attention and encouragement to these institutions. She goes, among the girls and hears their stories, their little problems and their great troubles. Any woman’s heart oppressed finds eympathy and encouragement from Countess Leary. Her heart has a b!g place in it for all wage earning women.\n\nCountess Leary is a stanch American and, realizing that the future of the state lies In the children of today, she spends much of her time and her wealth for the boys and girls of the poor. She has established boys’ clubs and gymnasiums and girls’, clubs and reading rooms and sewing clubs and playrooms for the youth of the other half. At Christmas and New Year’s and Thanksgiving and national feast days the countess arranges celebrations In the various Institutions she is interested in. Christmas eve of every year she assembles several hundred little tots and gives to each of them a warm, pretty cap and coat, besides candies and a book of some kind. “The Man Without a Country” Is one of her favorite books for boys, and she has given many copies of it. In addition to her charities among children and working women, Countess Leary has lent much aid to hospital work for the poor. She Is a patron’ of all the children’s hospitals and goes often with flowers and dainty foods and pleasing toys to visit the unfortunate young folk. Countess Leary presented to Bellevue-hospital the fine chapel which was built there several years ago. Another pretty charity of hers is to send a beautiful quantity of pure, rich cream for the ward patients at various hospitals on hot days.\n\nAnnie Leary (1832 – 1919) was the daughter of the hatter James Leary who was a childhood friend of William Backhouse Astor Sr., then, later bought many beaver pelts from William’s father John Jacob Astor and operated a shop in the basement of the original Astor House Hotel across from New York City Hall. She had three brothers Arthur, Daniel, and George who made a fortune in shipping during the U.S. Civil War. Arthur was a bachelor who Annie accompanied to society functions in New York City as well as Newport, Rhode Island. It has been suggested that James friendship with the Astors is what led to Arthur and in turn Annie’s being the only Catholics to be included on Caroline Astor’s “The 400”. When Arthur died she inherited his fortune as well as his social prominence and recognition via the aforementioned 400 list. Coming into large sums of money Annie Leary soon became an ardent philanthropist. Among her notable bequests was the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament at Bellevue Hospital (dedicated 1897 – razed 1938 in order to make way for a Bellevue administration building which encompasses a new chapel where the original stained glass panels including nine made in Munich remain today) the first Catholic chapel at Bellevue. It was dedicated in memory of her late brother Arthur (source: Wikipedia).\n\nArchbishop Farley\n\nTo Archbishop Farley, whom Pope Pius greatly esteems, the pontiff has given a court of monsignor, which lends to any diocesan ceremony a dignity of splender which is found nowhere outside Rome. At the consecration of the cathedral, which occurs, it is planned, soon after the work is entirely finished on the Lady chapel, there will be, in addition to the archbishop and his coadjutor, Bishop Cusick, the archbishop’s seven diocesan bishops, 25 purple robed monsignori and seven lay nobles around the episcopal throne.\n\nJohn Murphy Farley (April 20, 1842 – September 17, 1918) was an Irish-born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of New York from 1902 until his death in 1918, and created a cardinal in 1911 (source: Wikipedia).\n\nJoseph Florimond Loubat\n\nThe only papal duke the United States has ever claimed is the duke de Loubat., the last son of the aristocratic family of that name. The title was conferred by Pope Leo in recognition of the duke de Loubat’s generous support of Catholic and nonsectarian schools and colleges. Duke de Loubat lent his aid to every Catholic college in this country and to many in France. He gave a million dollar endowment to Columbia university at the time when is was in financial straits. He also added much to Columbia library. He was made duke in 1898. He decides his time between New York and Paris and swell known in France as a man of great learning and philanthropy. Is a graduate of the University of Paris.\n\nJoseph Florimond Loubat (January 21, 1831 – March 1, 1927) was a French and American bibliophile, antiquarian, sportsman, and philanthropist. He was ennobled as Duc de Loubat by Pope Leo XIII in 1893 (source: Wikipedia).\n\nLoubat was a philanthropist who gave in 1898 Columbia University a gift of $1.1 million in property, and later gave Columbia money to fund the Loubat Prize. He also endowed chairs at several universities across Europe and the United States, including Columbia. He donated a statue of Pope Leo XIII to The Catholic University of America in 1891.\n\nLoubat contributed monetary funds towards the founding of the Musée d’Ethnographie du Trocadéro and Musée de l’Homme in Paris. Loubat also donated to the American Museum of Natural History a large collection of Mexican archaeological artifacts assembled on his behalf by Edward Seler in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico; a series of casts of the original Cotzumalhuapa sculptures from the ruins of Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa, Guatemala, kept in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin; a photographic copy of the “Codex Legislatif,” an ancient Aztec codex, preserved in the Library of the Chamber of Deputies, Paris; and a facsimile of the “Codex Vaticanus, No. 3773,” an ancient Aztec book preserved in the Vatican Library, Rome (source: Wikipedia).\n\nJohn D. Crimmins\n\nJohn D. Crimmins has recently made a count by Pope Pius X. Mr Crimmins is a trustee of St. Patrick’s cathedral and is a member of nearly all the boards of importance in archbishop’s Farley’s diocese. The scarlet cloak of the Knight of St. Gregory was given to Mr. Crimmins as a token of the pope’s of his work for the church in New York. Count Crimmin’s most distinguished gift in the diocese is the splendid monastery at Hunts point, where he established the Dominican Sisters of Perpetual Adoration. These nuns devote their lives to prayer, and some one of their order kneels every hour of the night and day before the chapel alter in the monastery.\n\nBorn in New York City to Irish immigrant parents, John Daniel Crimmins attended the College of St. Francis Xavier (now Xavier High School). After graduating he took a job at his father’s contracting firm, eventually taking over the business. His firm employed some 12,000 workers. It built more than 400 buildings in New York City and most of the elevated railways. He was also involved in local politics, serving as New York City Parks Commissioner. Crimmins was one of the few Catholic millionaires of his time and he was an active benefactor of the Archdiocese of New York. Among the building projects he aided was that of St. Joseph’s Seminary, Yonkers. Crimmins was named a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great and a Papal Count. He was active in Irish-American organizations, particularly the American-Irish Historical Society. He wrote two books on Irish-American history (source: patheos.com). Pictures of his house van be found here.\n\nMartin Maloney\n\nMarquis Maloney, beter known to the political and financial world as Martin Maloney, received his title about six years ago at the request of cardinal Satolli, whom the marquis met when the cardinal was papal delegate for this country. A strong friendship developed here between the prince of the church and the American millionaire. Some time after Cardinal Satolli was called back to Rome, Marquis Maloney went to Italy on a visit and the friendship was renewed. The American when taken to the dilapidated ruins of St. John’s cathedral asked how much it would take to reconstruct the ancient structure.\n\n“How much money?” asked Cardinal Satolli. “Why, who ever thought about that? It would take at least $ 50.000 and that amount might be spent to better advantage.”.\n\n“It might, but it won’t” remarked Martin Maloney, and the very next day saw work begun on the cathedral. It is said that twice $50.000 was spent on the work. While this gift is accredited as the cause of the bestowal of the noble title on Marin Maloney, it is by no means his largest gift to the church.\n\nHe has just given to to Pennsylvania a home for aged men and women, the building alone of which will cost $ 150.000. This home will be dedicated to Martin Maloney’s father and mother, who, when they emigrated to this country from Ireland many years ago, made their first humble home in Scranton. It was here that Marquis Maloney spent his boyhood.\n\nAt the time of the expulsion of the nuns in France four years ago Marquis Maloney went abroad with a definite purpose in mind. He purchased many of the small convents with the nuns had been ordered to vacate and held them as his private property in order that the religious might not be disturbed. Among the larger convents he purchased was that of the Little Sisters of the Assumption in Paris, where Marquis Maloney’s two daughters, Margaret and Katherine, were educated. After the death of the older daughter, Margaret, Marquis Maloney built near his summer house at Spring Lake N.J. one of the handsomest churches in this country, which he dedicated to his daughter and called St. Margaret’s.\n\nMaloney Hall is the home of the Busch School of Business and Economics at The Catholic University of America. It is located on the southeast corner of Catholic University’s main campus. Maloney Hall was named for Martin Maloney, a Philadelphia philanthropist and papal marquis (a layman who has received a high title of nobility from the reigning pope), who gave $120,000 for the main building and $100,000 for the auditorium. The building originally housed the Martin Maloney Chemical Laboratory, the laboratory where the chemical weapon lewisite was first invented by Julius Nieuwland and later Winford Lee Lewis, with the help of CUA and Army researchers, developed it into a now-banned chemical weapon. It served as a laboratory for Armyresearchers developing chemical munitions for World War I (source: Wikipedia).\n\nJohn Goode\n\nCount John Goode of Brooklyn and Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet of New York aro the only two Americans who, have been titled by Rome in recognition of signal scientific achievements. Count Goede, well known as an inventor, was given his title after evolvIng a machine for the making of ropes. Until this time all the rope made was twisted by hand, and for this labor young boys and girls were employed, the wages paid being too small for the employment of men. Count Goode at that time was a very rich man, having amassed a fortune in the cordage business. He used to stand and watch the boys and girls at the hard labor of rope twisting, and determined to evolve a method for lightening this work. The machine he invented resulted in revolutionizing the cordage enterprise In the world. Count Goude Is a very devoted Catholic and has given much of his wealth to the Brooklyn diocese. He enriched Brooklyn by the church of St. John.\n\nThomas Addis Emmet\n\nThomas Addis Emmet is the latest member of the papal knighthood. He was vested, with the scarlet cape and sword In Archbishop Farley’s residence last spring and will appear in his regalia at the formal celebration In the cathedral this fall. Dr Emmet is a proud descendant of Robert Emmet. He was Knighted in recognition of his medical research.\n\nCharles Astor Bristed\n\nCharles Astor Bristed, grandson of William Astor has for a ‘number of years been conspicuous at all the state ceremonies at St. Patrlck’s cathedral, where. with his cape and sword he has, according to the privileges of his title, knelt in the sanctuary to participate in the ‘ceremonies. Sir Charles Brlsted was knighted for his widespread philanthropies and his strict adherence to his church.\n\nWilliam J. Onahan\n\nWilliam J. Onahan of Chicago who was made a knight of St. Gregory by Pope Leo, has enjoyed the actual privileges of his title probably more than any other member of the nobility in this country. He spends a great deal of his time abroad and is a frequent visitor at the Vatican. Accordingly to his rank, he can I enter the Vatican at any time without seeking permission for asking an audience. He was in the Vatican at the time of the death of Pope Leo and was in the very room where the late pontiff’s body was carried to be laid in state. According to ancient customs, the gates were locked at that time and Sir William Onahan was cloistered in the Vatican the remainder of the night.\n\nAfter ,the death of his mother the family struggled along in Liverpool for a while. Then the voice that had called them from Ireland called again. The little home was again broken up and the Onahan family set sail for America. The voyage took six weeks in a sailing vessel and they reached the harbor of New York on St. Patrick’s day. There was a small boyish figure in the prow of the ship, and two little girls by his side all looking eagerly to the land in which their lot was to be cast. Bands were playing, men were marching, the green flag was flying everywhere. It was a happy omen to the young Irish lad whose staunch Americanism was to be all the hardier for the Celtic root from which it sprang.\n\nArrived in New York he immediately got a job in a lawyer’s office, sweeping and dusting and doing the usual office chores for the munificent sum of $1.00 per month and his board and clothes. Once in later life when he was testifying in a lawsuit the judge said to him: Mr. Onahan, from your answers you must have studied law.” No. your honor,” he replied, ^Hhe only law I ever studied was what I picked up in the sweepings of a lawyer’s office in New York when I was a lad.” But he had the legal mind (source: Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society (1908-1984) Vol. 11, No. 4 (Jan., 1919), pp. 636-653).\n\nJohn Creighton\n\nCount John Creighton of Omaha. Neb., who died, last month, was ono of the best known members of the papal nobility. He donated to Nebraska the Creighton university, the largest university In that state, and also gave several hospitals and a number of churches to Omaha.\n\nCount John Andrew Creighton (October 15, 1831 – February 7, 1907) was a pioneer businessman and philanthropist in Omaha, Nebraska who founded Creighton University. The younger brother of Edward Creighton, John was responsible for a variety of institutions throughout the city of Omaha, and was ennobled by Pope Leo XIII in recognition of his contributions to Creighton University, the Catholic community in Omaha, and the city of Omaha in general. From its founding in 1878 to the time of his death in 1907 Creighton was said to have donated at least $2,000,000 to Creighton University. In 1888 Creighton financed the Creighton University Observatory, and in 1898 he gave money towards a medical school, which was named in his honor. In 1904 he created the Edward Creighton Institute. Creighton is also credited with establishing Omaha’s St. Joseph’s Hospital and bringing the first monastery of the Poor Clares in the country to the city. He paid for almost the entire cost of St. John’s Parish at Creighton, where the cornerstone was laid in 1888. Today Creighton University in Omaha is viewed as being named in honor of the entire Creighton family, particularly John and his brother Edward, as well as their wives Sara and Emily. He was named a Knight of St. Gregory on January 15, 1895 by Pope Leo XIII, and in 1898 was titled a Count by the same. In 1900 Creighton received the Laetare Medal from the University of Notre Dame. Omaha’s John A. Creighton Boulevard was named after him immediately after his death in 1907, as is the existent “John A. Creighton University Professorship” at Creighton University (source: Wikipedia).\n\nAdrian Iselin\n\nAdrin Iselin Is amons the prominent New York men who have received titles from Rome. Mr. Iselin was vested with the cape and sword of the Knights of St. Gregory soon after the beginning of the present administration. One of Sir Adrian Iselin’s most valuable gifts to New York is the $150,000 chapel at New Rochells. This was presented to the diocese after the crest of St. Gregory was bestowed upon him.\n\nAdrian Georg Iselin (January 17, 1818 – March 28, 1905) was a New York financier who invested in and developed real estate, railroads, and mining operations. For many years during his early business career he was engaged in importing with his brother, William Iselin, being one of the most successful merchants of New York in the middle of the century. After retiring from the importing trade, he established the banking house of Adrian Iselin & Co. He is considered the founder of the Iselin family in the United States.\n\nEleanora O’Donnell Iselin (1821–1897) was born into one of Baltimore, Maryland’s most prominent and wealthy families. In 1845 she married Adrian Iselin, an affluent banker and dry goods merchant. The Iselins lived in New York City, where they were active members of high society and supporters of the city’s cultural centers, including the Metropolitan Opera House, the American Museum of Natural History, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Eleanora’s daughters Georgine and Emily commissioned the portrait from Sargent in the spring of 1888, as the artist’s first professional visit to America was nearing its end (source: National Gallery of Art).\n\nAccording to family tradition, when Sargent arrived at the Iselin home for the sitting, Mrs. Iselin entered the drawing room followed by a maid carrying an armful of ball gowns and asked him which one he wanted her to wear. To her dismay, Sargent insisted on painting her exactly as she stood without even removing her hand from the table. Some art historians have suggested that this interaction explains the sitter’s somewhat severe expression. When late in life Sargent was asked if he remembered Mrs. Iselin, he diplomatically replied, “Of course! I cannot forget that dominating little finger.” (Source: National Gallery of Art).\n\nRichard C. Kerens\n\nRichard C. Kerens of St. Louis, railroadman and politician. Is a chamberlain to Pope Pius-X. Mr. Kerens, who came to America a poor emigrant boy, went west and amassed a fortune, has carried through his life the strong Roman faith instilled to him by his Irish mother. With his Increased prosperity he has given accordingly to his church. He has enriched the St. Louis university, which is under the direction of the Jesuits, and the Catholic university of America, at Washington, and has aided nearly every charitable institution in St. Louis. He has also done much for institutions in his native land and for Irish charitable enterprises in this country. It Is said that Mr. Kerens is trying to purchase a strip of land in Rome which will reach from the Vatican to the sea, in order to give to the pope a greater freedom and to relieve his present restrictions, which forbid him leaving the Vatican grounds. It is understood that Mr. Kerens has offered $5,000,000 for this purpose.\n\nKerens was born in Killberry, County Meath, Ireland, and was brought to the U. S. in infancy. He was educated in the public schools of Jackson Co., Iowa. Throughout the Civil War he served in the Union army. After the war he lived in Arkansas and at San Diego, Cal., and was contractor for the Overland Mail. In 1876 he moved to St. Louis, Mo., and thereafter was interested in the construction of railroads and was active in the Republican politics of Missouri. In 1892 he became a member of the Republican National Committee. From 1909 to 1913 he was Ambassador to Austria-Hungary (source: Wikipedia).\n\nEugene and Thomas Kelly\n\nAmong the younger members of the nobility in the United States areEugene and Thomas Kelly, sons of the late Eugene Kelly, a New York banker, who gave the white marble Lady Chapel to St. Patrick’s cathedral. Eugene and Thomas Kelly were made Knights of St. Gregory, with the title of sIr.\n\nThe Order of the Knights of St Gregory was reorganized by Pope Gregory XVI In 1831 since which time Catholics who are not of the state nobility or aristocracy have been vested with the title.\n\nEllen Ewing Sherman and Mary Caldwell\n\nThe late Mrs. Tecumseh Sherman was decorated several times by pope Leo for her charitable work. Mary Caldwell, the Virginia, beauty, now the Marquise de Merinville (Mary Gwendolen Caldwell, Marquise de Merinville, Laetare Medalist, VOL_0032_ISSUE_0023, 1899), and who before her marriage presented to the hierarchy of the United States the funds for the establishment of the Catholic university at Washington, was also decorated.\n\nEllen Ewing Sherman (October 4, 1824 – November 28, 1888), was the wife of General William Tecumseh Sherman, a leading Union general in the American Civil War. She was also a prominent figure of the times in her own right. Like her mother, Ellen was a devout Catholic and often at odds with her husband over religious topics. Ellen raised her eight children in that faith. In 1864, Ellen took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana, to have her young family educated at the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary’s College. One of their sons, Thomas Ewing Sherman, became a Catholic priest. She also took an ongoing interest in Indian missions and was credited as the principal organizer of the Catholic Indian Missionary Association. In “the most absorbing and monumental work of her life,” Ellen played an active role in U.S. observances of the Golden Jubilee of Pope Pius IX (May 21, 1877) for which she later received the personal thanks of the Pope (source: Wikipedia).\n\nMary Elizabeth Breckenridge and Mary Guendaline Byrd Caldwell were the daughters of William Shakespeare Caldwell who made his fortune building and operating gas plants throughout the Midwest. Both daughters married titled European aristocrats. Mary Guendaline was first engaged to the Prince Joachim Murat, the grandson of the King of Naples, who was not only twice her age but an invalid. The engagement was canceled when the couple could not agree on how much of Miss Caldwell’s fortune was to be given to the Prince.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Joseph Kulage\n\nMr. and Mrs. Joseph Kulage of St. Louis, Mo, are the latest additions to the Catholic nobility in the country. They were both knighted by Pope Pius X on August 20 with the Order of St. Gregory, and the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Mr. Kulage is created a knight commander of the Gregorian Order, a distinction to few men outside of Rome, and Mrs. Kulage is termed a “Matronae” or lady knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre. This is the first tlma this honor has been conferred upon a woman.\n\nThe Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulcher, is one of the most ancient orders in existence, having been founded in the thirteenth century during the crusades. The pope himself is the supreme master of the noble order. The insignia of the order is a Jerusalem cross, which is really a combination of five crosses In one. The insignia, is almost entirely of gold, but the obverse and reverse sides are overlaid with crimson enamel. In addition to the cross Mrs. Kulage will appear at all state functions in a mantle of white cloth upon which is embroidered in gold the Insignia of her rank. Mr and Mrs. Kulage been elevated to the Catholic nobility in recognition of their charitable and educational work, especially among the children of the poor in Rome. [the original article ends here]\n\nThe historical origins of the Order are somewhat obscure, although according to an undocumented tradition they are traced back to the First Crusade. In fact, the first documentary evidence of an investiture of Knights referred to as “of the Holy Sepulchre” dates to 1336. Since this first testament to the Order’s existence, that is, from the XIV century, the popes gradually and regularly expressed their desire to juridically annex the organization to the Holy See.\n\nThe Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem has always benefited from the protection of the Popes who, over the centuries, have reorganized it, augmenting and enriching its privileges. Clement VI entrusted custody of the Holy Sepulchre to the Franciscan friars in 1342, but that was still during an era when Knights alone had the right to create other members of the Order. Alexander VI declared himself the supreme moderator of the Order in 1496, and delegated to the Franciscans the power to bestow a knighthood upon nobles and gentlemen pilgrims on pilgrimage to the Holy Land (power of investiture). Confirmation of this Franciscan privilege, either verbally or by papal Bull, was renewed by Pope Leo X in 1516, by Benedict XIV in 1746, until the restoration of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem by Pius IX in 1847.\n\nThus the pontifical delegation was transferred to the Patriarch when, in 1868, Pius IX issued Apostolic letters announcing the restoration of the Order. The Order of Knights opened up with the appointment of the Dames of the Holy Sepulcher thanks to Leo XIII, in 1888. Moreover, in 1907 Pius X decided that the title of Grand Master of the Order would be reserved to the Pope himself.\n\nIn 1932 Pius XI approved the new Constitution and permitted Knights and Dames to receive their investiture in their places of origin and not only in Jerusalem. In 1940, Pius XII named a cardinal as Protector of the Order and centralized the organization in Rome, as part of the Grand Magisterium, transferring the title of Grand Master to Cardinal Canali. John XXIII approved the new Constitution presented by Cardinal Tisserant in 1962.\n\nWith the renewal of the Second Vatican Council, a new Constitution was approved by Paul VI in 1977. Following this, John Paul II made the Order a legal canonical and public personality, constituted by the Holy See. Today the Order seeks to garner the commitment of its members in local churches hopeful for their sanctification. This is the essential and profound reason that motivated the revision of the Constitution during the “Consulta” that took place in 2013 (source: The Vatican).\n\nConclusions\n\nMost persons that were ennobled, were of Irish catholic descent. Emigration to the United States increased exponentially due to the Great Famine in the mid 1800s. In the 19th century United States, Irish catholics faced hostility and violence. By the 20th century, Irish Catholics were well established in the United States. The extremely wealthy ones, who were also devoted to catholicism and donated large amounts of money to the church and other good works, were ennobled or obtained a knighthood from the church. In this context it cannot be said that nobility was ‘bought’. Spiritualism and good works, in most cases, led to the rewards. The titles are part of this spiritual experience. Women played an important role in this context.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis weekend, I had the pleasure of attending a very interesting lecture, given by a good friend, regarding the history of the Knights Templar (1119-1307). The lecture mentioned the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (OSMTH) as a modern successor of the ideology of this ancient and famous Order.\n\nThe original order of the Knights Templar was founded by Hugh de Payens, a French nobleman from the Champagne region, along with eight of his companions, in Jerusalem around 1119. The Knights Templar, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, became an important charity throughout Christendom, thus growing rapidly and becoming a very powerful Christian institution. The knights were prominent in international finance and were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. In 1307, Philip IV of France arrested the Knights Templar on charges of blasphemy, idolatry, and sodomy. The investigation and trial into the alleged misdeeds of the Knights Templar took place in Rome between 1307 and 1312. On 18 March 1314, the Grandmaster and other knights of the Order were burned alive by order of King Philip. In September 2001, Barbara Frale, an Italian paleographer, found a copy of a document, known as the ‘Chinon Parchment in the Vatican Secret Archives. The document explicitly confirms that in 1308, Pope Clement V absolved Jacques de Molay and other leaders of the Order including Geoffroi de Charney and Hugues de Pairaud (Barbara Frale 2004, “The Chinon chart – Papal absolution to the last Templar, Master Jacques de Molay”, Journal of Medieval History 30 (2): 109–134). Another Chinon parchment, dated 20 August 1308 and addressed to Philip IV of France, stated that absolution had been granted to all those Templars that had confessed to heresy “and restored them to the Sacraments and to the unity of the Church” (Pierre Dupuy, Histoire de l’Ordre Militaire des Templiers Foppens, Brusselles 1751; Étienne Baluze, Vitae Paparum Avenionensis, 3 Volumes, Paris 1693. Nonetheless, the Pope suspended the order (see appendix 1, below for the details).\n\nWikipedia describes the OSMTH as follows:\n\nThe Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, (Latin: Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani, OSMTH), is a self-styled order founded in 1945 by Antonio Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes (1878-1960), claiming to be a continuation of the self-styled l’Ordre du Temple founded in France, 1705, officially reconstituted in 1804 by Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, and recognized as an Order of Chivalry by its patron Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805; Fernando Campello Pinto Pereira de Sousa Fontes succeeded his father as the head of the order in 1960.\n\nWikipedia\n\nIt is interesting to see to what extent the current OSMTH can be seen as a successor of the ideology of the ancient Templer Order.\n\nInspiration\n\nAn important personality regarding the revival of Templer history was Andrew Michael Ramsay. Raised a Calvinist, Ramsay converted to Catholicism in 1709. Leaving England for Holland in 1709, he soon moved to Cambrai (France) where he lived with the well-known mystical theologian, François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon (1651-1715), Archbishop of Cambrai.\n\nIn 1713 or 1714, Ramsay moved to Blois where he was employed as secretary to a co-founder of Quietism (a Christian philosophy), Madame Guyon. In 1716 Ramay moved to Paris, where he spent the rest of his life in and near that city (Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, pp. 280-315 vol 81 (1968). Much of Ramsay’s life is only known from Anecdotes de la vie de Messire André Michel de Ramsay, a manuscript dictated by Ramsay, currently stored in the Bibliotèque Méjanes at Aix-en-Provence. Cited AQC, vol 81 (1968). Cf. Mackey’s Encyclopedia for a 1680 birth date).\n\nIn Paris, Ramsay met the Duc d’Orleans, who admitted Ramsay as a member of the Royal and Military Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem. This entitled him to use the prefix Chevalier. James, the Old Pretender, granted Ramsay a certificate of nobility in 1723. In 1728 he succeeded in having a diploma of nobility registered by the King of Arms in Edinburgh (Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, pp. 280-315 vol 81, 1968). In his famous Oration of 1737, Ramsay suggested that Freemasons were closely connected to the Knights Templar:\n\nAt the time of the Crusades in Palestine many princes, lords and citizens associated themselves and vowed to restore the temple of the Christians in the Holy Land, to employ themselves in bringing back their architecture to its first institution. They agreed upon several ancient signs and symbolic words drawn from the well of religion in order to recognize themselves amongst the heathen and the Saracens. These signs and words were only communicated to those who promised solemnly, even sometimes at the foot of the altar, never to reveal them. This sacred promise was therefore not an execrable oath, as it has been called, but a respectable bond to unite Christians of all nationalities in one confraternity. Sometime after our Order formed an intimate union with the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. From that time our Lodges took the name of Lodges of St. John. This union was made after the example set by the Israelites when they erected the second Temple who, whilst they handled the trowel and mortar with one hand, in the other held the sword and buckler.\n\nGould’s History of Freemasonry – Vol. III, page 11, Compiled and Edited by R.’.W.’.
