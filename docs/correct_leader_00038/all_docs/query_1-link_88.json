Koridon FROM THE EDITOR Editor: R. F. Snow guarantee both. Such lofty words, however, need translation into political reality. Democracy has to be lived. Once more the country is readying itself for general elections. The third time in four years. To some this constitutes proof that the democratic process is very much alive in the Antilles. And, no doubt, it is. Be it, as everywhere else, to a certain extent and constantly endangered from within. But true as that may be it should first of all be remembered that the Nether¬ lands Antilles belong to that very small family of na¬ tions in which constitutional democracy functions. To quote Dr. Henry Kissinger: “the reality is that constitutional democracy, which we consider 'nor¬ mal' is, in fact, a rarity both in the sweep of history and on the breadth of this planet”. The question then is whether we should consider it 'normal' or cherish it as a most precious possession. To speak of democracy as a possession does not give proper due to the concept. Essentially it is rooted in an attitude which a nation as a whole and its citizens individually have to attain time and again. An at¬ titude of respect for the freedom of the individual and of concern for the common good or in a more abstract sense for the constitution which is meant to The phenomenon of a relatively large number of parties contending for the voter’s favour is in this re¬ spect not encouraging. Besides causing a spread of competence, which a small country cannot permit it¬ self, it indicates an inability to practise and allow op¬ position within the existing parties. As a result the people are not given a choice between programmes but between contending groups of politicians. A dangerous development as it can easily lead to invest¬ ing authority in personalities. The inevitable disappointment of large numbers with the political system provides fertile ground for those who propagate government by 'the people'. An attractive slogan, which in fact means only one thing: the growth of state power exercised by a small ideological elite. And as the people can never oppress itself, that power soon becomes absolute. Awareness of weaknesses and dangers should moti¬ vate the electorate to exercise its voting right in a re¬ sponsible manner. With a view to the democratic tradition of the Antilles there needs to be no doubt that common sense will again prevail.

Luiten on “Law and Lan¬ guage”, which contained from the very beginning to the very end a number of contradictions and allegations which do call for clarification. To begin with, Mr. W. Luiten wrongly states that part of the educational policy report deals with the regulation of the lan¬ guage situation in the Nether¬ lands Antilles. This statement in itself is a clear indication that Mr. W. Luiten had not read or even seen the provisional draft of the educational policy report. For if he had, he would have no¬ ticed that said draft report .was written by the committee which was charged with setting up a policy to restructure the educa¬ tional system in the Netherlands Antilles. Mr. Luiten would have also seen that nowhere in this re¬ port was mention made of regu¬ lating the language situation in the Netherlands Antilles. There is indeed a separate draft report on regulating the langua¬ ge situation in the Netherlands Antilles drawn up by the Lin¬ guistic Institute at the end of last year. This report titled: “Aanzet tot re- gulering van de Antilliaanse Taalsituatie” (Towards the Regu- larisation of the Antillean Lan¬ guage Situation) was dissemina¬ ted among various institutions which were requested to com¬ ment on it. The basic proposal contained therein was the recog¬ nition of both English and Papia- mentu as official languages alongside Dutch. Mr. Luiten who mentions only Papiamentu as the language pro¬ posed for official recognition, therefore, either blatantly disre¬ garded this document in his arti¬ cle or was completely ignorant of it or perhaps, more likely, ill-di¬ gested this and the previously mentioned draft report on Edu¬ cational Policy (De Beleidsnota: “Education for one and all”. For a start, he admits the need for the official recognition of Pa¬ piamentu yet, he wastes no time to state categorically that “noth¬ ing else but Dutch” can be used within our judiciary. He acknowl¬ edges the “emancipating” func¬ tions of such official recognition but declares, without hesitation, that “it must be absolutely ruled out that we would be able to build a legal science that is enti¬ rely our own”. He further asserts that abandoning Dutch “will des¬ tabilize our legal and govern¬ mental system”, yet proposes that “a system other than the Dutch one could be adopted and adjus¬ ted to our own circumstances.” Suffice it to add just another ex¬ ample in this catalogue of contra¬ dictions. Mr. Luiten, who proba¬ bly is in the legal profession, ad¬ mits that a foreign physician or a teacher coming to work in Cura¬ sao may be required to function in Papiamentu. But why does he rule out such a requirement for a jurist? What underlies all these contra¬ dictions? Fear! Fear seems to be the key to Mr. Luiten’s distortion of facts. The fear of the Dutch language being eventually aban¬ doned in favour of Papiamentu and English. However, and this is most significant, nowhere in ei¬ ther of the two relevant draft po¬ licy reports is there any proposal to eliminate Dutch as official lan¬ guage. The only relevant docu¬ ment in this regard is the one submitted by the Linguistic Insti¬ tute which recommends the offi¬ cial recognition of English and Papiamentu next to Dutch. Thus, instead of Dutch alone being the official language of the Nether¬ lands Antilles, English and Papia¬ mentu would also become official languages. The proposal to have three in¬ stead of one official language cannot certainly be so frighte¬ ning. It would only mean transla¬ ting into law what is to a great extent- already the linguistic si¬ tuation of the Netherlands Anti¬ lles. Canada, Switzerland, and several other countries in the world, not¬ withstanding their current stage of socio-economic development, have more than one official lan¬ guage. In his confusion, Mr. Luiten ig¬ norantly considers the terms “le¬ gal system” and “legal science” to be synonimous, and consequent¬ ly, equates the language used in the judiciary to the legal system. This is obviously wrong. Any lan¬ guage could be used in a legal system, even where the laws are not written in that language. Conversely, any set of laws can be translated into any language. It is, in fact, appropiate to ask, at this point, what kind of justice can be expected if the people do not understand the language in which their laws are written? Mr. Luiten’s article clearly and meticulously omits any mention of the Dutch Windward Islands. However, it would seem that in his view, the judiciary should use Dutch to the exclusion of English on these islands, where — as a matter of fact — English general¬ ly functions as official language. Striking is also Mr. Luiten’s fake identification with the Antilles, which is revealed in his constant switch between the use of “they” in . . . “therefore they have to continue being linked to another legal system”, and “we” as in the sentence: “It must be absolutely ruled out that we would be able to build up a legal science that is entirely our own”. In both cases he is referring to the Nether¬ lands Antilles. Of course, Mr. Luiten may not be an “expert” in liguistic or language problems. That alone could explain why he could not have addressed himself to such crucial language issues in any scientific manner. Drs. L. Richardson Linguistic Institute of the Department of Education. 4 NATIONAL Nine Key Questions With a view to the upcoming elections AR invited leading politicians to write down their answers to nine key questions. The replies of mr. Au¬ gustin Diaz, mr. Juancho Evertsz and mr. Don Martina are printed un¬ derneath. Future Status A change in the relationship between the Netherlands Antilles and Holland and between the respective islands seems by now inevitable. It is felt by many that in the ongoing debate most politicians react to what others say rather than come forward with their own vision. 1. Could you state briefly but clearly your party’s views with regard to the future relationship with Holland and what you see as the ideal with regard to the relationship between your island and the other five? 2. In order to prepare for the future status as envisaged by your party, what specific measures of preparation should be taken and how much time would you allow for that purpose? 3. With a view to the above and the developments in the region (East-West confrontation) are you satisfied with the present arrangement by which the Crown takes charge of foreign policy or do you envisage an in¬ creasingly active role in this respect by the Antilles themselves, and what position does your party take with regard to the mentioned confrontation? Maintaining the exis¬ ting political structu¬ re is one of the few so¬ lutions our party sees at the moment. The relation between the islands, however, has to be reviewed with¬ out delay and espe¬ cially Aruba has to clearly define its standpoint. It is evident that independence at this moment is not feasible. It would be ideal, if the six islands were to stay together. However, it has become quite clear that this is impossible as a result of the Aruban attitude. In the event that Aruba withdraws from the Antilles it will be financially impossi¬ ble for Curasao to bear the burden of the other four islands alone. 2 . Our party gives priority to the strengthening of our economic base over political indepen¬ dence. Furthermore it goes without saying that if Aruba whishes to step out of the Anti¬ llean Union it has to do this as soon as possi¬ ble, thus enabling Curasao to start functio¬ ning more effectively in adopting resolutions to broaden the social-economic base. Specific measures: the immediate creation of an entity to further broaden and go on guiding finan¬ cial, social-economic and social-cultural deve¬ lopment in accordance with the report drawn up by the 'Gemengde Commissie'. In this en¬ tity should as far as possible be t The Democratic Par¬ ty envisages that ulti¬ mately the present political relation with Holland will have to be substituted by a re¬ lationship based on international law, which implies an in¬ dependent Antilles consisting of six islands. If, however, one of the islands e.g. Aruba decides for a different kind of political status (i.e. outside the Anti¬ llean Union) the DP will respect this desire. The DP does not preclude the possibility of an independent Antilles consisting of five is¬ lands. Only in the last instance does the DP opt for an independent Curasao. The Party is of the opinion that the relations between the islands as they exist now within the Nether¬ lands Antilles should continue, but in such a way that each of the islands is granted the greatest possible independence. If Aruba de¬ cides to leave the union, the DP feels that Hol¬ land should take care of all the financial con¬ sequences for Curasao. 2 . The realization of an independent Antilles will have to be preceded by preparing the people mentally; objective information follo¬ wed by a referendum; measures to promote an as large as possible economic independen¬ ce and clear arrangements concerning t Evertsz Martina MAN aims at the creation of a new 'Antillen' on the ba¬ sis of voluntary par¬ ticipation of each is¬ land presently be¬ longing to the Ne¬ therlands Antillean Union. Sovereignty of the Antilles must be preceded by an agreement about the politi¬ cal structure of the islands in which mutual co-operation is arranged. The new structure of co-operation, in which a limited number of common interests will be taken care of cen¬ trally, must prove that it functions well in practice and therefore must be granted some time. 2 . In the coming period much attention will have to be devoted to promoting a greater sense of solidarity, self-reliance and regional awareness as well as willingness to build our own future and take responsibility. First the findings of the Committee of Seven have to be awaited and after having been informed pro¬ perly about these, the population will have to speak its mind by way of a referendum. Con¬ sidering the above it is evident that in this sta¬ ge it is impossible to indicate when and how the islands will be able to realize their self-de¬ termination. | 5 NATIONAL included representatives of all the social part¬ ners and disciplines on the various islands. 3. It should in the first place be mentioned that not only the developments in the East-West confrontation are at issue here, but also the North-South dialogue. It is important for us that Holland takes care of our foreign rela¬ tions, because this requires so much qualified personnel and money that we will not be able to bear the burden. The The Hague-Wil- lemstad co-operation should in this respect, however, become a two way traffic. Because of the Antilles’ acquaintance with the existing mentality in this region the Crown’s foreign policy with regard to the region and South America should clearly bear the Antillean stamp. With regard to the East-West confron¬ tation we are clearly in favour of the Wes¬ tern democracies. ■ external defence, foreign affairs, sea fron¬ tiers, debts to Holland, continued participa¬ tion in the EEC, continued aid from the EEC and from Holland, the financing of a social- economic strategy for the Antilles. This will take a long time. The DP cannot at this point fix a date on which all the conditions men¬ tioned will have been fulfilled. 3. The Antilles should have a say in the decision¬ making policy of the Crown regarding for¬ eign affairs. With regard to our region the Antilles should create their own policy. Con¬ cerning the confrontation now taking place in the South Atlantic the DP shares the views of the Caribbean Council of Churches that all war zones must immediately be declared a peace zone. Moreover the right of self-deter¬ mination should always be respected. ■ 3. At the moment the Caribbean is once again one of the focal points of the East-West per¬ spective. One of the great dangers of in¬ stitutionalisation of the cold war is that every internal change is interpreted as expansion of a super power and not as the reflection of the real problem i.e. the struggle against poverty, underdevelopment and injustice. Therefore this struggle is not placed in the real dimen¬ sion of the North-South problem. The bipolar character of the East-West vision hinders the process of democratization of the international process by the implication of a rigid hierarchy that prevents a real participa¬ tion for new states. In the Caribbean, which sets much store by ideological pluralism, this may cause a historical step backwards. As regards our foreign policy: MAN is of the opinion that the establishment of an auto¬ chtonous diplomacy, characterized by dynamism, initiative and effectivity has to be strived for. ■ Economy One of the most serious problems facing the country as a whole and several islands in particular is the high rate of unemployment. In order to keep the economy afloat and to create more labour opportunities local and foreign investment is urgently needed. 1. In what measure does your party welcome foreign investors and which specific facilities and guarantees are you prepared to offer them? 2. Are you of opinion that the so-called 'dismissal law' serves the interests of both employees and employers in a satisfactory way (which is often doubted by prospective investors) or do you favour a different ap¬ proach? 3. How do you propose to deal with the red tape and inefficiency which apparently often discourage inves¬ tors interested in the Antilles? The measures we en¬ visage are a. a shorter proce¬ dure to obtain a li¬ cence to establish an enterprise and speed up the pro¬ cedure to obtain other licences, b. review the fiscal laws in order to stimu¬ late enterprises in general with a special emphasis on the off-shore sector c. provide industry halls d. expand free zones e. provide investment deduction. 2. We are in favour of a new approach to the dismissal law in particular with regard to its implimentation. An inventory of what has been achieved on the labour market as well as with regard to management should be con¬ ducted. It is already clear that that the dismis¬ sal procedure should be shortened. t Evertsz As the Antilles are in a very vulnerable posi¬ tion it goes without saying that we will do our utmost to broaden the economic base and to carry out a policy aimed at the recovery of confidence in our economy. In order to do so we will: a. promote far-reaching decentralisation of the powers to the islands territories to en¬ sure political stability. b. continue with the reorganisation of the government services in consultation with the labour unions. c. carry out such a policy that there can be no doubt about legal security. d. avoid too much interference in the private sector. e. introduce on short term new stimulating measures (e.g. fiscal concessions) both for new and existing enterprises. a In view of the relatively high level of un¬ employment in our country and especially in Curasao during the last 20 years, we are convinced that the solution of this problem can only be found through a joint effort between all governments and all Ministries and Departments of the Netherlands Antilles together with private initiatives and investments from local and foreign sources. The contribution of foreign investors to his effort is not only welcome but very nec¬ essary both now and in the future. To this end the M.A.N.-party has already given full support to private local and for¬ eign initiatives while practising in the last government. } Martina LA BISTROELLE PARTY SERVICE TEAM A team of experts is at your service to take care of your party, BBQ, buffet, reception or your party at home.

Our party favours the establishment of one body per island territory to handle re¬ quests and issue permits. r fhis body must be enabled to establish direct contact with the de¬ partments and enterprises concerned and offer its advice directly to the responsible pol¬ icy-maker. ■ (contifiued page 8) 2. The D.P. is of the opinion that the dis¬ missal law should be upheld as it is now. Concerning the implimentation, however, we feel that a decision of the director of So¬ cial Affairs should be taken within six weeks after a request for dismissal has been submitted. Moreover, we have the impression that many employers have a wrong conception of this law due to insuf¬ ficient information about its nature. We are convinced that speeding up the process and informing employers better will take away much of the existing aversion, which in turn will help to improve our investment climate. 3. To improve on the so-called red-tape situation a body will have to be created in consultation with the island territories, which will have as its task to speed up the handling of requests by potential inves¬ tors. ■ Most important however is the fact that we fully realise that one of the most crucial elements affecting the investment climate is the assurance of a stable political climate. We will continue to create the necessary general climate that will not only attract in¬ vestors but also offer the assurance of being in a safe investment harbour. More specifically the M.A.N. will do its ut¬ most to — promote political stability — continue strengthening the antillean guil¬ der and promote a favourable develop¬ ment of the balance of payments — make the necessary changes and moder¬ nize our fiscal legislation — interest foreign investors in our economy — give the necessary protection to local products 2. The dismisal law was construed in order to serve both the interests of employers and em¬ ployees. Its functioning however was not optimal owing to a lack of clear instructions to the or¬ gans in charge of its application. The Martina Government has already taken the necessary steps to instruct the Director of the Ministry of Labour to speed up the deci¬ sion making by this officer. This being the main objection heard against this law we hope that its application will now cause less reason for dissatisfaction. We will, however, continue monitoring this develop¬ ment and make any adaptations that may be necessary in the future. ■ 7 NATIONAL The Next Generation The younger generations constitute more than 50% of our population. For many young people the chances to find suitable employment look dim. Reports by government and private institutions speak of a resulting process of demoralisation and a frighte¬ ning loss of values among people, in particular the young. It is generally agreed that this negative process can only be stopped and reversed by a thorough overhaul of the educational process. 1. How does your party see the role of government and of private initiative in this respect? Please indicate scope and limits in particular of the government’s role both with regard to education and general remoti¬ vation. 2. It is often maintained that we should arrive at an 'indigeneous' educational system. If you agree, what do you specifically mean by 'indigeneous' in this context? 3. What measures has your party in mind to tackle the problem of youth unemployment and the resulting process of demoralisation? Vocational training must be expanded to more disciplines. In addition several re¬ education projects must be initiated ba¬ sed on the existing de¬ mand in the labour market. A program¬ me for 'on the job training' in industry subsidized by the government must be started. In this the government has a correcting and implimen- ting task and has to act as stimulator to private initiative. Education should remain free for all groups in the community and should be of constant concern to the government. The lat¬ ter should further support plans of the Coun¬ cil of Churches to promote a civics sense via the courses in social sciences. 2. The NVP considers education as one of the most important welfare provisions and as one of the means to eliminate social, cultural and economic under-development. We are of the opinion that education is both a means and an aim to increase economic self-reliance of the individual without detracting from the general Christian values of the community. Our educational system should prepare the population for independence. It must also be a reflection of our own values. We belief that freedom of education should be maintained unabridged. Every individual should be given the opportunity to receive the education which corresponds with his abilities and reli¬ gious convictions. He should be allowed a responsible measure of influence on the system. We favour a sys¬ tem which will produce responsible, critical and creative citizens. We also hold that voca¬ tional training should be geared better to the needs of industry. 3. The Antillean Development Brigade pro¬ ject should be executed immediately. Adult education should be broadened in scope in order to enable many more young persons t Article 140 of the “Staatsregeling van de Nederlandse Anti- lien” states that edu¬ cation should be a subject of constant care of the govern¬ ment. It is the task of the government to rule, regulate and di¬ rect education in this country. Whenever there is a consensus that our edu¬ cational system needs a thorough overhau¬ ling, the government should investigate and compare, and offer alternatives and solu¬ tions. Private initiative in our educational system is recognized and protected by laws in the above mentioned “Staatsregeling”. However, priva¬ te initiative cannot occupy an autonomous po¬ sition in our educational system. It should fol¬ low always the direction which is decided by the government and impliment its decisions loyally. Nevertheless, private initiative should always function as a counterpart to the government in the role of initiator of new ideas and inter¬ cede on behalf of minorities it sometimes re¬ presents. 2. Indigeneous in this context means that our educational system should be based on the fulfillment of the needs and necessities of our specific Curagaoan community. Before one is able to fulfill those needs, one should know what those needs are in reality. Those needs should not be restricted only as to, for instance, which language the lessons should be taught in, but the whole of the com¬ plexity of our community should be investiga¬ ted and studied. It would then be possible to have an idea as to what form an “indigeneous” system should have. 3 The needs of our community should be known, and hence the education and in- } The interaction be¬ tween government and private initiati¬ ve should be charac¬ terized by participa¬ tion of organized private initiative in preparing and exe¬ cuting government policies. This will broaden the democratic dimension of our so¬ ciety. With regard to general remotivation our par¬ ty strongly believes that the actions of govern¬ ment should promote respect, discipline and the upholding of desired norms and values. The behaviour of the elected both in his per¬ sonal and political life is of great influence on the belief of the electorate in our democratic values and on its willingness to co-operate to¬ wards upholding these. With respect to education the authorities should honour and guarantee the right to in¬ formation by creating and maintaining condi¬ tions serving this principle. The relation between government and priva¬ te initiative is in our community regulated by the basic rights of freedom of expression and freedom of education as laid down in the con¬ stitution. Both freedoms imply the rejection of any kind of discrimination. 2. The present educational system contribu¬ tes both from an individual-psychological and a social point of view in no small measure to the process of demoralisation in our society. The almost complete want of appreciation of our own language and culture leads to estran¬ gement of the individual from his own socio¬ cultural environment. Thus irreparable da¬ mage is done to the self-confidence of a large part of the younger generations. The much needed indigeneous educational system should take as its starting point the child as it is with its own socio-cultural back¬ ground. This implies the use of the t Evertsz NATIONAL to learn a profession. We are against an over¬ accentuation of the intellectual aspect. A proper balance with other aspects of the human personality should be aimed at. ■ struction should be given to fulfill those needs. Professions, for which there is no em¬ ployment, should not be taught in our techni¬ cal schools. On the other hand, skills which can guarantee an income, whether as a selfsupporting citi¬ zen or as an employee, should be taught. Much more attention should be given to “on the job training” projects, as a means to in¬ troduce unexperienced youngsters in an em¬ ployee- situation, as well as to upgrade unskil¬ led and half-skilled personnel. The A.O.B. project should be initiated as a means to moti¬ vate, train and teach self-discipline to young¬ sters. To employ trained people, jobs must be created however. Incentives should be accorded therefore to those that wish to bring industries on the is¬ land; tourism should be promoted in all ways possible. As a red line through all these and other activities should run a motivation pro¬ cess which is the most important part of the business of getting a job and keeping it. Self reliance should be propagated, pride in one’s honest work, professionalism, citizenship, productivity, and the feeling that one is part of the whole. ■ child’s mother tongue in education besides teaching other world languages to keep an opening to the world at large. It also implies that knowledge and love for our own cultural heritage should be promoted. 3. Besides the general measures demanded by the unemployment problem we envisage a youth-labour project for which the island au¬ thorities should be responsible. The national government could provide the necessary funds for the project, which might promote the beautifying of landscape, improving liv¬ ing conditions and creating recreational facil¬ ities. Our unemployment problem is characterized by both a surplus and a shortage of labour. Special measures are needed to alleviate the shortage of trained executives. These could be: — to try and reverse the trend to leave school too early. — to provide scholarships both for employed and unemployed young people. — to create possibilities of schooling, addi¬ tional training and re-education. Finally long term planning e.g. family plan¬ ning should be developed in order to di¬ minish the labour supply. ■ STANDARD WITH: • newly designed lightweight 800 cc engine • radial tires # radio • front wheel drive • power assisted disc brakes • tinted windows all-around SPECIAL INTRODUCTORY Price fI. 8.950,— With airco fl. 9.950,— DonAUTO ROODEWEG 109 TEL 24511 9 ABN Bank the largest international bank of holland at curapao n„a.

Preceded by years of debate, scores of position pa¬ pers and a fair number of high level meetings between Holland and the Antilles, all of which yielded little tangible result, the meeting could hardly be expected to rouse much interest. In particular as most of the de¬ liberations went on behind closed doors and the committee’s work is of a preliminary nature anyhow. But now that more details of the four day long discussions have leaked their way out, it does not seem an oversta¬ tement to suggest that the gathering in cold and windy The Hague may well prove to have been of a decisive nature. So much seems clear: Aruba is going to have its desired status aparte' soon. Only a serious financial crisis or regional ramifications of the Falkland crisis could change the envisaged re-alignment of constitu¬ tional ties between the islands and with Holland. But even though such developments may very well occur, it is clear that the present constitution linking the Antilles and Holland as two partners in one Kingdom has run its course. Fresh Start When the four Antillean and three Dutch members of the Committee sat down last April to continue their discussions — a first meeting took place last February in Cura¬ sao — the agenda at least was clear. Holland’s proposal at the earlier session to broaden the committee’s charge i.e. to study besides the fea¬ sibility of Aruban independence and the consequences thereof for the other islands also possible con¬ stitutional options for the latter, had in the meantime been turned down by the Crown after a strong protest by the delegates from Bo¬ naire, Curasao and the Windward Islands. It now seems plausible to suspect that the Dutch put forward their proposal hoping to use Aru¬ ba’s desire for partial independen¬ ce as a leverage to force their own ideas on all the six islands. The Dutch would like the six to stay to¬ gether be it in a less centralized set¬ up than the present one. Thus they would ward off the possibility of being saddled with one or more of the islands indefinitely. Their ploy having failed, they now appeared eager to have done with the January discussions and in¬ stead insisted that the Committee should proceed from a paper which in the meantime had been drawn up by Aruba. The meeting concurred. Association The most significant part of the Aruban paper concerned the pro¬ posal to grant the second largest is¬ land as regards population the sta¬ tus of association with the Nether¬ lands. To arrive at this end, the Arubans suggested, a period of pre-association should precede during which the necessary pro¬ cess of decentralizing government services could take place. It should be noted that such a period would also allow Aruba’s leading party (MEP) to continue creating situa¬ tions of conflict, a method by which it has managed in the past to stay in power. This pre-association phase would be ended with the enactment of two legal acts effec¬ ted almost simultaneously: imme¬ diately after receiving its indepen¬ dence Aruba would relinquish cer¬ tain prerogatives like external de¬ fence and foreign affairs. One implication, not much to the liking of the Dutch, is that full in¬ dependence would then become a matter of the distant future. Time table The Dutch had prepared themsel¬ ves thouroughly. During the deli¬ berations they produced a list of the problems which will arise if 'as¬ sociation' is decided upon. They also put on the table an outline of the constitutional changes requi¬ red to grant Aruba 'status aparte'. It soon became clear that Holland was ready to move in the latter di¬ rection.

The main difference between the two options is that status aparte does allow for the definite fixing of a date on which full independence will have to come about. In accordance the chairman of the Committee, Mr. Barend Biesheuvel, a former Dutch pri¬ me-minister, spoke of a six year limit. One high placed official, however, conceded that this might be extended to ten years. The Dutch also suggested that decentralization of government should be completed within six months in order to preclude any constitutional ambiguity during the transition period. Obstacle If all this seemed to go unexpec¬ tedly smooth the Dutch (and non-Aruban) members of the Committee, however, still had a card up their sleeves. Any chan¬ ge in the constitutional ties, they insisted, can only be arrived at if all parties concerned agree to a clearly defined measure of sub¬ stantial and lasting cooperation. This pre-condition may well pro¬ ve to be a serious obstacle du¬ ring future negotiations. The Arubans have hitherto defined future cooperation with the other five islands in less than mi¬ nimal terms. In essence they only want collaboration in those fields where they suspect that Aruba might loose by not doing so. Apart from sharing uniform and concordant legislation they do not want to partake in any kind of structural cooperation. At the next meeting of the Com¬ mittee, which is expected to be held soon after the summer, the other members will forward their definition of 'substantial and lasting cooperation'. There is no doubt that Aruba will then come under heavy pressure. The other Antillean members are not prepared to go along unless a satisfactory measure of coopera¬ tion is agreed upon and guaran¬ teed. Holland has already stipulated that this should at least be of the nature of that which exists among the members of the Eu¬ ropean Community. Geopolitics In the meantime a number of experts have been invited by the committee to draw up papers outlining the administrative, fi¬ nancial and geo-political implica¬ tions of the intended re-align¬ ment of constitutional ties. With regard to the last issue the Falk¬ land crisis will certainly not fail to have its influence. Nearby Ve¬ nezuela, which sided whole-hear¬ tedly with Argentina, has during the past two months made it qui¬ te clear that it considers the ABC islands to be very much within its sphere of influence. Developments unwelcome to Ca¬ racas will not be tolerated. A recent backing down by Was¬ hington and The Hague with re¬ gard to naval exercises near Aruba after a protest by Vene¬ zuela, indicates that the vested interest of the latter country in the Antillean leewards is being recognized if not officially then in the international corridors of power. A development which should make Antillean politicians extremely prudent with regard to unraveling the existing natio¬ nal fabric. They will at least have to exert from Holland the assu¬ rance that it will continue to take charge of external defence. That in turn provides The Hague with a strong edge in the next rounds of negotiations. Debacle Disquieting is the reported ex¬ pectation of Dutch politicians that the Antilles are heading for a financial debacle. The soaring costs of a much too large admin¬ istrative body and the threate¬ ning loss of substantial income caused by America’s intransigent attitude towards the offshore ac¬ tivities based in the Antilles, have given rise to this gloomy prediction. Decentralisation of government will only add to that unbearable burden. Even more worrisome is the in¬ formation from usually reliable sources that Holland will not lift a finger to help Willemstad out of its expected predicament. Al¬ though there is some fear that such a development might lead to social unrest on Curasao, which already faces a serious un¬ employment problem, the advan¬ tage of a further edge in the ne¬ gotiations is said to be preferred. But whether this would re-open the possibility of keeping all six islands together seems doubtful. Crucial Aruba will certainly not be wil¬ ling to make an about-face even if this implies the unavoidability of full scale independence. The Windward Islands have already let it be known that they will opt for direct ties with Holland, if the present constellation collap¬ ses. Holland has indicated its willingness to go along. Ironical¬ ly such a turn of events would then mean that Curasao and Bo¬ naire are going to get what Aru¬ ba has been demanding for years: indefinite constitutional ties with Holland. Although the Committee of Se¬ ven has been set up to advise the respective governments of Holland and the Antilles with a view to the next Round Table Conference, it may be concluded that its findings have already brought the constitutional delibe¬ rations to a crucial stage. ■ 13 I * J ★ Optics ★ Contact lenses ★ Cameras FOR QUALITY AND SERVICE ODUBER & KAN OPTICIANS OPTICS-CONTACTLENSES-CAMERAS AVIS We try harder.

Alice van Ro- mondt, the dynamic director of Aruba’s Public Library, searches for words to explain the concept behind the new building she and her staff are about to move into. “The architect’s guiding princi¬ ple”, she tells, “has been playing with books . And the result is more than a building, but rather a cen¬ tre of communication. The dis¬ tance between the old library downtown and the new building is only five minutes by car but otherwise they are worlds apart. History The need for new premises has been evident for some time and gives an indication of the hunger for knowledge of Aruba’s people. Thirty-one years ago the Public Library started with 348 mem¬ bers and 3238 books. Today 11,694 Arubans are registered, which is almost 20% of the entire population! The number of books has surpassed the 100,000. and even more interesting: the number of young readers has in that period of 31 years gone up from 73 to 6933. As early as 1974 it was realized that the library was outgrowing its present premises. Never built to house a library to begin with and no larger than 850 square metres, it had obviously served its purpose. In spite of the pressing need to move to larger and more suitable offices, it took almost ten years to get the project realized. Multi-purpose The new 3,8 million dollar build¬ ing is designed to serve the pu¬ blic’s hunger for information in a wide variety. Not only is there ample room to study the titles of the shelved books at one’s leasu- re and to sit down and read un¬ disturbed, a number of new de¬ partments cater to related needs as well. An audio-visual section sets books on video cassette or sound track for the handicapped. The news department offers be¬ sides the customary selection of daily newspapers and magazines, also the possibility of reviewing TV-newscasts from Caracas Tele¬ vision and Tele-Aruba. Tapes of news-broadcasts by the Voice of America, Radio Caracas, Curom and Voz di Aruba will also be avail¬ able. The programmes are rene¬ wed weekly. The so-called 'Antil- len-Room' contains a permanent and up to date display of Antillean publications. Antillean-made mo¬ vies are shown on request. One of the most fascinating fea¬ tures of the new library is the story-tower. Ascending winding stairs one enters a futuristically designed room, in which daily a children story hour is held. Schools can use the hide-away in the mornings for special classes, using materials provided by the library. A musical corner invites the pu¬ blic to listen in to recordings of Antillean music both old and modern. Space too is reserved for exhibitions and cultural acti¬ vities. A bookbinders' shop and small printery are also included in the project which was paid for by Holland (75%) and the Aru¬ ban Government (25%). Says Mrs. van Romondt: “this library is meant not only to serve the needs of the individual reader but also to foster a sense of com¬ munity”. ■ UNITED FIDELITY TRUST OF ARUBA N.V. as agent for Playa Linda Development Co.

Harvest festival more than folklore by Frans Booi The dancers move shoulder to shoulder holding each other by the waist, row after row forming a massive square much like the Roman armies used to march. But no thought of war lies be¬ hind Simadan, Bonaire’s colour¬ ful harvest festival. Rather the pride of achievement and the joy of having made it together. Simadan re¬ calls a unique period of the island’s history and poses a question the younger genera- ^4 tion might do well to heed. Unity During the weeks of preparation preced¬ ing the festival older people can still be overheard asking the curious question 'simadan a mara?', meaning 'has unity been arrived at' or more precisely 'is ev¬ erybody ready to join hands'?' The question points back to the days when the Bonaireans would collectively harvest their small plots of land. The following festivities thus be¬ came a symbol of unity. Dancing closely together in one square block the same thought was and is visually expressed. And the same applies to the songs that form an integral part of the har¬ vest festival. They are composed in a question and answer style, and use a unique and rare rythm. Of the several authentic Simadan melodies the 'Mailo' or 'Remailo' is the most well-known and must be labelled a Simadan classic. The same goes back to the days when Bonaire’s eco¬ nomy was still by and large self sufficient and thus implies a call to the pride of self-reliance. Remailo Early last century the Antilles had ceased to be of much \\ ./, % 3 i4 H : | wm% & ' : economic use to their colonial masters, the Dutch. As a conse¬ quence Bonaire was very much left to its own. A situation which allowed many of the ex-slaves, most of whom had belonged to the Crown (as did most of the land) to fence off for themselves small plots using cacti after the custom introduced by the Spanish in the 16th century. The colonial administration did not object and after some years even suggested to survey and register the so-called “conucu’s”. This was officially done during the En¬ glish period (1807-1816) along the lines of a system that the British also used in Africa. Al¬ locating property by the square mile the system was called the 'mailo-system'. In the Simadan the people would chant 'We want our own plot of land. Not only for the King we wish to work'. Thus the Mailo became the most popular of simadan songs. Co-operation It is interesting to note that the development described above implied a smooth transition from an economy based on slavery to a society of small land owners years before slavery was offi¬ cially abolished. The success of this pro¬ cess must be largely as¬ cribed to the willingness of the former slaves to co-operate in tilling the land and harvesting the crop. Sharing equip¬ ment and helping each other out, the celebra¬ tion of the harvest be¬ came a truly communal happening. No wonder the question 'simadan a mara?' was raised. For only if there was a true spirit of co-op¬ eration during harvest time could there be a real simadan. Neglect Much has changed since those days when Bonaire was known as the food-supplier of the Antilles. With the arrival of the (oil) in¬ dustry many of the men went away to work in Curasao and Aruba. Others accepted jobs with the government, which is now the largest employer on the is¬ land. It could be argued that the old days of Crown slavery have returned in a modern disguise. So much is true at least: the con- uco’s lie untended, the land | 17 BONAIRE overgrown with weeds and the cacti hedges in disarray. Super¬ markets offer the customer vegeta¬ bles and meat imported from else¬ where. The goat staple, once the major provider of meat, is slowly diminishing and by lack of good stock losing quality. The small farmer and cattle breeder are rap¬ idly becoming a rarity on the is¬ land, which once prided itself in being self-sufficient by hard and honest work. The Simadan reminds us who enjoy its dances and songs as unique folklore of those days. It calls to memory the virtues of co¬ operation and loving-care for the land we inherited. There is a sad discrepancy between the desert like look of Bonaire’s countryside and the happy dancing and sing¬ ing still heard every year at harvest time. Simadan, for sure, is more than folklore! a Looking for a European men’s shopT n i if wimseit&wiinseit other branches: society boutique, windstraat 19, Curasao young man shop, kerkstraat 5, curapao and 5 fashion centers in holland FOR ALL YOUR BUS/NESS- AND VACATION TRIPS CONTACT YOUR FRIENDLY TRAVEL AGENT: WzaribeTours MiMtfft P.O.

Overstaffed, badly ad¬ ministrated and technically in de¬ cline Curasao’s telephone com¬ pany found itself under heavy fire from an exasperated public. Remotivation programmes, tech¬ nical training courses, a thourough organizational overhaul and the start of a ten year renewal plan, have caused a remarkable tur¬ naround. Coupled to a customer oriented approach the effort to upgrade services is clearly paying off. Criticism may not yet have turned into praise, it certainly has diminished and lost its sarcastic edge. The secret behind this develop¬ ment: the government run service was turned into a limited liability company. Heritage The reason why in 1979 the tele¬ phone service was given the struc¬ ture of a company operating on the principle of profit making, was twofold. The costs of much needed renewal of existing equipment and no less needed extension of the network was estimated at Na/. 100. million. Credit, it was correctly assumed, would be much easier forthcoming, if the service was run in a businesslike manner. This could only be achieved, it was again correctly assumed, if the management would be enabled to pursue its policies unhampered by political meddling. The changeover, however, came extremely abrupt. Without any proper preparation the manage¬ ment saw itself confronted with a staggering number of problems. The newly formed company not only inherited 500 largely unmoti¬ vated and unskilled employees, many of them having been ap¬ pointed on the basis of political pa¬ tronage, but also a technical infra¬ structure rapidly becoming obso¬ lete. All at once departments of fi¬ nance, administration and person¬ nel had to be set up, matters that up to now had been taken care of to put it euphemistically by the re¬ spective governmental depart¬ ments. The financial administration, for example, appeared to be in a downright shambles. At least Manager Angel Kookjlanked by employees Na/. 8 million had not been col¬ lected from subscribers. The mail¬ ing of invoices was far behind schedule, creating a serious cash¬ flow problem. On top of all this the company was faced with a rapidly growing demand for connections and with developments in the tech¬ nical field requiring know-how not available. Motivation “From the very start we had to im¬ plement two projects at the same time”, tells Mr. Angel Kook (48), the company’s general manager. “First of all there was the task of converting the unproductive ser¬ vice into an efficiently operating company. And secondly we had to start up a ten year project aimed at updating our technical infra-struc¬ ture and meeting the projected de¬ mand for connections.” An immediate personnel-stop was announced. The company was clearly overstaffed. A situation caused by the malpractice of show¬ ering jobs on sympathizers by the the political bosses. As a con¬ sequence many employees were t 19 CURAQAO not suited for the jobs they were holding. A most undesirable situa¬ tion for all parties concerned. As the company had been obliged to take over all personnel, dismis¬ sal was out of the question. This left no other option than to em¬ bark on a programme of remotiva¬ tion and training. It should be noted, however, that by far the majority of the employees re¬ mained officially in government service. Only a handful of the workers are fully employed by the company. This has created a dualism which for obvious reasons is not exactly conducive to the up¬ grading of efficiency. Mr. Kook is of the opinion that transforming services like his into limited liability companies is most advisable, but should never be done halfhear¬ tedly. He feels it ought to be possi¬ ble to offer employees the neces¬ sary guarantees with regard to ac¬ quired social rights like pension ar¬ rangements, thus making it accept¬ able for all to join the new com¬ pany from the very beginning. But in spite of the unsatisfactory situa¬ tion at the moment, Mr. Kook is happy to testify to a marked change in attitude amongst his em¬ ployees. “People are definitely much more motivated than three years ago”, Kook says. Customer oriented The manager’s statement is backed up by the employees themselves. Says Richard de Caster (31) who has been with the telephone ser¬ vice 8 years: much has changed during the past three years. Now I know what I’m doing and what the purpose is of my work”. His obvi¬ ous pleasure with the job he is doing and pride in his achieve¬ ments — de Caster took AR on a trip pointing out the three cabinets he built last year allowing for 1400 new connections — is the result of a conscious effort on the manage¬ ment’s part to improve internal communication. Explains Miss C. H. Giskus in charge of motiva¬ tion programmes “our company is a very technical undertaking. People have to be updated on de¬ velopments all the time. But they also have to work together and un¬ derstand why certain policies are being pursued”. Last year three seminars were held to help depart¬ ment heads deal better with the human factor involved. Organiza¬ tion experts (van Dien en Co., ac¬ countants) were invited in to deter¬ mine which aspects needed atten¬ tion. Much emphasis was put on stimulating a customer-oriented attitude. Reactions of participants to the seminars were quite positive. An immediate result has been the establishment of an information service which also handles com¬ plaints. But maybe even more im¬ portant all employees are made aware of the importance of good public relations. t For the Netherlands Antilles as International Centre for Industrial Trade and Banking is the existence of an independent and completely self-supported Data Pro¬ cessing Service Centre of essential importance. CICS (say “cicks”), only two years in the run, yet with an established reputation, acquired through her professional ap¬ proach, the dedication of well-trained and graduated personnel, and her conception of “high degree of service-rendering”, offers existing companies and new investors a complete service package: ACTIVITIES: * Consultancy * System Development * Data-Processing Services, batch, remote batch, on-line * Facilities Management * Education and Training For free booklet with detailed information, write or call: CAPACITIES: * A total of 18 experienced designers and programmers (still growing fast) * Hardware: IBM 4331, L02 with 4 Mega¬ bytes mainstorage (largest on Curasao) and 1713 Megabytes on-line storage.

A new computer system was adopted and by the end of 1981 the backlog of invoices had been eliminated. Moreover 4 1/2 million of the earlier mentioned 8 had by then been recovered. Expec¬ tations are that the financial ad¬ ministration will be on par by the middle of this year. Says Mr. Kook: experience shows that people are quite willing to pay on time as long as the invoices are sent regularly on time as well”. The only client the com¬ pany is having trouble with in this respect is the government. The improved financial situation has helped the company to get its proposed ten year project off the ground. Aiming at an almost 100% increase of connections by 1990 (from the present 24000 to 47000) the projected plan hopes to meet the increasing demand and renovate the existing net¬ work at the same time. The total costs are estimated, as mentioned before, at Na/. 100 million. The Dutch government agreed to lend the company 20 million on condition that its rates would allow for a profit margin. With an additional cred¬ it of 40 million provided by Erikson and the Dutch Cable In- dustries(NKF), the company still has to come up with 40 million out of its own means. But now that the financial department has come to grips with the situa¬ tion, the company is more op¬ timistic. In particular as a sub¬ stantial increase of income may be expected during the coming four years, when a great number of new subscribers will be served. Chief Outside Plan, mr. J. G. Constancia, told AR that during the present year 3000 new connections will be effected. Presently his department of 75 employees is ahead of schedule with regard to the laying of ca¬ bles. Included in the project is the building of three new telephone exchanges serving the busiest centres of town. These ex¬ changes will provide customers with the most advanced facilities, like hot-lines and wake-me-up services. Training A third front on which a tur¬ naround has been achieved con¬ cerns the technical training of personnel. Mr. F. C. van Pelt, in charge of the training depart¬ ment, points out that the present programme’s history goes back beyond the structural change of 1979. Already in 1973 when more sophisticated equipment was acquired, the need for a training programme was recog¬ nized. With the help of the United Nations Development Programmed(UNDP) and the Inter Telecom Union(ITU) a modest training centre was built and two foreign experts drew up a curriculum. Between 1978 and 1980 it became clear that the ac¬ celerating development of tech¬ Grand Marnier THE KING OF AFTER DINNER DRINKS Distributor: Nico Cornelisse Import Tel. 612304/5 - Curasao, N.A. nology demanded a fresh ap¬ proach. A survey conducted in 1980 moreover revealed that 20% of the company’s employees had to be labelled unstilled. A sorry result of the earlier quoted custom of political patronage. Guarantee Even more so because most of those workers belong to the yuonger age-groups. Mr. van Pelt last year devised a two year programme to impart the neces¬ sary know-how. Accomodations, however, are so limited that no more than 10 employees can enjoy the benefit of the course every two years. Says van Pelt “this process ought to be speeded up. We simply need more teaching facilities”. With a view to the projected de¬ velopments van Pelt is no doubt right. Next year electronically operated telephone exchanges will be introduced. Pulse-code¬ modulation (PCM) will be used soon to make better use of trans¬ mission channels. A method that will allow 30 conversations to be held stimultaneously on one cable! Obviously the introduction of such sophisticated techniques makes the upgrading of person¬ nel and absolute must. In order to provide such necessary train¬ ing, cooperation has been estab¬ lished with technical schools and the university. Several of the company’s engineers have been sent abroad to get additional training. Admits van Pelt “I do see positive changes but for me they are coming on too slow”. A healthy impatience which is shared by the management. Mr. Angel Kook told AR that the process of change went much slower than expected. But the very fact that those in charge of the company would like to move faster in order to serve the pub¬ lic better, seems the best guaran¬ tee that the described tur¬ naround is only the beginning of a dynamic development. ■ 21 TIME-SHARING AT CORAL CLIFF RESORT & BEACH CLUB IS YOUR PASSPORT TO HOLIDAYS WORLD-WIDE For only $ 4800,00 you can visit exotic RESORTS AROUND THE WORLD OVER THE NEXT 25 years.

But to the local St. Maartener the bad roads unlined by pavements, the unhindered wande¬ ring around of cattle, the obvious lack of town planning and primitive utili¬ ties have no such romantic overtones. On the contrary the disparity between the best of services offered to the tou¬ rist and the chaotic reality of every day St. Maarten are causing a mood of sul¬ ky dissatisfaction. For although most St. Maarteners have a sincere appre¬ ciation for the fact that their govern¬ ment has managed to put the island in a relatively short time as a number one resort on the tourist map, they are in¬ creasingly aware of the (inevitable) backlog in community services. An awareness that has led a number of highly motivated groups all over the island to organize themselves into community councils with the purpose of giving the government a hand in making the island more livable for its own people. An initiative, however, that is viewed with much suspicion by the politicians, as they fear that the councils may well turn into pressure groups threatening their authority. Ojectives The five community councils now in existence on the island were all esta¬ blished in the late 70-ties and early 80- ties. Mrs. O. Bryson-Pantophlet of St. Peters-Marigot Hill-Reward recounts how she and several neighbours beca¬ me very much concerned about the lack of recreation possibilities for young people and the piling up of garbage in their district. “We got toge¬ ther to have more input. We felt that there was a need and noboddy was doing anything about it”. In order to have that input she and her friends decided to give their initia¬ tive legal status by establishing a foun¬ dation. The articles define the objecti¬ ve as “to support and preserve the es¬ thetic and natural beauty ... to orga¬ nize social, cultural and educational functions ... to create facilities and organize events . . . promoting a better and harmonious understanding amongst the people and to safeguard and promote a proper and organized growth of the district”. The councils' activities hitherto have concerned themselves with cleaning up the res¬ pective districts, creating play-ground and sports facilities for young people and running a most popular radio programme aimed at awareness build¬ ing. In their battle against littering they received help from the St. Maar¬ ten Hotel Association. A battle which was waged in a playful manner by or¬ ganizing a 'decorating garbage drum contest'. Politics Their genuine concern about a num¬ ber of social ills prompted the councils to approach the island government. Raising issues like bad roads, increased bus fares, the uneven distribution of public telephones, too little illumina¬ tion of the streets at night and the ap¬ parently sloppy collection of garbage, they came close to playing politics. In particular when they blocked a road, thus preventing the dumping of gar¬ bage close to a living area. Within the small island community almost every¬ thing is tinged with politics, but decla¬ res Mr. C. Hodge, a prominent council member, 'our organizations are defini¬ tely non political'. He adds, that the sole intention of the council’s work is to render a positive contribution to the wellfare of the island. He and his col¬ leagues hope that this will be apprecia¬ ted by the body politic, which until now has not reacted with much enthu¬ siasm, probably because they consider the councils as highly critical of their administration. Monuments Rating high on the list of all five coun¬ cils is the concern for St. Maarten’s much neglected historical monuments. News that the ruins of Fort Amster¬ dam might soon fall prey to the conti¬ nuing expansion of hotel construction led to strong protest. The Fort, which was originally built by the Spanish in 1632 and after destruction rebuilt in 1737, is one of the few historical mo¬ numents on the island. Restoration of the beautifully situated fortress would certainly enhance St. Maarten’s touris¬ tic attraction. The councils appealed to Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and sollicited the help of authorities like Prof. Temminck Groll and mr. M. P. Sypkens-Smit, both of whom have stu¬ died the historical heritage of the Antilles. The latter discovered that lar¬ ge sections of the older Spanish Fort are still buried beneath the shrub on the site, which was sold by the govern¬ ment to hotel entrepeneurs.

Box 288 - Phone 4230/4237 Fort Amsterdam 23 SPECIAL FEATURE On the occasion of the Bicentennial An Interview Fellow Americans after meeting Alta Fowler, the US Consul-General in Curasao, invariably comment 'isn’t she some gal!' Antilleans feel no dif¬ ferent. Or maybe they do. For those who have come to know hard-driving and ever cheerful Alta have taken more than a liking to her. She cer¬ tainly is the most active US consul in years, taking a genuine interest in the Antillean people. Sitting down in her tastefully decorated living room over huge high-balls miss Fowler shared with AR her views on Anti¬ llean-American relations. Some ex¬ cerpts of that conversation recently held are printed underneath. On the bicentennial celebration of uninterrupted diplomatic and trade relations between the Netherlands and the USA and where the Antilles fit in: from St. Eustatius, which showed its support of the American revolu¬ tion by saluting the naval vessel 'Andrea Doria' in 1776. Then of course there has been consular representation from 1793 on¬ wards. In fact the consulate here opened one month or so ahead of the one in Amsterdam! And at the turn of the century they began sending down career men. It has been so ever since. Diplomatic relations went via Holland, yes. But commercial re¬ lations across the Caribbean. There has always been very close contact between the two coun¬ tries. At the moment, I would say, that official relations are pretty good. And the majority of the people are very open to Americans. There is no march¬ ing against the USA on these is¬ lands! On the tax treaty which the American Government whishes to amend in a way most un¬ favourable to the Antilles: I am doing my best. I keep telling them: you have friends there. They are democratic islands, a democratic country. That is the outstanding thing about it. But people here are amongst the wealthiest in the Caribbean. The prevailing attitude in Washington is: this is still part of Holland. They consider the Antilles Hol¬ land’s baby. But it should be realized that independence is coming. I have told Washington: you can’t wait for that. We can’t let them lose the momentum cut¬ ting off this most important source of income. And they are aware of this in Washington. That the islands have been in¬ cluded in the Caribbean Basin Initiative is definitely a step for¬ wards. But beyond that more ur¬ gent matters apparently block out the importance of the issue at stake. In my opinion the only way to win the battle is via State. On democracy which she calls the outstanding thing about the Antilles: The Antillean people vote. They don’t shoot each other. There is no police state. Like in the past months when it did not seem possible to form a majority government the people said 'let’s go back to the ballot box'. In a sense this nation is more democratic than the USA. It is a small country with many political parties. Of course that makes it difficult to govern, but percen¬ tage wise it keeps more people involved. And in connection with your earlier question about the tax treaty: Washington does put a lot of value on that. On the East-West confrontation: there is a realization of the im¬ portance of these islands astride the sea lanes. In particular our navy is very well aware of the strategic position of the Antillean islands. An important part of our oil supply goes via this area. This is not only true of the ABC is¬ lands but also of the Windwards, which, are very close to the routes to and from the Panama canal. 24 SPECIAL FEATURE On the narcotics connection: un- fortunetly this is very important. Not only for the USA. I have con¬ tinuously warned that a transit country always becomes a user country. Look at what happened in Holland. First it was only a connec¬ tion. Now they have a real prob¬ lem. I am very happy with the cooperation we are getting from the officials here. It really is tre¬ mendous. I would rate it at 99%. cJ~j PJzeatu Of cdfmitg and PommEZCE (j£toj££n PJtiEiz cdfigti igfztinEfiEi t(z£ <Stat£i - P^EnEZat of ttiE dtnitsdOVzttzzztandi and t(x£ Oinited P>tat£i of cdfmEzica, to vjibOVzixj - <0~famj2i(zizE,Oliafiac(zuiEtti, Op/zopE Oitand, and dPzovidzncz PP tantationi, PonnEcticutt, OVevj - Pjozt, <0 \\[evj - ^EZiEg, PPEnigtoania, ddzCaujazz, Ol^agtand, Q/izginia, OVoztfz - Pazotina, <Pout(z - Pazotina and ^Eozgia. On the question whether the Anti¬ lles should take a larger share in the shaping of foreign policy now taken care of by the Kingdom i.c. the Netherlands: Yes that is obvi¬ ous. Everything is foreign affairs here. Ipso facto everybody is invol¬ ved. But this is no easy matter. First of all there should be more train¬ ing in foreign affairs for young people. If you see how it works you see how policy is created. And sec¬ ondly you have to make your mid¬ dle to senior civil servants realize that everyting they touch is in fact foreign affairs. On the festivities: all six islands will receive a selection of books, Americana and reference, for their libraries. I will give small re¬ ceptions at the time of delivery to each island, sometime during the year. The director Foreign Service of the Latin American section, David Scott Palmer, will come down to speak on American poli¬ cies in the Caribbean/Central American region. During the sum¬ mer a number of US naval vessels will visit the Antilles, their crews taking part in special sports events. We hope to have Brenda Rocker- Smith, a promising young sop¬ rano, with us in September for a commemorative concert. And all this is of course on top of what the Central and Island Governments are planning, which I must say is quite impressive. ■ PJtzEiz c0figtz<O\\/[igtztin£fi£i ttzE P*tat£i ^EYZEZat of ttzE dLnitsddPEttzEZ- tandi, and ttzE ddnited - ^PtatEi of cdfmzzica, to vjitOVzvj - cdfumjiitzizE, Ol^afiacfzuiEtti, OptopE Oitand and PPzouincEPPtantationi, PonnEcticutt, OVeoj - dJozH,OVsoj - fffzzizij, PPEnigtuania, PpEtauiazE,<Ol/[azgtand, P/iz- ginia, OVozttz - Pazotina, PPouttz - Pazotina and P^Eozgia, pEiizing to af- cEztain, in a fzEzmanEnt and EguitatrtE mannEZ, ttzE OputEi to otiEZusd, zztativz to ttzE PommEZCE, and PozzEifionpEncE, urtzictz PJtzEg intend to Eitat- tiitz, tjztwzzn PJtzEiz ZEijjEctivE cPtatEi, PountziEi and Ontzatitanti, tza<j£ judged, ttzat the laid Pnd cannot Ije dsttsz obtained, ttzan tg Eitattiitzing ttzE molt ^Ezfzct Pguatitg and OpEcijizocitg, foz ttzE PPaiii of PPftzEiz ttzE lig- natuzE.

How¬ ever, the fall was not very high and can be considered to fit in with the seasonal pattern. The annual growth of the reserves decreased from / 119 million as per the end of February 1982 to f 97 million at the end of March. These surpluses increased the money supply. In addition money was being created through high domestic lending by the domestic banking system. Domestic credit rose by 19% or / 142,4 million in the period March 1981/February 1982. Two local banks, namely Maduro Sc Curiel’s Bank and Banco di Caribe, published balance sheet figures at the close of 1981. However, no income statement was included. In general they performed rather well, even in terms of income, as measured by retained earnings. The statements on external payments showed a surplus of / 96,2 million for 1981. A remarkable feature is the drop in merchandise imports of / 26,4 million to / 1320,9 million as a result of the decline of the Dutch guilder and other European currencies against the Antillean guilder. In¬ flation decreased from 7,4% in January to 7,1% p.a. in February 1982. Foreign reserves The level of foreign reserves de¬ creased during the months of March and April 1982. The total holdings amounted to / 300 mil¬ lion at the end of 1981 and grew to / 316 million as per February 18, 1982. During March 1982 reserves dropped to / 295 million and the drain continued during the month of April. At mid April foreign re¬ serves reached a level of approxi¬ mately/ 275 million. The decrease was recorded by both the Central Bank and the private banking sys¬ tem. Such a drop is normal during the second quarter when proceeds from tourism are falling, whereas the outflow of investment income such as interest payments and profit dibursements will in general show an increase. However, on an annual basis the months of April also showed a drop compared with January and February, which showed annual increases of / 117 million and / 119 million respec¬ tively. During March the annual growth was reduced to / 97 million and April will be even less, but the definite figure is not yet known. Although declining, the surpluses are still very high, reflecting an ex¬ cess of domestic savings over domestic investments. In view of the existing unemployment high surpluses can hardly by considered favourable, when they are caused by the lack of sufficient invest¬ ments. Monetary developments Recently the monetary figures as per the end of February 1982 have been published by the Central Bank. The money supply is grow¬ ing at an annual pace of almost 20% or / 195 million, reaching a level of / 1213 million at February 28. In particular the component comprising time deposits and sav¬ ings has been climbing rapidly, surpassing the growth rate of cur¬ rent accounts and money in circu¬ lation. Time deposits include those held by the island governments. At the end of February island gov¬ ernments’ deposits amounted to / 97,1 million of which / 28,5 mil¬ lion has been deposited with the Central Bank and / 68,6 million with the private banking system. Most of these amounts are held in the name of the island govern¬ ment of Aruba. At mid April the deposits with the Central Bank were still intact. The additional amount of / 195 million has been created through domestic lending by the banking system and the growth of the for¬ eign exchange reserves. Domestic credits rose by 19% or / 142,4 mil¬ lion during the period March 1981/February 1982. This rate exceeds by far the exist¬ ing inflation of 7,1% and suggests a development of investments. However, as already mentioned compared with domestic savings and in view of the high unemploy¬ ment rate many more investments are needed. Banking sector Two local banks published their fi¬ nancial statements for 1981. The statements comprised only the condensed balance sheet as per December 31. Consequently the information given is very limited. Especially the lack of the profit and loss account hampers a proper judgement of the financial de¬ velopments during the year. No balance sheet is complete without the income components and the expenditures as well as an explanatory statement indicating the standards applied in the val¬ uations of the items published, t 26 welcomes friends , relatives and business relations • tropical surroundings • relaxed atmosphere • cozy bars • fine accommodations EXCLUSIVE BUNGALOWS - SOON AVAILABLE IN TIME-SHARING PROJECT - CURASAO - TEL: 25200 The lack of the profit and loss ac¬ count is somewhat surprising, since the Code of Commerce of the Netherlands Antilles stipulates in article 76 that all banks must pub¬ lish a balance sheet and an income statement. The Maduro & Curiel’s Bank ex¬ perienced another succesful year of operations. On a consolidated basis total assets and deposits were f 740 million and / 618 million re¬ spectively, an increase of 12% and 16% over the previous year. To¬ gether with a restructing, stockhol¬ ders’ equity climbed to f 52,5 mil¬ lion, which is f 7,62 million or 17% more than at the close of 1980. Un¬ fortunately the profitability of the banking operations cannot be cal¬ culated, but solvency and liquidity can. Solvency defined as the rela¬ tion of stockholders’ equity to out¬ standing loans amounted to 12,4% in 1980 and 12,3% in 1981. Liquid¬ ity can be defined as the net amount of cash and related items, such as treasury paper as well as balances with banks compared to deposits taken and funds bor¬ rowed. This percentage declined from 10.9 in 1980to39.6in 1981. Banco di Caribe recorded a growth in the balance sheet total of 26% or / 6,4 million to f 31 million. Loans given and deposits taken amounted to / 23,2 million and / 27,3 million respectively. Stock¬ holders’ equity includes in addi¬ tion to paid-in capital and retained earnings also a subordinated loan of f 300,000 million. Retained earnings doubled from f 611,000 to / 1,228,000. Solvency improved from 8,3% in 1980 to 9,4% in 1981 and liquidity from 19,1% to 21,8%. Capital market For some time utility company KAE was faced with the problem to raise / 20 million to finance its in¬ vestments. Apparently no individual local banking institution was willing to provide this amount for the period requested. Finally the amount was furnished by a foreign bank, which in order to get the necessary funds without any currency risks, in turn bor¬ rowed from several local financial institutions, including banks and pension funds. In near future probably the fed¬ eral government will turn to the domestic capital market to raise an amount of presumably / 10 mil¬ lion to finance national airline A.L.M. The loan will yield an inter¬ est of over 12%. The A.L.M. needs funds for the purchase of new airplanes and to finance the continuing losses. Last year the airline recorded a loss of almost / 4 million which was con¬ siderably less than the expected amount of / 9 million. External payments As already known external pay¬ ments showed a record surplus of / 96,2 million for 1981, which re¬ sulted for a large part from remit¬ tances made by the oil refineries from their foreign banking ac¬ counts to pay local profit taxes. The statements on the external cash flow as published by the Cen¬ tral Bank mention more details and comprise some interesting as¬ pects. Most remarkable is the decline in the value of merchandise imports. Usually, imports will increase in an open economy due to inflation and } 27 It hath Math.

In 1981, how¬ ever, imports fell by / 26,4 million to/ 1320,9 million. This drop may partly be explained by the lower rate of the Dutch guil¬ der, which made imports from the Netherlands cheaper. Unfortunately no figures are avail¬ able on the volume of imports, which perhaps also declined. Ex¬ tremely high imports during 1980 may account for the decrease in 1981. The decline was recorded in the first and third quarter of 1981; the corresponding quarters in 1980 showed indeed very high amounts of imports compared with 1979. The fall in net proceeds from transportation is the result of higher payments to other coun¬ tries. Gross income stayed on the same level. In general tourism performed rather well, showing an increase of / 70 million to / 656,2 million. The breakdown per island, how¬ ever, indicates different develop¬ ments. Aruba experienced an excellent year recording a surge of / 16 mil¬ lion to / 259 million. Curasao, however, hardly recorded any sig¬ nificant increase; net proceeds grew from / 189 million to / 193 million. St. Maarten showed a growth of f 18 million to / 198 million. Curasao really had a disappointing year. Although, gross proceeds from tourism did in fact grow from / 266 million to / 283 million, this small improvement of 6% was al¬ most offset by higher spending abroad, which increased by 17% from / 77 million to / 90 million. Development aid fell from / 119,9 million to / 57,9 million. The high amount of 1980 includes a special grant of / 34,3 million to improve the balance of payments and pub¬ lic finance as well as / 21 million for airforce planes. The transfers by the oil refineries increased by / 98 million owing to tax payments, in particular by Lago Aruba. These payments are due in July of each year. Also this year Lago will pay more than the minimum amount of / 33 million. Sundry payments consist of pri¬ vate remittances to abroad which amounted to / 98,8 million and outflow because of other services of / 21,2 million as well as net er¬ rors and omissions representing an inflow of / 69,2 million. The latter experienced a tremend¬ ous increase compared with 1980 when statistical differences amounted to / 23,6. External capital payments The private sector increased its in¬ vestments abroad to a considerable extent. The net purchase of foreign sec¬ urities went up by / 39,7 million to / 56,3 million while foreign de¬ posits, which are maintained mainly with banks abroad, grew by over f 50 million. The high inter¬ est abroad, in particular compared with the domestic money and capi¬ tal market, may account for this development. The flow of government capital showed a change of / 22 million. The net amount climbed from / 31,3 million to / 53,3 million. The amount comprises borrow¬ ings from the Dutch government and the E.E.C. Development Fund as well as repayments on outstand¬ ing debts. Furthermore the changes in the balance of the treas¬ ury account with the Netherlands are included. C.O.T. Curasao Oil Terminal operates at the moment at half its capacity of one million barrels. The company, established in 1974 after the oil crisis, reached its maximum capac¬ ity in 1978. Last year the average use was about 700,000 barrels and nowadays approximately half a million barrels. In all those years more than 6,500 ships have called at the company. The year of 1981 proved to be rather successful. A net profit of / 55,5 million was recorded. C.O.T. agreed to pay a tax of / 22,4 million to the island govern¬ ment of Curasao. An amount of / 17 million has already been paid. During the first quarter of 1982 net income was about / 10 million resulting in an annual profit of / 40 million if no changes will occur in the international oil mar¬ ket. In that case C.O.T. will pay a tax of / 15 million. The manage¬ ment expects that the profits will continue during the next five years, although the circumstances are more difficult than in the past. The recession and energy saving measures will also affect the C.O.T. operations. Moreover, the sale in the U.S.A. has been hampered by import re¬ strictions, while the Louisana Offshore Port is certainly a strong competitor. The affiliated company Bullenbaai Marine Services recorded a profit of / 7,5 million during 1981. This company will pay a tax of / 4,9 mil¬ lion. ■ External cash flow; net amounts./-million.

Almost half the working force earns its livelihood in this sector. For that and a number of other reasons it would be a serious mistake if economic planning focuses too much on big industry. On the contrary it is small business that should be stimulated in the first place. A definition of terms is first of all re¬ quired. This can be done by way of com¬ parison. A gas station is usually consid¬ ered 'small business' and an oil refinery 'big industry'. But to be useful in re¬ search, legislation and economic plan¬ ning, such a general description needs precision. Definition More often than not quality is used as a determining factor. An approach which can be highly misleading. Defining the concept at stake on the basis of charac¬ teristics like independent management, conjunction of ownership and manage¬ ment, orientation on the immediate en¬ vironment etc. is obviously not very prac¬ tical. What should be taken into account first are criteria like the number of em¬ ployees, total investment and sales vol¬ ume i.e. standards of quantity. (The au¬ thor is of the opinion that of the criteria mentioned the number of employees is the most important). It should be noted, however, that it is vir¬ tually impossible to lay down universal norms in this respect, as situations differ widely with regard to geographies and levels of economic and technological de¬ velopment. It is to be expected for exam¬ ple that average sales per employer are higher in the USA than in Curasao, be¬ cause of the more advanced technology, the greater availability of capital and the much larger size of the market in the first mentioned country. Likewise Steimetz’s scale of critical de¬ velopment stages for small business does not apply universally. The scale indicates a first critical stage with regard to man¬ agement when the number of employees reaches 30. But in Curasao a firm em¬ ploying 30 people can hardly be called small. Thus rewriting the scale for Curasao seems logical. Adaptation In accordance the workgroup 'small business' of the University of the Netherlands Antilles has after proper research and mindful of the sectoral dif¬ ferences drawn up a number of indica¬ tive criteria with regard to small business in Curasao. For this purpose 262 out of the 3800 companies have been investigated. All of them had less than 25 employees. Moreover they were carefully selected from 12 different branches, making sure that each branch was at least represented by 10 concerns. Out of this research the following fig¬ ures have been obtained: Number of employees 0-10 Total investment Na/. 0 - 500,000 Sales per year Na/. 0 - 1,000,000 Caution, however, should be exersized as significant differences may occur be¬ tween the different branches. This is il¬ lustrated by index I in which the distri¬ bution of total investment in three categories of three different sectors is in¬ dicated. Relevance As mentioned above it would be a serious mistake to concentrate economic plan¬ ning on big industry. Natural resources are too minimal and the risk of discon¬ tinuation too large. Thus reality forces us to focus primarely on small business. According to the above mentioned re¬ search the average number of people employed in this type of enterprise in Curasao is 7. In total this amounts to al¬ most 50% of the labour force! A figure which leaves little doubt about the im¬ portance of small business for the em¬ ployment situation. Although the impact of small business on the balance of payments, an economic datum almost just as important for Curasao as the employment figure, has never been determined, it may be as¬ sumed to be of less importance than the employment figure. An observation which should not lead to underestimat¬ ing the importance of the balance of pay¬ ments, certainly not with a view to the fu¬ ture. To discuss whether preference should be given to export promotion or to im¬ port substitution is beyond the scope of this article. The author, however, is in¬ clined to favour the former. But doing one thing need not imply leav¬ ing out the other. Import substitution needs to be stimulated with all available means. Such a policy will, no doubt, be of great benefit to small business, in par¬ ticular with regard to agriculture and in¬ dustry. Export promotion, on the other hand, will stimulate trade and the ser¬ vice-rendering industries. The thrust towards the latter should pri¬ marely be initiated by the internationally oriented enterprises in this sector. A de¬ velopment which may result in positive external economic effects, favouring the more locally oriented trade and service rendering industries, which in turn will stimulate, be it in a more indirect way, small business. Potential An often heard misconception is that small business can only survive by the grace of Big Industry’s tolerance or be¬ cause the latter has not yet moved into certain markets. Another such miscon¬ ception is that small business’ continuity can only be guaranteed by government protection.

Small business has its own intrinsic assets which it can con¬ tinue to exploit, such as: — a much more intensive relation to the markets and — as a result a greater opportunity for market and product specialization — more room for competition and — greater flexibility in organization. Admittedly the last point usually does not work out very well in practice be¬ cause of a. frequently occurring problems of a family nature. A typical example is that the younger generation often prefers to launch out by itself rather than succeed in the family business. b. the attitude of many entrepreneurs to regard their business both as their baby and mistress. An attitude which makes them too apprehensive of the possible influence third parties, they need for expansion, might acquire in their business. c. Many entrepreneurs use their busi¬ ness for the purpose of selfsatisfac¬ tion. Small markets, like Curasao demand small enterprises. As there is no room for mass production small business can function much more effectively, in par¬ ticular if no advanced technology and as a consequence no large capital invest¬ ment is required. This becomes even more relevant in situations (Curasao) where capital is tight. Survival Although everyone has in principle the opportunity to start a small business, proper planning is required. Many are the pitfalls which have to be evaded, if the business once started is to survive. Dun /& Bradstreet have provided us with a list of nine important causes which can lead to failure: lack of management expertise, too little starting capital, wrong choice of loca¬ tion, faulty stock policy, too heavy invest¬ ment in fixed assets, inadequate credit policy, too much withdrawal for private purposes, overexpansion and poor labour attitude. It is evident that all these aspects are also present in Curasao. In the case of failure or near bankruptcy they frequently are found in combination. Young enter¬ prises seem particularly prone to make one or more of the mentioned mistakes. As a result their death rate is the highest. Although financial problems are the main cause of failure in most cases, at least part of this phenomenum can be traced back to bad management and lack of experience. This implies that the fi¬ nancial burden, which small entrep¬ reneurs in Curasao consider their great¬ est problem, could be alleviated consid¬ erably by upgrading the general level of management. To start a business, even a small business, great ideas are not enough. All the con¬ sequences should first be studied care¬ fully. A 100% dedication to the job and the willingness to sacrifice are indispens¬ able. Of course it would be ideal if per¬ sonal aspirations could coincide with the organizational objectives, but certainly in the beginning the first will have to be tempered.
