Sept. 20, 1943, Kano, Nigeria - d. June 8, 1998, Abuja, Nigeria), chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council of Nigeria (1993-98). A career military man, he rose through the ranks (colonel, 1975; brigadier, 1980) and assisted (December 1983) Ibrahim Babangida in overthrowing elected president Alhaji Shehu Shagari. In 1985 Babangida staged another coup and installed himself as leader of the nation. Abacha became army chief of staff (1985) and defense minister and second in command to Babangida (1990). Elections in 1993 were apparently won by the Social Democratic candidate, Moshood Abiola, but the military government soon annulled the results. Abacha took advantage of public outrage and took power himself. While he promised a return to civilian rule by 1995, he dismantled most democratic institutions and siphoned off for himself as much as $4 billion of the country's oil profits. In June 1994 Abiola publicly declared himself the rightful president of Nigeria and was promptly jailed on treason charges. On Nov. 10, 1995, writer and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists from the oil-rich Ogoniland area in the southeast were executed for treason; Nigeria was subsequently suspended from the Commonwealth. In March 1997 Wole Soyinka, self-exiled Nobel laureate and Nigeria's best-known writer, was charged with treason in absentia. Though in October 1995 Abacha had said he would step down after elections to be held in 1998, in early 1997 he hinted that he might want to run for president himself. After supporters ensured his adoption as the lone candidate by all five political parties in April 1998, Abacha was widely expected to keep hold of power through presidential elections scheduled for August 1. He died in office. He was also chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (1996-98).\n\nAbad Santos (y Basco), Jose (b. Feb. 19, 1886, San Fernando, Pampanga, Philippines - d.

He was also ambassador to France (1873-74) and overseas minister (1894-95).\n\nAbascal\n\nAbascal (Carranza), (José) Carlos (María) (b. June 14, 1949, Mexico City, Mexico - d. Dec. 2, 2008, Mexico City), interior minister of Mexico (2005-06). He was the son of Salvador Abascal Infante, founder of the reactionary-Catholic Unión Nacional Sinarquista, which later became the Partido Demócrata Mexicano. He was president of the powerful business association Coparmex before he became labour minister when Pres. Vicente Fox took office in 2000 after a historic election victory that ended 71 years of one-party rule. He is credited with avoiding major conflict with organized labour as Mexico made the transition from decades of cozy relations between the Institutional Revolutionary Party and union bosses co-opted by the long-ruling party. He drew ridicule early in his tenure as labour minister when he publicly objected to erotic passages in books by Carlos Fuentes and Gabriel García Márquez on his 14-year-old daughter's reading list at school.\n\nAbashidze\n\nAbashidze, Aslan (Ibragimovich), Georgian Aslan (Ibraimis dze) Abashidze (b. July 20, 1938, Batumi, Adzhar A.S.S.R., Georgian S.S.R.), chairman of the Supreme Council of Ajaria (1991-2004). He was minister of consumer services of the Adzhar A.S.S.R. in 1984-86, then deputy minister of consumer services of the Georgian S.S.R. In 1991 he was appointed to head the autonomous republic, which he kept out of the Georgian turmoil in subsequent years and ruled in an authoritarian fashion. He was a Georgian presidential candidate in 2000, but withdrew shortly before the election. Considered pro-Russian, he was elected in Ajaria by popular vote for the first time on Nov. 4, 2001. In 2004 Pres. Mikheil Saakashvili's administration in Tbilisi sought to assert its authority over the region, and Abashidze gave up power and moved to Moscow when security guarantees were provided for him, Saakashvili pledging that he would not seek Abashidze's extradition. In March 2006 he was charged with the premeditated murder on April 30, 1991, of his deputy, Nodar Imnadze. According to Imnadze's daughter, who witnessed the killing, Abashidze shot Imnadze four times in the back following a heated disagreement but Abashidze's lawyer said he fired in self-defense after Imnadze opened fire in his office and injured both Abashidze and Murman Omanidze (later acting prime minister of Georgia). He was found guilty in absentia on Jan. 22, 2007, of forming illegal armed groups, defying the Georgian central government, and misappropriation of state property. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and to pay $57 million in compensation to the Georgian budget.\n\nAbat, Fortunato (U.) (b. June 10, 1925, La Union, Philippines - d.

Feb. 4, 1904, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India - d. Dec. 18, 1967, Rawalpindi, Pakistan), supreme head of Azad Kashmir (1951).\n\nF. Abbas\n\nAbbas, Ferhat (Mekki), Arabic Farhat `Abbas (b. Aug. 24, 1899, Bouafroune, near Constantine, Algeria - d. Dec. 24, 1985, Algiers, Algeria), Algerian politician. Early in his political career he was considered a pro-French moderate. In the 1930s he was a minor official in the French administration in northeast Algeria. But he became increasingly nationalist in his views and drafted the \"Manifesto of the Algerian People\" (proclaimed Feb. 10, 1943), which called for autonomy for Algeria and equality for the Muslims. As the French rejected anything other than \"French Algeria,\" Abbas and an Algerian working-class leader, Messali Hadj, formed the Friends of the Manifesto and Liberty (March 14, 1944), which envisioned a federation of an independent Algeria and France. Arrested on May 8, 1945, he was released in March 1946 and a month later founded the Democratic Union of the Algerian Manifesto, which advocated cooperation with France in the formation of the Algerian state. But his conciliatory attempts failed to evoke a sympathetic response from French officials, and in 1956 he escaped to Cairo to join what became known as the National Liberation Front (FLN), committed to revolutionary struggle for independence. On Sept. 19, 1958, a Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic was formed with Abbas as president. He resigned in 1961 but was elected president of the Algerian Constituent Assembly when Algeria gained independence in 1962. To protest the drafting of the Algerian constitution by the FLN outside the Constituent Assembly, he resigned his post as president of the assembly on Aug. 14, 1963, and was expelled from the FLN. He was placed under house arrest on July 3, 1964, but was released the following year. His issue of an appeal to the people on March 11, 1976, was followed by another period of house arrest.\n\nM. Abbas\n\nAbbas, Mahmoud (Rida), Arabic Mahmud (Rida) `Abbas, byname Abu Mazen (b. March 26?, 1935, Safed, Palestine [now in Israel]), prime minister (2003) and president (2005- ) of the Palestinian Authority. A founding member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964, he remained at Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat's side as secretary-general of the PLO executive committee and, since 1968, as a member of the Palestine National Council, the PLO legislature. He argued for political dialogue with Israel in the 1970s when most other Palestinians believed in securing their rights by armed struggle. But the PLO did not seriously pursue the political option he advocated until 1982, when it was expelled from Lebanon. Along with the rest of the PLO leadership in exile, he had to seek refuge in Tunisia until 1994. He was the main PLO liaison man with the Palestinian delegation at the Madrid international peace conference in 1991. Israel at that time still insisted the PLO was a terrorist organization and would only deal with Palestinian leaders living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as part of a Jordanian delegation. In 1993 secret contacts overseen by Abbas culminated in the Oslo peace accord under which Israel and the PLO recognized each other and the Palestinians obtained limited autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Becoming the first Palestinian prime minister in 2003, he pledged to rein in armed factions and democratize governance to advance the U.S.-backed \"road map to peace.\" But four months later he resigned over what he called obstruction by Arafat - who denied charges of fomenting violence - and continued Israeli military strikes. Following Arafat's death in 2004, he took over as chairman of the PLO executive committee, and in early 2005 he was elected president.\n\nAbbas, Maldoum Bada (b. 1952 - d. 2006?), interior minister (1991) and justice minister (1995-96) of Chad.\n\nY.S. Abbas\n\nAbbas, Youssouf Saleh (b. 1952, Abéché, Chad), prime minister of Chad (2008-10).\n\nAbbas Halim Pasha, (Prince Muhammad) (b. Sept. 29, 1866, Cairo, Egypt - d. Jan. 10, 1935, Cairo), Ottoman official; brother of Said Halim Pasha. He was governor of Bursa (1913-14) and minister of public works (1914-17).\n\nAbbas Hilmi\n\nAbbas Hilmi Pasha, Arabic `Abbas Hilmi Basha, also called Abbas II (b. July 14, 1874, Alexandria, Egypt - d. Dec. 20, 1944, Geneva, Switzerland), khedive (viceroy) of Egypt (1892-1914). He was barely of age when the sudden death of his father, Muhammad Tawfiq Pasha, raised him to the khediviate. At the beginning of his reign, he was eager to exercise his new power and did not cooperate very cordially with Britain, whose increasing influence over Egypt had led to popular discontent and enthusiastic support for the nationalists. In 1894 he criticized the military efficiency of the British troops, whereupon the British consul-general, Baron Cromer, took steps to curb the viceroy's independence of action. Thereafter, although no longer heading the nationalist movement, Abbas provided financial assistance to the pan-Islamic and anti-British daily newspaper Al-Mu`ayyad. But during a visit to England in 1900, he declared himself ready to follow British advice and to cooperate with British officials. When in 1906 the nationalists demanded constitutional government for Egypt, Abbas rejected their demands. In 1907 he agreed to the formation of the National Party, to counter the Ummah Party of the moderate nationalists, which was supported by the British. Abbas' authority was further curtailed under the rule of Viscount Kitchener as consul-general (1911-14). On the outbreak of World War I Abbas was convalescing at his palace on the shores of the Bosporus, in Turkey. Unable to extricate himself from his loyalty to his sovereign and unwilling to return to Egypt, he found himself deposed, and Egypt declared a British protectorate, on Dec. 18, 1914. In 1922, when Egypt was declared independent, Abbas lost all rights to the throne. He passed the rest of his life in exile, mainly in Switzerland.\n\nAbbasi, Mohammad Abbas (Ali Khan) (b. March 22, 1924, Bahawalpur, Punjab, India [now in Pakistan] - d.

Nov. 13, 1957, Wichita Falls, Texas), governor of Texas (2015- ).\n\nJ. Abbott\n\nAbbott, Sir John (Joseph Caldwell) (b. March 12, 1821, St. Andrews, Lower Canada [now St.-André-Est, Que.] - d. Oct. 30, 1893, Montreal, Que.), prime minister of Canada (1891-92). In 1849 he signed the Annexation Manifesto, a document drawn up by a group of Montreal businessmen, advocating that the Canadian colonies relinquish their ties with Britain and join the United States. The threat of annexation was used mostly to extract concessions from Britain, but his opponents never let him forget this embarrassment. In 1857 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the united province of Canada. In 1862 he served briefly as solicitor general in the Liberal administration of John Sandfield Macdonald and Louis Sicotte before going over to the Conservatives in 1865. As legal adviser to Sir Hugh Allan, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Abbott was implicated in the Pacific Scandal of 1873, in which Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald was accused of awarding a railway construction contract to Allan in return for campaign funds. As a result of the scandal, Abbott was defeated in the 1874 election, but he was reelected to the House of Commons in a by-election in 1881. On May 12, 1887, he was appointed to the Senate, in which he was made government leader. From 1887 to 1888 he was also mayor of Montreal. When, after the death of Macdonald in June 1891, the Conservatives looked for a new leader, Charles Tupper and John Thompson both successfully declined the job for different reasons but Abbott, although himself not enthusiastic about taking the position, was convinced to take the reins of power. He was unique in that he was the first Canadian prime minister who ruled from the Senate. The following year he resigned because of ill health and was knighted.\n\nAbbott, John T(rue) (b. 1850, Keene, N.H. - d. March 8, 1914, Keene), U.S. diplomat; nephew of Person C. Cheney. He was minister to Colombia (1889-93).\n\nT. Abbott\n\n(1957- )\n\nAbbott, Tony, byname of Anthony John Abbott (b. Nov. 4, 1957, London, England), prime minister of Australia (2013-15). He took a job as press secretary for Liberal Party leader John Hewson in 1990 and became executive director for Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy in 1993. In a March 1994 by-election, he was elected as MP for Warringah (New South Wales). In 1996 he became parliamentary secretary to the minister for employment, education, training, and youth affairs. He was minister for employment services (1998-2001), then was elevated to the cabinet as minister for employment, workplace relations, and small business (2001-03) and health and ageing (2003-07), and became leader of the Liberal Party and leader of the opposition on Dec. 1, 2009, defeating Malcolm Turnbull. He won the 2013 elections but was toppled already two years later when Turnbull successfully challenged him, winning back the party leadership and with it the prime ministership. The party had consistently been lagging behind the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls. Abbott was widely seen as too conservative and divisive and as governing in an authoritarian style. A series of hugely unpopular so-called \"captain's picks\" - most notoriously announcing an Australian knighthood for Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh - were not outweighed by his claimed achievements such as \"stopping the boats\" (of would-be immigrants). He lost his seat in the 2019 elections.\n\nT. Abbott\n\n(1941- )\n\nAbbott, Tony, byname of Anthony John Abbott (b. Sept. 9, 1941, Ashton-under-Lyne, England), governor of Montserrat (1997-2001).\n\nAbboud\n\nAbboud, Ibrahim, Arabic `Abbud (b. Oct. 26, 1900, Muhammad Qawl [now in al-Bahr al-Ahmar state], Sudan - d. Sept. 9, 1983, Khartoum, Sudan), head of state of The Sudan (1958-64). He entered the Sudan Defense Force in 1925 and served in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and North Africa during World War II. He was promoted to the rank of general and appointed deputy commander-in-chief of the Sudanese army in 1954, and became commander-in-chief at the time of attainment of independence in 1956. He led an army coup against the government of Abdullah Khalil in 1958 and became chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and prime minister. His regime was unable either politically or economically to maintain effective rule over the country. After a civilian coup in late October 1964, he remained president but his power was severely limited; he resigned in mid-November in accordance with \"the people's desire to liquidate the military regime in all its forms\" and retired from public life.\n\n`Abd al-Ahad Khan (b. March 16, 1859 - d. June 1, 1911), emir of Bukhara (1885-1911).\n\n`Abd Allah (ibn Muhammad al-Ta´i´ishi), also called Abdullahi (b. 1846, Sudan - d. Nov. 24, 1899, Kordofan), Sudanese leader. Around 1880 he became a disciple of Muhammad Ahmad, who became known as al-Mahdi and made himself ruler of the Sudan. `Abd Allah was appointed a caliph (khalifa), and became leader of the Mahdist movement after al-Mahdi's death in 1885. Although al-Mahdi had clearly designated him as successor, the Ashraf, a portion of al-Mahdi's supporters, tried to reverse this decision, but `Abd Allah neutralized this opposition by promptly securing control of the vital administrative positions in the movement and obtaining the support of the most religiously sincere group of al-Mahdi's followers. He believed he could best establish his authority by maintaining the expansionist momentum begun by al-Mahdi. He launched attacks against Ethiopia and began an invasion of Egypt, where his troops suffered a crushing defeat in 1889. A feared Anglo-Egyptian advance up the Nile did not materialize at that time; instead, `Abd Allah suffered famine and military defeats in the eastern Sudan. In 1896, however, Anglo-Egyptian forces began their reconquest of the Sudan. Although `Abd Allah resisted for almost two years, he could not prevail against British machine guns. The Anglo-Egyptian army commanded by Lord Kitchener defeated the Mahdists at the Battle of Omdurman on Sept. 2, 1898. `Abd Allah was forced to flee the capital, but he remained at large with a considerable army. Many Egyptians and Sudanese resented the Condominium Agreement of January 1899, by which the Sudan became almost a British protectorate, and `Abd Allah hoped to rally support. But on Nov. 24, 1899, a British force wiped out the Mahdist remnants, and `Abd Allah died in the fighting.\n\nAbd el-Krim\n\nAbd el-Krim, in full Muhammad ibn `Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi (b. 1882, Ajdir, Morocco - d. Feb. 6, 1963, Cairo, Egypt), leader of the Rif Republic (1923-26). In 1915 he was appointed the chief Muslim judge for the district of Melilla. He began to be disillusioned with Spanish rule in Morocco, opposed Spanish policies, and was imprisoned. He escaped and in 1918 was made chief Muslim judge at Melilla again, but he left the post in 1919 to return to Ajdir. When in 1920 a Spanish commander seized the holy town of Chechaouen, Abd el-Krim's father opened hostilities and was killed; the son vowed to avenge his father's death and began to organize tribal resistance against the foreign occupiers. In July 1921 he defeated a disorganized Spanish army at Annoual and pursued it to the suburbs of Melilla. In 1923 the Rif Republic was founded with Abd el-Krim as head of state. He defeated another Spanish army and captured his only rival, Raisuli, in 1924. In 1925 he crossed into French Morocco, almost reaching the ancient city of Fès. Seeing their colonial possessions threatened, a Franco-Spanish conference meeting in Madrid decided upon joint action. As a Spanish force landed at Alhucemas near Ajdir, a French army of 160,000 men under Marshal Philippe Pétain attacked from the south. Abd el-Krim surrendered to the French on May 27, 1926, and was deported to Réunion in the Indian Ocean. In 1947 he was to be transferred to house arrest in France, but he jumped ship at the Suez Canal and was granted political asylum by Egypt; for five years he presided over the Liberation Committee of the Arab West (sometimes called the Maghrib Bureau) in Cairo. After the restoration of Moroccan independence (1956), King Muhammad V invited him to return, which he refused as long as French troops remained on North African soil.\n\nAbdallah, Abdel Rahman (b. 1933, Abu Hamad, Sudan), Sudanese politician. He was minister of public service and administrative reform (1971-77), industry and mining (1977), and transport (1977-78) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1980-84).\n\nAbdelwahab\n\nAbdallah\n\nAhmed\n\nAbdallah\n\nAsmaa\n\nAbdallah\n\nAbdallah, Abdelwahab, Arabic `Abd al-Wahhab `Abd Allah (b.

May 31, 2016, Rochester, Minn.), chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (1976-82) and president (1982-2016) of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic. He joined the liberation struggle of the Spanish Sahara while at university in Rabat, Morocco, becoming one of the early activists of the independence movement Polisario, founded in 1973. When Spain relinquished its control in 1976, Morocco and Mauritania laid claim to Western Sahara, despite a ruling from the International Court of Justice that the region should become independent. Morocco came to occupy most of the region and Mauritania a smaller part. In February 1976, Polisario declared the independence of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), a government-in-exile based in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria's Tindouf province. This government was supported by Algeria and came to be recognized by up to about 65 nations. In August 1976, Abdelaziz was elected secretary-general of Polisario and head of state of the SADR. After negotiations with Polisario, Mauritania abandoned its claims in 1979, but this only led to Morocco taking over the entire territory. A lengthy peace process with UN involvement has continued ever since. A ceasefire was reached in 1991, under which Morocco consolidated its control; only a narrow zone in the east was controlled by Polisario. Morocco nominally agreed to but in practice delayed the holding of an independence referendum. In 1982 the SADR was admitted to the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which led to Morocco's withdrawal from the organization for over 30 years. In 2002 Abdelaziz was one of five regional representatives chosen to inaugurate the African Union, the successor to the OAU.\n\nAbdelghani, Mohamed Ben Ahmed, Arabic Muhammad ibn Ahmad `Abd al-Ghani (b.

In 1965, he received medical and military training in Syria before going to the field with the Eritrean Liberation Front, one of two rebel groups at that time fighting for independence from Ethiopia. In the 1970s and '80s, he became a leading military commander with the other rebel group, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, which became the People's Front for Democracy and Justice. In 1993, he became minister of internal affairs in the provisional government after Eritrea won its 30-year struggle for independence. In 1997-2000 he was minister of trade and industry. Generally regarded as a hawk, most of his overseas trips as foreign minister were to the Middle East (he was a fluent Arabic speaker), though he travelled to Russia in April 2005. His main task, however, was to handle the small Red Sea state's tricky relations with giant neighbour Ethiopia. The two countries, who lost 70,000 people in a 1998-2000 border war, were in political deadlock since 2002, when Ethiopia refused to accept a demarcation decision by an independent boundary commission.\n\nAbdellah, Slaheddine (b.

Sept. 29, 1939, Donji Vidovec, Bosnia), Bosnian politician. He won the most votes in Bosnia's 1990 election but traded the job of chairman of the Presidency to Alija Izetbegovic in exchange for placing one of his men in charge at the Ministry of Interior. As the prosperous director of a large food processing business in the northeast of the country, Abdic had an independent financial and political base which he took with him when the Bosnian war started. Forming his own autonomous province, Abdic worked with separatist Serbs and Croats against the Bosnian government and its troops. The Abdic rebellion collapsed in 1995 and he and his people fled to Croatia. Most Bosnians viewed him as a traitor. In June 2001 Abdic was accused of war crimes by Bosnia, but according to a cooperation agreement between Croatia and Bosnia, he was tried in Croatia. On July 31, 2002, he was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nAbdikadirov, Tuleubek (Abdikadirovich) (b. Feb. 8, 1940, Kanaka, Tadzhik S.S.R. - d.

Oct. 3, 1901, Kabul), emir of Afghanistan (1880-1901). He played a prominent role in the fierce contest for power waged by his father Afzal Khan and his uncle A`zam Khan against his cousin Shir `Ali. In 1869 Shir `Ali forced Abdor Rahman into exile. He placed himself under Russian protection at Samarkand. Shir `Ali's death in 1879 furnished Abdor Rahman with an opportunity to recover his kingdom. He returned to Afghanistan in 1880 and was heartily welcomed by his people. He remained in northern Afghanistan until the British negotiated a settlement recognizing him as amir and granting assistance provided that he followed British advice in regard to his external relations. In the following years he consolidated his authority, first defeating Shir `Ali's son Ayyub Khan, who marched from his base in Herat and occupied Kandahar in 1881, later crushing a revolt by the powerful Ghilzai tribe and an unexpected rebellion led by his cousin Ishaq Khan, and finally beating down the resistance of the Hazara tribe (1892). In 1893 agreement was reached on the demarcation of Afghanistan's northwestern border with Russia, the result of talks held near Kabul with a British delegation led by Sir Mortimer Durand, under which Abdor Rahman accepted the Durand line as his frontier. He also reorganized the administrative system of the country, imported machinery for making munitions, introduced manufacture of consumer goods and new agricultural tools, and established Afghanistan's first modern hospital. He held open courts for the receipt of petitioners and the dispensation of justice, but the exercise of his personal authority was often stained by acts of unnecessary cruelty.\n\nAbdou, Ahmed (b. 1936, Mutsamudu, Anjouan, Comoros), finance minister (1972, 1973-75) and prime minister (1996-97) of the Comoros.\n\nM.

Nov. 9, 1953, al-Ta´if, Saudi Arabia), king of Saudi Arabia (1932-53). When he was still a child, his family was driven into exile by their rivals, the Rashids, and found refuge in Kuwait. From there he set out in 1901 with 40 camelmen in a bold attempt to regain his family's lands. Reaching their old family capital, Riyadh, the little group slipped into the town by night (January 1902). Abdul Aziz lay hidden until the Rashidi governor emerged from the castle; then, rushing forward with his men, he killed him and seized the castle. This exploit roused the former supporters of his dynasty. They rallied to so magnetic a leader, and in two years of raids and skirmishes he reconquered half of central Arabia. During World War I he entered into a treaty with the British (December 1915), accepting protectorate status and agreeing to make war against Ibn Rashid, who sided with the Turks. During 1920-22, he marched against Ibn Rashid and extinguished Rashidi rule, doubling his territory. He then invaded the Hejaz region along the Red Sea. In 1924 it was added to his dominions. In 1932 he formally unified his domains into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. During World War II he preserved a benevolent neutrality toward Britain. In May 1933 he had signed his first agreement with an American oil company. Not until March 1938 did the company strike oil, and oil revenues were limited until about 1950. From then on the oil income increased rapidly, reaching some $200,000,000 in 1952. While much of this went for personal expenditure, he also called in expert commissions to plan the country's development.\n\nAbdul Aziz Abdul Majid, Ungku (b. Aug. 17, 1887 - d.

During World War II, Iraq's government was strongly pro-British, until the ardent Anglophobe Rashid Ali al-Gaylani succeeded Nuri al-Said as prime minister. The new prime minister sought close ties with Nazi Germany to release Iraq from British domination. Abdul Ilah and Nuri al-Said both were proponents of close cooperation with Britain and pressed Rashid Ali to resign. In response, the army surrounded the royal palace in Baghdad on April 1, 1941. The regent and his entourage escaped to Habbaniyah, from there to Basra and thence to Amman in Transjordan. Rashid Ali and four generals dubbed the \"Golden Square\" announced that the temporarily absent regent was deposed. The British quickly intervened by landing forces at Basra on April 19, and the revolt was suppressed by the end of May, and Abdul Ilah reinstated as regent. He maintained strong ties with the West. When King Faysal reached legal age on May 2, 1953, the regent relinquished his functions but remained as the young king's chief adviser and companion and became crown prince. He accompanied Faysal on his state visit to Britain in 1956. He was shot in the royal palace on July 14, 1958, when a revolution broke out in Baghdad during which Faysal was also killed.\n\nAbdul Ilah (ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud) (b. 1938?, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia), Saudi prince; son of Abdul Aziz.

April 1, 1960, Kuala Lumpur), paramount ruler of Malaya (1957-60). The son of Tuanku Muhammad, ruler of the state of Negeri Sembilan, Abdul Rahman held a variety of posts in the civil service. On the death of his father in 1933, he succeeded as yang di-pertuan besar of Negeri Sembilan. He attended the coronation of King George VI in London in 1937. After independence from Britain in 1957, he became the first yang di-pertuan agong (head of state) of Malaya, elected by and from the Malay rulers for a five-year term. He died before completion of his term. Abdul Rahman was a retiring and kindly man who learned from his father a deep respect for constitutional law and a sympathy for his people.\n\nTunku Abdul\n\nRahman\n\nAbdul Rahman Putra Alhaj (ibni Almarhum Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah), Tunku (Prince) (b. Feb. 8, 1903, Alor Star, Kedah, Malaya [now Malaysia] - d. Dec. 6, 1990, Kuala Lumpur), prime minister of Malaya (1957-59, 1959-63) and of Malaysia (1963-70). The 20th child of Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah of Kedah, he entered the Kedah civil service in 1931. During World War II he quietly worked against the Japanese occupiers. He resigned his post as deputy public prosecutor in the Malayan Federal Legal Department in 1951 to begin a political career. He had been one of the founders of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) in 1945 and was elected its president in 1951. He allied UMNO with the Malayan Chinese Association (1952) and with the Malayan Indian Congress (1955). His Alliance Party won an overwhelming majority in the elections of 1955, and he became chief minister and home minister. In negotiations in London in January 1956 he secured the pledge of independence by August 1957. When Malaya became independent, he became its first prime minister and foreign minister, and he continued in those posts when the larger federation of Malaysia was formed in 1963. Violence between the Chinese and the Malays broke out in 1969 because of Malay fears after an election in which the Chinese had made gains; at least 200 persons were killed. Parliamentary government was suspended, and Abdul Rahman relinquished his post as prime minister in September 1970. In 1970-73 he was the first secretary-general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. His interest in his country remained, and he lamented over the years that it had not become all that he had hoped it would. In 1988 he came out of retirement to speak out against Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, accusing him of having turned Malaysia into a police state. He received the titles Dato' Seri (1975) and Datuk Seri Utama (1985).\n\nAbdul Rahman (bin) Yakub, Tun (Haji) (b. Jan. 3, 1928, Kampung Jepak village, near Bintulu, Sarawak [now in Malaysia] - d.

March 11, 1922, Pekan, Pahang, Federated Malay States [now Malaysia] - d. Jan. 14, 1976, London, England), prime minister (1959, 1970-76) and foreign minister (1970-75) of Malaysia; son-in-law of Tan Sri Mohamed Noah Omar. He was a guerrilla fighter against Japanese occupation forces in World War II. He joined the civil service in 1950, entered politics in 1955, served as chief minister of Pahang (1955) and as education minister (1956-57), and was a key architect and mainspring of gaining Malaya's independence from Britain in 1957. He was deputy prime minister (1957-59, 1959-70) under Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, also minister of defense (1957-73, 1974-76), rural development (1959-69), home affairs (1967-69), and finance (1969-70); in 1959 he was briefly prime minister when Abdul Rahman resigned to devote himself full-time to campaigning ahead of elections. In 1966 he was the key negotiator in ending Malaysia's war with Indonesia. Appointed head of the National Operations Council set up with emergency powers in 1969, he steered the country through that year's violent disturbances between Malays and Chinese. In 1970 he succeeded Abdul Rahman as prime minister. He eased Malaysia from its former staunch pro-Western position toward nonalignment, and in 1974 established diplomatic relations with mainland China. He worked to help the rural, poorer Malays catch up with the Chinese, who dominated the Malaysian economy. Many Malaysians called him the \"father of development\" because of his drive for improved economic well-being. A touchstone of his policies was international economic cooperation. On Aug. 31, 1959, he was awarded the Seri Maharaja Mangku Negara, one of Malaya's (and Malaysia's) highest honours, which carries the title of Tun. He also held the titles of Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar (Nov. 1, 1950), Dato' Seri (1964), and Datuk Seri Panglima (May 1, 1971). He died in office.\n\nAbdul Taib (bin) Mahmud, Tun (Haji) (b. May 21, 1936, Miri, Sarawak [now in Malaysia] - d. Feb. 21, 2024, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), chief minister (1981-2014) and head of state (2014-24) of Sarawak; nephew of Tun Abdul Rahman Yakub. He received the titles Datuk (1972), Datuk Amar (1974), Datuk Patinggi (1981), Datuk Seri (1988), Tan Sri (1989), Dato' Seri (1991), Pehin Sri (2003), and Tun (2014). He was Malaysian minister of primary industries (1972-74, 1977-78), general planning and socioeconomic research (1974-77), information and special functions (1975-77), defense (1978-80), and the federal territory (1980-81). He was deputy president (1973-75, 1977-81) and president (1975-77 [acting], 1981-2014) of the Sarawak-based Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu, member of the Barisan Nasional coalition. In 2014 he retired as the longest-serving chief minister in Malaysia, having been elected for eight consecutive terms. He was said to have personally accumulated some U.S.$15 billion, partly through ownership of shipping and construction companies and control of Sarawak's logging industry and mineral resources. In 2009 a report claimed that the state had lost 90% of its rainforest. In 2013 the anti-corruption commission (MACC) conducted an investigation into multiple allegations of graft involving Taib, but nothing came of it.\n\nAbdul Wahhab, Samir Muhammad (b. 1945, Baghdad, Iraq), interior minister of Iraq (1987-91).

Aug. 4, 1946, Dagestan A.S.S.R., Russian S.F.S.R.), president/head of the republic of Dagestan (2013-17). He was also a Russian deputy prime minister (1997-98), minister of ethnic policy (1998-99), and ambassador to Tajikistan (2005-09).\n\nAbdulayev\n\nAbdulaziz\n\nAbdulayev, Magomed (Imranovich) (b.

[road accident] Jan. 5, 2023, Makhachkala, Dagestan, Russia), prime minister of Dagestan (2010-13).\n\nAbdulaziz, Mohamed (Imhamid) (b. 1952?), foreign minister of Libya (2012-14).\n\nAbdulgani, Roeslan (b. Nov. 24, 1914, Surabaya, Netherlands East Indies [now in Jawa Timur, Indonesia] - d. June 29, 2005, Jakarta, Indonesia), foreign minister of Indonesia (1956-57). At age 17 he joined the Indonesia Muda (Young Indonesia) pro-independence movement that sought to bring to an end 350 years of Dutch colonial rule. During Indonesia's war of independence from 1945 to 1949, he was badly wounded and lost the use of his right hand when his unit was strafed by Dutch fighters. After the war, he served in the foreign ministry and was tasked in 1955 by President Sukarno to organize the first gathering of 29 newly independent nations from Asia and Africa. This later grew into the Non-Aligned Movement, which tried to steer a neutral course between the Eastern and Western blocs during the Cold War. Abdulgani was later named foreign minister, also was minister of information (1962-64), a deputy chief minister (1962-63), and a deputy prime minister (1966), served as permanent representative to the United Nations (1967-71), and was a member of the presidential advisory team until 1993.\n\nAbdülhamid Ferid Pasha (b. 1815, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey] - d. March 1875), Ottoman official. He was minister of waqfs (1863-65, 1866-68), privy purse (1871, 1871-76), and navy (1871, 1875).\n\nAbdülhamit I (b. March 20, 1725 - d. April 7, 1789), ruler of the Ottoman Empire (1774-89); brother of Mustafa III.\n\nAbdülhamit II\n\nAbdülhamit II (b. Sept. 21, 1842, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey] - d. Feb. 10, 1918, Constantinople), ruler of the Ottoman Empire (1876-1909). The second son of Sultan Abdülmecit I, he came to the throne when his brother Murat V was declared insane on Aug. 31, 1876. On Dec. 23, 1876, he promulgated the first comprehensive Ottoman constitution (and, except for a Tunisian organic law of 1861, the first in any Islamic country). War with Russia broke out in April 1877 and ended in defeat for the Ottomans. According to the Treaty of San Stefano (March 3, 1878), the Ottomans were to recognize the independence of Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro and cede territory to them, concede autonomy to a new state of Bulgaria, and cede territory to Russia. The parliament summoned in March 1877 was dissolved, and the constitution suspended, in February 1878. The Congress of Berlin (June-July 1878) concluded when England had invaded Cyprus and Austria had taken Bosnia and Herzegovina, whilst France occupied Tunisia in 1881. England took power in Egypt and the province of Eastern Rumelia was subjected to Bulgaria in 1885. The Ottoman territories in Europe were reduced to Macedonia, Albania, and Thrace. Abdülhamit turned for support to the Germans, permitting them in return to build the Baghdad Railway (1899). Eventually, the suppression of the Armenian revolt (1894) and the turmoil in Crete, which led to war with Greece in 1897, once more resulted in intervention by the European powers. The most far-reaching of his reforms were in education. Discontent with his absolutist rule led to the military revolution of the \"Young Turks\" in 1908, forcing Abdülhamit to restore the constitution. After a short-lived reactionary uprising (April 1909), he was deposed and kept in confinement until his death.\n\nAbdülkadir Kemali Pasha (d. 1892), Ottoman official. He was governor of Kosovo (1890-91) and Mosul (1891-92).\n\nAbdulkarim, Yahaya (b. Aug. 21, 1944), governor of Sokoto (1992-93).\n\nAbdülkerim Nadir Pasha, Çirpanli (b. 1807, Zagra, Ottoman Empire [now Stara Zagora, Bulgaria] - d. 1883, Rhodes island, Ottoman Empire [now in Greece]), war minister of the Ottoman Empire (1865-66, 1874-75, 1876). He was also governor of Baghdad (1849-50), Diyarbakir (1851), and Rumelia (1857-59, 1861-64) and navy minister (1876).\n\nAbdulla\n\nAbdulla, Abdul Samad (b. March 10, 1946 - d. Aug. 25, 2013, Singapore), foreign minister of Maldives (2012-13). He was also high commissioner to Bangladesh (2008-09).\n\nAbdulla, Rahmatalla (b. 1922), Sudanese diplomat/politician. He was ambassador to India (1956-60), Nigeria (1960-61), France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain (1962-64, 1968-70), and Zaire (1970-71), minister of national education (1964-65), and permanent representative to the United Nations (1972-74).\n\nAbdullah\n\nAbdullah, Arabic in full `Abd Allah ibn `Abd al-`Aziz Al Sa`ud (b. 1924, Riyadh, Nejd [now in Saudi Arabia] - d. Jan. 23, 2015, Riyadh), king of Saudi Arabia (2005-15); son of Abdul Aziz; half-brother of Fahd. He supported Crown Prince Faysal during Faysal's power struggle with King Saud and was rewarded in 1962 with command of the National Guard, a force nearly as powerful as the Saudi army. He was appointed second deputy minister in 1975 by King Khalid after Faysal's assassination and was named crown prince and first deputy prime minister in 1982 by King Fahd. Following the 1995 stroke that afflicted King Fahd, Abdullah, who continued to command the National Guard, began running the daily affairs of the country. He formally served as regent for a short period in 1996. Though Abdullah was perceived as committed to preserving Arab interests, his goal was also to maintain good relations with the West, especially the U.S. Though Abdullah condemned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by militant Islamists (most of them Saudi nationals) in the U.S., Saudi-U.S. relations reached a low ebb in the first half of 2002. In a move to improve relations, Abdullah launched his proposal for a Saudi peace initiative. It was adopted during the Arab summit meeting held in Beirut, Lebanon, on March 27-28, 2002, as an Arab peace initiative. The plan called upon Israel to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian and Syrian lands and in return promised a full Arab normalization of relations with the Jewish state. However, he publicly refused to support the U.S. attack on Iraq or the use of Saudi military facilities for this purpose. Abdullah is seen as part of the \"reformers\" camp in Saudi Arabia. In September 2002 he called on the religious establishment to be less rigid in order to better serve the populace. He introduced the kingdom's first elections ever - municipal polls held in early 2005. He succeeded as king on Fahd's death later that year.\n\nAbdullah I\n\nAbdullah I, Arabic in full `Abd Allah ibn al-Husayn al-Hashimi (b. 1882, Mecca, Ottoman Empire [now in Saudi Arabia] - d. July 20, 1951, Jerusalem), king of Jordan (1946-51). He was the second son of Hussein ibn Ali, sharif of Mecca. Between 1908 and the outbreak of World War I, he represented Mecca in the Ottoman parliament. Early in 1914 he joined the nationalist Arab movement, and in 1915-16 he played a leading role in clandestine negotiations between the British in Egypt and his father that led to the proclamation (June 10, 1916) of the Arab revolt against the Ottomans. With dubious legality Abdullah was proclaimed king of Iraq on March 8, 1920, by the so-called Iraqi Congress in Damascus. His brother Faysal was proclaimed king of Syria. When the French refused to recognize Faysal's claim, he became king of Iraq instead of Abdullah. Abdullah raised an army, seized control of a railroad leading across Transjordan, and prepared to attack Syria and carve out a realm for himself there. Instead he was persuaded by the British to accept the title of emir of Transjordan, which was gradually separated from the Palestine mandate. The creation of a united Arab kingdom encompassing Syria, Iraq, and Transjordan was Abdullah's ambition. During World War II, he remained a steadfast ally of Britain, and his army - the Arab Legion - took part in the British occupation of Syria and Iraq in 1941. In 1946 Transjordan became independent, and he was crowned king. After the State of Israel was proclaimed, he sent his legion across the border on May 15, 1948, seizing the West Bank and capturing Old Jerusalem. He resisted an Arab League-sponsored government for the Arab-controlled sections of Palestine, and in April 1950 he incorporated them into the kingdom of Jordan. He was assassinated by a Palestinian nationalist.\n\nAbdullah II\n\nAbdullah II, Arabic in full `Abd Allah ibn al-Husayn ibn Talal ibn `Abd Allah al-Hashimi (b. Jan. 30, 1962, Amman, Jordan), king of Jordan (1999- ). He is the son of King Hussein from his second marriage, to Britain's Toni Gardiner (Muna al-Hussein). At the age of 4, he was sent to St. Edmund's School in Surrey, England, but he completed his high school education in the United States. He later took one-year courses in international affairs at Oxford University in England and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Following in his father's footsteps, he graduated (1980) from the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, England. Abdullah served in the British Armed Forces and subsequently served in Jordan's Armed Forces in the 41st and 90th armoured brigades. He was appointed deputy commander of the country's elite Special Forces in 1993 and assumed command a year later. His unit helped quell riots in southern Jordan in 1996 over a sharp increase in bread prices. The prince often was seen in public as a bodyguard for King Hussein. In 1998, Abdullah led his commandos in storming the hideout of gunmen who had killed eight people, including the chargé d'affaires of the Iraqi embassy in Jordan. As a reward, Hussein promoted him to major general. He was named crown prince shortly after he was born, but the king transferred the title to his own brother, Hassan, in April 1965 when he needed help managing the affairs of the state amid regional political turmoil. Abdullah was again given the title in January 1999 in a move that underlined the king's desire to keep the throne in the hands of his sons. In June 1993, Abdullah married Princess Rania, who is a descendant of the wealthy al-Yassin family from the West Bank town of Tulkarem. They have a son, Hussein (b. 1994), and two daughters, Iman (b. 1996) and Salma (b. 2000).\n\nA. Abdullah\n\nAbdullah, Abdullah1 (b. September 1960, Kabul, Afghanistan), foreign minister (2001-06), chief executive (2014-20), and self-proclaimed president (2020) of Afghanistan. He was a presidential candidate in 2009, 2014, and 2019.\n\n1 Originally he had just one name, Abdullah, but by 1997 he had started using Abdullah Abdullah.\n\nAbdullah, Ahmed Suleiman (Somali Axmed Suleymaan Cabdalla), byname Dafle, interior minister of Somalia (1984-87, 1989-90); son-in-law of Muhammad Siad Barre. He was also chief of the National Security Service (1980-81), minister of planning (1982-84) and security and social affairs (1987-89), and a deputy prime minister (1987-89).\n\nF. Abdullah\n\nAbdullah, Farooq (b. Oct. 21, 1936, Soura, Kashmir), Kashmiri politician. Leader of the main pro-India party, the National Conference, Abdullah comes from the family which has held sway over Kashmiri politics since the region acceded to India in 1947. His father, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, was a dominant force in the region for half a century, serving first as state prime minister, then later as chief minister before his death in 1982. Farooq was chief minister in 1982-84 and again from 1986 to 1990 when a separatist rebellion drove him from power. A golf enthusiast, he has been criticized for spending time overseas, especially in London. But polls showed the tall, silver-haired Abdullah was by far the best-known figure in state politics and he was chief minister again in 1996-2002. A moderate accused by critics of being indecisive, he advocated the restoration of political autonomy which his party claimed New Delhi had gradually usurped since 1952.\n\nH.S. Abdullah\n\nAbdullah, Hisham Sharaf (b. 1956, Taiz, Yemen), foreign minister of Yemen (2016- ). He was also minister of industry and trade (2011), oil and minerals (2011-12), and higher education and scientific research (2012-15).\n\nAbdullah, Ismeth (b. Sept. 29, 1946, Cirebon, Jawa Barat, Indonesia), acting governor (2004-05) and governor (2005-10) of Kepulauan Riau.\n\nS.M. Abdullah\n\nAbdullah, Sheikh Mohammad, byname Lion of Kashmir (b. Dec. 5, 1905, Soura, near Srinagar, Kashmir - d. Sept. 8, 1982, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir), prime minister (1948-53) and chief minister (1975-77, 1977-82) of Jammu and Kashmir. When on July 13, 1931, the army fired on a demonstration of Muslim protesters and 14 demonstrators were killed, Abdullah immediately organized a group of young Muslim intellectuals called the Muslim (later National) Conference. At first it served as little more than an agency through which skilled Muslims tried to get jobs. But soon they realized that political action was the only means to their end. Muslims were a majority in Kashmir but were discriminated against by the Hindu ruling house. In 1947, when India and Pakistan both sought Kashmir at the time of independence from Britain, Abdullah turned to India after an attack by Muslim tribesmen from Pakistan. Despite his early support for Indian leader Jawaharlal Nehru, in 1953 he was dismissed as prime minister and imprisoned. The state's population had become restless and was demanding accession to Pakistan. Abdullah began to espouse independence and accused India of reneging on its promise to hold a plebiscite on the state's future. He spent the next 15 years in and out of jail, under house arrest, or in exile. From 1968 his Plebiscite Front gained some successes but lost to the Congress party in 1972 elections. He came to a rapprochement with Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi and returned to political office as chief minister in 1975, a post he held until his death. His government was accused of corruption but, though his popularity waned, he was still admired for his outstanding contribution to the cause of Kashmiri national rights.\n\nO.

The grandson of a respected Islamic leader and son of a United Malays National Organization (UMNO) stalwart, Abdullah joined Malaysia's civil service in 1964. In 1978, he was elected as a member of parliament the same year. He began his career in the government as parliamentary secretary in the federal territory ministry. He was subsequently promoted to deputy in the same ministry in 1980. His rise began a year later when he was appointed UMNO liaison chief for Penang state. He joined the ranks of the UMNO Supreme Council elite the same year and was given the portfolio of minister in the Prime Minister's Department. In May 1984, he was elected UMNO vice president and was appointed education minister two months later. He went on to become defense minister in 1986. He was dropped from the cabinet in 1987 after supporting Razaleigh Hamzah's challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad's UMNO presidency that split the party in two. But Abdullah returned to the UMNO fold the following year, professing his loyalty to Mahathir, and was reelected UMNO vice president in 1990 and named foreign minister in 1991. He earned the tag of \"Mr. Clean\" for his straightforward approach to politics. He saw mixed fortunes in 1993 as he was again appointed member of the UMNO Supreme Council but dethroned as party vice president by a team closely aligned with Anwar Ibrahim and which included Najib Tun Razak. Abdullah regained the vice-presidency in 1996. In January 1999 Mahathir made him deputy prime minister and home affairs minister in a clear signal of support. In June 2002 he was designated to succeed Mahathir. After becoming prime minister, he also took over the finance ministry from Mahathir (until 2008), and kept the home portfolio (until 2004); in 2008-09 he held again the defense portfolio.

Sept. 7, 1953, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister of Japan (1939-40) and governor-general of Korea (1944-45). He remained aloof from politics until after his retirement from the army in 1936 with the rank of general. In August 1939 he accepted the emperor's command to form a government following the resignation of Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma. His qualities for the post seemed to be purely negative, and his main commendation that he was in a position to work with the army, which was then predominant. Though he had never seen active service, he had a thorough knowledge of the workings of the military machine. He pursued a policy of seeking settlement with both the Soviet Union and the western countries, while trying to create a puppet regime in China. The policy led to the signing of an armistice with the Soviet Union bringing to an end a long series of conflicts along the borders of Manchukuo and Mongolia, and also to the opening of negotiations with the United States for the resurrection of a trade treaty. In December 1939 he was criticized for the rising prices of rice and fuel. Early in 1940, 276 out of 448 members of parliament signed a declaration of lack of confidence in his administration. The army chiefs, though they would have had the power if they had wished, were not prepared to shoulder the burden of an unpopular ministry, feeling that their \"national policy\" in China needed the support of a government with parliamentary backing. Hence the administration of his successor, Adm. Mitsumasa Yonai, included two party men. At the end of World War II Abe was governor-general of Korea and he surrendered the territory to the Allies in September 1945.\n\nAbe, Shintaro (b. April 29, 1924, Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan - d. May 15, 1991, Tokyo, Japan), Japanese politician; great-grandson of Yoshimasa Oshima. At one time he had ambitions to become a kamikaze pilot, but World War II ended before he could be trained. He launched his political career in 1956 by becoming private secretary to Nobusuke Kishi, who was his father-in-law and the foreign minister; Abe remained in the post when Kishi became prime minister in 1957. In 1958 Abe was elected to the first of 11 terms in the House of Representatives. The \"prince of politics\" held a succession of cabinet posts - minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (1974-76); chief cabinet secretary (1977-78); minister of international trade and industry (1981-82); and foreign minister (1982-86; one of the longest tenures in that post in Japan). He twice lost in bids to win the presidency of the LDP, first to Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1982 and then to Noboru Takeshita in 1987; a victory would have automatically given him the prime ministership. Abe was a top contender to succeed Nakasone as prime minister in 1987 until he stepped aside for Takeshita. He was named secretary-gene"
