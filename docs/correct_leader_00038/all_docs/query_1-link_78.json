The Mayor of Genoa welcomes <strong>MYBA</strong> 2012 Partecipants Marta vicenzi Mayor of Genoa On behalf of the city of Genoa, I am delighted and honoured to salute the 24th <strong>MYBA</strong> <strong>Charter</strong> <strong>Show</strong>, whose importance is witnessed by the growing appreciation among exhibitors and visitors. I would like to thank the <strong>MYBA</strong> Association as well as Pesto Sea Group, Marina Molo vecchio and the Associazione Agenti raccomandatari mediatori marittimi of Genoa for the organisation. The City of Genoa has been hosting this important event since 2001 with great success. I am proud of the role that Genoa has been able to keep along these years.In the last administrative course the Municipality has attributed particular importance to accomplishing Genoa’s makeover. I think it is necessary to increase and reorganize the port facilities on a grand scale, and to redefine the equilibrium between urban organism and port. This is the reason why we have worked out a new general town planning scheme supported by the great architect Renzo Piano’s waterfront project. let me take this opportunity to warmly welcome you to Genoa, nominated a unesco World Heritage site. In my capacity as the city Mayor I would like to thank you very much for being here and wish you all the best for the forthcoming event.
