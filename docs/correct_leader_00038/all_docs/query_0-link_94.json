        "text": "Now that the Netherlands has decided to contribute six F-16s to the US-led coalition against IS in Iraq (but not Syria), it seems an opportune moment to revisit this earlier study of the US-Dutch fall-out over the 2003 Iraq war and its aftermath.\n\nThis article deals, drawing on newly available declassified documents, with the efforts of Czechoslovak intelligence services to prevent deployments of new intermediate nuclear forces on the territory of some European North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states, planned by the NATO Dual Track Decision of December 1979. Attention is paid to goals of Czechoslovak intelligence in Western Europe, their perception of threats posed by NATO, and methods used to torpedo the NATO plan. The article concludes that despite the fact that Czechoslovak intelligence faced many challenges when carrying out active measures, its capability to target and infiltrate various organisations and movements was not negligible."
