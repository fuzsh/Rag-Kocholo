It is said the houses of the richest merchants had golden doorknobs and marble doorsteps.\n\nMen zegt dat de huizen van de rijkste kooplieden gouden deurknoppen hadden, en stoepen van marmer. Every year more ships docked in the harbor, and people came from near and far looking for work and a better life.\n\nElk jaar legden er meer schepen aan in de haven, en van heinde en verre kwamen er mensen naar toe, op zoek naar werk en een beter leven. 2 One of the wealthiest people in town was a woman who always wanted the best of everything.\n\nEen van de rijkste inwoners was een vrouw voor wie alleen het beste goed genoeg was. One day she called in her most trusted captain.\n\nOp een dag riep ze haar meest vertrouwde kapitein bij zich. \"Right now, they're loading your ship with gold,\" she said, \"and I want you to buy the most expensive item in the world, so everyone in town will know how wealthy I am.\n\n\"Ik laat je schip volladen met goud,\" zei ze, \"en ik wil dat je voor mij het kostbaarste koopt dat er op de wereld bestaat, om iedereen in de stad te laten zien hoe rijk ik ben. \"The most valuable item in the world - not a few random nice things for my house, but really that one thing that is the most expensive.\"\n\n\"Het meest waardevolle dat er op de wereld is - niet hier en daar iets leuks om mijn huis mooier te maken, maar echt dat ene ding dat het duurste is.\" The captain sailed the seven seas to all ports he knew and saw many beautiful things.\n\nDe kapitein voer over de zeven zeeën naar alle havens die hij kende en zag veel mooie dingen. He visited craftsmen that had exotic wood furniture, wood carving and ivory, tailors that had beautiful clothes of silk and velvet, and gold- and silversmiths that had jewelry with pearls and diamonds.\n\nHij bezocht handwerkslieden met meubels van zeldzaam hout, houtsnijwerk en ivoor, kleermakers met prachtige kleren van zijde en fluweel, en edelsmeden met schitterende sieraden van goud en zilver met parels en diamanten. 2 Painters, sculptors and dealers showed him artworks, but he kept asking himself, is this really the most valuable on earth? Is this what the Lady wants?\n\nSchilders, beeldhouwers en handelaren lieten hem kunstwerken zien, maar steeds weer vroeg hij zich af: Is dit echt het meest kostbare dat er is op aarde? Is dit wat de Vrouwe wil hebben? Looking at the gold bars in the ship's hold, he started to wonder what actually was more beautiful than gold itself: What is of more value?\n\nAls hij in het ruim van het schip naar de opgestapelde baren goud ging kijken, begon hij zich af te vragen wat er eigenlijk mooier was dan goud zelf: Wat is van meer waarde? 2 He kept on searching for a while, but couldn't find the one item that was without doubt the most valuable on earth, and he felt there was other way than to return home empty-handed.\n\nHij zocht nog een tijd verder, maar vond niet iets dat zonder twijfel het meest kostbare op aarde was, en hij zag geen andere mogelijkheid dan onverrichter zake naar huis terug te keren. \"What's more beautiful than gold itself?\" was what he would tell the lady.\n\n\"Wat is mooier dan goud zelf?\" zou hij de vrouwe zeggen. But sailing along the Baltic coast he saw the ripening grain on the fields ripple in the wind, and then understood this was what he had been looking for all along.\n\nMaar op de kust van de Oostzee zag hij vanaf het schip in het glooiende land het rijpende graan op de velden wuiven in de wind, en toen begreep hij dat dit het was wat hij al die tijd gezocht had. The harbor lookout sent a boy into town when he saw the ship approaching.\n\nDe uitkijk bij de haven stuurde een jongen het stadje in toen hij het schip aan zag komen. Soon, half the town was waiting on the quay.\n\nAl gauw stond de halve bevolking van het stadje op de kade. \"Skipper, what are you bringing me?\" the lady of Stavoren said.\n\n\"Schipper, wat heb je voor me meegenomen,\" zei het vrouwtje van Stavoren. The skipper pulled a handful of wheat from a pocket of his coat.\n\nDe schipper haalde een handvol graankorrels uit een zak van z'n jasje. \"The golden grain - there is nothing more precious on earth - for what is more important than our daily bread, the staff of life?\"\n\n\"Het gouden graan - het waardevolste op aarde - want wat is belangrijker dan ons dagelijks brood?\" For a moment, the woman looked at him incredulously, and then she became very angry. \"You idiot,\" she cried, \"Throw it overboard.\"\n\nDe vrouw keek hem even aan alsof ze het niet kon geloven en barstte toen in woede uit.\n\n\"Idioot,\" schreeuwde ze, \"Gooi het overboord.\" \"No, no!\" the harbor master quickly said. \"We don't throw things overboard in the harbor.\"\n\n\"Nee, nee,\" zei de havenmeester snel, \"We kunnen geen dingen overboord gooien in de haven.\" \"Then leave port and throw it into the sea,\" the woman said.\n\n\"Vaar dan uit en gooi het in zee,\" zei de vrouw. \"But Ma'am, can't we give it to the poor?\" the captain asked\n\n\"Mevrouw, kunnen we het niet aan de armen geven?\" vroeg de kapitein. \"No,\" the woman said, \"Throw it into the sea.\"\n\n\"Nee,\" zei de vrouw, \"Gooi het in zee.\" 2 \"But imagine that you'd be poor yourself,\" the captain said.\n\n\"Maar stelt U zich eens voor dat U zelf arm zou zijn,\" zei de kapitein. The woman took a ring with a large diamond from a finger and angrily threw it far away into the water. \"It's more likely that I'll see that ring back than that I'd ever be poor,\" she said.\n\nDe vrouw nam een ring met een grote edelsteen van een vinger en gooide hem woedend ver weg het het water in. \"Ik zal nog eerder die ring terugzien dan dat ik ooit arm zou worden.\" A few days later there was a frightening shriek from the kitchen of the lady of Stavoren, and a cook was running through the house, \"Ma'am, Ma'm ... I was cleaning fish ... your ring ... in the belly of a fish.\"\n\nEen paar dagen later klonk er een ijselijke gil uit de keuken van het vrouwtje van Stavoren en een kokkin rende door het huis, \"Mevrouw, mevrouw ... ik was vissen aan het schoonmaken ... Uw ring ... in de buik van een vis.\" 2 Over the next weeks, skippers said that where the grain had been dumped the water was turning greenish. Was the grain sprouting?\n\nIn de weken daarna zeiden schippers dat waar het graan gestort was het water een beetje groen leek. Begon het graan te ontkiemen? A sandbank developed, and it was getting more and more difficult for ships to enter the harbor.\n\nEr vormde zich een zandbank, en het werd steeds moeilijker voor schepen om de haven binnen te komen. After a few years, only small ships put into port anymore.\n\nNa een paar jaar kwamen er alleen nog kleine schepen. The great merchants and many of the harbor workets left, the golden doorknobs disappeared and it became very quiet.\n\nDe grote handelaren en veel van de havenwerkers vertrokken naar elders, de gouden deurknoppen verdwenen en het werd er heel rustig. The Lady of Stavoren didn't leave. She still wandered around town for years, dressed in black.\n\nHet vrouwtje van Stavoren ging niet weg. Ze dwaalde nog jaren door het stadje, geheel in het zwart gekleed.\n\nGeef ons heden ons dagelijks brood Give us this day our daily bread >> The Lord's Prayer\n\nhet gouden graan 2\n\n'n brood\n\nStavoren in The Netherlands\n\nVerbs: The Passive Voice\n\nAs I've said before, I am not a grammarian, and don't plan to become one. In these lessons I'm just trying to explain structures to people who want to learn a little Dutch. Grammatical terms are used in a loose sense. (>> Dutch grammar words)\n\nIn the passive form (lijdende vorm ) the object is passively subjected to an activity: The book is read. or The house was built. In Dutch, the passive form uses the auxiliary verb 'worden' with a past participle - English uses 'to be' and that may be a bit confusing.\n\nactive: Ik verf het huis ('I'm painting the house')\n\npassive: Het huis wordt geverfd ('The house is being painted')\n\npassive: Het huis wordt door mij geverfd ('The house is being painted by me')\n\npassive: Ik word geschopt door Jan ('I am kicked by John')\n\nik word\n\njij wordt\n\nhij wordt\n\nwij worden\n\njullie worden\n\nzij worden\n\nU wordt\n\n(I am)\n\n(you are)\n\n(he is)\n\n(we are)\n\n(you are)\n\n(they are)\n\n(you are)\n\nword ik?\n\nword jij?\n\nwordt hij?\n\nworden wij?\n\nworden jullie?\n\nworden zij?\n\nwordt U?\n\n(am I?)\n\n(are you?)\n\n(is he?)\n\n(are we?)\n\n(are you?)\n\n(are they?)\n\n(are you?)\n\nik werd\n\njij werd\n\nhij werd\n\nwij werden\n\njullie werden\n\nzij werden\n\nU werd\n\n(I was)\n\n(you were)\n\n(he was)\n\n(we were)\n\n(you were)\n\n(they were)\n\n(you were)\n\n(you - singular, informal)\n\n(you - plural, informal)\n\n(you - polite)\n\nDo note that word and wordt are pronounced exactly the same. D at the end of a word is pronounced as T and 'double' consonants are rarely pronounced with a pause in between. ik word 2 hij wordt 2\n\nIk word gevraagd 2 ('I am asked')\n\nIk werd gevraagd 2 ('I was asked')\n\nHij werd gemarteld 2 ('he was tortured')\n\nDe bal wordt geschopt ('the ball is kicked')\n\nDe bal werd geschopt 2 ('the ball was kicked')\n\nDe bal werd door Jan in het doel geschopt 2 ('The ball was kicked into the goal by Jan')\n\nDe bal wordt in het doel geschoten 2 ('The ball is shot into the goal')\n\nEr wordt gebeld 2 ('the bell is rung' - there is someone at the door)\n\nAn often-heard complaint is:\n\n\"Ik word geleefd.\" [I am lived] ~ 'I have no life of my own.'\n\nThe perfect tense of the passive voice uses 'zijn' (to be) - and (unlike in German) the past participle geworden 2 is usually dropped:\n\nhet huis wordt geverfd ('the house is being painted')\n\nhet huis is geverfd geworden ('the house has been painted')\n\nIk ben geschopt geworden ('I have been kicked')\n\nIk ben gevraagd geworden 2 ('I have been asked' - to perform a task, or fill a position or job)\n\nNot to be confused with:\n\nIk heb gevraagd 2 ('I have asked' - I have put a question)\n\nIk heb gegeten ('I have eaten')\n\nThe ghost of a cow or pig could say:\n\nIk ben gegeten geworden ('I was eaten')\n\nEnglish uses 'to be' for the passive form. Confusion may arise because Dutch uses 'zijn' (to be) as the auxiliary verb for the perfect tense of some verbs.\n\nNote the different use of 'is' in English and Dutch in the following sentences:\n\nHij wordt door een wesp gestoken! ('He is being stung by a wasp' - right this moment)\n\nHij is door een wesp gestoken geworden ('He has been stung by a wasp' - some time ago)\n\nIk werd afgeleid 2 (I was distracted)\n\n'Worden' is also used in the sense of 'to become,' and in that meaning the past participle geworden 2 does appear, when appropriate:\n\nWat is er van hem geworden? 2 ('Whatever became of him?')\n\n\"Wat wil je later worden?\" ('What do you want to be when you grow up?')\n\n't Wordt donker ('It is getting dark')\n\n<< previous - verbs central - next >>\n\nWord Order (2)\n\nBasic Sentences The Complement The Object The Indirect Object\n\nCombining Object and Complement Simple Questions\n\nprevious: placement of adjectives\n\nsmartphone version of word order (narrow pages)\n\nanother approach: Differences between Dutch and English Word Order\n\nSimple, Basic Sentences\n\nVery simple sentences can just be a subject (onderwerp ) and a verb (werkwoord ) in that order - very much like in English.\n\nsubject verb\n\nHet and its abbreviated form 't can mean It - like in 't Regent , or it can be the article (the - next to de). When apostrophe-T 't is the first word of a sentence, the second word is capitalized.\n\nAs you can see in some of the examples, Dutch often just has a simple verb where English uses the continuous (is ...-ing.) A later lesson will show a Dutch grammar figure to indicate ongoing activity. >>\n\nAdding A Complement\n\nTo make a statement more interesting and/or informative, add something like an adverb. Some grammarians call this part of the sentence a complement.\n\nsubject verb complement\n\nAdding Objects\n\nA sentence can be more meaningful when an object is added to the subject and verb.\n\nsubject verb object\n\nThe Indirect Object\n\nActually, there are two kinds of objects. The most common, and the one in the examples above, is called the 'direct object' in English, and in Dutch (often fittingly) lijdend voorwerp ('suffering entity/object.')\n\nThe second class of objects is called the 'indirect object' in English, and meewerkend voorwerp ('cooperating entity/object') in Dutch. It's usually found in sentences with verbs like 'to give' (geven 2), 'to say' (zeggen ) and 'to tell' (vertellen ), that describe someone receiving something. Its usual position is right after the verb, before the direct object.\n\nsubject verb indirect object direct object\n\nJan geeft Piet een boek. Jan gives Piet a book. Karel geeft Elly een ring. Karel gives [Elly a ring] a ring to Elly. (ring for finger) Het geeft de mensen hoop. It gives the people hope. Ik vertel je de waarheid. I'm telling you the truth. Het is mij een genoegen .... [It is a pleasure to me ...] It is with pleasure that I ... Ik geef Marietje bloemen. I'm giving Marietje flowers.\n\nYou may find the indirect object preceded by prepositions like 'for' or 'to' - but then both Dutch and English place it after the direct object.\n\nsubject verb direct object indirect object with preposition\n\nJan geeft een boek aan Piet Jan gives a book to Piet. Ik geef bloemen aan Marietje I'm giving flowers to Marietje. Zij zingen een lied voor mij. 2 They are singing a song for me.\n\nDo note that zij and ze can mean both 'she' and 'they' - but you can tell the difference because the verb form is different for plural and singular:\n\nZij zingt een lied. She is singing a song.\n\nCombining Object and Complement\n\nIf there is both a 'complement' and an object, the object ususally comes first, right after the verb, like in English.\n\nsubject verb object complement\n\nHij schopt de bal hard. He kicks the ball hard. (?) Hij schopt de bal heel hard. He kicks the ball very hard. (?) Hij verft het houten huis wit. 2 He is painting the wooden house white. Ik kende die mensen goed. 2 I knew those people well. Hij bedoelt 't goed. 2 He means [it] well. Hij verfde het huis snel 2 He quickly painted the house, he painted the house quickly.\n\nBut unfortunately it's not always as straightforward as in English.\n\nIn the examples above, the object has the definite article (de/het) but in the examples below, where the complement is put before the object, the object doesn't have the definite article but the indefinite article (een, 'n,) no article or a number -- though that does not cover all examples.\n\nYou'll notice the use of the article is not exactly the same in English as in Dutch.\n\nHij speelt heel goed gitaar. 2 He plays the guitar very well. Ik gaf haar snel een knipoogje. I quickly [gave her a wink] winked at her. Hij vertelde ons snel een paar mopjes. 2 He quickly told us a few jokes. Hij drinkt snel een biertje. 2 He is quickly drinking a beer, he quickly has a beer. Hij maakte snel twee kistjes 2 3 He quickly built 2 small boxes Hij berekende het verschil snel 2 He calculated the difference quickly Hij berekende snel het verschil 2 He quickly calculated the difference There is a slight difference in meaning in the last two examples. 'Hij berekende het verschil snel' is a stand-alone remark indicating the subject is a clever or competent person; while 'Hij berekende snel het verschil' implies 'he' is in a hurry and you expect another statement on why the rush or what 'he' did next.\n\nIn the examples above, only the similar 'Hij verfde het huis snel' can be turned around like that and still be good Dutch. exception?\n\nHonger maakt rauwe bonen zoet 2 3 Hunger makes raw beans [taste] sweet. I moved the line below from the unexplained exception group above because 'goed' is an adjective - though translated into English as the adverb 'well' Je spreekt goed Nederlands. 2 You speak Dutch well. Hij spreekt goed Nederlands 2 3 He speaks Dutch well Hij spreekt geheel onverwacht toch heel goed Nederlands 2 3 4 He quite unexpectedly speaks Dutch very well in case you were wondering: Hij speelt op een dure gitaar 2 3 He plays an expensive guitar\n\nIt's maybe not very important, not many sentences are like this, but to say 'Hij speelt gitaar goed' or 'Je spreekt Nederlands goed' is not good Dutch.\n\nQuestion Mode (simple sentences)\n\nTurn the verb and subject around to make a statement sentence into a question.\n\nIn speaking, the sentence melody changes to a higher pitch at the end:\n\nEr is wat brood over. ('There is some bread left.')\n\nIs er wat brood over? ('Is there any bread left?')\n\nexaggerated: Is er wat brood over?\n\nWhen talking with friends and acquaintances, you'll use the informal 'je' or 'jij.' Do note that in the present tense for those words (the second person singular, informal) the T is dropped from the verb when it comes before the personal pronoun:\n\nverb subject (object) (complement)\n\n<< previous - word order central - next >>\n\nAmbiguous\n\nThe following Dutch sentence is a rare example of confusion between subject and object:\n\nHet land dat God vergat. It could mean either:\n\nThe country that God forgot. (The country forgotten by God.) or:\n\nThe country that forgot God.\n\nMetric and Imperial: Weight\n\nounces to grams (g)\n\n1 ounce = 28.35 grams 1 gram = 0.035 ounces\n\n16 ounces = 1 pound = 453 grams = 0.453 kilograms 1 kilogram = 1000 grams = 2.205 pounds = 35.27 ounces\n\npounds to kilograms (kg)\n\n1 pound = 0.453 kilograms 1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds\n\nThe old English weight stone (14 Lb) is 6.35 kg more dimensions\n\n(het) gewicht ('weight') (de) massa 2 ('mass')\n\n(het) milligram 2\n\n1mg = 1/1000 g (de/het) gram\n\ng (de) kilogram 2 = (de/het) kilo 2\n\n1 kg = 1000 g (de) ton\n\n(1 ton = 1000 kilograms)\n\nIn Dutch, the units of measure are rarely used in the plural (except in time.)\n\n1 kilo, 2 kilo 2 - 500 gram 2\n\npond (500 grams, about 1 pound) ons 2 (100 grams, about 3 ounces) Though widely used, pond and ons are not official weights.\n\nEen ons ham 2 3 ('100 grams, about 3 ounces of ham')\n\nEen pond kaas 2 ('500 grams, about a pound of cheese')\n\nElk pondje gaat door 't mondje.

The 150-seat 'Second Chamber' (De Tweede Kamer 2) is comparable to the US House of Representatives or the UK House of Commons. Governments need to have the support of a majority in the Second Chamber.\n\nNext to the 'Second Chamber' is de Eerste Kamer ('The First Chamber,') also called de Senaat 2, somewhat like the English House of Lords, but (even relatively speaking) far less powerful than the American Senate. It is indirectly chosen, by the Province Representatives, and membership is not a full-time job. Laws are discussed and voted on in the Second Chamber, and then passed on to the First Chamber for approval; the First Chamber only votes on laws, and cannot propose or amend laws. In a famous case in the early 1970s, the delegates of the (so-called) 'liberal' party VVD in the First Chamber voted against a liberal abortion law, showing that their party is really not liberal but conservative.\n\n(de) abortus 2 abortion\n\nHolland does not have a district system where the majority in a district chooses the delegate and the minority is not represented. All the votes count towards national totals. There are 150 seats in the Second Chamber, so 0.67% of the national vote means one seat. Turnout for the national elections is usually between 70 and 80%, and one seat requires about 65.000 votes. Parties representing small groups in Dutch society usually have a few seats in the Second Chamber.\n\nAfter elections, the queen used to consult with the party leaders and appoint an informateur 2 (usually an elder politician) to find common ground and explore possible compromises between parties, to create a coalition that will have a majority in the Second Chamber - but now the queen will no longer be involved with the process. Instead, the outgoing Second Chamber appoints a verkenner ('scout') to start the consultations, and the new 'Second Chamber' appoints one or more informateurs.\n\nA concept program for the next government may be prepared: (het) regeerakkoord 2. Next, a formateur 2 will be appointed, usually the next prime minister: (de) premier /or/ (de) minister-president 2, who will form a cabinet (het) kabinet 2, his team of ministers and secretaries. Occasionally, a coalition falls apart, and then usually new elections will be called.\n\nIn the 1977 elections, labor PvdA gained 10 seats, for a total of 53 seats, its best result ever. Christian-Democrat CDA won 49 seats, and the conservative VVD 28. A Labor-led government was expected, but the concessions demanded by Christian-Democrat leader Dries van Agt 2 were unacceptable to the Labor party, though party leader Joop den Uyl 2 was willing to go ahead with Van Agt. In the end the Christian-Democrats formed a government coalition with the conservative party. Sad, but not undemocratic.\n\nThe 2010-2012 coalition government of Conservatives and Christian-Democrats was supported by Mr Wilders' party, who did not have ministers in the cabinet. This support is called (de) gedoogsteun\n\n(de) partij ('political party') - plural: partijen\n\n(de) meerderheid 2 ('majority')\n\n(de) regering ('the government, the cabinet')\n\n(de) oppositie 2 3 the political parties in parliament opposed to the government\n\n(de) stembus ('ballot box') - stemmen 2 ('to vote') the complete verb\n\n\"Heb je al gestemd?\" 2 'Did you vote already?'\n\n\"Ik heb nog niet gestemd.\" 'I have not voted yet.'\n\n\"Wie heeft de verkiezingen gewonnen?\" 'Who has won the elections?'\n\nParty Name, Party Leader, Position - website number of seats 199820022003 20062010201220172021 2023 Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie (VVD) Dilan Yesilgöz\n\nconservative - >> 3824 282231 41 33 35 24 Partij van de Arbeid (PvdA) 2 Lilianne Ploumen 2\n\nlabor - >> 4523 423230 38 9 9 ~ PvdA/GroenLinks Frenske Timmermans 2 (Frans 2)\n\n25 Partij voor de Vrijheid Geert Wilders 2\n\nright-wing, concerned about extremist tendencies in Islam - >> -- -924 15 20 17 37 Socialistische Partij 2 Lilian Marijnissen 2\n\nleft-wing, maoist, grassroots; has never been in government - >> 59 92615 15 14 9 5 Christen-Democratisch Appèl (CDA) 2 Henri Bontenbal 2 3\n\nchristian-democrats, centrist - >> 2943 444121 1319 15 5 D66 - Democraten '66 2 Rob Jetten\n\nused to be left-wing liberals - >> 147 6310 12 19 23 9 Christen Unie 2 Mirjam Bikker 2 3 4 5\n\nchristian, mixed on left/right - >> (5)4 365 5 5 5 3 Groen Links Jesse Klaver 2 (3) - de Jessias 2\n\nleft-wing, environmentalist - >> 1110 8710 4 14 8 ~ Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij (SGP) Chris Stoffer 2 3\n\nKees van der Staaij orthodox protestant - >> 32 222 3 3 3 3 Partij voor de Dieren Esther Ouwehand 2 3\n\nanimal rights - >> -- -22 2 5 6 3 50+ ('Vijftig Plus') 2 Liane den Haan 2\n\nseniors, pensioners - >> -- --- 2 4 1 - Denk 2 3 ‑>> Stephan van Baarle 2\n\nTurkish, Muslim - >> -- --- - 3 3 3 Forum voor Democratie 2 3 Thierry Baudet 2 3\n\nright-wing - >> -- --- - 2 8 3 JA21 2 3 Joost Eerdmans 2\n\nAnnabel Nanninga 2 right-wing - >> -- --- - - 3 1 Volt 2 Laurens Dassen 2 3\n\nEuropean Union - >> -- --- - - 3 2 BoerBurgerBeweging 2 (BBB 2) Caroline van der Plas 2\n\n'the voice of the countryside' - >> -- --- - - 1 7 Bij1 2 3 Sylvana Simons 2 3\n\nanti-racism - >> -- --- - - 1 - Fortuyn 2 Pim Fortuyn 2 (2002) Olaf Stuger (2003)\n\nright-wing -26 8-- - -- others -2 --- - - - Nieuw Sociaal Contract 2 3 NSC 2 Pieter Omtzigt 2 3\n\n- >> -- --- - - - 20 _______________ ______ ___ ___ 150150 150150150 150 150 150 150 more: election results over the years - Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (The Dutch Statistics Office)\n\nDick Schoof 2 3 prime minister 2024- (no party affiliation)\n\nRetired or Deceased Recent Party Leaders:\n\nVVD: Mark Rutte\n\nPvdA: Ronald Plasterk 2 - Lodewijk Asscher 2 - Job Cohen 2 (PvdA) - Diederik Samsom 2\n\nPvdA/GroenLinks: Frenske Timmermans 2 (Frans 2)\n\nD66: Sigrid Kaag 2 3 4 - Alexander Pechtold\n\nCDA: Hans Huibers 2 - Wopke Hoekstra 2\n\nSybrand Buma 2 (Sybrand van Haersma Buma 2)\n\n- Maxime Verhagen 2 - Jan-Pieter Balkenende 2 3\n\nSocialistische Partij: Emile Roemer - Jan Marijnissen\n\nGroen Links: Femke Halsema - Jolande Sap 2 - Bram van Ojik 2\n\nChristen Unie: André Rouvoet - Arie Slob 2 - Gert-Jan Segers 2\n\nPartij voor de Dieren: Marianne Thieme\n\n50+: Henk Krol 2 (left party)\n\nThe three mainstream Christian parties:\n\n(de) Katholieke Volkspartij (KVP) 2 ('katholiek' Roman catholic)\n\n(de) Anti-Revolutionaire Partij (ARP) 2 ('gereformeerd' somewhat strict protestant)\n\n(de) Christelijk-Historische Unie (CHU) 2 ('hervormd' somewhat less strict protestant)\n\nentered the 1977 elections with one list of candidates, and formally became one party in 1980, (het) Christen-Democratisch Appèl (CDA) 2.\n\nFrom 1918 till the 1990s, those Christian parties had taken part in every government, in coalitions with either labor or the conservatives (occasionally one of the original three parties stayed out); but in the 1990s there were two paars (paars/paarse 2 - 'purple') cabinets of labor and conservatives, without the Christian Democrats.\n\nThe great changes in support for the traditional parties and the emergence of new parties in recent elections show that the voters are unhappy and looking for new answers. The upheavals of the late 1960s resulted in two new parties, de Boerenpartij 2 (\"the peasants' party\") led by Boer Koekoek 2 of Bennekom who one year got 8 seats in parliament, but the party broke up quickly. D'66 was a more serious party with new ideas like referendums and elected majors, and is still represented in parliament.\n\nBefore the 2002 elections, many people were hoping Pim Fortuyn 2 would bring a new style and fresh ideas to Dutch politics. The country was shocked when two weeks before the elections he was murdered (by an animal-rights activist) - Holland's first political assassination in more than 300 years. His party won big, but lacked a leader and fell apart. Mr. Fortuyn would probably have brought great changes to Dutch politics. (Two years later, film maker Theo van Gogh was murdered by an islamist.)\n\nThe 17th-Century Dutch Republic was not a democracy. In 1581 the Dutch revolutionaries stated their reasons for leaving the rule of the King of Spain in a document called het Plakkaat van Verlatinghe 2 - also called de Acte van Verlatinghe ('the Act of Abjuration.') It said the king should be to his people like a father to his children, but the Spanish king had turned into a tyrant. The declaration also stated that ultimately power belonged to local authorities, not to the king - a step in the right direction. Those local authorites were the city rulers, mostly families long-serving in government. Some rich merchants and leaders of the revolution joined the ruling class; nobility only played a very small role after the Middle Ages. The descendants of the leader of the Dutch revolution William of Orange (Willem van Oranje nicknamed Willem de Zwijger 'William The Silent') had the title of stadhouder - something like a heriditary presidency. Some of their opponents lost their lives in power struggles. Only after the French occupation (1795-1813) did the Orange-Nassau family become the royal rulers of the Netherlands, but already during that 19th century reformers like Thorbecke greatly reduced the King's power, and Holland became a parliamentary democracy. Presently, the only practical power the queen has is her role in the formation of government coalitions and in the appointments of high civil servants and military officers.\n\nThe first government elections in Holland were early in the 19th Century, and like in the early days of the US, only a small percentage of the male population was considered qualified to vote, measured by education level and tax payments. In the 1890s, 50% of Dutch male citizens voted, in 1917 all male Dutchmen and in 1919 all Dutch women were given the right to vote in elections. Actually, until the 1960s, voting was not just a right: (het) stemrecht 2 - but a duty: (de) stemplicht - failure to vote was punishable by a fine. Only citizens can vote in Dutch national elections, but foreigners may vote in City elections after five years' legal residency.\n\nThe formal meeting hall of the Dutch parliament\n\nDe Ridderzaal 2 (\"the knights' hall\") on het Binnenhof 2 ('the inner court') in Den Haag 2 ('The Hague')\n\npainting by Billy Eric © 2010 all rights reserved\n\nOn the third Tuesday in September, the queen presents the government's plans for the next year (de) miljoenennota 2 (mostly financing and spending) in a speech called (de) troonrede 2 to de Staten-Generaal 2 (the First and Second Chamber combined) at de Ridderzaal 2 in The Hague. Amsterdam is formally the capital of The Netherlands, but parliament meets in The Hague, and most of the government departments and embassies are in that city. >> maps\n\nIn English, 'the government' means two things, that Dutch has separate words for:\n\nthe prime minister or president and his ministers or secretaries, the small group at the top that takes the most important decisions, also called 'the cabinet.' In Dutch: (de) regering - or also the less common (het) kabinet 2.\n\nall the govenment departments and administration bodies, the whole government bureaucracy. This is called de overheid 2 in Dutch, or more colloquially 't Rijk 2 for all Dutch government institutions together.\n\nHet Rijksmuseum 2 3 'the national museum' (in Amsterdam) that a.o. houses Rembrandt's 'The Night Watch'\n\n(de) rijksuniversiteit 'national, government-funded university'\n\nRijkswaterstaat 2 the government agency for water management\n\n(het) Staatsbosbeheer 2 3 the National Forest Service\n\nStelen van 't Rijk 2 Stealing from the government, the state See also: Arm en Rijk (Rich and Poor)\n\nWritten from memory of books, history lessons and newspaper articles. Recently read books, and facts checked in:\n\nMoerman, Geïllustreerde Vaderlandse Geschiedenis (Van Holkema & Warendorf, Amsterdam 1960)\n\nHans van der Horst: Nederland (Bert Bakker, Amsterdam 2005)\n\nGeert Mak: De Eeuw van Mijn Vader (Atlas, Amsterda m 1999)\n\nSee also: Politics Words - The News Words\n\nDemocracy (democratie ) is more than having elections (verkiezingen .) It requires equality (gelijkheid ) between people, leaving the choice to each individual, and not with men (always men) that tell you how to vote because they feel they have a natural right to govern and/or claim to be closer to God than the common people. Alle mensen zijn gelijk ('all people are equal.')\n\nElections should be free and fair, and voters need to be able to make an informed choice, which requires freedom of expression (vrijheid van meningsuiting ) and the related freedom of the press (persvrijheid 2) and freedom to meet and discuss any issues (vrijheid van vergadering 2.) Other important liberties are freedom of religion (godsdienstvrijheid ) and freedom of conscience (gewetensvrijheid ) which means the freedom to leave or change your religion.\n\nDemocracy also requires protection for minorities. Should people who think their ideology gives them more rights than others have the vote? I think not. Should criminals have the vote? I think not.\n\nCould we vote to limit the rights of, expel or exterminate a harmless minority? Could it be democratically decided to abolish democracy? I hope not.\n\nShould we allow immigration by groups hostile to freedom, equality and democracy, and lacking in respect for the rights of others? Should those immigrants be allowed to settle and given voting rights?\n\n(de) revolutie 2 revolution - the usage is different from English. I think in Dutch it's an internal affair. We say 'de Franse Revolutie' - but the American Revolution is called 'de Amerikaanse Vrijheidsoorlog' 2 (\"war of liberation\") and the Dutch Revolt is de Tachtigjarige Oorlog 2 3 ('the 80-years war' - 1568-1648)\n\n(de) opstand 2 uprising, revolt, rebellion\n\nde opstand van de gewone mensen 2 3 4\n\nthe revolt of the common people\n\n<< - essays - >>\n\nHome\n\n(Learning Dutch) previous\n\nvorige 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 next\n\nvolgende"
