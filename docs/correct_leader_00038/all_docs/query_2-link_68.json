        "text": "The Netherlands is a country located mainly in Northwestern Europe. [1] It has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815 and a parliamentary democracy since 1848. Its policies indicate that the Dutch Deep State, firmly undergirded by Operation Gladio like most Western Europe nation states, has remained fairly solidly aligned with the Supranational Deep State.\n\nHistory\n\nDutch Empire\n\nThe Netherlands is a former colonial power and at one time, in the seventeenth century, dominated world trade with ruthless methods. It still is a significant trading hub. Because of their small size and preference for sea-travel the Dutch mostly utilized strategic positions at harbours or straits unlike others empires.[2] A survey published in 2020 showed that the Dutch were more positive about the Dutch empire than any other former colonial power.[3]\n\nOperation Gladio\n\nIn June 2005, the Netherlands became the 4th country to publish an official report on Operation Gladio in the country. Entitled \"De Nederlandse stay behind - Organisatie in de koude oorlog (1945 - 1992) The PIVOT-Report No. 166\", it was a joint publication of the Dutch Ministry of General Affairs, the Dutch Ministry of Defence & the Dutch National Archives.[4]\n\nLaws\n\nIn August 2019, a Dutch law took effect which banning face-covering clothing, including the burqa and niqab, used with Moslem women.[5]\n\nConstitution\n\nThe Dutch constitution [6]gives the government extensive powers over war and peace. Formally, parliament has no say in the decision about military participation or the right to be informed in advance. Article 100 of the Constitution states:\n\n1. The Government shall inform the States General in advance if the armed forces are to be deployed or made available to maintain or promote the international legal order. This shall include the provision of humanitarian aid in the event of armed conflict.\n\n2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply if compelling reasons exist to prevent the provision of information in advance. In this event, information shall be supplied as soon as possible.\n\nDutch deep state\n\nFull article: Netherlands/Deep state\n\nThe Dutch deep state is relatively well documented here. The Dutch were the leading drug traffickers in the EU from the 1980s and were named during the 2010s as one of the \"world leaders\" of hosting child pornography by global prevention hotline[7],\n\nBilderberg\n\nFull article: Bilderberg\n\nThe Bilderberg is a deep state milieu founded in 1954, which has been held annually almost ever since. The Netherlands has been very well represented there ((183) Dutch Bilderbergers)[8]. The last Prime Minister of the Netherlands not to have attended the group was Dries van Agt whom the Dutch Deep state removed in 1982. At least 7 Dutch Foreign Ministers have attended.\n\nPaul Bremer was US Ambassador to the Netherlands from 1983-1986. Max Kohnstamm was a Dutch deep politician and Secretary-General of the Action Committee for the United States of Europe. As well as attending the 1961 Bilderberg he attended 27 subsequent meetings and became a member of the Bilderberg Advisory Committee, which chooses the steering committee.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nIn July 2020, the Netherlands refused to mandate mask wearing in public, noting that \"There Is No Proven Effectiveness\", although it was mandatory on public transport.[9]\n\nNieuwsuur supported the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (or RIVM in Dutch) claims that face masks weren't proven to be effective and therefore should not be mandatory in public apart from public transport, even when many schools and offices were showed to be accelerating the risks of local outbreaks due to poor ventilation.[10] Nieuwsuur actually defended the Dutch \"intelligent lockdown\" that included \"not one clear line of strategy\", with the RIVM explaining immunity can't be achieved if everyone just sits at home making the Dutch quite similar to Dominic Cummings alleged statements to \"let old people die\". Multiple professors called the policy of only making masks mandatory in 5 main streets in the main cities \"bullocks\" and \"against the Dutch constitution\", Dutch professors had already called for people to \"never pay the fines for socializing or not wearing masks\" giving similar reasons.[11] Mark Rutte called the policy \"a form of maximum control\".[12] [13]\n\n2021 closing bank accounts of COVID dissidents\n\nIn 2021, banks and payment services started blocking accounts of organizations they consider to be spreaders of \"fake news\" about COVID-19 and the COVID jabs. In April 2021, Café Weltschmerz was banned by the payment provider Mollie. The medical collective 'Doctors for Truth' was closed by the Bunq bank after the group distributed a letter among GPs in March 2021.[14]\n\nThe financial ban also affects the group Viruswaarheid, the publisher De Blauwe Tijger and the evangelist Jaap Dieleman. The banks framed their banning as part of the ongoing fight against \"extremism\".[14]\n\nCafé Weltschmerz has in earlier years also criticized the Dutch involvement in the Ukraine and the Official Narrative on MH17 by interviewing Max van der Werff, while De Blauwe Tijger has done similar about NATO's covert war on Syria, among other things by publishing speeches by the catholic monk Father Daniel Maes[15].\n\nThe ban happens not because they are breaking any law, but because the banks see their actions as \"harmful\". Money flows to and from these types of organizations are additionally screened by banks based on the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act, even when the law is not intended to be used this way.[14]\n\nNATO\n\nThe Netherlands is an important part of the NATO alliance, and actively participates in all parts of joint military operations, including the propaganda part of them. The government exploits its image as impartial and the country's role as host for several international organizations to maximum effect for propaganda purposes.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, infamous for its biased investigations of alleged chemical weapons incidents (such as the Douma attack, has its HQ in the Hague.\n\nThe Netherlands has its own cell of the Integrity Initiative.[16]\n\nThe country has its own military info-war system.[17]\n\nThe government is responsible for the deeply flawed 'investigation' of the MH17 incident in the Ukraine.\n\nThe propaganda outlet Bellingcat has its own office in the Hague and receives significant funding from Dutch sources (ie government funds through formally 'private' organizations, like the Adessium_Foundation.\n\nThe country is seat of NATO's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and The International Criminal Court, both used to full effect to prosecute exclusively NATO's enemies with a sheen of impartial justice.\n\nThe Netherlands and in particular the port of Rotterdam[18] is a central node in illegal drug trafficking to Western Europe.[19]\n\nThe port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport are major world transit hubs for all kind of cargo.\n\nThe Netherlands is home to several large multinational companies including Philips‎, Royal Dutch Shell, Heineken, Unilever, ABN AMRO, ING Group and Rabobank.\n\nFracking\n\nFull article: Fracking\n\nIn Groningen, fracking for natural gas fields was started with the help of Shell, ExxonMobil and their subsidiaries, which remains a controversial topic for deep politics until this day as halting the fracking would've resulted in an economic collapse for that coalition-cabinet, as the Dutch did not want Russian gas, and the Middle East has had its \"fluctuations\".[20][21]\n\nEvents carried out\n\nEventLocationDescription2011 Attacks on LibyaLibya\"Perhaps one of the most egregious examples of US military aggression and lawlessness in recent memory\", carried out under a pretext of \"humanitarian intervention\".Evacuation from AfghanistanAfghanistanThe evacuation of foreigners from Afghanistan, one of the largest airlifts in history\n\nRelated Quotations\n\nPageQuoteAuthorDries van Agt“Marcel van Dam had the for many plausible opinion that the Prince of the Netherlands should be handled by the Dutch State as every other citizen. So to be brought before trial. I, as Minister of Justice didn't think that was completely unreasonable.”Dries van AgtBeatrix Armgard“The lie rules”Beatrix ArmgardJan Peter Balkenende“I don't get why you are so annoying and negative about this. Let's be happy together! Let's say: The Dutch are finally able to do this again, that VOC-mentality, looking beyond borders, dynamic! Right?!”Jan Peter BalkenendeStef Blok“All parties involved in the conflict are committing crimes. The Netherlands knows that the opposition is committing war crimes. We already wrote that starting in 2013. In fact Karel van Oostrom knew precisely what was written in the reports. He even knew all the details. The Dutch have enough people and info from intelligence agencies. And especially the Dutch and all the other EU countries, because they share all that info. They knew exactly what was happening. (...) Throughout investigation is needed. Not only the Dutch but other nation states supported the Syrian war. Therefore they could be complicit in committing war crimes.”Stef Blok\n\nCarla Del PonteFerdinand Grapperhaus“Activists are only there to break things and provocate.”Ferdinand GrapperhausSigrid Kaag“All parties involved in the conflict are committing crimes.

But here something else is not functioning. That is power and opposing power. There is such an intimate connection between the coalition and parliament, between the parliament and the media, between the parliament and the justice system. If you ask difficult questions, you become the problem. There is something wrong with the checks and balances. And it goes further. The criminal justice system doesn't work anymore. All the NGOs that hog the government's money, all don't work anymore. Know what happens nowadays? They don't dare to speak, because the government will kill their subsidy. We've organized or system so precisely that our flock of politicians values the party-chairman more than the electorate.”Pieter OmtzigtPieter Omtzigt“There's a wider agenda underneath this. I wish it was only one tax officer, it was that one or that one, or that minister. That's why I've said for over 4 years, I don't care if you resign. Why? It isn't one person, we created a system and government that doesn't put the people in the first place, only during election campaigns.\".”Pieter OmtzigtMark Rutte“Vision is like an elephant that robs your view.

Seemingly that doesn't seem to be legally possible now. It's about time to change the law”Mark RutteMark Rutte“I get so angry reading those articles in Amsterdam where people are snorting 10000 lines of cocaine that are seemingly being used weekly or daily in the big cities, which makes me wonder that those idiots, that do that, those idiots that do that, they are maintaining that system of heavy crime, where Taghi and all those criminal families have made a billion-euro business.”Mark RutteHenk Vredeling“Congresses don't buy jet-fighters”Henk VredelingHenk Vredeling“Juliana began to cry. I told her, it's a different coalition now. I told Bernhard. It will be civil manifestation. I decide. And nobody else. He became as gentle as a lamb. A typical kraut. One of \"Befehl ist befehl\", \"gehorsamt ist gehorsamt\". He gets off on his uniform.”Henk VredelingHenk Vredeling“I'm also a little bit against the NATO in the way that it's a fremdkörper. It's de facto America. We should view cases more independently.”Henk VredelingHenk Vredeling“My civil servants.. if needed I'll walk over these folks. Max van der Stoel doesn't do that. I decide. Defensive Planning Questions of the NATO I should do myself. NO said Foreign Affairs. They think they can dictate everything. I was so angry. I'm adamantly against that. Baron from here to there, screw them. Max van der Stoel follows them with his mug. He gets 120.000 every year.”Henk VredelingPeter R. de Vries“We already lost the War on drugs long ago, and the policy is bankrupt, it has led to nothing, yes, full prisons, a clogged justice system and it didn't help one bit because you can find a coffee-shop on every corner of the street and even with record-braking catches of shipments of cocaine in the harbour, it doesn't mean anything. We're dealing with a extreme high demand in the world with $300.000.000.000 profit for drug traffickers with $100.000.000.000 of it cocaine alone, with the same 100.000.000.000 for the worldwide diverse police and justice agencies used, amounting to nothing. You can't just maintain this repressive policy. You need to make this more of national health crisis.”Peter R. de Vries\n\nEvents\n\nEventDescription1948 Hague CongressLandmark conference which had a profound influence on the shape of the European Movement.
