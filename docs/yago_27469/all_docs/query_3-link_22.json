        "text": "JACKI LYDEN, host:\n\nAs a writer, Paul Auster has been prolific. His novels, poetry and nonfiction have been translated into over 30 languages and won numerous international awards. And for this show, he served as the editor of a National Story Project.\n\nPaul Auster has also written screenplays and directed movies. His new film, out this weekend at the Independent Film Center in New York is called \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost.\" The backstory actually appeared in one of his novels, 2002's \"The Book of Illusions.\"\n\nThe film is about a reclusive writer who falls in love with a stranger. She hides her true identity as long as she can. She's a muse sent to inspire Martin Frost to write his greatest works.\n\n(Soundbite of movie, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost\")\n\nMs. IRENE JACOB (Actor): (As Claire Martin) I didn't know what else to do. I had to find a way to make you trust me. After a day or two, I thought you'd figure it out on your own, and then it wouldn't matter anymore.\n\nMr. DAVID THEWLIS (Actor): (As Martin Frost) Figure out what?\n\nMs. JACOB: (As Claire Martin) Don't you get it, Martin? We've been together for almost a week, and you're telling me you still don't get it.\n\nMr. THEWLIS: (As Martin Frost) Who are you? What the hell are you doing here?\n\nMs. JACOB: (As Claire Martin) Oh, Martin. It doesn't matter who I am.\n\nMr. THEWLIS: (As Martin Frost) Of course, it does. It matters very much.\n\nMs. JACOB: (As Claire Martin) No, my darling, it doesn't.\n\nMr. THEWLIS: (As Martin Frost) How can you say that?\n\nMs. JACOB: (As Claire Martin) It doesn't matter because you love me.\n\nLYDEN: Paul Auster, welcome back to the program.\n\nMr. PAUL AUSTER (Director; Writer, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost\"): Thank you very much, Jacki.\n\nLYDEN: It's niceâ€¦\n\nMr. AUSTER: It's good to be back here.\n\nLYDEN: It's nice to have you back here.\n\nMr. AUSTER: Thank you.\n\nLYDEN: Let's talk about the plot of this movie, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost.\" You call this a fantastical story in the spirit of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Tell us a little bit about what happens here.\n\nMr. AUSTER: Well, it's a rather unusual story. It's a story about a man who writes a story about a man who writes a story. So there are three levels in it. But what you're seeing on screen is that writer coming to a country house owned by friends. He's just finished writing a novel. He's tired. He wants to rest. His friends are away. And they've given him the house for as long as he wants it. And suddenly he gets an idea for a story. And he goes to bed that night thinking about the story. He wakes up in the morning and suddenly, there's a beautiful woman in bed next to him - Claire, played by Irene Jacob, the French actress. And David Thewlis is Martin Frost, the British actor. Claire, Martin slowly discovers, is his muse.\n\nLYDEN: By the way, Irene Jacob, of course, is known to a lot of our listeners as the star of \"The Double Life Of Veronique.\"\n\nMr. AUSTER: Yes.\n\nLYDEN: She dies in this picture in, sort of, in the middle. As he is coming to the end of his story, Claire is in another room and she's expiring.\n\nMr. AUSTER: Well, you see, she is the story. And so the closer he gets to finishing it, the more sick she becomes. And so when he types the last period of the last sentence, she dies. And he walks into the room, where she's laying in bed, with the story in his hands, and suddenly he understands. He figures it out. It takes him a few moments. And what he does is he burns the story in the fireplace. And she comes back to life.\n\n(Soundbite of movie, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost\")\n\nMs. JACOB: (As Claire Martin) What are you doing? My God, Martin, what are you doing?\n\nMr. THEWLIS: (As Martin Frost) I'm buying you back, Claire. Thirty-seven pages for your life is the best bargain I've ever made.\n\nMs. JACOB: (As Claire Martin) No, you can't do that. That's not allowed.\n\nMr. THEWLIS: (As Martin Frost) (Unintelligible) but I'm doing (unintelligible). I've changed the rules.\n\nMs. JACOB: (As Claire Martin) Oh, Martin. Oh, Martin. You don't know what you've done.\n\nMr. AUSTER: So this unreal muse-like creature is suddenly part of the real world. How are they going to deal with this and cope with it?\n\nLYDEN: Is this about protecting the creative spirit? A part of what you're trying to explore here really about the creative process, which is so fragile, and the difficulty of keeping that creative spirit alive.\n\nMr. AUSTER: Well, I do think of it as a story about the imagination and how people go about making things up and how, when you're truly living inside your imaginary creations, you begin to lose your grasp on what's real and what's not real. Because the imaginary takes on such power inside an artist that it feels as real as so-called reality.\n\nLYDEN: You said that this story is written in the spirit of Nathaniel Hawthorne. What do you mean?\n\nMr. AUSTER: Well, Hawthorn wrote rather fantastical stories, I think some of the greatest stories ever written by an American. You can think of stories like \"The Birth-Mark,\" which has this fabular quality to it. A man marries a woman who's beautiful and he's a scientist. But she has one flaw, a birthmark, and he wants to remove it. But of course, in removing the birthmark, he kills her. And, you know, this is typical Hawthorne kind of story. And I think Martin Frost is somehow in that tradition as well.\n\nLYDEN: Now, there's another actor in this movie and that is, of course, Michael Imperioli from \"The Sopranos,\" one of the great running (unintelligible) of our time. Tell us a little bit about his role.\n\nMr. AUSTER: Yeah, well, Michael plays a plumber, Fortunato, who also writes in his spare time. And he's a bit of a nuts. He talks and talks and talks. He probably has more lines of dialogue than the two main characters.\n\n(Soundbite of movie, \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost\")\n\nMr. MICHAEL IMPERIOLI (Actor): (As Jim Fortunato) So you're not writing anything now?\n\nMr. THEWLIS: (As Martin Frost) (Unintelligible)\n\nMr. IMPERIOLI: (As Jim Fortunato) And that doesn't matter? You just hang around this big old house, all alone and no one to talk to? No wonder you are depressed. What you need is a little diversion.\n\nMr. THEWLIS: (As Martin Frost) Maybe.\n\nMr. IMPERIOLI: (As Jim Fortunato) Have you ever heard of screwdriver darts?\n\n(Soundbite of dart)\n\nMr. THEWLIS: (As Martin Frost) It's pretty impressive.\n\nMr. IMPERIOLI: (As Jim Fortunato) Just warming up.\n\nMr. AUSTER: Michael, I've known for many years. In fact, he even auditioned as far back as 1994 for \"Smoke.\"\n\nLYDEN: And you cut him.\n\nMr. AUSTER: Well, we couldn't - he was too young for the part. And then when I made \"Lulu on the Bridge\" in '98, I hired him for a role, a small role. And then he got something better. And I think it might have been \"The Sopranos.\" But I always wanted to work with Michael. I admired him a lot. And he told me at one point that the only script for films he ever gets are cops and robbers. And he's either a cop or a robber. And he's sick of it. He doesn't want to just do that. And I was writing the screenplay for the \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost.\" Then I said, Michael, I think I've got a part for you.\n\nLYDEN: Well, what happened to this little film now?\n\nMr. AUSTER: Well, we opened and I hope it extends. Later this month, it's going to have its European premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain. So fingers crossed, we'll see what happens.\n\nLYDEN: Well, Paul Auster, thank you very, very much for joining us. And we wish you good luck.\n\nMr. AUSTER: Thank you, Jackie, so much. Good to talk to you.\n\nLYDEN: That's novelist, screenwriter and director Paul Auster. His latest film is \"The Inner Life of Martin Frost.\" It opened this weekend in New York City.\n\nCopyright Â© 2007 NPR. All rights reserved.
