        "text": "Auster: A literary icon and Brooklyn's muse\n\nAuster, a New Jersey native, was deeply connected with New York City, particularly Brooklyn where he moved in 1980. Auster authored nearly three dozen books, including Moon Palace (1989), The Music of Chance (1990), The Book of Illusions (2002), The Brooklyn Follies (2005), Sunset Park (2010), and Winter Journal (2012). He released numerous books in recent times, including Burning Boy: The Life and Work of Stephen Crane (2021) and Bloodbath Nation (2023). His last novel, Baumgartner, was published last year.\n\nSuccess of his debut work, a memoir cemented his stature\n\nAfter the success of his debut work, a memoir titled The Invention of Solitude, Auster became renowned for his trilogy of interconnected stories, collectively known as The New York Trilogy. While these works incorporate elements of the detective genre, they defy convention by focusing more on existential themes than traditional mystery plots. Auster himself described the trilogy as an extension of his earlier work, stating that it \"grows directly out of The Invention of Solitude.\"\n\nAuster's contribution to film writing; screenplays of these movies\n\nLater in his career, Auster ventured into film writing with the screenplay for Smoke (1995), featuring acclaimed actors like Harvey Keitel and William Hurt. His script earned him the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. Collaborating with Wayne Wang, they co-directed the sequel, Blue in the Face, boasting a star-studded cast. Additionally, Auster contributed to the screenplay of Wang's The Center of the World (2001).\n\nAuster made his directorial debut with 'Lulu on the Bridge'\n\nIn 1998, Auster made his directorial debut with Lulu on the Bridge, featuring a cast including Harvey Keitel and Mira Sorvino. He later helmed The Inner Life of Martin Frost (2007), starring David Thewlis and Irene Jacob. Auster's literary prowess extended to his 2017 novel, 4321, which earned a spot on the Man Booker Prize shortlist. He is survived by his second wife Siri Hustved, daughter Sophie Auster, sister Janet Auster, and grandson Miles."
