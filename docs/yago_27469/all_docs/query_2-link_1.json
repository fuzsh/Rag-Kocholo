It stars Harvey Keitel leading an ensemble cast, including Giancarlo Esposito, Roseanne Barr, Michael J. Fox, Lily Tomlin, Victor Argo, Mira Sorvino, Lou Reed, Keith David, Jim Jarmusch, Jared Harris, RuPaul, and Madonna.\n\nBlue in the Face was filmed over a five-day period as a follow-up to Wang's 1995 film Smoke. During production of Smoke, Keitel and the others ad-libbed scenes in-character between takes and a sequel was made using this improvised material.\n\nLily Tomlin was nominated for an American Comedy Award as \"Funniest Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture\" for her performance in this picture.\n\nBlue in the Face features songs by singer Selena. Her bilingual duet with David Byrne, \"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\", appears on the film's soundtrack.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film once again centers on the Brooklyn Cigar Store and manager Auggie (Harvey Keitel), although most of the other characters are different. The store owner's frustrated wife Dot (Roseanne Barr) is one of them, and one of the plotlines follows her attempts to seduce Auggie. Madonna, Michael J. Fox, Lily Tomlin and Lou Reed as himself also put in appearances.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nHarvey Keitel as Augustus \"Auggie\" Wren\n\nVictor Argo as Vinnie\n\nKeith David as Jackie Robinson\n\nGiancarlo Esposito as Tommy Finelli\n\nMichael J.

Blue in the Face is more of a footnote.\"[3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
