        "text": "June 24, 2016\n\nThis is a fascinating look into two very unusual films: the first, Smoke, a feature-length adaptation of a mere six-page story; the second, Blue in the Face, an improvised spin-off of Smoke shot over a period of just a few days.\n\nSmoke is a really special movie -- a story about storytelling -- that doesn't at all feel like a by-the-numbers, three-act Hollywood production, which is likely owed to the fact that it was produced by Miramax during the '90s heyday of indie cinema, written by an accomplished novelist tackling his first-ever screenplay, and directed by a Hong Kong–born filmmaker. Though marketed as a comedy, it almost defies genre categorization -- and I mean that as a compliment. It's a delightful film with some really terrific performances and a real affection for the borough of Brooklyn (long before the hipsters discovered it and reshaped the culture in their own image). Paul Auster's published screenplay includes a number of scenes that didn't make the final cut of the film; it's fun to imagine the wonderful actors playing some of that excised material.\n\nAlso included in this collection is a great interview with Auster sharing some behind-the-scenes anecdotes, and the playful, moving New York Times piece that inspired the production, \"Auggie Wren's Christmas Story.\" To read \"Auggie Wren\" is to appreciate what a clever, creative expansion on that short story Smoke became.\n\nConceptually, Blue in the Face was a visionary next stage in the evolution of this fictional world: Take the Brooklyn Cigar Company, the central location in Smoke, and spend a few days with many of the players from that production shooting a second movie set in and around the store -- to bask in the local color of the community and create an ad-libbed \"love letter\" of sorts to Brooklyn culture, and to the importance of its institutions, from its corner shops to its bygone ball teams.\n\nThe Blue in the Face supplementals featured in this book are in some respects even more interesting than the Smoke materials, because they offer a compelling glimpse into a very experimental project. Included here is the basic plot outline and actors' notes Auster prepared for the production, along with retrospective commentary on each scene from Auster himself, followed by a transcript of the finished film.\n\nUltimately, Blue in the Face is more effective as an addendum to Smoke -- almost like a collection of \"deleted scenes\" you might find on a DVD -- than as a movie in its own right; it's too scattershot to add up to a cohesive whole. Even by the avant-garde standards of independent cinema, there's not much of a narrative arc to speak of: It's comprised of a series of (mostly unrelated) sketches that are amusing at best, indulgent at worst, with no discernible logic to the scene transitions.\n\nIf anything, Blue demonstrates how difficult it is to pull off improvised comedy successfully, à la This Is Spinal Tap and the movies of Christopher Guest, because as freewheeling as those narratives seem, they are built upon classically structured plots. Guest also had a company of actors very skilled in the deceptively tricky art of improvisation; the cast of Blue is committed, I'll give them that, but too many of the scenes play like an acting workshop -- and the inclusion of the movie's transcript, with its meandering, repetitive dialogue reproduced verbatim, only seems to underscore that point. The movie is not without its charms (Lou Reed's recurring interview in particular is riotously funny), and certainly pays lovely tribute to Brooklyn, but doesn't add up to a whole lot. Whereas Smoke was meticulously plotted/written and slowly paced, Blue in the Face is almost the opposite: hastily sketched and frenetically edited.\n\nFor fans of either movie, though, this collection is a must. There hasn't been, so far as I know, a making-of featurette produced for Smoke or Blue, so this book is it. It is, in many ways, preferable to a behind-the-scenes documentary, because you can read it at your own speed, and savor the artistry that went into the creation of these stories, from the original Times piece to the unconventional movie it influenced, and to the noble (if not entirely successful) experiment in improvisational cinema borne from that. There's a lot to appreciate here, and as Auggie himself once said, \"You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.\""
