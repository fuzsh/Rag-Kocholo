        "text": "Blue in the Face is the ninth episode of Season 2 of That's So Raven. It originally aired on April 16, 2004.\n\nPlot[]\n\nRaven is asked by Devon to go to a Blue Rain concert, but her grades are slipping due to spending too much time with him. Tanya tells Raven that if her grades don't get better she'll be grounded and she'll have to miss the Blue Rain concert.\n\nMeanwhile, Cory wants to hang out with a \"Cool Girl\" who makes fun of William's clothes and Victor becomes slightly obsessed with his new paper shredder.\n\nWilliam helps Raven with her science project, but she forgets to help him, so Cory gets mad at her and the boys shred the formula for the project, so it takes Raven all night to put it together. Then at school, she ends up creating an unstable chemical reaction that causes her and Victor (who had come to bring her the formula) to get covered in some sort of blue substance that will not be washable for two days. Raven is grounded until her grades improve and she's not allowed to go to the concert.\n\nThat night, Devon tells Raven that since she can't go to the concert, he's bringing Blue Rain to her. Cory chooses William over Madison. Raven is given a second chance to bring her grades up by doing an extra credit project. She also gives William a makeover like she promised.\n\nCast[]\n\nMain Cast[]\n\nRaven-Symone as Raven Baxter,\n\nOrlando Brown as Eddie Thomas,\n\nKyle Massey as Cory Baxter,\n\nAnneliese van der Pol as Chelsea Daniels,\n\nT'Keyah Crystal Keym√°h as Tanya Baxter,\n\nRondell Sheridan as Victor Baxter.\n\nRecurring Cast[]\n\nLil' J as Devon Carter,\n\nFrankie Ryan Manriquez as William,\n\nRhyon Nicole Brown as Madison.\n\nGuest Cast[]\n\nClinton Jackson as Mr. Holloway\n\nTrivia/Goofs[]\n\n\"Blue Rain\" is a parody of \"Blue Man Group\".\n\nThis is the first time that Devon and Raven have blue faces in this episode of the show.\n\nDevon standing outside Raven's bedroom with a boombox is a reference to the 1989 film Say Anything....\n\nOne moment, William has a dish rag on his head. When it shows Raven and back to William, the dish rag is automatically on the table and it is off his head, but it didn't show William taking the dish rag off.\n\nFrom 7:25 to 9:00, the door leading to the backyard opens and closes a few times without anyone ever even being seen touching the door.\n\nMorals:\n\nSchoolwork and grades comes first.\n\nNever break a promise. What goes around comes around.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nThere are no quotes for this episode."
