        "text": "blue in the face kind of emulates the act of people-watching if every person you happened to come across in a day was weirder than the last. while you're still reeling from being ambushed by belgian waffle facts and lou reed's childhood trauma, suddenly ru paul appears to start a flashdance (???)\n\nit pains me to say it but this movie is impossible to rate because the discrepancy in vibe and quality throughout it is insane. some of it was really interesting or something resembling heartfelt but then it would go down some incredibly cringe rabbithole and it's like :///\n\nmy favorite person in this might be the guy working on patenting his invention of a device that helps you grab plastic bags out of trees. he was so genuine w it and having so much fun, i love him\n\nJim Jarmusch smoking his last cigarette is the highlight. A very modest highlight, but no doubt the highlight. What would his career be without cigarettes? Why is it so soothing to hear him talk about addiction? These scenes are thoughtless mellow pleasures. Smokes, if you will.\n\nA decent movie to have on while doing something else.\n\nI didn't know this was a companion film to Smoke, so I guess that I'll have to catch up on that, so to say.\n\nOverall, this was okay, but I think that the scenes with Harvey Keitel and Jim Jarmusch really made this film into something... let's say watchable, as well as Lou Reed's scenes. It was lovely to hear John Lurie and his orchestra as the soundtrack."
