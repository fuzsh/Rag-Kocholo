Many of the same characters inhabiting Auggie Wren's Brooklyn Cigar Store in Smoke return here to expound on their philosophy of smoking, relationships, baseball, New York, and Belgian Waffles. Most of all, this is a movie about living life, off-the-cuff.\n\nProduction info\n\nDirected by: Paul Auster & Wayne Wang\n\nWritten by: Paul Auster & Wayne Wang\n\nProduced by: Francey Grace, Greg Johnson, Harvey Keitel, Hisami Kuroiwa, Peter Newman, Diana Phillips, Bob Weinstein & Harvey Weinstein\n\nProduction company: Miramax Films\n\nLocation: NY\n\nDate of filming: July 1994\n\nBudget: $ 2 million\n\nRelease info\n\nReleased as: Blue In The Face\n\nReleased in theatres: Oct. 13, 1995 (US)\n\nReleased on DVD: March 4, 1999 (Eur.) / May 25, 2003 (US)\n\nRuntime: 80 minutes\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nMPAA rating: R\n\nBox office: $ 1.3 million (US)\n\nAwards\n\n1995 Stockholm Film Festival:\n\nNomination for Bronze Horse\n\n1996 American Comedy Awards:\n\nNomination for 'Funniest Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture' (Lily Tomlin)\n\nSoundtrack"
