        "text": "Wayne Wang, Paul Auster / US, 1995 / 83 min.\n\nFollow-up to Smoke, about a tobacconist’s in New York full of unexpected meetings, this time featuring cameos from the likes of Lou Reed, Michael J. Fox, Madonna and Jim Jarmusch, loosely co-directed by Paul Auster the author, who died on 30 April 2024.\n\nPaul Auster (1947-2024) was a huge film buff and author who was inspired by cinematic techniques. Smoke was set in a tobacconist’s in Brooklyn modelled after the store author and chain smoker Auster visited himself a few times a week. The accidental meetings there inspired Smoke and its follow-up Blue in the Face. The tobacconist’s resident guest Auggie (Harvey Keitel) is an author with writer's block and is, not coincidentally, called Paul (Wiliam Hurt).\n\nDetails\n\nThis movie is suitable for all agesThis movie contains foul language\n\nDirector\n\nWayne Wang, Paul Auster\n\nProduction year\n\n1995\n\nCountry\n\nUS\n\nOriginal title\n\nBlue in the Face\n\nLength\n\n83 min.\n\nLanguage\n\nnone\n\nSubtitles\n\nNLD\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nPlanning on having a drink or a bite to eat?
