        "text": "WHAT CAN A screenwriter, a film director and a star do when they become so fascinated with the characters they have created that they can't bear to let go of them? If the screenwriter is the novelist Paul Auster, the director Wayne Wang and the star Harvey Keitel, they simply extend the shooting schedule five days, call on some big-name actors willing to work on short notice, for far less than their usual pay, and improvise a quick second film.\n\nBoth films -- the one that was planned and the one that was unexpectedly born on the set -- were given their world premiere in February at the Berlin Film Festival. \"Smoke,\" which won the second prize, or Special Jury Prize, at the festival, will open in the United States in June (the first prize went to \"L'Appat,\" in English \"Fresh Bait,\" by Bernard Tavernier). The second film, \"Blue in the Face,\" opens in the fall.\n\nBerlin critics praised both films, especially \"Smoke,\" which was an audience favorite. One critic said that although \"Smoke\" is set in New York, it has \"a more European, literary feel.\" Another wrote, \" 'Smoke' is what we would have gotten if the actors from Louis Malle's 'Vanya on 42d Street' had decided to leave the New Amsterdam Theater to make a picture about Brooklyn.\"\n\nBoth \"Smoke\" and \"Blue in the Face\" take place in Brooklyn, in a former post office on Prospect Park West in Park Slope, and Mr. Auster, a resident of Park Slope and the author of such novels as \"Mr. Vertigo,\" \"Leviathan\" and \"The Music of Chance,\" makes no effort in either film to disguise his love for his home borough.\n\nThe starting point for this unusual project was a syrupy Christmas story written by Mr. Auster for The New York Times a few years ago. The sentimental tale, of the sort most newspapers publish only at holiday time, was about the proprietor of a Brooklyn tobacco shop who does a good deed for an elderly blind woman. It attracted the attention of Mr. Wang, whose success with \"The Joy Luck Club\" might have allowed him to pursue more lucrative projects. Instead he engaged Mr. Auster to expand his story into a screenplay.\n\nThe resulting film, \"Smoke,\" was shot on location in Brooklyn. Mr. Keitel plays the tobacco-shop proprietor, and William Hurt is an author who must find an idea for a Christmas feature commissioned by The Times. The tale of the blind woman becomes a single episode in a film that is divided into chapters, each of them a different story related in some way to the shop or its customers. Needless to say, a fair amount of tobacco is consumed during the film. Mr. Auster says that much of the dialogue he wrote \"is a smokescreen, the smoke that obscures vision, that obscures understanding.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
