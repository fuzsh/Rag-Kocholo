        "text": "At a country church in Idaho, the preacher reminds his congregation that they are imperfect beings but they can improve through faith in Jesus Christ. Meanwhile, a young man named Lightfoot elicits sympathy from a local car dealer by claiming to have a wooden leg and steals a muscle car. Back at the church, a man fires his gun at the preacher, who escapes through the back door. As the man chases the preacher through a wheat field, Lightfoot speeds toward them and hits the assailant, but as he drives away, the preacher clutches the side of the car and pulls himself through the passenger door window. Gripping his shoulder in pain, the preacher announces that he is joining Lightfoot in his journey south. Later, when the preacher resets his dislocated shoulder, Lightfoot deduces that he is not who he appears to be. The preacher evades Lightfoot’s speculation by inquiring why his car does not have license plates. After the men steal another car to avoid detection from the police, the preacher asks to be dropped off at a bus station. As they part, the preacher offers Lightfoot his watch as a token of appreciation, but Lightfoot refuses and says he wants friendship instead. Walking into the station, the preacher sees a man putting a long object, wrapped in a blanket, into a locker and turns back to hitch another ride with Lightfoot. Later that evening, Lightfoot steals license plates and picks up a young lady named Melody, who he brings back to the motel with a girl friend for the preacher. As the preacher and girl make love, he tells her his scars are from his service in the Korean War. The next morning, the man from the bus station unwraps a rifle from a blanket while he and his partner keep watch on Lightfoot’s stolen car, but his aim is obstructed by a passing truck. The preacher and Lightfoot lead their assailants on a chase through the countryside and get away. After their car breaks down, Lightfoot tells the preacher that a delivery boat will soon pass and take them up river, but the preacher warns Lightfoot to stay away. Lightfoot admits that he is estranged from his family, and as the men cruise up river together, Lightfoot asks the preacher to teach him to rob banks because he dreams of owning a white Cadillac convertible. Back on land, Lightfoot and the preacher hitch a ride with a crazy driver. When the car rolls off the side of the road, the preacher restrains him and they steal his wallet and vehicle. After buying groceries in a nearby town, Lightfoot claims that anyone can rob a bank, but the preacher disagrees and explains the complicated engineering of vault security systems. As Lightfoot listens with admiration, the preacher warns about the challenges they would face and confesses that while living as a preacher, he almost forgot about the money he stole from Montana Armored. Lightfoot recalls hearing news reports about the heist and deduces that the preacher’s true identity is Thunderbolt, the notorious bank robber. Thunderbolt tells Lightfoot they are being pursued by Red Leary, a fellow Marine who saved Thunderbolt’s life in Korea. Leary, Thunderbolt and their team including safe-cracker Billy Lamb, their dim witted driver, Goody, and an electronics expert, Dunlop, pulled off a heist of $500,000. Lamb and Thunderbolt hid the money behind a blackboard in a one-room schoolhouse in Warsaw, Montana, but Lamb passed away before telling the others of its location. In an attempt to frame Leary for another robbery, the police and media collaborated to falsely report that the money was recovered, and Leary was convinced that Thunderbolt set him up. Fearing retribution, Thunderbolt concealed his identity by becoming a preacher. When Thunderbolt and Lightfoot arrive at the Warsaw schoolhouse, they discover it has been remodeled. Returning to the car, they are held up by Leary and Goody, who are hiding in the backseat. After driving into the countryside, Leary knocks Lightfoot out and fights Thunderbolt, but he becomes exhausted by hay fever. Although Leary orders Goody to kill Thunderbolt, Goody is hesitant and Thunderbolt takes control. Unafraid of Leary, Thunderbolt drops the weapons and explains that the reports of the loot’s recovery were fabricated. Thunderbolt convinces Leary that he did not set him up, telling him that the money remained in the schoolhouse, at least until it was rebuilt. As the men drive away together, Lightfoot suggests that they replicate the Montana Armored heist, since it was successful the first time around and a repeat performance would be unexpected. Although Leary is hesitant to approve the idea of a novice and work without the expertise of Lamb and Dunlop, Thunderbolt and Goody agree with Lightfoot. The men settle down in a small town and find jobs to finance the equipment needed for the robbery. When Lightfoot uses his landscape company’s truck to pick up the weapons, Leary tells him that Thunderbolt was a war hero who saved his life in Korea. At a meeting shortly before the heist, Lightfoot expresses uncertainty that he can pull it off, but Thunderbolt tells him there is no backing out and gives him his watch so he can follow the precise timing of the operation. On the night of the robbery, Thunderbolt and Leary break into the bank manager’s house and demand the combination to the vault while Lightfoot disguises himself as a blonde female. Lightfoot gains entry into the town’s telegraph office by seducing the operator, then knocks him out and disarms the bank alarm. At that exact moment, Thunderbolt and Leary open the vault doors. Although Lightfoot narrowly misses his connection with Goody, the men rendezvous with Thunderbolt and Leary, who have blasted through the interior walls of the vault and stolen its contents. Thunderbolt secures Leary and Goody in the trunk with the cash before driving away, but the edge of Leary’s shirt remains exposed under the hatch. When Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, who is still disguised as a woman, pull into the drive-in theater next to the bank as planned, the lady in the ticket booth notices Leary’s shirt and becomes suspicious they are trying to sneak someone in. Thunderbolt thinks the approaching police cars are headed for the bank, but when they surround the theater he speeds away. The police fire at the car and a bullet pierces the trunk, hitting Goody. Although Goody is not dead, Leary pushes him onto the road and holds up Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. After beating the men unconscious, Leary drives away, but he runs into a police barricade. Leary is chased until he crashes into a storefront and is killed by a guard dog. As Thunderbolt helps Lightfoot to his feet, Lightfoot reveals his knowledge that Thunderbolt was the Silver Star war hero, not Leary, but Thunderbolt contends there is no difference between them. After the men hitchhike to the outskirts of Warsaw, Thunderbolt discovers a one-room schoolhouse. A plaque in front of the building indicates it is a historical landmark that was moved from its original location. While Lightfoot guards the door, still dizzy from his beating the previous evening, Thunderbolt uses his belt to unscrew the blackboard and uncovers the lost money. Later, as Lightfoot falls in and out of consciousness, Thunderbolt buys a white, Cadillac convertible and they drive away together. Barely able to hold himself up and slurring his words, Lightfoot offers Thunderbolt a cigar to celebrate their victory. Reflecting that he feels more like a hero than a criminal, Lightfoot leans toward Thunderbolt and dies. When Thunderbolt is unable to revive his friend, he breaks his cigar in half and proceeds down the open highway."
