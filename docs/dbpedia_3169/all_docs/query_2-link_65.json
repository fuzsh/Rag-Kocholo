It was a time when the studio system was in ruins and a group of maverick filmmakers rose-up from the crumbled remains and delivered a run of films that changed the course of cinema forever.

Visually, it’s more impressive than much of Eastwood’s ‘70s output, giving the somewhat generic tale a touch of class that it otherwise may have been lacking. The success of Thunderbolt and Lightfoot led to The Deer Hunter and the success of that film led to the director being given carte blanche to helm Heaven’s Gate, the $44 million western that almost destroyed United Artists. It’s a shame that Cimino’s career never recovered from that legendary flop, directing just four films in its wake (the last was 1996’s The Sunchaser).\n\nThunderbolt And Lightfoot grossed $21.7 million at the US box office in 1974."
