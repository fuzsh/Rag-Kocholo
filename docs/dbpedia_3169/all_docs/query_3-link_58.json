        "text": "“Thunderbolt and Lightfoot” sacrifices Clint Eastwood’s steely charisma at the alter of a paisley-clad clown in the form of Jeff Bridges.\n\nIn a shock to no one; Eastwood never made another film for United Artists or director Michael Cimino again.\n\nFor the audience though, “Thunderbolt” is a charming treat of a road trip heist film about some guys that will go to just about any lengths to avoid working a normal 9-5 job.\n\nCimino, better known for his mid-career bombast, proves in his debut feature what the first third of “Deer Hunter” would confirm years later; he’s best when he’s just showing a bunch of dudes hanging out.\n\nThe plot pairs Bridges’ young con ‘Lightfoot‘ with Eastwood’s ‘Thunderbolt,’ an overly-seasoned…\n\nSo what if I told you there's a pretty enjoyable heist/buddy comedy movie starring a young Jeff Bridges and a not-so-grumpy-actually-pretty-happy Clint Eastwood? Well, there is!\n\nThe chemistry between our two leads instantly works out, which is good news as that's really the anchor of the film. The way they are introduced and the whole thing plays out almost feels ahead of its time, feeling less in tone with pictures from that era and more like an 80s flick in the same vein as Midnight Run but with a few more violence and blood.\n\nMy only nitpick with this movie is that while in tone doesn't fee like a 70s movie, in pace it does. And not in a good…\n\n\"Sometimes you have to pay for your pleasure\"\n\nWhile fleeing for his life from members of his old crew who think he double crossed them, Thunderbolt (Clint Eastwood) makes a narrow escape by jumping into Lightfoot's stolen car. With Thunderbolt's old crew hot on their tail, the two men become fast friends and set out to recover the loot stashed from an old robbery together.\n\nThunderbolt and Lightfoot is a cool outlaw team up movie. It's deftly directed by Cimino, who incorporates beautiful scenery of mountains and rivers in a way that gives (the first hour in particular) the film a real feeling of being out on the open road. Eastwood and Bridges have great chemistry and hold up their…\n\nLightfoot steals a used car from a dealership and crosses paths with a preacher named Thunderbolt who is running from a hitman. After helping him escape he learns that this preacher is actually a legendary criminal. The young thug and hardened criminal quickly form a friendship as they are hunted by some of Thunderbolt's old friends. With little to do but keep moving they devise a plan to rob a bank and take enough money to split and live happy lives.\n\nThunderbolt and Lightfoot is one of those random watches that I never heard about until recently when a Letterboxd friend shared a review. I saw Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges and knew I would have a decent time so…"
