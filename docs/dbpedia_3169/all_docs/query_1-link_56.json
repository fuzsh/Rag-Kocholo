        "text": "On November 12th on BluRay from Kino Lorber along with Don Siegel’s Charley Varrick comes one of the greatest buddy/road/crime movies, Michael Cimino’s directorial debut THUNDERBOLT & LIGHTFOOT starring Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges.\n\nOfficial Synopsis: Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) marked the directing debut of screenwriter Michael Cimino (The Deer Hunter, Heaven’s Gate), working under the meticulous guidance of star/producer Clint Eastwood. Eastwood plays a typically laconic loner, a big-time thief in hiding who hooks up with a goofy young drifter (Jeff Bridges, giving an Oscar-nominated performance). First attempting to escape from a couple of vengeful former partners (George Kennedy, Geoffrey Lewis), then joining forces with them to pull off a risky robbery, Eastwood and Bridges give us an ultimately touching portrait of masculine friendship. Superbly photographed in Montana’s Big Sky country by Frank Stanley, and featuring a score by Eastwood regular Dee Barton.\n\nSpecial Features: New 4K remastered edition • Audio Commentary by Nick Pinkerton • Featurette & more!"
