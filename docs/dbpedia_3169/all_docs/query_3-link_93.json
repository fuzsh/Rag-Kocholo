        "text": "From Michael Cimino, the legendary director of The Deer Hunter, Heaven’s Gate and Year of the Dragon, comes this bold, witty and tough crime-thriller starring screen icons Clint Eastwood (A Fistful of Dollars) and Jeff Bridges (Winter Kills) as a pair of modern-day outlaws. Thunderbolt (Eastwood) is a former thief whose razor-sharp wits and steely nerves made him a master of his profession, but he’s about to re-enter the criminal world with a new partner: Lightfoot (Bridges), a brash young drifter whose energy and exuberance give the veteran a new outlook on life. Their target: the seemingly impenetrable Montana Armored Depository. After forming an uneasy alliance with Thunderbolt’s former partners in crime, Red Leary (George Kennedy, Cool Hand Luke) and Eddie Goody (Geoffrey Lewis, High Plains Drifter), they launch an amazing scheme that will test the limits of their endurance, and the power of their friendship. Fueled by explosive action, fascinating characters and a powerfully moving climax, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot is an adventure of the highest caliber and the directorial debut for Cimino, who also wrote the original screenplay. Wonderfully shot in Scope by Frank Stanley (The Eiger Sanction) and featuring a wonderful supporting cast that includes Catherine Bach (The Midnight Man), Gary Busey (Lethal Weapon), Jack Dodson (The Getaway), Burton Gilliam (Gator), Roy Jenson (Framed), Bill McKinney (Deliverance), Vic Tayback (Bullitt), Dub Taylor (Junior Bonner) and Gregory Walcott (Prime Cut).\n\nProduct Extras :\n\nDISC 1 (4KUHD):\n\nBrand New HDR/Dolby Vision Master – From a 4K Scan of the 35mm Original Camera Negative\n\nAudio Commentary by Film Critic Nick Pinkerton\n\n5.1 Surround and 2.0 Lossless Audio\n\nTriple-Layered UHD100 Disc\n\nOptional English Subtitles\n\nDISC 2 (BLU-RAY):"
