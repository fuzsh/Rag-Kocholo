        "text": "Scoop's comments in yellow:\n\nThunderbolt and Lightfoot is one of those post-Butch Cassidy pictures about \"mismatched, kinda lovable, outlaw buddies\", filled with the usual 70's prerequisites: a team caper, unnecessary nudity, generational conflicts, sad unresolved endings\n\nIt's strange to look back and see the remarkable lack of violence as viewed with today's eyes. All the guards and bureaucrats who stand in the way of the baddies simply end up with a bad headache and rope burns. In today's context, all these bystanders would be slaughtered like cattle. The modern way is more realistic, of course. Desperate men on a seven minute mission, as they were here, don't have the time to knock people out and tie them up. But cultural standards dictate these sorts of things. Plus, the baddies were antiheroes, not true evildoers, and the marketing department would never have let the director show Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges slaughtering innocent people.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this movie is that it was the directorial debut of Michael Cimino. (Eastwood hired him. This is a Malpaso Films production. Cimino had previously written the script for Eastwood's \"Magnum Force\"). Cimino is a legend in Hollywood for many reasons. Immediately after Thunderbolt, he made a successful film which was also an acknowledged masterpiece, \"The Deer Hunter\". This took Cimino to superstar director status, and he was given the freedom and money to dictate his next project. That project turned out to be the notorious fiasco entitled \"Heaven's Gate\". Heaven's Gate came in late, way over budget, and generated a gross of only $1.5 million dollars to offset $44 million in costs, largely because it was pulled from distribution after about three days. The public hated it just as much as the critics, and the industry investment people hated it most of all. It is credited with single-handedly destroying United Artists, and forever changing the entire nature of the industry, effectively ending the heady 70s epoch when big name directors were given a free hand to make the pictures they wanted to make."
