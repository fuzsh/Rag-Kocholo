        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nMax Rosenberg, who over more than half a century produced dozens of low-budget movies, including ''Tales From the Crypt'' and the early rock 'n' roll movie ''Rock, Rock, Rock!,'' died on Monday in Los Angeles. He was 89.\n\nHis death was announced by Julie Moldo, vice president of Mr. Rosenberg's company, Rearguard Productions.\n\nThe son of a furrier, Mr. Rosenberg was born in New York and was a lawyer when he entered the film business in 1939 as a distributor of foreign films. He became a producer in 1954. With his partner, Milton Subotsky, he made ''Junior Science,'' an award-winning series of TV science programs for children.\n\nTheir movies included ''Rock, Rock, Rock!,'' produced in 1956. It starred Tuesday Weld and featured performances by Chuck Berry and Frankie Lymon and an appearance by the disc jockey Alan Freed.\n\n''It took nine days to make,'' Mr. Rosenberg recalled in a 2000 interview with The Hollywood Reporter. ''The exciting thing was collecting the music. As for the picture itself, there's not much to commend it. It's just a bunch of songs connected to a stupid plot.''\n\nMost of Mr. Rosenberg's movies involved horror or the supernatural. ''The Curse of Frankenstein,'' made in 1957, brought in $7 million.\n\nAfter forming Amicus Productions in England in 1962, Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Subotsky made popular horror anthologies, including ''Dr. Terror's House of Horrors'' and ''The House That Dripped Blood.''\n\n''They established themselves as one of the leading purveyors of supernatural, horror and suspense films during that period,'' said Dennis Bartok, head of programming at the American Cinematheque at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.\n\n''They worked with an amazingly talented pool of actors, including Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Joan Collins,'' Mr. Bartok said. ''They also helped foster the careers of younger actors like Donald Sutherland and Terrance Stamp and they often worked with excellent writers like Robert Bloch.''\n\nMr. Bartok said his friend also was proud of his nonhorror work, including ''The Birthday Party,\" in 1968, directed by William Friedkin.\n\nMr. Rosenberg is survived by his companion, Arlene Becker; his daughters, Elizabeth Rumelt and Naomi Rosenberg; and three grandchildren.\n\nCorrection: June 19, 2004, Saturday An obituary of the film producer Max Rosenberg yesterday misspelled the given name of an actor whose career was advanced by Mr. Rosenberg and his partner, Milton Subotsky. The actor is Terence Stamp, not Terrance."
