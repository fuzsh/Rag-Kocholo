He was one of the producers of The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), Hammer’s first big horror hit, and co-founder of Amicus, which specialised in horror anthologies with contemporary settings and provided Hammer with its main opposition in the genre during the next two decades.\n\nAn urbane New Yorker, noted for his charm, dapper dress sense and knowledge and appreciation of literature, Rosenberg nevertheless seemed finely tuned to the popular tastes of the day. While Hammer plundered Shelley and Stoker for material, Rosenberg turned to the less respectable and literally more graphic source that was horror comics. He was also quick to exploit the big-screen potential"
