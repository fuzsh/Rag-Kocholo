        "text": "American film and television producer and writer\n\nMilton Subotsky (September 27, 1921 – June 27, 1991) was an American film and television writer and producer.[2] In 1964, he founded Amicus Productions with Max J. Rosenberg. Amicus means \"friend\" in Latin.[3] The partnership produced low-budget science fiction and horror films in the United Kingdom.[4]\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nSubotsky was born in New York City, to a family of Jewish immigrants. During World War II, he served in the Signal Corps, in which he wrote and edited technical training films. After the war, he began a career as a writer and producer during the 1950s \"Golden Age\" of television, including the television series The Clock and Lights Out.\n\nIn 1954, he wrote and produced the TV series Junior Science. He graduated to film producing Rock, Rock, Rock (1956), for which he also composed nine songs. Subotsky moved to England; he produced his first horror film, The City of the Dead (aka, Horror Hotel, 1960), at Shepperton Studios.[4][5][6] He was a regular juror on Juke Box Jury on BBC Television in the early 1960s.\n\nAmicus Productions\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Amicus Productions\n\nIn 1964, with fellow expatriate producer Max J. Rosenberg, Subotsky formed the company Amicus Productions. Based at Shepperton Studios, they produced such films as Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1964), Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965), Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966), Torture Garden (1967), Scream and Scream Again (1970), The House That Dripped Blood (1970), Tales from The Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), From Beyond the Grave (1973) and The Land That Time Forgot (1974).[7]\n\nSword & Sorcery Productions\n\n[edit]\n\nAmicus was disestablished in 1975, but Subotsky continued producing. Around this time he formed Sword & Sorcery Productions, Ltd., with Frank Duggan.[8] At some point Andrew Donally joined the company. Numerous projects did not enter production. These include adaptations of Lin Carter's Thongor stories,[9] a live-action version of Stan Lee's The Incredible Hulk, film adaptations of stories that appeared in James Warren's comic magazines Creepy and Eerie,[8] and a co-production with former James Bond film producer Harry Saltzman on Saltzman's troubled[10] \"shrunken man\" epic The Micronauts.[11]\n\nUnable to purchase film rights to Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories,[12] Subotsky instead bought the rights to Carter's \"Thongor\" stories in 1976.[9] Subotsky himself adapted Carter's 1965 novel The Wizard of Lemuria. United Artists agreed to bankroll the project – now called Thongor in the Valley of Demons – in 1978, but subsequently withdrew for unspecified reasons.[9]\n\nSword & Sorcery's first film project to get off the ground was Dominique. In 1980, they co-produced the TV series The Martian Chronicles, adapted from the short story collection by Ray Bradbury. During the making of this miniseries, Subotsky and Donally parted ways.[13]\n\nLater career and death\n\n[edit]\n\nSubotsky also co-produced several adaptations of Stephen King novels, including Cat's Eye (1985), Maximum Overdrive (1986), Sometimes They Come Back (a 1991 TV film) and The Lawnmower Man (1992). The Director's Cut of the latter was dedicated to his memory.[5]\n\nSubotsky died of heart disease in 1991, at the age of 69.[14] His widow, Dr Fiona Subotsky, is a prominent London psychiatrist, and an historian of psychiatry.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nClose (Series) 1954\n\nJunior Science (Series) 1956\n\nRock Rock Rock! 1957\n\nJamboree! 1959\n\nCity of the Dead 1960\n\nThe Last Mile 1960\n\nIt's Trad, Dad! 1962\n\nRing A Ding Rhythm 1963\n\nJust for Fun 1963\n\nDr. Terror's House of Horrors 1965\n\nDr. Who and the Daleks 1965\n\nThe Skull 1965\n\nThe World of Abbott and Costello 1965\n\nThe Psychopath 1966\n\nThe Deadly Bees 1966\n\nDaleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. 1966\n\nThe Terrornauts 1967\n\nThey Came from Beyond Space 1967\n\nTorture Garden 1967\n\nDanger Route 1967\n\nThe Birthday Party 1968\n\nA Touch of Love 1969\n\nScream and Scream Again 1970\n\nThe Mind of Mr. Soames 1970\n\nThe House That Dripped Blood 1971\n\nI, Monster 1971\n\nTales from the Crypt 1972\n\nWhat Became of Jack and Jill? 1972\n\nAsylum 1972\n\nThe Vault of Horror 1973\n\nAnd Now the Screaming Starts! 1973\n\nFrom Beyond the Grave 1974\n\nThe Beast Must Die 1974\n\nMadhouse 1974\n\nThe Land That Time Forgot 1974\n\nAt the Earth's Core 1976\n\nThe People That Time Forgot 1977\n\nThe Uncanny 1977\n\nDominique 1979\n\nThe Martian Chronicles 1981 Mini Series\n\nThe Monster Club 1981\n\nCat's Eye 1985\n\nMaximum Overdrive 1986\n\nSometimes They Come Back 1991\n\nThe Lawnmower Man 1992\n\nSometimes They Come Back...
