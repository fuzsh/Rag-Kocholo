        "text": "Max Rosenberg was the 14th-place contestant on Ohio's Praise. He is also a former production crew member for Winter's Cold and the current Film Director.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMy name is Max Rosenberg and am a current 2nd year Political Science major from Cincinnati, Ohio. I’m an ambitious person who loves all kinds of strategy games (Survivor very much included!), sports, and I love to be challenged to think differently. People would describe me as caring, witty, calculated, and trustworthy. I’m also a very competitive person. Anytime there’s a game or competition that I’m involved in I often tend to emerge as the group’s leader and become laser focused on winning. Outside of all this, in my free time I like to play around with audio and create mashups.\n\nPre-Game Survey Answers[]\n\nContestant Name: Max Rosenberg\n\nMajor(s): Political Science\n\nMinor(s): International Relations & Diplomacy\n\nHometown: Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nBirthday: February 26, 1998\n\nWhat Are Your Major Campus Involvements?\n\nSurvivor T&C is really the only one at the moment. I want to devote as much time as I need to in order to win the game.\n\nWhat Are Three Words To Describe You?\n\nWitty, calculated, and driven.\n\nWhat Are Your Favorite Hobbies?\n\nOne of my biggest hobbies is making music mashups and remixes of popular songs.\n\nWhat Are You Most Passionate About?\n\nPolitics, and making positive changes through it.\n\nWhat Are Three Of Your Pet Peeves?\n\nPeople mispronouncing words, people who don’t use their blinkers, and anything sticky.\n\nWhat Is Your Personal Claim to Fame?\n\nHillary Clinton took a selfie with me once so I think that’s kinda cool.\n\nDo You Have Any Hidden/Special Talents?\n\nNothing amazingly special, but I think I’m pretty good cook.\n\nWhat Is One Goal You Have Set For Autumn 2018?\n\nOther than winning Survivor Time & Change it would be to continue getting better at my mashup and remix work.\n\nWho Is Your Inspiration In Life?\n\nMy mom. She’s such a caring, selfless, and driven person. She makes me want to be a better person every single day.\n\nWhat Is Your Dream Job?\n\nUltimate dream job is Secretary of State.\n\nIf You Could Live Anywhere In The World, Where Would It Be?\n\nHawaii.\n\nSurvivor Contestant You Are Most Like?\n\nProbably either John Cochran or Natalie Anderson.\n\nReason For Playing Survivor: Time & Change?\n\nI’m a competitor through and through. Any chance I get to help me win, I take it. I only got into watching Survivor over the past year but I fell in love with watching the show, but more importantly the game. When I heard that there was something at OSU where I could compete in a Survivor-style competition, I knew I had to give it a shot.\n\nWhy Will You Win?\n\nI will win Survivor Time & Change because while I may not be the most physical of a threat, I have the drive and strategic mindset necessary that will help me build the relationships I need to each and every week in order to get me to that final tribal council.\n\nAnything Else Cool You'd Like To Share?\n\nI have a blue beta fish named Felix :)"
