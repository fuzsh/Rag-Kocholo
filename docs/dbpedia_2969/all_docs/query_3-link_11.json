        "text": "Producer Max J. Rosenberg died June 14 in Los Angeles after a long illness. He was 89.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Saturday, June 26, at 4 p.m. at the Park La Brea Auditorium in Los Angeles.\n\nNew York-born and educated Rosenberg was an attorney who entered the film business as a distributor for foreign art films, later becoming a prolific producer of horror pics.\n\nIn 1945, Rosenberg formed Motion Picture Ventures in partnership with Joseph E. Levine to distribute foreign language and American-made pics. They handled films including “The Titan,” “Man of Aran,” “Edge of the World” and “Open City.”\n\nIn 1957, the duo, in association with Hammer Films, produced the first horror film shot in color — “The Curse of Frankenstein.”\n\nRosenberg’s credits include “Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors,” “The Deadly Bees,” “They Came From Beyond Space,” “Tales From the Crypt” and “The House That Dripped Blood.”\n\nThe duo produced close to 20 horror and sci-fi pics but also widened their scope to include projects such as “A Touch of Love,” “The Birthday Party” and “Lad, a Dog.”\n\nRosenberg is survived by his companion Arlene Becker, two daughters and three grandchildren.\n\nDonations may be made to the Isabel W. Rosenberg Story Hour, Jerusalem Foundation, 60 E. 42nd St., Suite 1936, New York, NY 10165."
