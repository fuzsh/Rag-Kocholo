        "text": "After WW2 experience, Milton Subotsky began his career in US television, producing and co-writing the youth musical Rock, Rock, Rock (US, d. Will Price, 1956) before moving to England in 1960.\n\nHe (with partner Max Rosenberg) launched Amicus Productions with the musical, It's Trad, Dad! (d. Richard Lester, 1962), but came into his own with films in the horror (e.g. The Skull, d. Freddie Francis, 1965), or science-fiction (e.g., Dr Who and the Daleks, d. Gordon Flemyng, 1965) modes, though the company occasionally produced other kinds of film, including a very non-commercial version of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party (d. William Friedkin, 1968). His TV work included The Martian Chronicles (US, d. Michael Anderson, 1979).\n\nBrian McFarlane, Encyclopedia of British Film"
