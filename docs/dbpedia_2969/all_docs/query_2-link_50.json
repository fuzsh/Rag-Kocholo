Moore\n\nRonald D. Moore\n\n2024 Outstanding Television Writer Award\n\nRonald D. Moore will receive the 2024 Outstanding Television Writer Award, celebrating his impactful contributions to the landscape of television through celebrated sci-fi shows including For All Mankind, Outlander, and Battlestar Galactica.\n\nAt AFF’s Writers Conference, happening October 24th – 27th, Moore’s career will be highlighted on two panels: “A Conversation with Ronald D. Moore”, a discussion about his career and body of work, and “Script to Screen: Battlestar Galactica”, an analysis of the seminal miniseries from concept to completion, complete with clips from the series.\n\nDeeply rooted in the sci-fi genre, Moore got his start in the entertainment business on the writing staff of Star Trek: The Next Generation. During his tenure there, he wrote or co-wrote 27 episodes, including the two-hour series finale All Good Things, for which he won a Hugo Award in 1994. That same year, Moore was honored with an Emmy® Award nomination and was eventually promoted to Producer. In 1994, Moore joined the writing staff of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as Supervising Producer and was elevated to Co-Executive Producer the following year. Moore spent five seasons on the series until the end of its successful run in 1999. Moore also served briefly as Executive Consultant on the USA cable series Good vs. Evil before joining the staff of Roswell as Executive Producer. After two seasons in that post, he took over the reins as Showrunner from creator Jason Katims in its final year. In the fall of 2002, Moore was named Showrunner and Executive Producer of HBO’s critically acclaimed one-hour drama Carnivàle.\n\nIn 2003, Moore created the re-imagined series, Battlestar Galactica, and served as Showrunner/Executive Producer of the series, which ran for four seasons.
