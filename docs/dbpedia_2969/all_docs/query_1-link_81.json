        "text": "Absolute criminal underutilized Wings Hauser.\n\nIt's filmed like a mocumentary, about a high school band trying to make it big with the pressures of sex and the expectations of their parents. Joan Collins has her way with one of the kids. Wings shows up 45 min in to the movie only to not be told he has gonorrhea, and then never shows again. its a garage band trying to make the big time and also get laid. Not really all that comical, not really all that dramatic. Joan Collins can't resist boy booty on a ladder.\n\nBirth Year Challenge â€“ 1982\n\n12/37 watched\n\nHomework is probably one of the worst teen sex comedies I have seen from the early 80s. Joan Collins is in the flick and lusting after her daughter's teen boyfriend. Mrs. Robinson, she is not. There is an awkward scene where she is groping him while he is doing household errands for her. The poster alludes to this scene in case you were wondering.\n\nThere are also weird fantasy scenes where the kid will say something to his therapist and then an out of place comedy skit appears. The upside is the rock band but the music isn't exactly good. At least the band looked like they were having fun, well they were to some degree.\n\nNormally, I am the champion for bizarre flicks from the 80s that most others have forgotten. I just cannot get behind this one. Believe me when I say that I have tried.\n\nAmbitious characterizations and pop exuberance powered by out of control hormonesâ€”itâ€™s a lot better than its reputation (ainâ€™t that always the case). Thereâ€™s a scattershot brilliance to the productionâ€”a way that movies were once put together before the totalitarian art school film people hermetically sealed the entire formâ€”it shifts from fumbling pleasures to grim outcomes but keeps a radiant bop in its step.\n\nThe girl who only wants to swim is one of the more accurate representations of women on screen.\n\nWhen Wings Hauser and Joan Collins (ðŸ¥µ) are the adults in the picture!\n\nNot good, but I loved the ending and what it implies about being young and full of dreams and constantly shifting interests and assuming you could succeed better than anybody in whatever field it is youâ€™re into that day. A shame it took until the final 20 seconds to get to a universal truth\n\nJoan sued over the misleading ad campaign that made it seem like she had a major role, and she was eight to do so! 39 years later, that poster definitely tricked me into wasting 90 minutes on a confused mishmash of horny teen sex comedy, VD PSA, and parents-just-donâ€™t-understand drama that barely has the Dame.\n\nOnly thing saving this from 1/2-star territory is a couple of laugh-out-loud lines. They may not be worth sitting through 90 minutes of garbage to hear, but theyâ€™re an unexpected delight for those suckered into watching this.\n\nAnother great release from Unearthed, the picture and sound were great. This was a cute bittersweet coming of age tale in the same vein as Lemon Popsicle/The Last American Vergin and American Pie. I feel like there is a whole darker ending that we didn't get to see, which could have made this a brilliant masterpiece but leaves you feeling like you just watched an afternoon special."
