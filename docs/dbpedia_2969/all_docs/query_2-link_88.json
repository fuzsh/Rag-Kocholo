Each year my co-programmer Ben Thompson and I try to do something different, and this year is no exception.”\n\nAdditionally, the ‘Tribeca at Home’ platform will allow U.S. audiences to enjoy an array of thought-provoking and compelling narrative, documentary, and short films, online from June 9 through June 26.\n\nThe Tribeca Festival is curated by Festival Director and VP of Programming Cara Cusumano, Artistic Director Frédéric Boyer; VP of Filmmaker Relations & Shorts Programming Sharon Badal and Head Shorts Programmer Ben Thompson; Senior Programmers Liza Domnitz and Lucy Mukerjee; Programmers José F.
