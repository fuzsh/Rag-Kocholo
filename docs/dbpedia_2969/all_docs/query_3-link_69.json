        "text": "There was a period in British culture - roughly the mid-60s to the late 70s - when making a movie on the cheap, getting it shown in cinemas and turning a profit was actually possible. Amicus studios, the brainchild of a socially inept scriptwriter called Milton Subotsky and a fast-talking hustler called Max J Rosenberg, hired everyone from Vincent Price to Joan Collins to star in hastily made horror movies with vague pretensions towards psychological depth. They even convinced Hollywood boy wonder William Friedkin to shoot an adaptation of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party. Remarkably, Subotsky and Rosenberg achieved this without having any money whatsoever, let alone a real studio.\n\nWhat Amicus did have was its own, original genre: the portmanteau horror. These involved an anthology of related segments, more often than not adapted from the short stories of Psycho author Robert Bloch. Amicus favourites included such titles as Dr Terror's House of Horrors (rail passengers get their Tarot cards read), Torture Garden (carnival sideshow reveals people's inner cruelties), Asylum (inmates are interviewed by a psychiatrist) and The House That Dripped Blood (a copper investigates four crimes in one building).\n\nAmicus films were typically brooding and claustrophobic; they were far darker, and much less camp, than the horror films of the same period produced by the more famous Hammer studios. The scripts tended to reflect Subotsky's obsessions. I, Monster, its Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde adaptation, is stuffed with Freudian theories because Subotsky's wife happened to be studying psychology at the time.\n\n\"Hammer was a business set-up,\" the late, legendary horror director Freddie Francis told this paper in 1995. \"Had it dealt in garbage disposal, it would have been just as successful. Milton Subotsky from Amicus, on the other hand, was a real horror buff.\"\n\nAmicus may have fashioned preposterous horror hokum out of love, but the studio came into being through hard-nosed opportunism. Rosenberg, a New Yorker, was a law graduate with a successful distribution company when he heard about the Eady plan, a British subsidy set up to funnel government money into movie production and encourage filming in the UK. Subotsky was a shy science-fiction film freak, also from New York, whose parents considered the movie industry disreputable. Nevertheless, he managed to get into the feature film business, producing Rock, Rock, Rock with Rosenberg in 1956, before he moved to England in 1960. In 1964, the pair came together again with the founding of Amicus to take advantage of the Eady plan.\n\nThe late Rosenberg called Amicus \"a studio without walls\". There was no capital structure, so films got made through a combination of private investment, funding from the Eady plan, and extremely low budgets. Its first proper production, 1965's Dr Terror's House of Horrors, was made for less than Â£100,000, yet starred horror giants Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and was directed by Francis, already an acclaimed cinematographer. Rosenberg's technique for attracting high-profile talent was simple: he hired them on a competitive day rate, but only for a few days, so shooting schedules were brisk. The House That Dripped Blood was filmed over a couple of weeks.\n\n\"Rosenberg, who was the money man, was always in America and we never met him,\" says Ingrid Pitt, the Polish-born actor who starred with Dr Who's Jon Pertwee as a sexy vampire in The House That Dripped Blood. \"But Milton was an angel. He was often on set and he had a way of making you feel wanted. We used to sit around and talk about medicine. He always thought he had something wrong with him.\"\n\nSubotsky was also driven by a deep-rooted hatred for Hammer. In 1956, Hammer had rejected a script he wrote called Frankenstein and the Monster, only to go on and have huge success with a similarly themed film called The Curse of Frankenstein. To Rosenberg, this proved there was money in British horror movies. To Subotsky, the gauntlet had been thrown down. \"Hammer seem happy to make the same film over and over again,\" he told an interviewer in the early 1970s. \"I'm always looking for something different.\" But Subotsky overestimated his own abilities. He not only made a misguided attempt to improve on Robert Louis Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde story with I, Monster; he insisted it be filmed in 3D. The film's young director, Stephen Weeks, could chop out Subotsky's monotonous dialogue about Freudian theory, but making the 3D effect work was almost impossible, because the sets had been built the wrong way round. The script called for the action to go from left to right, but the building lines went the other way.\n\n\"Milton Subotsky was a strange, nerdish character,\" says Weeks now. \"He wanted everyone to watch home movies of his damn kid.\" Subotsky ran out of money halfway through the production, but rather than give up, he simply told Weeks to cut whatever scenes he had filmed into something resembling a finished movie. The film was released to terrible reviews - but, like most Amicus films, it made a profit.\n\nSubotsky soldiered on, encouraged by Rosenberg, for whom critical lashings mattered little in the face of increasingly large financial returns. Subotsky's script for Tales from the Crypt, an anthology piece based on stories from 1950s pulp horror publishers EC Comics, was described by Variety as \"laughably melodramatic\". A review in Films Illustrated said: \"Much of the dialogue is risible throughout, and much of the playing incapable of overcoming the vast obstacle of the script.\" Yet Crypt, which stars Joan Collins as an unfaithful wife who kills her husband only to be killed herself by a man dressed as Santa Claus, was one of the most successful films of 1972. It was second only to The Godfather at the US box office, and spawned a follow-up, The Vault of Horror.\n\nOne of Amicus's most notorious titles was Asylum, also made in 1972, another compendium piece based on short stories by Bloch - this time revolving around the psychological aberrations of inmates at a psychiatric hospital. Needless to say, Subotsky was incapable of leaving Bloch to his own devices, adding gratuitous scenes of limbs crawling across floors to the writer's original script. But Asylum's director, Roy Ward Baker, created a mood of sinister threat, and Subotsky assembled a starry cast: the best story features Charlotte Rampling as a schizophrenic whose murderous alter ego is played by Britt Ekland. Following a now-familiar pattern, Asylum opened to atrocious reviews and huge returns.\n\nFor reasons that remain unclear, Subotsky lost heart in Amicus in the wake of its biggest successes. In 1975, the studio released an adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' lost-world adventure The Land That Time Forgot. It had proved a difficult film to shoot: its star, Doug McClure, was drinking heavily after the collapse of his marriage, while Subotsky was rumoured to be spending more time at Hamleys buying toys than running the studio. His only real involvement with the production was to turn up at a screening with his four-year-old-son, announce that the boy could tell there were men inside the dinosaur suits, and leave. Soon afterwards, Subotsky withdrew from the company and launched a lawsuit against his former partner that dragged on for the next five years - largely because the company had been set up on nothing more than a handshake.\n\nRosenberg kept Amicus alive for two more years. The studio's swansong was a terrible science-fiction western called Welcome to Blood City. Rosenberg cut his ties with the British film industry, set up a distribution company in California and produced films such as the Natassja Kinski-starring Cat People. Subotsky lurched from one disastrous production to another until dying of heart disease in 1991. Rosenberg kept working well into his 80s, dying in 2004 aged 90.\n\nThe Amicus story should have ended when Subotsky walked off in a huff in 1975. But the films have endured, growing in cult status as the years pass. There's something about the way they were made on a wing and a prayer that gives them charm, while the underlying themes of paranoia, neurosis and sexual repression - Subotsky's preoccupations, it seems - give some measure of depth behind the wooden dialogue and hammy acting.\n\nIn 2006, the US producer Robert Katz felt the Amicus name was worth reviving, and set up the label again. The second film from the reborn Amicus Entertaiment was the cult Stuart Gordon flick Stuck. Starring Stephen Rea and Mena Suvari, it re-established Amicus as a name to conjure with. Now the company is preparing to remake The House That Dripped Blood and Dr Terror's House of Horrors.\n\nAmicus thrived in recession-hit 1970s Britain, when a combination of cheap production values and scary, silly fantasy suited the mood of the times. Perhaps its hour has come again."
