        "text": "And Now the Screaming Starts (1973)\n\nAnchor Bay UK Region 2 DVDA straight forward ghost story that manages to be very scary and effective thanks to superb acting and direction.\n\nHighly recommended.Asylum (1972)\n\nAnchor Bay UK Region 2 DVDOne of the lesser anthology films, with no particularly outstanding stories despite getting the longest run times of any of the films.\n\nOnly for fans of the studio.At the Earth's Core (1976)\n\nUK Cinema Club Region 2 DVDAn enjoyably daft fantasy adventure film with a great eccentric performance from Peter Cushing.\n\nRecommended.The Beast Must Die (1974)\n\nAnchor Bay UK Region 2 DVDThe last Amicus horror film, an entertaining if rather daft werewolf film with a good cast.\n\nPartly recommended.City of the Dead (1960)\n\nUS VCI Region 1 DVDThe first horror film made by the producers, under the Vulcan Pictures name and a very effective and creepy film.\n\nHighly recommended.Daleks Invasion Earth: 2150 AD (1966)\n\nUK Optimum Region 2 DVDThe second Dr. Who film and a lot more successful and enjoyable - a good cast, including Peter Cushing, Andrew Keir and Bernard Cribbins.\n\nRecommended.Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965)\n\nAnchor Bay UK Region 2 DVDThe first of the studio's anthology horror films is quite hit and miss, but always enjoyable, with a good cast.\n\nRecommendedDr. Who and the Daleks (1965)\n\nUK Optimum Region 2 DVDAn enjoyable family film, although often rather brief on plot detail. Makes a lot of changes from the TV series mythos.\n\nPartly recommended.The House that Dripped Blood (1970)\n\nAnchor Bay UK Region 2 DVDProbably the strongest overall Amicus anthology, with their best comic story, and three good horror tales, with some superb direction.\n\nRecommended.The Land that Time Forgot (1975)\n\nUK Cinema Club Region 2 DVDA noticably poorly thought out script lets down this otherwise entertaining fantasy adventure film.\n\nNot recommended.Madhouse (1974)\n\nUS MGM Region 1 DVDPeter Cushing and Vincent price star in this film with an interesting idea but no drive and over-long.\n\nNot recommended.Tales from the Crypt (1972)\n\nUS Fox Region 1 DVDThe studio's biggest success, but a rather weak film, the two good stories are surrounded by some real duds.\n\nWorth watching for Peter Cushing's chapter alone."
