        "text": "This article is updated frequently as titles leave and enter Max. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nWant a good scare tonight? Check out the haunted-and-stalked section of Max (the streaming service formerly known as HBO Max), which features a dense catalogue of genre films from all eras. From legit classics in the Criterion section through the hits of the ’80s and ’90s to today’s theatrical blockbusters, Max knows a thing or two about horror. Its selection is so rich that we will be rotating out entries in this horror guide regularly, so please check back often … if you dare.\n\nHow We Pick Our Films\n\nCritic Brian Tallerico watches and writes about movies and TV every day. To curate this list, he dives into Max’s catalogue every month to surface terrifying horror titles — using his taste and a lifetime of cinema study as his guide, instead of whatever the algorithm happens to be pushing. After triple-checking to make sure they’re still available, he watches each and writes his recommendation. We highlight more than just the crowd-pleasers: Filmmakers can use horror to craft spine-tingling moods, keep audiences on their toes, and comment on culture. Read on to find something to watch.\n\nThe Amityville Horror\n\nYear: 1979\n\nRuntime: 1h 59m\n\nDirector: Stuart Rosenberg\n\nThere have been dozens of movies that have capitalized on the allegedly true story at the center of this horror classic, a movie that spawned not just sequels but an entire brand of haunted house cinema. The first is still the best. The tale of a young couple (James Brolin & Margot Kidder) who buy a house with some very dark secrets.\n\nCarnival of Souls\n\nYear: 1962\n\nRuntime: 1h 18m\n\nDirector: Herk Harvey\n\nOne of the best horror movies ever made, Herk Harvey’s film is an early cult classic, made for almost no money and became an influential masterpiece. Candace Hilligoss plays a woman who starts having terrifying visions after surviving a car accident. These visions lead her to an abandoned carnival. You can see this film’s DNA in hundreds of horror movies to follow, but it’s still wonderfully creepy when judged on its own terms.\n\nCarrie\n\nYear: 1976\n\nRuntime: 1h 39m\n\nDirector: Brian De Palma\n\nLong before Stephen King was an entire industry, he was the guy who wrote Carrie, a 1974 novel about a bullied teen girl who unleashes hell on her classmates. Every once in a while, there’s a perfect combination of source material and creatives, and that’s what happened when King, De Palma, and Sissy Spacek combined forces here. Horror movie history would be made. Note: The underrated Chloe Grace Moretz remake is also on Max.\n\nEvil Dead Rise\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 37m\n\nDirector: Lee Cronin\n\nA hit in theaters, Warner Brothers shuffled its horror smash over to Max, free for subscribers. Rebooting the Evil Dead series for the second time (after the successful 2013 iteration), this one moves the action to an L.A. apartment building where a single mother (the phenomenal Alyssa Sutherland) gets taken over by the same evil force that once terrorized poor Ash. Twisted and clever, this gruesome horror flick was so successful that it feels like a sixth film in the series won’t take a decade to rise from the dead.\n\n*The Eyes of My Mother\n\nYear: 2016\n\nRuntime: 1h 17m\n\nDirector: Nicolas Pesce\n\nMake sure the kids and grandparents are sound asleep before you watch one of the most disturbing movies on Hulu. Nicolas Pesce black-and-white indie film is a brutal look at the dark side of humanity. If you’re at all squeamish about sharp objects and soft body parts, you might want to go back to the comedy list right about now.\n\nFright Night\n\nYear: 1985\n\nRuntime: 1h 47m\n\nDirector: Tom Holland\n\nTom Holland’s 1985 classic is one of the best horror movies of its era, a movie that plays with vampire tropes but also updates them in a fresh way. It’s basically Dracula meets Rear Window in the story of a boy who discovers that he lives next door to a creature of the night. Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowall are fantastic in a movie that is still influencing horror flicks 35 years later (and the remake is pretty solid too).\n\nFunny Games\n\nYear: 1997\n\nRuntime: 1h 50m\n\nDirector: Michel Haneke\n\nMichael Haneke is one of the most daring filmmakers alive, willing to shock viewers to make a point. Perhaps his most divisive film remains this 1997 shocker about a family who are essentially held hostage in their vacation home in Austria. Over the course of the day, the criminals basically torture this family, and through fourth-wall breaks, Haneke interrogates why people would even want to watch something like this, illuminating what art can reveal about the dark side of humanity.\n\nIt Comes at Night\n\nYear: 2017\n\nRuntime: 1h 32m\n\nDirector: Trey Edward Shults\n\nTrey Edward Shults is quickly becoming one of the most important directors of his generation with his personal debut Krisha and one of the more divisive films of the last few years, Waves. In between is this daring film that A24 kind of sold too much as a horror film, turning off viewers expecting something more traditional. It’s a mood piece about trust and survival starring Joel Edgerton, Christopher Abbott, Carmen Ejogo, Riley Keough, and a guy who still feels like he’s just on the verge of stardom, Kelvin Harrison Jr.\n\nThe Lighthouse\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 1h 50m\n\nDirector: Robert Eggers\n\nIs this the best COVID lockdown movie? Sure, it came out the year before, but a lot of people watched it on streaming while they were going crazy with people with whom they were stuck. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are fearless in Robert Eggers’ black-and-white nightmare about two people who learn that nothing is scarier than being trapped with someone unbearable. It’s a twisted gem.\n\nMidsommar\n\nYear: 2019\n\nAmazon Prime has lost its exclusive access to Ari Aster and A24’s excellent Midsommar, which means it’s now available on other streaming services. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor play a couple who go to Sweden for a festival that goes horribly awry. A comedy of cultures gives way to something much darker when the true purpose of the festival is revealed in a series of final scenes you’ll never forget.\n\nNight of the Living Dead\n\nYear: 1968\n\nRuntime: 1h 37m\n\nDirector: George A. Romero\n\nThe movie that changed it all. It’s really hard to overstate the impact that George A. Romero’s classic black-and-white masterpiece had on not just the zombie genre but DIY microbudget horror filmmaking in general. So many people have been chasing that game-changing impact of Night of the Living Dead in the half-century since it came out, but it’s the original that’s passed the test of time.\n\nParanormal Activity\n\nYear: 2009\n\nRuntime: 1h 27m\n\nDirector: Oren Peli\n\nOne of the most profitable films of all time, this found-footage blockbuster was notoriously made for only $15K (before postproduction) and ended up grossing almost $200 million worldwide, launching a franchise that’s still going over 15 years later. A formative film in the found-footage genre, it stars Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat as a young couple who set up cameras in their house to document the supernatural presence they feel. What they find changed indie-horror-movie history. Note: Several sequels are also on Max.\n\nPet Sematary\n\nYear: 1989\n\nRuntime: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Mary Lambert\n\nForget that junky 2019 remake (or the even junkier 2023 prequel) and stick with the first adaptation of the Stephen King novel from the 1980s about a cemetery that brings pets back to life. Based on the 1983 novel of the same name, this is a timeless tale of not messing with the power of life and death, in which a family makes an impossible decision after a tragedy and learns their lesson the very hard way.\n\nPiranha\n\nYear: 2010\n\nRuntime: 1h 28m\n\nDirector: Alexandre Aja\n\nSadly, it’s not 3-D on Max, but you can use your imagination. Alexandre Aja helmed his loose remake of the B-movie classic about a school of piranha that causes bloody chaos at a waterside resort. Elisabeth Shue and Adam Scott totally understand that this movie needs to be as over-the-top as possible, and they play along wonderfully with the tone of this entertaining remake. (Note: Piranha 3DD is also streaming on Max.)\n\nScream\n\nYear: 1996\n\nRuntime: 1h 51m\n\nDirector: Wes Craven\n\nThe Ghostface killer came back in January 2022 with the release of Scream, the fifth film in this franchise and the first since the death of Wes Craven, and the fun continued with another sequel in 2023 (before the wheels came off in the pre-production of a seventh film). Even the makers of the new movies would suggest that fans go back and watch the original films to see how Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) got here. All four of the Craven films are available now on Max. The first movie is still a flat-out genre masterpiece.\n\nThe Shining\n\nYear: 1980\n\nRuntime: 2h 23m\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\n\nThe most popular adaptation of a Stephen King novel is also the one the writer notoriously hated. Radically changing key elements, including the ending, Stanley Kubrick made the movie his own and made movie history. One of the most iconic horror films ever made, this one has lost none of its power in the four-decades-plus since it was released. It’s still a terrifying study in claustrophobic horror with one of Jack Nicholson’s most unforgettable performances.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\n\nYear: 1991\n\nRuntime: 1h 58m\n\nDirector: Jonathan Demme\n\nMovies don’t get much better than Jonathan Demme’s adaptation of Thomas Harris’s chilling thriller about Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter. With career-defining performances from Jodie Foster and Sir Anthony Hopkins, this movie still absolutely slays a quarter-century after it was released. It’s fascinating to see its DNA in so many modern genre films. Nothing about it is dated, which can’t be said about many films that are three decades old.\n\n*The Sixth Sense\n\nYear: 1999\n\nRuntime: 1h 48m\n\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan\n\nIt wasn’t technically his debut film, but this is the movie that put Shyamalan on the map, a genre crossover hit so enormous that it was nominated for Best Picture. It’s also arguably still his best film, a ghost tale that has held up beautifully, thanks to empathetic writing, great performances, and that unforgettable twist.\n\nSplice\n\nYear: 2009\n\nRuntime: 1h 44m\n\nDirector: Vincenzo Natali\n\nHorror movies don’t get much crazier than this 2009 offering from Vincenzo Natali, produced by Guillermo del Toro. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley star as genetic engineers who go a little too far in playing God, creating a creature they name Dren. And then things get really weird. Audiences basically ignored Splice when it came out, but it’s gained a cult following in the many years since.\n\nThe Strangers\n\nYear: 2008\n\nRuntime: 1h 26m\n\nDirector: Bryan Bertino\n\nLoosely based on a true story, The Strangers is one of the best home invasion flicks of the modern era. It’s the terrifyingly relatable story of a couple, played by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, who are attacked in their vacation home in the middle of the night. Made for almost nothing, this tense film was a huge smash, tapping into something we all fear could happen when we hear a strange sound outside in the middle of the night.\n\nUnder the Skin\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRuntime: 1h 49m\n\nDirector: Jonathan Glazer\n\nA trippy sci-fi masterpiece, this flick stars Scarlett Johansson as an alien being exploring the world around her and, well, doing some terrifying things to the men she comes in contact with — though that description only scratches the surface of why this is a special movie, a terrifying tone piece that has more in common with Twin Peaks than with Species. It’s unforgettable and brilliant, one of the best films of the ’10s.\n\nThe Visit\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 1h 34m\n\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan\n\nIt feels like everyone is back to digging Shyamalan’s undeniably original voice, but people forget that he desperately needed a comeback after the damage of films like The Last Airbender and After Earth in the early 2010s. That came in the form of this horror found footage film about a couple of kids who go to visit their truly creepy grandparents. Clever, funny, and twisted, The Visit really launched its creator back to the forefront of the horror genre.\n\nThe Witch\n\nYear: 2016\n\nRuntime: 1h 32m\n\nDirector: Robert Eggers\n\nThe directorial debut of the future director of The Lighthouse and The Northman was an instant hit for A24 and a film that felt like nothing else on the market. Anya Taylor-Joy made her film debut in this tale set in the 1630s as a Puritan family faces an evil entity in the woods near their home. With stunning sound design and unforgettable visuals, it’s one of the best horror movies of its era.\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
