        "text": "Click here to read the full article.\n\nStreamer HBO Max has set its pilot slate, handing out pilot orders to three projects — one-hour drama The Rules of Magic, from writer Melissa Rosenberg (Marvel’s Jessica Jones); half-hour dramedy Generation, from 17-year-old Zelda Barnz, her father Daniel Barnz and executive producer Lena Dunham; and hourlong YA drama Red Bird Lane, from writer Sara Gran (Southland) and executive produced by John Wells.\n\nThe Rules of Magic, which also has received a 10-script order and has opened a writers room, and Red Bird Line hail from HBO Max sister studio Warner Bros TV, where Rosenberg and Wells are under overall deals; Generation is being produced by HBO Max.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nSteven Soderbergh's 'Let Them All Talk' Movie With Meryl Streep Lands At HBO Max\n\nEllen Barkin Addresses 'Animal Kingdom' Exit And Penultimate Episode Shocker\n\nOff-Net Spree: HBO Max Zeroes In On Mega Deal For 'The Big Bang Theory' & 'Two And A Half Men' As 'Seinfeld' Hits Marketplace\n\nWritten by Rosenberg and & Dana Baratta (Marvel’s Jessica Jones), The Rules of Magic is based on Alice Hoffman’s novels The Rules of Magic and Practical Magic, the latter of which was adapted into the 1998 Warner Bros movie of the same name starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.\n\nAn epic generational family drama set in 1960s New York City, The Rules of Magic is a Practical Magic prequel which centers on three troubled siblings — Franny, Jet and Vincent Owens — who wrestle with “abnormalities” that have kept them isolated. But the tumultuous times unearth the extraordinary discovery that they are, in fact, descendants of a bloodline of witches. In their aspirational journey towards self-discovery and self-acceptance, they’ll contend with grief, war, bigotry and dark magic, not to mention a centuries-old curse designed to keep them away from love. The two sisters, Franny and Jet, will become the revered, and sometimes feared, aunts in Practical Magic, while their beloved brother Vincent will leave an unexpected legacy.\n\nRosenberg executive produces via her Tall Girls Productions, along with Dana Baratta; both also serve as showrunners. The 1998 film’s producer, Denise Di Novi, and Nina Tassler also executive produce for PatMa Productions, along with Hoffman.\n\nGeneration is created by Zelda Barnz, the 17-year-old daughter of Daniel and Ben Barnz. Written and directed by Zelda and Daniel Barnz, Generation is a dark yet playful half-hour dramedy that follows a group of high school students whose exploration of modern sexuality (devices and all) tests deeply entrenched beliefs about life, love and the nature of family in their conservative community.\n\nGeneration reportedly grew out of Zelda’s desire to see herself honestly (not sensationally) represented and to give herself and her peers an authentic voice. That is what Dunham did with her HBO comedy series Girls, which was hailed as an honest and authentic look at twentysomething women. Generation also was originally set up at HBO, which is exploring similar themes with new drama series Euphoria.\n\nDunham executive produces with Daniel and Ben Barnz for We’re Not Brothers Productions. Zelda Barnz is co-executive producer. Marissa Diaz is a producer.\n\nYA drama Red Bird Lane is written and executive produced by Gran. It is a morality and psychological horror series about eight strangers who arrive at an isolated house—all for different reasons—and quickly realize that something sinister and terrifying awaits them.\n\nWells and Erin Jontow executive produce for John Wells Productions. Dan Halsted is consulting producer.\n\nThis is one of several streaming projects for John Wells Prods. The company’s slate also includes romantic drama My Ex-Life, which has been in talks at Apple.\n\nGran is repped by Manage-Ment and attorney Ryan Nord. Daniel and Ben Barnz are repped by attorney James Feldman. Zelda Barnz is repped by attorney James Feldman.\n\nHBO Max, which is set to launch in spring 2020, is employing a full range of development models including script development, writers rooms, pilot orders and straight-to-series pickups.\n\nHere are detailed credits for the three pilots:\n\nGeneration\n\nLogline: A dark yet playful half-hour, GENERATION follows a group of high school students whose exploration of modern sexuality (devices and all) tests deeply entrenched beliefs about life, love and the nature of family in their conservative community.\n\nGenre: Dramedy\n\nFormat: Half-Hour\n\nCreated by: Zelda Barnz\n\nWriters / Directors: Zelda Barnz & Daniel Barnz\n\nExecutive Producer: Daniel and Ben Barnz for We’re Not Brothers Productions\n\nCo-Executive Producer: Zelda Barnz\n\nProducer: Marissa Diaz\n\nRed Bird Lane\n\nLogline: Morality and psychological horror series about eight strangers who arrive at an isolated house—all for different reasons—and quickly realize that something sinister and terrifying awaits them.\n\nGenre: Drama, YA\n\nFormat: One hour\n\nStudio: WBTV\n\nExecutive Producer / Writer: Sara Gran (BERLIN STATION, SOUTHLAND) Please note, writer and EP Sara Gran is represented by Manage-Ment and Attorney, Ryan Nord.\n\nExecutive Producers: John Wells and Erin Jontow for JWP\n\nConsulting Producer: Dan Halsted\n\nRules of Magic\n\nLogline: In this epic, generational family drama set in 1960s New York City, three troubled siblings — Franny, Jet and Vincent Owens — wrestle with “abnormalities” that have kept them isolated.
