Holy cow, it's the best. I don't know where to start so I'm just going to list things:\n\n1) Dr. Ted Nelson is the absolute best. As my fiance put it, he perpetually looks like he's misplaced his wallet. Like he's just slightly annoyed and put upon in every situation he finds himself in. Like he's misplaced his wallet and he's not completely late, but like he could be if he doesn't find it RIGHT NOW.\n\nWe were dying when the movie cuts to him at least three separate times rolling his eyes and huffing when the police officer is berating him for not divulging classified information. Or when he asks…\n\nIf we had to give a list of cult B directors in the 70s we should name William Sachs. A guy who became famous for making low budget Sci-Fi movies and since I met him I knew about The Incredible Melting Man for the first time thanks to a forum about horror movies, I saw it about 10 years ago and yesterday on a retro tapes stream channel I came across it again.\n\nThe plot is quite simple and has no degree of complexity: An astronaut returns from a trip to Saturn affected by a strange ailment that causes his body to melt and he needs to absorb the flesh of humans. The truth is that the story does not…\n\nIt must have been disheartening for the director, William Sachs, when the studio made him take what was supposed to be a loving spoof of atomic age horror films and make a litany of changes, turning his film into exactly what he had intended to parody. Unforced self-parody. Ouch.\n\nReading about the production history, certainly helped to explain the meandering nature of The Incredible Melting Man, a movie with very little plot, revolving around an astronaut who has been exposed to cosmic rays while exploring the rings of Saturn. After returning to Earth, he begins to melt. In a panic, he escapes the hospital, and begins to terrorize the locals, driven by his hunger to consume copious amounts of human…\n\nA gross-out tonally uneven quasi-slasher masterclass in practical effects. What more could you ask for?\n\nAfter suffering a radiation accident in a trip to saturn, Alex Rebar became... The Incredible Melting Man!\n\nBack on earth, his tragic existence now consists of reluctantly killing and consuming flesh to stay alive whilst evading capture and melting profusely.\n\nReading about the film brings up stories of producer interference, altering the original script from a parody of horror to a straight horror. Which would explain the odd tonal shifts and odd sections of comedy that without reading up would seem unintentional. Obviously I hate to see producers and studios altering the original visions for films and would love to have seen the film and…\n\nGeoff T's Hoop-Tober 7.0 Challenge\n\nThe Incredible Melting Man (1977)\n\nI mean, he certainly melts, but I think calling him \"incredible\" is a bit of a stretch.\n\nNot sure why I picked this one, but for whatever reason I've always have a soft-spot for this incredibly trashy sci-fi flick, that's almost like a car-wreck you can't take your eyes away from. That may be a little harsh I guess, but this movie is most certainly not great. Boring though? I'd have to disagree heavily in that regard.\n\nSo Steve West is an astronaut who is exposed to harsh cosmic rays during an ill-fated trip to Saturn. After being returned back to Earth (somehow), he wakes up as a hideous mutant…\n\nHe's melting faster than a dang ice cream cone on a hot summer day!\n\nI love this absurd film. The awesome special effects, the grindhouse feels, the dramatic acting and ridiculous story. Basically an astronaut flies too close to the rings of Saturn which starts a chain reaction of slow meltage and pure abrasive behavior. The more he melts the more mean and violent he becomes. I still kinda felt sorry for the guy though.\n\nI love the almost psychedelic and artsy elements like the random slow motion sequences and focused camera shots. The scene where the guy is beheaded as the camera closely follows his head floating down the river is the best thing ever. So casual yet bizarre.…\n\nYou know that piece of dialogue in Spinal Tap where David St Hubbins opines how fine a line it is between stupid and clever? This film is that line.\n\nThis has a massively entertaining and gory first half an hour, then just drops off a cliff. The second act of The Incredible Melting Man is incredibly interminable. Unless of course you find octogenarians stealing oranges or a guy in a Halloween mask with jizz dripping down his head standing around outside of houses scintillating stuff. There’s also a showstopper set piece where a crabby old colonel enjoys a Turkey leg and a bottle of beer.\n\nBut it would be impossible to keep up the pace they had going with those…"
