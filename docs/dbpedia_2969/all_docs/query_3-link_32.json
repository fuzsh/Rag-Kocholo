(1962), and two films based on the Doctor Who British science-fiction television series: Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965) and Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D. (1966). He was particularly proud to have produced the 1968 film of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party, starring Robert Shaw and directed by William Friedkin.
