        "text": "With his Savile Row tweed suits, hand-made shirts from Jermyn Street and English county cricket caps, Max Rosenberg, who has died aged 89, hardly looked like what he really was: a successful producer of horror movies. He accentuated the effect with an eloquent speaking manner and a vast collection of serious literature, which also inspired him to make serious films.\n\nAlthough born in the Bronx, New York, Rosenberg was a lifelong Anglophile, retaining a close interest in the royal family and importing his cricket caps via an English expatriate friend, the New York film producer Richard Gordon.\n\nRosenberg lived in London from 1955 until 1981, but ended his days in Hollywood. \"I had a flat in Curzon street, Mayfair, above the Mirabelle restaurant,\" he recalled. \"In those days, it was the finest restaurant in town. Nothing but the best for a Jewish-American horror movie producer ...\"\n\nRosenberg had his first major success with The Curse Of Frankenstein (1957), starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, filmed in association with Hammer Films for $500,000. The first of the genre to be produced in colour, the film earned an astonishing $7m and launched a revival of gothic suspense thrillers.\n\nWith his partner Milton Subotsky and their Amicus Productions, founded in Britain in 1962, he went on to produce classics such as Dr Terror's House Of Horrors (1965), The House That Dripped Blood (1971), both with Cushing and Lee, and Tales From The Crypt (1972), with Joan Collins and Curt Jurgens.\n\nRosenberg also had a flair for catchy advertising, and was most proud of his invention for City Of The Dead in 1960. The film was renamed Horror Hotel for US release, and he composed the tag line \"Just ring for doom service.\"\n\nAnother talent was spotting profitable trends, and he successfully produced early rock'n'roll films such as Rock, Rock, Rock! (1956), with the teenage Tuesday Weld - her voice dubbed by Connie Francis - and music by Chuck Berry. Jamboree (1957) included appearances by rock legends Fats Domino, Frankie Avalon, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins, as well as the Count Basie Orchestra and singer Joe Williams. It's Trad, Dad! was a 1962 comedy, directed by the young Richard Lester, with Chubby Checker, Del Shannon, Gary Bonds, Gene Vincent and Helen Shapiro.\n\nAmong Rosenberg's serious films were an adaptation of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party (1968), directed by William Friedkin; Thank You All Very Much (1969), with Sandy Dennis and Ian McKellen; and Langishe, Go Down. Adapted for the screen by Harold Pinter, it starred Judi Dench and Jeremy Irons, and was screened by the BBC in 1978. Rosenberg spent more than 20 years getting back the copyright, and was working on its British cinema distribution before he died.\n\nThe son of a furrier, Rosenberg graduated from New York City College and St John Law School. He first worked as a lawyer, and then in film distribution, before going into partnership with showman Joe Levine in 1945 to import art-house films into America. They distributed the 1959 remake of The Blue Angel; Man Of Aran, the 1934 classic documentary of Irish fishermen; Roberto Rossellini's story of the Italian resistance, Open City (1945); and several Michael Powell pictures, including The Edge Of The World (1937), about an isolated Shetland community.\n\nAltogether, Rosenberg produced 75 feature films and encouraged such young actors as Terence Stamp, Donald Sutherland and Joan Collins. Well into his 80s, he would arrive in the Wiltshire Boulevard office of his company, Rearguard Productions, at 6.30am and put in a full day's work. Los Angeles film historian Dennis Bartok said Rosenberg was a leading postwar producer of supernatural, horror and suspense films, and \"probably the best-read person I ever met\".\n\nRosenberg's wife of 57 years, Isabel Weinstein, a kindergarten teacher, died in 1991. He is survived by his companion Arlene Becker, and two daughters from his marriage."
