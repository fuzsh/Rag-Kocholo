        "text": "Since being named the Vice President and Director of Athletics at the University of Toledo in 2022, Bryan B. Blair has led Toledo to unprecedented success, on and off the field, positioning the Rockets as one of the nation’s premier Group of Five athletic departments.\n\nBlair is the 14th Director of Athletics at the University of Toledo. When he arrived at Toledo, Blair was the youngest FBS Director of Athletics in the nation. He joined the Rockets after serving as the Deputy Director of Athletics and Chief Operating Officer at Washington State University from 2018 to 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, Blair was given the honor of being named to Sports Business Journal’s 2024 “Forty Under 40” class. During his tenure at Toledo, Blair has enhanced collaboration with the campus and the Toledo community, increased revenue generation, focused on community engagement, and strengthened student-athlete support.\n\nThe Rockets have enjoyed record-breaking athletic and academic success under Blair’s leadership. As a program, Toledo won the Mid-American Conference’s 2022-23 Cartwright Award for its overall excellence in academics, athletics and citizenship. It was the second consecutive Cartwright Award during Blair’s tenure. Toledo also won the Reese Trophy as the top men's athletic program in the MAC in both the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons. In 2023-24, Toledo won the Reese and Jacoby trophies as the top women’s and men’s athletic departments in MAC. This was the first time in Toledo history to win both awards in the same year, capping an unprecedented two-year stretch of athletic excellence.\n\nToledo won six MAC Championships in 2022-23, twice the previous record of three, claiming league titles in football, men’s basketball, women’s basketball, women’s cross country, men’s tennis, and women’s tennis. Toledo became the first school in the history of the NCAA FBS to win league titles in these six sports in the same school year, and one of only three schools ever to win outright titles in football, men's basketball, and women's basketball in the same year. In the 2023-24 school year, the Rockets won MAC titles in men’s basketball, women’s basketball, women’s cross country, men’s tennis and women’s tennis, giving the program an unprecedented 11 league championships over two seasons.\n\nOn the gridiron, Toledo Football has experienced its most successful two-year period since 2000-01, winning a MAC championship and bowl game in 2022, and 11 straight wins with multiple appearances in the AP Top 25 in 2023. In 2024, Toledo DB Quinyon Mitchell became the first Rocket selected in the first round of the NFL Draft in 31 years.\n\nBasketball has also enjoyed high-level success with the men winning their fourth straight outright regular season championship in 2024, while the women won their third straight regular season championship title. In 2024, the women’s team advanced to the quarterfinals of the inaugural WBIT while the 2023 team won their first-round game in the NCAA Tournament over No. 5 seed and Big 12 champion Iowa State.\n\nThe Rockets have also excelled in the classroom under Blair, setting new standards for academic achievement. Toledo won the 2022-23 MAC Institutional Academic Award for the highest overall grade point average in the conference (3.437 GPA). Toledo student-athletes earned a combined 3.401 grade point average in the fall of 2022, a record for the fall semester at the time, and then topped that with an all-time record GPA of 3.472 in the spring of 2023. The Rockets then set a new mark for the fall by registering a 3.423 GPA in the 2023 fall semester.\n\nAn aggressive approach to name-image-likeness (NIL) has been a hallmark of Blair’s tenure and has led to a surge of NIL support, leading the conference in nearly every category. The Rockets were the first school in the MAC to have a collective supporting the institution, the first to partner with Campus Ink for exclusive NIL apparel, the first to have multiple student-athletes partner with Powerade on national NIL marketing opportunities, and the first to have women’s basketball players with auto lease partners. Rocket student-athletes have experienced multiple apparel deals, social media ad campaigns and have appeared in local restaurants and business commercials and billboards. The Rockets also have a collective as an official partner via Learfield and assigned an executive staff member to oversee all NIL initiatives, ensuring the topic is discussed and prioritized at the highest levels of Toledo Athletics.\n\nThe Rockets’ revenue generation has also achieved unprecedented success due to Blair’s efforts. On the 2023 Day of Giving the Rockets accounted for 27% of overall dollars to the University and nearly 20% of donors, including 100% of athletics staff. This year, the Rockets accounted for 37% of overall dollars to the University and once again, nearly 20% of donors, including 100% of athletics staff. In the last two years, athletics fundraising has increased by 101%, with a 71% increase in annual Rocket Fund support over the last three years. The newly launched 1923 Society, featuring philanthropic leadership giving, has quickly led to over $3 million in new revenue with nearly 50% of all members being first-time major gift donors, creating an entirely new pipeline of support for Toledo Athletics. Major vendor contracts with Nike and Learfield have been renegotiated to grow revenue and better support branding, NIL, and maximize sponsorship efforts in a vast market. Sponsorship revenue has increased annually by 7% or more. In the fall of 2023, the Rockets launched the most comprehensive facility masterplan in Toledo Athletics history, totaling over $75 million.\n\nMarketing and fan experience have been strategic priorities under Blair’s leadership. In 2022-23, the Rockets led the MAC in attendance in football, men's basketball, and women's basketball, the first and only MAC school to claim this feat. The Rockets also achieved sellouts in both men’s and women’s basketball for the first time in Toledo history in 2023-34, while establishing the first-ever Fan Leadership Council to bolster marketing, promotion, and fan experience ideation and to enhance communication with the fan base, students, and faculty/staff. Ahead of the 2023 football season, the Rockets unveiled several game-day enhancements to improve the fan experience, including relocating the student tailgate to be closer to the entry to the student section and partnering with Student Affairs to add live music, carnival rides, and other student-generated improvements. The changes also included new concession offerings, tailgate concerts, and the unveiling of the nationally acclaimed “Touchdown Tank” that features a celebrity dunk tank participant after each Rocket touchdown.\n\nInnovation and forward-thinking have been staples of Blair’s tenure leading the Rockets. Recently, the Rockets unveiled the Nancy and James Lapp Creative Studio. The production studio featuring Vu Technologies represents a significant leap forward in utilizing virtual production to elevate the department's overall creative capabilities. This innovative, all-in-one space has redefined the Rockets' storytelling possibilities, offering a dynamic platform for content creation and film-making, a tool for recruiting and retaining student-athletes, an accessible location for NIL sponsorship activations, an interactive display for special events, and a captivating visual centerpiece in the Savage Arena lobby offering an immersive experience for student-athletes, fans and sponsors alike. The University of Toledo is the first athletic department in the country to leverage Vu One technology.\n\nBlair has assumed a major role on the UToledo campus and local community since he joined the Rockets in 2022. On campus, he serves on the President’s senior leadership team, was honored as an honorary member of Blue Key by the UToledo student organization and was appointed by the President to serve on the Executive Committee for the University’s campus master plan. In the local community, he initiated a #TeamToledo campaign to increase collaboration between the Athletic Department and the greater Toledo community. He has reached out and met with hundreds of organizations and individuals from all walks of life in his first two years at Toledo to learn as much as he can about what makes Toledo such a special place to work, play and live. In 2023, he began the department’s participation in 419 Day, a volunteer community initiative that was repeated in 2024 with nearly 100 student-athletes, coaches and staff collaborating with Keep Toledo/Lucas County Beautiful to help clean up six locations throughout the City of Toledo, collecting more than 3000 pounds of litter from parks and other areas.\n\nIn Summer 2024, the Rockets announced a collaboration with MetroParks Toledo and the Toledo Rowing Foundation to make Toledo Rowing the Rockets’ 17th varsity sport. This initiative was born out the “Rise Together” strategic planning process and takes advantage of the MetroPark's $200 million investment into the downtown Toledo waterfront, leverages one of the city’s most unique attributes – the Maumee River, adds new opportunities for female Division I student-athletes and assists UToledo in its plans to bolster enrollment while adding high academically achieving students locally, nationally and internationally.\n\nBlair has also put his mark on the Rockets with several high-profile hires, tapping former Duke assistant Jessica Bracamonte to become head coach of the softball program and longtime Ohio Northern Head Coach Mark Batman to lead the women’s soccer program. Both programs experienced significant increases in the win column while simultaneously increasing their grade point average and community service. Most recently, Blair named former Monmouth head coach Ginny Boggess to lead the Rockets’ proud women’s basketball program and former Fairfield head coach and Toledo Hall of Famer Jacy Dyer to lead women’s swimming and diving. In addition, Blair has added four key members to the senior administrative Staff: Deputy Athletic Director Al Tomlinson; Executive Associate Athletic Director/Chief Operating Officer and Senior Woman Administrator Nicole Alderson; Senior Associate Athletic Director for Student-Athlete Experience Dr. Eugene Henderson; and Associate Athletic Director for Creative Serves and Brand Strategy Blaine Fridrick.\n\nBlairs’ initiatives at Toledo include the creation and implementation of “Rise Together,” a strategic plan that outlines a roadmap for student-athlete well-being and success, community engagement and facility enhancements that aims to elevate the Rockets into national prominence. \"Rise Together\" is the culmination of a year-long process that brought together a wide range of campus, community, athletic staff and student-athlete stakeholders who helped lay out a bold new vision for Toledo Athletics, establishing ambitious goals and laying the groundwork for unprecedented academic and athletic achievement by its student-athletes.\n\nOther key initiatives started under Blair’s tenure include:\n\nThe 1923 Society, a philanthropic initiative designed to generate new revenues to support Rocket student-athletes in their academic, athletic, and personal pursuits.\n\n“Dining With the Deans,” an ongoing series of dinners that allow Rocket student-athletes to meet and share ideas with the Dean of their school of study in an informal setting.\n\nA partnership with RealResponse, provides Rocket student-athletes the opportunity to communicate with the administration in real-time about various issues, sends regular surveys to students to enhance the student-athlete experience and further bolsters the Rockets commitment to integrity.\n\nCreating “Blue Hall” through a partnership with campus to light our most prominent university building, University Hall, blue after big wins to signify campus excitement and support of athletic accomplishments.\n\nStrategic collaboration with Student Affairs and Enrollment Management to generate creative strategies to assist the institution’s enrollment and retention strategies through the momentum in our athletics department.\n\nThe Rockets became the first school in the nation to partner with LunchTable to start a new social media ambassador program, amplifying messaging across multiple media platforms and creating a stronger brand affinity with the most loyal fans. LunchTable has also partnered with the Cincinnati Reds and FC Cincinnati.\n\nIn his previous role at Washington State, Blair led a team of sport administrators responsible for day-to-day oversight of 17 varsity sports programs and oversaw several departmental units focused on student-athlete success. Among his responsibilities was managing the university’s Nike contract, serving as the lead on NIL initiatives, and overseeing the development and execution of WSU’s athletic strategic plan. During Blair’s tenure, the Cougars excelled on and off the court, competing for NCAA championships, setting cumulative GPA records, doubling yearly fundraising to more than $30 million, and securing 50 of the top 70 largest gifts in WSU athletic history.\n\nPrior to WSU, Blair was the Senior Associate Director of Athletics at Rice University from 2014-18, which was his second stint at that institution, having previously worked there from 2011-12. While serving as Senior Associate AD at Rice, he worked as a member of the athletics department’s senior leadership team and oversaw sports medicine, strength and conditioning, sports nutrition, compliance, and seven of the department’s 16 NCAA Division I sports programs. In addition, Blair served as the advisor for the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) and helped secure a multimillion-dollar partnership, one of the largest in Rice Athletics history.\n\nBlair also worked at the University of South Carolina from 2012-14 and at the NCAA Offices in Indianapolis from 2010-11.\n\nA rising star in intercollegiate athletics, Blair was selected by “The Athletic” as one of college sport’s “40 Under 40” in 2022 and as one of the “20 Under 40” community leaders in Northwest Ohio and Southeast Michigan in 2023.\n\nNationally, Blair serves on the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions, one of the most visible NCAA committees in the nation, and was previously selected to serve on the National Sports Forum’s Steering Committee and the Board of Directors for the Minority Opportunities Athletic Association.\n\nBlair holds a law degree from the University of South Carolina and earned his undergraduate degree from Wofford College. He played four seasons as a nose tackle for the Wofford football team from 2003-06. He was a team captain as a senior in 2006 and was named the team’s Defensive Lineman of the Year.\n\nBlair and his wife, Jenna, have two children, Brielle (6) and Beau (3).\n\nBryan Blair's File\n\nEducation:\n\n• Law Degree, South Carolina '10\n\n• Bachelor's Degree in History, Wofford College '07\n\nAdministrative Experience:\n\n2022-pres.
