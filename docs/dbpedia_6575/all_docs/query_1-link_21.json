        "text": "Iowa State football, under the direction of head coach Johnny Majors, emerged from the dark ages in the early 1970s. Behind a slew of NFL and all-conference players, the Cyclones earned their first-ever bowl bid in 1971 (Sun Bowl) and followed it up with a Liberty Bowl appearance in 1972. A man who had a BIG part in Iowa State’s resurgence was Lawrence “Big Daddy” Hunt. A native of Delray Beach, Fla., Hunt was a fierce defensive lineman (1971-73), racking up an incredible 334 career tackles in only three seasons (freshmen were ineligible in 1970). That total currently ranks eighth in school history and he’s one of the few down linemen in the top 10. Hunt’s impact on Cyclone football is immeasurable and he remains one of the most popular Cyclones with a fantastic nickname. How did he earn his moniker? You are about to find out and learn much more about Hunt in this Forever True Q&A.\n\nBefore we get started, we must know how you got the nickname Big Daddy?\n\nLH: I was at my high school, going into the ninth grade, and I didn’t know they were having tryouts for the football team. I had been out playing basketball with some friends of mine. After we were done, I was walking home and decided to take a little rest. It was summertime. I laid down, and I must have fallen asleep, because the next thing I knew, Roger Coffey (Carver H.S. football coach) came over and said, “Hey, are you alright?” I said I was and was just taking a break. Football practice was beginning, I stood up and he said, “Wait a minute, get in that line over there.” (laughs) We started football practice and the next thing I know my cousin called me Big Daddy. No one had ever called me that before in my life. What’s crazy was I wasn’t the biggest guy on our team. There was another guy on our team that weighed at least 50 pounds more and probably was a couple inches taller, but for some reason it just stuck. I was amazed when I came to Iowa State for two-a-days in August (1970) and Coach Majors introduced me to some alumni as “Big Daddy” Hunt. I was shocked. The rest is history.\n\nWhat was your recruitment process like?\n\nLH: I was getting recruited to be an offensive lineman first, maybe defense. In my 1970 class, I think there were nine of us from Florida. Barry Hill (All-American defensive back) was from my hometown. You can’t understate that Florida was the deep south. Johnny came from Tennessee, and he was a southerner. He was going to find quality football players everywhere. He was going to go after kids that could play. (ISU assistants) Joe Avezzano and Ray Greene came down (to Florida) and did their thing. It was open season to recruit Florida. I was recruited by Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Minnesota. When I came to Iowa State it just felt right. I initially told Ray Greene I wasn’t interested in playing football. My uncle had a paint and body shop and I wanted to go to training school. That’s what I wanted to do. He (Ray) talked to me at school and then he came to my house. He told my mom I didn’t want to go to college. My mom didn’t know what was going on. He said to my mom, “Do you know your son is telling everybody he doesn’t want to go to school?” When I came home, she asked me to come into the back room with her to have a little talk (laughs). Back then there was no back talk in the household, so I was told to tell Ray Greene I would come out to visit Iowa State. If it hadn’t snowed in Minnesota when I went up there to visit, I probably would have gone to Minnesota because I wanted to get as far away from this crazy woman as I could, and she would regret that she made me play football (laughs).\n\nMajors had an all-star coaching staff that featured Jimmy Johnson, Jackie Sherrill, Joe Avezzano and Ray Greene. Johnson, who won a national championship at Miami (Fla.) and two Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys as a head coach, left after a couple of seasons. Sherrill, Avezzano and Greene remained with Majors throughout his tenure at Iowa State. Sherrill later amassed a head coaching record of 180-120-4 with stops at Washington State, Pittsburgh, Texas A&M and Mississippi State. Avezzano later became head coach at Oregon State and was a valuable assistant with the Dallas Cowboys (1990-2002), helping the franchise win three Super Bowl titles. Greene had head coaching stints at North Carolina Central and Alabama A&M.\n\nLH: Johnny Majors came to Florida. Jackie Sherrill came. Joe Avezzano and Ray Greene came. All the kids from Florida were there having lunch. Johnny had the people bring out a big basket of oranges. He said, “We are going to play in the Orange Bowl. You guys are going to make this happen. You’re going to make it happen.” He wanted all of us to come up and visit and consider Iowa State. Johnny Majors could be a salesman, man. Jackie Sherrill was just sitting there mean as hell (laughs). Didn’t smile. I’m not sure I want to play for this guy. He told us matter-of-factly we got a spot for everyone here. We want you.\n\nWhat was it like when you first got to campus?\n\nLH: I think about two-a-days in August. We would have to run across campus because we would practice over by the horse barn. We would run from the stadium (Clyde Williams Field) to the practice field. What the heck is going on? I didn’t know if I could practice. I had never run that far before. That’s a long haul, man. We ran in our gear. From day one, everyone was serious. We were doing drills on both offense and defense. Jackie Sherrill came up to me and said, “Let’s do that 2-on-1 again, and Big Daddy, I want you over here (referring to the defense).” I was going against Ray Harm, and I just remember what my high school defensive coach always told me, “Big Daddy, the first guy you hit, make him remember it and think twice about ever wanting to block you.” I teed off on the first guy and it just went on and on. That’s when Jackie finally decided I was going to play defense.\n\nIowa State went 5-6 in 1970 the year Hunt sat out under the NCAA freshman ineligibility rule. Hunt found his way into the starting lineup on the defensive line as a sophomore in 1971, racking up 103 tackles to earn sophomore All-America honors. With Hunt, future NFL stars Matt Blair (LB) and Merv Krakau (DE), and all-Big Eight linebacker Keith Schroeder, the Cyclone defense was stout. On offense, ISU boasted stars like quarterback/running back George Amundson – ISU’s first 1,000-yard rusher and future first round NFL draft pick – Ike Harris (WR), Keith Krepfle (TE) and Geary Murdock (OL). The two strong units provided instant success, as the Cyclones went 8-3 in the regular season and were invited to the Sun Bowl. ISU had never made a bowl game in its 80-year history. It was a special team.\n\nLH: The guys on the team were committed to winning. Our practice sessions? It was all out. You had to work hard to get on the starting units. If you started, you earned it. I got to play in the Big Eight with the best athletes in the world. We held our own.\n\nLH: (continued) I will never forget we were playing (No. 5) Colorado and Ted Jornov hit their big running back (Charlie Davis). They doubled me, and I was trying to roll out of the double and I could see Ted hit this guy and he doesn’t even move. Ted falls backwards and I was able to grab his legs and pull him down. Ted jumps up off the ground. His helmet is twisted sideways. He undoes his chinstrap, reaches up and pulls out his two front teeth. He throws them on the ground and says, “I’m going to get that ____.” (laughs) It was like, this was just a little pain, and we are going to stop these guys and go get them. It was real. We were ready to play. We could see confidence building as the year went on.\n\nWhat was the feeling like in Ames and around campus when you made the school’s first-ever bowl game?\n\nLH: The alumni, you could tell when they came around, were thrilled. It was something I had never experienced. It had never happened. They were so happy for us and glad for the program. It was euphoric. I don’t think any of those people stopped smiling for several years. We finally got to a bowl and people said it would never happen at Iowa State. People didn’t think you could recruit against Oklahoma and Nebraska and find quality players. Johnny and his staff made it happen. It was hard work. From a players’ standpoint, we were just playing ball. We wanted to win every single game. That was our commitment. It was another week of practice and all these other things. I don’t have the words to express how hard it was, how much fun it was and how gratifying it was to establish goals, work hard and make it happen. The whole experience was cool.\n\nIowa State and LSU met in the 1971 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas. The Tigers were ranked 11th nationally and had an outstanding season led by quarterback Bert Jones, the 1976 NFL MVP as a member of the Baltimore Colts. For a program yearning to travel for the school’s first bowl game, the weather was downright disappointing. It had snowed in El Paso during bowl prep week and the temperature at kickoff was 34 degrees and rain with 18 mph winds. A Keith Krepfle 1-yard TD catch from Dean Carlson cut the LSU lead to 19-15 early in the fourth quarter. The Tigers responded with a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns to win 33-15.\n\nLH: Heading into the game we had a bad snowstorm in Ames, and they had to clear the practice field for us. We didn’t have an indoor facility. None of this pampered stuff (laughs). So, Johnny decided we need to go to El Paso early. The first night we are there, Barry Hill and I were sharing a room. I left the window open. I woke up early and there was snow in the room. I said, “This is crazy.”\n\nLH: (continued) It really didn’t hit me (the magnitude) until we got to Texas. It was a big deal. I remember the LSU head coach (Charles McClendon) stopped over before the game because he knew Jackie (Sherrill). Coach Sherrill wanted to introduce me to him because he wanted to meet Big Daddy. He shook my hand and said, “I’ve seen defensive lineman play, but I have not seen a defensive lineman like you. We are going to have fun.” He blocked my butt all day, so it wasn’t fun for me.\n\nThe 1972 Cyclones returned Hunt and many stars. Amundson switched to quarterback, his favorite position, and was the Big Eight’s Offensive Player of the Year over Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Rodgers of Nebraska. Iowa State earned its first national ranking since 1938 and its second-straight bowl berth in a trip to the Liberty Bowl. In one of the most memorable games in Cyclone football history, ISU halted Nebraska’s 24-game Big Eight unbeaten streak via a 23-23 tie against the nation’s third-ranked team. Willie Jones caught a 24-yard TD toss from Amundson with 23 seconds on the clock to knot the contest. Clyde Williams Field erupted. It was mayhem as fans stormed the field to celebrate. ISU still needed to attempt the PAT for the win, and it took a significant amount of time to clear the field. Once cleared, Tom Goedjen missed the PAT and the game ended in a tie. Although disappointing, the draw was instrumental in helping the Cyclones secure a spot in the Liberty Bowl.\n\nLH: Both Ike Harris and Willie Jones caught big passes in that game (Nebraska). Willie makes a great catch to tie the game. Oh, my goodness. It was unbelievable. We were crying. We were trying to make sure Tom (Goedjen) knew, “Hey man, none of us are perfect. You just missed one.” We were crying. We held them. I will never forget. I had broken through the line and Johnny Rodgers was going to the right side. He reverses himself and starts running toward me. I’m there, and he decides to go up-field. As soon as he makes that cut, Ted (Jornov) gets him. And I was like, “Yes, we got him!” He was so fast and quick. It just showed that Jackie (Sherrill) had prepared us for everything they were going to throw at us. We handled our business that day. Every game there was something positive you could take away and build toward the next game.\n\nIowa State faced Georgia Tech in the 1972 Liberty Bowl (Memphis) in a Tennessee homecoming for Coach Majors. It was an incredible game, as the Cyclones fell to the Yellow Jackets in the final minute, 31-30. Willie Jones had a 93-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and George Amundson found Ike Harris in the end zone with 1:36 left on the clock to make it a 31-30 game. Majors decided to go for the win, sending in the offense for the two-point conversion, but Amundson’s pass was rushed and fell incomplete. What the team didn’t know at the time was that Majors had already decided prior to the game that he was leaving Iowa State to take the Pittsburgh head coaching position. After a heartbreaking loss, Majors broke the news to the team. It was a very somber locker room, especially for the players, like Hunt, who had eligibility remaining.\n\nLH: We had no idea (Majors was leaving). None. I was shocked. How could he do this? We got all the goods. We thought we would be better the next year. He told us right after the game. We could have tied the game with an extra point, but I respected him for making the call (going for two). You know what? We are going to win this. That’s how I play. Let’s play to win. It was not a good feeling. One, losing is always hard no matter what. No matter how you got there, or experiences on the field or how well you played. There were just no positives to take away from that experience. It was heartbreaking. We had gelled as a team, but we were just missing a couple of pieces. To have him (Johnny Majors) do that, I felt like he gave up on us. You brought us here to do this, now you are going to leave? We were young kids then. We didn’t understand how the world works. I never hated him for it, but I was disappointed.\n\nEarle Bruce was tabbed as the next Iowa State football coach for Hunt’s senior season in 1973. It was an incredible contrast of styles between Majors and the new man in charge. Like most transitions, it was difficult for many members of the team. Change is hard. There was still plenty of talent, but the team struggled to a 4-7 record. Close losses were the norm, as the Cyclones lost to Arkansas (21-19), Colorado (23-16), Kansas State (21-19) and Kansas (22-20) in one-score games. Hunt did his part, racking up 139 tackles with two fumble recoveries and a pair of forced fumbles. Bruce moved him into a new role as a hybrid down lineman/linebacker, earning Hunt first-team All-Big Eight accolades. He ended his career as a three-year starter and one of the most prolific tacklers in school history.\n\nLH: We were always knocking on the door that season. I will never forget that season. I really wasn’t an Earle Bruce fan. He wanted to establish himself and his coaches as the new sheriffs in town. I just felt there was a different way to do this (transition). Once again, we were kids and didn’t understand how much pressure he had to produce a winning team. He only knew what he knew. He didn’t know us like the other coaches did. It takes a while to build a team. It just doesn’t happen overnight. You must build a team. It requires leadership. Obviously, Coach Bruce was very successful. We just got caught into things, unfortunately.\n\nHunt’s productivity and toughness certainly created interest among NFL scouts. Six Cyclones were selected in the 1974 NFL Draft, including Hunt, who was picked by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Hunt had goals and plans for his future, and the NFL was not one of them.\n\nLH: Everyone at Iowa State knew I had no interest in playing professional football. None. Many people still ask me if I regret it. Heck no. I had the best four years of my life (at Iowa State) and played against the best athletes in the country. You must become another person to be successful in football. You want to hit someone so hard that they want to go home and not play against you. I would rather do anything than face Lawrence Hunt. That was how you made things happen. To become that person, you must step outside who you are, or think you are, to become someone else. I didn’t like that feeling. I didn’t like it. It was fun doing it, but I didn’t see myself doing it for a long period of time. I just couldn’t see it.\n\nLH: (continued) The Steelers sent me two first class plane tickets to Pittsburgh. I gave one to my dad. I said, “Pops, we are going to go to Pittsburgh, and we are going to listen to them.” My price was $100,000 with a no-cut contract. If they are willing to do that, they can buy these services. I knew they weren’t going to do that, right? They aren’t going to pay a rookie defensive lineman $100,000. My dad asked me if I was sure I wanted to do this and I was. He then said, ‘You really don’t want to play?” I said, “No sir, I don’t.”\n\nHunt is a few months away from retirement and still working at the age of 70 in Bartow, Florida. He’s made a career in mentoring/rehabilitating youths who have had difficulties with the law. He’s enjoyed a prosperous career.\n\nLH: I received my degree in child development at Iowa State. I had to work my butt off to get through Iowa State. On the way to Ames my freshman year, I wrote my goals. I wanted to do things with my degree. That was my first goal. The second goal was to be the best football player at my position, and no one would ever question that. The third goal was to come back home (Florida) and work in the community. I wanted to do something good for people. I grew up very poor. My mom and dad were migrant workers. I saw some things as a kid that I didn’t think other kids should have to deal with. I graduated and I still think I am one of the best down linemen in Iowa State history. When they line up defensive linemen, my stats stack up. I now get to work with young men every day who are in trouble with the law. Every day I talk to kids about how important it is to have your goals, visualize what they are and to work to make it happen. We are so close to turning the corner in helping young men who are in trouble with the law. We are so close to getting these guys to have a dream and commitment that things can work out. They pay me to do this. It’s unbelievable. I’ve helped enroll several kids to college and countless kids to vocational schools. Every day I get up I get to do it all over again. I love making a difference in my community.\n\nLH: (continued) The company I work for is a non-profit called Eckerd Connects. There have been situations where my former Iowa State teammates – Dan Becker and Ike Harris – have helped me out with some kids. Dan took my call and wanted to help. I called Ike, and he said, “You got it. You can count on me.” They are Cyclones who went in different directions, but they appreciate the work I do for kids who have lost their way. They need a second chance and that’s what I do. I’m getting ready to retire and it’s not something I’m looking forward to. I’m 70 now and this is my last year doing this. Do I really want to stop? I’m so close to figuring this thing out.\n\nFamily has always been important to Hunt. He’s a grandfather now. His daughter Meghann, who is married to Iowa assistant football coach LeVar Woods, has three children. Another daughter, Christie, has a son, Braxton Clark, who is a member of the Nebraska football team. He’s active in following the activities of his grandchildren, but he admits he will always be a Cyclone.\n\nLH: I am never going to not be a Cyclone. I’m always watching Iowa State. I play golf on Saturdays, and when I come in from the back nine, all the guys say, “Tell, Lawrence the score of the Cyclone game.” (laughs). They just know. I live in a little town. Bartow is a little town that reminds me of Ames in so many ways. This is where I do my best work. I am the best version of Lawrence Hunt in a small town."
