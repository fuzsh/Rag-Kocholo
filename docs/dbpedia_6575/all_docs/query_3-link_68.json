        "text": "UPDATE: The first round of the Wyndham Championship has been postponed to Friday. The course and its facilities have been closed until further notice.\n\n***\n\nThe first round of the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, N.C., is battling a formidable opponent: Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nThe powerful storm that made its second landfall overnight, bringing torrential rain and heavy wind to North Carolina, has delayed the start of the tournament at Sedgefield Country Club by at least eight hours.\n\nRound 1 tee times, which were scheduled to start at 6:50 a.m. E.T., have been pushed back to no earlier than 3 p.m.\n\nAccording to an update on the PGA Tour’s website, on-site meteorologist Stewart Williams said the rain “began between 2:30-3 a.m. on Thursday. As of 8 a.m., a total of 2 inches had already fallen at Sedgefield with sustained winds of 15-25 mph and gusts between 30-40 mph.”\n\nThe Tour said the next update on the first-round plan is scheduled for noon ET.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Debby came ashore early Thursday in the area around Bulls Bay, S.C. The storm first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Florida’s Gulf Coast on Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday, with the storm looming, the Tour already had made the decision to prohibit fans from attending the first round.\n\n“This decision was a difficult one for us to make with our partners at the PGA Tour, but everyone’s safety is our top priority,” tournament director Bobby Powell said. “The most recent forecast looks like the storm could clear our area sometime Friday.”\n\nHere are the original Wyndham Championship tee times for Round 1 (ET):\n\nTee No. 1\n\n6:50 a.m. – Justin Suh, Ben Kohles, Tyson Alexander\n\n7:01 a.m. – Bill Haas, Matt NeSmith, Roger Sloan\n\n7:12 a.m. – Nate Lashley, Patrick Rodgers, Dylan Wu\n\n7:23 a.m. – Raul Pereda, K.H.
