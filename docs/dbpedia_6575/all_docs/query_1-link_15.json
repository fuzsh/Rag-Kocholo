        "text": "Keith Schroeder joined the Iowa State football program in 1967 with little fanfare and left after the 1971 season as one of its greatest underdog stories.\n\nLightly recruited out of Davenport West High School, Schroeder- nicknamed “Stumpy” – was told he was too small to play linebacker.\n\nInstead, Schroeder was determined to show new coach Johnny Majors he had the goods and willed his way into the lineup as a three-year starter, culminating with the Cyclones’ first-ever bowl berth (Sun Bowl) in his senior season in 1971.\n\n“It was awesome, I guess that is the word I want to use,” Schroeder said. “A lot of us, they (Majors’ staff) tried to run us off. My goal was to make the travel squad, but the reason I got to play early was the guy ahead of me, who was a hellluva lot better athlete than I was, got hurt and I got in to play. When referring to me, Majors always said, ‘We got to have a lot better than him to win in the Big Eight.’ He wasn’t pointing me out, but athletically you could sure tell the difference when we were playing Oklahoma or Nebraska. If they got past me, I wasn’t going to catch them.”\n\nSchroeder didn’t need to catch them, however. Opponents usually never got that far. Schroeder tackled them and tackled them often. In his final two seasons, Schroeder racked up an astounding 316 stops. His three-year career total (freshman were ineligible back then) of 386 tackles still ranks second all-time in school history.\n\nMajors and defensive coordinator Jackie Sherrill changed their tune on Schroeder, who was voted a co-captain in 1971. Competing at 6-0, 210 pounds final year, Schroeder was a force on the gridiron, earning First Team All-Big Eight recognition.\n\nHe only missed one game in his career and was the constant leader on a Cyclone defense that helped pave the way for unprecedented success.\n\n“I was at the right place at the right time. I don’t know how you explain it,” Schroeder admitted. “We were all overachievers. None of us I would call great athletes. We wouldn’t have played at Oklahoma and Nebraska.”\n\nIowa State made up for its lack of athletic ability with toughness and intellect, and Schroeder was the ringleader, as the defense held its own against a conference loaded with talent.\n\n“We did a lot of different schemes,” Schroeder said. “Jackie Sherrill was our defensive coordinator and a lot of it was we were trying to trick the other team. We couldn’t line up and go head-to-head. That wasn’t going to happen. We had to outsmart them, I guess, and Majors had a good enough staff where we could do some things.”\n\nSchroeder was blessed to have future All-American and Iowa State Hall-of-Famer Matt Blair join him in the linebacking corps in 1971. Blair was a junior college transfer who emerged as one of the greatest players in Cyclone history. He went on to make six Pro Bowls for the Minnesota Vikings (1974-85).\n\n“Matt could run like a deer,” Schroeder said. “That was his big attribute, but he was also a great athlete. He could put himself in situations where he could run a guy down and cover. He did some things nobody else could do on our team.”\n\nSchroeder remains a staunch Cyclone fan and is thrilled by the success of head coach Matt Campbell, “It’s been amazing, he’s done a great job.”\n\nSchroeder and his teammates try to make it back to an ISU Letterwinners Club reunion each season, including last week’s Homecoming contest against Kansas.\n\n“Coach Majors would come back often, and we were always excited to see him,” Schroeder said. “It’s always fun to be back.”\n\nThe Iowa State Letterwinners Club wrapped up its fall reunion schedule this past weekend. Thank you to all our alumni who came back to make this season an enormous success! See you all next Fall!"
