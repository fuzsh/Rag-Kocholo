        "text": "The tldr is this place is designed FOR KIDS! It was my daughterâs first visit to the dentist, and from the moment we walked in they put her at the center of the visit. They have a playroom in the waiting area (my daughter gravitated to the paw patrol arcade game and play kitchen). The Dentist (Dr. Matt) came out to introduce himself while she was playing and to ask if we had any questions before the appointment and Ben started to make sure we were comfortable. Our hygenist, Dana, was amazing. She talked to my daughter, explained what she was going to do before she did it, and was above all patient and comforting. I felt they cared about her experience, not just trying to rush us through the appointment. My daughter also loved watching a movie (they have flat screens on the ceiling!) while they were cleaning her teeth. At the end, they gave her a prize and a âfirst visit to the dentistâ certificate. It was so cute and now sheâs going to be excited to go back, not scared. I love this team and everything theyâve done to make this a kid-centered patient experience. Thank you!\n\nBrittany S.\n\nLove this office so much! Everyone is so kind and treats my babies so well. My 4 and 5 year old literally look forward to their appointment. My daughter just asked if we could go back so she could tell Dr. Matt something lol. I feel like this type of experience each time they go to the dentist, is going to create such a good relationship with them and their teeth as they continue to get older. My 1 year old also just had his first appt and they treated him so well. As parents you always want what is best for you kids wherever you take them-and we found that here! Highly highly recommend!\n\nAshley M.\n\nWe just left our appointment and had a great first time experience. Everyone was warm and welcoming. My child enjoyed his experience and Dr. Matt was very kind with lots of positive reinforcement. All the little gifts were a hit with my kiddo. The online scheduling made everything easy for an initial setup. The facility is bright, fun, and clean. I would recommend giving them a try if youâre looking for an easy, no fuss pediatric dental clinic.\n\nAmy S.\n\nHonestly, perfection. I cannot share enough what a wonderful place this is. Literally from the front, to middle, to the doctor (Matt). Iâm so impressed by the staff, cleanliness, and friendliness by everyone here. Dr Matt, our dentist, is the most personable and kind dentist Iâve encountered. He came to the waiting room to introduce himself to myself and my son. The professionalism and down to earth ratio are the best Iâve seen. Was so kind, and truly wanted to listen to every single question both of us had (and I had ridiculous amounts of every kind of question). He relieved so much stress in regards to work that my son needs done, and assured me all was ok. I have seen many dentists on the hunt for a good one. This establishment is so top tier, you wonât go wrong choosing them. Iâm so thrilled to have found them.\n\nJenny C.\n\nWe honestly were blown away at how amazing Dr. Matt and staff are! My daughter has always been a bit afraid of dentists, and everyone here made her feel so comfortable and they were so gentle. I honestly think I have found the perfect pediatric dental practice for all of my children. Thank you Dr. Matt and staff for such an awesome experience!\n\nBelkis V.\n\nDr. Matt and his staff are great! They are so kind and patient the moment you walk through the door. They made sure my little one felt comfortable is the clinic setting before even bring her back to the exam room. Once back in place they made sure they explain everything and let her explore/touch the utensils before using them. Dana was fantastic with making sure my daughter wasnât scared and complemented her the entire visit and how well she was doing. The coolest part was ending the visit with going to the token machine to get your prize. Kudos to such an amazing clinic.\n\nDanielle L.\n\nWe had our very first dental appointment today (ever) with Dr. Matt and his team - and I canât thank them enough! They took their time making my daughter feel comfortable, and helping ease her nerves for an absolutely amazing appointment! Dr. Matt answered all my questions, and was sure that I was confident with the whole process before beginning! My daughter was already asking to go back before we left the parking lot! If youâre in the MG area (even if youâre not!) I would definitely suggest checking them out!\n\nHaley N.\n\nWe enjoyed our experience today! I brought my almost 2 year in and I didn't know how everything would go being its his first dental visit. Dr. Matt, Dana and the other staff were all kind and engaging with my son. They had lots of fun toys all around too which makes it appealing for a 2 year old. And of course some fun toys at the end. The office and rooms were clean as well. Excited to have a new pediatric dentist for Maple Grove!\n\nBlair H.\n\nLove love LOVE!!! I was so happy to find a pediatric dentist in our insurance network. The building was clean/up to date. All the staff was super sweet and kind! I had to bring my 4month old with us and it was no problem! They explained everything to my toddler and made us both feel so comfortable! Only dentist my kiddos will be going to.\n\nCassandra K."
