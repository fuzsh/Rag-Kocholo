        "text": "FRIDAY HARBOR HIGH SCHOOL BACK-TO-SCHOOL INFORMATION\n\nAugust 22, 2023\n\nWe are excited to welcome you to the 2023-24 school year! Teachers start back the 28th, and students’ first day is Thursday, August 31st. With my first year behind me, I can confidently say how proud I am of our school – from amazing academic offerings, to the range of athletics and activities our students participate in, to deep and broad community partnerships, there so many incredible opportunities for our kids. We absolutely have work to do, but we will capitalize on our diverse and talented community, students, and staff, and work to make FHHS an even more remarkable home. We are honored you share your children with us, and we are committed to supporting their growth and development every step of the way. Thank you!\n\nNew Student Orientation & Chromebook Exchange: All incoming 9th-grade students and our newly enrolled 10th- through 12th-grade students are invited to school on Wednesday, 8/30. From 10:30 – 12:00, these students will be able to pick up their Chromebooks. 9th-grade students who were in SJISD last year need to bring their Chromebook and charger to exchange for the new ones. In addition, a guardian needs to fill out the Acceptable Use form for their student prior to pickup. Hard copies will be available for parents at the Chromebook Exchange event, but save yourself time by logging into Skyward and filling out this form (and all the others!) in advance of the 30th. From 12:00-1:00, there will be a New Student Orientation that will include a welcome from our student leadership, a school tour, and the chance to meet your teachers and see your classrooms.\n\nNew Staff: I am excited to share information on our new, and some returning, staff this fall.\n\nTeachers\n\nEd Brown is splitting his time between the MS and the HS this year, teaching all of our Chem/Phys classes.\n\nPaige Caldwell is returning to teach Social Studies and will have a Freshman Advisory.\n\nBrock Hauck will be teaching our Foods/Culinary classes, as well as continuing as the Capital Projects Manager and Athletic Director, and head FB coach. He will have a Sophomore Advisory.\n\nClaire Kennedy will be our new Student Assistance Professional.\n\nGreg Schuh is the new FHMS & FHHS Band Director. He comes to us with over 17 years of teaching experience, and we are so elated to have him join us, along with his family. He will also have a Freshman Advisory.\n\nCady Wilson is returning to teach our Yearbook class, and will be teaching MS English as well.\n\nSupport Staff\n\nScott Totten is coming as a paraeducator from the elementary school to the high school.\n\nGreg Truesdale is now the SJISD Facilities Director and the FHMS/HS Building Engineer.\n\nACTION REQUIRED: Update Information: All families need to log into Skyward/Family Access to fill out/update the 23-24 paperwork. Many required forms are electronic now, making it so simple. Please know that we often use text to communicate important time-sensitive messages with families via text, so accurate cell numbers are essential.\n\nBell Schedules: Daily bell schedules are attached. School starts at 8:15am and ends at 2:55pm. Students with 0 Period Jazz Band will be responsible for finding their own transportation to school for a 7:15am start, beginning on Tuesday, September 5th. We will continue to have early dismissal Wednesdays, and hope to have an extra bus that will run at 3:00pm so students can access the library and/or other opportunities between 1:40-3:00pm. Stay tuned for more information. Please note the calendar that shows when we have early dismissals, school events, athletic events, conferences, half days, and breaks, etc.\n\nStudent Schedules: These are available to view in Skyward/Family Access. There will be continual adjustments made between now and the start of school, so be sure to check on the first day of school. Schedule changes can be requested by emailing our counselor, Hailey Henderson-Paul haileyhendersonpaul@sjisd.org. Please note that our students are registered based on WA State Graduation Requirements and very few schedule changes will be made, unless students are misplaced.\n\nCampus Updates: If you have come past the school at any time in the last month, you will have seen several projects taking shape. At the HS, the art room has been successfully relocated to the STEM (STEAM!) building as well as an emergency plumbing fix down there, the student/staff parking lot has been resurfaced, and the MS art program has moved into the old art room. The MS has a new roof, and the Griffin Bay Annex is in the process of getting a new awning and paint. We are so grateful to the community for the support of our schools!\n\nImportant Dates: The FHHS calendar is up-to-date and maintained regularly. Here are a few important dates.\n\nChromebook Pick-Up (new to SJISD) and 9th-Gr Exchange: Wednesday, August 30th, 10:30 am – 12:00 pm\n\nNew Student Orientation: Wednesday, August 30th, 12:00 – 1:00 p.m.\n\nFirst Day of School: Thursday, August 31st, 8:15 a.m. – 2:55 p.m.\n\nBack-to-School Night: Monday, September 11th, 6:00 p.m.\n\nPicture Day: Wednesday, September 13th\n\nSenior Parent College Night: September 21st\n\nFutures Fair: October 4th\n\nHomecoming Week: October 9th-13th\n\nPSAT Day: October 11th\n\nFall Student-Led Conferences: October 18th, 19th, & 20th\n\nWinter Band Concert: December 12th\n\nWinter Break: December 18th – January 1st\n\nHS Musical Performances: January 18th-21st\n\nFirst Semester Finals: January 24th-26th\n\nLast Day of First Semester: January 26th\n\nFebruary Break: February 19th-23rd\n\nCelebration of Academics: March 8th\n\nSpring Student-Led Conferences: March 13th, 14th, & 15th\n\nSpring Band Concert: March 26th\n\nSpring Break: April 8th-12th\n\nProm: April 27th\n\nState Testing Week: May 20th-24th\n\nSenior Exhibitions: May 30th\n\nGraduation: June 8th\n\nLast Day of School: June 14th\n\nTransportation: District bus routes have not changed. You can find the routes on this page of the district website. Visit www.sjisd.wednet.edu à Families à Transportation for this and more transportation information.\n\nImportance of Attendance: Student attendance is closely monitored. Students are expected to be in their classrooms ready to learn when the bell rings. Students who accumulate 3+ tardies will be assigned after-school detention on Mondays, and will miss their associated school activities to do so. Students who accumulate absences (either by period or by full days) will be expected to participate in school-based attendance conferences so we can provide wraparound supports to get students ready to learn every day. School attendance is required by law, for good reason!\n\nStudents who attend school regularly tend to also pass their classes.\n\nStudents who are chronically absent (defined as 10% of the time or more, or one day every 2 weeks, on average) are 50% more likely to not graduate on time!\n\nStudents who earn a high-school diploma will earn an average of $1 million more in their lifetimes than students who don’t. (See research supporting this, and other amazing attendance statistics at attendanceworks.org).\n\nOf course, if you’re absent for illness or for school-sponsored events, we have several supports and interventions in place to help students maintain their academics. New this year: if you plan to take your student away on a vacation that will result in 5+ consecutive days absent, you will need to meet with the principal prior to your departure. Here is the pre-arranged absence form, which you need for any planned absence of 3+ days. Please contact the main office or the counselor if you would like to talk about attendance support strategies. Attendance calls go out every afternoon. Please call the Attendance Office (360-370-7110) as soon as you can to excuse your student’s absences.\n\nSchool Supplies: Each teacher may have a small amount of supplies they request of their students. They will share those in the first few days of school. Students who need financial assistance can let a school office staff member know, and we will help you with their procurement. Students need to come to school daily with their charged Chromebook, school books and materials, and water bottles.\n\nOn-Campus Parking: We will issue parking permits for our student drivers again this year. For safety reasons, we will only be issuing parking passes to juniors and seniors. There is no charge, but students register their vehicles with us for emergency purposes. In addition, student drivers will be expected to abide by our parking lot expectations. These will be issued starting Tuesday 9/5.. Student drivers will have until 9/11 to get their vehicles registered. Students are not allowed to access their vehicles during the school day, except for during lunch, without written permission from a staff member. Please review the expectations in the attached form.\n\nMeals & Free/Reduced-Price Meals: Breakfast and lunch are served every school day from our amazing kitchen and Food for Thought program. Information about the menus, meal prices, meal payment, and the free/reduced forms can all be found on the district’s Food Service webpage. We need a new form submitted annually, but only one form is needed per family. Completing the form can help our school and our students in many ways: some academic and participation fees are waived or reduced, college application fees may be waived, our school qualifies for more resources based on our F/R rate, etc. By completing the form, you are helping everyone in our district! Please ensure your student(s) can access these benefits by submitting the appropriate, confidential form. You can drop them in the Main Office here or email them to dianafearn@sjisd.org.\n\nAfter-School Tutoring: Every day after school until 4:30, including Wednesdays, students can come to the library for academic support. The library is closed after school on half days. Students who fall behind academically may be required to stay for support. National Honors Society tutors will be available to help, as well as school support staff.\n\nASB Cards and Other Fees: All athletes will automatically be charged a $30 ASB fee. The ASB fee allows students to attend all home games free as well as many other functions (ex: dances) at a reduced price. All fines and fees will be posted to Skyward/Family Access. We can accept payment in the form of cash or check in the Main Office during office hours; credit cards are accepted online 24/7.\n\nStudent Handbook: The student handbook can be found electronically at this link.\n\nStudent-Led Conferences: These will be held in-person this year as scheduled (October and March). Students sign up for their times in their Advisory classes approximately two weeks prior. These are half days with conferences in the PM.\n\nLockers: FHHS students will be able to request a locker this year with a school-provided lock and combination. Please see Ms. Doran in the main office for your locker sign-up starting Tuesday, September 5th. No lockers will be issued prior to the 5th.\n\nOffice Hours: Our Main Office is open every day from 7:30am to 3:30pm. We are happy to process any payments or help you in any way now, or once school is underway. Our office phone is 360-378-5215, and our Office Manager/Registrar, Katie Aiello, can be reached at 360-370-7102.\n\nQuick Links:\n\nFHHS Facebook: facebook.com/FridayHarborHighSchool/\n\nYearbook purchases: online at com/ybk, and navigate to Friday Harbor HS\n\nFHHS Athletics: https://fhwolverines.com/\n\nSpirit Wear purchases: online at com, and navigate to SHOP\n\nPTSA: facebook.com/FHHSPTA or email at fhhsptsa@gmail.com // in need of officers, volunteers, and just paid members.
