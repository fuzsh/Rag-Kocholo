        "text": "There is no question of George Amundson’s status in Iowa State athletics history. A 1998 Iowa State Athletics Hall of Fame inductee, the All-American quarterback/running back was the captain of Iowa State’s football resurgence in the early 1970s under legendary head coach Johnny Majors. A native of Aberdeen, S.D., Amundson was a coveted recruit out of high school after excelling in four sports – football, track & field, basketball and baseball. Amundson tossed the discus (211 feet, 4 inches) farther than any U.S. high schooler had ever thrown it and arrived at Iowa State in 1969 to compete in football and track & field. He was a dual-threat quarterback before there was such a thing. Amundson put Cyclone football on the map by becoming the school’s first 1,000-yard rusher in 1971 (1,260) and as the only player in school history with over 2,000 passing yards and 2,000 rushing yards in a career. In 1972, Amundson led the Big Eight and ranked fourth nationally in total offense (2,387), earned All-America honors at quarterback and was the Big Eight Offensive Player of the Year, the same season Nebraska’s Johnny Rodgers won the Heisman Trophy. Amundson finished seventh in Heisman Trophy balloting. When his stellar Cyclone career ended, he owned or shared 17 school records. Amundson is still the Cyclones’ only first round NFL Draft pick when he was selected No. 14 overall by the Houston Oilers in the 1973 NFL Draft. Amundson’s heroics are legendary, but you may not know his entire story. Learn more about Amundson in this Forever True Q&A.\n\nWhen you were considering colleges to attend, were you looking at schools allowing you to compete in both football and track & field?\n\nGA: That was always the goal. Every coach I talked to that I was semi, or a little interested in, I told them that was the deal. I know spring football is a big deal, but I wanted to be able to compete in track & field. When I committed to Iowa State, Johnny Majors even signed a letter – and I still have it – that confirmed he would allow me to compete in track & field. As a freshman you weren’t eligible, and you can feel like leftovers. You’re not even involved, really, as a freshman. That year I went out for track & field. It really wasn’t much of a big deal. But then, I found out they (Coach Majors and staff) were moving (quarterback) Obert Tisdale to defense. I said, “Wait a minute, maybe they think I’m the quarterback.” So, I decided to make sure I went out for spring football. If I am going to try and lead teammates on Saturday afternoon, I best be there in the spring for the blood and sweat. It was my decision to make sure I was at the spring games too. I remember throwing in the Kansas Relays and I think it was (ISU teammate) Bob Matey waiting in a car. Once I finished throwing, we jumped in a car and drove back to Ames for the spring game.\n\nWhy did you pick Iowa State and head coach Johnny Majors\n\nGA: The only advice I got from my dad was, “You know George, you ought to consider the good Midwest culture vs. east coast, west coast schools.” That was all he said. I wanted to be an engineer. In fact, my uncle was a graduate of Iowa State, and he was vice president of Ingersoll Rand. That’s what I wanted to be like. I also wanted to compete against the Big Three from Kansas – (Doug) Knop, (Karl) Salb and (Steve) Wilhelm. They were the top three weight men (discus, shot put) in the country, and I wanted to go against them. When I met Coach Majors and his staff, they were all 20-year-old guys with longer hair, silk shirts unbuttoned down to their navel, just about. They wore fancy clothes, and they got my attention. When I got to know them a little bit, I knew this (Iowa State) was the place for me. I visited a bunch of schools, including the University of Tennessee (Johnny Majors’ alma mater). They flew my family down there. Every day I was there, Coach Majors called me, “How you doing, George? I know that’s a beautiful school with a lot of beautiful co-eds, but we really want you here at Iowa State.” (laughs). Even then at Tennessee, he was big stuff.\n\nAfter sitting out in 1969 because freshmen were ineligible, Amundson was a burgeoning star on the gridiron as a sophomore in 1970. The Cyclones were showing signs of progress and ended the year with a 5-6 mark. Amundson started the first three games at quarterback but began splitting time with junior college transfer Dean Carlson at signal-caller later in the year. Iowa State had some close calls, including a 29-28 loss to powerful Oklahoma in a game it led 21-0 in the second quarter. Amundson began seeing more time at running back and had a breakout game at Missouri. The Cyclones hadn’t won in Columbia since 1938 and Amundson showed the nation his incredible athletic skills by rushing for 135 yards and three touchdowns. He was also 4-of-6 passing for 47 yards. ISU was victorious 31-19 and the legend began to sprout.\n\nGA: I think I started the first three games at quarterback and then they kind of went with (Dean) Carlson. I ended up fooling around at running back and returned a couple of kickoffs. That year, we were playing at Missouri. We hadn’t beaten them down there in over 30 years. Their homecoming slogan read: “Iowa State Victory? Only in the Funnies.” Carlson starts the game and it’s like 20 mph winds. They (Missouri) kickoff to open the second half and Jeff Allen catches the ball, but he caught it on his knee at the 1-yard line. Majors turns to me and goes, “Amundson, go in there.” I came so close to telling him bullcrap. You send Carlson back in there from the 1-yard line! I didn’t. We worked it down a couple of plays and then I ran 77 yards for a touchdown.\n\nGA: (continued) One of my favorite stories was from that game. We had the ball with time running out. The international sign for taking a knee is the coach putting his hands up in the air. The game was over. Take a knee. Well, I’m not about to do that. The hash marks were wider then and I’m pretty close to the bench and I hear him (Majors), “Take a knee.” So, I do a quarterback sneak and get about nine yards. Majors is going nuts now on the sideline. “TAKE IT ON THE KNEE,” he screams. I’m in the huddle and I got a straight shot at Majors, and he goes, “TAKE IT ON THE KNEE!” I said, “But Coach, it’s going to hurt my average!” (laughs). Majors told that story all the time. We had good vibes after that win. Of course, when you are a kid, you don’t care about what the record was last year or the year before. You are thinking about winning every game. It’s hard for me to describe the feeling because we sort of expected to win. That’s what we are trying to do. It was an awesome feeling when you have a little positive feedback. That gives you a little more incentive.\n\nHeading into the 1971 season all indications led to Carlson, who was a senior, being the starting quarterback, a spot Amundson coveted. Undeterred, Amundson saw an opening at running back when injuries began to take its toll on the unit. He volunteered to switch to the backfield in 1971 and the rest is Cyclone history. Amundson produced the greatest season by a Cyclone rusher at the time, breaking the school single-season mark as ISU’s first 1,000-yard rusher (1,260). He also shattered the school standard for rushing touchdowns in a season with 15, which still ranks in ISU’s season Top 10. Amundson’s dual-threat ability was on full display. He also completed 10 passes for 237 yards and three touchdowns primarily on halfback passes. More important than Amundson’s individual statistics, however, was the success of the team. Iowa State recorded an 8-3 regular season mark – its only three losses were to Top 5 teams (Colorado, Oklahoma, Nebraska) – and secured the school’s first-ever bowl bid with an invitation to the Sun Bowl. The 1971 squad remains one of the finest in Cyclone history.\n\nGA: Remember Jerry Moses? He was going to be all-everything. But he had physical problems and we had like three running backs go down. I went to Majors and said, “I’ll play running back.” I moved to running back. I didn’t want to play part- time, I wanted to play all the time. It turned out great. We had such good linemen. (Joe) Marconi, (Ray) Harm, (Dave) Pittman, (Geary) Murdock and (Mike) Terrizzi. There was an air of confidence. I remember one time before a game the (offensive) line came up to me and asked how I felt. I said, “My legs feel like pistons.” (laughs). What a knucklehead thing to say, but I really felt that. And then getting to throw every once in a while, from the backfield made me feel even more special.\n\nIowa State played host to Oklahoma State on Nov. 20 in the final home game and Big Eight contest of the 1971 season. The Cyclones were 6-3 and on the verge of history. The Sun Bowl sent representatives to the game after the Cyclones walloped Missouri 45-17 the week before. There was a palpable buzz inside Clyde Williams Field on Senior Day. What happened next made the history books. The Cyclones annihilated the Cowboys, 54-0 behind an all-around team effort, but Amundson really stood out. The Cyclone star rushed for 146 yards with a school-record four rushing touchdowns. He also completed both pass attempts for 65 yards, adding another touchdown. After the game ended, the Cyclones escorted Majors off the field on their shoulders and the Sun Bowl scouts offered ISU an invitation to participate in its game in El Paso. The 54-point win was the largest margin of victory vs. a league opponent in school history until ISU defeated Texas Tech, 66-10 in 2016.\n\nGA: The hype was there. Majors mentioned: “You know boys, we got the Sun Bowl scouts in the stands.” We were just going to do our best. It was just one of those days where everything clicked. And even more so than the 54 points was the zero the defense allowed. (Keith) Schroeder, (Lawrence Hunt) Big Daddy and Merv Krakau, all those guys. What a special day. I remember years later I was in a hotel in Kansas City, and I see this young guy. He’s probably in his 30s, and I pointed up at a college football game on TV and said I used to do that for a living. And he said so did I. I find out it’s Sundiata Patterson (Cyclone football running back from 1990-92). I told him I’m George Amundson and he looked at me and said, “I tied one of your records!” (Patterson rushed for four touchdowns vs. Eastern Illinois in 1991 to tie Amundson’s Cyclone mark. The record is now five by Joel Lanning and Troy Davis, who did it twice) You score four touchdowns and then you get to throw one, how cool is that? Everything clicked, offensively and defensively. I do remember our team carrying Johnny Majors off the field. I do remember that. Everyone is grabbing him. It was a pretty neat day.\n\nIowa State was heading toward uncharted territory. Act like you’ve been there before? You couldn’t. It was impossible. There was excitement around Ames that was new to everyone. Once the Cyclones made it to El Paso, the team, especially Amundson, got their first taste of bowl festivities.\n\nGA: It (the excitement) sort of permeated the whole town. Whether you were at the gas station, or anywhere else, you could feel it. It was a definite aura at that time. We went down there (El Paso) at least a week ahead of time. Nobody had been through anything like this on our team. We would go to this venue and have a wonderful meal and then get together with some other group for a concert. The thing I remember the most, and it got me a letter from a little old lady in Iowa, was this one incident. They wanted me to go down to the courtyard in the middle of our hotel by a swimming pool. I went and a guy says he would like to take some pictures. This lady comes walking out and she had a mink coat on. It was a little chilly at the time. They wanted to get some photos to send back to Iowa because it’s warmer here vs. the snow in Iowa. We get on the diving board, and she takes off the mink coat and she has just a bikini on. They wanted me to pretend like we were trying throw each other in the water. And then they took a photo where she’s leaning over toward me and that makes the Des Moines Register. I get this letter, I still have it somewhere, that read: “George Amundson, my grandkids look at that newspaper and here we see a picture of you with this floozy.” (laughs).\n\nIowa State lost to No. 11 LSU, 33-15 in the Sun Bowl. Despite the loss, it was a huge step for the program. Amundson was among many stars back for the 1972 season. Majors was building a winner and the outlook for 1972 was positive. With Carlson graduating, Amundson was relieved to take over quarterbacking duties once again. Amundson didn’t disappoint, breaking ISU’s and the Big Eight’s total offense record with 2,387 yards. The 1972 season was highlighted by one of the most memorable games in Iowa State history. The third-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers came to town with a 24-game Big Eight unbeaten streak. Thanks to Amundson’s incredible performance, the Cyclones tied Nebraska, 23-23. Willie Jones caught a 24-yard TD toss from Amundson with :23 seconds on the clock to knot the game at 23-all. Clyde Williams Field erupted. It was mayhem as fans stormed the field to celebrate. ISU still needed to attempt the PAT for the win, and it took a significant amount of time to clear the field. Once cleared, Tom Goedjen missed the PAT and the game ended in a tie. Although disappointing, the tie was instrumental in helping the Cyclones secure a spot in the Liberty Bowl.\n\nGA: It was a great getting back to being a quarterback. It’s what I loved to play. I like to be in charge. Nebraska kicked off to us (on ISU’s final drive) and I believe we started at the 20-yard line. I felt like we had about a minute left or so. In your personal life, have you ever been out on the basketball court and everything you threw up was a swish? I mean, you couldn’t miss. I had that feeling against Nebraska on that last drive. Everything felt great. (Keith) Krepfle, boom! Ike Harris, boom! Willie, boom! It was just a wonderful feeling. The confidence was just soaring. We get past midfield and there’s Willie and I lofted it in there. He catches it and the place goes nuts. I’m standing in the middle of the field, and I look up at that corner, the Lincoln Way corner, the southwest corner, all that red (Nebraska fans) was just silent. I made sure they knew it was a touchdown and had my hands up like the referees do. I said, “We just beat them, yes!” Then I look up at the board and it says 23-23. Oh shoot, we need to kick the extra point. Of course, now the field is covered with students and fans. It took a while to clear that off. I am also the holder for (Tom) Goedjen. I pat him on the head a little bit and try not to make a big deal about it. You didn’t want to add any tension. Finally, the field gets cleared, and I hold, and he just hooked it. There was no standing there, “get in, get in, get in.” I felt so bad for him. It was like kissing your sister, I guess. Your shoulders are up high and now you are slumped over. It’s hard to celebrate a tie.\n\nIowa State faced Georgia Tech in the 1972 Liberty Bowl (Memphis) in a Tennessee homecoming for Coach Majors. It was an incredible game, as the Cyclones fell to the Yellow Jackets in the final minute, 31-30. Willie Jones had a 93-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and Amundson found Ike Harris in the end zone with 1:36 left on the clock to make it a 31-30 game. Amundson wanted to go for the win, and Majors agreed, sending in the offense for the two-point conversion attempt. Amundson drew up his favorite play, but it was smothered immediately by the defense and his rushed pass in the end zone fell incomplete. What most of the team didn’t know at the time was Majors had already decided he was leaving Iowa State to take the Pittsburgh job prior to the game. After a heartbreaking loss, Majors broke the news to the team. It was a very somber locker room.\n\nGA: We go down and score and we look up and we can kick it (PAT) to tie, but let’s go for the win. There’s a timeout and I remember standing there looking at Majors and he says, “What do you think, George?” I called most of the plays. He sent in some plays as well, but he gave me the reins. So, I told him, let’s run this play, which was my favorite play. He says, “Let’s do it. Go for it.” It was a sprint out draw. I fake to the tailback and then I sprint out a little bit and I can either pull up and run or throw it to Krepfle in the flat, (Larry) Marquardt deep and the wide receivers in the corner. As I faked to (Mike) Strachan, there must have been three or four Georgia Tech guys right in my face, so evidently, they knew what my favorite play was (laughs). I just let it go hoping Marquardt, who was 6-5 would catch it, but I overthrew him by a mile.\n\nGA: Our guys get together every year and we go to the Drake Relays. One of our guys, Van Holloway, who played football and was a javelin thrower, said he knew (Johnny was leaving) because he was on the student-athlete council. He was like the only player that knew. It was my last game too, but I’m sure it affected the younger guys certainly more than it affected a graduating senior. It wasn’t necessarily a surprise. Maybe back then, but I think it’s changing now, Iowa State seemed to be a grooming ground for a young coach to make his move up the ladder. Majors always said he wanted to coach his alma mater (Tennessee). He probably knew he had to do some other things to get there. It was semi-expected, but it was still a surprise.\n\nAmundson garnered a throng of awards when his career finished. He was a unanimous first team All-Big Eight selection, drawing more votes than any other player for the AP team to earn Big Eight Player-of-the -Year accolades. He was a Gold Sheet First Team All-American and a second-teamer by the Newspaper Enterpise Association (NEA). Amundson broke or tied 17 school records. His 53 touchdowns responsible and 31 rushing touchdowns still rank fourth all-time, respectively, on ISU’s career record list. Amundson finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy balloting, one of only four Cyclones to place in the Top 10 in the Heisman Trophy voting (Dwight Nichols, Troy Davis, Breece Hall). Who was the Heisman Trophy winner in 1972? It was Nebraska flanker Johnny Rodgers, who finished second to Amundson for the Big Eight’s top performer award.\n\nGA: I mention that, and people look at me like, what? I got that (Big Eight Player of the Year) only because the supporting staff, the linemen, running backs, made that even possible. It was certainly a feather in a guy’s cap, especially with one of the guys I beat was the Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nWith his Cyclone football career over, Amundson could refocus on track & field and begin preparation for the upcoming 1973 NFL Draft in his last semester in school. He competed in the 1973 Big Eight Outdoor Track & Field meet, finishing third in the discus and fifth in the shot. He also played in the East-West Shrine Game, the Hula Bowl and was invited to the prestigious College All-Star game which pitted the best collegiate players against the reigning Super Bowl champion in Soldier Field in late July. The 1973 NFL Draft was held Jan. 30-31 in New York City. Amundson made Cyclone history on the first day by being selected in the first round (No. 14 overall) by the Houston Oilers. He is still the only first round draft pick in Cyclone history and was the first Big Eight player chosen. Houston also had the first pick in the draft, selecting John Matuszak from Tampa, who ironically played for Earle Bruce in his one season at the school. Bruce was tabbed as the Cyclones’ successor to Majors in January of 1973. The Oilers were a struggling franchise. Coming off an abysmal 1-13 record in 1972, Houston had already earmarked Amundson as a running back.\n\nGA: I was going to be a running back from the beginning. I remember Earnel Durden was my running backs coach in my rookie year. They were playing me as a fullback. They put in a play for me for a sweep and option to throw. He’s showing me how to throw the football. (laughs). You take it how you want. They had no clue. I thought they would know I played quarterback. Back then the college all-stars played the Super Bowl winner at Soldier Field late in the summer (The Miami Dolphins, fresh off its perfect 17-0 season, defeated the All Stars, 14-3). I played in that and was coached by (John) McKay, who was still at USC. I missed the first three weeks of training camp because of playing in the All-Star game. Training camp was in Kerrville, Texas, and I’m one of 12 running backs. You do a drill, and you get one shot at it. It wasn’t easy to show them what you could do. I was the kind of running back that needed to have the ball 15, 20, 30 times. The most I ever carried in one (NFL) game was 13 times.\n\nGA: (continued) I loved it (The NFL). It would have been great to play a long time and been an All-Pro, but that wasn’t in the cards. I still enjoyed my time, four years officially. Certainly, you want to have more success and start from the beginning. Coming from a quarterback to the NFL now as a running back, my attitude was I was too good for special teams. I wasn’t playing, so then I was begging to be on special teams. That was certainly a change for me. I returned some kickoffs and got on the punt return team. My second year (1974), the first game of the year vs. San Diego, I scored three touchdowns (two by rush, one reception). I led the league for a few weeks anyway. Just ask (Dan) Pastorini (Houston quarterback) how good the line was (laughs). The year before I was drafted, I was watching Houston on Monday Night Football. It’s in the Astrodome and they are getting trounced. The camera pans in on a guy. He gives the camera the No. 1 middle finger. Dandy Don (Don Meredith) says, “Now there’s a fan who thinks his team is No. 1.” (laughs). I remember seeing that and then I get drafted by them.\n\nIowa State is still very special to Amundson. He returns to campus often with his former teammates and was back in town for Homecoming against West Virginia. His three daughters – Amy, Kelsey and Katy – all played collegiate volleyball. Katy was a member of the Iowa State volleyball team from 2002-05."
