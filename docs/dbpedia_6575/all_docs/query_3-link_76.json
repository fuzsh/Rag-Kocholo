        "text": "Math Teacher, Math Department Chair, and Cross Country Coach\n\nHuseby Dorm Faculty\n\nB.S. State University of NY College of Environmental Science and Forestry\n\nM.S. University of Massachusetts, Amherst\n\nI came to Putney as a teaching intern out of grad school for civil engineering. Once I settled in here I fell in love with the school and the profession. Helping a student get past a math-phobia or to gain new appreciation for math is the BEST!\n\nI haven’t taught anywhere other than Putney and I’m not sure I ever could. The way we approach teaching math is unique and challenging and I feel strongly that it is truly beneficial to the students.\n\nI have a BS in Forest Engineering from SUNY ESF and an MS in Civil Engineering with a concentration in Water Resources Engineering and a certification in Fish Passage Engineering from UMass Amherst.\n\nDirector of Technology & Library Services, Co-Academic Dean\n\nHistory and Humanities Writing & Research Teacher\n\nB.A. University of Massachusetts, Amherst\n\nM.L.I.S. University of South Carolina\n\nI’ve been at The Putney School since 2009 leading the Library and Technology programs, teaching the junior year Writing and Research class and sophomore world history, coordinating the ninth-grade seminar, and overseeing the Pond Hockey afternoon activity. I am deeply dedicated to helping students learn how to understand history, pursue a research question, and create a well constructed argument.\n\nI was born and raised in Eastern Massachusetts and spent my college years in the Pioneer Valley around Amherst. After working as a technical writer for an electronics company, I spent twelve years in Maine, first working as a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow for the Maine Folklife Center doing audio preservation, folklore and oral history work, and then as a Librarian and Technology Director at John Bapst Memorial High School in Bangor. It was while at John Bapst, teaching economics and digital art in a very traditional environment, that I found myself drawn towards project based learning and progressive teaching methods. This natural inclination led me to The Putney School .\n\nOutside of work, I hike, garden, play music on a daily basis and generally take advantage of the beautiful Southern Vermont landscape with my faithful English Setter Aesop.\n\nDirector of Center for Teaching and Learning\n\nA.L.B. Harvard University\n\nM.Ed. Harvard University Graduate School of Education\n\nI was attracted to the Putney School because I wanted to work in an educational community where differences are respected, embraced, and seen as resources to be used, not obstacles to overcome.\n\nAt The Putney School, we embrace and celebrate diversity, including neurodiversity – the idea that there is great variation in how we learn and process information. Here we know there is no average learner, there is no normal.\n\nI have worked with students who learn differently for almost thirty years. The brain is a highly dynamic organ and I am fascinated by the neuroscience of learning. Adolescence is a critical stage of brain development. I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to work with Putney students to help them understand how to shape their brains during this incredible period of neuroplasticity.\n\nAdmission Counselor\n\nBeing new here, my days are full of surprises. I’m currently enjoying to get to know the natural world here – mushrooms are abundant, birds are active, foxes are running around the fields.\n\nAs a teacher, I began as an environmental/outdoor/ecology educator working along the coast of Maine for nearly five years. I entered a more traditional classroom as math and science faculty at North Country School. After studying educational leadership with the Klingenstein Center (Teachers College Columbia University) last year, I just arrived at Putney eager to learn and teach alongside curious students and knowledgeable faculty. Outside of the classroom, I’m likely to be found riding a bike, running a trail or skiing in the backcountry. I’m chipping away at life goal to ride my bike 50 miles in all 50 states and hike all 115 peaks above 4,000 ft in the northeast.\n\nTutor, Center for Teaching and Learning\n\nB.A. Keene State College\n\nAfter helping roommates, friends and neighbors with their math homework, I realized that I needed to become a math teacher.\n\nI have a background in horse training and Centered Riding, I am bit of a horse whisperer… and a kid whisperer, too. My students say, “it just makes sense when you explain it.”\n\nWhatever it is, I don’t scare my students, I make them laugh and they learn without fear of judgement.\n\nI graduated from Putney School, and when I was ready to teach, I knew I didn’t want to teach anywhere else. Putney’s fundamental beliefs are my beliefs. I think that the Putney experience works because I see incredibly fine young men and women graduating off the hill, year after year.\n\nTutor, Center for Teaching and Learning, Girls Soccer Coach\n\nB.A. University of Pennsylvania\n\nThe strong sense of community is what brought me to Putney, and the opportunity to work with such interesting students, and such a dedicated and competent team of faculty and staff is what keeps me here.\n\nPutney embraces and celebrates students’ varied interests and diversity of learning styles, which I really appreciate.\n\nI continue to be surprised by the beauty of this campus. As the seasons change each year I am inspired by this wonderful and natural setting. I am also continually inspired by the creativity of the students.\n\nI grew up in Philadelphia and went to college at the University of Pennsylvania where I played soccer and got a B.A. in Environmental Studies in 2009. After college, I lived in Wyoming and worked as a tutor and soccer coach for some time before moving to Vermont in 2013.\n\nI love spending time with family and friends, playing soccer, snowboarding, gardening, and finding other reasons to be outside. I live with my lovely wife and wonderful daughter in Westminster West.\n\nAlumni Relations Manager\n\nWhite Cottage Dorm Faculty\n\nB.A. Kalamazoo College\n\nJ.D. University of Minnesota\n\nI knew as soon as I discovered Putney that I wanted to work here: it’s the natural beauty of the place, the authenticity of the people, the combination of idealism and dirty fingernails of its educational vision. I stay because I continue to feel connected to all of those things. From the food to the reflective and educational conversations during our opening meetings every year, to the purposeful nature of our work with the students, Putney is exceptionally REAL.\n\nThis is a good life.\n\nI’m a Michigander who has happily relocated to the welcoming hills of southern Vermont. I am most happy when I’m outdoors, whether moving through the world on a bike, on a surfboard, on skis, or in the water, thwacking a tennis or softball, walking with my dog, or simply reading and listening to the birds. The Putney students and alumni give me many things to love about my work, and because they are always changing and growing and asking good questions, they keep that work interesting and engaging, for which I’m very grateful.\n\nMath Teacher\n\nOld Boys Dorm Liaison\n\nB.S. Marlboro College\n\nM.A. Marlboro College\n\nI’ve spent my life looking for community and trying to build it; it brought me here as a student and it keeps me here as a teacher.\n\nEveryone here, students and adults alike, wants you to to succeed. Whether you’re a kid or a teacher, everyone here is rooting for you.\n\nPutney is different from the other schools where I’ve worked because at the highest level (administration, board) the school believes that the kids mean well, want to learn, and if we can mostly get out of their way and just offer some gentle guidance, they’ll do good things. Teachers often think that elsewhere, but it’s great to see it as a driving force in the institution.\n\nI grew up in New Jersey and Israel. In my sophomore year of high school I came to Putney as a boarding student. After graduating, I worked at Mount Snow, attended Marlboro College where I worked for their Outdoor Program and completed a degree in physics with a focus on astronomy and computational methods. From there I continued to work in outdoor education for the better part of a decade before coming full circle. My old advisor from Putney helped me get a taste of classroom instruction, and after deciding that it was a good fit I completed my MA in Marlboro College’s Teaching for Social Justice program. My wife and I moved onto campus in the fall of 2015, and we now live in the same dorm as I did when I first arrived here as a 16-year-old student.\n\nDevelopment Associate\n\nI love learning about people and hearing their truths. I enjoy getting people excited and educating them about new things, especially ideas that I am passionate about. I am an artist at heart, however my passion flows as I begin my journey here at The Putney School. So few individuals get a chance to experience their life’s purpose and walk the path of their soul journey. I am an exception. I did not search for Putney. Putney found me, presenting itself as an embracing community with a universal awareness of individuals authentically growing into themselves, a home away from home, and a space for all to continue walking their journey. It feels fulfilling to be on this path of uplifting philanthropy in service to The Putney School.\n\nSpanish Teacher\n\nI was born and raised in Honduras, Central America. I graduated from the school of laws and practiced law prior to moving to North Carolina in 2002. I first began working with youth in the USA as an Americorps member working with College Foundation of North Carolina and minority groups to promote access to higher education. I came to live and love Vermont while studying at the School of International Training and graduated with a Masters in Sustainable Development with a concentration in Monitoring and Evaluation. I then returned to North Carolina and worked for almost a decade with youth leadership projects for a social justice organization and then made a career change into university research. After a few years of coordinating and assisting research at UNC Chapel Hill, I decided to go back to my loving roots: working with youth! I am very excited to be part of a very artistic and multi-talented community here at The Putney School.\n\nDevelopment Database Manager\n\nbCRE-Pro Blackbaud University\n\nA.S. Northwestern CT Community College\n\nB.S. Southern Vermont College\n\nElizabeth’s fundraising career started in 1995, working with The American Chestnut Foundation. Her behind-the-scenes role in Putney’s development office has kept her quite busy since she started in 2006.

I came close to it, but what I appreciate most is that the education here at The Putney School expands beyond the classroom encouraging an ongoing learning among both faculty and students. Additionally, I’ve known about The Putney School for all of the years that I have lived in Southern Vermont and I’ve had nothing but deep admiration for the model and level of education here!”\n\nShanta Lee is a writer, photographer, journalist whose work has been featured in The Massachusetts Review, PRISM, ITERANT Literary Magazine, Palette Poetry, BLAVITY, DAME Magazine, The Crisis Magazine, Rebelle Society, and is one of the writers for the Ms. Magazine Blog.

Across my broad range of skills, I most appreciate surfacing the unseen.\n\nWhat is someone’s story under the surface of their face and presentation? What is forgotten to human memory that should be reclaimed? Or, most simply, how can I share the sense or soul of a place with someone who may not ever travel there?\n\nIt comes down to nurturing my hunger for curiosity while encouraging others to dive down their own rabbit holes of curiosity.”\n\nNurse\n\nRegistered Nurse\n\nPronouns: She/her/hers\n\nI came into school nursing about 7 years ago after a decade of hospital nursing. I was unsure where this path was going to lead me, but I am pleased to say I have never been happier. I grew up in Stockholm, Sweden and Putney is the first workplace that parallels my love and philosophies around the natural world, a holistic lifestyle, and adventure, much like my upbringing.\n\nWhen I’m not working with Putney students and their families, I am usually found outdoors on top of a mountain, near the ocean, or in my kitchen with my husband and three children. We live on our family farm in Rockingham, VT.\n\nCeramics Teacher\n\nBachelor of Applied Arts in Ceramics\n\nProgram in Artisanry, Boston University\n\nWhat brought me to Putney was a phone call in March 1998 asking if I would be willing to fill in for the ceramics teacher who got ill and had to stop teaching. I had been a full-time potter in Brattleboro and the idea of teaching ceramics to teenagers at this infamous progressive high school intrigued me so I said yes.\n\nWhat keeps me here 25 years later is the rush that comes from facilitating the discovery of young people’s creativity, sharing my passion for clay, giving back what I have learned and accomplished, continually learning from my students, and being in a growth-ful, stimulating, challenging environment among vibrant young people.\n\nIn 1983, I co-founded the Brattleboro Clayworks, a potter’s collective in Brattleboro, Vt. Since then, I have been a professional potter offering a line of colored clay items. In 2004 I set up my own studio in my home in West Brattleboro where I currently do my clay work.\n\nI have also taught a number of colored clay workshops at craft centers around the northeast where I have had the opportunity to share my enthusiasm for the unusual and exciting technique involving working with colored clays.\n\nDevelopment Associate\n\nA.B. Princeton University\n\nNo amount of prose could adequately encapsulate the visceral joy I feel while in the Green Mountain State. And no place synthesizes and distills the ethos and practice of what drew me here quite like The Putney School.\n\nWhether art, science, performance, introspection, exercise, leisure, work, support, or simply existing as a person in this world, The Putney School is a place where you can do it, whatever ‘it’ is, to the fullest extent.\n\nI have spent time working with music, design, nature, policy, and governance. I now work in a place where I can, and must, do them all. It is truly a gift to work in the Development Office at The Putney School.\n\nHistory Teacher and History Department Chair\n\nNoyes Dorm Liaison\n\nB.A. University of Massachusetts Dartmouth\n\nM.A. University of Montana\n\nPh.D. University of Montana\n\nI came to Putney because the school embodies my core values as a teacher: trust in students, an emphasis on exploration, and a commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration. My goal in all courses is to help students pursue the big questions that matter to them. Along the way, they will begin the humbling, lifelong process of confronting history’s biggest questions: what suffering has engendered our privileges? What has been lost that cannot be recovered? What can we learn from the past to lead just lives?\n\nBefore I came to Putney, I taught courses on the history of capitalism, law and politics, and slavery and emancipation at the University of Montana. I have mostly focused on American history, but I am always pushing myself to learn about other areas and topics.\n\nI began my career teaching secondary English, and I am delighted to work with teenagers again. When not teaching, you can find me riding my bike around town, baking bread, and listening to sad old country songs.\n\nMusic Co-Director\n\nB.M. in Music Education, Northwestern University\n\nI’m a music teacher and opera singer who taught voice lessons at Putney for eight years before joining as the music co-director. I feel truly blessed to have landed at a progressive school that values a growth mindset, where students and teachers believe in the capacity to learn no matter the starting point. With a deep-rooted passion for both performing and educating, I am dedicated to guiding students on a musical exploration towards creativity and excellence. My mission goes beyond teaching notes; it extends to building confidence in each student and helping them discover and enjoy their unique voice. Through my background in vocal training, as well as clarinet, I aim to instill a love for the performing arts while empowering students to discover their individual strengths.\n\nMy summers are filled with work in a professional opera company, TUNDI Productions, that runs the Wagner in Vermont Festival in Brattleboro, VT each August. I wear many hats for TUNDI including executive director, set builder, artistic director, costume designer and diva. I love all aspects of the theater and am thrilled to have the opportunity to collaborate on the yearly musical at Putney as well!\n\nDirector of College Counseling\n\nNoyes Dorm Faculty\n\nMy name is Dan Raffety and I am the new Director of College Counseling. I attended Northfield Mt. Hermon, earned a BA in History from Connecticut College, and then completed an MA in Liberal Arts from St. John’s College in Santa Fe. I have eleven years experience in college counseling from two different schools: Olney Friends School, a Quaker boarding school in rural Ohio with a similar farm-work program as Putney, and Elgin Academy, a private day school in the Chicago suburbs. I have counseled hundreds of students from various backgrounds and parts of the world; they’ve matriculated to numerous colleges across the country and several international universities. I believe that each student should prioritize finding a college that will help them continue to develop their character, abilities, and passions; provide an environment that is as safe as possible for them; and encourage them to embrace new experiences and challenges. I am excited to work with Putney students and help them through this important odyssey!\n\nVermont will be the 8th state that I have resided in (CT, RI, MA, NM, OH, IL) and I am delighted to be back in New England. I started my career as an educator at Link Community in School in Newark, NJ teaching U.S. History to 8th graders. This will be the first time in 17 years that I am not teaching History, so I welcome any conversations about The Persian Empire, The Celts, Pancho Villa, Robert Smalls, Jeanette Rankin, Thaddeus Stevens, the 1830s, or any historical topics/eras. Outside of College and History, I enjoy working out, reading, comic books, horror movies, numerous musical genres (Metal, Ska, Hip Hop, Punk, Outlaw Country, etc.), and seafood.\n\nDirector of Counseling and Wellness\n\nB.A. in Religious Studies, Youngstown State University\n\nM.ED in Counseling Education, University of Akron\n\nThe mission of The Putney School connects strongly to my personal view of education. I view learning as both external and internal. I believe students at The Putney School are not only challenged academically, but they are also encouraged to learn about themselves. In this way I believe The Putney School is holistic in its model of student learning and personal development.\n\nI came to The Putney School with well over two decades of work in higher education. At differing colleges and universities I have worked in administration and mental health. Throughout my career I have focused on both mental health and diversity, equity and inclusion. As a first generation person of Cape Verdean ethnicity, I believe mental health and racial justice are fundamentally intertwined.\n\nI am excited to be a member of The Putney School family for many years to come.\n\nMath Teacher\n\nNoyes Dorm Faculty\n\nI’ve been teaching high school and college math for more than 20 years, and came to The Putney School in 2022. What I love about teaching here is that I am able, and encouraged, to teach the way I’ve always wanted to: strong connections with students, lots of student choices, a focus on learning over grades, and a deep understanding over superficial learning.\n\nI love getting to know my students in and out of the classroom. I love challenging my students, and seeing them rise to the challenge. I love the ways students take ownership and leadership. Teaching here is so much fun!\n\nOther things I think are fun: dancing (Morris, contra, tango, waltz, swing), learning circus skills, swimming (especially long open water swims), skiing, hiking, feeling useful, and playing strategy games with friends.\n\nMusic Co-Director\n\nB.M. & B.A. Keene State College\n\nM.M. Peabody Conservatory of Johns Hopkins University\n\nA.D. Peabody Conservatory of Johns Hopkins University\n\nIt has been really wonderful to work closely with some really gifted, self-motivated, and passionate young people. The students here keep me energized for music. Putney has a musical heart and you can see that in the sing program and in the flurry of daily life in the music building.\n\nI am continually surprised by the down to earth traditions of Putney. From the farm to the costumed parade with a giant puppet to the hand-drawn diplomas… I anticipate learning of many more quirks in the coming year!\n\nI grew up in New England and after spending some time away in Baltimore and Los Angeles, I was happy to return. I have been involved in music my entire life and have worked in classical and jazz, in concert and recording, performing as well as mixing and engineering, and the whole time I have been actively teaching and in education. I am so lucky to work in music that it is difficult to separate work from play. In my free time, I have an interest in literature and philosophy which I pursue as a hobby and have also been known to swing a ping-pong paddle from time to time.\n\nPrintmaking and Painting Teacher\n\nB.A. Sarah Lawrence College\n\nM.F.A. Vermont College of Fine Arts\n\nHelen Schmidt is an artist-teacher whose work currently combines intaglio, artisan papers, and oil paint to create richly textured prints. Helen is interested in the possibility art has to effect personal and social transformation.

Stephens is an award-winning and internationally exhibited photographer, educator, and scholar in southern Vermont. Working as a photojournalist for over two decades, he has contributed to newspapers and magazines throughout New England while also serving as the Photo Editor of the Brattleboro Reformer from 2007 to 2013.

I’m so looking forward to seeing these young, talented minds embrace rigorous academics and evolve within their passions. Students here are confident and lead with honesty and curiosity. Each individual at Putney learns and creates while feeling seen, heard, and appreciated. I was drawn to Putney by the chance to collaborate with dynamic professionals, contribute my experiences and perspectives, and share new adventures.\n\nDirector of Development\n\nIt is an honor to be serving Putney, a school I so deeply believe in, in this role, at this time. A previous Putney chapter included teaching dance, heading the arts department, and directing the evening arts program. Previous chapters have also included being director of the arts at another independent school, teaching dance in a multitude of settings (from colleges to community centers), as well choreographing and performing nationally and internationally. After years of inner-city teaching (in NYC and LA), it is a privilege to be on Putney’s bucolic hill working to ensure access for all who wish to call it home. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with and learn from all within the Putney community, to collaboratively lift up and support Putney into the future. Thank you.\n\nMath Teacher\n\nOld Girls Dorm Faculty\n\nBS in Applied Mathematics with a focus in STEM Education\n\nI came to Putney from the mountains of Western North Carolina, where I taught all sorts of Maths at a small non-profit private school that focused on Integral Education. I love exploring the challenges of Mathematics from the perspective of logic, puzzle solving, and having fun with the mental exercise that comes with it. I have a deep love for board games, puzzles of all sorts, D&D, and have so much fun exploring challenges together like they are games. My recent background had me working with students as their mathematics teacher, but also as a mentor, coach, and outdoor guide. I find so much joy in watching students develop and grow in relationship to their mental, social, emotional, aesthetic, and physical strands of being.\n\nWhen I’m not teaching Mathematics, you can find me playing music, dancing, climbing, running, playing volleyball, skiing, playing video games, hiking, backpacking, reading, or just relaxing with friends."
