        "text": "LAB DIRECTOR\n\nDr. Gary Pierce is a Professor and Chair of the Department of Health and Human Physiology, and the Russell B. Day and Florence D. Day Endowed Chair in Liberal Arts & Sciences. He is also Professor of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension (secondary appt) at the University of Iowa. Dr. Pierce is a faculty member in the Abboud Cardiovascular Research Center, the Environmental Health Sciences Research Center and the Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center in the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, and a fellow of the American Heart Association (FAHA) and the American Physiological Society (FAPS). He received a PhD in Applied Physiology and Kinesiology with a focus in cardiovascular exercise physiology from the University of Florida and completed postdoctoral training in vascular aging/human physiology in the Department of Integrative Physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder. He has been a faculty member at the University of Iowa since 2011.\n\nFaculty profile Google Scholar PubMed Publications ResearchGate\n\nDr. Armstrong is originally from Wales, UK and received his BSc(Hons) from Cardiff Metropolitan University. Following this, Matt moved to Hobart, Australia where he received his PhD from the University of Tasmania, which was followed by a 1-year postdoc involving epidemiological research. Matt’s research is broadly concerned with cardiovascular disease, and in particular, the role of high blood pressure on vascular health.\n\nKristen Davis is originally from Durban, South Africa. She received her BS in Exercise Science with a minor in Health Science from South Dakota State University and went on to compete a MS in Nutrition and Exercise Science. Kristen’s research concerns cardiovascular disease mechanisms and exercise as a strategy for its prevention and treatment, with a current focus on central arterial stiffness and pressure hemodynamics in postpartum women. When not in the lab, she enjoys the gym as her go-to stress reliever, traveling, being outdoors, and trying new recipes.\n\nEmma received her BS in Physiology, Neuroscience, and Behavior from Illinois State University and MS in Health and Human Physiology from the University of Iowa. Her primary research interests include the effects of large-artery stiffness and hypertension on end-organ vascular flow, and how those changes may link to cerebrovascular and cognitive dysfunction. During her free time, she enjoys powerlifting, riding her motorcycle, and going on hikes with her dog.\n\nAmy received her BSN from Mount Mercy College in 2002. She returned to school in 2012 and received her MSN from Mount Mercy University in 2014, while raising three children. She joined the Pierce Lab in April 2015 as part of the AHA SFRN preeclampsia study. Since then, Amy has greatly expanded her research skills within the Pierce Lab, becoming an integral part of the team. As a Research Specialist, Amy keeps the lab running smoothly by training new students and lab personnel, coordinating studies, recruiting study participants and phlebotomy, working with EHS for the lab audits, collaborating with other research labs, and many other crucial tasks vital to the lab. In her free time, Amy enjoys exploring nature, hiking, kayaking, camping, rock hounding, reading, and making jewelry.\n\nBlair graduated from Iowa State University with a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology and a minor in General Business in 2023. Coming from the small town of Ely, IA, she dedicated three years of hands-on work at the Clinical Vascular Research Lab, shaping her undergraduate journey. Alongside her studies, Blair thrived as a Peer Mentor and Teaching Assistant in the Kinesiology department. Driven by a passion for evidence-based medicine, Blair dreams of making a difference in cardiovascular health as a perfusionist. Beyond her academic pursuits, she finds joy and balance in the heat yoga and HIIT classes. In her free time, Blair is lost in the pages of a good book or exploring nature's wonders with her faithful canine companion.\n\nTucker is a fourth-year student at the University of Iowa on the pre-medical track. Originally from Decorah, Iowa, he has dedicated the past three years to providing patient care in various capacities, including roles as a phlebotomist and patient care technician. He’s looking forward to contributing to the research that pushes medicine forward. Tucker plans to pursue medical school following a gap year enriched with additional research experience. Beyond his academic and research pursuits, he enjoys weightlifting and spending plenty of time outdoors with friends and family.\n\nHailey is a third year at the University of Iowa studying Human Physiology on the Pre-Med track and is from Atkins, Iowa. She is the Academic Director of the University’s Medicus Pre-Medical Club and a nursing assistant on the cardiothoracic surgery floor at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Hailey is also a part of the Gymnastics Club and spends time as a volunteer in the Main OR. When not studying, she enjoys reading and traveling!\n\nMeaghan Smith is a senior at the University of Iowa studying Human Physiology on the Pre-PT track. She is attending Physical Therapy school at DMU following her graduation. Meaghan is interested in researching the barriers and enablers of physical activity for women with preeclampsia, ultimately providing insight into targeting an increase in physical activity in this population. Outside of school, she enjoys weightlifting, spending time with friends and family, and traveling.\n\nNathan is from Bettendorf, Iowa, and is a second-year Biomedical Sciences major at the University of Iowa. Nathan serves as the President of the Iowa Tennis Club and Outreach Coordinator for Camp Kesem. Outside of studying and extracurricular activities, he stays active by playing pickleball, pick-up basketball, and lifting weights along side friends."
