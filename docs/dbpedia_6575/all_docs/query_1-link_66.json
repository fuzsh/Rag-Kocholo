        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nTyson Veidt\n\nTitle\n\nDefensive Coordinator / Safeties\n\nCincinnati football head coach Scott Satterfield announced the hire of Tyson Veidt as defensive coordinator in January. Veidt comes to the Bearcats from Iowa State where he served as the associate head coach and linebackers coach, helping lead the Big 12 Conference's best defense over the last eight years.\n\nVeidt (pronounced Vite) was named the National Linebacker Coach of the Year by Football Scoop in 2017. He was a nominee for the Broyles Award, given to the nation's top assistant coach, in 2018.\n\n\"We are excited to welcome Tyson Veidt and his family to Cincinnati,\" Satterfield said. \"Having coached at Iowa State for eight years, Tyson knows the Big 12 and helped build ISU into one of the country's top defenses. He's coached outstanding linebackers during his career, and proven to be a tremendous developer of talent. He brings head coaching experience and ties to Ohio, which I believe will serve our program well as we look to take great strides in our second year in the Big 12 this coming fall.\"\n\nA Logan, Ohio native, he also coached at Toledo from 2014 to 2015 and was the head coach at NCAA Division III Bluffton (Ohio) University from 2008 to 2013. Prior to his time at Bluffton, he made stops at Saint Vincent (Pa.), West Virginia, Muskingum and Indiana.\n\nVeidt's leadership on defense and in the linebackers room helped transform Iowa State into one of the nation's top defenses during his tenure with the Cyclones, beginning in 2016.\n\nSince Veidt joined Iowa State as part of Matt Campbell's staff in 2016, the Cyclones lead the Big 12 in:\n\nScoring Defense (23.2)\n\nTotal Defense (354.7)\n\nOpponent Yards Per Play (5.3)\n\nOpponent Rushing (133.4)\n\nOpponent Yards Per Carry (3.8)\n\nAdditionally, Iowa State's 5.1 yards per play allowed since 2020 is the ninth-fewest in the nation.\n\nVeidt coached a pair of All-America linebackers at ISU in Joel Lanning (2017) and Mike Rose (2020). Lanning was a quarterback his first four years of college before Veidt helped transform him into a star linebacker.\n\nRose was the 2020 Big 12 Defensive MVP after leading the league in tackles (96) and interceptions (five).\n\nOverall, Veidt helped coach 45 all-conference defenders since arriving in Ames, Iowa. Nine of his linebackers received All-Big 12 honors a total of 18 times. Three times (2017, 2018, 2019), all three of his starting linebackers received All-Big 12 recognition.\n\nAmong his Iowa State linebackers were three-time All-Big 12 selection and former Cleveland Brown Willie Harvey and two-time All-Big 12 performer Jake Hummel, who played for the Los Angeles Rams in 2022.\n\nVeidt's time at Iowa State coincided with the Cyclones' best stretch of success in school history. Iowa State went to six bowls in eight years and finished in the CFP Final Top 25 twice – No. 24 in 2018 and No. 10 in 2020.\n\nIowa State had one of the best seasons in school history in 2020, finishing 9-3 overall and 8-1 in the Big 12, capping the season with a 34-17 victory over Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nThe Cyclones led the Big 12 and ranked eighth in the country in rush defense (103.1) in 2020.\n\nIn 2022, Iowa State had a historic defense, leading the Big 12 in scoring defense (20.2), total defense (285.6), rush defense (107.3) and pass defense (178.2). ISU's total defense also ranked fourth in the nation.\n\nIn 2023, the Cyclones ranked second in the Big 12 in total defense (363.2) and rush defense (134.2). Veidt mentored sophomore Caleb Bacon, who finished the 2023 season as the Power 5's fifth-highest rated linebacker (89.2), according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nIn two years at Toledo, Veidt helped the Rockets to a 19-6 record and a pair of bowl wins.\n\nHe served as the head coach at Bluffton for six seasons (2008-13), guiding the Beavers to 40 school records, while turning around a program that won only one game the year before he arrived.\n\nAdditionally, Veidt was a graduate assistant at Indiana and West Virginia, including the 2004 and 2005 Big East Champion teams.\n\nHe graduated from Muskingum, where he lettered twice in football, in 1996 with a degree in pre-physical therapy. He has a master's degree in athletic coaching education from WVU.\n\nVeidt and his wife, Mandy, a New Philadelphia, Ohio, native, have a son, Teddy, and twin girls, Lamonica and Guiliana."
