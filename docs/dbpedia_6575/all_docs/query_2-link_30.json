        "text": "Brock Purdy has drawn so much well-deserved attention that he’s become the most famous player to use our state's football fields as his personal path toward the Super Bowl.\n\nMake that the most recent No. 1, at least until someone else comes along someday. Which could happen.\n\nWhere the former Iowa State star’s significance ranks in the grand scheme, however, is up for discussion. Does what the San Francisco 49ers quarterback has accomplished this season and during his surprising two-season career rank up there in the Kurt Warner altitude? Warner played at Cedar Rapids Regis and Northern Iowa.\n\nOr let’s go back even further, to what Roger Craig did while winning three Super Bowl rings. The Davenport native and former Nebraska star is right up there, too.\n\nMore: 'It's his safe place.' Why Ames is still a home away from home for 49ers star Brock Purdy\n\nPurdy. Warner. Craig.\n\nThat’s 25 million, 18 million and 78 million Google-search pages as of last week of the most iconic NFL players who used our great state as stepping stones to the Super Bowl.\n\nThat’s rare air, folks, for anyone.\n\nIn no specific order, they’re my top three NFL players who starred at either an Iowa high school, an Iowa college or both. This list is a crapshoot in which everyone has an opinion, depending on your favorite team, player, recollection and definition of what it takes to be part of our big-time professional football stratosphere. It’s my crapshoot.\n\nStars from our state's Super Bowl historical stroll are recalled here again, considering what’s about to transpire Sunday when the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs tussle in Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas (5:30 p.m., CBS). Specifically for this column, this is about Purdy and his stature alongside Warner. They’re two wonderful NFL Super Bowl success stories that played out before our eyes.\n\nWho is more remarkable? That’s for you to decide, but labeling 1 and 1A seems all right.\n\n“Just having the opportunity to play in a Super Bowl is beyond words,” Warner told the Register during a phone conversation last week. “Do what you can with that opportunity you’ve earned, and then celebrate whatever may come with it.”\n\nPurdy came out of nowhere – the Mr. Irrelevant last pick of the 2022 draft – to help the 49ers into a Super Bowl in just his second season. The former Iowa State great has been so good over the last 17 games that he's been mentioned as a candidate for NFL MVP. Others have said Purdy is a product of his environment – being surrounded by great players and facilitating their success. Again, that’s for you to decide.\n\n“I don’t understand that negative narrative,” Warner said. “What would Brock be on another team? He’s not on another team. He’s on a very talented team with guys around him that can make plays.\n\n“All you can do is play for team that you play for, if that makes sense.”\n\nWarner, the former Hy-Vee shelf-stocker, played in three Super Bowls – two for St. Louis and one for Arizona. He was MVP of the 2000 Super Bowl while playing for the Rams. He's a two-time NFL MVP. He’s a Pro Football Hall of Famer.\n\nWe live in an \"everything’s better today\" world, which explains why no one’s talking about one of the best to play Iowa high school football. That’d be Roger Craig, a former Davenport Central star who played on three Super Bowl championship teams. He was the first player to score three touchdowns in a Super Bowl during the 49ers’ victory against Miami in 1984.\n\nA season later, the knees-high runner became the first NFL player to both rush and receive passes for 1,000 yards or more during a season. Three seasons after that, in 1988, Craig was the NFL offensive player of the year.\n\nThree Super Bowl rings – 1985, 1989 and 1990. A trailblazer for running backs to not only run with the football, but also catch it. And he’s not in the NFL Hall of Fame?\n\nPurdy, Warner, Craig.\n\nOthers who made their mark on NFL, Super Bowl\n\nThe Purdy subplot brings to mind the many other iconic NFL players with state-of-Iowa ties and Super Bowl experiences. We're not trying to name every single guy here. A dozen people could make a dozen different lists. You decide.\n\nMatt Blair (Iowa State): A six-time NFL Pro Bowl linebacker led the Cyclones to their first bowl, the 1971 Sun Bowl. He was a 1973 All-American after recording 77 tackles, three forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. He was so good that the Vikings selected him in the second round of the 1974 NFL. He went on to have a 12-season career with the Vikings before retiring in 1985. His career included playing in the 1975 and 1977 Super Bowls.\n\nTim Dwight (Iowa) was an Iowa Hawkeyes legend while starring in the 1990s, but he also had his moment in the Super Bowl spotlight. The year was 1998, he was playing for Atlanta, after the Falcons picked him in the fourth round of that season’s draft. Dwight makes this list for his 94-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Denver Broncos. At Iowa in 1997, Dwight was a consensus first-team All-American, and finished seventh in Heisman Trophy balloting.\n\nEd Podolak (Iowa): The former Atlantic High School star who went on to play at Iowa was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the second round of the 1969 draft. He was a rookie on the Chiefs team that won the Super Bowl that season. He enjoyed a nine-year career from 1969 to 1977. He’s a member of the University of Iowa Athletics Hall of Dame and Chiefs’ Hall of Honor member.\n\nBob Sanders (Iowa): The “Hit Man” is what they called him at Iowa, and he was one of the greatest safeties to play in the NFL. A human wrecking ball, Sanders was possibly the most significant player in the Indianapolis Colts’ 29-17 victory against the Bears in the 2007 Super Bowl. All he did was help hold what was a physical and good Bears rushing game to just 111 yards, but there’s more. He had three tackles. He forced a fumble. He returned an interception 38 yards with 10 minutes left in the game. The dagger? You bet. And then some.\n\nSeneca Wallace (Iowa State): It’s hard to beat the quarterback’s iconic 2002 season. The Cyclones were backed up near the goal line Cy vs. Hawk at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, then Wallace performed magic with two third-down conversion passes to Jack Whitver. Seneca’s play helped turn a 17-point Cyclones deficit into a 36-31 victory. Later that season, his back-and-forth touchdown against Texas Tech still is the most exciting play in school history. During the thrilling passing play that broke down, Wallace eluded one tackler after another during what officially went down as a 12-yard back-and-forth run that on closer examination actually equaled 112 yards. Oh by the way, Wallace was on the Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl roster in 2005 as both a quarterback and receiver.\n\nSunday, it’s Brock Purdy.\n\nAnd don't forget about former Hawkeye George Kittle, Purdy's 49ers teammate, who is talented enough to play a big role in Sunday's game.\n\nBut much of the spotlight and hype is on Purdy, fair or unfair.\n\n“I’m excited for him,” Warner said. “I’m not hung up on expectations and defining guys in their first or second years of their careers. What he does is special. For some reason we want to compare him to Patrick Mahomes (Chiefs) and Lamar Jackson (Baltimore Ravens). Why? Why?\n\n“Brock is in the Super Bowl. He’s a starting quarterback in the Super Bowl. Let’s celebrate that. The young man is in the Super Bowl.”\n\nIowa State columnist Randy Peterson is in his 52nd year writing sports for the Des Moines Register.
