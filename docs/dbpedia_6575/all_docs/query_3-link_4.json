        "text": "Former Iowa State All-American and six-time NFL Pro Bowler Matt Blair died Thursday at the age of 70.\n\nBlair, who manned the rover position, starred immediately at Iowa State after transferring from Northeast Oklahoma Junior College. He led the Cyclones to their first bowl, the 1971 Sun Bowl, to cap an 8-4 season. He was so good in that bowl game that he was named the game’s outstanding defensive player, despite Iowa State’s loss against LSU.\n\nBlair sat out the 1972 season with an injury suffered in the first game. The NCAA awarded him another year of eligibility, and he made the most of it. He was a 1973 All-American after recording 77 tackles, three forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries.\n\nBlair was selected in the second round of the 1974 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings, for whom he would star for 12 seasons between 1974-85.\n\nHe was inducted into the Iowa State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Minnesota Vikings Ring of Honor in 2012.\n\nAdditionally, Blair was the 158th selection into the Sunday Des Moines Register’s Iowa Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n=====\n\nEditor's Note: Below is Randy Peterson's story honoring Matt Blair that appeared in the July 11, 1999 Des Moines Sunday Register.\n\n=====\n\nDon Shula was bewildered.\n\n\"All of a sudden this guy, Matt Blair, was jumping up like he was on a trampoline,\" the former coach of the Miami Dolphins said in a 1970s interview with a Miami newspaper. \"Then all of a sudden he's blocking my guy's punt.\"\n\nShula, who happened to be on the NFL rules committee, got the last laugh; getting a running start before leaping for the purpose of gaining an advantage eventually became banned.\n\nToday, this enterprising former Iowa State star becomes the 158th selection into the Sunday Register's Iowa Sports Hall of Fame, and it is not only because he devised something even the game's best coaches could not stop without getting a rule changed.\n\nIt also is because Blair was one of the best at his position between 1971 and 1985, first at Iowa State, then as a member of the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nSun Bowl most valuable player. All-American. Six-time Pro Bowl selection. Super Bowl participant.\n\nWhen it came to playing defense, Blair was a monster.\n\n\"When we went to the 4-4 defense in 1971, Matt was our roving linebacker; we called him a monster man,\" former Iowa State coach Johnny Majors said. \"He played in the open field, kind of like a combination safety and linebacker. Sometimes, he'd play up close along the line of scrimmage\n\n\"I can't even imagine what kind of a career he would have had if he wouldn't have been hurt.\"\n\nThe injury remains a sore point with Majors.\n\n\"The most unfortunate thing about Matt Blair was that he was selected co-captain with George Amundson before the 1972 season, and the Saturday before our first game, in a preseason scrimmage no less, he got a cheap shot by a player I ended up dismissing from the squad,\" Majors said. \"He hit Matt with a blow below the knee and he was out for the season. It was very costly to our football team.\"\n\nProbably costly to Blair, too. He was granted an additional season of eligibility and escaped further damage while playing well enough in 1973 to become one of the Vikings' two second-round draft selections.\n\n\"If he wouldn't have been hurt in college, no question, he would have been one of the top three players selected in the draft,\" former Vikings coach Bud Grant said. \"But Matt hurt his knee in college and I don't think he ever fully recovered. He had it surgically repaired, but it never had the same flexibility.\n\n\"In spite of that, he was a great player for us. Right from the start of his career, we knew we had something special.\"\n\nBlair was an immediate hit at Iowa State, too. His first season after transferring from Northeast Oklahoma Junior College ended in the Cyclones' first bowl — the 1971 Sun Bowl. The Cyclones lost to Louisiana State 33-15, but Blair made such an impression he was named the game's defensive most valuable player.\n\n\"Not bad for a guy who walked on his junior-college football team,\" Blair said from his office in Burnsville, Minn. \"They told me that I had to try out for the junior-college team before they would give me a scholarship. What they didn't tell me that I was one of 170 trying out for only 30 positions.\n\n\"I was the second-fastest in time trials, but still, the best they could do was a partial scholarship. I talked to my parents, and they said to go with it. I didn't make road trips, but at least they gave me a uniform so I could look good looking up into the stands and waving at the girls during home games.\"\n\nThat changed. Blair went on to become a combination of speed, agility and toughness. Not only could he force outside rushers to the better-defended inside, he also was a top pass defender.\n\n\"He was one of the most impressive, beautifully structured and sculptured human beings I've ever coached in my life,\" Majors said. \"He intimidated people just walking out on the field for the pregame toss.\"\n\nHe might have been calling flips for someone else had it not been for the way Iowa State structured its semesters. Blair was as imposing on the basketball court as he was on the football field, and the school's quarter system allowed him to finish his basketball career at Northeastern before transferring in time for the spring semester.\n\n\"Believe it or not, we had an advantage because he wanted to finish his basketball,\" said Joe Madden, the Iowa State assistant who recruited Blair. \"Matt was playing basketball at the time for his junior college and he wanted to finish the season. We fortunately were on the quarter system. That meant he could enroll in April.\"\n\nBlair said he did it out of necessity.\n\n\"Because I was only on a partial football scholarship in junior college, my parents had to pay the other half of the tuition, and they weren't exactly rich people,\" he said. \"I was pretty good in basketball and told the coach I wanted to come out. I couldn't shoot, but I was a pretty good rebounder in high school, so he gave me a spot on the team as a rebounder and an enforcer.\n\n\"He ended up liking me so much that he wanted me to devote full-time to basketball. The football coach got word of it, and he said no way. I told them that all I wanted was my tuition paid and we worked out a deal where I got a partial scholarship in both sports. That's why I had to remain in school until the basketball season was over.\"\n\nBut Iowa State, not Oklahoma, probably was going to be his choice, anyway.\n\n\"I remember coach Majors and some of his assistants came down to recruit me and for some reason wanted to play me and a bunch of guys in basketball,\" Blair said. \"It was their way to get to know me. I thought it was pretty cool. It was something I'd never heard of.\"\n\nSimilar to his ability to block kicks.\n\n\"No one in our league had seen anything like it, at least the way he did it,\" Grant said.\n\nMany believed Blair got his extra boost not only by running toward the line of scrimmage, but also by leaping on the backs of his linemen.\n\n\"Not true,\" Blair said. \"I didn't jump up on anyone's back. I ran to the line of scrimmage, then jumped straight up. I got up pretty high, and there's a scientific law out there that says you have to come down someplace, and when I came down, I usually ended up coming down on a pile of players. But as for using them to jump higher?\n\n\"I got pretty high by myself.\""
