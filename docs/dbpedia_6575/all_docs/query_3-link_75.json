        "text": "For two weeks, Curious Louisiana looked back at Louisiana's 1936 Olympians, along with another who followed in 1948.\n\nBut as the Olympics are winding down, we're not quite finished with this glance back at state history while almost nine decades later, Louisianans are once again vying for gold medals, this time in Paris.\n\nMissing from our earlier rosters of track and field team members Billy Brown, Glenn \"Slats\" Hardin, Dudley Wilkins and Rolland Romero was their teammate Jack Torrance.\n\nThis was pointed out by his son Jerry Torrance, of Baton Rouge, New Orleans sportscaster Romalice Brown and Mark Moreau, of Baton Rouge.\n\nThough New Orleans' Emmett Toppino was not a member of the 1936 Olympic team, Lee Sucherman and Fernand Laudumiey lll, both of New Orleans, lobbied for his inclusion in the roundup, as well.\n\nToppino won a gold medal four years earlier in the 1932 Olympic Games in London, which, along with last week's mention of New Orleans' Audrey Patterson's bronze in the 1948 Games, provides the perfect bookends for this look back at 1936.\n\nSo, while we're in 1932, let's begin with Toppino, who took the top spot as a member of the 4X100-meter relay team.\n\nHe was born Martin Emmett Toppino on July 1, 1909, in New Orleans, and was already attracting national attention as a sprinter at Jesuit High School.\n\nToppino enrolled at Loyola University in New Orleans, where he was coached by Tad Gormley, the same legendary coach of multiple sports at Tulane University, LSU and Loyola for whom the stadium in New Orleans' City Park is named.\n\nToppino matched world records in Amateur Athletic Union meets in the 100-meter dash leading up to the Olympic trials, but after a disappointing fourth place finish in the 1932 National AAU Championships, he did qualify for the Olympic team in the 4X100-meter relay.\n\nToppino ran the second heat of the race with teammates Frank Wykoff, of the University of Southern California; Robert Kiesel, of the University of California; and Hector Dyer, of Stanford University.\n\nThe foursome set a world record in their gold medal-winning performance.\n\nToppino had earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry before leaving for the London Games, then returned to the university to earn his master's degree, also in chemistry.\n\nHe worked as a chemist for an oil company before embarking on a 35-year career with the Freeman Shoe Corp.\n\nToppino died at age 62 on Sept. 8, 1971, in New Orleans.\n\nBack to 1936, where Adolf Hitler presided over the Olympic Games in Berlin. Jack Torrance, along with Hardin, had been a member of coach Bernie Moore's 1933 NCAA national champion track team at LSU.\n\nThat championship also marked the first national track title in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nMoore has a stadium named after him, too — LSU's track stadium next to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center.\n\nWhile Jack Torrance also was the leading scorer for the LSU basketball and the school's first All-SEC player on the football team, he competed in discus and shot put on Moore's track team. It was the shot put that would win him a place on the 1936 Olympic track and field team, where four-time gold medalist Jesse Owens would be one of his teammates.\n\nThe Oak Grove native, whose nickname was Baby Jack, set the world shot put record on March 24, 1934, in Lafayette at 16.30 meters, then improved it to 16.80 meters at the Drake Relays in Des Moines, Iowa, in April of that year.\n\nThen came May, where he bettered his own world's record with a 17.19-meter throw in an unofficial exhibition. He set his final world record at 17.40 meters while on a European tour stop in Oslo, Norway, on Aug. 4 of the same year.\n\nTorrance won the Olympic trials but placed fifth in the Games.\n\nStill, that didn't end his athletic career. At 6 feet, 5 inches and 285 pounds, Jack Torrance was a giant. He turned to boxing after London, then worked as a policeman and car salesman before signing a moving on to professional football in 1939, playing tackle in 15 games for the Chicago Bears.\n\nOne of those games was the 1940 championship, where the Bears beat Washington 73-0.\n\nJack Torrance died at age 57 on Nov. 10, 1969, in Baton Rouge.\n\nFinally, as an endnote to this impromptu Olympics series, Keith Katz, of New Orleans, offers an interesting Berlin anecdote told to him by his father-in-law, Gerald Joseph, of White Castle, who was an LSU Medical School student studying at the University of Heidelberg:"
