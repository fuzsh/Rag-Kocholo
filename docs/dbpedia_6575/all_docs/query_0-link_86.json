        "text": "PLYMOUTH, Minn. — As a professional football player, Matt Blair pushed himself to be No. 1.\n\nBeing No. 20, however, will be one of his proudest moments.\n\nBlair, a six-time All-Pro linebacker for the Minnesota Vikings from 1974-1985, will become the 20th member of the Vikings’ ring of honor Thursday.\n\nBlair’s name will forever reign above Mall of America field in the Metrodome and will be carried over to the new stadium that is to be finished for the 2016 season. Blair joins other Viking greats such as Fran Tarkenton, Alan Page, Cris Carter, John Randle and others in the exclusive club.\n\n“It just emotionally pushed me over the edge,” Blair said, referring to the moment when he found out that he was the 20th Viking to make the ring.\n\n“The funny thing about this was they invited me down to training camp this summer and said they wanted to do an interview with me. They took me in this room and sat me down on one side of the room. Then the Wilfs and some of the other management people came in and sat on the other side of the room, and that’s when they told me,” continued Blair.\n\n“I just thought, ‘You’ve gotta be joking.”\n\nA graduate of Iowa State, Blair made an immediate impact under head coach Bud Grant. In his 12 seasons with the Vikings, Blair played in 160 games, starting 130, and became the second-leading tackler of all time with 1,452, including 220 tackles during the 1980 campaign. He made the Pro Bowl six times and leads the NFL in blocked kicks with 20, a feat he owes to his junior college days when he played basketball.\n\n“Playing basketball at a small college in Oklahoma, I developed the ability to jump, and jump pretty high,” Blair said. “That really helped me, along with my timing, to block kicks.”\n\nBesides his athletic ability, that knack for blocking kicks caught Grant’s attention.\n\n“When we saw him on film and scouted him, I told our coaches that we needed that young man in Minnesota,” Grant said. “He was recruited by other teams, but he actually got hurt his first senior year and that may have scared a few teams away from him.\n\n“We wanted to take the chance because we liked what we saw, so when he was there in the second round, we had to take him.”\n\nThe choice proved to be the right one as the Cyclone graduate became a starter behind the famed Purple People Eaters defense.\n\n“Coach Grant believed in me, and I was not going to let him down,” Blair said. “He was more like a dad to me than he was a coach. That is why I asked him to introduce me during the ring of honor, because he is like my mentor. My parents would have, but they are no longer here so that is why I ask Coach.”\n\nBlair was never intimidated by the fact that he was quarterbacking great players such as Jim Marshall, Alan Page, Gary Larsen, Carl Eller and Paul Krause (an Iowa Hawkeye alum and soon-to-be Pro Football Hall of Famer).\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“The Vikings took (linebacker) Fred McNeill in the first round, and of course I got picked in the second,” Blair explained. “There were already five backers on the roster, so I knew I had to work my butt off to make this team.\n\n“I think a telling moment was when I forced Fran Tarkenton into a bad pass, because I covered a lot of ground and took away his short passes that he was so good at. I believe I immediately gained his respect.”\n\nThe respect of the rest of the Vikings’ roster came soon enough as Blair earned his starting role.\n\n“I tell you what, Matt was a great football player,” Vikings Hall of Fame defensive end Carl Eller said. “He came in and showed that he had the interest to learn, and it didn’t take long for him to build that relationship you need out on the field.”\n\nBorn in Hilo, Hawaii, in 1950, Blair’s father was in the Air Force, which meant that the family never settled long in one place. After numerous moves to nine different states and even a stop in Spain, the Blairs finally setttled in Ohio, where Matt finished his high school days at Columbus East.\n\nBlair then attended a small college in Oklahoma where he starred on the basketball team that placed seventh in the national tournament. When he got home, his family hardly recognized him as he grew three inches and packed on 40 pounds.\n\n“I had grown so much that my sister had to sew flairs on the bottom of my jeans so they would look right,” laughed Blair. “I still had those jeans when I played for the Vikings.”\n\nAfter graduation, Blair was recruited by many colleges and narrowed his choice to Florida State or Iowa State.\n\n“I settled on Iowa State because, then-coach Johnny Majors said I would have to work for my spot on the team and I love a challenge,” Blair explained. “Florida State said I would be a starter right away, but I had heard that before. I liked the idea of having to go in and earn my way, and I did that at Iowa State.”\n\nBlair played in the first bowl the Cyclones ever made and won defensive MVP honors. The Cyclones eventually lost to LSU in the Sun Bowl during Earl Bruce’s first season with the Cyclones.\n\n“I remember Howard Cosell interviewed me after that game and he said I had potential to play in the NFL,” Blair said.\n\nBlair re-injured his knee his senior season in a game against Colorado and sat out the rest of the year.\n\nAfter his second senior season was over, Blair was recruited heavily by many NFL teams, and when the 1974 draft came around, Blair received a call from the Vikings.\n\n“I got the call, and back then there was not a lot of hype over the draft,” explained Blair. “Anyway, the Vikings called me and said, ‘We are taking you in the second round,’ and I said, ‘Cool, this is good,’ and me and my dog Slick walked down to Burger King and I bought him two burgers and I had one, and that is how we celebrated.”\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.\n\n“Matt Blair was not only a good football player,” Grant said. “But he is one of the most pleasant and well-respected men you will ever meet, and it was an honor for me when he asked me to introduce him during the ceremonies.”\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
