        "text": "Major funding for this program was provided by Friends of Iowa Public Television.\n\nWatch that referee's.\n\nHand.\n\nWatch it and say, oh, look at that crowd.\n\nHoly mackerel.\n\nHistorically, the biggest upsets in college wrestling happen when Iowa meets Iowa State.\n\nBetween these two teams, they have won 21 national championships and the talent of the squads always seems to shine when they face each other on the mat.\n\nThis year's cyclone team of coach Bobby Douglas has beaten top ten ranked Oregon State and Nebraska and is hoping to get into prime shape for a run at the national championship.\n\nAs for the number three ranked Iowa Hawkeyes, coach Dan Gable is rolling the dice a second straight year, pulling Joe Williams out of redshirt to compete at £158 and could eventually move last year's NCAA champion Lincoln McElroy be down to 142.\n\nIn an effort to capture another Big Ten and NCAA Championship, it's a new chapter in the ongoing battle for state bragging rights as Iowa State takes on Iowa next on college wrestling from Carver Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa.\n\nIowa Public Television Sports brings you college wrestling.\n\nThe seventh ranked Iowa State cyclones versus the third ranked Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nHello, I'm Doug Brown with Tim Johnson.\n\nAnd here we are on our last meet of the 1994 college wrestling season.\n\nIt's our 18th season of broadcasting them and we hope that you'll have a chance later on to find an address that we're going to give you to write your comments, if you have any.\n\nAnd we hope you do.\n\nBut what I meet Iowa and Iowa State is every year some years just unbelievable.\n\nAfter all, these two teams for 25 seasons have really dominated the sport.\n\nOut of the last 25 years.\n\n20 NCAA titles have been won by either the Cyclones or the Hawkeyes.\n\nAnd for wrestling fans, they know that the Hawkeyes have pretty much dominated in the last decade and a half, winning 12 senior titles themselves.\n\nAnd in this great dual meet series, the Hawkeyes have won 14 straight.\n\nBut, you know, I must say, don't you think Iowa State has shown unbelievable improvement this year?\n\nWell, I think they really have.\n\nAnd I think it's a matter of getting used to the system of second year coach Bobby Douglas.\n\nI think they're coming on.\n\nLet's talk about those coaches, Bobby Douglas and Dan Gable, two rivals for more than 25 years.\n\nWell, that's right.\n\n1968, Bobby Douglas was the captain on the Olympic team and he beat Dan Gable out to make that team.\n\nAnd he went on to a great career as a as a coach at Arizona State.\n\nHe's a Hall of Famer.\n\nAnd in 1993, USA Wrestling's Man of the Year, because he was a 1992 Olympic coach.\n\nAnd then, of course, Dan Gable made the team.\n\nIn 1972.\n\nWe know what he did.\n\nHe won the gold medal.\n\nHe went on and he has been the head coach of the Hawkeyes for 18 years.\n\nHe's a Hall of Famer and he's just got an honor.\n\nHe's been named the world coach world team coach to compete in Istanbul, Turkey, this summer.\n\nWell, let's bring it right down to now.\n\nLet's bring it to this meet, because we thought, first of all, we were going to see Aiken against McGuinness at 126.\n\nBut Eric Aiken picked us, me, to go down.\n\nTo his natural weight.\n\n118.\n\nWell, it's time.\n\nHe's been at 118 for three years and he's a three time all-American there.\n\nThe Kansas native is really primed to become a national champion at 118.\n\nHe loves to control his opponents right here against Showalter.\n\nFrom you and I.\n\nHe controls him.\n\nThen he wins.\n\nTended to Aiken's tough.\n\nI think he has a great shot at winning the national title at 118, at 126 for the Hawkeyes.\n\nJeff McGuinness He is really tough.\n\nA four time state champion, undefeated in high school career.\n\nNow he stepped right in as a true freshman.\n\nHe is such a natural.\n\nHe knows how to control his opponents and he has great control of his own body on them on the mat.\n\nHe's won some big ones already and he figures big in the future for the Hawkeyes.\n\nWell, let's talk about glamor matches.\n\nHow about £190 between this man, Dan Troup and Joel Sharrett?\n\nWell, they in truth, out of Montana, look at that under arm spin.\n\nHe's turned in not only a winner now, but he's a pinner.\n\nAnd that really improves his chances to win the national title.\n\nAnd that's what he wants.\n\nAn all-American last year.\n\nBut what's ahead of him?\n\nTonight's match with Joel Sharrett, Joel Sharratt, NCAA runner up for the Hawkeyes.\n\nHe's really improved himself.\n\nHe has created great opportunities for himself to score in here against Davison, one of the best 90 pounders in the nation.\n\nHe gets in on a single leg.\n\nHe cuts off to a double.\n\nHe comes back up to his feet, he changes his level and he gets him down.\n\nThat's what he's been doing to all his up opponents all year.\n\nHe's tough.\n\nWell, I'll tell you, the question seems to be how far has Iowa State come?\n\nHave they come far enough to beat Iowa?\n\nWhat do they have to do to be almost perfect?\n\nI think the Cyclones had their work cut out for them.\n\nThey got to be.\n\nAlmost perfect, but they've got their chances here.\n\nThe Hawkeyes have a greater margin for error.\n\nIt's going to be an interesting meeting.\n\nWe've seen it happen before though.\n\nAs you know, over 25 years or so.\n\nIt's Iowa and Iowa State next.\n\nWe love it here on Iowa Public Television.\n\nWe're back at Carver Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa, for the match between the seventh ranked Iowa State cyclones and the third ranked Iowa Hawkeyes in a series that Iowa leads now 3642.\n\nYou see that in talking to Rolling Stone set in the open have gone to the Hawkeyes.\n\nLet's take a look at the matchups tonight, because there are some number four in the country.\n\nMultiple people set up with various weights, but one of their bacon is down at 118.\n\nNot going to make McGinnis.\n\nThat's going to be a great master and mentor.\n\nThat's very important.\n\nTo him for Iowa State.\n\n142 Mack already and Weber both at 154 Iowa.\n\nIf you go on to the upper wage three man way that at 158 it probably will be well-done to man at 167 for Iowa I would expect bronzer and to heavyweights for Iowa State one of them is brand name section there he's brand new in the lineup and as a possibility you'll see him but we'll have to wait and see because it is a question of what happens along the way.\n\nThere's Eric Aiken with his coach, Bobby Douglas Aiken having a great year, having a great year at 106.\n\nYeah, it's going to be really interesting.\n\nI think that Iowa, of course, wants to get off to a fast start.\n\nGable's got a chance to go against stuff.\n\nThere's Mike Bennett right there going against.\n\nAiken, so this would be real good.\n\nAiken Money for any way to something like one 7 to 1 more.\n\nWhat is the lowest rating for 1988.\n\nWhen he was a junior in high school?\n\nHe really is obviously the case goes to the mindset that, yes, there is a famous wrestling name who's refereeing.\n\nHe came all the way from Harrisburg.\n\nOh, Hall of Famer Wade Challis.\n\nMore pins, I think, than anybody in the history of wrestling.\n\nOh, he could pin him from any which way, too.\n\nHe was always dangerous and very colorful.\n\nAnd there's another colorful than that gable system also sending out his 118 pounder.\n\nThis ought to be a great one because Aiken is ranked number two, but manner of Iowa is ranked number eight.\n\nSo many times in this series, we've seen the £118 class goal in an upset.\n\nOne way or another.\n\nIt sets the tone.\n\nWe have a lot of people here on a beautiful day, quite a bit of sunshine, and the crowd is actually late getting here because it's just kind of nice to go.\n\nLast night was a high crotch move by a nifty high crotch, but Kenny turned it into a takedown.\n\nYeah, like.\n\nWhat I saw right There was a very focused wrestler that knew what he wanted to do right up top, and that was to take the action to Minner.\n\nAnd sometimes he's more of a defensive wrestler on his feet, something he'd like to improve on right here.\n\nThis is the finish to that, where it gets him down all the way to his on all fours there.\n\nBut Aiken did a nice job.\n\nOkay.\n\nGood position making the ready to nothing in the first period, 3 minutes long.\n\nThey all just start on their feet in the first period, second, third and third.\n\n2 minutes.\n\nWhile in the third period, 2 minutes long, as we know.\n\nWade Challis, the official as usual, the four hour referee, is has a microphone.\n\nSo you'll be able to hear him talking to the referee, to the wrestlers, and also to the coaches who might want to come out and discuss things with him as they attempt to.\n\nAiken riding with a tight waist and a near arm bar.\n\nYou know, one thing I've noticed about Aiken this year is that in the past he's had a tendency sometimes to let up and has some lapses.\n\nI have seen him be more focused this year than than ever in his career.\n\nAnd he just seems like he doesn't have any let ups.\n\nAnd we've talked about this before.\n\nThat's what makes the difference between the national champion and the runners up are those.\n\nTwo to.\n\nOne.\n\nYou know, there is no better.\n\nTime than here we are in the first period with about a half time goal in a minute and a half.\n\nAiken leads that one after a nice high crotch takedown early in the period.\n\nWe saw there.\n\nMenno was able to stop the shot by Aiken.\n\nThis time he's good.\n\nOn his defensive Wrestling.\n\nCoach Gable likely to come on line extra shots himself.\n\nIs Bobby Douglas more Ground zero raucous Iowa State team from Iowa City.\n\nThis was the first time since he's been coaching Iowa Iowa State that his team has come out after his team's stop the home and home series a couple of years ago.\n\nLast year, the meet was at Iowa State, four time high school champion from Illinois and a very.\n\nFine Aiken tried to get in on the legs and in front, going for the high cross again.\n\nThis time I got it will be interesting to see how Challis calls this as the referee here.\n\nThat there's been about six shots of Aiken to none for a minute.\n\nThere's a shot by man on the edge of the mat, but a high run headlock counter by Aiken.\n\nKills that off at about 30 seconds to, you know, from a standpoint of strategy right there.\n\nFrom would.\n\nI'm a wrestler good if it was called for solid here because what he's a good wrestler and he just get on the offer he's got a shot he could get shots 2 minutes.\n\nWell.\n\nWe have 20 seconds to go.\n\nIn the first period, Eric Harkin of Iowa State in the rear leads Mike Man of Iowa, 2 to 1.\n\nWe're just starting.\n\nThere's a nice guy.\n\nThere's experience.\n\nAnd his quickness.\n\nWas able to stay faced off on.\n\nThat was the first real shot that I.\n\nHad the end of the first period before the first.\n\nThe coaches are up on their feet.\n\nThey're able to match the downswing that you'll be on top of this time.\n\nWhat I don't want a success.\n\nWhere's Ryan gonna get a break That's Bobby Douglas of Iowa State.\n\nYou're right here We're talking about Eric and what he's done to get myself ready to go.\n\nGo the extra mile, 4 seconds.\n\nRemember when Drew said, Hey, you got me going?\n\nGood.\n\nThat's right.\n\nWe got to go on.\n\nHe says, we're going to.\n\nYou're going to beat people.\n\nNo, I'm really bad.\n\nNo more.\n\nFive to.\n\nFour.\n\nAiken started on top and I had to turn down and he had it by now.\n\nWell, that's a really important series right there for man, because he needed to explode out of them.\n\nHave any chance in this man down right here, living away.\n\nAnd what that does is get the crowd under height and it gets in a single leg, gets around for two point reversal on the up.\n\nAnd almost you can almost call pocket hands right there.\n\nIt was close, but.\n\nYou give reaction.\n\nTime.\n\nActually, no matter what it was, I would say he's a big 118 pounder and making can move in the second period, a two minute period that used up 30 seconds.\n\nAnd we're even at the only takedown was Aiken.\n\nAnd then he tried that he couldn't get it high up on the feet of it.\n\nSo now you just feel the momentum change in here a little bit crazy.\n\nIt's a match.\n\nAnd he's starting to move the head a little bit and get into the ties and he's right here.\n\nBut right now he's right crowd behind me.\n\nAnd he's got 18,000 in the playbook available right under him for that first high crotch takedown.\n\nBut he hasn't been able to get around the crowd.\n\nMen has been stopping that shot there even around the corner the other way seeing him aggressive.\n\nAnd that was what I think is the key.\n\nAnd that's where Aiken has improved.\n\nHe's improved technically in the last couple of years, but he thinks he can brute force.\n\nHe's really improved his technique.\n\nWell, he's very similar to the crowd here in Kentucky, a little outside singer right there comes up with it, knows he goes.\n\nTo he sticks in.\n\nFor the trick behind the back leg and then he covers the hips, but gets him down to the mat for one of 1835 seconds to go.\n\nIn the first quarter, Eric Aiken came down the hall of where he'll be in the Nationals.\n\nThe guy goes right, leads 5 to 4 over Mike Hanna an outstanding number eight All right wrestler for the Hawkeyes.\n\nThat was the big take that break in.\n\nBut I believe he's going to have to score a few more points.\n\nRight.\n\nFive, four.\n\nOkay.\n\nLet's the start now.\n\nAiken.\n\nWe'll go to Iowa State select who wants to down position third, Perry down five four.\n\nWe'll see what happens.\n\nHere we go on the left.\n\nHook it up right Here we go.\n\nIn this 48 seconds for Aiken.\n\nHe does not have a point.\n\nRemember, at the right, at the end of the match, if one wrestler has a minute.\n\nOkay, Good for eight on top.\n\nAll right.\n\nWe get some extra.\n\nThank you.\n\nHere we go.\n\nAnd Aiken is 12 seconds.\n\nFrom six four to go on his state.\n\nHe hasn't been able to take Aiken down, but he's counting on it.\n\nSix four here.\n\nDrop by and we'll see if he's ready in the third period.\n\nThat's right.\n\nBecause a takedown will determine the win.\n\nWell, here right now, it's not going to stay 6 to 438 back from the center.\n\nAgain, this is a huge opening match with the smallest of an open five.\n\nOne guess, warming Aiken, Iowa State stepping back and step back one time for man and he gets back in style.\n\nThings like that.\n\nConsidering the time of the match, I think Aiken will have to take over.\n\nOtherwise I'm sure it's going to got to say right now Iowa's got to be the best back three unnecessarily fair.\n\nThat's the way it's going to happen in this.\n\nMix it up and get out.\n\nHe's got Iowa open was not able to reach back he could make the shot.\n\nAiken needs his shot again and obviously so vital in it.\n\nAll he has to do is make it look right here.\n\nGoing to be a point guard, play six in favor of the man in red Eric in the 30 seconds to go.\n\nAll right.\n\nAll right.\n\nNathan has been one under.\n\nThat's got a headlock.\n\nThe players have found out very little time to head off and only 7 seconds to go at the.\n\nTop of the way.\n\nCan they manage to get after?\n\nThey really had a minute to do that and wasn't able to take advantage of the situation.\n\nNow, Aiken could even be warned that it was going to fall to win six, four four to get him on his feet.\n\nOkay, So everything in the letter 6 seconds away.\n\nThat's it for 3.0 to 4.\n\nIn favor of Aiken and Iowa State goes up three to nothing for the way out of the mainstream conference saw the move at least rivals takes it.\n\nHits and Ryan White with 100.\n\nAnd six to bolster the mattress I was weight 126.\n\nI was way to stand with Jerry.\n\nBrown earlier in the day for the Rams.\n\nI like that.\n\nI can against good with them now here's.\n\nMcInnis against Cameron of Iowa State getting shake hands hasn't really come out this year on the varsity team because of his position on tape but he has some experience and he's in there against seventh ranked Jeff McGuinness just one seventh ranked but he's beat the number three That's.\n\nThe only losses in the top.\n\nHigh school.\n\nAnd it just got Matt Ryan actually out hard.\n\nAnd he came right.\n\nUp and McInnis Yes dad right there.\n\nCalmly looking on it looks.\n\nLike come on man, come into the lane.\n\nThey're inside right now.\n\nHead to head up against very strong wants to muscle with credit he can run has the wisdom that.\n\nOver but it was quick to say please do it Like I said here we get to a feel he's as close to a natural as I've seen for a long.\n\nTime.\n\nThe field where he's at, he's a great presence on the back.\n\nRight There is a good example.\n\nWith Tim Johnson.\n\nI've got Brown at Carver Hawkeye Arena in Iowa City, the home of the defending national champion wrestling team, Iowa Hawkeyes Sean McGuiness McGuinness of Iowa Lead let command in of Iowa State two to nothing with about in the first period of come on these £6.\n\nIowa State won the opening match with Eric Aiken and leads in the meet three nothing.\n\nJeff McGuinness is a good writer and he's a pinner too.\n\nHe likes arm bars and legs.\n\nYou can see he's already had the legs in.\n\nHe's trying to come out here with the near risk post, the head.\n\nFight, run over.\n\nHe's strong, he's getting stronger all the time.\n\nSo he's really I mean, he was.\n\nUndefeated in high school.\n\nDoug was never lost.\n\nNow he's stepping.\n\nIn as true freshman.\n\nAnd that was last year.\n\nHe didn't get a redshirt.\n\nOh, ready for.\n\nIn fact, there are two first year freshmen on this team for the first time on college wrestling.\n\nA little bit later on, I like that.\n\nThere are a couple.\n\nOf Iowa products here.\n\nJeff McGuinness Of course, I was City High coach Brad Smith for three three, four time state champion from Iowa City High.\n\nThat's Jeff Nichols riding hard against Ken.\n\nRon, with a less than a minute to go in the first period, McGuinness sweeps two to nothing after a power takedown.\n\nIn the first minute.\n\nRun, of course, is he's a junior.\n\nHe's from Cresco in Crestwood High School.\n\nAnd so two homegrown Iowans wrestling here for the University of Iowa State.\n\nRight.\n\nGreat play for McGuinness is riding him hard.\n\nBut Wade, Silas thinks that man can do better than he is.\n\nThis place has been rockin this weekend.\n\nThere was a women's basketball game on Friday and and a big basketball game last night when the men's basketball and prior to this, another women's basketball game.\n\nAnd so there must be around 25 40,000.\n\nCrowd barber hockey in the last 48 hours okay Iowa state shot by Dennis.\n\nOkay Iowa down Iowa wants to down second third down.\n\nHow many of those people that way you have a porn star on first okay he has no looks good position hawks there.\n\nHe knows his son is a terrific wrestler and his confidence Get a break now.\n\nGet a break now.\n\nBring it back to nervous Now.\n\nHere's Jeff Bridges coming off the bottom.\n\nThe Choi, he escapes and leads from three.\n\nNothing came right here to second place.\n\nFirst we see right here.\n\nJeff McGuinness has the presence to know that he's dominating.\n\nOn the feet and he has a better chance to come.\n\nThat's right.\n\nLikes this up here at the Cradle he's under is in there hustling.\n\nI guess you know, that nothing else will get us can hang on to that neck right there.\n\nHe has some hesitation.\n\nOh, one and three, three.\n\nTo give a point.\n\nWe're going to have to one.\n\nI think it's because it was an intimate.\n\n3.0.\n\nHere it is.\n\nThe neck bridge is still in.\n\nSo as one brings it back, look it up.\n\nLook at that.\n\nBack foot there.\n\nMcGuinness is able to propel off it right back, thread his arm through the three runs on an easy run.\n\nCall a timeout right there.\n\nHe's injured as he came down That was a great recovery by Jeff McGuinness.\n\nThat took real power in a situation.\n\nGood scramble by both of them.\n\n30 down, one to go 10 to 1 now a score here.\n\nLet's see it again.\n\nThere's a nick wrench I'm talking about right there.\n\nAnd if Braun can take the time to get it off, it be in business.\n\nBut he didn't see because McGuinness kept his hips down, watch his foot right back when he's able to push off.\n\nOkay.\n\nRight, right.\n\nWell, Celtic three time number.\n\nOne in three.\n\nBut he really number one just knocked the air out.\n\nOf freestyle start up.\n\nThank you, Iowa.\n\nOkay.\n\nFreeze time out We come back to the mat with one cyclones watch to go and after the escape there McGuinness leading run of Iowa State 10 to 2 and then again goes McGuinness reaching for a technical fall off.\n\nHe gets a 15 point difference.\n\nSo stop the mat right there.\n\nStop the match.\n\nLook thing I was talking about is not only does Jeff McGuinness feel good on his feet, but I think he feels that he has a better chance of pinning his opponent from the feet.\n\nSo he's not just going after a technical fall right here.\n\nHe's really going after the ball, but he's going to try to get the ball off this one move.\n\nFor a takedown.\n\nTakedown the next 12 to he's ahead by ten, round and round now run his is strong in there but McGuinness says just.\n\nThings you don't teach him balance a 14 to 3 lead.\n\n14 to 3 and he has more than 2 minutes of riding time.\n\nSo that's 11 points.\n\nWe're still in the second period.\n\nThis has been a big period for him, 12 to 3 in the second period.\n\nKnows how to use his legs here.\n\nAnd he prays and he looks at those arm bars and he's always looking to.\n\nTry to turn his back.\n\nYou're watching Iowa and Iowa State from Carver Hawkeye Arena in.\n\nIowa City, Iowa State, one open match you can win points up now for Iowa State and then a 6 to 4 here.\n\nMCGINNIS This is why we have 2 seconds left to win a second, 14 to 3 with just two ticks.\n\nOkay, Good.\n\nSecond period when you're ready.\n\nIowa, Wait.\n\nChallis Is the kid okay from the first down to get.\n\nUs out of bounds, covers the hips and comes on top for the two.\n\nOkay.\n\nHot hands on his own.\n\nHips are on the clock.\n\nIowa State frees.\n\nIt is.\n\nAlways gotten.\n\nOne.\n\nI got to start starting with Jeffrey.\n\nYes I'm 26 one second now let's take the four after giving away the escape.\n\nYou want to go on his feet away, he'll pick real low single comes around him.\n\nMake that 6 to 4.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nAnd give the 16 to 5.\n\nHe's given two for one because he wants to.\n\nHe wants to make this football if he can.\n\nMaybe he'd like a pick up to throw the tuck, but he hasn't been able to do it yet.\n\nBut again, as does he does control the tie.\n\nWell, right there, you know, you hear Douglas saying to run control, to tie, but what if he takes off in the position up here?\n\nHe could have good head snaps.\n\nAw, shucks.\n\nOr look at that inside trip and nothing's going to come out and he's going to elevate himself.\n\nNow, Ron's done it.\n\nNice job of wizardry.\n\nAnd again, it's pretty clean takedowns right there over here.\n\nMy impression is that a situation like that that begins, yeah, maybe took a chance that he wouldn't take against that number three or four.\n\nRight, Right.\n\nWhat's the hard part here?\n\nRon is holding on for dear life pleasure.\n\nAnd so Charlotte says, going in the back 48 seconds to go.\n\nDan Gable is telling his man that he needs to break down.\n\nSo you look at that.\n\nHe got that.\n\nYou know, that single person was able to extend the hips there.\n\nVery nice runs, got good hip action going right now.\n\nBut he's got to continue on and break the grip of McGinnis.\n\nAnd he does that.\n\nGet behind on gets the take the greatest takedown against Jeff McGinnis and.\n\nThat makes it 62 seconds that moves a technical fall away.\n\nA little bright 16 seconds to go still major.\n\nGreat decision area, though.\n\nIf you had more than eight points difference on your man.\n\nThis is what Ron needed to do.\n\nAll those points make a difference.\n\nThey get 17 to 7 after the escape in.\n\nThe first but one with a little takedown kept on going and got it in the seven with right in front.\n\nSo the Hawkeyes now go up 4 to 3 in.\n\nThe major decision.\n\nGoes for four points.\n\nAfter two.\n\nMatthew, Iowa four.\n\nIowa State three £134.\n\nThat's scoreboard.\n\nScoreboard.\n\nThat's all right.\n\nRest up there.\n\nThis is a tough Third Mile Sheriff, a little revenue sharing racket.\n\nSix.\n\nI know what's going on.\n\nHe's tough on good people.\n\nThis is a young man from Iowa, Kevin Hogan, whose record is not good.\n\n6 to 13 at least.\n\nHe has the ability and he's going to surprise somebody.\n\nAnd maybe it's moms here.\n\nSo this is one of those matches, you might say those first two matches went the way you would expect them to go.\n\nNo upsets yet.\n\nIowa and Iowa State.\n\nThe favorite here would be Munster.\n\nLike you said, he's very tough.\n\nHe's made a lot of progress this year.\n\nHe came in as a redshirt freshman last year out of Iowa, and they've done a nice job for the Cyclones and this year just kept it rolling.\n\nHe's a he's very strong and disciplined rest a hard worker.\n\nAnd tough minded.\n\nHe has a pat on his knee.\n\nHe bumped the knee you're not too long ago and that's the first injuries had a while.\n\nIt slowed him up a little bit, but the word is that he's back in good condition again, mostly.\n\nSpeaking of slowing up, Hogan, over the last couple of years have been slowed up by a hand injury.\n\nIt took him a long time to come back from that.\n\nHe's a strong young man, but he just has a tendency sometimes to hang out too much and let things get closer.\n\nThey need to get.\n\nOut £134, Iowa and Iowa state of each one a match here.\n\nAnd Hobbs was a major decision.\n\nNasty outside singles for fair.\n\nIt was it was not good at the.\n\nFirst takedown mom fair goes up to him.\n\nI think a monster was able to get past the first line of defense.\n\nSo the hands get in on that single.\n\nLeg and heard a lot of great.\n\nJoke contact.\n\nChris, get your face in the right place.\n\nYou're jealous of your move.\n\nAll right.\n\nInjury time here.\n\nApparently, there must be a second half contact lens problem for months here.\n\nHere's why.\n\nWell, at first we said the first two matches went the way they might have been expected to go.\n\nAiken had a tough time with men, as we might have missed, but he did.\n\nAll right.\n\nCut the time record in the proper time.\n\nNumber Iowa at 126.\n\nSo there you are at £134.\n\nIowa.\n\nNow for Iowa State three.\n\nIt's Derek Mount there, leading Kevin Hogan at 134 2 to 1.\n\nIowa State's Derek Montero in the red.\n\nFirst here, it's half done, about a minute and a half to go.\n\nIt tussle each.\n\nOther.\n\nBravo control ahead.\n\nSet up All right they will fall to it set up the kind of move they like to get up on their work a little hard with the head throw right in on Baldwin, who doesn't have a takedown yet.\n\nYou seems to know.\n\nI tell you what, right here very a monster can catch Hogan in bad position here.\n\nHe's dangerous.\n\nWe've seen him propped up his opponents on the back and he can beat them.\n\nAnd that's what we talked about earlier.\n\nFor the cyclones to be in this match, they have to be almost perfect and perfect.\n\nMe.\n\nThey need extra points.\n\nYes.\n\nEach team needs everybody.\n\nEverybody likes the extra points.\n\nThe teams are getting hurt.\n\nGot a one right.\n\nHogan is now out for two.\n\nTwo is a score on the second.\n\nSo right in time for a monster who has made the first two takedown my time.\n\nYou're going to make a monster.\n\nPut his head back on.\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\nJust put it on there.\n\nPick up Wade showers.\n\nHe was not only a pinner.\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\nChampion wrestler, but he was collared for two.\n\nHe did it.\n\nHe did it through through Matt, through Hogan in this part of the match.\n\nYou're right.\n\nHe was kind of moving Michael Jordan wrestling this time because he did things that we've never seen before and he knows wrestling.\n\nHe's the only Pennsylvania wrestler in the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe's he's got the national record for beating and pinning the most national champions and world champions.\n\nIn fact, he's in the Guinness Book of Wrestler Records records for like wins.\n\nRight.\n\nSo injury time.\n\nThree, three, three.\n\nTime grand slam.\n\nYou may go to the corner.\n\nWrestling background.\n\nHogan at the end of the second period is taking time injury time guys Oh I'm sure there is getting actual coaching If you're in the Middle East country time out you can't be coached.\n\nOkay injury time, kind of please record it for Iowa.\n\nInjury time for Iowa.\n\nNumber one.\n\nNumber one there, gentlemen.\n\nOkay, so who was that now?\n\nWas yours, right?\n\nI'd even over there.\n\nIowa 12 one.\n\nI'm neutral in the first, sir.\n\nIowa selection wants the down position.\n\nSecond period down.\n\nOkay, Stay intact.\n\nOkay.\n\nSlide, grandstand.\n\nMove it forward.\n\nGo.\n\nHold the line.\n\nOkay.\n\nFreeze.\n\nTop man.\n\nHere we go.\n\nHey, get a break now.\n\nDerek.\n\nHere goes on.\n\nTop ends Iowa State's 131 to 2.\n\nNow 4 to 3.\n\nAfter letting holding up of Iowa.\n\nNothing, just one ounce here has made the takedown So far.\n\nHogan has not been able to dance last year and before that upset, he's going to have a big chance against this sixth ranked Iowa State wrestler.\n\nHe's going to have to prove to myself, well, Monster has a.\n\nFive match streak going right now.\n\nAnd he wants to be in top prime shape going into the big eight.\n\nAnd I think he's looking pretty good.\n\nWorking on the head.\n\nEach man.\n\n3 seconds go on.\n\nSecond period, We're at Carver Hawkeye, Iowa, Iowa State three.\n\nAnd in the teams, 134, Monster leads 4 to 3.\n\nNumber one, he ready set up a lot of upper body setups here do to stop him by both hands they haven't changed levels go holding the like you've thought about it there but still they really haven't done that well both already got close.\n\nThat's all that's happened all the way back to where they.\n\nWeren't looking out there.\n\nBut he can't get past the hands of Hogan.\n\nWhat I'm saying there is Hogan was able to stop him on his move just with his elbows.\n\nYou've got to get past first.\n\nThe hands down here, Florida, three, half a.\n\nMinute, as you see, to go.\n\nSouth to get.\n\nWhat just happened in this.\n\nI'll see.\n\nThis is what they want out of.\n\nHey, I want to knock the favorite by anybody in front of this crowd.\n\nBy the way.\n\nI go back to an upset by getting the referee.\n\nYou got to punch in showing him that he's pushing him all over the mat.\n\nHe's wanting to be in this match.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nTo move on.\n\nTime for 5 seconds to go.\n\nThere have been no takedowns in this period.\n\nMonster, let the Hogan up.\n\nAnd then they've done very state down.\n\nOkay, I want you to look at those.\n\nI'm going to have 45 finishers.\n\nThe number of times over were first, right?\n\nOkay.\n\nBoth your hands and knees.\n\nOne, two inches to go.\n\n13.\n\nOkay, okay, hold up.\n\nWe got optional.\n\nFor you here.\n\nWe were three times out, 37 years.\n\nThrow it back.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne arm fabrication.\n\nHogan was on top down, gets the escape, sums up by two again.\n\nHe does not have writing time.\n\nHis 40 seconds in his favor set the right.\n\nHere's this whistle again.\n\nI'm the head of Velcro short on that hair.\n\nIf you get a piece of white tape ready next time it comes off, I want to tape it.\n\nAll right.\n\nWe're just we're going to call timeout.\n\nWe're going to do a piece about this.\n\nWhat I like very well.\n\nAnd so they want to put a piece of white paper underneath their hair right now.\n\nI love that came out, though.\n\nI thought, okay, here we go.\n\nYou got to keep.\n\nUp the tempo, but I guess it can wear out.\n\nWe just started in the third period here on sure of was at 100.\n\nAnd 34 leads by two over Kevin holding in an our demo and although he's favored so much distance between himself and his heart, the rest of the class I'm sure is coming out his peak.\n\nThat's right.\n\nBut this one, Hogan won it so close that he could get in and make a difference in the end.\n\nGet up so far out of it.\n\nDoesn't have a chance right now.\n\nOne takedown right back in and the momentum, the crowd, anything can happen.\n\nAnd they both had worn so far.\n\nThere's a point in one way or the other I want to keep busy right now.\n\nAnd again, he's doing a good job right here as far as getting this out there already.\n\nWhen he heads back to the high 80 seconds to go, you know why he's dangerous three.\n\nBut I'll tell you what, we've watched Hogan throughout this year, and it seems like his real right at the end of the.\n\nMatch, it just doesn't work out for him.\n\nHe puts himself in bad position right there just because of bad position.\n\nRight?\n\nRight down here.\n\nTook advantage of a few fights.\n\nStretch out right here.\n\nGo to head is going to have no good.\n\nHold it.\n\nI was lucky to get away.\n\nAbout 10 minutes till three now in favor of Monster who now has riding five minute, 6 seconds.\n\nTake a quick break at three right now.\n\nHe's in that.\n\nTough else out there.\n\nHe likes to get into that and all the really close.\n\nMore hurt that evening.\n\nHogan's going to stay off his back right there.\n\nBut I'll tell you what, he was cranking on.\n\nTook advantage of that one mistake.\n\nIt was a big mistake.\n\nThat's the kind of situation you used to see.\n\nCorey Hogan, last year's.\n\nWinner right here, the right time injury.\n\nMakes it three.\n\nStraight hour, 442, 42 down.\n\nJericho, for example, 42.\n\nAnd here we have to tell him three and four, please table.\n\nAll right.\n\nOkay.\n\nHere we go.\n\nRead the black Against Ron Groves.\n\nOf Iowa State.\n\nIt goes into what's going on here right off the crowd, back with the 43 oh, this thing's real tight.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe're going to go we're going to.\n\nGo after freestyle here.\n\nWe go back into the rocket bucket.\n\nWelcome very much so.\n\nHere in the very first minute, first 30 seconds on the first day.\n\nAaron, I just couldn't even fathom the cyclone on the road with a.\n\nFive point move, take down the near fall.\n\nHere, trying to come up here that didn't want to get stuck.\n\nWell, actually, a 4.4, we didn't give them five, didn't have a long enough phase.\n\nThe of the 5 seconds here, down here.\n\nThis is a big mess right here.\n\nDone.\n\nThis is where I was.\n\nThey really needed to come in and win a match.\n\nBecause our Air Force is untested and he hasn't been in a 142 for Iowa.\n\nNeither improved, but it's one where Iowa State, he did.\n\nWhat I did right there on that kick that was ahead.\n\nAnd here's the first page of the first takedown.\n\nLook at that.\n\nRight off the coast of the arm came in with the opposite hand to the opposite leg with a little traffic covering the hips.\n\nAnd look at that.\n\nYou see all those chest to chest.\n\nIt keeps in there for two more points.\n\nThe last takedown he posted ahead went around two points.\n\nGood technique so far by Ari's take taking advantage of.\n\nAnd that was.\n\nThe first time.\n\nGroves got extended there And Ari.\n\nOkay, fine.\n\nGet set ramp up green to first cross 3:00.\n\nFreeze.\n\nHere we go.\n\nCharles We're at 142.\n\nBarbara Hawkeye, Iowa against Iowa State cyclones Fleet seven four wicket stand against Ron GROSS.\n\nAt this rate.\n\nWell, all right.\n\nYou know, he's getting his opportunity for both Iowa and Iowa product at Green River's high school.\n\nAnd he says, hey, I'm not going to get this opportunity often.\n\nThis is great.\n\nBig crowd.\n\nHe came out.\n\nHe's taking advantage of it right now because like we said, we haven't seen Ron Groves before.\n\nHe's a senior out of Chicago, Illinois, Blue Township High School.\n\nAnd so a couple of newcomers here.\n\nAnd I'm sure the jitters, whatever there was in Ari, for the jitters are gone because he got hit.\n\nHe had a big hit.\n\nRemember that takedown for a lot of guys at first?\n\nWell, all right.\n\nOkay.\n\nLet's get cyclone.\n\nHold the position.\n\nFreeze Iowa.\n\nHere we go.\n\nDown slowly.\n\nThey were going after each other.\n\nOptional freestyle, starting to go hot.\n\nFreestyle start, man.\n\nGo.\n\nWho wants to take one higher?\n\nWell, one.\n\nGo.\n\nCome on.\n\nThat's a good shot by Will.\n\nIf he can get it.\n\nIf he can save him, if he can keep his own guys down, hits it.\n\nBut, buddy, good defense by powering right down to get his hips out.\n\nThat was a nice shot by Groves.\n\nRyan Groves.\n\nSo you quite similar physically.\n\nI think.\n\nThose girls are almost all good but again always counter and you.\n\nKnow he has the single.\n\nAs well he's got to create like that.\n\nOh play right Everybody is he has to find the pinnacle and find a way to make it appealing because in.\n\nThe process is out.\n\nThere.\n\nYou can see his zone out there blocking off the leg one hour since you need to get his back in to getting a takedown.\n\nSo he didn't even get to take.\n\nRight.\n\nStalemate right from get into official way.\n\nAllison.\n\nOh, here we go, man.\n\nCan I go out?\n\nWe'll start him over.\n\nThose are the number first three matches.\n\nWhoa oh, oh, six two, four, nine.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd this is what you get to see.\n\nWhat somebody made out of right there.\n\nBecause all of a sudden, Groves says, Hey, I could take him on the mat, made a couple of shots, but he almost definitely got off the mat this time.\n\nIt worked as a nice shot.\n\nGo right back to back.\n\nWe had just a few seconds, see it in the first period here at 142, I was 43 three.\n\nMan, there's a warning.\n\nAgainst our activity.\n\nBut he gets one more, right?\n\nOkay.\n\nSecretary of State, drop by for the first, second period.\n\nOkay.\n\nTo take right here.\n\nThat guy and hips right here down below the button.\n\nAll he was able to is right here, Iowa.\n\nHere we go.\n\nGrove, Iowa.\n\nHere we go.\n\nComing closer now at six.\n\nBefore getting off to that for Iowa, big.\n\nMove.\n\nBy Ari from I will want to run for chief Iowa.\n\nGroves of Iowa State picks down for the same.\n\nPeriod trailing 6 to 4 against all three of Iowa around here.\n\nIt's turned back into a test match roll by looks like he's almost yeah, I always go back and forth in my 1005 six stop by The crowd's getting a little nervous.\n\nWell that was clearly the Hawkeyes is now in Iowa state a process just look at this.\n\nHe got the big girl up there because Ari was real close to whipping him, Overcooked it.\n\nI think he's close to getting him in here.\n\nIt's the five foot five.\n\nDangerous.\n\nMay well need to do it out of good position.\n\nThey don't have the same natural ability or feeling that a Jeff McGinnis does in scramble out.\n\nBoth are unorthodox and both don't just have a natural good.\n\nPosition put on.\n\nAnd that's not a position that enjoys.\n\nBeing in in the bottom corner.\n\nBoth teams that won the Iowa State shot.\n\nThat makes it 8 to 6 and double center when you were hit earlier, one point red.\n\nSo it's a raised red green.\n\nHere we go.\n\nAri, by the way, is.\n\nIt time for that.\n\nSecond period at.\n\nIowa City, three time, 142.8%?\n\nWell, you know, everything down there on the leg, I have to come up.\n\nIt's going to be an interesting last period.\n\nAnd a half.\n\nAnd I think both men love to have chances here and they both know that.\n\nI think they both normally they win.\n\nI think you said it well.\n\nThey believe they can win right now.\n\nHowever, I really like trying to pack on top, trying to keep it flat throws.\n\nLike I said, just have a good enough.\n\nPosition to come up and always.\n\nOh they just gave it 827.\n\nEight, seven eight to say writing time of almost 2 minutes for our right here comes world power by it up on the edge out of bounds and past a couple of seconds period You have to go Thriller some time for the unexpected The unlikely.\n\nYeah right.\n\nWell, I'm sure both coaches friends are willing to watch the position that these guys get into before there's the end of the period.\n\n8 to 7.\n\nOkay, hot button foul.\n\nI was like.\n\nOkay, Iowa, Hey, down, down.\n\nThird period.\n\nAll right, All right, everybody.\n\nThat was.\n\nI don't know if there's more on the line right here for the side because they have to have like I said earlier, I think Iowa has a.\n\nLot more of a margin.\n\nOf error here.\n\nAnd they could actually still be on it.\n\nWrong.\n\nRight.\n\nWell, okay, guys, I don't want to.\n\nHear you go.\n\nOkay, hold off on.\n\nThe score is up.\n\nThe seven guard Lowry, the man you just saw, the black lady, the man.\n\nIn red rivals wolves on top eight to show he probably has almost 2 minutes of writing time for you to say that he had to work on that back away from power.\n\nOh, oh, he does get his head up, is going to get hit again.\n\nIt was stolen no matter who stole it here.\n\nHe's the one that looks like he stole after Iowa.\n\nWhether or not Rose is trying to turn our word one oh, it's all because he's had a hit for 8800.\n\nThe right hand side, right side to side.\n\nHe's going to get two more stop the right drive from now.\n\n48, 45, 41 points rose eight and Rose knows where he is.\n\nAll the rest jump side to side.\n\nAnd the next time there's a rally, it's over.\n\nAnd that would be six.\n\nThat would be six.\n\nAll right, here we go.\n\nNine.\n\nIowa, 1.2.\n\nAnd that is over.\n\nGets that one all right.\n\n7000, right in a situation like this.\n\nBut right now it looks like rut.\n\nOh.\n\nHere we go to.\n\nBreak it down.\n\nSomebody kind of more aware of where he's at.\n\nRight?\n\n08013 33 seconds to go.\n\nThis is such a big crowd.\n\nThat big ten from 900 and beautiful.\n\nI don't like it.\n\nI don't know where it goes.\n\nZIRKLE Oh, it's a rise up here.\n\nHe did not go back to the for the back at all in the last Iowa State, here in Iowa, for after four oh.\n\nIt was another one of those big things that happens sometimes in Iowa.\n\nIowa State needs this for one of their national champions, maybe more of a losing record to now again, national champions.\n\nWe come to one.\n\nHundred and 50 on Lincoln Chapel raving undefeated, defending national champion at 142, up 150 this year goes against Chris Cuomo of Iowa State.\n\nAnd he knows that his team is now.\n\nDown by nine.\n\nThat's it for us Monday night.\n\nAnd we have seen Iowa State wrestling Well, but what they have.\n\nThis year, they got the most out of their people, the 30 seconds of the first period between Lincoln Mack Arabia in the black national champion last year out of the 42, only a sophomore, and Chris Monroe, who was a freshman, three time champion from Florida, wrestling you.\n\nI'll tell that young man from Iowa he.\n\nDoes have a good mental aspect of this sport.\n\nWe saw that he seen that kind of behind and knows where he's at, what it takes to win back away.\n\nAnd we just saw the mental aspect in play in that.\n\nLast match this weekend.\n\nA little bit of it.\n\nI think the ball right now.\n\nHe's got to hold Mack already off, but he's going to have to barely do something offensively or he's going to get the same problem he did last time around.\n\nNow, like Blair Mack, very, very talented wrestler both offensively and defensively.\n\nYou don't win national championships as a freshman out of high school.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI think a lot to watch Mack already scramble.\n\nThat's the but.\n\nThese are the opportunities.\n\nThe fundamentals to take advantage of you got to get the kickoff and you got it He can put the crowd hard to get it.\n\nLet's get the breakdown and when he gets those kind of positions.\n\nAnd so we got to let that happen to us.\n\nZachary to did a nice and scrambled out.\n\nFirst that nice job of getting out of the.\n\nWay have a minute to go In the first period at £150 Lincoln Marco Rubio, national champion a lower weight last year.\n\nMy baby is zero zero with Chris Bowen of Iowa straight after a major that happened at 142 Iowa State.\n\nThat's where it did.\n\nRondo won by disqualification.\n\nTake the show.\n\nIowa was stalled.\n\nOut.\n\nCome on down.\n\nThis was not the end that 30 to go.\n\nYou know you've been playing God that I agree with you about it.\n\nBut this has his.\n\nTeam president more aggressive than we've seen the last couple of years.\n\nAnd it seems like they just cut on.\n\nThe light bulb went on about three or four weeks ago.\n\nAnd we're seeing a different.\n\nType of restraint from the cycle now.\n\nSteve, a good.\n\nPosition here, but that's easier said than done to guess because he's an expert.\n\nAt destroying his.\n\nOpponent's position.\n\nAnd that's what happened.\n\nThe the final resting place on all has been takedowns.\n\nA lot of crowd, a lot of there.\n\nBut on the other game, you've got him in the position in the first place.\n\nWhat part of the.\n\nIowa State track down is of I was thinking about his parents.\n\nHere is his.\n\nStats from Florida and I just saw them standing.\n\nUp because they love what they just said.\n\nSo.\n\nOkay, let's get.\n\nReady when you're.\n\nReady.\n\nNow, the way it plays Florida.\n\nTo see their son wrestle, that's great that they could get up here a few times already.\n\nI don't know why they rally.\n\n40 seconds, that's all.\n\nBoys start underneath the bone.\n\nAll right.\n\nThat tough first period state came away.\n\n007 is riding against Marco Rubio.\n\nRick needs to stay behind yards here.\n\nThat's going to be real important that.\n\nHe's managed to do it for about.\n\n30 seconds.\n\nNow that the lady is up, there's the first point of the large Mac O'Reilly part of Iowa.\n\nGoes up five.\n\nI don't know what the the point is here.\n\nListen, doesn't matter how.\n\nMuch I can do about it, okay?\n\nWhatever it was you heard, Wade silences.\n\nNot much you can do about it one another from the third person defender on their field in the second third, 30 seconds.\n\nGot here.\n\nYou know, worst case scenario here is that Iowa State comes out.\n\nThey're not favored and they get major decision to pick up the third right here, right now.\n\nHe's picking that scenario.\n\nOut of there, except, you know, for the fact that great getting in and throw bundles to his back.\n\nBut right now, both in the match and that's what counts.\n\nYou have meets like this.\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\nWe could stay in the match looking at the lady quite average of and his.\n\nScore is one nothing over bone on the team score Iowa State first team Iowa score after 142 comes out macaroni cheese on it does not get.\n\nIt.\n\nOh I has a symbol Let's see if you can take roll take down John.\n\nAs we all know, coming around the counter in this match.\n\nOh, that's good job on that gravy getting in low on butter.\n\nBecause he's hard to get under his short.\n\nHe's got it is hard to shoot from under.\n\nAnd so Matt Ryan.\n\nDid a good job getting it on that low single but almost came up and he didn't have the length to recover like someone in.\n\nThat situation reaching back around.\n\nHe doesn't have that.\n\nMuch don't for that out of the body.\n\nAnd get blown.\n\nRight about being in favor of macaroni on top.\n\nHe got his first takedown near the end of this, the second period right.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nHere's a red one.\n\nWe're talking about the current national seniors now ranked number one, Ohio, Oklahoma State to Iowa, three.\n\nIt's more about Minnesota in the Big Ten and NCAA.\n\nAnd they're also going to be aggressive.\n\nYou can write to us with comments.\n\nYou I am on a one man high school wrestling tournament next week.\n\nGo no, suck it up.\n\nWe're at 152nd period starting double.\n\nChris Bowen Ohio State right now leads right sales of Iowa 3 to 1 in this third period.\n\nMcIlroy, a national champion at 142, only has a.\n\nTwo point lead looking for it here in the open five and his two points he has his closing.\n\nBut as Wade Sharma said, there's Nelson Crowe.\n\nThere never was evidence of it, but he's going to have to score and he hasn't got that right.\n\nHe's got to fight and nothing really happens.\n\nHe has to upset.\n\nRight.\n\nThe but look at these weight control things that Bono can't do because of this.\n\nHis body makeup right there.\n\nHe should stop that.\n\nBono still has the leg.\n\nAubry has lost a good.\n\nPosition here at the touchdown to move it.\n\nGood position in the middle to finish it.\n\nAnd it wasn't he went down that way to go back.\n\nHis flexibility come around.\n\nIs still encouraging for you.\n\nHe's now about to hundred 57 seconds left to go on it.\n\nA lot of talent there shown by McIlroy.\n\nHe got into a bad position.\n\nReally.\n\nHe's been in a couple of bad.\n\nOkay hold off coming out the field spouse card.\n\nOkay.\n\nFreeze when you're ready, Iowa, Here we go.\n\nBig Mac, where he does that for so many.\n\nI mean.\n\nOkay, one Iowa State, one after.\n\nThat's over, the Mac already would like to get an eight point decision If he could.\n\nJust see you just saw that shot.\n\nIt's hard to get any numbers but he's got a hard it's hard to shoot on him and hard to execute.\n\nOut of order.\n\nAnd coaches say they like taller wrestlers better.\n\nBut there are that's one of the advantages of being shorter on your clock.\n\nI was going to say from a defensive standpoint, that's an advantage.\n\nBut he has a number of obstacles.\n\nWant to be there as a first timer, as the one.\n\n20 seconds to go in this match.\n\nOh, got the front headlock.\n\nNow that's come up that 5 to 2 up over that Marco Rubio.\n\nRight.\n\nIowa leads Iowa State, Iowa 13 before coming into this match.\n\nWe'll be going.\n\nInto the international arena where.\n\nAll right, John, I know it's a tough decision for Lincoln to have the lady to take down big Chris Paul, you want to monitor this.\n\nBut Iowa State back to 1993, 34 to.\n\nSeven over that serious by having your passport replaced and.\n\nStill have some chances to win.\n\nAnd at 150, the college wrestling coverage on your statewide home for sports Iowa public television series for Iowa's Future.\n\nThat's the one to.\n\nHere we go again, Iowa State in Iowa, there's what's happened after five matches.\n\nIowa State has a six point lead after the first five.\n\nAnd principally because of what happened at £142, Tim Johnson, we had a disqualification, something almost unheard of in cable for Iowa, of Iowa, Paul coming back to the middle.\n\nHe was extremely slow.\n\nIt was a good call by the official.\n\nAnd Aaron, Ari just lost all mental aspect of what was going on.\n\nIt was a mental thing right here.\n\nHe had been had given four points for stalling and not not he's disqualified.\n\nAnd I don't sit down and argue with the call at all.\n\nI think you could after the last couple of minutes of watching.\n\nAaron out and he wasn't happy about it.\n\nOkay Here's what's happening nationally.\n\nMinnesota, you know, turned everything and threw everything into a cocked hat with what happened with its matches tonight.\n\nOklahoma State and Iowa right.\n\nThey beat Iowa first, then Oklahoma State and took over number one.\n\nWhat do they have the team to stay there?\n\nMaybe they have.\n\nI think a number of people believe they do have the team that could stay on top Penn State for North Carolina Clarion and Iowa State.\n\nNow you see where northern Iowa is in the PAC 13 and Iowa State.\n\nI think what they're doing here shows it.\n\nBut this is what happened out of Iowa versus Minnesota up on the 28th.\n\nWell, Nate, Jay Robinson had it going his way there in his arena.\n\nAnd right here, you know, at the end, it was Bill Pierce at heavyweight sealing the victory and sending the crowd crazy.\n\nAnd they'd won over Iowa for the first time when these coaches were coaching against each other, you know, And so there there they are greet each other.\n\nAnd Gable's former assistant got the best of me.\n\nBut down here at Oklahoma State versus Minnesota, again, it was Minnesota.\n\nAnd again the crowd got behind it.\n\nIt comes out and beats the top ranked team, the top ranked team, Oklahoma State at the time.\n\nAnd now Minnesota.\n\nIs ranked number one.\n\nThey become the top ranked team Minnesota over both Iowa and Oklahoma State.\n\nSo Iowa's now third.\n\nWell, let's take a look.\n\nWe told you earlier that if we would have enjoyed the OR if you have not enjoyed whatever, we'd like to get your comments on our college wrestling coverage this year, 18th season.\n\nLet us know what you think about our Sunday broadcast or any other comments suggestions you might have.\n\nFirst Address College Wrestling Post Office Box 6450 Johnston, Iowa 50131 College Wrestling Post Office Box 6450 Johnston, Iowa 50131 We'd love to hear from you.\n\nAnd we do pay attention to what you're going to what you're going to tell us there.\n\nCheerleaders, They have to bring their team from behind because Iowa trails Iowa State in this wrestling with Iowa city 13 to 7 at the halfway point.\n\nAnd two, we're going up now to £158.\n\nAnd for the first time on college wrestling, we're going to see a man that this fellow Dan Gable, brought out of redshirt in his freshman year.\n\nHe Joe Williams, £158 from Mount Carmel High School in Illinois, Chicago.\n\nDan is really very high on this man.\n\nHe he thinks Joe Williams is everything he'd hoped he would be, but he lost to Harry Smith of Oklahoma State by a technical fall from the great Casimir.\n\nBut I don't have the answer that Joe Joe Williams had a sprained ankle, that he was even born in the third period.\n\nAnd don't come out.\n\nSo this delivered.\n\nHis opponent for Iowa State is going to be another freshman.\n\nThis is a freshman from Colorado very well.\n\n£2 more than a wrestling has a winning record this year.\n\nHe's had some really big performances.\n\nWe saw him in the Hawkeyes come within a point of the number one ranked man show at 167 in the big in the national Duals, £158 and shake hands very well done of Iowa State.\n\nWith Iowa State leading 13 to 7.\n\nIowa has had trouble in some meets in their lower weights and they had him again.\n\nWe had him again.\n\nThey could get themselves into holes and it's hard to dig out.\n\nThey're not that big here.\n\nBut Iowa State put themselves in a position where a couple of big wins puts them in position to win.\n\nAnd so we talked about the glamor match.\n\nBut one night, certainly they live up to everything we're talking about now.\n\nWe've got three important matches before that last.\n\nDan Wheldon comes from Colorado.\n\nHe was a three time champion there.\n\nJoe Williams of four time champion.\n\nThat's it in Illinois for Mount Carmel High School in Chicago, said it ranked number seven already.\n\nHe's just come out of redshirt.\n\nCoached by Bill Wick, a long time Olympic coach, the high school coach, the big on the.\n\nInternational coach last Bill Wickens eventually got it figured out at Mount Carmel.\n\nThat quick low single by Joe Williams.\n\nTo pick that up for you, go with it.\n\nThat was that.\n\nRose I like that.\n\nWe have some stuff on here, Hawkeye.\n\nI don't know single was a it certainly feels like a lot of grease to Wheldon tried to kick out.\n\nPerspiration.\n\nAnd jumped on the hips there and got the two points.\n\nBut now the Iowa State is a couple of times or wrestlers have said, okay, here we go.\n\nIt seems awfully slick.\n\nThere.\n\nSo Chelsea's decided to mop him down a little bit.\n\nNine total points, pretty takedowns belong to Iowa.\n\nOkay, good hold.\n\nRight.\n\nReversals.\n\nIowa.\n\nHere we go, near Falls.\n\nWell, the big six.\n\nPoint swing.\n\nHorse doing scoring the big penalty points right there, six points, zero in the first.\n\nThat National Guard is going to have a big win when he got out to a four point lead.\n\nSo that's a big swing.\n\nAs a real turnover.\n\nJoe Williams, let's weld on up and him confident on his feet under stand by Weld and got nothing take about that Did you get your head up Joe Williams and Gable he said in the opener roll the dice He said, I'm going to bring this young man out.\n\nI said, I don't know how you get there.\n\nNo redshirt.\n\nYou got to.\n\nIt's sort of like move by it.\n\nBut he's going to have to face.\n\nCody and his advantage right here.\n\nOh, he.\n\nWent out for control.\n\nOh, that's a big part of that's a pretty tough injury time.\n\nInjury time three when they go over, you know, still have a lot of grease on his back here.\n\nDo you see anything white and color and most force that's kind of the hips right here I'm calling and time on weight There's no control there before he went out that was a close call.\n\nBut it's a confidence builder for Weldon, just like the Bono Mack and Match.\n\nYou know, I was thinking didn't have an opportunity to say I felt that was a still a confidence builder for Bono.\n\nI think he came off the mat.\n\nI think his coaches probably said to him, You can beat that man.\n\nAnd I think he came off and that gave them kind of a pump going into the into the next match.\n\nSo right here Weldon knows he can getting it on good position and next he says I'm going.\n\nTo finish very key what is the score you're you're ready minute and 50 seconds into the first period of £158 between Joe Williams of Iowa leads 2 to 1.\n\nOkay, cut the time record.\n\nAnd every time, one injury time.\n\nWhy?\n\nIowa State came out of intermission after the first five matches leading 13 to 7.\n\nThat's the way it stands.\n\nThe big turnaround was a clarification that I'm going to go against.\n\nIowa's Erin Holley.\n\nWe're six points from the state.\n\nFrom Wheldon, like some cold snap, and he works that head hard on her.\n\nI think that would he's like a rock, you know, he's like trying to move a big rock right there.\n\nBut this is going to be like a fireman's carry looking at it.\n\n35 seconds to go In the first period.\n\nJoe Williams of Iowa leads very well.\n\nThe Iowa State back to the one they're on their feet.\n\nThere's a quick move by rolling counter.\n\nWith a single leg, but they're small with a lot of speed just for one wall here.\n\nA pair.\n\nNow, they're.\n\nOnly 9 seconds here.\n\nSo it would be a big advantage for Williams if he it hold the state.\n\nLooks like he might.\n\nGo down, go down the rim.\n\nMentally tough young man, he said coming right out of high.\n\nSchool last year right here right off the shot.\n\nHe stuffs the hard drives, catches the hurt his partner later.\n\nOkay, good.\n\nHold right.\n\nHere we go.\n\nSlides around for the two points.\n\nWell, only one second to get out and he's not going to be able to him.\n\nThat's right.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd I take to takedown board.\n\nOkay Iowa State once the down position like a.\n\nPeriod down the stretch he wants his kick this match it's a.\n\nDifferent cycle on what's good position when you're ready to fight now.\n\nGuys this is coming from they understand now and they they're subscribing to a system that gave a lot of concern because he has 100 pieces driving to the school.\n\nDan Gable wrestled.\n\nFor the team that escape.\n\nWilliams up.\n\nIn single shot double barrel.\n\nHe got caught by Joe Williams fake to explode.\n\nHe has he was able to come off another shot.\n\nIt was.\n\nReally quick.\n\nQuite a low double come out very.\n\nClever you know five eight on it where he comes again Well a masterpiece of.\n\n30 seconds gone in the second period.\n\nJoe Williams of Iowa leads 6 to 3 at.\n\n116 point to catch up while looking to wrestle.\n\nReal smart really just to stay in this and keep it close and not back it back down because Williams is so explosive and so talented.\n\nRight hook.\n\nWell, keep good position, fight, push him off the mat.\n\nYou are things that Iowa State have been showing that they can do.\n\nYou'll stay respectable.\n\nOtherwise you're in big trouble against Williams because he's so explosive, so talent.\n\nYou might say.\n\nIt's like, oh, boy, could get it, but not quite yet.\n\nBut he at least stayed in there.\n\nWell, there was tenacity, the resistance.\n\nHe just kept coming, kept coming.\n\nAnd again, he's going to have to fight for his way in the match.\n\nAnd he did it the same way with, well, you know, the talent.\n\nThere's no comparison maybe Bono and Williams.\n\nWell, but the fight, you know, you can't measure fight or front headlock.\n\nWell, the main Connor Williams shot the edge of the Barrett.\n\nWe have 30 seconds to go in the second period.\n\n30 seconds to go at £158 in the second period.\n\nJoe Williams in the Black, 6 to 3 over very well in the Marvel Stadium.\n\nThe hawks in the double have six points to make it that see those wins.\n\nA great great wrestler and a national champion contender welded right here in this match right here.\n\nHe was able to come out of it, I would say keep it up, keeps him in the match, keeps him outside.\n\n6 to 3, right on time, by the way, as Williams 42 seconds for the first second.\n\nOkay.\n\nIowa games will go 35 to go neutral standing Iowa standing neutral third new $13 nice down to 6290.\n\nBeautiful every.\n\nDay and got a great run here and you have that disappointing.\n\nNews.\n\nWheldon trying to go ahead with no trip into the second leg was able to do it.\n\nBut just the fact that he's in that tough in the space.\n\nBobby Douglas, the rest of the cycling look at that double leg and you've got to get it here, they're going to have any chance of winning this match.\n\nHe's got to get this right.\n\nHe got a lower level in his lower right here, right of power.\n\nYou're not going to power where.\n\nThere there's a. Lefty left.\n\nSo when he did it, a whole lot of things right there on one.\n\nHe got in injury time.\n\nSo he broke his first out here.\n\nThat's all that is.\n\nRight.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd staying on top.\n\nOf the White House like he's obsessed with them.\n\nWhen he swept, it was there in the third period here at £58.\n\nBarry Wheldon just took Joe Williams down.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nHere we go.\n\nSix, two, five.\n\nIt's a scratch again.\n\nAnd Joe Williams, who's had been complaining of an injury in his last five at the time, beautiful, single with a time to dwell by road ahead.\n\nJim told you Joe seven blue chip race Forever was one driver coming out of red okay good fresh freshener we got felt and he time but look okay first crash in green.\n\nNumber one green in here.\n\nWell, okay.\n\nHere we go.\n\nHe knows how to finish off an excellent single leg that was done as well.\n\nAs that was a red card.\n\nWell, okay, free first class on Williams.\n\nMoving too fast.\n\nBoy, I'll tell you, this book down to five.\n\nAnd here we go.\n\nA minute to go early.\n\nAnd it's the Iowa State wrestler Griffin that puts an enormous race in Iowa.\n\nYet if well, keep inside that world stalwart able to lunge he's got to get over.\n\nCan't dog it down.\n\nThere's no such thing at this level.\n\nDoesn't matter how.\n\nKeller especially I think.\n\nWhat happens here say it again the same as Iowa, Nebraska, Iowa state does as well.\n\nBut they have as well as anybody could this year.\n\nI looked awful tough right here.\n\nOne could win this match.\n\nYou know, if you're the coach and then someone in the middle of the line, he needs to take advantage.\n\nThey need to get over the edge right here and try to get him not supposed to get we said.\n\nThey knew this would be amazing.\n\nThere is no right in front of it right now.\n\n90 seconds to go, John.\n\nTake our over time to the get it really got want to get it done once again in the back now you know what he has to get it and seconds Williams is literally at off points when they get through that was a good fight with good effort.\n\nOh boy And William one wins and brings his team with him.\n\nThree Williams seven Wheldon 5551 lap.\n\nJoe Iowa they took care on the map where he gave.\n\nDan Gable in the middle.\n\nWhat brands on the right £7 and we're watching Joe Williams fight on that single leg there at the end of the Hawkeye.\n\nI managed to do it right next to the Kansas score number one, the 167.\n\nKelly Wireless, straight from West Hancock High School in Brooklyn.\n\nAnd as opponent is an.\n\nExtraordinarily talented young man who wrestled for a wild ride in Red Bank Green country last year.\n\nHe's ranked third this year at 167.\n\nGreat Britons are He beat Matt and they're aiming to try out this spot for the time being anyway at 11 £67 he's another talented with a lot of skill free state.\n\nKerry won a tough match against Nebraska.\n\nIowa leads Iowa State leads Iowa 13 to 10867.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nYou're out.\n\nOf your.\n\nI know a lot of people wouldn't have figured it'd be this close late night.\n\nAnd we talked.\n\nAbout Iowa State needing to take advantage of every break almost.\n\nThat's what they've done.\n\nIt put their face in the face of Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nIt paid off for.\n\nAbrams Here with that tough.\n\nHeadline tonight, wrote one 3005.\n\nAnd if you look at us to go back carries with him but he would have to grab going to say here in 4003 for Iowa State by three Iowa.\n\nI think he's confident right now 30 oh the first place secret is that the threats to have enemies and so I think that's 31 of the trials state run state junior high number big smile after the pair nice runs by Kelly.\n\nIn 2 minutes and 49 seconds an hour at £177 between Greg Stoner of Iowa, a tall one, 77 pounder.\n\nHe's six feet five.\n\nAnd his opponent.\n\nRobby Steger of Iowa State of Russell last year for three.\n\nThat's a first big mistake by Iowa State as far as the first break that's gone against them.\n\nAs far as the plan.\n\nThrow us out, including Ray brings up.\n\nHe actually just looked like he made up his mind that he had looked like he just sort of made up his mind.\n\nHe had the same you.\n\nKnow, that.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhen you get that, when you have such a natural as quick run the around get that chin like he did, you just have to feed him.\n\nOne on.\n\nRare many times your opponent gets off the back of you get that opportunity.\n\nAnd so getting.\n\nIn front of Iowa, the Hawkeyes have taken the.\n\nLead 16 to 13 after some tough matches in the middle and areas up to nothing over Rob Steger go down as one of come back the greens.\n\nAnd that's what was one of those things.\n\nI think if Iowa State could have got past it that first run right here, shots go down right here.\n\nLook at the length on him.\n\nHe's able to work.\n\nThese are in.\n\nViolation.\n\nHe's like right there.\n\nAnd it has to do with that, I think.\n\nHold the position right when you're ready.\n\nHere we.\n\nGo.\n\nFive inch length of stilt there.\n\nBut he can reach you and you can't.\n\nGet.\n\nRight figures to the you like this.\n\nYeah We're going across the state of.\n\nIowa 16 Iowa State 13.\n\nThey've traded six point.\n\nIt really highlights here.\n\nIt's that trip.\n\nIowa State got a disqualification of 242.\n\nIowa got a pin four right.\n\nAnswer it by 67 right away to 2 minutes and 49 seconds in about right there, almost half of that was in the ball position shot Still.\n\nThat's the way leading to the drop.\n\nAll right, Mark.\n\nYes, that's the one they call the bars.\n\nGah, I think single leg on the side, reaching across for the other guy, getting it up.\n\nTake the man down.\n\nIt's 4 to 1 in favor of Greg.\n\nStill.\n\nAll right.\n\nWhen?\n\nThat hour when your 149.\n\nI said I think I said 249.\n\nIt was a minute and 49 seconds.\n\nThe fall.\n\nWell, I would really like to have a more than regular decision here.\n\nAt 4.8, they could get that and they can't win it all night.\n\nThey can put this out of reach.\n\nIf you look back over with two regular decisions here up by, you end up being scared.\n\nWhen I took a chance because he wanted to turn the year over.\n\n177.\n\nIf you rise out of there on the I'll bet you with a great time under 77 pounder for the world team.\n\nNo he did that.\n\nGet it back for the Cyclones to have an opportunity to be in this match some heavyweight they have to win one of the next two matches.\n\nThis one or 190.\n\nSo it's as simple as that.\n\nAnd then it comes down.\n\nGo down.\n\nBack and at home night.\n\nThat was the one we were calling a match because it's going to be truth of Iowa State number four against Sheridan, Iowa.\n\nNumber two.\n\nIt's as big as anyone could have guessed, or just.\n\nFirst.\n\nOkay, it's still early.\n\nIowa State takes down position.\n\nWell, second period down, Steger goes down.\n\nOkay.\n\nI said I'll tell you, when run de Virginia gets a run.\n\nYeah, he needs a find.\n\nLooks good phrase.\n\nRed Hawk down slowly plays for.\n\nDon't you suppose that there was somebody in Grundy, Virginia, said the basketball coach says, What are you doing on a wrestling team here?\n\n6.5.\n\nHours in Iowa.\n\nWrestling scholarship up for you from five four.\n\nTo three now, as the score figures out, we're just 20 seconds into the second third of 177.\n\nIowa's Greg Stoneman leads Rob Stewart of Iowa State 43.\n\nThe hawks have jumped up to a three point lead in the team score after trailing 13 to 4.\n\nThey got a pin from Ray Burns in the corner in a minute and 49 seconds later, Steph Keller in the match just completed and 67 it was a heel pick again by Steger, but he didn't get up by a stuntman.\n\nBut this time he didn't get picked up.\n\nThat's the second time in the last 30 seconds.\n\nIt's the one after that.\n\nHe'll pick and staggers the post hard enough.\n\nAs the third attempt.\n\nThey just trying to come around here, beat it there and you see a lot more fighting.\n\nThe cyclones are just they're.\n\nJust getting after it and they're getting in the face of the Hawkeyes is create and then problem still has the edge here.\n\n4 to 3 red back and.\n\nOut of the center.\n\nThere's a warning to this, David Oak.\n\nHere in the black area.\n\nHere we go.\n\nAnd that can be important credit to the hey, as you know.\n\nsingle-A four star Stadium managed to get out of hand.\n\nWell, they not only got out of get to.\n\nFinish, but right now someone's got to get.\n\nBack him and he's off with the best thing that could happen for.\n\nCycling probably right here.\n\nThe stalemate right now, Peter doesn't want to get it under the gun.\n\nHe just like they've been looking at all night.\n\nHe had 15 seconds to go back it.\n\nAs you say, you still have Iowa on.\n\nHe's on his knees in the blue, which, by the way, you haven't seen that.\n\nHe starts Stablemates tonight called Bradley Jealous.\n\nRight when he had 2 seconds left.\n\nPete, I don't know where that was supposed.\n\nAppropriate time to go stalemate.\n\nBut of course, the official doesn't look at the clock.\n\nHe just looked up.\n\nI think you heard me say.\n\nWhy don't you drop the sandwich?\n\nYou're out of Iowa State for two, three, one, one session.\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\nRead for us for years.\n\nHe's in the Iowa State lineup now.\n\nReady?\n\nHere we go.\n\n26 years old.\n\nBut that's okay.\n\nWe did jump on the bottom three in the first one game for me.\n\nOkay.\n\nHere we go again.\n\nReady for Iowa?\n\n16 Iowa State.\n\nAll right.\n\nWe're just starting.\n\nThe third period.\n\nA two minute period.\n\nPlease don't worry about it.\n\nFive, four, three, two point lead for the Hawkeyes.\n\nThe next match, Mr. O'Brien, Top 14.\n\nNow Cedar comes.\n\nThat was picked up five five.\n\nOh, yes.\n\nYou win Friday.\n\nFive of the 10 seconds are still and he didn't say the top and here comes over here for one he can't say it was an effort by Stegman right there.\n\nGood reaction by his.\n\nGovernor right there with his hips to come down for the two points, of course.\n\nBut after 8 to 5 is the take down four stars for them.\n\nAll right.\n\nOh, after Hammer rocker behind by, still.\n\nKeep it on his back.\n\nStoner leads by three.\n\nOne down and has half a ride into Iowa.\n\nThrow up Oh we up.\n\n8 to 5 Still we're 40 seconds to go.\n\nAll right.\n\nIs complaining about the arm.\n\nThey're actually dangerous.\n\nOh, okay.\n\nDoesn't seem like a funny place to call again.\n\nIt was already going.\n\nAll right, so here we go.\n\nHe had let him go to the point that he let him go.\n\nAnd then it seemed like Stanford got the job of executing it and was ready to put.\n\nHim on his back.\n\nSo this guy right here, if you're going to call it, it probably should be one right here, right there.\n\nBut look at he's good.\n\nHe's doing it.\n\nAll right.\n\nLooks like to me, that's just a tough, tough situation.\n\nThere's definitely taking.\n\nHim to his back.\n\nOh, almost a touchdown one.\n\nThat's a four here.\n\nWisconsin came, man, your opponent.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter how high I think the guy down at a six and you know technically is negative to get back up right now it's six points for Iowa State and a loss for skill and so that's dangerous right here.\n\nHe takes it down.\n\nHe doesn't return him safely.\n\nHits first.\n\nHere now, Dan Gable didn't hit his head on a shower.\n\nHe hit his body.\n\nAnd then was a difference no.\n\nI understand it did look, I think on his head.\n\nI mean, I think before when he hit his body, you said I there's a difference.\n\nThat's my opinion.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou know, I don't I'm just saying that if he hit his head on the way.\n\nDown, then I think it would have been an.\n\nIllegal slam.\n\nWe're taking a he's to injured to wrestle.\n\nHe'll get out.\n\nAll right.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nI didn't indicate the clock to be started.\n\nThis would be a recovery time situation as opposed to injury.\n\nYeah, he got his hand or, you know, or is shoulder right there on the right shoulder.\n\nThree golfers was way and.\n\nThat's more of the body is just a.\n\nDisagreement.\n\nOkay, good Right.\n\nHere we go.\n\nBut Bobby Douglas said he's it was the wrestling joke Everybody the book he wants his man We have an 8 to 64 still.\n\nIn the match around right here in 5 to 6.\n\nBut now it's 19 to 36 for the Hawkeyes.\n\nThey've done well.\n\nIn the second.\n\nHalf here.\n\nWe'll still forget the second 500 Joe washed up on his main rival.\n\nRight.\n\nFor 163.\n\nYeah.\n\nHe puts on a schedule against him.\n\nWas the world title.\n\nHe's been wrestling with a lot of them and I'm smarter and I'm.\n\nActually working for the former.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThat's it for today.\n\nIt won't have much to do with the fall, but it has everything to do with wrestling, smart, kicking inside position, keeping it going, keeping your opponent to the outside and towards the edge of the mat scoring when the opportunity gives it, because there won't be all that many opportunities between these two.\n\nSheriff, as a very aggressive wrestler in this year and that's what Dan Gable wanted.\n\nHe wanted to stay out of those close matches, just keep going after him, take him down, beat on him a little bit.\n\nYou know.\n\nYou're talking about two great wrestling wrestlers with great character.\n\nBoth are hard runners.\n\nThey both want to be the best, the same thing this year.\n\nThat's the national championship.\n\nSo when it comes to this, it's come down to this week and the next week.\n\nIowa State has to have the win right here to be in the match.\n\nThey are trailing by six Iowa at one time was ahead 13 before it's now 1913, 15 points in a row for the half.\n\nAnd it's been the story of their year, getting it in a deep hole.\n\nOhio State, Minnesota not being able to come back here.\n\nThey've been able to come back, take the lead.\n\nThere's Bobby Douglas.\n\nAnd in one sense, he doesn't like the score, but better chance he has to like, fight this team.\n\nSound like an old fashioned Iowa state Iowa made.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd makes it look like going to go keep your head where you keep your eye on the future.\n\nWell, I guarantee you be more than 10,000 people.\n\nIn the stands with this type of wrestling.\n\nWho's out there today going out on the basketball court?\n\nThat's right out here.\n\nSheriff, against Dan, True now.\n\nHey, hey, Head to head.\n\nGood head to head with a pro digger head in their fight at.\n\nThis issue that's going right back to you.\n\nThey've got to get the inside acquisition.\n\nThere's the advantage to get the inside position, get the hand position right there, and then it opens up a shot.\n\nWe are in the first period with a minute, about 10 seconds and 10 seconds to go at £190.\n\nAnd Joel Sheridan, The Black and Truth in the Reds, -25, almost had.\n\nA leg to work with.\n\nAnd even good Iowa state coaches feel that.\n\nHave to keep that to get people off his head.\n\nThey want to make sure that his head controls the head of the other man and doesn't get control.\n\nBut you see, Sharon is very tough for that collar up their collar move.\n\nHe doesn't give you much to work with.\n\nHe likes to dominate you up there and keep you out of position for defenses.\n\nHis leg attacks, good leg attacks, and usually opens up by looking at.\n\nEither man who scored in the last 30 seconds of the first period, 190.\n\nThis is, as you say, crucial to Iowa.\n\nState.\n\nThat they have to win here at Jackson to make up.\n\nAnd if you want to call for that, come out of the last ten that they won, the last two matches, they win.\n\nThey take take it because they want that opportunity.\n\nAt the end of this period.\n\nWe're going to show you what's happened so far during the slate here.\n\nYou can get it coming after this.\n\nThe ninth match out of ten at Carver Hawkeye Arena.\n\nTim Johnson, no score there.\n\nIowa leads like the 13 right now, it's up to the first half is what happened.\n\nMark, I don't about the genocide decision last year.\n\nA major decision for Iowa State there.\n\nIt was the big win for Iowa State.\n\nLowry was four foot off the ground application.\n\nTough match for Mac already Tough match for Williams, a pin for you.\n\nThat was a big one.\n\nAnd still no one at 177.\n\nNow, there was a point.\n\nI'll tell you what happens here.\n\nIt really didn't they job to take advantage of a window of opportunity there.\n\nHe created that opportunity.\n\nSure.\n\nMade the escape off the whistle on the edge of the football that he wanted to take care of that a great job of getting him in single threat.\n\nLike I said, with that kind of attitude and that kind of shot, he's going to be in this match real, real close.\n\nI'll tell you, the troops got to be able to duplicate that or he won't be in the middle.\n\nWe're in 195.\n\nJust start a secondary share of Iowa has got this kind of play whistle.\n\nDan Truth is being attended to by Iowa State trainer because he had a contact scratch on his upper jaw right up on his arm, I keep on say.\n\nAnd here we go again.\n\nOne one.\n\nNothing in favor of the man in black shirt.\n\nYou had true pass to win in order for Iowa State to have any chance this meet the trail by six big head and only heavyweight remain in a lot of people among the 10,205 were here didn't think it.\n\nWould ever be this close this way but you need to be right here is good.\n\nSure is what you're doing.\n\nYou had to turn it around so that sheer it's on the outside shot, not put itself in jeopardy.\n\nCall me stolen.\n\nIt's no worries at the smart shots ahead.\n\nThen back him up there.\n\nBack a minute to go in the same period.\n\nWe're halfway through.\n\nIt in this position.\n\nLet's there he needs to fight that.\n\nHe had to just try to create an opening right there and get some scrambling going on and something might happen.\n\nDo it at the edge of the map where you can do no risk.\n\nAnd there.\n\nWere no I know, I think Sheriff made the escape at the.\n\nBeginning of the period.\n\nTake it down and get your head to head for it.\n\nGo for his.\n\nShare of Iowa.\n\nOne talk of Iowa State, nothing with 30 seconds to go.\n\nIn the second period of £190.\n\nThere is sheriff trying.\n\nTo get in the leg.\n\nHe wasn't able to do it.\n\nThe run out of bounds.\n\nThere's a great fatigue coming because it's been and turning all the way towards the.\n\nEdge of the man as well.\n\nI said troop needed to do it to keep from getting caught for stalling.\n\nThat could loom big because what it's coming down to is crucial escape.\n\nIt'll be 1 to 1 that he's got to.\n\nRemind you that got a pan out of them between periods.\n\nI want to give you the address to write to for comments about the college season as we've been bringing you this year every season and where you might be in the United States, what would you like to get out of national this year?\n\nLet us know what you know.\n\nOkay.\n\nLet us know what you think about our broadcast time or any other comments, criticism, suggestions.\n\nYou have right to that address.\n\nCollege Wrestling Post Office Box 6450 Johnson, Iowa 501 31 College Wrestling Post Office Box 6450 Johnston, Iowa 5013 one third period 191 down share two picks to go under and like to get that point from escape if he could.\n\nNow he has a lead.\n\nIf he could finish it, it'd be big thing for him.\n\nHe's got to be able to get what he get what he can get, but he's got it.\n\nHe has a point.\n\nHe's got to stay on right here on Earth, does a nice job of kick it out.\n\nBut one more thing.\n\nI think we're 18 seconds into the third period and it's tied.\n\nSheridan One group, one no right time but has been more.\n\nRuns per start.\n\nSee, here's what you're doing to come back.\n\nPush him to the side.\n\nWhat happens when your time that the fight is gone against?\n\nThe Iowa State wrestler Dan Crew, it's in his hands.\n\nHe just needs to know how the rest of the year it seems to know.\n\nThere he comes in on the side for a single leg.\n\nIn fact, with his first real shot.\n\nHe's got to really he's got a him in the center right now.\n\nMorris, The.\n\nQuestion is, can he get it.\n\nHere?\n\nAnd he put it right here, but he gets something after that.\n\nHas not done a lot in the past week.\n\nAnd around the corner from the outside, sometimes known as a.\n\nA straight at you know as bleeding I don't see Well that.\n\nWas a good job right there.\n\nBut Sharrett dodged a bullet by actually kind of jumping.\n\nWalked and.\n\nI ran out of that three safety.\n\nSo let's take care of that one.\n\nHe's in there.\n\nJust take it.\n\nLet's take care of this is going to open up on behalf of the big family that cut his arms over the eyebrow.\n\nI think I don't know what it is.\n\nJust give a quick give a quick one.\n\nSo, you know, there's three three ring circus live on Iowa public television.\n\nIowa High School wrestling championships.\n\nWe have all the weight classes.\n\nWe have all the school sizes.\n\nWe have it live starting at 630 Saturday, the 26th.\n\nIowa Public Television at Veterans Auditorium in Des Moines, where you'll see the stars of today in high school, perhaps the stars of tomorrow in the colleges, the Olympic champions from all of us.\n\nThere is also Jeff McGuinness when his former state title last year.\n\nRight here tonight, we see a unit, brothers.\n\nDan Troupe and Joel.\n\nSheriff, go it again, 1 to 1 here in the third period, troop has been warned he had sheriff in a single leg but but just like that.\n\nAnd those days are over.\n\nTheir father, Sharon, has been able to get away from him on the edge, one on one.\n\nHe has to make the attacks or if he gets penalized, he could lose with or with a penalty point.\n\nThere's a minute to go, right?\n\nHe's not in a situation where you come back up.\n\nIt all has to go forward.\n\nOf course, you're it has he's going on him to give.\n\nSo he really isn't in the same situation as true.\n\nBut of course, the person gets takedowns going to win.\n\nSo somebody is going.\n\nTo step forward.\n\nKurt got a good job year.\n\nHe may get your off a shot.\n\nYou often see Sharon in the position, this position on the wall now with an inside going unusual one to watch 30 seconds to go score 1 to 1 overtime touchdown State's 1 to 1 on 46 seconds to go.\n\nThere's no such thing as a draw.\n\nThey go to overtime.\n\nIf they can't score at five.\n\nDrew doesn't have time.\n\n10 seconds.\n\nSure, sure, sure.\n\nSharon.\n\nSharon doesn't want to.\n\nThat didn't get to the right here on.\n\nBut let's go to set up I don't I think we just didn't want to determine that match.\n\nRight right right there he time but we got three timeout right there that was called that situation There was a two point you don't have to have like even though your opponent said he showed up and watch this here he.\n\nIs right now because he's joking from because he stuck the head with his arm, gets his.\n\nArm on the other side.\n\nHad Tyler ten points so that's not how so granted overtime your better.\n\nWe're going to set the clock.\n\nI'm going to ring Joel Sheridan Sharon of Iowa State leads by six after five Iowa State this game trails by she went around has to have a win here to get out of there now and if they don't score that we'll talk about.\n\nThat later pick I like all of these other things.\n\nI like to be here.\n\nWe're going.\n\nTo play.\n\nYou want it.\n\nThey like the competition.\n\nThey have heart.\n\nAnd that's why they'll want to cut their score to the car to go look for one of these men to make a shot off the whistle.\n\nI thought somebody like a two on one.\n\nShut up by five.\n\nTrue.\n\nNow, now Charlotte goes.\n\nShirtless, back up to.\n\nThe head again, which to watch that single leg by Sharon.\n\nIs everything set up to be right here This ball he kicks out now here is turf across the back three, three three and with the fact that this is everything we've talked about down here, 37, 39, 24 to 30 down the Hawkeyes, 18 straight court run, four straight matches that everything.\n\nThat's why they want to run that.\n\nSo ahead of a heavyweight now, it is Iowa's meet, but you're going to see that.\n\nYou're going to see that last tango.\n\nOh, Sharon on.\n\nYeah, that kept him.\n\nFrom getting a lot of work to make any move at all.\n\nAnd you want to.\n\nGo, Sharon stays strong.\n\nThree, one.\n\nThere's Matt Carson of Iowa State heavyweight Matt Carson of Iowa State against Mike Manzanillo of Iowa at heavyweight.\n\nThis does not mean the meet, but It does mean something to those two young men.\n\n2213 Iowa, they came from 13 to 4 down shot.\n\nIt was a great comeback by Iowa backs against the wall.\n\nYou use the home crowd here and the excitement and some good wrestling and put together quite a strength there.\n\nBut Iowa state and give it fight all the way and it comes down to one No you can't it can't get much more exciting than that.\n\nWell, it was interesting all the way here in a tough run for the Hawks and and again, no matter what happens, it looks like promise for Iowa State all round, all round.\n\nAnd there's something going on in that wrestling show.\n\nWell, has to do with attitude.\n\nIt has to do with the way the wrestler doesn't happen to have to do with all that stable, full of talent.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, and just think what that will do when they start getting recruiting together in a way that system goes you know.\n\nAt heavyweight we are now a minute into the first period 3 minutes long Mike Manzanillo in black against Matt Carson of Iowa State like all they both have losing records is we almost saw we saw Jeff Simpson of Iowa State warm up might be interesting what happened there.\n\nJeff Simpson was from Fort Madison.\n\nHe was a 190 from high school.\n\nHe went on the air, wrestled there for five years.\n\nHe to the Air Force champion both Greco-Roman freestyle.\n\nAnd he's out of the Air Force back at Iowa State.\n\nHe became eligible in the second semester.\n\nHe came back.\n\nHe has four years to go, although he's 26 years right now.\n\nHe has to take those four years straight through.\n\nHe can get no redshirt.\n\nI want to I want to go back to Iowa State.\n\nMight have next year men's.\n\nNow, of course, from the same high school that Joe William.\n\nI'm.\n\nHigh school.\n\nHe's a senior man.\n\nYou got to sort of excellent was never on the same team of Joe Williams who more than five more.\n\nThan capable of saying something every day about the prospect for Iowa for next year.\n\nThey are young man from Northwestern and striking better, stronger, stronger, stronger right into the room.\n\nAnd the second semester.\n\nTransferred in Eric stronger and.\n\nReady for top 20 pre season then came away from northwestern Iowa and he'll be eligible next year.\n\nThere's been and Carson out for the Hawkeyes he'd like to win his.\n\nFinal match here in front of the front of the home crowd the Big Ten's being held Carver Hawkeyes.\n\nA couple others.\n\nIt was trying to tilt.\n\nCarson put him on his upward on his back for a couple of points if he could do it back off the ground, about 25 seconds to go in the big one at 109 goal share over time 25 for Dan troop of Iowa grabbed hold of position green when you're ready Here we go 321 with 37 seconds gone in the overtime period that put.\n\nIowa out of reach for.\n\nCyclones led them at one time 13 to 4 and the 13 points were picked up three seven with a disqualification at Oregon, £42 Aaron.\n\nOutrage of the Hawkeyes was disqualified for too many stalling calls.\n\nOkay, State drop to the first six points for Iowa State.\n\nFirst period.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt's been deferred.\n\nIowa, okay.\n\nIowa's deferred to a selection is a down second period down Iowa and Genarlow in the under okay state.\n\nLet him get set.\n\nOkay.\n\nMaybe you're right.\n\nNow let me thank you, sir.\n\nAnd here we go.\n\nCome on down.\n\nSo Junior West, 109 state runner up when he was in high school.\n\nYeah.\n\nGet him broke down.\n\nHigh waisted crunches that don't go over.\n\nThe bar yet.\n\nEspinoza managed to get up, get his hips underneath him right here.\n\nGraham has got his good, like, right now.\n\nAnd there he doesn't know it gets up his knees.\n\nAnd now it's a matter of how good is Carson on top class?\n\nIt looks like he might be a little.\n\nBit slight to tell by the position that's right there.\n\nBut you got to stay on that anyway.\n\nYeah.\n\nAll right.\n\nCarson has a Rankins this year.\n\nNot that he's been here.\n\nHe didn't want that, so that's okay.\n\nLet's go away.\n\nWe went around Nebraska last time.\n\nZero.\n\nNo, come to the way.\n\nWould it have been the only guy like out?\n\nWe really.\n\nHave one Gary our.\n\nHammerlock Hey Jim Parsons is getting crotch carefully by shower Cooper legal.\n\nI've throughout the go natural Oh what shoulder and what do you call that he down my his hips but through all right down to the side and now he's going to come down and that was he went it was continue to get the ankle and keep rocking back right there.\n\nWithout overcommitting himself kind of let go not let his hips slid down.\n\nHe got out of position.\n\nAll he had to do was get in position.\n\nThere's that pant.\n\nLeg, Kirk And Rachel says you're doing it in a dangerous man.\n\nKind of.\n\nIronic way.\n\nJealous is calling anything dangerous out.\n\nYou know, this is a career when he was okay last year we know that is how would you say punishing a wrestler so was in his time mid seventies people were just scared to death the wrestling he was very talented, unorthodox, but he was punishing.\n\nAnd so the things that you've seen him call off tonight, he would have been up and down, jump up, down, scream and say, oh, well, the wrestler.\n\n20 seconds to go in the second period and generally good moves.\n\nCARSON But Carson has tried very hard.\n\nWell, Carson dropped it there, but he didn't come back up and the nice it was a nice drop in but you have to immediately cut back up.\n\nAnd he just kind of dropped in and stayed.\n\nDown and that is.\n\nOkay.\n\nCyclone Corp, I'm sorry you went down first time, okay?\n\nI was select down, third period, down third period.\n\nIt's 4 to 1.\n\nI five have 4 to 1 is the score.\n\nOkay, here we go.\n\nIowa man Genarlow of Iowa on top leads 4 to 1 over Matt personal.\n\nIowa State.\n\nLet's go move Carson bucket at the down touchdown position he has three points to make up what there is no in time potential right now for a point to Iowa state 30 but it was tough for a while.\n\nThere's a reversal from Carson to right there.\n\nHe's saying I want to rush Russell here.\n\nSo now he's going to pushing the races because I'm not he didn't push me.\n\nHe mentally.\n\nA mental lapse like that.\n\nYou're going to push him pushing the way he's going to come up that here.\n\nI was able to just hang on my leg like that because what Grayson is doing this ball in the direction the coaches say, hey, we can win the ocean away.\n\nGive me one right here.\n\nTake on a minute to go here, down here.\n\nMarshall trying to get this position and, you know, looks like he's in better.\n\nWell, it was a matter of time.\n\nWe got to get past 43.\n\nThere he goes.\n\nAnd he's kept away by Carson.\n\nThat's Manzanillo near fall position for three.\n\nSo that's 66 to 4.\n\nYeah.\n\nThere's no escape ever for.\n\nHim And I think right so Manzanillo is now prime fixed the ball and now he has to play that first game of the year with Carson High and then turned it on the last point and.\n\nStuff like.\n\nThat.\n\nDid you want to reflect that right.\n\nYou want to Russell That must have.\n\nHe must have decided.\n\nThe 1201 here is six second best.\n\nYeah.\n\nI don't care that.\n\nYou took him right off.\n\nHe had him right there.\n\nI don't think quite Chelsea's position.\n\nThat's actually not hard.\n\nFortunately for Carson they got there, he was still in the pit position.\n\nAnd I tell you, the final four here went to the 19th and I would say that back.\n\nThat's about the way the big win.\n\nYou know, I think it's a good feel like this is such a great program that we could have come in here.\n\nAnd I'm embarrassed right now.\n\nI'm going to come away.\n\nWhat do you.\n\nThink that.\n\nIt doesn't?\n\nI think just I can say this.\n\nI would think that there's a future again.\n\nThe same as the past.\n\nAnd they're very pleased.\n\nWith what happened this game, by the way.\n\nWe did not like along the way, Iowa State, among other things, got a pin at heavyweight thinking they had a man disqualified earlier.\n\nAnd the final score turns out to be Iowa 22, Iowa State, 19.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed it.\n\nIt was a tough.\n\nBe sure to join us this next Saturday at 6:30 p.m.\n\nIf only television will provide live coverage of the 1994 high school wrestling championships, as usual from Veterans Auditorium in the morning.\n\nThat's Saturday, February 26th, 630.\n\nFor a good while after that, I plan to watch.\n\nGood Tim.\n\nNow for Tim Johnson, I'm Doug Abrams and good night.\n\nI am on public television.\n\nWatch and goodnight for our director, John Nichols, leaving us after this year to go over to market the markets.\n\nHe's going to teach Mark Pearson how to do a wizard.\n\nWe're going to get in and goodnight and better.\n\nMajor funding for this program was provided by Friends of Iowa Public Television."
