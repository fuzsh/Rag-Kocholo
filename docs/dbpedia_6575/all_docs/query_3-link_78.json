        "text": "BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - Theresa Blair Davis, the Director of Safety and Training for Warren Rural Electric (WRECC), has been a dedicated employee for 44 years.\n\nShe will officially be retiring from the company in September. Reflecting on her journey, she recalls her upbringing, career, and the values that have guided her.\n\nBorn in Akron, Ohio, Davis was raised in a loving, Christian home. Her parents both worked at Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.\n\n“I’m the oldest of six children, and we were raised in a very warm and loving home,” she said.\n\nDavis’s family moved to Bowling Green when her father took a managerial position at Firestone. She attended Bristow Elementary School, which was undergoing renovations during her time there and later graduated from Warren East High School. She began working at Firestone during high school, gaining experience that would shape her future career.\n\nIn 1980, Davis joined Warren Electric as a secretary to the Superintendent of Operations.\n\n“When the Firestone textiles plant shut down, I applied for a position at Warren Electric and was hired,” she said. “I served as a senior secretary and switchboard operator from 1980 to 1987.”\n\nDavis’s career evolved as she took on the role of the district administrative and dispatch supervisor.\n\n“During those years, we started a dispatch program and hired students from Western Kentucky University to take calls after hours,” she said. “Eventually, we advanced to full-time dispatchers.”\n\nSafety has always been a paramount concern for Davis.\n\n“When I first started, there were several fatalities due to electrical contact accidents,” she said. “We didn’t have the safety controls in place back then. I’m grateful that now, with regulations and safety devices, such incidents are rare.”\n\nDavis credits her strong faith for her dedication to safety and service.\n\n“I have a strong core belief in God and was taught to read and study the Bible daily,” she said. “I believe God gives us all gifts and talents, and my gifts are teaching, administration, organization, and encouragement.”\n\nDavis values the importance of using her God-given gifts to serve others.\n\n“I’ve been satisfied in my job because I’ve been able to use my natural gifts,” she said. “Safety and training are about the welfare of others, and I care deeply about the 162 employees here.”\n\nDavis also spoke about the importance of community and partnerships.\n\n“We serve our members and always keep that paramount in our minds,” she said. “The biggest storm I recall was the ice storm, which required a lot of organization and coordination to restore power. The mutual aid between states is crucial during such times.”\n\nAs she looks forward to retirement, Davis plans to spend more time with her family and travel.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed traveling to Israel, Ireland, Scotland, and Mexico,” she said. “I’m excited about the next journey and the opportunities it will bring.”\n\nDavis leaves behind a legacy of passion and dedication.\n\n“I’ve always cared ardently about people’s safety and development,” she said. “The people I’ve worked with have become friends, and I’m grateful for the time I’ve spent serving our community.”"
