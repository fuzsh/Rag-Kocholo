        "text": "Dr. Tamara Borland joined the World of Animals team in 2017. Her passion for veterinary medicine began at the early age of 12 volunteering for a local veterinary hospital. She earned her undergraduate degree at Boston College then went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine where she earned her V.M.D. in 2007. After graduation, she headed west to the San Francisco bay area enhancing her knowledge and skills set. She feels honored to be a part of caring for pets and the humans they love, and focuses on delivering excellent patient care with understanding and compassion. Her special interests are dentistry, dermatology, and surgery. In her off time, she enjoys indulging her amateur foodie title exploring new restaurants, going on hikes with her dog Picxie, and feeding her love for music, art, and literature.\n\nDr. Flasik earned her DVM from Colorado State University in 2018. In her youth, she volunteered and worked for a local animal shelter. In college, she explored her passion for diversity and social justice. Now, as a veterinarian, Dr. Flasik connects with people and empowers them to make the best decisions for their furry friends. She loves helping people understand the complexities of their pets’ health concerns and providing them with the options and resources they need.\n\nOne of her most important pieces of advice for pet parents is to brush their pet’s teeth as often as possible. Dr. Flasik recommends finding a toothpaste flavor your pet likes and slowly helping them get used to having their mouth handled and their teeth and gums touched. It can take time, but the results are more than worth it! Good periodontal health is essential to good overall health. Another thing she wants pet parents to know is that pictures and videos of their pets are super helpful to their treatment. If your pet is limping, coughing, or just acting differently, a video can help Dr. Flasik get a better idea of what is going on.\n\nAt home, Dr. Flasik has a handsome black senior cat named Malcolm, who is in hospice care due to heart failure. Originally given a 6-month prognosis, Malcolm is still kicking after 3 years, and he regularly greets Dr. Flasik at the door when she returns home from work. Outside the practice, Dr. Flasik is a huge foodie who loves trying new restaurants, along with cooking and baking. She also enjoys singing karaoke and napping. But in addition to relaxing outside of work, Dr. Flasik also makes time to help others, having volunteered as a victim advocate at rape crisis centers in Colorado and Philadelphia for a combined 10 years.\n\nDr. Danielle Blair is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. Dr. Blair is new to the area after working in private practice in the Washington DC area for the past 7 years. She feels privileged to join the World of Animals family and have the opportunity to help pets and their owners.\n\nDr. Blair has special interests in soft tissue surgery and dermatology. Her philosophy is to treat every patient as if they were her own pet. She has a sweet rescued dog, Willow, and until recently had a beloved cat, Simba, who she adopted during vet school. In her spare time Dr. Blair enjoys painting, traveling, volunteering with local animal shelters, and knitting."
