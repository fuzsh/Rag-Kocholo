        "text": "I began my journalism career in college by accident. I worked in college as the web design for the college paper and one night the entire staff was fired except for three people â€“ and I wrote my first news piece and designed my first newspaper. After college, I worked at three of the top newspapers in Georgia, winning awards not only for my writing but design and photography, too .\n\nOver that time I wrote news, breaking news, business, features, sports, and especially entertainment stories. I also interviewed some of the biggest names in music."
