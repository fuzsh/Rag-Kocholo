        "text": "Dr. Jami Lercher brings fourteen years of public school teaching experience in Iowa and Minnesota to her role as Assistant Professor of Choral Music Education at the Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music in Berea, Ohio. Having taught elementary, middle, and high school vocal music, she is an advocate for music education for all. She currently conducts the Baldwin Wallace Treble Choir, teaches courses in choral methods, vocal techniques, and conducting, and supervises pre-service educators through their clinical practice.\n\nAs a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, Lercher completed her master’s degree in the United Kingdom at the University of Wales, Bangor. Her thesis explored teaching singing to the hearing impaired and she partnered with the British charity Music and the Deaf to complete her research. She also studied Celtic music and discovered the rich choral traditions of Wales through her travels.\n\nLercher’s doctoral research focused on the life and choral music of Morfydd Owen (1891-1918), a Welsh composer whose catalog of works remains vastly unpublished and unperformed. She also champions music from marginalized voices, particularly women, and seeks to bring attention to suppressed works through performance and study. Her edition of Vittoria Aleotti’s Surge Propera Amica Mea is currently published through Walton Music.\n\nAn active performer, Lercher sang as a contracted singer with the Minnesota Chorale, where she also served as an assistant conductor. She served as the artistic director of the South Florida Jewish Chorale for two seasons and was the founding co-chair of the ACDA-Minnesota 9-10 Grade Treble Honor Choir. In 2022, she will conduct the North Dakota All-State Treble Choir.\n\nLercher is an active member of ACDA, NCCO, and NAfME. She has presented at state and national conferences on programming diverse music from underrepresented composers, using repertoire to inform warm-up techniques, and selecting appropriate solo repertoire for choral singers. When not making music, she loves enjoying the great outdoors with her husband (Ryan) and daughter (Luci).\n\nDr. Kyle Nielsen is the Director of Choral Studies at Southern Virginia University, where he was voted Professor of the Semester in Spring 2019 by the students and faculty. He conducts the Chamber Singers and Men’s Chorus, teaches Conducting, Choral Literature, and Applied Voice, oversees the Vocal Music Internship and Music Education programs. Previous to Southern Virginia, Nielsen completed the Doctor of Musical Arts in Choral Conducting at the University of Miami Frost School of Music. While at Frost, he led the university men’s chorus Maelstrom, taught in the Experiential Music Curriculum, directed marketing and recording services for the Choral Studies area, and was the assistant conductor for the internationally-acclaimed Frost Chorale.\n\nAn active clinician and researcher, recent conference presentations have included the Western Division and National Conference of the American Choral Directors Association in addition to a recent webinar with Chorus America. An excerpt of his dissertation research was recently published as a Case Study in the Eastman Case Studies series, titled “Kinnara Ensemble, A Project-Based Ensemble.” Upcoming engagements include the Utah State Large Choir Festival coupled with various high school clinics throughout the mountain west.\n\nNielsen also collaborates with some of the country’s leading professional vocal ensembles. Recent positions include conducting fellow with Grammy-nominated Seraphic Fire in addition to Artistic Administrator for the Santa Fe Desert Chorale, where he coordinated all artistic contracting and operations. Additional appearances as a professional ensemble singer include the Piedmont Singers (Virginia), Schola Cantorum at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart (Virginia), Brevitas (Utah), and Musica Judaica (Florida).\n\nIn addition to the University of Miami, Nielsen holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music and Theatre from Southern Virginia University and a Master of Music degree in Choral Conducting as well as Vocal Performance and Pedagogy from East Carolina University.\n\nMisty L. Bermudez, M.M. ’05, teaches Humanities and Music at Miami Dade College, Kendall Campus where she serves as the Coordinator for Classical Voice and directs the campus select choir, the MDC Kendall Chamber Singers. Ms. Bermudez has been the Artistic Director of the Civic Chorale of Greater Miami, an 80-voice community choir, since 2018. She is the first female Artistic Director in the group’s 50-year history.\n\nA founding member of Seraphic Fire, Miami's professional chamber ensemble, Ms. Bermudez performed, recorded, and toured extensively with the group and appears on both its Grammy-nominated albums. As a chamber artist, Ms. Bermudez has sung with the Grammy-winning ensemble Conspirare in Austin, Texas, the Oregon Bach Festival, the Santa Fe Desert Chorale, Spire Chamber Ensemble in Kansas City, and the Yale Choral Artists.\n\nAs a soloist, Ms. Bermudez has been praised for her “standout” performances and for the “dark sweetness” of her voice (South Florida Classical Review, Palm Beach Post). Solo concert engagements have included performances with Southwest Florida Symphony Orchestra, Opera Naples, San Antonio Symphony, The New World Symphony, Back Bay Chorale in Boston, Master Chorale of South Florida, Tucson Symphony Orchestra, and Illuminarts in Miami.\n\nMs. Bermudez served as a master teacher for the participants of the Professional Choral Institute, an initiative in 2011 and 2012 by Seraphic Fire, which aimed to educate talented pre-professional singers about the world of professional ensemble music. She was a panelist at the Women's Choir Festival at FIU for the session “Paths to Careers in Music Leadership,” with an emphasis on women's issues in March of 2017. In November of 2018, she was a guest coach with Seraphic Fire’s Ensemble Artist Program at UCLA. Ms. Bermudez is in demand as a visiting clinician for local high school music programs and for university music programs around the country.\n\nPraised by the Miami Herald for their “impressive maturity and striking melodic distinction”, Sydney Guillaume’s compositions are known to be intricate, challenging, and yet highly spirited. They promote human values and are full of heart and passion. Many of his choral works, most with original poetry by his father Gabriel T. Guillaume, have fostered an awareness of the beautiful Haitian culture and continue to serve as an ambassador for his native country. In 2016, he was inducted into the 1804 List of Haitian-American Change Makers, a prestigious list named in honor of Haiti’s year of independence that “recognizes Haitian-Americans in the United States who have demonstrated outstanding achievement and success in their profession and proven themselves to be forces for change in their communities.” In 2017, he was honored by the top music school in Haiti for his “great contribution in the expansion and the promotion of the music and culture of Haiti around the world.”\n\nGuillaume’s compositions continually enthrall choirs everywhere and have been performed around the world. They have been featured at numerous conferences and international festivals like the American Choral Directors Association (ACDA), the World Choir Games, and Ireland’s Cork International Choral Festival.\n\nNearly all of his choral compositions have been commissioned works. He’s written for renowned choirs such as the Grammy-award nominated Seraphic Fire, the Westminster Chorus, the University of Miami Frost Chorale, the Nathaniel Dett Chorale, the Illinois Wesleyan University Collegiate Choir, the Saint Louis Chamber Singers, and the Miami Children’s Chorus.\n\nGuillaume also writes film music, having written original film and documentary scores for the Los Angeles-based company Loyola Productions.\n\nHe is an active member of the choral community as a composer, singer, clinician, and conductor. In 2013, he conducted the Pennsylvania Music Educators Association (PMEA) District 12 Honor Choir and, more recently, the 2017 Connecticut Southern Region Honor Choir. He has also presented at several symposiums and conferences, both domestically and abroad. Most recently, he presented at the 2016 West Virginia ACDA Conference and the FORO CORAL AMERICANO in Argentina.\n\nSince 2013 he has been the conductor of Imbroglio Sextet, a group of musicians from Haiti, Spain, Bolivia and the United States. The group met in Haiti at the École de Musique St. Trinité summer camp, where they all volunteer as music teachers. As the director of the sextet, he has toured through Texas, Louisiana, Armenia, Great Britain, and Spain.\n\nHis recent activities as a conductor also include the 2019 Florida All-State Middle School Treble Chorus, the 34th annual Idaho State University Choral Invitational Festival, the 2018 Maine All-State High School Mixed Chorus, an all-Guillaume concert at New York City’s Lincoln Center, the 2018 Virginia District 12 High School Mixed Chorus, and concerts with the Imbroglio Sextet at Carnegie Hall and at the 2018 ISME World Conference in Azerbaijan.\n\nSydney Guillaume graduated from the University of Miami in 2004, where his works were performed by the Miami University Chorale conducted by Dr. Jo-Michael Scheibe. Originally from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, he currently resides in Portland, Oregon, where he continues to work as a full-time composer, conductor, and clinician, and frequent workshops his music with university and high school choirs throughout North America via Skype.\n\nMandy Mikita Scott is in her eighteenth year of teaching, and her thirteenth at her alma mater, Rockford High School, where she is Director of Choirs and teaches around 200 students daily in four ensembles. She feels privileged to be on a team with her husband, Jed Scott, who directs the Rockford Aces and volunteers much of his time to support the choir program, and Renee Vande Wege, who directs the Rockford Freshman Choir.\n\nMandy studied at Western Michigan University with Joe Miller and Steve Zegree and received her Master of Music in Choral Conducting from the University of Miami with Jo-Michael Scheibe. She is grateful that her choirs have had the opportunity to perform in Carnegie Hall, the National Cathedral, the World Choir Games in Riga, Latvia (where they earned Gold Medals in their categories), and St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, Italy. Her choirs have also performed at both the ACDA-Michigan Fall Conference and the Michigan Music Conference.\n\nThe Rockford Choirs actively commissions new choral works, and under her direction, the choirs have commissioned over 30 compositions and arrangements, including works from Z. Randall Stroope, Andrea Ramsey, Alice Parker, Michael McGlynn, and many others.\n\nMandy was the Michigan High School SSAA State Honors Choir conductor in 2014 and has served terms on both the MSVMA Full Board as High School Repertoire chair and Executive Board as the Director of Sight Reading and Music Selection. She has also served on the ACDA-Michigan Board.\n\nMost of all, Mandy has had fabulous choral opportunities in her career thanks to her incredible husband and family. Together they have spent time with legendary choral composer Alice Parker on her farm in Massachusetts, hosted The Real Group in Rockford, and written poetry with her youngest, Daniella, for an Andrea Ramsey composition (\"I'll Be With You\"). Mandy and Jed have three children, Owen, Julian, and Daniella.\n\nDr. Krueger formerly served as the Director of Choral Activities at Valdosta State University, Emporia State University, and Florida Southern. She also served as the Associate Director of Choral Activities at the University of South Carolina and the University of Montevallo. A native of Wisconsin, Krueger received her bachelor's degree in Music Education from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and both an M.M. and D.M.A. in Choral Conducting from the University of Miami.\n\nAn active clinician, adjudicator, and guest conductor, Krueger has most recently conducted festivals and honor choirs at the collegiate, high school, and middle school levels in Maryland, Arkansas, South Dakota, North Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, Kansas, New York, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Washington, Georgia, South Carolina, North Dakota, Indiana [2021] and Kentucky [2021].
