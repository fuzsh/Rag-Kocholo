GEORGIA\n\nOCTOBER\n\nVOL. 48\n\nNO. 1\n\nTHE SCHOOL HELPER\n\nVolume 48\n\nOCTOBER, 1947\n\nNo.\n\nSports Review\n\nPRE-SEASON FORECAST\n\nNineteen boys, eager for the coming football season, reported at G. S. D. on Septem'ber 2nd for early grid practice. In spite of the heat wlave which occurred here throughout the week, some light workouts were held in the forenoons and a heavy one each afternoon. The candidates, sweating under the broiling sun, fought for positions on the first team, and by the time school opened the'lineup was more or less decided.\n\nRoscoe Dukes is to fill the vacancy of the wingback position of speedy Hulet Hawkins who graduated last May. Doyle Norris, last year's end, will probably take over tl:]e trials and tribulations' of the blocking back slot. Raymond Baker, a triple threat, will retain his old berth at fullback, while Herbert White has won the nod for tailback position. Bud Little, a capable pass receiver, will play left end and Eugene Whittle, despite his weight and size (that is to say, the lack of both) has shown promising abiliy at right end. Jack Callaway, the indestructible, will continue to hold the fort at center after the fashion of Vaughn Mancha while Mock and Byrd who turned in a fine performance last year will continue stopping offensive threats at tackle. Left guard will be veteran John Harrell and George Vaughan has won over all competitors for running guard. Georgie has shown much promise but needs a few games to season him properly. Billy Hayes shot up like a weed this summer and will probably be a continuous challenge to Callaway at center. Pate will be alternate tackle and reserves at other positions are more numerous than last year.\n\nCoach Van Cott's boys face' a heavy schedule. In fact, they ought\n\n(Continued on page five)\n\nJAYS TOP LAFAYETTE\n\nIN 7 . 6 UPSET\n\nIt was, all in alL a bright day\n\nfor Georgia even though the Bull-\n\ndogs of Athens did go down before North Carolina. The Yellow Jackets of Tech waltzed around, through and over Tennessee and the Blue Jays of G. S. D. upset a LaFayette High eleven that was backed to beat them by at least two touchdowns. The Blue Jays, however, played headsup fooball, took quick advantage of breaks, refused to be discouraged when things did not go right and walked off the field in triumph. The biggest factor in the Blue Jay win was the field generalship and ball toting ability of Raymond Baker. He kept the LaFayette backfield on their toes to stop his passes, drew them in to stop a through the line offense and then crossed them up with another pass timt and again.\n\nThe game started with a bang. The Jays received, tried three plays and punted, recovering the ball on LaFayette's 49 when the safety dropped the punt. The Jays were again forced to punt but on the first play LaFayette tried they again fumbled and Whittle recovered on the 29. Baker picked up seven around end, Dukes two thru tackle, and after an incomplete pass, Baker went around to the 18 for a first down. Another end run failed to make any gain and then Whittle broke loose on a razzle dazzle, \"who's got the ball?\" play and went all the way to the goal without being touched. Joy quickly turned to sorrow when it was nullified by a holding penalty. From here on to the' intermission it was a see saw affair. LaFayette twice threatened to score but the plucky Blue Jays put up determin-\n\n(Continued On page ten)\n\nJAYS TROUNCE DALLAS\n\n200\n\nThe Blue Jays won the toss and\n\nreceived. After making one first\n\ndown on their 44, they were tossed\n\nfor a loss twice in a row. Baker\n\ngot off a 'low lively punt that\n\nseemed destined t,o bounce out of bounds on the Dallas 40, The ball, as footballs often do, had ideas of its own and bouncing at an angle took off down the side line like a scared jackrabbit and rolled all the way to the 12 where the Blue Jay ends covered it perfectly. This fine punt kept the game in the Dallas end of the field the whole first quarter with both teams .feeling each other out.\n\nIn the second quarter, Dallas put on a drive that carried them to the G.S.D. 40. Here their ground attack bogged down. Dallas punted out on G.S.D.'s 21 and Baker and Co. took over, going all the way for the first marker. Baker went over from the Dallas 14 and also garnered the extra point. In this 79 yard drive, Baker carried the ball 47 yards in six tries and passed to Dukes for 21 to get the Jays in scoring territory on the Dallas 15.\n\nIn the second half th~ Blue Jay line tightened up with Calloway. Harrell and Capt Mock repeatedly throwing the Dallas backs for loss. A Blue Jay drive was stopped by a penalty in the third quarter but with the opening of the 4th period they really went to town. Starting from their own 45 they went over in exactly seven plays, Baker and White sharing honors. White made two beautiful thru tackle slants, one for 14 and the other for 10, and Baker started the parade with a 15 yd. run from his own 45 to Dallas' 40. Baker went over from\n\n(Continued on page eleven)\n\n(1)\n\nFaculty Notes\n\nV lOLA McMICHEN\n\nThe Convention We feel it was extremely for-\n\ntunate for our school that the Convention of American Instructors of the Deaf was held in nearby St. Augustine last summer.

Hollingsworth, Supt.,\n\nEven in her childhood days she became interested in the deaf and their problems. Her home was in Fulton. Missouri where the school for the deaf of that state is located. Her uncle. the late D. C. McCue, was 'assistant superintendent of the Missouri School and it was through him that she first became interested. After she was graduated from Christian College, Co.lumbia. Missouri, she entered training for work With the deaf at Fulton. While training, she served as su?stitute teacher gaining valuable experiwee. The fast year after completing training, she taught a private pupil living in the home of the deaf child's family in Durant, Oklahoma.\n\n.After teaching at the .Georgia School for eight years, MiSS Adams was marned to Mr. W. S. Gibbons of\n\n(6)\n\nTHE SCHOOL HELPER\n\nOftober, 1947\n\nCave Spring. For several years Mr. Gibbons had been on the staff of the school. later going into the machinery business. He is now one of the leading implement dealers of northwest Georgia. Following their wedding in 1912, Mr. and Mrs. Gibbons lived in Rome for five years. Then came America's entry into World War I creating a shortage of workers along all lines. Mr. Harris. who was the superintendent at that time, induced her to again consider a place in the institution as her contribution in the emergency that existed. Since that time her work had been continuous.\n\nMrs. Gibbons had the distinction of being one of two teachers who had served under three superintendents, the late W. O. Connor. the late J. C. Harris, and the present superintendent, Mr. Hollingsworth.\n\nMrs. Gibbons had another distinction which few can claim. For more than twenty years she served as associate editor of the School Helper and for the past five years as editor.\n\nMrs. Gibbons possessed a rare combination of culture. graciousness. charm, intelligence, friendliness, sympathy, and cooperation. Her work was characterized by outstanding leadership, constant inspiration. cherished ambitions for the schooL and sympathetic understanding of and friendly interest in every child and everything that pertained to our school life. Her intelligent effort to carry out the high ideals and aims of the Georg'a School for the Deaf have succeeded in helping to bring to our school scholastic recognition and well-deserved honor to herself.\n\nWe shall miss this friend and shall ever cherish the fond memories with which she is so closely associated.\n\nWe hope, as the years pass, there will be a source of recurring pleasure to her in recallitlg memories of friends, activities. and interests during the years she spent with us.-M.K.\n\nOur New Principal\n\nUpon taking over as editor way back in '4 J, it was our first duty and a sad one, too. to make the announcement that our Mr. John L. Caple wa$ leaving us to take over as superintendent of tne Arkansas School for the Deaf in Little Rock. We left Georgia ourselves the next year to return a year later and in the meantime the editorship of the Helper had been placed in the capable hands of Mrs. Nell A. Gibbons now retireck In charge of the Helper again after a lapse of six years. we find our first write up dealing with the same subject, this time happily in the reverse. It is indeed a pleasure to welcome Mr. Caple back to G.S.D. as principaL and to greet again his attractive wife. Janice, and daughter Suzanne.\n\nMr. Caple served as superintendent of the Arkansas School for four years from 1941 to 1945,. After that he was instructor in Machine Shop Practice in the Arkansas Public Schools for two years, teaching at Little Rock Tech High, Little Rock Jr. Co1Lge. al,d\n\nfor the Veterans' Administration .

Ml. Caple w:as Shop Practice expert of the group.\n\nWe are fortunate indeed to have secured a man with such- wide experience and proved ability, doubly so in that Mr. Caple needs no introduction or orientation as to our school and its problems.

Staff Members Retire\n\nMrs. Lelia Barnett retired as' matron this fall after twenty years of faithful service to our school. Mrs. Barnett began her work at G.S.D. as a supervisor of the small boys. She was later asked 1\"0 ;l'd ;>nd soon to head the home economics department. When a vacancy occurred for matron-dietitian she was asked to take this position and in this capacity served until her retirement.\n\nThough her presence will be missed on the campus, her many friends join in wishing her many years of ~se and content which to her are justly due.\n\nMiss Luella Brown was for a number of years a teacher and later a ,supervisor of the small boys. She found great happiness in teaching these children that they could be happy and enjoy life with even simple things. She never tired of planning surprises for ,them or of sharing in their little joys and sorrOWi.\n\n(Continued on page ten)\n\n(7)\n\nSuperintendent's Corner\n\nEx - GOVB,R OR\n\nIt's The People Chase S.

She left our school in 1942 to assume the position of supervising teacher of primary grades at the Arkansas School for the Deaf in Little Rock. She served i.n this capacity until 1945 when she moved to Jackson, Mississippi, to become supervising teacher of the academic department of the Mississippi school. We are indeed glad to have Miss Casey take over the direction of our intermediate grades. especially because of her experience in and knowledge of speech training and the use of hearing aids.

Taking advantage of their greater weight and many reserves they pounded their way slowly from their own 40 to a first down on the G.S.D. 2. Here, after 2 tries, they pushed across the first touchdown of the game but missed their try for extra point. When the Jays received, and couldn't get going, it seemed in the bag for LaFayette. The Jays did not agree to that, however, and if LaFayette dominated the third period. Baker and Co. completely took over the fourth.\n\nAlternating passes with running plays the Jays moved from their own 35 to LaFayette's 11 only to loose the ball on a fumble. E en this could not dampen the Blue Jay fighting spirit. LaFayette punted and Wlhite returned it from the 38 to the 26. Baker passed to\n\nend to be back on tht eleven when they had been a few minutes before. After an incomplete pass.

On the all important try 'for the extra oint, Baker faked a pass and went over without being\n\ntouched.

Mrs. McCasley knew about the case (although Barbara lived in another county.) She was interested and proved very helpful. She went with me to the Newnan Hospital to help locate Miss Jackson, Barbara's aunt.. Although Miss Jackson was on night duty and resting at the time, she, on learning that it was some one from Cave Spring to see her little niece, dressed immediately and came over to the hospital. Miss Vesta was very kind to go all the way to Franklin and back t() direct the way and to expedite the business at hand. Her little niece, Barbara Jackson, proved to be a very precious child. totally deaf, but bright and chippyas a lark. I am sure she will make a fin~ -little pupil. It does one good to meet people like the Jacksons. They are, as Ex-Governor Osborne of Michigan said of the people of Worth County, \"just plain honest-to-God people.\"\n\nAlso, I want to tell you that ~ranklin, and Heard County, are Just as pretty as you and Dorothy depicted it. This is Mr. Caswell's home county and I must have passed near his home when I came through in the morning.\n\nI was about to forget to mention that the ever reliable County Welfare Office saved me another trip out from Newnan by informing me that one other applicant in that county was not deaf but quite a problem child who had already been committed to the Boys' Training School at Milledgeville. You can readily see the necessity of examining and investigating each applicant before accepting him as eligible for admission to the Georgia School for the Deaf.\n\nFrom Newnan I proceeded on as far as Warm Springs by eventide. Here I spent the night at the Warm Springs Hotel in the Georgia home of the late Franklin D. Roosevelt. What another fine spot in which to find myself! You will recall I spent three weeks at this hotel in the summer of 1935\n\nwhile buying watermelons for L.E. Holloway and Company: I was somewhat at home about the place. I was very anxious to see Mrs. Ruth Stevens, author of \"Hi-Ya Neighbor.\" I had met her before and liked her very much. She became a close friend of Roosevelt, and was dubbed by him \"The Duchess of Meriwether County.\" Following the publication of \"HiYa Neighbor\" Mrs. Stevens is experiencing some of the joys of notoriety which she accepts with charming grace. You can imagine my chagrin in finding her absent. And, of all things, she was right up near home at Cedartown making a talk to one of the service dubs-just my luck. Anyway, I am going to buy her book and have my and Roosevelt's mutual good friend (I got a bang out of that) autograph it for me.\n\nI left Warm Springs early this morning en route to Columbus. There is always work to do and new applicants to see in Columbus. There will always be just as long as Mrs. S. P. Wright is living and able to navigate. You will recall she was up for commencement and has visited the school a number of times. I do not know how the First Baptist Church, the deaf, and parents of the deaf children in Columbus could get along without Mrs. Wright. To relate how she first became interested in the deaf would make a good story of itself.

That as to the huddle is incorrect.\n\nOn page 592 of Dr. L.H.

I had scouted Auburn personally and I saw that on receiving the kickoff Auburn had only one ma:n 10 yards from the ball, the other players being\n\nthem with his sparkling imagination. This was his story:\n\nIn this game for the Southeastern championship, played at Brisbane Park on Thanksgiving Day. 1896, Auburn was holding the powerful Ge~rgia team helpless, Woodruff explalned.\n\n\"Tichenor seemed to know Georgia's 'Signals and called out to his men where each play was going.\" (Tichenor was Auburn's captain and quarterback.)\n\nFinding themselves thus thwarted\n\nscattered far down field. I planned a short dribble kickoff and, if we were successful in getting the ball. two more plays were planned without a signal.\n\n\"Georgia kicked off in the second half, the score being 6-6 and Georgia being outplayed in the first half. The . kick was dribbled to the right and Georgia was lucky enough to recover it Ileal' the right sideline. Quickly and without a signal the whole Georgia team lined up to the left of the ball l\\ind the center lateraled it to a back\n\nWoodruff proceeds: \"The Georgia players went into the first huddle that was ever seen on a football field and at the conclusion of the conference sent their playoff without sig-\n\nwell to the left and he ran for a gain of about 25 yards.

For all those three trick plays to work perfectly was almost a miracle and that is why I remember the game so vividly.\n\n\"I do not believe any coach or col-\n\nit was all about.

NEWS\n\nCadwallader W'ashburn has tri-\n\numphed again. For the greater part\n\nof his 80 yea r s as an unrivaled\n\namdassador plenipotentiary of the deaf. Dr. Washburn has been roaming the face of the earth rubbing elbows with princes and potentates without losing his common touch and proving to the world that the deaf can and do lead charmed lives. Not so lon~ ago hearing society once more threw wide open its arms to embrace the world's No. I dry point etcher. even though he is shy of speech and could qualify for the dunce's cap in lipreading work.\n\nSpringing from an illustrious Maine ancestry immortalized in American politics, by the slogan .'As goes Maine so goes the nation\" Dr. Washburn was wined and feted by Bowdoin College during :l'ts' commencement exettises last June.\n\nAt the alumni banquet to his right sat Han. Horace Hitdredth, Governor of Maine. who the year previously had delivered a stirring historic state paper during the Lincoln Day dinner lauding the Washburn family for it~ momentous infuence on Abraham Lincoln. At Cadwallader's left was seated Dr. Sills. president of Bowdoin College who with his wife some months before had paid homage to the celebrated deaf artist at his birthday party and who later conferred upon him an honoray doctorate degree for having acquired fresh laurels as an artist while a resident of Maine -an achievement which brought a glcw of pride to the cheeks of the\n\ncitizens of Maine. Cherished college ties had attracted other Bow~ doin luminaries to this alumm festive board.\n\nAll eyes were 08 Cadwallader\n\nWashburn. who is a polished dip-\n\nlomat for the cause of deafdom.\n\ndelighted all his companions with\n\nhis keen wit and his wide knowledge of men and of world affairs derived from extensive reading and global travels. Cadwallader made all marvel at the manner in which he conducted his conversation via pad and pen-something which he had no need to blush over. It was a right royal lesson to the assembled savants that lack of powers of speech and serviceable lipreading do not necessarily ostracize the deaf from society as propagandized by rabid oralists. Bowdoinites observed that Cadwallader was stone deaf but that he had been helped to superior education by the combined system. They s'!w in the example of this diginified adopted son of Maine that lip-reading-like music-was an art mastered by few. They understood why someone with a scientific turn of mind like Cadwallader spurned 1ip-reacl,ing 'which was n~thing more than educated guesswork fraught with perils of missunderstandings and unhappy human relaionships. Because Cadwallader t!Jok his d,eafn~ss gracefully he won many friends by his genial personality and exuding optimism. It was a supremely happy occasion for the snow-haired artist who all his life symbolized deafness as a mere inconvenience- a\n\nspur to greatness 1D his chosen\n\ncalling.\n\nNo sooner was the happy Bow-\n\ndoin experience laid away in his\n\ntreasury of memories than a new\n\none took shape on the campus of\n\nCadwallader's alma mater--Gal-\n\nlaudet College. Only two weeks\n\nseparated the double events.\n\nCadwallader's forefathers gave tremendous lift to the constantly worried Lincoln and it was Lincoln who signed the charter which enabled Cadwallader to spend five profitable. cultural years at the only college for the deaf in the world. How strange the threads of destiny run! Cadwallader returned to the scene of his undergraduate days after an absence of 30 busy years to revel in the 20th alumni reunion last June.\n\nThe speech which Cadwallader made--short, sweet and in piring- rendered in graceful sign language which he had rarely used in his 30 years of global wander'ings--shook the rafters of the Chapel Hall-also known as the Gallery of Heros where Cadwallader's choicest pictures hang. He had brought his latest masterpieces which were specially propped up on the platform hallowed by the immortal Gallaudets and legendary figures of Kendall Green. Cadwallader was one of the few surviving members of the Old Guard photographed and featured in the deaf press. It was a grailid homecomin'g for Gallauder's Grand Old Man who was an honorary guest of President\n\nTHE SCHOOL HELPER\n\nNovember, 1947\n\nElstad in No.1. house on Faculty Row.\n\nCanadians will always remember the Washburn Collection at the Toronto Art Gallery, happily included with the diamond jubilee convention of the Ontario Associahion of the Deaf in July, 1946. But if Cadwallader took Toronto by storm how much more was the staid old Boston stirred he same autumn when he exhibited a new batch of paintings in oil and etch ings a the Robert C. Vose Galleries. Robert P. Bellany, a well-known art collector of the Union of Bo stan, wrote: \"I have gone 0 the Voses and what a brave arry of Cadwallader Washburns.\"\n\nCharles Hovey Pepper, listed in \"Who's Who in America,\" an art connisseur of long standing, who authored a book on Japanese Prints, exclaimed in still an other flock of admiring letters:\n\n\"I went yesterday and had a grand time. 1 think your show is tops. You can paint and you can etch. 1 think it one of the best shows Boston has had this year. Congratulations. \"\n\nAnother visitor to the gallery got lit up and effused: \"I enjoyed seeing your fine paintings. 1 like \"The Man With The Green Shawl, \"also\" Boothbay Harbor,\" \"The Farmhouse,\" all are exellent. But your etchings are superb. You are a mastercomparable to the old masters. You are a great man and a gifted artist.

Such favors are bestowed upon a very precious few, and you are among the chosen few. This must have brought you a great deal of happiness.\"\n\nEW \"LANGU GE\" IS INVENTED FOR THE DEAF\n\nFrom OHIO CHRONICLE\n\nThe following article, clipped from an Akron newspaper and sent in by Walter Krohngold, would be humorous if it were not so tragic.\n\nEngland has, for many years, outlawed the use of the sign language in the education of the deaf.\n\nThe system has been held up to us as a model, and only a year or two ago we had rapt audiences listening to an exposition of the \"British\" system of education. which is actually as old as the pyramids, and not something new, as the rediscoverers would have us believe.\n\nWhile this system may succeed in giving the British deaf an education, perusal of British publications, mostly for and seldom by the deaf. make it evident that most adult deaf citizens are little better than the wards of benevolent and charitable societies. The variety of occupations they are allowed to perform is limited not so much by their ability as by what it is felt by people, themselves not deaf, they can best do and at the same time perpetuate the hold over them and their ways of life by the benevolent societies.\n\nOnce a system is well established. it is only a question of time before someone will seek to attack it and to tear it down.\n\nAnyone who has done a little research in the field the educatio~ of the deaf knows that pure oral instruction is not new. There are recorded cases of the success of the method with talented individuals going back to the time of the Pharaohs. The fact remains that the first successful permanent school made use of the sign language as well as the oral method. thus taking into account the individual d~fereince of the pupils.\n\nowhere other than in the United States (where free interchange of information a man g different schools throughout the country by mean of our school publications. our teacher association, and our\n\national College, Gallaudet, has shown us the wisdom of not adhering to a single approach to all pupils but rather of adapting the method to the needs of the child) have the adult deaf approached the independent. self sufficient statu ~ of complete unhampered citizen\"hip and civic responsibility we find here today.\n\nMuch credit for placing the deaf in this enlightened position must go to the utilization of the\n\n(2)\n\nsign language. Although there were a number of isolated successful attempts to teach the deaf orally and a number of school, were established to live out a brief and unsuccessful span, most of these successful attempts were with individuals, rather than with groups. Even today. while we have a number of really good pure oral schools. the most successful of these have what may be t,ermed a ,selected group of pupils. We know of no instance where such a school has shown exceptional success with an unseleceted group. Usually those who show liittle aptitude for oral instruction are either branded as unintelligent or. if the school in question is more enlighten~d, transferred to a combined school where they may have the benefit of varied approaches to their understanding.\n\nTo go back to the article below. there is little doubt but what the new \"discovery\" will set up a new school of thought in the education of the deaf in England. Attempts will be made to show that the \"new\" method will succeed where the \"old\" method has failed.\n\nThose disappointed in progress of children by the pure oral method will flock to this marvelous new discovery-the sign language. Pupils will be put on exhibition, visitors will \"oh\" and \"ah\" at the progress being made. Those of us who have been through the mill, have seen the products of all types of schools and all systems of education of the deaf will have the feeling. \"This is where I came in.\" All right, London, take it away.

Baker made the extra point and we were in the lead with a 13 - 0 margin.\n\nLate in the second quarter another Trion punt was blocked and recovered on their 16. The Jays again took to the air and a pass from Baker to White put the ball on the four. Two running plays were tried for no gain, then. Baker ran wide to the right and tossed to White in the end zone. White made a beautiful diving catch and the whistle at half found the score\n\n19 to O. In the third quarter.

It is very essential that every boy and girl live in the widest possible sense, both mental-\n\nly and physically.\n\nEven though we are the baby class, we are no longer babies. We must learn gradually that we are one of a group, and that each has to take his turn as it comes. We are taught to take only one piece of candy or one cookie instead of as many as we want; to take our place in line and to wait our tum in leading.\n\nWe have the most fun when the period comes around for blowing pinwheels, feathers, pompons, and bubbles, and for using the vibratube. Of course, everyone cannot do these things at one time, and this period gives another op portunity to practice taking turns cheerfully.\n\nAll the things we learn to do in our classroom that help us to adjust ourselves in working and playing together also help us in living together in the dormitory and on the playground. When we get along well with others, we are happy, and when we are happy. we can do better school work. We feel that the time spent on socializing the children is well spent.\n\n-Miriam Minter's Class\n\non which we play in the dormi-\n\ntory.\n\nThose spaces also help us to\n\nknow when something special is\n\ngoing to happen.

Since we have done so well in remembering these long names, probably you would like to know what they are.\n\nThere are ten of us, four girls and six boys. Our names are Patricia Edwards. Betty Ruth Baxley. Stella Mae Gaxaway, Mary 1\\lice Jon'es, Bobby Posey, Larry Thompson, Wilburn Dukes. Terrell Leverette, Gene Dominy, and Roy Alexander.\n\nOctober was a busy month for us. We had the Hallowe'en party in the playrooms and were invited to the carnival in the basement of Freeman Hall.\n\nWe enjoyed playing \"Going to Jerusalem\" and other festive games and especially bobbing for apples.\n\nMany of us got horns, masks, hats, and candy from home. Those who did not receive Hallowe'en things from home made hats and mash; however, those who did, shared them with their friends.\n\nThe carnival was most enjoyable. The witch greeted us, and we went first to the country store where hot dogs, Glndy. gum. cookies and ice cream were sold. Some of us fished, while others pitched pennies for prizes or played with the ball and pens. Gene Dominy won a prize pitching pennies.\n\nIt was such a pretty day to be outside that we went for a nice walk after the carnival.\n\nWe are looking forward to the Thanksgiving holidays now.\n\n-Bettye Arnold's Class\n\n***\n\nWe have had so much fun and excitement over our Hallowe'en carnival that it is hard to settle down especially, when we now have Thanksgiving to look forward to and so many of us are planning to spend the week-end at home.\n\nThanksgiving means more to us since we are older and are beginning to realize and talk about the many things that we have to be thankful for.\n\nWe can find in our Bibles several verses pertaining to Thanksgiving. One is Psalms\n\na 118 1- give thanks unto the\n\nLord; for He is good. With our hearts full of Thanks-\n\ngiving. we would like to say: My heart is truly thankful Lord. For homes, fer friend', for love\n\nthat's true, For great, wide, beautiful fields,\n\nand skies; But most of all -for You.\n\n- Jessie F. Jones's Class\n\nIn addition to the special events such as birthday parties. Hallowe'en festivities and the great expectation of the Than sgiving holidays. our Elson-Gray readers afford us much daily pleasure. The pirttlrp' a r? ~o co J ~r' ful and true to life that it i ard to resist turning through the page~ to enjoy their beauty.\n\nThe story that we read today was Fun with Little Quack. Everyone in our cI ~o foJlow~ the events in the life of Dick and Jane with a great deal of interest. Yesterday's story was about their trip to the farm where their grandparents live. Their grand father gaove them a duck and today's. story is about the little duck.\n\nEveryone la ghed to see the picture of Little Quack swimming in the puddle of water af e the rain. Someone mentioned having seen the ducks swimming on the la e at the spring which was a nice beginning for a nature study lesson. The first thing we did was to find ducks in our book on animals then to write the information on the blackboard. Acros the page from the picture of a pretty yeIlow duck was the following:\n\nI am a small fowl. I have a big bill. I have two webbed feet. I like bugs and fish. I like corn and grass,too. I can swim. I can fly a little.\n\nOn completing these lessons we have some new verbs and adJectives to add to our vocabularv booRs. We will not soon forget these new things we have learned for Friday morning we shall walk by the spring to see the ducks and renew our lesson.\n\n- Geverna Chapman's Class\n\n(5)\n\nIf all parents realized how very much pleasure and happiness each letter from home brings. I feel sure there would be more mail arriving daily for our children.\n\nThe mail reaches our department during the recess period. As the children come in from recess, each one is excited over the prospect of getting a letter, a card, or a box and immediately deluges the teacher with questions, \"Have I a box?\" \"Have ~ 1 card~' or \"Have I a letter?\" until he satisfies him elf as to whether or not any mail is in store for him.\n\nIn our class, most of the children hear regularly from home. elarene King and Carol Smith receive some sort of m\"il every few days, and Alvin White gets a box almost every week; but. there are some few who don't hear from home very often.\n\n-Polly Casey's Class\n\nOur class made a small jack-o'lantern for the Hallow,,' en pilrty.\n\nKatie Mae washed the pumpkin and Betty dried it. Then Andrew Lee carefully cut out the top. Louise and Marcus undertook the unpleasant task of cleaning the in -ide. When Brooks and Wili is Joe had \"opened\" the little fellow's eyes. Wayne fashioned his nose. To Mary Ann and Daniel, however, \"Jack\" owes most of his charm of\n\nexpression, for it was th y who gave him four teeth and a cheerful lift to the corners of his mouth. With the aid of a lighted candle. Jean gave him the final touch that made him a Iiving personality.\n\n- Viola McMichen's Class\n\n***\n\nWe are learning abotH some famous paintings in our reading class now. We find them very in-\n\nteresting and attractive. The first one that we have\n\ntaken up is Baby Stuart. painted by Van Dyck. We have learned that Baby Stuart lived in England long ago. His father was a king, and his mother was a queen. He has on a pretty blue dress in the painting and a dainty white lace cap. We learned that all baby boys wore long dresses like that long ago. Baby Stuart was a very\n\n(Continued on page nine)\n\nTHE SCHOOL HELPER\n\nNouember. 1947\n\nTHE SCHOOL HELPER\n\nAll communications should be addrelllled ~o the\n\nSchool Helper, Cave Spring, Georgia.\n\na.

Additions were made, a third story added. and finally, some of these additions torn down to make way for the new girls' dormitory.

I arrived mid-morning.\n\nAs usuaL I\n\nThe ConlJention, checked both\n\nTravel to and the county\n\nfrom-Can't\n\nand city wel-\n\nfare agencies\n\nto see if they had any information\n\non children whose applications I\n\nhad in hand, or others not pre-\n\nviously reported whom I should see\n\nwhile in that town. I do this for\n\ntwo main reasons: (1) to acquaint\n\nthem with school and service the\n\nschool is rendering: and (2) to fa-\n\nmiliarize those offices with pupils\n\nwe have from their city and county\n\nfor future reference when there is\n\nneed for help with indigent cases.\n\nThe welfare offices could not\n\noffer much assi~tance, neirl-,er did\n\nt hey know we had several deaf\n\nboys and girls from Columbus al-\n\nready in school.\n\nThen I called the old reliable,\n\nMer. S. P. Wright. You will re\n\ncall I told you in my last letter\n\nabout how Mrs. Wright was a\n\nreal missionary to the deaf in Co-\n\nlumbus. Anyway, Mrs. Wright's\n\nmaid told me she was at the church\n\nthat morning and gave me the tele-\n\nphone number. It did not take\n\nmore than a minute or two to get\n\nthink I asked her but have forgat-\n\nher on the 'phone. I don't know\n\nwhat she was doing at the church\n\nthis week-day mid-morning. I\n\nten. Anyway, she stopped right\n\naway and was over to the Welfare\n\nOffice in a jiffy. She insisted that\n\nI leave my car and get in hers. I\n\nhad the addresses of these children\n\nbut without Mrs. Wright's help\n\nI would have been in Columbus\n\nall day finding them. It was just\n\na matter of a few minutes before\n\nwe were interviewing Mrs. H. C.\n\nDaniel and her little son, Henry\n\nCurtis Daniel. \"Bubba\" proved to\n\nbe a fine little fellow, bright,\n\nhealthy, deaf, and in every respect\n\neligible for admission to the Geor-\n\ngia School for the Deaf. Mrs. Daniel seemed to be deeply appreciative of the opportunity offered her son. I know she will make a cooperative patron and that her little son will prove to be a fine little pupil.\n\nFrom Mrs. Daniel's home we IJeaded for 1036 Nineteenth St. Little John Wesley Reid was at home and so was his father, Mr. E. C. Reid. This was another fine little deaf boy for whom we did our best to sell the parents on the idea of sending him to school in September. I say \"sell the idea\" because these parents seemed to be a little reluctant to send their child so far away from home at five years of age. It was just the reverse in the case of Betty Bruner whose sister is already in school. Mr. and Mrs. Bruner were very much in favor of sending Margene's younger sister whom we had to reject on account of the fact that she was not quite four and one-half years of age;\n\nThey all knew Mrs. Wright and seemed to appreciate her great interest.\n\nI insisted on Mrs. Wright ha ...ing lunch with me in down town Columbus. I enjoyed this additional visit with her. There won't be any complications like the time while at Gallaudet I wrote you how nice Miss Elizabeth Peet had been to me. You will recall Wright saying, \"Mother. T don't bel ieve Miss Peet is as old as Daddy makes like she is.\"\n\nEarly after noon I headed out for Albany, Georgia. The highway skirted the fine little city of Americus. I stopped at the highway 'unction and called Marjorie Joyner's home but there was no answer. I felt like writing a little note as she did to me one time saying, \"why don't you stay home some time?'\" (For the benefit of other readers. T will say that w\" came to know Marjorie through the medium of our pastor and his wife. Dr. and Mr . Grant who live on the Shorter College Campus. They often brought some o( the girls down to services at Cave\n\n(7)\n\nSpring. In this they were ably abetted by our young Marine son who was on leave for a few weeks in the late spring before proceeding on orders to China. Wright always was a great hand to bring his dates down to see the \"old folks.\" We all became very fond of Marjorie. She is now Assistant Director of the Voluntary Religious Association at the U niverity of Georgia)\n\nThe story of my arrival and fine experience in Albany was related to you in my last letter. From there I proceeded early to Camilla. I had known Mrs. Bertha Jones, Director of Public Welfare, since away back when she was a case worker. It was fine seeing her and her staff housed in Mitchell County's beautiful new court house; one of the most beautiful in the state.
