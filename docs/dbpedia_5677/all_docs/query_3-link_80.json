        "text": "As a pastor who also is a songwriter, I have always been intrigued by the role music plays in scripture. There are nearly 200 songs found in the Bible.\n\nThe first song that appears is the Song of Moses in Exodus 15. Moses and the Israelites immediately burst into singing upon their safe journey across the Red Sea. In a genuine moment of celebration, Moses recounts the Lord’s mighty deeds in delivering his people from the hand of Pharaoh and his army.\n\n“The Lord is my strength and my defense; He has become my salvation. … In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed.” Exodus 15:2,13 (NIV)\n\nThe Israelites had been rescued from slavery in spectacular fashion. From the 10 plagues to the parting of the Red Sea, they had personally witnessed God’s signs and wonders. When the waters settled and Egypt was forever behind them, how could they not sing a song of praise and thanksgiving? Their song told the story of what God had done for them.\n\nIsraelite worship would forever retell that wonderful story of redemption. There are many key moments throughout the Old Testament that are punctuated by songs of praise in response to God’s saving actions on behalf of his people.\n\nSalvation is the fulfillment of the Exodus story\n\nHowever, everything about this redemptive story was always pointing to Jesus. Through his life, death and resurrection, a new exodus is now offered. Salvation in Christ is the fulfillment of what the Exodus story pictured for God’s people. When we trust in Jesus as Savior, he takes us out of the bondage of sin. When the enemy pursues us and death seems inevitable, Jesus rescues us. He leads us across the sea to a place where we can sing a song of redemption to him.\n\nAs it turns out, the Song of Moses also is the last song mentioned in the Bible. In Revelation 15, John sees the Christians who are victorious over the beast singing a new version of the song of Moses (also called the Song of the Lamb.) Now it is the Lamb leading God’s people in triumph, but the message is the same: God has conquered the enemy, and he deserves praise.\n\n“Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the nations. Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.” Revelation 15:3-4 (NIV)\n\nHow can we not sing a new song to the Lord in response to all he has done? After Moses sang his song in Exodus 15, Miriam led the women in a refrain, which inspired me to write this chorus in conclusion:\n\n“Take up your timbrels and sing. Dance on the shore of the sea. All that held us captive is swallowed up in vict’ry. Sing the song of the redeemed.”\n\nDave Langdon is pastor of Ashland Church of the Nazarene"
