        "text": "After a year without live music, Logan Lee and The U-Pang Band came to play at The Salty Snapper on Sept. 9.\n\nLogan Lee has been performing professionally since the 2010s. Originally from Ottawa, Illinois, he now resides in Jefferson, Georgia.\n\nWhile he has been singing most of his life, it wasn’t until after he tore his ACL and became temporarily bed-ridden, that he found a love in playing guitar.\n\nMost of his musical influence comes from Elvis. Lee came up with his own way to describe his style: The sweet lyrics and style of Country with just a touch of rock.\n\nDuring the Sept. 9 show, he gave exactly that.\n\nHe started his set with some popular country songs: “Starting Over” by Chris Stapelton, “Forever After All” by Luke Combs and “Fishing In The Dark” by The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\n\nAs the performance went on, Lee continued to present his musical style with a wide range of songs, including his own renditions of “Halo” by Beyonce and “Faith” by George Michael. While these are popular songs, Lee put his own unique “country-fried twist” on them.\n\nHis energy was immaculate, making the crowd sing and clap with every new song. He knew how to put on a performance without having to even stand up.\n\nAfter the performance, members of the crowd shared how impressed they were with Lee’s performance. One local man in attendance said he loved that Lee played both songs he knew and didn’t know, yet he was still able to enjoy them\n\n“It was an extremely fun night,” said a woman who watched the performance. “There was music for everyone—it made you want to sing and dance, and the atmosphere was fun.”\n\nI recommend going and seeing him live, but until you can do that, you can find his music on Soundcloud, @U-pang Band and Instagram, @upangband.\n\nFor more information including performance dates, merchandise and a biography, visit the band’s website at www.upangmusic.com/.\n\nWritten by Evie Webb, staff reporter.
