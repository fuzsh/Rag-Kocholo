        "text": "about\n\nWhen Curb Records recording artist, Lee Brice, isn't selling out arenas, writing and recording songs, or building new brands like American Born whiskey, you'll find the family man with his wife Sara, two young boys, and daughter. Meanwhile, with over 3 billion on-demand streams, and over 3.6 billion spins on Pandora, Brice continues to enjoy massive success at country radio, digital streaming services, and on the road. He recently reached #1 at Country Radio with âMemory I Donât Mess With,â which consecutively follows three prior #1s: ASCAPâs 2021 Country Song of the Year âOne of Them Girls,â âI Hope Youâre Happy Nowâ with Carly Pearce, and âRumor,â which was nominated in the category Single of The Year at the 55th Annual ACM Awards. One of the most-played country artists of all time on Pandora, he was the second country artist behind Keith Urban to receive the Pandora Billionaire plaque. Lee is also a GRAMMY nominee, a CMA and ACM award winner, and he's taken nine radio singles to Number One: \"A Woman Like You,\" \"Hard to Love,\" \"I Drive Your Truck,\" \"I Donât Dance,\" \"Drinking Class,\" âRumor,\" âI Hope Youâre Happy Now,\" âOne of Them Girls,â and âMemory I Donât Mess With.â Garth Brooks, Jason Aldean, Kenny Chesney and others have recorded his songs, and he's performed on numerous TV shows, including NBC's Today, ABC's The Bachelor, NBC's The Voice and FOX's Miss USA 2018. Lee performed as part of the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song honoring Garth Brooks, aired on PBS March of 2020. At the 54th Annual CMA Awards, Lee took home the prize for Musical Event of the Year for his song with Carly Pearce, \"I Hope You're Happy Now.\" At the 56th ACM Awards, âI Hope Youâre Happy Nowâ won Single of the Year and Music Event of the Year, and Lee and Carly Pearce performed the song live.
