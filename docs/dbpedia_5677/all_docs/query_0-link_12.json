        "text": "If you’re a fan of the current or recent offerings from NewSong you might be surprised by this album. This was their first album but it wasn’t on a label. Instead they actually self released it. It is almost all covers so there is no way a record company would have even touched it. The band was founded at Morningside Baptist Church in Valdosta, Georgia and I am guessing they never knew what they would become. Like I said this album is almost entirely covers and it is rather obvious they were going for that Imperials sound and feel. This album is a bit of a contrast from their later stuff but it’s nice to hear where it all started for them.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – I Will Glory In The Cross – 3:46\n\n2 – Oh Buddah – 3:05\n\n3 – Something Right – 2:18\n\n4 – God’s Way – 3:41\n\n5 – Swing Low/Swing Down Chariot – 2:41\n\n6 – Rise Again – 3:28\n\n7 – Questions – 3:26\n\n8 – You Are My Everything – 3:18\n\n9 – No Shortage – 3:10\n\n10 – Your First Day In Heaven – 1:24"
