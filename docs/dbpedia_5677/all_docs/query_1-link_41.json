Thank you for recording again. Cathie Savage\n\nSo enjoying \"Charity\" from a long forgotten time [Paga album]. It brings it all back to the foreground. Thank you and may God continue to bless you. Bob Moore\n\nMeditating on Romans 8:26-28 this morning made me think of your song that says, \"The Spirit gives groanings too deep for words. So here I am take now,\" and I am taken back to a time in my little Honda Civic in 1985 praying for a friend falling away. I was listening to this song on the road down 99W in Oregon, and God's Spirit took over in praying for her. Thank you.\n\nHi Kelly! I remember you from 1977, when you came to my parents' home in Garden Grove, CA and worshiped with our youth Bible study group. What a blessing! You have such a sweet spirit. God bless you to overflowing for your devotion to Him and His purpose.\n\nThank you. Cheryl"
