The song is called, “Nothing New (I Do).” If that sounds familiar, he had a song on his latest album called, “Nothing New,” but he and Brittany change up a few of the lyrics and made it a wedding song since they are celebrating their 13th wedding anniversary.\n\nNot only did they change the lyrics but they went back to the chapel they got married in to do it.\n\nBut here is something else that is cool…Brandon even got Brittany to star in the music video with him and sing the background vocals!\n\nCheck out the full video!"
