        "text": "Days after teasing a new song release, Eminem has dropped the next track from his forthcoming album — this time with assists from fellow Michigan rappers BabyTron and Big Sean.\n\n“Tobey,” the second single from Eminem’s upcoming “The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce),” arrived at noon Tuesday, a day after the Detroit rapper revealed the album’s July 12 release date. The new song follows the May release of “Houdini,” which clocked in at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 to become Eminem’s best chart performance in more than a decade.\n\nOver a tick-tocking instrumental whose simmering urgency never quite gets relieved with a beat drop, the four-minute “Tobey” launches with verses from BabyTron and Big Sean before getting handed over to Eminem.\n\nWarning: explicit lyrics.\n\nThe new song’s title is a nod to “Spider-Man” actor Tobey Maguire, who’s also referenced throughout the lyrics, while the cover art pays homage to a famed double-identity Spider-Man meme plucked from a ’60s cartoon.\n\nMore: 'Detroit, we love you': Eminem caps memorable night at Michigan Central Station\n\nAt one point, Eminem references last year’s beef with hip-hop trailblazer Melle Mel, who questioned the Detroit star’s status as one of history’s top rappers.\n\nThe “Tobey” music video, directed by Cole Bennett, will be out Friday, Universal Music announced."
