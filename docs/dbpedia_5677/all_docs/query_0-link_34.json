        "text": "\"Elijah Ride(ing) to eternal life\"\n\nUp-and-coming contemporary Christian band Elijah Ride plays a free show Saturday at Kinchafoonee Baptist Church.\n\nby Gary Grimes\n\nMILLWOOD — If you ask the members of Elijah Ride, they'll tell you their group is really a one-man show.\n\nTodd Hall pelts away at the drums during a recent performance. The group will play a free show at 4 p.m. Saturday at Kinchafoonee Baptist Church in Leesburg.\n\nFrom left, accoustic guitarist Brant Pickard and electric guitarist Brian McMillian play in Elijah Ride, which has opened for Audio Adrenaline, Point of Grace, NewSong, Kutless and Jars of Clay.\n\n\"Dear Lord, be our hands, be our feet ...\" rhythm guitarist Brant Pickard prays before kicking off of a youth revival at a rural church in Millwood, a stop in the road near Waycross. \"Let them not see us out there, but let them see you.\"\n\nA free Jam for Jesus, which starts at 4 p.m. Saturday, hosts Elijah Ride along with Leesburg band Riverdale at Kinchafoonee Baptist Church, 219 Century Road in Leesburg.\n\nThe seven guys have conviction; it shows their lives are reserved for Jesus Christ.\n\nTheir backgrounds reflect the diversity of everyman; one is a doctor, another a diesel mechanic and another a restaurant busboy. Likewise, their hometowns are spread across south Georgia. But with frequent shows, their message is spreading even further.\n\n\"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven,\" 2 Kings 2:11 states.\n\n\"Where Elijah never experienced physical death, he went up in a chariot of fire,\" explains vocalist Todd Trebony. \"That's kind of where (the name) 'Elijah Ride' came from.\"\n\nThe band, however, came together through open auditions set up by Nick Mclellan of Tifton's AfterHours Productions, which was looking to find \"the group of the area.\"\n\nVocalist Scott Morey jokingly compared the unlikely meeting to a car crash.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" keyboardist Andrew Wilkes says. \"We just all kind of clicked.\"\n\nNow, the band is a year and a half old, and its already opened for the big hitters in contemporary Christian music such as Audio Adrenaline, Point of Grace, NewSong, Kutless and Jars of Clay.\n\n\"I think they're comparable in every way to NewSong (which also formed in south Georgia)\" Pastor Keith Floyd said outside his Zion Hill Freewill Baptist Church.\n\nIf it wasn't obviously a church, you'd never know a Christian concert was playing inside the building. From outside, it sounded like typical heavy drumming, whining guitar, rhythm, bass and keyboards. Along with two lead vocalists, it's otherwise known as the perfect model for a rock 'n' roll band.\n\nBut it's inside, of course, where the band wants you to be and where the lyrics let you know this band is different; it has a Christian message. But don't think they sacrifice the rock.\n\n\"Their lyrics are powerful, too,\" the pastor said.\n\n\"Be Free\" begins a slow love song from Jesus to his people, but it soon turns to a vivid testimony. A \"praise pit\" forms in the church sanctuary.\n\n\"I put my faith in the man who rose from the dead, who bled from the crown of thorns on his head. ... I will not hide my God from your eyes. This is my life, this is not a disguise. ...\"\n\nAnd such is life for Elijah Ride.\n\nFor information about the band, visit www.elijahride.com.\n\n- Copyright © 2004-2005 The Albany Herald Publishing Company, Inc.

In fact “Crashing Down,” the opener here, sounds a whole lot like Jars Of Clay’s “Flood,” and even matches that hit song's intensity.\n\nEach CD track contains a spiritual message, with “Levitate” rising to the top of the bunch. This single-worded work puts the topic of going to heaven in a whole new, heightened mystical perspective. Other notable selections include “Never Be the Same,” which is a quiet worshipful song that might just remind you of Prince’s “Purple Rain.” The overall mood of this recording is mostly quietly intense, although “Be Free” closes the proceedings with a gutsy lead vocal, along with a big rock guitar solo. The only song that comes up a tad short is titled “Where Were You.” This one takes a slightly pushy approach to dealing with the opinions of non-believers.\n\nThis is a fine release because of its strong songwriting and tight vocals -- the group's two best qualities. Elijah Ride, in the end, is one memorable musical trip.\n\n- Don McIntosh, Indie-Music.com\n\n\"National Review-Elijah Ride, 2/4/06.\"\n\nArtist: Elijah Ride\n\nCD: Self-Titled\n\nHome: South Georgia\n\nStyle: Christian Pop/Gospel\n\nQuote: \"Elijah Ride, in the end, is one memorable musical trip.\"\n\nBy Dan MacIntosh\n\nElijah Ride makes explicitly Christian music, which may appeal to fans of Jars Of Clay and Caedmon’s Call.

Elijah Ride appears to be one of those bands destined for greater things and a long career.\n\nThe band released their self-titled, independent CD in April after\n\nmonths of anticipation from area fans. For those who waited and\n\nwaited and waited for it to finally come out, they were not\n\ndisappointed.\n\nThis CD features 10 songs written by the Elijah Ride's own\n\nsongwriters, keyboardist Andrew Wilkes and acoustic guitarist Brant\n\nPickard. The songs cover a variety of styles and topics, but they\n\nall have one thing in common: pointing the listener in praise to\n\nGod.\n\nWhether the listener is a fan of rock, slower acoustic jams or\n\nworship music, they will not be disappointed with \"Elijah Ride.\"\n\nWhile the band calls themselves a worship rock band, they can also\n\nplay the slow, melodic songs as well.\n\n\"Elijah Ride\" starts off with a slow piano intro before breaking\n\nout into a heavy guitar riff and pounding drums on the song\n\n\"Crashing Down.\" Elijah Ride mixes the two almost incompatible\n\nelements of growling guitars and piano solos as well as any other\n\nband.\n\nVocalists Scott Morey and Todd Trebony compliment each other\n\nthroughout the CD. The mix of acoustic guitars from Pickard and\n\nelectric guitar riffs courtesy of Brian McMillan flow almost effortlessly from song to song. Keyboard and piano tracks by Wilkes, bass from Lee Taylor and the drums of Todd Hall complete the package\n\nof Elijah Ride and their music.\n\nMost CD's on the market have one or two standout tracks, but every\n\nsong on \"Elijah Ride\" stands out apart from each other. These 10\n\nsongs can release a wide gamut of emotions, whether it be full-out,\n\nhands-raised praise to God to introspective reflection, but the CD\n\nwill take the listener on a ride to lift up the name of the Lord.\n\nWhether it be a few weeks or a few years down the road, fans of\n\ngood, quality music with a message need to pay attention to Elijah Ride. If their very 1st CD is an indication, this band is on course to accomplish great things for the Kingdom of God.\n\n- J.Oxford--The Observer.\n\n\"CD Review: Elijah Ride, (self-titled).\"\n\nThere are few bands in music today that have the potential to be\n\naround for a long time and continue to grow in popularity.
