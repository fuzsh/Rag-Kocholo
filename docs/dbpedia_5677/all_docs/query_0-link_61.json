        "text": "Last night Phillip Phillips and his band played an incredibly special show in Valdosta, GA.\n\nGeorgia is Phillip’s home state and many friends and family attended the show, with some even joining him on stage for certain songs. Phillip’s old band mate, Frederick Williams, also joined the bad on sax for the whole show.\n\nBut perhaps the most special moment of the night may have been when Phillip debuted a full new song from his upcoming second album, Behind The Light. The song tells a heartbreaking and intense story of love and torment, very much in the dark vein Phillip has been hinting at when talking about the new album. Musically, the song is heavier as well but as performed last night it still had a delicate guitar arrangement and featured great sax parts and a fantastic trumpet solo. The song was followed by an incredible version of “Where We Came From” which they closed with a brand new, heavier jam. Behind the Light comes out May 19th.\n\nCheck out the new song here! What do you think of “Trigger”? Comment below!\n\nThanks: @whit_georgia | Chuck Robert | Kelsey\n\nI had the pleasure of interviewing Frederick Williams, the ‘sax man’, he played with Phillip in the studio the past few days.
