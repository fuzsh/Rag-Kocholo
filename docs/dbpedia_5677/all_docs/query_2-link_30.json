        "text": "Introduction to Valdosta, Georgia\n\nValdosta, Georgia, in Lowndes county, is 65 miles NE of Tallahassee, Florida and 102 miles W of Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nValdosta History\n\nTroupville, the original settlement from which Valdosta was created, was once a steamboat landing on the Withlacoochee River. It was named after Governor George M. Troup. However, when the Gulf and Atlantic Railroad was constructed four miles away, the residents of Troupville simply moved the town closer to the railroad. This resulted in the creation of Valdosta. The city was officially incorporated on December 7, 1860. Valdosta was named after Troup's estate which was known as \"Val d'Osta.\"\n\nValdosta and nearby Attractions\n\nLowndes County Historical Society and Museum\n\nCarnegie Library\n\nCherry Lake\n\nCalvary Church\n\nGrand Bay Wildlife Management Area\n\nFairview Historic District\n\nThings To Do In Valdosta\n\nThose interested in the regional history and culture can pay a visit to the Lowndes County Historical Society Museum.
