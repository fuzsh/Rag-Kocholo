        "text": "— Of all the varied musical tours that have attempted to establish an annual following, none have been around as long as Winter Jam, a shifting lineup of Christian rock acts in its 15th year.\n\nIt launched its 2010 itinerary in January and will hit 44 cities by the time it wraps up March 28 in Louisville, Ky.\n\nIn 2009, the Winter Jam ranked among the largest tours in the world, according to attendance figures compiled by concert touring magazine Pollstar. Earlier this year, the Winter Jam received the Gospel Music Association Impact Award, presented to “the nonartist individual or organization that has made the most significant impact on the gospel music industry over the last three years.” The ’09 tour was also voted Concert of the Year by the Gospel Music Channel’s viewers and Best Tour in the CCMmagazine.com Readers’ Choice Awards.\n\n“Our vision has always been to bring together great music, the Gospel message and a low admission price in some of the biggest venues in the country,” says Eddie Carswell, a founding member of NewSong and the creator of Winter Jam. “We want families and youth groups to enjoy a night of top-notch entertainment that serves a greater purpose.”\n\nNewSong, which was founded in Valdosta, Ga., has been making music for 28 years, during which the group has recorded 17 albums, 20 No. 1 singles and been nominated for a Grammy Award. The band’s biggest hit song, “The Christmas Shoes,” “crossed over” to mainstream pop, hitting No. 1 on the adult contemporary chart and inspiring a book and subsequent TV movie.\n\nOn Nov. 24, NewSong released its latest recording, Give Yourself Away, on the band’s new label, His Honor Music. The group also marked the day by celebrating the return of its singer, Russ Lee, who had left the band in 2000.\n\nThird Day has racked up 27 No. 1 singles and won numerous Grammy, Dove and American Music Awards. The band’s latest release, Revelation, is the band’s effort “to capture the complexities of the Christian walk” and features collaborations with Robert Randolph, Chris Daughtry and Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf.\n\nThird Day was recently inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, which prompted this salute from fellow Georgian and comedian Jeff Foxworthy: “You have moved from album to album, never settling to be content with what worked in the past, but pushing each other creatively to new heights. I have often told you that you remind me of U2 in your ability to evolve musically.”\n\nBillboard magazine called the band “not only one of the best Christian bands of the ’90s, but one of the best rock bands, period.”\n\nThe Newsboys, who got their start in Australia, have had 25 No. 1 radio hits, sales of 6 million records and several Dove Awards. In the past year, the band has undergone personnel changes, with guitarist Paul Colman leaving to focus on solo projects, guitarist Jody Davis returning after a five-year hiatus, Peter Furler moving back into a supporting role as a songwriter and Michael Tait, formerly of dc Talk, taking over as the new lead singer.\n\nThe group announced that Born Again, their first album with Tait as lead singer, will be released June 8.\n\nTenth Avenue North, which takes its name from a major east-west route in its home area, Palm Beach County, Fla., won the 2009 Gospel Music Association Dove Award for New Artist of the Year. The group’s next album, The Light Meets the Dark, will come out May 11. The first single from the album, “Healing Begins,” was released March 2.\n\nFireflight, a band led by singer Dawn Michele, was formed in Eustis, Fla., in 1999. The band released its latest album, For Those Who Wait, on Feb. 9.\n\nTony Nolan, a tour pastor for various Christian artists, uses humor in his talks and has experienced more than 100,000 public expressions of faith in Christ.\n\nWinter Jam 2010 7 p.m. (doors open at 6) Friday, Verizon Arena, North Little Rock Artists: NewSong, Third Day, Newsboys, Tenth Avenue North, Fireflight, Tony Nolan “Pre-jam party”: Sidewalk Prophets, Robert Pierre, Revive, Mikeschair Admission: $10 general admission (door only) (501) 975-9000"
