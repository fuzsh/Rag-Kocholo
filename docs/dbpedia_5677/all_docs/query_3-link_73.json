        "text": "Celine Dion shocked the world in late 2022 when she canceled all of her live performances, citing her diagnosis with stiff-person syndrome, which has seemingly led to her retirement from the stage. As her hiatus continues, the superstar earns a new hit in America–and it’s something of a first for the signer.\n\nOn this week’s Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales chart, Dion debuts her new song “Set My Heart On Fire (I'm Alive x And The Beat Goes On).” The track, which also credits Majestic and The Jammin Kid, opens at No. 5.\n\nThe tune marks Dion’s first appearance on the ranking of the bestselling dance and electronic tunes in the U.S. She wasn’t known for her dancefloor fillers during her recording career, so it’s not entirely shocking that she’s just landing on this tally now. However, the fact that she’s earned a new hit–and a new top 10, at that–after stating she will likely never sing again is certainly encouraging for the powerhouse vocalist.\n\n“Set My Heart On Fire” does not feature new vocals from Dion, but she’s credited nonetheless. The track is essentially a mash-up of her single “I’m Alive” and The Whispers' song \"And the Beat Goes On,\" which was released in the late ‘70s. The mixing and producing were done by the two musicians named alongside Dion, and the three collect a smash together.\n\nDion and company earn the second-loftiest debut on this week’s Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales chart, coming in behind only Marshmello and Kane Brown’s “Miles On It,” which starts at No. 1.\n\nCoincidentally, Dion is not the only musical legend who earns a hit on the dance sales list this week thanks to older material. Jennifer Lopez manages a similar move with her new single, “Waiting for Tonight.” Dance producer Fisher reworked her early smash, keeping the title, but changing the sound. That cut launches at No. 13 this week on the same tally.\n\n“Set My Heart On Fire” may mark Dion’s first appearance on the Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales ranking, but this week is not the first time that the Canadian favorite has placed on any of Billboard’s dance and electronic-focused tallies. She’s already collected three No. 1s on the Dance Club Songs list, which usually features many popular tunes that have been remixed and become smashes as DJs play them in clubs."
