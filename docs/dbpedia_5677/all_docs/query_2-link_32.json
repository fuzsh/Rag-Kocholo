        "text": "I started attending Valdosta State University in the Fall of 2020. I have enjoyed my experience these past few years. One of my favorite things is the student engagement on campus. We have an organization called CAB or Campus Activities Board. Every month, they sponsor events like Bingo, Make a stuffed animal, and even had a food truck come to the school and serve students. When you're at VSU you'll never be bored because there is always stuff to do. I also like how we have many options for food. We have our dining hall, Palms, Chick-fil-A, Moe's, and two Einstein's Bagels. Their American Sign Language program is also amazing. I would like to see more room in some of the popular classes so that more people students can take them. It can be difficult to choose classes sometimes, you have to wake up around 7 AM to register for the courses once your registration date comes. They do course registration days by year classification (Senior, Junior, Sophmore, etc.)"
