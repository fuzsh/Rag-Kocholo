        "text": "Winter Jam — an annual Christian music show featuring 10 bands — is coming to Wells Fargo Arena on Friday, Jan. 27 at 7 p.m.\n\nAs at all of the about 50 cities on the tour, tickets are just $10 at the door.\n\n“The admission price doesn’t cover our costs, so we get corporate sponsorships on a national scale to make it work,” said Billy Goodwin, member of the band NewSong, one of the tour’s headlining acts and also Winter Jam’s founding group. “Our goal with the tour isn’t to make a lot of money. Our music is a way to teach and preach about having a relationship with Jesus.”\n\nNewSong formed in 1981 at Morningside Baptist Church in Valdosta, Ga. For the first several years, the band performed their vocals accompanied by background tracks. They performed their first big auditorium show in 1993.\n\n“We rented Greenville Memorial Auditorium in South Carolina and called the show January Jam,” Goodwin said. “We set up our meager sound system and our eight lights. We charged $3 at the door, and if they didn’t have it, they could come in anyway. We were hoping for 1,500 people. But we got 6,500 people and turned away 2,000. It was unbelievable. We were totally not prepared for it.”\n\nThe next year the band added a second city, then two years later they added another Christian artist. The tour eventually became the mega-event Winter Jam, now the biggest Christian music tour in the country with three semis full of gear and 10 bands playing to crowds of 12,000 to 40,000 every night of the tour.\n\nThe tour features top Christian music acts, including:\n\nNewSong, an adult-contemporary Christian group that has received eight Gospel Music Association Dove Award nominations. Crossover hits to Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart have included 2000’s “The Christmas Shoes” and 2004’s “When God Made You.”\n\nBritt Nicole, a Christian pop artist with crossover Mainstream Top 40 hits 2012’s “Gold” and 2013’s “Ready or Not.” Nicole’s album Gold was nominated for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album in 2013.\n\nTenth Avenue North, a Christian pop group that has won several Gospel Music Association Dove Awards including 2009’s New Artist of the Year and 2010’s Song of the Year, “By Your Side.”\n\nAndy Mineo, a Christian hip hop artist with albums including 2009’s Sin is Wack, 2010’s In My City, 2011’s Formerly Known, 2012’s Saturday Morning Car-Tunez, 2013’s Heroes for Sale, and 2014’s Never Land.\n\nColton Dixon, Christian singer/songwriter and 2011 “American Idol” finalist who won the Gospel Music Association Dove Awards Best Rock/Contemporary Album of the year in 2013 and 2015.\n\nThousand Foot Krutch, a Canadian Christian rock band that has won numerous Gospel Music Association Canada Covenant Awards and Gospel Music Association Dove awards.\n\nIn addition to the main show, a Pre-Jam Party features OBB, Sarah Reeves, and Steven Malcolm.\n\nThe evening also includes an appearance from “Duck Dynasty” television star Sadie Robertson, as well as a message from Christian evangelist Tony Nolan."
