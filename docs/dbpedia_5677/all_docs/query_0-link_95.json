        "text": "PALMETTO -- You might already be the kind of person who would go to a festival of Christian contemporary music, a person who resonates with the message and follows the artists in this flourishing genre.\n\nHow would someone who is not particularly familiar with church experience a night devoted to songs about God, testimonies for Jesus, and altar calls?\n\n\"Some people are brought by friends. Some people are searching for something -- they don't really know what it is,\" Michael O'Brien, singer and keyboard player for NewSong, said in a telephone interview from his Nashville home. \"It's really up to God, and what he wants to do with the music . We're open to whatever that may be.\"\n\nSummer Jam 2002, which veteran five-man band NewSong hosts, tonight brings to Palmetto a range of young recording artists.\n\nProbably the hottest of them right now is 17-year-old pop singer Rachael Lampa of Louisville, Colo., who, as a reviewer on Amazon.com writes, \"has vocal expertise so far beyond her years that the novelty of a child prodigy is made new again.\" According to CCM Magazine, considering her in \"Celine Dion and Mariah Carey company is fully justified.\"\n\nO'Brien said the 5-foot- 2-inch singer has \"an amazing voice, and a killer band.\"\n\nThe lineup also includes pop quartet True Vibe; the rock band Tait, founded by Michael Tait of DC Talk; pop trio Brother's Keeper, which originally sang a cappella, but currently is more guitar-driven; and Freddie Collocoa, a Latin pop artist from Miami.\n\nWhen it comes to trends in contemporary Christian music, O'Brien said, he is seeing a lot of acts that are becoming popular, but who are \"keeping their values in the workplace.\"\n\n\"To us, our call has never changed. It's always been giving the gospel through songs, and giving an altar call no matter where we go,\" he said. \"I think the message is not going to suffer because we're just going to do what we've always done.\"\n\nNewSong had a mainstream holiday hit in 2000 with \"The Christmas Shoes,\" the story of a little boy trying to buy shoes for his dying mother, so she could look beautiful in heaven. Now, it's the basis of a new movie -- starring Rob Lowe as an attorney and Kimberly Williams as the boy's mom -- that is scheduled to air on CBS this holiday season. NewSong makes a cameo appearance. \"It's a pretty huge thing,\" O'Brien said. \"They tell us this has never been done before with a Christian song.\"\n\nThe group started in 1981 in Valdosta, Ga., but O'Brien has performed with NewSong for three years. He said that when he was 24 and living in Miami 14 years ago, he nearly overdosed on cocaine. He decided he was tired of following other people and, \"I ran to a church and, basically, surrendered my life to Christ and got my life together,\" O'Brien said.\n\nAt concerts, after the music and the testimonies of the performers, it's the teen-agers in the audience who are most likely to respond spiritually and to come forward when invited to make a commitment to Jesus.\n\n\"I don't know if it's the way the story goes, or if it's the way God works,\" O'Brien said. But he said that he does know that most teens are looking for something they can hold onto.\n\nOn NewSong's Web site, www.newsongonline.org, a fan wrote of struggling with alcohol before going to the Summer Jam performance July 26 in Fayetteville, N.C. \"I had exactly $10 left in my paycheck after bills and I had said if I did not have the money to go I would not go, but if I did I would.\" When the altar call came, the fan wrote, \"I rededicated my life to the servanthood of Christ. I know today as sure as I am alive . I am delivered from alcohol.\"\n\nAlthough the ultimate topic at the music fests is serious -- the state and destination of one's soul -- the overall atmosphere is fun. Still, the songs are chosen, O'Brien said, for somebody who's searching for truth and is open to Christ."
