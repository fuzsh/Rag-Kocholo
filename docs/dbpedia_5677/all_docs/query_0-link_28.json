        "text": "EDDIE MIDDLETON\n\nAlbany and Valdosta, GA\n\nEddie Middleton, from Albany, Georgia had an amazingly versitile singing voice. He could imitate any style of music and sound just like the original artist to include soul music, country music and rock/pop music. One of his first bands was the Seros from Macon, Georgia.\n\nIn 1967 Eddie metriculated at Valdosta State College and immediately met other talented musicians and formed a band. These bands included the Seros, R. C. and the Moonpies, Down Home and others. He later played briefly with King David and the Slaves, a blue eyed soul band from Jesup, Georgia. During a homecoming concert with the Lettermen, the group would pick various members of the audience to sing along with them. As luck would have it, they once picked Eddie. The Lettermen were very impressed with his versatile voice.\n\nDown Home Band at the King of the Road in Valdosta, Ga\n\nFrom Dave Griffin of Waycros, Ga:\n\nI was a 22-year-old kid when Eddie Middleton hired the Waycross, Georgia band, Homegrown, to back him over the next three years on the road across a good portion of southern and midwest America. Changing our name to Down Home with Eddie Middleton, we played everything from Allman Bros., Atlanta Rhythm Section, and Boz Scaggs to Earth, Wind, and Fire, Lou Rawls, and Freddy Fender. Eddie was a consummate showman and I certainly learned a lot watching him night after night. Sadly, Eddie Middleton passed away this afternoon. I know his wife Kathy, their children, grandchildren, and the rest of his family are glad he's not hurting anymore and are rejoicing but a man like Eddie leaves a big hole in this world. I pray that they find the strength to help them through their loss. Rest in peace, my friend, mentor, employer, road brother, and big brother!\n\nR.C. & the Moonpies – The Part Time Party Band\n\nI guess a band called Co-Cola & the P’Nuts would not have had nearly the mystique as that party\n\ntime party band from Valdosta State College in 1968-69. We knew of the band and even had\n\nthree of the members listed in an uncompleted band directory but otherwise R.C. & the Moonpies\n\nwould have fallen into musical obscurity had it not been for my bride Marion who happened to run\n\ninto former Moonpie drummer, Mike Hattaway, just a short time after the book had gone to press.\n\nAfter giving Mike the heybabydays.com address, Mike sent us some info that helped solve a little\n\nof the mystery of what appears to be another band of soulful musicians from deep in the piney\n\nwood.\n\nR.C. & The Moonpies was primarily students at Valdosta State College who were members of\n\nbands back in their hometowns. Most bands played on the weekends during the Heeey Baby\n\nDays but primarily this band played during the week for those college students who got their\n\nstudying done during the day. All their gigs were sellouts! When the weekends came, these\n\nmusicians generally hooked up with regular bands back home for a Friday and Saturday night\n\nperformance before heading back to school.\n\nAccording to drummer, Mike Hattaway, “The band was a true ‘jam’ band and we featured Eddie\n\nMiddleton’s ability to do soul and beach tunes.”\n\nDid the band have food on its mind or food?\n\nOn occasion, the band would use the name, The Luv for Lunch Bunch.\n\nWho made up this band that catered to those with a taste for soul music?\n\nMEMBERS:\n\nMike Hattaway- drummer- a veteran of several Waycross, Georgia bands that included Our Gang,\n\nThe Royals, and The Riot.\n\nBill Pound– From Macon, Bill was one of those Boogie Chillin\n\nPaul Valentine – He didn’t have too far to travel on the weekends to catch up with his hometown\n\nband from Valdosta, The Soul Survivors\n\nJack Ball – He may have made the journey with Paul back to the Soul Survivors\n\nRussell Martin- As a member of a legendary Beach Music band, King David & The Slaves,\n\nRussell may have had the most exciting itinerary but spent the most time in transit.\n\nEddie Middleton- the lead singer for R.C. & The Moonpies had a short jaunt over to Albany on the\n\nweekends to join up with Bobby Joiner and the Seros band.\n\nMickey Thomas – guitar –If ever Eddie got hoarse, he could rely on the band’s guitar player for\n\nback up vocals\n\nWhen school got out for the summer in 1969, R.C. & The Moonpies took its final bite as a part\n\ntime party band. Some members went back to their hometown bands but others made transitions.\n\nLead singer, Eddie Middleton followed Russell Martin to The Slaves, then to The In-Men\n\nLtd/Peace Core. Later on, Eddie sang lead for New Song and they won several dove awards in\n\nthe Christian Music field. With the remarkable comeback of the In-Men Ltd. in 2005, Eddie was\n\ncalled upon to sing lead on several R&B tunes. Mike Hattaway went on to drum with, Shiloh, The\n\nContinentals, and The Predictions… and the others…we’re not sure but it is thought that guitarist\n\nThomas fooled around and fell in love. first with Elvin Bishop, and then with the Jefferson\n\nStarship. The run for R.C. & The Moonpies was short, but obviously could have been a lot longer\n\nwith all that talent. But that’s just a little food for thought.\n\n(above info from: Greg Haynes)\n\nOTHER INFO:\n\nOne more little tidbit before you click to the sound. Lead vocals for “Superstition” are\n\nsupplied by Eddie Middleton. For those unfamiliar with Eddie, he is a South Georgia\n\nlegend who began his career in Albany, Georgia with the Seros. Bobby Joiner was also a\n\nmember of that band. While Eddie was at Valdosta State he sang lead vocals during the\n\nschool week with a band called R.C & The Moonpies. Other vocals in that part time\n\nband included Mickey Thomas who went on to sing lead vocals on Elvin Bishop’s “I\n\nFooled Around And Feel In Love.” On the weekends, Eddie would meet up with Randall\n\nBramblett and the rest of King David & The Slaves where they traveled the frat and party\n\ncircuit. The Slaves were another legendary beach band whose membership included some\n\nother greats including Davis Causey on guitar and Harold Williams on Saxophone in\n\naddition to Middleton and Bramblett. Check out other members of the Jesup, Georgia\n\nbased Slaves, The Jesters and The In-Men Ltd in the band directories. Before Middleton\n\nheaded “Down Home” in South Georgia with Wayne Scarbourgh and John Smith, he had\n\na stint with The In-Men Ltd. and now in 2006 returns with a cameo appearance with The\n\nIn-Men Ltd. with “Superstition.” After lining his shelves with awards received as a\n\nmember of the Christian group, New Song, Eddie Middleton has primarily given his\n\ntalents to a higher calling. We are thankful that he took his testimony and talents back for\n\na brief revisit to the Heeey Baby Days.\n\n(above info courtesy Mike Hill, Valdosta, GA realtor)\n\nEddie appeared with groups like the Four Tops, Four Seasons, Three Dog Night, Tina Turner, Drifters, Coasters, and many of the R&B artists of that day.\n\nPeace Core with Freddie Owens on sax (the band's spelling)\n\nEddie Middle was also an \"ace\" pitcher for his college baseball team, the Valdosta State Rebels. His fast ball rivaled any in the league.\n\n(Eddie: Top row, far right).\n\nEddie, fourth from left, was a member of Phi Delta Delta Fraternity at VSC\n\nSenior Picture, Valdosta State College, 1970\n\nEddie Middleton later moved to Nashville, Tennessee to take a shot at country music as a solo artist. Although he never achieved fame as a major recording artist, he did release a \"demo\" album and was able to make a living in the music industry in a city overflowing with musial talent.\n\nEddie's accomplishments include a widely released single, \"Midnight Train to Georgia\" and his own version of the Tams and Bill Deal hit, \"What Kind of Fool\". He also did the male voice for the Ruth's Chris Steak House commercial jingle.\n\nCheck it out: Midnight Train to Georgia\n\nWhat Kind of Fool\n\nSOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for band members was to go to an all night resturant for food after their performance. One of Eddie's favorite places to eat was the Waffle House (probably because it was one of the few places open all night back in the 60's). While chowing down early one morning he got the inspiration for a song about the Waffle House. He recorded \"Waffle Do-Wap\". and the song is still on the juke box at Waffle Houses across the contry today.\n\nWaffle House Jukebox Favorites\n\nEddie Middleton later began a career in contemporary Chrisrtian Music and was one of the original members of New Song. The group was founded at Morningside Baptist Church in Valdosta, Georgia. The group has won numerous awards including 17 number one songs and Dove award nominations\n\n.\n\nEddie Middleton is now the Music Minister at a church in Acworth, Georgia. He appears in churches all over the country giving his testimony via song. His most popular is a medley of Mowtown hit songs with contemporary christian lyrics."
