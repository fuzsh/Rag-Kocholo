        "text": "Genre-disruptor Koe Wetzel will release his next album 9 Lives on July 19 via Columbia Records.\n\nThe 13-track project is set to take fans beyond the party animal stories Wetzel has become known for in his near-decade of combining his country roots in Texas with his rock, hip-hop and grunge sensibilities. 9 Lives was produced predominantly by Gabe Simon (Noah Kahan’s Stick Season) alongside a lineup of trusted collaborators like Josh Serrato, Carrie K and Sam Harris (X Ambassadors).\n\nIn addition to the already-released lead single “Damn Near Normal,” the album includes emotional ballads such as “Sweet Dreams” and “Hatchet,” rowdy singalongs like “Casamigos” and “Bar Song” and Wetzel’s signature wit with tunes like “Leigh.” Also featured is a cover of the late Keith Gattis‘ “Reconsider.”\n\n“I want fans to know that there’s a different side of me, not just the sex, drugs, and rock & roll Koe that they may have heard about online,” Wetzel says. “I’ve grown up a little bit. I’m no longer the 20-year-old kid that’s partying down and getting thrown in jail all the time. 9 Lives reveals a vulnerable side that people may not be used to hearing.”\n\nTo introduce the new album, Wetzel released a funny album trailer of his nine personas. Fans can also take a quiz to discover which Wetzel character is most like them.\n\nWetzel will take all nine of his lives on the road this year on the recently announced “Damn Near Normal World Tour,” as well as prominent sets at Rock the Country, Hangout, Country Jam, Country Thunder Wisconsin, WE Fest, Watershed and more. He will also join Morgan Wallen on his “One Night At A Time World Tour” in Arlington, Texas this July."
