        "text": "When Morgan Wallen headlined the Sunday (April 28) lineup at Indio, Calif., country music festival Stagecoach, he performed many of his signature hits, but the Grammy-nominated singer also had some help surprising the audience during his festival-closing set on the Mane Stage.\n\nWallen brought out Post Malone, who joined Wallen for a new song called “I Had Some Help.”\n\nPost Malone previously teased the uptempo track on social media, highlighting lyrics such as “I had some help/ It ain’t like I can make this kind of mess all by myself/ Don’t act like you ain’t help me pull that bottle off the shelf … they say teamwork makes the dream work.”\n\nOf course, this wasn’t Wallen and Posty’s first joint performance; back at November’s CMA Awards, they were joined by Hardy to honor the late Joe Diffie with renditions of “John Deere Greene” and “Pickup Man.”\n\nAlso, Post Malone had his own set at Stagecoach on Saturday, performing a slate of country cover songs and welcoming Brad Paisley, Sara Evans and Dwight Yoakam to assist his throwback country set. Yoakam joined for “Little Ways,” while Paisley and Posty collaborated on the former’s “I’m Gonna Miss Her (the Fishin’ Song)” before they also offered up Vince Gill’s classic “One More Last Chance.” Evans joined Post Malone for her own “Suds in the Bucket.” He opened with a version of Tyler Childers’ “Whitehouse Road,” and offered up renditions of Tim McGraw’s “Don’t Take the Girl,” Randy Travis’ “Three Wooden Crosses” and honored the late Toby Keith with a rendition of “Who’s Your Daddy?”\n\nPost Malone closed out his set by having Paisley return to the stage as they offered up ’90s country classic “Chattahoochee” by Alan Jackson.\n\nFollowing Post Malone’s CMA Awards performance, rumors have swirled that he is making his own country record, something he confirmed during a livestream interview on Twitch, though no concrete information has been released on such a project.\n\n“Country record is coming. I keep singing a song that we made while I was in Nashville. It’s so f–king sick, but it’s not out,” he said during the Twitch livestream.\n\nWatch clips from Morgan Wallen and Post Malone’s performance of “I Had Some Help” at Stagecoach below:"
