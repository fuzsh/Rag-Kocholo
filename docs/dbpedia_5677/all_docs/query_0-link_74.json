        "text": "220\n\nThey’ve encouraged all of us for many generations, and have helped raise up more ministering artists for generations to come. Meet “NewSong,” the artists behind the Winter Jam Tour Spectacular, making an impact on this nation, and the many nations around the world!\n\nNewSong’s “I Am A Christian” is an anthem for us all, and one that speaks the truth as to why we are each here, in not only fulfilling our own individual purpose; but, in the completion of our call, as a Body of Christ.\n\n“We believe that it’s so beautiful when thousands of people come together in community to worship one name, Jesus,” says NewSong in a post shared earlier this year on social media.\n\nNewSong is a contemporary Christian music group that was founded in 1981 at Morningside Baptist Church in Valdosta, Georgia. They’ve had twelve GMA Dove Award nominations, as well as one Grammy Award Nomination. They are the founders of the Winter Jam Tour Spectacular, the United States’ largest annual Christian music tour.\n\nI had the privilege of meeting one of NewSong’s founding members, Eddie Carswell, at the Winter Jam (Tampa, FL) event in January of 2016. One year prior, One Jam Nation had aired its first program on WTIS, having celebrated its one-year anniversary that previous fall.\n\nThe same year, we also had the privilege of meeting Russ Lee on air, having Eddie on air in February (the following year), celebrating the Winter Jam tour through the spring.\n\n“The heartbeat of Winter Jam is the gospel of Jesus Christ! We can’t put into words how much we love this tour and its purpose,” explains Russ Lee.\n\nNewSong’s Winter Jam Tour Spectacular\n\nWinter Jam Tour Spectacular, also referred to as Winter Jam, and formerly known as January Jam (from 1995–2000), is an annual American music tour featuring Christian rock, Christian rap, and contemporary Christian music bands, stunt and/or comedy performances, and a speaker.\n\nWinter Jam has featured a vast and diverse range of big-name bands such as for King & Country, TobyMac, Newsboys, Third Day, MercyMe, Skillet, Disciple, Audio Adrenaline, and Lecrae, and has helped expose and popularize many artists, such as Hawk Nelson, We Are Messengers, and more.\n\nFor the last five years, I have personally watched these gentlemen on stage, celebrating many concert events, tours, and new releases. I’ve come to have a great admiration for them, and recognize their remarkable talents and extraordinary influence on the Christian Entertainment Industry, as a whole. I love what NewSong is doing in training up new music missionaries (through the Winter Jam Tour Spectacular), and in honoring the Lord through this “joy and music” (Psalm 95:1).\n\nNewSong’s “Greatest Hits LIVE Tour,” is very near and dear to my heart, and much of the heartbeat of ONE JAM NATION Radio in celebrating the Lord through some of the greatest hits in Christian Music’s history, through our daily playlist and programs like Jesus Music Flashback, having aired on Saturdays at 1pm (US/ET).\n\nWe are excited to follow and celebrate NewSong as artists, as well as these faithful servants of the Lord, as they do continue to make an impact on this nation, and the many nations of the world, through this powerful music ministry.\n\nPsalm 96:1 says, “Sing to the LORD a new song; Sing to the LORD, all the earth.”"
