Based on the record of the same name, this collection of inspirational praise songs will be a welcome addition to choral libraries everywhere. The stirring vocal arrangements of Carol Cymbala have been only enhanced by Bradley Knight in his inaugural project with the Choir as orchestrator. This is a powerful collection of inspirational praise songs written and arranged in the celebrated style you have come to expect from the renowned group. With 11 titles to choose from, choirs and ensembles everywhere will welcome the fresh collection of up-tempo praise music, soulful ballads and commanding solos with choral backup. The exciting, singable arrangements include bass cues, making the songs accessible to the entire men's section. Choirs and congregations alike will be blessed by the enthusiastic message and songs of The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir."
