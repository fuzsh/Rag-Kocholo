        "text": "Singer-songwriter and producer Nandi Rose’s project Half Waif just announced their fourth album with a new single, “Figurine,” out now. See You At The Maypole follows up 2021’s Mythopoetics, and carries themes of life and death. The music video for “Figurine,” directed by Derrick Belcham, shows Rose mourning in a white dress, surrounded by ever-changing natural landscapes.\n\n“Figurine” is a ballad with a bite. It’s delicate and hopeful, but also raw, written about Rose’s miscarriage and the medical issues that followed. “Not everyone will go through a miscarriage, but this is a song about how to continue on after losing something precious, how to find the light on your face again,” she said in a recent statement. “I was literally carrying death inside me, and then my body was frozen.… This wasn’t just my story, I wanted to say. It was every story of loss — the loss of a life, the loss of a dream, the loss of trust and hope and faith. A story of finding a way back again.”\n\nSee You At The Maypole follows the 2024 EP Ephemeral Being and arrives October 4 via ANTI-. It was created alongside Zubin Hensler and a rotating band which included percussionists Jason Burger and Zack Levine, guitarist Josh Marre, violinists Hannah Epperson and Elena Moon Park, clarinetist Kristina Teuschler, trombonist Willem de Koch, harpist Rebecca El-Saleh, and upright bassist Spencer Zahn."
