        "text": "When Justin Timberlake played his new material for close friends, they had one resounding reaction: \"This sounds like everything we know you for, everything we thought we wanted from you.\"\n\nThose words inspired the title of Timberlake's first album in six years, Everything I Thought It Was, which arrived March 15. The Memphis-born singer has described the release as \"incredibly honest\" but also as having \"a lot of f—ng fun\" — a statement that encapsulates how his music has evolved in the past three decades.\n\nSince his beginnings as a child entertainer on shows like Star Search and Disney's Mickey Mouse Club, and later as a member of best-selling boy band *NSYNC, Timberlake proved that he belonged on the stage. His charisma and passion made him stand out effortlessly, and those experiences foreshadowed his star power and the brilliant solo career he was poised to have.\n\nWhen *NSYNC announced their hiatus in April 2002, it took Timberlake just six months to release Justified, his debut LP. For the first time in a decade, he was introducing himself as an artist with full agency over his work, and showing exactly the kind of music he wanted to create.\n\n\"I felt like I had so much to prove to myself because I was coming from such a humongous group and a humongous movement of pop music,\" he reflected in a 2023 YouTube interview for Beatclub. \"There was a real sound around what people were considering pop music before I went solo ... I knew I wanted to make a different type of album.\"\n\nJustified promptly shifted Timberlake's good-boy image into a grown-up stunner. Through R&B, hip-hop and funk beats, he wears his heart on his sleeve; there's lust in lead single \"Like I Love You,\" pain in \"Cry Me A River,\" joy in \"Rock Your Body.\" It resonated with the public — the album peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 and spawned two top five singles, proving that Timberlake was more than ready to shine on his own. In addition, the album won him his first GRAMMYs in 2004 for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Cry Me A River\"; he had been nominated nine times with *NSYNC, and once for \"Like I Love You\" the year prior.\n\nLargely produced by the Neptunes and Timbaland, Justified also marked the beginning of a vital partnership for the singer. Timbaland was essential in shaping Timberlake's musical DNA, and helped produce a majority of his discography — including credits on two tracks of EITIW. \"We share the same perspective that we always want to make something that reminds us of music that we love, but at the same time is something we've never heard before,\" Timberlake told GRAMMY.com in 2014.\n\nFollowing Justified, Timberlake ventured into acting — another one of his burgeoning skills — landing roles in films like 2006's Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan. However, 2006 was best known as the year Timberlake brought sexy back with his sophomore album, FutureSex/LoveSounds.\n\nConsidered by many as peak JT, FS/LS shot his popularity into the stratosphere and solidified him as a superstar in his own right. An avant-garde pop masterpiece, its 12 tracks weave R&B and electronic music, sprinkling in guitar solos and interludes, Timberlake's flawless falsetto and distorted synths. Its experimentalism laid the groundwork for what became known as Timberlake's signature sound, and what he would explore in the future — including on Everything I Thought It Was singles \"Selfish\" and \"Drown.\" The album also marked Timberlake's first solo No.1 on the Billboard 200, and produced three No.1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 in a row.\n\nAccording to Timberlake, those three singles — \"SexyBack,\" \"My Love,\" and \"What Goes Around…Comes Around\" — \"started a sound that I feel like it went on for, humbly speaking, a whole decade.\" FutureSex/LoveSounds earned Timberlake four more GRAMMYs: Best Dance Recording for \"SexyBack\" and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"My Love\" in 2007, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"What Goes Around…Comes Around\" and Best Dance Recording for \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows\" in 2008.\n\nFollowing FS/LS, Timberlake started a six-year release pattern that he has continued through Everything I Thought It Was. During those down periods, he still managed to maintain his star prowess by landing successful acting spots and producing songs for artists such as Rihanna and Madonna. And the first six-year hiatus was clearly fruitful, as his third LP was a two-part beast: 2013'sThe 20/20 Experience.\n\nProduced by Timbaland and J-Roc, the double album displayed the singer at his most sophisticated yet, and reflected his growth in the decade since Justified came out. The first half's 10 tracks are lofty, lengthy meanderings inspired by neo soul and Timberlake's lasting love of '60s music.\n\n\"When we were making the record I said, 'If Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin can do 10-minute songs and Queen can do 10-minute songs, then why can't we?' We'll figure out the radio edits later,\" he told Capital FM at the time, according to NME. The album went straight to No.1 on the Billboard 200, spearheaded by the austere charm of \"Suit & Tie,\" featuring Jay-Z, and the stirring emotions of \"Mirrors.\"\n\nSix months later, Timberlake dropped the second half of his project, The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2, and the compilation of both albums, The 20/20 Experience – The Complete Experience. Comprising songs with a more accessible structure (though they still averaged 7 minutes), 2 of 2 also debuted at No.1 on the Billboard 200, and \"Pusher Love Girl\" won Timberlake his first Best R&B Song GRAMMY in 2014. Furthermore, its sounds pushed Timberlake's versatility to new edges, and deeply impacted his future releases.\n\nAs he entered his thirties, Timberlake's priorities shifted; he married actress Jessica Biel in 2012, and welcomed his first son, Silas, in 2015. A break from music was only natural, but this time it was also transformational — and reflected in his artistry. In 2016, in the middle of an album hiatus, Timberlake landed one of the biggest and most unexpected hits in his career: \"CAN'T STOP THE FEELING!.\"\n\nThe disco-infused single was part of the soundtrack for DreamWorks Animation's Trolls, where Timberlake voiced the character Branch and worked as executive music producer. Attesting his talent for making simple, feel-good hits, \"CAN'T STOP\" was Timberlake's first No.1 single in almost a decade, and earned him a GRAMMY for Best Song Written For Visual Media and an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. It is also his biggest streaming song to date, with over 1 billion listens on both Spotify and YouTube.\n\nTrolls brought Timberlake back into the limelight after years of focusing mostly on his personal life, and consequently created buzz around his upcoming releases. \"I wouldn't say [my new material] is the antithesis of 20/20, but it does sound more singular,\" he teased in an interview with Variety in 2016. \"If 20/20 sounded like it literally surrounds your entire head, this stuff feels more like it just punches you between the eyes.\"**\n\nIn 2018, Timberlake dropped his fifth studio album, Man Of The Woods, whose title derives from the meaning of Silas' name. The album itself was largely inspired by Timberlake's family and his Southern roots, and found him back with Timbaland and the Neptunes. The result is a record where Timberlake mixes his brand of funky pop while diving into the country and Americana sounds of his childhood. It's his most vulnerable work so far; in the album closer, \"Young Man,\" for example, Timberlake takes the position of a doting father passing on his teachings, wrapping it up with vocal snippets from Biel and Silas.\n\nEven though Man Of The Woods largely didn't have the same commercial impact as Timberlake's previous works, it still marked his fourth consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200, and the release lined up with a headlining gig at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show — a testament to his staying power.\n\nIn the years prior to Everything I Thought It Was, Timberlake kept busy by collaborating with artists like SZA (\"The Other Side\" from Trolls World Tour), Calvin Harris (\"Stay with Me\" with Halsey and Pharrell Williams), and Jack Harlow (\"Parent Trap\"). He also welcomed second son, Phineas, in 2020, and worked in several movies, including two Trolls sequels.\n\n2023's Trolls Band Together, the latest installment of the franchise, also held a sweet, dreamlike surprise: Timberlake reunited with *NSYNC to release their first song together in 20 years. The heartwarming, funky \"Better Place\" was a reminder of the quintet's chemistry, and reignited hopes for further collaborations.\n\nLuckily, fans wouldn't need to wait for too long. *NSYNC is among the three featured artists on Everything I Thought It Was, on a breezy track called \"Paradise.\" (And those who were in attendance at Timberlake's \"one night only\" show at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on March 13 got to see the group's first performance together in over a decade, when they premiered \"Paradise\" and sang four *NSYNC classics.)\n\nThis isn't the only callback to the past on the album, though. The chill beats and adoring message of lead single \"Selfish\" bring to mind a refresh of 20/20's \"Not A Bad Thing\"; second single \"Drown\" rides on the same wavelength of \"Cry Me A River\" and \"What Goes Around…Comes Around,\" but tinged with more sadness than spite. Meanwhile, \"Sanctified\" is the pure ambition of FS/LS transmuted into a soul-opera-rock trip. Throughout the album's other 15 tracks, Timberlake also dabbles on heavy basslines (\"No Angels\"), disco melodies (\"My Favorite Drug\"), sweet R&B croons (\"Love & War\"), and sour, stingy ballads (\"Flame\").\n\nAs Timberlake declared himself on The Graham Norton Show, bits and pieces of all his previous works come together to form an updated version of himself on this album — one that is finally comfortable in being vulnerable, and thankful for everything he's been through. \"I'm everything you thought I was/ I'm everything I thought I was/ It was everything I thought it was,\" he sings in the opening track, \"Memphis.\"\n\n\"I'm having this moment in my life looking back on everything that has been, and accepting all of it. The good, the bad, the fast, the slow,\" he said on The Kelly Clarkson Show. \"It's just about arriving at this place right now in my life, as an artist, as a husband, as a father, as a human. And I'm just really excited about what the future holds.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake's Biggest Songs, From His Best *NSYNC Moments To The Solo Smashes\n\nMarch is Women’s History Month, and women in music are more powerful than ever.\n\nThe month begins with the comeback of several queens, starting with Kim Gordon’s The Collective and Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine. Later, country darling Kacey Musgraves will unveil Deeper Well, and Shakira will drop the empowering Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran. Long-awaited debuts by GRAMMY-winning singer Tyla and singer/bassist Blu DeTiger will also join the lineup, with their respective Tyla and All I Ever Want Is Everything. Wrapping up March on a high note, Beyoncé will drop her highly-anticipated Act II on the 29th.\n\nMen will release music in March as well: Expect new releases by Justin Timberlake, Bleachers, the last record from pop-punk band Sum 41, and (allegedly) Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 2.\n\nTo make the most of this prolific time, GRAMMY.com compiled all the must-hear albums dropping March 2024.\n\nSchoolboy Q - Blue Lips\n\nRelease date: March 1\n\nOn Feb. 1, Schoolboy Q’s website was updated with a mysterious countdown and a 37-second video. In it, the rapper finally unveiled the setlist and title of his much-awaited sixth studio album, Blue Lips, as well as its release date — March 1.\n\nBlue Lips is Q’s first full record since 2019’s Crash Talk, although he had been teasing the album since 2020. Hopefully, it was worth the wait: Blue Lips holds 18 tracks and participations by Rico Nasty, Freddie Gibbs, and more. Q has also started a new vlog series on social media called \"wHy not?,\" where he takes the viewers behind the scenes of making the album and previews snippets of the songs.\n\nSo far, the rapper shared tracks \"Blueslides,\" \"Back n Love\" with Devin Malik, \"Cooties\" and \"Love Birds\" with Devin Malik and Lance Skiiwalker, as well as lead single \"Yeern 101.\"\n\nBleachers - Bleachers\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nFronted by 10-time GRAMMY winner and 2024 Producer Of The Year Jack Antonoff, rock band Bleachers will release its eponymous fourth studio album on March 8.\n\nIn a press release, Bleachers is described as Antonoff’s \"distinctly New Jersey take on the bizarre sensory contradictions of modern life.\" The self-titled record will blend sadness and joy into \"music for driving on the highway to, for crying to and for dancing to at weddings.\"\n\nThe band shared four singles so far: lead track \"Modern Girl,\" \"Alma Mater\" featuring Lana del Rey, \"Tiny Moves\" and \"Me Before You.\" Through serendipitous melodies and soulful writing, Bleachers commit to \"exist in crazy times but remember what counts.\"\n\nBleachers will tour the U.K. in March and the U.S. in May and June.\n\nKim Gordon - The Collective\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nFormer Sonic Youth vocalist Kim Gordon will release her sophomore LP, The Collective, on March 8. The album is a follow-up to her 2019 debut No Home Record, and furthers her collaboration with producer Justin Raisen, as well as additional producing from Anthony Paul Lopez.\n\n\"On this record, I wanted to express the absolute craziness I feel around me right now,\" said Gordon in a press statement. \"This is a moment when nobody really knows what truth is, when facts don’t necessarily sway people, when everyone has their own side, creating a general sense of paranoia. To soothe, to dream, escape with drugs, TV shows, shopping, the internet, everything is easy, smooth, convenient, branded. It made me want to disrupt, to follow something unknown, maybe even to fail.\"\n\nBack in January, the singer unveiled the album’s moody first single, \"Bye Bye,\" and a music video starring her daughter, Coco Gordon Moore. The second single, \"I’m A Man,\" came out in February. Gordon will play six concerts in support of The Collective, starting March 21 in Burlington, Vermont.\n\nAriana Grande - Eternal Sunshine\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nIt’s been almost four years since Ariana Grande’s last studio album, 2020’s Positions. The starlet spent the past few years filming Wicked, an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, and declared that she wouldn’t be releasing any new records until it was done.\n\nThe wait is finally over, as Grande announced her seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine. The album’s first and only single, \"Yes, And?,\" dropped in January, followed by an Instagram video of the soprano singer explaining the concept of the album to her Republic Records team.\n\n\"It’s kind of a concept album ’cause it’s all different heightened pieces of the same story, of the same experience,\" she said. \"Some of [the songs] are really vulnerable, some of them are like playing the part of what people kind of expect me to be sometimes and having fun with it.\"\n\n\"I think this one may be your favorite,\" Grande wrote of Eternal Sunshine on her Instagram Story. \"It is mine.\" The 13-song collection will reportedly explore house and R&B, and will have only one feature: Grande’s grandmother, who appears on the last track, \"Ordinary Things.\"\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign -Vultures 2\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nAfter a series of delays, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s first collaborative album, Vultures 1, ultimately dropped on Feb. 10, 2024. Set to be the first installment of a trilogy, the album was released independently through West’s YZY label, and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with all of its 16 tracks also charting on Billboard’s Hot 100.\n\nBilled as ¥$, the duo plans to release Vultures 2 on March 8, and follow up with Vultures 3 on April 5. Although any other info about the upcoming volumes is still unclear, Timbaland recently shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Vultures 2 is \"OTW.\" (Timbaland produced Vultures 1’s \"Keys to My Life\" and \"Fuk Sumn\" with Playboi Carti and Travis Scott.)\n\nIn the past month, West and $ign held a few listening parties for the album in the U.S. and Europe, but additional schedules are yet to be revealed.\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain - Glasgow Eyes\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nTo celebrate their 40th anniversary, alt-rock band the Jesus and Mary Chain will release their eighth studio album, Glasgow Eyes, on March 8.\n\nAs it can be seen on lead single \"Jamcod,\" the Scottish group still runs strong on the distorted synths and electrifying guitars that shaped their sound. \"People should expect a Jesus and Mary Chain record, and that’s certainly what Glasgow Eyes is,\" vocalist Jim Reid said in a statement. \"Our creative approach is remarkably the same as it was in 1984, just hit the studio and see what happens. We went in with a bunch of songs and let it take its course. There are no rules, you just do whatever it takes.\"\n\nGlasgow Eyes also mends a six-year gap since the Jesus and Mary Chain’s latest album, 2017’s Damage and Joy. To further commemorate, the band will also release an autobiography and embark on a European tour throughout March and April.\n\nJustin Timberlake - Everything I Thought It Was\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nJustin Timberlake is back with his first studio album since 2018’s Man of the Woods. The new record, Everything I Thought It Was, is spearheaded by singles \"Selfish\" and \"Drown.\"\n\n\"I worked for a long time on this album, and I ended up with 100 songs. So, narrowing them down to 18 was a thing,\" said Timberlake in an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1. \"I’m really excited about this album. I think every artist probably says this, but it is my best work.\" The Memphis singer also shared that there are \"incredibly honest\" moments in the album, but also \"a lot of f—ng fun.\"\n\nTo celebrate his return, Timberlake announced his Forget Tomorrow World Tour. Set to kick off on April 29 in Vancouver, the tour will cross through North America and Europe until its final date on Dec. 16 in Indianapolis.\n\nKacey Musgraves - Deeper Well\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nFresh off winning Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 2024 GRAMMYs for the Zach Bryan duet \"I Remember Everything,\" Kacey Musgraves announced her fifth studio album, Deeper Well..\n\n\"My Saturn has returned/ When I turned 27/ Everything started to change,\" she sings in the contemplative title track, exploring how she changed over the last few years. The single sets the tone for the rest of the record, which was co-produced by longtime collaborators Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian.\n\nFeaturing 14 tracks, Deeper Well was mostly recorded at the legendary Electric Lady studios in New York City. \"I was seeking some different environmental energy, and Electric Lady has the best mojo. Great ghosts,\" the country star noted in a press release.\n\nOn social media, Musgraves wrote: \"it’s a collection of songs I hold very dear to my heart. I hope it makes a home in all of your hearts, too.\" Deeper Well follows 2021’s star-crossed.\n\nTierra Whack - World Wide Whack\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nWhen rapper Tierra Whack released her first album, 2018’s Whack World, she quickly garnered the admiration of both critics and fans. Comprising 15 one-minute tracks and music videos for each, the release was a refreshing introduction to a groundbreaking artist.\n\nIn 2024, the Philadelphia-born star is preparing to release World Wide Whack, labeled her official debut album in a press release. The cover artwork, created by Alex Da Corte, was inspired by theater character Pierrot, fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli and Donna Summer, and represents \"the first reveal of the World Wide Whack character, an alter ego both untouchable and vulnerable, superhuman and painfully human, whose surprising story will unfold in images and video over the course of the album’s visual rollout.\"\n\nThe album follows Whack’s 2021 EP trilogy — Rap?, Pop? and R&B? — and is foreshadowed by the poignant \"27 Club\" and the eccentric \"Shower Song.\"\n\nTyla - Tyla\n\nRelease date: March 22\n\nAfter a glowing 2023 with viral hit \"Water,\" South African newcomer Tyla started 2024 with a blast. Last month, she became the first person to win a GRAMMY for Best African Music Performance, and the youngest-ever African singer to win a GRAMMY Award at 22 years old.\n\nNext month is poised to be even better: Tyla’s eponymous debut LP drops on March 22, featuring \"Water\" and other hits like \"Truth or Dare,\" \"Butterflies\" and \"On and On,\" as well as a guest appearance by labelmate Travis Scott.\n\n\"African music is going global and I’m so blessed to be one of the artists pushing the culture,\" Tyla shared on Instagram. Her unique blend of amapiano, pop and R&B is making waves around the world, and the star will rightfully celebrate by touring Europe and North America throughout this spring.\n\nShakira - Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran\n\nRelease date: March 22\n\nThe title of Shakira’s new album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, is a nod to her 2023 hit \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" with Argentine DJ Bizarrap. In the lyrics, she states that \"las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan\" — \"women don’t cry anymore, they make money.\"\n\nThe single is a diss to Shakira’s ex-partner, footballer Gerard Piqué, and, like the rest of the record, served as a healing experience after their separation. \"Making this body of work has been an alchemical process,\" the Colombian star said in a statement. \"While writing each song I was rebuilding myself. While singing them, my tears transformed into diamonds, and my vulnerability into strength.\"\n\nLas Mujeres will feature 16 songs, including her Bizarrap collaboration and singles \"Te Felicito\" with Rauw Alejandro, \"Copa Vacía\" with Manuel Turizo, \"Acróstico,\" \"Monotonía\" with Ozuna, \"El Jefe\" with Mexican band Fuerza Regida, and \"TQG\" with fellow Colombian Karol G.\n\nSheryl Crow - Evolution\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nBack in 2018, Sheryl Crow said that the LP Threads would be her last — fortunately, she changed her mind. \"I said I’d never make another record, though there was no point to it,\" the singer shared in a statement about her upcoming album, Evolution. \"This music comes from my soul. And I hope whoever hears this record can feel that.\"\n\nAccording to the same statement, \"Evolution is Sheryl Crow at her most authentically human self,\" and its music and lyrics \"came from sitting in the quiet and writing from a deep soul place.\"\n\nThe entire album was written in a month, starting with the title track, which expresses Crow’s anxieties about artificial intelligence and the future of humans. From then on, Crow and producer Mike Elizondo found bliss. \"The songs just kept flowing out of me, four songs turned into nine and it was pretty obvious this was an album,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to the album's title track, Crow also shared singles \"Do It Again\" and \"Alarm Clock.\"\n\nSum 41 - Heaven :x: Hell\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nAfter nearly three decades together, punk-metal mavericks Sum 41 are parting ways. Their final release will be a double album. Heaven :x: Hell, set to drop on March 29.\n\nHeaven is composed of 10 pop-punk tracks reminiscent of the band’s early years, while Hell is 10 tracks of pure heavy metal, reflecting the direction they took more recently. \"Once I heard the music, I was confident enough to say, ‘This is the record I’d like to go out on,'\" frontman Deryck Whibley said in a statement. \"We’ve made a double album of pop punk and metal, and it makes sense. It took a long time for us to pave this lane for ourselves, but we did, and it’s unique to us.\"\n\nThe band shared singles \"Landmines,\" \"Rise Up\" and \"Waiting on a Twist of Fate,\" and proved that they’re leaving on top of their game. \"I love Sum 41, what we’ve achieved, endured, and stuck together through, which is why I want to call it quits,\" Whibley added. \"It’s the right time to walk away from it. I’m putting all of my energy into what’s ahead.\"\n\nBut before embarking on new ventures, Sum 41 will spend the rest of the year touring throughout Asia, North America, and Europe.\n\nBlu DeTiger - All I Ever Want Is Everything\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nAt only 26 years old, Blu DeTiger has already toured with Caroline Polachek, played bass for Jack Antonoff’s band Bleachers, partnered with Fender, and appeared on the 2023 Forbes 30 Under 30’s music list.\n\nNow, she prepares to release her debut studio album, All I Ever Want Is Everything. \"This album is about growing and becoming, settling into yourself and learning to love where you’re at through it all. It’s about learning how to be your own best friend,\" the bassist and singer wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Dangerous Game,\" the lead single off the album, showcases DeTiger’s effervescent energy and potential for pop stardom. Starting April, she will also headline a U.S. tour across Boston, Washington D.C., New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nBeyoncé - Act II\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nWhat better event to announce a new album than the most-watched TV program ever? That’s what Beyoncé did during Super Bowl LVIII, on Feb. 11. At the end of a Verizon commercial, the singer declared \"Okay, they ready. Drop the new music,\" while simultaneously releasing Act II’s lead singles, \"16 Carriages\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em,\" on social media and streaming platforms.\n\nComing out March 29, Act II is the second part of Beyoncé’s ongoing trilogy, which was written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic. The album is preceded by 2022’s acclaimed Act I: Renaissance, but instead of house and disco, the singer will reportedly take a deep dive into country music.\n\nThis isn’t Queen Bey’s first foray into the genre — in 2016, she released Lemonade’s \"Daddy Lessons,\" and her 2021 IVY PARK Rodeo collection was inspired by \"the overlooked history of the American Black cowboy,\" as she told Harper’s Bazaar. It was just a question of time for Beyoncé to enter her country era, and it is finally upon us.\n\n17 Love Songs That Have Won GRAMMYs: \"I Will Always Love You,\" \"Drunk In Love\" & More\n\nMore than 30 years into his career, Justin Timberlake has played practically every famous stage in the world. Yet, on Jan. 19, the multi-hyphenate star performed on perhaps the most meaningful one so far: the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\"I've been dreaming for a long time to come back to my hometown and play the Orpheum,\" Timberlake, a born-and-raised Memphian, told the crowd. \"My mother used to bring me here to see shows, and everything looks so much bigger. But this city and this venue is very, very special to me.\"\n\nAs much as the homecoming meant to Timberlake, the show was also equally exciting for fans: it means an album and a tour are on the way.\n\nTwo days before the concert — which was free for fans who won tickets through a Ticketmaster lottery — Timberlake teased the acronym \"EITIW\" in a cryptic Instagram post. (The letters also graced a T-shirt for sale at the venue.) Following the show, he revealed the letters to mean \"Everything I Thought It Was,\" seemingly the title of his forthcoming sixth studio album.\n\nWhile the 90-minute set list was largely dedicated to JT classics, Timberlake's latest Memphis performance wasn't just a celebration of his discography — it was an indication that he's ready to get the next chapter started.\n\nAs Timberlake gears up for his latest \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance on Jan. 27, check out five of the most memorable moments from his Memphis homecoming.\n\nHis Mom Was In The Crowd\n\nIt wouldn't be a hometown show without Mom there. But Timberlake's mom, Lynn, wasn't just in attendance — she was in the middle of the crowd, dancing and singing to every song.\n\n\"She's not proud at all,\" Timberlake joked after pointing her out.\n\nTo top things off, her birthday was the next day, so the singer instructed the Orpheum audience to sing \"Happy Birthday.\" \"She's gonna start celebratin' at midnight, I just know it,\" he quipped. \"So we gotta kick this off the right way.\"\n\nHis Hometown Love Was Palpable\n\nAs Timberlake displayed in his social media post announcing the Orpheum performance, he has been proclaiming his hometown pride since the beginning of his career. And throughout all 90 minutes of the show, there was no denying that his love for Memphis — which he kept fondly referring to as \"M-town\" — is still very much alive.\n\nWhile cheers indicated that the majority of the Orpheum crowd were from the area, Timberlake had one message for those who traveled to the show: \"Welcome to the greatest city on Earth.\"\n\nAfter that, he \"couldn't resist\" paying tribute to one of the city's soul legends (and one of his biggest inspirations), Al Green, with a breezy cover of \"Let's Stay Together.\"\n\nHe Did Every Ad Lib (And Then Some)\n\nThose who have seen Timberlake live know that he doesn't shy away from his signature falsetto in concert. That was no different at the Orpheum, but it felt like he was on another level on a hometown stage.\n\nAlong with hitting the high notes in \"Like I Love You\" and \"Cry Me a River,\" he added little improvised moments to several songs. For \"My Love\" alone, he busted out a freestyle rap verse and some a cappella before diving into the full song.\n\nOne of the most stunning performances of the night was a stripped-down version of \"What Goes Around… Comes Around.\" Though he's sung it acoustic a number of times, the dimly lit, harmony-driven rendition was mesmerizing the whole way through.\n\nHe Celebrated The Hits And The Deep Cuts\n\nTimberlake's Memphis homecoming may have been a kickoff to \"Everything I Thought It Was,\" but the set list was dedicated to everything fans knew.\n\nFrom \"Senõrita\" to \"Suit & Tie\" to \"Can't Stop the Feeling,\" the 17-song set list consisted of every chart-topping or beloved hit in Timberlake's catalog. He also showed love to some of his star-studded collabs, singing his verse of Jay-Z's \"Holy Grail\" and jamming to his Three 6 Mafia/Timbaland team-up \"Chop Me Up\" and his part of 50 Cent's \"Ayo Technology\" during a mid-show breakdown with the night's DJ, Andrew Hypes.\n\nEven the *NSYNC fans in the crowd had a moment, as Timberlake pointed out that bandmate Chris Kirkpatrick was in attendance. And though the two didn't sing the group's frenzy-stirring new track, \"Better Place,\" Timberlake did honor his boy band roots by dancing to snippets of \"Gone\" and \"Girlfriend.\"\n\nHe Premiered Not One, But Two New Songs\n\nAs Timberlake hinted in his pre-show posts, new music is coming — and, of course, Memphis got the first taste.\n\nA clip of one track, an electro-pop jam titled \"No Angels,\" was played by Hypes as Timberlake bounced along. \"Y'all better dance!\" the singer declared.\n\nHe hopped back up on stage for the other new song, \"Selfish,\" a heartfelt midtempo ballad reminiscent of his 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2 hit \"Not a Bad Thing.\" (\"Selfish\" is seemingly the lead single from the new album, as it's the first song available to pre-save.)\n\nBoth songs were more in line with the vibes of 2006's silky, techno-driven FutureSex/Love Sounds and 2013's neo soul-inspired The 20/20 Experience — and judging by the fact that Timberlake didn't play any songs from his most recent LP, 2018's more subdued Man of the Woods, this next project could be just what fans have been waiting for.\n\nAs for where Timberlake left things before signing off from Memphis? \"I love you so much — we'll see you on tour.\"\n\n24 Songs Turning 20: Listen To 2004's Bangers, From \"Yeah!\" To \"Since U Been Gone\"\n\nA lavender haze has descended upon movie theaters across America.\n\nTaylor Swift’s filmed version of her historic Eras tour is the movie-music event of the year, dominating the box office becoming highest grossing dometic concert film in Hollywood history after a single weekend. Byt the time the Eras credits roll, you know all too well that you’re going to want to keep the party going.\n\nLuckily, there are a breadth of artists whose musical singularity is reflected on the silver screen. Swift's major influence notwithstanding, the concert film seems to be having a moment in recent years: Pop stars such as Lizzo (Live in Concert), Selena Gomez (My Mind and Me) and Lewis Capaldi have released popular concert films.\n\nFrom Beyoncé’s stunning Homecoming, to acclaimed concert films from Queen to Talking Heads and new entries like from the boys in BTS, read on for 11 excellent concert film experiences.\n\nHomecoming: A Film by Beyonce (2019)\n\nWhen Beyoncé headlined the Coachella Music and Arts Festival — the first Black woman to do so — in 2018, she didn’t just perform; she delivered a tour de force extravaganza that spurred a whole new moniker: Beychella.\n\nShot over two nights, the Netflix film Homecoming includes a discography-spanning retrospective and memorable performances of \"Run the World,\" \"Single Ladies\" and \"Formation.\" Layered in ware nods to the Historically Black College and University experience, legends like Nina Simone and dazzling array of choreography, wardrobe and vocal chops.\n\nThe New Yorker later hailed it a \"triumphant self portrait\" and \"a spectacle of soul.\" Directed by Queen Bey herself, Homecoming took home the golden gramophone for Best Music Film at hte 62nd GRAMMYs.\n\nStop Making Sense (1984)\n\nThe filmmaker Jonathan Demme is known for classics like Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but he was also a major force in concert films. Among his achievements in this field is Stop Making Sense, his 1984 portrait of David Byrne and his Talking Heads.\n\nFilmed at the peak of the band's popularity and following the release of Speaking in Tongues (which featured \"This Must Be The Place\" and \"Burning Down the House,\"), Stop Making Sense is a cult classic, from its array of hits to the band’s massive suits which became their calling card.\n\nThe film was re-released in theaters last month. \"I'm kind of looking at it and thinking, who is that guy?,\" said David Byrne in a recent interview with NPR about watching his younger self. \"I'm impressed with the film and impressed with our performance. But I'm also having this really jarring experience of thinking, ‘He's so serious.’\"\n\nBTS: Yet to Come in Cinemas (2023)\n\nWhile the GRAMMY-nominated South Korean superstars BTS may be on a break — Jung Kook recently announced that he will release his debut solo full-length- bask in the glow of the K-pop and their rollicking concert film earlier this year. In the film, Jung Kook alongside Jin, RM, Jimin, V, J-Hope as they smoothly perform their calvadace of hits, including \"Butter\" and\"Dynamite\" in a 2022 performance for Busan, South Korea’s rally to host the 2030 World Expo.\n\nThe boys are actually no stranger to the genre, with Yet To Come marking their fifth concert film in addition to BTS Permission to Dance on Stage — Seoul: Live Viewing and 2020’s Break the Silence: The Movie among others.\n\nMadonna: Truth or Dare (1991)\n\nWith off-stage footage shot in black and white and performances in vivid color, this early '90s classic depicts Queen Madge at the height of her power. Taken from an actual game Madonna and friends play towards the end of the film (to scandalous results), Truth or Dare showcases the breadth of Madonna’s superstardom up until that point with performances of classics like \"Holiday\" and \"Like a Virgin\" with its artfully-shot juxtaposition of performance and documentary footage a trailblazer in the concert film genre.\n\n\"The surprise of Truth or Dare is just what a blast Madonna is,\" wrote the Guardian on the occasion of the film’s 30th anniversary. \"Nastily funny, openly horny, undisguised in her contempt for anyone she deems less fabulous than herself and her blessed collaborators.\"\n\nJustin Bieber: Never Say Never (2011)\n\nWay before Swiftmania, there was Bieber Fever. In the wake of Justin Bieber’s explosive rise, Never Say Never interspersed performances with snapshots of his journey from humble Canadian roots to global pop force to be reckoned with.\n\nHelmed by Jon M. Chu (who’d go onto direct blockbusters like Crazy Rich Asians and In the Heights), Never Say Never is a time capsule of a younger, more innocent Bieber and his early earworm bubblegum hits. Until Swift's Eras is tallied it’s the top-grossing concert movie ever released in the USA.\n\nPrince: Sign o’ the Times (1987)\n\nThis iconic concert film was once hard to come by; after its theatrical run, Sign o’ the Times was only issued on VHS and eventually went out of print. But thanks to the magic of streaming, one can now easily transport oneself back to the '80s and enjoy the magic that is Prince.\n\nDirected by the artist and using his acclaimed 1987 album Sign o’ the Times as a jumping off point (the album itself was a 2017 inductee into the GRAMMY Hall of Fame), the film reminds viewers of the Purple One's magnetism. Under an array of colorful lights and performing to a raucous crowd, the icon may have died in 2016, but Sign o’ the Times serves as a deft time capsule of his royal talent.\n\nKaty Perry: Part of Me (2012)\n\nAs Katy Perry was in the midst of releasing her acclaimed album Teenage Dream, the pop singer had the foresight to chronicle the ensuing pandemonium.\n\n\"I feel like it was, like, a big wave coming,\" she told ABC upon the release of Katy Perry: Part of Me, the 2012 concert film that documented her blockbuster California Dreams tour. \"I thought to myself, 'Well, I think this is going to be a moment. Maybe I should catch it on tape. I'm either going to go completely mental, completely bankrupt, or have the best success of my life.\"\n\nFortunately the later wound up occurring, with the subsequent film a celebrity-packed (featuring everyone from Lady Gaga to Adele) hit-filled (\"Teenage Dream\" and \"California Girls\") look into the life, times and music of the star.\n\nQueen: Live at Wembley ‘86 (1986)\n\nFreddie Mercury and Queen were staples of London's Wembley Stadium, performing many memorable shows, including an iconic turn at Live Aid in the early '80s and a Mercury tribute show in the '90s.\n\nSongs like \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\" fit right in on Wembley's massive stage, with the concert film depicting the thundering live versions of those classics. Relive those heady days with this film which showcases just what made Mercury and his band rock icons, and huge ones at that.\n\n\"Mercury was indeed a born ringmaster,\" wrote CNN in a piece about their status as stadium savants. \"There was no alienating affectation, no wallowing in sentiment... Queen consciously wrote their songs as vehicles for theatrics.\"\n\nSummer of Soul (2021)\n\nBack in 1969, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Nina Simone and B.B. King joined forces for the Harlem Cultural Festival, a mostly forgotten multi-week legendary summit. That all changed when Roots frontman Ahmir \"Questlove\" Thompson obtained a treasure trove worth of footage and directed this stunning film, aptly dubbed Summer of Soul, which brought the event back to vivid life and subsequent acclaim including a GRAMMY Award for Best Music Film.\n\n\"It was gold,\" Thompson told Pitchfork of his process of sifting through the footage to create what would become a passion project. \"If anything, it was an embarrassment of riches. It was too much. I kept this on a 24-hour loop for about six months straight. Slept to it. Traveled to it. It was the only thing I consumed.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids (2016)\n\nAlso directed by Jonathan Demme and released before his 2017 death, Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids showcases Timberlake's popular 20/20 Experience World Tour and litany of solo hits including \"Sexyback\" and \"Suit & Tie.\"\n\n\"I don’t think anything can compete with live performance,\" admitted Demme to Rolling Stone before his death in 2017. \"You can’t beat it. But we strive to provide the most exciting interpretation of that feeling, as filmmakers. We can provide a roving best seat in the house. We can linger on closeups. We can follow the dynamics of the music. I love shooting music.\"\n\nThe Last Waltz (1978)\n\nOne of the earliest projects of director Martin Scorsese’s career was helping edit the monumental film version of Woodstock in 1970. But as that decade progressed and the auteur became known for narrative features including Mean Streets, he revisited his roots by directing The Last Waltz. A trailblazer in the genre, the film captures the last performance of The Band featuring frontman Robbie Robertson alongside a range of guests including Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr and Eric Clapton. Filmed on Thanksgiving Day in 1976, it’s a time capsule of the day’s biggest acts at the height of their artistry.\n\n\"It's a picture that kind of saved my life at the time,\" Scorsese told an audience at the Toronto International Film Festival during a 2019 screening. \"It's very special to me. Forty years on, it's very special to a great number of us.\"\n\n6 Must-Watch Hip-Hop Documentaries: 'Hip-Hop x Siempre,' 'My Mic Sounds Nice' & More\n\nAs we close out the month, this New Music Friday has loads of fresh beginnings and highly anticipated reunions.\n\nSeveral big-name collaborations dropped on Sept. 29, from an electric team-up of the Rolling Stones and Lady Gaga to an R&B and rap fusion from Jungkook and Jack Harlow.\n\nTwo nostalgic releases arrived as well, with Lil Wayne's new album Tha Fix Before Tha Vi continuing his \"Tha Carter\" series, while *NSYNC fans were treated to the boy band's first new song in 20 years with \"Better Place.\"\n\nDive into these seven new releases that blend the old generation with the new.\n\nJungkook ft. Jack Harlow — \"3D\"\n\nBTS singer Jungkook takes us through a nostalgic journey with \"3D,\" a song reminiscent of an early 2000s boy band hit. The hypnotizing lyrics illustrate his close connection to someone he can't reach, so he'll watch them in 3D.\n\n\"So if you're ready (So if you're ready)/ And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)/ I wanna see it in motion/ In 3D (Uh-uh),\" he sings in the chorus.\n\nJack Harlow pops in, dropping a few verses boasting about his global attraction with women. \"Mr. First Class\" claims he can \"fly you from Korea to Kentucky,\" as he closes out the song.\n\nWith an addictive chorus and groovy baseline, this track has a different vibe from his \"Seven\" collaboration with Latto. The song marks Jungkook's seventh solo single and second of 2023.\n\nRolling Stones & Lady Gaga ft. Stevie Wonder — \"Sweet Sounds of Heaven\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones, Lady Gaga and Stevie Wonder blended their talents, to create a harmonic symphony of a song that lives up to its heavenly title. Seven minutes of gospel- and blues-inspired rhythms, enriched by Gaga and Mick Jagger's distinct riffs, make this collaboration an immersive experience. Stevie Wonder grounds the track with his command of piano and melodic tempo.\n\nThe track is the second peek of the Rolling Stones' upcoming album, Hackney Diamonds, their first LP release in 18 years; their first release, \"Angry,\" arrived Sept. 6. With production from GRAMMY-winning Andrew Watt, the soulful essence makes \"Sweet Sounds of Heaven\" an exciting taste of the long-overdue album.\n\n*NSYNC — \"Better Place\"\n\nYes, you read correctly. After two decades and a recent reunion at the 2023 MTV Video Music awards, *NSYNC is back with a new single, \"Better Place,\" appearing in the new animated Trolls movie (due Nov. 17). With a nostalgic dance-pop beat, familiar production and breezy lyrics, this single is a remarkable comeback.\n\n\"Just let me take you to a better place/ I'm gonna make you kiss the sky tonight,\" they sing in the chorus.\n\nThe reunion was first teased Sept. 14, through a video of the group's emotional studio session, as Justin Timberlake shared on Instagram. \"When the stars align… got my brothers back together in the studio to work on something fun and the energy was special,\" he wrote in the post.\n\nPinkPantheress — \"Mosquito\"\n\nDive into this musical daydream as PinkPantheress serenades us on her new single, \"Mosquito,\" a dreamy, lucid song reminiscent of old-school R&B. After recently hopping on the energetic remix of Troye Sivan's \"Rush\" and teaming up with Destroy Lonely on \"Turn Your Phone Off,\" PinkPantheress is transporting us through a new era, full of charm and surprises.\n\n\"Cause I just had a dream I was dead/ And I only cared 'cause I was taken from you/ You're the only thing that I own/ I hear my bell ring, I'd only answer for you,\" she sings in the chorus.\n\nCo-crafted by GRAMMY-winning producer Greg Kurstin, this song is a transcending, surreal experience. This single isn't about romance, instead she takes us through her entanglements with treasures and money. That's further portrayed in the lavish video, which features a European shopping spree starring \"Bridgerton\" stars Charithra Chandran, India Amarteifio and \"Grown-ish\" star Yara Shahidi.\n\nEd Sheeran — Autumn Variations\n\nThe era of mathematical-themed albums seems to be over, as Ed Sheeran has entered a new chapter with Autumn Variations, his second project this year. Sheeran is singing from his heart, sharing soulful tales from emotional events in his life including the death of his dearest friend Jamal Edwards and his wife's health challenges during pregnancy — an extension of the stories he told with May's Subtract.\n\nAutumn Variations is very raw, stripped down and authentic as he takes us through his personal journey. Amidst this, Sheeran still brings in some buzzing tracks including catchy songs like \"American Town,\" \"Paper Bag\" and \"Amazing.\"\n\nLil Wayne — Tha Fix Before Tha Vi\n\nLil Wayne celebrated his 41st birthday with a special present to his fans: the release of a new album two days later. The alluring 10-track project,\"Tha Fix Before Tha Vi\" dives into past vibes with songs like \"Tity Boi,\" a reference to 2 Chainz's initial stage name, which may be a reference to the upcoming joint album between the two. Each song has a different feel including \"Tuxedo,\" which features a more punk-rock melody and \"Chanel No.5 ft. Foushee,\" which features a sensational beat.\n\nHis first album since 2020, Tha Fix Before Tha Vi features rather unexpected collaborators, including Jon Batiste, Fousheé and euro. With different sounds and features than past projects, we could possibly be entering a new Weezy era.\n\nThomas Rhett & Morgan Wallen — \"Mamaw's House\"\n\nCountry superstars Morgan Wallen and Thomas Rhett unite for \"Mamaw's House,\" a country-folk track relishing the memories of their grandparents' home and cozy fireplace tales.\n\n\"It's where I spent my summers and she put me to work/ Shellin' peas and shuckin' corn until my fingers hurt/ No tellin' who I'da been without Mamaw's house,\" Rhett sings in the second verse.\n\nRhett said the duo decided to write about their small-town culture — Rhett is from Valdosta, Georgia, while Wallen hails from Sneedville, Tennessee — and the significant presence of grandparents brought to their upbringings.\n\n\"This song just kind of brings up how our mamaws used to act when we were little kids,\" Rhett told Audacy.. \"It's an ode to all the grandmas out there.\"\n\n10 Ways Britney Spears' \"...Baby One More Time\" Changed Pop Music Forever"
