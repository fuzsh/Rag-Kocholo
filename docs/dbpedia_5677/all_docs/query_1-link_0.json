Rhett Akins had hit singles in the 1990s with \"That Ain't My Truck\" and \"Don't Get Me Started\" before becoming a songwriter at the beginning of the 21st century.[9]\n\nHe was raised in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[10] He grew up knowing other singers including Tim McGraw and Brooks & Dunn.[11] He has one younger sister,[12] and two younger half-brothers; one on his mother's side, and one his father's side.[13]\n\nAfter learning to play drums while attending junior high school, Rhett later would go onstage with his father and play. In high school, he was part of a band named The High Heeled Flip Flops.[14] Rhett went to Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, to study communications.[15] He dropped out of college when he was 20 to pursue a career in music.[16] He subsequently accepted a publishing deal by Big Machine Label Group to write songs.[11]\n\nCareer\n\nSongwriting\n\nRhett co-wrote the song \"I Ain't Ready to Quit\" on Jason Aldean's 2010 album My Kinda Party and signed a recording contract with Big Machine Records' Valory Music Group division in 2011.[17] The album's first 21 weeks were spent in the top 40 of the Billboard 200; it also has sold 1.7 million in its first years of release.[18] Rhett also co-wrote the 2013 singles \"1994\" by Jason Aldean, \"Parking Lot Party\" by Lee Brice, and \"Round Here\" by Florida Georgia Line.
