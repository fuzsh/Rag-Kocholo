        "text": "New Jeans is the debut EP by NewJeans.The EP was released digitally on August 1, 2022 and physically on August 8, 2022 with triple title tracks\"Attention\", \"Hype Boy\" and \"Cookie\" serving as the album's lead singles.\n\nBackground[]\n\nNewJeans’s first EP, New Jeans, poses the question, What direction should the group take to make good music?\n\nNewJeans’s music bucks the standard K-pop formula; the album is rooted in pop, but it doesn’t conform to any one particular style. The EP presents a sophisticated brand of pop—easy listening anywhere, anytime—and has been produced in a way that focuses on the members’ natural voices without overengineering their sound. The all-teenager lineup of NewJeans exudes a pure, effortless charm, and the four tracks off the album are brimming with the kind of energy reserved exclusively for youth. With a casual listen, it seems like every track dives into the kind of young love everyone the same age as the NewJeans members experiences, but when taken as a whole the EP looks at how life is for today’s teens, each song telling a different story and approaching them from a distinct musical angle, going beyond personal narratives to paint a collective portrait as well. The fact that New Jeans comes with a practically unprecedented three lead singles is a strong hint toward the direction the album takes.\n\nNewJeans takes an honest, uncontrived approach to their sound. Producer Min Hee-jin has always created innovative artist brands by going against the grain of the K-pop industry to set trends rather than follow them, and says that “pop music, like clothing, is a part of culture that is inseparable from our everyday lives.”\n\nJust as jeans have withstood the test of time and found popularity among everyone everywhere, here’s to New Jeans becoming an icon of a generation—one you keep coming back to daily and never tire of putting on! With that aspiration in their hearts, and their new genes engineered into the era, this marks the start of NewJeans.[1]\n\nEditions[]\n\nBluebook [Out Box (6 Versions)+Log Book (6 Versions)+Pin-up Book (6 Versions)+Phoning Manual Book (7ea)+CD (6 Versions)+ID Card (6 Versions)+Sticker Pack (6 Versions/3ea)+Photocards (6 Versions/5ea)+Mini Poster (6ea)]\n\nNewJeans ver.\n\nMinji ver.\n\nHanni ver.\n\nDanielle ver.\n\nHaerin ver.\n\nHyein ver.\n\nBag (limited only) [Bag (3 Versions)+Pin-up Book+CD+Photocards (5ea)]\n\nBlack ver.\n\nWhite ver.\n\nRed ver.\n\nWeverse Albums [Out Box+Lyrics+Photocards (Random/10ea out of 3 versions)+QR Card (Random/1ea out of 3 versions)]\n\nA ver.\n\nB ver.\n\nC ver.\n\nTracklist[]\n\n\"Attention\" Title - 3:00\n\n\"Hype Boy\" Title - 2:59\n\n\"Cookie\" Title - 3:55\n\n\"Hurt\" - 2:57\n\nAudio[]\n\nMusic Show Wins[]\n\nSong Program Date \"Attention\" M Countdown (Mnet) August 18, 2022 Music Bank (KBS2) August 19, 2022 Show!
