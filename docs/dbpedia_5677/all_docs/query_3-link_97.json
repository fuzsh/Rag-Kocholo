        "text": "The managers of country music stars wear countless hats when carrying out duties for their clients — but co-writing one of their hit songs, generally, is not one of them.\n\nThat's what happened, however, with George Strait's 1996 single \"I Can Still Make Cheyenne.\" His manager, Erv Woolsey, told songwriter Aaron Barker about an idea he had for a tune. It would be about a traveling rodeo man who calls his wife/girlfriend from the road, only to learn she's had it with him and is moving on to someone new.\n\nHis response? \"There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss/ But it's all right baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne\" — referring to Cheyenne Frontier Days, the famed annual rodeo held in Wyoming.\n\nBarker told the Story Behind the Song to Bart Herbison of Nashville Songwriters Association International.\n\nHerbison: The great Aaron Barker co-wrote — along with Erv Woolsey, who's George Strait's manager — one of my favorite George Strait songs, \"I Can Still Make Cheyenne.\" And I’ve got to tell you, Mr. Barker, I re-read the lyrics this morning before we did this, and a little moisture appeared in my eyes. I'm just saying. Man, what a story. How did this thing evolve?\n\nBarker: Well, Erv and I were good friends for a long time. He's a Texan. I'm a Texan. And we're both out here in Nashville. And we ran together a lot. I couldn't keep up with him. But we did spend a lot of time together outside of work. And sometimes in the late nights, he would start talking. He told me, he had this (song) idea about this cowboy who calls home and says, \"I'm gonna come home.\" His wife or girlfriend or whatever just says, \"Don't even come home. You're gone all the time. I'm out of here.\" And that the cowboy kind of says, “Well, fine then! I'll just move on to the next rodeo,\" and it would have been Cheyenne. So that was the kind of the genesis of this song. And it bounced around out of Erv for a couple of years. I didn't quite lock on to where he was headed with it. I'm not a cowboy. I didn't get that life. But as George introduced me to the rodeo thing — because George is big into that — I would see that lifestyle and understand more about it.\n\nBH: You think the NFL is tough? Get on a bucking horse or a bull. I rode a bull one time, Aaron. You know why I never did it again? Because I'm smart.\n\nAB: When you look at it on TV, it's one thing, but boy, when you get up (there). ... I also realized the connection between the roper and the horse. It's unbelievable. I got familiar with some of that lifestyle, talking with these rodeo guys, and realized how similar it was to my rock 'n' roll years. Being on the road, you're never home. And there's this tremendous toll you pay for that.\n\nI put all that together, and I did write the song, technically, on my own. I wrote it in a hotel room here in Nashville. One night, it finally all clicked, and I loved it, man. I don't like my own work very much, but boy, when this played back, I got it.\n\nI played it for Erv, and he corrected a couple of my technical things that I wasn't familiar with. For example, in the song it says, \"Didn't make the short go again.\" I didn't know what a \"short go\" was. I had the word \"finals\" in there. That made sense to me. ... He said \"No, it's the short go.” He corrected some of that technical language, so it was a collaboration\n\nBH: What have the cowboys said to you about it? These are tough characters, but I'm guessing that one of the rare times we might get a glimpse of emotion (from them) is when they talk about this song.\n\nAB: Yeah, it kind of became an anthem for them out at the National Finals Rodeo. It might still be. I haven't been back. But one night, during the finals, I was out in Vegas with George and Erv, and they also managed Clay Walker at the time. ... Clay was playing some big venue.\n\nErv said \"Let's go see him before George's show.\" We're sitting out there and Clay called me up to perform something. Well this room, Bart, was a sea of hats, that whole audience. And when I started that song, that room went dead silent. And all these hats were still. It was kind of spooky. But about halfway through the song, I heard mumbling, and then I heard a voice go, \"Shut up, or I'll knock your head off.\" Nobody was allowed to speak during that song (laughs).\n\nBH: You could have never gotten a better compliment ever.\n\nAB: No, that's as good as it gets.\n\nAbout the series\n\nIn partnership with Nashville Songwriters Association International, the \"Story Behind the Song\" video interview series features Nashville-connected songwriters discussing one of their compositions.
