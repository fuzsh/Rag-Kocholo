Through the years, NewSong's line-up changed.\n\nThe band knew many successes but nothing quite like the phenomenon of its song, \"The Christmas Shoes,\" released in 2000.\n\nIt is the story of a poor, little boy wanting to purchase a pair of shoes as a Christmas gift for his dying mother.\n\nThe holiday song became NewSong's biggest hit, crossing over from traditional Christian radio and fans to mainstream radio and listeners. The song led to a book and then a movie starring actor Rob Lowe.\n\n\"The Christmas Shoes\" introduced NewSong, the band and its music, to millions of new listeners. Carswell recalled the song crossing over to other formats, such as pop and country radio.\n\n\"We would talk with some of these DJs and they had no idea who we were,\" Carswell said in a past interview with The Times. \"They would ask how it felt to come from out of nowhere and have this hit and we had several hits and been playing and recording for 20 years. It was interesting.\""
