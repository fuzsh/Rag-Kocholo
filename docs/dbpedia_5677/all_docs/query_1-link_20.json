        "text": "The fourth installment of the ExploreGeorgia.org Songwriter Series on Fri. Oct 7, 2016 at the Albany Museum of Art features Cole Taylor, Travis Denning and Trea Landon, three young Georgians making their marks in country music. The intimate in-the-round style concert kicks off at 8 p.m. with an opening acoustic set by popular Albany musicians Bo Henry, who leads the Bo Henry Band; singer/songwriter Jodi Mann; and Stephen Harrell, who fronts The Dusty Boots Band. Tickets are $15 in advance here and $20 at the door.\n\nThough the southwest corner of Georgia is well known for its pine forests and peanut fields, the region also boasts an incredibly rich music heritage with American music icons Ray Charles and Otis Redding, jazz and swing pioneer Fletcher Henderson, bandleader Harry James, country superstar Luke Bryan, American Idol Season 11 winner Phillip Phillips, and two hit songwriters, Country Music Hall of Famer Boudleaux Bryant and Dallas Davidson, all having been born in the area.\n\nCole Taylor, whose father is a deer processor and taxidermist, grew up on the family farm in Cuthbert, Georgia. He made his first cd at age 16 in Gary DiBenedetto’s Moultrie recording studio and credits local venues who gave him an opportunity to play live. “I just remember playing in Albany at whatever place would give me a chance when I was 17 years old,” he says. “Austin’s BBQ, One Trick Pony, The Mellow Mushroom and right outside of Albany was the Sasser Flea Market where I opened up for a ton of artists and that was huge for me getting in front of people.”\n\nAlthough he attended Valdosta State University, Taylor left just 13 hours shy of earning his degree in accounting to try his hand in Nashville. The decision proved well-founded, however, as Taylor landed a deal with Universal Publishing Group less than a year after arriving, and in 2015, he co-wrote his first #1 hit, “Sippin’ on Fire,” for Florida Georgia Line, and quickly followed it with a second chart-topper, “Home Alone Tonight,” Luke Bryan’s duet with Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town.\n\nTaylor, Travis Denning and Jon Langston—all Georgia boys—were just announced as openers for select dates on fellow Georgian Cole Swindell’s upcoming Down Home Tour, presented by CMT On Tour, and kicking off Oct. 26. For Denning, who was raised in Bonaire, the Swindell tour caps off a year of career milestones that includes a slew of co-writing credits— “Everybody We Know Does,” the new single by Chase Rice, two cuts on Justin Moore’s brand new album, Kinda Don’t Care and a cut on Jason Aldean’s highly anticipated new album, They Don’t Know, out Sept. 9.\n\n“The song is called “All Out Of Beer,” Jason’s dad Barry played it for him over Thanksgiving of 2014, and he immediately put it on hold,” Denning says. “I think it just fits right in the wheelhouse of what he does so well as an artist, and I’m very fortunate he felt that way too.”\n\nJust over a year ago, 21-year-old Trea Landon left his hometown of Claxton and the following he’d built in Statesboro for his band, for Nashville. Within a month of arriving, he signed a deal with Play It Again Publishing, owned by Albany native Dallas Davidson, who has more than 20 #1 hits under his belt and says of Landon, “I definitely see a bright future ahead of him.”\n\nLandon says of his mentor, “Dallas has influenced me, helping me grow as a songwriter and on the business side of the industry, by watching him, I’m learning what to do and what not to do.” When asked what he misses most about Georgia these days, Landon quips, “Everything I sing about.”\n\nConcertgoers will also get to check out The Albany Museum of Art’s current exhibition, Motion Forward: Street Style featuring the work of two Brooklyn, New York artists: JM Rizzi, a neo-abstract expressionist and muralist who has worked with famed street artists Banksy, Shepard Fairey and Jean-Michel Basquiat; and Tony “Rubin” Sjöman, a Swedish artist who is considered a staple in the New York City street art scene and whose first book, Rubin: New York/Scandinavia was published in May of 2016. The Albany Museum of Art is located at 311 Meadowlark Drive. The ExploreGeorgia.org Songwriter Series will continue on Nov. 19 at the Holly Theatre in Dahlonega with Pat Alger, Tony Arata and Amy Ray and culminate on Dec. 2 at the Douglass Theatre in Macon for a summit of songwriting keyboardists featuring Lloyd Buchanan, Lola Gulley and Ike Stubblefield.\n\nALBANY, Ga. — Asked to describe the essence of their recently completed musical masterpiece, “See the Sunrise,” some members of local mainstays the Bo Henry Band are at a loss for words.\n\nDrummer Tim Carter loosens his reluctant bandmates’ reticence when he offers, “The album’s like a nice bowl of gumbo with a lot of spices thrown in. There’s a lot there to eat.”\n\nBassist Terry Stubbs has his own unique take: “I like the idea that if you turn (the album) up all the way, it gives you a nice sonic cleanse.”\n\nNext up, percussionist Mark Brimberry: “This album is a kaleidoscope; all the songs are different. It takes me back to our first album, what, 15 years ago? And it proves that old saying that the more things change, the more they stay the same.”\n\nLeave it to the band’s namesake, though, to cut to the essence of the question.\n\n“This album is like this band … We ain’t country and we ain’t exactly rock; we ain’t Southern rock and we ain’t soul and we ain’t an oldies band and we ain’t bluegrass …,” Bo Henry says as he ponders the query. “But we’re all of that. We’re whatever we feel on any given night.\n\n“I guess the album is just us, it’s who we are.”\n\nThe Bo Henry Band has existed for more than 15 years, a loose and ever-changing collection of some of the region’s best musicians that is as flannel-clad laid-back, yet musically accomplished, as the man whose name is on the marquee. BHB have recorded two other albums over their decade and a half together, but neither approaches “Sunrise’s” stark introspection.\n\nOn songs like the Brandon Fox-penned and sung “Shady Lane” — a tribute to the masterful guitarist’s recently passed father — and the Henry remembrance “Old Oak Tree,” the two integral musicians/songwriters in the nine-man group offer personal glimpses they rarely reveal onstage.\n\n“It wasn’t part of the plan to put (‘Shady Lane’) on the album,” Fox said. “But Bo heard it and said we ought to put it on there. It’s not really the kind of song you play in a bar or at a frat party.”\n\nThere are no throw-aways on “See the Sunrise” — the title track of which is a wistful Henry look at a time of the day the band often sees as it’s returning home from a weekend of playing — and tunes like “Down to Mexico,” “The Dealer,” “Greasy Headed Granny” and the Buck Bradshaw-sung “I’m Feelin’ Better” combine with “Shady Lane” and “Old Oak Tree” to paint perhaps the perfect portrait of the Bo Henry Band, circa 2012.\n\n“The song ‘I’m Feelin’ Better‘ is kind of what we’re all about,” Henry said. “It was a story I was telling, but it just seemed to be a song that fit Buck’s voice better. As it turned out, it fits what he does better than if I’d sung it.”\n\nThroughout “See the Sunrise,” there are flourishes — little touches here and there — that allow all BHB members to shine. Whether it’s the subtle but perfectly placed horns of sax man Jon Wills and trumpeter Joe Maxey on “Mexico;” Fox and Kent Dowling’s Allman Brothers-esque twin guitar mix on “Sunset” or their solos on “Shady Lane” (Dowling) and “Granny” (Fox); Bradshaw’s piano and organ work (the former on “Sunrise,” the latter on “The Dealer”); the “guest” steel guitar by Kyle Everson on “Old Oak Tree;” or the tight rhythm section of Stubbs, Carter, Brimberry and Henry fit perfectly by engineer Dennis Frazier throughout the mix, these are accomplished musicians doing what they do best.\n\n“Dennis was great to work with,” Henry said. “He really made us comfortable in the studio. We did most of the songs live, and he gave us the option of listening through headphones or having a monitor in front of us like we do when we play a live show.”\n\nAdded Stubbs: “Recording this album was a great experience for us. We had the chance to look at each other, to interact while we were playing. People may not like every song on this album, but there’s enough different stuff that there’s going to be at least two or three songs everyone will like.”\n\nWhat’s not to like about a band that, when confronted by Montgomery cops responding to a noise complaint, cracks the officers up by going immediately into the “Bad Boys” them from TV’s “Cops?” A crew that spent the last weekend traveling several hundred miles to shows in Macon Thursday, Tuscaloosa, Ala., Friday and Pensacola, Fla., Saturday, only to make it home in the wee hours of Sunday morning (seeing another sunrise) so they can be home with their families?\n\n“We’re proud of this album,” Henry said. “If we sell out all the copies we have, great. If we don’t sell a one, no problem. At least we’ll have the music out there, and we’ll be happy we made it. It’s something we’ll leave behind.”\n\nFans can pick up their own copies of “See the Sunrise” tonight when BHB hold an album-release celebration at Henry’s Harvest Moon restaurant.\n\n“The only reason this band is called the ‘Bo Henry Band’ is back when we started this and me and Terry and Matt were playing at a local restaurant, they put ‘Bo Henry’s Band’ on the marquee. But this is not my band. This is our band.\n\n“When we play a show, we don’t leave some folks out so we can maybe make a little more money. We bring the boys. Us together, that’s what makes this band. We wouldn’t be the same without the whole.”\n\nA nice bowl of gumbo indeed.\n\nAlbany Herald:\n\nJuly 03–ALBANY — Although he never served, Albany entrepreneur Bo Henry holds a special place in his heart for military veterans and the sacrifices they make in the name of freedom, which inspired the musician to write a song in their honor.\n\n“I’ve never been in the military, but I have the utmost respect for anybody who is and I know that they’re the reason that America is free and stays free,” said Henry. “It’s them and the many, many before. I still believe in America, and I’m thankful every day for the freedom we have.”\n\nIt was thoughts about those who serve and the fact that they give their lives to protect the country that inspired Henry to write “Hero,” a new song he recently recorded and released.\n\nThe musician said he woke up early on Memorial Day this year and, as is often the case when his family is still asleep, he ventured out to his music room and started playing the piano. What came from that session is a song the singer/songwriter said he is very proud of.\n\n“I was just thinking about America and just had a little patriotic moment,” said Henry. “I started playing the piano, and it just came right to me. I wrote it right then; it was about 7:30, 8 o’clock in the morning on Memorial Day.”\n\nHenry sat on the song for a bit, intending to record it with his band, the Bo Henry Band. But as Independence Day neared, he decided he needed to get the song recorded and release in time for the holiday.\n\nJust last week, Henry decamped to Ed McCree’s Albany Music Studio and began recording the tune with just his acoustic guitar, before fully fleshing out the tune with additional instruments.\n\n“I was originally just going to play acoustic and sing it, but when I finished playing it acoustic, I put bass with it, then I put a piano with it, then I played drums and just kept going from one instrument to the next,” he said. “Then I got my youngest sister, Kristin Culpepper, to go out with me the next night, and she sang harmony and back-up on it with me.”\n\nHenry immediately released the song, which is currently available at cdbaby.com and will soon be available on iTunes and other digital music sites.\n\nEven though the version that’s out now is a solo effort, Henry said he does intend to revisit the tune and record it with the entire Bo Henry Band.\n\n“This time I was on a little time crunch and wanted to get it done before the Fourth of July, so I just recorded everything,” he said. “Hopefully, I’ll go back and eventually do it with the band. I do play other instruments but not as well as the guys in my band play.”\n\nIn addition to penning the song as a tribute to military veterans, Henry said he plans to donate some of the proceeds from the sale of the single, although he admits he isn’t sure how much the song might make.\n\n“I’m going to give 10 percent of the gross to nonprofit military organizations that help wounded or fallen veterans or their families,” Henry said. “I haven’t decided which one it will be yet, and it might not be just one. I’m not expecting it to be some huge amount, but I do my part. There’s tons of good organizations out there, and I would probably try to help them all a little bit if it brings in anything.”\n\nFor those who have not yet heard the tune, “Hero” focuses on a fictional character born into a family with a military history. The main character never knew his father, who had gone off to war and lost his life before he was born. The son eventually turns 18 and joins the military as well, and ultimately loses his life in combat.\n\nThe son’s mother, when told the news of his death, isn’t angry but feels a sense of peace because she knows her son did what he felt he should do and is finally reunited with his hero, his father.\n\n“It’s not a true story, but it is something that could happen,” said Henry. “We’re so lucky to have people that go and fight for us. I’m sitting here in a restaurant working while somebody overseas is protecting us so that me and my wife and my son can be living in a free country.”\n\nHenry will perform “Hero” in front a large crowd for the first time today when he joins other local acts Mopeland and Unbreakable Bloodline, along with blues and R&B legend Clarence Carter, at the city of Albany’sFourth of July concert at Veterans Park Amphitheatre in advance of the city’s downtown fireworks display.\n\nHenry said that, in addition to revisiting the track with the rest of the Bo Henry Band, the group is currently working on material for a new CD it hopes to release in the near future.\n\n“We’re working on songs to put out on a new CD soon,” he said. “We’ve got the material, we just have to get it recorded.”"
