        "text": "Fresh off of winning two Grammys, Christian rap artist Lecrae said he likes performing in the South because it is full of soul and feeling.\n\nLecrae is touring the region and will perform at 7 p.m. on Friday, Feb. 23, at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena, 650 N. Academy St., Greenville. He will perform at Winter Jam 2024, a free Christian-based concert, although a $15 donation is suggested at the door.\n\nLecrae won 2 Grammy Awards on Sunday\n\nDavid Crowder headlines the Christian music concert series. Crowder is a 2023 Grammy nominee for Best Contemporary Christian Performance/Song with \"God Really Loves Us.\"\n\nLecrae recently won two 2024 Grammy Awards Sunday for Contemporary Christian Album with \"Church Clothes 4\" and Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song with \"Your Power\" alongside Tasha Cobb.\n\nLecrae said 'South is full of soul.'\n\nLecrae last visited Greenville in 2014 and said he has memories of his last visit involving good food and authenticity from the Southern crowd.\n\n\"The South is full of soul, and it's a region that's not trying to be heady or trendy,\" said Lecrae, a Texas native. \"It's about appealing to the roots and being around not easily fooled people. The South welcomes that soulfulness and depth of feeling, and I feel that my music is appealing to the soul.\"\n\nLecrae's music crossover of traditional rap, Christ-conscious music\n\nHis music immerses optimism and spirituality and the sound of traditional rap and hip-hop. Lecrae's music is a crossover between traditional rap and Christ-conscious music.\n\n\"We love to put people in boxes, but I try to be honest,\" said Lecrae. \"I love God, but I'm also a product of hip-hop culture. When it's used well, it's an expression of what's happening in our world. I'm not here to do any exploitation. I want to bring hope and light and to uplift the city.\"\n\nLecrae made a music video cameo with Kendrick Lamar\n\nLecrae's authenticity has crossed over into the traditional rap and hip-hop industry. He has worked with legendary Southern rap/hip-hop producer Zaytoven on a music project titled \"Let the Trap Say Amen\" and has worked with other rap contributors such as Don Cannon and Malice of The Clipse. Lecrae also appeared in a music video cameo alongside rap icon Kendrick Lamar.\n\nThe 44-year-old gained national notoriety around the time the BI-LO Center became the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in 2013. That same year, Lecrae won a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album for \"Gravity\" and followed up in 2014 with \"Anomaly,\" which debuted at Number One on the Billboard 200.\n\nWinter Jam Tour will feature six artists\n\nLecrae is part of the six-artist Winter Jam tour, which began in 1995 by NewSong, a Valdosta, Georgia, Grammy and GMA Dove Award nominee group. The concert has grown into a bi-coastal celebration of Christian music.\n\n\"The lineup looks incredible this year,\" said Crowder of the upcoming Christian-based concert. \"Some of my favorite folks will be there, and I am beyond excited to be back out there singing to God together.\"\n\nJoining Lecrae and Crowder are the Contemporary Christian threesome of CAIN, 2023 Gospel Music Association Dove Award winner Kathy Nichole, Texas native band Seventh Day Slumber.\n\nFor more information on this concert, visit the Bon Secours Wellness Arena website at BonSecoursArena.com.\n\nâ€“ A.J.
