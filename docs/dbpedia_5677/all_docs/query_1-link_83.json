They soon found out, as 20,000\n\npeople turned out.\n\nThe festival has since emerged as\n\na Northern California favorite, drawing approximately 80,000 people per year.\n\nIt's organized and executed by volunteers who perform duties ranging from beverage\n\nsales to pet-sitting, food preparation to child care, stage setup to security.\n\nProceeds are shared by area charities,\n\nbased on the number of hours its volunteers put in. In 2002, the Asparagus Festival\n\nwas able to distribute more than $206,000 among the dozens of charities involved.\n\nOver the past 17 years, nearly $2.4 million has been contributed.\n\n* PERSPECTIVE: In addition to asparagus\n\nprepared every conceivable way, this weekend's festivities feature three stages\n\nof music, wine and beer pavilion nearly 100 food and crafts vendors, children's\n\nactivities in the AsparaZone, the Got Milk? Gravity Tour, celebrity chefs, cooking\n\ndemonstrations, a classic car show, farmers market, Skyy Dog, the Tech Zone,\n\nthe Home and Garden Pavilion, and an asparagus-tossing competition.\n\n* STARSHIP FEATURING MICKEY THOMAS\n\n-- Thomas made his mark in 1976 as lead singer on the Elvin Bishop hit \"Fooled\n\nAround and Fell in Love.\" He later joined Starship and led the band through\n\nits hit-making heyday, his vocals powering the singles \"Jane,\" \"No Way Out,\"\n\n\"We Built This City\" and \"Sara.\" These days, Thomas tours with a reconstituted\n\nStarship featuring Jeff Adams and Mark Abrahamian (guitars, Phil Bennett (keyboards\n\nand Darrell Verdusco (drums.\n\n* NEWSONG -- This Christian group,\n\nknown for such songs as \"Arise, My Love,\" \"Miracles,\" and \"Jesus to the World\n\n(Roaring Lambs,\" has scored 17 No. — singles and six Dove Award nominations.\n\nFormed at Morningside Baptist Church in Valdosta, Ga., NewSong's lineup features\n\nEddie Carswell, Billy Goodwin, Michael O'Brien, Steve Reischl and Matt Butler.\n\n* ROSE ROYCE -- This Grammy-winning\n\nRB group made a name for itself with its debut album, the soundtrack to\n\nthe movie \"Car Wash.\" The album sold more than a million copies and kicked off\n\na career that has included the hits \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore,\" \"Do Your\n\nDance,\" \"I'm In Love,\" \"I Wanna Get Next to You\" and \"Wishing on a Star.\" Rose\n\nRoyce features Kenny Copeland (vocals, trumpet, Richie Benson (vocals, Freddie\n\nDunn (trumpet, Walter McKinney (guitar, Mike Moore (saxophone and Henry Garner\n\n(drums.\n\n* DOUBLE FUNK CRUNCH -- This Bay\n\nArea group specializes in reviving the high spirits of '70s funk through costumes,\n\nskits and a repertoire of the era's best tunes.\n\n* DADDY-O -- Since its inception\n\nin 1970, this group has been combining comedy and dance with a repertoire of\n\nfavorite tunes from the 1950s and '60s.\n\nMain Stage\n\nTODAY\n\nNoon -- Daddy-O\n\n2:45 p.m. -- Double Funk Crunch\n\nSATURDAY\n\n12:30 p.m. -- Rose Royce\n\n3:30 p.m. -- Nelson\n\nSUNDAY\n\n— p.m. -- NewSong\n\n3:30 p.m. -- Starship featuring Mickey Thomas\n\nBlues Stage\n\nTODAY\n\n2 p.m. -- Studebaker Blues Band\n\nSATURDAY\n\n1:15 p.m. -- Greg Barker and Highway 61\n\n3:45 p.m. -- Delta Wires\n\nSUNDAY\n\n1:15 p.m. -- Lara Price Blues Band\n\n3:45 p.m. -- Bay Area Blues Society Caravan of All Stars\n\nFamily Stage\n\nTODAY\n\n11:30 a.m. -- San Joaquin Storyteller's Guild\n\n12:30 p.m. -- Search and Rescue\n\n— p.m. -- Brickhead\n\n2 p.m. -- Kool Katz\n\n— p.m. -- Signature\n\n3:30 p.m. -- Jarred Senses\n\n4:30 p.m. -- Search and Rescue\n\n5 p.m. -- Fullness of Joy\n\nSATURDAY\n\n11 a.m. -- West Coast Martial Arts\n\n11:30 a.m. -- Gymnastics\n\n— p.m. -- 720 Cheer\n\n2 p.m. -- West Coast Martial Arts\n\n2:30 p.m. -- Swanners\n\n— p.m. -- Spun\n\n4 p.m. -- Samraw\n\n4:30 p.m. -- North of Disorder\n\nSUNDAY\n\n11 a.m. -- West Coast Martial Arts\n\n11:30 a.m. -- Swanners\n\nNoon -- Kool Katz\n\n— p.m. -- Sirens in Sanity\n\n1:30 p.m. -- Gymnastics\n\n2 p.m. -- 720 Cheer\n\n— p.m. -- Brickhead\n\n4 p.m. -- Spun\n\n5 p.m. -- Floor Mechanics\n\nPHOTO: Mickey Thomas from Starship\n\n© 2003 The Record, a division\n\nof World Companies, Inc."
