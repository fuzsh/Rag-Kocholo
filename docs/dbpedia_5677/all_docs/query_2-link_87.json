        "text": "The Neighbors\n\nHow wealthy a neighborhood is, from very wealthy, to middle income, to low income is very formative with regard to the personality and character of a neighborhood. Equally important is the rate of people, particularly children, who live below the federal poverty line. In some wealthy gated communities, the areas immediately surrounding can have high rates of childhood poverty, which indicates other social issues. NeighborhoodScout's analysis reveals both aspects of income and poverty for this neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the Valdosta State University neighborhood in Valdosta are low income, making it among the lowest income neighborhoods in America. NeighborhoodScout's research shows that this neighborhood has an income lower than 91.7% of U.S. neighborhoods. In addition, 7.9% of the children seventeen and under living in this neighborhood are living below the federal poverty line, which is a lower rate of childhood poverty than is found in 56.2% of America's neighborhoods.\n\nA neighborhood is far different if it is dominated by enlisted military personnel rather than people who earn their living by farming. It is also different if most of the neighbors are clerical support or managers. What is wonderful is the sheer diversity of neighborhoods, allowing you to find the type that fits your lifestyle and aspirations.\n\nIn the Valdosta State University neighborhood, 38.2% of the working population is employed in executive, management, and professional occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants, with 23.7% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations (21.8%), and 16.4% in manufacturing and laborer occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is shared learned behavior. We learn it from our parents, their parents, our houses of worship, and much of our culture – our learned behavior – comes from our ancestors. That is why ancestry and ethnicity can be so interesting and important to understand: places with concentrations of people of one or more ancestries often express those shared learned behaviors and this gives each neighborhood its own culture. Even different neighborhoods in the same city can have drastically different cultures.\n\nIn the Valdosta State University neighborhood in Valdosta, GA, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as Irish (8.7%). There are also a number of people of English ancestry (7.7%), and residents who report German roots (7.1%), and some of the residents are also of Sub-Saharan African ancestry (3.0%), along with some African ancestry residents (3.0%), among others.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nEven if your neighborhood is walkable, you may still have to drive to your place of work. Some neighborhoods are located where many can get to work in just a few minutes, while others are located such that most residents have a long and arduous commute. The greatest number of commuters in Valdosta State University neighborhood spend under 15 minutes commuting one-way to work (55.1% of working residents), one of the shortest commutes across America.\n\nHere most residents (70.6%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In addition, quite a number also hop out the door and walk to work to get to work (9.4%) and 6.2% of residents also carpool with coworkers, friends, or neighbors for their daily commute. In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
