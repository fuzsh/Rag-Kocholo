        "text": "[Source]\n\nA Canada-based rapper has sparked controversy over the lyrics of his recently released track.\n\nHow it started: To promote his new song “Suki,” Eric Reprid uploaded a short clip of himself performing parts of it on Instagram. The video, which has since been reposted on other social media platforms, shows the 25-year-old rapper eating ramen while singing into a ceiling microphone.\n\nControversial lyrics: In addition to Reprid’s eye-catching performance, viewers took notice of his song's lyrics, which included a gendered slur (b*tch) and a racial slur (ch*nk). However, what ignited the most discussion on social media was the line \"I f*ck so much p*ssy, I might switch to b*ssy.\"\n\nTrending on NextShark: Angela Chao, CEO of US-based shipping company Foremost Group, dead at 50\n\nThe term “b*ssy,” which combines the words “boy” and “p*ssy,” is a slang used by members of the LGBTQ+ community for the anus.\n\nWhat netizens are saying: Reprid's clip has circulated across social media platforms, drawing comments from confused users. Some said they could not believe what they heard.\n\n“I dont think I heard that clearly…. U gonna do what?” one U user wrote.\n\nTrending on NextShark: S. Korean YouTuber Tzuyang apologizes for imitation of Filipina in 'racist' mukbang video\n\n“That line was a choice,” commented another.\n\nOthers wondered whether the rapper was aware of the term’s meaning.\n\n“I don't think he knows what b*ssy means,” an X user suggested.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Hermes hands $4,300 bonus to all 22,000 staff after strong late 2023 Asia sales\n\n“I really don't think he knows not what he says.” another chimed in.\n\nAbout the artist: Reprid, also known as Shi Yi Liu, has been an active musician since 2017. Despite being an independent artist, his previous release, \"Cold World,\" earned him a nomination for \"Rap Recording of the Year\" at the 2021 Juno Awards.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Pakistani British teen with IQ higher than Einstein's calls for more support for gifted students\n\nDownload the NextShark App:"
