        "text": "Sing The National Anthem\n\nFrancis Scott Key was a gifted amateur poet. Inspired by the sight of the American flag flying over Fort McHenry the morning after the bombardment, he scribbled the initial verse of his song on the back of a letter. Back in Baltimore, he completed the four verses (PDF) and copied them onto a sheet of paper, probably making more than one copy. A local printer issued the new song as a broadside. Shortly afterward, two Baltimore newspapers published it, and by mid-October it had appeared in at least seventeen other papers in cities up and down the East Coast.\n\nThis 19th century version (MP3) of the Star-Spangled Banner was performed on original instruments from the National Museum of American History's collection. Arranged by G. W. E. Friederich, the music is played as it would have been heard in 1854.\n\nThe Star-Spangled Banner\n\nO say can you see, by the dawn’s early light,\n\nWhat so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming,\n\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight\n\nO’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming?\n\nAnd the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\n\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there,\n\nO say does that star-spangled banner yet wave\n\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n\nOn the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep\n\nWhere the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,\n\nWhat is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,\n\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\n\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,\n\nIn full glory reflected now shines in the stream,\n\n’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave\n\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\n\nAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore,\n\nThat the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion\n\nA home and a Country should leave us no more?\n\nTheir blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution.\n\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\n\nFrom the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,\n\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\n\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nO thus be it ever when freemen shall stand\n\nBetween their lov’d home and the war’s desolation!\n\nBlest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land\n\nPraise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation!\n\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\n\nAnd this be our motto - “In God is our trust,”\n\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\n\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave."
