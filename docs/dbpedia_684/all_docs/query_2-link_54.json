        "text": "Google & Yahoo’s new email sender requirements went into effect on Feb. 1. You’re not alone if you’re feeling confused about what they are! Join Patty for this session where she and Consultants for Good review the new 3-part rules in detail, and walk you through easy steps to make sure your emails are in compliance -- and not being sent to spam! Come to the webinar with your DNS (domain name servers) ready so that you can make changes on the spot. After the session, you should have no fears about your compliance status. Note: If your email list is smaller than 5000 addresses, this is not a requirement for you, but it is highly recommended that you follow these best practices to help with your deliverability! Plus! It’s free for our friends. Use the code “PURPOSE” at registration: https://lnkd.in/ettYFGKm #ElevateYourCause #Webinar #EmailMarketing\n\nLot's of people get this wrong about cold email... Folks often get confused after the fancy talk behind IPs and Private servers, especially with so many providers popping up lately, so here's everything you need to know about them: 🎯 TL;DR: The IP is the main variable between your email landing in inbox or spam. ✉️ Servers: They take care of all the DNS settings (authentication you NEED to do), sending, receiving, and storing your data – However, they don’t play that big of a role when it comes to deliverability. 🖥️ IPs: The direction and reputation (main variable of deliverability), the server sends email from – If you send from a high-trust IP, you’ll reach the inbox. IP's are the first thing the email crawlers on your recipients end see before even looking at the content you are sending to determine if it’s good to get into the inbox or not. Think of it like this: You get a letter from a kid riding a bike, but the letter says it comes from the “Queen’s Palace” 🏰. Naturally you read the letter because it comes from a trust-worthy and high-ranking place, and don’t even pay attention to the kid who gave you the letter. The Queen’s Palace is the IP, while the kid giving you the letter is the server. On the other hand, you can have the same kid at your door giving you a letter, but it says it comes from “Frankie’s Pub” – You might read it, but will probably put it in the pile with all the other unread letters because “who even is Frankie’s Pub?” ...The takeaway? A royal IP opens doors to inboxes, while the server is merely the courier. So if someone is only promising \"private servers\" and not talk about high-ranking *dedicated* IPs, be careful, even private servers + a limited pool of people clumped together in a few IPs can give you trouble. PS: Yes, I made that analogy myself ;) – Will be sharing more about this in the next few days. If you have a question about this, let me know! PSS: Yes, you can make that analogy changing the Palace with the SEC, I'm sure you'd read all their letters 😉\n\nNo email? It's DNS - It's always DNS... And yes it was true - after a small dig into the problem... get it? dig? Sigh... Dig is a tool that allows you to look at DNS servers; and there was the problem with 🔔🔔🔔 bells on - many and flashing red 🚨 lights. As obvious and easy to fix as .. making a cup of tea. The problem though is that it wasn't for me to fix it - don't get me wrong custom domain + email is easy - it's one entry pointing at the mail server... Replacing that though would have meant lost email and not the it's got wrapped up in spam kinda way and no one likes that. The point of this story? I've just finished creating a utility to move emails from one server to another or save them out, so you can change provider and keep all those twitter notifications. (Yeah ok there is ducktape involved, but IMAPI client woop) Yes there was a reason for creating it. But I admit it was fun. The question is, is this actually any use? What do you think..."
