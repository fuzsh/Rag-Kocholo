        "text": "The teachers at this school are caring and engaging, but they are led by incompetent district employees and a terrible principal. Unfortunately, if your child is bullied, they will not address the issue. The principal will not address the issue and will make their life a living nightmare. If you don't stroke his ego, he will treat you and your child poorly. Don't expect assistance from the district; they will stand by their insensitive employees. A child's safety and education should be the top priorities, but their friendships are all they care about.\n\nParent Review\n\n3mo ago\n\nBully, Social isolation, and no homeworkTried our best to work with school, including principle and teacher. No follow up with us so we don't feel comfortable our kids can be happy and focus on learning in school. Left the school after we tried every way and still no words from any staffs about our leaving. Very disappointed\n\nParent Review\n\n2y ago\n\nI chose Medinah Christian School for my son several years ago when he entered preschool and knew then that this was the right choice for our family. Solid Biblical teaching, small class size, caring teachers, and a committed administration were some of the qualities we loved about this school. I was so impressed with this school, in fact, that I joined the faculty and have both my children enrolled. I can tell you as a staff member and a parent that there is NOTHING failing about this school. I encourage you to schedule a tour so you can see for yourself how amazing and joyful our students are, how genuine and dedicated our teachers are, and how this could be a place where your child could thrive.\n\nParent Review\n\n9y ago"
