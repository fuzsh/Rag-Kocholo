        "text": "[1. Meeting Opening *A portion of this video is without audio* ]\n\n[2. Information Items]\n\n[00:00:39]\n\nDANIELLE THOMPSON, WILL PRESENT TO US.\n\n>> SORRY. DANIEL, THANK YOU. SO WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW HER TO PRESENT, HOLD OUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS, JUST WRITE THEM ON THE PAPER, AND WENCHES FINISHED WE CAN DIALOGUE BACK\n\nAND FORTH . >> GOOD MORNING, DR. ALBRIGHT, DR. KATE LEE, I'M GOING TO BE GIVING YOU ILLITERACY UP DATE.\n\nTHIS IS GOING TO BE EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE THIS SCHOOL YEAR AS FAR AS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOES, AND THEN WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED FOR THE REST OF THE CALENDAR YEAR, AND SOME THINGS THAT ARE ON THE HORIZON THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO\n\nACCOMPLISH. >> SO, THE FIRST PART OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, OUR K FOR PRINCIPAL STARTED THE LETTER'S TRAINING. LETTERS, STANDS FOR LANGUAGE ESSENTIALS FOR TEACHERS OF READING AND SPELLING. THIS PARTICULAR PARTNERSHIP CAME THROUGH THE INDIANA DYSLEXIA ASSOCIATION.\n\nSO WE PARTNERED WITH THEM. OUR K FOR PRINCIPLES HAVE ONE YEAR TO COMPLETE THIS VOLUME 1. VOLUME 1 CONSISTS OF FOUR DIFFERENT CHAPTERS. THOSE CHAPTERS INCLUDE THE CHALLENGE OF LEARNING TO READ, SPEECH SOUNDED ENGLISH, TEACHING PHONICS, AND ED VANCE PHONICS RECOGNITION AND PHONICS. OUR TEACHER DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST WITH THROUGH THIS TRAINING DURING THE FIRST SEMESTER. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRINCIPAL TRAINING AT THE TDF TRAINING IS THE TTS WENT THROUGH A LIVE SESSION. IT IS A SACREDNESS ON WINE WEBINAR WITH THE LEXICON PROGRAMMING WHERE THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING NINE HOURS FOR CHAPTER OF TRAINING THAT THEY WENT THROUGH THAT THAT WAS BASED ON EACH OF THOSE CHAPTERS. ONE ADDITIONAL PIECE THAT OUR K FOR PRINCIPLES HAVE AS ADMINISTRATORS MODULE, THAT IS REALLY -- TAKES A BROADER VIEW OF WHAT LETTERS WOULD LOOK LIKE MESSY BUT IT ZOOM A ADMINISTRATOR WOULD NEED IN THE SYSTEM SEND IMPLEMENTATION AND THE SCIENCE TO IMPROVE LITERACY OUTCOMES. IT LOOKS AT THE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES THAT THEY SHOULD BE SAYING WHEN THEY'RE WALKING INTO CLASSROOMS, LEADERSHIP AND ASSESSMENT, DATABASED DECISION-MAKING, AND THEN, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD COME FROM THAT, COMMUNITY AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT, AND THEN SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING. AND I THINK THAT IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF HOW WE ARE GOING TO SUSTAIN THIS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND THEN ON BORDER PEOPLE AS WE HAVE NEW PEOPLE JOIN US.\n\nDEVELOPMENT FISCAL YEAR, WE JOINED AS YOU MAY RECALL THE LITERACY CADRE TO THROUGH THE STATE OF INDIANA. IT WAS PART OF THE LILLY ENDOWMENT THAT CAME THROUGH THE DOE. WE ARE PARDONING WITH THE LITERACY CENTER OF THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY. FISHERS ELEMENTARY AND SAND CREEK ARE OUR CADRE SCHOOLS. THOSE TWO LITERACY COACHES RECEIVED VIRTUAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT EVERY OTHER WEEK. THE PRINCIPALS JOINED THEM ON THAT VIRTUAL CONFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO JOIN THEM AS WELL. AND THEN, OUR PRINCIPALS AT THOSE TWO SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO HAVE PRINCIPAL SPECIFIC PD.\n\nTHEY ARE FULL-DAY VIRTUAL AND I BELIEVE THEY HAVE HAD TO AND I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY THEY WILL HAVE SECOND SEMESTER. THE FEEDBACK FROM THOSE COACHES AND THE PRINCIPLES OF BEEN PHENOMENAL AS FAR AS IT IS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THEY CAN TAKE AND IMPLEMENT WITH THEIR STAFF THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE CLASSROOM. IT'S REAL TIMELY AS FAR AS THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOES. THOSE COACHES ARE WORKING SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH A CLASSROOM TEACHER EARLY ON IN THE\n\n[00:05:01]\n\nCOUNTRY. IT CAME IN EXTENDED INITIALLY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING WITH K-TWO TEACHERS, BUT THEY EXTENDED TO WORK WITH OUR THIRD GRADE TEACHERS, SO THOSE COACHES ARE WORKING SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH OUR K-THREE TEACHERS IN LITERACY. I PERK OF BEING PART OF THE CADRE, IS CURRICULAR RESOURCES WERE GIVEN TO US. IN PARTICULAR, THERE WERE TWO RESOURCES THAT WERE SHARED, YOUTH WIDE, A PHONICS PROGRAM THAT WAS GIVEN TO US.\n\nIT IS RESEARCHED BASED ON EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE THAT IS A SYSTEMIC PROGRAM. IT BUILDS THIS FOUNDATIONAL READING SCHOOL IN ORDER TO BE THAT PROFICIENT READER. IT CAN BE CONSIDERED A CORE CURRICULUM, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE AN INTERVENTION, THEY GAVE THAT TO EVERY CADRE SCHOOL SO WE WERE A VERY -- ALSO HAGGERTY . OUR LAST ADOPTION CYCLE WE ADOPTED HAGGERTY FOR KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE, BUT THEY BELIEVE AS I DO, THAT HAGGERTY REALLY DOES NEED TO BE USED IN SECOND GRADE OH AS WELL.\n\n>> WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE THAT IN BOTH OF THOSE SCHOOLS. THE IMPORTANT PIECE ABOUT CURRICULUM OF PHONICS PROGRAMS. THE MATERIALS AND LESSONS IF YOU FOLLOW THE STRUCTURE, THEN YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY ADDING TO THAT TEACHERS RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF PHONICS. SO IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY MELLOW AS A REPRESENTATIVE. THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE UNDERSTAND. WHILE I AM ON CURRICULAR RESOURCES I WENT TO ADDRESS THE IDOE IS HIGH QUALITY CURRICULAR ADDRESS THAT WAS RELEASED. TWO LISTS. FIRST WAS K-FIVE READING LIST, AND THE SECOND WAS ART RELATED TO LIZ FAR YOUNGER -- AND WHAT THEY REVIEWED WAS CORE CURRICULUM VENDORS, PUBLISHERS HAD TO SUBMITTED APPLICATION, AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE WHOLE PACKAGE.\n\nTHE SUPPLEMENTAL ITEMS THAT MIGHT BE COMING THROUGH WILL BE ON THAT 25/26 ADVISORY LIST. WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT LIST, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF WHETHER OUR H&H SCHOLASTIC COMPLIED, OR NOT. THE IDOE WILL NOT TALLY THAT. WE WILL RECONVENE TO REVIEW THAT TO TO PUBLISHERS BASED ON THE METRIC THE IDOE USED IN FINE WHERE THAT MIGHT BE.\n\n>> WE BIKED FINE SOME HOLES. WE WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH\n\nTHAT. TO PREVENT >> -- THEY ARE NOT ON THAT APPROVED LIST, DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE HAVE TO GET RID OF IT AND WOULDN'T NEED TO MOVE FORWARD, NO, THE DOE NOTES THAT IF YOU HAVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE BELOW 70% PASS ON THE READ, YOU NEED TO REMOVE ONE OF THE APPROVED VENDORS. WE ARE NOT IN THAT SITUATION. SO WE CAN CONTINUE WITH WHAT WE'RE USING NOW. WE JUST NEED TO LOOK TO THAT LIST WHEN WE HAVE OUR NEXT ADOPTION, SO WE ARE IN YEAR TWO, AND FOUR YEARS, WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT.\n\nANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THE ADVISORY LIST IS UPDATED ANNUALLY. THOSE PUBLISHERS ARE APPROVED ARE GOOD FOR SIX YEARS, SO WE COULD HAVE DIFFERENT PUBLISHERS ON IN 25/26. SO IF A PUBLISHER DID NOT APPLY, COULD BE USING THIS YEAR TO FINE-TUNE THEIR PROGRAMMING. OR, IF THEY DID APPLY AND WERE DENIED THEY COULD BE USING THIS YEAR TO FIX\n\nTHOSE CONCERNING AREAS. >> ANOTHER PIECE OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND THIS WAS VERY EXCITING, A TRIP THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE TO SYRACUSE, NEW YORK IN OCTOBER, THE SEVEN YEAR READING LEAGUE. I TOOK THE TWO CADRE PROFESSIONALS , AND TWO OTHER PRINCIPALS FROM BERLIN ROAD, AND HOOSIER ROAD, THE TWO CADRE COACHES, AND THEN TO TDS'S THAT WERE NOT AT THE CADRE SCHOOLS AND THE\n\n[00:10:09]\n\nINTERVENTION SPECIALIST AND MYSELF. WE VENTURED OUT AND WERE ABLE TO ATTEND THAT CONFERENCE AND SEE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD WHO ARE QUOTED THROUGH THE SCIENCE OF READING RESEARCH.\n\nSESSIONS BY LUISA MOATS . WHO IS THAT? SHE IS THE CO-AUTHOR\n\nOF, \"LETTERS. >> WE WERE ABLE TO RECORD HER RESEARCH OF ORTHOGRAPHY AND THE MAPPING OF WORDS. I WAS WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THEY WOULD LOVINGLY SAY THEY WERE GEEKING OUT ON THIS, BUT THEY WERE IMMERSED IN A TOTALLY ENGAGED, AND EXCITED TO HEAR THE INFORMATION THAT SHE WAS SHARING FIRSTHAND. IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN , AND YOU'RE LEARNING THROUGH THE MANUAL AND ONLINE LEARNING. ANOTHER EXPERT WAS DR. ANITA ARCHER.\n\nSHE HAD TWO SESSIONS WE WERE ABLE TO ATTEND, ONE ON COMPREHENSION STRATEGIES, AND THE OTHER ON STUDENT ENGAGEMENT. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT STUDENT ENGAGEMENT FOR 5 TO 18-YEAR-OLDS CAN BE TRICKY, AND OUR TEACHERS ARE DEFINITELY ARTISTS THAT GETTING THE STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN THE LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM. ADULTS, AND GETTING ADULTS TO ENGAGE WHEN YOU HAVE A ROOM FULL OF HUNDRED OR HUNDRED AND 50, IS TRULY AMAZING. AND I WOULD SAY DR. ARCHER HAD EVERYONE ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEATS. THERE WAS CHORAL RESPONSE. I HAD NEVER SEEN A ROOM SO ENGAGED IN WHAT SHE WAS SHARING. SO PHENOMENAL DEFINITELY, AN EXPERT IN HER FIELD, AND WE WERE ALL SITTING THERE IN AWE. JOAN SEELEY IS THE AUTHOR OF THE WRITING WILL BECOME ANOTHER EXPERT, AND INAUDIBLE ], A LOT OF HER RESEARCH IS BASED ON DIX SIX LEAH AND HELPING STUDENTS THAT ARE DYSLEXIC. THE FINAL SESSION WE WERE ABLE TO ATTEND WAS RANKIN COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MISSISSIPPI. IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE MISSISSIPPI MIRACLE, THAT IS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MISSISSIPPI THAT WAS ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND IMPLEMENT THE SCIENCE OF READING RESEARCH, AND IMPROVE THEIR SCORES TREMENDOUSLY. SO WE WERE ABLE TO HEAR FROM THEM AND THEIR LEADERSHIP. AND HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO GO ABOUT THAT, SO A FUNNY STORY -- WE HAD ON OUR TRIP BACK, WE FLEW BACK ON WEDNESDAY -- WE HAD A LAYOVER IN CHICAGO. THIS GROUP OF AND I TELL YOU, THEY WERE GEEKING OUT -- THEY WERE ALL ABOUT THIS.\n\nBUT FROM BEING SEATED ON THE PLANE UNTIL WE WERE BOARDING THE PLANE TO RETURN TO INDIANA, THEY HAD THE PD PLAN FOR THE NEXT DAY. IT WAS A ADMIN PD, THE TD S IS AT THE NEXT GO, WHATEVER WE HAVE PLANNED FOR TOMORROW, WHERE TO PUT IT ASIDE, WE HAVE GOT TO GET IT IN OUR TEACHERS AND. IT WAS THAT MUCH TO TAKE AND LEARN AND IMPLEMENT. SO IT WAS A GREAT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO ATTEND, I'D LIKE TO TAKE ANOTHER GROUP THIS YEAR, UNFORTUNATELY FALLS OVER OUR FALL BREAK, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ATTEND, BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY A WORTH WHILE INVESTMENT FOR US IN THE DISTRICT. WE JUST STARTED AN ADDITIONAL TRAINING. THIS INCLUDES OUR K-4 ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS. THE TWO LITERACY COACHES AT OUR COUNTRY SCHOOLS AND ONE TEACHER FROM EACH OF OUR K-6 BUILDINGS. WE HAVE SOME SELECT TEACHERS AND A SPEECH TEACHER PARTICIPATING. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, AND I REALLY WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO ANYONE WHO HAS GONE THROUGH THIS TRAINING. IT IS TIME INTENSIVE. IT REALLY TRULY IS A COLLEGE-LEVEL COURSE THAT THEY ARE TAKING IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THEIR REGULAR RESPONSIBILITIES AS ADMINISTRATOR, AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER, AND THINKING ABOUT THEIR HOME RESPONSIBILITIES. SO I COMMEND THEM FOR VOLUNTEERING THE TEACHERS, THE RESOURCE TEACHERS THE UNL, THE SLPS, I COMMEND OF HER TAKING ON THIS, THEY WILL BE FINISHED BY THE END OF JUNE WITH THIS\n\nVOLUME 1 FOR LETRS. >> THE OTHER BIG PIECE OF PROFESSIONAL DID THIS YEAR AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH YOU, AARON MOORE IS OUR HIGH ABILITY COORDINATOR\n\n[00:15:03]\n\nRESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SET OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS BECAUSE JUNIOR GREAT BOOKS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A HIGH ABILITY RESOURCE.\n\nONLY STUDENTS THAT WERE TAGGED AS HIGH ABILITY IN LANGUAGE ARTS WERE ABLE TO USE THIS RESOURCE. WITH THE LAST ADOPTION THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH ALL STUDENTS K-6, REGARDLESS OF THEI EXCEPTIONALITY, HIGH ABILITY, OR NOT. WE SAT DOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 22 SCHOOL YEAR WHEN I MOVED OVER TO THIS POSITION, AND WE PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER HOW ARE WE GOING TO MAKE THIS WORK? HOW WE CAN MAKE WITH OUR STUDENTS? IN TRUE FASHION, SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS IN A DO. TO BROADEN THE TRAINER FROM JUNIOR GREAT BOOKS FOR TWO DIFFERENT SESSIONS. SHE TRAINED THE HIGH ABILITY COORDINATORS AND A TEACHER AS WELL AS THE TD S IS FROM EACH OF THE BUILDINGS , K-6. WE HAVE NOW BEEN TRAINED OTHER PEOPLE THAT COULD GO OUT AND TRAIN IN THE BUILDINGS. SHE CHARGED HIM TO WORK WITH THEIR TEACHERS IN THE BUILDING IF THEY FELT COMFORTABLE DO A BUILDING LEVEL TRAININGS OF THIS INFORMATION COULD GET DISSEMINATED TO THEM. THIS YEAR , WE TOUCH BASE WHERE ARE WE WITH THAT PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT? ARE OUR TEACHERS COMFORTABLE WITH IMPLEMENTING THE RESOURCE? SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE GOT THE SAME MESSAGE, SO SHE HAS BEEN TO 14 OF OUR 17 BUILDINGS GIVING BUILDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THE SAME MESSAGE, SHE HAS THE OTHER THREE BUILDINGS PLANNED BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH. AS SHE HAS GONE OUT TO EACH OF THOSE HOLDING LEVELS, SHE HAS HAD TEACHERS REACH OUT INDIVIDUALLY. SHE HAS BEEN IN MANY, MANY CLASSROOMS CO-TEACHING, MODELING, AND WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS, AND IT REALLY SHOWING THAT TEACHER HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT.\n\nSO, SHE WAS ALSO -- I BELIEVE THE PDF ONBOARD OX, THAT IS A LIVE LINK, SHE HAS BEEN FEATURED ON GREAT BOOKS FOUNDATION WEBSITE WOULD JUST WHICH IS DOING WITH MAKING READERS, THINKERS. ACROSS THE ENTIRE K-6, SO NOT JUST THE\n\nHIGH ABILITY STUDENTS. >> THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE. NOW WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WHERE WE WILL BE GOING WITH OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AS ALL OF THOSE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS FINISH UP WITH THEIR VOLUME ON TRAINING BY THE END OF JUNE, WE WILL BE MOVING THEM ONTO VOLUME 2 TRAINING. THAT WILL BE OUR BE TDS, LITERACY COACHES, THE TEACHERS, THE RESOURCE TEACHERS, E AND L , ALL VOLUNTEERED. SO IF THEY ARE IN THAT CURRENTLY ARE JUST FINISHING, THEN THEY WILL BE\n\nFINISHING THAT VOLUME 2. >> BY DECEMBER OF 2024, WE WILL HAVE JULY 24 TO DECEMBER OF 2024, WE WILL HAVE 50 READING SPECIALIST IN THE DISTRICT BASED OFF OF THE LETRS TRAINING. THAT IS AN APPROVED PROGRAM FOR OUR DYSLEXIA MODEL THAT WE GET FROM THE STATE. SO, I THINK THAT IS A HUGE SHIFT FOR US AS WE HAVE ONLY HAD TWO OFFICIAL TRAINED IN THE DISTRICT UP UNTIL NOW. I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT, AND SOMETHING THE DISTRICT SHOULD BE PROUD OF.\n\n2 IN JULY AS WELL, BUT THEY WILL HAVE UNTIL JUNE OF 2025 TO\n\nCOMPLETE THAT. >> THEN WE ARE GETTING READY TO SHARE THIS WITH OUR TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT. WE ARE GOING TO GET THEIR INTEREST AND WHICH OF THESE THREE OPTIONS THEY MAY BE INTERESTED IN. WE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER LETRS ADDITIONAL TEACHERS AND K-6. AS I SAID, IT'S VERY TIME INTENSIVE, AND CONSUMING. SO, I HOPE TO GET 25 ADDITIONAL TEACHERS. I KNOW WE HAD PROBABLY 10 TEACHERS WHEN I FIRST LISTED FOR THAT FIRST COHORT. I HOPE TO GET 25 TO GO THROUGH THAT LETRS TRAINING, AND THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL BE VOLUME 1, AND IN VOLUME 2, IT'LL TAKE ABOUT A YEAR FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH THAT TRAINING. SO THAT WILL BE OPTION ONE. AND YES, WE WILL LIMIT THAT TO 25 TEACHERS.\n\nANOTHER OPTION, IF YOU ARE NOT AWARE, THE IDOE HAS CREATED\n\n[00:20:03]\n\nTHEIR OWN SIGNS OF READING MODULES IN THE INDIANA LEARNING LAB, IT IS FREE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SET UP A LOGIN. THIS INDICATES THE EMPHASIS FROM THE IDOE AS TO WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT TO THE SCIENCE OF READING. THEY ARE OFFERING STIPENDS, THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEEING TO PROVIDE STIPENDS, BUT WE ARE ENCOURAGING TEACHERS TO GO THROUGH THAT. THE THIRD OPTION IS OUR HSE TRAINING. WE SET OUR DATES FOR JUNE 3RD AND FOURTH. AND THEN POSSIBLY JUNE 29TH, AND 30TH. THE TWO KEYING THINGS WILL ALLOW US TO ONBOARD NEW TEACHERS, AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE SOME NEW HIRES BEFORE JUNE 3RD, AND EVIDENTLY BY JULY 29TH SO THEY CAN GO THROUGH THE TRAINING AND KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY WILL HAVE IS THE EXPECTATION FOR HSE. WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO RECORD THAT CONTENT, WHETHER THAT IS RECORDING THEM WHILE THEY ARE INSTRUCTED, OR LATER WE DO A VOICEOVER, I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE, BUT WE WANT TO RECORD THAT CONTENT AND PUT IT ON CAMPUS IS A MODULE SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO ONBOARD TEACHERS AS THEY COME ON THROUGH THE YEAR OR EVEN NEXT YEAR SO THAT THIS IS OUR MESSAGE. THIS IS WHAT HSE EXPECTS FOR LITERACY INSTRUCTION.\n\nSCIENCE OF READING TEACHING LITERACY DOESN'T JUST STOP AT THE SIX GRADE LEVEL, IT'S NOT JUST A IDOE K-6 PIECE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT MAKES UP LITERACY AS I CAN HAVEN'T 12 ENDEAVOR. LOOKING AT JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS AND HOW WE CAN EXPOSE THEM AS TO HOW OUR TEACHERS TEACH OUR STUDENTS LITERACY. THAT IS REFERRED TO AS ADOLESCENT LITERACY, SO IT IS SEVEN THROUGH 12TH GRADERS.\n\nTYPICALLY, THOSE TEACHERS ARE BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY OUR STRUGGLING READERS , AND IN WHAT AREAS THEY ARE STRUGGLING IN, AND HOW THOSE INTERVENTIONS AND TEACHING STRATEGIES WILL BETTER HELP THEM IN THE CLASSROOM. AND, HOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES, BUT THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AT THE JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL. NOT THE SPECIFICS OF PHONICS, AND INAUDIBLE ] OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS, BUT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS IS WHAT YOUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN TAUGHT AS THEY MATRICULATED THROUGH THE SYSTEM, THIS IS HOW YOU CAN PINPOINT AND TROUBLESHOOTING BETTER INSTRUCT YOUR STUDENTS.\n\nOUR OPTIONS AS TO HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BECOME A PART OF THE LITERACY CADRE THREE. INITIALLY THERE WERE GOOD BEFORE, BUT THEY DECIDED THAT THE THIRD IS GOING TO BE FUNDED , SO WE ARE EXPLORING OUR OPTIONS TO SEE HOW WE CAN EXPAND THIS THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, SO THAT WOULD THEN IMPART FULL TIME LITERACY COACHES AT ALL 13 ELEMENTARIES AND FUNDED BY THE IDOE GRANT.\n\nTHE OTHER PERKS OF THAT IS WE WOULD SAVE THE RACES CURRICULAR MATERIALS SO THAT WILL BE A COST SAVING FOR THE DISTRICT, AS WELL. WE ARE STILL EXPLORING THOSE OPTIONS, BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THAT TO FRUITION.\n\nMARCH 4TH, THE IREAD-3 WINDOW OPENS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE TESTED OUR THIRD-GRADERS DURING THAT TWO-WEEK WINDOW. WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING IF THE STUDENTS PASS, IF THEY DO NOT PASS, IF THEY DO NOT PASS I GO THROUGH THE SUMMER SCHOOL OPTION, AND WE RETEST THEM. THIS YEAR WE KNEW WE WOULD BE TESTING OUR SECOND-GRADE STUDENTS THAT ARE AT THE CADRE SCHOOLS, FISHERS CREEK, AND ELEMENTARY. WE MADE THE DECISION WE WERE GOING TO EXPAND THAT'S ALL 13 OF OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. ALL 13 WILL BE TESTING SECOND GRADE AND THIRD GRADE DURING THAT TWO-WEEK WINDOW. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE AS TO HOW GREAT IT WILL BE REPORTED OUT. GRADE 2 WILL HAVE THREE DIFFERENT REPORT LEVELS. THE FIRST WOULD BE PASSED. IF THEY HIT THAT 446 BENCHMARK, THEN THEY ARE PAST.\n\n[00:25:02]\n\nTHEY ARE PAST, THEY DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE IT IN THIRD GRADE.\n\nGREAT. WE MOVE ON. >> IF THEY HIT THE BENCHMARK OF OUR TARGET, THAT MEANS THEY ARE ON THE TRAJECTORY OF CONTINUED INSTRUCTION AT THAT LEVEL, AND PERFORM AT THAT LEVEL, THEY WILL PASS AS A THIRD GRADER WHEN THEY TAKE IT\n\nIN GRADE 3. >> THAT THIRD LEVEL IS AT RISK.\n\nTHAT SHOWS US THAT THAT STUDENT IS NOT ON THE TRAJECTORY, THAT SHE NEEDS INTENSIVE INTERVENTION IMMEDIATELY TO CLOSE THE GAP SO WE CAN GET THEM ON THE SUBJECT RE-TO PASS. THOSE STUDENTS WILL IF NOT ALREADY BE A PART OF THE MTSS PROCESS IMMEDIATELY SO WE CAN START THAT EARLY INTERVENTION SO THEY WILL HAVE MORE THAN A YEAR OF INTERVENTION IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN CLOSE THAT GAP AND SURE THAT THEY WILL PASS AT GRADE 3.\n\n>> THERE IS NO SUMMER SCHOOL REQUIREMENT FOR GRADE 2. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO SEND TO FAMILIES. THE DATE IS NOT PUBLIC. THERE WILL NOT BE ANY PARENT REPORTS, AND THERE IS -- THE ONLY DATA THAT WILL CARRYOVER ARE THOSE STUDENTS IN GREATER THAT PASSING GRADE 2. THEN THEY WILL BE A PASS FOR GRADE 3, SO THAT IS WHERE WILL CARRYOVER. OTHERWISE IT IS INTERNAL INFORMATION FOR US, CERTAINLY, WE WILL SHARE THAT WITH PARENTS, BUT THERE WON'T BE AN OFFICIAL REPORT GOES HOME TO THOSE FAMILIES. WE ARE EXCITED. TEACHERS ARE ALL ABOUT DATA, THIS IS NOT TO GIVE US GREAT DATED TO CONTINUE TO ADJUST OUR INSTRUCTION, AND THE INTERVENTIONS, AND ENSURE THAT THE INTERVENTIONS ARE THE CORRECT INTERVENTION STRATEGIES TO CLOSE THAT GAP. THAT WILL BE ON MARCH 4TH, AND THAT IS WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU AND I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR RUSSIANS.\n\nREPORT. I APPRECIATE IT. ESPECIALLY HEARING WHERE WE ARE, WHERE WE WERE, AND WHERE WE ARE GOING. I APPRECIATE IT.\n\nI BROKE DOWN WHICH PAGE WAS ON, IN THE PART WHERE YOU SAID MOVING FORWARD FOR PROFESSIONAL DOWNLOAD MOVEMENT YOU SAID 50 READING SPECIALIST IN THE DISTRICT FOR THAT LETRS, FOR THAT -- NOW CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THAT IS BALANCED ACROSS\n\nTHE DISTRICT? >> THE CURRENT COHORT STUDY, THERE IS ONE TEACHER FROM EACH OF THE 13 ELEMENTARIES, AND ONE TEACHER FROM EACH OF THE FOUR INTERMEDIATE SCHOOLS. EACH ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL AT THE K-4 BUILDINGS IS GOING THROUGH THAT. AND THEN THE SEVEN TDS'S AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND THE ONE THAT IS AT THE INTERMEDIATE THAT IS OVER HUMANITIES, ALL OF THOSE WILL BE COMPLETELY TRAINED IN LETRS BY 2024. KEEP IN MIND, WE ARE OFFERING THAT UP TO 25, AND WE WILL SPREAD THAT OUT AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE FROM EACH BUILDING REPRESENTED IN THAT 25.\n\n>> OKAY, THEY'RE GOOD. YOU SAID PRINCIPLES, ALL THE PRINCIPLES, AND THEN THEY HAVE ONE FROM EACH? WILL THAT EVER GROW? IS THAT THE INTENTION TO KEEP IT GROWING?\n\n>> WE WOULD LOVE FOR TO GROW. IT IS AN EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR.\n\nFOR EACH PERSON IT'S ABOUT $3000, STORIES TRAINING GOES.\n\nIT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO GO THROUGH THAT.\n\n>> DO OUR TEACHERS GET TO TEACH THE OTHER TEACHERS?\n\n>> NO, WE DID NOT SEND ANYONE TO THE FACILITATOR TRAINING, IT BECAUSE IS NOT A FULL-TIME THE TRAINER. THERE IS A COST TO GO THROUGH THE ASYNCHRONOUS PART OF LETRS, IT ONLY TAKES THE PARTY OF THE LIVE SESSIONS PER\n\n>> BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S COSTLY, IT'S $3000 OR SO PER PERSON, AND WE HAVE SOME PLANS TO TRY TO RETAIN SOME OF THE STAFF MEMBERS WERE TWITTERING THEM, AND DO WE HAVE A\n\nLONGER-TERM PLAN FOR THAT? >> GREAT QUESTION. WHEN I WENT TO THE BUILDING PRINCIPLES, AND WHEN I SPOKE WITH ABBEY TAYLOR ABOUT THIS, AS WELL, I ASKED THE EARTH WAS TO SEEK OUT TEACHERS THAT AT THE TEACHER LEADERS THAT REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY DESIRE TO MOVE INTO ADMINISTRATION. THEY WANT TO SAY THEY ARE TEACHER LEADERS, AND THEIR PASSION IS IN THE\n\n[00:30:03]\n\nCLASSROOM AND TEACHING THE STUDENTS. THOSE 14 OR 17 TEACHERS PART OF THIS COHORT ARE TEACHER LEADERS.\n\n>> WE RESURRECT WHAT WE CALL THE LITERACY LEADERS FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO, AND IT WAS TEACHERS THAT WANTED TO STAY IN THE CLASSROOM AND BE LEADERS IN THEIR BUILDING AND HAD A PASSION FOR LITERACY. THAT PIECE OF IT, STAYING IN THE BUILDING BRANDON EVEN USING THEM FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS IN THAT BUILDING, AND PERHAPS EVEN WITH\n\nOUR SUMMER TRAINING. >> THANKS, THAT LEADS INTO MY\n\nNEXT QUESTION. >> LOOK AT THIS. WHO IS LEADING THE SUMMER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. OUR GDS IS GOING THROUGH DOING THE CONTENT. WE WILL WORK WITHOUT VEGETABLES AND TEACHERS GOING THROUGH THIS CURRENT COHORT AND OUR PRINCIPLES. SO IT MAY NOT BE THE ENTIRE TWO DAY TIME PERIOD, COULD JUST BE ONE SESSION THAT WE WILL WORK WITH THEM, BUT THE MAJORITY IT WILL BE.\n\n>> THANK YOU. >> A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL OF THIS. AND THANKS AGAIN FOR THE PRESENTATION. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. IT'S FUNNY TO SAY THAT -- I THINK IT'S BETTER FOCUS OF OUR DISTRICT FOR A WHILE, AND IT STARTS MOVING UP, NOW YOU CAN COMING AT THE STATE LEVEL, AND LEGISLATION IN ALL THIS. WHAT I THINK WE HAVE BEEN ON TOP OF IT, SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AS FAR AS AND I SAY THIS WITH YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW WE FACE A SINNER CONTINUED TO FACE US AND HOW WE ALIGNED ELEMENTARY TO ELEMENTARY COMMENDED ELEMENTARY TO INTERMEDIATE FROM -- I WROTE DOWN SOME GENERAL THINGS. THINGS LIKE THE COURSE SELECTION, RESOURCE SELECTION, THE REMEDIATION VERSUS THE ENRICHMENT ALL OF THIS I HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY IS, DEPENDING ON WHICH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YOU WENT TO AS YOU MOVE INTO THE NEXT LEVEL, THOSE TEACHERS REALIZE NOT EVERY KID IS AT THE SAME LEVEL. THEY MAY HAVE GOTTEN MORE OR DIFFERENT THINGS DEPENDING ON WHAT SCHOOL THEY CAME FROM. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT MORE ALIGNED. SO AS THEY MOVE INTO THE NEXT LEVEL, EVERYBODY HAS AT LEAST A\n\nSIMILAR SKILL SET >> NO, THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT MORE ALIGNED SO WE HAVE THAT EQUAL ACCESS AT ALL 13 ELEMENTARIES. BUT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE RESOURCES THROUGH OUR MOST RECENT ADOPTION , AND FOR SUBSEQUENT ADOPTIONS ARE UTILIZED IN EVERY CLASSROOM AND EVERY ELEMENTARY AND INTERMITTENT. IN THE DISTRICT. THAT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST.\n\nOUR TEACHER DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST COACHES, THEY WERE, THEY MEET MONTHLY, BUT CONSTANTLY WHETHER IT IS ON A TEXT THREAD, WHETHER IT IS OH HERE'S AN IDEA I'M TO THROW IN AN EMAIL, OR A LINK, BUT I JUST DID THIS PEE DEE, IT WAS THROUGH THE ROOF. THEY SHARE ALL OF THAT INFORMATION, SO THEY REALLY TRYING TO GET THE SAME PIECES OF INFORMATION OUT . BY HAVING THEM WORK THROUGH THE SUMMER TRAINING TOGETHER, WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE SAME INFORMATION THAT IS GOING THROUGH. SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON. WE ALSO HAVE ON THE WEBSITE, WE HAVE OUR INTERVENTION LISTING. WE WILL BE REVIEWING THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IT WILL BE AN ANNUAL REVIEW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SAME INTERVENTION AT EACH BUILDING SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE STUDENTS THAT COME FROM THREE DIFFERENT ELEMENTARIES INTO ONE INTERMEDIATE, AND YOU'RE USING WHAT INTERVENTION? I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS A JOURNEY . IT'S NOT A RACE. BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THE INTENSITY, AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS, SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT QUICKER THAN THE JOURNEY. BUT , WE WANT TO TAKE OUR TIME AND DO THE RIGHT THING.\n\n>> MASCO QUESTION? CAN YOU CLARIFY FOR MYSELF, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REMEDIATION AND INTERVENTION? IF WE ARE REMEDIATING THE KITS, WE ARE PUTTING, IS THAT THE INTERVENTION? I MEAN -- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND?\n\n>> ANY CHILD CAN HAVE ANY SORT OF REMEDIATION. CLASSROOM TEACHING CAN GIVE A MINI LESSON, OR , BE WORKING IN WITH THE STUDENT IN A SMALL GROUP AND NOTICE THEY ARE NOT GETTING THAT CONCEPT, AGAIN GOING PULLED HIM ASIDE AND DO A QUICK REMEDIATION GOING THROUGH ALL OF THAT CONCEPT AGAIN, JUST DOING REPETITION. THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED REMEDIATION. I THINK WHAT SOMETIMES GETS INTERCHANGED IS THE\n\n[00:35:05]\n\nREMEDIATION WITH THE SPECIFIC INTERVENTION. SO WE HAVE SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS THAT WE USE WITH STUDENT COMMUNITY THAT COME THROUGH WITH THE DYSLEXIA INTERVENTION, WE USE THOSE BECAUSE THEY HIT ALL AREAS OF THAT DYSLEXIA AT RISK. THOSE WOULD BE THE SPECIFIC, THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WE USE ARE THE INTERVENTIONS, BUT REMEDIATION IS KIND OF A GENERIC TERM, BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO USE AN INTERVENTION TO REMEDIATE ITS THAT IT COULD BE\n\nA QUICK REVIEW. >> TO PIGGYBACK ON THAT A LITTLE BIT, THE PAGE WHERE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT GREAT TOO, WHERE THEY HAD PASSED, ON TARGET, AT RISK, IT SAYS THOSE AT RISKS MAY NEED INTERVENTION AND STUFF, SO YOU MADE -- I WROTE DOWN -- WHAT HAPPENS IF IN THIRD GRADE THEY DON'T PASS? DOESN'T GO INTO AND OTHER INTERVENTION? OR IS THAT INTO A REMEDIATION PROGRAM? WELL, THE MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT, ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT IS COMING THROUGH WITH THE PROGRESS MONITORING OF THOSE STUDENTS.\n\nIF THEY ARE SEEING THOSE STUDENTS AFTER THREE OR FOUR DATA POINTS ARE STAGNANT, THEY ARE CHANGING UP THAT INTERVENTION. THAT INTERVENTION IS NOT LEARNED BY THAT STUDENT, THEIR STUDENT LEARNS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO THEY PULL THAT IN. THEY TRY TO MARK KITS WITH THAT TRAJECTORY AND STICK WITH THAT INTERVENTION. LET'S SAY A STUDENT DOESN'T PASS AND COMES ACROSS AS AT RISK IN GREAT TOO, THEY ARE NOT ALREADY PART OF THE PROCESS, THEY WILL BE PART OF IT AND WE WILL IDENTIFY THE INTERVENTION THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEM BASED ON THE DEFICITS THAT WE FIND IN THE IREAD-3 TEST. IF WE TAKE THE GRADE 3 AND THEY DO NOT PASS, WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THAT OTHER DATA, WHAT DO WE USE, WHEN DO WE CHANGE IT UP, WHY DO WE CHANGE IT UP, WHEN DO WE GO TO NEXT? IT COULD GET US TO A POINT THAT AN EVALUATION IS NEEDED, OR A READING DISABILITY IS THERE THAT WE NEED TO JUST\n\nINVESTIGATE. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\n\n>> I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. AS WE CAN INTO THE OLDER GROWING LEVELS, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THEY IDENTIFIED FROM NEEDING ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE, AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE, AND WHAT KIND OF INTERVENTION THEY CAN GET TO\n\nAFTER K-FIVE. >> THEY WOULD GO THROUGH THE COUNSELOR AND PARENT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC DYSLEXIA SCREENER. WITH THE DYSLEXIA SCREENING, THE TEACHER HAS TO HAVE A CONCERN IN ALL FIVE AREAS FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH SCREENING PROCESS. TYPICALLY THAT TEACHER WORKS WITH THEIR COUNSELOR, AND THEY WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS, AND THE TEAM AT THOSE LEVELS ARE PULLED IN, AND THEY LOOK THROUGH THE DATA, AND THEY MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER AN INTERVENTION, OR TESTING IS NEEDED. SO THAT PROCESS IS HOW IT'S DONE AT THAT 7-12 LEVEL, SIMILAR TO THE 55 AND SIX LEVEL.\n\nCOHORTS OF STUDENTS THROUGH THE YEARS, WITH THE OLD WAVE READING, THERE MAY BE SOME CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS ARE STILL FIGURING OUT AND GOING ON THE OLD NUMBERS AND TECHNIQUES, SO THAT WAS A QUESTION OR CONCERN I HAD.\n\nSECONDLY, HAVE YOU PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER IN THE EARLY STAGES AND YOU'RE ALL DOING IT, BUT WHAT I LOOK AT IS, WHAT IS YOUR STRATEGIC ROADMAP LOOK FOR ROADMAP IMPLEMENTATION DISTRICT WIDE. WHAT IS A HUMAN CAPITAL NEED LOOK LIKE IN THE CAUSE? WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE OVER TIME AND HAVE WE STARTED LOOKING AT FINANCIAL FORECASTING AND KATIE IS AS WELL BECAUSE KATIE IS BEGINNING TO BUDGET OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED IS A DISTRICT? LIKE A BIG HAIRY, AUDACIOUS GOAL, IF YOU WILL? IF WE LOOK WITH WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE IN OUR DISTRICT? START WITH THE END IN MIND AND WORK BACKWARD . WHAT IS CAN IT TAKE TO GET THERE, WHAT IS THE TIMELINE? WHAT IS THE CAUSE? HOW DO WE BACKTRACK THAT TO IMPLEMENT PIECES OF THAT WHETHER IN PART OR WHOLE OF THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS FINANCIALLY? DOES THAT MAKE\n\nSENSE? >> YES. MY FIRST GOAL IS THAT WE HIT THAT 95% IREAD-3 BY 2027. I'D LIKE TO SEE IS\n\n[00:40:02]\n\nHEATED BY 2026, JUST BECAUSE AT HS LETTER E, WE DO THINGS BETTER. BY HITTING THE THIRD CAUTERY AND GETTING LITERACY IN EVERY BUILDING. EVERY TEACHER IS GOING TO GET STRONG PD FROM THE STATE FROM THE UNIVERSITY , AND OUR TEACHERS WILL HAVE THE COACHING STRATEGIES AND CYCLES AVAILABLE TO THEM , AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT COACHING CYCLES ON A REGULAR BASIS, THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS ON REGULAR BASIS YIELDS LONGER-TERM TEACHER EFFICACY WITH KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEN THAT TURNS INTO STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT INCREASES. WE CAN DO THAT WITH PART-TIME TDS'S WHERE WE HAVE WANTED TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OR WANTED OUR LARGEST ELEMENTARY AND HELPING OUT AT SOME OF OUR INTERMEDIATES, THAT IS NOT A BEST BUY DOES MODEL. NEVER HAS BEEN. WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR COACHES THAT HAVE THAT EXPERTISE WITHIN LITERACY AND BY JOINING THE CADRE, THAT WILL BE A HUGE PIECE OF THAT. SO YES DR. KEGLEY, KATIE AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THAT BUDGET PIECE OF IT. AS WAS ALLUDED TO EARLIER, WITH THE LETRS TRAINING, AND THE MORE PEOPLE WE CAN PUT THROUGH THAT, THE BETTER. THAT IS A BIG PIECE OF IT. WE ALSO HAVE TO KIND OF FIT IN HOW THAT LOOKS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD THROUGH WITH OUR TRANSFORMATION OF OUR LEARNING WITH OUR THAT CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE THE TARGET, HAVE WE CONSIDERED TRAIN THE TRAINER, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH YOUR CADRE TO GO INTO THE INTENSIVE TRAINING, COME BACK AND TRAIN THE REST OF THE DISTRICT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP SENDING OUT BUT WE BRING THOSE PEOPLE THROUGH THE CONDUITS THAT WE DISSEMINATE THAT WITH THE REST OF THE\n\nDISTRICT. >> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE CADRE IS, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE TRAIN THE TRAINER, BUT THAT IS THEIR EXPERT, WHEN THEY GOING INTO THE STATIC ] THERE MODELING, TEACHING, AND EFFECTIVELY RELEASING IT BACK TO THE TEACHER SO THEY IMPARTED THAT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TEACHER SO THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD. THEN THAT COACH CAN MOVE ONTO ANOTHER TEACHER. WHEN YOU HAVE ONE COACH WORKING WITH 25 TEACHERS AS OPPOSED TO ONE COACH WORKING WITH 50 OR 60 TEACHERS, THOSE COACHING MODELS CAN GO VERY QUICKLY. AND THOUGH CYCLES CAN GO VERY QUICKLY. THE OTHER PIECE OF THE LETTER'S TRAINING, AGAIN, WE DID NOT PUT ANYONE THROUGH THE FACILITATOR TRAINING BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY SAVE US MUCH MONEY, AND IT'S MORE TIME, IT JUST TAKES THE PLACE OF THAT ONLINE PIECES OF IT, IT'S STILL THE CAUSE OF THE ASYNCHRONOUS BASIS. THAT THREE I THINK IT'S NEAR THE END -- SO THE ONE THAT HAS A SUMMER TRAINING ON IT, THERE'S THREE BULLETS THERE, TICKETS FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH SLIDE TO THE END. THAT IS TRAINING THAT WE ARE OFFERING TO OUR K-6 TEACHERS, SO WE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF MONIES WE CAN USE IT AS AN EXPIRATION DATE ON IT.\n\nALL OF OUR PROBLEM FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS SCALING IT UP. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SPACES THAT ARE NOT ONLY NOT -- IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE TO PUT THROUGH, BUT COSTLY PER PERSON. WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. THAT IS WHAT OUR PLAN IS. AND WE CREATED SOME TEARS HERE, AND DANIELLE DID AND OFTEN DOES AN AWESOME JOB WITH THIS.\n\n>> WE CAN CREATE TEACHERS FOR WHERE THEY WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON, WE HAVE EVERYBODY HAVE AT LEAST SOME KIND OF BASELINE LEVEL SO WE CAN BUILD FROM THERE.\n\nTRAINING THE TRAINER, THE FACILITATORS, IF WE WERE TO PUT SOMEONE THROUGH THAT PORTION OF THE TRAINING IS THERE ANYTHING THAT PROHIBITED, I MEAN, THIS IS DIFFICULT TRAINING TO GET BECAUSE OF SPACE CONCERNS, THE AVAILABLE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO TO DO THE TRAINING, SO I\n\n[00:45:02]\n\nKNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST OUR DISTRICT THAT STRUGGLE TO FIND TEACHERS TO GO THROUGH IT , IT'S THE SURROUNDING DISTRICTS AS WELL. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT PROHIBITS US FROM TRAINING OUR TEACHERS TO BE FACILITATORS OF THE TRAINING AND THEREFORE, WE COULD OPEN UP SLOTS TO SURROUNDING DISTRICTS TO HELP PAY FOR THE ASYNCHRONOUS PART FOR MORE TEACHERS TO GO TO THE TRAINING OF THEN WE CAN LEAVE THE IN PERSON'S DEATH OURSELVES? IF WE ARE OPENING SPOTS IN CARMEL, WESTFIELD, NOBLESVILLE WHO ARE ALL TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME, IF WE CAN SEND TEACHERS THROUGH THAT TO BECOME TRAINERS AND CELLS, AND THEN SAY, WE OPEN 20% OF THOSE SPOTS WHEN WE RUN THE TRAINING TO OTHER TEACHERS THAT THEN CAN OFFSET COSTS OF BEING ABLE TO DO MORE FOR OUR\n\nOWN TEACHERS? >> YEP. LET ME LOOK INTO THAT.\n\nINITIALLY, WHEN WE SENT OUR TDS, WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THE FACILITATOR TRAINING. AS I LOOKED INTO IT MORE, I DIDN'T SEE IT WAS COST-EFFECTIVE FOR A BUS BECAUSE IT JUST TOOK THAT LIVE SESSION. I FELT LIKE WE COULD USE THAT MONEY TO PUT MORE PEOPLE THROUGH THE ACTUAL TRAINING. BUT I WILL LOOK INTO THAT AND SEE IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO, IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS JUST OUR PEOPLE THAT THEY COULD DO, TO LIVE SESSION 4. BUT I COULD LOOK INTO IT, THAT\n\nI THINK THAT IS A GREAT IDEA. >> CAN YOU CLARIFY, SO, WE WOULD BE TRAINING OUR STAFF, BUT THEN ONCE WE TRAINED AND HAD THE FACILITATOR, SARA, ARE YOU SAYING WE WOULD LIKE OPEN IT UP AND WE COULD TRAIN NOBLESVILLE AND OTHERS, AND\n\nTHEY WOULD PASS? >> YES.\n\n>> OKAY. THERE'S A WAY TO SET OFF THAT CAUSE SO WE COULD TRAIN MORE TEACHERS, BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE TO DO. WE WOULD PUT OUR TEACHERS THROUGH FIRST, AND SAYING LIKE, IF WE HAD 100 SPOTS, IN A IN PERSON CLASS THAT WE COULD GIVE I DON'T KNOW, 10 OR 20 SPOTS TO SURROUNDING DISTRICTS AMENITY OF OUR TEACHERS, IT THUS TENOR TONY TEACHERS -- THEY WOULD PASS, COULD OFFSET THE COST OF THEN THE NEXT CLASS OF OUR OWN TEACHERS.\n\n>> OKAY. INTERESTING. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING.\n\n>> THIS, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OF -- CAN I CLARIFY ONE THING\n\nBEFORE YOU ASK YOUR QUESTION? >> ONE THING I DID LEARN ABOUT THE MISSISSIPPI MIRACLE, IS ABOUT THE MANPOWER, THEY ARE A DISTRICT EQUAL TO OUR SIZE, SOCIAL ECONOMIC MAKEUP, I THINK THEY HAD 25 COACHES THAT WERE NOT BUILDING BASED . THEY WERE DISTRICT LEVEL THAT DID THE PD. I THINK THEY HAD LIKE FOUR ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENTS, THINK THEY HAD FIVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS, AND I MEAN, IT WAS THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD AT CENTRAL OFFICE THAT COULD RUN THAT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BEFORE IT GOT TO THE BUILDINGS, WAS AMAZING.\n\nTOOK MY JUST SOMETHING THAT I LEARNED WHEN I WENT TO THAT\n\nBREAKOUT. >> SORRY.\n\n>> THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT IN HERE ABOUT ASSESSMENTS THAT WE ARE USING TO SORT OF DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF ONE OF OUR STUDENTS. WHAT ASSESSMENTS ARE WE STILL USING TO KIND OF GAUGE WHERE STUDENTS ARE, AND HOW DID THOSE TIE INTO OUR NEW CURRICULUM INTO THE SCIENCE OF READING.\n\nPREVIOUSLY WORRIED USING BALANCED LITERACY BASED ASSESSMENT. ARE WE LOOKING TO CHANGE OUR ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO WERE NOT TRYING TO MEASURE ORANGES WHEN WERE TRYING TO TEACH ABOUT APPLES?\n\n>> WE WILL BE PHASING OUT THE HAVE LEX ALL LEVELS AND QUARTILES FORMATS ARE REALLY THE DIRECTION THAT SCIENCE OF READING GOES. THE RESEARCH BEHIND SCIENCE OF READING DOESN'T WANT TO TO LEVEL STUDENTS. IT DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE YOU A BENCHMARK TO STUDENTS, AND WANTED TO SHOW WHERE A STUDENT IS AT A GIVEN MOMENT IN TIME, AND THEN HOW THEY'VE LEARNED UP THROUGH THAT POINT, AND HOW MUCH THEY'VE LEARNED IN THAT ACHIEVEMENT TO THAT POINT. THE NWA IS VALUABLE FOR THAT PIECE OF IT MOVING FORWARD. THEN , WITH AGE-MATES, WE HAVE THE END OF UNIT ASSESSMENTS THAT WE ARE USING THAT OUR TEACHERS ARE ABLE TO CHANGE AND ADAPT, THAT WOULD WORK WITH WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TEACHING. THEN SOME OTHER PROGRESS MONITORING PIECES THAT\n\nWE HAVE. >> OKAY, GREAT.\n\n>> ALONG THE SAME SORT OF ASSESSMENTS, DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF METRICS, OR MEASUREMENT OF SUCCESS, WHETHER IT BE FOR\n\n[00:50:03]\n\nTDS'S, OR LITERACY COACHES TO GAUGE THE SUCCESS OF THE PLAN WE ARE ON SO WE CAN SEE SNAPSHOTS IN TIME TO SAY THAT WE ARE PROGRESSING IN THE RIGHT WAY? WHETHER THERE'S A NEED TO DEVIATE FROM WHERE WE ARE, MAYBE SOMETHING IS WORKING AT FISHERS ELEMENTARY, BUT SAND CREEK IS STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME COUNTRY CONCEPT THAT WE ARE MEASURING FOR THE PROGRESS OF HOW WE'RE DOING, SO WE TRY TO TAKE THIS OUT TO OUR OTHER ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO KNOW -- BECAUSE AGAIN, THIS KIDS SCHOOLS A DIFFERENT. THE KIDS ARE DIFFERENT. IF WOULD TRY THIS, DIDN'T WORK, DO WE HAVE THOSE SORT OF CHECK-IN POINTS, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PART OF THE CADRE ITSELF IN THE SUPPORT THAT THEY ARE DOING. THE BASICALLY DOING METRICS FOR HOW WERE PROGRESSING?\n\n>> TO COMPARE WINTER LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR TO LOOK AT PROGRESS, AND I CAN TELL YOU LOOKING AT THAT, IN THE EIGHTH GRADE LEVELS BETWEEN THOSE SCHOOLS , KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE CAN LOOK AT KINDERGARTEN, BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T HERE, SIX OF THOSE EIGHT HAVE A CREASED IN ACHIEVEMENT FROM WINTER TO WINTER. THAT WAS GOOD DATA TO LOOK AT. WITHIN THE CADRE, THEY DO COLLECT DATA, AND THAT WAS PART OF THE AGREEMENT THAT WE SHARE AGGREGATE DATA WITH THEM SO THAT THEY CAN REVIEW AND MOVE FORWARD. THEN, WE WILL ALSO HAVE OUR IREAD-3 DATA THAT WE WILL LOOK AT AND PERHAPS THERE WILL BE A SERVER THAT WILL BE GIVEN TO OUR TEACHERS TO VOLUNTEER TO ANSWER FOR US TO GET MORE INFORMATION.\n\n>> OKAY, GREAT. >> IF I CAN JUMP IN HERE. WE WERE KIND OF ON THE CUSP OF SOME CHURCHES WITH ASSESSMENTS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW . SO, WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPT INTO PILOT THE NEW I LEARN ASSESSMENT WHICH IS GHANA, NOT NEXT YEAR, BUT THE YEAR AFTER. IT IS GOING TO CLOSELY RESEMBLE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITHIN THE YOU WOULD TAKE -- OUR STUDENTS WOULD TAKE A I LEARN ASSESSMENT PIECE AS PART OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AS PART OF A CHECK POINT. THEN, THEY WOULD STILL HAVE THE SUMMARY PIECE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE FIRST THREE CHECKPOINTS ARE FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES ONLY, SO WE CAN SEE WHERE OUR KIDS ARE, AND MAKE INTERVENTIONS AND CHANGES AND THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO GET STUDENTS ON TRACK OR NOT. THE LAST SUMMARY TEST, PORTION OF THE EXAM IS WHAT EVENTUALLY GET RELEASED PUBLICLY. SO, WE DECIDED THAT FOR NEXT YEAR, WE URGE ONLY GOING TO DO -- WE OPTED IT AT GRADE 7 AND EIGHT. WE HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD, BECAUSE NWEA, IS USED AS A TOOL FOR HIGH-END INABILITY EDUCATION, AND HOW WE CAN AND NAVIGATE THAT, WE ARE WAITING FOR GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE .\n\nBUT THAT WILL BE ANOTHER PIECE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION TO, BECAUSE I THINK THAT GETTING A JUMPSTART WITH GRADE 2 AND IREAD-3 WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO SEE OUR STUDENTS ARE DOING OUT OF THE GATE, AND HOW TO GET THEM ON TRACK FOR STUDENTS, MAYBE NOT, BUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO FURTHER USE THE STATE ASSESSMENTS AND CHANGES THAT ARE COMING WITH THAT, AND IDENTIFY WHETHER WE ARE STILL PROGRESSING APPROPRIATELY, OR NOT. WE ARE YEAR AND A HALF UNDER THE ADOPTION THAT WE HAD. I THINK THAT'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION AT THE STATE HOUSE THE SPRINGER WINTER HAS BEEN WHEN THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT CHANGES FOR RETENTION, AND WHATNOT FOR IREAD-3 , IS REALLY JUST MANDATED SCIENCE OF READING FOR YEAR GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BUT, NEVERTHELESS, THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE\n\nKEEPING OUR EYE ON IT AS WELL. >> TOUCHED ON YET IS OUR ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS. SOMETIME NOTICED, I BLAME SARA FOR SENDING US ALL THIS LITERACY INFORMATION . SENT OUT AND GOT QUESTIONS. IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO EDIT AT A YOUNG AGE, SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO READ PHONETICALLY, AND JUST DOESN'T KNOW ENGLISH. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE MAKE THAT DISCERNMENT? THEY\n\n[00:55:03]\n\nHAVE A GREAT UNDERSTANDING OF PHONICS, BUT THEY CAN'T PUT ENGLISH WORDS WITH THE MEANINGS AND THAT KIND OF THING, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW WE TEST, HOW IS SEPARATE, AND HOW WE REMEDIATE, IT'S A GROWING AREA. IN OUR DISTRICT AND ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO, JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS.\n\n>> DANIEL RAY DIEGO, RUNS A WONDERFUL ENGLISH PROGRAM, WHERE A MODEL PROGRAM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE FROM HER PROGRAM, BUT THE SCIENCE OF READING IS THE BEST WAY, THAT ENGLISH IS A LANGUAGE HOW THEY LEARN, TEACHING THEM VOCABULARY BACK ON KNOWLEDGE AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. THERE'S A TIME. FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE NEW, TO THE COUNTRY TO BE FULLY FLUENT, IN ENGLISH, SO WE HAVE A TIME.\n\nTHAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH WITH THOSE INTERVENTIONS, BUT SHE HAS VERY WELL TRAINED ENL TEACHERS THAT ARE LICENSED THAT ARE REALLY TRAINED TO IDENTIFY THAT INFORMATION, AND THEN SHE'S PULLED IN ON THAT, AS WELL. FOR WE GO THROUGH ANY SORT OF INTERVENTION, SO THAT EXPOSURE TO THE ENGLISH\n\nLANGUAGE IS VERY IMPORTANT. >> IT'S ALL PULL TOGETHER?\n\n>> THOSE COACHES AND TEACHERS ARE PART OF THE CLASSROOM ALONG WITH A LITERACY COACH? ARE THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE? DO\n\nTHEY CROSS? >> THEY ALL CROSS, THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER IN DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS, THEY MIGHT PUSH THEM FOR SUPPORT FOR 30 MINUTES OR SO, BUT THAT IT IS A FINE-TUNED MACHINE TO FABLESS PEOPLE WORK TOGETHER.\n\n>> SO WHEN THEY PUT PEOPLE TO COME I THINK IT IS WE DO, THINK THAT WE DO TEST. DOES THAT OVERLAP WITH THE IREAD-3 TEST TO KIND OF SHOW -- IS IT GOING TO SKEW THE DATA AND THAT IF YOU TAKE A PRESIDENT ALBRIGHT AND PEOPLE ARE PASSIVE, IS BECAUSE THEY AREN'T SPEAKING ENGLISH?\n\n>> IT MIGHT BE. THAT IS A DIFFERENT DATA POINT MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS THAN THAT COULD BE PART OF THE CONCERN, BUT WE DO HAVE STUDENTS THAT PASSED IREAD-3, THAT ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE STUDENTS. SO IT REALLY TRULY DEPENDS ON THE\n\nSTUDENT. >> THANK YOU.\n\n>> ON YOUR ONE SLIDE, WE TALK ABOUT THROUGH THE CADRES WE ARE IN NOW, IN THE CURRENT CURRICULUM, WE'VE GOTTEN -- HOW ARE WE USING THAT NOW, INTERVENTION IN THE BUILDING, OR CORE CURRICULUM IN PLACE OF INTERBREEDING? ALSO ADOPTED FIRST GRADE, SO THAT WAS TO BE USED IN THE CLASSROOM ESCORT COLOR COME. WHEN THE CADRE PRESENTED US WITH THE THAT AWARENESS GRADE TWO WITH THE HAGGERTY THAT WAS GIVEN TO\n\nUS AS WELL. >> WE ARE USING TWO BUILDINGS,\n\nTHE CURRICULUM. >> AT THAT POINT, WE ARE SWITCHING THE CORE CURRICULUM TO THIRD GRADE? IS THAT THE CORE PORTION?\n\n>> YES, BECAUSE THAT STRUCTURED PATHWAYS ONLY FOR K-TWO. THAT FOUNDATIONAL THAN THEY HAVE STRUCTURAL LEGITIMACY. WE CHOSE THAT PATHWAY FOR K-TWO. THEN 3-4 HAS A DIFFERENT MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT.\n\n>> OKAY.\n\nTHE ONE WE WERE TAUGHT ABOUT YEAR TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ABOUT ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR STAFF LETTERS FOR OTHERS, CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT HOW WE PICKED THESE GROUPS . THE K FOR ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS, AND WHY WE'RE PUTTING -- NOT THAT OUR ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS AREN'T VALUABLE, I'M NOT -- BUT WHY ARE WE MAKING THE FINANCIAL AND TIME INVESTMENT IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE CLASSROOM TEACHING EVERY DAY VERSUS TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN MORE OF OUR TEACHERS WHO ARE IN THE CLASSROOMS EVERY DAY TEACHING OUR KIDS?\n\n>> GOOD QUESTION. >> AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL OF THAT K FOR LEVEL, YOUR PRINCIPAL, YOUR ASSISTANT\n\n[01:00:02]\n\nPRINCIPAL, AND YOUR TDS ARE THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TEAM.\n\nTHEY RUN THE PD, THEY OBSERVED THE TEACHERS, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT WORK WITH THE TEACHERS, AND GOES THROUGH THAT COACHING CYCLE, BUT THOSE ARE THE THREE PEOPLE THAT REALLY TRULY WORK IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THE TEACHERS. THOSE ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS CAME THROUGH THE PRINCIPAL SAYING THEY WANTED THE TRAINING THAT THEY CAN BETTER ASSIST THEIR TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM. SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT THROUGH THOSE K FORCES AND PRINCIPLES. THE LITERACY COACHES CAME TO ME AND SAID COACHES IN THE CADRE WERE GOING THROUGH LETRS, AND I ANYONE OVERWHELMING, BUT THEY SAID THEY'VE GOT OTHER PEOPLE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW, WHAT ABOUT A PERSON IN A COACH TO HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE AS WELL, BUT TO IMPART MORE TEACHERS IN THE COACHING CYCLES, SO WE WENT WITH THEM.\n\n>> THEN WE VENTURED OUT TO THE TEACHERS. I WOULD TELL YOU, AS I SAID EARLIER, WE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST AND PART OF THAT IS JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO TIME INTENSIVE. I THINK IT'S HUNDRED 60 HOURS FOR BOTH VOLUMES TO COMPLETE. AND THAT IS IN ADDITION TO THEIR TEACHER RESPONSIBILITY AND HOME RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL. SO, I THINK AT ONE BUILDING, WE MIGHT HAVE HAD THREE PEOPLE THAT WERE INTERESTED, OTHER THAN THAT, WE BARELY GOT OUR ONE PERSON. AND THEN, I OPENED THE LAST TWO SESSIONS THAT WE HAVE LEFT UP TO RESEARCH IS WHAT THEY DO ALL DAY. I THOUGHT THAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THAT AREA TO BE EXPOSED TO THE LETTERS. OBVIOUSLY FOR THE REASONS THAT MR. ORR HAD LIBERATED TO, AND RESOURCES STUDENTS THAT HAVE THOSE DEFICITS.\n\n>> >> LEGACY, THIS MIGHT JUST BE MY NOVICE BRAIN, BUT THE QUESTION IS VERY STRONG QUESTION. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CLARITY, IF THE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM, THEY ARE THE ONES WITH THE STUDENT HELPING THEM TO READ, I UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPAL AND ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL WANTED TO HELP, BUT IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH THE LETRS, HOW ARE THEY HELPING IF WE CAN'T FACILITATE THEM -- I FEEL LIKE -- I'M CONFUSED ON HOW THAT IS BENEFICIAL WITH -- WHY WOULD IT IT FOR SURE BE ALL OF OUR TEACHERS FIRST, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE THE FIRST ONE TO THE STUDENT TO EDUCATE AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE CHILD NEEDS LITERACY ASSISTANCE? AGAIN, IT IS THE TIME COMMITMENT, IT IS A HUGE TIME COMMITMENT THAT TEACHERS HAVE TO MAKE TO GO THROUGH THE LINK LETRS TRAINING, AND I DON'T BLAME THEM. IT IS A HUGE TIME COMMITMENT IN ADDITION TO ALL THE THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO TO BE A CLASSROOM TEACHER. SO THE THOUGHT PROCESSES TO TRAIN, SO THEY CAN ASSIMILATE THAT INTO EASIER CHUNK WHEN THEY PUT PD INTO PLACE WITH THE TEACHERS. THE TEACHERS ARE STILL GETTING IT, NOT IN A COMPREHENSIVE HUNDRED 60 HOURS.\n\n>> MS. TAYLOR, DO YOU WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE FEEDBACK OF WHAT YOU HEAR FROM YOUR TEACHERS? ARE THEY JUST NOT INTERESTED IN DOING IT, AND IS IT JUST TIME-CONSUMING? I KNOW WE ALL HAVE FAMILIES. I GET THAT. BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S NOT WITH OUR TEACHERS FIRST?\n\n>> I CURRENTLY AM GOING THROUGH THIS TRAINING, TOO.\n\nBECAUSE I WANT TO'S TO SEE WHAT IT WAS TO SAY OKAY, GUYS, HOW DO I GET OUR TEACHERS INVESTED IN THIS WITH US? AND I REACHED OUT TO DANIELLE ABOUT THAT, WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS, AND I THINK SHE'S RIGHT. I'M TAKING IT, AND IT IS A LOT LIKE IT'S THREE HOURS OF SITTING ON A COMPUTER, WITH THIS INSTRUCTION, FROM PRESIDENT ALBRIGHT AT HOME.\n\nFROM 430 TO 730 I'M ON HIS MEETING WITH THE FACILITATOR, AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF READING THAT I HAVE TO DO COMMAND WATCHING VIDEOS SO THERE'S THREE PARTS TO THIS TRAINING. READING THE INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL THAT WE HAVE, WORKING ON A CURRICULUM THAT WE ARE READING HIM AND THEN WATCHING VIDEOS THAT HELP US LEARNED EVEN MORE COMMON THAN GO INTO THIS FACILITATED CONVERSATION WITH THE LETRS TRAINING. SO IT IS A LOT. IT IS A LOT. AND RIGHT NOW, I THINK THAT TEACHERS ARE TIRED. THEY JUST ARE. AND SO TO ADD THIS TO THEIR PLATE TO TAKE OUT OF THEIR FAMILY TIME, IS ASKING\n\n[01:05:03]\n\nTHEM A LOT, EVEN IF YOU ARE PAYING THEM. JUST TO BE VERY FRANK AND HONEST. BECAUSE, IT JUST TAKES OUT TIME FROM THEIR\n\nFAMILIES. >> 'S ARE WE PAYING THEM TO BE\n\nDOING THE TRAINING? >> OKAY, SO, WHAT IS THE FIX TO THAT? I MEAN , ANOTHER WE'VE GOT PHENOMENAL TEACHERS IN A DISTRICT THAT ONE TO -- BETTER STUDENTS READING IN THEIR LITERACY COMPREHENSION, BUT IF THEY'RE NOT DOING THE TRAINING, WHAT'S -- WHAT'S THAT FIX?\n\n>> IF I MAY. >> I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS IT'S NOT THIS MOMENT OF TIME, AND WHEN IT PASSES, WE CAN'T EVER CONTINUE TO TRAIN PEOPLE. THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS. AND BECAUSE OF THE TIME -- THAT'S WHY WE DID THE TIERED APPROACH FOR TEACHERS, BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT -- FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW THAT IT BEHOOVES US, I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THIS, AND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW THAT IT BEHOOVES US THAT EVERY TEACHER GO THROUGH LETRS TRAINING, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS A GOOD USE OF TIME OR\n\nRESOURCES. >> I JUST MEAN THE ENGLISH READING AND LITERACY TEACHERS FOR\n\n>> THAT'S I'M TALKING ABOUT AS WELL. I DON'T KNOW THAT.\n\nTHAT THAT IS -- BUT WHAT I DO KNOW EVERYBODY NEEDS A FOUNDATION AT LEAST TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO ASK FROM THERE, AND MAYBE THAT SPARKED A CURIOSITY TO THEN PUSH FORWARD, AND THEN, I THINK SPEAKS TO WHY THE DEPARTMENT OF ED HAS OFFERED FOR EXAMPLE, THERE SIZE OF READING MODULES SO THAT -- AND THEY ARE INCENTIVIZING THAT AS WELL, BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S NOT PRACTICAL TO GET THE -- WHAT IS OUR FIRST TIER OF LETTERS TRAINING OUT TO EVERYBODY IN THE STATE. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PIECES THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE, AND I'M JUST GLAD WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME COMPOSITION SO THAT THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ADD TO THE FACT THAT CAMINO, NOT JUST A PERSONAL DIVIDER TO ONE AND LEARN MORE, BUT ALSO COMPENSATE THEM FOR\n\nTHEIR TIME. >> TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH MY HUSBAND, WITH MY FELLOW TEACHERS THAT WE JUST TALK LIKE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO INNATELY. WE LEARNED, AND THEN WE GO AND SHARE IT, BECAUSE WE ARE TEACHERS NATURE. SO I'M SHARING THIS WITH ANY TEACHER THAT WILL LISTEN TO BE,, DID YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. I EVEN SHARED WITH MY KIDS WHO STRUGGLE WITH DYSLEXIA, DID YOU KNOW THAT YOUR PARADE DID THIS? THERE ASKING ME ABOUT THIS. WE GET COLLEGE CREDIT FOR THIS TOO, AND I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL, BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE TEACHERS TALKING ABOUT IT AND BEING EXCITED ABOUT IT GIVES STUDY WITH A SMALL GROUP OF TEACHERS WHO DID ARE EXCITED ABOUT IT AND BECOME MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT TO SPARK THE INTEREST OF OTHERS TO WANT TO DO IT.\n\nTEACHERS UNCOMPLIMENTARY DEAL, DO WE UTILIZE IT TO FIND THAT I TEACHERS ARE GOING THROUGH UTILIZING THAT INFORMATION?\n\n>> WE ARE WORKING ON THAT COMMUNICATION BE COMMUNICATION OUT TO TEACHERS ALONG WITHOUT THROUGH OUR NEWSLETTERS THAT WE SEND OUT WE PUT IT OUT IN OUR NEWSLETTER AS WELL TO GET THAT\n\nOUT THERE. >> THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THE COMPLEMENTARY OR ANYTHING.\n\n>> OKAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP BOTH OF YOU.\n\n>> TEAM , THEY CAN GET CREDIT, CAN THIS BE APPLIED TO A DEGREE, I WOULD RECOMMEND HAVING CONVERSATION, I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE FOR THE TEACHERS TO WANT TO GO THROUGH THE TRAINING, AS WELL.\n\n>> YES THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE APPROVED IT THROUGH THOSE\n\nUNIVERSITIES. >> MAYBE YOU SAID THIS, CAN THE TEACHERS DO THIS TRAINING DURING THE SUMMER?\n\n>> THEY CAN, BUT THAT'S STILL A LOT TO DO IN A SHORT AMOUNT\n\nOF TIME. >> BUT 430 TO 730 EVERY DAY, ME, NOBODY ELSE IN MY HOUSE MAKES DINNER, I'M NOT CAN HAVE PEOPLE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE, RIGHT?\n\n>> SO I GET IT, THAT'S A LOT. >> I THINK ANOTHER PIECE JUST TO REMEMBER IS THAT CAMINO, AS A DISTRICT, AND AS A STATE AND\n\n[01:10:01]\n\nTHE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE, WE WERE EXTREMELY INVESTED IN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT METHOD OF LITERACY INSTRUCTION, AND IT TOOK US JUST AS MANY YEARS TO GET ALL OF OUR TEACHERS SORT OF ON BOARD, AND FULLY INVESTED IN THE UNITS OF STUDY, IN THE BALANCED LITERACY PIECE, SO, IF YOU READ -- HALF AS MUCH AS I PROBABLY DO ON THIS STUFF, THAT'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE WHOLE LUNCH AND AVERAGE OF FIVE NEW MAJOR INITIATIVES A YEAR, AND THAT'S A LOT TO THROWING TEACHERS, SO AGAIN, I THINK IN SOME CASES BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR LESS THAN A YEAR, THE LEGISLATURE, UTICA BOWEL -- THIS LAW WAS PASS AT THIS TIME LAST YEAR, SO SOME OF THE TEACHERS I THINK ARE WAITING TO SEE, IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO STICK BECAUSE THEY WERE TRAINED IN ONE WAY, THEY WENT TO COLLEGE LEARNING HOW TO TEACH READING IN ONE WAY, THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 10 YEARS, MAYBE EVEN LONGER THAT WAY, AND SO THIS IS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD, SO -- THE QUESTION WASN'T MEANT TO BE ANGRY THAT WE WERE TRAINING OUR SYSTEM PRINCIPLES, WAS MORE MEANT TO EXPLAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU DOING IT TO YOUR CLASSROOM TEACHERS FIRST INSTEAD OF THAT? ITHINK, TEACHERS DO A LOT, SO THEN TO ASK THEM TO INVEST ALL OF THIS TIME THE FIRST GEAR, SORT OF INFANCY OF WHAT WE ARE DOING, IS AN ARGUMENT THEY ARE HAVING AT THE STATE OUT AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE IT AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEAR, GIVEN SOME TIME TO BREEZES WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE DESIRES WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE TEACHERS THAT THEIR FELLOW TEACHERS THAT OF GOD THROUGH THE TRAINING AND SEE THE RESULTS ARE GETTING AND WHAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO WILL THEN COME I'M HOPING AT LEAST THAT THERE'S GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF FONO, OR THERE TO WANT TO DO THIS OR DO SOME SORT OF SCALED DOWN VERSION OF THIS, BUT AGAIN, IT HAS BEEN LESS THAN A YEAR, AND WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO SAY, EVERYBODY'S GOING TO DO IT, THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO DO IT NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT A FEASIBLE OPTION.\n\nTEACHERS HAVE TO WANT IT. THEY HAVE TO WANT TO DO IT TOO.\n\nBECAUSE YOU CAN FORCE ME TO GO SIT THROUGH A WEBINAR, DOESN'T MEAN MY ED IS CODE MAKE ME PAY ATTENTION, IF I DON'T WANT TO DO IT , SO BOBO FILED A PROVISIONAL WRITER WOULD'VE FORCED TEACHERS TO DO IT AND SPEND THE MONEY IF IT'S NOT GOING TO STICK WITH THEM. THEY HAVE GOT TO WANT TO DO IT AND LEARN IT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER STUDENT, SO THE LONGER WE GO, THE MORE -- I REALLY , TRULY BELIEVE MORE TEACHERS ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO IT. SO'S JUST SETTING UP THE FOUNDATION SO WE CAN SCALE IT WHEN TEACHERS REALIZE WHETHER IT'S A YEAR FROM OUR TWO YEARS NOW, THIS IS CAN A STICK, THIS IS ACTUALLY WORKING, THIS IS HELPING OUR KIDS. THEY ARE ALL GOING TO WANT TO DO, AND WE CAN SORT OF AT THAT POINT BE ABLE TO EXPAND\n\nAT THE RATE WE NEED TO EXPAND. >> TO YOUR POINT, HOW WE HAD TRAINED WITH BALANCED LITERACY, NOT EVERY TEACHER WENT OUT TO TEACHERS COLLEGE, WE HAD SELECT TEACHERS THAT WHEN OUT, AND CAME BACK AND SHARED THAT INFORMATION THE BUILDING LEVEL, SO PERHAPS YOU COULD LINK THAT LETTERS TRAINING TO THAT AS WELL. AND THEY HAVE BEEN CHARGED TO TAKE THE POINTS FROM THAT LETTERS TRAINING, AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE COVERED, IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY IN THOSE SUMMER TRAININGS, AS WELL, SO THAT IS HOW WE ARE SIMULATING THAT INFORMATION AND TO ALL\n\nOTHERS. >> FURTHER TO YOUR POINT WITH THOSE INTERVALS ALSO WERE TRAINED IN THOSE SKILLS,\n\nEITHER. >> THE WILL WOULD START TRAINING HER TEACHERS, THEY NEED THOSE LEADERS TO LOOK TO TO AM I DOING THIS RIGHT, AND HOW AM I DOING, CAN I GET SOME HELP? SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE TRAINING OUR LEADERS ALONGSIDE TEACHERS, TOO.\n\n>> OFFICE WHAT MS. PARKS JUST SAID, WHEN IT COMES TO OUR PRINCIPLES AND APS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE TRAINING, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE DOING THE OBSERVATIONS, OBVIOUSLY IN OUR TEACHER'S CLASSROOM, AS PART OF THEIR BUILDING MEETINGS, OR PD, ARE THEY -- CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT HOW THEY ARE COMING TO GETTING TO THE TEACHERS THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR DURING THEIR OBSERVATIONS? ARE THEY GIVING THEM SOME SPECIFICALLY THE TDS'S TOO, SO AS THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THEIR EVALUATIONS THEY ARE GETTING OBSERVATIONS FROM THEIR PRINCIPLES ORDER ASSISTANT\n\n[01:15:01]\n\nPRINCIPALS IN THE CLASSROOM SO THE TEACHERS SORT OF KNOW WHAT THEIR QUOTATIONS ON THE CLASSROOM IS TO GO THROUGH THESE TEACHER EVALUATIONS? THEY ARE SAYING, BUT THE EXPECTATION IN MY MIND WOULD BE THAT WHEN THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT PHONICS, THIS PARTICULAR INTERACTION OR INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE, AND THEN OUR COACHES AND OUR TDS'S WOULD BE MODELING\n\nTHAT FOR THEM. >> THANK YOU.\n\n>> WHEN YOU MENTIONED AT SOME POINT THROUGH THE PRESENTATION WE HAVE A COMMITTEE, IS IT ONE COMMITTEE, OR SARA COMMITTEE FOR ELEMENTARY COMMITTEE FOR OLDER KIDS?\n\n>> GOOD QUESTION. THERE IS A COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF ALL K-6. THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE, THERE TO BE REPRESENTATIVES FROM DIFFERENT BUILDINGS, AND THEN WE -- WHEN IT RECONVENES, WE WILL BE HAVING PARENTS BE A PART OF THAT PIECE OF IT. BECAUSE, WE WILL BE LOOKING AT RESOURCES ON\n\nTHIS ONE RECONVENES. >> LIKE YOU. SPEAKING OF OUR OLDER KIDS, BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR CURRENT -- ALL OF OUR CURRENT 7-12 KIDS WERE NOT -- MOST OF THEM WERE NOT TAUGHT THE METHODS OF SCIENCE AND READING. IS EVER GOING TO BE A TIME THAT WE OFFER ANY OF THE TRAINING TWO HOURS SEVEN THROUGH 12 TEACHERS AS A WAY TO SORT OF FILL SOME OF THE HOLES BUT SOME KIDS -- THEY MAY NOT BE --, YOU KNOW, THEY CAN ALL READ, BUT THERE MAY BE COMPREHENSION ISSUES, I'LL BE HONEST, MY EIGHTH GRADE DAUGHTER, IF YOU TRY TO GET HER TO SEND OUT A WORD, SHE LOOKS AT YOU LIKE YOU'RE CRAZY, BECAUSE IT IS NOT A SKILL SHE WAS TAUGHT. WHETHER IT BE THROUGH THEIR ENGLISH NINE CLASS, WHETHER IT'S DONE THROUGH THE PATHWAY TIME WHERE WE CAN IDENTIFY SOME OF THESE KIDS WHO MAY HAVE BIGGER GAPS IN THEIR LITERACY SKILLS THAT ARE TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM. OBVIOUSLY YOU READ TO LEARN AND LEARN TO READ, AND A STRUGGLE LITTLE READ, YOU ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE UNTIL HE PLACES. DO WE HAVE A PLAN TO -- THANK YOU FOR BRIDGING THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU GET OUT OF AN AMENDED SCHOOL, IT'S NOT LIKE, NONE OF US KNOW HOW TO TEACH PHONICS OR FULLY MIX THAT, BECAUSE WE WEREN'T TAUGHT IN COLLEGE, BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT WHEN YOU GET TO US, YOU SHOULD NOT TO DO THIS. THERE AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S STILL\n\nNEED THAT REMEDIATION . >> WHAT OF THE SILVER LININGS OF WORKING SOLO IN MY DEPARTMENT THE LAST FEW WEEKS, HAS BEEN EXPOSURE TO THAT NINE -12 CURRICULUM AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY ARE WORKING WITH, AND YES, THAT HAS BEEN A CONVERSATION THAT DR. KAYLEE AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE WEEK . HOW DO WE GET OUR SEVEN THROUGH 12 ADMINISTRATORS ON BOARD, AND THEIR ENGLISH TEACHERS ON BOARD, NOT JUST ENGLISH TEACHERS, BUT OUR WITHIN DISSEMINATING THE INFORMATION TO BETTER CONTENT AREAS.\n\nSCIENCE AND SOCIAL STUDIES ARE HEAVY CONTENT AREAS LITERALLY, THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE IN MIND AS FAR AS RATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO LEVEL UP. WE DO NEED TO\n\nADDRESS THAT MOVING FORWARD. >> IREAD-3, I AM EXCITED TO HEAR THAT ALL 13 SCHOOLS OPTED INTO THAT. OOPS WE TALK ABOUT THIRD GRADE RETENTION -- TO HAVE THAT EXTRA YEAR TO KNOW THAT THESE KIDS ARE AT RISK IS I THINK GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE -- WHEN YOU SAID NOT GIVING PARENT REPORTS FOR THE SECOND GRADE, WE CAN COMMUNICATE? IF WE HAVE SECOND GRADERS THAT ARE AT RISK OF NOT PASSING NOT EVEN CLOSE TO PASLEY, OBVIOUSLY THOSE WOULD BE CONVERSATIONS WE WENT OUT WITH PARENTS TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE TIME TO GET KIDS IF THEY NEED OUTSIDE INTERVENTION OTHER THINGS TO HELP THEM GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL A YEAR LATER?\n\n>> IT IS WRITER STATED THAT THERE IS NO STATE REPORT, NO STATE REPORT FOR GRADE 24 IREAD-3 FOR PARENTS FIT\n\n>> OH BUT WE GET EMAIL. >>\n\n[01:20:02]\n\nSPEAKERS ] >> WE GET REPORTS BASED ON OUR SERVERS SO WE CAN SHARE THAT WITH PARENTS. IF THEY ARE AT RISK AT GRADE 2, THEY WILL RECEIVE THOSE MTSS TALKING ABOUT TWO TO INTERVENTION AND THAT TYPE OF THING, AND MY EXPECTATION WOULD BE THOSE TEACHERS WOULD BE CONTACTING THOSE FAMILIES PERSONALLY AND TALKING THROUGH THAT PROCESSES.\n\nREQUIREMENT, IF WE HAVE SPACE AND CAPACITY WOULD THERE BE AN OPTION FOR PARENTS DROP INTO A SUMMER READING PROGRAM FOR THEIR KIDS AFTER SECOND GRADE?\n\n>> THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO. WITH THIS SUMMER HAVING TO LOOK GRADE LEVELS GO THROUGH THE TESTING -- INAUDIBLE - OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ] BUT IT COULD SHIFT BACK TO GRADE 2 FOR US, LOCALLY.\n\n>> THIS IS OPPOSITE. I THINK IT'S REQUIREMENT . HE NO APPEARANCE AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, I WENT TO OPTION TO DO THAT. I THINK THAT COULD BE -- IF WE HAVE STAFF IN SPACE AND RESOURCES TO DO IT. AND I THINK I ONLY HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TDS, AND A LITERACY COACH? THEY GO TO TWO DIFFERENT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AT THE K4 LEVEL. THEY WORK WITH TEACHERS ON ALL DIFFERENT CONTENT AREAS AT ALL DIFFERENT GRADE LEVELS. SO, THEY ARE WORKING AT A VERY, VERY BROAD LEVEL. WE HAVE THE MEMBER 5/6 LEVEL, WHAT IS ANATOMY AND, WHAT IS STEM? WE WORK WITH LITERACY ONLY, K, ONE, TWO, THREE TEACHERS. FOURTH GRADE TEACHERS CAN JOIN, BUT THEY CANNOT BE PART OF THE COACHING CYCLES. SO THAT WOULD\n\nBE THE BIGGER DIFFERENCE. >> THEN IS THERE ADDITIONAL TRAINING OF OUR CERTIFICATIONS THAT WE AS INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO HAVE BE A LITERACY COACH VERSUS A TDS.\n\n>> NOT NECESSARILY CERTIFICATIONS, BUT WE DO LOOK FOR COACHING EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'VE HAD IN THE PAST.\n\nTHEN, ARE WE SORT OF INCENTIVIZING THEM TO BE TRAINED IN LETTERS, ORTON-GILLINGHAM, OR -- INAUDIBLE - OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS ]\n\n>> SOME OF THEM HAVE GONE THROUGH THE TRAINING, BEFORE\n\nTHEY BECAME TDS. >> I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE.\n\n>> I HAVE A QUESTION. I REALIZE THE IRONY OF ME ASKING THIS QUESTION, BUT YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T WORK WITH THE LITERACY CENTER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THEY HAVE MOVED THEM COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR SECTION. SO, I KNOW THE REQUIREMENTS TO JOIN CADRE ONE WERE SUPER STRICT. I KNOW THEY LOOSENED IT LITTLE FOR CADRE TO THEM BUT I CAN'T FIND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CADRE THREE. YOU KNOW, ARE THE REQUIREMENTS? ARE THEY JUST TAKING ANYONE IS INTERESTED RIGHT NOW, AND THEN THEY ARE GOING TO --\n\nSPEAKERS ] >> THE SAME THING FOR CADRE THREE TWO CADRE TWO, THIS IS OPEN TO ANY SCHOOL IN THE\n\nSTATE. >> SO THE BRIDGE WE ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE RIGHT NOW, IS, WE CAN HAVE SOME CONVERSATION WITH THE ASSOCIATION ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT, IF WE GO INTO CADRE THREE, AND WHICH ABLE TO TAKE OUR CURRENT TDS'S THROUGH THAT PROCESS, THEN DOESN'T ALLOW US JUST TO STAND OUT A LITERACY COMPONENT? IT WOULD REALLY FUNNEL, BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CADRE MEMBERS. IT WOULD REALLY PRIORITIZE LITERACY OVER ANY OTHER TYPE OF INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT, WHICH ISN'T A BAD THING. BUT IT WILL BE A CHANGE OF THE NORM .\n\n>> FOR THE TWO YEARS. >> CORRECT. FOR THE TWO YEARS\n\nTHE CADRE IS IN THIS. >> SO THAT IS THE PIECE WE ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE RIGHT NOW, TO DETERMINE HOW TO MAKE THAT STEP? IT CERTAINLY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET US MORE COACHES AND BUILDINGS AND MAYBE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE ONE IN EVERY SCHOOL INSTEAD OF SHARING WHICH WILL ALSO BE OF BENEFIT, BUT THAT'S WHAT WERE LOOKING TO DO.\n\n>> SO LOOKING AT HAVING OUR TDS'S MOVE INTO LITERACY\n\n[01:25:04]\n\nCOACHES AT LEAST AS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. SO, I KNOW IN CADRE ONE, THE DOE WAS KIND OF REVIEWING RESUMES FOR THE COACHES. IS THAT STILL HAPPENING?\n\n>> YES, FOR CADRE TO, BOTH OF OUR LITERACY COACHES THAT SUBMIT THE RESUME, AND I BELIEVE THEY HAD TO DO ASSUME INTERVIEW WITH HIM, AND THEN WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO\n\nAPPROVE THEM. >> I KIND OF WHISPERED HERETO MISS BOX, BECAUSE -- SO THE TDS ARE LITERACY COACHES ARE EDUCATORS. WHAT IS IT CALLED BESIDE TEACHER FOR A STUDENT. FOR EXAMPLE, HONEST AND IT NEEDS REMEDIATION ASSISTANCE, EXIT IS IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THE TEACHERS THAT THEY HAVING THAT LITERACY -- AS WE TALK BEFORE, REMEDIATION? OR , DO WE HAVE SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS, OR INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS THAT HELP ?\n\n>> HONESTLY, AND I'M SORRY TO SAY, I WAS ASSUMING OUR LITERACY COACHES WERE FOR OUR STUDENTS, SO I WAS MISUNDERSTANDING, I THOUGHT THE TDS'S WERE THE TEACHERS AND THE COACHES WERE HELPING OUR STUDENTS WITH LITERACY AND EDUCATION, SO I GOT THE LOSS OF THEIR FOUR-MINUTE CLARITY, SIDE FROM OUR TEACHER AND CLASSROOM, WHOSE HELPING OUR\n\nSTUDENTS? >> HELPING STUDENTS AS THEIR MODELING FOR THE TEACHERS PACIFIC STRATEGIES, SO THAT COULD BE HAPPENING. WE DO HAVE SCHOOLS THAT WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE WITH THE REMEDIATION IA, AND WE HAVE OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS THAT RECEIVE PACIFIC INTERACTIONS WITH IA'S, AND E AND L TEACHERS .\n\n>> I HAVE A QUESTION, AND THIS MIGHT BE DIRECTED TO YOU , SARA, WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ARE FORESEEING THAT WE HAVE TO ALIGN WITH GOING FORWARD?\n\n>> I WILL TELL YOU THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE BEEN A PART OF HAVE -- I MEAN, WE'RE TRYING TO SEE WHAT'S GOING, THE SENATE BILL NUMBER 01 . THAT IS THE BILL THAT IS FOCUSED ON LITERACY IN TERMS OF WHAT IS STURGIS GOING TO DO IF THEY DON'T PASS IREAD-3, WILL THEY BE RETAINED? IF SO, WHAT PARAMETERS? SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE KEEPING OUR EYE ON.\n\n>> THAT BILL PASSED OUT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE LAST WEEK, SO IT WILL BE -- I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, ACTUALLY, I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE, JUST ATTEMPTED TO READ THE TEA LEAVES THERE, I SEE THERE IS -- GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S DESIRE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AS IT IS WRITTEN NOW, EVEN WITH SOME TESTIMONY FROM STUDENTS AND PARENTS AND TEACHERS THAT ARE NOT PARTICULARLY HAPPY WITH THE RETENTION PIECE OF IT, THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANY OF THEM HAVE NECESSARILY BEEN WILLING TO BEND ON, NOR IS THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF WHEN THIS WILL BEGAN. AND IF I HAD TO MAKE A PREDICTION, I DON'T SEE IT CHANGING BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH 15TH. THERE IS THE EXPECTATION THAT GOING FORWARD, THAT AS IT IS NOW, WITH THE DOE IS RECOMMENDING IT'S GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND MOVE FORWARD ON THE TIMELINE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN PROPOSING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF SESSION. SAYING STRANGER TH HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE SESSION. AND SOMETHING COULD COME OUT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT THREE WEEKS LEFT FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE, UNIT, ALL BETS ARE OFF SOMETIMES. BUT I THINK THE MOST PRUDENT PLAN WOULD BE TO PREPARE THAT THAT IS WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN. I THINK IS GOING IN WITH ALL 13 ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TO GET SECOND GRADERS TO TAKE IREAD-3 IS A GREAT STEP FOR THE DISTRICT TO BE ABLE TO BE PREPARED TO LESSEN THAT IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS, AND TO BE ABLE TO KNOW PRIOR TO THEM TAKING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE KIDS THAT ARE RISK.\n\nI WILL SAY THAT IS THEY CONTINUED TO BASE ONE, WHAT IF\n\n[01:30:07]\n\nTHEY ARE ON A IEP OR SOMETHING, WHAT IF THEY HAVE A PASSING MAPS SCORE, THERE ARE PIECES THAT ARE STILL BEING TALKED ABOUT. I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THE CHANGES, POTENTIAL CHANGES TO COME THROUGH WHETHER IT BE A SECOND READING OF THE HOUSE FLOOR, OR WHETHER IT IS DONE IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. I THINK THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE WIGGLE ROOM IS GOING TO BE FOR KIDS IS WHAT IS THE LIST OF GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTIONS, AND SORT OF WHAT LATITUDE THE DISTRICT -- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THEM THEMSELVES HAVE.\n\n>> HOPEFULLY, THAT ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION."
