The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:05 p.m., in room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Randy Neugebauer [chairman of the subcommittee] presiding. Members present: Representatives Neugebauer, Luetkemeyer, Royce, Garrett, Duffy, Stivers, Ross; Capuano, Clay, McCarthy of New York, Sherman, Beatty, and Horsford. Also present: Representative Posey. Chairman Neugebauer. This hearing of the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance entitled, ``Legislative Proposals to Reform Domestic Insurance Policy,'' will come to order. We will have opening statements, 10 minutes on each side, for the Majority and the Minority. And there may be Members in attendance who are not assigned to the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee. Without objection, members of the full Financial Services Committee who are not members of this subcommittee may sit on the dais today, but, consistent with our committee policy, they may not be recognized or yielded to for any purpose. If they have any written statements, we will include them in the hearing. At this particular point in time, I will give my opening statement. Thank you for being here today. I think this is an important hearing. We are going to talk about five legislative proposals to reform the domestic insurance policy in this country. This hearing will give many of the stakeholders in this room much-needed respite from our TRIA deliberations. And speaking of TRIA, I noticed that in the audience today, there are a few people here who may have a little bit of an interest in that subject. Just to give you a little bit of an update, we are working very hard on that issue. Just a couple of weeks ago, as you may know, we sat down with some of the Members of the Majority who sit on the committee and we laid out a framework for them to review. And we opened up a dialogue and a discussion with those Members, and we have been getting some very valuable feedback. And in the very near future, we plan to, once we make some refinements in that framework, sit down with the Minority, as well. Because it is our goal, hopefully sometime in June, to put out a bipartisan--hopefully, it will be a bipartisan bill on TRIA, to move out of this committee. And hopefully, we will then put it in the hands of leadership and let them determine when we might look at passing that on the House Floor. But I just wanted to give you a little bit of an update. As many of you are seasoned veterans around here, you know it doesn't always go on schedule, but that is the schedule that we have today. But today we turn our attention to some insurance reform legislation that focuses on protecting policyholders, offering more consumer choice for insurance products, and providing regulatory relief to reduce costs to domestic policyholders. First, we will examine legislation which ensures that regulations intended to rein in certain activities of large complex financial institutions don't trickle down to insurance companies that are properly regulated at the State level. H.R. 4510, which was introduced by Representatives Miller and McCarthy, would clarify that application of capital requirements to insurance companies that are subject to Fed supervision. This bill would simply ensure that capital standards intended for banks are not needlessly applied to insurers that own financial institutions. H.R. 605, introduced by Mr. Posey, would make certain insurance companies not subject to Federal assessments to pay for the orderly liquidation of failed financial institutions, given that State insurance laws already govern the process for unwinding failed insurers. Second, we will examine the legislation intended to protect insurance policyholders who are customers of a bank-affiliated insurance company. H.R. 4557, introduced by Mr. Posey, would allow State insurance regulators to intervene to protect the soundness of the insurance company affiliate with a failing financial institution. This will allow regulators to ring-fence insurance-specific assets so that policyholders are protected in the event of insolvency. And finally, the subcommittee will examine two draft proposals intended to increase consumer choice and to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens. The first, authored by Mr. Ross from Florida, would modify the Liability Risk Retention Act to allow self-insured liability risk-retention groups to create efficiencies by expanding their commercial lines of coverage. The second, authored by Mr. Stivers, would lessen the regulatory burdens associated with data requests from insurance supervisors. I applaud all of the sponsors of these bills that we plan to examine today. And separately, I would like to acknowledge Mr. Duffy for all of his hard work he and his staff have done on the Miller-McCarthy capital standards bill. I also would like to recognize Mr. Duffy, in that he just recently added another member to his family. I believe this is number seven. And it was a little girl, as I-- Mr. Capuano. Seven? Chairman Neugebauer. Yes. Mr. Duffy. I'm very productive. Mr. Capuano. A little overproductive. Chairman Neugebauer. So, I look forward to a very productive hearing. And now, I would like to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Capuano, for 2\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. Capuano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the panel for being here. I think there will be some good discussion today. I don't think there is going to be a lot of debate. There may be some basic issues. I think most of these issues that are proposed in these bills are reasonable and thoughtful. Again, there will be some details, but, overall, I am looking forward to some discussion to see if we can come up with easy ways to do some easy things without complicating them with unnecessary, extraneous material. Thank you very much. Chairman Neugebauer. And now, I would like to recognize Mr. Duffy for 1\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. Duffy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this very important hearing. And I appreciate the panel coming in and dispensing some of your wisdom and thoughts on the bills that we are talking about today. I just want to say a few brief remarks about the Miller- McCarthy bill, a great bipartisan proposal, I think, that goes a long way to fixing a problem that I don't really think existed. We know the Fed interpreted the Collins Amendment differently than probably most everyone else in this room. And so we now have, I think, a bipartisan legislative fix that addresses that Fed interpretation. Listen, I don't think anyone anticipated that we would apply bank capital standards to insurance companies. And that was never the intent of the Collins Amendment. The Miller- McCarthy bill will address that issue, making sure that we treat insurance companies very differently than banks in relationship to the capital which they are required to hold. So, I look forward to your testimony and your views on all of the bills, but specifically in regard to Miller-McCarthy. And I want to also extend my thank you to Mr. Miller and Mrs. McCarthy for their bipartisan effort in bringing out this proposal. I yield back. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. Sherman. Thank you. We need to pass the reauthorization of TRIA. That isn't on the agenda today. We saw with AIG an excellent case study. That portion of the enterprise that was subject to State insurance regulation remained healthy even though the top managers in the company were behaving like drunken sailors. Those parts of the company that were not subject to State insurance regulation crashed as if they were being run by drunken sailors. The other thing this proves is that credit default swaps are insurance and should be treated as such. And we probably would not have had a 5-year catastrophe in our economy had we done two things: one on the credit rating agencies; and the other is to require that portfolio insurance be called insurance. We are dealing with a number of bills today, two that are important and that I am happy to cosponsor. One is the Miller-McCarthy provision, summarized by the last speaker. And that is that we need to use insurance accounting principles to determine the creditworthiness of insurance companies. The second, the Policy Protection Act, introduced by Mr. Posey, and I guess I am the chief Democrat on it, recognizes that you should not invade an insurance company and seize assets in a way that endangers its policyholders simply to shore up a related and affiliated bank or other depository institution. What the bill does is it takes the policyholder provisions that are already in the Bank Holding Company Act and puts them also in the Thrift Holding Company Act. And, with that, my time has expired. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. And now, another gentleman from California, Mr. Royce, is recognized for 2\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. Royce. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And just a reminder for my friend from California, that the securities lending operation of AIG was regulated at the State level. But this hearing on legislative proposals to reform domestic insurance policy confirms a new normal for insurance regulation in the United States. It is basically a hybrid model with layered regulation by States and the Federal Government. The age-old debate of State versus Federal regulation is aged, is old. The new reality involves State regulators, it involves the Federal Reserve, and it involves the Treasury Department, both through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and through the Federal Insurance Office (FIO). Many of the bills before us today are a response to this hybrid model. In particular, H.R. 4510, the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act, offered by the gentleman from California, Mr. Miller, reflects a belief that insurance capital standards set by a traditional bank regulator, the Federal Reserve, need not be bankcentric and should, in fact, be tailored to reflect the unique and specific business model of insurance companies. I strongly support this bill. Regulation can take place at the Federal level, but it must be smart and specific to insurance operating models. And without changes, the current hybrid insurance regulation structure has the potential to fail consumers miserably. A system which produces regulatory confusion, hinders consumer choice, and discourages competition is burdensome for all parties involved. And I have said this before: It very well may be that the system has not failed, but since when has nonfailure been a synonym for success? Unlike some of my colleagues, I believe much of the problem is lack of uniformity at State levels. Within this hybrid framework, we should effectuate uniform domestic regulations. And toward this end, yesterday, along with Representative Tammy Duckworth, I introduced the Servicemembers Insurance Relief Act of 2014, a straightforward bill to ensure portability of auto insurance for all our servicemembers, who often move from State to State. This bill is a perfect example of a simple fix to the insurance regulatory framework that will make a big difference in the lives of American consumers. And I am hopeful this committee will move our new system of insurance regulation forward. We should start with immediate passage of H.R. 4510. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. I now recognize the gentlewoman from New York, Mrs. McCarthy, who is one of the primary authors of H.R. 4510, and has worked tirelessly on this issue. I thank her for her work. And she is recognized for 2 minutes. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding this hearing, and I thank my ranking member. I want people to know that when we did the Dodd-Frank Act, the bill that came out of this committee did not bring the insurance companies in. That was done over on the Senate side. And Senator Susan Collins of Maine has stated publicly now that she never intended to have bank capital standards apply to insurance companies. Our bill--mine and Mr. Miller's from California, who unfortunately could not be here today--H.R. 4510, this bill which I sponsor will help keep insurance products affordable and available by ensuring the correct capital standards are applied to insurance companies that fall under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. The intention was never to have them involved with this. This legislation will give the Federal Reserve more flexibility and help clarify the difference between the business of insurance and the business of banking. The legislation starts from the premise that applying the wrong capital standards, such as bank capital standards, to an insurance company is ineffective, disruptive both to the insurance company and its policyholders. In the absence of this legislation, the Federal Reserve has said it will be obligated to apply bank capital standards to insurance companies under its supervision. Since the insurance business model is so fundamentally different than the bank business model, those bankcentric capital standards would be very problematic for insurers and the many families and retirees who are their policyholders. As I have mentioned, Senator Collins, the original author of the amendment, is sponsoring it on the Senate side with the correction, exactly the same as this legislation is. She will be cosponsoring it with Senator Brown and Senator Johanns. I am pleased to support this commonsense legislation which will play an important role in preventing future financial crises. And I apologize. I had a root canal this morning, so I am still a little bit numb. With that, I yield back. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentlewoman. And now the gentleman from New Jersey, the chairman of our Capital Markets Subcommittee, Mr. Garrett, is recognized for 1\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. Garrett. Thank you. And, first, I want to begin by thanking the chairman for holding this important hearing to examine various proposals to reform the domestic insurance policy. But I would also like to thank all of our witnesses for serving on today's panel. July will mark the fourth anniversary of Dodd-Frank. And it is not surprising that in the nearly 4 years since Dodd-Frank became law the committee has had to consider a number of fixes to help clean up the regulatory mess that Dodd-Frank created. Now, one of the law's most recent messes concerns the Fed's application of bank-like capital standards to insurance companies. And under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve is required to impose minimum capital requirements on the companies it supervises, including insurance companies that own savings and loan associations and insurance companies deemed systemically important. However, insurers face very different capital structures than banks, and, as such, it would make sense that the Fed should not treat insurance companies in the same manner when it comes to assessing these capital requirements. Unfortunately, the Fed maintains that Dodd-Frank requires the application of bank-like standards, even though Congress never intended such a standard to be applied to these companies under the Fed's jurisdiction. So we have the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act now before us, and this would clarify that the Fed is not required to apply inappropriate standards to insurance companies that are already subject to appropriate State-based or foreign capital requirements. See, at the end of the day, inappropriate regulations hit our families and small businesses in the pocketbook, so I hope that this hearing highlights the need for yet another round of Dodd-Frank cleanup. I yield back. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. And now one of our newer members to the committee, Mr. Horsford from Nevada, is recognized for 2 minutes. And welcome to the committee. Mr. Horsford. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to Ranking Member Capuano. If I may take just a moment, I would like to start by saying that it is an honor and a privilege to serve on the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee. During the recession, my home State of Nevada suffered the highest rate of foreclosures in the Nation. And within my State, the congressional district that I represent was the hardest-hit. For my constituents, housing remains a top priority as we continue down the path to economic and financial recovery, so I am glad that we are holding a hearing on the five insurance bills before us today. But I am also a little disappointed that TRIA is not on that list. Before coming to this committee, I served on the Committee on Homeland Security. There I heard firsthand from businesses and employers on the importance of having access to affordable terrorism risk insurance. These job creators have told me that this insurance provides a safety net which allows them to invest in growth without fear of losing it all due to an act of terrorism. Most importantly, terrorism risk insurance reduces taxpayer exposure by confining most of the costs to the private sector. Without affordable terrorism insurance, many buildings, schools, and venues would remain uninsured against terrorist attacks, meaning that the government likely would pick up 100 percent of the tab for catastrophic losses. So, I look forward to working with the members of this subcommittee to move forward on these important issues. And, again, I am very honored to be joining this committee, and I look forward to the work ahead. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Ross, is recognized for 1\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing. Thank you, also, to our distinguished panelists for being here today and for your testimony. My discussion today is over my draft that aims to modernize the Liability Risk Retention Act and allows established risk retention groups, also known as RRGs, with adequate capital and surplus to offer to their members, and only their members, the inclusive commercial insurance packages that are the norm in today's commercial marketplace. Nationally, more than 25,000 educational, charitable, and Catholic institutions benefit from commercial liability coverage through an RRG. In my home State of Florida, more than 127 nonprofit organizations enjoy tailored liability coverage provided through an RRG, the alliance for nonprofits for insurance. These community organizations do important work for our society, and any penny they can save on insurance costs means one more penny they can spend on their charitable efforts. My draft is targeted legislation that would provide these customers with the convenience of one-stop shopping with an insurance group they trust and of which they are a member. My draft seeks to address some of the previous concerns about this expansion. And I look forward to today's discussions from all of our witnesses. In addition, my colleagues today have brought important bills for our discussion. I was pleased to cosponsor Representative Gary Miller's bill, which would allow the Federal Reserve to tailor capital standards to the business models of insurance companies. We must ensure that Federal regulation of insurance companies is properly crafted and does not result in increased costs for consumers. Floridians already struggle with the cost of insurance. I want to make sure that the Federal Government does not worsen that burden. I yield back. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. And now, the gentlewoman from Ohio, Mrs. Beatty, is recognized for 2 minutes. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Capuano. And thank you to our witnesses for their testimony here today. This afternoon, we meet to discuss a series of legislative proposals that amend both longstanding and recently passed laws impacting the operation of insurers in the United States. However, none of these bills in any way addresses the expiration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which is slated to expire in just over 6 months. I, and other Members on both sides of the aisle, believe that it is absolutely critical that we reauthorize this program in a timely manner so that insurers and insureds can renew their terrorism policies in a way that prevents lapses in coverage. It is clear that failing to do so would risk a complete pullout from the markets by these property and casualty insurers, which would be catastrophic for the real estate recovery and for the ability of companies to provide terrorism liability coverage for workers' compensation claims, which in many States is required by law. A recent study by the RAND Corporation found that premium increases in workers' compensation insurance may be insufficient to offset terrorism exposure. Mr. Chairman, I urge you to work with members of this subcommittee, as well as members of the full committee and the House to bring a TRIA reauthorization vehicle through markup to the House Floor post haste. It is not just a matter of helping insurers but, more importantly, helping the American economy as a whole. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentlewoman. And we will now hear from our witnesses. We have five distinguished witnesses today: Mr. Joe Carter, who is vice president of business development and marketing for United Educators; Mr. Gary Hughes, executive vice president and general counsel for the American Council of Life Insurers; Mr. Tom Karol, Federal affairs counsel for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies; Mr. Joseph Kohmann, chief financial officer and treasurer of the Westfield Group, on behalf of the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America; and Professor Daniel Schwarcz, associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School. Your written testimony will be made a part of the record. We ask you to summarize that in 5 minutes, and then we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the hearing. Mr. Carter, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF JOE E. CARTER, VICE PRESIDENT, UNITED EDUCATORS INSURANCE Mr. Carter. Thank you, Chairman Neugebauer, Ranking Member Capuano, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for this opportunity to testify in favor of the Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2014, which will allow established risk retention groups to offer additional forms of commercial insurance coverage to their members. We have also submitted a written statement for the record. I am Joe Carter, vice president of United Educators Insurance, a reciprocal risk retention group. And I am testifying on behalf of United Educators, as well as the Alliance of Nonprofits for Insurance Risk Retention Group, also known as ANI, and the National Catholic Risk Retention Group, Inc. We are pleased that VCIA and RIMS, the leading trade associations for captives and risk managers also support this bill. United Educators, ANI, and National Catholic owe their existence to the Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986. Congress was correct in assuming that risk retention groups would add capital to the insurance market, successfully moderate insurance pricing, and provide a stable source of insurance coverage for universities, nonprofits, professionals, and small businesses. In the 25-plus years since the 1986 Liability Risk Retention Act amendments, more than 250 risk retention groups have aggregated more than $2.5 million in gross written premium. According to the rating agency A.M. Best, the focused approach of risk retention groups has resulted in aggregate operating performances that are ``consistently better than that of their peer group in a commercial insurance market.'' Many nonprofits, small schools, churches, and small businesses buy packaged policies that RRGs cannot write today. Many of these entities are therefore forced to forgo the coverages and more specifically, to tailor risk management services that risk retention groups give to buy their policies outside of risk retention groups. If RRGs truly were only a response to a crisis and capacity for liability insurance, the member counts would surely have shrunk when the insurance industry came back into the market. Instead, risk retention groups have demonstrated that for certain types of similar organizations, collectively insuring each other is superior to relying on the traditional insurance sector. As member-owned entities, risk retention groups provide where they proactively address coverage realities through risk- based research, actuarial-based pricing, and coverage levels that are designed to be sustainable. And any resulting profits are passed back to the members who own us, keeping their operating expenses down. Our bill, which will permit seasoned risk retention groups to write other lines of commercial insurance, would bring more capital and more purchaser choice to the property and casualty market. However, not all risk retention groups could write other lines of commercial insurance if this bills becomes law. Instead, to write other lines, a risk retention group must be seasoned, meaning it must be licensed by the domiciliary State regulator and operating as a liability risk retention group for 5 years. They must also meet a minimum threshold capital requirement of $5 million and meet any other requirements that their State domiciliary regulator would require. This bill will not upend the Risk Liability Retention Act at all. Let me tell what you what the Liability Risk Retention Act Modernization legislation will not do. It does not authorize risk retention groups to offer personal lines of insurance or write group health, life, disability, or Workers' Compensation insurance. It does not alter any rights of nondomiciliary States. And it does not change a risk retention group's responsibility to comply with State laws on deceptive practices or unfair claims practices. In fact, one significant thing has occurred recently to strengthen State regulation of risk retention groups since the legislation was introduced: RRGs are now subject to the NAIC State accreditation standards. Thus, RRGs are now subject to the same solvency standards for State accreditation purposes as other insurance companies. The amendments proposed to the Liability Risk Retention Act by this modernization legislation will simply permit risk retention groups to offer their members, and only their members, the same comprehensive commercial insurance packages that are the norm in today's marketplace while benefiting from the customized risk management services that we are offering today. In closing, risk retention groups have dramatically improved risk management and provided tailored coverages for specialized niches like nonprofits and educational institutions. And modernizing this Act would allow us to more effectively and efficiently continue this important work, which will allow them to continue to focus on the things that they are--their mission driven. I thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Carter can be found on page 38 of the appendix.] Chairman Neugebauer. Thank you. And now, Mr. Hughes is recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF GARY E. HUGHES, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL, AMERICAN COUNCIL OF LIFE INSURERS (ACLI) Mr. Hughes. Chairman Neugebauer, Ranking Member Capuano, and members of the subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to provide you with the views of the American Council of Life Insurers on legislative initiatives addressing the way in which insurance is regulated in the United States. I would like to confine my remarks this afternoon to a single issue that is of paramount importance to life insurance companies, and that is the need to provide the Federal Reserve Board with the flexibility it believes it needs in order to apply insurance rather than bank capital standards to those insurance groups that now fall under its jurisdiction as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. Dodd-Frank requires the Fed to apply consolidated capital standards to those insurance companies that are determined by FSOC to be systemically important and also to those insurers that control savings and loan institutions. Two of ACLI's member life insurance companies have been designated as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), and one additional company is under review for possible designation. Eleven of our member life companies are affiliated with S&Ls. And taken together, these companies account for approximately 30 percent of the insurance premiums of ACLI's overall membership. But differently, a very significant segment of the life insurance business is now going to have its group capital standards set by the Federal Reserve. But beyond having a direct effect on these companies, the Fed's determination with respect to U.S. insurer group capital standards could very well be a precedent against which all insurers are measured, since it would affect such a large segment of the market. It could also be a bellwether for similar standards being developed by international standard-setters. The global competitive interests of U.S. insurers demands that every effort to be made to harmonize these emerging capital standards. The good news here is that the Fed appears to recognize that applying bank capital standards to a life insurance enterprise would be wholly inappropriate and could materially disrupt the company's operations. The frustration, as you all have mentioned, is that the Fed believes the wording of Section 171 of Dodd-Frank doesn't give it the latitude it needs to apply insurance-based standards. Now, to its credit, the Fed has temporarily exempted or deferred application of its capital rules to those insurance groups, thereby giving Congress time to clarify Section 171. But this is only a temporary respite, hence, the urgency for congressional action. We are very encouraged by the fact that Congressman Miller and Congresswoman McCarthy--and, Congresswoman, thank you very much for your leadership on this--have sponsored H.R. 4510, the Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014. And we would also note and thank the fact that a majority of the members of this subcommittee are cosponsors. And thanks to you as well, Mr. Chairman, for your support. This bill would provide the Fed with the very flexibility it needs to craft capital standards suitable in the context of an insurance company. Also, as you all have mentioned, Senator Collins, the original architect of Section 171, has made it clear that she never intended for the Fed to apply bank standards to insurers. And she, along with Senators Brown and Johanns, are advancing a bill similar to H.R. 4510 in the Senate. To be clear, the insurance industry is not trying to sidestep the application of strong capital standards as mandated by Dodd-Frank. We are simply working to ensure that at the end of the day, the applicable standards are predicated on a framework appropriate for the business of insurance, such as the existing insurer risk-based capital system. This is a system specifically designed by insurance regulators for insurance entities and is a comprehensive and accurate measure of these companies' unique risks. In summary, Mr. Chairman, ACLI's legislative priority in the House is passage of H.R. 4510. We believe it is imperative that the Fed be afforded the flexibility to utilize insurance- oriented capital standards for those insurance groups under its supervision. Substituting bankcentric standards would harm the affected companies, undermine rather than strengthen the supervision of insurers, and would be completely at odds with efforts to enhance the stability of the U.S. financial markets. We look forward to working with this subcommittee and with both Houses of Congress to pass this important piece of legislation. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF TOM KAROL, FEDERAL AFFAIRS COUNSEL, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANIES (NAMIC) Mr. Karol. Chairman Neugebauer, Ranking Member Capuano, and members of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee. I would like to thank you for holding this hearing entitled, ``Legislative Proposals to Reform Domestic Insurance Policy.'' My name is Thomas Karol. I am the Federal affairs counsel for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies. We are the largest property casualty insurance trade association in the country, serving regional and local mutual insurance companies on Main Streets across America as well as many of the country's largest national insurers. The 1,400 NAMIC members' companies serve more than 50 percent of the automobile and homeowners market and 31 percent of the business insurance market. We are pleased that the committee is focusing on the issues related to property casualty insurance industry, which is highly competitive, well-capitalized, and is a key source of strength and resilience for the U.S. economy. Our industry ensures the property casualty risks of the United States businesses and consumers, enabling the U.S. economy to thrive. It is imperative that we do not impede this well-functioning marketplace. NAMIC appreciates the opportunity to offer our comments. The most important proposal to NAMIC members is H.R. 4510, the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act. The Act would afford the Federal Reserve greater flexibility to apply accurate capital standards for insurers by amending Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act to clarify the application of capital requirements to insurance companies subject to the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board. There is widespread agreement that such flexibility is warranted and necessary. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the author of Section 171, has made it clear that she never intended to have bank capital standards apply to insurance companies. The Senator and a number of Members of the House and Senate have urged the Fed to adjust the capital standards for insurance companies to align with the business of insurance, rather than the business of banking. Despite this, the Fed maintains that it is constrained by the language in Section 171. H.R. 4510 resolves this question and acknowledges the fact that bank capital standards are not appropriate for insurance companies. It also recognizes the importance and appropriateness of statutory accounting principles. H.R. 4510 provides that the Fed may not use Section 171 to require insurance companies that are only required to prepare financial statements in compliance with State-based statutory accounting rules to also prepare financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Forcing such companies to prepare additional GAAP statements is a labor-intensive, multiple-year project that would cost policyholder owners hundreds of millions of dollars without adding any benefit in regulating the solvency and activities of the companies. Similarly, NAMIC supports the Insurance Consumer Protection and Solvency Act of 2013, or H.R. 605, which clarifies that the FDIC does not have the authority to assess insurance companies for the Orderly Liquidation Fund. The existing State-based resolution authority for insolvent property casualty insurers has a superb track record of protecting insurance claimants and policyholders at no cost to the taxpayer. Property/casualty companies and mutual companies in particular present almost none of the risk factors the FDIC is statutorily required to consider. All insurance companies already meet guaranty fund obligations for the insolvencies in their own industry and should not be assessed the cost of failures in other parts of the financial services sector. Both of these bills recognize that the business of insurance is fundamentally different than the business of banking, and that applying initial bankcentric regulations is inappropriate and damaging to the business of insurance. NAMIC also supports the Policy Protection Act of 2014. The laws governing thrift holding companies do not provide the same procedural protections as the Bank Holding Company Act to ring- fence the assets of insurance subsidiaries for the protection of insurance companies. The Policyholder Protection Act of 2014 simply amends the Bank Holding Company Act to provide the same protections for insurance companies organized as thrift holding companies. Tapping the assets of insurance units, particularly without the consent of the insurance regulator, would inappropriately threaten the financial structure, underpinning the insurance operations and undermining consumer confidence in the insurance industry. To protect America's insurance consumers, the Bank Holding Act protections should be extended to thrift holding companies, and NAMIC supports H.R. 4557. Finally, NAMIC supports the Insurance Data Protection Act, which would elevate the Federal authority to subpoena information directly from insurance companies to the Secretary of the Treasury, but also strengthen the confidentiality protections for the information and require reasonable reimbursement for the cost of compliance with the data protection. The Insurance Data Protection Act would not deny the Federal Insurance Office or the Office of Financial Research any relevant information or impede their functions but would ensure that they take reasonable steps to prevent unnecessary and duplicative reporting by insurance companies. In fact, the legislation would afford insurers many of the protections recently highlighted in the Administration's big data and privacy work group review. I want to thank the subcommittee again for holding this important hearing and for providing NAMIC with the opportunity to discuss these legislative proposals. I look forward to your questions.

KOHMANN, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND TREASURER, WESTFIELD GROUP, ON BEHALF OF THE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA (PCI) Mr. Kohmann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Capuano, and members of the subcommittee. I am testifying on behalf of the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI), which is composed of nearly 40 percent of the Nation's home, auto, and business insurers. My name is Joseph Kohmann, and I am the chief financial officer and treasurer of the Westfield Group. Westfield as midsized insurance company that has been in business for over 166 years with an A or higher A.M. Best rating for the past 75 years. We provide over 2,200 direct jobs in 31 States, partner with thousands of independent insurance agents to serve our customers, and are one of the top writers of farm business in the United States. Westfield also owns a community bank that originates roughly $300 million in loans annually, predominantly to owner- operated small businesses and individuals. We are not a Wall Street institution, but a very important regional provider of insurance and banking services to middle America. Both PCI and Westfield support strong regulation. But our growth is being restrained by unintended consequences stemming from an expansion of banking regulation in the Dodd-Frank Act that conflicts with State insurance regulation. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to impose the strictest bank capital standards on insurance holding companies with a depository affiliate, even just a small community bank. Westfield's business activities are primarily insurance. The measurements used to determine capital and leverage ratios for banking are completely different than those used to govern auto insurance or farm insurance. A strict application of bank capital requirements to our insurance activities just does not make sense. The Federal Reserve Board agrees. They recognize that insurance and banking operate with completely different business models. They have delayed implementation of the requirement until Congress can act. But not for long. Dozens of Members of Congress, including Senator Collins, who authored the original legislative requirement, have written to the Federal Reserve Board saying that this application of bank regulation to insurance is inappropriate. Fed Chair Yellen testified under questioning that this is an unintended consequence of the Act. Yet, the Board says they do not have the statutory flexibility to provide relief unless Congress acts. Please pass H.R. 4510 to help Senator Collins clarify the intent of her original amendment and to allow the Federal Reserve Board to apply appropriate capital standards to insurance companies. PCI strongly supports the other bills before the committee as well. H.R. 605 ensures that resolution of insurance companies and their assets is conducted by insurance regulators, not by a Federal banking agency. It would also prevent the FDIC, which is primarily responsibile for bank resolutions, from using insurance assets to support failing banks. Insurers are already responsible for resolving their own failures and pay for guaranty funds in every State to protect consumers. Do not let insurance policyholder protection funds be used to support risky investment firms and banks. H.R. 4557 requires Federal bank regulators, before transferring assets of insurance companies to banks, to ask the insurance regulator to determine if the transfer would harm the insurer. This seems like another commonsense clarification to limit a regulatory conflict of interest and to avoid harming insurance policyholders to support a bank. The proposed Insurance Data Protection Act would provide additional protections for confidential proprietary data shared among insurance companies and government entities and limit rather extraordinary regulatory subpoena power given to nonregulators. This will prevent potentially costly data calls by entities which neither supervise our companies nor are responsible for their solvency. The theme of all of these bills is that insurance and banking are fundamentally different. Congress has the opportunity to clarify that regulation of insurance companies and their activities should be conducted using insurance standards and by their supervisors. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. And I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kohmann can be found on page 72 of the appendix.] Chairman Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Kohmann. And finally, Professor Schwarcz, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF DANIEL SCHWARCZ, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW, AND SOLLY ROBINS DISTINGUISHED RESEARCH FELLOW, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA LAW SCHOOL Mr. Schwarcz. Thank you very much, Chairman Neugebauer, Ranking Member Capuano, and members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify. I am going to spend most of my oral testimony talking about several of the legislative proposals. But before I do that, I think it is important to foreground my remarks in certain facts that I think have gotten lost in this discussion. Those facts include that AIG securities lending program was at the heart of AIG's problems, in addition to its credit default swap portfolio. And that securities lending program, as mentioned earlier by one of the Members, was indeed subject to State regulation. Those facts include the fact that financial guaranty insurers, monoline insurers, contributed mightily to the crisis, and they were regulated by State insurance regulators. Those facts include that life insurers that had issued long-term guarantys, via annuities mostly, suffered severe capital shortfalls during the crisis that led several of them to apply for bailout funds and to receive bailout funds. The point I am making is this: I agree with everyone that insurance is different than banking, and it must be regulated in a manner that is different than banking. At the same time, insurance does raise systemic risks that warrant a robust Federal involvement in the industry. We cannot simply defer to State regulators when issues of systemic stability are in play. With that in mind, I want to talk about several of the proposed legislative initiatives. First, the Capital Standards Clarification Act. I support the vast majority of that bill. I agree that the Federal Reserve should not mechanistically apply bankcentric capital rules to insurance companies because insurance companies present different risks. And so for that reason, I agree that the Congress should clarify that the Fed has the discretion to tailor capital rules. Moreover, I think that it is a virtue of the bill that it allows and affords the Fed the discretion not simply to move away from simply mandating bank capital rules but also to tailor capital rules so that they don't simply replicate State risk-based capital rules but actually respond to the fact that while State risk-based capital rules are about policyholder protection, Federal capital rules are by and large about something different: They are about systemic stability. And for that reason, appropriate capital rules for federally-regulated insurance companies may depart in important ways from State risk-based capital rules. The legislation, the bill, as I read it, affords the Feds that discretion. What I am concerned about, though, is the last provision in the bill that would prohibit, as I understand the language, the Fed from demanding information from regulated insurance companies that is not included in SAP reports. One thing that we have to take away from the financial crisis is that systemic risk arises in unpredictable ways. And a regulator must have the capacity to adapt to new circumstances, to gather information in a way that allows it to see the full panoply of risks. There are ways in which SAP may not allow the Fed to do that. The most important and most clearly recognized is that SAP is an entity-centric accounting approach. It is not designed to reflect the risks of an entire conglomerate. It is designed to reflect the risks of individual insurance entities. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to get a sense of an entire insurance holding company simply using SAP. For that reason, it very well may be appropriate for the Fed to require either GAAP reporting or something different than either SAP or GAAP. Maybe something that is referred to as ``GAAP-like.'' Whatever it is, the Fed has to have the discretion if it is going to regulate insurers appropriately to demand the information it needs to adjust to the demands of systemic risk regulation. I am concerned that the provision in this bill that seeks simply to prevent duplicative accounting will actually be interpreted to limit the Fed's authority to demand relevant and necessary information from the entities that it regulates that is not captured in SAP accounting standards. I am also concerned about the Data Protection Act. The Data Protection Act may indeed retain the FIOs and OFR subpoena powers. But it has a provision that is virtually unprecedented as far as I am aware. That provision requires either the Treasury or the OFR to reimburse companies to the extent that they have to comply with a subpoena. The reason that we have the FIO and OFR monitoring insurance companies is because they raise certain systemic risks. Because they raise those risks, we need to make sure that those risks don't come to fruition. The costs associated with that should be borne by the company. If we force FIO and OFR to bear those costs, then we will politicize the subpoena process and will make it very difficult for that process for move forward in a way that is predictable. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Professor Schwarcz can be found on page 80 of the appendix.] Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. We will now begin the questioning. Each Member will have 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes himself for 5 minutes. Mr. Hughes, in your written testimony you mentioned that this bankcentric standard would harm the ability of life insurers to perform their fundamental business. We have thrown around a lot of terms here, ``bankcentric,'' ``capital standards,'' et cetera. But I think one of the things we sometimes have to do is we have to boil this down to the people that we are really trying to help here and to protect, and that is your policyholders and my constituents. Talk to me about, if the Fed were to move forward, if we didn't correct this, the young family out there in America, how could this impact them? Because I think that is the real issue here. Mr. Hughes. Mr. Chairman, I will give one easy example to maybe address that question. To address the needs of that family, life insurance companies often issue protection products that have promises that will extend 20, 30 years out. We back up those promises of those long-term liabilities with long-term assets. Typically, these are fixed-income securities, generally high-quality corporate bonds. So in our world of insurance and insurance regulation, our regulators like to see that 30-year promise to the family backed up by a 30-year high-quality bond. And the matching of the asset and liability lowers the risk of the enterprise. You take the same portfolio security, that same long-term bond in the portfolio of a bank, which has demand deposit obligations, very short-term obligations, and Federal bank regulators say, quite correctly, well, that creates a risk mismatch for the bank. They have short-term obligations. You don't want to back that up with an illiquid long-term bond. So the Fed would say the capital weight you give that bond, it has a very high capital requirement because it is highly risky in the hands of a bank. They basically would be forced to do the same thing for an insurance company. And I can't imagine a scenario where the promise we make to that family, that 30-year promise, is backed up by short-term Treasuries. I don't know the risk of not being able to meet a promise of 10, 20, 30 years out would be much higher. So that is an example of the same security in the hands of an insurance company as in the hands of a bank. And H.R. 4510 would enable the Fed to say, okay, it is a totally different balance sheet. Let's look at assets differently for an insurance company than we would for a bank. Chairman Neugebauer. And so that additional liquidity and capital would relate to higher premiums for the product that you have been offering? Mr. Hughes. Absolutely. Chairman Neugebauer. In other words, ultimately, the policyholders are going to pay for this mismatch in policy if the Fed were to continue. Mr. Karol, would you agree with that statement? Mr. Karol. I agree with that completely. The liabilities that a bank focuses on are subject to different risks than insurance, particularly property casualty insurance. The bank has credit risk, the bank has inflation risk, the bank has market risk. Where with a property casualty insurance company, it is basically the risk of the damage to the property or the underlying risk. It is basically a completely different business. Chairman Neugebauer. Mr. Kohmann, do you want to comment on that? Mr. Kohmann. No. I would agree with both Mr. Hughes and Mr. Karol. The core issue here is that the businesses are fundamentally different. It would increase costs and potentially create capital that would be addressing asset risk rather than liability risks. So, in my view, it would be no more appropriate to apply risk-based capital rules to a banking entity, which would create potential adverse motives for the wrong risks. Chairman Neugebauer. Thank you. Mr. Carter, who would benefit most from the Modernizing the Liability Risk Retention Act as proposed by Mr. Ross? Who are the beneficiaries? Mr. Carter. Mr. Chairman, I think that is a great question. And as we think about providing additional services, additional coverages to our members, we think about the smaller to midsized businesses. In our world, it is educational institutions that don't necessarily currently have a staff, don't have a staff for all of the training needs, all of their risk management, and risk management needs. And so when we think about actually offering property packages, property coverage offerings in our packages, we are thinking about ways to help them manage those risks in an additional--at a higher level than they do today. In a way, that also helps them maintain their budgets, not necessarily have to--we are giving them support, in other words, whether it is White Papers, whether it is online training, whether it is onsite visits, any number of Webinars and seminars. We are giving them a lot of support through the risk retention group model. And that is not only for United Educators, but also our risk retention group peers. We are only owned by them, and we are delivering more than just insurance to them. So this expansion would be very important to them. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. And now the ranking member, Mr. Capuano, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Capuano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, I think we have heard many of the items that relatively are noncontroversial. And to be perfectly honest, maybe I am wrong, but I think that the capital standards issue could be put on a suspension calendar and passed overwhelmingly. With a question about the GAAP versus SAP, I am not sure how I feel about it yet. I have some questions, but I will come back to it, because I don't know how much time I am going to have. I want to talk about the things that are more concerning in some of the other bills. And again, all of these bills have things which are easy to support, and some have questions. In particular, in H.R. 605, why--Mr. Karol, I think I am right that you testified in support of that. Why would we have to get rid of the orderly liquidation as a final backup opportunity? It is not the primary backup opportunity, not the primary process, as I understand it. But if everything else fails, why should we get rid of that? What does it hurt to have one final backstop in case, God forbid, we get into a situation where it is necessary? How does it hurt the industry? If I am wrong--I thought you were the one who testified in favor of that. Mr. Karol. Our position is that the Orderly Liquidation Authority should not apply, that the State-based system is adequate at this point, and that requiring duplicative payment by insurance companies is not fair, that there is sufficient backup by the State-- Mr. Capuano. So it is the up-front payment that you are concerned with? Mr. Karol. If the insurance companies are paying into the State authority, which is adequate, our feeling is that if the other banks and other financial institutions aren't paying into that as a backup to them, we shouldn't have to pay into the Orderly Liquidation Authority. Mr. Capuano. Again, I really have to go back to Mr. Schwarcz's comments. I have no problem with the concept of State-based regulation. AIG was regulated at the State level. We keep forgetting that. And I understand full well that the State regulators said that they don't do CDOs, which, of course, is lack of State regulation. So if that doesn't concern you, if that doesn't kind of ring a red bell, I am happy to look the other ways. Because I am not looking to impose it. I just look at the orderly liquidation when it comes to insurance companies as something that hopefully, God forbid, we will never need. But I would have a hard time saying, after what we just went through, I don't want to go through that again. And that is what the whole orderly liquidation is all about, is to try to prevent us from ever having to do that again. And again, if it doesn't work here for insurance companies, I am more than happy to discuss it. But to just throw it out I think is raising a risk that is potentially repetitive. Now, if it is overly burdensome, I am more than happy to talk about it. I would like to have some discussions at a later time, maybe not now, but to walk me through how we can maybe rebalance that. Again, I am not trying to hurt anybody. Mr. Karol. I would be happy to talk about it. Mr. Capuano. I guess I also want to talk about the reimbursement aspect. Again, on FIO, limiting their subpoena power, that is fine by me. They have never used a subpoena, to my knowledge, and I am not looking--I totally agree that they should ask everybody before they get the subpoena. Why in the world would we want them to--if they have to get to the point where they ever have to use a subpoena, why would we want to force a reimbursement? We don't do it to ourselves. Congress asks every single agency in the world for document upon document upon thousands of documents. Mr. Neugebauer and I were part of an oversight committee a few years ago. We got reams of documents. We didn't ask for reimbursement. Because asking for reimbursement is de facto a punishment. And in this case, it would for all intents and purposes say, how dare you ask for it? Why do we need a reimbursement aspect if you actually think that at some point FIO would ever need it? Does anybody support the reimbursement provision? Mr. Karol. My understanding of both the OFR and FIO is that they are not enforcement entities; they are basically entities that exist to determine what is going on in the market to predict what is happening-- Mr. Capuano. Information gathering. That is correct. Mr. Karol. And to get that. The amount of information that is available to them through the States and through the companies is extensive. We really don't know what-- Mr. Capuano. Which is why they have never used the subpoena power. They have never had to use it. And the likelihood of them ever using it is minimal. Mr. Karol. And everything we can think is that if such a request came through, it would be so extraordinary that, one, it should go through the Secretary of the Treasury-- Mr. Capuano. I have no problem with that. Mr. Karol. And that if it is that far outside of the normal business of the insurers, it would be fair to have that--that be reimbursed-- Mr. Capuano. But all that basically does is if it is so far out there, again, I guess it depends, I would actually think if it is so far out there, maybe there is a real problem that they are not getting answers to; that is the last step before a subpoena. And, again, I have no problem having the Secretary of the Treasury sign off. But it just says to me, basically, we are not giving it to you, period, end of issue. And if you do, you have to pay us for it. And, by the way, it is going to be an extraordinary amount of money, because these things do cost a lot of money. Hopefully, just having the subpoena power there is really what gets cooperation. This committee has done it relative to HUD. We have worked out between ourselves, not issuing a subpoena, having HUD come up with certain documents that we worked out in an agreement after some pressure was put on. It just strikes me as a problem. I guess my last 14 seconds is, with today's world, GAAP and SAP, it really doesn't matter to me. GAAP, SAP, FAAP, BLAAP, it doesn't matter. Pick one accounting standard. I don't care which one. Why would we not want to have one uniform accounting standard so we can compare apples to apples? Now, I understand the transition from any accounting standard to another one is always problematic. Why would we want to have 2 or 3 or 4 or 10? Why not just one? And it doesn't matter which one to me. Pick one. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. And now-- Mr. Capuano. I will get to that later. Chairman Neugebauer. I am sure that if you would like-- Mr. Capuano. No, no, no. It was a rhetorical question. Chairman Neugebauer. The Chair now recognizes the vice chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Luetkemeyer from Missouri. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Interesting discussion today. We had a discussion earlier today with regards to systemically important institutions and had the whole discussion about capital requirements, Basel implications, international standards being applied to our companies. It is like, holy cow, this is like subcommittee repeat 2.0 here. But it is great to be with you, and thank you for your testimony. It reinforces a lot of what we heard this morning. Mr. Kohmann, I would like to start with you. Your company, as I understand it, not only is an insurance company, but also owns a bank. Is that correct? Mr. Kohmann. That is correct. Mr. Luetkemeyer. So you understand firsthand the difference between the two, and that the capital requirements for each one are completely different. They are two completely different business entities with two completely different business models. What do you think about the capital requirements of banks being applied to insurance companies? Mr. Kohmann. Thanks for the question. As we said earlier, I think they are fundamentally, as you said, different businesses, and accordingly, applying capital standards to them in the same way would be inappropriate and perhaps risky. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay, how do you define ``risky'' here? Would these standards affect safety and soundness of the bank and/or the insurance company? How is it going to affect costs to your clients or the insurance clients, the bank clients? Can you give us a little synopsis. Mr. Kohmann. Sure. I think, first off, you have the potential by applying an asset-based capital model to insurance companies would not appropriately address the risk of an insurance company, particularly a property casualty company like Westfield, where the majority of the risks are underwriting and reserve risks. So that capital approach could be misguided and put policyholders at risk by not adequately addressing the main risk of an insurance company. The alternative would be true if you had tried to apply an insurance-centric approach to a bank. We are not talking about that, but trying to think about the other way helps lend clarity to how inappropriate it would be to apply those rules to an insurance company, and I think there is a potential in doing that to certainly add costs to policyholders and consumers in the event that you come up with an inappropriate capital amount and/or more complexity. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Mr. Karol, your group deals with lots of different sizes of insurance companies. Would this--how is it going to affect the small ones in your group versus the large ones in your group? Mr. Karol. I think these types of standards would affect the smaller companies much more. They have less ability to adjust to the-- Mr. Luetkemeyer. Would it drive them out of business? Mr. Karol. It could. Mr. Luetkemeyer. What do you think the potential is for, say, the smallest 25 percent of your companies, how many of them would you think-- Mr. Karol. We have members who write in a single county. We have members who write in very small areas, and to apply these types of standards or the potential for applying these types of standards to them could put them out of business. Mr. Luetkemeyer. They don't have the ability to raise the kind of capital it is going to take to make this all work, is that what you are saying? Mr. Karol. Yes. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. Mr. Hughes, you deal with life insurance folks. What kind of costs do you think would be pushed on to your clients if some of these standards were implemented? Do you have a different business model, a little bit different business model than P&C guys? Mr. Hughes. Yes, it is. For us, it is the cost of capital. If we have to have inordinate capital charges because of the long-term securities we are holding to match long-term liabilities, as the chairman noted, it is going to force companies to pass on those costs to policyholders, which will raise the costs of insurance. Mr. Luetkemeyer. How many of your companies went out of business in 2008 as a result, a direct result of the downturn? Mr. Hughes. We had two very small companies that went out of business ironically because they had an inordinate amount of their reserves in Fannie Mae preferred, both of them. Mr. Luetkemeyer. So it wasn't management of the company, it was investments that they made? Is that right? Mr. Hughes. Precisely, yes. Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. So, out of all that turmoil, you lost two small companies, and now you are being impacted in a very negative way with these cumbersome and overzealous regulations. Thank you for your comments. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. Now the gentlewoman from New York, Mrs. McCarthy, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor, when you were talking, something hit my mind that when we were writing the bill, so I just want to see, to clarify to see if this satisfies you. When you were making points about SAP and GAAP, and I agree with my ranking member, our bill says an insurance company that is not federally-traded and is already regulated by the State level is not required to prepare a GAAP statement, but that doesn't stop the Fed from asking for additional information because we were concerned about that because I happen to think most insurance companies are good players, but we wanted to make sure that we could keep them to be good players. So I hope--and if you have any questions we would be more than happy to sit down with you and talk about it. Mr. Schwarcz. Sure. Two quick points: The first one is that it may be necessary for certain insurers in order to arrive at a consolidated sense of how risky the company as a whole is to have GAAP reporting, and that is because SAP reporting is inherently entity-centric. It doesn't allow for the positioning of all assets and liabilities on a single balance sheet in a way that is simple, okay? And so the Fed, I know, right now is investigating how they can take SAP and leverage it to get at a sort of holistic perspective on a group, but from my understanding, this is very difficult, if not impossible. The second point, though, is I am concerned with the current language that if the Fed, for instance, said, look, we don't need you to go, to give us a full GAAP reporting, but what we do need is lines, is, say, line 5 of a GAAP report on this or whatever it is, we would like you to provide that to us. The company could come back and, under the language as I read it, say, ``No, we are not required to provide you anything above and beyond what SAP requires,'' and so to the extent the information you are seeking is not encompassed within SAP, you are overstepping your bounds, and the way, the reason I see that is because otherwise, it is very hard to understand how you could effectuate this principle, right? Because what if they ask for five items on the GAAP report or 10? At some point, it becomes the full GAAP report. So I think there needs to be clarification about the Fed's capacity to get individual pieces of information, and I also think that there may be circumstances in which it would be, in fact, appropriate to have full GAAP reporting if it is necessary to, if such reporting is necessary, to arrive at a holistic sense of the risk that an insurance group poses. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. As I said, we will follow through with that, and certainly, we will talk to Congressman Miller because we have the intentions that there would be a stopgap there to be able to have the Fed ask questions if they felt that there was something reasonable there. But thank you, and we believe that we covered it, but we will take a second look at it. As far as the others, I know everybody in Congress, or I should say the American people, the majority of us actually do work well together. We sit together. We try to work out things that we know are going to affect us back home in our States and certainly our businesses. So I think this is a perfect opportunity that you can see what we do, and we have worked on this committee bipartisanly. It doesn't always work, but this time around, it truly has. So, with that, from the testimony that I heard and I appreciate everybody coming in to give their opinions on it, I think all the questions that I would have asked have already been asked, so I am not going to ask them again. The testimony has actually been very excellent, and I think it just shows that we can work together. But I will say, during Dodd-Frank, and I actually like to call it Frank-Dodd, we spent a year and a half working on that bill together, all of us, and we all had questions. Unfortunately, when it went over to the Senate, they had a very short period of time to work on it and didn't look at the consequences on some of the language that they put in there. I will say that Barney Frank took one section, and even when we went to the second section, we went back to the first section to see if we were countering each other, but as this place has never passed a perfect bill, it will never pass a perfect bill, but that doesn't mean we can't make technical changes, and that is what we are doing today. With that, I yield back the balance of my time, sir. Mr. Luetkemeyer [presiding]. Thank you. With that, we go to the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Duffy, for 5 minutes. Mr. Duffy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Whether Dodd-Frank or Frank-Dodd or sometimes we call it by other names as well, but we won't say that here, I do appreciate the bipartisanship that has gone on in regard to some of the bills that were proposed today. Maybe the panel could help me a little bit with some history. Is it fair to say that we have a pretty long and deep history of banking in America and some crises that come from the banking sector? Does banking sometimes create risk throughout our history for the larger economy? Anybody? You guys all agree with that, right? I am not crazy? Banking creates risk? Isn't that kind of why we all come together and we get really freaked out in banking crises? And what also freaks us out is when the taxpayer bails out banks. We don't like that. We want banks to have sound capital standards so those investors in banks will bear the risk and the loss and not the taxpayer, and I think a lot of us feel the same way about the insurance sector. Do we have the same kind of history in the insurance sector with creating systemic risk similar to that of the banking sector? Mr. Carter, do you know? Mr. Hughes? Anyone? You can jump in, chime in. Mr. Carter. I don't personally believe so. I think that the business models, as we have heard before, are very different, and the way they run their businesses are very different, and I think if you look at the history of failures, of institutional failures, I think there is a difference. I don't know the exact numbers, but that would be my statement on it. Mr. Duffy. Maybe I will throw it out a different way, if you look at it from the Great Depression to the Great Recession, oftentimes we have had banks that have caused some of these crises and runs on banks. Is there another historical example that you can give me where a crisis in America has been caused by the insurance sector? Mr. Schwarcz. Yes. Let's not forget about 2008, right? This is a pretty important salient example, and again, I think it is really important to remember that the AIG securities lending program, monoline financial guaranty insurers, life insurers, all of those involved State insurance regulation and involved crises. Mr. Duffy. And we will get to that. Mr. Schwarcz. Okay. Mr. Duffy. Besides AIG, any other example you can give me? Mr. Schwarcz. Yes. There has been historical precedence of a run on a life insurer; on Executive Life, there was a run. Mr. Duffy. But systemic risk-- Mr. Schwarcz. It depends on-- Mr. Duffy. --by insurance companies. Mr. Schwarcz. Right, I would say that it depends--the other example, ironically enough, would be the 1980s liability crisis. The Risk Retention Act was initially passed because there was a crisis of lack of availability of liability insurance. Mr. Duffy. Was that systemic risk however? Mr. Schwarcz. It depends how you define systemic risk. It was significant enough that it was on the front page of magazines, and Congress acted to pass-- Mr. Duffy. But it wasn't going to take down the whole economy like what the theory was in 2008 or the Great Depression? Mr. Schwarcz. I think that is right; it was different. Mr. Duffy. Besides Mr. Schwarcz, because I have heard many argue that as you look at the crisis of 2008 and you look at AIG's role, many will say it was the financial products division that was regulated by the OTS that caused the risk in AIG, and it wasn't the traditional insurance arm that was regulated by the State that really caused the risk in AIG. Do you guys agree with that assessment, outside of Mr. Schwarcz? I know what your opinion is on this one. Mr. Hughes. I think I would strongly disagree with Mr. Schwarcz's analysis. I don't think you can point to AIG and say, that equals the whole insurance industry. It doesn't. I think all financial intermediaries discovered during the crisis that their risk modeling probably didn't go far enough out, and that worst case was a whole lot worse than they had anticipated. But if you look at the way the insurance industry came through the crisis, both the life segment and the property casualty segment, I think, without question, we came through that crisis in better shape than any other segment of financial services. So, yes, AIG was a problem. Yes, there were companies that were under severe stress. But the entire financial system, not only in the United States but globally, was under severe stress, and I think the industry acquitted itself quite well in the crisis. Mr. Duffy. As we look at FSOC, they are there to identify risk to financial stability, and we just recently had Prudential that was designated as an SIFI. What concerns me, though, is how the vote on making Prudential a SIFI, you have the OCC, the FDIC, credit unions, the Fed, Treasury, and the CFPB--which has its own problems--all voting to designate an insurance company as an SIFI, but you have the President's designee who was approved by the Senate voting ``no'' as well as Mr. DeMarco from the FHFA. And I think as I finish off here, the quote is pretty powerful from Mr. Woodall, who said, ``The underlying analysis utilizes scenarios that are antithetical to a fundamental and seasoned understanding of the business of insurance, the insurance regulatory environment, and the State insurance company resolution and guaranty funds system.'' You have bankers and credit unions designating Prudential as an SIFI, and those who know insurance best are voting ``no,'' and saying these other guys don't understand it. I think that is pretty powerful as we analyze how FSOC is looking at insurance. I yield back the time I do not have, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. And now the gentlewoman from Ohio, Mrs. Beatty, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Ranking Member, and like my colleague from New York, many of my questions have already been asked, but I would like to pick up where Ranking Member Capuano left off. It seems like, as we have been working through Section 171, we have come to a pretty good technical fix to this, but it seems like there were still some discrepancies in which accounting standards should be used, and I think that is where Mr. Capuano was going, and it looked like Mr. Kohmann and Mr. Hughes and Mr. Carter were getting ready to jump in there. So let me pose the question to any one of you in this fashion: Would you explain how the application of, let's say, statutory accounting principles versus general accepted accounting principles could result in a different compliance expectation? Mr. Hughes. I think this is one of the more intriguing questions with this legislation, and I read Mr. Schwarcz's testimony, and it caused me to go back and read your legislation and what it actually says. There isn't any question that GAAP accounting and statutory accounting have fundamentally different purposes. GAAP is overseen by the SEC. It is intended to ensure fairness in the marketplace, maybe protection of investors. Statutory accounting, as Mr. Schwarcz noted, is really to protect, to make sure that the solvency of the company is sufficient to protect the policyholders. Now, whether the Federal Reserve Board at the end of the day, given the latitude that your bill would give them, would just say, fine, we are happy with statutory accounting, I am not sure that they would. We had begun a discussion with the Fed early on to say, it is not that hard to come up with some mechanical analogue to consolidated GAAP financials, it is not audited GAAP, but if you need certain information, it is not that hard to come up with some sort of analogue that would give you what you want. Now, those discussions stopped because the Fed said that under Section 171, we can't get there anyway. Even if you gave us that information, we couldn't rely on it. So your legislation would do two things: one, it would enable to us restart that conversation with the Fed; and two, if we did come up with a workable analogue, cost-effective, not audited GAAP for a mutual, it would enable the Fed to rely on that as they comply with their statutory mandate. So as we read your legislation the way it reads now, we think it adequately addresses the accounting issue. Mr. Karol. There is no reluctance whatsoever to provide the information. I think the question is to require insurance companies who use statutory accounting, which is a more conservative system, based on the interests of the solvency of the company, to have them adopt an entirely different set of reporting standards that are based, again, as they said, for shareholder or investor reasons, under the Financial Accounting Standards Board would impose a burden upon our members for a purpose that may or may not be important to the Fed. Mr. Schwarcz. The concern I have is that if the solution is that we need something in between SAP and GAAP accounting, okay? We need you to use GAAP accounting in this respect or SAP accounting in this respect. We need SAP accounting plus. The language, as I read it, is quite ambiguous with respect to the question of whether or not the Fed could demand it, and I think just on the technically statutory interpretation as an attorney, one could make a very good argument, if one were so inclined, that the companies are not required to provide anything in addition to SAP or, alternatively, anything in addition to SAP that could be construed as being required by GAAP. And the key point I want to make is the Fed as the regulator of these entities needs the flexibility to be able to see these entities on a holistic basis and to prescribe accounting standards that facilitate that. Mrs. Beatty. Mr. Kohmann? Mr. Kohmann. I would just add and agree with Ranking Member Capuano that if we could get to one standard, wonderful, but we are not going to do away with statutory accounting for insurance purposes, and I think, with all due respect, Professor Schwarcz, the Fed in their examination process and otherwise I think certainly has the ability to request any and all information that they want, and I think most companies would do their best to accommodate those requests. I think at the heart of the SAP versus GAAP is the systematic reporting required to the Fed through their reporting system. There is really no way to only provide one set of financial data. So I think the requests that you are talking about that are more from an examination perspective certainly would be accommodated. I think it is a systematic approach to accounting that is troublesome because it does create significant additional cost and complexity to do that reporting, which certainly adds costs to policyholders and depositors. Mrs. Beatty. Thank you. Mr. Schwarcz. Could I just add one thing? I don't want to overstep my bounds. I just want to respond quickly. Mrs. Beatty. Okay. I didn't know if-- Mr. Schwarcz. Quickly, okay. To be clear, what I am talking about is that the Fed might decide, ``We systematically, every quarter, want you to report to us items that are not required by SAP because we want to take those into account, say, in your capital standards. So, every quarter, we want you to report to us X, Y, Z that are not covered by SAP because we think they are important in terms of us monitoring you on a persistent basis, in terms of us coming up with capital standards.'' That is what I am talking about, and it seems to me that the statutory language would not permit that. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentlewoman. Now the gentleman, Mr. Stivers, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Stivers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you recognizing me, and I appreciate you holding this hearing on these important bills. Before I start, I typically have an aversion to opening statements, so I don't request to do them, but I do want to make sure everybody in the room understands the unique background of my fellow Buckeye, Mr. Kohmann, who not only is a CPA, he was a CPA at Ernst & Young, and he has been a CFO for a bank and for an insurance company, so he is in a unique position with regard to the capital standards clarification bill that we have talked about recently through the gentlelady from Ohio as well as Mr. Capuano from Massachusetts and others on the committee. I think almost everyone has talked about that bill. But, Mr. Kohmann, from your position, having been a CFO at a bank and understanding how banks work and now being at a property and casualty company, can you tell me, do you think a bank and an insurance company are exactly the same and the same exact capital standards would work for the two different business models? Mr. Kohmann. Thank you, Congressman. No, absolutely, as I stated before, they are different. But I would add that having been a CFO for both entities, both I and Westfield would be supportive of strong capital standards for both types of institutions, so I believe that strong and prudent capital standards for banks are necessary and as well as strong and prudent and appropriate capital standards for insurance companies. The problem herein lies that one or the other is not appropriate for both so we need unique capital standards. Mr. Stivers. Is there anybody on the panel who believes that the McCarran-Ferguson model for regulating insurance is not working? I would note that no one shook their head ``no.'' The State-based standards for capital work very well, and I know that the gentleman from Wisconsin talked earlier about the fact that State-based regulated entities had no problem through the entire financial crisis. And the capital standards that the States are imposing under the McCarran-Ferguson law, which has been working for 70 years, is still working and working very well. You talked a little bit through the gentlelady from Ohio's questions about the issues with statutory accounting versus GAAP accounting. Is there anything, Mr. Kohmann, that didn't come out in that discussion that would cause additional expense to insurance companies, whether they be mutual insurance companies or nonmutuals? Mr. Kohmann. No, I think what came out of the dialogue was appropriate. I think there is no question that the requirement to provide GAAP statements in addition to statutory statements would be an additional burden, which would basically create expense and complexity, which ultimately would cost policyholders more in premiums. Mr. Stivers. Has your company put a price on what that would cost your policyholders? Mr. Kohmann. We have not specifically, no. Mr. Stivers. Can you tell me, would it be in the thousands or the millions of dollars for a company the size of Westfield? Mr. Kohmann. It would be more than a million. Mr. Stivers. So, for medium to large insurance companies, you are talking about six-, seven-, eight-digit costs, tens of millions potentially in some companies? Mr. Kohmann. I can't speak for other companies specifically, but that would be my suspicion, yes. Mr. Stivers. Thank you. I appreciate that. The other bill I want to talk a little bit about is the Data Protection Act that I have a discussion draft out on. It is a bill that has changed from a bill we did last year, and I know there has been some discussion in the committee by the ranking member of the fact that Congress doesn't reimburse, but Congress is usually subpoenaing other government agencies, so it is government agency to government agency, but in Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 2706 there is a similar provision to what we are talking about that deals with law enforcement, and when they subpoena commercial or other folks and they reimburse the cost, and I know that Mr. Schwarcz, I am not sure if you said it was unprecedented, but I wanted to make sure you knew the precedent of Title 18, Section 2706. Are you familiar with that section? Mr. Schwarcz. Yes. My understanding is that there is not another precedent for a monitoring agency or an agency that is meant to assess risk to a marketplace having to pay for that, and I would also say that even in the context of subpoenaing-- Mr. Stivers. I am running out of time, but those are regulatory agencies, and that is why, and so the State-based regulators regulate, we already talked about that, under McCarran-Ferguson, regulate insurance companies, but this is additional, this is much more akin to the law enforcement model because these are not regulators. So thank you for the time, Mr. Chairman. I know I am out of time. I appreciate the witnesses' cooperation, and thanks for being here. I appreciate your information. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. Now the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Ross, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Schwarcz hinted earlier about a 1986 crisis in insurance that I think led to what resulted in the liability risk retention amendments that I think have done very well. In fact, Mr. Carter, if it were not for the risk retention groups, what would your members avail themselves of in terms of a market for liability coverage and, in this particular case, in my draft, property insurance coverage? Mr. Carter. Thank you for the question. I think during the times of a crisis, when most of the traditional insurance markets do not feel that they can continue to offer the coverage, it is very, very difficult for the businesses to find the coverages that they are going to need, whatever that be. Mr. Ross. You have a unique risk, too, don't you? Your members have a unique risk that you don't find in a commercial line's product. Would that not be the case? Mr. Carter. I think, to the extent that there is liability, obviously there is liability inside of our industries as well as others. However, you are correct that the industries, the specific industries that turn to risk retention groups and tended to gravitate to them, nonprofits, educational institutions, many of those were difficult to cover for those traditional insurance markets. So we were formed during that time, and what makes the model really work is during very difficult times, over the course of the years since that time, there has been at least one event that has changed the market, created a market cycle, I should say. Risk retention groups tend to grow quite a bit because of our commitment to those members, so we are not looking to grow outside or we can't grow outside of that. Mr. Ross. Correct. You can't offer your product to somebody else outside your membership? Mr. Carter. We cannot offer it; that is correct. Mr. Ross. You are not in the business of being an insurance company. You are in the business of providing a particular service, in most cases a nonprofit or charitable service for which you have a unique risk. Now, if you didn't have the risk retention groups, is there a residual market for coverage? Mr. Carter. Not that I know of. Mr. Ross. And if there was such a market, wouldn't it have to be most likely provided by a government? Mr. Carter. That is correct. Mr. Ross. Such as an assigned risk pool? Mr. Carter. That is correct. Mr. Ross. Such as what we saw in Florida and what we have seen in other States? So if we don't have affordable coverage for your members, then they can't provide their service, and if they can't provide their service, which is a nonprofit charitable service, then: one, where does the client go, and two, who insures that risk? Just because the services aren't being provided by your organization doesn't mean the risk for those services is not going to still be out there because somebody, most likely a government, will provide those services. Mr. Carter. That is correct. Mr. Ross. Now, with regard to capital standards, and I just want to ask Professor Schwarcz this particular question. I understand, I just want to make sure, you are not suggesting that FIO now have regulatory authority, are you? Mr. Schwarcz. No. Mr. Ross. Okay. And when you consider the cost of compliance as well as the cost of increased capital having to be held, would that not play into any cost-benefit analysis as to whether a regulation should be implemented or not? Mr. Schwarcz. Yes. Mr. Ross. And in this particular case, if we are not clear on the Collins Amendment and that we don't have bankcentric capital standards apply to insurance companies, we may very well have a situation where the cost of compliance may outweigh the affordability of the product? Mr. Schwarcz. Yes, I am in agreement that the language making it clear that the Fed has discretion to tailor capital rules to insurers is a good idea, and I agree that the risk, the cost-benefit analysis is relatively clear on that. Mr. Ross. And I would assume as well, Mr. Kohmann and Mr. Karol? Mr. Karol. Yes. Mr. Hughes. Yes. Mr. Ross. I yield back. Chairman Neugebauer. I thank the gentleman. And now the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Garrett, is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Garrett. Great. So, I thank the panel again. Going back, I will start from the right. Professor Schwarcz, you made the comment--and I want to see where you are going on this--before that there were a number of insurance companies who had problems and failed regulations, and you referenced AIG and a couple of other ones, and for that reason, we should have, in your words, turned some of this over to Federal regulation in this area. I am paraphrasing. Mr. Schwarcz. Yes. The basic argument is that we saw that insurance can be systemically risky in more limited circumstances than banks. Mr. Garrett. Right. Mr. Schwarcz. For that reason, we need a Federal layer of oversight and protection. Mr. Garrett. Protection, right. Mr. Hughes, I think somebody asked you about how many carriers, insurance companies failed, and I think you alluded to only a handful, and that a couple of them actually failed not because of their own doing but because of Federal regulation because they were encouraged to buy trusts secured in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So this is where I am sort of confused, Professor. If you look at the numbers, the number of insurance companies that failed is on one and a half hands, it is AIG and a couple of other ones, and actually, weren't the two major companies that failed actually also regulated by the Federal Government at the same time? Mr. Schwarcz. So, to be clear, there were several insurance companies that received TARP bailout funds. Mr. Garrett. Right. Mr. Schwarcz. Many more than applied, okay? So, there were many. And there were many insurers that contributed to the crisis without necessarily failing. One important point to recognize-- Mr. Garrett. The important point is that, by and large, they didn't fail or they didn't actually have to get government backstop or support except for a couple. Mr. Schwarcz. Several-- Mr. Garrett. And the ones that did get the support actually were regulated. AIG, which was probably bailed out the most of all of them--the Office of Thrift Supervision, they were supposed to be doing it. The other one at the very top that got it was a bank holding company, and who would that--wasn't Hartford a bank holding-- Mr. Schwarcz. Hartford was a recipient. Mr. Garrett. Not a bank holding company? Mr. Schwarcz. I do not believe it was. Mr. Garrett. So AIG would have been the top; they were government-supervised. So it seems as though the ones that got the most money also had a Federal regulator that failed, and if you look at most businesses or financial institutions that failed, they would be on the other side of the ledger. They would not be insurance companies. They would be the banks, and weren't the banks regulated by the Fed? Mr. Schwarcz. It is funny, we all keep talking about the banks, a lot of the crisis was caused by an unprecedented expansion of shadow banking. So the point is this-- Mr. Garrett. I know, the point-- Mr. Schwarcz. That was new. And the point is you can't just say, oh, well, banks are the problem so banks are going to be the problem in the future. Systemic risk arises in new ways. Mr. Garrett. Right, and that is why we need to have regulators to do the job, but apparently-- Mr. Schwarcz. Right, monitors and regulators who have the powers to do the job. Mr. Garrett. But the regulators didn't do their job. We had Secretary Geithner here back in 2009, and he was answering a question--I was just seeing this from earlier--and he said that in 2009, after he had just left the New York Fed, that, in his words, ``I just want to correct one thing, I have never been a regulator for better or worse.'' So here is a guy, one of the regulators that we are supposed to be turning all this control over to, being paid $400,000 a year, being in the job of heading the New York Fed testifying to Congress that, ``I am not a regulator.'' Is this exactly where we should be in turning over the authority to when, as Mr. Hughes and others on the panel have testified to, we don't really see the problem on the State level? We see the failed regulation at the Fed, at the New York Fed, at the Office of Thrift Supervision, and on other issues outside of the realm of this panel, such as the SEC, with other areas as well. It seems as though it is endemic as the problem is where the Federal regulators have gotten involved and failed to do their"
