        "text": "Hello WMS Rocks!\n\nI am thrilled to be the principal of Westfield Middle School and a part of Westfield-Washington Schools! I have been humbled and honored by the amazing welcome I received from the community. It is a truly special culture that became evident from the moment I was hired. I have lived or been adjacent to this district for over 20 years and watched as itâ€™s grown and thrived. This is the primary reason I am excited to be part of such a dynamic team at Westfield Middle School.\n\nTogether, with our exceptional group of educators, I am dedicated to upholding high academic standards while nurturing a love for learning that extends beyond the classroom. I encourage open communication and collaboration between school and home, as the partnership between parents and educators leads to the continued success of our vibrant and close-knit community.\n\nAs we prepare to embark on this journey, let us remember that the success of our students lies in the unity of our community. No matter the size of WMS, I assure you that your child is not a number. Together, we will empower each student to dream big, persevere and achieve greatness.\n\nGo Rocks!\n\n-Stacey Swan"
