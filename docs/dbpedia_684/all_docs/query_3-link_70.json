District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.[4]\n\nAwards and recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Intermediate School was awarded the National Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive, during the 2004-05 school year.[5] Washington Elementary School was honored by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program in 2019, one of nine schools in the state recognized as Exemplary High Performing Schools.[6]\n\nFor the 1994-95 school year, Westfield High School was named as a \"Star School\" by the New Jersey Department of Education, the highest honor that a New Jersey school can achieve.[7]\n\nSchools\n\n[edit]\n\nThe district has a central kindergarten, six neighborhood elementary schools (grades 1-5), two middle schools (grades 6-8) divided by a \"North Side / South Side\" boundary, and one high school (grades 9-12).[8] The schools in the district (with 2018–19 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics[9]) are:[10][11][12]\n\nEarly childhood\n\nLincoln Early Childhood Center[13] (with 310 students; in grades PreK-K)\n\nAudrey Zavetz, principal\n\nElementary schools\n\nFranklin Elementary School[14] (580; 1-5 - North)\n\nEileen Cambria, principal\n\nJefferson Elementary School[15] (442; 1-5 - South)\n\nSusie Hung, principal\n\nMcKinley Elementary School[16] (341; 1-5 - South)\n\nMarc Biunno, principal\n\nTamaques Elementary School[17] (401; 1-5 - South)\n\nDavid Duelks, principal\n\nWashington Elementary School[18] (309; 1-5 - North)\n\nAndrew Perry, principal\n\nWilson Elementary School[19] (355; 1-5 - North)\n\nCrystal Marsh, principal\n\nIntermediate schools\n\nRoosevelt Intermediate School[20] (777; 6-8 - North)\n\nBrian Gechtman,[21] principal\n\nThomas Alva Edison Intermediate School[22] (844; 6-8 - South)\n\nMatt Bolton, principal\n\nHigh school\n\nWestfield High School[23] (1,865; 9-12)\n\nMary Asfendis,[24] Principal\n\nPublic school students are also eligible to apply to attend the Union County Vocational Technical Schools, which include Union County Magnet High School, Union County Academy for Information Technology, Union County Academy for Allied Health Sciences, Union County Vocational Technical High School and Union County Academy for Performing Arts.[25]\n\nPress\n\n[edit]\n\nWestfield High School publishes a weekly student newspaper during the school year called Hi's Eye. Established in 1935, the paper publishes 33 issues per year with a monthly Arts and Entertainment insert called Iris. The Hi's Eye is unique among many student run newspapers in that it is weekly and completely self-funded. The motto for the Hi's Eye is \"For the students, by the students, since 1935.\"\n\nThe middle schools and elementary schools also publish a brief newspaper written by their students, for their students. Theodore Roosevelt Intermediate School publishes an issue of The Rough Rider 12 times a year. Thomas Alva Edison Intermediate School publishes The Edison Insider a few times a year. Woodrow Wilson Elementary School publishes an issue of The Wilson World twice a year.\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nCore members of the district's administration are:[26][27]\n\nRaymond A. González, superintendent[28]\n\nPatty Ramos, business administrator and board secretary[29][30]\n\nBoard of education\n\n[edit]\n\nThe district's board of education, composed of nine members, sets policy and oversees the fiscal and educational operation of the district through its administration. As a Type II school district, the board's trustees are elected directly by voters to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three seats up for election each year held (since 2012) as part of the November general election. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the district's day-to-day operations and a business administrator to supervise the business functions of the district.[31][32][33]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
