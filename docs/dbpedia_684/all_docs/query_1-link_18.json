        "text": "Dear WMS Families and Community Members,\n\nHappy November and Happy Thanksgiving! It is my hope that everyone will be able to spend some quality time with friends and family next week.\n\nWe have a lot of great things happening in our classrooms and hallways of WMS! New this month, I have included a \"What's Happening?\" section from each team/PACK, and you will have the opportunity to get a glimpse into each classroom every month.\n\nPlease join us for our annual chorus concert on December 6th at 5:30 p.m. and holiday band concert on December 13th. Mr. Emken, Mr. Gomes, and our band/chorus students put a significant amount of time into preparing for these performances, so I hope to see you there!\n\nI am pleased to share that National Junior Honor Society will be returning to WMS! Our new academic advisors are Ms. O'Connor (Team 73 Writing) and Mrs. Jordan (Team 83 Math). We will share information with students and families in the near future, including the minimum qualifications. We look forward to inducting students later this winter!\n\nLast month, I hosted our first all school assembly/pep rally and we had a great time! The purpose of this monthly event is to build school spirit within our community and to enjoy some quality time with all students and staff. We started with a pumpkin cleaning contest by PACK and ended with our students mummifying their teachers using toilet paper! In between the contests, we had a special performance from the Westfield High School chorus. Please be sure to check out the photos and videos on our WMS Facebook page. Our next assembly will be on December 1st.\n\nAs we enter the season of giving thanks, I'd like to take this opportunity to share how thankful I am for our school community. Our students, faculty/staff, caregivers, and community partners make WMS a wonderful place to be and I am very proud to be your Principal.\n\nI wish you all a very happy and healthy Thanksgiving!\n\nAll the best,\n\nJesse\n\nMs. O'Connor, Writing: In Writing class students have been developing characters using figurative language, descriptive details, and feedback from their classmates. They are currently putting together portfolios to show what they’ve been learning. Next up we’ll be researching about the Middle Ages and writing Historical Fiction.\n\nMr. Huard, Science: Welcome to Grade 7-3 Science with Mr. Huard. We started the year with some team building Science activities, and we have been working on our Natural Disasters Unit on OpenSciEd. We will be finishing up our Tsunami based lessons. We are trying to have the students think in terms of how they would study and prepare for any type of natural disaster. In November we will begin our Contact Forces unit. The students will get to break things and see how Newton’s Laws have an “impact” on our everyday lives.\n\nMs. Costello, Science: In mid-October, Social Studies students completed their Five Themes of Geography Country Research Project. Each student chose a country and researched how the five themes impacted that country. In November we will focus on Central and South Asia. Mrs. Dion, Reading: Students have been learning two annotation strategies to use while reading (notice and # summary). We have used these two strategies while reviewing literary elements such as: plot, character, setting, conflict, and theme. We have also practiced discussion strategies such as: using classmates name, stems and evidence from the text to support our thinking. Next up we will be reading historical fiction to support the research and writing being done in Ms. O'Connor's Writing class.\n\nMs. Nielsen, Math: Students have been learning about proportions and how to solve for a missing number. We have used strategies like the ‘heart method’ or cross multiplication and simplifying fractions to help find ‘friendly’ numbers to work with. We have spent time dividing fractions and students are making great progress. This week, we used our proportional solving skills to complete a digital escape room. We will be working on proportions for a couple more weeks.\n\nMr. Dearborn, Science: In Science, we have been investigating the chemistry behind why a BathBomb makes bubbles when placed in water. We have run several tests on the gas produced and found a few possible candidates. Next, we will be looking at the chemical formulas of the reacting substances to see if we can narrow it down to the one gas being created. After this, we will finish the unit with an assessment that will take what we learned about BathBomb chemistry and apply it to the Taj Mahal and what is happening to this historic building.\n\nMrs. Hurley, Math: In Math 8, we have been working on getting to know The Real Number System and classifying numbers. This week our focus has been on approximating square roots without a calculator. In Algebra, we have finished our unit of equations and are moving onto learning about Relations and Functions.\n\nMs. Hollister, Social Studies: The local election happened November 7th, so we have been hard at work learning how active citizens prepare for voting and elections to keep our democracy healthy. Some of the things we have covered are: Registering to vote; Identifying your ward and polling place; Finding and using the sample (specimen) ballot; Candidate evaluation. Please encourage your children to talk about their learning with you, and if you are able, bring them with you to the polls the next time you vote. They are excited to see the process of voting and civic participation in action!\n\nMrs. Britt, Writing: We have now become figurative language experts! Our visual figurative language poems were a fun way to kick off the year. We are continuing to utilize our StudySync curriculum and work on our suspenseful narrative writing pieces. Ask your student how their suspense story is going!\n\nMs. Kostecki, Reading: In Reading, we just completed “The Landlady” by Roald Dahl. This text was used to examine how authors create suspense in their stories (Limited Point of View, Setting, Dramatic Irony, and Cliffhangers). Students can carry these strategies over into their Writing class as they create their own suspenseful stories. Next, we will continue practicing active reading strategies through the use of annotation. As students read, they will interact with the text by:\n\nAsking Questions\n\nWhat does this word mean?\n\nWhy did the character…?\n\nWhy did the author make the choice to…?\n\nMaking Comments\n\nThis part reminds me of…\n\nI was surprised when…\n\nThis page shows…\n\nI predict that…\n\nMrs. Guyott, Math: Algebra students worked on solving equations including solving literal equations which they completed a scavenger hunt together on. Math 8 students finished their topic on Exponents and Scientific Notation. Students began learning about the Real Number System.\n\nMs. Modestow, Reading: Reading students are in the middle of their short story unit, having read \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" and \"The Lottery.\" They are working on annotation skills, summary writing, and identifying mood. Students have also just finished their first SSR novel. We are headed into a paired-reading unit for our next SSR novel. In WIN students are exploring prefixes.\n\nMs. Cook, Writing: Writing students have completed their narrative writing assignment, and are currently working on a “finish the story” project, using “The Lady or the Tiger?” short story. They have also been working on grammar skills in StudySync, including commas, dashes, spelling, and transitional words and phrases.\n\nMs. Johnson-Corwin, Social Studies: Civics students spent the month examining the impact of 5 key documents (Magna Carta, Mayflower Compact, English Bill of Rights, Cato’s Letters and Common Sense) on the American colonists view of government. Students then analyzed historical editorial cartoons before taking a turn and creating their own based on the Big Ideas and Colonial Influences. At the end of the month we shifted gears and began looking at the election process at a state and local level.\n\nMs. Garelick, Science: Science students have been discovering the chemical makeup of bath bombs throughout our chemistry unit using deduction and experimentation. We are currently analyzing the molecular structure of water to understand its chemical notation. This active and engaging unit requires much discussion and interaction among classmates.\n\nMrs. Jordan, Math: We are starting out the month of November without calculators (gasp!). The kids were reluctant to give up their safety nets, but as this unit progresses, their mental math skills will improve. We are introducing square and cube roots and the kids should be able to approximate square roots by the end of the month!\n\nMrs. Osowski, Reading: In reading class we have been reading the novel, Monster by Walter Dean Myers. Through this novel study we have been examining how Myers develops the story plot and characters through his use of dialogue. Students have enjoyed taking on various reading roles as we unfold the gripping felony murder trial of the protagonist, 16 year-old Steve Harmon. We have also explored texts by Bryan Stevenson and Shirley Jackson to analyze how multiple pieces address similar themes. As we progress into November, students will continue to develop their text analysis skills through writing their own comparative analysis pieces.\n\nMs. McIntire, Writing: In writing class, we have been analyzing how and why authors include figurative language in their writing. Currently, we are looking at the story The Monkey's Paw to analyze a plot, characterization, setting, and elements of fiction. Students will soon be beginning to write their own continuations of The Monkey's Paw story. To do this students are developing their own plot, setting and characters, who will then experience the freaky repercussions of making a wish upon the cursed paw.\n\nMrs. Humphrey, ESL: In ESL we have been working hard to implement our new curriculum: Bridges! Students in Foundational I ESL are learning about identities and what makes people unique and different. We are proud of who we are and where we are from. Students are reading texts such as “Burrito Man.” They are analyzing how characters change throughout a story. We are also learning about simple present, future, and past tense verbs. In Foundational II ESL, students are also reading about identities and what makes them unique. We are reading about ancestors and showing pride in our cultures. Students read short stories from the text “Honoring our Ancestors.” We learned about the different elements of poetry. We are currently practicing using different tenses of verbs; including irregular past tense verbs. Both levels of ESL will be making connections to language arts, science, social studies, and math during the month of November.\n\nMr. Piper/Mrs. McCarron, Social Studies: Civics students spent the month examining the impact of 5 key documents (Magna Carta, Mayflower Compact, English Bill of Rights, Cato’s Letters and Common Sense) on the American colonists view of government. Students then analyzed historical editorial cartoons before taking a turn and creating their own based on the Big Ideas and Colonial Influences. At the end of the month we shifted gears and began looking at the election process at a state and local level.\n\nMr. Mullett, Science: In Pack 83, students have spent most of the last unit (Chemistry) deducing what components make up a bath bomb. By observing the phenomena and working through various experiments and tests, students have moved from discovering the ingredients in bath bombs, to delving into the properties of gases such that we are now testing the gases. Next up will include a more detailed lesson on atoms and molecules. Our end game goal is to have students able to perform a transfer task, applying all strategies learned towards a related situation.\n\nMr. Novetsky, Art: The 7th and 8th grade art classes have been very busy the past few weeks. 7th graders completed “Imaginary Architecture” drawings that use simple perspective as well as other devices to create scale and location. Following that we moved on to “Mythological Creatures”. Students learned about the role of myths and the oral traditions of various cultures. We discussed hybrids and the ways that each student’s creature could embody various characteristics by incorporating elements from different animals and even machines. We then moved on to graphic design. Students were asked to design either a book cover for an autobiography that would represent their future selves or a greatest hits album cover, that spanned their careers as musicians. We are currently designing innovative shoes with students working in teams of three as they explore the finer point of collaboration, delegation and communication. 8th graders have worked this term to master basic drawing skills including perspectival drawing, light and shadow as well as ways to elevate these rudimentary skills to more expressive and creative heights. Currently they are making large circular paintings for the “Portal Project” These paintings will be exhibited throughout the school and are designed to elicit specific responses in those students, faculty and staff who see them. We explored questions about public art including public murals and graffiti, tracing these traditions back to the earliest forms of human expression such as the ancient cave paintings in Lascaux, France that are estimated to be 17,000 years old!\n\nMrs. Scott, Library: ELA classes have been visiting the library every other week. Students are learning how the library is arranged and how to find a book using Destiny, the catalog. I am very excited that we have so many enthusiastic readers at WMS! Here is a link to our Library website, students can access the resources from school and home. We are also participating in Senator Velis’ “Thank a Veteran Project.” Students are learning the history of Veterans Day and showing their gratitude to our military by creating letters and cards for them.\n\nMrs. Guerrette, Math Intervention: In October, Math Intervention students worked on review of operations with decimals and fractions, areas of polygons, and MCAS related questions. 8th grade Intervention students learned strategies for converting terminating and repeating decimals to fractions and both groups practiced using strategies for answering Constructed-Response Questions with multiple parts. I am very proud of students effort and high quality work that we displayed on a bulletin board in a hallway next to our class.\n\nMs. Beaupre, Project Lead The Way: In October Engineering students learned how to use a ruler and measure accurately. They worked in groups to create a paper skimmer, a vehicle that glides across the floor. The more accurate the measurements the further the skimmer will go. Students competed to determine whose skimmer will travel the furthest distance.\n\nIn the next lesson students will be learning all about CAD, computer aided design.\n\nMrs. Avgoustakis, Physical Education: Students wrapped up the physical dimension of wellness with nutrient projects. We will be heading into the intellectual dimension of wellness next!\n\nThanks to all our volunteers and participants for the Color Run.
