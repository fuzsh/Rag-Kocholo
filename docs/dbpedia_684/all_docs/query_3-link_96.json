        "text": "The Annapolis mall was sold to a new owner. The shopping hub is working to fill vacancies with new amenities like gyms and a grocery store.\n\nANNAPOLIS, MD — A report said the Westfield Annapolis mall has new owners.\n\nUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield sold the property to Dallas-based real estate firm Centennial, The Baltimore Banner first reported Monday.\n\nThe total acquisition cost was $160 million, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield said in an earnings report. The sale closed on July 7 with a nonrefundable deposit of $10 million, the URW report said.\n\nWestfield Annapolis has reimagined itself in the past few years as anchor department stores shuttered.\n\nThe New Village Academy was prepared to open a free charter school in the mall, but the looming mall sale stalled lease negotiations. The school planned to have temporary classrooms in the former Nordstrom this fall until construction finished next year on its permanent home in the old Lord & Taylor.\n\nDevelopers also already had plans to convert the current JCPenney into a Grocery Outlet, Hobby Lobby and Onelife Fitness.\n\nPatch contacted URW and Centennial to confirm the reports and ask how the sale affects these projects. Both declined to comment.\n\nThese redevelopments would continue the mall's trend of adapting.\n\nBall at the Mall opened pickleball courts in the former Nordstrom parking lot last summer. A library branch and an SPCA adoption center are other unique mall tenants.\n\nBased in Paris, URW has looked to reduce its U.S. portfolio since April 2022 to trim its debt. The future of Westfield Annapolis has been uncertain ever since.\n\nURW said it has secured €300 million of transactions this year. This will offload €500 million in debt when paired with deals currently being finalized.\n\n\"In addition, the Group remains actively engaged in discussions with potential buyers for €1.0 Bn in assets,\" URW said in its report. \"The Group remains committed to further deleveraging through disposals in Europe, in line with its long-standing capital recycling policy, and the radical reduction of financial exposure in the US.\"\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
