It is easier for the bilingual office to facilitate access to data for SEA or district staff, more difficult for graduate students. In general, the state should do more to encourage research, especially research on learning styles. At present, activities are undertaken only when there is sustained individual initiative.\n\nState G: Lack of money and staff are the chief obstacles to research. The SEA would like to conduct research on what is working (programmatically) in bilingual education.\n\nState H: A major obstacle to research is that the whole field of bilingual education is politically charged. There are some political officials seeking research simply to prove that bilingual education is or is not effective. It is difficult to find research that is not conducted by a ''hired gun\" with a particular viewpoint. In this politically charged atmosphere, it is difficult to examine programs honestly and critically.\n\nSummary: Lack of resources is clearly a strong theme among the responses, but other important obstacles to research were noted by respondents. Several states mentioned lack of staff; this generally means numbers of staff, but it also means persons with the technical and research skills necessary for the task. Some SEAs have offices of research (or the assessment office serves that purpose), but issues of English-language learners and bilingual education need to be state priorities for these offices to focus their resources on those issues.\n\nData quality is also a concern in some states. SEAs are often dependent on districts to supply both student-level and aggregated data. There are sometimes problems in the quality of those databoth evaluation data from projects and data from regular state-wide data collections. Resources are critically important to allow follow-up with districts when data quality is an issue.\n\nFinally, SEAs are administrative entities, but they are administered by or experience oversight from elected officials or their appointees. The responses to the question about the locus of decision making for research makes clear that these political influences are important in deciding what research gets done. As a result, research questions may be narrowly framed or may reflect a hidden (or not so hidden) political agenda.\n\nPage 431\n\nrequirements promise a greater emphasis on research on English-language learners.\n\nSummary: The major development that seems to be setting the direction for research on English-language learners is the movement toward greater accountability for educational outcomes. Respondents in several states noted that these students are now being included in state assessment programs (sometimes with tests in native languages) and that statewide standards for their performance are being established. This development promises to increase attention to tests and other measures for assessing the performance of English-language learners, as well as to research that examines the best approaches and programs to improve performance.\n\nQuestion 6: What is your perception of obstacles at the state level in the sponsorship and conduct of research on these students?\n\nState A: The biggest obstacle to research is money. State officials (SEA, legislature, state board) are all supportive of research by the SEA, but there is simply not the money to do it. In general, the governor is inclined to give new resources to districts directly. In part, this is due to conflicts between the board and the governor, but it is also a function of resource scarcity.\n\nState B: The obstacles are both money and sufficient state staff to conduct research.\n\nState C: Money is quite limited at present because industries in the state are in a slump and because federal dollars are likely to decrease. Under those circumstances, it is difficult to justify additional dollars for research. In addition, shifting state leadership makes it difficult to sustain longer-term research efforts.\n\nState D: There is considerable fear among educators who deal with English-language learners about state performance assessment. They do not want to be told that the students they work with are not performing well. This fear of assessment translates into a fear of conducting research.\n\nState E: Lack of resources is the main obstacle to research. It would also help state efforts if there were a clear federal message to conduct research. The development of a centralized research function at the federal level would send an important message. Also, there should be more opportunities for states, especially large states with sizeable English-language learner populations, to conduct joint research. Such collaborations have proven beneficial in the past.\n\nPage 430\n\nState D: The current effort to establish benchmarks and state standards for performance tests in Spanish is an important, positive development. Once the tests are fully implemented, it is likely that initial scores will be lower for English-language learners than for English-language students. It is hoped that analysis of these data will then be conducted and will lead to efforts to improve instruction. Better assessments should also be able to show instructional effects. Further, the performance assessment system is designed to identify whether students taking the test in English were formerly LEP (the previous year only), which should enable additional analysis of instructional effects. Districts can opt out of the assessment program for a year or so, but eventually they must participate.\n\nState E: Awareness of the need for research on English-language learners is high. There is a clear perception that new SEA policies will affect these students. The RFP to overhaul the state assessment program specifically mentions the needs of these students (testing accommodations, waivers, disaggregation of data for this population, alternative assessments). New curriculum framework development plans also refer to English-language learners' needs. In addition, there has been a legislative change; English-language learners are now encouraged to participate in compensatory education, so they will be included in research on compensatory programs.\n\nState F: The emphasis in the SEA is on collecting data that show how students are performing. The respondent believes that there is now a need to identify and study effective classroom strategies. In supporting professional education, the state encourages students in advanced-degree programs to conduct classroom research. It also encourages similar research through innovation grants to schools, some of which are being used to study programs for English-language learners (although much of the funding is used for increased services or inservice education).\n\nState G: The respondent did not identify new research efforts on the horizon.\n\nState H: There is a strong movement in the state toward greater accountability and research that supports it. One positive development is the push for state-level standards for programs serving English-language learners. Creation of such standards will require assessment to develop and then track students into various programs and approaches. Districts will have to present plans for how they will achieve the standards and then conduct research to show the results. All of these\n\nPage 429\n\nrequirements of state aid formulas are instrumental in data collections in some states (counts are needed to distribute funds). Title VII information requirements and state traditions with respect to what kinds of information and evaluation accompany grant awards also appear important in establishing the planning and evaluation requirements for district-level programs that accept state aid. A few states noted that relatively new state standards for English-language learner performance are also having an effect on research priorities. The responses are notable for what they did not say as well as what they did. None of the respondents saw themselves as having a major role in decision making on research.\n\nQuestion 5: What is your perception of promising state efforts in the sponsorship and conduct of research on these students?\n\nState A: SEA staff have proposed a variety of research activities. For example, they have proposed a research project that would identify the achievement levels of all English-language learners, then identify the curriculum in which they are enrolled. The study would look at modalities and administration that make a difference. Studies that show the reasons for achievement (or its lack) would help justify the resources for bilingual education. The financial climate for such research is viewed as poor, however (see the entry for this state under question 6 below).\n\nState B: Officials in this state have recently developed a research agenda on English-language learners. They have posed a series of research questions. They have not yet identified sources of financial support, however. The questions suggested by the respondent during the interview included the following: How long do students (with different characteristics) need bilingual or ESL instruction? Is it possible to construct student profiles for different levels or kinds of service? Are instruments that test performance measuring what we want them to measure? Are test translations fair? Are tests appropriate for recent immigrants with little prior schooling? What programs are most appropriate for recent immigrants? How do we diagnose students' real needsnot just their LEP status? What are the relative advantages of phonics as opposed to other approaches?\n\nThis is a period of massive change in the SEA. The current push is for greater accountability, and there is a strong need to answer the question, \"What have we accomplished?\" Research that supports accountability (e.g., examining LEP performance as part of school report cards) would fit with the change in direction.\n\nState C: The current superintendent and senior SEA staff are interested in carrying research to the student level (not just aggregated to schools or districts). Also, the SEA has been reorganized to merge data collection and assessment with teacher training in the same division. This is seen as beneficial to research.\n\nPage 428\n\nschool report cards in which the performance of English-language learners would be identified.\n\nState C: SEA activity on standards and curriculum frameworks is driving the research currently being done. In that activity, standards for English-language learners/language-minority students are being identified. Also affecting current research is an initiative by the governor's office to reexamine the distribution of state aid. A task force is examining the foundation funding formula and has identified districts with funding gaps (e.g., large English-language learner population, but little tax base). The task force is exploring new ways to allocate state funds.\n\nState D: Most data collections result from legislative mandate. For example, the new education code calls for research on teacher training and learning. Availability of resources also plays a role.\n\nState E: Specific research is undertaken based on needs indicated by districts. For example, a symposium on assessment of English-language learners was offered because of district interest. District directors get together once a year to discuss priorities. Overall data collections are usually driven by legislative requirements.\n\nState F: State funding requirements play an important role in defining what research is undertaken. In addition, the state superintendent is \"graded\" on student performance, which also affects what research is conducted. For example, one current performance standard is that 25 percent of English-language learners will exit each year. As a result, the SEA is currently studying the efficacy of the 25 percent figure and cutoff scores for achievement tests.\n\nState G: The annual census of public school districts is the result of legislative mandate. In addition, Title VII grant rules require information on English-language learners.\n\nState H: There are three ways that research is likely to be undertaken: (1) a specific legislative mandate (e.g., the legislature wants to examine the efficacy of year-round schools); (2) a state board of education mandate (e.g., one board member wants the SEA to compare the results of English-only as opposed to transitional bilingual education); (3) staff initiative (e.g., staff bring together a consortium of university scholars to address an issue).\n\nSummary: Some respondents had a difficult time identifying the primary influences on decision making about research. In general, board of education and legislative mandates appear to play an important role. In addition, the data\n\nPage 427\n\napplied linguistics were heavily involved in the development of this program. The state also funded the development of a K-12 language arts program involving pilot testing and formative evaluation in a major school district in the state.\n\nState F: As noted under question 3 above, this state supports faculty at a university-based language center that conducts a variety of research activities. In addition, it makes specific grants to the university system to support research by Ph.D and M.A. candidates, as well as faculty, on issues affecting language-minority students.\n\nState G: The state pays tuition for teachers who are seeking certification in bilingual education. It is possible that some of these persons are doing research as part of their education.\n\nState H: The SEA supports teacher training, but not scholar training per se.\n\nSummary: With a few exceptions, SEAs do not directly support information services or scholar training on English-language learners. It should be noted, however, that basic state support of university and college systems also supports the research activities of graduate students and faculty. As already noted, there are, in addition, university-based centers in several of these states that specialize in research on language-minority students and English-language learners.\n\nQuestion 4: How does your agency decide what kinds of research to support, as well as which particular projects to fund?\n\nState A: In general, the State Board of Education decides what research to undertake, but occasionally legislative requirements drive research (e.g., a decision to revise teacher exams was made after complaints to legislators by persons taking the test).\n\nState B: The decision to require district-level planning and evaluation for state-funded bilingual programs follows the pattern established for most state-funded programs. Furthermore, the SEA has supported the decision strongly because data from these evaluations are used to decide which programs to continue to fund. The data are also used to identify low-performing schools, which then must develop plans to improve performance (schools that continue to perform poorly face takeover). In the past, English-language learner performance was not a factor in the identification of low-performing schools, but that is now changing, and LEP performance will be a separate criterion in state review.\n\nAnother current consideration in research decision making is that senior state officials and the board of education want to streamline reporting. They want fewer reports and simple reports that are user-friendly. The state may adopt\n\nPage 426\n\nThe SEA sometimes provides guidance on specific studies. For example, under the auspices of this program, researchers from several campuses are currently examining the question of what is the most appropriate staff development for teachers who work with English-language learners.\n\nSummary: Development of teacher training programs appears to be the main research and development activity supported by SEAs in centers, laboratories, or other entities. Interestingly, curriculum development was not often mentioned as an activity of centers. In addition, it should be noted that there are other sources of state support for research on language-minority students and English-language learnersprimarily state agencies that support faculty and researchers at universities. SEAs also make contributions to the federal regional educational laboratories, although they may not always be aware of specific research on English-language learners being conducted by these laboratories.\n\nQuestion 3: Does the SEA support information services or training grants for scholars who work on the education of LEP and bilingual students? Please elaborate.\n\nState A: The SEA supports a project that is designing and revising the teacher examination for bilingual education teacher certification. An evaluation of the previous examination was conducted, and it concluded that a change was needed. The new exam is being developed by a committee of researchers and teachers and is currently undergoing prepiloting at one university. The project cost is $85,000.\n\nState B: The SEA is not now supporting such efforts, but there is a large need in the state.\n\nState C: The state staff development network receives funds from the SEA for training grants. The funds support research and teacher training in districts. Many of the districts that receive these funds use them in projects for native-language students. As noted previously, a state-supported university-based center conducts a variety of research functions, including training of researchers.\n\nState D: The SEA does not support such activities directly, but regional service centers in the state provide staff development.\n\nState E: The SEA supports a variety of teacher training and curriculum development projects that are related to language-minority students and involve research. It has recently developed a 300-hour inservice program on ESL and is conducting training of trainers for the program. The program has an evaluation component and supervised implementation. University researchers at a center for\n\nPage 425\n\nAlthough the program is categorical, all funds for bilingual education are distributed by formula to districts, so there are no discretionary funds for use by other entities.\n\nState B: There are technical assistance centers in the state that help the SEA obtain state-requested data from districts as one function, but they do not do research.\n\nThe state does work with universities to develop teacher training programs. The SEA is beginning a dialogue with several universities about research needed to design new programs for bilingual and ESL teacher certification. There is a considerable demand for additional qualified teachers. The state currently issues provisional certificates, and teachers have several years to obtain certification. In conjunction with universities, the state has spent $1 million to develop the courses necessary to enable provisional teachers to qualify and pass the test certification exam. The state has conducted a needs assessment to determine how many teachers are needed (based on the numbers of provisional certificates it has issued).\n\nState C: This state supports a language center at a branch of the state university system. The center conducts a wide variety of research on native languages and their survival (this center dates back to the Lau Centers). The results of this research are important in state policy supporting the teaching of native languages. The center publishes monographs and booklets with SEA funding.\n\nState D: There are a number of regional service centers in the state, some focusing on bilingual education. There are also university-based teacher training centers. It was not known how much research takes place at either type of facility.\n\nState E: There are no entities supported on an ongoing basis to conduct research in these areas, but sometimes there is support on an ad hoc basis for a specific research activity requested by the SEA.\n\nState F: The state helps support a federal regional educational laboratory that also receives Title VII funds.\n\nState G: There are no such entities supported by the SEA to conduct research in these areas. The SEA does keep in touch with university-based researchers who conduct research on English-language learners.\n\nState H: The state supports a language-minority program at a campus of the state university system; the program brings together scholars from several campuses.\n\nPage 423\n\nthe state from the regular testing program, it is possible to estimate, by school, the percentage of English-language learners (by ethnicity) achieving at grade level.\n\nState G: The state conducts an annual census of public school districts (and cooperating private schools) that collects school-level data on a wide variety of variables. The data are analyzed in the bilingual office, and results are published in a yearly report. They include (by school) the number of English-language learners (based on a state legal definition), the number of students reassessed, the number of languages spoken, the types of programs in which students are participating, the number of qualified bilingual teachers, and what tests are used.\n\nThe SEA used to collect dropout data by ethnic group, but the respondent was unsure whether these data are still being collected.\n\nFor the past 5 years, the state has operated a performance-based testing program. Tests were developed by the SEA in Spanish, but they are no longer in use. At present, testing is taking place in grades 4, 8, and 12 in reading, writing, and math, but the program is being reexamined. However, districts also conduct standardized testing in grades 4, 7, and 11 using nationally known standardized achievement tests, and it is possible to identify English-language learners by program from the test results (which are submitted to the state). Last year, the SEA analyzed district-level state-wide testing data and found that English-language learners in bilingual programs did better than those in ESL (i.e., overall, their gap with English-proficient students was smaller, and in some districts they performed better on average).\n\nState H: This state has conducted several research studies in the recent past. It published a volume that provided a theoretical framework on schooling and language-minority children to which key researchers in the field contributed. A Title VII grant was used to identify five schools in which to implement a theoretically sound program with extensive evaluation. Results of the pilot program were published, and a major city in the state revised its program based on the research.\n\nThe state is currently supporting a research program examining staff development for teachers who work with English-language learners (see the entry for this state under question 2 below).\n\nIn addition, the statewide assessment program (which is currently being revised) requires standardized achievement tests in grades 2 through 10. Spanish versions of tests are currently being requested of publishers who seek to have their tests approved for the statewide program. Providing such tests will enhance the publishers' chances of test adoption, but they are not required of all publishers, so some will probably not submit them. The state can analyze achievement data to determine, for example, whether English-language learners who are fluent in English do better.\n\nThe state maintains a demographic database by school. This database includes\n\nPage 422\n\nThere is a state testing program in Spanish for grades 3-6 for English-language learners in math, reading, and writing. The program is currently undergoing new test development and beginning to implement new criterion-referenced tests. At present, some of the tests are being \"benchmarked,\" and standards are being developed. Others are being field tested. Districts that receive state program funding for bilingual education are required to do pre- and post-testing of students using these tests.\n\nUnder contract, the SEA is also developing a new language proficiency test for bilingual teacher certification. The development process involves identifying skills needed by teachers and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the current test.\n\nThe SEA research and evaluation division has conducted various evaluation studies, including a study of pre-K programs for English-language learners.\n\nState E: This state has undertaken two specific research studies in the recent past with a focus on bilingual education. First, it issued a contract to a university in the state to develop an English as a second language (ESL) curriculum manual. To develop the manual, the university researchers undertook a \"best practices\" study, as well as a survey of districts and professional organizations. The aim was to develop ways of identifying levels of English proficiency of English-language learners. The results will be published soon. Second, the assessment and bilingual offices of the SEA cooperated to conduct two symposia, bringing together experts on assessment, surveys, and legal issues on English-language learners and bilingual education programs.\n\nThis state also compiles an annual report on the status of English-language learners and their programs. The report provides district-level data on the participation and performance of English-language learners by type of program, assessment status, former English-language learners (i.e., those who have exited the program within the past 2 years), and non-English-language learners. Background data shown include native language, country of origin, and race/ethnicity. This report is based on individual student records submitted by districts (under an automated state student information database), but only aggregated district-level data are currently published.\n\nState F: The SEA conducts needs assessments, evaluations, and on-site monitoring of Title VII projects and sends reports to OBEMLA. In addition, the state-funded LEP program requires districts to develop evaluation plans and collect achievement data on the English-language proficiency of participants. Several years ago, the state conducted a specific research activity to examine the relative benefits of pull-out and self-contained classrooms.\n\nThe state assessment program's regular achievement testing applies to English-language-proficient students only. Some districts also give native-language proficiency tests for diagnostic purposes. Through school-level data submitted to\n\nPage 421\n\nprogram (for many years these students were exempted from statewide testing, but under the new policy, districts must use tests in native languages, if available).\n\nAlthough not currently a research activity, SEA staff anticipate that it will soon be necessary to develop new teacher certification examinations (this will probably be a Request for Proposals process).\n\nState C: The main state research activity is district-level data collections to develop a state report card. The state prescribes the data elements and definitions (including an LEP definition), and districts provide reports to the SEA. The SEA produces a state summary. Among the data districts are required to submit are data about English-language learners: performance on state assessment (see below) and ethnic/linguistic background. The state maintains a student-level data records system. At present, the data on English-language learners are not aggregated at the state level in a report. They are used, however, to allocate state aid funds to districts.\n\nThe state assessment system requires tests at grades 4, 8, and 11. Many districts test students at all grades, however. The data collected by the state allow for the identification of English-language learners by school. It is also possible to isolate the performance of students in bilingual and bicultural programs.\n\nIn addition, the state received Title VII funds to work with districts. State officials monitor projects and do site evaluations. There is an Academic Excellence site in the state that has conducted research on English-language learner performance.\n\nState D: This state conducts an annual (fall) district-level survey, yielding data by school and by individual student for its state management information system. These fall surveys provide data on enrollment, race, ethnicity, and language. It is possible to identify LEP, LEP/bilingual, LEP/special education, and LEP/parental denial status. An individual student-level record system is maintained by the state. (There is a weight in the state aid formula for English-language learners, and this data collection is used to assist in the distribution of formula aid.)\n\nFrom this data collection, the SEA publishes ''snapshots\" of district-level data. Aggregated program data on English-language learners are currently published by grade and region of the state, but it would be possible to disaggregate these data further.\n\nThe state's performance assessment system collects school-level data. Information on attendance and dropout rates, as well as achievement data, are analyzed by the state. There is also an annual criterion-referenced third grade testing program in reading and math, as well as other grades in some years. The state receives school-level data and can separately examine the performance of schools with concentrations of language-minority students.\n\nPage 420\n\nState Department Of Education (Sea)\n\nResponses To Questionnaire\n\nQuestion 1: Does the SEA fund research on LEP and bilingual students, including basic research, applied research, demonstrations, evaluations, or survey research? Please elaborate on research funded in the past five years and amounts of funding, if available, as well as identifying the administrative units within the SEA that fund this research.\n\nState A: The SEA does not conduct research per se, although it does collect information on student performance on statewide achievement tests. Achievement testing is conducted in grades 3, 5, and 8, and students are also required to pass a tenth grade competency examination in order to graduate. It is possible to identify ethnicity (broadly definede.g., Hispanic, Native American), as well as gender in these state performance data. At present, these data are not reported separately by ethnicity in a state report.\n\nState B: The main state-supported research efforts are (1) evaluations of state-funded programs, (2) a census that includes counts and descriptions of English-language learners, and (3) analysis of data from the state performance testing program. With respect to evaluation, any project with state funds must conduct an evaluation. Any district that accepts state (formula) aid for bilingual education must use state-prescribed tests (the state mandates a pre/post-testing program), as well as develop program plans and evaluate its programs (not all districts accept aid, but most with significant numbers of English-language learners do). Using these data, state officials do analysis and issue an annual report to the State Board. They also provide technical assistance to districts. There is some concern about the quality of the testing data from some districts, however. There is also a state categorical funding program for bilingual education. This program has a competitive awards process, and the evaluation requirements are similar to those of the formula aid program.\n\nIn addition, the state conducts a census of language-minority children, which is used to distribute state formula aid for English-language learners. From this exercise, it is possible to identify such students, as well as the type of educational programs in which they are enrolled. The state maintains individual student records data, as well as extensive information on the districts and their programs.\n\nThe state's performance testing program data make it possible to identify English-language learners, as well as the programs in which they are enrolled. Performance testing is conducted at grades 3 and 6. There are also competency tests administered at intermediate and high school levels that can yield similar data. A new policy approved by the state board of education requires that the state measure English-language learner growth separately in the state assessment\n\nPage 410\n\nMoss, M., and M.

This is a separate issue from the quality of the research corps as a whole; we raise it because of the role-model potential of minority scholars and, more important, the experience, insights, and networks they can bring to the enterprise. Although there are a large number of minority scholars and/or scholars from language-minority backgrounds currently doing work on LEP issues, senior people in the field need to nurture such participation among the younger potential scholars (see Padilla, 1994). Note that of the 13 Spencer awards for dissertations, postdoctoral fellowships, and small grants for work on LEP and related issues since 1992, 6 were awarded to minority scholars, a larger proportion than is usually the case.\n\nSome notion of the potential pool of minority scholars can be gleaned from the annual reports on minority group members in higher education published by the American Council on Education. Figures for doctorates received in education are imperfect indicators of the pool because, as noted above, researchers on LEP and related issues are often trained in anthropology, psychology, linguistics, or other departments. Conversely, very large numbers of education doctorates are awarded to candidates headed for practice, such as school administrators, and among those trained for research careers, only a small minority will work on LEP issues. However, the broad parameters of minorities receiving the doctorate in education are as follows: of the 5842 U.S. citizens receiving a doctorate in education in 1994, 36 (.62 percent) were Native American, 80 (1.37 percent) were Asian American, and 225 (3 percent) were Hispanic American (Carter and Wilson, 1996). It is among these small groups and the equally small numbers of minorities in related disciplines that we must look for future minority scholars on LEP issues.\n\nReferences\n\nAtkinson, R.C., and G.B.

Between fiscal years 1979 and 1987, a total of 1,721 fellows participated in the fellowship program; another 316 participated between 1990 and 1991. Of the fellows participating between 1979 and 1987, 1,432 were pursuing a doctoral degree, 104 were postmaster's students, and 185 were enrolled at the master's degree level. Although the purpose of the fellowship program is to develop faculty for teacher training programs in bilingual education, not all recipients have followed this course. Even so, all Title VII recipients have necessarily been involved in the conduct and uses of research on LEP issues, and in some cases the attainment of a doctorate and the acquisition of a teaching position (27 percent of those studied) or university administrative position (8 percent of those studied) and receipt of tenure at a university. Thus many of the active researchers in this area have been recipients of Title VII fellowships. On the other hand, Title VII fellowships tend to be restricted to students in schools of education. Some notable researchers who work on LEP issues received their degrees in disciplinary fields outside of schools of education, such as psychology, anthropology, and linguistics. However, these researchers typically do not have access to Title VII fellowships. The 1996 appropriation provided no funds for Title VII fellowships, but the Department of Education reprogrammed $1.1 million to cover continuation grants to 100 fellows.\n\nAs we emphasize in Chapter 10, we believe federal research agencies need to give more attention to the problem of the future of the research corps for LEP issues. The concern has special urgency for research relating to LEP issues because the area is politically charged, and this may deter talented researchers from choosing it as a focus of their studies. Numerous models for the needed support exist. The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, for example, divides its considerable Field Initiated Studies funds among doctoral dissertation support, postdoctoral fellowships, and senior research grants. Various National Institutes of Health institutes support training programs. We urge more opportunities of this sort in our recommendations in Chapter 10.\n\nAmong those highly qualified and rigorously trained researchers needed to\n\nPage 405\n\nthe National Paideia Center is based on the explicit assumption that the program \"works with all students\" and that there is no need to differentiate for specific groups. The Core Knowledge Foundation is similar in that it, too, promotes a common, core curriculum for all students, although it encourages schools to devote half of their curriculum to topics and skills deemed relevant and meaningful locally. In both cases, there is a rejection of the differentiation of educational treatment by language or cultural group membership. Project Zero has done no work with English-language learners.\n\nMore typically, however, reform efforts reviewed here attempt to deal with LEP issues through a subtle and complex interplay between the framework of the overall program and the particulars and exigencies of local contexts. Thus, Accelerated Schools, the Center for Educational Renewal, the Coalition of Essential Schools, Effective Schools, New American Schools Corporation, and the School Development Program have for the most part well-articulated core philosophies and principles. But they believe in the need to adapt curriculum, instruction, and other aspects of student experiences and school operations to the linguistic and cultural characteristics of the student population. How schools do this is left largely up to them, but the assumption is that local sites will attempt to synthesize the core principles of the network or project they have joined with the instructional and curricular features required by their student populations.\n\nFor the most part, these projects have not examined their effects on English-language learner outcomes; in many cases, they have not examined effects on student outcomes at all. Although conceptually the idea of \"general principles locally adapted to English-language learner populations\" makes great intuitive sense, generally these projects have yet to demonstrate the viability of this idea empirically. To this end, we would encourage projects to disaggregate outcome data by LEP status in order to compare the performance of English-language learners with that of other students. Moreover, we would encourage them to field test and evaluate adaptations of their programs for these students.\n\nRecruitment and Training of Researchers\n\nAs noted in the discussion of recommendations 10-9 and 10-10 in Chapter 10, there is considerable concern among senior researchers and agency officials that insufficient talent exists at present, or in training, to accomplish the research that is needed on language-minority and LEP issues. Recognizing the problem of insufficient research talent across the whole field of education research, the Spencer Foundation has supported doctoral training, dissertation fellowships, postdoctoral fellowships, and small grants on a large scale (see Patrick, 1991, on the Spencer postdoctoral fellowship program). Those efforts have been crucial to attracting talented young people to work in education research, and some of them have worked on bilingual education and language-minority issues. Since 1992, five dissertation fellowships, one postdoctoral fellowship, and seven small\n\nPage 404\n\nin projects while continuing to emphasize applications to practice. Furthermore, we urge the foundations to support synthesis or networking activities that might foster the improvement of research and policy on such issues.\n\nNational Reform Networks\n\nSince the mid-1980s, thousands of efforts have been launched to reform or restructure U.S. schools. Perhaps a dozen of these efforts have expanded to form networks that have gained national prominence and are frequently reported or cited in research, professional, or popular outlets. For the most part, these networks are not research oriented, but many have begun conducting evaluations of their projects. Moreover, most of these projects do not specifically target English-language learners. But since English-language learners have become an increasingly prominent component of the school population, many of these projects have, at a minimum, implicitly had to address the needs and issues of these students in local contexts.\n\nThere is enormous variability in the manner and the degree to which these projects have responded to the presence of language-minority students in U.S. schools. At one extreme is Success for All, a project based at The Johns Hopkins University and headed by Robert Slavin. Success for All did not begin as a program for English-language learners; it began in inner-city Baltimore with largely African American schools. However, it has been implemented in a small number of schools with substantial language-minority populations. The program has maintained its essential characteristics, but it has also been explicitly adapted for English-language learners. There are in fact two adaptationsan ESL adaptation for students who receive all instruction in English, regardless of their primary language, and a Spanish bilingual adaptation for students in a Spanish primary-language program. Success for All's unusually systematic evaluations indicate that both adaptations are highly effective in promoting higher levels of reading achievement among English-language learners in project schools.\n\nA roughly analogous effort by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is under way. The board has been working to develop standards and assessments for certifying highly qualified teachers; eventually, teacher certification will be available in more than 30 areas. One of those areas is ''English as a new language,\" and certification will be available to any teacher who wishes to be board certified for teaching in ESL or bilingual contexts. Employing the general framework used to develop certifications in other areas of teaching, the board will offer certification for teachers of English-language learners by September 1998. In addition, although minimal, standards for dealing with these students are included in the standards for all other areas of certification.\n\nIn contrast to Success for All and the efforts of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, some programs make no adaptations for or simply have not included English-language learners in their activities. For example,\n\nPage 403\n\nproject, and to Morgan Hill Unified School District for a diversity training program.\n\nSpencer Foundation\n\nThe Spencer Foundation devotes virtually its entire grants budget to education research. Thus, although its total grants budget is smaller than that of many other foundations, Spencer is the largest supporter of education research among all the foundations, and its work is of great importance to the future of the education research enterprise. Among its projects relating to LEP issues in its 1994-1995 annual report were a grant to Marcia Farr to study literacy practices among Mexican immigrant families; a grant to Robert Fullwinder to study multicultural education as moral education; a grant to Sara Harkness and Charles Super to study parental ethnotheories, cultural practices, and the transition to school; a grant to Lucinda Pease-Alvarez and Kenji Hakuta to study language maintenance and shift in early adolescence; a grant to Alejandro Portes to study the adaptation process of second-generation immigrants; and a grant to Sandra Schecter and Robert Bayley to study family language environment and bilingual development. Through its Small Grants Program, a grant was made to Irene-Anna Diakidoy and Stella Vosniadov to study Lakota/Dakota children's knowledge acquisition in astronomy. Spencer postdoctoral fellowship awards last year included one to Judith Moschkovich to study the construction of mathematical meaning in bilingual conversations, and Spencer dissertation fellowships went to Cynthia Brock to explore a second-language learner's opportunities for literacy learning in a mainstream classroom and to Jane Herman to study cross-linguistic transfer among bilingual kindergartners learning to read.\n\nOther Foundations\n\nThis survey was informal. We did not find projects that were obviously about LEP education issues in the most recent available annual report of the Lilly Endowment, the Exxon Education Foundation, or the James S. McDonnell Foundation, although each of those foundations may have supported many research projects or action programs on other education issues, as they have in the past.\n\nSummary\n\nThere is a substantial amount of support flowing from the philanthropic foundations to projects aimed at language-minority, LEP, or bilingual education issues. Not very much of this support is for research, as is true of the foundations' general stance toward a world full of problems needing solutions. In our recommendations in Chapter 10, we suggest that the foundations, like the government, should be mindful of opportunities to include language variables and issues\n\nPage 402\n\nAsian Pacifics, Inc., was for policy research on Asian Pacific immigrants. Program grants included five sizable awards (to California State University at Long Beach, California Tomorrow, the Center for Applied Linguistics, the Intercultural Development Research Association, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County), all for programs on immigrant education. A large program grant to Teachers College of Columbia University supported work with suburban school districts in demographic transition. Two grants to Brown University supported school superintendents in their work with English-language learners.\n\nDavid and Lucile Packard Foundation\n\nThe Packard Foundation did not fund any research per se on language issues, but did support a number of education programs relating to language. They gave modest-sized grants to Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Santa Cruz County for bilingual after-school tutoring; to the Self-Reliance Foundation of Santa Fe, New Mexico, to develop Spanish-language radio programs about family planning and women's reproductive rights; to the Sequoia Union School District of Redwood City, California, for immigrant education programs; and to others. They also awarded a large grant to Stanford University to improve translation services in health care settings for non-English-speaking Americans.\n\nCarnegie Corporation of New York\n\nCarnegie Corporation of New York supported this report. Two of the foundation's grants programsEducation and Healthy Development of Children and Youth, and Special Projectsprovided significant support for research programs, model development, policy linkage, and community-organizing projects that benefit language-minority children, youth, and families. For example, the corporation provided support for research on effective parenting education and school reform models targeting Latino families, for legal advocacy to secure language-minority citizens' rights to equitable educational opportunity, for policy linkage activities that provide research-based analyses of language issues to federal and state lawmakers, and for voter education and outreach to strengthen the participation of Latino and Asian Americans in the democratic process.\n\nWilliam and Flora Hewlett Foundation\n\nThe Hewlett Foundation provided four grants related directly or indirectly to language issues in education, though not for research. Among these were support to the Ravenswood City School District to purchase native-language library materials, to Arizona State University to sponsor a conference on minority opportunities programs, to California Tomorrow for its Education for a Diverse Society\n\nPage 401\n\nstudy of the Hispanic community, and a very large grant to Youth Guidance of Chicago to assess the Comer project schools in that city. Other grants related to these issues went to the U.S. Committee for Refugees in Washington, D.C., to protect the rights of refugees in the United States by monitoring, among other things, public education; to a Chicago group for developing leadership among high school parents in a largely Hispanic area; to a Los Angeles group for developing leadership among Latino men and women; and to a school board in Florida for developing a conflict resolution program in English, Spanish, and Creole. As a result of current planning, however, the foundation has shifted its focus to professional development and is unlikely to fund future research in this area.\n\nFord Foundation\n\nThe annual report of the Ford Foundation gives no information about projects themselves, only the amount of funding and the names of the organizations receiving it. Among the grantees most clearly associated with LEP language issues were the Multicultural Education and Training Advocacy Project, the National Community College Hispanic Council, the National Coalition of Advocates for Students, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Although the information is imprecise, the grant amounts are sizable. Some research-related activities might be generated by these grants, even though they seem to be addressed to groups that provide services and advocacy rather than research, as is typical of foundation funding on education issues.\n\nPew Charitable Trusts\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts funded a number of action projects that addressed language-minority or LEP issues in education. Some of these directly addressed education, such as the grant to Accion Comunal Latino Americana of Norristown, Pennsylvania, to provide supplementary education to low-income Latino children, and the grant to the New England Board of Higher Education to increase the number of Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans in the teaching professions. Other Pew grants seemed likely to be concerned more incidentally with language, such as the grant to California Tomorrow of San Francisco for the dissemination of the Education for a Diverse Society Project.\n\nAndrew W. Mellon Foundation\n\nThe Mellon Foundation gave a number of grants for research on language issues. Several grants were given to Michigan State University, The Johns Hopkins University, and San Diego State University for research on the adaptation of the children of recent immigrants; another, to Leadership Education for\n\nPage 400\n\nTABLE A-1 Foundations Supporting Education Research\n\nNOTE: The Clark Foundation was ninth in support of education research in 1989, and The Rockefeller Foundation was tenth. We did not receive their annual reports and so did not include them in this survey.\n\nissues or implicitly or indirectly so. Some projects required guessing since some annual reports are more specific than others. Our aim was simply to determine what sorts of projects the foundations supported in our area of interest and how robust the roster of those projects is, not to assess the relative commitments of the foundations to these issues. The complete list of relevant projects, by foundation, is found in Appendix C; here we summarize and give examples for each foundation.14\n\nThe John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation\n\nThe MacArthur Foundation provided funds for this report, which is, of course, both explicitly about research and explicitly about LEP education issues. The foundation's 1994 annual report showed it to be active in language projects and engaged with language-minority groups. Those projects that might implicitly involve English-language learners and that include some research are a small grant to Hispanic Human Resources of West Palm Beach, Florida, for a socioeconomic\n\nPage 399\n\nimportant obstacles to research were noted. Several states mentioned lack of staff; this generally means numbers, but it also means people with the technical and research skills necessary for the task. Some SEAs have offices of research (or the assessment office serves that purpose), but issues of English-language learners and bilingual education need to be state priorities for these offices to focus their resources on those issues.\n\nData quality is also a concern in some states. SEAs are often dependent on districts to supply both student-level and aggregated data. There are sometimes problems in the quality of those data, both evaluation data from projects and data from regular state-wide data collections. Resources for following up with districts are critically important when data quality is an issue.\n\nFinally, SEAs are administrative entities, but they are administered by or experience oversight from elected officials or their appointees. The responses to the question about the locus of decision making for research make clear that these political influences are important in deciding what research gets done. As a result, research questions may be narrowly framed or may reflect a hidden (or not so hidden) political agenda.\n\nIn sum, SEAs do not conduct a great deal of research on English-language learners and their programs because SEAs do not conduct a great deal of research on any subject. But to varying degrees, they do assess the academic achievement of English-language learners, gather data on program and student characteristics, and evaluate programs. The data they muster could be useful to researchers funded from other sources, and some level of coordination would be desirable. The relationship between these data sources and federally funded research efforts might fruitfully be a topic of discussion for the federal Department of Education Advisory Committee on Research on English-language Learners recommended in Chapter 10.\n\nThe Work Of Foundations\n\nWe constructed a list of foundations that gave substantial support to education research in 1989, based on a review of funding sources for education research prepared by the National Academy of Education (Kirst and Ravitch, 1991) (see Table A-1).\n\nWe obtained copies of the 1994 annual reports of all of the foundations shown in Table A-1. We then compiled lists of the projects they funded that appeared to deal with language-minority, LEP, or bilingual education issues.13 We made these judgments on the basis of project descriptions, and categorized the projects as either research or nonresearch and as either explicitly about LEP\n\nPage 398\n\nQuestion 3: Does your SEA support information services or training grants for scholars who work on the education of LEP and bilingual students? Please elaborate.\n\nWith a few exceptions, SEAs do not directly support information services or scholarly training of researchers who study these issues. It should be noted, however, that basic support of state university and college systems also supports the research activities of graduate students and faculty. As already noted, there are, in addition, university-based centers in several of these states that specialize in research on language-minority students and English-language learners.\n\nQuestion 4: How does your agency decide what kinds of research to support, as well as which particular projects to fund?\n\nSome respondents had a difficult time identifying the primary influences on decision making about research. In general, board of education and legislative mandates appear to play an important role. In addition, data requirements of state aid formulas are instrumental in data collections in some states (counts are needed to distribute funds). Title VII requirements and state traditions about what kinds of information and evaluation activities must accompany a grant award also appear important in establishing the planning and evaluation requirements for district-level programs that accept state aid. A few states noted that relatively new state standards for English-language learner performance are also having an effect on research priorities. The responses are notable for what they did not say as well as what they did. None of the respondents saw themselves as having a major role in decision making on research.\n\nQuestion 5: What is your perception of promising state efforts in the sponsorship and conduct of research on these students?\n\nThe movement toward greater accountability for educational outcomes seems to be the major development setting the direction for research on English-language learners. Respondents in several states noted that these students are now being included in state assessment programs (sometimes with tests in native languages) and that state-wide standards for their performance are being established. This development promises to increase attention to tests and other measures for assessing the performance of these students, as well as to research that examines the best approaches and programs for improving performance.\n\nQuestion 6: What is your perception of obstacles at the state level in the sponsorship and conduct of research on these students?\n\nLack of resources is clearly a strong theme among the responses, but other\n\nPage 396\n\nthe research agenda and conducting the research on the education of English-language learners falls appropriately to the Department of Education, it cannot do the job alone. Funds for research in the Department of Education have always been modest compared with those of other departments, and its infrastructure for research is not as effective as that in other departments. These two features interact: the relative paucity of funds and the relative ineffectiveness of research infrastructure create a vicious circle of low respect, low support, and modest results.\n\nThe Work Of State Education Agencies12\n\nDuring January 1996, we conducted interviews with state education agency (SEA) officials who are responsible for bilingual education or other programs for language-minority students or English-language learners in eight states. As noted earlier, we chose the eight states that had an English-language learner population of 6 percent or more: Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, New Mexico, New York, and Texas. (A ninth state, Rhode Island, met the threshold, but we were unable to connect with an interview respondent there.) The interviewer asked an official in each state to identify current and recent SEA research, entities that support the research, information services, and training grants on language-minority students or English-language learners or on bilingual education. The interviewer also asked about promising practices and obstacles in the sponsorship and future directions of research on these topics. Most respondents were state coordinators or directors of bilingual education (see Appendix B). The state respondents were assured that their states would not be identified by name; therefore, the identities of the states are masked in Appendix B, where the individual responses are detailed.\n\nThe questions were sent to the interviewees in advance of the interview. Interviewees were advised that information was sought not only on SEA-supported research in which the primary focus was English-language learners or language-minority children or bilingual education, but also on research where these children were a subpopulation by virtue of the design of the data collection; findings for this subpopulation may or may not currently be reported separately. Research was defined broadly (basic, applied, demonstrations, evaluations, and surveys).\n\nFor each question, we provide here a summary of the responses across the eight states.\n\nQuestion 1: Does your SEA fund research on LEP and bilingual students, including basic research, applied research, demonstrations, evaluations, or survey research? Please elaborate on research funded in the past\n\nPage 395\n\nNational Institute for Mental Health With the help of a research administrator from the agency, we checked recent grants by the Behavioral, Cognitive, and Social Science Research Branch of the Division of Neuroscience and Behavioral Science, which funds only basic research. Of the approximately 280 projects funded in the past year, 11 had a primary focus on language (see Appendix C for a list of these projects). However, these studies focused on first-language acquisition and processing. The centers for behavioral science research funded through this branch do not address languages in a significant way (Mollie Oliveri, personal communication).\n\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development The results were similar at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. This institute supports four centers on learning disabilities, training grants, individual field-initiated research grants, and a clearinghouse. The official we interviewed could not identify any projects dealing with language diversity. We located some, however, through a computer search of federally funded research. These included a study of language and literacy in bilingual children (Oller, in progress) and a study that examines the development of phonetic categories in bilingual children (Flege, in progress) (see Appendix C).\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nThe main research agencies funded by the Department of Defense are the Army Research Institute, the Office of Naval Research, and the Air Force Human Resources Laboratory. The armed forces helped pioneer methods for teaching second languages to native speakers of English after World War II. They also do some work on learning problems of limited-English-proficient recruits to the services' training programs. In addition, they fund quite a bit of research, both basic and applied, on linguistics and literacy in English. They do not, it seems, conduct much research that is relevant to the educational needs of language-minority students and English-language learners in elementary and secondary schools (Ray Perez, personal communication).\n\nConclusion\n\nFederally funded research on language-minority issues and the education of English-language learners has, understandably, been centered in the Department of Education. It would be helpful in the future if language variables and language issues were considered more often in research conducted by other federal agencies, whether the primary focus is on reading, other cognitive processes, the delivery of social services, teaching techniques in math and science, or other topics of interest to the government. Furthermore, while the main task of designing\n\nPage 394\n\nFamilies of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine for a project examining the health and adjustment of immigrant children. The project is focusing on differential health and mental health outcomes of children from various immigrant groups, the varying trajectories that now characterize the development of immigrant children, and the delivery of services to these children and their families. It will synthesize the relevant research literature and support the secondary analysis of existing data sets.\n\nDemonstration and Evaluation Branch, Administration for\n\nChildren, Youth, and Families\n\nThis office formulates and contracts for evaluation work, principally on Head Start. There are two projects relevant to our interests: first, a descriptive study on demographic changes in the Head Start population and how these changes will affect multilingual and multicultural practices in curriculum and service delivery; and second, a study of the characteristics of families served by the 28 Migrant Head Start programs across the country. Other studies will touch on LEP issues by examining both language variables in data collection and program descriptions in case studies of best practice. There is a survey under way of all Head Start programs that will gather information about various populations and will include case studies of 30 programs, and there is an evaluation of the Comprehensive Child Development Program, which is aimed at low-income families.\n\nThe Administration for Children, Youth, and Families also just funded four university-based Head Start research centers (National Quality Research Centers). One of the main contractors is the Education Development Center in Newton, Massachusetts. This center has a subcontract at the School of Education at Harvard University (Catherine Snow, Patton Tabors, and Lilia Bartolome) for investigations that will deal exclusively with language diversity in Head Start classrooms and its impact on teaching, parent involvement, social service delivery, and administration.\n\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH)\n\nNIH is a constellation of 22 institutes and centers. We spoke to research officials in two of the institutes that most often fund research related to education: the National Institute for Mental Health and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nWe found that a small amount of research is focused directly on the special populations in which we are interested, but that it is not a strong priority. There are some indications that NIH is becoming more interested in subpopulations; it can be hoped that language will occupy a significant place in these emerging priorities.\n\nPage 393\n\nAndrew Porter, is aware of any projects that have targeted English-language learners or dealt with language issues in math and science instruction. A search of projects in progress at NSF uncovered three that focus on English-language learners; however, only one could be considered researcha project to enhance the science education of elementary-age bilingual students (see Appendix C)\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS)\n\nThe largest federal department relating to domestic policy, DHHS sponsors many programs that encounter issues related to language minorities and the education of English-language learners. We contacted officials in two department-wide offices that deal with research and evaluation, plus the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)\n\nASPE is responsible for policy analysis and advice, policy development, strategic and implementation planning, and the coordination and conduct of evaluation and policy research. As part of its overall mission, ASPE undertakes a variety of research and evaluation projects addressing issues affecting children and youth, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The office operates a small research and evaluation program that focuses primarily on crosscutting or emerging policy issues that are outside the scope of the program-focused studies conducted by the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families or other DHHS program units. Within ASPE, most studies on child and youth issues originate from the Division of Children and Youth Policy, a component of the Office of Human Services Policy.\n\nASPE encounters issues related to English-language learners and their families primarily as regards the health and human service areas that are the department's responsibility. In research, for example, ASPE is cosponsoring the first large-scale experimental evaluation of how child growth and development, mother-child relationships, and maternal functioning are affected by mothers' mandatory participation in welfare-to-work programs. This studythe Child Outcomes Study in the JOBS Evaluationis cosponsored by the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families and the Department of Education. The sample in one site (Riverside, California) includes immigrant families, and the study uses a research strategy that addresses potential differences for these families. Children were aged 3-5 years when their mothers entered the study. Outcomes are assessed 2 and 5 years later using data obtained from home interviews with mothers and children, and, at 5 years, surveys of teachers. The study will provide data on developmental trajectories and outcomes in all domains, including physical health and safety, cognitive and social development, and school adjustment.\n\nASPE is also providing partial support to the Board on Children, Youth, and\n\nPage 392\n\nthe transition from school to work for Asian American students with disabilities; and another was a dropout prevention project on Hispanic adolescents with emotional disturbances (for a complete list, see Appendix C). Most of these projects came from field-initiated competitions open to proposals on any topic dealing with special education. In the case of the dropout project, the agency held a competition focusing on that topic.\n\nPreviously, the agency held a direct competition for any projects dealing with LEP issues among children with disabilities. This competition provided funds for the selected researchers to meet twice a year; these meetings proved so useful that the researchers applied for and received a grant to continue the meetings for 2 years.\n\nThe Division for Innovation and Development also funds some policy research indirectly. For example, it funds forums and focus groups. Among these is the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, which has conducted policy research on the overrepresentation of minorities in special education programs.\n\nIt seems, then, that there is some substantial attention to LEP education research issues within the federal infrastructure for research on special education. It may also be noted as an impression of many education policy experts (including, for example, Marshall Smith, the current Under Secretary of Education) that research on special education carried out by the same agency that administers federal programs in the area has been a successful arrangementmore fruitful and less controversial than the case of OBEMLA, for whatever reasons (interview of Marshall Smith by Kaestle, 1991, in the NRC project). To the extent that this is true, the reduction of research funds within OSEP and the transfer of some authority over any future funds to OERI is a dramatic shift.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)\n\nNSF is a federal agency governed by the National Science Board; it is not located within a department. It contains seven major units, called directorates. Six of these are in substantive areas such as engineering and the biological sciences; these directorates fund research and training in those fields. The seventh, called the Directorate on Education and Human Resources, funds research on math and science education in elementary and secondary schools. This directorate's Division on Research, Evaluation, and Communication, with a budget of about $50 million, has major action research projects, such as the Statewide Systemic Initiatives program. About $12 million goes for research and development on the uses of technology in education, $10 million for basic research on teaching and learning math and science, and $2 million per year for the new National Institute on Science Education at the University of Wisconsin. Neither the Director of the Division on Research, Evaluation, and Dissemination, Daryl Chubin, nor the codirector of the National Institute on Science Education,\n\nPage 391\n\nevaluations, funded sparsely, are done by PES. Its modest discretionary money is generally used for conferences or field-initiated program projects (Kristin Gilbert, personal communication).\n\nOffice of Special Education Programs (OSEP)\n\nThis office is within the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services in the Department of Education. Unlike the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services does its own evaluation work, in consultation with PES. Within OSEP, Louis Danielson directs the Division for Innovation and Development, which has a budget of about $20 million a year. Most of that money is loosely in what Danielson calls research, though by statute the research must all be applied. The other four divisions do less research, but together they may bring the total for research and quasi-research activities up to about $50 million (Louis Danielson, personal communication).\n\nThe principal legislation governing and funding special education activities at the federal level is called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which may be slated for reauthorization in the 105th Congress. The House bill passed June 11, 1996. Included within the research program is a requirement that the secretary develop a comprehensive plan within 12 months of the bill's enactment. Research priorities within the House bill include projects that advance knowledge about teaching and learning practices and assessment techniques, instruments, and strategies, as well as the development and learning characteristics of children with disabilities; large-scale longitudinal studies; model demonstration projects to apply and test research findings; and projects that apply research and other knowledge to improve educational results by synthesizing useful research, and ensuring that it is in the appropriate format for use and available through various information sources. Both the House and Senate bills authorize level funding.\n\nIn the recent past, there has been a substantial budget for applied research special education. Louis Danielson (personal communication) explained that his division funds projects for researchers at three different levels: studies by doctoral students, studies by researchers in their initial career (first 5 years beyond doctorate), and field-initiated research by more senior researchers (grants of up to $180,000 per year). He cited several projects addressing language issues in special education (that is, dealing both with students having limited English proficiency and those having some learning disability requiring that they have an Individual Educational Plan). One such project was Promoting Literacy Through Ecobehavioral Assessment, which addressed both types of students; another examined the perceptions of parents of Hispanic children with learning disabilities; another studied parental involvement and literacy among both types of students; another focused on comprehensive instruction for these students; another studied\n\nPage 390\n\nalmost all of OBEMLA's research projects, but also receiving outright the funds for many projects that PES initiated and monitored. From 1980 to 1991, PES received and monitored about half of the Title VII research funds, totaling $20.6 million (Chapman, 1992). These included the big \"horse-race\" evaluation studies of effective instructional program types (the Longitudinal and Immersion studies). Yet whatever the merits of PES's views of OBEMLA over the years, it is clear that PES projects on bilingual education did not escape reasonable criticism either (see Chapter 6).\n\nPES's most recent large survey is called Prospects: The Congressionally Mandated Study of Educational Growth and Opportunity. The First Year Report on Language Minority and Limited English Proficient Students (Moss and Puma, 1995) presents descriptive information from the first 2 years of data collection (1991 and 1992) for two of the three cohorts examined in Prospects (the first and third grades), characterizing two groups of studentslanguage-minority students and English-language learners. (See Appendix C for a list of all ongoing Title VII projects in PES.)\n\nThe future status of the relationship between PES and OBEMLA around the funding of research on English-language learners is not clear. The reauthorization of OERI calls for the Assistant Secretary, with the guidance of the new National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board, to coordinate research across agencies. Secretary Riley (1995) has interpreted this to include evaluation work.\n\nOther Agencies Within the Department of Education\n\nThe bulk of funding aimed at research on language-minority and LEP issues has to date been located in OBEMLA, PES, and OERI (including NCES). Many large program areas, such as the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, fund programs (such as Title I) that serve significant numbers of English-language learners. But these offices do not have money designated for research, and some of them (including the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education) use PES for their program evaluation. We interviewed officials at two other offices to see whether they have funded research or evaluation of LEP issues.\n\nThe Office of Migrant Education\n\nThis office reports to the Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education. It administers about $300 million in programs for migrant education, mostly in formula grants to state agencies and in technical assistance. For over 10 years there were three program coordination centers, located geographically in the midst of the three main migrant streams. These centers did some descriptive research. The New York center, for example, looked at migrant dropouts. But the Office of Migrant Education has little or no money for research per se, and its\n\nPage 389\n\nthere are currently 11. From the start, the envisioned collaboration between the centers and the laboratories failed to materialize.\n\nThe regional laboratories, then, are largely independent of the centers and carry on a mix of research, development, assistance, and dissemination activities within their regions (for evaluation of the laboratories, see Kaestle, 1992; Vinovskis, 1993; and Turnbull et al., 1994). Various specialties have been developed in the laboratories, depending on their leadership, their staffs, or regional needs. Until 1994, the laboratories were overseen by the Programs for the Improvement of Practice. When the five institutes were created, ORAD was also formed to oversee professional development programs, the National Diffusion Network, and other development and dissemination activities, including the regional laboratories. According to Eve Bither (personal communication), first acting director of the new office, some laboratories have ongoing projects that involve LEP issues; for example, the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory has a Border Colloquy Project attempting to develop common projects in education with Mexican educators, while the Far West Laboratory had a project examining how English-language learners are incorporated into school restructuring efforts.\n\nIn the recently completed competition, regional laboratories were required to develop special themes. Three of the funded proposals are for laboratories that will specialize in language and cultural diversity. One these will be in the Northeastern Region (serving New England, New York, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands), hosted by Brown University; another will be in the Southwestern Region, at the current Southwest Educational Development Laboratory in Austin (serving Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, and New Mexico); and the third will be in the Pacific Region (serving Hawaii, Samoa, Guam, and the other Pacific islands with U.S. status), located in Honolulu (Education Week, January 10, 1996).\n\nThe Planning and Evaluation Service (PES), Office of the\n\nUnder Secretary of Education\n\nPES provides program evaluation services and other assistance to the Under Secretary. When it was located in OPBE, it was one of the original participants in the Part C Coordinating Committee, and in that venue became locked in a struggle with OBEMLA as described earlier. The discord continues to the present. Valena Plisko (personal communication), head of PES's elementary and secondary education evaluations, says relations between PES and the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, as well as other offices, are generally collaborative and effective, while relations with OBEMLA h"
