Curren$y will be dropping his latest project, New Jet City on Super Bowl Sunday. Recently, Spitta gave us a video with some insight into the project's creation. A Jet Life Film and Street Customs Media Division presentation, "5 Minutes" gives viewers a small preview of the track “Choosin” featuring Rick Ross and Wiz Khalifa. It also gives us live show footage of a recent show in Curren$y's hometown of New Orleans. Watch it above.
