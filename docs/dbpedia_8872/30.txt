While most pot heads are spending the day pulling on blunts, Curren$y is providing the soundtrack with Bourbon Street Secrets, his collab effort with Purps of 808 Mafia.

Sticking with the theme of dropping projects that include famous New Orleans street names in the title, Spitta followed up Canal Street Confidential with The Carrollton Heist and now Bourbon Street Secrets. The six-track project taps Rick Ross for "Dope Boys" as Curren$y shoulders the rest of the work. The hometown hero can't stop working this year as he's already dropped five projects through four months of 2016. Clear, concise and straight to the point, each project gives just enough to leave fans wanting more.

To honor the holiday and the release of his project, Spitta has embarked on a mini-tour that kicked off last night (April 19) in New Orleans. The MC will make stops in Houston, Dallas, San Marcos and San Antonio, Texas over the course of the next week. Once he returns from the tour, the N.O. MC will join Chance the Rapper, Tory Lanez, Desiigner and more on Summer Jamâ€™s Festival Stage.

The Jet Life rapper also released the video for "Theme Music (GTA)," which features a very stoned Spitta showing off his whips as he rides along with an equally stoned woman and raps for the camera. Fitting into his no-frills aesthetic, "GTA" encompasses everything we've come to know and love about the rapper.
