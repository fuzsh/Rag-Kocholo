        "text": "A key step in determining the political future of a long-time Los Angeles city councilmember facing criminal charges was under consideration Friday when colleagues considered moving ahead with his suspension.\n\nBut the Los Angeles City Council committee charged with making the recommendation completed its\n\ndiscussions for the day and moved to other agenda items. Discussions about Councilmember Curren Price's future on the council are set to resume at another time.\n\nWhen they do, the council committee will forward its recommendation regarding Price, who has represented his district for 10 years. Friday's meeting came a day after supporters of the long-time Southern California politician demanded any decision on suspension be placed on hold as the legal process plays out. Price is facing charges of embezzlement, perjury and conflict of interest.\n\n“I am pleased that the City Council’s Rules Committee has delayed its vote, as I have not yet had the opportunity to answer the unwarranted charges against me in Court,\" Price said in a statement. \"I hope that the Committee, and the full Council, will extend to me the same presumption of innocence that the law extends to me, and I look forward to proving my innocence.\n\n\"Lastly, my sincerest gratitude to the dozens and dozens of neighbors, the young and young at heart, who came out in droves to speak from the heart on all the wonderful work taking place across OUR community. Your voices mattered and roared like thunder across City Hall today. I'm so unbelievably humble and proud to be your public servant.\"\n\nHe could become the third member of the council to be suspended in the last three years over criminal charges.\n\n\"This is our leader, this is our city councilor,\" Dr. Jerry Abraham, a community physician, said Thursday during a news conference in South Los Angeles. \"Let us be represented. Let us have a voice at the table so we can continue to do the work God has intended us to do -- to help, to heal… to bring everyone together.\"\n\nAs it turned out, through, Price bused most of the nearly 60 supporters to the meeting himself.\n\nOne District 9 resident said he couldn't speak Friday because the room was at capacity. If he had the chance to speak, he said he would have urged the committee to suspend price.\n\nIn a statement, Price's office told NBC4 that the busing was done in good faith.\n\n\"Constituents and community leaders reached out to the Councilmember asking for help in getting to the meeting. Many people who live in the 9th district face challenges with transportation. The Councilmember provided these residents with a bus. Next time this type of meeting must be held in the district,\" the statement read.\n\nPrice, the Ninth District representative, and the community leaders at Thursday's event insisted he should remain active on the council as he fights the corruption charges.\n\n\"I have lived my entire life in public service honorably and with no other focus than the best interests of my constituents,\" Price said. \"As such, I am eager to respond both to the misguided charges that have been filed against me, and the unfair aspersions that have been cast upon my wife. I am confident that the court, and any fair observers, will recognize that these charges are unwarranted.\"\n\nPrice, 72, was charged June 13 and is accused of voting on projects in which he held a financial interest. His wife's company allegedly received payments from projects that her husband voted to approve, according to prosecutors. He's also accused of embezzling money by having the city cover medical insurance premiums for his now-wife, even though Price was still married to his first wife at the time.\n\nPrice has said he is not guilty of the accusations.\n\nThe Rules, Elections, and Intergovernmental Relations Committee decision will return to the full council for consideration.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Price has represented the Ninth District, which includes most of South Los Angeles and the western part of downtown Los Angeles, since 2013. He previously served in the state Assembly and state Senate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the council appointed Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson to replace him as president pro tempore. Price was not in attendance at Tuesday's meeting, and he will not attend any of the remaining meetings this week, according to his office. Price earlier announced his decision to step down as council president pro tem and yield all of his committee assignments.\n\nThe allegations against Price add to the scandals plaguing City Hall. Former council members Jose Huizar and Mitch Englander have both pleaded guilty to federal charges in recent years, while Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas was convicted earlier this year of federal charges for trading votes during his time on the county Board of Supervisors in exchange for benefits provided by USC to his son.\n\nFormer City Council President Nury Martinez resigned last year after being caught on tape in a racially charged conversation with two other council members and a county labor official discussing the council's redistricting process. Councilman Kevin De León, also part of the conversation that veered wildly into racist remarks about a now-former council members young Black adopted son, has refused calls to resign.\n\nNBC4's Darsha Philips contributed to this story."
