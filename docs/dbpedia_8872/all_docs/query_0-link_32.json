        "text": "Jared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nPrince Williams\n\nRanking the 10 greatest southern cities in hip-hop music\n\nAn advent of pioneers in South Bronx, New York City, hip-hop is a distinct musical genre in that it is tied closer to cultural identity than it is commercial production. Characterized by the prominence of the spoken word, laid rhythmically over drums and samples, hip-hop, as a musical entity, has melded with pre-existing regional cultures to create new concepts, techniques and even subgenres.\n\nPractitioners and fans alike have injected hip-hop's influence into many geographical locales, as the genre has made its passage through time. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw an extreme power shift in hip-hop from New York to Los Angeles. While the West Coast-centric rap sound took footholds on radio waves and sparked increasing interest in televisions and magazines, a third coast primed itself for eventual dominance in the budding music style.\n\nThe Southern United States, often thought of as the birthplace of America's music may have had a late start in the hip-hop game, but by the mid-1990s several upstart labels built below the Mason-Dixon line had garnered significant footing in the rap business. Two decades later, many critics with eyes geared on the genre are worried the South may never cease its current reign as the most commercially viable and stylistically diverse region in the rap business.\n\nIt took those twenty years to change the way hip-hop media, fans and performers think of Southern Rap. And it was the cities which manufactured the scenes that forced the conversation South.\n\nSo, now that Southern Rap has gotten this far, which cities hold the most impact?\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\n10. Huntsville, AL\n\nThe outlook of hip-hop in the Internet age looks bleak in regards to movements based on regional affiliation. The distribution of hip-hop is so vast, word of mouth doesn't quite work the way it might have in the late 90s and early 2000s, when Southern rappers were almost always sold to the masses in package deals.\n\nHunstville, however, stands out as a wildcard for this list, and a place where many hip-hop music fans and critics have their eye on what's next. In a state where sporadic efforts have drawn attention to Mobile, Birmingham and Montgomery, Huntsville has presented a steady growth as a nucleus of Alabama's hip-hop anatomy. Furthermore, proximity to Atlanta seems to have helped encourage entertainment entrepreneurship in the Rocket City. If it takes a village to raise a child, Huntsville hip-hop, while still in its infancy, has a promising future.\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at The Rocket City...\n\nHometown anthems: \"Relaxin'\" - G-Side, \"Rollin'\" - Jackie Chain, \"Fresh Dressed\" - 6 Tre G ft.

Nashville, TN\n\nUnfortunately, if you'd ask people why Nashville is known nationally as the Music City, hip-hop dominance would be low-ranking in the list of accolades responsible for the monicker. The sprawling Middle Tennessee metropolis has reinvented itself in recent decades from a sleepy area to a booming entertainment hub, where recording studios are so prevelent, it wouldn't be an odd occurence to stumble into a session on accident. And where music isn't being recorded, it's surely being performed.\n\nIt's difficult not to know a sound engineer in Nashville. Rest assure, when the fiddles are put away, emcees are booking the same rooms to get rhymes on wax. For that reason, the hip-hop scene in Nashville is hectic, as a new tribe of college-aged kids are duking it out in a crowded mid-tier circuit of talented hip-hop innovators. The results of this phenoma has yet to be seen, with few significant stars emerging as outlilers in the last decade. Luckily, Nashville has a few 2000s rap giants to stand out in front of the pack, for the time being.\n\nYou may have heard of: Young Buck of G-Unit\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at Cashville...\n\nHometown anthems:\n\nPioneers: Blow Pop Crew, Desire & the Ville Posse, Kool Daddy Fresh, Pistol\n\nActs you need to know: Starlito (formerly All-Star the Cashville Prince), Dee Goodz, VILLZ, Kiya Lacey, Haystak, Jelly Roll\n\nProjects you must hear: Young Buck's Straight Outta Cashville (2004), Starlito's Black Sheep Don't Grin (2014), Kool Daddy Fresh's It's All True (1994)\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\n8. Dallas-Fort Worth, TX\n\nTexas towns have exhibited hit-making consistency in hip-hop, often being the go-to for new flavor in periods in which innovation lulls in the mainstream sector. Occasional stray hits from the Dallas-Fort Worth area have lent to several ringtone dance crazes in the post-MySpace musical age. Although, that kind of productivity does nothing to highlight Dallas' storied freestyle history.\n\nIt's these two elements: club scene swagger and sharp-witted improvisation, that categorize hip-hop in Dallas-Fort Worth (and to a lesser extend Arlington). There is a carefree energy in the Metroplex that permeated Badu's neo-soul cool and Kirk Franklin's 'feels-so-good-you'll-think-it's-secular' gospel-hop in the mid 1990s. That same spirit makes Dallas a hotbed for sharing hip-hop culture today.\n\nYou may have heard of: The D.O.C., Post Malone, Kirk Franklin, Erykah Badu, Vanilla Ice (unfortunately)\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at the Triple D...\n\nHometown anthems: \"Bust It Open\" - Lil' Wil, \"Not a Stain On Me\" - Big Tuck, \"Caprice Musik\" - Tum Tum, \"Crook For Life\" - Mr. Pookie, \"Ice Cream Paint Job\" - Dorrough, \"Stanky Leg\" - GS Boyz, \"Too Young\" - Post Malone, \"Oak Cliff (That's My Hood)\" - Young Nino\n\nPioneers: Fila Fresh Crew, The D.O.C., D.S.R.

Baton Rouge, LA\n\nBaton Rouge hip-hop is all about honesty. It's biggest stars in the '90s and now have made names for themselves on and off record for their unabashed approach to the public sector. Where New Orleans has had more marquee success with labels such as No Limit, Cash Money, and Young Money, at every turn, it seems, Baton Rouge artists have remained in the fold of Louisiana's rap operations. C-Loc and Young Bleed's Concentration Camp stable of artist piggybacked the success of their contribution to Master P's I'm Bout It film soundtrack in 1997, \"How Ya Do That.\" The song served as a rally cry for Baton Rouge, announcing their arrival in the rap game.\n\nThe song, very much a forebear to crossover club titles, such as \"Wipe Me Down\" and \"Independent\", is a bit of an anomally, however. Where Baton Rouge rappers shine most, is in the mud, as a true working class clan, obsessed with the gritty realities life. When examining the painful discourse on songs such as Lil' Boosie's \"Dirty World\", Kevin Gate's \"4:30 a.m.\" and Lil' Handy's \"Watching My Life Go Down\", listeners understand the dark distinction of music in the Big Raggedy, juxtaposed with the more jubilant tradition of rap from their cousins in the Big Easy.\n\nYou may have heard of: Boosie Badazz (formerly Lil' Boosie), Kevin Gates\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at Jigga City...\n\nHometown anthems: \"Wipe Me Down\" - Lil' Boosie ft.

Virginia Beach-Norfolk, VA\n\nVirginia's story in hip-hop is a tricky one. Make no mistakes, in 2016, the place is no more hip-hop than any other Southern city of significant size. Throw a dart at a map of most rural areas today, and you're likely to find at least two guys rapping in a field somewhere.\n\nWhere Virginia cannot go ignored however, is the immeasurable contribtion to the culture by a close-knit group of tastemakers that began to gel in the early 1990s. With the arrival of super-producer Teddy Riley, high school kids throughout Virginia began showcasing their craft at talent shows in hopes of getting noticed by the maestro behind Guy, Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" and the New Jack Swing sound. Among those teens were future megastars Timbaland, Missy Elliott, Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo.\n\nThose four names are responsible for significant amounts of hits on hip-hop and pop radio in the last 20 years, giving the Top 40 a bit of street edge. You name it: Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Aaliyah, Nelly Furtado, Mystikal, Gwen Stefani, Ginuwine, Jodeci - they all owe this Virginia quartet a big thank you. That doesn't even begin to mention the amount of artists influenced by the spaced out funk these four provided.\n\nDespite Top 40 success, this troupe of Virginia producers always have reached back to hardcore hip-hop to give artists, such as Pusha T and Fam-Lay and experimental take on their urban sound.\n\nLooking forward, D.R.A.M., a resident of nearby Hampton, has reinvigorated interest in the area via his radio success with single, \"Cha-Cha\" and his superb debut record in the final quarter of 2016.\n\nYou may have heard of: Pharrell Williams, Missy Elliott, The Clipse, Timbaland, N*E*R*D\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at VA Beach and Shark City...\n\nHometown anthems: \"Rump Shaker\" - Wreckx-n-Effect, \"Broccoli\" - D.R.A.M. ft.

Memphis, TN\n\nIn 2003, DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia dubbed Memphis, \"The City Where They Love to Hate\", based on a history of infighting that has marred the development of artists from the Mid-South. In the 1990s Three 6's Prophet Posse record label had evolved from a supergroup of the best rap talent from all sides of the city. From the outside looking in, most every prominent emcee from Memphis was either a part of the possee or a former member-turned foe.\n\nThat's far from the truth, however, as Memphis is notorious for an ever-changing landscape of homegrown talent that has only been amplified in the digital music market. Fittingly so, as Memphis was the setting of Hustle & Flow, the film responsible for exposing the wonders of DIY rap production to the world at the precise moment that pop culture met with a budding social media consciousness.\n\nYou may have heard of: Three 6 Mafia, 8Ball & MJG, Yo Gotti\n\nMATHIAS HENRY\n\nA closer look at The M-Town...\n\nHometown anthems: \"That's What's Up (Intro)\" - Yo Gotti, \"Nobody\" - Playa Fly ft.

Miami, FL\n\nMiami is the city having the most fun in hip-hop. Sure, they city has had its fair share of rough and gruff cocaina kingpin characters a la Rick Ross, but even the 'Boss' makes time for fun in the Sun on each of his albums.\n\nThe M.I.A. is one of the first Southern cities to garner a sizeable spotlight in the greater rap conversation, albeit under fairly controversial circumstances. The raunchy 2 Live Crew was the world's second most shocking rap group after conservative America thought they'd be done pulling their hair out after N.W.A. had their moment. Nope! Leave it to Florida to supplement the West Coast's ultra-violent gang reality with a heavy dose of an pornographic audio invasion.\n\nEven the most prudish owner of ears would have to admit, Miami's bombastic bass music scene has stylistic merit. DJs layered sample after sample at a breakneck speed and the bikini-clad patrons of the party danced at a pace that could break hips. Of all regional hip-hop sounds, The trend among the newest crop of Miami rappers, such as Spaceghostpurrp, Robb Bank$ and Kodak Black show signs of a disturbingly grim sound coming from the slums of Dade and Broward Counties. Still, Miami's take on the genre is the most appropriate for it's native surroundings. In South Florida, life's a beach.\n\nYou may have heard of: 2 Live Crew, DJ Khaled (transplanted from New Orleans), Pitbull, Flo-Rida, Rick Ross\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at M.I.A...\n\nHometown anthems: \"Scarred\" - Uncle Luke ft.

New Orleans, LA\n\nBounce-biggity-bounce is the name of the game in New Orleans, baby. The style of emceeing popular at barbecues and parades is closer to Caribbean toasting and the early crowd-rocking technique New York microphone fiends employed in hip-hop's inception. NOLA doesn't shy away from call-and-response chants, many of which have been co-opted for communal use at live shows and on studio records. You've probably heard enough to know how to respond when the MC shouts out. \"Where they at, where they at?\" or \"Go DJ, that's my DJ.\"\n\nAside from bounce, New Orleans has made a name for itself with serious lyrical technicians, such as Fiend, Mystikal, Soulja Slim, Mac and Lil' Wayne, who went on a tear in his post-Hot Boys career. He's entered the Billboard Top 100 more than Elvis and remains the gold standard for over-productivitity in the modern music market.\n\nYou may have heard of: Lil' Wayne, Juvenile, Birdman (formerly Baby), Mystikal, Master P\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at Chopper City...\n\nHometown anthems: \"Where They At?\" - DJ Jimi, \"Drag 'Em in tha River\" - UNLV, \"Monkey on a Stick\" - Magnolia Shorty, \"I'll Pay For It\" - Soulja Slim, \"Rode That\" - Ha-Sizzle, \"Here I Go\" - Mystikal, \"That's My Juvie\" - Magnolia Shorty, \"Nasty Trick\" - Bust Down, \"Bunny Hop\" - Da Entourage\n\nPioneers: Gregory D & DJ Mannie Fresh, Cameron Paul, DJ Jubilee, Master P & The Real Untouchables, Ninja Crew, Tim Smooth, Warren Mays\n\nActs you need to know: Fiend, Jay Electronica, Pell, Young Roddy, Soulja Slim (formerly Magnolia Slim), Big Freedia, B.G., Mia X, Curren$y, Solange Knowles, Mac, Sissy Nobby, Magic, Mr. Ghetto, Mr. Marcelo, Trademark da $kydiver, Frank Ocean, Silkk the Shocker, T.Y., Kidd Kidd of G-Unit, August Alsina, Miss Tee, 5th Ward Weebie, Keedy Black\n\nProjects you must hear: Soulja Slim's Give it 2 'Em Raw (1998), B.G.'s It's All On U Volume, 1 (1997), Mia X's Unlady Like (1997), Master P's Ghetto D (1997), Lil' Wayne's Dedication 2, Curren$y's Covert Coup (2011), TRU's Tru 2 da Game (1997), Fiend's Tennis Shoes & Tuxedos (2011), Mac's Shell Shocked (1998), Juvenile's 400 Degreez (1998), Trademark da Skydiver's Super Villain: Issue 2 (2010)\n\nMost known for: A high-energy, percussive style of hip-hop club cadences known as Bounce Music, as well as early 1990s hardhitting entries from Big Boy, Cash Money and No Limit Records.\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\n2. Houston, TX\n\nHouston might seem like a fast-paced place to visit, complete with winding highways, large gallerias and some of Texas' largest edifices dedicated to commerce. In hip-hop, the town is better known as the City of Syrup, though. And, much like the recreational cough medicine concoction it is associated with, the rap music native to Houston invokes a slow, heavy feeling once it sets in.\n\nIt's a little weird, because people in Houston record their music at a normal pace. Those versions of songs, seemingly are for everyone else. As songs in Houston are best enjoyed by locals once a DJ slows them down ever so slightly, and cuts the track back and forth to create a stuttering of the most important lyrics. It's a delicate procedure, one that Houstonians take very seriously.\n\nThe technique, known as \"chopped and screwed\" or simply \"screwed\", was perfected by the late DJ Screw, who cultivated a loosely tied crew of rappers and singers that could freestyle endlessly to popular instrumentals in his home. After they were done, Screw would go to work slowing everything down before dubbing his mixes to cassette and spreading them throughout Houston.\n\nIn his honor, things are still pretty slow down in the H-Town, a perfect compliment to their signature, Texas drawl.\n\nYou may have heard of: Scarface (of the Geto Boys), Paul Wall, Mike Jones, RiFF RaFF, Chamillionaire, UGK (often associated with Houston, but actually from Port Arthur, TX)\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at H-Town...\n\nHometown anthems: \"25 Lighters\" - DJ DMD ft.

The technique, known as \"chopped & screwed\" music, is ideal for Sunday-night driving sessions that are commonplace in the city. Houston is also the home to the most rappers that can croon almost as well as they can rap.\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\n1. Atlanta, GA\n\nHere you'll find no surprise. Definitively, Atlanta is the South's epicenter, as far as music and entertainment is involved. In hip-hop, Atlanta has come so far that the genre's birthplace, New York City, has conceded much of its importance to Atlanta. Even much of the infrastructure that operates the rap machine has traveled further South along the Atlantic coast to find home in Georgia.\n\nA lot has changed in the two decades since Atlanta hosted the 1996 Olympics. The year was a milestone in Atlanta's growth as a city, but hip-hop had already made inroads in the community. LaFace Records, owned by R&B producer/songwriters Babyface and L.A. Reid, had already fostered the careers of TLC, Outkast, Usher and Toni Braxton. New kid on the block, Jermaine Dupri was coaching groups Xscape and Kris Kross to crossover success at SoSo Def Records where a then-unknown A&R named Lil' Jon was putting the pieces together for his success as a producer.\n\nFast forward a near decade and you'll find a former local radio host named Ludacris in a heated battle for supremacy with T.I., the leader of a new crop of Atlanta rappers whose repertoire is built around the tragic heroism of the trap. Along with Young Jeezy and Gucci Mane, this new crop of rappers fixated on stories of drug hustling would reshape Atlanta's fun-loving identity, not only in content, but in sound. The rebirth of Roland 808 drum patterns that took hip-hop out of the ashes of disco and separated it from more electric relatives in techno and house, made Atlanta's young stars feel larger than life.\n\nAs we stand 10 years removed from that moment, Atlanta in 2016 is still the focal point of modern rap. The city's notorious strip clubs have more say in who's next than the executives sitting in on boardroom conference calls at major labels. Blogs and social media pundits bend at the mercy of Atlanta's relentless onslaught of swag. Year in and year out, a new group of artists replace the harvest from seasons past, and only the most essential players remain to stand the test of time. No matter where grew up, if you rap and you want to be successful, a move to Atlanta isn't a bad idea. There's no signs of that changing any time soon.\n\nYou may have heard of: Lil' Jon & the Eastside Boyz, Kris Kross, Ludacris, Outkast, TLC, 2 Chainz (formerly Tity Boi), Young Jeezy, T.I., Ying Yang Twinz, B.O.B., Gucci Mane, Usher, Cee-Lo (of Goodie Mob & Gnarls Barkley), Ciara, Future, Arrested Development, Killer Mike (of Run the Jewels)\n\nJared Boyd | JBoyd@al.com\n\nA closer look at the A...\n\nHometown anthems: \"You Got to Be Tough\" - MC Shy D, \"Whoomp!
