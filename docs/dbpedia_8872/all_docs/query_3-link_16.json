        "text": "“Everything weird.”\n\nI can’t think of another time in my life where that statement applies to so much. The prolonged eruption of Covid-19 has forced us to make this newfound weirdness as normal as possible. It’s hard to walk anywhere without some mention or threat of a mask. In typical fashion, corporations have tried and failed at marketing the weirdness back to us for profit, and the entertainment industry is trying their best to turn our living rooms into music venues. It’s all weird, and it trickles to every aspect of life, including hip-hop.\n\nThe musical output in hip-hop has lacked since quarantine began in what can now only be described as a “void year.” Any new music that is released aims to sidestep the current climate completely or continue the discussion around racial injustice issues that have captivated the entire country for two months. The pandemic is still going on, but hip-hop hasn’t had much interest in discussing it any many ways.\n\nThe most valiant effort in addressing the trauma and uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic came last Friday when Curren$y released his 10th(!) studio album “The OutRunners.” His newest album treads along as a standard Curren$y project does, kickback music with inspirational lyrics disguised as weed raps. But suddenly, at track four, “Gold and Chrome” creeps into the mix.\n\nHere, Curren$y ashes the joint and parks the ’62 Impala to talk about the uncertainty, trauma, and “weirdness” of this new way of life. It’s a rare selection from Spitta, who is more known for showcasing the fruitions of his hustle than describing the discouraging aspects of his life. Producer Harry Fraud uses a potpourri of nostalgia-inducing sounds-like a lengthy violin rhythm and intermittent horn section to accompany the anchoring guitar chords-to give Curren$y the right table setting to talk about the past, present and future.\n\nSpitta’s lyrical ability shines on Fraud’s sepia-filtered beat, finding slick ways to discuss how our new necessary behavior has affected his life. “No more high fiving your homies with your palms open/You gotta watch who you go home with it, watch who you smoke with,” he says at the end of the first verse, later affirming the current ethos of the world where “Being smart’s synonymous with germophobics.” He’s still not used to UFC fights without the crowd noise or the NBA being in a “biosphere.” Curren$y describes it best: “Everything weird.”\n\nHe reminisces about watching the Mardi Gras parades roll by before the world closed. About his homie he saw cruising the block only a month ago, who ultimately lost his life to the virus like hundreds of thousands have across America. The main object of his musings about the pandemic, however, is his first and only son, who Spitta hopes can “roll on gold and chrome” when he grows up, just like his pops. He displays the concerned optimism of a father when he thinks about the world being back to normal, saying, “I’m sure change gon’ take some years/But I hope it all clear before my son hit the streets, trying to shift gears.”\n\nCurren$y gave hip-hop the most genuine attempt to tackle the mental stress surrounding the pandemic to date.\n\nIn most cases, hip-hop has turned words like “quarantine” and “pandemic” into flexing metaphors. On “Solitaire,” from his new album “High On Life,” Future says, “Coronavirus diamonds, you can catch the flu.” Turbo, Gunna, and Young Thug addressed the pandemic by making “Quarantine Clean,” describing their high-class vibe while stuck in the crib. The examples stretch to Nicki Minaj, Sahbabii, and even Beyonce. Some artists, like Gmac Cash and Trippie Redd, have found ways to be proactive in championing for masks and social distancing, but none have taken the time to discuss the mental trauma that comes with the shutdown and quarantine.\n\nThere’s no right way to make music about the pandemic. The turnt-up songs that infuse jest with terms that define our everyday weirdness are just as necessary as the serious attempts to put our current situation in perspective. But the latter is lacking in quantity and concerted attempts."
