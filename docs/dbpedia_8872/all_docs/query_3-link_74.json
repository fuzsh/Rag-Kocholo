        "text": "It genuinely triggers me that East City seemingly has car dealers befitting of all GT2 districts - apart from East City.\n\nAlso El Camino is definitely a manufacturer and not just a Chevrolet model, amirite? Actually, given that it doesn't have a comma at the end when all the others have, that technically reads as \"El Camino BMW\", which makes even less sense.\n\nAlso also it's definitely meant to be GT2 style and yet only two of the brands listed were actually in GT2. Lamborghini, Bentley, Porsche and Rolls Royce? Because Alfa Romeo, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz/Audi and Aston Martin are just not rap game enough, I take it? In which case, why go with Chevrolet over Cadillac? I mean, the Escalade is still ballin', right? People still say \"ballin'\", don't they?\n\nWHY DOES THIS RAISE SO MANY QUESTIONS?\n\nPeople still say \"ballin'\", don't they?\n\nSpeaking as the 41-year old Brit who wrote this article having never heard of all but one of the people named in it and doesn't recognise any music after 1987 (with the exception of They Might Be Giants) and thus the least suitable person on the entire writing team to cover it...\n\n... I have no idea.\n\nThis really was genuinely painful to write, and if it doesn't actually appear terrible I'm counting it as a win.\n\nSpeaking as the 41-year old Brit who wrote this article having never heard of all but one of the people named in it and doesn't recognise any music after 1987 (with the exception of They Might Be Giants) and thus the least suitable person on the entire writing team to cover it...\n\n... I have no idea.\n\nThis really was genuinely painful to write, and if it doesn't actually appear terrible I'm counting it as a win.\n\nWell, don't ask me for any help as I'm still stuck in the 90s.\n\nAll I can tell you is there's 3, no 4 typos in the article title alone. Shokkingah\n\nThis just reminded me that this exists...\n\nSpeaking of Snoop Dogg / Lion did you know that he used to be a main guest in GT6 events back then.\n\nAs for the news OP music, I think its okay for a rap but problem is that its doesn't feel like or actually reference to actual Gran Turismo Series at all (in name and cover only shtick).\n\nSpeaking of Snoop Dogg / Lion did you know that he used to be a main guest in GT6 events back then.\n\nAs for the news OP music, I think its okay for a rap but problem is that its doesn't feel like or actually reference to actual Gran Turismo Series at all (in name and cover only shtick).\n\nI got horses in the back dawg\n\nIts music , it is not a game . What would be the copyright infringement ?\n\nThat would be like suing the beachboys for all their car songs would it not ?\n\nThey’re using the Gran Turismo name and logo on the album cover and profiting from the music. That absolutely would be copyright infringement. They either paid for the license or have some kind of agreement with Sony to use it.\n\nThey either paid for the license or have some kind of agreement with Sony to use\n\nWell let us how the lawsuit goes . Im Im betting there wont be one\n\nOn the graphics companys twitter page they say the front cover design and the track on the back is by them.\n\nThis is the answer the graphics company on twitter gave me .\n\neverything regarding the design is original but designed to resemble what they did, so we'll take this as a compliment!.\n\nI am guessing there wont be a lawsuit as it is an original design . I find most people in the film industry know what they are doing when it comes to that type of stuff .the person that owns the graphics company that did the cover art is movie producer .\n\nThis really was genuinely painful to write, and if it doesn't actually appear terrible I'm counting it as a win.\n\nDon’t be too hard on yourself.\n\nA lesser sim racing journalist upon peering into the sim racing news barrel, only to find this turd languishing at the bottom, would have put the lid back on in the hope it would decompose and disappear of it’s own accord while trusting that nobody would notice the distinct lack of new content on the front page.\n\nBut not you. Through your single-minded devotion to your cause you unwaveringly grasped this steaming pile of dog excrement with both hands and took it under your care. Driven by your journalistic integrity, your bond of duty, and in the full knowledge that you would be barred from the Pulitzer for life (and possibly GTP as well), you gritted your teeth, took pen to paper, and exposed this utter travesty for all to see.\n\nI therefore take this opportunity to doff my cap at thee.\n\nThey’re using the Gran Turismo name and logo on the album cover and profiting from the music. That absolutely would be copyright infringement.\n\nThat's just what I think. Of course, the words \"Gran Turismo\" aren't copyrighted, but this design uses plain copies of GT logos with obvious goal to look like it is officially connected to the game and to make people interested in the record. Not cool.\n\nAnd being sued or not probably won't matter to these guys - they already made themselves visible and that's what matters."
