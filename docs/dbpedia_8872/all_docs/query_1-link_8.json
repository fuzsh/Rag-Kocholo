        "text": "American rapper (born 1982)\n\n\"Dwayne Carter\" redirects here. For the racecar driver, see Duane Carter.\n\n\"Weezy\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Wheezy.\n\nDwayne Michael Carter Jr. (born September 27, 1982),[2] known professionally as Lil Wayne, is an American rapper. He is regarded as one of the most influential hip hop artists of his generation,[3] and one of the greatest rappers of all time.[4][5] Born and raised in New Orleans, he was discovered by hometown rapper Birdman in 1993, signing to the latter's record label, Cash Money Records, at the age of eleven.[6][7] He emerged as the flagship artist of the label in the following years until his departure in June 2018.[8]\n\nHe was first placed in a duo with Cash Money labelmate B.G. in 1994—known as the B.G.'z—and they released an album, True Story, in July of that year, although Carter (at the time known as Baby D) only appeared on three tracks.[9] Carter and B.G. then formed the Southern hip hop group Hot Boys with labelmates Juvenile and Turk in 1997; they released their debut album, Get It How U Live! in October of that year. The Hot Boys gained mainstream success following the release of their second album Guerrilla Warfare (1999), as well as their hit single, \"Bling Bling\".[10] The group briefly disbanded after the album due to each member (besides Carter) parting ways with the label, although one further album—Let 'Em Burn (2003)—was released.[11]\n\nCarter's debut studio album, Tha Block Is Hot (1999) quickly achieved commercial success and served as his breakthrough as a solo act, followed by Lights Out (2000) and 500 Degreez (2003). He reached wider popularity and critical acclaim with his fourth and fifth albums Tha Carter (2004) and Tha Carter II (2005), as well as several mixtapes and collaborations throughout 2006 and 2007. He propelled to the forefront of hip hop with his sixth album Tha Carter III (2008), with first-week sales of over one million units in the U.S. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and was supported by his first Billboard Hot 100-number one single \"Lollipop\" (featuring Static Major), the top-ten singles \"A Milli\" and \"Got Money\" (featuring T-Pain), and the top-20 single \"Mrs. Officer\" (featuring Bobby V and Kidd Kidd).\n\nCarter's seventh studio album, Rebirth (2010) experimented with rap rock and was released in February of that year to generally negative critical response. A month later in March, he began serving an 8-month jail sentence for criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007. His eighth album, I Am Not a Human Being (2010) was released during his incarceration, while his ninth album, Tha Carter IV (2011) was released some months after his release from prison. Tha Carter IV sold 964,000 units in its first-week in the United States despite mixed reviews.[12] His twelfth studio album, Tha Carter V (2018)—preceded by I Am Not a Human Being II (2013) and Free Weezy Album (2015)—was released following long-term delays and label disputes, and was met with 480,000 in first-week sales. His thirteenth album, Funeral (2020) became his fifth non-consecutive number one album.[13]\n\nCarter has sold over 120 million records worldwide, including more than 25 million albums and 92 million digital tracks in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists.[14][15][16] He has won five Grammy Awards, eleven BET Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards and eight NAACP Image Awards. On September 27, 2012, he became the first male artist to surpass Elvis Presley with the most entries on the Billboard Hot 100, with 109 songs.[17][18] Carter founded the record label Young Money Entertainment in 2005, which has signed artists including Drake, Tyga and Nicki Minaj.\n\nEarly life\n\nDwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and spent his first few years in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana's 17th Ward.[19] His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was two and his father permanently abandoned the family. When CBS interviewer Katie Couric asked why he used the name Wayne instead of his given name, Carter explained that \"I dropped the D because I'm a junior and my father is living and he's not in my life and he's never been in my life. So I don't want to be Dwayne, I'd rather be Wayne\". Asked if his father knew of this, Carter replied, \"He knows now\".[20] Carter has said that he considers his deceased stepfather Reginald \"Rabbit\" McDonald to be his real father. Carter has a tattoo dedicated to McDonald.[21]\n\nCarter was enrolled in the gifted program at Lafayette Elementary School. He later attended Eleanor McMain Secondary School for two years, where he was an honor student and a member of the drama club, playing the Tin Man in the school's production of The Wiz.[22][23][24] After matriculating to Marion Abramson Senior High School, Carter dropped out at age 14 to focus on his musical career.[25]\n\nCarter wrote his first rap song at age eight.[26] In the summer of 1991, he met rapper and Cash Money Records co-founder Bryan \"Baby\" Williams (known currently as Birdman), who mentored him and encouraged his love of hip-hop; Birdman included Carter on several Cash Money tracks, and Carter would often record freestyle raps on Williams' answering machine.[27]\n\nIn 1994, at age 12, Carter suffered a near-fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.[28] At the time he said the injury was accidental. Decades later Carter claimed that it was an attempted suicide after he was told by his mother that he would have to end his rap-related associations.[29] Carter credits off-duty police officer Robert Hoobler, who he calls \"Uncle Bob\", with saving his life by insisting the dying child be driven immediately to hospital in a police car rather than waiting for an ambulance to become available.[30] Other accounts indicate that several officers played a part in deciding on and implementing that course of action.[28]\n\nCareer\n\n1997–1999: Career beginnings and Hot Boys\n\nIn 1997, Carter joined the Hot Boys along with rappers Juvenile, B.G., and Turk. At age 14, Carter was the youngest member at the time. Hot Boys' debut album Get It How U Live! was released the same year, followed in 1999 by the group's major-label debut Guerrilla Warfare,[19] which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 5 on the Billboard 200.[31] During their career, the Hot Boys had two charting singles, \"We on Fire\" from Get It How U Live! and \"I Need a Hot Girl\" from Guerrilla Warfare.[32] Carter was also featured on Juvenile's single \"Back That Azz Up\", which reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks.[33] Let 'Em Burn, a compilation album of unreleased tracks recorded during 1999 and 2000, came out in 2003, several years after the group disbanded.[34] It reached No. 3 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 14 on the Billboard 200.[31]\n\n1999–2004: Tha Block Is Hot, Lights Out, and 500 Degreez\n\nCarter's debut solo album, Tha Block Is Hot, was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA less than two months after its release.[35][19] The album earned Carter a 1999 Source magazine nomination for \"Best New Artist\",[36] and also became a Top Ten hit.[19] The lead single was \"Tha Block Is Hot\". After the release of Tha Block Is Hot, Carter was featured on the single \"Bling Bling\", with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. Carter's verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus.\n\nHis second album, Lights Out, was released in 2000, and failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut[19] but was certified gold by RIAA.[37] Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys.[38] The lead single was \"Get Off the Corner\", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was \"Shine\" featuring the Hot Boys. Near the release of Lights Out, Carter was featured on the single, \"Number One Stunna\" with Big Tymers and Juvenile, which peaked at number 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.\n\nCarter's third album, 500 Degreez, was released in 2002. It followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. While being certified gold like its predecessor,[37] it also failed to match the success of his debut.[19] The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez.[39][40] Lead single was \"Way of Life\" reached no. 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 and no. 23 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.[41] However, John Bush of allmusic praised 500 Degreez, calling \"Way of Life\" an \"infectious party hit\".[39] After the release of 500 Degreez, Carter was featured on the single \"Neva Get Enuf\" by 3LW.[42]\n\n2004–2006: Tha Carter, Tha Carter II, and Like Father, Like Son\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Carter's fourth studio album, Tha Carter, was released, marking what critics considered advancement in his rapping style and lyrical themes.[43] In addition, the album's cover art featured the debut of Wayne's now-signature dreadlocks.[19] Tha Carter gained Wayne significant recognition, selling 878,000 copies in the United States, while the single \"Go DJ\" became a Top 5 Hit on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart.[44] After the release of Tha Carter, Lil Wayne was featured in Destiny's Child's single \"Soldier\" with T.I., which peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.[45]\n\nTha Carter II, the follow-up to the original Tha Carter album, was released in December 2005, this time without production by longtime Cash Money Records producer Mannie Fresh, who had left the label. Tha Carter II sold more than 238,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and went on to sell 2,000,000 copies worldwide. The lead single \"Fireman\" became a hit in the U.S., peaking at 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Other singles included \"Grown Man\" with Currensy, \"Hustler Musik\", and \"Shooter\" with R&B singer Robin Thicke. Carter also appeared on a remix of Bobby Valentino's \"Tell Me\", which rose to number 13 on the U.S. R&B Charts. In 2005, Carter was named president of Cash Money, and in the same year he founded Young Money Entertainment as an imprint of Cash Money.[46] However, as of late 2007, Carter reported having stepped down from the management of both labels and had handed management of Young Money over to Cortez Bryant.[47]\n\nIn 2006, Carter collaborated with Birdman for the album Like Father, Like Son, whose first single \"Stuntin' Like My Daddy\", reached number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n2006–2007: Mixtapes and collaborations\n\nInstead of a follow-up solo album, Carter began to reach his audience through a plethora of mixtapes and guest appearances on a variety of pop and hip hop singles.[19] Of his many mixtapes, Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3 received the most media exposure and critical review. Dedication 2, released in 2006, paired Carter with DJ Drama and contained the acclaimed socially conscious track \"Georgia Bush\", in which Carter critiqued former U.S. president George W. Bush's response to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the city of New Orleans. Da Drought 3 was released the following year and was available for free legal download. It contained Carter rapping over a variety of beats from recent hits by other musicians. A number of prominent hip hop magazines such as XXL[48] and Vibe[25] covered the mixtape. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone magazine considered the mixtapes Da Drought 3 and The Drought Is Over 2 (The Carter 3 Sessions) \"among the best albums of 2007\".[49]\n\nDespite no album release for two years, Carter appeared in numerous singles as a featured performer, including \"Gimme That\" by Chris Brown, \"Make It Rain\" by Fat Joe, \"You\" by Lloyd, and \"We Takin' Over\" by DJ Khaled (also featuring Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, and Birdman), \"Duffle Bag Boy\" by Playaz Circle, \"Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill)\" by Wyclef Jean (also featuring Akon), and the remix to \"I'm So Hood\" by DJ Khaled (also featuring T-Pain, Young Jeezy, Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, Big Boi, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Rick Ross). All these singles charted within the top 20 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Rap Tracks, and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. On Birdman's 2007 album, 5 * Stunna, Carter appeared on the singles \"100 Million\" and \"I Run This\" among several other tracks. Carter also appeared on tracks from albums Getback by Little Brother, American Gangster by Jay-Z, and Graduation by Kanye West and Insomniac by Enrique Iglesias. \"Make it Rain\", a Scott Storch production that peaked at number 13 on the Hot 100 and number two on the Hot Rap Tracks chart,[50] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for 2008.[51]\n\nVibe magazine ranked a list of 77 of Lil Wayne's songs from 2007 and ranked his verse in DJ Khaled's \"We Takin Over\" as his best of 2007, with \"Dough Is What I Got\" (a freestyle over the beat of Jay-Z's \"Show Me What You Got\") from Da Drought 3.[25] At the end of 2007, an MTV poll selected Lil Wayne as \"Hottest MC in the Game\",[52] The New Yorker magazine ranked him \"Rapper of the Year\",[27] and GQ magazine named him \"Workaholic of the Year\".[53] In 2008 he was named \"Best MC\" by Rolling Stone.[49] Another article, built around Lil Wayne's 2007 mixtape work, cites his creative practice as an example of post-performance creative practice.[54]\n\n2007–2010: Tha Carter III, We Are Young Money, and Rebirth\n\nIn 2007, Carter stated that he would reunite with Hot Boys, with plans to release an album after B.G.'s solo album Too Hood to Be Hollywood was completed.[55] Tha Carter III was originally scheduled to be released in 2007, but it was delayed after several recordings were leaked and distributed through mixtapes, including The Drought Is Over Pt. 2 and The Drought Is Over Pt. 4. Lil Wayne initially planned to release The Leak, a separate album with leaked songs and four additional tracks, on December 18, 2007, with Tha Carter III delayed to March 18, 2008.[56] Instead, The Leak became an EP with five songs and was released digitally on December 25, 2007.[57]\n\nTha Carter III was released on June 10, 2008, with first-week sales of over 1 million copies, the first to do so since 50 Cent's The Massacre (2005).[58] The album's first single \"Lollipop\", featuring Static Major, became the Carter's most successful song at the time, topping the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming his first top 10 single as a solo artist and his first number one on the chart. The third single \"Got Money\", featuring T-Pain, peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 100. Tha Carter III went on to win four Grammy Awards, including best rap album and best rap song, which he won for \"Lollipop\".[59] On July 14, 2008, the Recording Industry Association of America certified Tha Carter III two times platinum.[60] In October 2008, Lil Wayne announced plans to MTV News to re-release the album with new tracks, including a duet with Ludacris and remixes of \"A Milli\".[61]\n\nCarter also appeared on R&B singles \"Girls Around the World\" by Lloyd, \"Love in This Club, Part II\" by Usher, \"Official Girl\" by Cassie, \"I'm So Paid\" by Akon, \"Turnin' Me On\" by Keri Hilson, and \"Can't Believe It\" by T-Pain; rap singles \"My Life\" by The Game, \"Shawty Say\" by David Banner, \"Swagga Like Us\" by T.I., \"Cutty Buddy\" by Mike Jones, All My Life (In the Ghetto) by Jay Rock and the remix to \"Certified\" by Glasses Malone; and pop single \"Let It Rock\" by new Cash Money artist Kevin Rudolf.\n\nIn 2008, Carter performed at the Voodoo Experience in October in New Orleans, which was described by Jonathan Cohen of Billboard as his biggest hometown headlining set of his career.[62] He also performed at the Virgin Mobile Music Fest with Kanye West, where they performed the remix of \"Lollipop\" and lip-synced to Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\".[63] Lil Wayne also performed at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards with Kid Rock (\"All Summer Long\"), Leona Lewis (\"DontGetIt (Misunderstood)\") and T-Pain (\"Got Money\") and performed \"Lollipop\" and \"Got Money\" on the season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[64] He later performed at the homecoming rally at Vanderbilt University[65] and the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards, where he received 12 nominations.[66] He won eight awards at the BET Hip Hop Awards, one of which included the \"MVP\" title.[67][68] After M.I.A. dropped out of performing on the I Am Music Tour due to her pregnancy, Jay-Z performed \"Mr. Carter\" with Lil Wayne at select shows.[69]\n\nAfter Tha Carter III sold over 3 million copies and became the best-selling record of 2008, Carter re-signed with Cash Money Records for a multi-album deal.[70] On November 11, 2008, Carter became the first hip hop act to perform at the Country Music Association Awards, playing \"All Summer Long\" alongside Kid Rock, in which Carter inaudibly strummed guitar strings alongside the guitarist in Kid Rock's band.[71] Shortly after, Wayne was nominated for eight Grammys – the most for any artist nominated that year.[72] He was then named the first MTV Man of the Year at the end of 2008.[73] He won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for \"A Milli\", Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for his appearance in T.I.'s single \"Swagga Like Us\", and Best Rap Song for \"Lollipop\". Tha Carter III won the award for Best Rap Album.[59] MTV News listed Carter number two on their 2009 list of the Hottest MCs in the Game.[74]\n\nPrior to the 2009 Grammy Awards, Wayne was featured in an interview with Katie Couric.[75] On February 7, 2009, he presented the Top Ten List on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman.[76] On April 24, 2009, he appeared on The View, discussing his GED and addictions.[77] In September 2009, Carter was profiled in an episode of VH1's Behind the Music[78] and was a presenter of the 2009 MTV Movie Awards.[79] In film, Carter produced and composed music for and starred in the direct-to-video film Hurricane Season. A documentary of Carter, titled The Carter, was released at the Sundance Film Festival.[80]\n\nOn December 23, 2009, Carter released a collaboration album with Young Money, We Are Young Money, with its lead single being \"Every Girl\".[81] The second single was \"BedRock\", featuring Lloyd, with the third being \"Roger That\". On May 24, 2010, the album was certified gold by the RIAA with over 500,000 copies sold.[82] Carter is featured on the song, \"Revolver\", with Madonna for her greatest hits album, Celebration (2009). He was also featured on a Weezer song, \"Can't Stop Partying\", on Raditude (2009).[83] In late 2008, Carter announced plans to reissue Tha Carter III with leftover recordings, and was to be titled Rebirth, originally scheduled to be released on April 7, 2009, before being delayed several times.[84] Rebirth instead became his sixth solo album, released on February 2, 2010.\n\nTo support its release and that of We Are Young Money, Carter was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone[85] and headlined the 'Young Money Presents: America's Most Wanted Music Festival', a United States and Canada–only concert tour which began on July 29, 2009. \"Prom Queen\", the first official single, debuted on January 27, 2009, immediately after a live Internet broadcast on Ustream[86] of his concert in San Diego.[87] It peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. On December 3, 2009, the second single, \"On Fire\", produced by Cool & Dre[88] \"On Fire\" peaked at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. \"Drop the World\", which features Eminem, was the third single from the Rebirth.[88]\n\n2010–2013: I Am Not a Human Being series and Tha Carter IV\n\nIn an interview on MTV's Mixtape Monday, Carter hinted at the release of Tha Carter IV.[89] He later announced that it would be released in late 2009 before the holiday season.[90] Birdman had previously stated that Tha Carter IV would be packaged with Rebirth as a double disc album.[91] Carter denied this, saying that \"Tha Carter IV deserves Tha Carter IV\", adding that We Are Young Money may be packaged with Rebirth.[92][93] These albums were eventually released separately.[citation needed]\n\nIn June 2010, Lil Wayne appeared on two tracks to Kevin Rudolf's album, To the Sky.

In May 2013, he confirmed the album will still be released.[170][171][172]\n\nCarter's once ongoing litigation with Cash Money prevented numerous completed projects from being released.

His first child, daughter Reginae, was born November 29, 1998, when he was 16,[209] to his high school sweetheart Toya Johnson. They later married on Valentine's Day 2004 and divorced in January 2006.[210] Internet rumors circulated in August 2008 that Carter's daughter had died in an auto accident; he immediately dispelled them.[211]\n\nHis second child, Dwayne III, was born on October 22, 2008, at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati[212] to radio broadcaster Sarah Vivan.[213][214] His third child, Cameron,[215] was born to actress Lauren London on September 9, 2009.[216] His fourth child, Neal, was born on November 30, 2009, to singer Nivea.[217]\n\nIn July 2014, it was rumored that Carter was dating singer Christina Milian, with whom he attended the ESPY Awards.[218] They later confirmed their relationship in mid-2015,[219] after which they received criticism from their interconnected exes, singer Nivea[220] and songwriter The-Dream.[221] They split in August 2015,[222][223] having collaborated on multiple singles, videos, and concert dates.\n\nWayne was engaged to model La'Tecia Thomas but called off the engagement in May 2020.[224]\n\nIn June 2020, it was announced that Wayne had started dating Denise Bidot, another model.[225] In November 2020, they reportedly broke up over Wayne's endorsement of Donald Trump.[226] Shortly after, it was reported that the couple had reconciled.[227][228][229][230] Wayne and Bidot later broke up again in January 2022.[231][232]\n\nBeliefs and interests\n\nIn an interview with Blender, Carter revealed one of his favorite bands from childhood to be rock group Nirvana, and cites them as a major influence in his music.[233]\n\nCarter got his first tattoo at age 14 of his dad's name and his second was \"Cash Money\" across his stomach.[234] His tattoos have grown to include a Jay-Z verse on his leg, \"I Am Music\" on his forehead and teardrops on his cheeks among many others. His most recent one is \"Baked\" on his forehead stylized as the Baker Skateboards logo.[235][236][237]\n\nCarter identifies as a Catholic.[238][239][240] While playing in Newark Symphony Hall, Carter professed his belief \"in God and His son, Jesus\".[236] During his 2011 tour in Australia with Eminem, before beginning his bracket he proclaimed his belief in God.[241]\n\nAfter earning his GED, Carter enrolled at the University of Houston in January 2005. He dropped out in the same year due to his conflicting schedule.[242][243] He also revealed on The View that he switched to the University of Phoenix and majored in psychology taking online courses.[77] An article in Urb magazine in March 2007 asserted that Carter had been earning high grades at Houston.[244]\n\nCarter received criticism after a video released by TMZ showed him apparently stepping on the U.S. flag. Carter later explained that \"It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States\", and that he was shooting a video for a song on his upcoming album, \"God Bless Amerika\". He says the purpose of the flag was to show that \"behind the American Flag was the Hoods of America\".[245]\n\nIn late 2016, Carter made statements critical of the Black Lives Matter movement, saying, \"I don't feel connected to a damn thing that ain't got nothin' to do with me. If you do, you crazy as shit,\" adding that his status as a wealthy black man who has white fans is evidence that black people are valued in the United States.[246]\n\nIn 2016, Carter purchased Player's Rep. Sports Agency, and became Young Money APAA sports, which hired NFL's first female sports agent, Nicole Lynn. She currently represents Seth Roberts, Corey Nelson, Jordan Evans, Malik Jefferson, Erik Harris, Quinnen Williams, as well as NCAA coaches, and two former No. 1 Pro Softball draft picks.[247]\n\nOn October 29, 2020, less than a week before the presidential election, Carter posted an image of him and President Donald Trump to Twitter. In the caption for the photo, Carter revealed that he and Trump had recently met to discuss criminal justice reform and Trump's Platinum Plan, an initiative which aims to raise access to capital in Black communities by almost $500 billion. Carter claimed Trump \"listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done\".[248]\n\nHealth problems\n\nOn October 25, 2012, Carter's private jet, bound for Los Angeles, made an emergency landing in Texas due to an in-flight medical episode. Lil Wayne was transferred to a local hospital upon arrival.[249] TMZ and other media sources said that Carter had suffered a seizure aboard the plane.[250] His publicist denied this, saying that he was in fact treated for \"a severe migraine and dehydration\".[251]\n\nThe following day, while flying from Texas to Los Angeles, Carter's private jet was reportedly again forced to make an emergency landing, this time in Louisiana, after he suffered a second seizure and required further hospitalization.[251][252] His representative said that the reports of Carter's condition had been exaggerated, and that he was resting at his Louisiana home.[253] In a November 2012 interview with MTV, Carter revealed that he was taking seizure medication, on doctors' orders, due to the aforementioned incidents.[254]\n\nOn March 14, 2013, TMZ reported that Carter had been treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on the evening of March 12, after having seizures while on a music video set with Young Money rapper Nicki Minaj. He was reportedly released in the early hours of March 13.[255] On March 15, TMZ published a second story, claiming that hours after his release on March 13, Carter was found unconscious after experiencing further seizures, and was brought back to Cedars-Sinai, where he was admitted to the intensive care unit in critical condition.[256][257][258] The article alleged the latest seizures were found to be linked to high amounts of codeine in Carter's system, possibly due to bingeing on purple drank after his initial hospital release.[257][259][260] Multiple celebrities, including Drake and Birdman, were photographed on March 15 and 16 visiting Carter at Cedars-Sinai.[259]\n\nSeveral members of Young Money Entertainment, including president Mack Maine, criticized media reports on Carter's hospitalization, particularly those of TMZ, alleging that they exaggerated the severity of his condition and falsely implied that he was on his deathbed (such as by saying that he was in a medically induced coma),[261] triggering what the Washington Post called \"the most overheated celebrity deathwatch in recent years\".[262] In separate interviews on March 18, Mack Maine and Birdman disputed TMZ's reports, and stated that in fact there were not multiple seizures or multiple hospital visits. They explained that after Carter began seizing on the way to the music video shoot on March 12, an ambulance was called and he was transported to the hospital, where he was admitted and remained continuously thereafter.[263] They also refuted the claims that Carter's seizures are drug-induced, saying that they are an ongoing problem for which doctors have been unable to identify a cause.[264]\n\nCarter was released from the hospital late on March 18, following a six-day stay.[265] Lil Wayne addressed his condition via a vlog, on March 21 saying he was more than good.[266]\n\nCarter had two seizures in June 2016, during a cross-country flight from Wisconsin to California, and landed in Omaha, Nebraska.[267] His plane was only two minutes in the air when the second seizure occurred, forcing the plane to land in Omaha once again. Less than a month later, he had another seizure, supposedly due to not taking his epilepsy medication.[268]\n\nCarter canceled a Las Vegas show on September 3, 2017, having had a seizure in a Chicago hospital earlier that day, where he was brought after being found unconscious in a hotel room.[269]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nOn February 19, 2008, Carter and Cortez Bryant revisited their alma mater McMain Secondary School to get students to design an invitation to the gala introducing Carter's nonprofit One Family Foundation.[270]\n\nOther ventures\n\nYoung Money Entertainment\n\nMain article: Young Money Entertainment\n\nBooks\n\nCarter wrote a memoir of his experience in Rikers Island called Gone Til' November: A Journal of Rikers Island that was released October 11, 2016.[271]\n\nCannabis industry\n\nIn December 2019, Carter announced his own cannabis brand under the name of GKUA Ultra Premium.[272]\n\nSports media\n\nOn September 24, 2008, Carter published his first blog for ESPN in their issue, ESPN The Magazine. Carter revealed he was a fan of tennis, the Green Bay Packers, the Boston Bruins, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Red Sox. To commemorate the Packers' making it to Super Bowl XLV, he spoofed Wiz Khalifa's hit song \"Black and Yellow\" (which were the colors of the Packers' opponents, the Pittsburgh Steelers) in a song titled \"Green and Yellow\".[273] He released a second version of the song in 2021, which was requested by the Packers, and updated with the current roster.[274] Carter has continued writing for ESPN, notably reporting at the ESPN Super Bowl party.[275]\n\nOn January 6, 2009, Carter was a guest debater against Skip Bayless on the \"1st & 10\" segment of ESPN First Take.[276] On February 10, 2009, he appeared on ESPN's Around the Horn and beat out veterans Woody Paige, Jay Mariotti and fellow New Orleanian Michael Smith to win that show's episode.[277]\n\nCarter made his debut on ESPN's daily sports round table show Around The Horn on February 10, 2009.[278] Carter created the intro song \"No Mercy\" for the Fox Sports 1 sports debate show Undisputed. After Shannon Sharpe's departure from the show, Carter created a no theme song for Undisputed titled \"Good Morning\".[279] Carter also joined the series as a regular guest opposite Bayless.[280]\n\nLegal issues\n\nArrests, incarceration, and presidential pardon\n\nOn July 22, 2007, Carter was arrested in New York City following a performance at the Beacon Theatre; the New York City Police Department discovered Carter and another man smoking marijuana near a tour bus. After taking Carter into custody, police discovered a .40 caliber pistol near his person. The gun, which was registered to his manager, was in a bag located near the rapper.[281] He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon and marijuana.[282][283]\n\nFollowing a performance at Qwest Arena in Boise, Idaho, Carter was arrested October 5, 2007, on felony fugitive charges after Georgia authorities accused the rapper of possessing a controlled substance.[284] The incident was later described as a \"mix-up\" and the fugitive charges were dropped.[285]\n\nOn January 23, 2008, Carter was arrested alongside two others. His tour bus was stopped by Border Patrol agents near Yuma, Arizona. A K-9 Unit recovered 105 grams (3.7 oz) of marijuana, almost 29 grams (1.0 oz) of cocaine, 41 grams (1.4 oz) of ecstasy, and $22,000 in cash. Carter was charged with four felonies: possession of narcotic drug for sale, possession of dangerous drugs, misconduct involving weapons and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was granted permission to travel outside of the state and remain out of custody on the $10,185 bond he posted.[286]\n\nOn May 6, 2008, Carter returned to court in Arizona to plead not guilty to the charges.[287] A bench warrant was issued on March 17, 2010, when Carter did not show for a final trial management conference.[288][289] However, he was already incarcerated, serving a one-year sentence on Rikers Island on weapons charges. On June 22, 2010, Carter pleaded guilty to the charges. As part of the plea deal he was able to serve 36 months of probation, which he was sentenced to on June 30, 2010.[290][291]\n\nOn December 18, 2009, Carter and 11 others were detained at the Falfurrias, Texas, border patrol checkpoint after an unknown amount of marijuana was found on two of his tour buses.[292]\n\nOn October 22, 2009, Carter pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon. He was due for sentencing in February 2010 and was expected to receive a one-year county jail sentence,[293] but on February 9, 2010, Carter's attorney announced that the sentencing was delayed until March 2 due to dental surgery,[294] which was performed on February 16. The surgery included eight root canals, the replacement of several tooth implants, as well as the addition of a few new implants and work on his remaining original teeth.[295] On March 2, 2010, sentencing was postponed again when the courthouse reported a fire in the basement.[296]\n\nOn March 8, 2010, Carter was given a one-year sentence, which he served on Rikers Island. His lawyer said the rapper expected to be held in protective custody, separated from other prisoners.[297] In May 2010, Carter was found by Rikers Island correctional staff to be in possession of contraband (an MP3 player, charger, and headphones).[298] In April 2010, Carter's friends created a website called Weezy Thanx You, which published letters written by Carter while incarcerated.[237][299] In the first letter, titled \"Gone 'til November\", Carter said he was staying in good spirits thinking about his children and spending his time working out regularly and reading the Bible every day.[237] Carter was released from Rikers Island Jail on November 4, 2010, after serving eight months of his year-long sentence.[300]\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Carter pleaded guilty to a federal firearms charge brought against him by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. This plea stemmed from an incident during December of the previous year, when Carter was arrested in Florida after transporting a loaded handgun on his private jet from California. As a convicted felon, he is barred from possessing such weapons.[301] He was pardoned by U.S. President Donald Trump on January 19, 2021, his last full day in office.[302]\n\nLawsuits\n\nOn July 24, 2008, Abkco Music filed a lawsuit against Carter for copyright infringement and unfair competition, specifically referring to Tha Carter III's track \"Playing with Fire\".[303] In the lawsuit, Abkco says that the song was obviously derived from the Rolling Stones' \"Play with Fire\", to which Abkco owns the rights.[303][304] Subsequently, \"Playing with Fire\" was removed from the track list of Tha Carter III on all online music stores and replaced with the David Banner produced track, \"Pussy Monster\".[305]\n\nIn February 2009, production company RMF Productions filed a $1.3 million lawsuit against Carter following a $100,000 advance payment for three shows, all of which were cancelled by the artist.[306]\n\nIn October 2009, Carter, Birdman, Cash Money Records, and various music distribution outlets were sued for copyright infringement by Thomas Marasciullo, who says his voice was used without permission. The rappers asked him to record some \"Italian-styled spoken word recordings\" in 2006. The lyrics were allegedly used on \"Respect\" and other tracks from the rappers' collaboration album Like Father, Like Son and Birdman's 5 * Stunna.[307]\n\nIn March 2011, producer Deezle (Darius Harrison) sued Carter and his parent labels Cash Money Records over unpaid royalties from Tha Carter III.[308] Two months later, that May, producer Bangladesh also filed a lawsuit against Wayne over unpaid royalties as well.[309]\n\nIn early June 2011, another producer named David Kirkwood filed a lawsuit against Young Money Entertainment and Cash Money Records on claims that the labels have failed to pay him over $1.5 million in royalties and production services for his work on the album, also including his songwriting on \"Love Me or Hate Me\", a bonus song featured only on the deluxe edition of the album.[310]\n\nAlso in June 2011, Dallas producers Play-N-Skillz filed a lawsuit against him, saying Carter owes them at least $1 million in unpaid royalties for \"Got Money\" from his album Tha Carter III. The single has sold over 2 million copies since being released.[311]\n\nIn July 2011, Done Deal Enterprises, a production company based in Georgia, filed suit against Carter, Universal Music Group, Cash Money Records and Young Money Entertainment, claiming copyright infringement. The lawsuit alleges Carter stole the song \"BedRock\", featured on the compilation album We Are Young Money, and seeks damages of $15 million.[312]\n\nIn November 2012, Wayne was ordered to pay Quincy Jones III $2.2 million based on a lawsuit which stated that the rapper blocked the release of Jones's film The Carter, therefore infringing on its profits.[313]\n\nFeuds\n\nJuvenile\n\nCarter began feuding with former Hot Boys member and Cash Money Records labelmate Juvenile in 2002, after Juvenile took offense to Carter naming his third studio album 500 Degreez, a diss aimed towards Juvenile whose last album was named 400 Degreez.[citation needed] Juvenile responded with a diss track on his 2002 album 600 Degreez, titled \"A Hoe\". In the song, Juvenile questions Carter's sexuality, and says he's a fake gangster. The two squashed their beef for a short period in 2004, with Carter and Birdman appearing in the music video for Juvenile and Soulja Slim's song, Slow Motion. Carter later paid tribute to the Hot Boys with a song called \"I Miss My Dawgs\" on 2004's Tha Carter. Juvenile responded by calling the song \"fake\", and criticized Carter for releasing a tribute song and later promoting the album on BET and having \"nothing good to say about them\". The two eventually reconciled once again, and Juvenile re-signed with Cash Money Records in 2014.[314][315]\n\nYoung Buck\n\nYoung Buck released a song called \"Off Parole\", featuring Tony Yayo, which insulted Carter. Young Buck said that Carter could not be angry, because Young Buck spoke the truth. Young Buck also said \"You think you got a problem with Juve and B.G.; you'll have a true problem with me\", referring to the Cash Money-Juvenile/B.G feud.[316][317] One of the reasons 50 Cent stated he was dismissing Young Buck was what he called \"inconsistent behavior\" which included appearing on stage with Carter, then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit.[318] After he was dismissed, Young Buck appeared in the music video \"My Life\" by The Game, which featured Carter in the vocals.[319] As of 2009, Young Buck and Carter have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track \"Up's and Down's\" for Young Buck's Back on My Buck Shit mixtape.\n\nPusha T\n\nTension between Wayne and American rapper, Pusha T, had been going on for years, beginning soon after Clipse and Birdman worked on \"What Happened to That Boy\", the latter's 2002 single. In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song \"Mr. Me Too\" was directed at him which caused more tension between the two.[320] In 2012, after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Wayne's Young Money signee Drake in several songs, the speculation heightened after the release of Pusha T's \"Exodus 23:1\" song. Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service Twitter and later released a diss track titled \"Goulish\". In the first verse, Wayne raps \"Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him / His head up his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him\".[321] Pusha T called Wayne's diss track \"horrible\" and said he felt it did not deserve a response. Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he's over it.[322][323] However, in November 2012, Pusha T dissed Wayne and Birdman on a new Ludacris song titled \"Tell Me What They Mad For\".[324] However, once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose, Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to G.O.O.D. Music, which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit.[325][non-primary source needed]\n\nJay-Z\n\nIn a 2009 interview with Tropical TV, Birdman disputed the MTV poll that voted Jay-Z \"The Hottest MC in the Game\", stating that Lil Wayne was a better rapper and made more money.[326] In early 2011, when Jay-Z and Kanye West's single \"H•A•M\" was released, Jay-Z took shots at Birdman, saying \"Really, you got Baby money\" and \"[you] ain't got my lady's money!\".[327] On August 24, 2011, a song called \"It's Good\" by Lil Wayne (featuring Drake and Jadakiss) was leaked online and included Lil Wayne responding \"Talkin' 'bout baby money? I gotcha baby money. Kidnap your bitch, get that, How much you love your lady? money\".[328][329] Jadakiss later absolved himself of involvement in any brewing beef on his official Twitter feed.[330][331]\n\nDiscography\n\nSee also: Hot Boys discography and Young Money discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nTha Block Is Hot (1999)\n\nLights Out (2000)\n\n500 Degreez (2002)\n\nTha Carter (2004)\n\nTha Carter II (2005)\n\nTha Carter III (2008)\n\nRebirth (2010)\n\nI Am Not a Human Being (2010)\n\nTha Carter IV (2011)\n\nI Am Not a Human Being II (2013)\n\nFree Weezy Album (2015)\n\nTha Carter V (2018)\n\nFuneral (2020)\n\nTha Carter VI (TBA)\n\nI Am Not a Human Being III (TBA)\n\nCollaborative albums\n\nLike Father, Like Son (with Birdman) (2006)\n\nWelcome 2 Collegrove (with 2 Chainz) (2023)[332]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Film Role Notes 2000 Baller Blockin' Iceberg Shorty 2007 Who's Your Caddy?
