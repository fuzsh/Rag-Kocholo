        "text": "Curren$y has managed to drop 5 projects within the last year, and even with all that recording, he's put together a tour to bring all his new music to fans live. Today, the rapper has shared the full schedule for his upcoming Cruis'n USA tour, which kicks off this Thursday, May 5th in Cleveland, OH. He'll be touching down in 30 different cities between then and June 26th, when he warps it all up in Seattle.\n\nSomehow, we feel like the Jet Life rapper will continue to put out new music even as he makes his way across the country, but even if he takes a short break, we know that we have more than enough music to tide us over for the meantime.\n\nView all of the dates below."
