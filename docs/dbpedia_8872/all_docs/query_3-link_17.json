        "text": "Curren$y has teased new music with two of his most frequent collaborators. Speaking with AZWayTooActive in an interview shared on Wednesday (Jan. 10), the New Orleans native confirmed he has wrapped projects with both Wiz Khalifa and Larry June.\n\n“The other one [How Fly] is in my computer. Me and Wiz’s other album in my computer,” answered the Jet Life rapper after the 2009 mixtape of the same name was introduced into the conversation. “Me and Larry [June] got sh*t stacked up in the computer too.”\n\nHe continued to detail, “Everybody walked up, was like, ‘What’s up? You and Larry doing an album?’ I’m like, ‘Bro, it’s already done.’ ‘You and Wiz doing another album?’ That sh*t’s done.”\n\nThe two aforementioned collaborative efforts may not be the only tapes hopefully coming soon from the Pilot Talk performer. Curren$y continued to elaborate how he hopes to lock in with “Leimert Park legend” Dom Kennedy.\n\n“Right now, I’m just trying to find my brother Dom Kennedy,” he exclaimed. “That’s what I’ve been trying to do lately. I’m tweeting him daily saying, ‘Ni**a! Ni**a!’… So eventually, he’ll see them and we’ll get the work going.”\n\nCurren$y issued three collaborative efforts in 2023: For Motivational Use Only Vol. 1 with Jermaine Dupri, VICES with Harry Fraud, and Highway 600 with Trauma Tone."
