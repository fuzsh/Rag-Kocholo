        "text": "Although he already had a busy 2020, Curren$y is getting straight to work in 2021 as well. As he’s gearing up to release his upcoming Collection Agency project, he drops the first official single titled “Misty” along with a chill music video for fans to vibe out to. Curren$y starts off the song with a shoutout to one of his West Coast comrades:\n\nWatching the waves crash. Jamming to my patna Ohgeesy, he make them slaps. Over by my LA woman, she got the gas, exotic turkey bags. She fuck with me ’cause I dress good and I make her laugh./ She ain’t even know how good she had it until I smashed. I ain’t been gone five minutes, she wanna know if I’m coming back./ Trying to lure me in with pictures of her wearing something skimpy. But I won’t let her get me, only that money can tempt me./ Gotta be about them Benji’s, only millie’s worth my energy. While my bro keep his eyes peeled for the enemies.\n\nBack in July, Curren$y linked up with Harry Fraud to present The OutRunners, and they swiftly followed up with yet another joint project in September titled The Director’s Cut. The second offering included 9 new tracks with Harry Fraud production and features from Snoop Dogg, Trippie Redd, Styles P, and Larry June. Prior to this, the duo also dropped La Marina together back in 2018, which saw guest appearances from Smoke DZA, French Montana, Action Bronson, and Wiz Khalifa.\n\nIn an interview with REVOLT from earlier this year, Curren$y reflected on one of the studio sessions that wow’ed him the most:\n\nPharrell played me JAY-Z’s “Blue Magic.” I’m sitting there thinking, “Who does this dude think I am?” Clearly Pharrell is on mushrooms and he thinks I’m Malice or somebody. He just banged the s**t out in the studio in L.A. He was like, “Check this out.” I was with my skating homie Terry Kennedy. He’s in there with Nelly. Nelly was talking about some s**t that was in the parking lot, and I happened to have seen it too because I was with Lil Wayne and them at the time. Then, I don’t know, Pharrell must’ve thought, “This dude’s cool.”\n\nCheck out Curren$y’s new music video for “Misty” featuring G-Style down below."
