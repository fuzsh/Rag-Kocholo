        "text": "Upon arriving to Amos Southend I wasn’t surprised to see the lines extending around the corner and down the road a few hundred yards. He might not be a household name yet, but Charlotteans were no stranger to Big K.R.I.T. He’s performed in the Queen City at least 3 times in the past two years or so and has yet to let anyone down. Once inside, I managed to get some primetime “seating” at the center of the stage a few rows back. There were a number of local artists that opened – including The Koolest, Stranger Day, and Charlotte’s own Elevator Jay – with DJ Dexter Dynamite on the 1’s and 2’s. Next up was Two-9. Now, I don’t claim to know a lot about them but from what I gather, they’re a hip-hop collective from Atlanta, GA that is essentially a dirty south Wu-Tang Clan. I do, however, have the Danco James mixtape that Curtis Williams just dropped so I’m somewhat familiar with him. It seemed he was the lead artist of the group, as he donned a black leather jacket and some wild hair held back by a bandana – Jimi Hendrix-esque if you will. They played to a crowd who seemed to have a mixed reaction to their music but all in all it was pretty entertaining. I did have a chance to talk to Curtis a little after the show but unfortunately didn’t have time to get a photo – I told him that I wanted to hear “Shenanigans” from his latest tape and he was like “aww yeah” and then did the Metro Boomin tag “Metro Boomin want some more N*gga!”. Finally, after hours of anticipation, K.R.I.T. was set to perform. DJ Dibiase was set up at the DJ booth, whose front was now a Cadillac grille with dimly flashing purple lights. Some smoke filled the stage floor and out came Krizzle to “King Without A Crown”. All hell broke loose. The crowd was rapping word for word with K.R.I.T. and jumping up and down in unison with the beat. It felt like some kind of southern fried, soulful earthquake going on and I was in the center of it. K.R.I.T. played for close to an hour and half, doing songs from almost every project he’s dropped in the last 4 years in preparation for his upcoming album, Cadillactica that will be dropping on November 11th of this year. I got down the majority of the setlist and listed the projects they came from:\n\nKing Without a Crown (King Remembered In Time) Country Shit (K.R.I.T. Wuz Here) Talkin Bout Nothin (King Remembered In Time) Somethin Right (See Me On Top Vol. 4) New Agenda (See Me On Top Vol. 4) Lac Lac (Week of K.R.I.T.) Rotation (Return of 4Eva) Riding Dirty (See Me On Top Vol. 4) My Trunk (King Remembered In Time) Believe Me Freestyle (See Me On Top Vol. 4) My Sub (Return of 4Eva) Only One (King Remembered In Time) Temptation (4Eva N A Day) Pay Attention (Lead Single - Cadillactica) Mind F*ck (See Me On Top Vol. 4) Cool To Be Southern (Live From The Underground) rapped some UGK \"Sippin on Sizzurp\" Return of 4Eva w/ Big Sant (K.R.I.T. Wuz Here) Made Alot w/ Big Sant (Return of 4Eva) Pull Up w/ Big Sant (Live From The Underground) How U Luv That w/ Big Sant (King Remembered In Time) I Got This (Live From The Underground) Just Last Week (King Remembered In Time) R.E.M. (King Remembered In Time) The Vent (Return of 4Eva) Mt. Olympus (See Me On Top Vol. 4/Cadillactica) From the minute Krizzle stepped on stage and the music came on, you were immersed in the sound and the feel of it all – the beats, the lights, the energy – it was more of an experience than it was a concert. It truly was an amazing show and I would highly encourage anyone with the possibility of seeing it to do so.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nRapping over the juxtaposing sounds of mellow R&B vocals and crunked out yelling is no easy task. This is just one example of the type of musical environments Big K.R.I.T. can rap along to. He also does so with extreme proficiency and seemingly ease. It seems like nothing can rupture the flow of Big K.R.I.Ts rhymes. His tracks integrate chop and screwed hip hop, soul music, southern style rap and even spaced out ambient sounds. His lyrics are reflective and personally relevant to his background and also offer interesting social commentaries of life in lower class areas.\n\nHis ability of adaptation relates not only to his skill in assimilating rhymes to differing styles of music, it also applies to his skill in performing in various live settings. The success of his live performance is no hidden secret. His album \"Live From the Underground\" was met with great support by fans and critics alike. This album came out a little before his mesmerizing showcase at SXSW. This too has reached somewhat legendary status. The audience was in complete awe of this performance. Neon strobe lights and a large projector screen were flashing uncontrollably at this performance and music was blasting at overwhelming volumes. The lights matched nicely with the intensity of the show and the crowd was incredibly responsive to K.R.I.T.'s presentation. During some of the songs the crowd would constantly bob their hands back and forth, other songs they would start dancing freestyle.\n\nSome of Big K.R.I.T.'s smaller shows are actually even more enjoyable to go to. It is unbeatable to have a small venue like the Mercy Lounge packed to the brim with diehard fans. Everyone at that show seemed to be entirely engaged in the performance. Big K.R.I.T has such confidence and skill as a rapper that he can even shoot verses over a backing track coming out of laptop speakers. It doesn't seem to matter where you hear him. In any case it is going to be a solid performance.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
