        "text": "GQ: You got any complaints with hip-hop that you'd like to share?\n\nCurren$y: I don't like what's happening with weed rap. It's like what happened in the '90s, when Eazy-E and them popped, and then everyone was like, \"Let's talk about fucking murdering everything.\" I'm gonna make a movie like CB4, and it's gonna be like about fake stoner rappers.\n\n**GQ: What would the plot be? **\n\nCurren$y: It would be some fucking kids who tried everything to get on as far as the rap shit: they did the coke rap, they did the crazy fucking \"pour the blood on everybody\" rap. They couldn't get a deal. And then they saw me and were like, \"This might be the line. He's winning.\" So they jump on that, and they just faking it. They not really high. They living a lie, and then they get ousted for it.\n\n**GQ: Wait, is this really something you're working on? **\n\nCurren$y: No, that fucking actually just came to mind. I guess I gotta give you some percentage on that. We should develop that off the record. Let's work it out.\n\n**GQ: Definitely. You worked with one producer, The Alchemist, for your recent EP Covert Coup. How'd that union come about? **\n\nCurren$y: This is how it started: I went over to the studio to fucking meet my man Alchemist, to get the line on that Huxtable. That's the medical weed, I call it Huxtable. And we were like , \"Yo, we should do one track just to fuck everybody up, so they know we were smoking and chilling.\" And he was like, \"Yo that was really tight. Let's do a few more.\" And then once you got three records, you pretty much got 10.\n\n**GQ: And that all came from going to buy weed? **\n\nCurren$y: I was just gonna fucking kick it and burn some fatties. It sounds really terrible when you say it. It sounds federal. \"You went over to Alchemist's house to score weed?\" No. No I didn't. Alchemist isn't a drug dealer. I'm not gonna let you do that my friend. You're gonna ruin our friendship.\n\n**GQ: I'm sorry! Anyway, you release a ridiculous amount of material. Do you ever get writer's block? **\n\nCurren$y: When you rapping about shit you not really doing, you get writers' block. I only rap about what I'm doing so I kind of been making the same song for fucking four years. I rap about driving around in old Chevys, smoking weed, watching old movies, eating snacks, surfing the Internet. Downloading codes for video games. Ordering quesadillas. Shit like that. It's cool. Everybody respect it.\n\n**GQ: What old movies are you into right now? **\n\nCurren$y: You ever seen Uptown Saturday Night? It's funny as shit. It's like funny right now, in twenty—what is it, 2011?\n\n**GQ: Yep. **\n\nCurren$y: What do you think? Think everything's gonna get all crazy in 2012?\n\n**GQ: Well, I feel like if it does, it'd be kind of nice to see the end of the world, no? **\n\nCurren$y: Wow. Man. No. Not right now. I just got a new house. I'm chilling. 2050, let's check it out. But 2012—I'm still having a good time.\n\n**GQ: For sure. I saw you say in an interview that you don't like women's exposed feet. Any other pet peeves you care to share? **\n\nCurren$y: I don't really dig that pretty girls—like, really, really hot girls—they stretch the neck line on your shirts. You know: the chick will be sitting behind you, rubbing your shoulders, and she can do that without touching your shit, but she wants to get all sensual and reach in your shirt, through your neck, and stretch the neckline out on your BBC shirt that was like a hundred bucks. She thinks it's like a fucking undershirt. So she's stretching it out, she's rubbing you down, and you can't tell her anything. Because she's hot.\n\n** GQ: How about phobias? **\n\nCurren$y: I don't split poles. When I'm walking with my friends by lampposts, we all walk on the same side. And I won't cross over your legs. If you're sitting down and like chilling on the floor, I won't walk over your legs because then you'll go to jail.\n\n** GQ: What do you think about humor in hip-hop? Is there not enough? **\n\nCurren$y: The lack thereof is what got me on the phone with you, so I think everybody should stay doing what they doing. Hip-hop, it's like everybody's actually fucking cyborgs. It's like cyborg music. It's like \"yeaaaaahhhhhnnnn.\" That's what music sounds like right now. It's like light shows. It's crazy."
