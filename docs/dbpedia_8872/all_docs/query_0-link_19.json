        "text": "Larry June drinks about 35 oranges every morning. Pair that with 15 green juices and some chlorophyll, and you have the diet of a man who seeks the finer things in life.\n\n\"Organic\" isn’t just a buzzword for Larry. His countless projects outline the Orange Print to successful living: His clothing brand, Midnight Organic, tags his apparel with words like HEALTHY, ORGANIC, and GOOD JOB!; his song titles spark conversations about the trajectory of humanity; even his lyrics provide keen insight into the daily routines and investment opportunities that have allowed June to flourish as a self-made entrepreneur.\n\nLarry June’s persistent gratitude and optimism have guided him through the trials and tribulations within hip-hop, and his ‘hoods of Hunter’s Point, San Francisco and Vallejo. You might see him douse a crowd of fans at Rolling Loud with Uncle Larry’s Orange Juice, you might see him working at his SF boba shop, Honeybear, or you might even see him traveling through Mexico City, mesmerized by the architecture. An old-soul camouflaged as the spokesperson for Vitamin C, June has worked for over a decade to solidify his status as the suave gangster with no affinity for rap beef (unless it’s grass-fed and organic).\n\nThe Great Escape, Larry's latest album with GRAMMY-nominated producer Alchemist, is a step away from \"all the bullsh—\" and an invitation into the opulent grand-opening party for their cinematic The Great Escape Ski Resort. Alchemist’s beats score this groovier film-on-wax, adding touches of psychedelic-infused reggae and downtempo, as well as loops from ‘60s-era B-reels. Larry June builds his own world of gang lords and drug deals, referencing Mexican magnate Carlos Slim to discreet calls with his own invented cast of characters. With the fleeting third-person adlib of \"Sing it, Larry,\" our world-rebound protagonist croons words of affirmation throughout the album.\n\nLarry June's immensely positive brand of gangsta rap holds true on The Great Escape, and rappers from around the world lend verses on the opulence of life. Action Bronson appears on \"Solid Plan\" to discuss the banality of artificial intelligence and Tony Soprano’s sacrifices as a mob boss; Big Sean raps with Larry about their daily chlorophyll drinks and investments commercial real estate on \"Palisades, CA\"; and even Wiz Khalifa roll ups to relish on the empire June has created.\n\nBut June is far from out of touch with the people. The opening track begins with the rapper battling San Francisco's inclement weather: \"Bend a corner, I’m on Hayes Street copping a windbreaker\" — a moment anyone visiting the foggy city can relate to.\n\nAlthough June spent part of his childhood in Atlanta, his heart has always been in the Bay — from its windswept hills to its hometown rap heroes. Larry June sat down with GRAMMY.com to discuss growing up, doing things differently, how he and the Alchemist concocted The Great Escape.\n\nWhat was it like to live in Vallejo?\n\nI loved it. It was so different. There were crazy house parties and shit. S— was tight as hell. Big Mac Dre culture. It’s a whole different energy.\n\nDo you have any favorite Mac Dre songs or albums?\n\nMan, I like \"Not My Job.\" I could bust you a rap, I love all Mac Dre’s s—. It’s not even one particular album, his s— is just so different.\n\nOther than Mac Dre, who are some of your favorite old-school Bay Area artists?\n\nRBL Posse, RIP to Jack[a] — legendary, you know what I’m saying, can’t forget J. Stalin, can’t forget E-40, Too $hort, you know, all the classics. B-Legit, Cellski, everybody man, there’s so many I can’t even name all of them. It’s a whole different energy. The world still hasn’t even picked up everything that’s going on. Johnny Ca$h.\n\nBecause you mentioned Johnny Ca$h and J. Stalin, did you always have an affinity for artists who also sang a little bit?\n\nThat’s crazy you said that. For sure, I think so. J. Stalin’s really my boy, he was making music with me when I was like 16 years old. He’s a good dude, a real entrepreneur, made it out the ‘hood, started a business for himself, all kinds of s—. Legendary.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I loved that singing aspect in rapping. You could switch it up, and it doesn't have to be the best singing.\n\nI saw a quote recently where someone said, \"You don’t even have to be a Whitney Houston-level singer, sometimes there's beauty in using your own voice.\"\n\nIt’s an art. It’s natural and it’s coming from the heart. It’s how you sound, so you’re giving the people something that’s yours, versus you’re trying to sound like something and you’re trying to force it to sound perfect. Sometimes those imperfections make you 20x better.\n\nThat’s how I feel about my music – a lot of s— I might want to redo, I might have said a word wrong, but that’s how I say it. I’m going to give it to you the way I would give it to you in real life. I just do it for the motherf—rs who rock with me, that live like me, that understand what I’m talking about. If you don’t understand, hey, it wasn’t for you. [Laughs] Numbers, baby.\n\n**What inspired The Great Escape?**\n\nMe and Al, we was in the studio vibing, and the album had a real luxurious feeling. From when \"Turkish Cotton\" comes, it feels like a movie scene. Al was like, \"This is like some Robb Report s—.\" I didn’t know what the Robb Report was, so he showed me and it’s like a magazine with Lamborghinis and nice properties and expensive watches.\n\nThen, we saw something that said \"The Great Escape,\" and it hit me. I escaped all the bulls—; I’m living very peacefully. I escaped the jealousy, the odds that were against us. What we were going for was more like a spy-feel. \"Come to the spot, get your back rubbed, come to the Great Escape Ski Resort.\"\n\n**How did moving to Malibu and getting the place that was shown in the album’s behind-the-scenes documentary build the world of The Great Escape?**\n\nI pretty much recorded the majority of the songs at home. I’d come to [Al] and we’d escape from the world, get crazy cribs by the coast. We’d vibe, we’d hear some s— and I’d add little pieces in there.\n\nI’m inspired by seeing beautiful things, so I have to go to different places to get inspired while making the music. I went to Mexico City to film a portion of the \"Spanish\" video, and I’m seeing different architecture and eating all these different kinds of foods, seeing different s—. I started getting interested in Barragán lighting; it creates a different type of lighting in houses naturally. [Laughs] I was learning so much, and I was able to teach it to people who didn’t know it through the music.\n\nIt was real natural; nothing was forced. I was just being me and it came out dope, man. I wanted to make sure that I was rapping good enough with the Alchemist on his beats because everybody who works with the Alchemist is amazing. Artists from Roc Marci to Boldy James, Jay Worthy, Curren$y, even go back to Mobb Deep. They set the bar high. Prodigy.\n\n[Alchemist] was like, \"No, you got this s—. Stay in your bag. Don’t think about that, just do you.\" [Laughs]\n\nHow do you approach a Cardo album (Into The Late Night), versus a Harry Fraud album (Keep Going) versus an Alchemist album?\n\nI’ve built a relationship with these producers where we have our own bag. When Cardo sends me beats, he’s not sending me the beats he sends to Drake or whoever, I’m in our bag and I master that bag with each producer.\n\nIt’s kind of like a superpower for me. I can cut off my Alchemist bag for two months, not even thinking about that bag at all because the Cardo bag was recharging, so I never run out of raps. I live by the motto: If you do the same s—, you get the same results. The key is never losing yourself. I did an album with Alchemist, but I’m not going to turn into Common. [Laughs]\n\nI was surprised to hear \"60 Days\" because you’re probably one of the only artists who could get Al to rap. What was that conversation like?\n\nWe were really just in the studio vibing. He was jotting down some notes, and I guess he likes to write raps — he doesn’t like to be doing nothing. I looked over and I’m like, \"You got something for this?\" and he was like, \"F— it, I got something,\" and he jumped in there and did it.\n\nHe didn’t want to use the record [on the album], but I love the record. I love the beat by itself. That’s why I didn’t want to rap too long – eight bars, slight hook, eight bars. The beat is so movie scene-ish. He got on there, it worked out, he didn’t want to drop it, we ended up dropping it first.\n\nThat’s the magic with this record. Every song is consistently great.\n\nYou want to give them variety, man, start soft. I drink 35 oranges as soon as I wake up in the morning.\n\nWait, 35?\n\nMhm. I might drink 15 green juices, some chlorophyll; you’ve got to stay healthy inside the body. I might take a jog. I’ll rock 35 miles, for no reason.\n\nWhen did you realize that this is the lifestyle you’ve got to be chasing?\n\nIt made me feel better. I used to be going through some s—, so I use taking a walk or a jog to ease my mind and help me think clearer and see different things. I noticed when I started drinking the juices, it was making me feel better. It’s really those peaceful walks. I’ll walk in the rain 35 miles.\n\nThat’s something that’s always drawn me to your music. It’s music that you can listen to and aspire to be like.\n\nIt’s raw because I come from a completely different world. My grandma had the candy house in the hood – ICEEs, candy, sodas, making nachos for the 'hood. I’m preaching to my people that you don’t have to do the same thing.\n\nGo get you something healthy, take a walk. Everything ain’t about sitting in the ‘hood and doing the same s— that we come from, that people know us for. It’s cool to do different s—. I’m just an advocate for that. A lot of inspiration from my dad too because he was the first n— in the 'hood coming out healthy. You’ve got to be thankful for your parents.\n\nOn \"Turkish Cotton,\" you even mention\"I was just dead broke in 2017.\" What changed for you?\n\nThe cars got faster. My mindset got better. I started experiencing new things and looking at things from a bigger aspect. I always got that fight in me. I’m always hustling and working because I know it can get ugly; I lived it for the majority of my life. I’m new money. I didn’t come from millions of dollars, I didn’t have nothing passed down to me. I’m breaking a cycle for me and hopefully the next generation of kids that are coming up.\n\nThat’s why I talk my s— like, \"I bought the ‘Rarri,\" but I’m also going to let you know that, \"N—, I was broke just like you.\" Anybody can do it if I did it. My mom had me at 15 years old. I wasn’t supposed to be doing what I’m doing now, man.\n\nThat’s why being healthy is so important because if we’re not healthy, we’re not going to be able to do nothing. It first starts with how you feel and what you put in your body when you wake up, if you have negative people around you; you’ve got to be aware of everything if you want to be successful.\n\n**Now, it’s about legacy. You dropped your first project, Cali Grown, in 2010 and look at you now.**\n\n[When I dropped] Cali Grown, I was hella into smooth, peaceful beats and started doing what I wanted to do and started developing my voice and creating. I had a vision: being a boss, healthy living, being a player — but it can’t get ugly. I was taking my equipment with me everywhere I was going and practicing.\n\nWhat’s dope is that I could have easily deleted all that stuff from the internet, easily, but I left it up there purposefully to show you I was trash. [Laughs] I do it to show my people that if you keep going, you can be great, you just need to believe in it.\n\nSock it to 'em, Larry! Now, last but not least, what can happen in 60 days?\n\nIn 60 days, a lot can change. If you put time in and really dedicate yourself for 60 days – it can be a week, it can be 30 days, it can be 20 days – if you’re dedicating your time to doing something, it’s going to work. I’ve got a big thing about discipline. A lot can change, for real, you’ve just gotta keep rocking.\n\n6lack On His Comeback Album 'SIHAL': \"I’m Playing A Different Game\"\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is a geographically and culturally diverse region of Northern California whose music scene has influenced the world. There is a lot more territory to Northern California, but the more than 7.5 million people who live in the Bay are crucial to the state's music scene.\n\nWhile the Summer of Love and associated boom of rock and psychedelia in the 1960s might be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of the sounds of San Francisco, the Bay has long been a source of creative, boundary-breaking hip-hop music and culture. The region's nine counties are where many definitive hip-hop acts were raised and became inspired to create.\n\nMajor labels largely ignored Bay Area artists at the beginning of hip-hop's golden age. However, that lack of attention allowed for wider creative freedom and a bevy of distinctly Bay Area sounds.\n\nAs hip-hop celebrates half a century of soundtracking the world, it’s a good time to learn how this part of the West Coast fits into this global culture — and how it stands out. Listen to Spotify playlist below or visit Amazon Music, Pandora and Apple Music to learn more about the Bay Area's bountiful hip-hop culture.\n\nA Brief History Of Bay Area Hip-Hop\n\nThe Bay Area's first local commercial rap release came in 1981 via Motorcycle Mike’s \"Super Rat.\" But the world wouldn’t become seriously acquainted with Bay Area rappers until the early ‘90s, when MC Hammer told everyone what they couldn’t touch.\n\nSome of the most notable releases tap into the region's educated and aware, activist-oriented, health-focused lifestyle. The Bay also knows how to party, and the funky musicality of the region — from Sly and the Family Stone to Con Funk Shun (whose member Felton Pilate produced some of MC Hammer’s early works) — have been a strong influence on hip-hop culture nationwide.\n\nHowever, the Bay Area rap music scene is historically distinguished by reality-based work that sometimes alludes to criminal activity — including violence, murder, drug dealing and sex trafficking — and details rough times.\n\nThe intermingling between the fictional world of music and criminal realities has led rap lyrics to be used against defendants in criminal cases around the country. In the '90s and early aughts, prominent rappers such as Sacramento’s C-Bo and Vallejo’s Andre \"Mac Dre\" Hicks were jailed for their lyrics, which detailed crimes and had anti-police and governor sentiment.\n\nNew state legislation is setting a national example for such work to be inadmissible in court. In September, with the support of popular Bay Area rappers E-40 and Too $hort, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the Decriminalizing Artistic Expression Act to restrict the use of rap lyrics in criminal proceedings. (The Recording Academy is also involved in a federal effort to limit the use of lyrics in court.)\n\nSeveral high-profile murders and deaths altered the trajectory of burgeoning careers, casting a question mark about the unrealized potential of some of the Bay Area’s brightest artists. This unfortunate list includes the 1996 Las Vegas murder of Tupac Shakur — who spent formative years being educated and recording in the Bay Area — and Mac Dre, the progenitor of the region’s hyphy culture who was shot to death in Kansas City in 2004 and still reigns as the Bay Area’s biggest posthumous figure. Pittsburg’s Dominick \"The Jacka\" Newton is another revered figure supported heavily by Northern California who was killed in Oakland in 2015. In 2021, Stephen \"Zumbi\" Gaines from Zion I died in an Oakland hospital; his death was ruled a homicide, yet no criminal charges have been filed and his family called to continue the investigation in 2022.\n\nBay Area hip-hop has had a few moments to shine especially bright in the eyes of the world, but the local scene has kept grinding in and out of the mainstream spotlight. Sporadic attention and contracts from the major record labels throughout the years meant that the Bay Area rap scene generally needed to continue to be sustained independently.\n\nIn the pre-streaming era, record stores such as Amoeba Music in San Francisco and Rasputin Music (which had several locations at its height) sold thousands of copies of albums and mixtapes from local artists on their own. Too $hort and E-40’s DIY business model would influence Southern rap moguls like Percy \"Master P\" Miller, who started his No Limit Records in Richmond, California, and Bryan \"Baby\" Williams of New Orleans’ Cash Money Records.\n\nFor decades, there was an absence of prolonged label and distribution support from the traditional music business centers of Los Angeles, New York City and, later, Atlanta. A significant shift began when EMPIRE Distribution opened in San Francisco in 2010, making the city a power player in the international music industry.\n\nWhile the San Francisco Bay Area may not be the biggest name in the national hip-hop conversation, its underdog status is a point of pride and reason for continued creativity. In 2023, hip-hop artists, producers and businesspeople keep an eye on the Bay for lyrical, linguistic, music, dance and style trends.\n\nDefinitive Artists In Bay Area Hip-Hop\n\nMC Hammer: Stanley Burrell’s evolution from young bat boy for the Oakland Athletics and growing up connected to the streets, to becoming the GRAMMY-winning and Billboard-charting pop superhero MC Hammer is the Bay Area’s first international hip-hop success story. He’s the only rapper from Northern California who had his own Saturday morning cartoon (Hammerman) on ABC — an epic achievement in the early '90s, when weekend programming for kids was still a household phenomenon.\n\nHe was the first to work with major brands like Taco Bell and Sprite in an era when hip-hop didn’t have the attention of corporate America, like it does now. VH1 aired a biopic in 2001 and A&E commissioned a family reality series in 2009. There’s even a Hammer doll made by the toy company Mattel.\n\nDigital Underground: Helmed by Gregory \"Shock G\" Jacobs and Ronald \"Money-B\" Brooks, Oakland’s mischievous party rap crew Digital Underground flirted with various Billboard singles and albums charts throughout the '90s and released six albums until Jacobs' untimely passing in 2021.\n\nThe self-described \"Sons of the P\" drew from the well of the Parliament-Funkadelic world, sampling and interpolating George Clinton’s best-known riffs, ad-libs and freewheeling thoughts. Digital Underground’s two top 40 hits include \"Kiss You Back\" and \"The Humpty Dance,\" the latter nominated for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group at the 1991 GRAMMYs. \"The Humpty Dance\" introduced the character of Humpty Hump, which was another of Jacobs’ alter egos, but the group pretended like they were different people, sometimes enlisting Jacobs’ own brother to help further the prank on stage.\n\nTupac Shakur: Shock G and Money-B took a young Tupac Shakur under their wings, bringing him on tour as a roadie and dancer in 1990 and producing songs on his 1991 debut album 2Pacalypse Now. Shakur recorded half of his sophomore album in the East Bay, and later signed to Los Angeles labels Interscope and Death Row.\n\nHis mother, Afeni Shakur, reconnected with the Bay Area in the last years of her life and passed away on her houseboat in Sausalito, not far from Marin City, where Tupac lived in his high school years. History hasn’t viewed him as a strictly Bay Area artist, but the region is a crucial architect of his career.\n\nToo $hort: Though he was born in Los Angeles and moved to the East Bay in his youth, Todd Shaw’s Too $hort character is synonymous with Oakland, its pimp culture and being the first to sell custom mixtapes on the streets. He turned his \"out the trunk\" ethos into a decades-long deal with Jive Records.\n\nDespite threatening to retire in the mid-'90s, Too $hort continues to make music to add to his discography, which includes six platinum-selling albums, three gold albums and the enduring hyphy anthem \"Blow The Whistle.\" He has collaborated with many rappers, including Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., and on \"Bossy,\" a top 20 hit for Kelis. Shaw represented the Bay Area at the 2023 GRAMMYs' tribute to hip-hop, and told PEOPLE that he was \"really glad to be a part of it.\"\n\nE-40: Like Too $hort, E-40 (Earl Stevens) parlayed his independent record hustle into a contract with Jive Records that yielded gold and platinum-selling singles and albums. Both essentially created a playbook that was cited and followed by Southern labels such as No Limit and Cash Money. E-40’s storytelling prowess and gift for slanguage is delivered with impressive speed, and continues to influence MCs all over the world. He’s as deft at crafting party-starters like his hyphy hit \"Tell Me When to Go\" as poignant tales like \"Zoom,\" which describes how life handed him nothing, but he transcended his circumstances to become a leader.\n\nA community-minded philanthropist, he recently donated $100,000 to Grambling University, which he attended, to create the Earl \"E-40\" Stevens Sound Recording Studio on campus and inspire the next generation of artists. In recent years, he has applied his independent strategies to the food, wine and spirits industries, and will release a cookbook in November.\n\nE-40 and Too $hort have recorded two albums together, and have since formed the northern half of the rap supergroup Mount Westmore, with Los Angeles natives Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube. Stevens will soon have a Bay Area street named after him called E-40 Way in Vallejo — just as Shaw received Too $hort Way in Oakland in December.\n\nMac Dre: Andre Hicks didn’t have a mainstream career like MC Hammer or Too $hort, but his influence on Bay Area music and culture as a progenitor and propeller of hyphy remains outsized. His music is rooted in the streets, but also party minded and musical, bridging a gap between the rough and serious and happy and intoxicated.\n\nHis mother Wanda Salvatto, who is nicknamed Mac Wanda, continued his Thizz Entertainment label after his still-unsolved 2004 murder in Kansas City, Missouri. She has built an extensive discography of posthumous and tribute albums and compilations.\n\nKeak Da Sneak: After making noise in the mid-Nineties Oakland group 3X Krazy and later on his own, the rapper born Charles Kente Williams has earned his spot as a crucial Bay Area music and slang innovator. He’s credited with expressions like \"fa sheezy,\" \"yadidimean\" and hyphy, the latter a contraction devised to describe his hyperactive tendencies.\n\n\"I don’t think they know, that’s my word,\" he proclaims in the chorus of his quick-moving 2005 party hit \"Super Hyphy.\" In 2017, Keak Da Sneak was shot eight times by an unknown assailant at a gas station in Richmond, California. Though he’s been using a wheelchair ever since, he remains active in the local scene, recently appearing at DJ and podcaster Dregs One’s History of Bay Area Hip-Hop day party in San Francisco.\n\nDefinitive Bay Area Hip-Hop Releases\n\nToo $hort - Life Is…Too $hort (1988)\n\nAs a rapper and character, Too $hort has transcended generations of Bay Area hip-hop fans, but the old-schoolers will still point to his fifth album, which broke him out of the region thanks to support in the form of a 1989 re-release from Jive Records. It delivers the bawdy, pimp boasting raps that he’s known for, but Life Is… also shows his less-known talents for keyboard and drum programming.\n\nMC Hammer - Please Hammer Don’t Hurt ‘Em (1990)\n\nMC Hammer’s third album Please Hammer Don’t Hurt ‘Em spent almost five months on top of the Billboard 200, and he is the only rap artist from Northern California to win GRAMMY Awards. With their hooky Rick James and Prince samples, respectively, the album’s hit singles \"U Can’t Touch This\" and \"Pray\" set a production standard that has been relied on pretty much ever since — whether in the most popular songs of P. Diddy’s Bad Boy Records catalog in the 1990s, or today’s social media hits by Latto and Coi Leray.\n\nIn 1991, Please Hammer Don’t Hurt ‘Em was nominated for Album Of The Year, and he took home three golden gramophones for Best Rhythm & Blues Song and Best Rap Solo Performance for \"U Can’t Touch This\" and Best Music Video - Long Form.\n\nDigital Underground - Sex Packets (1990)\n\nDU’s platinum-selling debut album may be the Bay Area’s greatest concept rap album, a lascivious romp assisted by imaginary sexual enhancement pills years before Viagra was invented. Songs like \"Freaks of the Industry,\" \"Doowutchyalike\" and \"The Humpty Dance\" brought fun and levity to the streets and households across America.\n\n\"The Humpty Dance\" was not only a top 20 pop hit and a No. 1 rap single; its undulating groove formed the backbone of countless pop, rap, R&B and drum and bass songs that later sampled it. Even the Spice Girls couldn’t resist using it for their 1996 song \"If U Can’t Dance.\"\n\n2Pac - 2Pacalypse Now (1991)\n\nThe majority of Tupac Shakur’s first two albums were made in the Bay Area: He recorded all of 2Pacalypse Now and half of his sophomore album Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z… at Starlight Sound in the East Bay city of Richmond. 2Pacalypse Now shows how a descendent of the Black Panther Party reflects his history for the '90s.\n\nHe worked with local producers — including Digital Underground’s Shock G, Raw Fusion and Big D The Impossible — on early anthems like \"Brenda’s Got a Baby,\" \"Trapped\" and \"If My Homie Calls.\" Though his posthumous discography is long, he would go on to release just two more albums before his murder in 1996: Me Against the World and the GRAMMY-nominated All Eyez on Me.\n\nDel the Funky Homosapien - \"Mistadobalina\" (1991)\n\nWhen he was a little kid, Del the Funky Homosapien designed the three-eyed face that became the logo of his Hieroglyphics crew and a worldwide symbol of Bay Area rap. \"Mistadobalina,\" which he produced with Boogiemen and his cousin Ice Cube, was his breakout song. His confident and fun flow drew people into the Hiero world — which now includes an annual festival in Oakland — and it still sounds timeless.\n\nRBL Posse - \"Don’t Give Me No Bammer Weed\" (1992)\n\nThe biggest group to come from San Francisco’s tough Hunters Point neighborhood and score a major label record deal, RBL Posse is best remembered for this ode to smoking quality cannabis from their debut album A Lesson To Be Learned. Members Hitman and Mr. Cee were both victims of gun violence, but their sonic calling card remains a local anthem.\n\nN2DEEP - \"Back to the Hotel\" (1992)\n\nVallejo is most often associated with Mac Dre and E-40, but the city also birthed N2DEEP, the Latinx group that brought the sax-heavy rap song \"Back to the Hotel\" to No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. This song was everywhere in 1992, and has been due for a renaissance of appreciation.\n\nSouls of Mischief - \"93 ‘til Infinity\" (1993)\n\nFriends of Del the Funky Homosapien and fellow Hieroglyphics crew members, A-Plus, Opio, Phesto and Tajai are Souls of Mischief. \"93 ‘til Infinity\" remains their inspiring signature song, resonating sonically and lyrically across generations. The track has been sampled dozens of times by artists like J. Cole, Big K.R.I.T. and Tyga.\n\nThe Conscious Daughters - Ear to the Street (1993)\n\nReleased by Priority Records — the Los Angeles label that introduced venerable acts such as Funkadelic, N.W.A. and EPMD to the world — Ear to the Street gave a national platform to two smooth and streetwise rappers from Oakland who happened to be women: CMG (Carla Green) and the late Special One (Karryl Smith, who passed away in 2011). Their debut album, and especially its breakout single \"Somethin’ to Ride to (Fonky Expedition),\" are still requisite car listening in the Bay Area.\n\nSpice 1 - 187 He Wrote (1993)\n\nThough he collaborated with Shakur, Spice 1 is still one of the more underrated and under the radar of the old-school gangster rappers. This sophomore album features production by Too $hort and local legends Ant Banks and E-A-Ski, as well as guest spots by E-40 and Compton’s MC Eiht. 187 He Wrote topped the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nLuniz - \"I Got 5 On It (Bay Ballas Vocal Remix)\" (1995)\n\nAlmost 30 years since its release, this ode to smoking weed by Oakland rappers Yukmouth and Numskull still makes frequent appearances at Bay Area events and clubs. The Bay Ballas Vocal Remix, which features E-40, Richie Rich, Spice 1, Dru Down, Shock G, hogged all the attention back in the day and is still the version to play.\n\nDJ Shadow - Endtroducing (1996)\n\nThe mysterious DJ and producer mixed at the nucleus of the SoleSides crew, which later became the Quannum Projects label and includes vital Bay Area artists like Blackalicious, Lyrics Born and Lateef The Truthspeaker. Shadow’s debut album Endtroducing is a masterpiece of instrumental hip-hop.\n\nHieroglyphics - 3rd Eye Vision (1998)\n\nOakland’s Hieroglyphics is made up of solo MCs and groups who have created some of Bay Area rap’s most vaunted songs. The first of three crew albums, the stellar arrangement and song selection on the 22-track 3rd Eye Vision, which refers to their three-eyed logo and spotlights each individual’s talents, keeps it in the conversation 25 years since its release.\n\nBlackalicious - \"Alphabet Aerobics\" (1999)\n\nA stunning feat of linguistic excellence by the late rapper Gift of Gab (who tragically passed away in 2021 after receiving a kidney implant the year before), \"Alphabet Aerobics\" pushes rhymes of increasing complexity from A to Z. It’s a textbook of how to MC in one track.\n\nMystic - Cuts for Luck and Scars for Freedom (2001)\n\nMandolyn Wind Ludlum is best known as Mystic, a singer, rapper and educator from Oakland whose debut album sounds as fresh as when it was released in 2001. Cuts for Luck was re-released 10 years later in large part to the lead single \"The Life\" and \"W,\" a duet featuring Fresno rapper Planet Asia that was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2002 GRAMMYs.\n\nCharizma & Peanut Butter Wolf - Big Shots (2003)\n\nMurdered in 1993, South Bay rapper Charizma never got the chance to see where his talent would take him. Big Shots was not released until 2003, but his flows on songs like \"Methods\" and \"Jack the Mack\" are timeless. Peanut Butter Wolf —a San Jose native producer and close friend of Charizma — moved his record label Stones Throw to Los Angeles and keeps Charizma's legacy alive.\n\nMac Dre - Treal TV DVD and Soundtrack (2004)\n\nThanks to the continuation of his Thizz Entertainment record label after his 2004 murder, Mac Dre’s posthumous discography is extensive, but a DVD released when he was alive is perhaps the most coveted release in the collection. Treal TV has a cult following for its casual depiction of his everyday life, car collection and live footage of him performing songs such as \"Thizzelle Dance,\" which also appears on Dre’s 2002 album Thizzelle Washington.\n\nThere’s also a CD soundtrack version of Treal TV featuring various artists and associates; a second volume of Treal TV was released in 2006 and includes footage of Mac Dre on the road in Hawaii.\n\nMistah F.A.B. - \"Super Sic Wit It\" (2005)\n\nWith his Dope Era clothing store and frequent community events, Oakland’s Mistah F.A.B. has been an entrepreneurial and philanthropic leader in the scene since he turned out hyphy club and radio hits like \"Super Sic Wit It.\" The high energy song for car sideshows helped him score a major label contract.\n\nE-40 - My Ghetto Report Card (2006)\n\nE-40’s many albums have consistently good arrangement and a narrative arc of storytelling, and My Ghetto Report Card represents him at the crest of a second wind that floated him into greater international recognition. Produced by Lil Jon, the lead single \"Tell Me When to Go\" landed at No. 35 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains one of the big hits of the hyphy era.\n\nAtlanta’s king of crunk produced seven additional songs on the album, including \"White Gurl\" featuring UGK and Juelz Santana and \"U and Dat\" featuring T-Pain and Kandi, while Bay Area standard-setter Rick Rock and E-40’s son Droop-E rounded out the production duties.\n\nThe Coup - Pick a Bigger Weapon (2006)\n\nThe Coup represented the revolutionary side of Oakland with razor-sharp intellect and furiously funky beats. Pick a Bigger Weapon was released by Epitaph Records, a label known more for rock than rap music, and includes collaborations with Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys and Tom Morello from Rage Against The Machine. Frontman Boots Riley has made forays into film and streaming TV, most recently with the comedy series \"I’m a Virgo.\" The Coup’s late DJ, Pam The Funkstress, was selected by Prince to open some of his final shows.\n\nZion I - \"Tech $\" (2017)\n\nOakland’s Zion I has long reflected on the changes and realities of the Bay Area in their music. Nowhere does this resonate the most as it does on \"Tech $,\" which details displacement and gentrification as it was literally happening to the late MC Stephen Gaines, who was known as Zumbi and Baba Zumbi. The accompanying music video shows him moving his family out of their house and out of the area.\n\nStunnaman02 - \"Big Steppin’\" (2021)\n\nPerhaps the biggest local rap song to come out of the pandemic, San Francisco rapper Jordan \"Stunnaman02\" Gomes even got the city’s mayor to do the song’s infectious associated dance, which KQED calls \"a trend that rhythmically mimics the act of bench pressing.\"\n\nBay Area Hip-Hop Subgenres & Styles\n\nBay Area rap can be educated, activist, party-starting and gangster — and sometimes all on the same track. There’s a distinct pride in the scope and the range of subject matter and sonic aesthetics in the region. Achieving uncategorizable moments is wonderful, but everyone seems to love big, trunk-rattling bass.\n\nThere’s always been nuance within these major styles — for example, music that could blanketly be called gangster could also be subdivided into general topic styles such as pimping and drug dealing, and even small subgenres like mobb music — which was coined to describe a particular sinister and gritty sound characterized by even heavier basslines more than the lyrical content.\n\nTurntablism: In the '90s Bay Area DJs with mobile party and technical battle circuit experience contributed significantly to the development of turntablism. With the help of the Return of the DJ compilation series from San Francisco’s Bomb Hip-Hop Records, turntablism became an international style of using and manipulating record players like musical instruments to record original works. With talents such as Shortkut, DJ Disk, DJ Apollo, DJ Flare, D-Styles, Qbert and Mix Master Mike, local crew Invisibl Skratch Piklz won world battle championships and inspired countless fans to become DJs. Mix Master Mike has toured extensively with Beastie Boys, Metallica and Cypress Hill.\n\nHyphy: The aughts ushered in the music, linguistic and car subculture called hyphy, bringing in quicker tempos ready for popping pills and \"going dumb\" on the dancefloor. Too $hort would criticize the abuse of MDMA in his 2006 hit \"Blow the Whistle,\" but most of hyphy’s hits revel in ignorance — and Mac Dre certainly touted the benefits of ecstasy when he was alive.\n\nAlmost 20 years since hyphy’s ascent and this is thought of as a sort of golden era of Bay Area hip-hop, a time when the world’s attention was facing west. Hyphy songs have been sampled in more contemporary contexts (as Saweetie used \"Blow the Whistle\" for 2020’s \"Tap In\"), and the subject is a common one used to evoke an uplifting nostalgia.\n\nBased: Brandon \"Lil B\" McCartney formed the rap group the Pack while attending Berkeley High School, and their 2006 cult hit \"Vans\" led to an album deal with Jive Records. After leaving the Pack, Lil B single-handedly propagated an unedited and free associative style he called based, dubbing himself the Based God. He was the first in the area to use social media sites and apps to become an early meme, which he supported with a large quantity of songs and videos.\n\nRising Bay Area Rap Artists\n\nThe next generation of artists leading the future of the Bay Area is tapping into the technological prowess of the region while furthering traditions of musical innovation and philanthropic goals. While Bay Area rap has long been male-dominated, the future may be more balanced.\n\nLarry June: Ten albums deep, Larry June is not exactly new to this, but he’s the San Francisco artist who is currently breaking through to the world with his album Spaceships on the Blade. Northern California’s healthy, organic lifestyle is a popular topic for June, who eats well, owns a boba shop and is showing his fans the benefits of consistent, hard work.\n\nP-Lo: After years producing for the Bay Area’s HBK Gang artists as well as national stars such as Wiz Khalifa and Yo Gotti, P-Lo’s status as a solo artist is on the rise with his 2022 album STUNNA. His 2022 collab with Larry June, \"Doing Good,\" is a uplifting banger\n\nLil Kayla: Born and raised in San Francisco, 24-year-old Lil Kayla is signed to Atlantic and repping for the 415 on her freestyles, singles and 2022 album Young & Turnt. \"I’m about to do it for my city,\" she said in a May interview with Lil Blood TV. \"I’m gonna be the one to do it, 'cause everybody else, they get it and they leave and they don’t come back. I’m not going nowhere.\"\n\nLARussell: Born LaRussell Thomas, Vallejo’s LARussell has harnessed social media to spread his sharp rhymes, as well as his social message. He donates money to allow his community to enjoy restaurant meals they may not otherwise be able to afford. Freestyles for Sway and the Breakfast Club and his album I Hate When Life’s Going Great have solidified his name outside the region.\n\nMacArthur Maze: Teamwork makes the dreamwork, and there’s hope that MacArthur Maze, the Oakland collective of MCs and producers led by Golden State Warriors DJ D Sharp, will help usher in a fresh era of working together for the creative good in the Bay Area, as evidenced on the new group album Blvck Saturday.\n\nSu’Lan: This Richmond-based duo describe themselves as having \"pretty girl swag with a hood twist\" flip old crunk and hyphy hits into fresh new favorites on their debut album Forever Da Gang.\n\nTotogangzMau: A female Samoan rapper from East Palo Alto, TotogangzMau is showing lyrical greatness and melodic hooks out the gate on autobiographical songs like \"Grow Up.\"\n\nNotable Northern California Neighbors\n\nThe Bay Area’s sky high rents and home prices have steadily driven residents to the Central Valley, which includes cities like Modesto, Stockton and California’s capital city of Sacramento, and effectively stretched the geographical and sociological boundaries of the region.\n\nSacramento produced a bounty of homegrown gangster rappers. The most notable are C-Bo, a 2Pac collaborator who was jailed in 1998 for his anti-police and governor lyrics; Marvaless, a woman who debuted with C-Bo and went on to release several solo albums and collaborations with Bay Area rappers Messy Marv, Husalah and The Jacka; and Mozzy, a contemporary star from the Empire Distribution crew. The region also claims Saweetie, the \"Icy Girl\" who has been endorsed by McDonald’s and is signed to Warner Records; she grew up in the East Bay city of Hayward before moving to Sacramento.\n\nAfter a spate of violent incidents at major hip-hop concerts led Oakland to ban rap shows for a year in 1989, the Bay Area’s biggest cities developed a reputation for being averse to the genre. Sacramento, Stockton and Modesto have served as more consistent markets for a number of Bay Area rappers, especially those with more violent or drug-related content.\n\nA Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nIt's no secret that Filipinos can unapologetically belt out a song from Celine Dion, Whitney Houston or any pop diva on the mic. But beyond the viral videos of them singing their hearts out in malls or in their homes, the Filipino music scene is vibrantly filled with heart and emotions; and often taken over by powerful soloists like the Philippine pop princess Sarah Geronimo, balladeers like Martin Nievera or Morisette Amon, and acoustic/rock bands like Ben&Ben or Up Dharma Down that often sing about love, heartbreak and life.\n\nWithin the last decade, we've seen an evolution in the Philippine music scene: while solo stars continue to shine, pop groups have begun to take over the spotlight. The concept of pop groups have existed before in Philippine entertainment, however, were usually formed through variety shows or composed of actors and actresses — not necessarily pop idols that you can compare in other Asian music markets like Japan and South Korea.\n\nIt really wasn't until 2018, during the peak of third-generation K-pop, where we saw the beginning of first generation Pinoy pop idol groups. Inspired and influenced by the K-pop idol training system, some P-pop entertainment companies have begun implementing similar systems, or inviting Korean mentors who are active in the industry for any vocal and dance training needed.\n\nTwo of the most notable first-gen P-Pop groups are SB19 and BINI, who are at the forefront of bringing P-pop to a global audience. Five-piece boy band SB19 became the first Southeast Asian group to be nominated for a Billboard Music Award in 2021, and their 2023 single \"GENTO\" was approved for GRAMMY consideration last year. Meanwhile, eight-piece girl group BINI have earned the title as the Nation's Girl Group after a string of successful viral hits including \"Salamin, Salamin\" and \"Pantropiko\"; just this year, they made history as the first P-pop act to perform at KCON in Los Angeles.\n\nOf course, the P-pop universe wouldn't be complete without solo acts. P-pop fans love to celebrate the timeless discography of Sarah Geronimo or gush over Asia's pop heartthrob Darren Espanto, and there's always new individual talent proving that the scene is still thriving.\n\nAs major P-pop stars continue to make waves, there's tons of blossoming acts who are helping to raise the Filipino flag in the global music scene. In light of the bright future ahead, here are a mix of P-Pop groups and soloists you should check out.\n\nALAMAT\n\nIf the actual country of the Philippines were a pop group, it would be ALAMAT. The six member group — composed of Taneo, Mo, Jao, Tomas, R-ji, and Alas — under Viva Records values Filipino culture in their concepts.\n\nEach member hails from different regions of the Philippines and also speak different dialects from their respective regions. Using dialects and culture to their advantage, ALAMAT often incorporates traditional folk dances, instruments, and lyrics in their native languages; and blends them into the modern sounds of hip-hop, R&B and dance.\n\nBGYO\n\nFormed in 2018 and officially making their debut under Star Music in 2021 with \"The Light,\" the quintet composed of Gelo, Akira, JL, Mikki, and Nate are known as the \"Aces of P-Pop.\" The name BGYO even celebrates their heritage, as it's an acronym for \"Becoming the change, Going further, You and I, Originally Filipino.\"\n\nOften fusing pop sounds with R&B, the boy group isn't afraid to get quirky with their concepts — whether they're singing a ballad in suits or wearing vibrant oversized ones. As a result, their music is helping BGYO score big wins: Their single \"The Baddest\" made them the first Filipino act to top Billboard's Next Big Sound chart in 2021, followed by P-Pop Group of the Year at the TikTok Awards Philippines in 2022.\n\nKAIA\n\nDebuting under SB19's former label, ShowBT Philippines, KAIA is composed of members Angela, Charlotte, Sophia, Alexa, and Charice. The quintet officially made their debut in 2022 with their lead single \"BLAH BLAH\" — a powerful EDM-pop track that can be considered for your gaming playlist.\n\nThe name KAIA is a double entendre: a Cebuano word \"kinaiya\" meaning one's self and personality; and the Tagalog word \"kaya\" which roughly translates \"to be able to\" or \"can do.\" In other words, a P-pop girl group that can give you the extra boost when you need that sonic encouragement on the daily.\n\nInigo Pascual\n\nOne of the Philippine heartthrobs, Inigo Pascual is a suave and smooth pop soloist who aims to make you swoon with his R&B-pop serenades. His pop-doowop hit \"Dahil Sa'Yo\" off his solo debut of the same name became the first song to top the Billboard Philippines Top 20 chart in 2016.\n\nRight from his debut, the actor and singer/songwriter continued to soar in his career when he released his international single \"Options\" in 2019. Just last month, the chart-topping singer unveiled his latest project, Basta't Alam Kong Tayo 1, a three-track single-album under Republic Records Philippines.\n\nG22\n\nIf you already listen to K-pop, then you are familiar with the girl crush concept where the sounds are bass-heavy and the looks are all about dark outfits with smokey makeup. If that's up your alley, then check out G22.\n\nUnder Cornerstone Entertainment, the former quartet-turned-trio composed of members AJ, Alfea, and Jaz are known to be the \"Female Alphas of Philippine Pop.\" The trio officially made their debut in April 2022 with their first single \"BANG!\" which was then followed by their second single \"Babalik!\" in May. But don't be fooled by their powerful demeanors — the trio also has a light and soft side to themselves in their B-sides and singles too.\n\nVXON\n\nIf G22 is dubbed as the \"Female Alphas of Philippine Pop,\" then VXON are said to be the \"Monsters of P-pop\" — so don't be fooled by the pretty boy looks VXON may carry. They are a P-pop group that can balance bubblegum pop with beast-like concepts, as if you're watching the transformation of boys to men. But at their core, they're making music to capture your heart (see for yourself with their viral R&B hit \"Sandal\").\n\nMaking their official debut in January 2022, the group consists of five members: C13, Franz, Patrick, Vince and Sam. After a big first year — they won Favorite Rookie P-Pop Group at Nylon Manila's Big, Bold, and Brave Awards in 2022 — VXON have continued winning hearts, most recently delivering a series of swoon-worthy live sessions on their YouTube channel.\n\nMaymay Entrata\n\nA multi-talented soloist, Maymay embodies Filipino entertainment, a fun and vibrant breath of fresh air within the Philippine music scene. She takes pride in her Visayan roots and stays grounded from her humble beginnings, even naming and singing her songs in Visaya, Tagalog and English.\n\nFirst known as the season 7 winner of \"Pinoy Big Brother\" in 2016, Maymay has made a name for herself as a musical artist in the last couple of years. Signed under the same label as BINI and BGYO, Maymay is grandiose in her music, presenting a plethora of genres in her discography, from disco to dance pop to a little salsa with visuals that encapsulate inspiration from Filipino culture. \"Her journey is only going further as she teased her first and upcoming international single \"Paradise\" at the 'ASAP Natin 'To in California' concert earlier this month.\"\n\nPLUUS\n\nFormerly known as SBTCBoys, the six-member boy group composed of Theo, Gab, Justin, Yen, Haro, and JL made their debut in 2023 with their first EP +.Y.M. (stylized and read as Time). Steering away from the traditional lead single promotions, PLUUS broke boundaries by promoting three tracks at once with \"Amigo,\" \"My Time\" and \"Cross My Heart\" last year.\n\nThe trio of tracks also displayed PLUUS' wide array of talents: \"Amigo\" is a hip-hop-heavy dance pop track celebrating camaraderie; whereas \"My Time\" follows the personal stories of being an idol; and \"Cross My Heart\" is a love song about letting go. They've continued showing their versatility in 2024, with the airy single \"Universe\" and the thumping track \"Summotion.\"\n\n1st.One\n\n1st.One was already putting themselves on the map, and embodying their name, before they even made their official debut in July 2020; the month before, they became the first Filipino act to perform at the Seoul Music Awards. The six members — Ace, Max, Alpha, J, Joker, Jayson — debuted under the Philippine subsidiary of FirstOne Entertainment in South Korea with their single electronic pop single \"You Are The One (Ttak Maja Nuh).\"\n\nIf you're into the nostalgic sounds of second-gen K-pop, 1st.One may be your seamless transition into P-pop. But just like any other group, they've explored different sounds and concepts; earlier this year, the group switched it up and dropped their R&B slow jam single \"Dito\" that was choreographed by member Max.\n\nDIONE\n\n1st.One's sister group, DIONE (or stylized as D1ONE), also debuted in 2020, carrying that girl crush aesthetic with them. Some members of the group were first introduced as LUNA, a project trainee group under FirstOne Entertainment set to debut. Eventually, the quartet composed of Joyden, DK, Clara, and Ella released their digital single \"BLING BLING\" in April 2022.\n\nUpon their official debut, the quartet's image delivered expensive pop, soundtracking their luxurious, high-fashion looks with EDM-driven pop — somewhat reminiscent of the sounds of second-gen K-pop groups like 2NE1 and After School. Their music is fun, energetic and quite tantalizing.\n\nYARA\n\nFairly new to the game, YARA is oozing with charisma, from their rap flows to their dance moves. Signed under Sony Music Philippines, YARA consists of four members — Gelou, Rocher, Christa, and Kim — who blend rap, hip-hop and pop all together.\n\nDebuting in March 2023, the P-pop girl group released their first single \"Adda\" (short for \"Apat Dapat Dapat Apat\"). Earlier this year, the group revived the old school bubblegum pop song \"Bakit Papa?\" by variety show girl group Sexbomb Girls, and gave it an R&B twist. Their recent track \"Katawan Flow\" sees the group making the dancehall genre their own — hinting that their musical direction will always be unpredictable.\n\nMaki\n\nMaki isn't your typical idol pop singer, but that's exactly what makes him a promising soloist. He seamlessly blends alternative rock and pop together, triggering a listener to get in their feels along the way.\n\nWhen he's not dancing to BINI's \"Cherry On Top,\" you can often find Maki strumming a guitar, questioning various love-related situations. And it seems his approach is working: his latest release, \"Dilaw,\" topped the Billboard Philippines' Hot 100 and Billboard Top Philippines Songs for multiple weeks in July.\n\nCALISTA\n\nOfficially making their debut under Tyronne Escalante Artist Management and Merlion Events Production in 2022, CALISTA is working toward being the next P-pop greats. Carrying more of a girl crush vibe, CALISTA's sounds blend dreamy pop with 808 beats and R&B.\n\nOriginally debuting as a six-member ensemble with the trap-inspired pop single \"Race Car,\" the group has spent the majority of 2024 as a quartet comprised of Anne, Dain, Elle, and Denise. Their latest single \"Let Me Know\" has made its way around TikTok, helping them get one step closer to achieving superstar status.\n\nECLYPSE\n\nOriginally known as YAMA, ECLYPSE is fairly new, but definitely promising, to the P-Pop game. Comprised of six former participants of reality-survival show \"Top Class\" (Lex, Gilly, Dean, Clyde, Gab, Joshuel) and one who was announced as a member on the live-streaming app KUMU (Rave), the group have been forming since 2022 and made their official debut this year under GKD Labels.\n\nWhether they're taking on a light or dark concept, their sounds revolve around the EDM genre — a seamless fit for their tones and voices. If you're a fan of synths, harmonies and falsetto, this may be the group for you.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nSummer may be slowly edging toward fall, but the red-hot streak of this summer's musical output shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThis New Music Friday (Aug. 16), Post Malone goes country with his sixth studio album F-1 Trillion, Meghan Trainor adds four songs (and rearranges the track list) to the deluxe edition of her latest LP Timeless, and global girl group KATSEYE unveil their debut mini-album SIS (SOFT IS STRONG). Plus, Muscadine Bloodline share their fourth full-length The Coastal Plain and Nikka Costa drops Dirty Disco, her first album in eight years.\n\nWhen it comes to singles, there's just as many new songs to explore — from superstar collabs like ROSALÍA and LISA's empowered \"NEW WOMAN\" to the latest releases from Hozier and Peggy Gou.\n\nBelow, dive into eight more new releases from pop and K-pop to rap, rock, country, dance, and more.\n\nLady Gaga & Bruno Mars — \"Die With a Smile\"\n\nLady Gaga and Bruno Mars gave the world just 12 hours notice that they were dropping \"Die With a Smile\" this week, sending Little Monsters and Hooligans alike into a tizzy as they braced themselves for the surprise duet.\n\nMars' sensual vocals lead off the moony, apocalyptic love song, which marks Mars' first release since his GRAMMY-winning work with Anderson .Paak as Silk Sonic. Strumming an electric guitar, the 15-time GRAMMY winner vows, \"I, I just woke from a dream/ Where you and I had to say goodbye/ And I don't know what it all means/ But since I survived, I realized/ Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow.\"\n\nAs for Mother Monster's oeuvre, \"Die With a Smile\" lands somewhere between Joanne and \"Shallow\" as her fans wait impatiently for LG7. Not to be outdone, Gaga takes over on the second verse, supported by Mars' swooning harmonies as the duo crescendo the intensity of their devotion to meet the literal end of the world.\n\nLISA & ROSALÍA — \"NEW WOMAN\"\n\nOn New Music Friday eve, BLACKPINK member LISA added to her blossoming collection of solo bangers with \"NEW WOMAN,\" an empowering shapeshifter of a duet that sees her joining forces with ROSALÍA.\n\n\"Hit it when I serve/ B—, you better swerve/ Revving up my aura/ Focus on my mind/ Taking my time/ I'm a new woman, woman,\" the K-pop star proudly announces on the chorus of the song before Rosalía slams on the brakes to sing and rap her way through a sultry verse in her native Spanish that translates, in part, to \"I was born pure, yes/ Not an era will be a flop in my future/ W—, I'm Rosalía, I only know how to serve.\"\n\nThe accompanying Dave Meyers-directed video is filled with high-fashion looks (thigh-high boots on fire, that massive, floor-sweeping pearl necklace…or is it made of ball bearings?), Y2K nostalgia (flip phones!) and a bevy of quirky, genuinely off-beat moments that will be sure to help drive the conversation as LISA continues to establish herself — and her nascent LLOUD partnership under RCA Records — as a global force in control of her musical destiny.\n\nBenson Boone — \"Pretty Slowly\"\n\nFresh off \"Death Wish Love\" — his folksy contribution to the Twisters soundtrack — Benson Boone uses his newest single \"Pretty Slowly\" to celebrate his sudden rise as one of pop music's shiniest new stars.\n\nThe deceptively upbeat track's lyrics reflect on the dissolution of a relationship lost to all the recent, stratospheric changes in his life as he croons, \"Oh, how come all the best things fall apart/ And it started pretty slowly/ When you asked about the old me/ Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone/ Oh, I don't know/ I think I left him somewhere I no longer go.\"\n\nHowever, the song's accompanying music video acts as a both a victory lap in the wake of his debut album, Fireworks & Rollerblade, from earlier this summer and and energetic peek into the \"Beautiful Things\" breakout's high-octane live show — complete with thousands of ecstatic fans and his signature, onstage backflips.\n\nYG — 'Just Re'd Up 3'\n\nMore than a decade after his 2013 mixtape Just Re'd Up 2, YG adds to the series with the long-awaited Just Re'd Up 3.\n\nThe Compton native has released six other albums and a litany of other mixtapes and collaborative projects in the interim, and his decade-plus in the spotlight allows him to recruit a wide array of contemporaries for the two-disc LP — from Saweetie (\"SHE PRETTY\") and Ty Dolla $ign (\"IT'S GIVIN,\" \"RESCUE ME\") to Tee Grizzley and G Herbo (\"MALIBU\") and Lil Yachty and Babyface Ray (\"STUPID\").\n\nJean Dawson & Lil Yachty — \"Die For Me\"\n\n\"Die For Me,\" Jean Dawson's new collaboration with Lil Yachty, blends the experimental leanings of the L.A.-based polymath (and musical arranger on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER) with the bubblegum trap rapper's one-of-a-kind flow — and the result is magnetic.\n\nSonically, the swirling track feels like a logical follow-up to Bad Cameo, the \"Poland\" rapper's recent collaborative album with James Blake. After Dawson warbles the hook (\"Don't show up at my funeral/ If you won't die for me\"), Lil Yachty grabs the mic for a blunt-force eulogy that demands repeated listening.\n\nMorgan Wade — 'Obsessed'\n\nMorgan Wade preceded her fourth album, Obsessed, with delicate, heart-on-her-sleeve singles like \"2AM in London\" and \"Time to Love, Time to Kill.\" Arriving almost a year to the day since her previous full-length Psychopath, the country upstart — and occasional Real Housewives of Beverly Hills guest star — is just as vulnerable on the rest of the album.\n\nShowing off her aptitude for laying bare emotional storytelling and heart-crushing nostalgia, Wade cleverly exposes her fragilities and regrets across the album's 14 tracks — whether she's gender-flipping Shakespeare and competing with Romeo on the forbidden \"Juliet,\" finding somber inspiration in fairy tales on the wistful \"Hansel and Gretel,\" or duetting with Kesha on the repentant \"Walked on Water.\"\n\nFalling In Reverse — 'Popular Monster'\n\nSeven years since 2017's Coming Home, Falling In Reverse are back with their fifth studio album, Popular Monster. The LP's rollout has been spread across nearly half a decade, with the title track being released as the lead single way back in November 2019. Six additional singles have followed in the lead-up to the long-awaited project, including collaborations with Tech N9ne and Slaughter to Prevail vocalist Alex Terrible (\"Ronald\") and Jelly Roll (\"All My Life\"), as well as a reimagined cover of Papa Roach's \"Last Resort.\"\n\nAnd while Popular Monster's cover art is plastered with frontman Ronnie Radke's 2012 mugshot for alleged domestic assault, the release is hardly a solo project. In fact, it's the first Falling in Reverse album to feature Max Georgiev on guitar, Tyler Burgess on bass and Luke Holland on drums. (Derek Jones, the band's late rhythm guitarist, also contributed to the title track before his untimely death in 2020 from a subdural hematoma.)\n\nDJ Snake & Fridayy — \"Complicated\"\n\nFridayy is practically begging to keep things simple on \"Complicated,\" his yearning, pulsating new collaboration with DJ Snake. \"Tell me what you want/ Girl, I want to know/ Please don't make it complicated/ We ain't gotta complicate it,\" he repeats over the DJ's hypnotic rhythms filled with Spanish guitar and distant jungle sounds.\n\nEventually, the three-time GRAMMY nominee's desperate pleas morph into an atmospheric echo as DJ Snake's handiwork takes center stage, plunging the track into a spellbinding synth breakdown that dances all the way to the finish.\n\nThe Latest Pop Music News & Releases"
