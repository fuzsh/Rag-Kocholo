        "text": "Jon Dixon\n\nEver since he could remember, Jon Dixon has had a passion for music. Jon began playing by ear at the age of four and has always enjoyed challenging himself by learning music in this manner. He began reading and studying classical piano at the age of 15 while enrolled at The High School For Fine and Performing Arts where he also studied jazz with Mr. Edward Quick. Upon graduating, he began performing with the Detroit Symphony Civic Jazz Orchestra under the direction of Detroit's own Godfather of jazz, the late Marcus Belgrave. While performing locally with this ensemble, he also attended Wayne State University where he studied jazz piano under Matt Michaels. As time went on, word of mouth began to spread about Dixon and his talents.\n\nWhile in college he accompanied The Mosaic Youth Theater of Detroit as an accompanist/bandleader for their productions and concerts as well as performed all over the city and state. Jon currently teaches multiple group piano classes at the Michigan State University Community Music School in Midtown Detroit. He has had the chance to also play for/with Chick Corea, Jeff Hamilton, Robert Hurst, Delfayo Marsalis, John Clayton, The Count Basie Orchestra, Marcus Belgrave, The Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Leon Ware, Eric Roberson, Dwele, Amp Fiddler and more over the past decade.\n\nRecently Dixon has been taking another approach towards music and production while currently working on various hi-tech jazz projects. In 2015 Jon started an independent label, 4EVR 4WRD (Forever Forward) to focus on making electronic music fused with elements of jazz, hip-hop, and other styles of music. \"I feel that it is important for me as a musician to not only continue the rich culture and history of both jazz and electronic music but to also use my knowledge, theory, and experience to combine the two and take both genres to the next level!\"\n\nJon has had the opportunity to not only lead the Underground Resistance live acts Galaxy 2 Galaxy and Timeline, but he has also performed with Interstellar Fugitives, Amp Fiddler, Jeff Mills, Mike Banks, Derrick May, Francesco Tristano, Carl Craig, Goldie and more. Dixon is one of the city's most sought-after musicians for every genre ranging from jazz to techno. He believes that the more versatile and open-minded you are at your craft, the further it will take you. Jon is currently working on multiple projects that are sure to be the beginnings of a new approach and chapter in Detroit's music history.\n\nJefferson Parish\n\nJefferson Parish is a fresh and innovative artist hailing from the valleys of Youngstown, Ohio, with a new sound and style that the world needs to hear! Jefferson has unique qualities as a musician, to say the least. Parish is not only a rapper but also a singer, producer, and songwriter.\n\nWorking with Nexus Sound Studio, Idorra Park Music, & B.Sharp Publishing, Jefferson Parish has been able to create an astonishing melodic and harmonic sound that combines and fuses various genres and styles of music together. This allows him to be as creative as possible and also appeals to an array of audiences of all ages. Parish was influenced by a multitude of musicians and artists from his younger years, growing up in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, LA.\n\nIn Louisiana, he learned piano, and violin, and was also in choir since he was eight years old and has always been a huge fan of literature. His fascination for words led him to write poetry and spoken word, which eventually led to writing songs. Parish is a very creative and unique artist, which is the key to making new and inventive music that we all desperately need. When Parish is not being a very busy and sought-after entrepreneur with his fashion line Muaegabi, Parish can be found producing and writing songs at the studio. With the multiple styles and sonics, It’s safe to say that Jefferson Parish has music for everyone to know and love.\n\nPatois\n\nPatois is the alt-pop moniker of Daniel Johnson. A native Detroiter, he began releasing music as Daniel in 2009, starting with the Bulbz EP for Ghostly sublabel Moodgadget, followed by three full-lengths, Lazrus, Extracolor, and Sicko, and the Hard Feelings EP, all repped by Downtown Music.\n\n“Stay With Me,” from Hard Feelings, was prominently featured in Beauty and the Beast on the CW network. A rework of the Lazrus cut “Hard Core” by his side project Avila was featured in MTV’s The Real L Word. Avila, for which Johnson produces and writes, has had their music featured in numerous commercial and TV campaigns for brands including Victoria’s Secret, Trojan, Orange is the New Black, The Bachelor, and Showtime’s The Affair.\n\nJohnson also works prolifically creating custom music for TV and commercials. His productions have included collaborations with Flint Eastwood’s Jax Anderson for ESPN and Luscius for Santander Bank.\n\nIn 2019 Johnson, feeling that the use of his first name for his solo work was so common as to be unsearchable, and wanting to refocus and recommit, adopted the new alias Patois.\n\nStratøs\n\nMichigan native Stratøs is a saxophonist, composer, producer, and film photographer whose presence in the modern jazz scene is rapidly growing. His improvisational style is rooted heavily in the subtle melodicism of the cool jazz tradition and extends to the bold, complex nature of the electronic jazz scene. His compositions explore a combination of elements between jazz and other styles such as hip-hop, metal, electronica and classical. Stratøs is the three-time winner of the Herb Alpert Young Jazz Composer Award from 2019-2021. Additionally, he was awarded the ASCAP Foundation’s Johnny Mandel Prize as well as being selected as a National Sawdust New Works Commission Contest winner. The latter granted the composer the opportunity to write for the world-renowned JACK Quartet.\n\nIn 2017, Stratøs began working with indie rock/R&B artist Charlie Burg. The saxophonist is featured in several of Burg’s works such as “Intentions” and “Lancaster Nights.\"\n\nStratøs’ latest project, Planets, is a full-length album entirely produced by the saxophonist which features the likes of Alekos Syropoulos (Mac Miller, Anderson .Paak, Vulfpeck), 2019 JUNO award nominee Andrew Rathbun, John Hébert (Fred Hersch, Maria Schneider), and renowned saxophonist/composer/producer David Binney (Donny McCaslin, Knower). The album is the amalgamation of the producer’s diverse musical identities. Reaching from the visceral, distorted sounds and grooves of the death metal world to the serene soundscapes akin to Hayao Miyazaki film scores, Planets seeks to connect a narrative throughline between these juxtaposing elements. The record was released on October 1st, 2021.\n\nMia Pixley\n\nMia Pixley, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and artist who uses her cello, voice, and music performance to study and represent aspects of self and other, community, and the natural world. Similar to the collaborative lens from which she approaches her psychotherapy practice, Mia’s artistic collaborations lead with curiosity, honesty, humility, and humor. Protectively whimsical and simultaneously melancholic, Mia’s music gravitates toward the beauty hidden in sorrow, pain, and loss and this beauty’s potential to inspire curiosity, wonder, rebirth, and reconnection to ourselves, each other, and the natural world. She has a professional studies diploma in cello performance from San Francisco Conservatory of Music (Class of ‘18). She has performed on GRAMMY award-winning albums and award-winning off-Broadway musicals. She tours regularly with Windham Hill Winter Solstice Tour and collaborates with artists both in the SF Bay Area and NYC. Mia lives in the California Bay Area with her husband and their son. She cares about community, interconnectivity, and nature. Mia just released her first full-length album titled Margaret in the Wild (2021), which you can find on streaming services and Bandcamp.\n\nLulu Fall\n\nLulu Fall is a singer, award-winning songwriter, and actor currently based in New York and Detroit. Lulu, a formally trained jazz vocalist with a musical theatre background, is one complete and unexpected package. As a product of Senegalese and Cameroonian parentage, her music reflects her global perspective by way of her American sensibilities.\n\nBecause Lulu has a background in musical theatre, she alternates between that and music. Among other shows, she was a performer in the Smithsonian’s American Songbook Program and an ensemble member in Studio Theatre’s adaptation of Passing Strange. She was also a featured ensemble member in the acclaimed hippie love-rock musical HAIR, both the first National tour and Broadway. Her off-broadway credits include Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812, the acclaimed porn musical Pretty Filthy, and the acclaimed folk-opera Hadestown. Lulu portrayed the character of Brenda in Capital Repertory’s production of Smokey Joe’s Cafe in Albany. Lulu was most recently in the Broadway production of Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812, and the off-Broadway productions of This Ain't No Disco and Wild Goose Dreams.\n\nWith a degree in Jazz Studies, Lulu attended Michigan State University. Lulu Fall independently released her debut EP, It’s Official in 2009, both in Washington DC and London. Her title track single can be found on Spotify. Lulu also independently released a collaborative EP, Heal: Part 1, with the LF+JT (Lulu Fall and James Theory) project in 2015. Lulu's latest collaborative project album, The Unpaved Road, was released in August 2017 with writing partner Kris Johnson. This full-length album can be found on all major music platforms ( iTunes, Spotify, CD Baby) as well as the Artist Centric Music label website. The latest video single from this album, entitled \"Painfully Sober,\" was exclusively released by AFROPUNK. Some of Lulu’s music performances include the Winter Music Conference in Miami, FL, Blues Alley in Washington, DC, Langnau Jazz Nights Festival in Switzerland, Jazz Re:freshed in London, and Cliff Bell’s in Detroit, MI. Lulu was a finalist in the 4th annual Sarah Vaughan International Vocal Jazz Competition. Lulu won the Mid-Atlantic Song Competition (MASC) and was awarded gold and silver for her songs “Fight” and “No Better” in the R&B category. Her single “Pretty For a Dark Girl” was awarded TOP 5 WINNER in the R&B category of the Great American Song Contest. Lulu is set to release her next album, Between Two Worlds, on November 8th, 2019 under Ropeadope Records.\n\nLove Axe\n\nSitting somewhere between the orchestral chamber pop roots of Randy Newman and the melted soundscapes of Ween, each song on Love Axe’s new full-length THE FOOD creates its own unique atmosphere. “This is a record for the desperate weirdo in everyone,” songwriter Chris Hatfield (Those Transatlantics) says. Embracing pop in a more ravenous way than before, the songwriting envelops Stevie Wonder through a smartphone funk of Unknown Mortal Orchestra on opener “Do The Transform,” and standout single “Give Me A Kiss.” The soaring aughts-pop crunch of “Black Out The Sun” hearkens back to the guitar and heartbreak-soaked South Dakota days, giving the album a solid grip to launch itself into unfamiliar waters. The record is shot through with power pop careen (“Parasite,” “Armageddon Stuff”) and dance floor oblivion (“I Can Find You,”) before finding a bittersweet ache on “Do What You Want To” and “Sympathy,” bringing to mind the effortless pop immediacy of Jenny Lewis.\n\nConceived and recorded over a period of five years in LA’s Frogtown neighborhood, THE FOOD was originally intended to be a country album. “I started the record with this one shitkicker of a song that kept getting pushed back by the next one I’d write,” says Hatfield. “Eventually, nothing started making sense until I surrendered to my true motivations,” which, along with the usual components of fear and loathing, was “anything that felt significantly deranged enough compared to the last record. The result is a genre-destroying, technicolor achievement fueled by undeniable grooves and alternative-universe pop songwriting.\n\nThe album also sees contributions from both erstwhile and new collaborators, including original Love Axe drummer Heath Johnson and bassist/vocalist Joelle Barrios, drummer Amber Barnard and multi-instrumentalist Todd Boepple, and on “Think”, the album’s pop triumph centerpiece, a collaboration with Grammy-winning chameleon Andrew Dost. The communal feel of the record embraces and encourages its eclectic nature. THE FOOD swings in all directions, inhabiting a charmingly sincere wrecking ball with enough momentum for the desperate, inner weirdo in each of us.\n\nKris Johnson\n\nKris Johnson is an award-winning trumpeter, composer, and educator. He has appeared on five Grammy-nominated albums and composed the original score for the four-time Emmy-nominated web series King Ester.

Based in Los Angeles, they breathe bewilderment into their generous collaborations bringing you undiluted sincerity. They are an interdependent artist, rather than an independent one. Through the use of undulating vocals captured on a Telefunken TF-29 Copperhead, expansive Ableton production, NS electric violin, and Fender's Tenor Tele, their collaboration with companies as well as their musical collaborators beckons listeners to celebrate the magnificent as well as the mundane.\n\nTheir release, \"Blastin Pastem,\" with Zhao, broadcast on NPR as a top tune, premiered on KCRW's most popular show, Morning Becomes Eclectic, and was played by KCRW DJs Valida, Novena Carmel, Anne Litt, Raul Campos, and Aaron Byrd.

Their first production credits, \"Flowers\" and “A Poem Called Here” by Def Sound, also graced KCRW airways by way of several DJs.\n\nHEY DONNIE!\n\n‘HEY DONNIE!” (p/k/a Don Neil) has been making a name for himself in the music scene since 2017.\n\nFrom his self-released single \"Hey Donnie\" supported by Rap Nation, he has been able to garner co-signs from platinum producer K Swisha (Produced \"Lil Donnie,\" \"Tell The World.\") and viral sensation Lonely God (Produced “Get Goin,” “Get Goin 2 ft. NUT!!!). As well as having support from platforms such as Lyrical Lemonade, Rap Nation, Promoting Sounds, RESPECT MAG, and many more.\n\nBorn in 1997, Don Neil is a young, hungry, and most importantly, talented rap artist from Baltimore, whose musical influences range from Kid Cudi, J. Cole, and Chance The Rapper. In listening to Don's music, you can easily hear that he is not like the average artist talking about a negative lifestyle. Far from corny, Don's music has a message that conveys that it's okay to be young and not sure of which road to take, but at the same time, have motivation, be patient, have fun, and learn to smile while enjoying the process.\n\nPenny EAU\n\nAlternative and atmospheric indie artist Penny Eau knows there is power in her words. The US-born singer grew up in the performing arts space but never felt quite at home in America. At 18, she moved to Liverpool, England to attend Paul McCartney’s Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. In Liverpool, her artistry and maturity blossomed, and she realized that this, performing, is what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. Since graduating Penny has worked internationally between Norway, the UK, and Los Angeles.\n\nPenny has success as not only an artist but also a writer, vocalist, and producer. She has had radio placements on BBC 6 and NRK P3 for her debut single \"Lavender & Gasoline.\" Other recent accomplishments include her cover of \"New York, New York\" with Daemon and Zech Biship being featured in the Shonda Rhimes-helmed Netflix Original miniseries Inventing Anna and original \"Zeros and Ones\" being placed in MTV's Teen Mom.

She’s performed at the 2021 Vegan Camp Out, the Liverpool Digital Music Festival, London’s O2 Academy Islington, and the Liverpool International Music Festival.\n\nPenny’s songs paint a picture with their hyper-metaphorical lyrics, with topics ranging from heartbreak to climate change. She takes inspiration from genre-bending experimental artists such as Bon Iver, James Blake, and The 1975, and from her passions for veganism, sustainability, mental health acceptance, and destigmatizing the struggle of addiction, having dealt with the latter two herself. Penny Eau is a wholly unique artist, and her signature blend of cinematic flair combined with her haunting voice will make sure you’ll never forget her.\n\nRonnie Riggles\n\nRonnie Riggles is a rapper, multi-faceted creative, and community outreach leader in his hometown of Philadelphia, PA.
