Since 2008, Kennedy has released 5 independent mixtapes, most notably his 2010 critically acclaimed mixtape From the Westside with Love.

His song \"My Type of Party\" was ranked by Complex at #43 in the magazine's Best 50 Songs of 2012 list.\n\nEarly life\n\nDom Kennedy was born on August 22, 1984 in Los Angeles, California. In an interview with music media outlet IMFlashy, Kennedy describes his childhood growing up as \"normal\". After his parents' divorce, Kennedy moved with his mother to Leimert Park. Kennedy played baseball to get out of the inner city to stay safe and out of trouble. He also played basketball everyday from the age of five to the age of 16. Upon graduating from Santa Monica high school, Kennedy enrolled in Santa Monica College, a two-year junior college in California, majoring in business management. In an interview with Dr. Josh Hamilton in October 2012, Dom gave his reasoning on why he entered college and what his plan B would be.\n\n\"I mainly focused on business management while I was there, not really thinking about music per se at first, but just on life. You know, [...] if I wasn't rapping or doing anything with music that was kind of where I saw myself in the world. I always hoped I could be an entrepreneur, you know I guess, but thats the aspirations of many people but I just felt like if I was going to learn about anything I might as well learn about structures of corporations, or at least find out everyone's job.\"\n\nMusic career\n\nWorking with his cousin Jason Madison, Kennedy released his debut mixtape album 25th Hour in 2008, instantly producing a buzz throughout the south side of L.A.

In an interview with MTV News reporter James Lacsina, Kennedy described the project as something that was a testament to himself in the rap game as well as the city he proudly represents:\n\nWith The Original Dom Kennedy, it was a time for me to take a stand in music. The way we grew up and our lifestyle, being kids from the inner city of Los Angeles. I just felt like that was missing.\n\nKennedy also took a personal stance in the mixtape against major hip hop DJ and producer Funkmaster Flex.\n\nIn 2011, Kennedy performed at premier film festival South by Southwest's Music Matters Show in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

With his music, Kennedy does the same thing, bringing the feel of the inner city streets of L.A. to anyone willing to listen. In an interview with Hip Hop DX, Kennedy talks about the influence behind the L.A. sound in his music:\n\nIf anything, and I can only speak for myself, I think that I’m trying to do it like DJ Quik did it, or Ice Cube did it, but this is just my way of doing it therefore I guess it’s natural. But I’m not trying to do anything, you know, different or to say, ‘This is new.’... I set out to do it the way they did it, just in my own way.\n\nKennedy has rapped over a wide range of past and present hip hop beats in his career, consistently bringing the element of L.A. and West Coast hip hop to his music. Such beats include Big Poppa on the track \"Notorious Dom\" (25th Hour) and Best I Ever Had on the track \"Best You Never Had\" (Best After Bobby).
