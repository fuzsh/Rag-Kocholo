        "text": "With some lyrics, you have to listen close, dig deep, and pay attention to notice the rhymes getting re-used throughout the rap game. Other times, it’s in the damn name of the song. Of all the artists guilty of that misdemeanor, we included only a few here, alongside places where the lyric pops up spontaneously. And when we say spontaneously, we really mean “regurgitating s**t you heard on your local hip-pop radio station earlier that day.” In these artists’ defense, however, most of us do spend a decent amount of our lives watching movies, so chances are you’re going to have seen at least one that reminds you of your life. Might as well tell your fans, right? After all, for some listeners, that is the illusion they’re buying and/or downloading.\n\n#5 — Busta Rhymes ft. J Doe: ‘Movie’\n\n“I do it like a movie/ My life is a movie”\n\nI wonder if that was ghost-written or if it’s the type of thing he came up with in a brilliant flash of insight? J Doe, ladies and gentleman, he’s standing next to Busta Rhymes.\n\n#4 — Pitbull ft. Akon: ‘Shut it Down’\n\n“Now baby save me from my life before it blaze me/ My life is a movie, call me Martin Scorsese”\n\nAlthough the played-out phrase is not in the title of this song, Pitbull gets bonus points in the unoriginality department for re-using this line in multiple songs, (see his collabo with Usher, ‘DJ Got Us Fallin’ In Love’).\n\n#3 — K’naan: ‘My Life is a Movie’\n\n“My life is a movie, subtitle to sue me/ Action and drama filled with black Uzis”\n\nDon’t get it twisted, K’naan is an amazing poet and philosopher. This is from his pre-record deal demo and wasn’t chosen for the first album. The beat is a nice throwback, though.\n\n#2 — O-Bee: ‘Life is a Movie’\n\n“Real life, this is not TV/ My life is a movie”\n\nIf you’ve heard of Omer Bhatti, a.k.a. O-Bee, it’s likely due to his friendship with Michael Jackson, and because the Pakistani-Norwegian spent some time growing up on the Neverland Ranch. Other than that, could he make it on his own? Ummm, you decide.\n\n#1 — Future: ‘Tony Montana’\n\n“That money got me geeked, like I took a hit of coca/ My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused”\n\nFuture gets props for having a vague storyline to this video in a foreign country and… Well, I tried to find more nice things to say, but then the song ended. At least he went to a developing country and got a bunch of kids to dance behind him while he talked about dealing drugs and exploiting people. If Michael Jackson wasn’t already spinning in his grave for numerous reasons, expect there to be an underground tornado soon. If you don’t know what we’re talking about, check out this track:\n\nIt doesn’t recycle any rhymes that other artists in his time had used dozens of times, but the alternate version of this (filmed in Rio de Janeiro) is kind of what Future was trying to do. We’re gonna hit you with the other, “Prison Version” of this song, because you can see how clearly Michael had become influenced by hip-hop culture in this video. On this track, Michael sings “But if Roosevelt were living/ He wouldn’t let this be,” commenting on the state of America and the ills of the world in general.\n\nFeatured Lyrics: Now baby save me from my life before it blaze me my life is a movie, call me Martin Scorsese\n\nSHARE THIS:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSanta Claus and booty-clappin’ music never really went together. In fact, they would be in almost complete opposition to one another if St. Nick didn’t love people sitting in his lap. And while most American hip-hop artists do identify as Christian, it’s easy to forget that not everyone in the industry worships the same way. While Jewish rappers Drake, the remaining Beastie Boys, and Kosha Dillz have Hannukah to keep them involved in the holiday spirit, the sizable collection of Muslim hip-hop artists don’t have a holiday to get down with come the end of December. With them in mind, here’s a list of just a few rappers that won’t be decking the halls:\n\nRZA\n\nRobert Fitzgerald Diggs, also known as the RZA, is the producer behind the Wu-Tang Clan’s albums, as well as a solo emcee and prolific contributor to the Wu discography. While the RZA belongs to no Mosque, he is a member of the Five Percent Nation (officially the Nation of Gods and Earths), which incorporates an eclectic mix of religious teachings, including the Saudi-based teachings of Islam.\n\nQ-Tip\n\nQ-Tip, the driving force behind classic group A Tribe Called Quest, has Kamaal Ibn John Fareed written on his passport. The MC converted to Islam as an adult, changing his name to one from the Arabic tradition that gave birth to his new found faith.\n\nYasiin Bey\n\nYou may know Yasiin Bey by his old stage name, Mos Def, but Dante Terrell Smith, unlike Q-Tip, kept his legal name and changed his artistic identity to match his religion. Also a prolific and talented actor, Bey has been a major force in hip-hop since the 1990s, consistently creating some of the most intelligent lyrics in the industry and never sacrificing flow to get deep into the meaning behind the façade.\n\nTalib Kweli\n\nTalib Kweli’s parents put some serious thought into their son’s name. Talib is Arabic for “student” or “seeker,” while Kweli is a Swahili word meaning “true.” Dropping his last name (Greene), Kweli used the remainder as his stage name and soaked up the teachings his academic parents provided, including Islamic and African spiritual philosophies.\n\nBusta Rhymes\n\nFor Busta Rhymes, arguably the king of speed-rap, staying grounded has to do with one’s connection to the most high, whom he knows as Allah. Busta won’t be setting up a Christmas tree this year – or any, for that matter.\n\nT-Pain\n\nT-Pain has been a Muslim since childhood. Beyond his parents’ opinions on the artist’s career, we want to know what the imams in Mecca think about Apple Bottom Jeans. And for those of you saying T-Pain is a robo-singer, and not a rapper, take a look at his pre-record deal catalog – he wasn’t born a cyborg.\n\nBrother Ali\n\nBrother Ali gets his name from one of Islam’s most important figures, the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet Mohammed. The historical Ali was also the person around whom the Sunni/Shi’ite divisions began. This rapper isn’t at all about bloodshed though, as these lyrics might attest: “Just got married last year/ treated so good that it ain’t even fair/ already got a boy now the baby girl’s here/ Bought us a house like the Berenstein Bears.” That being said, he is using the Stars & Stripes as a prayer rug.\n\nK’Naan\n\nOut of all the rappers on this list, K’naan has probably tackled questions of faith most seriously: his newest album is even titled “Country, God, or the Girl.” One listen wasn’t enough for this writer to truly grasp the title, but I can assure you that his poetry is certainly worthy of his other nickname, The Dusty Foot Philosopher. Hailing from Somalia, K’naan was brought up in a deeply religious culture in a country torn apart by tribal war and ruled over by fundamentalist Islamic militias. Finding refuge in Toronto, New York, and elsewhere, K’naan has managed to at least find peace in his music.\n\nLupe Fiasco\n\nThis Chicago hip-hopper was born and raised Muslim, but also runs two clothing lines, which probably make the holiday season a lucrative time of year for this young rapper and entrepreneur.\n\nIce Cube\n\nAccording to Ice Cube, “Me and Allah go back like cronies/ I don’t got to be fake cause he is my homie.” If you’re on this site you probably know enough of Ice Cube’s other lyrics to find an opinion on that quote. Cube doesn’t celebrate Christmas, but he is one of the most important MCs of all time, an originator of gangster rap, and an extremely successful actor.\n\nSHARE THIS:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBelieve it or not, Poland is home to one of the biggest reggae scenes outside of Jamaica. Walk through the streets of Warsaw and you’ll quickly lose count of all the homegrown rastas rocking dreads and Bob Marley tees, and the hip-hop-infused dancehall songs by local artists that you’ll hear on the radio or in the club. Among the new school of Polish MCs, GrubSon is one of the most successful, earning platinum plaques in his home country by combining rudeboy dancehall toasting and classic NYC flow.\n\nThough he’s only 26, GrubSon’s been in the game for a minute, beginning his rap career at age 12 in his hometown of Rybnik, when he was inspired by his older brother to release his first unofficial tape in 2003. Since then, he’s collaborated with several Polish crews, including Super Group, East West Rockers Sound System, and 3oda Kru, before signing to MaxFloRec Records and releasing several milli-selling solo joints. Both an MC and singer, GrubSon can switch between reggae, dancehall, and hip-hop styles with ease, making him one of the more versatile spitters anywhere in the world. His command of multiple flows has enabled him to release music as diverse as 3oda Kru’s goofy, Busta Rhymes-esque rap to his more smoothed-out solo material:\n\nIn 2009, GrubSon released his solo debut, “O.R.S.,” featuring tracks like the celebratory ‘Na szczycie’ (‘On Top’). The dusty beat is reminiscent of early ’90s NYC beatmakers such as Q-Tip and Boogie Down Productions’ Scott LaRock, who laced their tracks with a strong dancehall vibe. The track’s bombastic horns make a perfect backdrop for GrubSon’s half-rapped, half-sung verses, which wouldn’t have sounded out of place on a early-2000s Ja Rule album.\n\nGrubSon’s sense of humor also sets him apart from the masses of mean-mugging hardcore Polish MCs. His 2011 song ‘JEA?!?,’ from sophomore album “Coś więcej niż muzyka” (“Something More Than Music”) flips the script from his usual style by shouting out Justin Timberlake over a cartoonish dance beat that samples ‘SexyBack.’ Check out his ill dance moves in the video:\n\nMost recently, GrubSon has released a collaborative LP, “Gruby Brzuch” (“Fat Belly”), with DJ BRK on the wheels of steel. The record has a stronger hip-hop influence than GrubSon’s solo records, with beats such as ‘Zacieszacz’ sounding like something Swizz Beats would have made for the Ruff Ryders circa 2000. It’s hard to predict what the MC’s next move will be, but given his eclectic mix of styles and unique sense of humor, we’re sure it’ll catch us by surprise.\n\nSHARE THIS:\n\nLike Loading..."
