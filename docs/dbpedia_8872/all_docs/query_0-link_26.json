        "text": "I’m not sure if Dom Kennedy would appeal to a hip-hop outsider: his flows are a little off-kilter; his rhymes often slow. But a couple of key early 2010s hip-hop moments helped me really appreciate this dude. The first is “Real Estates” from Curren$y’s Pilot Talk 2 (2010), an album that is (along with the preceding Pilot Talk) a benchmark for the kind of stoner rap music that doesn’t really exist anymore. “The game don’t get any realer” chirped Dom on his knot-tight “Real Estates” verse. Then 2012’s “Grooveline” (Schoolboy Q , 2012) verse showcased his relaxed playboy style, ending hilariously with a “Dom Kennedy” drop that sounds like a producer tag.\n\nI never followed him enough to track a new release, but when Frank Ocean included “T P O” on his blonded radio it seemed like a good idea to check out this album. “T P O” is a mellow slap, immediately memorable for the beat’s harpsichord melody, but it’s also funny: “I was young, but I went to the Grand Canyon once / Now I’m at a stripper house makin’ tacos, rollin’ blunts.” The song exemplifies this album as a whole, which is Dom Kennedy at his best: a realist who is cool, confident and relatable, with fantastic production choices. Clearly following the mold of 90s LA g-funk, “Dominic, Pt. 2” updates the style with fantastic synth notes.\n\nIn college I fantasized about living in California and listening to “California”, and now I can finally do it. Something about the drums on this one… I would play this over and over again on my little wired earbuds walking around in the cold Pennsylvania winter daydreaming about life in Cali. “Wake up at 1:30, In-N-Out ‘fore it close / Catch me in the drive-thru, then spin out on these hoes.” Sounds like a good time, man… my plays of “California” dwarf the rest of the album.\n\nI think sometimes Dom Kennedy is unintentionally funny or irreverent. Like, “Since We’re Telling the Truth” is ostensibly a love song, but the chorus ends with “I could have a statue downtown.” The lyrics “Even if I was starvin’ / I’m the type to pass on baloney / Walkman by Sony / I’m big as Tony, Toni, Tone,” read like Riff Raff bars, but they’re delivered earnestly over the heavenly beat of “When I’m Missin’ U”. Maybe it’s just the nostalgia, but I see these as pluses.\n\nThis album was not received well. You have to really dig Dom as a kind of normal-guy-who-likes-hanging-out if you want to sit through this whole record, which could be 3-4 tracks shorter. But revisiting it today it still strikes me as underrated.\n\nListen to Los Angeles Is Not For Sale, Vol.1 here.\n\nI first discovered this one in 2016, and revisiting it recently I thought, “this is definitely the best thing Kool Keith’s ever done”. But then I was like, wait, Sex Style is really good… actually, The Cenubites is really good… actually, Critical Beatdown is REALLY good. And that’s not to mention any of the 25(!) or so albums Keith has released so far this millennium, most of which I haven’t heard. So you can’t really jump to a clear best with this guy.\n\nKeith was and always has been a trailblazer, and this is clear from the title and cover here alone. The damn Elvis wig… and with the flashy, turn-of-the-millennium neon green style this looks more like an N*Sync album cover than a rap record. But what lies within is hardly pop or R&B. It’s Keith’s signature bizzaro-rap, a two-sided journey through the mind of a hip-hop visionary.\n\nWhereas Dan the Automator produced the bulk of Keith’s most popular Dr. Octagonecologyst (1996), Keith handles the production here himself (with frequent collaborator Kutmasta Kurt assisting). The result is a consistent and original sound, with enough synths and beeps to fit the space theme, but enough bass and kick to feel like pure hip-hop.\n\nKeith’s rap style is wild because he has an effortless cool (he was well over a decade deep in the rap game by the time of this recording) but he’s also a weird motherfucker. “Keep it simple, baby young girl / Now squeeze your pimple,” he raps on “Static”. This Sadat X feature is great because Sadat is another OG who also has an idiosyncratic and funny style, like when he starts singing “our house in the middle of our street” in the middle of his verse. “The year 2005…” Keith begins on “Lost in Space”, which is more “Star Trekkin'” than any other rap song I can think of. These are just a couple of highlights early on.\n\nAs good as the Lost in Space side is here, I think I would give the win to Black Elvis, the second half of this record. Kid Capri sets it off, and then “Black Elvis” and “Maxi Curls” have some of the fastest rapping on the album, Keith dropping his Supreme Clientele-like stream-of-consciousness raps (except this album came first). “The Girls Don’t Like the Job” is one of the best examples of Keith’s uniqueness: his weird falsetto chorus and strange subject matter – “With a loan from General Mills I would start a new NBA team in Baldwin Hills: / The Baldwin Hills Spacemen / Lime green uniforms… I ripped up four tickets to the Grammy Awards”. “Clifton” features Keith’s perfect foil Motion Man, probably the only guy on his level of bizarre. No strangers to alter egos, they appear here as “Clifton Santiago” and “Keith Televasquez”, a duo of sex-crazed bandits. Things get rounded out with “All the Time” (one of the more straightforward tracks here) and “I Don’t Play”, which was lyrically interpolated by Deftones on “Back to School”, the first track on White Pony – this should probably tell you something about the reach of Kool Keith’s influence.\n\nThree months ago, Keith released Black Elvis 2, a sequel 24 years in the making. I haven’t heard it, but he’s on tour now. By the time he plays San Francisco in October, he’ll be 60. For this year’s “Hip-Hop Turns 50” reflections, Kool Keith described himself as “a one-person Parliament-Funkadelic” to The New York Times. And like George Clinton, it’s amazing to look back at his wide body of work and marvel at the fact that he’s still doing it.\n\nListen to Black Elvis / Lost in Space here.\n\nWait, that album cover’s not crazy enough… hold on…\n\nThere we go.\n\nDeeper than Encyclopedia Brittanica…\n\nIn 2006, XXL ran an online piece on the 90s label Suave House. Black Ice, the writer of the article, states that “starting completely independent in 1993 and then getting national distribution through Relativity Records and eventually Universal, Suave opened the floodgates in the mid-90s for Southern imprints to secure support from major labels,” and that the artists on the label lived in an actual house together.\n\nPresumably this group included 8Ball & MJG, Memphis hip-hop legends who released their first four albums on Suave House, years before becoming immortalized on Three 6 Mafia’s “Stay Fly”. Though they work best as a duo, I’ve recently found a lot to enjoy on 8Ball’s solo debut Lost. A double-album (technically a triple-album if you include the Suave House sampler bonus disc, which is not streaming) largely forgotten in the 90s rap canon, it is remarkably consistent in style and quality, with great guest features and an even better solo performance. In this way it reminds me of E-40’s The Element of Surprise, one of my favorite double-albums ever.\n\n40 Water is present here, along with Goodie Mob, Busta Rhymes, and of course MJG. But Ball shines brightest. On single “My Homeboy’s Girlfriend”, he spins a tale that is both hilarious and tragic, and sings the hook. His storytelling is in full effect on this track and “Time”, a dramatic reminiscence on a friendship gone sour. There are straight-up bangers too, like the MJG-featuring “Let’s Ride” and the penultimate “Gett Bucked” (classic Memphis phrase right there). My favorite guest spot comes from Redman, who in the late 90s was just scorching every feature (see also: The Luniz “Hypnotize”).\n\nThis is one of those albums that is so long you really can’t mention every track. The production is all in-house and somewhat dated, and there is some filler here and there. But it’s worth a look, especially if you’ve checked out 8Ball and MJG’s high-water mark On Top of the World and want more.\n\nListen to Lost here.\n\nI’d like to dedicate this post to De La Soul’s Dave, AKA Trugoy, who passed away recently. On 2Pac’s 1995 track “Old School”, Pac reminisces on the incomparable times and artists who shaped him, and De La are namedropped in the first verse. I think that begins to illustrate how important and influential De La are, and Dave was a core part of that.\n\nRewind to 1991: Despite the goofy title, 2Pacalypse Now is a remarkably mature and political debut album from a 19-turning-on-20 year old soon-to-be-superstar, one that laid the groundwork for music like Kendrick’s To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\nAs exemplified in Kendrick’s “Mortal Man”, 2Pac was incredibly prescient. His first single, “Trapped”, is a 5-minute story of racial profiling. Although it lacks some of the more profoundly emotional delivery of his later work, “Trapped” is a strong and unified lyrical display. It serves as not only a strong start to Pac’s rap career but a signpost of what may be his most overtly political full-length. You can hear the roots of Kendrick’s style on “Words of Wisdom”: it’s a jazzy interlude which finds Pac rewriting the etymology of the n-word and fast-paced rapping about America’s racial suppression.\n\nDuring these nascent stages of Pac’s rap career, he was in the Bay area recording this album in Richmond. As he would go on to rap on the title track of his second album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., “I’m comin’ out of O-Town, bitch, fuck around”. That album would find Tupac at his most aggressive, whereas 2Pacalypse is more relaxed in production and delivery. “Soulja’s Story” employs the same smoky Isaac Hayes sample (“No Name Bar”) as Tommy Wright and DJ Paul would (separately) employ later for some defining Memphis atmosphere.\n\n“I Don’t Give a Fuck” finds Pac with couplets that set 2Pacalypse firmly in the early 90s, rap’s Golden Age: “And now they tryna send me to Kuwait? / Give me a break… Who’s that behind the trigger? / A motherfuckin’ 90s ni**a.” It’s a blueprint for the young Shakur, one that he would re-shape and transcend until his death.\n\n“Brenda’s Got a Baby” is probably the most popular song from 2Pacalypse, but in its intensely melodramatic presentation is also one of the most dated. Still, it’s a classic storytelling rap in the conscious style. This one and the Stevie Wonder quoting “Part Time Mutha”, with its strange placement as an album closer, are probably the only 2 tracks here I would skip.\n\nFor the amount of music he recorded and the impact he has on pop culture, it’s still mind-boggling how short 2Pac’s career was. Killed in 1996 less than 3 months after his 25th birthday, Pac had spent nearly all of 1995 in prison, a superstar missing in action. Listening to 2Pacalypse today is like watching a fuse get lit. It’s a reminder that even in the beginning, 2Pac was something special.\n\nListen to 2Pacalypse Now here.\n\nI didn’t know much about Black Rob before he passed in 2021, except his song “Can I Live” with The LOX, which has a beautiful beat and finds Styles P fantasizing about “hang-glid[ing] to the Alps with a fly chick”. One of Bad Boy’s most promising artists after Biggie’s passing, Rob was featured on Motown’s “I Want You Back ’98”, a Jackson 5 remix that dropped, strangely, not 30 but 29 years after the original. Why this track was made, I’m not sure, but rapping on a track with (the then-living) Michael Jackson must have been a promising early-career move for Rob.\n\nWhat followed in 1999 was the recording of Rob’s debut Life Story, including the smash lead single “Whoa!”, which has largely held up well (other than the f-slur). The Buckwild beat is bonkers, and Black Rob sells the single title as a catchall response to anything remarkable. Also worth pointing out is the 8-minute remix with Rah Digga, Beanie Sigel and more. Whoa.\n\nBut Life Story is a surprisingly solid front-to-back album. The title track is captivating as a wistful growing-up-in-the-ghetto song (“living in this tenement, eating stale Entenmann’s”). Rob’s character is quickly established: a hard-nosed jailbird who perseveres through life struggles by rapping. Somewhat unexpectedly, CeeLo Green appears as the album’s first rap feature on “Lookin’ at Us”, and he kills it. Sometimes I forgot how good at rapping CeeLo is. Then we have a Bad Boy posse cut with Diddy, Mase and G-Dep on “Down the Line Joint”.\n\nLater on, “B.R.” is some expert noir-rap with gritty rhymes and the beat to match. “Thug Story” is a Slick Rick callback, and “Jasmine” is steel-drum infected storytelling rap. “I Love You Baby” originally appeared on the Puff & The Family album No Way Out (1997), which went 7x Platinum. Things wrap up with some pep on “I Dare You” (that’s after the J-Lo feature). I really like this album. It’s packed to the gills but there is nary a garbage track to be found. God bless Black Rob.\n\nListen to Life Story here.\n\nThis release from two LA-to-the-core hip-hop artists is an overlooked joint project. It’s a merging of two different generations: The 31-year-old Domo Genesis cut his teeth as a member of Tumblr-era phenoms Odd Future, and the 46-year-old Evidence co-founded the group Dilated Peoples in the 90s. What the two have in common is a laidback, uncomplicated approach to rap music. While this trait may have kept both artists from achieving the mainstream success achieved by some of their peers, it rewards listeners as they age with confidence and consistency in their respective outputs.\n\nEvidence and Domo first collaborated on 2017’s “Deez Nuts”, a Domo track produced by Evidence. A year later, Ev rapped on Domo’s “Fuck a Co-Sign”, from his brief yet excellent Arent U Glad Youre U tape. Evidence produced the entirety of last year’s Intros, Outros and Interludes, and his beats are absolutely lush. I find myself playing this album early in the morning as it relaxes me. “Trust the Process” finds Doms riding over a 70s soul sample, his lyrics unadorned observation: “This hash is in my lungs / a bunch of plastic in the ocean”. The sunny “Stay One More Day” sample fades in and out as Evidence proves himself a master beatmaker.\n\nEv’s one guest verse is smooth: “Drive slow, homie / Like my son is in the car / My summers as a kid in Brooklyn made me to a star”. This is a reference to canon hip-hop (Late Registration), a sly nod to his age, and a reflection on his come-up in one rhyme. Domo follows with “I never had a chance / I lose my life to seek a new one, look we movin’ through the dance”. It’s just two guys ruminating on how they got where they are, but in the context of the album it feels almost like a passing of the torch moment.\n\nThe beat on “December Coming” is heavenly, another delicious piece of a brief yet worthy album from two rap devotees. Here’s hoping they team up again.\n\nListen to Intros… here.\n\nIt’s been a little while since Jeremih dropped a project. Despite some smash hits throughout the last 13 years or so, his last album was Late Nights in 2015. While that album was critically and commercially successful, I feel that its mixtape follow-up Late Nights: Europe is under-appreciated. Recorded largely on the road during a European tour, Late Nights: Europe feels like an off-the-cuff project that shows just how fire Jeremih was coming off the success of Late Nights.\n\nTalking to Billboard in 2016, Jeremih said “in Europe… I brought my homie Soundz out with me. I was trying out new treatments while performing. After a lot of the shows, we’d set up small little booths in the hotel room, which I had never done before. Over the last week and a half or two weeks, we came up with a body of work, like 20 songs.”\n\n“Amsterdam” was always my favorite song here. It’s one of 10 songs here produced by Soundz, who made Rae Sremmurd’s “Throw Sum Mo” (amongst other things), and the bass-heavy track provides ample room for Jeremih to breathe. It’s also a track that sticks closely to the theme, with references to the red light district and smoking weed (sounds like Jeremih had a good time in Amsterdam).\n\nSetlist.fm indicates that Jeremih played a show in Beirut on July 9, 2016. Whether or not he played “Lebanon” there, it sounds like he had a good-ass time there too, as it’s one of the most fun and explicit tracks on the tape. “Belgium” features Chicago’s trademark juke production. “Paris” is a collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign, who appeared on the Late Nights album and would eventually make a full-length project with Jeremih (2018’s excellent MihTy). I really like that a song called “Oslo, Norway (feat. The Game)” by Jeremih even exists (and it’s good, too!) Things round out back in Jeremih’s hometown with “The Crib”, a tribute to Chicago, appropriately featuring G Herbo.\n\nSome of my favorite YouTube comments on the Late Nights: Europe songs:\n\n“I be listening to this while travelling Europe wit the love of my life” (“Czech Republic”)\n\n“This tune is real UK underground… dance done… real road underground… dance hall business. it was prevalent in the 90’s Loose Ends, Cool Notes, Janet Kay, Matumbii etc there is a lot to name so I am most certainly not excluding the great artists of that period of UK Lovers Rock, so it’s nice to see that it’s reformatted for the 2000’s similar to what Vybes Kartel has done with Dance Hall basheee…. and Popcaan. The tune is tappa tappa.” (“London”)\n\n“Ayyye” (“Amsterdam”)\n\n“I know my ex playing this with some one else 😂😂😂😂” (“British Headboards”)\n\nListen to Late Nights: Europe here.\n\nCan I call this the last great Future project? I’m not mad at him for making 22-track albums that rehash the same territory he’s been in for years – his output from Pluto (2012) to 56 Nights (2015) is still unfuckwithable, and he’s earned the fandom that allows him to operate on cruise control.\n\nBut Beastmode 2 stands out among the mixed bag of Future projects over the last 5 years. Like the first Beast Mode (2015), Zaytoven – truly the Beethoven of trap-rap production – handles all the beats here, and the chemistry is palpable. Beastmode 2 is lean at 9 tracks, and holds up well in the era of bloated Deluxe editions.\n\nI appreciate that Future, who had scored a massive hit in 2017 with “Mask Off”, included his OG Young Scooter as the only guest on this tape. “Doh Doh” bangs, and it helps Beastmode 2 feel more like a classic early 2010s ATL tape than post-peak Future.\n\nIntrospective Future is good Future: see “When I Think About It” (“I’m droppin’ outta school but that didn’t stop my education”). This is the first of three superb songs that close out the project. “Some More” finds Fewtch gliding over an icy, beautiful beat. And “Hate the Real Me” finds Future at his most compelling. Like “Codeine Crazy” and “Throw Away” he is reckless, remorseful, self-sabotaging, all over the most thrilling production on the project. It’s a peak that puts a bow on an outstanding tape with a lot of replay value. As Future himself puts it – the music special… it’s a part of us.\n\nListen to Beastmode 2 here.\n\nIt can be easy to get stuck on Slum Village’s label debut Fantastic, Vol. 2 (2000), one of the finest hip-hop albums of any era. With J Dilla at the helm, it bumps and grooves on a level that is strictly more beautiful than other records. It’s not hard to see why Dilla has attained a legendary status, but his absence from Fantastic follow-ups (he left the group to focus on a solo career several years before his death in 2006) leaves them relatively underrated.\n\nTrinity is a great example of this. Take it on its own terms and it’s a very rewarding project. Despite a lack of Dilla’s production (only 3 tracks out of 23), the sound of Slum Village very much remains, in no small part due to the presence of founding member T3 on the boards as well as Detroit producers of the same ilk like Waajeed and Black Milk. Baatin’s trademark voice (similar to Q-Tip’s) carries along from the first album, and a young Elzhi (!) joins as a welcome addition to the crew.\n\n“Tainted”, produced by Roots-affiliate Karriem Riggins and featuring Dwele, is an early highlight with one of the few classic SV videos. Elzhi sounds energized all over the project, with his verse on “La La” standing out as a particular scorcher. “One” has one of the wackiest Dilla beats I know of, with a twinkly piano sample and a punching drum. “Slumber” bangs with a beat courtesy of Hi-Tek.\n\nAt nearly 70 minutes, Trinity could have done with some trimming. I mean, there are 2 intros on this thing. Still, for fans of Fantastic and hip-hop in general, Trinity has a lot to give.\n\nListen to Trinity here."
