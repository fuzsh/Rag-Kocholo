        "text": "With the holiday cheer in the air, there's no better way to celebrate the winter season than cozying up on the couch and watching one of Netflix's latest additions: Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: A Midwinter’s Tale. It's a brand new episode of the Sabrina series out as of December 14, a holiday special to give viewers a little something as they wait for CAOS Part 2. In A Midwinter's Tale, we get to see how the Spellmans and the coven celebrate the winter holiday season—namely, by partying for the winter solstice. Meanwhile, it looks like most mortals in Greendale are fine with your typical Christmas fesivities.\n\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina episode is full of details you might have missed on your first watch, mostly callbacks and references to other yuletide stories. Totally understandable, because there's plenty of other fun shenanigans happening during the episode. But let’s run through what you may have overlooked, shall we? (Note: spoilers ahoy for Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: A Midwinter's Tale below).\n\nThe Winter’s Tale\n\nThe episode’s title—A Midwinter’s Tale—could be a reference to the famed Shakespeare play known as The Winter's Tale. There aren’t any exact plot similarities between the play and the CAOS holiday special, but thematically, there is a connection: both deal with drama surrounding children (and specifically, a baby girl whose origins are called into question and who is subsequently sent away, though I’m really oversimplifying The Winter’s Tale here). In Shakespeare’s play, Perdita comes back (spoiler alert). Does this mean that we’ll be seeing Leticia again one day?\n\nA Christmas Carol\n\nCharles Dickens’ classic is mentioned a few times throughout A Midwinter’s Tale, but two references stood out as particularly interesting. The first is when Sabrina says, “Satan bless us, every one,” a clear play on Tiny Tim’s best-known quote from A Christmas Carol: \"God bless us, every one!\" As always, the CAOS iteration serves to drive home the point that the Spellman family worships Satan, not any other entity. Second, as the episode comes to a close and Ambrose reads to the family from A Christmas Carol about a visitation when the bell tolls one, we see three demons come out of the Greendale mines and hear a bell chiming one time. As you might remember, there are three ghosts that visit Scrooge in A Christmas Carol along with his former business partner Jacob Marley: the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. Are the Spellmans about to get some more visitors? Guess we’ll have to wait until April 5th to see.\n\nIconic Comic Book Art\n\nAs tempting as it may be to press \"Skip Intro\" when it pops up as an option on Netflix, those who resisted and watch the full A Midwinter’s Tale opening credits were treated to a reference to the original Sabrina the Teenage Witch comic books: a wintery tableau picturing comic Sabrina and her aunts watching Santa and his reindeer fly through the sky (it comes up when there's 54:15 left of the episode). Fun throwback! And you may also have noticed that Madame Satan’s gingerbread cookie versions of the Spellman women mirror how they were depicted in the comics, as well.\n\nBartel\n\nYou may have heard of the child-punishing Krampus (personally, I became familiar with the demonic figure of folklore thanks to Dwight Schrute in The Office) and as it turns out, Bartel is similar to Krampus in Austrian culture. In CAOS, Bartel the demon punishes children by dipping them in wax and turning them into figurines for his Christmas display. That’s enough to give anyone holiday season nightmares.\n\nGryla\n\nIn CAOS, Gryla is a witch who lives in the mountains, taking in and taking care of lost children (see below) as penance for once killing and eating her own son (this show really likes to dabble with cannibalism, huh?). In Icelandic mythology, Gryla is a giant who, similarly, lives in the mountains. According to lore, she seeks out misbehaving children and turns them into stew and became linked to Christmas (and the Yule Lads) in the 1600s.\n\nYule Lads\n\nIn A Midwinter’s Tale, the Spellman house is terrorized by Yule Lads, poltergeist-like spirits who are typically taken care of by Gryla. They relish in causing mischief throughout the house, until Gryla comes to collect them and bring them back to the mountains. Yule Lads are also figures from Icelandic lore, ranging from the mischievous to the murderous. The ring of shoes pictured at Gryla’s fire toward the end of the episode could be a nod to the Yule Lads of folklore placing goodies into children's’ shoes in the days leading up to Yule/Christmas.\n\nA Missing Scene\n\nThere’s a scene in the trailer for A Midwinter’s Tale that doesn’t show up in the actual episode. It depicts Sabrina watching a man (perhaps Edward, her father?) hand over a baby to the Dark Lord in the wintery woods. Is this a scene that got cut for time? Will we see it in CAOS: Part 2 in April? And what does it mean?\n\nBeetlejuice\n\nIt’s not an exact recreation by any means, but the séance scene in A Midwinter’s Tale, wherein Sabrina and the Weird Sisters attempt to contact Sabrina’s mother, Diana—using her wedding dress, which Sabrina also wore on the 16th birthday/Halloween/dark baptism—is reminiscent of the séance scene in Beetlejuice (1988). In the movie, Geena Davis’s character is brought to the séance and fills out the wedding dress lying in the middle of the table—just like Diana does. Show-runner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa told Vanity Fair that the nod is intentional. Pretty cool reference, CAOS!\n\nThe Witch\n\nI was forced to watch 2015's The Witch on Halloween this year by some friends, so this connection was fresh in my mind when I was watching A Midwinter's Tale. Zelda plays peekaboo with Leticia right before she's stolen by the Yule Lads (and hidden in the preheating oven, yikes), and the baby in The Witch is stolen in a similar fashion when his older sister, Thomasin, is playing peekaboo with him at the edge of the witch-infested woods. Lesson: never ever play peekaboo with a baby, especially in the woods or during the winter solstice.\n\nJingles the Elf\n\nThere's another comic book callback! In A Midwinter’s Tale, Susie gets a job playing Jingles the Elf at the Santa extravaganza in town. In the Archie comic books, Jingles the Elf is an elf who visits Riverdale during the holidays to keep an eye on the gang for Santa. Unfortunately, that wasn't the only thing Susie had to deal with during this holiday episode."
