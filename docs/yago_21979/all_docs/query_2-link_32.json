        "text": "The opera The Winter’s Tale was written and composed by Ryan Wigglesworth, after William Shakespeare’s play.\n\nRead more about:\n\nShakespeare’s play\n\nThe themes\n\nThe libretto\n\nShakespeare’s play\n\nShakespeare wrote The Winter’s Tale between 1609-11 and the play had its first performance at The Globe theatre on 15 May 1611. As in many of Shakespeare’s works, there are references to music throughout the narrative, making it a natural text for an operatic adaptation.\n\n‘It almost demanded a musical treatment in order to make sense of its pivotal moments.’\n\n— Ryan Wigglesworth\n\nIn his play, Shakespeare creates a world called Bohemia where singing and dancing have a natural place in the gentle countryside, as if the presence of music is made possible by Bohemia’s freedom of emotions, relationships and identities. In Act 5, music plays a special role in the surprise unveiled by Paulina, suggesting that music has the power of regeneration.\n\nThe themes\n\nIn Shakespeare’s day, the phrase ‘a winter’s tale’ was a common colloquialism implying an old wives’ tale that typically had a happy ending but was not necessarily rooted in reality. Set in the mythical contrasting kingdoms of Sicilia and Bohemia, Shakespeare’s play captures the issues and tensions of seventeenth-century England and explores eternal questions of human nature.\n\nOne of the play’s key themes is the tyranny of the ruling class and the culture of distorted leadership. Shakespeare’s treatment of Leontes casts the monarchy in a distinctly negative light, despite the fact that the play was presented before the royal family: first for King James I and later in the wedding festivities for his daughter in 1613. During his reign, King James I made clear his strong advocacy of royal absolutism, believing that his word was the law. By 1610 this belief had led him into increased conflict with a self-assertive Parliament. Shakespeare may well have used the character of Leontes to shed light on the tensions brewing in contemporary England.\n\nThe other main theme in the play is the juxtaposition of different worlds. Shakespeare used many of his writings to comment upon the differences between the busy, over-populated city of London where he worked and the gentleness of rural life in his family home in Stratford-Upon-Avon. In The Winter’s Tale, the freedoms to love and live peacefully that are inherent in the wild natural world of Bohemia contrast with the strictly controlled kingdom of Sicilia and its hierarchical structures of kingship.\n\nThese themes of stark contrasts and political tension remain urgent in the contemporary world and underlie the choices made by the creative team on this new production.\n\nThe libretto\n\nRyan Wigglesworth wrote the libretto for the opera, and relished the opportunity to reinvent Shakespeare’s language into a musical framework. Doing so, however, created its own challenges for the composer. Words take much longer to sing than to speak, and a libretto needs to leave space for the musical storytelling.\n\n‘Shakespeare’s language is knotty and complex, deliberately so. In the case of a character like Leontes, when the madness burgeons that’s how it manifests itself, in an incredibly labyrinthine language. The iambic pentameter of the lines is too long, the thoughts are too long. I needed to cut the individual lines to get the essence, but at the same time to keep the colour. I began by snipping away and creating something very skeletal, then I started to flesh out the words when I came to compose. It’s the nature of a successful libretto to feel inadequate and naked on the page. So with Shakespeare, which is so opulent and complete, I felt I had to overcompensate, cutting down and allowing space for the music to function.’\n\n— Ryan Wigglesworth\n\nThe play’s five acts have been reshaped into three for the opera, with some of the play’s most anticipated lines removed, allowing the music to create the atmosphere and emotions evoked by these famous words. The big set-pieces of the play – Hermione’s trial, the storm, the passing of sixteen years, and the final statue scene – remain the dramatic pillars around which the opera is built."
