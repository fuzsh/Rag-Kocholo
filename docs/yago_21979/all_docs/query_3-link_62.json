The postponement is due to unforeseen circumstances, but the show will be presented at 7:30 p.m. nightly Tuesday through Saturday, Nov. 14-18, in the Francis-Booth Experimental Theatre at the Joan C. Edwards Performing Arts Center.\n\nTicketholders can contact the box office at 304-696-2787 to transfer their tickets to the date of their choice. The School of Theatre and Dance offers its apology for the inconvenience.\n\nMarshall’s theatre program has followed a Shakespearean theme this semester, with this production being directed by Broadway veteran Terry Layman. “The Winter’s Tale” tells the story of King Leontes, who falsely accuses his wife of infidelity with his best friend, only to see her die shortly thereafter. The king also exiles his newborn daughter, who is raised by shepherds for 16 years but later reunited with her guilt-stricken father through a series of coincidences.\n\n“This production is an opportunity to see one of Shakespeare’s final and least performed plays,” said Sam Kincaid, box office and public relations manager for the School of Theatre and Dance. ” ’The Winter’s Tale’ is a dark and fanciful tale of revenge and redemption, magic and young love, and (of course) a rampaging bear!”\n\nUnder the direction of Layman, the cast includes Mike Murdock, Jeremy Wright, Eliza Aulick, Samuel McElwain, Nikki Riniti, Jimi Lee, Van Preston, Samantha Phalen, Sierra Lutz, Michael Martin, Noah Ritchie, George Kinley, Harper Aulick, Gabriella Bellomy, Menis Ketchum, Katherine Kennedy, Gavin Spiewak and Jaden Babbitt.\n\n“Marshall University School of Theatre and Dance is thrilled to welcome back guest director Terry Layman. Mr. Layman has appeared on Broadway in the Pulitzer Prize winning ‘Proof,’ the original cast of Arthur Miller’s Tony nominated ‘The Ride Down Mt. Morgan’ and ‘Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,’ ” Kincaid said.\n\nTickets are available at 304-696-ARTS. They are free for Marshall students with a valid MU ID. They are $22 general admission and $15 for seniors age 60 and older and Marshall employees. The production is sponsored by the School of Theatre and Dance in the College of Arts and Media."
