        "text": "ARRIVING late at an elegant London dinner party, the narrator of ''Tamar,'' a short story in Mark Helprin's ''Ellis Island, and Other Stories,'' is seated at the ''children's table,'' as a kind of genteel punishment. (The time is close to the start of World War II; the narrator is in London on a mission that fails - raising escape funds for European Jewry through an art exchange.) The teen-agers in attendance are new to him and charming - lively, intelligent, dream-ridden. Amused by their chatter, instantly infatuated with a bright beauty who's the eldest girl in the group, the narrator finds himself under compulsion to entertain. He launches a ''long story about Palestine,'' then races on - his imagination freed - ''because they were children, more or less'' - to wilder stuff. ''I spoke of impossible battles . . . of feats of endurance which made me reel merely in imagining them, of horses that flew, and golden shafts of light, pillars of fire, miracles here and there . . . anything which seemed as if it might be believed.''\n\nThe kids love it, and the narrator warms to their witty responsiveness. The evening swiftly rises to the condition of music. ''Though we were still,'' the reader is told, in words echoing Florizel's great speech to Perdita in Shakespeare's ''The Winter's Tale,'' ''we were dancing.'' Long after, even in the years when the narrator is tormented by his powerlessness in the face of the Holocaust, the memory of this story hour - an interval of narrative and emotional fantasy - somehow comforts him, saves his mental balance.\n\nI connect ''Tamar'' with ''Winter's Tale,'' Benjamin DeMott teaches English at Amherst College. Mr. Helprin's utterly extraordinary new book his second novel and fourth work of fiction) for two reasons. The first involves simple literary sleuthing: The substance of the story-hour performance described in a few paragraphs in the tale is extremely close to the substance of the nearly 700 pages of ''Winter's Tale.'' Pillars of fire, impossible battles and feats of endurance abound in the book. A flying horse is a central character, and, like the man in the story, the novelist whips about gleefully among a dozen modes of the fabulous - tall tales, fairy tales, sci-fi, animated cartoons, what you will.\n\nThe other reason for connecting ''Tamar'' with ''Winter's Tale'' concerns the book's potential uses. A piercing sense of the beautiful arising from narrative and emotional fantasy is everywhere alive in the novel. And because the novelist commits himself throughout to the pursuit of nourishing truths - truths of justice, hope and cheer remote from the more fashionable truths of alienation and despair - ''Winter's Tale'' stands forth in its own right as restorer and comforter. The witty responsiveness necessary to a full experience of the book is doubtless more likely to turn up in urban readers than elsewhere; a primary ambition of the work seems to be, in fact, to teach its audience how to understand - i.e., how to inhabit to some purpose and with some joy - a great city. But in the end, the wisdom in these pages is in no respect whatever parochial. The affirming voices that one is reminded of are those of Blake and Whitman.\n\nTHE story told in ''Winter's Tale'' begins in the late 19th century, jumping abruptly, in mid-course, to the year 2000. Its focus is a series of interconnected heroic lives, chief of which is that of Peter Lake, orphan, burglar, lover, idealist, mechanic first- class. Son of would-be immigrants who are rejected because the mother is consumptive, Peter Lake is reared by clamdiggers on the Bayonne Marsh and sent as a boy to make his way in Manhattan, where, in those days, ''more than half a million . . . children without parents could be found huddled together like rabbits.'' Seized by the police as a public danger, Peter Lake is incarcerated in the Overweary Home for Lunatic Boys, an early metropolitan slave labor camp, but he's swiftly advanced to the home's elite: 50 lads serving unpaid apprenticeships under the tutelage of a splendidly Dickensian Reverend Mootfowl, ''mad craftsman, a genius of tools.''\n\nMootfowl and his pupils are, of course, exactly what the climax of the 19th century demanded: The machine was touching the summit of its ascendancy. (''Engines had come alive, and they lighted every corner, crowning themselves in plumes of smoke and steam . . . the city itself became a machine, millions worked day and night in a fury to attend the birth.'') Peter Lake isn't headed for factory work, however. After learning the ''vast traditional physics of those who called themselves mechanics,'' he joins the Short Tails, a remarkable band of thieves led by another Dickensian figure named Pearly Soames. For 10 years Peter Lake practices the arts of burglar, bagman and ''Woola Woola boy.'' (Woola Woola teams consist of an ace standing high-jumper and several back-up rip-off artists. The jumper, aided by ''alloy spring boots'' - a Peter Lake invention - jumps ''15 feet in the air while excitedly screaming, 'Woola woola woola!' '' As crowds gather to watch, the jumper's teammates loot untended trucks and wagons in the vicinity.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
