        "text": "When it was announced Chilling Adventures of Sabrina would be putting on a Christmas special, many were excited, especially after following what was a mostly strong debut back in October.\n\nWhat the stand-alone episode offered was a chance for the show to stretch its supernatural muscle. Instead, though, what it gives audiences is a mediocre episode of Sabrina made worse by the fact it serves as the first episode dealing with the consequences of the mid-season finale.\n\nFor mortals, Christmas is a time of joy and celebration but, for the supernatural, it’s a time of great trouble requiring the upmost of caution. Unfortunately, for Sabrina and her friends, trouble just seems to be their middle name.\n\nThe biggest problem with the Sabrina Christmas special is it’s not really one. It’s just a random, lackluster episode of the show that happens to be set at Christmas. Even worse though is the fact the writing is just downright lazy.\n\nMany plots are started throughout the episode, then dropped minutes later in the most boring way possible. No drama. No stakes. The terror comes and goes in the time it took for you to read that sentence.\n\nFor genre shows, Christmas specials are a time to get fun and goofy, just ask Supernatural. This is what Chilling Adventures should have delivered on.\n\nSomething akin to that episode that saw a sleep demon invade the Spellman house is what this episode needed. A fun romp that maybe even didn’t deal with the events of the mid-season finale. There isn’t an audience member on the planet that would have been offended.\n\nSabrina started very strong but dulled as the season went on. A victim, most of all, of overly bloated episodes that destroyed the show’s pacing. A Midwinter's Tale was a chance to reset. A chance to remind us what was so great about this new take on a famed character.\n\nHell, there isn’t even a Salem moment that makes the whole thing worthwhile and, if there’s any episode that called for another instance between Sabrina and her familiar, this was the one.\n\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina: A Midwinter's Tale needed to be fun. It needed to be cool. Instead, it’s just a drag. A lazy and uninteresting piece of television that does its series a true disservice and, ultimately, leaves a poor taste in one’s mouth for the next run of episodes set to debut in 2019."
