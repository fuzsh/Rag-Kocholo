        "text": "I didn’t think the film managed the transition from cynical comedy to heartstring-tugging as deftly as S&A usually does–its heartfelt elements were a bit shopworn–but it was still a real pleasure.\n\nFull Review | Aug 12, 2022\n\nThis small-scale, putatively comic meditation on the anxieties and joys of the theatrical life says nothing fresh about the artistic process and manages to be coy and grating in doing so.\n\nFull Review | Mar 26, 2009\n\nExcellent, hilarious bookend to Branagh's Hamlet. If you or someone you love is in theatre, you must watch.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Feb 9, 2005\n\nA Midwinter's Tale\" packs together so many characters and ideas that they crowd one another out, leaving enough room for plenty of chuckles but none for belly laughs.\n\nFull Review | Aug 30, 2004\n\nOne of Branagh's most charming works too little seen.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Nov 24, 2003\n\nA nice viewing alternative to the usual Christmas pap, and goes well with a fireplace and a snowy December day.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Mar 19, 2003\n\nPopulated mostly with unfamiliar faces and photographed in black and white, it's like one of those 1950s British comedies that assumed the audience was paying attention. It's about characters and dialogue.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jan 1, 2000"
