        "text": "This course will begin to explore The Winter’s Tale by investigating why Shakespeare might have wished to move away from the world of tragedy to explore the genre of Romance. We will also discuss the idea of ‘late’ writing in general, and how such a category might apply to Shakespeare. Exploring this play’s significant staging of tragic themes, we will delve into how the second part of The Winter’s Tale sets out to resolve the problems created in the first half. This includes the pastoral setting and intervention of numerous pastoral themes; the place of magic and the gods in the play and in the theatre more generally; the discussions of nature and art in Act 4 in the light of Renaissance ideas; and how Shakespeare uses the anagnorisis (recognition) trope.\n\nFinally, we will dwell on the meaning, or meanings, suggested by the extraordinary last scene: what is the meaning of a statue brought to life, if indeed it is brought to life? What might Shakespeare have wished to explore, or suggest, using such a trope? Throughout our exploration of these numerous themes, we will constantly delve into the play’s many rich and wondrous connections between language, magic and wonder.\n\nLearning outcomes"
