        "text": "Love and friendship are important themes throughout the play. Leontes is so in love with Hermione that he is driven to jealousy.His jealousy, in turn, causes him to publicly accuse her of adultery and to destroy his relationship with his best friend. Leontes is later repentant, and he spends a long period of time mourning Hermione...... her life and death, though it’s possible that Hermione was never dead, merely hidden away in fear for her life. If Hermione actauuly dies, the statue erected in her honor comes alive in the presence of the love of her husband, daughter, and good friends.\n\nAnother example of this scene can be seen in the love shared by Perdita and Florizel. Perdita expects adversity, but Florizel doesn’t care. He declares his love to be stronger than any opposition they might face. Even when confronted by Polixenes, Florizel remains determined to marry Perdita, and the couple flees to Sicilia, where Florizel makes up a story about meeting her in another country. When Polixenes later discovers their whereabouts, Florizel seems to despair. Florizel tells Leontes that Perdita will be a princess once they are married."
