        "text": "Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale is a play is one of Shakespeare’s lesser-known plays, being part of his later ‘Romance plays’ and having much more difficult plot and themes for a modern audience to understand, having such vastly different cultural context for the play. A common thread throughout Shakespeare’s later plays is the idea of faith and belief, which were points of interest for not only Shakespeare, it seems, but also Elizabethan and Jacobean Britain as a whole.\n\nIn The Winter’s Tale there is an overarching theme of faith and belief, particularly in what one chooses to have faith in or believe. Shakespeare consistently challenges the cause his audience have in not only the events of the play but what they might believe in their own lives as well. This belief extends to art, such as the statue of Hermione and even the play itself, as Shakespeare questions what we place our trust in.\n\nThe main way in which Shakespeare challenges what the audience chooses to believe is by contrasting what we hear and what we see. This challenging starts with Leontes’ jealous images that he creates through his mind’s eye, where he convinces himself that he is seeing the adultery between his wife and closest friend, when in reality that is not the case at all. This absolute trust in what he thinks he sees is described as an “affection”, or a kind of madness. Thus begins the theme of distrust in visual proof and what we, the audience, see. Later in the play, belief in sight is used again when it is used to recognise Leontes’ heir, Perdita, from her visual resemblance to him. Contrastingly with the first instance, this visual proof is correct, though Shakespeare ensures that we don’t see the reunion between Perdita and Leontes, rather we hear it from the lords who relay the events to us instead. This choice to have the scene told to the audience rather than seeing it may be Shakespeare confirming a belief in what we hear is better than a belief in what we see. This same idea of believing sound rather than sight is continued when Leontes refuses to believe Hermione’s innocence after the Oracle tells him, to disastrous consequences.\n\nThe motif of the visual culminates in an exploration between true and false, original and copy, when Hermione’s statue is revealed to the audience. Paulina tells Leontes to “awake your faith”, suggesting that a certain amount of suspension of belief is needed to believe what you see. This idea of suspending your belief could be applied to the entire play as well, many of the events in it being unrealistic and unbelievable. There is also a double meaning to the phrase, as ‘faith’ could be a reference to religion, making the line read more so as a call to Christianity rather than asking Leontes to believe what he sees. This would fit with what Paulina says about “dear life redeems you”, which seems to be a reference to Christ ‘the redeemer’, a commentary perhaps on the nature of religion and mirroring a line from the bible, from Jesus to Thomas, on believing not what you see, but what you hear “because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed”.\n\nThe nature of art and believing is questioned even by the name of the play “The Winter’s Tale”, meaning an unbelievable story. Considering this with the confusing resurrection of Hermione, it could be suggested that Shakespeare is also commenting on the nature of art and how visual forms of art are not to be entirely trusted, or that they should be viewed with a certain amount of suspension of belief in order to be fully enjoyed.\n\nSeeing, therefore, functions on various levels, In the Winter’s tale. one which describes vision as a reality that is transformed in the mind of the character, such as when Leontes converts Hermione’s fidelity to images of adultery constructs his own ideas of visual proof in his mind “But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers, as now they are, and making practised smiles as in a looking-glass, and then to sigh.” The same theme reappears in the last act when Hermione’s image is preserved in a statue. Another form of seeing that is explored in the play relies on the facts visually perceived by the eye and relying on resemblance, but even this is overlayed with speech, implying that sight alone cannot be believed. This idea that you shouldn’t see to believe is a distinctly Christian one and seems to go against the iconographic themes in the beginning of the final scene, suggesting that iconography is wrong and that one shouldn’t seek visual proof or idols, rather they should have faith in what they are told."
