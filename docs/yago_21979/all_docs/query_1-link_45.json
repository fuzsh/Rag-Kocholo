As the cast he assembles are still available even at Christmas and are prepared to do it on a 'profit sharing' basis (that is, they may not get paid anything) he cannot expect - and does not get - the cream of the cream. But although they all bring their own problems and foibles along, something bigger starts to emerge in the perhaps aptly named village of Hope.",

        "text": "Wedged between the epic failure that was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the just epic Hamlet, we find this interesting, small scale curio in Kenneth Branagh's directorial filmography. In many ways, In the Bleak Midwinter (titled A Midwinter's Tale in the US I believe), serves as a companion to Branagh's earlier film, Peter's Friends. That 1992 ensemble comedy was set in the run up to new year, culminating in revelations being raised and friendships being renewed on New Year's Eve, whilst this story of a ragtag bunch of actors staging Hamlet in a set-for-demolition church takes place in the run up to Christmas, culminating in the debut performance on Christmas Eve. However, it's important to remember that whilst Branagh directed and…\n\nThe first scenes of this are kind of a wreck--Michael Maloney plays the lead, a down-on-his-luck actor trying to get a production of \"Hamlet\" going out in the provinces over Christmas, as ... I dunno, Woody Allen on meth on something. (Odd, because, three years later, writer-director Kenneth Branagh actually played the Woody Allen surrogate character in Allen's \"Celebrity.\") It's frantic and unfunny.\n\nBut once Maloney's Joe gets the company together and he and his fellow has-beens and never-weres start rehearsing in an unused church in the unfortunately named town of Hope (ugh, Ken, please), Maloney dials his performance (and neurotic mannerisms) back from an 11 to, say, a 9, and this is actually a lot of fun and, ultimately,…\n\nThe Good Companions revisited... An amiable enough situation comedy, but by setting its heights at or below the bar, it goes in no particular direction - apart from putting on the show in that proverbial barn. You’re left with constant reminders of something else but not much of itself.\n\nWith acting of the ‘party turn’ variety, you’ve seen these same character-type performances from these particular actors a dozen times before, so can it be anything more than benign mugging amid the same old coals? No, not really. Everyone gets their funny scene then their dramatic scene for that Janus effect. Everything by rote.\n\nThat said it has a certain regard for the Bard and if viewed as a kind of…"
