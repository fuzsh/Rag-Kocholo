        "text": "Conclusion of Research/Evaluation\n\nI have now reached the concluding section of my research portfolio. In alignment with your given circumstances and requests, I have provided a variety of key resources which I think will be extremely beneficial to the makings of this production. Firstly, I have taken into consideration the importance of character and narrative to ensure the essence of the story is not lost by any adaptations. I have considered the importance of the plays themes and key ideas so that these can be incorporated both into artistic elements and be continually reflected upon over the rehearsal period. I have directed my research towards finding a key case study that utilises dance and physicalisation as a means of performance, as well as finding up to date references and ideas that bring the play into the 21st century. I have found key scholarly research into various elements of the play, as well as the suggested points of focus that I think the play should derive from. I suggest that the play centres its focus on time, health, mortality, the mind, and politics. The political focus can look at NHS funding cuts, mental health awareness, and the politics and hierarchy of the public health sector. Similar to Trevor Nunn’s production, having a very white, clinical modern aesthetic in conjunction with the NHS could be a very interesting as a visual anchor and reference point. Embellishing the white space with even more of a hospital feel, whether that just be waiting room chairs, familiar hospital items, or costume that references to this idea are all factors that need to be considered. However, I help this be will an invaluable insight into my dramaturgical vision, and feed as inspirational material for the making of this production.\n\nBeth Lockyer\n\nSuggestion of adaptation\n\nSuggested Cast/Cuts:\n\nAs the number of cast will be 10 members, these characters are the most integral to the running of the play, and whom I think would be ideal to focus on for this production.\n\nI am suggesting the double casting of Shepherd/Clown as they act as the crossover between Tragedy and Comedy and it may be interesting to see how one actor could portray this duality and almost shift the tone of the production through his speech/actions alone. All supporting lady’s maid lines can either be cut, or given as additional lines to Paulina when she is speaking with Hermione. Paulina’s main scenes are her confrontations with Leontes, and the presentation of Hermione’s statue at the end so there will be no substitutional or consequent loss for her character. Any characters not listed may be cut, or important lines you feel necessary to the narrative can be portioned off to alternative characters where necessary.\n\nLeontes\n\nCamillo\n\nHermione\n\nPolixenes\n\nPaulina\n\nAntigonus\n\nPerdita\n\nFlorizel\n\nShepherd/Clown\n\nMamillius\n\nThinking Physical – a key case study\n\nOne key performance that lends itself well to the study and research of corporeality and physicalisation is the performance of ‘The Winter’s Tale‘ by Christopher Wheeldon with the Royal Ballet. As described by Rachel Thomas (2016) ROH Content Writer, ‘Without words, Christopher Wheeldon’s choreography powerfully illuminates Shakespeare’s text and the innermost thoughts of his characters. Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale has a vivid narrative, full of gripping twists and turns, finished with a fairytale ending – in many ways an obvious choice for a big story ballet.’ The fantastical narrative full of heightened drama and emotion lends itself well to the genre of ballet as Rachel Thomas explains.\n\n‘The Winter’s Tale Dance Highlight: The trial scene’, 2016, By Rachel Thomas, Royal Opera House, http://www.roh.org.uk/news/the-winters-tale-dance-highlight-the-trial-scene\n\nShe expresses in fervent detail the importance of Hermione’s trial scene as a choreographed sequence of ballet:\n\n‘As Hermione enters the courtroom, her inner turmoil and fear are immediately apparent. With hesitant and mechanical movements, she steps forward to face her husband and accuser. She begins to dance – her gaze downwards, and one hand clasped to her abdomen, remembering the child taken from her. Throwing herself to the floor, she arches backwards, arms and legs outstretched, before looking up at Leontes for the first time, kneeling, with a hand on her heart. Desperate to demonstrate her innocence, Hermione appeals to the King again and again – arms raised above her head in submission and vulnerability, presenting the open palm of her hand to him and reaching imploringly in his direction in arabesque. But, seeing no flicker of response or understanding from him, her distress builds. To the unsettling lament of Joby Talbot’s score, the underlying agitation revealed by the disturbed opening and closing of her hands develops into more demonstrative suffering as she sweeps her arms across her body and stretches them out in despair, collapsing in her middle as if enduring physical pain.\n\nIn another distraught attempt to get through to him, she clasps her wrists and draws an arm across her face – a memory of the gesture that they performed together when were first united in the Prologue. Leontes’s indifference to this petition proves too much for Hermione and, as the music grows increasingly sinister she spins inconsolably from one lady-in-waiting to another, kicking her legs behind her in agitated arabesques before collapsing to her knees.’\n\nFrom watching the footage of the production, we can see the striking impacts of having this moment choreographed through dance. The melancholic music, paralleled with her controlled restrained movements helped to show her helplessness in the situation of her trial. Wearing white to suggest her innocence, the audience cannot help but feel pity for her in her moment of need. This was particularly poignant, and could be a great starting point in terms of thinking about how ‘The Winter’s Tale‘ can compliment this sort of work in its physical capabilities.\n\nFull write up from Rachel Thomas here: http://www.roh.org.uk/news/the-winters-tale-dance-highlight-the-trial-scene\n\nThe significance of time\n\nTime is an extremely important and significant theme in ‘The Winter’s Tale‘. Initially, Leontes uses a lack of time to make snap decisions in the moment. Whether this is down to his mental health, boyhood insecurities, or other potential reasonings that we have looked at in the course of this portfolio, they are all eventualities to be decided upon. Time is also shown to us as a mechanism for healing and redemption, with time fixing the mistakes of the past and letting past errors resolve themselves through the natural course of time.\n\nBrogan O’Callaghan offers some interesting insight on this theme:\n\n‘Shakespeare’s ‘The Winter’s Tale’ – Why is time so important?’, Brogan O’Callaghan, 2012, https://broganocallaghan.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/shakespeares-the-winters-tale-why-is-time-so-important/\n\n‘Time has a key role to play in The Winter’s Tale. What creates tragedy in a play or book is that time runs out. In this case, Leontes realises his mistake too late. It is the expectation of tragedy that allows for this comic relief. Time is important in The Winter’s Tale for many reasons. Shakespeare uses time to create suspicion, heartache and joy. If only Leontes had spent more time thinking about what he was accusing Polixenes and Hermione of, he would have realized his mistake and the following tragedies would have been averted. He is then stuck in a period of remorse and grief until the oracle is fulfilled. Sicilia has become a timeless state until Perdita “the lost one” is found. Time has not stood still in Bohemia however; it has permitted Perdita and Florizel to grow up, which is fundamental for the play to progress. Time is the only reason Hermione has been reincarnated. Time has healed her wounds and allowed Leontes to reflect and learn from his experiences. Time is central to the plays advancement. Unlike many of Shakespeare’s other plays, which last a very short period of time, The Winter’s Tale had to be set over a long period of time to make it the play that it is.’\n\nBrogan O’Callaghan’s study also demonstrates how time can be restrictive and causes a lot of the narrative to conclude in certain ways due to the constraints of time. In everyday life there is a human connection to this feeling, and there is always a concern that we are running out of time and that we act too quickly in response to this. ‘The Winter’s Tale‘ is a great example of this, showing humanity and mortality in a very real way that emphasises ‘we’re only human’ and nobody is perfect.\n\nMadness in ‘The Winter’s Tale’\n\nAs previously aforementioned in my communique, there is a great deal of potential to explore the concept of madness within ‘The Winter’s Tale‘, especially regarding the mental health of Leontes. In today’s society, mental health is still attached to a lot of stigma and uncertainty, so to be able to showcase a truthful and honest account of a man suffering from mental health could be a really worthwhile thing, and could add further value to a modern day performance of Shakespeare giving the narrative a modern validation in the 21st century.\n\nAdam Anderson (2015) offers some invaluable insight to this concept:\n\n‘Signifier, Signified, and the Nature of Madness in The Winter’s Tale’, Adam Anderson, 2015, Criterion: A Journal of Literary Criticism Volume 8, Issue 1 Article 12\n\n‘Leontes’s abject insanity is readily apparent from the first moments of Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale, and its prominence in both the characterization of Leontes and its subsequent importance to the play’s plot demand that the nature of his insanity be closely examined.\n\nOne of the most readily apparent effects of Leontes’s lost mind is acute paranoia leading to a form of interpretive hallucination. He does not descend into this madness in the play but is infected with it from the play’s inception; in Scene 2, Leontes immediately follows his dear Hermione’s successful plea for Polixenes to linger longer with a paranoid aside, raving at their supposed and imagined courtship. Leontes’s psychosis is compatible with modern definitions of schizophrenia; however, his actions and speeches lead to a deeper understanding of the inner-workings of the deluded mind. Leontes’s schizophrenia is both an effect and a cause of his paranoia, which in turn is both caused by and causing a mis-interpretation, a mis-reading, of the world around him.’\n\nExploring the mental health of Leontes in this way may actually bring more substance to his character. It is easy to see Leontes as a villain and a tyrant, but if we consider his motives alongside his suffering, we actually witness the heartbreaking torment of a ill man suffering with the severe effects of mental health. Allowing the audience to witness this, and noticing how his ill health is impeding on his judgement, they may also sympathise with his character more, share in his sorrow and route for him more in the broader spectrum of the play. This may also alter the dynamic of the play, seeing Leontes as less of a villain and more of a fallen hero in suffering.\n\nProduction History: Past Performances\n\nTrevor Nunn’s take on the production is much more traditional. The ‘white box’ could offer several different connotations such as white light at the end of the tunnel to further portray the passing of time, the enveloping white walls of a psychiatric ward symbolic of Leontes madness.\n\n‘This mirrored white box and the novel use of Time’s speech reflect the creative forces that connected Leontes’s tortured state, Time’s role in human dynamics, and Hermione’s statued imprisonment (all three step out of the same perspex box). The opening scene of a white nursery with toys and a white rocking horse captured both the innocence of Mamillius’s world and the more insidious forces that destroy this innocence. All the objects in the nursery objectify their significant character counterparts. Hermione is a “hobby horse,” the battered doll capturing the domestic violence that unfolds, and the spinning top the fragile core of Leontes’s self-display.’\n\nhttp://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/m/doc/WT_StageHistory/section/The%20Twentieth%20Century%20and%20the%20%22Shakespearean%20Revolution%22/\n\nThis production saw the play told through the means of classical ballet. Choreographed by ‘The Royal Ballet’, the play obviously took on an extremely physical approach, and told the story through dance in an extremely mesmerising and highly dramatic way. This could be a useful asset in terms of seeing how this play can be transformed through the physical.\n\nPeople’s Light & Theatre Company mounted a fast-paced and highly physical production of Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale. Scottish director Guy Hollands of Glasgow’s Citizen’s Theatre and the National Theatre of Scotland led a multi-ethnic cast of 13 performers. An outdoor festival featuring fire, lanterns, hot cider, fiddle playing, and a “bear” welcomed audience members to the People’s Light campus. Juggling ensemble members greeted patrons and performed a dance on an outdoor stage, introducing the audience to the spirit of the “traveling troupe” that formed the backstory of the production.\n\nWhile staying true to the play’s themes of betrayal and redemption, Hollands sought to connect the ideas and energy of teenaged members of the ensemble to the talents and skills of the company’s adult artists. Music Director Michael John McCarthy, an Irish composer, created an original score from a mix of Celtic songs, tunes inspired by the music of Tom Waits, and Shakespearean text set to melodies. Period dances were interpreted for the production by choreographer Samantha Bellomo. The final production was popular with young audiences, with more than half of the attendees under 17 years of age.\n\n‘David Farr’s production of Shakespeare’s late romance has been flawlessly cast and directed with sensitivity, insight and, above all, an enthralling immediacy. As the play’s movements succeed one another like those in a symphony, the sharp contrasts in tone vividly illuminate how the cycles of life and death, love and hate, joy and sorrow will forever be with us, like the changing seasons themselves.\n\nThe conflagration that follows is depicted with unsettling power. As the poison of jealousy moves through his blood, Leontes’s seething monologues are accompanied by eerie, high-pitched strains in Keith Clouston’s score that cannily evoke the warped perspective of a discomposed mind. Struggling to control the hate that has suddenly gripped him, the king clutches at his young son with convulsive movements that leave the boy wondering and shaken, his carefree happiness suddenly as fragile as his father’s mental equilibrium. The dangerous combination of royal power and unruly passions is a theme Shakespeare explored in many plays, and in “The Winter’s Tale” the consequences of Leontes’s jealousy are taken to terrifying extremes as he exacts violent revenge despite his courtiers’ reasoned attempts to dismiss his imagined fears. The king’s brutal implacability, we sense, can only come from years of corrupting obeisance to his whims.’\n\nFull Review Here: https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/theater/reviews/the-winters-tale-at-park-avenue-armory-review.html\n\nFurther information on the production can also be found here: https://www.rsc.org.uk/the-winters-tale/past-productions/david-farr-2009-production\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kvjBz1gXk28 -Performance Trailer, RSC\n\nJustin Audibert’s production saw a very colourful, modern adaptation of The Winter’s Tale. The stage floor consisted of a large clock face that constantly reiterated the importance of time as a key theme within the performance.\n\n‘Streamlined down to an hour, the focus really comes down to the relationships between parent and child, enhancing the throughline of the storytelling beautifully. I loved the idea that the root of this Leontes’ jealousy lay in Polixenes being a better dancer. There’s no doubting this is a story of fractured families and how, if at all, they can ever heal.’\n\nFull Review Here: https://www.oughttobeclowns.com/2018/02/review-the-winters-tale-national-theatre.html/\n\n‘The sense of characters permeated by fantasy also pervades The Winter’s Tale. Its high point comes when Rebecca Hall as a wonderfully ashen Hermione tells Simon Russell Beale’s Leontes, “My life stands in the level of your dreams.” In Mendes’ version, that is literally true since Leontes’ accusation of infidelity is presented as the dream of an incipient madman. Russell Beale also brings out excellently the character’s volatile insecurity, one moment fondly cradling his new-born daughter crying “Let it live”, and the next despatching the baby to apparent death.’\n\nFull Review Here: https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jun/10/the-cherry-orchard-winters-tale-review\n\n‘At first, it looks as if we are in for a romantic reading of The Winter’s Tale, co-directed by Rob Ashford and Branagh. We are, in Christopher Oram’s design, at a Christmas court full of snowflakes, carols and cheerful festivity, where everyone sits down to watch a home movie of the king, Leontes, and his chum Polixenes in their romping boyhood.There are strong hints that Branagh’s fine Leontes is driven less by insane jealousy over his wife’s possible adultery than by the loss of Polixenes’s love. Hadley Fraser’s Polixenes refers to women as “temptations”, while Branagh himself spits out words like “sluiced” and “slippery” as if disgusted by female sexuality and eagerly kisses his male courtiers. The implication is that this is a man still haunted by an idyllic boyhood attachment.’\n\nFull review found here: https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/08/the-winters-tale-review-kenneth-branagh-and-judi-dench-garrick\n\nPerformance History Catalogue:\n\nRoyal Shakespeare Company: Full Production History detailing various performances, found here: https://www.rsc.org.uk/the-winters-tale/past-productions/production-history (From 1903 – 2000s)\n\nTragicomedy – how do we approach this?\n\nThe play presents a complex amalgamation of comedy and tragedy. Exploring the play through physicalisation can embody these emotions much more deeply and poignantly than even words can, but first it’s important to understand how and why the play is written as a tragicomedy, and identify what this means for production purposes.\n\nC. B. Hardman (1985) explains, ‘The structure of The Winter’s Tale was perceptively described by Thomas Price at the end of the last century as a diptych made up of two plays: a tragedy and a comedy join.\n\n[…] The shepherd’s remark to the clown, ‘… thou met’st with things dying, I with things new born’ (III. iii. II2-I3)3 has often been connected with the themes of grace, fertility, regeneration, and rebirth popularly found in the play. However, […] the clown has witnessed not only the death of Antigonus and the sailors, but also the end of the tragic part of the play, while the shepherd not only finds a newborn child, but that discovery signals the commencement of a new comic action.’\n\nThis point in the play therefore landmarks the interchange between tragedy and comedy.\n\nIt is also suggested by scholars C. B. Hardman and Andrew Gurr that the appearance of the bear is another event abridging the gap between tragedy and comedy.\n\nFor C. B. Hardman (1985), ‘Shakespeare’s bear has provoked a good deal of speculation over whether the stage bear would have been played by a real animal or a man, and whether the effect was intended to be comic or terrible. It seems fairly certain that any real bear trusted to pursue Antigonus without taking a small bite from time to time must have been too tame: paradoxically, an actor imitating a bear would be far more frightening. However, the man or bear controversy does, I think, have an importance beyond the question of Jacobean stage practice. The audience in the theatre would have known that the frightening bear was a man, and that a tame bear would not have produced the same effect: that the real would be less convincing than the artificial. It is part of the unconcealed artifice which characterises the hinge between the two parts.’\n\nGurr also describes this appearance of the bear alongside that of the statue which appears later on by saying ‘The bear and the statue are precisely matching counterparts in the two halves of The Winter’s Tale. The bear brings the tragic half to an abrupt conclusion using the same theatrical device, the double-take, that Hermione’s statue provides when it comes to life to conclude the play’s second half. The two figures, if put together, set up enough teasing interactions between art and nature to complicate intriguingly the ostensible opposition between the two contraries.\n\nEven a real bear, we recognise, cannot be real except in stage terms, or the players would have to find a new Antigonus for every performance. A man in a bearskin-the more likely Elizabethan device-would defuse the situation even more quickly. Suddenly the realistic, tragic train of events has turned farcical. This double-take thus marks the play’s transition from tragedy to comedy.’\n\nFind these resources here:\n\nGurr, Andrew. “The Bear, the Statue, and Hysteria In The Winter’s Tale.” Shakespeare Quarterly, vol. 34, no. 4, 1983, pp. 420–425.

As the play will be centred around the body and physicalisation, it would be quite a novel idea to transport the play into the public sector of health and the NHS. As the NHS are undergoing extensive economic cuts, privatisation initiatives, and suffering against the social pressures of overcrowding and insufficient staffing – to carry out the play amongst these social and poignantly political pressures not only draws further light on these important matters, but also helps to translate the narrative of the play into a modern day setting. The NHS theme draws further attention to corporeality and puts further emphasis on the physical presence of the characters, asking us to examine and consider their physical and mental health in this tumultuous production. It allows us to place more importance on considering the characters as physical beings, and explore their physicality, body language and physical personas with much more scrutiny.\n\nAnother aspect of the play that partners very well with the themes of health and the NHS is how Leontes character deals with incessant jealousy and delusion that causes Hermione to be tried in court against his better judgement. Due to the madness that ensues from his clouded thoughts, Leontes could be a character that is very much exhibiting himself as a sufferer of severe mental health – another key topic that is frequently under debate and in need of further exploration in the world of theatre and performance. There is some research by Adam Anderson in ‘Signifier, Signified, and the Nature of Madness in The Winter’s Tale’ (2015) that analyses this concept in more detail and which will feed into my research later on.\n\nAnother theme that might need further acknowledgement within the artistic realms of the performance is ‘Time‘. Time is of significant importance within ‘The Winter’s Tale‘ as the play spans 16 years, and signifies the sheer importance of hindsight and foresight where time is concerned. Time could be a physical mechanism on the stage in the presence of a rotating floor that is symbolic of a clock face. Every step the actors take then contributes to the passing of time, and their footprints are metaphorically treading down on the ever-ticking clock. The clock could also have significant importance to Hermione’s character, showing how Hermione’s life is a fight against time. It could also emphasise how time can be both deteriorating or healing to the characters within the play.\n\nMy research portfolio will present further insight into these ideas, and I will also draw extensive inspiration from previous productions including footage, images and rhetoric.\n\nI hope you will find the ideas and innovations put forward useful, and I look forward to working on this production with you!\n\nKind Regards,\n\nBeth Lockyer"
