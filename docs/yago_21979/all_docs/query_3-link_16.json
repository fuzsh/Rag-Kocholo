        "text": "March 20, 2022\n\nA MIDWINTER'S TALE marks the beginning of a series of novels featuring the O'Malleys, an Irish American Catholic family in Chicago. Charles Cronin O'Malley (better known to family and friends as \"Chucky\") is the eldest son (born in 1928), sporting red hair who acquires a reputation for being cheeky, as well as having a knack for getting out of the most sticky situations with an enhanced reputation. He shares with the reader the experiences he and family had of living through the Depression, getting through World War II (during which his father was a reserve officer with the Illinois National Guard who was able to use his talent as an architect to design buildings for the U.S. Army not far from home - and Mrs. O'Malley worked at an aircraft plant, painting B-24 bombers for the war effort) and high school.\n\nBy the time Chucky has graduated from high school, he joins the Army, and spends the next 2 years in Bamberg, Germany (as part of the Constabulary of the U.S. Army of Occupation) where he served as \"a wise-cracking clerk-typist\" finding himself more often than not in a variety of colorful and potentially perilous experiences through which he emerges from late adolescence into early adulthood.\n\nAll in all, a very delightful and entertaining novel.\n\nJuly 16, 2012\n\nThe first book in teh O'Malley series (as I think of it) is like an introduction to all the characters. It covers the first 20 years of 'Chucky' O'Malley's life and the comedy of errors that sets him up for life. There's lots of history involved as well as some just good general fiction.\n\nAs usual, the characters in Greeley's book are not without flaws but have a wonderful cast of family and friends around to support them. In this case, Charles does a lot of supporting of others himself. Relationships blossum in the depression and into WWII and the occupation.\n\nThere is no grand super mystery, no over the top romance, no major twists in history. But somehow, this has become one of my favorite books by Father Greeley.\n\nJanuary 16, 2013\n\nI was fascinated that this was written by a Catholic priest. It is written from a young man's point of view (mostly about his time in the military), and describes the funny and awkward situations he encounters. It was fast-paced and I really enjoyed it. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it weren't for some of the language and several sex scenes. The plot was great.\n\nJuly 25, 2017\n\nAnother wonderful Greeley book. It has quick wit and intelligence, and I often glean some of the most poignant spiritual truths from his writing which he eloquently intersperses throughout his stories. He knows the human condition.\n\nAugust 28, 2017\n\nTook a little bit to get into this book and get used to the style of writing, which is different, I must say. But it's a delightful book. I loved it. Now I'm yearning for the next in this series, even though I have not read the first.\n\nApril 20, 2021\n\nAndrew Greeley does not disappoint\n\nA Chicago Irish catholic family’s efforts to maneuver through the Great Depression, WWII and their son’s adventures in post war Germany in the army. Intricacies of change.\n\nJuly 10, 2013\n\nThis is the rollicking tale of Charles Cronin \"Chuckie Duckie\" O'Malley as he transitions from his high school adventures and misadventures to more of the same after he joins Army and contends with his assignments as a member U.S. Constabulary Corps in post-World War II Germany.\n\nI first read this book about 14 years ago. When I saw the CD version, I thought I might enjoy it again. I had forgotten how VERY MUCH I like the novels of Andrew M. Greeley. I REALLY liked this first in the four-part series about \"The Crazy O'Malleys\"; so much so that immediately after finishing it, I checked out and began reading the continuation novel \"Younger Than Springtime.\" This was a very entertaining novel. Greeley develops his characters so well that you really feel as if you know them. I highly recommend it, especially for Greeley fans.\n\n[Book 15 of 2013 Target 50 (Jan-6; Feb-3; Mar-3; Apr-3)]\n\nJanuary 28, 2016\n\nThis is a wartime tale of a young Chicagoan boy who is sent to Germany in the immediate post war era. He has all the charm and wit that is sterotypically Chicago Irish and the tale follows his involvement with a german girl wanted by the Russians because her family were Nazis and his friendship with another German Frau who waits every day at the railway station in the hope that her husband will return from the Russian front. Add to this the black market that is thriving under american occupation and you get a pretty good read. Being Andrew Greeley you can't avoid the Catholic aspect to the read as well. The ending was a little cliche but it was an entertaining read.\n\nDecember 16, 2009\n\nI was able to identify with this book more than the average reader because I grew up Irish Catholic in Chicago. Although the times in the book were of an earlier period it was nice to read about the parishes that still exist in Chicago...and of course reading about the good April who reminds me of my mother and grandmother.\n\nJuly 24, 2010\n\nThis book brought back many memories. Also the main character, Charles and myself had many things in common.\n\nRed hair \"Red\"\n\nSame age\n\nPhotography\n\nPackard auto, Philco radio, WGN, South Shore train\n\nArmy overseas\n\nRank Sgt\n\nCompany Clerk\n\nStudy accounting\n\nReleased Fort sheridan\n\nI enjoyed the book; however, the plot got a bit unbelievable.\n\nMay 21, 2014\n\nThis was one of the few Andrew Greeley books I never read. As usual, his stories of growing up in Chicago, Irish families and Catholicism are intertwined with Greeley's sense of humor. I also enjoyed the story line of the main character's childhood during the Depression and his coming of age in Germany, post WWII.\n\nWant to read\n\nNovember 18, 2008\n\nfamily saga 1st bk\n\nDecember 6, 2009\n\nFirst book in The O'Malley family story. I love generation books and this series was excellent. You do not have to be Irish to enjoy it, but it helps.\n\nJanuary 3, 2013\n\nSlow starting but just before half way through it grabbed hold of me and I couldn't put it down! This is a tremendously uplifting story!\n\nJune 21, 2013\n\nAnother wonderful story Of Chucky Ducky .. and the O'Malley clan ...\n\nFebruary 3, 2014\n\nGreeley always does a great job with his character development, but I felt as though this book could have used more work on a central plot. Enjoyed the WWII background....\n\nOctober 14, 2016\n\nDelightful story about Chuck O'Malley and his family.\n\nAlthough this is the second in the series, it's the first one I read.\n\nJanuary 7, 2017\n\nPart read only. Didn't enjoy at all."
