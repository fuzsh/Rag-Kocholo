        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn a touching but lighthearted story, Chucky Cronin, a clerk typist in late 1940s Germany, wants to lead a simple life but instead becomes embroiled in a series of scrapes from which only his trademark combination of luck and wit will help him escape. 100,000 first printing.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nFrom the Publisher\n\nPraise for Andrew M. Greeley:\n\n\"Greeley can always be counted on to tell a good tale...a riveting story of love, crime, and scandal.\" --The Chattanooga Times\n\n\"The perfect holiday read...Greeley capitalizes on his experience writing suspense to keep us guessing until the final pages. His descriptions of both scene and character are vivid and full of evocative detail.\" --The Calgary Herald\n\n\"A tale of young love and faith as modern as U2, with a cast of characters, Irish and American, that very well may open Greeley's work to a generation of new...readers. Yet those who have followed his works in the past will find the same storytelling mastery and the same understanding of the heart.\" --Chicago Sun-Times on Irish Gold\n\n\"May be Greeley's best effort yet. It has more of everything--more plot, denser character development, fresh dialogue, and a more solid now story line than his previous work....A first-rate adventure story.\" --Baltimore Sun on Irish Gold\n\n\"Not your average Christmas tale...big-hearted...Greeley is a kindly matchmaker and a forgiving Catholic; fans...[will] gobble down his latest confection like so much Christmas rom-baba.\" --Publishers Weekly on Star Bright!\n\n\"If you liked Irish Gold, Greeley's first tale of this detective duo, you'll be delighted to have the sequel, Irish Lace.\" --The Charlotte Observer\n\n\"Like the delicate handwork that its title evokes, Greeley's Irish Lace is finely crafted, laced with compelling characters, and crisscrossed with strong story lines.\" --Savannah Morning News\n\n\"Greeley is at his top page-turning form, throwing in a few words about racism and xenophobia and delivering a rousing defense of the Bill of Rights. When he's good, as he is here, Greeley is very, very good.\" --Publishers Weekly on Irish Lace"
