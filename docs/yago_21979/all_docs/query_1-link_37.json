        "text": "Joe Harper (Michael Maloney), the mastermind behind one of the most precarious shoestring productions of Shakespeare you could possibly imagine, is not the sort of director a professional actor would be inclined to entrust with his soul. A wild-eyed, desperately unemployed 33-year-old English actor, Joe describes his life as one long nervous breakdown that began \"when I was 7 months and had just begun to get a grip.\"\n\nSomehow Joe convinces his agent, Margaretta D'Arcy (Joan Collins) that a feasible career move might be for him to direct and play the title role in a provincial production of \"Hamlet\" over the Christmas holidays. After auditioning a motley assortment of performers, including a children's hand puppeteer and a maniacal ventriloquist, Joe assembles a cast of six (to play 24 roles) and carts them to a village called Hope, where they set up shop in a drafty old church.\n\nWhat ensues in Kenneth Branagh's film \"A Midwinter's Tale\" might be described as grown-up farce spun off from the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland \"let's put on a show\" genre. The film, whose tone is set by Noel Coward's hilarious anti-show-business song, \"Why Must the Show Go On?,\" starts off as an amusing free-for-all spoof of the acting profession and eventually turns into a comic valentine to diehard thespian dedication.\n\n\"A Midwinter's Tale\" is itself a variapion of the Mickey and Judy formula in that it seems almost made up as it goes along. This black-and-white film unfolds at such a lickety-split pace that at moments its snappy dialogue gets left behind in the dust.\n\nThe movie stays resolutely true in spirit to the Mickey and Judy school: the mishaps and obstacles that augur almost certain catastrophe can't quench the company's indomitable show business spirit.\n\nThe cast members who camp out on futons and sleeping bags in the church, where the production has three weeks to prepare, are a wildly incongruous bunch. Nina Raymond (Julia Sawalha), who makes her theatrical debut as a screechingly hysterical Ophelia, auditions for the role with a crude disco-dancing parody of Deborah Harry singing \"Heart of Glass.\" Since Nina refuses to wear her eyeglasses during rehearsals, the character's grand entrances turn into reeling pratfalls.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
