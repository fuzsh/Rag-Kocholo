        "text": "Adela De La Torre\n\nIn William Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale, the topic of jealousy is the driving force of the play’s theme and central conflict. The first three acts of the play illustrate the beginning stages of Leontes’, King of Sicilia, jealousy and its destructive effects. In the play, Leontes’ sudden and unfounded fear that his pregnant wife, Queen Hermione, is sleeping with his childhood friend, Polixenes, King of Bohemia, eats away at him like a disease. This false infidelity between Hermione and Polixenes stems from the queen’s persistence and ability to convince her husband’s friend to remain in Sicilia a while longer. The Queen is pregnant at the time so Leontes assumes the baby is not his and orders it to be murdered after delivery. Leontes interprets, without evidence, the friendship between his wife and friend as an affair, initiating the play’s destructive, jealous conflict. Jealousy strikes Leontes with a suddenness which is rather difficult to comprehend. A modern psychologist might suggest that, with his wife in the later stages of pregnancy, Leontes feels neglected or sexually frustrated. Alternatively, he may suspect that his people and his queen like him only because he is king of Sicilia and that Polixenes, also a king, threatens his relationship with Hermione and his subjects (Grimes).\n\nLeontes’ wild jealousy is often compared to another famous Shakespearean play, Othello. Both men in these plays unfairly suspect their wives of infidelity and their violent responses destroy their families and upset the political balance. In his journal, Derek Cohen writes that “by accusing their wives of sexual infidelity, Othello and Leontes give themselves a desperately needed motive for expressing in words what they both love and fear- the image of their wives making love to other men” (Cohen). In Othello, Desdemona’s friendship with Cassio, Othello’s friend, is the root of Othello’s jealousy. Both leading characters fear that their partners have committed the ultimate betrayal and that the result of that deed, ultimately, will illustrate an image of being unfit to rule their people if even their wives didn’t respect their vows. Othello and Leontes’ fits of jealousy are what leads both plays along and leads to their suffering.\n\nAlthough both plays depict the downfalls each main character experiences due to their illogical jealousy, the differences between the two Shakespearean works, however, are significant. Regarding their genre, Othello is written as a tragedy due to its unfortunate ending, whereas The Winter’s Tale is written as a tragicomedy as it resolves in a more harmonious manner than the latter. Othello’s jealous flame is fanned by the play’s protagonist, Iago. This character plays a crucial role in Othello’s demise. Iago, having his own envious feelings towards Othello, villainously misleads and psychologically interferes with his trust towards Desdemona. Unlike Othello, Leontes is convinced of his wife’s alleged affair all by himself- there is no Iago figure whispering in his ear and goading him along. If anything, Leontes is how own Iago! More importantly, Leontes’ abuse of his family is not entirely permanent, unlike Othello’s. After repenting and suffering for sixteen long years, Leontes is reunited with his queen and long-lost daughter, which puts a redemptive theme on The Winter’s Tale, whereas Othello is just plain tragic.\n\nThe Winter’s Tale and Othello both illustrate the destruction jealous thoughts and actions can pose on relationships. They serve as cautionary tales that urge the initiation of communication among dynamics; romantic, platonic or familial. By initiating conversations with their wives, Desdemona’s life would be spared, Hermione’s character unquestioned and Leontes and Othello’s suffering may have been avoided. As William Shakespeare so famously wrote, “O! Beware, my lord, of jealousy, it is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on” (Shakespeare).\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nCohen, Derek. “Patriarchy and Jealousy in Othello and The Winter’s Tale.” Modern Language Quarterly, vol. 48, no. 3, 1987, pp. 207–223.\n\nGrimes, Parker. “The Infection of Jealousy.” Utah Shakespeare Festival, Utah Shakespeare Festival, 30 Oct. 2015, http://www.bard.org/study-guides/the-infection-of-jealousy.\n\n“No Fear Shakespeare: Othello.” No Fear Shakespeare: Othello, by William Shakespeare and John Crowther, Spark, 2003.\n\nShakespeare, William.
