In 2017, amidst the economic frenzy of the Bitcoin boom, there was no better place for scammers than cryptocurrency. So when Ray’s friend approached him with the idea of creating a debit card for crypto, Trapani jumped at the chance. There was only one problem: he had no idea how to do that. But thanks to fake LinkedIn profiles, paid celebrity endorsements, and the online community’s insatiable desire to “get rich quick,” Centra Tech was soon raking in millions of dollars a day. Was it real? No. But did it work? Maybe. In this fast-paced, debaucherous documentary from director Bryan Storkel (Producer of The Legend of Cocaine Island + Director of The Pez Outlaw), Ray himself guides viewers through the ups and downs of his dramatic journey, alongside his family, former friends, and the journalist who exposed Centra Tech as the first high-profile fraud case of the crypto era.\n\nDIRECTOR: Bryan Storkel\n\nRead more about Bitconned. | Add to My List\n\nSociety of the Snow Trailer\n\nJan. 4\n\nSociety of the Snow\n\nLOGLINE: In 1972, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, which had been chartered to fly a rugby team to Chile, crashed in the heart of the Andes.

The Greatest Night in Pop chronicles the massive undertaking to assemble the world’s most impressive supergroup in a world before cell phones and email. That group of artists — led by the song’s co-writers and two of the most significant musicians of the 20th century, Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie — came from different worlds but united to record “We Are the World.” Featuring never-before-seen footage, the film details the early planning stages, including the writing sessions with Richie and Jackson, and goes inside the famed Henson Studios where “We Are the World” was recorded. Many of the artists who were there that legendary evening — Richie, Bruce Springsteen, Smokey Robinson, Cyndi Lauper, Kenny Loggins, Dionne Warwick, and Huey Lewis — reminisce alongside musicians, engineers, and production crew about one of the most storied nights in music history.\n\nDIRECTOR: Bao Nguyen\n\nRead more about The Greatest Night in Pop. | Add to My List\n\nFebruary\n\nFeb. 2\n\nOrion and the Dark\n\nLOGLINE: Orion seems a lot like your average elementary school kid –– shy, unassuming, harboring a secret crush. But underneath his seemingly normal exterior, Orion is a ball of adolescent anxiety, completely consumed by irrational fears of bees, dogs, the ocean, cellphone waves, murderous gutter clowns, even falling off a cliff. But of all his fears, the thing he’s the most afraid of is what he confronts on a nightly basis: the dark. So when the literal embodiment of his worst fear pays a visit, Dark whisks Orion away on a roller-coaster ride around the world to prove there is nothing to be afraid of in the night. As the unlikely pair grow closer, Orion must decide if he can learn to accept the unknown –– to stop letting fear control his life and finally embrace the joy of living.\n\nVOICE CAST: Jacob Tremblay, Paul Walter Hauser, Angela Bassett, Colin Hanks, Natasia Demetriou, Golda Rosheuvel, Nat Faxon, Aparna Nancherla, Ike Barinholtz, Carla Gugino, Matt Dellapina, Nick Kishiyama, Mia Akemi Brown, Shannon Chan-Kent, Jack Fisher, and Werner Herzog\n\nDIRECTOR: Sean Charmatz\n\nRead more about Orion and the Dark. | Add to My List\n\nFeb. 9\n\nLover, Stalker, Killer\n\nLOGLINE: Dave was recently out of a long-term relationship and eager to restart his romantic life, so he did what most people do: He tried online dating. Liz and Cari were two of his most promising connections, both single moms with winning personalities who helped bring him out of his shell in different ways. It should have been an opportunity for this hardworking, devoted dad to enjoy a second chance at casual romance, but it turned into a twisted love triangle, putting Dave and everyone he cared about at risk. Using interviews with those involved — including the law enforcement officers who cracked the case — alongside vivid reenactments that bring viewers into the tension and paranoia of Dave’s four-year nightmare, this feature documentary from Curious Films (Running with the Devil) and director Sam Hobkinson (Fear City: New York vs The Mafia), deftly assembles the pieces of a mind-bending true tale of harassment, digital deception, and murder in America’s heartland.\n\nDIRECTOR: Sam Hobkinson\n\nRead more about Lover, Stalker, Killer. | Add to My List\n\nPlayers Trailer\n\nFeb. 14\n\nPlayers\n\nLOGLINE: New York sportswriter Mack (Gina Rodriguez) has spent years devising successful hookup “plays” with best friend Adam (Damon Wayans Jr.) and their crew.

As the lines between work, fun, friendship, and romance begin to blur, Mack must learn what it takes to go from simply scoring to playing for keeps.\n\nCAST: Gina Rodriguez, Damon Wayans Jr., Joel Courtney, Augustus Prew, Liza Koshy, Ego Nwodim, Marin Hinkle, and Tom Ellis\n\nDIRECTOR: Trish Sie\n\nRead more about Players. | Add to My List\n\nFeb. 16\n\nEinstein and the Bomb\n\nLOGLINE: It’s 1933 and Albert Einstein, the most famous scientist in the world, is on the run. In fear for his life, he has no choice but to abandon his German homeland as Hitler seizes power and begins the systematic persecution of the Jewish population. Einstein must find somewhere to hide from the very real threat of Nazi assassins. But where does a global celebrity disappear from view? The answer leads to a wooden hut in a field in Norfolk and the little known story of Einstein’s English hideaway. A time and place that will be a turning point in his life, between Europe and the US, between pacifism and aggression and a moment that will ultimately define his relationship with the most powerful of all inventions — the atom bomb. Using Einstein’s words only — his speeches, letters, and interviews — to script his dialogue, this innovative docudrama from BBC Studios (The Anthrax Attacks, the Emmy-winning The Surgeon’s Cut) fuses dramatic sequences with archival footage of Einstein’s life as it unfolds across both world wars, the rise and fall of fascism, and the advent of the atomic age. The result is a uniquely insightful and moving portrait of one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century and beyond.\n\nDIRECTOR: Anthony Philipson\n\nAdd to My List\n\nFeb. 23\n\nThrough My Window: Looking at You\n\nLOGLINE: After the events of the summer, Ares and Raquel can’t find a way to continue their relationship and decide to go their separate ways.
