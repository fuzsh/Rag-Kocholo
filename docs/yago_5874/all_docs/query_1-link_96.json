        "text": "Ray was a longtime Malden Police Patrol Officer.\n\nPhoto credit: Malden Police Department Facebook page\n\nThe following is from Robinson Funeral Home.\n\nAllan F. “Aldo” Ray Jr., Patrol Officer for the Malden Police Department and a resident of Wakefield, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2014, at Mass General Hospital surrounded by his loving family. Aldo was 57.\n\nAllan F. Ray was born on Nov. 27, 1956, in Malden, one of two sons of the late Allan F. Ray Sr. and Patricia (Shanahan) Ray. He was raised in Malden and graduated from the Northeast Regional Vocational School, Class of 1975. While out with friends, he received a kick from underneath the table from the love of his life, Miguelina, as an invitation to dance. They were married on March 8, 1986, and settled in Wakefield to raise their family of four.\n\nOn March 1, 1980, Allan began his life’s work of service in the Malden Police Department. With an innate ability to protect, serve and lead by example, Aldo’s professional life was defined by his work as a Patrolman for the City of Malden. He lived his life with the goal of helping others, never expecting or seeking anything in return.\n\nKnown as “Aldo” to family, friends and fellow law enforcement, Allan had a great sense of humor. Whether playing with his grandchildren or talking with community members in Malden, Aldo shared his sense of humor with everyone. He loved long car trips or “adventures” as he would call them to locations across the United States. Never predetermined, he would jump in the car with his unsuspecting wife and children and drive for hours to find pizza or snow in Maine. One of his favorite spots to visit was Pigeon Ford, Tennessee, where he returned many times for family vacations.\n\nIn addition to his devotion to his family, Aldo was a highly decorated and admired Patrol Officer for the Malden Police Department for 34 years. Noted for his professionalism, courage and bravery as a police officer, Aldo voluntarily worked overnight shifts in high crime areas. He dedicated himself to his troubled sector and balanced the tasks of a police officer with fairness, a little humor and compassion. He served residents with a kindness in his heart and helped people through difficult circumstance to make for a safer community. By blending these key ingredients and serving as a quiet role model for other officers, Aldo became a symbol for the City of Malden and beyond. He made a deep and lasting impression on everyone who met him and his reputation for professional law enforcement will continue as his legacy.\n\nHe was a member of the Vineyard Community Church in Saugus, the Converse Masonic AF&AM Lodge in Malden and the Aleppo Temple Shrine. A gun lover, Aldo had an interest in marksmanship and was a master firearm instructor. When not working, he enjoyed gardening at home in Wakefield and spending time with his family. A caring, loving husband, father and grandfather, Aldo was a source of great inspiration for his family. He was direct, but kind and through his job in law enforcement provided an extra layer of safety wherever they went. He enjoyed walks with Miguelina who he referred lovingly to as “Pickles” around Lake Quannapowitt and Breakheart Reservation. Along with his family, Allan enjoyed growing up visiting their cottage in Mount Holly, Vermont. He will be lovingly remembered by all who knew him.\n\nAllan was the beloved husband of Miguelina (Soto) Ray with whom he shared 28 years of marriage. Loving father of Jesus Montoya and his wife Rachel of Lynn, Jennie Jackson and her husband John of Hampstead, North Carolina, Allan F. Ray III of Sunrise, Florida, and Timothy M. Ray of Wakefield. Devoted brother of Michael W. Hicks of Amesbury. Cherished grandfather of Erik and Veyron Montoya and Jacob and Jonathan Jackson. Caring uncle of Katrina and Mark Hicks and many nieces and nephews.\n\nRelatives and friends will gather in honor and remembrance of Allan’s life at the Robinson Funeral Home, 809 Main St., Melrose, during visiting hours on Sunday, Oct. 5, from 2-7 p.m., and at the Vineyard Community Church, 47 Adams Ave., Saugus, where his funeral service will be celebrated on Monday at 10 a.m.\n\nGifts in Allan’s memory may be made to the Al Ray Fund, c/o Malden City Credit Union, 200 Pleasant St., Malden MA 02148.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
