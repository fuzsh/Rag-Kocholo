        "text": "I lost it all. And I am very, very bitter about it . . . The biggest mistake I ever made was discovering women. I only wish society had been as free and easy when I was coming along as it is today because if that had been the case I wouldn't have been married. Three women in my life utterly destroyed me.\n\n[on Sweet Savage (1979), a hardcore porn film in which he appeared in a non-sex role] I wanted, I guess, to see what it was all about--a kind of half-assed adventure, you know? It was also a kind of vacation for me in a bad time--a nice location in Arizona--and I picked up a few thousand bucks. After it came out, a few people wagged their fingers at me--\"Oh-ho-ho, you dirty dog\"--but I knew I hadn't done anything wrong. They shot all the sex stuff after I'd flown back to L.A. I won the adult film Oscar for that, by the way, but somebody copped it.\n\n[on John Wayne during the filming of Die grünen Teufel (1968) I never considered him much of an actor, much less a director. Wayne was just a personality--I mean, I'm a personality, too, but he was all personality. I refused to call him \"Duke\" or brown-nose around him like everybody else. One day he was telling me how to do a scene a certain way, and I said, '\"john, maybe that's the way you'd do it, but it's not the way I'm gonna do it\". [He said] \"Hey, I've been in this business for 40 years and I was a star for most of that time\". I said, \":I don't care how long you've been in the business--you've never learned a fucking thing\". He looked at me and turned around and walked away . . . He kind of admired me, and we drank together every night after work. But during work, we avoided each other. That picture shot for a long time--three months."
