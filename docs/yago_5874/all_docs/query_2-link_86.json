I want Trail Quotes to be a readable source for inspiring, challenging, and amusing information and knowledge; as well as a reliable, easy-to-use reference work for finding the precise wording, author, date, and source of the trail quotation. Many quotes just give the author. I have spent years researching to find a fuller citation for quotes you will find here. The internet has made it easier to research. But not all quotes and citations on the internet are accurate. Over the years I have discovered many quotes that I would like to add to my list, but I have not been able to verify the citation or find a full citation.\n\nMany websites, publications, and conference presentations use quotations to add interest and to emphasize the importance of trails and greenways. I hope that you might find just the right quotation for your publication or presentation, or you just might enjoy reading the quotes on their own. The quotes are arranged loosely into 53 different subject categories.\n\nIn 2001 while working for the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism as their first State Trails Coordinator I published a book Trail Quotes: From Advocacy to Wilderness. Click here to access a full text copy in PDF.\n\nDon’t forget to browse through Trail Quotes for the pure enjoyment of it. Reading the words and ideas of persons who express them well can enrich your own use of words—and your ability to express your ideas effectively in writing and speaking.\n\nQuotation: the act of repeating erroneously the words of another.\n\n—AMBROSE BIERCE, The Devil’s Dictionary, 1881-1911\n\nI am reminded of the professor who, in his declining hours, was asked by his devoted pupils for his final counsel. He replied, “Verify your quotations.”\n\n—WINSTON CHURCHILL, British Statesman, 1874–1965\n\nIt is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations.\n\n—WINSTON CHURCHILL, British Statesman, 1874–1965\n\nI hate quotations! Tell me what you know.\n\n—RALPH WALDO EMERSON, US Essayist, 1803–82\n\nBy necessity, by proclivity, and by delight, we all quote. In fact, it is as difficult to appropriate the thoughts of others as it is to invent.\n\n—RALPH WALDO EMERSON, US Essayist, 1803–82\n\nThe next best thing to being clever is being able to quote someone who is.\n\n—MARY PETTIBONE POOLE, A Glass Eye at a Keyhole, 1938\n\nIf you have questions about any quotes or citations or can provide additional quotes or information please contact me.\n\nTrails and Greenway Advocacy Quotes\n\nDo not burn yourselves out. Be as I am. A reluctant enthusiast and part-time crusader. A half-hearted fanatic. Save the other half of yourselves for pleasure and adventure. It is not enough to fight for the West. It is even more important to enjoy it while you can, while it’s still there. So get out there, hunt, fish, mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, encounter the Griz, climb a mountain, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breathe deep of that yet sweet and elusive air. Sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness of the lovely, mysterious, and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves. Keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive. And I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound people with their hearts in safe deposit boxes and their eyes hypnotized by their desk calculators. I promise you this: you will outlive the bastards.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, US Environmental Advocate, 1927–89\n\nThe most common form of terrorism in the USA is the carried on by bulldozers and chainsaws.

Sentiment without action is the ruin of the soul.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, US Environmental Advocate, 1927–89\n\nThe national parks belong to everyone. To the people. To all of us. The government keeps saying so and maybe, in this one case at least, the government is telling the truth. Hard to believe, but possible.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, US Environmental Advocate, 1927–89\n\nThe land belongs to them that love it (and will fight for it?).\n\nDICTUM: NO AUTOMOBILES IN NATIONAL PARKS.\n\nLet’s make them parks and not parking lots.\n\nFOR HUMAN BEINGS ONLY.\n\nGod bless America. Let’s save some of It!\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, Journal entry April 8, 1957, Arches, Utah\n\nEvery important change in our society, for the good, at least, has taken place because of popular pressure—pressure from below, from the great mass of people.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, One Life at a Time, Please, 1988\n\nBe a half-assed crusader, a part-time fanatic. Don’t worry to much about the fate of the world. Saving the world is only a hobby. Get out there and enjoy the world, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, husbands, wives; climb mountains, run rivers, get drunk, do whatever you want to do while you can, before it’s too late.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, US Environmental Advocate, 1927–89, quoted in The Green Lifestyle Handbook, 1989\n\n…the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, the Friends of the Earth, the Audubon Society, the Defenders of wildlife operate on this theory—those who learn to love what is spare, rough, wild, undeveloped, and unbroken will be willing to fight for it…\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, The Journey Home: Some Words in Defense of the American West, 1977\n\nIt is horrifying that we have to fight our own government to save the environment.\n\n—ANSEL ADAMS, US Photographer, 1902–84\n\nWe either have wild places or we don’t. We admit the spiritual-emotional validity of wild, beautiful places or we don’t. We have a philosophy of simplicity of experience in these wild places or we don’t. We admit an almost religious devotion to the clean exposition of the wild, natural earth or we don’t.\n\n—ANSEL ADAMS, US Photographer, 1902–84\n\nWe who are gathered here may represent a particularly elite, not of money and power, but of concern for the earth for the earth’s sake.\n\n—ANSEL ADAMS, US Photographer, 1902–84\n\nPeople can be divided into three groups: those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what happened. Showing up is 80% of life.\n\n—WOODY ALLEN, US Film Actor, Director, Writer, 1935-\n\nIn the 19th century, we devoted our best minds to exploring nature. In the 20th century, we devoted ourselves to controlling and harnessing it. In the 21st century, we must devote ourselves to restoring it.\n\n—STEPHEN AMBROSE, US Historian, 1936-2002\n\nAmericans are seeking trail opportunities as never before. No longer are trails only for the ‘rugged individualists’ pursuing a solitary trek through breathtaking wilderness … users include young people and senior citizens, families, individuals and organized groups, people with disabilities and the physically fit.\n\n—AMERICAN TRAILS, Trails for All Americans report, 1990\n\n…key factor in the development and planning of most trails is local, grassroots efforts: that is, the citizens who drive the local, state, and federal government to act. Everything from establishing the vision and need for greenways to defining specific trail corridors, to participating in the zoning process, to forming citizen coalitions, to developing guidelines for trail use and access should be within the abilities of each citizen. With broad-based support, the vision of a national system of trails can be realized.\n\n—AMERICAN TRAILS, Trails for All Americans report, 1990\n\nA common danger unites even the bitterest enemies.\n\n—ARISTOTLE, Greek Philosopher, 384–322 BC\n\nIf we are to continue to be able to resort to the woods and use trails without restriction, there is need for action.

Before you can get out and champion your project, you need a vision, a plan and maps that show preferred routes and other features.\n\n—BAY AREA RIDGE TRAIL COUNCIL, In Support of Trails: A Guide to Successful Trail Advocacy, 1993\n\nIf there’s one essential ingredient to creating trails and trail systems, it’s people. All the land and financing in the world won’t blaze a trail if there aren’t people championing the project.\n\n—BAY AREA RIDGE TRAIL COUNCIL, In Support of Trails: A Guide to Successful Trail Advocacy, 1993\n\nDon’t keep forever on the public road, going only where others have gone. Leave the beaten path occasionally and dive into the woods. You will be certain to find something you have never seen before.\n\n—ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL, Scottish Scientist, Inventor, 1847-1922\n\nAt that moment, bicycling found its way into my marrow. It became my passion, pleasure and career.\n\n—MIA BIRK, Joyride: Pedaling Toward A Healthier Planet, 2010\n\nIt is at the local, community level where successful trail networks begin.\n\n—BRANDYWINE CONSERVANCY, Community Trails Handbook, 1997\n\nPolitics is democracy’s way of handling public business.

I have felt bound by a solemn obligation to do what I could—if I didn’t at least try I could never be happy again in nature.\n\n—RACHEL CARSON, Naturalist, Writer, 1907-64\n\nThe more clearly we can focus our attention on the wonders and realities of the universe about us, the less taste we shall have for destruction.\n\n—RACHEL CARSON, Naturalist, Writer, 1907-64\n\n…the factors leading to the rise of the consumer hiker in the late 1960s continue to influence the community today, so that of the thirty-four million Americans who hiked in 2012, less than 1 percent were active club members.

Once this relationship is recognized, it becomes obvious how we can best serve our own needs by improving our physical surroundings. In an increasingly diverse nation, in which our social, intellectual, and spiritual realities can be as varied as our genealogy, the physical world is the one thing that we truly share.

When we know different, we do different.\n\n—CAROLYN FINNEY, Black Faces, White Places: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors, 2014\n\nThe greenway concept has spread across the state [North Carolina] to almost every major municipality.… I think that one of the things that’s impressive is that the energy is coming from the citizens rather than the government units.\n\n—CHARLES A. “CHUCK” FLINK, President of Greenways Inc., as quoted in Corridors of Green, Wildlife in North Carolina, 1988\n\nChange is not progress.\n\n—HENRY FORD, US Industrialist, 1863–1947\n\nHow wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.\n\n—ANNE FRANK, German Jewish Diarist, 1929-45; The Diary of a Young Girl, 1947\n\nYou never change things by fighting the existing reality.

It comes from an indomitable will.\n\n—MAHATMA GANDHI, Indian Nationalist Leader, 1869–1948\n\nPeople who have committed to a service/advocacy role will tell you that some of the sublimest pleasure they have ever experienced comes in the context of that work.

It can be a powerful method for creating change.\n\n—MIKE LYDON & ANTHONY GARCIA, Tactical Urbanism: Short-term Action for Long-term Change, 2015\n\nMy own doctrine of organization is that any body of people coming together for a purpose (whatever it may be) should consist of persons wholly wedded to said purpose and should consist of nobody else. If the purpose be Cannibalism (preference for Ham a la Capitalism) then nobody but a Cannibal should be admitted.

Americans living together and joining in associations across the country—this is where the tremendous strength and vision of our people will be tapped.

The better you understand the agency, the more effective you will be.\n\n—JOAN SHAW, editor, Citizens and Natural Resources: A Perspective on Public Involvement, 1973\n\nOne of the best tactics for citizens who want power is simply to obtain good information and persistently and repeatedly articulate their views in public involvement procedures.\n\n—JOAN SHAW, editor, Citizens and Natural Resources: A Perspective on Public Involvement, 1973\n\nThere are no shortcuts to any place worth going.\n\n—BEVERLY SILLS, US Operatic Soprano, 1929-2007\n\n…for those who can, one of the things to do is not to move. To stay put. That doesn’t mean don’t travel; it means have a place and get involved in what can be done in that place. That’s the only way we’re going to have a representative democracy in America. Nobody stays anywhere long enough to take responsibility for a local community.\n\n—GARY SNYDER, US Poet, 1930-\n\nThe fight for free space—for wilderness and for public space—must be accompanied by a fight for free time to spend wandering in that space. Otherwise the individual imagination will be bulldozed over for the chain-store outlets of consumer appetite, true-crime titillations, and celebrity crises.\n\n—REBECCA SOLNIT, Wanderlust: A History of Walking, 2000\n\nToo often, the advocates of trails and linear parks along rights-of-way come up against officials who recognize only one kind of park—the squared-off kind that comes in chunks; and one kind of recreation—the supervised kind known as ‘organized sweating.’ Such officials refuse to acknowledge that there has been a change in US recreation trends, reflected in the phenomenal growth of hiking, biking, and horseback riding….\n\n—CONSTANCE STALLINGS, Let’s Use Our Rights-of-Way, Reader’s Digest, 1970\n\nThe most ominous of fallacies—the belief that things can be kept static by inaction.\n\n—FREYA STARK, French Adventurer, 1893-1993\n\n‘Wilderness is a resource that can shrink but not grow,’ Aldo Leopold once remarked, and went on to observe that it takes intellectual humility to understand the cultural value of nature unaltered and unimproved. Nobody ever accused a government agency of intellect or humility (or, for that matter, the capacity to manage land), but we have reached a point in our historical development when stale jokes about the ‘Forest Circus’ and the ‘Bureau of Livestock and Mining’ and the principles of ‘multiple abuse’ and ‘sustained greed’ no longer serve to mask bemusement with amusement.\n\n—PAGE STEGNER, Outposts of Eden, 1989\n\nI am what is around me. [First line of the poem Theory]\n\n—WALLACE STEVENS, US poet, 1879-1955\n\nFor the next century, we’ve got to put together what we so carelessly tore apart with so little concern for those who were gonna follow us. … You’ve got to sound off.\n\n—STUDS TERKEL, US Interviewer, Writer, 1912-2008\n\nOrdinary people are capable of doing extraordinary things, and that’s what it’s all about. They must count.\n\n—STUDS TERKEL, US Interviewer, Writer, 1912-2008\n\nThe answer is to say ‘No!’ to authority when authority is wrong.\n\n—STUDS TERKEL, US Interviewer, Writer, 1912-2008\n\nIt is not enough to be busy, so are the ants. The question is what are you busy about?\n\n—HENRY DAVID THOREAU, US Writer, Naturalist, 1817–62\n\nThere is no comparison between an overwide trail or a flattened, well-used camping site and a clear-cut forest or a strip-mined mountainside. The real threats to the wilderness come from logging, mining, overgrazing, dams, downhill ski resorts, mass tourism developments, and other large-scale projects. Who opposes these schemes? Often it is people who have learned to love wild places by walking and camping in them, by treating them softly and leaving little trace of their passing.\n\n—CHRIS TOWNSEND, The Advanced Backpacker, 2001\n\nWhat we need now is a culture that deeply loves the wild earth.\n\n—JACK TURNER, The Abstract Wild, 1996\n\nWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.\n\n—MARK TWAIN (SAMUEL CLEMENS), US Writer and Humorist, 1835–1910\n\nSociety as we know it is almost a conspiracy against human health. One of the main forces working to counteract that is the trailsman.\n\n—STEWART UDALL, US Secretary of the Interior (1961–69), 1920-2010\n\nPublic participation is an instrument act by which citizens influence their government….\n\n—SIDNEY VERBA, America: Political Democracy and Social Equality, 1972\n\nOur wretched species is so made that those who walk on the well-trodden path always throw stones at those who are showing a new road.\n\n—VOLTAIRE, French Writer, Philosopher, 1694-1778\n\nAll glory comes from daring to begin.\n\n—EUGENE FITCH WARE, US Journalist, Politician, Poet, 1841-1911\n\nCourage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway.\n\n—JOHN WAYNE, US Actor, 1907-79\n\nI arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and the desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.\n\n—E.B. WHITE, US Writer, 1899-1985\n\nFind something that matters deeply to you and pursue it. Question. Stand. Speak. Act. Make us uncomfortable. Make us think.\n\n—TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS, Naturalist, Writer, 1955-\n\n…the choices and decisions we make in terms of how we use the land ultimately affect our very DNA. Environmental issues are life issues.\n\n—TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS, Naturalist, Writer, 1955-\n\nOur power lies in our love of our homelands.\n\n—TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS, The Open Space of Democracy, 2004\n\nThe heart is the path to wisdom because it dares to be vulnerable in the presence of power.\n\n—TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS, The Open Space of Democracy, 2004\n\nAs we go, so goes the world, for the world is us. The revolution that will save the world is ultimately a personal one.\n\n—MARIANNE WILLIAMSON, US Author, 1952-\n\nIf you want to make enemies, try to change something.\n\n—WOODROW WILSON, Twenty-eight US President (1913–21), 1856–1924\n\nIf you choose the quick and easy path … you will become an agent of evil.\n\n—YODA, in Star Wars movie, 1977\n\nDo or do not. There is no try.\n\n—YODA, in Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back movie, 1980\n\nAdvocacy\n\nBack to top of page\n\nBackpacking Quotes\n\nBackpacking is the art of knowing what not to take.\n\n—SHERIDAN ANDERSON, Baron Von Mabel’s Backpacking, 1980\n\nWhy not seize the pleasure at once? How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!\n\n—JANE AUSTIN, English Writer, 1775-1817\n\nIdeal hiking partnerships are mutually beneficial in that each member of the party contributes to the experience of the other and benefits in kind. Partners split decision-making and burdens; lend each other encouragement; and share their thoughts, feelings, fears, and hopes.\n\n—ANGELA & DUFFY BALLARD, A Blistered Kind of Love: One Couple’s Trial by Trail, 2003\n\nWith long-distance hiking comfort is found in other’s reassurance that you’re not completely crazy.\n\n—ANGELA & DUFFY BALLARD, A Blistered Kind of Love: One Couple’s Trial by Trail, 2003\n\nThe backpacker’s ethos is straight out of the American rugged individualism playbook, celebrating solitude in nature, making do with little, and stoic survival rather than comfort.\n\n—LAUREL BRADLEY and SAM DEMAS, Hut to Hut USA: The Complete Guide for Hikers, Bikers, and Skiers, 2021\n\nThe fascinating quality of all sorts of wilderness and backcountry travel lies in the reduction of life to its essentials: food, shelter, beauty; the confrontation with forces and circumstances which are at once comprehensible, mysterious, and so powerful that they will not be denied.\n\n—RAYMOND BRIDGE, America’s Backpacking Book, 1973\n\nI never imagined that existence could be so simple, so uncluttered, so Spartan, so free of baggage, so sublimely gratifying. I have reduced the weight of my pack to 35 pounds and yet I can’t think of a single thing I really need that I can’t find, either within myself, or within my pack.\n\n—DAVID BRILL, As Far as the Eye Can See, 1990\n\nBackpacking forces one, by necessity, to walk the balance line, the edge of the sword, between disciplined deprivation and hedonistic gratification: a tiring, sweat-soaking day ends with a plunge into a cool stream; an arduous, lung-bursting climb is followed by a magnificent panoramic sweeping view; and there is the continuous contrast between life on the trail and civilized pleasures—a warm meal, a hot shower, clean dry clothes. It is by walking this line between sacrifice and satisfaction that one finds fulfillment.\n\n—ROBERT BROWNE, The Appalachian Trail: History, Humanity, and Ecology, 1980\n\nBy the backpacking boom of the 1960s and 1970s, the model of the lone hiker would compete directly with organized hiking and threaten to undermine the dominance of the country’s strongest and most active hiking clubs.\n\n— SILAS CHAMBERLIN, On the Trail: A History of American Hiking, 2016\n\nThe more you know, the less you need.\n\n—YVON CHOUINARD, Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman, 2005\n\nI feel so independent now. I can get anywhere I want to. I have the few essentials I need, and the few other things I need or want I can derive from the land. (on starting his 200-mile solo trek through the Brooks Range)\n\n—DAVID COOPER, Brooks Range Passage, 1982\n\nTo walk well, you hike light—light on yourself, light on your budget, light on the land.\n\n—MARLYN DOAN, Hiking Light, 1982\n\nDon’t fight the trail. You have to flow with it. You can’t make a mountain any less steep or an afternoon any cooler or the day any longer, so don’t waste your energy complaining. Time and distance and terrain and the trail itself cannot be changed. You have to change yourself. You have to adapt your heart, mind and soul to the trail. For every five days on the trail, you can expect one day to be uncomfortably wet, one day to be uncomfortably dry, one day to be uncomfortably hot, one day to be uncomfortably cold, and one day to be comfortable.\n\n—WARREN DOYLE, since 1973 has hiked Appalachian Trail 18 times, 1950-\n\nHanging over our planning was the ever present problem of weight; if everything was to be carried on our backs, it must be pared to the last ounce.\n\n—PAUL FINK, Backpacking Was the Only Way, 1975\n\nOur outfits were never the same from trip to trip, for between each time something new had been seen, heard of, or devised that seemed to offer promise of improvement. The perfect outfit was ever an elusive goal to be sought, but never reached.\n\n—PAUL FINK, Backpacking Was the Only Way, 1975\n\nOur plans were seldom adhered to, and generally much altered en route. That mattered little to us, for all our needed supplies were in the packs on our backs; we could make camp in one place just as well as in another.\n\n—PAUL FINK, Backpacking Was the Only Way, 1975\n\nI found myself feeling sorry for any man who was not free to abandon whatever futility detained him and to walk away into the desert morning with a pack on his back.\n\n—COLIN FLETCHER, The Thousand-Mile Summer, 1964\n\nEven in these mercifully emancipated decades, many people still seem quite seriously alarmed at the prospect of sleeping away from officially consecrated campsites, with no more equipment than they can carry on their backs. When pressed, they babble about snakes or bears or even, by God, bandits. But the real barrier, I’m sure, is the unknown.\n\n—COLIN FLETCHER, The Complete Walker, 1968\n\nAlthough the vast majority of walkers never even think of using a walking staff, I unhesitatingly include it among the foundations of the house that travels on my back.\n\n—COLIN FLETCHER, The Complete Walker III, 1989\n\nFrankly, I fail to see how going for a six-month, thousand-mile walk through deserts and mountains can be judged less real than spending six months working eight hours a day, five days a week, in order to earn enough money to be able to come back to a comfortable home in the evening and sit in front of a TV screen and watch the two-dimensional image of some guy talking about a book he has written on a six-month, thousand-mile walk through deserts and mountains.\n\n—COLIN FLETCHER, The Complete Walker III, 1989\n\nMostly, two miles an hour is good going.\n\n—COLIN FLETCHER, The Complete Walker III, 1989\n\nUnder most conditions, the best roof for your bedroom is the sky. This commonsense arrangement saves weight, time, energy, and money.\n\n—COLIN FLETCHER, The Complete Walker III, 1989\n\nBackpacking also gives a person a chance to discover innumerable out of the way places, inaccessible to mechanized travelers.\n\n—RAY JARDINE, Trail Life, 2009\n\nSo a long hike can be a test of abilities: not only of physical strength and stamina, but of adaptability as well. It can be truly a test of self and a journey of discovery.\n\n—RAY JARDINE, Trail Life, 2009\n\nIt is one of the blessings of wilderness life that it shows us how few things we need in order to be perfectly happy.\n\n—HORACE KEPHART, Camping and Woodcraft, 1917\n\nThe man who goes afoot, prepared to camp anywhere and in any weather, is the most independent fellow on earth.\n\n—HORACE KEPHART, Camping and Woodcraft, 1917\n\nThe man with the knapsack is never lost. No matter whither he may stray, his food and shelter are right with him, and home is wherever he may choose to stop.\n\n—HORACE KEPHART, Camping and Woodcraft, 1917\n\nTo equip a pedestrian with shelter, bedding, utensils, food, and other necessities, in a pack so light and small that he can carry it without overstrain, is really a fine art.\n\n—HORACE KEPHART, Camping and Woodcraft, 1917\n\nThink what a great world revolution will take place when … [there are] millions of guys all over the world with rucksacks on their backs tramping around the back country….\n\n—JACK KEROUAC, The Dharma Bums, 1958\n\nIt is an old custom of these people to pick up a stone and toss it on the pile. Perhaps it is a symbolical lightening of the load they carry, perhaps a small offering to the gods of the trails.\n\n—LOUIS L’AMOUR, The Lonesome Gods, Western Writer, 1908–88\n\nA gadget industry pads the bumps against nature-in-the-raw; woodcraft becomes the art of using gadgets.\n\n—ALDO LEOPOLD, US Conservationist, 1887–1948\n\nThen came the gadgeteer, otherwise known as the sporting-goods dealer. He has draped the American outdoorsman with an infinity of contraptions, all offered as aids to self-reliance, hardihood, woodcraft, or marksmanship, but too often functioning as substitutes for them. Gadgets fill the pockets, they dangle from neck and belt. The overflow fills the auto-trunk and also the trailer. Each item of outdoor equipment grows lighter and often better, but the aggregate poundage becomes tonnage.\n\n—ALDO LEOPOLD, A Sand County Almanac, 1949\n\nLong walks with a pack on one’s back are necessary in time of war, but I do not see why a man should go on marching in times of peace.\n\n—ROBERT LYND, The Blue Lion, 1923\n\nWalk in joy, friends.\n\n—HARVEY MANNING, Backpacking: One Step At a Time, 1975\n\nThe purpose of a wilderness journey is not to get from one end of the [trail] to the other, but to enjoy the landscape, and adapt to its ever changing moods.\n\n—BILL MASON, Canadian Naturalist, 1929-88\n\nThe rule of thumb for the old backpacking was that the weight of your pack should equal the weight of yourself and the kitchen range combined. Just a casual glance at the full pack sitting on the floor could give you a double hernia and fuse four vertebrae. After carrying the pack all day, you had to remember to tie one leg to a tree before you dropped it. Otherwise you would float off into space. The pack eliminated the need for any special kind of ground-gripping shoes, because your feet would sink a foot and a half into hard-packed earth, two inches into solid rock.\n\n—PATRICK MCMANUS, A Fine and Pleasant Misery, 1978\n\n‘I think,’ said Christopher Robin, ‘that we ought to eat all our Provisions now, so we shan’t have so much to carry.’\n\n—A.A. MILNE, Winnie-the-Pooh, 1954\n\nEvery morning, the [thru] hiker’s options are reduced to two: walk or quit. Once that decision is made, all the others (when to eat, where to sleep) begin to fall into place.\n\n—ROBERT MOOR, On Trails: An Exploration, 2016\n\nI made these Sierra trips, carrying only a sackful of bread with a little tea and sugar, and was thus independent and free….\n\n—JOHN MUIR, US Naturalist, 1838–1914\n\nMy meals were easily made, for they were all alike and simple, only a cupful of tea and bread.\n\n—JOHN MUIR, US Naturalist, 1838–1914\n\nWalk away quietly in any direction and taste the freedom of the mountaineer. Camp out among the grass and the gentians of glacier meadows, in craggy nooks.\n\n—JOHN MUIR, US Naturalist, 1838–1914\n\nWe do not go to the green woods and crystal waters to rough it, we go to smooth it. We get it rough enough at home, in towns and cities.\n\n—NESSMUK (G.W. SEARS), Woodcraft, 1963\n\nTwo questions we have been asked repeatedly all through the South: ‘You-all get paid for doing this, don’t you?’ and, ‘Are you working for the government?’ That we should be carrying heavy packs, sticking to the mountain trails, and camping out as we go, doing no hunting along the way, merely for fun, is of course completely incomprehensible! All through this region, nearly every man or boy encountered is carrying a gun; most of them say they would not think of venturing into the mountains without one.\n\n—GEORGE OUTERBRIDGE, Maine to Georgia—All the Way, Hiking the Appalachian Trail, edited by James Hare, 1975\n\nIf you are free, I recommend a hiking trip on a wilderness footpath. How inspiring it is to walk all day in the sunshine and sleep all night under the stars. What a wonderful experience in simple, natural living. Since you carry your food, sleeping equipment, etc., on your back, you learn quickly that unnecessary possessions are unnecessary burdens. You soon realize what the essentials of life are—such as warmth when you are cold, a dry spot on a rainy day, the simplest food when you are hungry, pure cool water when you are thirsty. You soon put material things in their proper place, realizing that they are there for use, but relinquishing them when they are not useful. You soon experience and learn to appreciate that great freedom of simplicity.\n\n—PEACE PILGRIM, Peace Pilgrim: Her Life and Work in Her Own Words, 1982\n\nLong distance hiking is not a vacation, it’s too long for that. It’s not recreation, too much toil and pain involved. It is, we decide, a way of life, a very simplified Spartan way of living … life on the move … heavy packs, sweating brow; they make you appreciate warm sunshine, companionship, cool water. The best way to appreciate these things that are precious and important in life it is take them away.\n\n—CINDY ROSS, Journey on the Crest: Walking 2600 Miles from Mexico to Canada, 1987\n\nWhen you stay out there long enough, you learn that sooner or later the rain stops and the sun comes out, actually and metaphorically. You become stronger. You persevere. The hardship passes.\n\n—CINDY ROSS, The World is Our Classroom: How One Family Used Nature and Travel to Shape an Extraordinary Education, 2018\n\nReturning home is the most difficult part of long-distance hiking; You have grown outside the puzzle and your piece no longer fits.\n\n—CINDY ROSS, Journey on the Crest: Walking 2600 Miles from Mexico to Canada, 1987\n\nGot my pack on. Have to keep going.\n\n—JEFFREY H. RYAN, Appalachian Odyssey: A 28-Year Hike on America’s Trail, 2016\n\nHe who would travel happily must travel light.\n\n—ANTOINE de SAINT-EXUPÉRY, Wind, Sand, and Stars, 1939\n\nThis is a time when the whole nation is turning toward the outdoor life, seeking in it the physical regeneration so needful for continued national existence.\n\n—ERNEST THOMPSON SETON, The Birch-bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians, 1907\n\nI always said wherever I go, the pack goes with me.\n\n—EARL SHAFFER, first uninterrupted solo-hike of the entire length of the Appalachian Trail (1948), 1918-2002\n\nCarry as little as possible. But choose that little with care.\n\n—EARL SHAFFER, first uninterrupted solo-hike of the entire length of the Appalachian Trail (1948), 1918-2002\n\nCarry on your back and between your ears what is appropriate for your trip objectives and the conditions.\n\n—ANDREW SKURKA, The Ultimate Hiker’s Gear Guide, Second Edition, 2017\n\nMy most successful backpacking trips have been those for which I had honest, accurate, and well-informed answers to three questions: 1) What are my objectives, in terms of the time I will spend hiking relative to camping? 2) What environmental and route conditions will I likely encounter, such as temperatures, precipitation, and biting insects? 3) What gear, supplies, and skills will best help me achieve my objectives and keep me safe and comfortable in those conditions?\n\n—ANDREW SKURKA, The Ultimate Hiker’s Gear Guide, Second Edition, 2017\n\nPeople pack their fears.\n\n—ANDREW SKURKA, The Ultimate Hiker’s Gear Guide, Second Edition, 2017\n\nDuring the first day or so of any tour there are moments of bitterness, when the traveler feels more than coldly towards his knapsack, when he is half in a mind to throw it bodily over the hedge…\n\n—ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, Walking Tours, 1876\n\nIt’s a good day to start a long walk. It’s a good day to go back to the wild places.\n\n—WALKIN’ JIM STOLTZ, Walking with the Wild Wind: Reflections on a Montana Journey, 2003\n\nThere is an intense but simple thrill in setting off in the morning on a mountain trail, knowing that everything you need is on your back. It is a confidence in having left the inessentials behind and of entering a world of natural beauty that has not been violated, where money has no value, and possessions are a dead weight. The person with the fewest possessions is the freest. Thoreau was right.\n\n—PAUL THEROUX, The Happy Isles of Oceania: Paddling the Pacific, 1992\n\nMore backpacking trips are ruined by sore feet than by all other causes combined. Pounded by the ground below and the weight of you and your pack above, your feet receive harsher treatment than any other part of your body.\n\n—CHRIS TOWNSEND, The Backpacker’s Handbook, 1996\n\nThe key to my success in completing the entire [Appalachian] trail was due to never overestimating my own abilities and rarely underestimating the difficulty of the trail.\n\n—BILL WALKER, Skywalker: Close Encounters on the Appalachian Trail, 2008\n\nThe most important quality a [long distance] thru-hiker posses is the determination to succeed. Resolve and even courage are needed to get through the tough times: rain, snow, scorching sun, insects, unfavorable terrain. The rewards are the good times: beautiful scenery, outdoor life, increased feeling of self-worth, new friends.\n\n—CHRISTOPHER WHALEN, The Appalachian Trail: Workbook for Planning Thru-Hikes, 1992\n\nWhen you walk, you know the distance you’ve covered in your tired bones, and it’s impossible to go so far that you lose the thread of continuity between “there” and “here.”\n\n—KELLY WINTERS, Walking Home: A Woman’s Pilgrimage on the Appalachian Trail, 2001\n\nBackpacking\n\nBack to top of page\n\nTrails and Greenway Benefits Quotes\n\nOur suicidal poets (Plath, Berryman, Lowell, Jarrell, et al.) spent too much of their lives inside rooms and classrooms when they should have been trudging up mountains, slogging through swamps, rowing down rivers. The indoor life is the next best thing to premature burial.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, US Environmental Advocate, 1927–89\n\nIt’s all still there in heart and soul. The walk, the hills, the sky, the solitary pain and pleasure—they will grow larger, sweeter, lovelier in the days and years to come.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, Beyond the Wall, 1984\n\nTrails have multiple values and their benefits reach far beyond recreation. Trails can enrich the quality of life for individuals, make communities more livable, and protect, nurture, and showcase America’s grandeur by traversing areas of natural beauty, distinctive geography, historic significance, and ecological diversity. Trails are important for the nation’s health, economy, resource protection and education.\n\n—AMERICAN TRAILS, Trails for All Americans report, 1990\n\nWhy Trails?\n\n• Trails promote health and fitness by providing an enjoyable and safe place for bicycling, walking, and jogging, removed from the hazards of motor vehicles.\n\n• Trails contribute to economic vitality, increased property values and increases in regional tourism.\n\n• Trails help protect resources and preserve open space by defining zones free of human habitation and development.\n\n• Trails educate young and old Americans alike about the value and importance of the natural environment.\n\n• Trails offer an alternative to motorized vehicles, connecting homes with schools, offices, and shopping areas and contribute to a healthier environment, with cleaner air and less traffic congestion.\n\n• 155 million people walk for pleasure, 93 million bicycle, 41 million hike, trails provide access to 43 million for nature study, photography, small game hunting or primitive camping, 10 million ride horses on trails, 5 million backpack, and 11 million ski on trails.\n\n—AMERICAN TRAILS, Trails for All Americans report, 1990\n\nAlways in big woods, when you leave familiar ground and step off alone to a new place, there will be, along with feelings of curiosity and excitement, a little nagging of dread. It is the ancient fear of the unknown, and it is your bond with the wilderness you are going into. What you are doing is exploring. You are understanding the first experience, not of the place, but of yourself in that place. It is the experience of our essential loneliness, for nobody can discover the world for anybody else. It is only after we have discovered it for ourselves that it becomes common ground, and a common bond, and we cease to be alone.\n\n—WENDELL BERRY, The Unknown Wilderness: An Essay on Kentucky’s Red River Gorge, 1971\n\nWhen you build bike paths and lanes, or design streets more subtly to be attractive places to bike, people drag their dusty bikes out of the garage and ride.\n\n—ELLY BLUE, Bikenomics: How Bicycling Can Save The Economy, 2013\n\nWhen you make streets inviting, convenient, and comfortable for bicycling, people come ride on them in droves.\n\n—ELLY BLUE, Bikenomics: How Bicycling Can Save The Economy, 2013\n\nFrontcountry parks and trails provide affordable, low-barrier portals for urban communities to enter the natural world, to learn outdoor skills, and to experience the healing balm of trees, grass, rocks, and waterways.\n\n—LAUREL BRADLEY and SAM DEMAS, Hut to Hut USA: The Complete Guide for Hikers, Bikers, and Skiers, 2021\n\nTrails encourage us to socialize and have meaningful human contact, because they get us out of our steel-encapsulated driving machines.\n\n—DAVID BURWELL, President, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy (1998), 1947-2017\n\nSo much of the magic of trails has little to do with economic benefit and everything to do with human interactions and joy-inducing nature experiences.\n\n—AMY CAMP, Deciding on Trails: 7 Practices of Healthy Trail Towns, 2020\n\nTrail quality matters.\n\n—AMY CAMP, Deciding on Trails: 7 Practices of Healthy Trail Towns, 2020\n\nRecreation in the open is of the finest grade. The moral benefits are all positive. The individual with any soul cannot live long in the presence of towering mountains or sweeping plains without getting a little of the high moral standard of Nature infused into his being … with eyes opened, the great story of the Earth’s forming, the history of a tree, the life of a flower or the activities of some small animal will all unfold themselves to the recreationist….\n\n—ARTHUR CARHART, USDA Forest Service’s first Landscape Architect (1919), 1892–1978\n\nAs I’ve come to say, trails may not be a vaccine, but they can serve as a tonic－creating space to foster our health and well-being, and helping our people and communities persevere…and emerge stronger.\n\n—RYAN CHAO, President, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, Fall 2020\n\n…the most distinctive and perhaps the most impressive characteristic of American scenery is its wildness.\n\n—THOMAS COLE, US Romantic Landscape Painter, 1801-48\n\nWhen we are distressed, going outside for some fresh air, taking a walk in the park, or wandering deep into the woods quickens our attention, bringing us instantly into the present. Being outdoors provides mental space and clarity, allowing our bodies to relax and our hearts to feel more at ease. Putting ourselves in the midst of something greater than our personal dramas, difficulties and pain—as we do when we walk in the open plains, hike in rarefied mountain air, or ramble on an empty beach—can give us a sense of space and openness, lifting us out of our narrow selves. Similarly, gazing up at the vast night sky helps us see our problems and concerns with greater context and perspective. The natural world communicates its profound message: things are okay as they are; you are okay just as you are; simply relax and be present.\n\n—MARK COLEMAN, Awake in the Wild: Mindfulness in Nature as a Path of Self Discovery, 2006\n\nIt does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.\n\n—CONFUCIUS, Chinese Philosopher, 551–479 BC\n\nFoot and horse trails offer the best opportunities for large numbers of people to escape the pressures of mechanized urban life and to enjoy the finest kind of healthful outdoor recreation in unspoiled natural environments.\n\n—GRANT CONWAY, Hearing to Establish a Nationwide System of Trails, held March 6-7, 1967\n\nMountains have a decent influence on men. I have never met along the trails of the high mountains a mean man who would cheat and steal. Certainly most men who are raised there or who work there are as wholesome as the mountains themselves. Those who explore them or foot or horseback usually are open, friendly men.\n\n—WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS, Supreme Court Justice, Avid Hiker, 1898–1980\n\nThe thrill of tramping alone and unafraid through a wilderness of lakes, creeks, alpine meadows, and glaciers is not known to many. A civilization can be built around the machine but it is doubtful that a meaningful life can be produced by it.… When man worships at the feet of avalanche lilies or discovers the delicacies of the pasque flower or finds the faint perfume of the phlox on rocky ridges, he will come to know that the real glories are God’s creations. When he feels the wind blowing through him on a high peak or sleeps under a closely matted white bark pine in an exposed basin, he is apt to find his relationship to the universe.\n\n—WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS, Supreme Court Justice, Avid Hiker, 1898–1980\n\nI learned early that the richness of life is found in adventure. Adventure calls on all the faculties of mind and spirit. It develops self-reliance and independence. Life then teems with excitement. But man is not ready for adventure unless he is rid of fear. For fear confines him and limits his scope. He stays tethered by strings of doubt and indecision and has only a small and narrow world to explore.\n\n—WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS, Of Men and Mountains, 1950\n\nWhen man ventures into the wilderness, climbs the ridges, and sleeps in the forest, he comes in close communion with his Creator. When man pits himself against the mountain, he taps inner springs of his strength. He comes to know himself.\n\n—WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS, Of Men and Mountains, 1950\n\nA walk in the woods … is one of the secrets for dodging old age.\n\n—RALPH WALDO EMERSON, US Essayist, 1803–82\n\nThe influence of fine scenery, the presence of mountains, appeases our irritations and elevates our friendships.\n\n—RALPH WALDO EMERSON, Culture, The Conduct of Life, 1860\n\nDetails of the many walks I made along the crest have blurred, now, into a pleasing tapestry of grass and space and sunlight.\n\n—COLIN FLETCHER, The Secret Worlds of Colin Fletcher, 1989\n\nA targeted rural economic development strategy that features the development of interconnected greenways would yield positive results for many American communities. We should not have to travel to foreign countries to fully understand and appreciated the value that this type of coordinated federal, state, and local economic strategy can and will have on American communities.\n\n—CHARLES A. “CHUCK” FLINK, The Greenway Imperative: Connecting Communities and Landscapes for a Sustainable Future, 2020\n\nDuring the past thirty-five years, I have made the case for the economic benefits of greenways in the many communities across America, and for communities around the word.\n\n—CHARLES A. “CHUCK” FLINK, The Greenway Imperative: Connecting Communities and Landscapes for a Sustainable Future, 2020\n\nThe trail has taught me much. I know now the varied voices of the coyote—the wizard of the mesa. I know the solemn call of herons and the mocking cry of the loon. I remember a hundred lovely lakes, and recall the fragrant breath of pine and fir and cedar and poplar trees. The trail has strung upon it, as upon a thread of silk, opalescent dawns and saffron sunsets. It has given me blessed release from care and worry and the troubled thinking of our modern day. It has been a return to the primitive and the peaceful. Whenever the pressure of our complex city life thins my blood and benumbs my brain, I seek relief in the trail; and when I hear a coyote wailing to the yellow dawn, my cares fall from me—I am happy.\n\n—HAMLIN GARLAND, Hitting the Trail, McClure’s, February 1899\n\nAs you sit on the hillside, or lie prone under the trees of the forest, or sprawl wet-legged by a mountain stream, the great door, that does not look like a door, opens.\n\n—STEPHEN GRAHAM, The Gentle Art of Tramping, 1926\n\nWhen it comes to property value, having a rail-trail nearby is a proven benefit.\n\n—PETER HARNIK, From Rails to Trails: The Making of America’s Active Transportation Network, 2021\n\nPeople need immediate places to refresh, reinvent themselves. Our surroundings built and natural alike, have an immediate and a continuing effect on the way we feel and act, and on our health and intelligence. These places have an impact on our sense of self, our sense of safety, the kind of work we get done, the ways we interact with other people, even our ability to function as citizens in a democracy. In short, the places where we spend our time affect the people we are and can become.\n\n—TONY HISS, The Experience of Place, 1990\n\nWhenever we make changes in our surroundings, we can too easily shortchange ourselves, by cutting ourselves off from some of the sights and sounds, the shapes or textures, or other information from a place that have helped mold our understanding and are now necessary for us to thrive. Overdevelopment and urban sprawl can damage our own lives as much as they damage our cities and countryside.\n\n—TONY HISS, The Experience of Place, 1990\n\nThe mountains, the forest, and the sea, render men savage; they develop the fierce, but yet do not destroy the human.\n\n—VICTOR HUGO, French Poet, Novelist, Dramatist, 1802–85\n\nIt’s just a plain, bottom-level love of nature. I think that’s a primal instinct we all have, maybe I just have more of it. I’ve lived it, I know how much being in the wilderness can enrich my life.\n\n—RAY JARDINE, Go-Light Backpacking Advocate, 1948-\n\nThe wilderness can seem to hammer us with fatigue, rain and insects, or it can enrich us with the joys of adventure and discovery. The determining factor is our attitude.\n\n—RAY JARDINE, Trail Life, 2009\n\nRetaining a feeling of significance is becoming ever more difficult in our society of giant enterprises, directed by bureaucracy in which man becomes a smaller cog in a bigger machine. In too many cases they live and die without having confronted the fundamental realities of human existence. Their fragmented and piecemeal lives do not teach them the wholeness, unity and purpose that they need in order to be satisfied and secure. Outdoor recreation experiences can help mold into people the wholeness concept and the balance that is essential to a satisfying life. The outdoors embodies something that cannot be found anywhere else. It is not merely the scenery, or the mountain breeze, or the open spaces that delight us. The outdoors embody history, primitive experiences, and elements capable of lifting the spirit.\n\n—CLAYNE JENSEN, Outdoor Recreation in America, 1985\n\nIt is important both to our economy and to the promotion of healthy lifestyles to encourage people, especially young people, to paddle a river, take a bike trip or a hike, cast a line in a lake, or connect in other ways with nature and the great outdoors.\n\n— SALLY JEWELL, US Secretary of the Interior (2013), 1956-\n\nWhat a joy it is to feel the soft, springy earth under my feet once more, to follow grassy roads that lead to ferny brooks where I can bathe my fingers in a cataract of rippling notes, or to clamber over a stone wall into green fields that tumble and roll and climb in riotous gladness!\n\n—HELEN KELLER, Deaf & Blind US Lecturer, 1880–1968\n\nSolitude is as needful to the imagination as society is wholesome for the character.\n\n—JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, US Poet, Essayist, Diplomat, 1819-91\n\nPeople are different on a path. On a town sidewalk strangers may make eye contact, but that’s all. On a path like this [Stowe, VT] they smile, say hello, and pet one another’s dogs. I think every community in American should have a greenway.\n\n—ANNE LUSK, Vermont Greenway Advocate, 1990\n\nLife for two weeks on the mountaintops would show up many things about life during the other fifty weeks down below.\n\n—BENTON MACKAYE, An Appalachian Trail: A Project in Regional Planning, The Journal of the American Institute of Architects, 1921\n\nHowever useful may be the National Parks and Forests of the West for those affording the Pullman fare to reach them, what is needed by the bulk of the American population is something nearer home.\n\n—BENTON MACKAYE, Progress Toward the Appalachian Trail, Appalachia, 1922\n\nWe know that trails are more than remote footpaths; they are also retreats found within heritage corridors and urban areas, which are accessible and critical to the mental and physical well-being of our citizens.\n\n—FRAN MAINELLA, Director, National Park Service, 2003\n\nTrails enabled me to better see the world.\n\n—ASPEN MATIS, Your Blue Is Not My Blue, 2020\n\nForests give a universal feeling of good will.\n\n—ENOS MILLS, US Naturalist, 1870-1922\n\nThe trail compels you to know yourself and to be yourself, and puts you in harmony with the universe. It makes you glad to be living. It gives health, hope, and courage, and it extends that touch of nature which tends to make you kind.\n\n—ENOS MILLS, US Naturalist, 1870-1922\n\nIt is impossible to fully appreciate the value of a trail until you have been forced to walk through the wilderness without one.\n\n—ROBERT MOOR, On Trails: An Exploration, 2016\n\nWithout trails, we would be lost.\n\n—ROBERT MOOR, On Trails: An Exploration, 2016\n\nIt is impossible to overestimate the value of wild mountains and mountain temples as places for people to grow in, recreation grounds for soul and body.\n\n—JOHN MUIR, US Naturalist, 1838–1914\n\nThe tendency nowadays to wander in wilderness is delightful to see. Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.\n\n—JOHN MUIR, Our National Parks, 1901\n\nTrails consistently remain the number one community amenity sought by prospective homeowners.\n\n— NATIONAL ASSOCIATION of HOMEBUILDERS, 2015\n\nGreenways and trails offer a new way of looking at how a community’s cultural, historic, recreational and conservation needs fit into an overall picture that also includes economic growth. With their emphasis on connections, greenways and trails allow community leaders to consider how existing parks and open spaces can become part of a network of green that supports wildlife, pleases people, and attracts tourists and clean industry.\n\n—OFFICE of GREENWAYS and TRAILS, FLORIDA DEPARTMENT of ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, Thinking Green: A Guide to the Benefits and Costs of Greenways and Trails, 1998\n\nIt is a scientific fact that the occasional contemplation of natural scenes of an impressive character…is favorable to the health and vigor of men and especially to the health and vigor of their intellect.\n\n—FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED, US Landscape Architect, 1822–1903\n\nAbove all, just get outside.\n\n—JULIE PLEVIN, The Healing Magic of Forest Bathing, 2019\n\nIn, summary, this study indicates that concerns about decreased property values, increased crime, and a lower quality of life due to the construction of multi-use trails are unfounded. In fact, the opposite is true. The study indicates that multi-use trails are an amenity that help sell homes, increase property values and improve the quality of life. Multi-use trails are tremendously popular and should continue to be built to meet the ever-growing demand for bicycle facilities in Seattle.\n\n—BRIAN PUNCOCHAR & PETER LAGERWAY, Evaluation of the Burke-Gilman Trail’s Effect on Property Values and Crime report, 1987\n\nThe biggest lesson I learned on the Camino [de Santiago] was that I need to slow down. It was the most difficult thing to learn.\n\n—JOYCE RUPP, Walk in a Relaxed Manner: Life Lessons from the Camino, 2005\n\nWhenever I step on the trail, I am hit with a giant wave of relief. This is my home.\n\n—JEFFREY H. RYAN, Appalachian Odyssey: A 28-Year Hike on America’s Trail, 2016\n\nIn a world dominated by hijackings, hostages, banana republic wars, atom bombs, and superpower posturings, we all yearn for something that makes sense to us as individuals. That something, for an increasing number of Americans, can be a hands-on involvement in a program that plants trees, builds trails, restores streams and streambanks, and creates a sense of ‘natural place’ in their communities.\n\n—NEIL SAMPSON, Editorial: National Action on Greenways, American Forests, Sept/Oct 1987\n\nIt is necessary now and then for a man to go away by himself and experience loneliness; to sit on a rock in the forest and ask of himself, “Who am I, and where have I been, and where am I going?”\n\n—CARL SANDBURG, US Poet, Writer, 1878-1967\n\nStudies show that trail development stimulates local economies, increases local tax revenue, attracts tourists seeking new recreational opportunities and revitalizes business districts. In addition, multi-use trails are considered critical amenities for home buyers. Corporations seek attractive communities that offer trails and open space when choosing where to locate new plants and offices.\n\n—GIL SCHAMESS, ISTEA & Trails: Enhancement Funding for Bicycling and Walking, 1995\n\nIn a world of constant change and flux where being in the moment seems increasingly harder to attain, there is also something about the notion of traveling along a pathway—under our own power—that reconnects us, and indeed binds together all humanity…\n\n—ROBERT SEARNS, founding owner of Urban Edges, Inc., a planning and development firm based in Denver, CO, 2001\n\nI also learned that walking is about more than getting from here to there; it is about being in a place, in a moment—about the joy of the journey.\n\n—ROBERT SEARNS, Beyond Greenways: The Next Step for City Trails and Walking Routes, 2023\n\nGo outside. Feel your feet on the earth, notice the sun, the clouds that make you grateful for it, and take a deep breath. It will change the world.\n\n—ELLEN SEVIGNY, Founder of Yoga in Your Park, 2016\n\nI felt a freedom to be in the wilderness that I know is not given to everyone.\n\n—BEN SHATTUCK, Six Walks: In the Footsteps of Henry David Thoreau, 2022\n\nI have a basic belief that outdoor recreation in a natural environment is good for people and is good for society at large. Anything that will bring more people to outdoor recreation, I therefore consider a ‘friend.’ Problems that derive from this philosophy are what keep me and others like me in business as recreation managers.\n\n—RICHARD SPRAY, USDA Forest Service employee, 1986\n\nContinually.… I think back on the pleasures that I’ve had on the trail and the teachings that it has imparted to me, and how those pleasures and those teachings have given me happiness and a greater understanding of how to bring fullness and richness into my life.\n\n—ANN and MYRON SUTTON, The Appalachian Trail: Wilderness on the Doorstep, 1967\n\nI am alarmed when it happens that I have walked a mile into the woods bodily, without getting there in spirit.\n\n—HENRY DAVID THOREAU, US Writer, Naturalist, 1817–62\n\nThe modern world is fast, complex, competitive, and always concerned with what happens next. There is always more to do than there is time. The landscape and even the light are mostly artificial. This can be exciting, but all too often it is frustrating, stressful, and exhausting. In contrast, hiking for weeks or months at a time in an unspoiled natural environment is a simple, repetitive activity that leads to calmness and psychological well-being, a feeling of wholeness, of being a complete person. Each day follows the same pattern, linking in with natural rhythms—walk in the light, sleep in the dark, eat when hungry, take shelter from storms. Only the details are different. I get a great pleasure from this simplicity, from the basic pattern of walk and camp, walk and camp. It is good to escape the rush of the modern world and for a period of time to live a quieter, more basic life. Problems and worries subside as the days go by; they are put into perspective by the elemental activity of putting one foot in front of the other hour after hour, day after day. And on returning from the wilds, restored and revitalized by the experience, I find civilization can be much easier to deal with; indeed, aspects of it can seem very desirable.\n\n—CHRIS TOWNSEND, The Advanced Backpacker, 2001\n\nHikers, hunters, birdwatchers, technical rock climbers, anglers, skiers, canoeists—all these and many more turn to the outdoors to find challenge, not ease; uncertainty, not security….\n\n—LAURA and GUY WATERMAN, Wilderness Ethics, 1993\n\nBenefits\n\nBack to top of page\n\nBicycling Quotes\n\nFew articles ever used by man have created so great a revolution in social conditions as the bicycle.\n\n—1900 United States Census Report\n\nLet our people travel light and free on their bikes—nothing on the back but a shirt, nothing tied to the bike but a slicker in case of rain.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness, 1968\n\nDoctor Sarvis, laboring on his bicycle up the long grade of Ninth South toward his home on 23rd East, was not unaware of the pressure of the traffic accumulating in his rear, the clamor of horns pounded by impatient fists, the motorized hatred fermenting at his back. But he thought, ‘Fuck ’em.’ Let ’em wait. Let ’em fester. Let ’em walk. Let ’em ride a bike like me, would do me and them and everybody a world of good. Cleanse our city’s air, reinvigorate the blood, tone up the muscles, strengthen the heart, burn up that surplus fat, stave off arteriosclerosis, cut down on bypass operations, eliminate transplants, lower the cholesterol count, prolong lives.\n\n—EDWARD ABBEY, Hayduke Lives! 1989\n\nBicycle facility planning is commonly thought of as the effort undertaken to develop a separate bikeway system composed completely of bicycle paths and lanes all interconnected and spaced closely enough to satisfy all the travel needs of bicyclists. In fact, such systems can be unnecessarily expensive and do not provide for the vast majority of bicycle travel. Existing highways, often with relatively inexpensive improvements, must serve as the base system to provide for the travel needs of bicyclists. Bicycle paths and lanes can augment this existing system in scenic corridors or places where access is limited. Thus, bicycle transportation planning is more than planning for bikeways and is an effort that should consider many alternatives to provide for safe and efficient bicycle travel.\n\n—AASHTO, Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities, 1991\n\nWhen I go biking, I repeat a mantra of the day’s sensations: bright sun, blue sky, warm breeze, blue jay’s call, ice melting and so on. This helps me transcend the traffic, ignore the clamoring of work, leave all the mind theaters behind and focus on nature instead. I still must abide by the rules of the road, of biking, of gravity. But I am mentally far away from civilization. The world is breaking someone else’s heart.\n\n—DIANE ACKERMAN, US Author, 1948-\n\nLet me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a bike. It gives her a feeling of self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat [a women] knows she can’t get into harm while she us on her bicycle and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.\n\n—SUSAN B. ANTHONY, US Crusader for Women’s Suffrage, 1820–1906\n\nIt’s something I find enjoyable. Whether it is a road bike or mountain bike or tandem bike. I enjoy riding a bike.\n\n—LANCE ARMSTRONG, 7 Time Tour de France Winner, 2012 banned for life and stripped of titles for doping, 1971-\n\nI’ve said it before and I will repeat it: I believe that I am the most tested athlete on this planet. I have never had a single positive doping test, and I do not take performance-enhancing drugs (2004).\n\n—LANCE ARMSTRONG, 7 time Tour de France winner, 2012 banned for life and stripped of titles for doping, 1971-\n\nRide like you just stole something (said to teammate Floyd Landis in the 2004 Tour de France).\n\n—LANCE ARMSTRONG, 7 time Tour de France winner, 2012 banned for life and stripped of titles for doping, 1971-\n\nYou can have all the heart in the world, but it doesn’t mean anything unless you’ve got the legs.\n\n—LANCE ARMSTRONG, 7 Time Tour de France Winner, 2012 banned for life and stripped of titles for doping, 1971-\n\nIf you worried about falling off the bike, you’d never get on.\n\n—LANCE ARMSTRONG, Every Second Counts, 2003\n\nI’ll die when I’m done living, but until then I intend to ride my bike—and I’ll probably keel over on it.\n\n—LANCE ARMSTRONG, It’s Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, 2001\n\nWhy does any kid love a bike? It’s liberation and independence, your first set of wheels.\n\n—LANCE ARMSTRONG, It’s Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, 2001\n\nJust as the ideal of classic Greek culture was the most perfect harmony of mind and body, so a human and a bicycle are the perfect synthesis of body and machine.\n\n—RICHARD BALLANTINE, Richard’s 21st Century Bicycle Book, 2001\n\nPossibly the tragedy of the bicycle is that it was invented too close in time to the car. In the historical scheme, pedal power hardly got under way before the combustion engine appeared and, not only took over the roads, but changed our view of machines. We’ve forgotten that pedal power is a potent form of energy.\n\n—RICHARD BALLANTINE, Richard’s 21st Century Bicycle Book, 2001\n\nThe bicycle is its own best argument. You just get a bike, try it; start going with the thing and\n\nusing it as it suits you. It’ll grow and it gets better and better and better.\n\n—RICHARD BALLANTINE, Richard’s 21st Century Bicycle Book, 2001\n\nA bicycle ride is a flight from sadness.\n\n—DANIEL BEHRMAN, The Man Who Loved Bicycles; the Memoirs of an Autophobe, 1973\n\nExploration comes easy on a bicycle, the unknown is everywhere.\n\n—DANIEL BEHRMAN, The Man Who Loved Bicycles; The Memoirs of an Autophobe, 1973\n\nI eat to ride, I ride to eat. At the best of moments, I can achieve a perfect balance, consuming just the right amount of calories as I fill up at bakeries, restaurants, or ice cream parlors. On the road, I can get about twelve miles to the quart of milk and a piece of baker’s apple tart.\n\n—DANIEL BEHRMAN, The Man Who Loved Bicycles; The Memoirs of an Autophobe, 1973\n\nI suppose that was what attracted me to the bicycle right from the start. It is not so much a way of getting somewhere as it is a setting for randomness; it makes every journey an unorganized tour.\n\n—DANIEL BEHRMAN, The Man Who Loved Bicycles; the Memoirs of an Autophobe, 1973\n\nThe bicycle is a vehicle of revolution. It can destroy the tyranny of the automobile as effectively as the printing press brought down despots of flesh and blood. The revolution will be spontaneous, the sum total of individual revolts like my own. It may have already begun.\n\n—DANIEL BEHRMAN, The Man Who Loved Bicycles; The Memoirs of an Autophobe, 1973\n\nThe world lies right beyond the handlebars of any bicycle that I happen to be on anywhere from New York Bay to the Vallee de Chevreuse. Anywhere is high adventure, the walls come down, the cyclist is a loner, it is the only way for him to meet other loners. And it works. One seldom exchanges anything but curses or names of insurance companies with another driver, the car inhibits human contacts. The bicycle generates them; bikes talk to each other like dogs, they wag their wheels and tinkle their bells, the riders let their mounts mingle.\n\n—DANIEL BEHRMAN,The Man Who Loved Bicycles; the Memoirs of an Autophobe, 1973\n\nYou never have the wind with you—either it is against you or you’re having a good day.\n\n—DANIEL BEHRMAN, The Man Who Loved Bicycles; the Memoirs of an Autophobe, 1973\n\nWhoever invented the bicycle deserves the thanks of humanity.\n\n—LORD CHARLES BERESFORD, British Admiral, 1846-1919\n\nBicycling has the potential to be a great equalizer. It requires only minor infrastructure investments and social shifts to be a powerful tool for us to redraw the lines in our society that determine far more than how we reach our destinations.\n\n—ELLY BLUE, Bikenomics: How Bicycling Can Save The Economy, 2013\n\nThe humble bicycle, long a scapegoat, may yet prove our salvation from a transportation system running at a deficit.\n\n—ELLY BLUE, Bikenomics: How Bicycling Can Save The Economy, 2013\n\nEvery rider crashes.\n\n—EDWARD “EDDIE B” BORYSEWICZ, former US Olympic Cycling Coach, 1939-2020\n\nBicycles are small, inexpensive, require little maintenance, pleasurable to use, and smogless.\n\n—STEWART BRAND, editor, Whole Earth Catalog, 1970\n\nIf America traded in all their [cars] for bikes, a lot of problems would be solved.\n\n—STEWART BRAND, editor, Whole Earth Catalog, 1970\n\nThe advantages? Exercise, no parking problems, gas prices, it’s fun. An automobile is expensive. You have to find a place to park and it’s not fun. So why not ride a bicycle? I recommend it. (when asked why he rides a bike)\n\n—STEPHEN G.

It is the most beautiful of machines, as aesthetically pleasing as it is functional.\n\n—ANNA BRONES, Hello, Bicycle: An Inspired Guide To The Two-Wheeled Life, 2016\n\nIt’s difficult to ride a bicycle without smiling. Bicycling feels good, and in our hectic, fast-paced modern lives, we need this.\n\n—ANNA BRONES, Hello, Bicycle: An Inspired Guide To The Two-Wheeled Life, 2016\n\nTwo wheels. A bicycle isn’t much more complicated than that.\n\n—ANNA BRONES, Hello, Bicycle: An Inspired Guide To The Two-Wheeled Life, 2016\n\nIn short, cycling is environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable.\n\n—RALPH BUEHLER and JOHN PUCHER, editors, Cycling for Sustainable Cities, 2021\n\nIf you really want to experience the world, get on a bicycle.\n\nJULIANA BUHRING, This Road I Ride: Sometimes It Takes Losing Everything to Find Yourself, 2016\n\nOn a bike you go at nature-speed.\n\n—DAN BURDEN, US Walkability and Bikeability Advocate, 1944-\n\nWith the bike, and later my feet, I began to explore everything rural, everything urban, to appreciate what made each unique and distinct.\n\n—DAN BURDEN, US Walkability and Bikeability Advocate, 1944-\n\nThe more I think about our US domestic transportation problem from this vantage point [China] the more I see an increased role for the bicycle in American life. I am convinced after riding bikes an enormous amount here in China, that it is a sensible, economical, clean form of transportation and makes enormous good sense.\n\n—GEORGE H.W. BUSH, US Liaison Office, Beijing, China, 1975\n\nBike racing is art. Art is driven by passion, by emotions, by unknown thoughts…. It’s the same for every athlete. And that’s why we do this.\n\n—CHRIS CARMICHAEL, Former US Olympic Cyclist, current Cycling Coach, 1961-\n\nWomen are attracted to cycling because they can compete with men. What women lack in muscle mass can be compensated for by savvy, willpower, and endurance. The bike is the great equalizer because the strongest are not always the best.\n\n—CONNIE CARPENTER-PHINNEY, US 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist, 1957-\n\nWithout question, bicycling is an efficient, economical and environmentally sound form of transportation and recreation. Bicycling is a great activity for families, recreational riders and commuters. Hillary, Chelsea and I have bicycles….\n\n—BILL CLINTON, Forty-second US President (1993-2001) in Bicycling magazine, 1992\n\nYou must do three things: Ride your bike, ride your bike, ride your bike.\n\n—FAUSTO COPPI, Italian Racing Cyclist, 1919-60\n\nOne of the things that I wound up loving about being involved with a bike racer was learning how to bike and how that really creates solitary time for you to reflect on things and nobody can get a hold of you. (talking about her [ex]-life with Lance Armstrong, July 13th 2005)\n\n—SHERYL CROW, US Singer, 1962-\n\nIf you steal bikes, for God’s sake, stop it. If you steal a bike from someone who loves it and depends on it, you are doing one of the lowest things that one human being can do to another. Steal something else if you have to steal.\n\n—TOM CUTHBERTSON, Anybody’s Bike Book: An Original Manual of Bicycle Repairs, 1971\n\nExpand your consciousness a little, and turn on to good old Mother Nature, before she starts turning on us.\n\n—TOM CUTHBERTSON, Bike Tripping, 1972\n\nWhile on the road, always remember that wise [bicycle] riding maxim, tend to your needs before they are imminent. Eat before you are hungry, drink before you’re thirsty, shift down before you get to a hill, check the brakes before a downhill grade, and go to the john before you’re uncomfortable.\n\n—TOM CUTHBERTSON, Bike Tripping, 1972\n\nThe truly extraordinary feature of the bike is that, like the very greatest teacher, it encourages you to find the answers from somewhere deep down inside yourself and not merely take them from someone else. When I began my adventure into myself on my bike I did not need to be told that I had to eat more of the right kind of food. I just knew I had to do it or else my legs would not work. I had never listened to or cared about those long terrifying lectures about the evils of smoking—complete with coloured slides of blackened lungs—but I did know, after some time in the saddle, that I just had to give up cigarettes. I did not need the expensive psychiatrist to tell me why I was depressed since, after a brisk ride, I was depressed no more.\n\n—TOM DAVIES, Merlyn the Magician and the Pacific Coast Highway, 1982\n\nCycling is the sport of usefulness.\n\n—FRED DELONG, DeLong’s Guide to Bicycles and Bicycling, 1978\n\n…I still feel that variable gears are only for people over 45. Isn’t it better to triumph by the strength of your muscles than by the artifice of a derailleur? We are getting soft. Come on fellows.\n\n—HENRI DESGRANGE, organizer of the first (1903) Tour de France,1865-1940\n\nEverything’s possible when you’re seeing the world from a bike seat—even changing your life.\n\n—DOUG DONALDSON, Bicycling Magazine’s Guide to Bike Touring, 2005\n\nRolling outside on a bike knocks you out of your routine and can even alter the way you see the world.\n\n—DOUG DONALDSON, Bicycling Magazine’s Guide to Bike Touring, 2005\n\nA good cyclist does not need a high road.\n\n—SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, Scottish Writer, Creator of Sherlock Holmes, 1859-1930\n\nWhen the spirits are low, when the day appears dark, when work becomes monotonous, when hope hardly seems worth having, just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road, without thought on anything but the ride you are taking.\n\n—SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, Creator of Sherlock Holmes, in Scientific American, January 18, 1896\n\nA woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle. [coined in 1970]\n\n—IRINA DUNN, Australian Writer, Social Activist, 1945-\n\nBike touring is dependent on awareness, common sense, rationality, luck, and－most important－trust.\n\n—SARA DYKMAN, Bicycling with Butterflies, 2021\n\nThe bike was ugly. To me, however, it was a reliable machine, a deterrent to theft, a statement against consumerism, and my ticket to adventure. I liked the look.\n\n—SARA DYKMAN, Bicycling with Butterflies, 2021\n\nThe world might not have been built for bike touring, but I liked transforming it into one that was.\n\n—SARA DYKMAN, Bicycling with Butterflies, 2021\n\nI thought of that [the theory of relativity] while riding my bicycle.\n\n—ALBERT EINSTEIN, US (German-born) Physicist, 1879–1955\n\nLife is like riding a bicycle—in order to keep your balance, you must keep moving.\n\n—ALBERT EINSTEIN, US (German-born) Physicist, 1879–1955\n\nA bicycle does get you there and more….And there is always the thin edge of danger to keep you alert and comfortably apprehensive. Dogs become dogs again and snap at your raincoat; potholes become personal. And getting there is all the fun.\n\n—BILL EMERSON, On Bicycling, Saturday Evening Post, 29 July 1967\n\nConsider the problems a bicycle solves: health, economy, environment. Peace of mind.\n\n—DARYL FARMER, Bicycling beyond the Divide: Two Journeys into the West, 2008\n\nPart of the joy of bicycle touring was not having to plan ahead, to just sleep where the daylight ended.\n\n—DARYL FARMER, Bicycling beyond the Divide: Two Journeys into the West, 2008\n\nFor city bicycling to catch on we need a revolution in our society’s infrastructure. Right now a city rider needs to be a road warrior, and the bike needs to be cheap and ugly so it won’t get stolen. That’s not a bike friendly culture.\n\n—GARY FISHER, Founder and CEO of Fisher Bicycles, one of the inventors of the mountain bike, 1950-\n\nAmerica needs to embrace the culture of cycling and bicycle tourism. It benefits all of American society, producing healthier people, more economic opportunity, and fewer impacts to air, water, and land.\n\n—CHARLES A. “CHUCK” FLINK, The Greenway Imperative: Connecting Communities and Landscapes for a Sustainable Future, 2020\n\nIn many parts of America there is hostility toward bicyclists, and much of it is unwarranted.\n\n—CHARLES A. “CHUCK” FLINK, The Greenway Imperative: Connecting Communities and Landscapes for a Sustainable Future, 2020\n\nThe United States is an automobile-oriented culture and society, and some in our nation see a cyclist riding in the road as an opportunity to inflict pain and bodily injury.\n\n—CHARLES A. “CHUCK” FLINK, The Greenway Imperative: Connecting Communities and Landscapes for a Sustainable Future, 2020\n\nWhen you travel by bicycle over such a long distance, and across varied landscapes, you are much better connected by the experience of place than if you performed that same trip by car, bus, or train.\n\n—CHARLES A. “CHUCK” FLINK, The Greenway Imperative: Connecting Communities and Landscapes for a Sustainable Future, 2020\n\nCyclists fare best when they act and are treated as drivers of vehicles.\n\n—JOHN FORESTER, Effective Cycling, 1976\n\nPeople like to travel: that is why the grass is greener over the fence. We are walkers—our natural means of travel is to put one foot in front of the other. The bicycle seduces our basic nature by making walking exciting. It lets us take 10-foot strides at 160 paces a minute. That’s 20 miles an hour, instead of 4 or 5… It is not only how fast you go—cars are faster and jet planes faster still. But jet-plane travel is frustrating boredom—at least the car gives the pictorial illusion of travel. Cycling does it all—you have the complete satisfaction of arriving because your mind has chosen the path and steered you over it; your eyes have seen it; your muscles have felt it; your breathing, circulatory and digestive systems have all done their natural functions better than ever, and every part of your being knows you have traveled and arrived.\n\n—JOHN FORESTER, Effective Cycling, 1976\n\nThe bicycle … has been responsible for more movement in manners and morals than anything since Charles the Second. Under its influence, wholly or in part, have wilted chaperones, long and narrow skirts, tight corsets, hair that would come down, black stockings, thick ankles, large hats, prudery, and fear of the dark; under its influence, have blossomed weekends, strong nerves, strong legs, strong language, knickers, knowledge of make and shape, knowledge of woods and pastures, equality of sex, good digestion, and professional occupation—in four words, the emancipation of women.\n\n—JOHN GALSWORTHY, English Novelist, Playwright, 1867-1933\n\nThe journey of life is like a man riding a bicycle. We know he got on the bicycle and started to move. We know that at some point he will stop and get off. We know that if he stops moving and does not get off he will fall off.\n\n—WILLIAM GOLDING, English Novelist, 1911-93\n\nThe bicycle’s influence is visible throughout American culture: in our roads, cars, and planes; our embrace of mass production and consumption; the clothes women wear and the autonomy they have; even our collective understanding of war.\n\n—MARGARET GUROFF. The Mechanical Horse: How the Bicycle Reshaped American Life, 2016\n\nEven though bicycling was good for the environment, good for the city, good for personal health, quiet fun, rewarding, inexpensive, a great social experience, a fine family outing, and an outstanding way to get to work, there was almost no place to do it.\n\n—PETER HARNIK, From Rails to Trails: The Making of America’s Active Transportation Network, 2021\n\nThe only regret I have in my life is never learning to ride a bicycle.\n\n—HELEN HAYES, US Actress, 1900-93\n\nYou’re going to ride a bicycle where?\n\n—GAIL HEILMAN, The Complete Outfitting & Source Book for Bicycle Touring, 1980\n\nIt is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up them and coast down them. Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motor car only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.\n\n—ERNEST HEMINGWAY, US Writer, 1899–1961\n\nThe bicycle riders drank much wine, and were burned and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except among themselves.\n\n—ERNEST HEMINGWAY, The Sun Also Rises, 1926\n\nI have started many stories about bicycle racing but have never written one that is as good as it is both on the indoor and outdoor tracks and on the roads.\n\n—ERNEST HEMINGWAY, A Moveable Feast, 1964\n\nCycling is my life. I can still win. I am still one of the best. And I’m clean.\n\n—GEORGE HINCAPIE and CRAIG HUMMER, The Loyal Lieutenant: My Story, 2014\n\nMy religion was cycling improvement and success.\n\n—GEORGE HINCAPIE and CRAIG HUMMER, The Loyal Lieutenant: My Story, 2014\n\nThe way I looked at it, boiled down to its essence, cycling could be simplified to an equation of who could train the longest and hardest, and once in a race, who could best withstand the intensity of the pain.\n\n—GEORGE HINCAPIE and CRAIG HUMMER, The Loyal Lieutenant: My Story, 2014\n\nThe bicycle is a curious vehicle. Its passenger is its engine.\n\n—JOHN HOWARD, The Cyclist’s Companion, 1984\n\nBicycles let people move with greater speed without taking up significant amounts of scarce space, energy, or time.\n\n—IVAN ILLICH, Energy and Equity, 1974\n\nMan on a bicycle can go three to four times faster than the pedestrian, but uses five times less energy in the process. Equipped with this tool, man outstrips the efficiency of not only all machines but all other animals as well… The bicycle lifted man’s auto-mobility into a new order, beyond which progress is theoretically not possible…the use of the bicycle allows people to create a new relationship between their life-space and their lifetime, between their territory and the pulse of their being, without destroying their inherited balance.\n\n—IVAN ILLICH, Energy and Equity, 1974\n\nParticipatory democracy demands low-energy technology, and free people must travel the road to productive social relations at the speed of a bicycle.\n\n—IVAN ILLICH, Energy and Equity, 1974\n\nThe bicycle is the perfect transducer to match man’s metabolic energy to the impedance of locomotion. Equipped with this tool, man outstrips the efficiency of not only all machines but all other animals as well.\n\n—IVAN ILLICH, Energy and Equity, 1974\n\nThe bicycle had, and still has, a humane, almost classical moderation in the kind of pleasure it offers. It is the kind of machine that a Hellenistic Greek might have invented and ridden. It does no violence to our normal reactions: It does not pretend to free us from our normal environment.\n\n—J.B. JACKSON, US Writer, 1909-96\n\n…I was happy in the sunshine and happy to be on the bike and the long straight road.\n\n—JEDIDIAH JENKINS, To Shake the Sleeping Self, 2018\n\nRiding a bicycle gives the land a realistic scale. You notice every seam and crease.\n\n—JEDIDIAH JENKINS, To Shake the Sleeping Self, 2018\n\nWere we cyclists, adventurers, or just fragile tourists?\n\n—JEDIDIAH JENKINS, To Shake the Sleeping Self, 2018\n\nWho can be sad on a bike?\n\n—JEDIDIAH JENKINS, To Shake the Sleeping Self, 2018\n\nNext to a leisurely walk I enjoy a spin on my tandem bicycle. It is splendid to feel the wind blowing in my face and the springy motion of my iron steed. The rapid rush through the air gives me a delicious sense of strength and buoyancy, and the exercise makes my pulse dance and my heart sing.\n\n—HELEN KELLER, Deaf & Blind US Lecturer, 1880–1968\n\nToleration is the greatest gift of the mind; it requires the same effort of the brain that it takes to balance oneself on a bicycle.\n\n—HELEN KELLER, Deaf & Blind US Lecturer, 1880–1968\n\nNothing compares with the simple pleasure of a bike ride.\n\n—JOHN F. KENNEDY, Thirty-fifth US President (1961–63), 1917–63\n\nAs a means of pleasure, cycling stands in the foremost rank, but in common with all the great pleasures, it may easily stand in the foremost in abuse. The desire to ride at an unreasonably high speed may become morbid…The ever lasting scorcher, bent like a hoop, and with sunken cheeks, ought to be quite sufficient warning against this abuse.\n\n—L.F. KORNS, How to Bicycle, 1892\n\nCyclers see considerable more of this beautiful world than any other class of citizens. A good bicycle, well applied, will cure most ills this flesh is heir to. (K.K. Doty of New York)\n\n— L.F. KORNS, How to Bicycle, 1892\n\nCycling fills the remotest cells of the lungs with outdoor air. The pores are opened and the dead secretions are thrown off. It aids the peristaltic movement of the bowels…\n\n—L.F. KORNS, How to Bicycle, 1892\n\nI expect to see the day when not to ride a wheel will be a mark of a defective education, and people will say to such a person, ‘Why, where have you been brought up?’ (Rev. W.J. Petrie of Chicago)\n\n—L.F. KORNS, How to Bicycle, 1892\n\nI fear that the universal adoption of cycling would be bad for the doctors. (J.A. Chase, a doctor from Pawtucket)\n\n— L.F. KORNS, How to Bicycle, 1892\n\nIf were not a man, I would like to be a bird. As I am a man, I do the next best thing, and ride a bicycle. (Rev Maltie of Baltimore)\n\n—L.F. KORNS, How to Bicycle, 1892\n\nAll creatures who have ever walked have wished that they might fly. With highwheelers a flesh and blood man can hitch wings to his feet.\n\n—KARL KRON, Ten Thousand Miles on a Bicycle, 1887\n\nWith the heaps of overly specialized gear—gloves, shoes, and biking jerseys—most cyclists realize that every day on the road is Halloween. Plain and simple, it’s wearing a costume each time out of the gate.…We’re neon signs, stylistically impaired wonders blinding pedestrians and fooling small children into thinking that the circus has come back to town.\n\n—JOE KURMASKIE, Metal Cowboy: Ten Years Further Down the Road Less Pedaled, 2010\n\nHe walked in a nonchalant fashion, and his bicycle went with him as if it were a live thing.\n\n—D.H. LAWRENCE, Sons and Lovers, 1913\n\nAs a kid I had a dream—I wanted to own my own bicycle. When I got the bike I must have been the happiest boy in Liverpool, maybe the world. I lived for that bike. Most kids left their bikes in the backyard at\n\nnight. Not me. I insisted on taking mine indoors and the first night I even kept it by my bed. Funny, although it was important to me then, I can’t remember what finally happened to it.\n\n—JOHN LENNON, English Singer, Songwriter, 1940-80\n\nEver bike? Now that’s something that makes life worth living! …Oh, to just grip your handlebars and lay down to it, and go ripping and tearing through streets and road, over railroad tracks and bridges, threading crowds…and wondering all the time when you’re going to smash up. Well, now, that’s something!\n\n—JACK LONDON, US Novelist, 1876-1916\n\nBicycles and their three- and four-wheeled derivatives can enhance people’s mobility at little cost, improve access to vital services, and create a wide range of employment opportunities.\n\n—MARCIA D. LOWE, The Bicycle: Vehicle for a Small Planet, Worldwatch Paper 90, 1989\n\nAble to move at distinctive speeds, a cyclists can lengthen a sense of place in both distance and time, allowing sensory perception to linger in thought or memory and providing opportunities to revisit places imaginatively from a distance.\n\n—ROBERT L. MCCULLOUGH, Old Wheelways: Traces of Bicycle History on the Land, 2015\n\nFor roughly two decades, from 1880 to 1900, bicycles and bicyclists shaped and reshaped American social, cultural, economic, and industrial history; introduced an independent and dependable means of overland travel; propelled a campaign to improve the nation’s pitiful network of roads; influenced the appearance of cities in subtle ways; swayed park planners; and set into motion the modern machine and engineering technology essential to the development of automobiles and airplanes.\n\n—ROBERT L. MCCULLOUGH, Old Wheelways: Traces of Bicycle History on the Land, 2015\n\nPeople who ride bicycles are different.\n\n—SEAMUS MCGONAGLE, The Bicycle in Life, Love, War, and Literature, 1968\n\nRide. Ride as much or as little, or as long or as short as you feel. But ride.\n\n—EDDY ‘the Cannibal’ MERCKX, "
