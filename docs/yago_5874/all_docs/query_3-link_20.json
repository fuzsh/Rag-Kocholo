        "text": "Richard William Means, at 75\n\nIt is with great sadness we announce the passing of our brother, Richard William Means, 75, of Houston, Texas, formerly of Hull and Durham, N.H. He succumbed to a short battle with lung cancer on July 26, 2024 and was surrounded by his loving family as he transitioned to his eternal place of peace and happiness in Heaven.\n\n“Dick” as he was fondly called by his family and friends, grew up in Hull. Being the oldest of 7, Mr. Means was always ready to give big brotherly advice to his younger siblings, even if they didn’t want to hear it. He attended St. Joseph’s Middle School in Quincy, followed by Archbishop Williams High School in Braintree. He excelled in academics and enjoyed success and camaraderie; running track and playing on the varsity tennis team.\n\nAfter graduation, Mr. Means went onto Suffolk University, earning his degree in business and marketing. He enjoyed being a student of academia and furthered his education, earning a master’s degree in business management at Northeastern University.\n\nAs Mr. Means soared through the ranks in business, he achieved a position as regional sales manager in aeronautic engineering at National Semiconductor of New England. It was during this time that Mr. Means met and married his former wife, Mary (Healy) Means of Scituate. They bought their first home behind his childhood home, on Harold Place in Hull, after which they moved to Durham, N.H., where he and Mary raised their daughter Lauren and son Ryan.\n\nIn 2004, Mr. Means moved to Houston, where he surged into the oil and gas business. It was during this time Mr. Means met his current wife, Annette Means, and they married in 2015. Mr. Means enjoyed his extended family with Annette, her two sons, daughter, and many grandchildren. His favorite times were enjoying family, being a member of the Knights of Columbus, and volunteering his time for people in need. He was a staunch Catholic and had deep faith in his life, his family, and the world around him. Mr. Means enjoyed sharing cigars with family and friends and was often heard saying his two favorite expressions over the years, “I’m a man about town!” and “Manischewitz!”\n\nWaiting to receive our brother Dick in Heaven are his parents, former Hull Fire Chief, Kervyn (Jeff) Means and Mary W. Means, his beloved son, Ryan Means, his brother Bobby (Numbas) Means, and his sister Virginia (Yinny) Winnett. Mr. Means is survived by his daughter Lauren Means (Jason), granddaughter Haley Donnell, sister Mary Means (Patti), brother William “Billy” Means (Renee), sister Carol Morris, brother Christopher Means, and brother-in-law, Jim Winnett. Mr. Means also leaves behind his nieces and nephews: Carolyn, Emily, and Abby Winnett, Catherine Morris and Derek Means (Mason). Mr. Means is survived by his wife, Annette Means, her two sons and daughter David, Christopher, Jessica Polnick; grandchildren David III, Benjamin, Kamryn, Kinsley Polnick, and Aiden Dricker, Gracie and Jackson Jones. Until we meet again brother, your memory will be burned brightly in the hearts and lives of your family and friends."
