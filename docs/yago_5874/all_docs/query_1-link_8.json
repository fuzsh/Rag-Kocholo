        "text": "biography\n\nBorn Aldo DaRe in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, on September 25, 1926, movie heavy Aldo Ray was born into a large Italian family and grew up in northern California. He entered the Navy in 1944 at age 18 and served as a frogman during World War II. After his discharge, Ray briefly studied political science at the University of California. In 1950, Ray was working as a peace officer in Crockett, California, when he was discovered for films by a Columbia talent scout. By chance Ray landed a role in the Columbia drama Saturday's Hero (1951; with John Derek), and his performance was good enough for Columbia to sign him to a contract.\n\nLEFT and CENTER: Photos of Aldo Ray, circa 1950s. RIGHT: Ray with his second wife, actress Jeff Donnell, in 1954\n\nHis husky voice and tough demeanor made him a natural in such war films as Battle Cry (1955; with Tab Hunter and Dorothy Malone). He also gave good performances in several comedies, including Let's Do It Again (1953; with Jane Wyman and Ray Milland) and We're No Angels (1955; with Humphrey Bogart and Joan Bennett).\n\nAfter a brief first marriage in 1947 that produced a daughter, Ray married actress and fellow Columbia contract player Jeff Donnell in 1954, but they parted ways two years later. Ray wed his third wife in 1960 and, after welcoming two sons, got divorced again in 1967. Emotionally and financially battered by three failed marriages and child support, Ray remained single for the rest of his life.\n\nthe films of aldo ray\n\nPat and Mike (1952)\n\nWith Katharine Hepburn in the MGM comedy Pat and Mike, one of the best films of Ray's career\n\nThe Marrying Kind (1952)\n\nFrom Columbia's bittersweet comedy The Marrying Kind with Judy Holliday\n\nMiss Sadie Thompson (1953)\n\nFrom Columbia's Miss Sadie Thompson with Rita Hayworth\n\nLet's Do It Again (1953)\n\nWith Jane Wyman in the Columbia musical comedy Let's Do It Again\n\nBattle Cry (1955)\n\nRay romances window Nancy Olson in the Warner Bros. World War II drama Battle Cry\n\nThree Stripes in the Sun (1955)\n\nWith Chuck Connors and Dick York in the war-themed romance Three Stripes in the Sun\n\nNightfall (1957)\n\nColumbia released the film noir thriller Nightfall.

Never earning much money and struggling with alcoholism, Ray was often financially strapped and had to make ends meet by appearing in low-budget films. Even during his seven-year contract with Columbia, Ray never earned more than $600 per week. By the 1980s, however, he began to turn his life and career around. Some of his films from the 1980s include Bog (1983; with Marshall Thompson), Vultures (1983; with Yvonne De Carlo), Evils of the Night (1985; with Tina Louise and Julie Newmar), and Terror Night (1987; with John Ireland and Cameron Mitchell). In late 1989, Ray was diagnosed with throat cancer and passed away on March 27, 1991, just two months after the release of his final film, Shock 'Em Dead (1991; with Troy Donahue and Traci Lords). He was 64 years old. Ray was survived by two sons, a daughter, and a grandchild."
