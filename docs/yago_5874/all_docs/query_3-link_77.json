        "text": "Keith Jerome Adams, born Nov. 1, 1963, in Lilbourn, passed away Tuesday, July 30, 2024, at his home in Cape Girardeau, surrounded by his wife, son and family, after a battle with pancreatic cancer.\n\nKeith grew up in a large, loving family and enjoyed the camaraderie and fun that came with having many siblings. Memories of the family growing up in the North Lilbourn projects were often reminisced and retold in his later years. As a young boy, he enjoyed being a member of Little Beginners, singing at Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church. It was there at the age 12, along with his brother, Donnell, that Keith accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior.\n\nKeith graduated from New Madrid County Central High School in 1982, where he played basketball and was class president his senior year. He went on to attend Southeast Missouri State University, earning a bachelor of science degree. During his college years, Keith served as an athletic trainer and met the love of his life, Gretchen Kean. They married July 24, 1993, and, after their wedding, the happy couple was blessed with the arrival of a precious baby boy, Kieran. Keith took great pride in his sons academic achievements, especially when he earned his masters degree.\n\nKeith worked for FedEx for 18 years before discovering his true calling as a teacher. From then on he dedicated himself to educating fifth- and sixth-grade students at Cape Girardeau Middle School, where his passion and innovative methods made a significant impact on many young lives. \"Mr. Adams\" was a staple of the school community and will be deeply missed by his students and faculty peers.\n\nIn addition to his civilian career, Keith served with distinction in the Army National Guard for 21 years, achieving the rank of captain. His commitment to serving his country was evident in his many years of dedicated service.\n\nOutside of work, Keith was a grill master who loved to have a good time bringing together everyone he loved while he cooked, grilled and then shared those meals with family and friends. He had a passion for gardening and canning, following in his mothers footsteps. Keith really enjoyed fishing with his brothers, neighbor and friends or spending quality time with his wife and son. Keiths life was marked by his love for family and friends, dedication to service and passion for teaching.\n\nKeith leaves his devoted wife of 31 years, Gretchen Lynn Kean Adams; son, Kieran James Adams of Cape Girardeau; three loving sisters, Clara Hill, Bettie Hobbs and Phyllis Adams of Chicago; five brothers, Sam (Josella) Adams of Cape Girardeau, Eugene (Janice) Adams of Chicago, Russell (Patricia) Adams of Milwaukee, John Adams Sr. of Stone Mountain, Georgia, and Donnell Adams of Keanu, Hawaii; his mother-in-law, Katherine Kean of Epworth, Iowa; and sisters-in-law, Johnna Norpel of Richfield, Minnesota, Roxanne (Jeff) Simon of Farley, Iowa, Rose (Alan) McQuillen of Peosta, Iowa, Cindy (Phil) Cook of Dubuque, Iowa, and Denise Freeman of Cascade, Iowa. He will also be remembered by a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, family and friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Hollie and Mary Alice Adams; sister, Rosie Lee Adams; brother, James Adams; father-in-law, James Kean; brothers-in-law, Daniel Freeman, Dennis Kean and Aaron Kean; and sister-in-law, Sherry Messer.\n\nImmortality is achieved when your life is worth remembering. Keiths memory will live on in the hearts of those who knew and loved him.\n\nVisitation for Keith will be from 10 a.m. until the funeral hour of noon Saturday, Aug. 10, at Greater Dimension Ministries in Cape Girardeau, with Pastor Olevia Smith officiating. Interment, with full military honors, will follow at 2:30 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 10, in Evergreen Cemetery in New Madrid, one hour south of Cape Girardeau.\n\nThe family is honoring Keith with a dinner at the Marston Community Center at 199 Mitchell St. in Marston.\n\nWilliams Funeral Homes is in charge of arrangements."
