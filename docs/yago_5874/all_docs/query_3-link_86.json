        "text": "Rosie O’Donnell got married and didn’t call us.\n\nThe actress/talk show host, who recently suffered a heart attack, moved up her planned wedding to fiancee Michelle Rounds after Rounds was diagnosed with desmoid tumors, a rare disease that only affects three out of every million people.\n\nThe couple exchanged vows on June 9 in a private ceremony in New York, O’Donnell’s rep Cindi Berger told People.com. “They got married but they haven’t had the wedding celebration.”\n\nSo that’s why we didn’t get an invite yet.\n\nThe two originally planned to be married in August, but they choose to get married quietly in June before Rounds’s first surgery on June 14.\n\n“It is such a rare tumor. It took them quite a while to get an accurate diagnosis,” said Berger. “She had several gastrointestinal surgeries to remove the desmoid tumors. She is now on the road to recovery.”\n\nO’Donnell, meanwhile, took to her blog to share the happy news.\n\n“We married in private before (Michelle’s) surgery, just the (two) of us,” she wrote. “When we r both well enough will have the wedding of r dreams surrounded by those we cherish.”\n\n“Thankful for the love and support so many have given us during these trying times,” she continued. “Including all of u stranger-friends connected thru invisible strands of wi fi.”\n\nDid the heart attack mess up her ability to spell?\n\nO’Donnell and Rounds hope to raise awareness for desmoid tumors by participating in the annual DTRF Running for Answers 5K, held in Philadelphia on Oct. 21. They are raising funds and plan to match all donations made to Rounds’s fundraising page.\n\nKATY PERRY TURNS DOWN A LOT OF MONEY FROM ‘AMERICAN IDOL’: Sounds like the producers over at “American Idol” are printing money in the basement.\n\nTMZ reported Monday that Katy Perry turned down $20 million to be a judge during the upcoming season.\n\nRight about now, one can imagine Mariah Carey having a two million dollar fit.\n\nSources close to the production said the show pursued Perry relentlessly for weeks, trying to sign her up, starting at $18 million (Carey’s salary) and upping it to $20 million when she balked.\n\nPerry apparently made it clear it wasn’t about the money. Her schedule made it difficult, plus Perry didn’t think it was a good career move.\n\nShe may dress funny, but you have to respect someone turning down that kind of money to sit and listen to people sing badly for a living.\n\nSUPERMAN AND WONDER WOMAN ARE DATING: Superman and Wonder Woman have hooked up.\n\nMight want to be far, far away when that relationship gets consummated. Somebody might lose an eye.\n\nThe pair share a super smooch on the cover of the new issue of “Justice League.”\n\nAccording to USAToday.com, this could be a powerful pairing for DC Comics.\n\nThe edition will be available in comic shops and digitally on Wednesday, and centers on the climactic battle between the Justice League members and their foes, the Graves, who has captured Steve Trevor — Wonder Woman’s ex and the heroes’ liaison to the government — and forced Batman, the Flash and others to face their deepest fears.\n\n“The Justice League is really exposed for who they are,” says Jim Lee, the co-publisher of DC, “and they’re very much like you or me.”\n\nRight. For example, like me, Superman sometimes gets leg cramps when he walks to the mailbox.\n\nIn the aftermath, Superman and Wonder Woman find themselves in a quiet moment and realize how similar they are, leading to an intimate moment.\n\nIt’s not the first time Superman and Wonder Woman have been all kissy-kissy. They were even married in a dream sequence in 1983’s “Wonder Woman” issue 300.\n\nBut DC Comics says they’re in it for the long haul now.\n\n“The idea is that we have the freedom right now to explore what a relationship between Superman and Wonder Woman would really look like and how that would form and why,” says “Justice League” writer Geoff Johns, who’s also DC’s chief creative officer.\n\nIf they breed, I have an idea that kid wouldn’t have problems getting dates.\n\n“How do they affect one another? They’re similar in many ways, but they’re very, very different in a lot of ways and they both have different viewpoints and different upbringings and different M.O.s, so to see those two come together is going to be some great storytelling.”\n\nSo how’s Lois Lane with all this?\n\nApparently Superman’s wife didn’t cross over when DC relaunched its superhero line last fall. In other words, what she doesn’t know won’t hurt her.\n\nRIHANNA SENDING ROBERT PATTINSON ‘SEXY TEXTS’: Looks like Robert Pattinson may have found a way to get over Kristen Stewart.\n\nApparently, Pattinson and Rihanna have been exchanging “sexy, funny texts” recently. Rihanna reportedly began texting Pattinson after news broke that Stewart cheated on him, according to an article published in OK! Magazine via Hollywood Life.\n\n“They’ve met several times at award bashes over the years,” a friend of the singer reportedly told the magazine. “RiRi thinks he’s very cute, but nothing ever came of it because he was attached to Kristen — and it’s not her style to steal someone else’s man.”\n\n“She got Rob’s phone number from a mutual friend and has been sending him sexy, funny texts to cheer him up,” the source continued. “At first, Rob thought someone Punk’d him. Eventually Rihanna convinced him she was for real, but Rob has been resisting her.”\n\nHe’s been … what?\n\nStewart’s affair with her “Snow White and the Huntsman” director Rupert Sanders went public in late July. The “Twilight” actress quickly offered a public apology to Pattinson. Since then, Pattinson moved out of the Los Feliz home he shared with Stewart.\n\nRihanna was recently seen racing go-karts and hitting L.A. clubs with Rob Kardashian, according to Yahoo! But there’s nothing romantic going on; Rob is dating Rihanna’s pal Rita Ora.\n\nRANDY TRAVIS’ TRUCK FOUND WRECKED: Police in Frisco, Texas, found a smashed up truck belonging to Randy Travis early Saturday morning, but a lawyer for the troubled country star says Travis hasn’t been in that vehicle for months.\n\nThe question is: Was he in it when it rolled? And, if so, how might that have happened?\n\nThe truck was found on its side in a field just one day after Travis was cited for assault outside a church in nearby Plano. Travis has been arrested for DWI and been involved at least one other incident involving alcohol this year.\n\nIn other words, Randy Travis just might … maybe … possibly …have some sort of drinking problem. Maybe.\n\nA lawyer for Travis told a local news station Travis isn’t the one who left it there and that Travis had not been in that truck for the past few months.\n\nUh-huh. Maybe it was stolen and he just forgot to call the police.\n\nIn addition to the church arrest allegedly fueled by alcohol last week, Travis was arrested for DWI on Aug. 7 after he crashed his car. Cops found Travis buck naked. After being arrested, Travis threatened the police. Which is always a good idea.\n\nJOURNEY TO PLAY MITT ROMNEY FUNDRAISER: Journey is accepting taking $500,000 to play a campaign event for Mitt Romney, according to TMZ.\n\nThe event is Thursday night at a private fundraising party in Tampa while the Republican National Convention is in town. The American Action Network said the half million to secure the 90-minute set.\n\nTMZ quoted sources as insisting Journey is not endorsing Romney or making a political statement by accepting the offer, and the fundraiser is just another gig.\n\nKeep telling yourselves that, guys. Don’t stop believing.\n\nContact Tony Hicks at thicks@bayareanewsgroups .com or on Facebook at www.facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks.\n\nAUGUST 28 IN HISTORY\n\nTuesday is Aug. 28, the 241st day of 2012.

Yates later pleaded guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy and agreed to help prosecutors; he was sentenced to one year and one day in prison.)\n\n2007: After reports surfaced of his June arrest at the Minneapolis airport, Senator Larry Craig, R-Idaho, told a news conference the only thing he’d done wrong was to plead guilty after a police complaint of lewd conduct in a men’s room; Craig also declared, “I am not gay. I never have been gay.” A military court at Fort Meade, Md., acquitted Army Lt. Col. Steven L. Jordan of failing to control U.S. soldiers who’d abused detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, but found him guilty of disobeying an order not to discuss the investigation. (However, that conviction was later thrown out.)\n\n2011: A suicide bomber blew himself up inside Baghdad’s largest Sunni mosque, killing 29 people during prayers.
