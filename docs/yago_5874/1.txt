biography

Born Aldo DaRe in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania, on September 25, 1926, movie heavy Aldo Ray was born into a large Italian family and grew up in northern California. He entered the Navy in 1944 at age 18 and served as a frogman during World War II. After his discharge, Ray briefly studied political science at the University of California. In 1950, Ray was working as a peace officer in Crockett, California, when he was discovered for films by a Columbia talent scout. By chance Ray landed a role in the Columbia drama Saturday's Hero (1951; with John Derek), and his performance was good enough for Columbia to sign him to a contract.

His husky voice and tough demeanor made him a natural in such war films as Battle Cry (1955; with Tab Hunter and Dorothy Malone). He also gave good performances in several comedies, including Let's Do It Again (1953; with Jane Wyman and Ray Milland) and We're No Angels (1955; with Humphrey Bogart and Joan Bennett).

After a brief first marriage in 1947 that produced a daughter, Ray married actress and fellow Columbia contract player Jeff Donnell in 1954, but they parted ways two years later. Ray wed his third wife in 1960 and, after welcoming two sons, got divorced again in 1967. Emotionally and financially battered by three failed marriages and child support, Ray remained single for the rest of his life.

later years

Ray found good roles hard to come by in the 1970s and 1980s, but somehow he managed to keep working in exploitation and horror films; Ray even acted (but remained clothed) in a late 1970s porno titled Sweet Savage (1979; with Carol Connors). Never earning much money and struggling with alcoholism, Ray was often financially strapped and had to make ends meet by appearing in low-budget films. Even during his seven-year contract with Columbia, Ray never earned more than $600 per week. By the 1980s, however, he began to turn his life and career around. Some of his films from the 1980s include Bog (1983; with Marshall Thompson), Vultures (1983; with Yvonne De Carlo), Evils of the Night (1985; with Tina Louise and Julie Newmar), and Terror Night (1987; with John Ireland and Cameron Mitchell). In late 1989, Ray was diagnosed with throat cancer and passed away on March 27, 1991, just two months after the release of his final film, Shock 'Em Dead (1991; with Troy Donahue and Traci Lords). He was 64 years old. Ray was survived by two sons, a daughter, and a grandchild.
