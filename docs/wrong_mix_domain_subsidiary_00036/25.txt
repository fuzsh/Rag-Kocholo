Switched to Zimbra from a cobbled together collection of MailScanner, spamassassin, clamav, sendmail and dovecot with outdated Outlook on the desktops.

From a server and admin perspective, it is wonderful to control. There are some command line features that aren’t covered in the admin Web GUI but I prefer that environment anyway. It just works.

On the client side, the browser based interface is great. For me, anyway. The users had a difficult time adjusting from their old Outlook even though the capabilities of the new client was far superior. But they have finally gotten used to it.

One thing they decided they loved, however, was the built-in instant messaging. That one feature alone is keeping me from upgrading to the next version since they have phased that out of the package. And I would have a revolt on my hands!

Played with the virtual appliance. Never got it working as it was fluky. Will try a full server again someday. I tried it a while back and - meh. If they ever add windows server compatibility (core server is great!) for us MS Server shops - I’ll give it another spin.

I have never used this software as a fully functional mail server, as I already had one that was up and running just fine. I did however experiment with deploying Zimbra from an OVF template and was very impressed with the how easily I was able to have a VM of a fully functional (although not configured) mail server. This will be my next mail server, now I just need a reason to change. After reading NetworkNerd’s review below, I almost wish my current server would die so I had a more compelling reason to use this full time. My rating is purely based on how simple it was to deploy as a VM. AWESOME!

If I had to pinpoint the biggest contender to take the place of Exchange, I would pick Zimbra in a heartbeat. It runs on Linux (a free OS at that) and is more lightweight on server resources. I feel like it goes toe to toe with Exchange, and depending on your usage case and needs, kicks its tail. OWA is cool and improved in Exchange 2010, but I have yet to see a rival to the web interface of Zimbra. I love it as well as the fast search capabilities, the briefcase feature, and much, much more. I’d love to run it in production someday.

I understand it is a competition of exchange, even when implemented in enterprise environment is expensive and less functional, plus if you want to synchronize blackberrys must pay an additional component, must be analyzed carefully before attempting to take zimbra

I have run the network edition in-house for about 5 years. It’s been easy to administer and very reliable. I would say that it’s biggest plus is being able to use it with pretty much any client, any browser, and operating system, due to it being choc full of open protocols (as well as working with the typical MS protocols). So it’s probably one of the best choices for email server in a heterogeneous computing environment.

For personal use and small businesses Zimbra Collaboration Suite will allow users to enjoy the most common features in Microsoft Exchange without the cost or administrative overhead of Exchange. If you are a business with less than 100 users than I would strongly look into using Zimbra Collaboration Suite as your solution. Zimbra can and is also being used in enterprise environments.

Easy to deploy via VMWare. Download the OVA file from the site and deploy to the desired physical host. From start to finish: 12 minutes. However, it took 4 days to get a license delivered. Once I applied the license, all went reasonably well. The Bad:

Getting Active Directory to sync was a challenge.

Support from Zimbra has been slow and somewhat unresponsive, so choose a reseller carfully! Maybe you can get help from them.

The Good:

The feature set is impressive. The users have grasped the user interface quickly. Sharing a folder (with internal or external users) and the Briefcase feature could turn into major process improvements for us! Filters (like Outlook’s Rules) are very easy for even non-techies to set up. Adding storage is a breeze – just add a disk via VMWare and reboot. It sense the extra space and merge it into the storage pool. You can sync to mobile devices or let them use the excellent web interface,

I attempted to purchase Zimbra recently after Telligent purchased them. I was met with confusion and issue after issue. The company was at first unaware of who to direct me to (vendor wise) and then the vendor took there sweet time assisting me.

For a purchase that was going to be upwards around 50k for our deployment I would of thought I would get better service. The fact the Sales Dept was in chaos from my point of view left me worried how much worse or better the Support Dept might be.

I used Zimbra 2+ years ago before it was being tossed around company to company and it is a great product but this experience was rough.

One of my clients ran with Zimbra as a solution around a year. At first great performance and collaborative aspects were better than Exchange at the time. However due to a couple of upgrades of Outlook connector breaking functionality and disrupting workflow, customer moved on. Haven’t experienced Zimbra since latest version came out. I hope they refine this product as it had great potential.

its a good sw but need to enhance more.The great part about zimbra is that it works out of the box. Spam filter/virus scanning, just works. Logging just works. There’s virtually no maintenance required just a quarterly update.
