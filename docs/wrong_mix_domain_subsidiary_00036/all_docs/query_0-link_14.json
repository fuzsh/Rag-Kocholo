        "text": "Dallas, TX (PRWEB) May 15, 2014 -- EY announced that Patrick Brandt, Zimbra CEO, is a finalist for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year™ 2014 Award in the Southwest region. The awards program recognizes entrepreneurs who demonstrate excellence and extraordinary success in such areas as innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities. Brandt was selected as a finalist by a panel of independent judges. This year’s winners will be announced at a gala event on June 21 at the Sheraton Dallas Hotel.\n\n“It’s an incredible honor to be recognized as a finalist for the 2014 EY Entrepreneur of the Year, however it’s really all about the Zimbra team. This is more a testament to the hard work everyone in our organization does on a daily basis,” said Brandt. “It’s truly humbling to be part of such a great group of individuals, and I view this honor as a direct reflection of the company’s success and accomplishments over the past year.”\n\nA veteran enterprise software entrepreneur and executive, Brandt has a proven track record of leading companies through rapid growth and expansion. In July 2013, Telligent acquired Zimbra from VMware. The two businesses merged to form Zimbra, Inc., where Brandt currently serves as CEO and Chairman. Zimbra powers modern collaboration for the mobile era, connecting people and information with a unified communications software platform that combines traditional and social collaboration. Prior, Brandt was the founder and CEO of Skywire Software. During his eight-year tenure at Skywire Software, Brandt led the company through organic growth, 11 acquisitions and the negotiated sale of Skywire Software's enterprise software business to Oracle.\n\nNow in its 28th year, the program has expanded to recognize business leaders in more than 145 cities in more than 60 countries throughout the world. Regional award winners are eligible for consideration for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year National program. Award winners in several national categories, as well as the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year National Overall Award winner, will be announced at the annual awards gala in Palm Springs, California, on November 15, 2014. The awards are the culminating event of the EY Strategic Growth Forum®, the nation’s most prestigious gathering of high-growth, market-leading companies.\n\n###\n\nAbout Zimbra\n\nZimbra powers collaboration for the way you work.
