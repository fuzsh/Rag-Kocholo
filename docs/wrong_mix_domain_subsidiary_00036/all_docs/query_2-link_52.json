        "text": "Biography\n\nDr. Hsinchun Chen is University of Arizona Regents’ Professor and Thomas R. Brown Chair in Management and Technology in the Management Information Systems (MIS) Department and Professor of Entrepreneurship & Innovation in the McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship at the College of Management of the University of Arizona. He received the B.S. degree from the National Chiao-Tung University in Taiwan, the MBA degree from SUNY Buffalo, and the Ph.D. degree in Information Systems from the New York University. Dr. Chen is director of the Artificial Intelligence Lab and has served as a faculty of the UA MIS department (ranked #3 in MIS) since 1989. In 2014-2015, he also served as the lead program director for the National Science Foundation's program in Smart and Connected Health. He has also served as a Scientific Counselor/Advisor of the National Library of Medicine (USA), Academia Sinica (Taiwan), and National Library of China (China).\n\nDr. Chen is a Fellow of IEEE, ACM, and AAAS. He received the IEEE Computer Society 2006 Technical Achievement Award, the 2008 INFORMS Design Science Award, the MIS Quarterly 2010 Best Paper Award, the IEEE 2011 Research Achievement and Leadership Award in Intelligence and Security Informatics, and the UA 2013 Technology Innovation Award. He was also a finalist of the AZ Tech Council’s Governor’s Innovation of the Year Award in 2011 and named in the Arizona Centennial Top 100 Scientists in 2012. He is the author/editor of 20 books, 25 book chapters, 280 SCI journal articles, and 150 refereed conference articles covering Web computing, search engines, digital library, intelligence analysis, biomedical informatics, data/text/web mining, and knowledge management. His recent books include: Dark Web (2012); Sports Data Mining (2010); Infectious Disease Informatics (2010); Terrorism Informatics (2008); Mapping Nanotechnology Knowledge and Innovation (2008), Digital Government (2007); Intelligence and Security Informatics for International Security (2006); and Medical Informatics (2005), all published by Springer.\n\nDr. Chen’s publication productivity in Information Systems was ranked #8 in a bibliometric study in (CAIS 2005) and #9 in (EJIS, 2007); and he was ranked #1 in Digital Library research in a study in (IP&M 2005), #1 in JASIST publication for 1998-2007 in (JASIST 2008) and #5 in h-index in IEEE Intelligent Systems publications for 1986-2010 in (IEEE IS 2010). His overall h-index in 2012 is 67, which is ranked in the top 10 for information retrieval researchers in computer science and #4 among all University of Arizona faculty according to Microsoft Academic Search, and #1 among all faculty in the MIS (tied with Andy Whinston) according to Google Scholar.\n\nHe is the founding editor and served as first Editor-in-Chief (EIC) of the ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems (ACM TMIS); he also founded and serves as EIC of Springer's open access journal Security Informatics (SI). He serves on numerous editorial boards including: IEEE Intelligent Systems, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, Decision Support Systems, and International Journal on Digital Library.\n\nHe has been an advisor for major NSF, DOJ, NLM, DOD, DHS, and other international research programs in digital library, digital government, medical informatics, and national security research. Dr. Chen founded Artificial Intelligence Lab, which has received more than $35M in research funding from NSF, NIH, NLM, DOD, DOJ, CIA, DHS, and other agencies (90 grants, 40 from NSF). Dr. Chen has also produced 30 Ph.D. students who are placed in major academic institutions around the world. Dr. Chen was conference co-chair of ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) 2004 and had served as the conference/program co-chair for eight International Conferences of Asian Digital Libraries (ICADL), the premiere digital library meeting in Asia that he helped develop. He had served as the Program Chair of the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) 2009, the premiere MIS conference. Dr. Chen is also (founding) conference co-chair of the IEEE International Conferences on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI) 2003-present. The ISI conference, which has been sponsored by NSF, CIA, DHS, and NIJ, has become the premiere meeting for international and homeland security IT research.\n\nDr. Chen’s COPLINK system, which has been quoted as a national model for public safety information sharing and analysis, has been adopted in more than 3500 law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The COPLINK research had been featured in the New York Times, Newsweek, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Boston Globe, and ABC News, among others. The COPLINK project was selected as a finalist by the prestigious International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP)/Motorola 2003 Weaver Seavey Award for Quality in Law Enforcement in 2003. COPLINK research has since been expanded to border protection (BorderSafe), disease and bioagent surveillance (BioPortal), and terrorism informatics research (Dark Web), funded by NSF, DOD, CIA, and DHS. In collaboration with selected international terrorism research centers and intelligence agencies, the Dark Web project has generated one of the largest databases in the world about extremist/terrorist-generated Internet contents (web sites, forums, blogs, and multimedia documents). Dark Web research supports link analysis, content analysis, web metrics analysis, multimedia analysis, sentiment analysis, and authorship analysis of international terrorism contents. The project has received significant international press coverage, including: Associated Press, USA Today, The Economist, NSF Press, Washington Post, BBC, PBS, Business Week, WIRED magazine, and Arizona Daily Star, among others. Dr. Chen recently received additional major NSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyperspace (SaTC) program funding ($5.4M) for his Hacker Web research and Cybersecurity Analytics fellowship program.\n\nDr. Chen is also a successful entrepreneur. He is the founder of the Knowledge Computing Corporation (KCC), a university spin-off IT company and a market leader in law enforcement and intelligence information sharing and data mining. KCC merged i2, the industry leader in intelligence analytics and fraud detection, in 2009. The combined i2/KCC company was acquired by IBM in 2011 for $500M. Dr. Chen founded Caduceus Intelligence Corporation, another UA spin-off company, in 2010. Caduceus is developing web-based systems for healthcare informatics and patient support. Its first product named DiabeticLink will provide diabetes patient intelligence and services in US, Taiwan, China, and Denmark in 2013 and 2014.\n\nDr. Chen has also received numerous awards in information technology and knowledge management education and research including: AT&T Foundation Award, SAP Award, the Andersen Consulting Professor of the Year Award, the University of Arizona Technology Innovation Award, and the National Chiao-Tung University Distinguished Alumnus Award. Dr. Chen had served as a keynote or invited speaker in major international security informatics, health informatics, information systems, knowledge management, and digital library conferences and major international government meetings (NATO, UN, EU, FBI, CIA, DOD, DHS). He had served as Distinguished/Honorary Professor of several major universities in Taiwan and China (including Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University). He was named the Distinguished University Chair Professor of the National Taiwan University in 2010 and was elected as China National 1000-Elite Chair Professor with the Tsinghua University in 2013.\n\nDegrees\n\nPh.D. Information Systems\n\nNew York University, New York, New York\n\nAn Artificial Intelligence Approach to the Design of Online Information Retrieval Systems (advisor: Vasant Dhar)\n\nM.S.
