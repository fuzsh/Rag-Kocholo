        "text": "Bacula is software that allows system administrators to manage backup, restore and verification of data from computers in a mixed system network. As it is so flexible, Bacula is considered a backup framework, which can be implemented in the most different corporate structures.\n\nBacula Enterprise supports both the Standard and Archive tier in Oracle Cloud Object Storage. Regarding the Archive Storage, the user needs to retrieve the necessary volumes for a restore manually via OCI web console or CLI in advance, before submitting the Bacula restore operation. This could also be automated by scripts.\n\nWith Bacula Enterprise, it is possible to backup a large amount of different applications with plug-ins for VMs (VMware, Hyper-V, KVM, Xen, Proxmox, and so on), for databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, SAP, SQL Server, Active Directory, LDAP, MongoDB, and so on) and for other several tools like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Docker, Kubernetes, Hadoop HDFS, Linux and Windows Bare Metal, Zimbra, MS Exchange, Sharepoint and Cloud (Oracle, Amazon Glacier, Google, Azure, Swift and S3).\n\nThe following diagrams illustrate reference architectures showing the use of Bacula Enterprise for backup and restore where Bacula Server can be either on-premises or Cloud. The backups are stored in Object Storage and the traffic flows through a private connection using FastConnect or Site-to-Site VPN and DRG integration with Service Gateway.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the reference architecture for Bacula Enterprise - Backup to OCI Object Storage and Backup restore to OCI VM.\n\noci-bacula-backup-restore-oracle.zip\n\nThe architecture shows a process where Bacula (being in an on-premises environment) is accessed through CLI or BWeb interface to send a backup command integrating Bacula with OCI Object Storage. Once the integration and configuration is complete the job will start and the file will be transfered to a bucket in OCI Object Storage using a private connection with FastConnect or Site-to-Site VPN and DRG integration with Service Gateway. After that, a similar process is executed using the restore feature to send the file from OCI Object Storage to a Block Volume attached in a Virtual Machine.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the reference architecture for Bacula Enterprise - Backup to OCI Object Storage (Cloud only). The image shows a process where Bacula (now running in Oracle Cloud) is accessed through CLI or BWeb interface as well to send a backup command integrating Bacula with OCI Object Storage. As in the previous architecture, after the integration and configuration is complete the job will start and the file will be transfered to a bucket in OCI Object Storage using the Service Gateway directly once the full scenario is already in OCI.\n\noci-bacula-backup-object-storage-oracle.zip\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the reference architecture for Bacula Enterprise - Restore to OCI (Cloud only). After the backup is completed as described in the previous image, a similar process is executed as shown in the following image using the restore feature to send the file from OCI Object Storage to a Block Volume attached in a Virtual Machine.\n\noci-bacula-restore-oracle.zip\n\nThe architecture has the following components:\n\nTenancy\n\nA tenancy is a secure and isolated partition that Oracle sets up within Oracle Cloud when you sign up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. You can create, organize, and administer your resources in Oracle Cloud within your tenancy. A tenancy is synonymous with a company or organization. Usually, a company will have a single tenancy and reflect its organizational structure within that tenancy. A single tenancy is usually associated with a single subscription, and a single subscription usually only has one tenancy.\n\nRegion\n\nAn Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region is a localized geographic area that contains one or more data centers, called availability domains. Regions are independent of other regions, and vast distances can separate them (across countries or even continents).\n\nCompartment\n\nCompartments are cross-region logical partitions within an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy. Use compartments to organize your resources in Oracle Cloud, control access to the resources, and set usage quotas. To control access to the resources in a given compartment, you define policies that specify who can access the resources and what actions they can perform.\n\nAvailability domains\n\nAvailability domains are standalone, independent data centers within a region. The physical resources in each availability domain are isolated from the resources in the other availability domains, which provides fault tolerance. Availability domains donât share infrastructure such as power or cooling, or the internal availability domain network. So, a failure at one availability domain is unlikely to affect the other availability domains in the region.\n\nVirtual cloud network (VCN) and subnets\n\nA VCN is a customizable, software-defined network that you set up in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region. Like traditional data center networks, VCNs give you complete control over your network environment. A VCN can have multiple non-overlapping CIDR blocks that you can change after you create the VCN. You can segment a VCN into subnets, which can be scoped to a region or to an availability domain. Each subnet consists of a contiguous range of addresses that don't overlap with the other subnets in the VCN. You can change the size of a subnet after creation. A subnet can be public or private.\n\nService gateway\n\nThe service gateway provides access from a VCN to other services, such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage. The traffic from the VCN to the Oracle service travels over the Oracle network fabric and never traverses the internet.\n\nObject storage\n\nObject storage provides quick access to large amounts of structured and unstructured data of any content type, including database backups, analytic data, and rich content such as images and videos. You can safely and securely store and then retrieve data directly from the internet or from within the cloud platform. You can seamlessly scale storage without experiencing any degradation in performance or service reliability. Use standard storage for \"hot\" storage that you need to access quickly, immediately, and frequently. Use archive storage for \"cold\" storage that you retain for long periods of time and seldom or rarely access.\n\nNetwork Connectivity\n\nTo enable your administrators to manage the environment, you can connect to your existing on-premises infrastructure by using site-to-site IPSec VPN connections or dedicated Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect circuits. Utilize the private endpoint option to enable private access to services within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Private access means that traffic does not go over the Internet.\n\nDynamic routing gateway (DRG)\n\nThe DRG is a virtual router that provides a path for private network traffic between VCNs in the same region, between a VCN and a network outside the region, such as a VCN in another Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region, an on-premises network, or a network in another cloud provider.\n\nVirtual Machine (VM)\n\nA virtual machine (VM) is an independent computing environment that runs on top of physical bare metal hardware. The virtualization makes it possible to run multiple VMs that are isolated from each other. VMs are ideal for running applications that do not require the performance and resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage) of an entire physical machine. An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure VM compute instance runs on the same hardware as a bare metal instance, leveraging the same cloud-optimized hardware, firmware, software stack, and networking infrastructure.\n\nBlock volume\n\nWith block storage volumes, you can create, attach, connect, and move storage volumes, and change volume performance to meet your storage, performance, and application requirements. After you attach and connect a volume to an instance, you can use the volume like a regular hard drive. You can also disconnect a volume and attach it to another instance without losing data."
