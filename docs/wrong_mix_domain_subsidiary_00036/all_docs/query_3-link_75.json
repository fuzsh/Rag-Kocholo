The mindshare of Zimbra Collaboration is 12.9%, up from 11.6% compared to the previous year. It is calculated based on PeerSpot user engagement data.\n\nEmail Applications\n\nUnique Categories:\n\nFeatured Reviews\n\nQuotes from Members\n\nWe asked business professionals to review the solutions they use. Here are some excerpts of what they said:\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\n\"It could be simpler to use and install, but I still wouldn't use it because there isn't a compelling use case.\"\n\n\"Most of our clients use Outlook and Kerio Connect. Occasionally, Kerio can be a bit slow. They could make it faster to get onto the web interface without so much load time. It's just slow with Outlook, however, for some reason.\"\n\n\"Having a native Outlook map integration would make Kerio Connect better.\"\n\n\"The search and archiving documentation capabilities need to be stronger.\"\n\n\"I would like to see better support from their support team.\"\n\n\"We are considering switching to Microsoft Exchange. One reason is that it doesn't improve our workflow and doesn't integrate well with Microsoft 365 applications.\"\n\n\"The solution could improve the redundancy because we only have one copy of the Kerio Connect server on our hardware. The next step for us is to move to the cloud and if Kerio does not have a cloud version available they should release one\"\n\n\"KerioConnect continues to improve with regular updates throughout the year. They must be added to the roadmap, which requires approval.\"\n\n\"It is good and competent, but you have to pay for video and group chat features.\"\n\n\"Zimbra Collaboration could improve the migration from a basic solution to a more containerized solution. For example, the installation should be able to extend to the containers and manage them with some solution, such as OpenShift or Kubernetes.\"\n\n\"The product must be more customizable.\"\n\n\"It would be great if a group chat feature were created to allow for a team environment.\"\n\n\"Zimbra Collaboration's video conferencing could be improved.\"\n\n\"It does have a few bugs.\"\n\n\"The solution could use more integration with third-party tools.\"\n\n\"File sharing permissions with Nextcloud integration need improvement.\"\n\nPricing and Cost Advice\n\nUse our free recommendation engine to learn which Email Applications solutions are best for your needs.\n\n792,905 professionals have used our research since 2012.\n\nTop Industries\n\nBy visitors reading reviews\n\nCompany Size\n\nBy reviewers\n\nLarge Enterprise\n\nMidsize Enterprise\n\nSmall Business\n\nQuestions from the Community\n\nSample Customers\n\nSouthern Tier Brewing Company, Innotta, Baustoff + Metall, Hamifleurs, Chanson TV, Ryman Stationery\n\nNEC Biglobe, City of Ventura, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Hola Publishing, BIG, Sleepwell, LaFayette College, Xmission, DNA, Ring Line, Future Group, TIGC"
