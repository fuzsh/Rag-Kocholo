        "text": "General CSR Creation Guidelines\n\nProtect your site with the world’s most trusted TLS/SSL certificates.\n\nBuy Now\n\nBefore you can get a TLS/SSL certificate, you must generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) from your server or device. Learn more about SSL certificates »\n\nWhat is a CSR?\n\nA CSR is an encoded file that provides a standardized way to send DigiCert your public key and some information identifying your company and domain name.\n\nWhat information must I include in my CSR?\n\nWhen you generate a CSR, most server software asks for the following information: common name (e.g., www.example.com), organization name and location (country, state/province, city/town), key type (typically RSA), and key size (2048-bit minimum).\n\nIf you're uncertain about the exact company name or location when generating the CSR, don't worry. We offer the flexibility to modify and finalize that information during our review process before issuing the certificate.\n\nWhat do I do with my CSR?\n\nOnce you've created the CSR, you'll need to copy and paste it into the online form where you submit a request to get a TLS/SSL certificate."
