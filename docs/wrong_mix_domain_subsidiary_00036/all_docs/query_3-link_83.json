Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including storage, processing power, and applications, over the Internet, offering on-demand access to resources without the need for local infrastructure. Cloud adoption is rising due to its unparalleled ability to enhance operational efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Email management software enables organizations to efficiently organize, filter, and secure email communications, leveraging the scalability and accessibility of cloud-based infrastructure. For instance, in April 2023, according to survey data of 750 IT professionals and executive leaders published by Flexera, a US-based computer software company, 87% of organizations adopted a multi-cloud, of which 72% adopted a hybrid cloud, 13% adopted a multiple public cloud, and 2% adopted a multiple private cloud in 2022. Furthermore, the cloud spending by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) reflects a massive uptake, with 52% spending more than $1.2 million in 2022, up from 38% reported in 2021. Therefore, the growing adoption of cloud computing is driving the growth of the email management software market.\n\nAdvancement In Technology to Provide Enhanced Email Security Tools\n\nMajor companies operating in the email management software market are focusing on developing advanced technology tools, such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-powered artificial intelligence software, to gain a competitive advantage. GPT-powered artificial intelligence software refers to the integration of advanced language processing capabilities to enhance email management functionalities. For instance, in May 2023, Karbon, a US-based practice management software for accounting firms, launched Karbon AI, a new artificial intelligence tool powered by GPT technology. Karbon AI prioritizes enhancing accountants' email efficiency and improving client experiences. Its functionalities encompass summarizing lengthy email exchanges and internal dialogues, modifying email tones, evaluating inbox email priorities, and generating email drafts prompted by and within workflow tasks. The tool maintains data privacy and security by being powered by the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service.\n\nThe email management software market covered in this report is segmented -\n\n1) By Type: Cloud-Based, On-Premises, Other Types\n\n2) By Platform: Windows, Macintosh Operating System, Linux\n\n3) By Organization Size: Large Enterprises, Small And Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)\n\n4) By Industry Vertical: Banking, Financial Services And Insurance (BFSI), Healthcare, Information Technology (IT) And Telecommunication, Government, Retail, Education, Travel And Hospitality, Other Industrial Verticals\n\nBuy Now & Get Exclusive Discount on this Report, Checkout link @\n\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/Discount?id=16045&type=discount\n\nMajor companies operating in the email management software market are Amazon.com Inc., Google LLC, Microsoft Corporation, IBM Corporation, Cisco Systems Inc., Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com Inc., GoDaddy Inc., Twilio Inc., Rackspace Technology Inc., NortonLifeLock Inc., HubSpot Inc., Proofpoint Inc., Zoho Corporation Pvt.
