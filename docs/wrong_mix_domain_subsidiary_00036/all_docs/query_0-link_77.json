Our monthly list of the biggest cyber attacks, ransomware attacks and data breaches captures all the major cybersecurity incidents that took place in the month of November, 2023.\n\nThe objective as always, isn't to turn the spotlight on the victims, but to emphasise the rise in cyber crime and how it can impact almost every business or government body. The only real prevention today is preparation. Nobody can save you from cyber attacks but you can save yourself by mitigating their impact through effective cyber incident response.\n\nAlso, make sure you test your response capabilities through regular cyber attack tabletop exercises. These act like a litmus test of your cyber resilience capabilities. While we always recommend hiring an external facilitator for your cybersecurity tabletop exercises, if you plan to run your own, don't forget to use our free resources and customise them to your organisational needs and threat context.\n\nTop Cyber Tabletop Exercise Scenarios\n\nCyber Security Tabletop Exercise Template\n\nCyber Tabletop Exercise PPT\n\nCyber Crisis Tabletop Exercise Checklist\n\nThese resources have been created by the world's #1 tabletop exercise facilitator and can help you run and effective incident response tabletop exercise of your own.\n\nIf you still feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do to get your cybersecurity maturity in order, you can check out our cyber consulting services.\n\nWe have created an unmatched value proposition with our Virtual Cyber Assistant service. In the most cost-effective and flexible format possible, you can improve your cybersecurity posture over time.
