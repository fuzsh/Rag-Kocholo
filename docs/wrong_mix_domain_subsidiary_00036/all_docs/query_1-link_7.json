More powerful shapes may be needed for larger loads. ...come see us for more information… Booth #1901 in the Linux Showcase Tuesday Noon – Showcase Theater Session Contains proprietary and confidential information owned by Synacor, Inc. © / 2016 Synacor, Inc.\n\n22. 22 ADDITIONAL NOTES More Info and Reference Links • www.zimbra.com • https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Configuring_Zimbra_Using_Chef_Oracle _Cloud - Reference for building a Zimbra Instance in the Oracle Cloud using Orchestrations and chef-solo, includes sample Orchestrations • https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Installing_Zimbra_Using_Chef - How to build a Zimbra Instance with chef-solo on a Oracle Linux Server, includes recipes and templates • https://cloud.oracle.com • https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-collaboration/ Contains proprietary and confidential information owned by Synacor, Inc. © / 2016 Synacor, Inc.\n\n23. 23 THANK YOU Contains proprietary and confidential information owned by Synacor, Inc. © / 2016 Synacor, Inc. 23 SYNC"
