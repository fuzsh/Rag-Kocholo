        "text": "Now that Oracle has completed its Sun acquisition, HP and Microsoft renew their alliance. Partners are watching to see if and where they fit in the great game among the giant IT vendors.\n\nThough they've been partners for 25 years, it's not every day the CEOs of Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Co. gather to make a public announcement. Yet that's what Steve Ballmer and Mark Hurd did just six weeks ago when they said they were investing $250 million in next-generation data center technology.\n\nEven more striking, Ballmer and Hurd positioned this particular alliance as the most important technology and go-to-market effort to date by the two companies. While it remains to be seen whether it lives up to the grandiose expectations they have set, the deal calls for collaborating on a model that ties together infrastructure and applications and marries both companies' technologies including the HP line of servers, systems management software and network gear with Microsoft SQL Server, SharePoint, Windows Server, System Center, Hyper-V and its new Windows Azure cloud services.\n\nThe goal with Windows Azure and SQL Azure (which went live in January) through this alliance, is to ultimately enable public and private cloud offerings with technology from Microsoft and HP for companies of all sizes. Private cloud offerings could be delivered with a combination of software from both companies on the ProLiant server and HP storage platforms, the companies indicated.\n\n\"This is breakthrough stuff for us,\" Hurd said on the Jan. 13 conference call. \"It's a different thing than you've seen from the two of us before. I guarantee you Steve and I would not be on this phone call if this was just another press release from HP and Microsoft. This is the deepest level of collaboration and integration and technical work we've done that I'm certainly aware of; we're talking about aligning big parts of our go-to-market capability.\"\n\nThat go-to-market capability will manifest itself in a 10-fold increase in investment in its channel partners through added support, readiness, incentives and co-marketing efforts, Ballmer said. That will be delivered through the Frontline Partnership, a structure both companies have used to bring joint, bundled solutions to customers. With Frontline, any channel partner with a Microsoft Partner Program ID number and an HP PartnerOne ID can log in and use resources of the shared program.\n\nSo far however, only 32,000 partners are technically part of Frontline, a small fraction of Microsoft's roughly 400,000 partners and HP's 150,000. And many of those Frontline partners are lukewarm about it. \"It's hard to ascertain what the Frontline piece means,\" says Brandon Harris, vice president for HP Solutions at Bloomfield, Mich.-based Logicalis Group, a $1 billion solution provider with operations in the United States, United Kingdom and Latin America.\n\n\"The partners who really understand the value of leveraging the partner programmatic elements from Frontline really seem to like it,\" says Gartner Inc. analyst Tiffani Bova. \"There's also the school of thought that it adds an additional layer of complexity to the partnering relationship.\"\n\nTime will tell how much comes from the latest pact and whether some of the automation and dynamic IT capabilities co-developed by the two companies will cut into the managed services business of their partner networks. Microsoft and HP are also bolstering their relationship on the heels of Oracle Corp. closing it's $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems Inc.\n\nOracle CEO Larry Ellison has already guaranteed that he will wreak havoc on Sun's channel following remarks that he intends to take the top 4,000 accounts direct, while putting the rest of its partners on notice. \"If you simply take the Sun box, do nothing to it, and just resell it, and that's all you're really doing, then at that point we think we are better off going direct to the customers,\" Ellison said during a strategy briefing on Jan. 27, the day the deal closed.\n\nWhile observers agree Microsoft and HP are reacting to their newly bolstered rival, some partners wonder if the latest pact is just another press release, though. On the surface, it doesn't seem that different from any other alliance, says Gregory Brewer, managing member of Vowire LLC, a Brighton, Mich.-based Frontline partner. \"The proof is always in what they do,\" Brewer says. \"Where they need to put wood behind the arrow would be the tactical mechanics of the Frontline piece of it.\" HP says those pieces will be forthcoming but declined comment, though the company did say the benefits would be phased in over time.\n\nWhile HP and Microsoft emphasize the $250 million is incremental on top of existing investments, the companies are not breaking down how those funds will be used. That leaves channel partners wondering what they're going to see from those funds -- and when. \"It's a big chunk of money,\" says Ross Brown, Microsoft's vice president of Worldwide Partner Sales. \"What HP and Microsoft put in is being matched by our subsidiaries. Think of it as 50-50 HP-Microsoft and 50-50 corporate and subsidiary.\"\n\nHP Channel Challenges\n\nYet over the years HP has had a turbulent relationship with its partners, dating back nearly a decade when the company acquired Compaq Computer. It has had ongoing changes in its channel program ever since. While Allison Watson has been Microsoft's top channel exec since 2003, HP has seen turnover in its channel ranks. Most recently, HP channel chief Adrian Jones was promoted to Asia-Pacific vice president for HP's Enterprise, Storage, Servers and Networking in October. A search is still on for his replacement, according to an HP spokesman."
