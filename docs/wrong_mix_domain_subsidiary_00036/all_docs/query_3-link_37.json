        "text": "In previous post, i had shared the steps to setup Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) 8.0.1 Mail Server open source edition on CentOS 6.3 server. At the time this document was written, ZCS 8.0.2 is available. This document shows the upgrading of ZCS from version 8.0.1_GA_5438 to 8.0.2_GA_5569. Before perform the upgrading steps, it is recommended to backup the users mailbox and zimbra configurations.\n\nMajor Issues Fixed for 8.0.2\n\n-Task list view fields now are updated after they are edited.\n\n-Fixed issues that caused Contact lists to not sync correctly.\n\n-ZCS cluster zimlet was trying to access httpOnly cookie which is no longer available after release 7.2.0. This resulted in a session expired on the admin console. The Cluster zimlet has been fixed to pass the correct parameters.\n\n-Calendar. Issues in Calendar localized version around Reminder timer and saving appointments has been fixed.\n\n-Install and Upgrade. The MTA restarts correctly after upgrade or install.\n\n-PST migration. PST migration now only imports new and incremental data when Ignore previously imported items option is selected.\n\n-When upgrading to ZCS 8.0, upgrade disables in all of the COSs Zimlets that are not in the certified core Zimlet list. If non-certified Zimlets are enabled at the account level they remain enabled after the upgrade. To disable these Zimlets, the administrator must manually disable these Zimlets on all affected accounts.\n\n-Tags now are migrated when moving a mailbox from 7.x to 8.0.2 directly using zmmboxmove. For mailboxes that moved from 7.x to an earlier version of 8.0, the utility provided in bug 78487 can be used. But if users added new tags to messages or re-tagged messages after the mailbox was moved, when this utility is run these tags are removed.\n\n-For new installs a, a settings was changed in the default mailboxd_java_options in localconfig key because the maximum PermGen size might be too low, leading to java.lang.OutOfMemoryError. This setting is specified in the mailboxd_java_options local config key. After upgrade, the value should be increased to 350m. See http://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=78661#c16 for a detailed example.\n\n-Account migration undoes any benefit of message deduplication of data on a server. Once all migrations are complete a new tool zmdedup can be used to reduce disk usage caused by this.\n\nUpgrading steps :\n\n1. Show current zimbra version :\n\n[zimbra@host1 ~]$ zmcontrol -v Release 8.0.1_GA_5438.RHEL6_64_20121105164412 CentOS6_64 FOSS edition.\n\n2.

Untar the Downloaded package :\n\n[root@host1 ~]# tar xzvf zcs-8.0.2_GA_5569.RHEL6_64.20121210115059.tgz\n\n5. The upgrading steps almost similar with installation steps. You can refer to this official released notes from zimbra.
