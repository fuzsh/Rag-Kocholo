        "text": "FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--International Data Corporation (IDC) has released its 2014 MarketScape report profiling and ranking the leading providers in the worldwide enterprise social networks (ESN) market. The ESN market has changed dramatically over the past 18 months, undergoing a broad transition from focusing on standalone solutions to a situation where social workflow is becoming embedded across enterprise systems, as well as productivity applications.\n\nClicktoTweet, #New #IDCMarketScape Shows Organizations Are Targeting '#DigitalBusiness' #ESN @IDCsocialbiz\n\nThe report, IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Enterprise Social Networks 2014 Vendor Analysis (IDC #252332), evaluates the offerings and prospects of thirteen vendors' relative capabilities. The vendors included in the analysis are IBM, Igloo Software, Infor, Jive Software, Microsoft, Oracle, PeopleFluent, Salesforce.com, SAP, Sitrion, TIBCO, VMware, and Zimbra. These providers were evaluated using detailed criteria that IDC identified as key factors contributing to vendor success in the worldwide enterprise social networks market.\n\nThe IDC MarketScape methodology placed IBM, Jive Software, Salesforce.com, SAP, and TIBCO in the \"Leaders\" category.\n\n\"As social workflow becomes embedded in the way we work and the way we get things done, enterprise social networks have changed significantly,\" says Vanessa Thompson, Research Director, Enterprise Social Networks and Collaborative Technologies. \"Connecting people, data, and information is critical to find experts and make business decisions, but those connections also require context from interactions in a reasonable time period to support a more streamlined escalation or decision-making process.\"\n\nAbout IDC MarketScape\n\nThe IDC MarketScape vendor analysis model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of ICT (information and communications technology) suppliers in a given market. The research methodology utilizes a rigorous scoring methodology based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria that results in a single graphical illustration of each vendorâ€™s position within a given market.

The framework also provides technology buyers with a 360-degree assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current and prospective vendors.\n\nFor more information about IDC MarketScapes, please contact Karen Moser at kmoser@idc.com.\n\nAbout IDC\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) is the premier global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets.
