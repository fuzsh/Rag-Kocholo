        "text": "Karan Singh Grover is one of the leading Indian actors of Bollywood. Apart from being an actor, he is also a dedicated and charming model. But can you believe that Karan Singh Grover got married, not once or twice, but thrice? He had two divorces and three marriages till now. The speed in which he is separating and marrying women seems to be just beyond expectation. Is he serious about his life and family or is he up to something else?\n\nShraddha Nigam and Karan Singh Grover\n\nShradha Nigam was Karan Singh Grover’s first wife. They both got married in the year 2008. They both had a divorce filed after ten months of their marriage. Their married life ended on such a pessimistic note. It was Shraddha’s decision to separate from Karan Singh Grover. Shradha sacrificed her career for her married life, but Karan cheated on her at every stage of their newly wedded life. Shradha was aware of her husband’s affairs with many women in the glamour industry that disappointed her. But when she thought that Karan’s unfaithfulness is no more tolerable, she finally decided to break up with him and start a new living. We still pity Shradha’s fate that during her ex-married life.\n\nKaran Singh Grover and Jennifer Winget\n\nKaran Singh Grover married Jennifer Winget in 2012. Jennifer was the second wife of Karan. This time, it was entirely Karan Singh Grover’s decision to separate from her wife, Jennifer. There were several reasons behind their break-up. Firstly, he was highly addicted to stardom and wanted to reach the peaks of huge success. His flirtatious and womanising behaviour never ended.\n\nIt was also revealed that while Karan Singh Grover was busy with his shooting at the sets of the Bollywood film “Alone”, he was dating the opposing co-star of Alone, Bipasha Basu. His casual affairs and flirtatious nature were the major cause of Jennifer and Karan’s separation.\n\nKaran Singh Grover and Bipasha Basu\n\nIn 2016, Karan Singh Grover married Bipasha Basu, his third and present wife. Though he feels that his third marriage with Bips will sustain perfectly, most of the Indians believe that Karan will part away with Bips also like he did with his first two adorable wives. His profile clearly reveals that for his marriage is not a serious issue. We hope that he does not break Bip’s heart this time."
