        "text": "Someone once brilliantly pointed out that some get lucky in love right away while some take a second shot at it and eventually find happiness. When we talk about second marriages, there are quite a few pretty and glamourous ladies who may have had a first failed marriage, but have gotten lucky a second time in love.\n\nFrom Shweta Tiwari and Shraddha Nigam to Rucha Gujarati and Ashwini Kalsekar, these leading ladies from the television world are examples of people who had a successful second marriage. We have compiled a list of 14 television actresses who got married a second time.\n\nRecommended Read: 6 Bollywood Celebrities Who Got Married Thrice\n\n#1. Shweta Tiwari\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nOne of the most adored bahus from the telly land, Shweta Tiwari can be termed as the finest example of what strong women look like. From a married woman and a survivor of an abusive relationship to a dignified single mother who mustered the courage to embrace marriage again, Shweta Tiwari’s personal journey has been one volcanic ride of sorts, but an inspiring one too.\n\nShweta was married to actor Raja Chaudhary from 1998-2007 with whom she has a daughter named Palak. When this pretty actress was married to Bhojpuri actor Raja Chaudhary, nothing seemed wrong with her personal life until Shweta decided to speak up against domestic violence and her decision to divorce Raja. Shweta was beaten, harassed and tortured by Raja either at home or at her shoots. Having gone through so much in the years that she was married to Raja, Shweta made up her mind to end her abusive marriage and move on.\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nAfter her divorce from Raja, Shweta found love in television actor, Abhinav Kohli. Shweta and Abhinav took things slowly. They dated for 3 years before tying the knot on July 13, 2013. Other than finding a very understanding soulmate in Abhinav Kohli, she also found a supportive and caring father for her daughter Palak.\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nThe couple welcomed a cute little baby boy on November 27, 2016 and named him Reyansh Kohli.\n\nAlso See: First Picture Of Shweta Tiwari's Newborn Baby Boy Will Bring A Smile On Your Face\n\n#2. Rucha Gujarathi\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nRucha Gujarathi, who became popular for her role in and TV’s Ganga also had an unsuccessful first marriage. She was first married to a Mumbai-based businessman named Mitul Sanghvi from October 2010 – April 2013.\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nJust like many of her peers like Shweta Tiwari and Deepshikha Nagpal from the television world, Rucha too, was a victim of physical violence and mental abuse by her ex-husband Mitul and in-laws. Some reports even suggested that Rucha was beaten on many occasions and at times, the torture was so extreme in nature that Rucha was deprived of food and even asked to pay for the family’s personal expenses.\n\nYou may like: Newlyweds Rucha Gujarathi And Her Husband Vishal Enjoying Their Honeymoon\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nAfter enduring an extremely abusive relationship and bitter marriage, the actress finally found love again in Vishal whom she met through a common friend. The couple got engaged in July 2016 and entered holy matrimony on December 12, 2016.\n\n#3. Shraddha Nigam\n\nShraddha Nigam was first married to Dil Mil Gaye actor, Karan Singh Grover from 2008 through 2009. It was widely reported that Shraddha and Karan’s 10-month-old marriage went kaput because of Karan’s philandering ways. With time, Shraddha bravely and gracefully moved on.\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nThe actress went on to marry actor Mayank Anand (who was also a part of Dil Mil Gaye) in 2012, and Karan Singh Grover meanwhile had a second marriage and third marriage with Jennifer Winget and Bipasha Basu respectively.\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nRecently, this Krishna Arjun actress came in news for her stunning transformation and her clothing line that she owns with her husband Mayank Anand. The couple launched Mayanak Ananad Shraddha Nigam, at the Lakme Fashion Week in 2011 and has been doing great.\n\nAlso See: TV Actress-Turned-Fashion Designer, Shraddha Nigam's Transformation Is Simply Outstanding\n\n#4. Chahatt Khanna\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nThis beautiful actress from Bade Acche Lagte Hain too was a victim of physical abuse and mental torture. Chahatt’s first husband was Bharat Narsinghani, a businessman whom she married in 2006. But, within seven months of marriage, Chahatt walked out because of constant mental abuse. After her first marriage ended, Chahatt was in a relationship with actor Kanana Malhotra, but unfortunately, it didn’t materialise.\n\nIn 2013, things started looking up for this pretty actress and she happily married Farhan Mirza, a businessman, in February. On September 9, 2016, Chahatt and Farhan became proud parents to a sweet little princess. They have named their bundle of joy, Zohar Mirza.\n\nSee Pic: 'Bade Achche Lagte Hain' Actress Chahatt Khanna Mirza Blessed With A Baby Girl\n\n#5. Sneha Wagh\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nSneha Wagh, who everyone remembers for her role in the serial Ek Veer Ki Ardaas...Veera also got married twice. Her first marriage to Avishkar Darvekar was a troublesome one. Several reports indicated that she was a victim of domestic violence.\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nAbout her first marriage and domestic violence, Sneha was quoted as saying:\n\n“Yes I did, and I didn't know how to deal with it. I was very young at that time. I was just 19. It was a proper domestic violence case. Frankly, I was never sure whether I should marry again. After 7 years, I somehow made up my mind that I should try settling into matrimony again. It was my sheer bad luck that I chose a wrong man again.”\n\nUnfortunately, Sneha’s second marriage to interior designer Anurag Solanki too ended after eight months.\n\nAbout her second failed marriage, she said:\n\n“Yes it didn't work out, and it didn't work out at all. I realised that I couldn't spend the rest of my life with him.”\n\nHaving gone through two failed marriages, Sneha categorically said she was neither open to love nor marriage.\n\nRecommended Read: Sneha Wagh Of 'Veera' Fame Opens Up About Her Two Failed Marriages\n\n#6. Deepshikha Nagpal\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nDeepshikha Nagpal was first married to fellow actor Jeet Upendra but divorced him in 2007. This was certainly not the end of the road for this pretty damsel as she once again found love in Bollywood and TV actor, Kaishav Arora. Deepshikha and Kaishav got married in 2012 and Kaishav happily accepted Deepshikha’s two kids from her previous marriage.\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nBut soon things started slipping away for this couple with Deepshikha filing FIR against Kaishav for threatening to kill her and her kids. And unfortunately, this love story too came to an end (for a short while though).\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nBut something unexpected happened. Despite the ugly and much public separation, Deepshikha and Kaishav decided to let bygones be bygones, and patched up! Yes, this happened.\n\nAbout the reconciliation, Deepshikha said:\n\n“When we met after eight months of separation, we wondered why we split in the first place. I cannot love anyone else than Kaishav; everything else ceases to matter when we are together. Now, we don't want to discuss our past anymore. For a successful marriage, one has to respect each other's space. I want to and have already started life afresh.\"\n\nShortly after this episode, the couple was even holidaying in Goa and looked happy as ever!\n\nMust See: Estranged Couple Deepshikha Nagpal And Kaishav Arora Are Holidaying In Goa\n\n#7. Dimpy Ganguly\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nPeople didn’t know who Dimpy Ganguly was until she took part in Imagine TV's Swayamvar reality show, Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and ended up marrying Rahul Mahajan, son of late BJP leader, Pramod Mahajan.\n\nRahul and Dimpy were married from 2010 till 2015. Dimpy too was allegedly a victim of domestic abuse. After a much publicised fight, the couple filed for divorce in 2014 and it was granted in 2015.\n\nDimpy’s life lit up once again as she bumped into her school friend Rohit Roy (who she secretly liked back in school) in Dubai. Sparks flew and the next thing Dimpy and Rohit knew was they wanted to get married. The couple tied the knot in November 27, 2015 and welcomed a baby girl on June 20, 2016. The little one is already one of the favourite star kids.\n\nMust Checkout: This Video Of Dimpy Ganguly's 6-Month Old Daughter Saying 'Baba' Will Make You Go Aww!\n\n#8. Archana Puran Singh\n\nImage Courtesy: Instagram\n\nMs. Breganza from Karan Johar’s Kuch Kuch Hota Hai second marriage to actor Parmeet Sethi is one fairytale of sorts. Archana had a failed marriage before she met Parmeet. After an unsuccessful first marriage, this Shriman Shrimati actress had lost her interest in men and took a vow that she will never marry anyone. She was quoted as saying:\n\n“After my previous failed marriage, I never wanted to have another man in my life. But with Parmeet, I realised that men can be gentle, loving and sensitive, and not all of them are violent and possessive. Parmeet is an absolute antithesis of a male chauvinist.”\n\nBut as clichéd as this may sound, fate definitely had better plans for her. Archana first met Parmeet at a common friend’s party and it was attraction at first sight for Parmeet, and for Archana, she was just intrigued by Parmeet.\n\nThe couple had a live-in relationship for 5 years before officially getting married. Though Archana is five years elder to Parmeet, but their trust, honesty and understanding in their relationship is spot on. Despite a stiff resistance from Parmeet’s family, the couple walked down the aisle on June 30, 1992, and has two sons, Aaryamann and Ayushmaan.\n\nYou may like: The Inspiring Journey Of Parmeet Sethi And Archana Puran Singh Will Make You Want To Fall In Love\n\n#9. Manini De\n\nThe vivacious Pari Kapadia from Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin was a single parent to a four-year-old little girl, Dainoor, when she married Dr. Rahul from Sanjivani in 2004. It was love at first sight for both Manini and Mihir Mishra at their common friend, late actor, Sanjit Bedi’s party and within a week, these two were married. Crazy, right?\n\nBut this actually happened! Mihir and Manini had a very unconventional wedding that took place at Mihir’s living room.
