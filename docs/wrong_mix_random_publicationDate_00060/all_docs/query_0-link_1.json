        "text": "Darcy Kigenza\n\nAshish Chadha and team were instrumental in us getting permanent residency. Before coming to Elite Overseas Immigration, we had tried (and failed) to complete the process ourselves. We were down on our luck, but Ashish made a stressful and complicated process a lot easier with his knowledge, guidance and understanding. Him and his team were easy to talk to, eager to help and professional throughout. Thank you Ashish & team! We will be recommending you to anyone who asks.\n\nNow Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nHarpreet Singh\n\n\"Big thanks to Elite Overseas, Ashish sir and the team. After 6 month of getting a work permit, I was still undecided on how to get started on my permanent resident application. Ashish sir guided me with the procedure, step by step and kept me updated through the whole process. Today, I am not only a permanent resident of Canada but I also have a reputed and well paid job.\"\n\nNow a Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nHoang Dieu Nguyen\n\nMy name is Hoang Dieu Nguyen, one of clients of Elite Overseas Immigration Consulting last year. I would like to thank Ashish Chadcha and his team. They worked professionally to help me obtain permanent residence quickly. Their attitudes to clients are friendly, respectful, and trustful.

He’s very good with the process and knows what he’s doing. I would highly recommend Elite Immigration/Ashish to everyone.\n\nNow Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nShashi & Shraddha\n\nWe would take this opportunity to thanks Mr. Ashish Chadha and Elite Overseas Immigration Service Team for their invaluable support and guidance from beginning to end.

Once again big thanks to Ashish and his team for the great service and wish them luck in the future.\n\nNow Permanent Residents of Canada\n\nRohit Michael Magima\n\nI would like to thank Ashish and his team for helping me with my application. It took a lot of patience, and Ashish's expertise helped ease through the long Permanent residency process. Ashish got back on time with my queries and was quick to check supporting documents. Every time I interacted with Ashish he was helpful and professional. This whole process took close to two years and I have only visited his office once. Booking appointments for phone and Skype conversations helped work around both our schedules. Thank you once again to the entire team of Elite Immigration Services!\n\nNow Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nSalma and Ameerusman\n\nWe take this opportunity to thank you Mr.Ashish and entire Elite Overseas team so deeply for our PR success. We are so fortunate that we did our filing through Elite Overseas. Our case was bit complicated and there was time we thought we will not be able to go through, but Ashish always gave us right advice and made every possible way to make our case success. He is always available and very prompt in replying emails, phone calls and text messages. Though I have met him only once during our entire case, we never felt any uncomfortable. He always treated us as a close family. We made our Canadian dream come true following his advices. We are 100% confident to refer him to anybody who needs help in their immigration.

You have helped me and my wife to become permanent resident of Canada and all the credit goes to you. Mr. Ashish is running the business with good attitude and advice we can trust on.

Once again, thank you very much for your help and services Elite Overseas Immigration Services!\n\nNow Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nCatherine Munisi\n\nI knew to get my permanent residency was not going to be easy as I began the process two years ago. Within those two years, I worked with the team for the first year without even meeting them face to face but the process was conducted soo smoothly through skype, emails, and phone calls. I read the testimonies and made the decision for them to be my consultant and I have never regretted. Best decision I made! Elite Immigration is very meticulous and they explained each and every step with a clear understanding of what is required from me and what they will get done. All documentation was sent for my review before they were submitted and followup was done promptly. I am very grateful for all the efforts they have done and most of all working past all the obstacles that came our way.\n\nNow Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nCorry Hall & Harley Bondini\n\nGetting Permanent Residency was an easy and stress free process with Ashish helping us. We were nervous to apply for Permanent Residency because we heard so many scary stories but the application went so smoothly thanks to Ashish and his team. Ashish made it very simple by telling us exactly what we needed to provide him with and communicating with the Canadian Government on our behalf. He was also able to get us a Bridging Visa so that we could continue to work throughout the process. He answered all of the questions that we had from the beginning to the very end. We are extremely thankful for the help and service that he provided to us!\n\nNow Permanent Residents of Canada\n\nLuke and Laila Ford\n\nAshish and the Elite Overseas team have been an absolute pleasure to work with on our work visas and permanent residency applications.

We would encourage anyone who needs immigration help to use Elite Overseas Immigration. Thanks for all your help.\n\nElite's client\n\nSujoy\n\nAshish Chadha has been helpful in my journey to become a Canadian Permanent Resident. He first helped me in getting me post grad work permit when all hopes were lost after rejection of post grad work permits in Vancouver from private university to getting the permanent residency in Canada. There were setbacks like my bridging work permit didn’t got through as I got my invitation after my expiration of work permit but that was a blessing in disguise cause by that time most of my paperwork was done and I was happy to go visit family at home and spend some time with them also travel a bit. Ashish suggested me to stay calm as we will go through and eventually we did.\n\nNow Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nNalin\n\nMr. Ashish has been a great support and guidance for me all throughout the PR process which took about 15 months, we would have hardly met 3-4 times in person and mostly we talked through emails. He gave me the right suggestions all throughout the process and was very proactive with all the emails. I am very happy to be a permanent resident of Canada today and I would like to thank Mr. Ashish Chadha and his team for bringing me here\n\nNow Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nNatasha, Gary, Khensani and Kharyssa Poyser\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude to Ashish and the Elite Immigration team.

To be honest, there were times I just wanted my case over and done with because of how complicated the system is, the rules keep changing (which is why I'm glad I didn't do this myself) but Ashish took his time to explain the process and my application didn't take as long as I thought it would. Most of our communication was through emails, we only met a few times but each process was smooth. My advice to anyone in the system or just starting out would be: Take your time, do your research, trust God and don't make your case bigger than it really is.\n\nNow Permanent Resident of Canada\n\nJocelyn Lao\n\nI got my Permanent Residency recently thanks to Ashish Chadha and his team.

I was misguided by another lawyer due to that I was bit confused about where to go and what to do, because I never wanted to take risk of applying on my own. So I came here at Elite Immigration office and had conversation with Mr. Chadha. He ensured me that I'll be guided properly through out the process. My work permit's validity was only for 5 more months and without giving a second thought I asked Mr. Chadha to start the process. And I'm so grateful to him for his service. Each and every time he was there to clear all the doubts and communication was never been a problem. He used to call back soon as the same day. His way of working is very organized and he always keep patience, focusing on the best results. He kept me updated with my application status. And another best thing was, he made payments easier. I was totally stress free, through out the process and I had firm belief that he will definitely make it to the end.
