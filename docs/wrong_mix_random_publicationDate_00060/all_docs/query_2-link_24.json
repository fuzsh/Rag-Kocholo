        "text": "Actor Karan Singh Grover finally broke his silence on his two failed marriages. He first married Shraddha Nigam and later got married to Jennifer Winget. Now, he is married to Bipasha Basu.\n\nNew Delhi: Karan Singh Grover had two failed marriages before he tied the knot with Bollywood actor Bipasha Basu. The couple also welcomed their daughter Devi in 2022. Now, after years of maintaining silence on his two divorces, first with Shraddha Nigam and second with Jennifer Winget, for the first time he opens up about the same. Scroll down to know what he he said!\n\nKaran Singh on his failed marriages\n\nIn the new interview, Karan was asked about his two failed marriages. He said that there’s “nothing good” about a divorce but when people move on, they realise that it “happened for the best”.\n\n“There’s nothing good about a breakup or a divorce. Yeah, later when people move on, they realize that it happened for the best. That’s a good thing. But I never felt the need to speak to anyone about the crap that’s happening in my life because I don’t expect people to come and talk to me about the crap that’s happening in their life. That is not my main motive. I would like to spread some love and joy. Everyone has their own s**t to deal with and I think everyone deserves that kind of privacy to handle their own s**t,” he told Times of India.\n\nHe also spoke about the transformation in his life after meeting Bipasha. He said, ” know myself today because of her. The change that has happened is so drastic. Like from being a nocturnal being to somebody waking up at 5 a.m. and wanting to see every sunrise and every sunset.”\n\nAbout Karan and Bipasha\n\nKaran met actor Bipasha Basu in 2015 on the sets of their film Alone and fell in love. They tied the knot on April 30, 2016 and welcomed their daughter Devi in 2022. Previously, Karan Singh Grover married Shraddha Nigam in 2008 and divorced after 10 months. Later, Karan married his Dill Mill Gayye co-star Jennifer Winget in 2012. The couple divorced in 2014."
