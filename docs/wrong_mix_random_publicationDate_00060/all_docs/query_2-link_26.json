        "text": "Shraddha and Karan were married for a year.\n\nAlthough the actress refuses to talk about the reason for the split, buzz is that Karan cheated on her. He was rumoured to be passionately involved with choreographer Nicole, whom he met on the reality show Jhalak Dikhla Jaa.\n\nShe says, “That is one thing I don’t want to talk about. When you are married, your lives are one. When you are not, toh ab kya bolna? Besides, the matter is subjudice.”\n\nApparently, she had moral support from her industry friends, Hussain and Tina Kuwajerwala, Juhi Parmar and Maninee De in her dark hour.\n\nWhen we tell Shraddha that Karan was spotted working out with Nicolle at a popular gym in Bandra a few days ago, she retorts, “What am I supposed to say about that?”\n\nShraddha Nigam\n\n&nbsp;Karan Grover\n\nShraddha, who had taken a sabbatical from acting and was content to play business manager to her husband, says that Karan did not stop her from acting. “Well, Karan didn’t stop me from facing the camera and I didn’t frequent his sets either,” she says curtly.\n\nShe talked about her plans to return to the small screen, saying, “I am toying with the idea of doing a chat show. I am also excited about another big project. I want to do a lot of work now.”\n\nAlthough the split has been bitter, the actress has not become wary of men. She does not rule out the possibility of falling in love with a guy from any fraternity, including the glamour industry. She emphatically says, “My marriage was an experience which should not have happened. I will not deny that the initial days were beautiful. But I have put it all behind me. At the end of every dark tunnel, there is light. I might fall in love again.”\n\nWe couldn’t help but ask her about gyrating with cricketer Sreesanth on New Year’s Eve in Goa, as reported on some channels. “I got married in Goa in 2008. That was the last time I went there and I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to go there again,” she shot back.\n\n• I am toying with the idea of doing a chat show. I am also excited about another big project —Shraddha Nigam"
