        "text": "Shloka Mehta\n\nShloka Mehta is an Indian entrepreneur who is married to Akash Ambani, the eldest child and chairperson of Reliance Industries and one of the world's wealthiest people. Mukesh Ambani is also one of the richest people in the world. The Indian city of Mumbai is the place of Shloka Mehta's birth. She hails from a prominent family of entrepreneurs. Her mum, Mona Mehta, is a stay-at-home mom, while her dad, Russell Mehta, is a managing director of the well-known diamond trading company Rosy Blue Diamonds. Diya Mehta is the name of her sister.\n\nShloka Mehta attended the Dhirubhai Ambani International School in Mumbai to further her schooling. She attended Princeton University in the United States to study Anthropology after completing her high school studies. She eventually went on to The London School of Economics & Political Science to earn a Master's degree in Law.\n\nAs a result of her professional development, Shloka co-founded Connect For. This online community links volunteers with NGOs as well as other social organizations to make it simpler for people to perform voluntary work. This project demonstrated her commitment to philanthropy and social problems. When Shloka Mehta's engagement to Akash Ambani came to light public in 2018, it attracted a lot of attention from the general public. Since their school days, the pair had known one another, and their romance eventually resulted in marriage. Numerous notable individuals from politics, business, as well as entertainment attended their lavish and beautiful wedding in March 2019.\n\nShloka Mehta joined one of India's most powerful corporate dynasties after marrying into the Ambani family. The Ambani family has a reputation for being active in a number of industries, including retail, petrochemicals, and telecoms. Shloka hasn't been as visible in the media or engaged in as many public events as some other high-profile people, but she still prioritizes philanthropy and social causes. She has participated in a number of charitable activities with her husband & the Ambani family.\n\nPersonal Life after Marriage\n\nOn a Friday, Akash Ambani & his wife, Shloka Mehta, announced the name of their baby.

On Friday, the couple shared the news on Instagram. \"Prithvi is thrilled to announce the birth of his little baby sister ? Veda Akash Ambani,\" the couple tweeted. \"With the grace of Lord Krishna and the blessings of Dhirubhai & Kokilaben Ambani,\" they added. A week ago, Shloka Mehta and Akash Ambani welcomed their second child. The couple gave Prithvi as the name of their first kid in December 2020.\n\nDhanraj Nathwani, the son of Rajya Sabha Member Parimal Nathwani and a close associate of the Ambani children, made the announcement of the baby girl's birth on Twitter. Best wishes go out to Akash & Shloka Ambani as they celebrate the joyful birth of their newborn princess! May this priceless blessing fill your lives with unimaginable joy and love,\" he had tweeted. Isha, Akash's twin sister, and her partner Anand Piramal welcomed twins Krishna & Aadiya into the world in November of the last year.\n\nThere are three kids who play important positions in Mukesh Ambani's company, which spans industries from telecom to retail. Isha is heavily engaged in the retail industry, Akash is in authority of the telecom division, while Anant is in command of the new energy sector.\n\nNet worth\n\nShe owns a lot of pricey bags. She is a style icon. She owes a Hermes bag for 34 lakh rupees. Hermes Mini Kelly Sellier Jaune Bourgogne Bag is the name of the bag. She also has a 4.5 lakh rupee Judith Leiber Boombox bag. It features many crystals of various colours. It has the appearance of a vintage 1980s music box. A Bentley Bentayga V8 is also owned by Shloka Mehta along with Akash Ambani. The vehicle costs Rs 4.10 crore. This car produces 542 horsepower from a four-litre V8 twin-turbo. The vehicle has an automated eight-speed gearbox.\n\nThey reside at Antilia, a 27-story structure with three helipads, an auditorium that seats 80, a parking space that can house 168 cars, and a number of other amenities. The structure is worth more than Rs 5000 crore. Additionally, Stoke Park, a luxurious home in Buckinghamshire, is owned by the Ambanis.
