        "text": "When two actors decide to embrace fashion, the results are stupendous. Been there but not done that, fashion always enticed this unlikely pair. Popular TV actors Mayank Anand and Shraddha Nigam turned to designing finally venting their creative volitions out. And from now on not wearing what others hang, stitch or throw on them! Sighs!\n\nMayank Anand and Shraddha Nigam love for fashion went berserk last year, and they finally turned to designing. Shraddha having studied fashion designing from Symbiosis International University, Pune, and Mayank being an innate free spirited artist, having pursued English Literature and Theatre Performance from Knox College, Galesburg in USA, found it the call of the moment, and here they just unleashed their inner creative horses.\n\nThe duo started their line with menswear as they realized there was a dearth of menswear in India and eventually started designing for women as well. Mayank does most of the sketching where Shraddha sniffs practicality of every garment. The label Mayank & Shraddha is all set to redefine versatility, creativity and strength by giving something innovative and pleasing every time they come out with their collection. Expressing them through the world of fashion, the duo find is soothing.\n\nThe trendy and contemporary designs by the duo, ranging from ethnic, to western, to resort, are simply new, with a reflection of Mayank and Shraddha’s interwoven personalities.\n\nYou can get Mayank & Shraddha’s designs at:"
