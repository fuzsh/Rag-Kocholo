        "text": "NameShraddha Nigam SexFemale Date of Birth01/10/1979 DayMonday Time of Birth12:00:00 Hour Istha14:15:32 Ghati CityIndore CountryIndia\n\nPlanetary Degrees and their Positions\n\nChalit and Niryan Bhava Chalit\n\nVimshottari Dasha\n\nBalance of Dasha :Mon 9 Years 3 Months 2 Days\n\nLagna Reading\n\nThe astrological configuration at the time of your birth was Scorpio Ascendant (Lagna) rising in the east with Pisces Navamsa and Cancer Dreskana in the fourth Pad of Jyestha, projecting you as a religious person given to visiting holy places but in actual fact it is only a facade, as in your heart of hearts you are very much a worldly person, aspiring to enjoy all earthly pleasures.\n\nYour outward appearance of a pious person yields rich dividends as your work will proceed smoothly, since others take you by your word. But in the event of difficulties cropping up, you will display courage and tenacity to overcome them and accomplish your goal of amassing wealth.\n\nAlways cheerful, you have a high sense of humour ( you can enjoy a joke on yourself!) sometimes even laughing away your business troubles. However, you are conscious of the hurdles you will have to clear.\n\nNo doubt you have a fascination for the opposite sex, but in this you are very choosy. The main thing you look for in your lover is not so much looks but intelligence. You enjoy the company of a person who can match you in IQ. So, while searching for a spouse you need to be extra-cautious, because if you happen to pick one who is attractive but dumb, you will feel miserable. Try and get a match from one born under the Scorpio, Cancer, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn signs.\n\nThere is one major area of constant concern for you in life. You aren't that fortunate on your health front as in other walks of life. You are prone to be hit by diseases in your 13th, 27th, 31st and 49th years. So strict vigil is needed on that score. It would serve you well to have medical examinations periodically so that you can take preventive steps against any illness. The diseases that are likely to affect you are damage to the secret parts, piles and irregular bowels movement.\n\nAs, in spite of your calm appearance your temper will be on edge most of the time, you will have to develop the habit of relaxing, to ward off any possible ill-effect on your nervous system.\n\nYour lucky days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday wheras Wednesday, Friday and Saturday are inauspicious.\n\nYou can depend upon numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9; avoid 5, 6 and 8.\n\nBlue, white and green are not for you. The colours that will prove beneficial to you are yellow, red, orange and cream.\n\nPlanet Reading\n\nSun\n\nSun in Virgo in the eleventh house is a favourable placement for acquisition of money. Those of you in government or working as doctors will do well financially.\n\nAlthough Virgo Ascendant indicates that you will get on better with your elder sisters, Sun in the eleventh house reverses this and you will share excellent relations with your elder brothers than your elder sisters.\n\nOther people like you because you are basically warm and affectionate. You will have many friends. They will be educated and businessmen. In society you mix with intelligent people, who are considerably older than you.\n\nMoon\n\nMoon in Capricorn in the 3rd house indicates that you are kind hearted.\n\nYour co-borns or cousins are faithful, obedient and generous. Each of you will forgive and forget the mistakes of others for the sake of family peace and harmony.\n\nYou have a deep attachment with music, songs, cinema and other forms of entertainment. You are attached to music and always have time to spare for it.\n\nMars\n\nMars in the 9th house indicates lack of fortune for you. You have to work very hard for your achievements as you are not a very fortunate native. You have to struggle throughout life due to your nature. Mars in debilitation, gives obstacles and opposition.\n\nYou cannot follow religious customs and family customs properly. You will perform worship only to get rid of worries but you do not have much faith in Pooja.\n\nThough Scorpio Lagna indicates long fruitful journeys, because of Mar's influence, though long journeys are indicated for financial and professional matters, these journeys will give you less money.\n\nMercury\n\nMercury in Virgo in the eleventh house indicates that because of your practical nature you will be able to fulfil your desires and aspirations. Those of you in the professions as a writer astrologer, commission agent or maths professor should find it beneficial.\n\nYou will have many acquaintances and friends. Your friends will be intelligent and educated and will include businessman.\n\nYou like to get around in the area where you live, and you try to be on friendly terms with everyone in your neighbourhood. As a result you will probably become well known in society. You will be fortunate enough to mix with the upper strata of society. These will be educated and intelligent people.\n\nJupiter\n\nYou are blessed with a golden touch provided by the positioning of Jupiter in Leo in the tenth house. Success is certain in almost everything you do. Learned, you will command public respect, more so because you are a religious person who will shirk doing any immoral deed. Backed by parental support, you can aspire to rise to a high position in your profession as you will secure government favour. You want to lead a non controversial life devoid of any disputes with anyone. But if others, jealous of your achievements, try to embroil you in legal tangles or litigations, you will mercilessly crush them. All in all, you are in for a good innings.\n\nVenus\n\nVenus in Virgo in the eleventh house indicates fulfillment of your desires and aspirations. Your chart indicates favours from women. Financial gains are indicated for those in the acting profession and those dealing in perfumes.\n\nYou like to do favours for the people you like, because this is one of the ways that you express love and friendship. Your friends will include ladies and businessman.\n\nIn society you will meet the upper strata of society. They will be extremely intelligent and learned people and by cultivating their friendship, you have everything to gain.\n\nSaturn\n\nUnfortunately for you, Saturn, located in Leo in the tenth house, tempts you to lead an immoral life, the result of which will be facing all sorts of difficulties and misery. If you display determination and set your face firmly against yielding to temptation, you can hope to occupy a fairly decent position in your profession and even gain fame by writing and occultism. Otherwise, you are bound to earn a bad name and either be suspended or sacked from service, plus, you may be forced to fight law suits whose outcome won't be to your advantage. It is also likely that you will fall out with your father and miss the chance of getting even an iota of ancestral property. The sum total of all these will be continuous mental agony and a despicable existence.\n\nRahu\n\nRahu, placed in Leo in the tenth house, promises a favourable trend for you. But successes and financial gains will come not at your native place but far away from it, maybe even abroad. If you display a spirit of adventure and take to long journeys, you will rise pretty high in your profession, as you have the ability to work hard. You have another advantage and that is your capacity to strike a good relationship with your superiors and those in authority, which will turn out to be very beneficial.\n\nOnly, unable to get on with your father, you may part company with him. That is the black spot in your life.\n\nKetu\n\nUnfortunately, however, with Ketu stationed in Aquarius in the fourth house, you may be fated to lead a life of continuous struggle, waging one battle after another for sheer survival. You may not receive the expected comforts from your mother and in your parental home you may not have a peaceful time due to family feuds among the elders.\n\nEither your ancestral property will be bogged down in controversies or in the event of your getting a share of it, you may be shocked to realise one fine day that you have lost it. Watch every step and work out each move with precision so that you can minimise your problems and lead a life of less tension.\n\nHouse Reading\n\nPhysique Health & Nature\n\nBorn under the Scorpio sign, you will be blessed with an impressive personality comprising a well knit, muscular body tending to stoutness, long arms and short, curly hair.

You don't believe in cutting into others path unnecessarily, as you are primarily interested only in your own affairs. But if others try to get funny with you, then you will make them repent their actions by stinging like a scorpion. You are quick, shrewd and a keen individual. You have a penetrative mind and incisive judgement regarding men and matters. What can serve you best in your pursuits is your strong, forceful mind which has the ability to take its own decisions without having to rely on others guidance. You have very strong likes and dislikes. If you favour anything you will back it to the very last. But if you are averse to something, then you will spare no effort to demolish it. You will be a very good friend to a true friend, but a dreadful adversary to a foe. Since you lay great stress on enjoying sex, your image may be sullied.\n\nYou are prone to disease like insomnia and somnambulism. So take due precautions.\n\nFinance, Family, Eye & Speech\n\nAt the time of your birth, Sagittarius sign was rising in the 2nd house.

It is only your father who can guide and educate her regarding running a modern household. If he does that, she will pick up fast and come up to your expectations.\n\nThe general indication provided by the birth sign is that the native may come to possess a share in the ancestral property, but may not derive benefit from it.
