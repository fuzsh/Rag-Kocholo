        "text": "Marriage and maintaining a marriage are two very different things. And for those who believed that one or two marriages was an adequate amount of experience, you can look at a few Bollywood celebs who have tied the knot three times or more.\n\nThese Bollywood celebs are the ones who have tied the knot three, sometimes even four times, instead of just twice!\n\n1. Kishore Kumar:\n\nIn 1950, the renowned vocalist got married to Ruma Guha Thakurta. Following the eight years of their marriage, in 1960, Kishore Da married the gorgeous Madhubala. Nine years into their union, Madhubala's tragic death brought an end to it. Yogeeta Bali, a fellow Bollywood actress, was Kishore Kumar's third wife; their brief union lasted only two years. Kishore Da fell in love with another young Bollywood starlet, Leena Chandavarkar, in 1980.\n\n2. Karan Singh Grover:\n\nShraddha Nigam, a television actress, was the first woman he married in 2008; they divorced after just ten months. Dill Mill Gayye co-star Jennifer Winget was the focus of Karan's second marriage. 2012 saw the two get married, and in 2014 they separated. Then, in April 2016, Karan tied the knot for the third time, this time with Bollywood's bong babe, Bipasha Basu.\n\n3. Sanjay Dutt:\n\nIn 1991, Sanjay Dutt married Richa Sharma for the first time; she passed away five years later from a brain tumor. The actor married model Rhea Pillai two years after her passing, but the two parted ways in 2005. Subsequently, he married Maanayata, his current spouse (back then, Dilnawaz Shaikh), whom he supposedly encountered at a Bollywood celebration.\n\n4. Neelima Azeem:\n\nNeelima Azeem, the mother of Shahid Kapoor, first tied the knot with Pankaj Kapur. Nevertheless, the couple filed for divorce three years after Shahid's birth and nine years into the marriage. Then, Neelima developed affection for Rajesh Khattar. The married pair shared eleven years of marriage. Ishaan Khattar, an actor, is raised by them. After that, she married Raza Ali Khan, and the two parted ways five years later for reasons that are only known to them."
