        "text": "Actor Karan Singh Grover is happily married to Bipasha Basu. However, in his latest interview, he took a moment to talk about his two divorces. The actor's first marriage with Shraddha Nigam ended in 2008, after which, he married Jennifer Winget. The two were only married for 10 months and had a difficult divorce. Karan now answered why he never spoke about his previous marriages in the media.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn an interview with the Bombay Times, the actor mentioned that divorces and breakups were so personal that he never felt it was necessary to talk about those decisions. KSG, as he is popularly called, said, \"There's nothing good about a breakup or a divorce. Yeah, later when people move on, they realize that it happened for the best. That's a good thing. But I never felt the need to speak to anyone about the crap that's happening in my life, because I don't expect people to come and talk to me about the crap that's happening in their life. That is not my main motive.\"\n\nHe went on to talk about the importance of guarding one's privacy. Karan highlighted that people are dealing with so much in their lives, and they can decide not to let the world know of their struggles. He added, \"I would like to spread some love and joy. Everyone has their own s**t to deal with, and I think everyone deserves that kind of privacy to handle their own s**t.\"\n\nKaran married Bipasha in April 2016. He complimented her for bringing a whirlwind of positive changes to his life. The actor mentioned that it is because of her he has found a new calling and become a better person today. KSG explained, \"All the heavy, all the negative, the lower vibration stuff just falls. I have another profession (painting) because of her. She helped me understand and connect with me. The real me. I know myself today because of her.\"\n\nKaran was recently seen in 'Fighter' alongside Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone in January this year. He received appreciation for his performance in the role of Sartaj Gill, a fighter pilot kidnapped and tortured by the Pakistani army."
