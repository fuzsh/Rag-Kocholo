She was motivated to pursue a career in singing after watching him sing.\n\nPandit Jasraj is her granduncle, father Vishwaraj Pandit is a tabla player, music composer Jatin-Lalit is her uncles and music composer Late Aadesh Srivastava was married to her aunt Vijayeta Pandit.\n\nShe has worked with many popular Indian musicians such as A. R. Rahman, Amit Trivedi, Salim–Sulaiman, Sonu Nigam, and Badshah. She has appeared in around a hundred concerts with Salim and Sulaiman.\n\nIn September 2013, Shraddha revealed that many music composers refused to give her work since she came from a family of well-known singers.\n\nHer fame increased when she sang Rang Deeni from the 2004 Bollywood film Dev. She sang alongside Kailash Kher in the song.\n\nIn 2008, she sang along with A. R. Rahman and Sukhwinder Singh in the song Mann Chandre Nu. For this, Rahman took a voice test of Pandit before allowing her to sing.\n\nHer 2015 song Pani Wala Dance was liked a lot by her fans and followers.\n\nIn 2018, after her sister Shweta made allegations of Anu Mallick sexually abusing her, Shraddha took to social media claiming that all working in the Hindi film industry know that he is a “predator.”\n\nIn 2019, she worked with her sister, Shweta Pandit, for the first in composing a song that was dedicated to bringing peace to Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nSome of her well-known songs include Aye Shivani from the film Khoobsurat (1999), Sasural Genda Phool from the film Delhi-6 (2009), Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) Jigar Da Tukda from the film Ladies vs Ricky Bahl (2011), and Aiyo Ji from the film Satyagraha (2013).\n\nShe has also sung a song for Salim-Sulaiman, which the duo had composed for a Hollywood film.\n\nAs a lyricist, she has written the lyrics of Date Kar Le (2020), Nawazishein (2022), and Biraj Mein Jhoom (2022).\n\nShe spends a considerable amount of time on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIn 2021, she filed an FIR against her former manager, Dev Thakur, accusing him of threatening her. The incident happened when Dev and Shraddha entered into an argument. Dev, however, refuted the allegation against him as false and baseless.\n\nOn 10 May 2022, Shraddha Pandit was appointed as the director of the Women’s Integrated And Synergistic Empowerment Association.\n\nShe once claimed despite making repeated requests, many renowned song promoters did not agree to promote her song I Got That Poison” (Hisss Remix). This was her debut as a composer.\n\nShe is an avid dog lover and owns a pet Shih Tzu named Muffin.\n\nShraddha Pandit was seen in the reality TV show Gusto With GD in 2023.
