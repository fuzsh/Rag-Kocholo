        "text": "Karan Singh Grover, who is married to Bipasha Basu, was previously married to television actors Jennifer Winget and Shraddha Nigam. The actor recently opened up for the first time about his past marriages and divorces acknowledging that ultimately, it \"happened for the best.\"\n\nKaran Singh Grover on his divorces\n\nWhen discussing his divorces, Karan told Times of India, “There's nothing good about a breakup or a divorce. Yeah, later when people move on, they realize that it happened for the best. That's a good thing. But I never felt the need to speak to anyone about the crap that's happening in my life because I don't expect people to come and talk to me about the crap that's happening in their life. That is not my main motive. I would like to spread some love and joy. Everyone has their own s**t to deal with and I think everyone deserves that kind of privacy to handle their own s**t.”\n\nKaran on Bipasha\n\nKaran also highlighted the profound impact Bipasha has had on his life, saying, “I know myself today because of her. The change that has happened is so drastic. Like from being a nocturnal being to somebody waking up at 5 a.m. and wanting to see every sunrise and every sunset.”\n\nKaran and Bipasha\n\nKaran and Bipasha's started dating in 2015 on the sets of the film ‘Alone,’ and they married on April 30, 2016. Their daughter Devi was born in November 2022. Before Bipasha, Karan was married twice; first to actress Shraddha Nigam in 2008, and later to actress Jennifer Winget, whom he met on the set of ‘Dill Mill Gayye.’ Their marriage ended in divorce after just 10 months.\n\nJennifer Winget on her divorce from Karan Singh Grover\n\nLast year in an interview with Bollywood Bubble, Jennifer Winget also spoke about her divorce with Karan and said, “I believe we were both unprepared. It wasn’t just him (Karan Singh Grover) or myself; we weren’t both ready to take that move. We had been friends for so long. We were like a house on fire every time we met. But I think it was an unfortunate timing I guess.”\n\nKaran was last seen in Hrithik Roshan, Deepika Padukone starrer ‘Fighter.’"
