        "text": "The report provides a snapshot of gender equality across all the 17 SDGs, providing evidence of how gender equality matters for each and every one of them. It presents global and regional averages for gender-specific indicators that can serve as baselines for future reporting and highlights the interlinkages between SDG 5 and other goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nBased on a review of the literature, this chapter analyses the various ways in which migration and education interact in the lives of girls and young women across Southeast Asia. It differentiates between the impact of parental migration on their daughters education and how girls’ and young women’s own involvement in labour migration affects their education. Depending on a range of factors, the chapter concludes that girls’ and young women’s migration may contribute to lengthening their participation in formal schooling, but may also lead to an early termination of it. The chapter also makes the case for conceptualising education more holistically. This allows recognising that for some girls and young women migration itself may be educational and a realistic pathway towards acquiring new sets of skills.\n\nThis last year has been full of turmoil regarding the #MeToo movement in the worlds of journalism, academia, literature, film, classical dance and music, corporate industry, the formal and informal sectors of the economy. Though the movement started in the industrialised world, it has had a cascading effect on all parts of the globe – developing nations, middle-income countries and rich nations. The year 2018 also marked a century of women’s suffrage for which the first generation of women’s rights activists had fought relentlessly, at the cost of great personal sacrifice in the face of tremendous patriarchal resistance. Though the suffragist movement began with a striving for adult franchise for women as a fundamental right of all citizens; it snowballed into a struggle for the rights of women as paid and unpaid workers. During the last century, in spite of sustained collective actions in several parts of the North and the South, discrimination against women in the world of work still persists due to caste/race/ethnicity/sexuality/gender-based segmentation in the economy. labour market and non-recognition of the unpaid care economy.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to observe how transformations across society, economy and politics, consequence of global capitalism, didn't help to overcome gender inequality but, on the contrary, have added stratification to the inequalities between women. In order to do so, this essay offers first a general overview of the literature and concepts related to the position of women within the global political economy. Following that, the processes of feminisation of migration and the changes in the provision of care will be analysed including examples from the experiences of women in Spain in relation to Latin American migration. The research will conclude that while the role of the woman is not only carer anymore but also income provider, men's workload has remained almost unchanged, as they have continued to fulfil their traditional role as [main] providers and keep playing a small-if any-part in the reproductive sphere. Institutions like global markets and governments have strongly contributed to the creation and permanence of the so called double-and sometimes triple-burden. Despite the socioeconomic progress that entering the formal labour force meant for women's empowerment, the consequences of such phenomenon have been not only perverse but also unequal among women of different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds."
