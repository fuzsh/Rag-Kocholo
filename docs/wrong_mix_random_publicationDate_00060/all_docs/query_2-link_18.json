But, the TV show Choodiyan was a breakthrough in her career.\n\nThe actress developed a good friendship with Karan Singh Grover while working in different tv shows and soon the two developed a close friendship. They started spending a lot of time together and entered into a relationship. In 2008, Karan and Shraddha surprised everyone by getting married.
