And the one person who must be feeling really sad with this development is Jennifer Winget, the ex-wife of KSG. But she is actually happy for the couple!\n\nBollywood’s latest couple Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover are all set to get married on April 30, 2016. And the one person who must be feeling really sad with this development is Jennifer Winget, the ex-wife of KSG. But she is actually happy for the couple! Jennifer and Karan starred together in the popular television show Dill Mill Gayye, but they were not a couple then. Karan was dating TV actress Shraddha Nigam and married her. But soon, the two were divorced and Karan found solace in his co-star Jennifer. But things turned sour between Karan and Jennifer as well, as their careers soared.\n\nKaran was soon in the arms of hot Bollywood babe Bipasha Basu, his co-star in the horror flick Alone. The two hit it off so well, that after denying the rumours of dating for long, they are now getting hitched to each other! The wedding will take place in Mumbai on April 30 this year.\n\nJennifer Winget, who had earlier remained mum on the wedding of her ex-husband, has now sent out good wishes to Karan and Bipasha. In an interview to HT, Jennifer said about the Bipasha Basu-Karan Singh Grover wedding, ” I wish them good luck, and a happy married life. I think they make an amazing couple. Marriage is a beautiful thing if two people work on it and want to be together. May God bless them. I feel love is an amazing thing, and if you can feel it for someone, it is great.”\n\nAbout her marriage to KSG, Jennifer told the daily, “It was an experience, and an amazing roller-coaster ride. There were some happy and sad moments. But I know that I gave my 500 percent (to my marriage), and no one can point a finger at me. I don’t regret a single day of my life. But, s**t happens. I don’t feel bitter or hold any grudges. I am in a happy space. People might think otherwise, but that’s not the case.”\n\nJennifer and Karan’s divorce papers were leaked in the media and she felt bad about it. “I was upset with the leaking of the divorce papers because my address and phone number were mentioned on them. I didn’t want such personal information to be circulated,” she said.\n\nAbout being single again, Jennifer said, “Every girl should be single at 30. It’s a liberating feeling to be free. Guys hit on me, and it feels good. They get intimidated by me, and I feel powerful. I feel people should have humour in their lives, as it makes it easy to handle any situation. At present, I don’t feel a lack of anything in my life.”\n\nWell, Jennifer Winget really seems to be in a happy space now! As for Karan Singh Grover, hope he gets third time lucky, with Bipasha Basu as his wife!\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.
