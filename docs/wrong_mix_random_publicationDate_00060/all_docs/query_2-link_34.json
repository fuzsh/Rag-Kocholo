        "text": "We combine timeless natural remedies with signature Aromatherapy blends to balance your body’s earth, wind, fire, water and ether. Our compositions are deemed ‘medicinal’ and free from sulphates, parabens, chemical additives, synthetic fragrances and artificial colors We consciously use the finest quality of herbs, botanicals, plant actives and pure essential oils in every product, which is then hand crafted, hand blended and packed. This is a family’s commitment to healing you with the best that nature can offer and impart positive lifestyle choices like mothers do.\n\nWebsite: www.maearthbotanicals.com\n\nWe believe that authentic wellness transcends the self. Fostering a seamless connection with one’s inner essence and the world that surrounds us - a serene voyage of mindful simplicity. Our purpose is to curate a repository of unique products & experiences that will help you transcend to this profound state of being.\n\nShunya’s philosophy is rooted in the profound wisdom of ancient India, where spirituality and holistic well-being are intertwined in the tapestry of life. Mentored by best-selling spiritual author Vinita Rashinkar, we are dedicated to crafting an extraordinary journey towards inner peace, balance, and transformation.\n\nWe seek to democratize the arts, create new audiences, and deepen engagement by providing a platform that gives equal access and opportunity to new learners, fresh voices and nascent minds in order to nurture future stakeholders for the creative community in India. To date, AVID has conducted over 1150 programs and connected with more than 140,000 individuals, a widely eclectic group of life-long learners including students, patrons, practitioners, influencers, thought leaders and cultural & creative enthusiasts in Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur, Bangalore, Goa and Gujarat. We have also made our mark internationally, with events and collaborations in Dubai and New York. We regularly collaborate and partner with institutions, organisations and initiatives like the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), one of the apex bodies that impact cultural policy and the creative sector as a whole.\n\nWe have been at the helm of programming at the Royal Opera House, Mumbai India’s only surviving Opera House since its reopening in 2016. We believe in the importance of arts for social change and we regularly offer our support and platforms for Social Advocacy. Thanks to a dedicated and innovative team, as well as a growing and evolving community of learners, AVID continues to give truth to the belief that Learning Never Stops! To keep updated and attend our events, like us on www.facebook.com/Avidlearning, follow us on www.twitter.com/Avidlearning and Instagram:@avidlearning or log onto www.avidlearning.in\n\nThe building was included on the 2012 World Monuments Watch to raise awareness about its history and significance, and support preservation efforts. The building has since been recognized with an Award of Merit in the 2017 UNESCO Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation. The restored facilities feature a 575-seater 3-level auditorium with an orchestra pit and state of the art technological upgradations, including acoustics, stagecraft, lighting and air-conditioning, alongside retaining the old world charm of the proscenium stage, the royal boxes and the magnificent regal chandeliers. Some more enhancements to the venue include a motorized screen, co-axial ceiling speaker system, Four-zone volume control and all round wifi access. Today, it stands as a key performance and creative hub in the city’s cultural landscape, while being a premier heritage landmark.\n\nFacebook: MumbaiOpera\n\nTwitter: @MumbaiOpera\n\nInstagram: @mumbaiopera\n\nWe source our offerings from all over India, which is why our collection has the very best of what the old world has to offer. Our intention is to share the diversity and richness of Indian culture and ancestry.At Circa, each piece is unique, has its own story, and is steeped in heritage. It is our honour to breathe life back into these pieces and share them with you.\n\nAt MA:AI, we are passionate about honouring the region of each project by designing spaces that are cohesive with the architectural language of the area. The intention is to create magical spaces through visual art and repurposed architectural elements. These components and their unconventional use encourage people that use the space to reimagine the use of daily objects and their interactions with them, thus creating room for an engaging dialogue that asks them to look beyond what is familiar."
