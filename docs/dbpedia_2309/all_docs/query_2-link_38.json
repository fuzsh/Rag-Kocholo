        "text": "In this article, we give you a brief overview of what our Gurus emphasize on so our students learn the fundamentals correctly and effectively and also enjoy the lessons.\n\nIndian Carnatic music or Karnataka Sangitam is very interesting and very systematically arranged. It is also full of creativity and imagination. With a solid understanding of the fundamentals and constant practice, you will be able to understand and appreciate melodies and enjoy performances. These raagas are also known to put listeners very meditative and reflective mindset and also soothes your soul. With that, lets look into what students typically learn.\n\nIn the first few weeks, Guru’s focus on the fundamental. Fundamentals include the Sarale Varase (Sarali varusalu), Janti Varase (Janta Varusalu), Taggusthayi Varase, Dhaatu Varase, Taarasthaayi Varase, and Alankaara.\n\nFor a beginner, one of the very first lessons that a Guru teaches is Sruti. Sruti plays an integral role in the music. This is considered as the ‘key’ in western music. Eventually, Sruti is known as the soul of Carnatic music. One of the very first forms of Carnatic music is the Saralivarisai. This is also known as the exercise that makes people extremely familiar with the Swaras and the Sruti.\n\nThis assists in learning various combinations of the Swaras that are possible. Then it comes to the Jantavarisai which is the next level of Saralivarisai. In this specific exercise, you are going to be trained properly on how to sing with Sruti and what is the major way of handling the Swara correctly. After that, the Guru teaches Swarajathi. It is known as the whole combination of Swaras and songs.\n\nThe Guru helps students to learn the basic exercise, which needs to be practiced to get the raga correctly. After that, it comes to Varnams that is mainly a special item that emphasizes the importance of different ragas. In the first few lessons, the Guru also teaches the students the way on how to stress and approach a certain note. Often Varnams are sung first in any concert as it attracts the attention of the audience.\n\nIn Carnatic music, one needs to learn Kirthana (Krithi). It is also one of the first lessons that you will have to learn. It is normally a song that is composed with the help of Swaras and ragas. This contains Pallavi, Anupallavi, and Charanam which are sung in the given same order. Pallavi and Anupallavi are mainly two lines whereas Charanam has more lines and stresses on a certain purpose of the song i. e. the tala and the raga.\n\nEach and every basic level or lesson is mainly designed to make the singers the actual combination of Swaras as in the Saralivarase, stress and repeat Swaras as in Jantivarase. It also traverses to higher octave as in Taarasthaayi Varase, traverse to lower octave as in Taggusthaayi varase. Practicing the Swara continuously daily would help a singer to learn the basic lessons properly.\n\nPractice is extremely important – especially for beginners to Carnatic music — it is is like prepping your body for an intense workout. The basic lessons are mainly designed to prep the voice for singers. Not only the singers but the lessons are also helpful for the instrumentalists who love to play Carnatic Violin and Carnatic Flute also. These lessons help them to understand the Swaras and Swara sthaana (exact variations of Swaras).\n\nGurus strongly recommend that you practice for atleast 20-30 minutes every day so you will feel more confident and prepared for subsequent lessons. The Guru can then help you build on what you have already learnt.\n\nRegular practice of these basic lessons will assist a student to:\n\nSet the voice range correctly\n\nGet a good grip on the tempo of the music when practiced at various speeds\n\nEnhance the ability to traverse Swaras through plenty octaves with ease\n\nEmpower to handle various tempos and speeds in different octaves, while maintaining the Laya\n\nAcquire the ultimate ability to sustain on a single Swara for a longer duration and linger around Swara without fatigue\n\nYou never should skip practicing the Swara to get the grip of Carnatic music. Although, it is advisable for practicing all these lessons in ragas like Shankarabharana, Kalyani, Kharaharapriya, etc to make acquainted oneself with the ragas and its Swaras."
