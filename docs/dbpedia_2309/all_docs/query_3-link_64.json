        "text": "Carnatic music learners tend to possess improved and sharp brain functions, such as hearing, memory, etc. the effects of which are enduring and protect the brain from the depredations of aging. The learning helps dedicated students develop a keen sense of listening, internalize, introspect, and execute tasks with utmost precision.\n\nMemory plays an extremely important role in learning parts of pre-composed and improvised Carnatic music. Around 1000 compositions are expected to be committed to memory especially if you are a good or professional musician. An intrinsic knowledge of more than 200 ragas along with their movements and scales is imperative to anyone learning Carnatic music. Good memory is a prerequisite to learning Carnatic music.\n\nMelody and rhythm play an equanimous role in Carnatic music. The integrity of these two elements is extremely important for performance. These must be well-nurtured and developed to progress in the skill.\n\nWhen learning compositions, you should also be able to visualize and internalize the notes and their positions across a rhythmic structure. The same applies if you are trying to improvise on an existing plate, which is known as Kalpana swaras where solfa syllables are used for improvisation. These modifications could be simple or advanced in concepts often erupting in the form of mathematical patterns, thus giving the whole presentation a cerebral tone. It should come as no surprise when a Carnatic musician cooks up formulae in the mind instantly and may even score well in mathematics.\n\nImproving kelvi gyanam or your reasoning abilities, the practice of learning from your Guru or master involves keen listening, for a serious Carnatic learner. Nuances across pitch, melody, gamakas or oscillations and tempo, must be differentiated with precision.\n\nFurthermore, the musician should also be able to distinguish between Ragas, which is the crux of Carnatic music. This means the learner must develop a perception of calibrating the aesthetics and identify tiny shades of variations between sounds. Carnatic music practiced over several years, develops the learnersâ€™ auditory skills are highly developed and even benefits when hearing difficulties arise in old age.\n\nProviding abundant scope for self-expression and creativity, Carnatic music intrinsically allows the vocalist (and even the instrumentalist) to express themselves fully in a piece that might have been rendered a thousand times before. Creativity makes room for different accents and styles thus providing learners avenues to produce unique pieces of their own. As a result, the singer develops a personality that is vibrant, and dynamic and possesses intense knowledge accumulated across years of dedicated learning. Carnatic music provides learners innumerable opportunities to express themselves.\n\nAt the Raaga School of Music, our students learn through in-person and live online with highly respected teachers with a very rich musical lineage."
