        "text": "Indian Classical Music\n\nIndian classical music is of two kinds: Carnatic and Hindustani classical.\n\nClassical music in northern India was influenced by Arabic and Persian practices after Islamic invasions in the 12th century. That is how the Hindustani variant originated. While the music in the Southern belt was unaffected.\n\nCarnatic Music is South Indian classical music the origin of which dates back to 500 BC.\n\nThe development of the South Indian Carnatic classical music as we know it today is credited to Purandara Dasa and the trinity of music composers, Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Syama Sastri.\n\nMy Grapple With Classical Music in Childhood and Pandemic-Induced Newfound Interest in It\n\nEven though I studied Carnatic music for years, I did not really learn anything. Wonder why?\n\nThe reason is partly petulance, partly practical and partly personal. I will talk about the first two here.\n\nI learned Carnatic music during the weekend like a child who would learn poetry by heart without knowing any technicalities or meaning. So, to be honest, I did not like it very much.\n\nFor an average kid like me, learning different swaras (musical notes), and varisai (musical sequences) with their respective talas felt tedious and herculean.\n\nAs any kid, I just wanted to proceed to the next level with every class which was impossible considering my lack of interest in actually practising it (and I wanted to go out and play with other kids).\n\nMy music teacher talked about shruti (pitch), tala (the rhythmic pattern) and ragas (the framework of musical notes). Though I understood shruti and tala, I did not quite understand what ragas meant then, until I figured it out by myself after several years. I did not know vocal techniques or anything of that sort.\n\nSo, it piqued my interest when I learned for the first time about these things through VoxGuru, a YouTube channel that talks comprehensively about Indian classical music, during the pandemic.\n\nThat channel's creator has a very different method from my music teacher.\n\nSo, this time Carnatic music intrigued me. Not because I wanted to learn it but because of how meditative and therapeutic it felt.\n\nI have heard legends about how great musicians made rain just by singing in a particular raga. Carnatic music is said to have many magical effects.\n\nFor example, the raga Meghmalhar was supposedly used to evoke rain.\n\nAfter I decided to watch these YouTube videos, I was thrilled by the effect they had on my mental health and overall lifestyle. Post-pandemic, what really kept me going was listening to Carnatic music.\n\nMeditation never really worked for me. But for the past year I have been starting my days listening to and singing Carnatic music (I donâ€™t claim to be a singer, that would be blasphemyðŸ˜‰).\n\nThe Positive Impact of Carnatic Music\n\nI have noticed a lot of positive changes in me since I consistently started doing this.\n\n1. It Made My Mind Active\n\nJust like I do morning exercises to make my body active, listening to Carnatic music refreshes my mind.\n\nI feel immediately energized after this.\n\n2. It Improved My Productivity Double-Fold\n\nThis is the most favourable outcome thus far.\n\nAs a result of feeling refreshed in my mind and body, I could engage in other productive activities, like writing without feeling down or lethargic.\n\n3. It Enhanced My Concentration\n\nIf you have ever tried learning Carnatic music, you would know that it is no easy task.\n\nIt has so many patterns, and talas and you need to always get the swarasthanas (the musical notes and their positions) right.\n\nUnlike in Western classical music, the notes are sung out loud which requires extreme focus and concentration which in turn improves it in other areas as well.\n\n4. I Became Self-Disciplined\n\nStarting my day with Carnatic music enabled me to have a disciplined routine.\n\nIt really calms me down to engage in other activities.\n\n5. Improved Sleep Quality\n\nI have found considerable improvement in my sleep quality after I made listening to Carnatic music a habit.\n\n6. I Feel Much Happier and Content\n\nI have already talked about ragas, havenâ€™t I?\n\nThe thing with ragas is that each of them has a different impact on our minds.\n\nFor example, the raga Abheri evokes a sense of nostalgia and the raga Mohanam evokes calm and happiness.\n\nHere is a playlist of popular songs composed in Abheri raga:\n\nMy Favourite Thing â€” The Ragas\n\nMost of the Indian popular music that you hear is composed in different ragas.\n\nSo, a song evokes a particular kind of mood in its listeners.\n\nMy favourite ragas are Mohanam, Hamsadhvani and Abheri â€” I love them because the major mood that these ragas evoke is happiness. I feel elated after listening to any song composed in these ragas.\n\nHere are some ragas and their particular moods:\n\nBrindavana Saranga â€” Romance, love\n\nSahana â€” Compassion\n\nMohana â€” Joy\n\nNeelambari â€” This raga helps in sleep. Mostly used to compose lullabies.\n\nBehag â€” Love\n\nHere is a song composed by the Academy Award-winning composer A.R Rahman in Behag Raga.\n\nWhy Carnatic Music?\n\nNow you must be wondering, is it necessary that it must be Carnatic music and nothing else? After all, as Shakespeare said;\n\nIf music be the food of love play on\n\nYes.\n\nMusic in any form relinquishes our soul. As I said earlier, Indian classical music is special because each tune evokes a particular emotion in the listeners.\n\nI chose Carnatic music because I am South Indian. Someone else from maybe the Northern part of India might feel the same things about Hindustani Music.\n\nCarnatic music has proven scientific benefits too. Some ragas are said to have healing properties and are used for the treatment of ailments.\n\nEach individual has a distinct approach to mindful living. Some people find their comfort in journaling. Some others get it through meditation or yoga. Mine just happens to be Carnatic Music.\n\nThatâ€™s all.\n\nAnd I cannot explain the way I feel after a session. It is heavenly."
