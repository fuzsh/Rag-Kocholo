        "text": "THANJAVUR: The One remains, the Many dance and pass. Three dancers, in three aeons were born; Kailasam, Vaikuntam and Bhoolokam, did they adorn. The first in loftiness of thought surpassed; the next in majesty of execution, in both the last. The force of Nature could no further go, to make a third. She joined the former two. Yes. Dr Padma Subrahmanyam has the joint qualities of Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna, the king of natya and the prince of nardhana.\n\nDr Padma’s presentation, ‘Rajarajeswaram 1000’ at the Thanjavur Big Temple on Saturday was a unique example in this sense and more. If abhinaya (gesture) is manifest in angika (bodily gesture), vachika (verbal representation), aharya (ornamentation) and satvika (depiction of states of mind), Dr Padma and her troupe successfully stood the test.\n\nThe kavuthuvam is a dance form which originated in South Indian temple rituals. It is in praise of different deities, particularly Lord Ganapathi. This piece as rendered by Dr Padma and others marked a traditional commencement of the masterpiece presented in the other two items later.\n\nThe Karur Thevar Thiruvisaippa verses (Thanjai Rajarajeswaram) (Pann Panchamam) (Ulagellam thozha vandhezhu kadhiparidhiyondru noorayira kodi) were sung 1000 years ago during the first consecration of the temple. The sannidhi of Karur Thevar is situated behind the main shrine. This item was again a remarkable selection."
