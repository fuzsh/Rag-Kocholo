        "text": "Of the seven Shiva Shrines of the Kongu region, Karur Pasupatheeswarar is considered first and foremost. Emperor Musukunda, belonging to the Skanda Mahapurana period is believed to have undertaken renovation of the temple. According to the history of the place, Emperor Musukunda was extended an invitation to attend the wedding of Lord Muruga that took place in Tiruparankundram near Madurai.\n\nKarur has the reputation that Siddha Karuvurar lived here. He has praised the Lord in his Thiruvisaippa hymns. As Karuvurar dissolved himself with the Lord, the Linga is found in a slanting position. Saint Thirugnanasambandar had also praised the Lord in his Thevaram. So Arunagiriyar His favourite deity Muruga in the temple.\n\nKarur also was the place of residence of Eripathanayanar, Pugazh Chola Nayanar . On 14, 15 and 16th of Panguni Tamil month (March-April) Sun rays fall on the shrine.\n\nHistory:\n\nLord Brahmma became very proud as He is the creator of the world. With a view to teach him a lesson, Lord Shiva brought the divine cow Kamadenu. The divine cow also came to earth and performed penance here which was then a forest of Vanji trees. Kamadenu heard a sound from the sky directing it to worship an Adhi Linga hidden in an ant hill (puttru). The cow followed the order meticulously by pouring the milk on the ant hill but one day its feet touched the Lord. The cow apologized to the Lord for its careless behaviour causing bleeding on the Shivalinga. The Lord appeared before the cow and said that he would be worshipped as Pasupatheeaswara and the Kamadenu would be in charge of creation of the world. Kamadenu undertook the assignment and performed the job with all humily. At a later stage, Lord Pasupatheeswara restored the job to Brahmma himself and took Kamadenu to his Abode.\n\nSpeciality:\n\nThe Shivalinga – Anilayappar – is a swayambu that exists of its own. Lord Brahmma worshipped Anilayappar as one in the Ant hill (Puttru in Tamil). Kamadenu (divine cow) worshippped the Lord here. During the worship, the feet of Kamadenu touched the Lord’s head, the symbol of which is still on the Linga.\n\nPrayer:\n\nThe devotee surrendering at the feet of Lord Anilayappar is blessed with a complete peace of mind. Those awaiting a marriage and longing for a progeny, in need of employment opportunity, development in business, promotion in job visit the temple and worship Anilayappar. It is the staunch belief of the devotees that the Lord would never fail his Bhaktas.\n\nPrayer commitments:\n\nAbishek is offered in oil, milk, curd tender coconut to the Lord and the Goddess. People also offer Mangalsutra and jewels to the Goddess. Dhoti and Sari are offered. Feeding the visitors ( Annadhanam) is also followed by the rich.\n\nGeneral Information:\n\nKarur is 100 kms far from Salem, 76 from Trichy, 113 from Coimbatore and 144 from Madurai. The temple administration authorities can be contacted on phone No. 04324 – 262010.\n\nComfortable lodging facilities are available in Karur, the charges ranging from Rs. 200 to Rs. 500. As the temple is situated in the heart of Karur Town, conveyance facilities also available in short frequencies.. Nearest railway station is Karur and airport Trichy.\n\nThis is one among the Eternal Location (Vinnulaga thirupathi), where one can’t reach there with the human body, and only our soul (Atma) can reach there. This Tirupathi can’t be viewed through our ordinary eyes. However, the seers, Rishis and Muni’s of yore, with an insight and power of Penance, they could visualize this Eternal Location with their power of Telepathy and Njana Drushti.\n\nThis Thiru Paarkadal Divyadesam doesn’t exists in this mighty earth. Because of this, along with out human body, we cant able to see this sthala perumal. It is situated trillions & trillions of light years from the Earth, crossing the sky and above it, the Lord God perumal is on the Serpent known as Aadhisesha in Bhujanga Sayana and facing along the South direction which is said to be watching the activities of Yama dharma.\n\nAll Devar are said to be persons where shadow doesn’t fall and their feet doesn’t touch the land. Likewise, the perumal in Paarkadal is watching all of the activities of all Aathmas and depending upon their pava (sin) and Punya (good) activities, he decides on the final Mukthi.\n\nThe Lord God resides in all living creatures and even in atom. Lord God Emperumaan separates as Sri Vasudeva, Sangarshana, Prathyumnan and Anirudha. Sri Vasudevan is capable of giving Njana, Sakthi, Tejas and is said to have the qualities (amsam) of Sriman Narayanan. Sangarshanan is said to be having the great qualities like Sakthi and Gnana and is said to be the amsam of Lord Shiva. Prathyumnan is said to be the amsam of Lord Brahma Deva and is a great Gjana person. Anirudh is said to be the amsam of Parasakthi and Lakshmi piratti and has the inbuilt qualities like richness, Gnana and Sakthi.\n\nSri Vasudeva in equivalent to Kesava, Madhava and Narayana. Sangarshan is equivalent to Govinda, Vishnu and Madhusoodhan. Prathyumnan is equivalent to Thiruvikrama, Vaamana and Sridhara. Anirudhan is equivalent to Rishikesa, Padmanabha and Damodhara.\n\nThese all 12 are referred to as 12 Sooryas and chandras who are along in all 12 directions (sides) there by making all Jeevathmas to emerge, lead their life, calculating their Pava and Punya known as Sins & good deeds.\n\n“Om Namo Nrayana”, the Ashtakshara Manthra is surrounded all over this divyadesam and by chanting this mantra, we too reach the Thiruppaarkadal Nathan of this divyadesam.\n\nSpecials:\n\nThis Thirupaarkadal divyadesam doesn’t exists in this mighty earth. Because of this, along with out human body, one can’t see this sthala perumal. It is said to be situated trillions of light years away from the Earth.\n\nMoolavar:\n\nThe Moolavar of this divyadesam is Sri Ksheerapthi Nathan. Also named as “Thiruppaarkadal Nathan”. He is on the Aadhiseshan in sleeping posture known as Sayana – Kidantha thirukkolam facing his South direction. Prathyaksham for Brahma deva, Rudra (Lord Shiva) and all other Devas and Rishis.\n\nThayaar:\n\nThere are two Thaayars namely Kadal Magal Naachiyaar and Sri Devi thaayar.\n\nMangalasasanam:\n\nPeriyalwar – 5 Paasurams\n\nAndal – 3 Paasurams\n\nKulasekara alwar – 2 Paasurams\n\nThirumazhisaialwar – 13 Paasurams\n\nThondaradippodialwar – 1 Paasurams\n\nThirumangai alwar – 10 Paasurams\n\nPoigai alwar – 1 Paasuram\n\nBhoodathalwar – 2 Paasurams\n\nPei alwar – 4 paasurams\n\nNammalwar – 9 Paasurams\n\nTotal – 50 Paasurams.\n\nPushkarani:\n\nThirupPaarkadal.\n\nAmirtha theertham.\n\nVimanam:\n\nAshtanga Vimaanam.\n\nThis temple lies in the Tanjore district of TamilNadu. It’s about 6 miles from Thirunaangur. If taken the route of Keezh salai from Thirunaangur its about 3 1/2 miles. No arrangements for staying are furnished.\n\nSpecials:\n\n1. Though Thiruvaali (Thiruvazhi) and Thirunagari are about 3 miles away from each other, these two are considered as a Single Divyadesam only.\n\n2. We can worship first Thirunagari, then Thiruvaali, Thirudevanar Thogai and finally Thiruvellakkulam at one streach.\n\nThirunagari\n\nMoolavar:\n\nThe Moolavar found in this sthalam is Sri Devarajan. Also known as Vayalaali Manavalan. Irundha (Sitting) Thirukkolam facing his thirumugham towards west direction.\n\nThayaar:\n\nThe Thaayar of this sthalam is Amurdha Valli.\n\nUtsavar:\n\nThe Utsavar found in this sthalam is Kalyana Ranganathan.\n\nMangalasasanam:\n\nBoth the places are considered as one kshetram and so has gained 42 Paasurams by Kulasekara alwar and Thirumangai alwar. Also Manavala Maamunigal has visited this place many times.\n\nPushkarani:\n\nIlaakshani Pushkarani.\n\nVimanam:\n\nAshtakshara Vimaanam.\n\nThiruvaali\n\nAbout the Temple:\n\nThis temple lies in the Tanjore district of TamilNadu. It’s about 6 miles from Thirunaangur. If taken the route of Keezh salai from Thirunaangur its about 3 1/2 miles. No arrangements for staying are furnished.\n\nSthalapuranam:\n\nThiruvaali and Thirunagari are both within 3 miles from each other are realted to the history of Thirumangai Alwar.\n\nThirumangai alwar was born on Thirukurayalur near Thirunagari. His orinigal name was “Neelan” and was the Army chief (Padai Thalapathi) of the Chola Kingdom. He was well versed in Tamil and Sanskrit.\n\nAs a reward for his valor, the chola king made Neelan the king of “Aali nadu” a small state whose capital was “Thirumangai”.\n\nSumangalai was the head of the young ladies of heaven (Deva Kanni) who were involved in the job of fanning the lord using the “Samaram”. Once while saint Kabila was preeching the qualities of Lord Narayana, Sumangali distracted him by making an odd remark of his ugly students. So he cursed to go to earth and take birth.\n\nAs a curse, she born on this earth on a lilly flower and was named as “Kumudhavalli”.\n\nThirumangai Mannan wanted to marry her, but she ordered him to become a Srivaishnavan – a staunch follower of Vaishnavam.\n\nHe headed straight to Thirunarayur and asked the Lord to be his Guru and transform him into a pure Vaishnavity.\n\nBut Kumudavalli placed another condition for marriage. She ordered him to give food for 1008 Brahmins daily and fill his stomach by accepting the remaining food kept by the Brahmins and drink the water used to wash their lotus feets.\n\nThirumangai Mannan accepted her terms and married her happily. His extreme love for his wife, brought him into a delicate position of finding enormous money need for the second condition. He even used the many intended to pay the revenue to the chola king.\n\nThe king ordered him to pay the revenue, but Thirumangai Mannan was unable to repay it and so he was put in jail. He spent 3 days in the jail without eating food for he took a vow of eating food only after giving food to the Brahmins.\n\nVaradharaja perumal of Kanchipuram, came into his dreams and asked him to come to the Vegavathi river bank to collect the required money.\n\nSo along with many Ministers, he came to Kanchi under a tight security and amazingly he found the required money.\n\nBut, as the day passed on, he spent all the money he had and was not sufficient to spend. He had no money for the further expenses, so he made up his mind to rob money from rich people.\n\nOnce Lord Narayana and Periya Piratti passed along the forest where Thirumangai Alwar was waiting for some rich persons to pass on and so that he could steal money and ornaments from them to serve the Brahmins. Sriman Narayanan and Periya Piratti were dressed as a newly married couples. While they were passing, all people around them sang lots of marriage related songs and on hearing this, Thirumangai Mannan was so happy that he could get lots of ornaments from them. He stopped them and asked for all of their belongings and while the conversation between them was going on, he took away all of their jewles from the marriage party but could not get the precious ring of the Groom. Finally he took the ring by bitting the Groom’s finger.\n\nAfter that he gathered all the things and asked his servents to lift. But the parcel was too heavy even to Thirumangai alwar. He scolded the groom in suscipion of Chanting Manthra against him. The groom asked alwar to come near him to know the Manthra he chanted and he preeched alwar the most powerful “Ashtaksara Mandiram – Om Namo Narayanaya”. And gave dharsan to him in his original form and gave him the title “Nam Kaliyan”, Nam – Our, Kaliyan – Thief.\n\nAfter that Alwar became a true addict – devotee to Lord Narayana and totally Mangalsasasanamed 84 Divydesams with thousand two hundred and twenty three paasurams.\n\nHe did many great things during his life time. He even built the compund wall of Sri Rangam temple and brought Nammalwar from his isolation to Sri Rangam for a discourse.\n\nThirumangai alwar has got two specialities:\n\nHe is the only alwar, who takes all the honours along with his beloved wife Kumudhavalli.\n\nThe terms Nammalwar was rendered to Nammalwar by his devotee Madurakavi alwar, who considered Nammalwar as equivalent to God. i.e The term Nam – our was given to him by his followers.\n\nBut the title “Namkaliyan” was revarded to Thirumangai alwar by the lord god itself. ie he was so near to god and the Lord proved it by accepting the self – Praising terms of Alwar in paasurams as the terms praising Lord Narayana.\n\nTouching and performing pooja to the lord by the devotees itself is a North Indian practice. He brought this concept to South India by higging the idol of Lakshmi Narashima at Thiruvaali. The name Thiruvaali too came for that reason only for Thiruvaali = Thiru + Aali. Aali is the term equivalent to Alinganam ie hugging as Alwar hugged the Lord at that place, it was named Thiruvaali\n\nAlso the name “Vayalaali Manavalan” too has a special meaning. Vayal means fields. Thirumangai alwar made the pure soles of all the devotees as fields which cultivates Bhakti without any weeds.\n\nVayalaali means the owner of such Bhakti cultivating lands ie Thirumangai alwar.\n\nAs alwar hugged Lord Lakshmi Narashima, he gained the name “Vayalaai Manavalan” (Manavalan means one who is sweet to the hears).\n\nThirumangai Alwar worshipped five Narashimaars idols througout his life. Out of that 2 of the Narashimars and one small Utsavar idol of ‘Lord Senthaiku eniyan’ are presented at Thirunagai even today.\n\nAt Thirunagari, alwar poses a hunter involved in robbery. It’s been said that at Devarajapuram half mile away from Thirunagar, only Alwar robbed Lord Narayana. Today as a token of rememberence a function “Vedupari Utsavam” is conducted on the Panguni uthiram day.\n\nAs the Lord posed as groom and bride, the Utsavar perumal at Thirunagari is named as Kalyana Ranganathan (Kalyanam – Marriage), and Moolavar devarajan and Vayalaali Manavalan. The vimaanam is named Ashtaksara vimaanam for this Mandiram only changed alwars life course.\n\nThirumangai alwar attained mukthi at Thirukurunkudi of Pandya Kingdom. While Thirumangai Alwar’s idol is taken out for procession he is armed with a diamond studded knife. As an Homage to his practice of giving food to Brahmins, even today 10 Brahmins get food from his temple.\n\nIn the Utsavar idol of Thirumangai alwar, Namalwar is in his heart and the great social Ramanuja following the foot steps of Alwars.\n\nThiruvaali has a special credit of having Mangalasasanam by two great kings – Thirumangai Alwar and Kulasekara alwar (Chera Kingdom).\n\nIt’s to be noted that two kings – Thirumangai alwar and Nikanzhama prijapathi got perumals special dharsan.\n\nMoolavar:\n\nThe Moolavar found in this sthalam is Sri Lakshmi Narashimar. Also known as Vayalaali Manavalan. Irundha (Sitting) Thirukkolam facing his thirumugham towards west direction. Prathyaksham for Thirumangai alwar and Allathi Nikanchama Prajapathi.\n\nThayaar:\n\nThe Thaayar of this sthalam is Amrudhakada Valli.\n\nUtsavar:\n\nThe Utsavar found in this sthalam is Thiruvaali Nagaraalan.\n\nMangalasasanam:\n\nBoth the places are considered as one kshetram and so has gained 42 Paasurams by Kulasekara alwar and Thirumangai alwar. Also Manavala Maamunigal has visited this place many times.\n\nPushkarani:\n\nIlaakshani Pushkarani."
