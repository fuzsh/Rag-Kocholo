        "text": "Carnatic music, or Karnāṭaka saṅgītam is a system of music commonly associated with the southern part of the Indian subcontinent, with its area roughly confined to four modern states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. It is one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions, the other subgenre being Hindustani music. The main emphasis in Carnatic music is on vocal music; most compositions are written to be sung, and even when played on instruments, they are meant to be performed in gāyaki (singing) style.\n\nStudents are taught the basics of Carnatic music in a structured curriculum. Along with this, simple compositions are also taught in order to prepare them for performances and to give students an exposure to the variety and range of Carnatic music. Links to the lyrics and reference audios are provided to students.\n\nWhy Carnatic Music is a very interesting article written by Todd McComb detailing the similarities between Carnatic & Western music.\n\nLevel 1:\n\nSarali Varisai – Lessons 1 to 14 in three speeds\n\nJanta Varisai – Lessons 1 to 9 in two speeds\n\nBoth Sarali Varisai and Janta Varisai in akAram\n\nLevel 2:\n\nDhaatu Varisai – Lessons 1 and 2\n\nTara staayi Varisai – Lessons 1 to 5\n\nAlankarams – Lessons 1 to 7\n\nTheory: Tala Angas, Sapta Talas, Pancha jaatis,Alankarams in Sapta Talams\n\nLevel 3:\n\nGeethams, Nottu Swarams\n\nTheory: Sapta Swaras – Names, Twelve variations, Arohanam and Avarohanam, Staayis\n\nLevel 4:\n\nGeethams, Nottu Swarams, Swarajathis\n\nTheory: Classification of Ragas and Raga Lakshana, Advanced Tala systems – 35 Talas\n\nLevel 5:\n\nVarnams – Adi Talam\n\nKrithis\n\nTheory: Melakartha Ragas and the Katapayadi sankhya, Vaaggeyakaras – Biography of eminent composers\n\nLevel 6:\n\nVarnams – Ata Talam\n\nKrithis\n\nTheory: Types of compositions\n\nSimple krithis, bhajans, and slokams will be taught in all levels.\n\nParticipation in special workshops and performances are an integral part of the training program.\n\nRegular attendance and consistent home practice will contribute immensely towards rapid progress.\n\nMusic book is available for purchase and lyrics to compositions will be provided as and when they are taught\n\nFor home practice you can purchase the Tanpura app for both Android & iOS\n\nYou can also click on the following You Tube link for 15 minutes of tanpura in \"A\" scale (6 kattai) which can be played on a loop.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ddMfvsmTkQ"
