        "text": "Of the seven Shiva Shrines of the Kongu region, Karur Pasupatheeswarar is considered first and foremost. Emperor Musukunda, belonging to the Skanda Mahapurana period is believed to have undertaken renovation of the temple. According to the history of the place, Emperor Musukunda was extended an invitation to attend the wedding of Lord Muruga that took place in Tiruparankundram near Madurai.\n\nKarur has the reputation that Siddha Karuvurar lived here. He has praised the Lord in his Thiruvisaippa hymns. As Karuvurar dissolved himself with the Lord, the Linga is found in a slanting position. Saint Thirugnanasambandar had also praised the Lord in his Thevaram. So Arunagiriyar His favourite deity Muruga in the temple.\n\nKarur also was the place of residence of Eripathanayanar, Pugazh Chola Nayanar . On 14, 15 and 16th of Panguni Tamil month (March-April) Sun rays fall on the shrine.\n\nHistory:\n\nLord Brahmma became very proud as He is the creator of the world. With a view to teach him a lesson, Lord Shiva brought the divine cow Kamadenu. The divine cow also came to earth and performed penance here which was then a forest of Vanji trees. Kamadenu heard a sound from the sky directing it to worship an Adhi Linga hidden in an ant hill (puttru). The cow followed the order meticulously by pouring the milk on the ant hill but one day its feet touched the Lord. The cow apologized to the Lord for its careless behaviour causing bleeding on the Shivalinga. The Lord appeared before the cow and said that he would be worshipped as Pasupatheeaswara and the Kamadenu would be in charge of creation of the world. Kamadenu undertook the assignment and performed the job with all humily. At a later stage, Lord Pasupatheeswara restored the job to Brahmma himself and took Kamadenu to his Abode.\n\nSpeciality:\n\nThe Shivalinga – Anilayappar – is a swayambu that exists of its own. Lord Brahmma worshipped Anilayappar as one in the Ant hill (Puttru in Tamil). Kamadenu (divine cow) worshippped the Lord here. During the worship, the feet of Kamadenu touched the Lord’s head, the symbol of which is still on the Linga.\n\nPrayer:\n\nThe devotee surrendering at the feet of Lord Anilayappar is blessed with a complete peace of mind. Those awaiting a marriage and longing for a progeny, in need of employment opportunity, development in business, promotion in job visit the temple and worship Anilayappar. It is the staunch belief of the devotees that the Lord would never fail his Bhaktas.\n\nPrayer commitments:\n\nAbishek is offered in oil, milk, curd tender coconut to the Lord and the Goddess. People also offer Mangalsutra and jewels to the Goddess. Dhoti and Sari are offered. Feeding the visitors ( Annadhanam) is also followed by the rich.\n\nGeneral Information:\n\nKarur is 100 kms far from Salem, 76 from Trichy, 113 from Coimbatore and 144 from Madurai.
