        "text": "Bharatanatyam is the oldest classical dance tradition in India. Bharatanatyam is the state dance form of Tamil Nadu. The dance form of bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance subgenre famous for its intricate footwork, extensive variety of mudras (gestures), and storytelling style, is frequently accompanied by Carnatic music. The Veena (a plucked stringed instrument), Venu (a flute), and the Mridangam, together known as the Vadya Trayam (Holy Trinity) of Carnatic instruments, have historically accompanied performances of bharatanatyam (drum). These three instruments each have a specific purpose: the flute adds embellishment to the melodies, the veena's array of tala strings and main strings increases the texture, and the mridangam compliments the dancer's rhythmic foot motions.\n\nSince the British began colonizing India, the violin has been added to this repertory, taking the place of the Veena, which is now slowly vanishing from bharatanatyam performances. The Nattuvangam (hand cymbals), the most significant instrument on stage, is struck in time with the dancer's feet. New instruments have been used in more recent bharatanatyam performances, including the Sitar for North Indian bhajan-style tunes, the drum pad for unique effects like temple bells, and even the piano to introduce harmonies. The vocalist then performs the melodic lines, which contain the crucial sahithya (lyrics), which the dancer visually interprets.\n\nIt is stunning to watch the fusion of carnatic music with bharatanatyam, which has endured for generations.\n\nCorrelation between Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam Dance\n\nDance and music are insufficient apart from one another. The priceless dancing style of Bharatanatyam, which derives from Bharata's Natya Shastra, is given that shine by the music.\n\nCarnatic music is used to accompany Bharatanatyam dancing. Bharatanatyam's mathematical accuracy is on par with that of Carnatic music, measure for measure. The Natya Shastra, upon which Bharatanatyam is founded, is regarded as a sacred source for music since, after the Samaveda, it is the only text to discuss music in detail. In fact, Bharata Muni devotes chapters 28 to 34 to a lengthy discussion on music.\n\nIn simple words, Bharatanatyam, the oldest classical dance style in India, is a team performance art that has a single dancer accompanied by musicians and one or more vocalists who sing Carnatic classical music.\n\nBharatanatyam Music Rhythm\n\nBharatanatyam means : Bha meaning emotion (Bhava), Ra meaning music (Raaga), Ta meaning rhythm (Taal) and Natyam meaning dance. Thus Bharatanatyam is the dance that encompasses music, rhythm and expression and strictly adheres to the Natyashastra.The adavus of bharatanatyam are performed in three speeds: vilambita (slow), madhya (medium speed) and druta (fast). And Carnatic music is also known for some of the most complex rhythmic patterns and talas (beat cycles) in the world.\n\nImportance of Music in Bharatanatyam\n\nAny dance form depends heavily on the music. Bharatanatyam is a form of South Indian \"Carnatic\" dance. The conductor of the entire performance is the vocalist, known as the \"Nattuvanar,\" who may also be the guru and play musical instruments. Text and poetry are often read aloud in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Sanskrit.\n\nThe music is a major factor in how Bharatanatyam choreography is driven, particularly in its mArgam format. Consider the following as examples: varnams, keerthanams, jathiswaram, padams, javalis, and tillanas. The music of these pieces is typically what inspires a choreographer to create a piece. For a choreographer then, a very keen and intimate understanding of the music is necessary for the creation to take shape. Of course, having a solid theoretical foundation in movement is essential, but the ability to translate the music into movement calls for knowledge that goes beyond what is typically taught. In choreography, the dance and music are inextricably linked. How the music is modified to fit the idea of the dance is as important as the dance itself.\n\nBharatanatyam Music Instruments\n\nDance cannot exist without music, even if there can be music without dancing. Dancing consequently obviously involves music. The cymbals, violin, veena, flute, tanpura, and mridangam are among the other common musical instruments utilized in Bharatnatyam, in addition to the vocal support provided to a dancer.\n\nAs is common knowledge, the nritta portion of every dance performance is timed to a specific talam, beat, or rhythm. The nattuvanar uses the cymbal to establish this. Additionally, the cymbal supports and has an auditory impact on the dancer and the audience when adavus, jatis, or intricate teermanams are performed in order to highlight the beauty of the choreography of the pieces. The cymbal is employed by the nattuvanar, but it also helps the entire orchestra to keep the talam's rhythm consistent.\n\nIn a nritta sequence, the dancer's motions, particularly those of the feet, are also accompanied by the mridangam, which serves largely to clarify how the jatis are executed. Additionally, it emphasizes specific moods throughout an abhinaya sequence. For instance, drumming quickly and loudly to convey fury, softly to depict knocking on a door, etc.\n\nThere is always room for interpolations of jatis, korvais, and teermanam in musical compositions for dance. But even here, there are more methods besides just playing the mridangam or striking the talam in time with the feet. Usually, the mridangist and nattuvan add and provide flourishes and decorations. It is also crucial that they do not obliterate the recital's overall impact. It must adhere to the song's speed, emotional tone, and mood as well as the Sollukattu (jati syllables recited).\n\nInstead of cerebral attraction, dance ragas with greater emotional appeal are favored. For instance, the composer will use ragas like Mukhari, Ghanta, and Nadanammakriya to convey sadness. His choice would depend on how much sadness is conveyed in the abhinaya. By carefully emphasizing specific lines in the musical piece, the composer, in keeping with his goals, emphasizes the emotional condition. The typical ragas for invocational songs include Nattai, Hamsadhwani, etc. Ragas like Yaman Kalyani, Kadana Kudugallam, and others can be used to portray happiness.\n\nThe violinist, flute, or veena player's part is equally vital at this stage. They not only assist the singer but also enhance the song's beauty and emotion and give the dancer's abhinaya greater life. When performing music that is dedicated to a particular deity, using instruments that are connected to that God gives the performance more authenticity and truth. For instance, since Lord Krishna was famed for playing the flute, any object honoring him should feature the instrument. Similarly, the veena is linked to the goddess Saraswati, hence anything made in her honor should feature the veena."
