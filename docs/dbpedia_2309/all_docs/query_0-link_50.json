TheTemple is more than 1000 years old.\n\nRomasa Rishi did penance here seeking blessings of Lord Venkatachalapathy. This deity possesses the characters of Varaha and Narasimha avathars. It is believed that Lord Vishnuhas given Chakkarathalwar the “right” to provide the devotees long life as well as sound health in asound body. The special feature of this temple is the Main Deity. Normally in the temples of Lord Venkatachalapathy, the presiding / principal deity and also the Urchavar are one and the same Venkatachalapathy. Here in this temple in Karisulndamangalam, the Urchavar is Venkatachalapathy where as the main deity is Chakrathazhwar. While the Utsava processional deity is Venkatachalapathy with Sri and Bhoo Devi and the temple is known by that name. Chakkarathzhwar is seen with 16 hands. Behind him is Lord Yoga Narasimha with four hands.\n\nIt is believed that this idol of Narasimha, established by the Nambhoodhiris of Kerala is holding Sudarshana Chakra in allthe four hands (no Sangu). As per the inscription of 1250AD dating to the rule of Sundara Pandya II, thistemple was referred to as ‘Then Thiruvengadam’ and the place itself was called ‘Kali’ ‘Say’ Mangalam which over time became ‘Kali’ ‘Sul’ntha Mangalam ( and later ‘Karisulntha). The distance to this place was indicated as being the Eastern Hamlet of Cheran Maha Devi Chadurvedi Mangalam in Mulli Naadu (in the current measure, it is just 2 kms East of Cheran Maha Devi).\n\nThe custom of entering the sanctum sanctorum (Moolasthanam) only afterremoval of the upper garments, also indicates the above mentioned fact – that Kerala Nampoothiri pooja paddathi was adopted and followed in principle and practice. It is believed that during Pradhosha Kalam, if a person offers “Panagam” as neivedhyam and worships the lord with archana for consecutive Pradhosha days, all his wishes would be fulfilled\n\nThe moolasthana idol has oil abhishegam once in 10 days – but within hours of performing abhishegam, no trace of oil remains over the idol. So the deity is considered to be omnipotent and powerful.Sudarshana murthy is known as Chakrathalwar is the athipathy of Sukran. So this is also known as Sukran parihara sthalam.\n\nChildless couples desiring progeny, come to this temple, perform abisheka aradhanai, and offer payasam as ‘neivedhyam’; then distribute the same to village children on the steps of the ‘padithurai’. This is an ancient and strong belief.\n\nTemple timings : 7 am – 11 am and 4 pm – 5.30 pm.Mobile: +91 75985 78254 / 94880 62925 / 75981 88716 / 75981 78716\n\n4.2 Lakshmi Narasimar Kovil,Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu\n\nLakshmi Narasimar Kovil, 336, W Car St, Thirunagar, Tirunelveli Town, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu 627006 Lakshmi Narasimar Kovil is located in Thirunagar, Tirunelveli Town, Tamil Nadu and it is in the busy area of Tirunelveli town. It is in a narrow lane in busy area and is at a distance of 500 meters from the famous Nellaiappar Temple . – Car Parking not possible.It is more than 1000 years old and built by Pandya kings.\n\nMoolavar : Narasimhar; Urchavar Sreenevasa perumal Amman / Thayar Mahalakshmi Agamam / Pooja vaigasanam Thayar is seen on the left lap of the Lord with Her hands on the shoulders of the Lord holding a lotus looking at the Lord.\n\nIt is said that Lord Lakshmi Narasimar idol was sculpted even before Nelliappar and Gandhimathi Amman.and there was an underground pathway connecting both temples.In course of time, the temple got buried under ground.Great Vaishnavaite Azhwar Koorath Azhwar sensed the great energy of Lord Narasimha and discovered the idol. They rendered many renovations and maintained the temple\n\nLord Sri Narasimha graces in almost all Vishnu temples having Thayar Mahalakshmi on His left lap and embracing by His lefthand. In contrast, Thayar Mahalakshmi is seated on the left lap of the Lord, has Her hand on the shoulders of the Lord holdinga lotus flower. Also She is facing the Lord. The philosophy behind this form is that Mother represents the grievances of the devotees speaking to Lord face to face with Her hand on His shoulders.This is a very rare imagination of those who designed the idol.\n\nThe other difference is that though the Lord is called Narasimha, He does not have the face of a Lion. Such form of Narasimha is known as Prahladha Varada, Lord whoprotected Prahaladha from the cruelties of his demon father Hiranya Kasipu. It is also the belief of devotees that Perumal in this form would consider their prayers with all sympathy.\n\nDevotees light a lamp known as Neeranjana Deepam. They takerice, coconut and oil to the temple. Spread the rice on a plate.Break the coconut and pour the oil on the shell and light thelamp.

During that time Arjuna reached the kingdom of Indira to see him. Indira asked Arjuna to destroy the demons and further informed that the demons were found at Thoyamapuram (Ocean’s middle portion). Arjuna accepted it and moved to the demons and challenged them. Arjuna was surprised to see the demons fell dead in the war came alive.\n\nAt that time Arjuna heard a voice which stated that Arjuna would get victory if he derided the demonsat him. Hence Arjuna faked as if he retreats from the war which put the demons derided at him. Arjuna waited for that time and he launched Pasupatha weapon against the demons which erased all the demons.

Upon finding it, with the help of Garuda Bagavan and Kanva Muni’s instructions, king did the prathishtai with that Lord Gopalan idol and built this temple in the shenbagavana area (which is the current location).

As there was no temple or murti of Vishnu, he prayed with flowers thinking only about the Lord. On the seventh day of his prayers, all the flowers joined together and appeared as huge light in the sky. This jyoti turned out to be Lord Srinivasa with Thayar as Tambraparani at his feet.

The concorts of the Trinities Parvathi, Saraswathi and Lakshmi requested Anasuya to restore their husbands to their original form.

To the right of it are the Sita-Rama deities, and across from them is the very tall Hanuman murti. .There rare female form of Vinayaka (Ganesha) here is known as Vigneshwari, or Vallabha Ganeshaani, as described in the Mantra Shastras. This Ganeshaani murti in sukhasana pose at Suchindram is one of only a few, the others being at a 10th century temple dedicated to 64 yoginis in Bheraghat, near Jabalpur, and one at the Tanumalaya Swami Temple in Suchindrum, In Tibet, this female form of Ganesh is worshiped as Gajanani.

This ritual could only be engaged if the king gave his consent, and then it was done on a designated date. The ritual involves Kaimukkal, or ‘dipping of the hand’, in which any Namboothiri, or a high caste Brahmin who was under threat of excommunication due to immoral behavior, had to prove his innocence. A small silver ox statue was placed in a copper vessel of boiling ghee. The accused Brahmin had to reach in and pull the figure out of the ghee. A complex ritual followed in which the hand was bandaged, and the Brahmin taken to the home of a senior man, who watched over him. On the third day his hand was unwrapped. If the fingers were black and burned, the Brahmin was excommunicated, and pushed to the fringe of society. If his honor was vindicated, and the hand was normal, he was returned to his post, given gifts from the king, and all due respects were given to him by the temple community. One can only imagine the level of integrity required of Brahmins who faced such a method of oversight.\n\nThe chariots of Sthanu-Mal-Ayan temple are very beautiful, and the center of attractice at the annual Car Festival here. While Their Lordships’ original temple chariot was destroyed during the invasion of Khan Chanda Saheb, many devotees sacrificed their lives in protecting the remaining chariots, thus forcing the invaders to retreat.

As a result, Agastya cursed King Indradyumna to be reborn as an elephant, leading to Gajendra’s eventual plight.\n\nSimilarly, a Gandharva, a community noted for its musical skills, fell to the curse of Sage Kabila.

One fateful day, Gajendra ventured to a nearby lake, intending to pluck lotus flowers for a prayer dedicated to the revered deity Vishnu. Unexpectedly, a lurking crocodile emerged from the lake, seizing Gajendra’s leg in a vice-like grip. Despite valiant efforts to break free and the desperate pleas of his elephant companions, Gajendra found himself ensnared in the relentless clutches of the crocodile. Abandoned by his herd in the face of impending doom, Gajendra, depleted of strength, called out to Vishnu, holding a lotus aloft as a humble offering.\n\nResponding swiftly to Gajendra’s fervent plea, Lord Vishnu, mounted atop his Vahana Garuda, hastened to the scene. Witnessing the divine approach, Gajendra, in an act of profound devotion, raised a lotus with his trunk. Pleased by this heartfelt gesture, Lord Vishnu wielded his Sudarshana Chakra, severing the crocodile’s head and liberating Gajendra from mortal peril. Expressing profound gratitude, Gajendra humbly prostrated before Lord Vishnu, . Vishnu imparted the wisdom of Kaivalya, transcending mortal realms, and assured Gajendra of attaining moksha through surrender.\n\nTemple timings : 7 AM to 10:30 AM and 4:30 PM to 7:30 PM; Contact Phone: +91 – 4634 – 287195 / 287295 Mobile: +91 – 99659 20369\n\n4.12 Thennalagar Perumal Kovil , Kovilkulam (Sri Sundara raja Perumal)\n\nThennalagar perumal kovi, Kovilkulam, Tamil Nadu 627413 (Sri Sundara raja Perumal) Thennalagar perumal ((Sri Sundara raja Perumal) kovi is located in Kovilkulam, Ambasamudram Tamil Nadu at a distance of 30 Kms from Tirunelveli.Sundararaja Perumal is part of the Annual 5 Garuda Seva that takes place at Ambasamudram This is a 10th Century AD temple\n\nMoolavar : Thennazhagar – Vinnagar Perumal; Urchavar : Sundararaja Perumal; Thayar : Soundaravalli, Sundaravalli: Theertham : Markandeya theertham Agamam / Pooja : Vaikanasam; Historical Name : Tirupothiyil Vinnagaram\n\nAs the Murthy-idol is brought from Madurai Kallazhagar temple,Lord is named as Thennazhagar – Azhagar of South.
