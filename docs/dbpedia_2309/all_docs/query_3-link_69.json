The Indian Music tradition has been recognised as one of the most advanced systems of Global music. The Carnatic music concerts are distinguished by the vocal and violin solos which also include other genres of instruments, musical discourses and \"Hari Nama Sankirtan\".\n\nFrom time immemorial in the vocal concert, the violin has been traditionally recognised as the best support for enhancing melodic continuity and creativity. The divine interpretation of the term Sangeetha classified as \"Gita, Vadhya and Nritta\", signifies the importance of the conglomeration of the voice, instrument and dance representing Sangeeta. This Sangeeta supports the happy union of the above mentioned categories for enjoying the sheer bliss of musical concerts. All Godly representations signify the Gods with an instrument in their hands. My mind visualises Lord Krishna with his sweet bamboo flute.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Sarangi -the bowed genre of the violin family and the harmonium, which are both refined instruments in terms of enhancing the musical concerts have been an inevitable part of the Hindustani music vocal concerts. I remember my father MSG Gurui ji the violin maestro recalled the friendly conversation with the reputed vocalist Shri Madurai Mani Iyer on how the audience responded in terms of applause appealed to him. The Legend MMI revealed that this applause was generated by the combined energetic performance of the vocalist, violinist and Mridangist with each of them contributing their huge roles for the generation of the applause.\n\nIt was never the question of clap credit for just the vocalist alone. If that was the case every listener should hear the exclusive vocal concert by removing the content of violin and mridangam. Did anyone ever enjoy the Carnatic concert and can it any more be termed as a Carnatic classical traditional concert?\n\nThe magic of the applause is mastered and metered by the meteoric musical collaboration between vocal, violin and the mridangam. All traditional Concerts are a combination of vocal, violin and mridangam in the Carnatic music scenario.\n\nJust like the software companies, the trend of today is totally based on Teamwork and collaboration. The Trinity themselves who are represented with the instruments and whose compositions are the foundation of every Carnatic music concert is proof positive to demonstrate that the brilliance of every composition, for example, the Pancharatnas gained their fullest expressions through these time-tested Carnatic music concerts with the team members in their professional glory.\n\nIt is notable that the rendering of the vocalist without Violin and Mridangam support is generally treated under the genre of a prayer song or a devotional rendering and sometimes probably in a lecture demonstration. Nowadays when we read the journals of the 1970's and 1980's leading musicians sought the support of the violin and mridangam for the full concert effect. The highlight of the Carnatic vocal concert is that the creativity of the vocalist is inspired by the presence of violin and mridangam team members.\n\nThe classical collaboration of the musical trio\n\nShri Balamuralikrishna, Vocal,\n\nShri MS Gopalakrishnan, Violin and\n\nShri TV Gopalakrishnan, Mridangam\n\nis still immortal for the song Nagumomu, in Abheri ragam.\n\nLike wise there are million other stances.\n\nCompared to the musical trends of today, youngsters abroad share more appreciation, understanding and find time to attend live concerts in comparison to the dwindling presence of the audience in concerts held in India.\n\nThe very fact that Carnatic music has crossed the barriers of time is because of the traditional values of performance in accordance with the trinity compositions. Is there anybody greater than the Trinity for Carnatic music is a million-dollar question unanswered. Any trends other than tradition in Carnatic music performance need necessarily be termed as the direction and liking for fusion concerts which defy tradition and are more experimental in nature.\n\nWe as senior students of Indian music feel rejuvenated to listen to the classical concerts of yesteryear musicians for enriching our knowledge and I have been personally very lucky to perform traditional Indian classical music concerts with my revered father and Guru ji Shri MS Gopalakrishnan for more than 45years. In all my musical journey I have understood that in my trail-blazing career of more than 11,000 concerts and still continuing, it is the exemplary confirmation of tradition that can give an artist \"the\" coveted place in the realm of Indian classical music concerts as a musician of traditional excellence."
