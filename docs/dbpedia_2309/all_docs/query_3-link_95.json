        "text": "The music of the Indian subcontinent (located in Asia) is divided into the larger territory of HINDUSTANI (Northern) music and CARNATIC (Southern) music. Carnatic music is the older practice. Hindustani music has been influenced by Persian colonists who occupied the region of northern India in the 16th century and blended their music traditions with those of the original Indians. Hindustani music is based on Carnatic but has many differences. Hindustani music is more similar to Western Classical Music and has a more concert-based, performance history where longer pieces are prized while Carnatic music is more closely connected to religious and cultural activities and features shorter pieces. Hindustani music has a longer tradition of IMPROVISATION (making up music on the spot).\n\nIn addition to these two traditions, there are mainstream genres such as Pop and Bollywood that are more nationally consistent and carry elements of both.\n\nSA shadaj (षड्ज)\n\nRI rishabh (ऋषभ)\n\nGA gandhar (गान्धार)\n\nMA madhyam (मध्यम)\n\nPA pancham (पञ्चम)\n\nDHA dhaivat (धैवत)\n\nNI nishad (निषाद)\n\nUnlike most Western Classical Music scales, Raag often use different notes on the way up and the way down. Also unlike Western scales, Raag have specific combinations of notes that must always be performed together and one cannot compose using any combination at any time. These combinations are called CHALAN. Different Chalan rules can exist for the same sequence of scalar notes, resulting in multiple different Raag for the same set of notes.\n\nAAROHA: ascending order of notes\n\nAVAROHA: descending order of notes\n\nJAATI: categories of Raag based on how many notes are in the scale\n\nEach Raag creates a mood called a RAS that conveys a story or emotion to the audience. Different Ras types include tranquillity, devotion, love, loneliness, pathos, and heroism. In addition, Raag are associated with different times of the year and day.\n\nRaag are not scales because they are more structured than scales. Raag are not melodies (songs) because they are less structured than songs and songs are. If this concept seems difficult to understand, it is because there is no parallel phenomenon in Western music or culture to compare Raag to.\n\nताल WHAT IS TALA?\n\nTALA is the concept of rhythm or musical meter in Indian Classical Music. LAYA is the more general term for rhythm occurring in nature. Tala are often metered out by hand clapping, knee patting, or another physical gesture made through body percussion. Unlike most Western Classical Music, the rhythmic meter of India is often uneven, resulting in a different number and emphasis in each “measure” or section of a given rhythmic pattern. Just like Raag, Tala have many named and learned patterns that an Indian Classical musician can incorporate into their musical performance. In the Carnatic tradition, the most popular Tala is ADI TALA (आदि ताल) which is eight sets of four. The most popular Tala used in Hindustani music is TEENTAL (तीन ताल) which is four sets of four.\n\nस्वरन्धरा HARMONIUM\n\nThe HARMONIUM is a pump organ. It is essentially a keyboard accordion with an attached bellow (like a fireplace bellow) that pushes air over organ reeds. In this way, the Harmonium is a wind instrument because it utilizes wind, but it is a keyboard instrument in how the notes are struck and performed. The Harmonium is found more in Carnatic music and plays melody, not chords and harmony like you might hear from a European accordion. The timbre of the Harmonium is pure, thick, and focused.\n\nगुरु शिष्य GURU-SHISHYA TRAINING\n\nSimilar to Taiko, Indian Classical Music is taught in an oral tradition with masters (called GURU in India) training their students directly. This method is known as the GURU-SHISHYA or “master-disciple” school of training where each student can trace their lineage (PARAMPARA) back through great masters of the art. Guru-Shishya is a common form of education in India for religion and many of the arts including yoga.\n\nDisciples will often live at their guru’s home, being treated like members of the family while they study with their teacher. A quality master-disciple relationship is developed through the genuineness of the guru and the obedience and openness of the disciple.\n\nMUSICAL ELEMENTS OF INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC\n\nRHYTHM: Rhythm in Indian Classical Music is very complex, following the system of Tala developed over many centuries. The sense of meter, tempo, and subdivision exists as in Western music, but the meter is often asymmetrical and the rhythmic phrases much longer than Western music. In addition, there is a stronger connection to the body with rhythm being performed with body and vocal percussion much more often than in Western music.\n\nMELODY: Melodies are complex and improvised in the Hindustani tradition while mostly pre-composed in the Carnatic. They are based off Raag - a series of pre-established notes and sets of notes that a musician can use to develop a melody. Melodies are usually much longer than Western Classical melodies and do not follow the same symmetrical formula.\n\nHARMONY: The Western understanding of harmony is not prevalent in Indian Classical Music. This is because a good deal of the music is based on the melodic development of a raag which, via improvisation, would be challenging/unpredictable to set harmony to in the moment. In addition, when multiple melodic voices are present, they perform in unison or heterophony, so harmony is not established. The closest thing to harmony found in Indian Classical Music is the concept of DRONE. Drone is an English word for the phenomenon of a sustained pitch or pitches (usually low in range) under a melody. Drones are heard in Indian Classical music in the form of the sitar (which includes sympathetic strings that vibrate even when not actively plucked) or bowed string instruments. This is similar to how a bagpipe (in Scottish music) plays a sustained pitch out of all of the pipes of the instrument except the one the player fingers.\n\nTIMBRE: Indian Classical Music has a variety and complexity of timbres. One that is especially different from Western Classical Music is the treatment of voices. In Western music, voices can be breathy or full and often utilize vibrato. In Indian music, the voice is meant to always sing clear and full with no vibrato or use of FALSETTO (head voice when Westerners sing high in their vocal range). Also, there is a noticeable nasally timbre prized in many of the great Indian Classical singers.\n\nDYNAMICS: Dynamic contrast is generally not an important proponent of Indian Classical Music. Much of the music is soft and reflective and other music is loud and more boisterous, but generally, a single piece of music sticks to one volume throughout to accompany the mood that is being developed via the raag.\n\nTEXTURE: The texture of Indian Classical Music is very simple in comparison with other traditions around the world. This tradition is not constructed in the Western Classical Music concept of harmony and therefore does not carry the styles of texture associated. Instead, most performances of Indian Classical Music involve one melodic instrument with or without percussion which does not count as a texture element as it is non-melodic. These performances would be considered solo monophonic. When more melodic voices are added, the texture becomes monophonic unison (all voices performing the same line together) or heterophonic (all voices performing a line with some voices adding in more notes or rhythms.)\n\nFORM: The structure of Indian Classical Music is not as formulaic or symmetrical as Western Classical. It is based on the combination of Raag and Tala as well as the musicians’ improvisation and collaboration skills between performers. There is not meant to be repetitive patterns in the way Westerners are used to hearing music but, instead, the development of Raag and Tala over time heighten the emotional connection of audience members to the music.\n\nRAVI SHANKAR (1920-2012) is considered the most well-known Indian Classical Musician in the world. He was a leading Sitar Guru (earning the title “Pandit” or “Master”) and collaborated with many international musicians including The Beatles and other pop artists as well as classical symphonies around the world.\n\nHe is the father of both Norah Jones, a Grammy Award-winning American singer-songwriter, and Anoushka Shankar, one of the world’s current leading sitar players.\n\nOther famous Indian Classical Musicians include KUMAR SHARMA (santoor player), HARIPRASAD CHAURASIA, (bansuri flute player), ZAKIR HUSSAIN (tabla player), MS SUBBULAKSHMI (Carnatic singer), and ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (sitar player).\n\nWhile not a strict Indian Classical Musician, composer A.R. RAHMAN has done much to incorporate Indian traditional music into pop and film settings such as his score for the film, Slumdog Millionaire."
