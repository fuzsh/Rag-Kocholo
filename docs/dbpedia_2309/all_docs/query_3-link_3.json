        "text": "Karnatak music, music of southern India (generally south of the city of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh state) that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions and was relatively unaffected by the Arab and Iranian influences that, since the late 12th and early 13th centuries, as a result of the Islamic conquest of the north, have characterized the Hindustani music of northern India. In contrast to northern styles, Karnatak music is more thoroughly oriented to the voice. Even when instruments are used alone, they are played somewhat in imitation of singing, generally within a vocal range, and with embellishments that are characteristic of vocal music. Fewer instruments are used in Karnatak than in northern Indian music, and there are no exclusively instrumental forms.\n\nThe basic principles of raga (melody type, or framework for improvisation) and tala (cyclical rhythmic pattern) are the same in the south and north, but each musical tradition has its own repertoire of actual ragas and talas, and there are many stylistic differences as well. Karnatak music, with its more homogeneous Indian tradition, has evolved far more orderly and uniform systems for the classification of ragas and talas. Although improvisation plays a major role in Karnatak music, the repertory also consists of a vast number of composed pieces, particularly the kriti or kirtana, complex devotional songs by composers from the 16th through the 20th centuries, particularly Purandaradasa and the so-called “trinity” of great composers of the early 19th century: Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Syama Sastri.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nSound Check: Musical Vocabulary Quiz"
