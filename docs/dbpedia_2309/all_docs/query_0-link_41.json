        "text": "Meenakshi Amman Temple (also called: Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, Tiru-aalavaai and Meenakshi Amman Kovil) is a historic Hindu temple located on the southern bank of the Vaigai River in the temple city of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is dedicated to Parvati, known as Meenakshi, and her consort, Shiva, here named Sundareswarar. The temple forms the heart and lifeline of the 2,500 year old city of Madurai and is a significant symbol for the Tamil people, mentioned since antiquity in Tamil literature though the present structure was built between 1623 and 1655 CE. It houses 14 gopurams (gateway towers), ranging from 45–50m in height. The tallest is the southern tower, 51.9 metres high, and two golden sculptured vimanas, the shrines over the garbhagrihas (sanctums) of the main deities. The temple attracts 15,000 visitors a day, around 25,000 on Fridays, and receives an annual revenue of sixty million INR. There are an estimated 33,000 sculptures in the temple. It was on the list of top 30 nominees for the \"New Seven Wonders of the World\". The annual 10-day Meenakshi Tirukalyanam festival, celebrated during April and May, attracts 1 million visitors.\n\nLEGEND\n\nMeenakshi (IAST Mīnākṣī Tamil மீனாட்சி) is an avatar of the Hindu goddess Parvati - the consort of Shiva, one of the few Hindu female deities to have a major temple devoted to her. The name \"Mīnachchi\" means fish-eyed and is derived from the words \"mīna\" meaning fish and \"akṣi\" meaning eyes. The lady goddess Meenakshi is the principal deity of the temple, not Sundareswarar, unlike most Shiva temples in South India where Shiva is the principal deity. According to Hindu legend, in order to answer the prayers of the second Pandya king Malayadwaja Pandya and his wife Kanchanamalai, Parvati appeared out of the holy fire of the Putra Kameshti Yagna (sacrifice for childhood) performed by the king. According to another legend, the goddess herself gave notice to Kanchanamalai in one of her previous births that Kanchanamalai would have the privilege of mothering the goddess. The girl who came out of the holy fire had three breasts. A voice from the heavens told the king not to worry about the abnormality and added that the third breast would vanish as soon as the girl met her future husband. The happy king named the girl \"Tadaatagai\" and as the heir to the throne, Tadaatagai was trained carefully in all the 64 sastras, the fields of science.\n\nAs the time came for Tadaatagai's coronation, she had to wage war in three worlds encompassing eight directions. After conquering Brahma's Abode, Sathyaloka, Vishnu's Abode, Vaikunta, and Devas' abode Amaravati, she advanced to Shiva's Abode Kailasha. She very easily defeated the bhoota ganas (IAST: Bhūtagana, meaning Shiva's army) and Nandi, the celestial bull of Shiva, and headed to attack and conquer Shiva. The moment she looked at Shiva, she was unable to fight and bowed her head down due to shyness, and the third breast vanished immediately. Tadaatagai realized that Shiva was her destined husband. She also realized that she was the incarnation of Parvati. Both Shiva and Tadaatagai returned to Madurai and the king arranged the coronation ceremony of his daughter, followed by her marriage with Shiva.\n\nThe marriage was to be the biggest event on earth, with the whole earth gathering near Madurai. Vishnu, the brother of Meenakshi, prepared to travel from his holy abode at Vaikuntam to preside over the marriage. Due to a divine play, he was tricked by the Deva, Indra and was delayed on the way. After the marriage, the pair ruled over Madurai for a long time and then assumed divine forms as Sundareswarar and Meenakshi, the presiding deities of the temple. Following the tradition, every evening, before closing the temple, a ritual procession lead by drummers and a brass ensemble carries the image of Sundareswarar to Meenakshi's bedroom to consummate the union, to be taken back the next morning in dawn. The marriage is celebrated annually as Chithirai Thiruvizha in Madurai. During the period of Nayakar rule in Madurai, the ruler Thirumalai Nayakar linked the festival Azhakar Thiruvizha and the Meenakshi wedding ceremony.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe Meenatchi temple is believed to have been founded by Indra (king of Deva celestial deities) while he was on a pilgrimage to atone for his misdeeds. He felt his burden lifting as he neared the swayambu lingam (self formed lingam, a representation of Shiva used for worship in temples) of Madurai. He ascribed this miracle to the lingam and constructed the temple to enshrine it. Indra worshipped Shiva, who caused golden lotuses to appear in the nearby pool. Tamil literature speaks of the temple over the last two millennia. Thirugnanasambandar, the famous Hindu saint of Saiva philosophy, mentioned this temple as early as the 7th century, and described the deity as Aalavai Iraivan. The temple is believed to have been sacked by the infamous Muslim invader Malik Kafur in 1310 and all the ancient elements were destroyed. The initiative to rebuild the structure was taken by first Nayak king of Madurai, Viswanatha Nayak (1559–1600) under the supervision of Ariyanatha Mudaliar, the prime minister of the Nayak Dynasty and the founder of the Poligar System. The original design by Vishwanatha Nayak in 1560 was substantially expanded to the current structure during the reign of Thirumalai Nayak (1623–55). He took considerable interest in erecting many complexes inside the temple. His major contributions are the Vasantha Mandapam for celebrating vasanthorsavam (spring festival) and Kilikoondu Mandapam (corridor of parrots). The corridors of the temple tank and Meenatchi Nayakar Mandapam were built by Rani Mangammal.\n\nRous Peter (1786–1828), the Collector of Madurai in 1812, got nickname 'Peter Pandian’ as he respected and treated people of all faiths equally. He donated a set of golden stirrups studded with diamonds and red stones to the temple.Goddess Meenatchi is believed to have saved Rous Peter from a fatal incident. He also wished that after his death, his body be buried in a position that would enable his eyes to face the temple.\n\nTHE TEMPLE\n\nARCHITECTURE\n\nThe temple is the geographic and ritual center of the ancient city of Madurai and one of the largest temple complexes in Tamil Nadu. The temple complex is divided into a number of concentric quadrangular enclosures contained by high masonry walls. It is one of the few temples in Tamil Nadu to have four entrances facing four directions. Vishwantha Nayaka allegedly redesigned the city of Madurai in accordance with the principles laid down by Shilpa Shastras (Sanskrit: śilpa śāstra, also anglicized as silpa sastra meaning rules of architecture) relevant to urban planning. The city was laid out in the shape of square with a series of concentric streets culminating from the temple. These squares continue to retain their traditional names, Aadi, Chittirai, Avani-moola and Masi streets, corresponding to Tamil month names. Ancient Tamil classics mention that the temple was the center of the city and the streets happened to be radiating out like lotus and its petals. The temple prakarams (outer precincts of a temple) and streets accommodate an elobrate festival calendar in which dramatic processions circumabulate the shrines at varying distances from the centre. The vehicles used in processions are progressively more massive the further they travel from the centre. The complex is in around 180,000 m2.\n\nGOPURAMS\n\nThe temple is surrounded by gopurams (gateway tower), - There are ten gopuram the tallest of which, the famous southern tower, rises to over 52 m and was built in 1559. The oldest gopuram is the eastern one, built by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan during 1216-1238 Each gopuram is a multi-storeyed structure, covered with thousands of stone figures of animals, gods and demons painted in bright hues. The outer gopuram presents steeply pyramidal tower encrusted with plaster figures, while the inner gopuram serves as the entrance to the inner enclosure of Sundareswarar shrine.\n\nSHRINES\n\nThe central shrine of Meenakshi Amman temple and her consort Sundareswarar are surrounded by three enclosures and each of these are protected by four minor towers at the four points of the compass, the outer tower growing larger and reaching higher to the corresponding inner one. The Meenakshi shrine has the emerald-hued black stone image of Meenakshi. The Sundareswarar shrine lies at the centre of the complex, suggesting that the ritual dominance of the goddess developed later. Both the Meenakshi and Sundareswarar shrines have gold plated Vimanam (tower over sanctum). The golden top can be seen from a great distance in the west through the apertures of two successive towers. The area covered by the shrine of Sundareswarar is exactly one fourth of the area of the temple and that of Meenakshi is one fourth that of Sundareswarar.\n\nThe tall sculpture of Ganesh carved of single stone located outside the Sundareswarar shrine in the path from Meenashi shrine is called the Mukuruny Vinayakar. A large measure of rice measuring 3 kurini (a measure) is shaped into a big ball of sacrifice and hence the Ganesh is called Mukkurni Vinayagar (three kurinis). This deity is believed to be found during a 17th-century excavation process to dig the Mariamman temple tank.\n\nTEMPLE TANK & SURROUNDING PORTICO\n\nThe sacred temple tank Porthamarai Kulam (\"Pond with the golden lotus\"), is 50 m by 37 m in size. According to legend, Shiva promised a stork that no fish or other marine life would grow here and thus no marine animals are found in the lake. In the Tamil legends, the lake is supposed to judge the worth of a new piece of literature. Authors place their works here and the poorly written works are supposed to sink and the scholastic ones are supposed to float, Tirukkural by Tiruvalluvar was one such work.\n\nOnly a fraction of 17th and 18th century paintings of Nayak period survives and one such portion is found in the small portico on the western side of the tank. It depicts the marriage of Sundareswarar and Meenkashi attended by Vijayaranga Chokkanatha and Rani Mangammal. The painting is executed on a vivid red background, with delicate black linework and large areas of white, green and ochre. The celestial couple is seated inside an architectural frame with a flowering tree in the background.\n\nHALLS\n\nThe corridor surrounding the sanctum the Meenakshi is called kilikoondu Mandapam (\"bird cage corridor\"). The space was once used to keep green parrots that were trained to utter the name of Meenakshi. There are two large cages full of squawking green parrots.\n\nThe Kambatadi Mandapam (\"Hall of temple tree\") with its seated Nandi (sacred bull) has various manifestations of Shiva carved and also contains the famous \"Marriage of Meenakshi\" sculpture. Sculptures of Shiva and Kali trying to out-dance one another are pelted with balls of ghee by devotees. A golden flagstaff with 32 sections symbolizes the human backbone and is surrounded by various gods, including Durga and Siddar.\n\nThe Puthu Mandapam (\"new hall\") constructed by Tirumala Nayak contains large number of sculptures. It is situated opposite to the east gopuram.\n\nThe Ashta Shakthi Mandapam (\"Hall of eight goddess\") is the first hall in the entrance of Meenakshi shrine tower near to East Tower. Ashta indicates eight and Shakthi refers to goddess - the hall has statues of eight goddesses. The gopurams (towers) can be viewed from this hall. The passage was named for eight forms of goddess Sakthi carved on its pillars. Other sculptures and paintings depict the Tiruvilayadal (holy games of Shiva). The sculptures of heroes of Mahabharata, the Pancha pandavas can be seen in the Pancha Pandava Mandapam (Hall of Pandavas).\n\nThe Viravasantharaya Mandapam is a large hall with huge corridors. To the south of this hall is the kalyana mandapam, to the south of the pillared hall, is where the marriage of Shiva and Parvati is celebrated every year during the Chithirai Festival in mid-April. The golden images of Meenakshi and Sundareswarar are carried into the 16th century oonjal mandapam (swing corridor) and placed on the swing every Friday at 5:30 p.m. The shrine has a 3-storied gopuram guarded by two stern dwarapalakas (guardians) and supported by golden, rectangular columns that bear lotus markings. Along the perimeter of the chamber, granite panels of the divine couple are present. The hall is situated in the western bank of the temple tank.\n\nThe Mudali Pillai Mandapam or Iruttu Mandapam (Dark hall) is a wide and long hall built by Muthu Pillai during 1613. On the pillars of the halls, there are fine sculptures depicting the story of Shiva taking the form of Bikshadanar to teach the sages a lesson.\n\nThe Mangayarkarasi mandapam is a newly built hall situated opposite to the marriage halls and bears the name of saindy queen, Mangayarkarasi who contributed to Saivism and Tamil language. To the south of Mangayarkarasi mandapam lies the Servaikarar Mandapam, a hall built by Marudu brothers in 1795. The Nagara mandapam (Hall of beating drums) lies opposite to Sundareswarar shrine was built by Achaya Rayar, the minister of Rani Mangammal in 1635. The Kolu Mandapam is a hall for displaying dolls during the Navarathri festival celebrated during September–October. This hall is situated in the second corridor of the Meenakshi shrine at the western side.\n\nHALL OF THOUSAND PILLARS\n\nThe Meenakshi Nayakkar Mandapam (\"Hall of 1000 pillars\") has two rows of pillars carved with images of yali (mythological beast with body of lion and head of an elephant), commonly used as the symbol of Nayak power. It is situated to the north of Sundareswarar flag staff hall. The Thousand Pillar Hall contains 985 (instead of 1000) carved pillars. The hall was built by Ariyanatha Mudaliar in 1569 and blends engineering skill and artistic vision. Ariyanatha Mudaliar was prime minister and general of Viswanatha Nayak, the first Nayaka of Madurai (1559–1600). He was also the founder of Poligar System, the quasi-feudal organization of the country dividing it into multiple palayams or small provinces in which each palayam was ruled by a palayakkarar or a petty chief. At the entrance of the hall is the statue of Ariyanatha Mudaliar seated on a horse-back, flanking one side of the entrance to the temple. The statue is periodically garlanded by worshippers. Each pillar in the hall is a carved monument of the Dravidian sculpture. The more prominent among the carved figures are those of Rati (wife of Kama), Karthikeya, Ganesha, Shiva as a wandering mendicant and endless number of yalis (mythical figures of lions). There is a Temple Art Museum in the hall where icons, photographs, drawings, and other exhibits of the 1200 years old history of the temple are displayed. Just outside this hall, towards the west, are the Musical Pillars. Each pillar, when struck, produces a different musical note.\n\nRELIGIOUS SIGNIFANCE OF THE TEMPLE\n\nA distinct feature of Meenakshi in terms of iconography is the presence of parrot in her right hand. The parrot is generally associated with the Vaishnava azhwar saint Andal. \"Pancha Sabhai\" refers to the five royal courts of Nataraja (dancing form of Shiva) where he performed cosmic dance. The Tamil word velli means silver and ambalam means stage or altar. This massive Nataraja sculpture is enclosed in a huge silver altar and hence called \"Velli Ambalam\" (silver abode). This is a special figure of Natarja which usually differs from Chola bronzes; in the Chola images, Nataraja is shown dancing with his left leg raised, but this sculpture has the right leg raised. According to the Tiruvilayaadal Puranam (Shiva's sacred games), this is on the request of Rajasekara Pandya, who was a sincere devotee of Shiva. He requested the deity to change his position, as he felt that keeping the same foot raised would put enormous strain and got a graceful acquiescence from the divine master.\n\nRITUALS\n\nWORSHIP\n\nThere are close to 50 priests in the temple who perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to Shivaite to the Adishaivas, a Brahmin sub-caste. The priests live in a closed area north of the temple. The temple has a six time pooja calendar everyday, each comprising four rituals namely abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offerings) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Meenakshi and Sundareswarar. The puja (worship) ceremonies are held amidst music with nadhaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. The common practise is to worship Meenakshi before Sundareswarar. Margazhi (December–January) ritual is prominent one for winning a perfect, god-like husband - it is Meenakshi's ennai kappu festival. Aligned with the cardinal points, the street plans forms a giant mandala (group) whose sacred properties are believed to be activated during the mass clockwise circumambulation of the central temple.\n\nFESTIVALS\n\nThe most important festival associated with the temple is the \"Meenakshi Thirukalyanam\" (the divine marriage of Meenakshi) that is celebrated in April every year. The wedding of the divine couple is regarded as a classic instance of south Indian female-dominated marriage, an arrangement referred as \"Madurai marriage\". The male dominated marriage is called \"Chidambaram marriage\", referring to Shiva's uncontested dominance, ritual and mythic, at the famous Shiva temple of Chidhambaram. The marriage brings together rural and urban people, deities and mortals, Saivas (those who worship Shiva) and Vaishnavas (those who worship Vishnu) in order to celebrate Meenakshi as the royal monarch. During the one month period, there are a number of events including the \"Ther Thiruvizhah\" (chariot festival) and \"Theppa Thiruvizhah\" (float festival). Major Hindu festivals like Navrathri and Shivrathri are celebrated in the temple. Like most Shakti temples in Tamil Nadu, the Fridays during the Tamil months of Aadi (July–August) and Thai (January–February) are celebrated in the temple by thousands of devotees. \"Avani Moola Utsavam\" is a 10-day festival mainly devoted to Sundareswarar describes his various Thiruvilayadal meaning Shiva's sacred games.\n\nLITERARY MENTION\n\nDown the centuries, the temple has been a centre of education of Tamil culture, literature, art, music and dance. All three assemblies of Tamil language, the Tamil Sangam (about the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE), were held at Madurai. Tamil poets of different epochs participated in these assemblies and their composition is called Sangam literature. During the third Tamil sangam, the comparative merit of the poets was decided by letting the works float in the lotus tank of the temple. It was believed that a divine force would cause the work of superior merit to float on the surface while the inferior literary work would sink. Tevaram, the 7th-8th century Tamil canonoical work on Shiva, are works by the three prominent Nayanars (Saivites) namely Appar, Sundarar and Thirugnanasambandar. The temple has been glorified by the hymns of Tevaram by all the three poets. Different hymns of Sambandar on the temple mention the queen of Pandya Nadu, his desire to defeat Jains in debate, the miracles performed by him curing the king's fever, the Jains' provocation of Sambandar by burning his house and challenging him to debate, and Sambandar's eventual victory over them. A poem from the Third Tirumurai by Sambandar is as under –\n\n\"Lady who has eyes that are comparable to the startled eyes of the deer!\n\nthe great chief queen of the Vaḻuti! listen to what I say. Do not feel distressed that I am such a young boy from whose mouth milk is flowing. when the god in Tiruvālavāy stands by my side as help, I can not be easily defeated by the low people who inflict many sufferings on others and who live in hills beginning with great Āṉaimalai.\"\n\nThere are few poets in Tamil history who sang about goddess Parvati. The notable among them is Kumaraguruparar, a 17th-century Tamil poet, who composed Meenakshi Pillaitamil on Meenakshi of this temple. King Tirumalai Nayak's patronage of Kumaraguruparar has an important place in the history of pillaitamil (a genre of Tamil literature). Kumaraguruparar visited a lot of temples and when he visited this temple, he composed Meenakshi pillaitamil on Meenakshi. Legend has it that goddess appeared in the dreams of Nayak directing him to arrange the recital of Kumaraguruparar before a learned assembly. The king made elobrate arrangements for the event. Meenakshi impersonated herself in the form of a small girl and enjoyed the recital. As Kumaraguruparar was explaining the 61st verse, the goddess appreciated by garlanding the poet with a string of pearls and disappeared.\n\nWIKIPEDIA\n\nThe group of monuments at Mahabalipuram is a collection of 7th and 8th century religious monuments in the coastal beach resort town of Mamallapuram and a UNESCO World Heritage site.[1][2][3] It is on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, about 60 kilometres (37 mi) south of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.[1]\n\nThe site has 40 ancient monuments and Hindu temples,[4] including one of the largest open-air rock reliefs in the world, the Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna's Penance.[1][5] The site includes several categories of monuments: ratha temples with an architecture of monolith processional chariots built between 630 and 668 CE; the mandapa viharas also called cave temples with narratives from the Mahabharata, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism with inscriptions in multiple Indian languages and scripts; rock reliefs particularly bas-reliefs; stone cut structural temples built between 695 and 722 CE; and, archaeological excavations some dated to 6th century and earlier.[3][6]\n\nThe monuments were built during the Pallava Period.[2][3][7] They were referred to as Seven Pagodas in many colonial era publications, are also called the Mamallapuram temples or Mahabalipuram temples in contemporary literature. The site was restored after 1960, and has been managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.[8]\n\nLocation and nomenclature\n\nThe Mahabalipuram temples are in the southeastern part of peninsular India, in the state of Tamil Nadu. They are located about 60 kilometres (37 mi) southwest from Chennai, along the Coromandel Coast. The monuments are reachable by a four-lane divided highway (East Coast Road, SH 49 and 49A). The nearest airport is Chennai (IATA: MAA). The city is connected to the rest of India through a railway network.[9]\n\nMahabalipuram is known by several names such as Mamallapuram, where Mamalla means \"Great Wrestler\" and refers to a 7th century king Narasimha Varman I.[9][10] Other names found in historic texts, state Vora and Sundaresh, include Mamallapattana, Mavalipuram, Mavalivaram, Mavellipore, Mauvellipooram and Mahabalipur, all of which refer to \"city of great wrestler\" or \"city of Mahabali\". The latter term is related to mythical Mahabali, the demon king defeated by one of the Vishnu avatars, the dwarf Vamana.[11] An alternate proposal is by Nagaswamy, who states that the name is derived from the Tamil word \"Mallal\" which means prosperity, and reflects it being an ancient economic center of trade not only for South India but also for Southeast Asia.[12][note 1] This proposal is in part supported by a Tamil text dated to the 8th century, authored by the early Bhakti movement poet Thirumangai Alvar, where Mamallapuram is called \"Kadal Mallai\".[12][14]\n\nThe town was called the \"Seven Pagodas\" by European sailors who landed on this coast after they saw seven towers of Hindu temples.[1][15] The 7th century inscriptions refer to it as Mamallapuram or close variants, the term Mahabalipuram appears only after the 16th century and one used in colonial era literature in addition to Seven Pagodas.[16][17][note 2] In 1957, the Tamil Nadu government adopted the ancient name Mamallapuram as the official name of the site and township, and in 1964 declared Mamallapuram monuments and coastal beach region as a Special Tourism area and Health Resort.[18]\n\nHistory\n\nThe ancient history of Mahabalipuram is unclear, but numismatic and epigraphical evidence, as well as being a base of numerous temples suggests it was likely significant location before the monuments were built. Some speculative theories state that it is the same town as the seaport Sopatma mentioned in the 1st century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, alternatively that Ptolemy's port named Melange in his 2nd century Geographia is this site. Yet another theory posits that the port of Nirppeyarvu mentioned in the Perumpanarrupadai from the early centuries of the common era may be Mahabalipuram or Kanchipuram.[16][17]\n\nThe Sanskrit poet scholar Daṇḍin who lived in Tamil Nadu and was associated with the court of the Pallavas, in his Avantisundari Katha, praises artists for their exceptional repair of a Vishnu sculpture at Mamallapuram.[19] Scholars dispute whether Dandin was the author of this text.[20] Regardless of the author, the medieval Sanskrit text mentions the Mamallapuram monuments, an early tradition of repairs, and the significance of Vaishnavism.[19]\n\nA 1911 painting of a few Ratha monuments at Mahabalipuram. Tucks Oilette, the author called the site the Seven Pagodas.\n\nA 1921 photo of the Shore Temple.\n\nThe Venetian traveller Marco Polo, as he circled back from Southeast Asia and arrived in India, mentions a place he did not visit but called \"Seven Pagodas\", a name that became associated with shore temples of Mahabalipuram in publications by European merchants that followed centuries later. It entered the Catalan atlas drawn by the Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques in 1375, where the Spanish map shows \"Setemelti\" and \"Santhome\", a crude map of Asia but one accurate in the relative positions of the two ports, wherein the former now is Mamallapuram and the latter Mylapore.[21][note 3] Another Venetian traveler Gasparo Balbi in 1582 mentioned the \"Seven Pagodas\" and \"Eight Pleasant Hillocks\" which the Indian historian Nagaswamy suggests referring to these monuments.[16][17] However, Schalk disagrees and states that Balbi calls it \"Seven Pagodas of China\", and this is a re-interpretation of Henry Yule's reading of Balbi, which treated Balbi unreliable, followed it with a selective correction that it probably meant Mamallapuram.[22]\n\nSince, however the counting is done, there are now fewer than seven towers, this name has long led to speculation and argument.[23] A December 2004 Tsunami briefly exposed the beachfront near Saluvankuppam, now north of Mahabalipuram, revealing some inscriptions and structures. These were dated to the 9th century and possibly destroyed by a 13th century tsunami, states Badrinarayanan in a BBC report. The tsunami also revealed large structures on the seabed about a kilometer into the sea, which archaeologists speculate may be the more ancient Mahabalipuram.[24] According to an article in the Science magazine, the tsunami exposed rocks with \"elaborately sculpted head of an elephant and a horse in flight\", \"a small niche with a statue of a deity; another rock with a reclining lion\", and other Hindu religious iconography.[25] After the 2004 tsunami, marine archaeologists assisted by underwater diving teams have explored the site to the east of one of the monuments called the Shore Temple. This has revealed the existence of ruins of fallen walls, large number of rectangular blocks and other structures running parallel to the shore, in addition to the forty surviving monuments.[16][14]\n\nModern era reports\n\nThe European sailors and merchants who pioneered the modern era trade to Asia after the 16th century mention the site. The early reports such as those by Niccolao Manucci, who never visited the site, but viewed the monuments at a distance and heard about them, confused the Chinese and Burmese Buddhist pagoda designs he had previously seen with features in the Hindu temples and assumed that the temples were built by the Chinese.[21] Anthony Hamilton published an account of \"East Indies\" in 1727 that says it was a pilgrimage center and called its outside sculpture as \"obscene, lewd\" as any in the performances at the Drury Lane. The French writer Pierre Sonnerat, in contrast, was critical of European writing and racism directed at Indians and speculated that the Mahabalipuram temples must be very old.[21]\n\nThe 1788 scholarly survey report of the Mahabalipuram by William Chambers brought these monuments to the attention of scholars in Europe.[26] Chambers interviewed the locals, and linked the art on the monuments he saw to Hindu texts, calling it remarkable and expressive in its narrative detail.[27] A series of systematic studies that prepared sketches of the monuments and collected impressions of the inscriptions followed in the 19th century, such as those by Benjamin Babington and William Elliot.[28] Some of the stories and speculations in the Western literature, nevertheless, continued to be unusual. For example, Francis Wilford in 1809 suggested that the monuments were built in 450 BCE, linking them to Cicero's writings about Indian Hercules names Bolus or Baladeva who he claimed may have built three ancient Indian temple cities including the Mahabalipura.[27]\n\nWestern scholarship on Mahabalipuram monuments started with 1788 report by William Chambers. Above (clockwise): 19th century sketches of Hindu deities in a mandala, a lion statue, entrance of cave temple and a rock relief.[21]\n\nThe 19th-century reports summarize their survey of natives with a mention of \"gilt tops of many pagodas\" in the surf at sunrise that their grandfather used to talk about but can no longer be seen.[27] In late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Mahabalipuram site was largely the focus of colonial era tourist guides and speculations. Parts of many monuments were covered with sand, and little was done to preserve the site.[29] After Indian independence from the colonial British Empire, the state of Tamil Nadu redeveloped the Mamallapuram monuments and coastal beach region as a archaeological, tourism and pilgrimage site by improving the road networks and town infrastructure. In 1984, the site was reviewed by a panel of experts and declared as a UNESCO World Heritage site, under four categories under criteria of i, ii, iii and iv.[3][7]\n\nThe site has re-emerged as an archaeological site since 1990, where excavations have yielded unexpected discoveries. For example, states John Marr, the site has revealed \"an apsidal-shaped tank, its curved end aligned south towards the middle portion of the Shore Temple\" with the Anantasayana (reclining Vishnu), which likely predates the Shore Temple.[30]\n\nChronology: Pallava construction\n\nThe town of Mamallapuram became prominent during the Pallava period, starting with the reign of Simhavishnu in the last decades of the sixth century CE, a period of political competition with the Pandyas, the Cheras and the Cholas, as well as one of spiritual ferment with the rise of Bhakti movement poet scholars between 6th and 8th century, the Vaishnava Alvars and Shaiva Nayanars. The architectural history of Mamallapuram site is linked to Simhavishnu's son Mahendravarman I (600-630 CE), who was a patron of arts. His son Narsimha Varman I built upon the early efforts of his father, and many of the monuments are attributed to him by most scholars. After a brief hiatus, the building of novel temples and monuments continued during the reign of Rajasimha, or Narasimhavarman II (690-728 CE).[31][3]\n\nThe mid 20th century archaeologist A. H. Longhurst described the Pallava Architecture, including those found at Mahabalipuram monuments into four chronological periods: Mahendra style (610-640 CE), Mamalla style (640-670 CE, refers to Narasimhavarman I), Rajasimha style (674-800 CE) and Nandivarman style (800-900 CE). K.R. Srinivasan described it as reflecting three styles and stages of construction, calling the third period as the Paramesvara style.[32]\n\nThe chronology has been a subject of scholarly disagreement. Some scholars such as Marilyn Hirsh in 1987 have stated that the earliest temples are traceable to about 600 CE in the reign of poet and artist king Mahendravarman.[33] A few, such as Nagaswamy in 1962, have stated that it was King Rajasimha (690-728 CE) who is the likely patron of many of the monuments because many temple inscription have one of his names, as well as his distinctive Pallava Grantha and ornate Nagari scripts.[32]\n\n1808 map of Mahabalipuram monuments. In the center is the main hill with the cave temples, the Shore temple is near the protuberance on coastline while others monuments are within a few kilometers of the main hill.[34]\n\nOne of the evidences that favors dating some of the Mamallapuram monuments to early 7th century is the Mandagapattu inscription (Laksitayana inscription) of Mahendravarman I (580/600-630 CE). The inscription states that he \"brought into existence a temple without utilizing either timber or lime (mortar) or brick or metal\", and that the temple was dedicated to \"Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva\".[35][36] This was the first Pallava rock-derived Hindu temple, and there is no reason to assume that Mahendravarman I and his descendants stopped and waited for nearly 70 years to build the next. Further, states Mate and other scholars, the inscription implies that the Tamil people already had a pre-6th century temple construction tradition, albeit one based on the materials Mahendravarman I mentions.[35] The Mandagapattu inscription is not isolated, and additional inscriptions of Mahendravarman I relating to cave temples have been discovered across his kingdom.[33][37] Further evidence is in the form of cave temples such as Undavalli Caves which predate the Mamallapuram cave temples, suggesting that the ancient Indian artisans had already begun exploring cave architecture before the Pallava period.[35]\n\nThe various monuments at Mamallapuram are generally dated by scholars over the 7th and 8th century.[1][2]\n\nDescription\n\nThe ratha temples are one of the many monuments at Mamallapuram. Above: A 1913 photo of the five rathas group.\n\nThe monuments at Mahabalipuram present a fusion of religion, culture, and legends, all related to the Hindu religious pantheon.[38][21] They are different expressions through rock or inside boulders, albeit on a grand scale, integrating the nature and in the form of architectural sculpture. The site has about forty monuments to varying degrees of completion, and these are categorized into five:[3][39]\n\nAmong the major ones, there are ten rathas, ten mandapas, two rock bas reliefs and three structural temples.[40] The plan of the monuments is predominantly based on square and circle principle, or stacked squares to produce rectangles. The reliefs, the sculptures and the architecture weaves in ideas and deities of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism with equal reverence, though each monument is dedicated to a primary deity or a famed character in Hindu mythology or Epic.[41][42][43] The Mamallapuram monuments are also a source of many Sanskrit inscriptions from the 7th and 8th century with insights into the history, culture, kingship and religiosity of South India.[44]\n\nRatha temples\n\nThe Ratha Temples are monuments carved in the shape of processional chariots in the southern part of the town. The artists used the naturally occurring blocks of diorite and granite in sand, carving legends as monoliths in stone.[3] The most famed ones are the five monolithic structures which project above the sandy beach. These are called the five Rathas, alternatively as the Pandava Rathas (Pandavas were five brothers and their common wife Draupadi of the epic Mahabharata). Though the symbolism and grouped structure of these temples has led to this popular name, these are neither true rathas nor are they dedicated to the Pandavas. They are temples dedicated to deities and ideas in Shaivism (Shiva), Vaishnavism (Vishnu) and Shaktism (Durga) traditions of Hinduism.[45] These rathas are dated to the 7th century.[3]\n\nThe five ratha group is cardinally oriented in the north-south axis, with the Dharmaraja ratha in the south, Bhima ratha next to it to its north, followed by Arjuna and Draupadi rathas sharing a common platform and further north.[45] There is a lion to the west of Arjuna-Draupadi platform, a seated bull to their east, and a standing elephant on their southwest. The Nakula and Sahadeva ratha is to the northwest of Bhima ratha, and southwest of Arjuna ratha behind the standing elephant. The center cross sectional axis of the Nakula and Sahadeva ratha is in the middle of the group.[45] All of the temples have a west entrance except Nakula-Sahadeva ratha which has a south entrance.[45]\n\nAll Mamallapuram rathas share some common elements. Each is placed on a moulded plinth with or without ganas, states George Michell, and above this plinth the \"walls divide rhythmically into a number of projections and recesses between pilasters\" thereby producing niches.[46] Within these niches are placed sculptures. Those images the artisans considered significant, to them they added makaras at the brackets. Above these they added overhanging eve, in which they sometimes depicted peering human faces as if they are sitting inside the ratha.[46] Then they added additional mouldings till the parapet. The upper level either rhythmically repeated at a reduced level the lower level design, or they capped the superstructure with curved roofs. A combination of these ideas created a veritable catalog of memorable architectonic designs.[46]\n\nThe Dharmaraja ratha: overview, section and plan.\n\nDharmaraja ratha\n\nThe Dharmaraja ratha[note 4] has a square plan within a rectangular frame (26.75 ft x 20.67 ft) and is 35.67 feet high.[47][48] It has an open porch supported by pillars. Its pyramidal tower consists of a vimana of symmetrically shrinking squares capped by an octagonal shikara. There is evidence that it had or intended to have a finial, but that is missing. The pillars have seated lions at its base. It has three levels, the lowest is solid (probably never carved out), while the upper two have shrines.[47][49] The two upper levels are connected by a stair carved into the stone. The middle level has two shrines, while the uppermost has one. The ratha temple walls have carvings and inscriptions. One inscription mentions Narasimhavarman I. The western side of the top storey has a Somaskanda image. The entablature integrates the secular with the divine, where human faces peep out of the kudu arches of the chariot. An Amaravati motif is carved below the cornice.[47][49]\n\nAt the ground level, the sides aligned to the procession's length have four pillars, while the other two have two pillars and two pilasters. Each corner at the ground level has sides with two niches, wherein figures are carved in, shown as if waving to the crowd. The deities shown on the ground level are Ardhanarishvara (half Parvati, half Shiva), Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), Brahma, Skanda, Bhairava (Shiva) and two other unclear forms of Shiva.[47] The upper mid level has carvings that show various aspects of Shiva and Vishnu, suggesting that the artists revered both traditions of Hinduism.[50][49] Included on this level are Nataraja (dancing Shiva), Vinadhara (Shiv with Vina), Gangadhara (Shiva bringing Ganges from heaven to earth), Vrishbhantika (Shiva with Nandi), Kankalamurti, Chandesa and Vishnu.[47][51]\n\nThe uppermost level has carvings of Dakshinamurti (Shiva as guru or teacher), Surya and Chandra.[47][51][49]\n\nThe Somaskanda panel in this ratha temple is significant because it has been one of the reasons for dating this temple to early 7th century. The Somaskanda depicted is quite different than those created in Rajasimha period, and looks similar to those created the early Pallava period.[45]\n\nBhima ratha\n\nBhima ratha is the most massive of the five rathas.[52]\n\nThe Bhima ratha is massive, follows the Dharmaraja ratha and has a roof that looks like a vaulted barrel, reminding one of wood work.[52][note 5] The ratha is 46 feet long and about 25 feet high and wide. Its interior is incomplete and likely intended for reclining Vishnu (Anantasayana).[52][54] Unlike the other ratha which have inscriptions and sculptures, this has none. Its vimana is intricately carved on both sides of the roof. The cornice has seven pairs of kudus (Sanskrit: gavaksha).[52] Above it are alternating salas and kutas forming thirteen small vimanas. Above this layer are five grivas carved into shrine like niche flanked by small pilasters. The two on each side are all the same size, the middle one is the biggest. There is structural evidence on the top that there were eighteen kalasas there and likely two tridents, but these are all missing now.[52][55]\n\nThis ratha too has an embedded square plan, states Ramaswami, upto the entablature.[52] It integrates in the griva and the shikara in the form of circle. The long side has four round pillars and two rounded pilasters with the base designed as seated lions. The north and south sides have two pillars each, but these are square and massive.[52] The roof has crack lines which may have been caused by structural elements or from centuries of weathering such as lightning.[52]\n\nThe Arjuna ratha follows Bhima ratha and is also incomplete. It is one of the larger monuments but about six times smaller in area than the Dharmaraja ratha.[56][45] It has two levels and has one shrine. It is also square in plan. In many ways, it rhythmically mirrors the Dharmaraja ratha. For example, the decoration and structure of cornice, kudus and the haras are similar.[56] The shikhara of the Arjuna ratha, however, is hexagonal.[45] The walls of the ratha are carved into panels with fourteen sculptures. Four of these are dvarapalas, one Vishnu, a rishi (sage) with a student, a Kartikeya (Murugan) which could alternatively be Indra, one Shiva with Nandi, and the rest are human beings shown in different stages of their life including couples.[56] The Arjuna ratha has a lion and Nandi bull on each side between it and the Draupadi ratha that follows next, but their orientation suggests that this ratha was not meant for Shiva.[45] According to Susan Huntington, it is unclear for whom this temple was meant and she states it could be Ayyappa (Dharma-shasta).[45] The tower consists of a round shikara. The monument looks odd on its side, partly because its original pillars were lost and have been replaced with modern era restorative pillars that do not fit with the texture or style of the original creation.[56] There is a standing elephant to the northwest of the Arjuna ratha.[57][45]\n\nThe Draupadi ratha is a small 11 feet by 11 feet square stone structure north of Arjuna ratha, and they share the platform.[56] It is dedicated , whose image is carved on the rear wall. It looks like a wooden hut with a curvilinear roof. There is a carved structure with alternating lions and elephants. The shrine deity is missing.[56][45] The design is a highly simplified form of Nagara style Hindu temple. It has reliefs showing Durga, three of her images are on the outer walls and she is also shown on one of the inside walls. The east facing Durga is her Mahishasuramardini form with the head of buffalo demon. Elsewhere, with her are depicted devotees, makaras (mythical sea creatures) and ganas (mythical, comical dwarfs).[58]\n\nThe Nakula-Sahadeva ratha and standing elephant.\n\nNakula and Sahadeva ratha\n\nThe Nakula-Sahadeva ratha is another incomplete monument. It is an apsidal temple, a relatively uncommon design in Hinduism but found in Aihole and other parts of India.[57] The temple is a Vesara design, 16 feet high and 18 feet long. The temple is two storeyed, it has kutas and salas like the others, but is unique in that it includes panjaras. It is unclear which deity it may have been intended, with hypothesis ranging from Kartikeya, Brahma, Ayyappa and Indra.[57][45] To the northeast of the Nakula and Sahadeva is a standing elephant and Arjuna ratha.[31]\n\nOther rathas\n\nThe Ganesha ratha, likely it became a model for gopuras found in later Tamil temples.\n\nOther ratha monuments at Mahabalipuram include the late 7th century Ganesha Ratha, attributed to Parameshvara-varman I, the grandson of Mahamalla.[59][60]\n\nThe Ganesha ratha is located a kilometer from the Pancha rathas. It is next to and north of Descent of the Ganges bas relief and south of Krishna's butter ball monument. The Ganesha ratha is small but similar to Bhima ratha and has two storeys.[61] It is 19 feet long, 11.25 feet wide and 28 feet high. This monument has survived without much damage. The first storey includes 5 mini-vimanas, while the second storey features 4 mini-vimanas, each pattern repeating in overall and integral levels. The sala has nine kalasas, and one end has a trishula on the top just like churches have a cross. The temple's facade has two pillars and two pilasters.[61] The base of these columns are shaped like seated lions, the middle is chamfered topped off with the fluted capital.[61] On the sides of the entrance mandapa are two standing dvarapalas with welcoming bent heads. The temple wall has an inscription which suggests that this is also a 7th century monument. Inside the sanctum is a Ganesha statue, but according to Ramaswami, this may have been added in later.[61]\n\nElsewhere, the Mamallapuram monuments group has two Pidari rathas and a Valayankuttai ratha, which are two storeyed monuments and all incomplete.[61] They are significant because one Pidari ratha and one Valayankuttai ratha are modelled in North Indian Nagara style architecture, while the second Pidari ratha has a South Indian Dravida style architecture.[61]\n\nMandapas\n\nMandapa is a Sanskrit term for a vestibule, pillared hall or a pavilion typically a square.[62] These were spaces for people to gather socially, usually for ceremonies and rites-of-passage rituals. Often cells or sanctum(s) would be included with these, creating a vihara. The term mandapa also refers to rock-cut cave temples, also called rock shrines, built around the same concept. Mamallapuram has many mandapas or cave temples.[3] They are dated to the 7th and 8th century.[31]\n\nThe Mamallapuram cave temples are incomplete and this has made them a significant source of scholarly information about how cave monuments were excavated and built in 7th century India.[63] Segments of the caves show that artisans worked with the architects to first mark off the colonnade, then they incised deep grooves into the rock to be removed to create roughly hewn protuberances with enough margins.[63] The resulting hanging rocks that were then hewed off. They then moved into the rock deeper, and repeated the process again. After they had excavated the rock out, other artisans moved in to polish the rocks, thereafter begin the intricate carving process to create designs, motifs, friezes and other Hindu iconography. The process of producing these rock cut cave temple architecture influenced the structural Hindu temples that followed in later centuries.[63]\n\nVaraha mandapa\n\nVaraha cave temple entrance and mandapa.\n\nThe Varaha cave was excavated from a vertical wall on the west face of the main Mamallapuram hill.[64] The architecture of the temple is simple. It is a Vaishnavism-related cave temple and is famed for its four sculptures narrating Hindu legends: the Vamana-Trivikrama legend, the Varaha legend, the Durga legend and the Gajalakshmi.[65] Srinivasan and other scholars date it to the 7th century.[65][66]\n\nThe temple facade consists of two pillars and two pilasters recessed about 1.5 feet from the rock front.[64] The pillared platform leads to a mandapa and a single sanctum in the back. The base of the pillar has an oma and an adhishthana moulded into it. Their pedestals are lotus-shaped (padma pithas) that is a 2x2 feet square.[64] Above this are seated lion-faced vyalas. Their heads merge into octagonal shafts (kal) of the pillars that tapers and flows into an octogonal kalasa and tadi capital. The top phalaka is a square. The kapota above is decorated with six kudu arches. Above the kapota is a wagon-style roof topped with finials.[64]\n\nThe mandapa's rear wall has a square shrine that projects inside the rock that is slightly above the mandapa floor. On each side of this sanctum, the mandapa wall projects inwards creating two sunk in niches. At corners are pilasters with partially formed dvarapalas, and the upper planks have ganas and friezes of hamsas.[64]\n\nVaraha panel\n\nTrivikrama panel\n\nThe northern panel of the mandapa inner wall narrates the Varaha legend, where man-boar avatar of Vishnu rescues goddess earth (bhudevi) from the depths of patala waters.[64][65] This is an unusual depiction where Varaha is turned to his right instead of the typical left, affectionately holds and looks at the rescued goddess earth instead of dangling up on his tusks.[64][67] She sits near his raised knee, while the demon who created the chaotic waters is shown trampled under Varaha's raised leg. The other characters in the panel include Brahma, the Vedic sage Narada, Surya (sun), Chandra (moon), and others in the legend. The closest narration to depicted panel is found the text Vaikhanasagama.[64][67][note 6] The panel is a rectangle, all the divine characters except earth are set in a square, while the earthly yogins and prakriti-related characters are arranged outside a mandala circle, states Alice Boner.[67]\n\nThe southern panel of the mandapa narrates the Vamana-Trivikrama legend. Here, the giant transformation of Vishnu dwarf avatar is shown taking the third huge step to cover the heaven, while Bali sits below amazed. Within the panel are other characters of the legend, such as Brahma and Shiva seated on lotuses as witness.[64][68][note 7] Once again, the closest narration to the depicted panel is found the text Vaikhanasagama.[64] The Trivikrama depiction is again unusual because the Vamana part of the legend is not shown, as is usually done elsewhere in early medieval Hindu temples found in India.[68]\n\nThe Gajalakshmi panel is a square, with a geometric layout of the characters.[69]\n\nIn the niche north of the sanctum, on its back wall is Gajalakshmi, while the southern niche shows Durga. The Durga panel symbolizes Shaktism tradition, and she is also referred to as Vijaya Sri, the goddess of victory. She is shown as four armed, standing on a lotus. A warrior is shown near her, ready to sacrifice himself. Another devotee is on his knee adoring her. In the panel are scared ganas running, as well as a lion – her vahana and an antelope, medieval iconography that is commonly found in South India.[64] The Gajalakshmi is shown seated in a yoga asana on a lotus, holding two lotus buds. She is jeweled and shown wearing patra kundalas, symbolizing her link to wealth. Near her are apsaras holding auspicious jars of water and two large elephant heads, one lifting water pitcher, while the other is inverting the pitcher to spray water.[64][69] According to Alice Boner, the characters in the Gajalakshmi square panel are arranged in a circular mandala.[69]\n\nKotikal is a simple, early excavation.[70] Its facade has two pilasters. Before it are sockets which suggests that there may have been a structural mukhamandapa in front.[71] Inside the Kotikal cave temple there is an oblong shaped ardha-mandapa and a square shaped sanctum (garbha griya). The front of the sanctum in the cave has mouldings and features similar to a free standing structural temple.[71]\n\nThe sanctum door is flanked by female dvarapalas sculptures on each side.[72][71] One of these warrior women carries a sword in her right hand and a shield plate in the left, while the other one is in tribhanga pose holds a bow by the toe of her raised foot and grasps the top in her hand. Both of them wear ear rings that stand out and hang from their lobes to close to their shoulders.[71] The female guardians suggest that the deity inside the sanctum was likely intended to be Durga, the Hindu warrior goddesses.[72][70] Inside the square sanctum, there is a moonstone, adhisthana, bhitti and a kudu, but no image. One of the pillars in this cave temple has an inscription in Pallava Grantha, which translates to \"Sri Vamankusa\".[72][71] No king or elite Pallava official of this is known, and it probably means that the temple was built was a wealthy patron. According to Ramaswami, the name suggests a possible Telugu origin.[72] Srinivasan dates this to the early part of the Mahendra period.[71]\n\nDharmaraja mandapa\n\nDharmaraja cave temple, also known as Atyantakama cave temple, is on the south side of Mamallapuram hill, near the Mahishamardini cave.[73] It has a facade, mukha-mandapa and ardha-mandapa like the Kotikal mandapa. Slim tetragonal pillars create space for the two mandapa. The ardha-mandapa is raised about 3 inches above the mukha-mandapa. The facade has two pillars and two pilasters, as do the space separating the two mandapa.[73][72]\n\nThe inner hall leads into three shrine cells and these share a common adhisthana. The adhisthana has four mouldings.[72] The adhisthana is unusual in that it lacks kantha, upper kampa and the pattika, rather it just has the upana, jagati, tripatta-kumuda and the lower kampa.[73] The central sanctum is the largest dedicated to Shiva linga, and it has two male dvarapalas. The cells on the sides were dedicated to Brahma and Vishnu based on iconography, but images are now missing.[72][74]\n\nThe temple has a fourteen line Sanskrit inscription in Pallava Grantha script with an epithet.[73] According to Ramaswamy's interpretation, it attributes this cave to king Rajasimha (late 7th or early 8th century).[72] In contrast, Srinivasan and Hultzsch dates it earlier to king Paramesvara-varman I (7th century), while some other scholars assign it to the Mahendra period based on style.[73]\n\nOne of the most sophisticated and complete cave temple, the Ramanuja temple had three cells. It was excavated in the center of the main Mamallapuram hill, on its eastern scarp.[75] The temple was partially reworked on and converted centuries after it was created into a shrine for the Vaishnava scholar Ramanuja, which gives this mandapa the name. These later artisans added the six crudely cut, free-standing pillars in the front. They likely wanted to extend the mandapa.[75][76]\n\nThe Ramanuja mandapa consists of a rectangular ardha-mandapa marked out by a row of pillars.[75] On the side of its facade are two model vimanas with square rock platform. Many of the traditional Hindu temple architectural elements are found here. Inside, the main excavation starts with an adhishthana, a row of two pillars, two pilasters and three ankanas together formings its facade.[75] Behind these is an oblong mandapa with three square shrines. The side shrines were originally placed about two feet behind the central one, but all three shared a common adhisthana.[75] The entrance of the shrines once had dvarapalas, but these are now missing except for the remnants. Like other Hindu temples, this was open structure without any evidence of jambs. The back wall of the central shrine has a 5 feet square panel, which once had a Somaskanda bas relief, but much of this has been erased.[75] There is no sign of any panels in the side shrines. The ceilings of the three cells have remnants of plaster and signs that it may have been painted.[75] The walls demarcating the three shrines was removed by later artisans.[75][76]\n\nThe three cells were likely dedicated to Brahma, Shiva (center) and Vishnu. Alternatively, to three unclear forms of Shiva. The southern panel in the main mandapa likely had a Durga panel. None of these images have survived, only faint remnants are traceable because most of the wall reliefs have been chiselled off.[75] On the floor between the two pillars of the facade is a Sanskrit inscription in Pallava Grantha script praising Rudra, evidencing that the temple was originally associated with Shaivism. The florid font style and epithets in the inscription date it to the 7th century and Parameshvara Varman.[75]\n\nKoneri mandapa\n\nKoneri mandapa has five cells as shrines attached to its main hall, and is dedicated to Shiva.[77] It gets it name from the Koneri-pallam tank in front of it. The cave temple is carved in the western side of the main hill in Mamallapuram. The facade of the temple has an entablature.[78] The cornice has ten kudus, then five interconnected salas are above it. The temple has two rows of four pillars and two pilasters. The front row significantly simpler different than the one near the shrines that is intricately carved.[77][78] The pillasters are tetragonal throughout, while the pillars have essentially cylindrical plan.[77]\n\nThe five shrines have five pairs of dvarapalas. These pairs are distinct, though all figures show signs of erosion or damage. They are shown wearing yajnopavita across their chest.[77][78] The northernmost pair is damaged most, and one of them looks feminine. The second pair to the south stands with slight inclination and shows trishula like horns above their crowns, possibly a symbolism for Nandi. The third pair too shows the trishula horns, while the fourth pair looks regal with conical crown and garlands as yajnopavita. The fifth pair looks angry, with small fang-like tusks, and strong stare. The five cells are all almost square, and all are empty. Scholars have interpreted the dvarapala pairs to suggest to whom these shrines were intended for. These are the five aspects of Shiva: Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa and Īsāna.[77][78] According to Srinivasan, the Koneri mandapa is likely from the Narsimha Varman I era.[77]\n\nThe group of monuments at Mahabalipuram is a collection of 7th and 8th century religious monuments in the coastal beach resort town of Mamallapuram and a UNESCO World Heritage site.[1][2][3] It is on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, about 60 kilometres (37 mi) south of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.[1]\n\nThe site has 40 ancient monuments and Hindu temples,[4] including one of the largest open-air rock reliefs in the world, the Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna's Penance.[1][5] The site includes several categories of monuments: ratha temples with an architecture of monolith processional chariots built between 630 and 668 CE; the mandapa viharas also called cave temples with narratives from the Mahabharata, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism with inscriptions in multiple Indian languages and scripts; rock reliefs particularly bas-reliefs; stone cut structural temples built between 695 and 722 CE; and, archaeological excavations some dated to 6th century and earlier.[3][6]\n\nThe monuments were built during the Pallava Period.[2][3][7] They were referred to as Seven Pagodas in many colonial era publications, are also called the Mamallapuram temples or Mahabalipuram temples in contemporary literature. The site was restored after 1960, and has been managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.[8]\n\nLocation and nomenclature\n\nThe Mahabalipuram temples are in the southeastern part of peninsular India, in the state of Tamil Nadu. They are located about 60 kilometres (37 mi) southwest from Chennai, along the Coromandel Coast. The monuments are reachable by a four-lane divided highway (East Coast Road, SH 49 and 49A). The nearest airport is Chennai (IATA: MAA). The city is connected to the rest of India through a railway network.[9]\n\nMahabalipuram is known by several names such as Mamallapuram, where Mamalla means \"Great Wrestler\" and refers to a 7th century king Narasimha Varman I.[9][10] Other names found in historic texts, state Vora and Sundaresh, include Mamallapattana, Mavalipuram, Mavalivaram, Mavellipore, Mauvellipooram and Mahabalipur, all of which refer to \"city of great wrestler\" or \"city of Mahabali\". The latter term is related to mythical Mahabali, the demon king defeated by one of the Vishnu avatars, the dwarf Vamana.[11] An alternate proposal is by Nagaswamy, who states that the name is derived from the Tamil word \"Mallal\" which means prosperity, and reflects it being an ancient economic center of trade not only for South India but also for Southeast Asia.[12][note 1] This proposal is in part supported by a Tamil text dated to the 8th century, authored by the early Bhakti movement poet Thirumangai Alvar, where Mamallapuram is called \"Kadal Mallai\".[12][14]\n\nThe town was called the \"Seven Pagodas\" by European sailors who landed on this coast after they saw seven towers of Hindu temples.[1][15] The 7th century inscriptions refer to it as Mamallapuram or close variants, the term Mahabalipuram appears only after the 16th century and one used in colonial era literature in addition to Seven Pagodas.[16][17][note 2] In 1957, the Tamil Nadu government adopted the ancient name Mamallapuram as the official name of the site and township, and in 1964 declared Mamallapuram monuments and coastal beach region as a Special Tourism area and Health Resort.[18]\n\nHistory\n\nThe ancient history of Mahabalipuram is unclear, but numismatic and epigraphical evidence, as well as being a base of numerous temples suggests it was likely significant location before the monuments were built. Some speculative theories state that it is the same town as the seaport Sopatma mentioned in the 1st century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, alternatively that Ptolemy's port named Melange in his 2nd century Geographia is this site. Yet another theory posits that the port of Nirppeyarvu mentioned in the Perumpanarrupadai from the early centuries of the common era may be Mahabalipuram or Kanchipuram.[16][17]\n\nThe Sanskrit poet scholar Daṇḍin who lived in Tamil Nadu and was associated with the court of the Pallavas, in his Avantisundari Katha, praises artists for their exceptional repair of a Vishnu sculpture at Mamallapuram.[19] Scholars dispute whether Dandin was the author of this text.[20] Regardless of the author, the medieval Sanskrit text mentions the Mamallapuram monuments, an early tradition of repairs, and the significance of Vaishnavism.[19]\n\nA 1911 painting of a few Ratha monuments at Mahabalipuram. Tucks Oilette, the author called the site the Seven Pagodas.\n\nA 1921 photo of the Shore Temple.\n\nThe Venetian traveller Marco Polo, as he circled back from Southeast Asia and arrived in India, mentions a place he did not visit but called \"Seven Pagodas\", a name that became associated with shore temples of Mahabalipuram in publications by European merchants that followed centuries later. It entered the Catalan atlas drawn by the Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques in 1375, where the Spanish map shows \"Setemelti\" and \"Santhome\", a crude map of Asia but one accurate in the relative positions of the two ports, wherein the former now is Mamallapuram and the latter Mylapore.[21][note 3] Another Venetian traveler Gasparo Balbi in 1582 mentioned the \"Seven Pagodas\" and \"Eight Pleasant Hillocks\" which the Indian historian Nagaswamy suggests referring to these monuments.[16][17] However, Schalk disagrees and states that Balbi calls it \"Seven Pagodas of China\", and this is a re-interpretation of Henry Yule's reading of Balbi, which treated Balbi unreliable, followed it with a selective correction that it probably meant Mamallapuram.[22]\n\nSince, however the counting is done, there are now fewer than seven towers, this name has long led to speculation and argument.[23] A December 2004 Tsunami briefly exposed the beachfront near Saluvankuppam, now north of Mahabalipuram, revealing some inscriptions and structures. These were dated to the 9th century and possibly destroyed by a 13th century tsunami, states Badrinarayanan in a BBC report. The tsunami also revealed large structures on the seabed about a kilometer into the sea, which archaeologists speculate may be the more ancient Mahabalipuram.[24] According to an article in the Science magazine, the tsunami exposed rocks with \"elaborately sculpted head of an elephant and a horse in flight\", \"a small niche with a statue of a deity; another rock with a reclining lion\", and other Hindu religious iconography.[25] After the 2004 tsunami, marine archaeologists assisted by underwater diving teams have explored the site to the east of one of the monuments called the Shore Temple. This has revealed the existence of ruins of fallen walls, large number of rectangular blocks and other structures running parallel to the shore, in addition to the forty surviving monuments.[16][14]\n\nModern era reports\n\nThe European sailors and merchants who pioneered the modern era trade to Asia after the 16th century mention the site. The early reports such as those by Niccolao Manucci, who never visited the site, but viewed the monuments at a distance and heard about them, confused the Chinese and Burmese Buddhist pagoda designs he had previously seen with features in the Hindu temples and assumed that the temples were built by the Chinese.[21] Anthony Hamilton published an account of \"East Indies\" in 1727 that says it was a pilgrimage center and called its outside sculpture as \"obscene, lewd\" as any in the performances at the Drury Lane. The French writer Pierre Sonnerat, in contrast, was critical of European writing and racism directed at Indians and speculated that the Mahabalipuram temples must be very old.[21]\n\nThe 1788 scholarly survey report of the Mahabalipuram by William Chambers brought these monuments to the attention of scholars in Europe.[26] Chambers interviewed the locals, and linked the art on the monuments he saw to Hindu texts, calling it remarkable and expressive in its narrative detail.[27] A series of systematic studies that prepared sketches of the monuments and collected impressions of the inscriptions followed in the 19th century, such as those by Benjamin Babington and William Elliot.[28] Some of the stories and speculations in the Western literature, nevertheless, continued to be unusual. For example, Francis Wilford in 1809 suggested that the monuments were built in 450 BCE, linking them to Cicero's writings about Indian Hercules names Bolus or Baladeva who he claimed may have built three ancient Indian temple cities including the Mahabalipura.[27]\n\nWestern scholarship on Mahabalipuram monuments started with 1788 report by William Chambers. Above (clockwise): 19th century sketches of Hindu deities in a mandala, a lion statue, entrance of cave temple and a rock relief.[21]\n\nThe 19th-century reports summarize their survey of natives with a mention of \"gilt tops of many pagodas\" in the surf at sunrise that their grandfather used to talk about but can no longer be seen.[27] In late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Mahabalipuram site was largely the focus of colonial era tourist guides and speculations. Parts of many monuments were covered with sand, and little was done to preserve the site.[29] After Indian independence from the colonial British Empire, the state of Tamil Nadu redeveloped the Mamallapuram monuments and coastal beach region as a archaeological, tourism and pilgrimage site by improving the road networks and town infrastructure. In 1984, the site was reviewed by a panel of experts and declared as a UNESCO World Heritage site, under four categories under criteria of i, ii, iii and iv.[3][7]\n\nThe site has re-emerged as an archaeological site since 1990, where excavations have yielded unexpected discoveries. For example, states John Marr, the site has revealed \"an apsidal-shaped tank, its curved end aligned south towards the middle portion of the Shore Temple\" with the Anantasayana (reclining Vishnu), which likely predates the Shore Temple.[30]\n\nChronology: Pallava construction\n\nThe town of Mamallapuram became prominent during the Pallava period, starting with the reign of Simhavishnu in the last decades of the sixth century CE, a period of political competition with the Pandyas, the Cheras and the Cholas, as well as one of spiritual ferment with the rise of Bhakti movement poet scholars between 6th and 8th century, the Vaishnava Alvars and Shaiva Nayanars. The architectural history of Mamallapuram site is linked to Simhavishnu's son Mahendravarman I (600-630 CE), who was a patron of arts. His son Narsimha Varman I built upon the early efforts of his father, and many of the monuments are attributed to him by most scholars. After a brief hiatus, the building of novel temples and monuments continued during the reign of Rajasimha, or Narasimhavarman II (690-728 CE).[31][3]\n\nThe mid 20th century archaeologist A. H. Longhurst described the Pallava Architecture, including those found at Mahabalipuram monuments into four chronological periods: Mahendra style (610-640 CE), Mamalla style (640-670 CE, refers to Narasimhavarman I), Rajasimha style (674-800 CE) and Nandivarman style (800-900 CE). K.R. Srinivasan described it as reflecting three styles and stages of construction, calling the third period as the Paramesvara style.[32]\n\nThe chronology has been a subject of scholarly disagreement. Some scholars such as Marilyn Hirsh in 1987 have stated that the earliest temples are traceable to about 600 CE in the reign of poet and artist king Mahendravarman.[33] A few, such as Nagaswamy in 1962, have stated that it was King Rajasimha (690-728 CE) who is the likely patron of many of the monuments because many temple inscription have one of his names, as well as his distinctive Pallava Grantha and ornate Nagari scripts.[32]\n\n1808 map of Mahabalipuram monuments. In the center is the main hill with the cave temples, the Shore temple is near the protuberance on coastline while others monuments are within a few kilometers of the main hill.[34]\n\nOne of the evidences that favors dating some of the Mamallapuram monuments to early 7th century is the Mandagapattu inscription (Laksitayana inscription) of Mahendravarman I (580/600-630 CE). The inscription states that he \"brought into existence a temple without utilizing either timber or lime (mortar) or brick or metal\", and that the temple was dedicated to \"Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva\".[35][36] This was the first Pallava rock-derived Hindu temple, and there is no reason to assume that Mahendravarman I and his descendants stopped and waited for nearly 70 years to build the next. Further, states Mate and other scholars, the inscription implies that the Tamil people already had a pre-6th century temple construction tradition, albeit one based on the materials Mahendravarman I mentions.[35] The Mandagapattu inscription is not isolated, and additional inscriptions of Mahendravarman I relating to cave temples have been discovered across his kingdom.[33][37] Further evidence is in the form of cave temples such as Undavalli Caves which predate the Mamallapuram cave temples, suggesting that the ancient Indian artisans had already begun exploring cave architecture before the Pallava period.[35]\n\nThe various monuments at Mamallapuram are generally dated by scholars over the 7th and 8th century.[1][2]\n\nDescription\n\nThe ratha temples are one of the many monuments at Mamallapuram. Above: A 1913 photo of the five rathas group.\n\nThe monuments at Mahabalipuram present a fusion of religion, culture, and legends, all related to the Hindu religious pantheon.[38][21] They are different expressions through rock or inside boulders, albeit on a grand scale, integrating the nature and in the form of architectural sculpture. The site has about forty monuments to varying degrees of completion, and these are categorized into five:[3][39]\n\nAmong the major ones, there are ten rathas, ten mandapas, two rock bas reliefs and three structural temples.[40] The plan of the monuments is predominantly based on square and circle principle, or stacked squares to produce rectangles. The reliefs, the sculptures and the architecture weaves in ideas and deities of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism with equal reverence, though each monument is dedicated to a primary deity or a famed character in Hindu mythology or Epic.[41][42][43] The Mamallapuram monuments are also a source of many Sanskrit inscriptions from the 7th and 8th century with insights into the history, culture, kingship and religiosity of South India.[44]\n\nRatha temples\n\nThe Ratha Temples are monuments carved in the shape of processional chariots in the southern part of the town. The artists used the naturally occurring blocks of diorite and granite in sand, carving legends as monoliths in stone.[3] The most famed ones are the five monolithic structures which project above the sandy beach. These are called the five Rathas, alternatively as the Pandava Rathas (Pandavas were five brothers and their common wife Draupadi of the epic Mahabharata). Though the symbolism and grouped structure of these temples has led to this popular name, these are neither true rathas nor are they dedicated to the Pandavas. They are temples dedicated to deities and ideas in Shaivism (Shiva), Vaishnavism (Vishnu) and Shaktism (Durga) traditions of Hinduism.[45] These rathas are dated to the 7th century.[3]\n\nThe five ratha group is cardinally oriented in the north-south axis, with the Dharmaraja ratha in the south, Bhima ratha next to it to its north, followed by Arjuna and Draupadi rathas sharing a common platform and further north.[45] There is a lion to the west of Arjuna-Draupadi platform, a seated bull to their east, and a standing elephant on their southwest. The Nakula and Sahadeva ratha is to the northwest of Bhima ratha, and southwest of Arjuna ratha behind the standing elephant. The center cross sectional axis of the Nakula and Sahadeva ratha is in the middle of the group.[45] All of the temples have a west entrance except Nakula-Sahadeva ratha which has a south entrance.[45]\n\nAll Mamallapuram rathas share some common elements. Each is placed on a moulded plinth with or without ganas, states George Michell, and above this plinth the \"walls divide rhythmically into a number of projections and recesses between pilasters\" thereby producing niches.[46] Within these niches are placed sculptures. Those images the artisans considered significant, to them they added makaras at the brackets. Above these they added overhanging eve, in which they sometimes depicted peering human faces as if they are sitting inside the ratha.[46] Then they added additional mouldings till the parapet. The upper level either rhythmically repeated at a reduced level the lower level design, or they capped the superstructure with curved roofs. A combination of these ideas created a veritable catalog of memorable architectonic designs.[46]\n\nThe Dharmaraja ratha: overview, section and plan.\n\nDharmaraja ratha\n\nThe Dharmaraja ratha[note 4] has a square plan within a rectangular frame (26.75 ft x 20.67 ft) and is 35.67 feet high.[47][48] It has an open porch supported by pillars. Its pyramidal tower consists of a vimana of symmetrically shrinking squares capped by an octagonal shikara. There is evidence that it had or intended to have a finial, but that is missing. The pillars have seated lions at its base. It has three levels, the lowest is solid (probably never carved out), while the upper two have shrines.[47][49] The two upper levels are connected by a stair carved into the stone. The middle level has two shrines, while the uppermost has one. The ratha temple walls have carvings and inscriptions. One inscription mentions Narasimhavarman I. The western side of the top storey has a Somaskanda image. The entablature integrates the secular with the divine, where human faces peep out of the kudu arches of the chariot. An Amaravati motif is carved below the cornice.[47][49]\n\nAt the ground level, the sides aligned to the procession's length have four pillars, while the other two have two pillars and two pilasters. Each corner at the ground level has sides with two niches, wherein figures are carved in, shown as if waving to the crowd. The deities shown on the ground level are Ardhanarishvara (half Parvati, half Shiva), Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), Brahma, Skanda, Bhairava (Shiva) and two other unclear forms of Shiva.[47] The upper mid level has carvings that show various aspects of Shiva and Vishnu, suggesting that the artists revered both traditions of Hinduism.[50][49] Included on this level are Nataraja (dancing Shiva), Vinadhara (Shiv with Vina), Gangadhara (Shiva bringing Ganges from heaven to earth), Vrishbhantika (Shiva with Nandi), Kankalamurti, Chandesa and Vishnu.[47][51]\n\nThe uppermost level has carvings of Dakshinamurti (Shiva as guru or teacher), Surya and Chandra.[47][51][49]\n\nThe Somaskanda panel in this ratha temple is significant because it has been one of the reasons for dating this temple to early 7th century. The Somaskanda depicted is quite different than those created in Rajasimha period, and looks similar to those created the early Pallava period.[45]\n\nBhima ratha\n\nBhima ratha is the most massive of the five rathas.[52]\n\nThe Bhima ratha is massive, follows the Dharmaraja ratha and has a roof that looks like a vaulted barrel, reminding one of wood work.[52][note 5] The ratha is 46 feet long and about 25 feet high and wide. Its interior is incomplete and likely intended for reclining Vishnu (Anantasayana).[52][54] Unlike the other ratha which have inscriptions and sculptures, this has none. Its vimana is intricately carved on both sides of the roof. The cornice has seven pairs of kudus (Sanskrit: gavaksha).[52] Above it are alternating salas and kutas forming thirteen small vimanas. Above this layer are five grivas carved into shrine like niche flanked by small pilasters. The two on each side are all the same size, the middle one is the biggest. There is structural evidence on the top that there were eighteen kalasas there and likely two tridents, but these are all missing now.[52][55]\n\nThis ratha too has an embedded square plan, states Ramaswami, upto the entablature.[52] It integrates in the griva and the shikara in the form of circle. The long side has four round pillars and two rounded pilasters with the base designed as seated lions. The north and south sides have two pillars each, but these are square and massive.[52] The roof has crack lines which may have been caused by structural elements or from centuries of weathering such as lightning.[52]\n\nThe Arjuna ratha follows Bhima ratha and is also incomplete. It is one of the larger monuments but about six times smaller in area than the Dharmaraja ratha.[56][45] It has two levels and has one shrine. It is also square in plan. In many ways, it rhythmically mirrors the Dharmaraja ratha. For example, the decoration and structure of cornice, kudus and the haras are similar.[56] The shikhara of the Arjuna ratha, however, is hexagonal.[45] The walls of the ratha are carved into panels with fourteen sculptures. Four of these are dvarapalas, one Vishnu, a rishi (sage) with a student, a Kartikeya (Murugan) which could alternatively be Indra, one Shiva with Nandi, and the rest are human beings shown in different stages of their life including couples.[56] The Arjuna ratha has a lion and Nandi bull on each side between it and the Draupadi ratha that follows next, but their orientation suggests that this ratha was not meant for Shiva.[45] According to Susan Huntington, it is unclear for whom this temple was meant and she states it could be Ayyappa (Dharma-shasta).[45] The tower consists of a round shikara. The monument looks odd on its side, partly because its original pillars were lost and have been replaced with modern era restorative pillars that do not fit with the texture or style of the original creation.[56] There is a standing elephant to the northwest of the Arjuna ratha.[57][45]\n\nThe Draupadi ratha is a small 11 feet by 11 feet square stone structure north of Arjuna ratha, and they share the platform.[56] It is dedicated , whose image is carved on the rear wall. It looks like a wooden hut with a curvilinear roof. There is a carved structure with alternating lions and elephants. The shrine deity is missing.[56][45] The design is a highly simplified form of Nagara style Hindu temple. It has reliefs showing Durga, three of her images are on the outer walls and she is also shown on one of the inside walls. The east facing Durga is her Mahishasuramardini form with the head of buffalo demon. Elsewhere, with her are depicted devotees, makaras (mythical sea creatures) and ganas (mythical, comical dwarfs).[58]\n\nThe Nakula-Sahadeva ratha and standing elephant.\n\nNakula and Sahadeva ratha\n\nThe Nakula-Sahadeva ratha is another incomplete monument. It is an apsidal temple, a relatively uncommon design in Hinduism but found in Aihole and other parts of India.[57] The temple is a Vesara design, 16 feet high and 18 feet long. The temple is two storeyed, it has kutas and salas like the others, but is unique in that it includes panjaras. It is unclear which deity it may have been intended, with hypothesis ranging from Kartikeya, Brahma, Ayyappa and Indra.[57][45] To the northeast of the Nakula and Sahadeva is a standing elephant and Arjuna ratha.[31]\n\nOther rathas\n\nThe Ganesha ratha, likely it became a model for gopuras found in later Tamil temples.\n\nOther ratha monuments at Mahabalipuram include the late 7th century Ganesha Ratha, attributed to Parameshvara-varman I, the grandson of Mahamalla.[59][60]\n\nThe Ganesha ratha is located a kilometer from the Pancha rathas. It is next to and north of Descent of the Ganges bas relief and south of Krishna's butter ball monument. The Ganesha ratha is small but similar to Bhima ratha and has two storeys.[61] It is 19 feet long, 11.25 feet wide and 28 feet high. This monument has survived without much damage. The first storey includes 5 mini-vimanas, while the second storey features 4 mini-vimanas, each pattern repeating in overall and integral levels. The sala has nine kalasas, and one end has a trishula on the top just like churches have a cross. The temple's facade has two pillars and two pilasters.[61] The base of these columns are shaped like seated lions, the middle is chamfered topped off with the fluted capital.[61] On the sides of the entrance mandapa are two standing dvarapalas with welcoming bent heads. The temple wall has an inscription which suggests that this is also a 7th century monument. Inside the sanctum is a Ganesha statue, but according to Ramaswami, this may have been added in later.[61]\n\nElsewhere, the Mamallapuram monuments group has two Pidari rathas and a Valayankuttai ratha, which are two storeyed monuments and all incomplete.[61] They are significant because one Pidari ratha and one Valayankuttai ratha are modelled in North Indian Nagara style architecture, while the second Pidari ratha has a South Indian Dravida style architecture.[61]\n\nMandapas\n\nMandapa is a Sanskrit term for a vestibule, pillared hall or a pavilion typically a square.[62] These were spaces for people to gather socially, usually for ceremonies and rites-of-passage rituals. Often cells or sanctum(s) would be included with these, creating a vihara. The term mandapa also refers to rock-cut cave temples, also called rock shrines, built around the same concept. Mamallapuram has many mandapas or cave temples.[3] They are dated to the 7th and 8th century.[31]\n\nThe Mamallapuram cave temples are incomplete and this has made them a significant source of scholarly information about how cave monuments were excavated and built in 7th century India.[63] Segments of the caves show that artisans worked with the architects to first mark off the colonnade, then they incised deep grooves into the rock to be removed to create roughly hewn protuberances with enough margins.[63] The resulting hanging rocks that were then hewed off. They then moved into the rock deeper, and repeated the process again. After they had excavated the rock out, other artisans moved in to polish the rocks, thereafter begin the intricate carving process to create designs, motifs, friezes and other Hindu iconography. The process of producing these rock cut cave temple architecture influenced the structural Hindu temples that followed in later centuries.[63]\n\nVaraha mandapa\n\nVaraha cave temple entrance and mandapa.\n\nThe Varaha cave was excavated from a vertical wall on the west face of the main Mamallapuram hill.[64] The architecture of the temple is simple. It is a Vaishnavism-related cave temple and is famed for its four sculptures narrating Hindu legends: the Vamana-Trivikrama legend, the Varaha legend, the Durga legend and the Gajalakshmi.[65] Srinivasan and other scholars date it to the 7th century.[65][66]\n\nThe temple facade consists of two pillars and two pilasters recessed about 1.5 feet from the rock front.[64] The pillared platform leads to a mandapa and a single sanctum in the back. The base of the pillar has an oma and an adhishthana moulded into it. Their pedestals are lotus-shaped (padma pithas) that is a 2x2 feet square.[64] Above this are seated lion-faced vyalas. Their heads merge into octagonal shafts (kal) of the pillars that tapers and flows into an octogonal kalasa and tadi capital. The top phalaka is a square. The kapota above is decorated with six kudu arches. Above the kapota is a wagon-style roof topped with finials.[64]\n\nThe mandapa's rear wall has a square shrine that projects inside the rock that is slightly above the mandapa floor. On each side of this sanctum, the mandapa wall projects inwards creating two sunk in niches. At corners are pilasters with partially formed dvarapalas, and the upper planks have ganas and friezes of hamsas.[64]\n\nVaraha panel\n\nTrivikrama panel\n\nThe northern panel of the mandapa inner wall narrates the Varaha legend, where man-boar avatar of Vishnu rescues goddess earth (bhudevi) from the depths of patala waters.[64][65] This is an unusual depiction where Varaha is turned to his right instead of the typical left, affectionately holds and looks at the rescued goddess earth instead of dangling up on his tusks.[64][67] She sits near his raised knee, while the demon who created the chaotic waters is shown trampled under Varaha's raised leg. The other characters in the panel include Brahma, the Vedic sage Narada, Surya (sun), Chandra (moon), and others in the legend. The closest narration to depicted panel is found the text Vaikhanasagama.[64][67][note 6] The panel is a rectangle, all the divine characters except earth are set in a square, while the earthly yogins and prakriti-related characters are arranged outside a mandala circle, states Alice Boner.[67]\n\nThe southern panel of the mandapa narrates the Vamana-Trivikrama legend. Here, the giant transformation of Vishnu dwarf avatar is shown taking the third huge step to cover the heaven, while Bali sits below amazed. Within the panel are other characters of the legend, such as Brahma and Shiva seated on lotuses as witness.[64][68][note 7] Once again, the closest narration to the depicted panel is found the text Vaikhanasagama.[64] The Trivikrama depiction is again unusual because the Vamana part of the legend is not shown, as is usually done elsewhere in early medieval Hindu temples found in India.[68]\n\nThe Gajalakshmi panel is a square, with a geometric layout of the characters.[69]\n\nIn the niche north of the sanctum, on its back wall is Gajalakshmi, while the southern niche shows Durga. The Durga panel symbolizes Shaktism tradition, and she is also referred to as Vijaya Sri, the goddess of victory. She is shown as four armed, standing on a lotus. A warrior is shown near her, ready to sacrifice himself. Another devotee is on his knee adoring her. In the panel are scared ganas running, as well as a lion – her vahana and an antelope, medieval iconography that is commonly found in South India.[64] The Gajalakshmi is shown seated in a yoga asana on a lotus, holding two lotus buds. She is jeweled and shown wearing patra kundalas, symbolizing her link to wealth. Near her are apsaras holding auspicious jars of water and two large elephant heads, one lifting water pitcher, while the other is inverting the pitcher to spray water.[64][69] According to Alice Boner, the characters in the Gajalakshmi square panel are arranged in a circular mandala.[69]\n\nKotikal is a simple, early excavation.[70] Its facade has two pilasters. Before it are sockets which suggests that there may have been a structural mukhamandapa in front.[71] Inside the Kotikal cave temple there is an oblong shaped ardha-mandapa and a square shaped sanctum (garbha griya). The front of the sanctum in the cave has mouldings and features similar to a free standing structural temple.[71]\n\nThe sanctum door is flanked by female dvarapalas sculptures on each side.[72][71] One of these warrior women carries a sword in her right hand and a shield plate in the left, while the other one is in tribhanga pose holds a bow by the toe of her raised foot and grasps the top in her hand. Both of them wear ear rings that stand out and hang from their lobes to close to their shoulders.[71] The female guardians suggest that the deity inside the sanctum was likely intended to be Durga, the Hindu warrior goddesses.[72][70] Inside the square sanctum, there is a moonstone, adhisthana, bhitti and a kudu, but no image. One of the pillars in this cave temple has an inscription in Pallava Grantha, which translates to \"Sri Vamankusa\".[72][71] No king or elite Pallava official of this is known, and it probably means that the temple was built was a wealthy patron. According to Ramaswami, the name suggests a possible Telugu origin.[72] Srinivasan dates this to the early part of the Mahendra period.[71]\n\nDharmaraja mandapa\n\nDharmaraja cave temple, also known as Atyantakama cave temple, is on the south side of Mamallapuram hill, near the Mahishamardini cave.[73] It has a facade, mukha-mandapa and ardha-mandapa like the Kotikal mandapa. Slim tetragonal pillars create space for the two mandapa. The ardha-mandapa is raised about 3 inches above the mukha-mandapa. The facade has two pillars and two pilasters, as do the space separating the two mandapa.[73][72]\n\nThe inner hall leads into three shrine cells and these share a common adhisthana. The adhisthana has four mouldings.[72] The adhisthana is unusual in that it lacks kantha, upper kampa and the pattika, rather it just has the upana, jagati, tripatta-kumuda and the lower kampa.[73] The central sanctum is the largest dedicated to Shiva linga, and it has two male dvarapalas. The cells on the sides were dedicated to Brahma and Vishnu based on iconography, but images are now missing.[72][74]\n\nThe temple has a fourteen line Sanskrit inscription in Pallava Grantha script with an epithet.[73] According to Ramaswamy's interpretation, it attributes this cave to king Rajasimha (late 7th or early 8th century).[72] In contrast, Srinivasan and Hultzsch dates it earlier to king Paramesvara-varman I (7th century), while some other scholars assign it to the Mahendra period based on style.[73]\n\nOne of the most sophisticated and complete cave temple, the Ramanuja temple had three cells. It was excavated in the center of the main Mamallapuram hill, on its eastern scarp.[75] The temple was partially reworked on and converted centuries after it was created into a shrine for the Vaishnava scholar Ramanuja, which gives this mandapa the name. These later artisans added the six crudely cut, free-standing pillars in the front. They likely wanted to extend the mandapa.[75][76]\n\nThe Ramanuja mandapa consists of a rectangular ardha-mandapa marked out by a row of pillars.[75] On the side of its facade are two model vimanas with square rock platform. Many of the traditional Hindu temple architectural elements are found here. Inside, the main excavation starts with an adhishthana, a row of two pillars, two pilasters and three ankanas together formings its facade.[75] Behind these is an oblong mandapa with three square shrines. The side shrines were originally placed about two feet behind the central one, but all three shared a common adhisthana.[75] The entrance of the shrines once had dvarapalas, but these are now missing except for the remnants. Like other Hindu temples, this was open structure without any evidence of jambs. The back wall of the central shrine has a 5 feet square panel, which once had a Somaskanda bas relief, but much of this has been erased.[75] There is no sign of any panels in the side shrines. The ceilings of the three cells have remnants of plaster and signs that it may have been painted.[75] The walls demarcating the three shrines was removed by later artisans.[75][76]\n\nThe three cells were likely dedicated to Brahma, Shiva (center) and Vishnu. Alternatively, to three unclear forms of Shiva. The southern panel in the main mandapa likely had a Durga panel. None of these images have survived, only faint remnants are traceable because most of the wall reliefs have been chiselled off.[75] On the floor between the two pillars of the facade is a Sanskrit inscription in Pallava Grantha script praising Rudra, evidencing that the temple was originally associated with Shaivism. The florid font style and epithets in the inscription date it to the 7th century and Parameshvara Varman.[75]\n\nKoneri mandapa\n\nKoneri mandapa has five cells as shrines attached to its main hall, and is dedicated to Shiva.[77] It gets it name from the Koneri-pallam tank in front of it. The cave temple is carved in the western side of the main hill in Mamallapuram. The facade of the temple has an entablature.[78] The cornice has ten kudus, then five interconnected salas are above it. The temple has two rows of four pillars and two pilasters. The front row significantly simpler different than the one near the shrines that is intricately carved.[77][78] The pillasters are tetragonal throughout, while the pillars have essentially cylindrical plan.[77]\n\nThe five shrines have five pairs of dvarapalas. These pairs are distinct, though all figures show signs of erosion or damage. They are shown wearing yajnopavita across their chest.[77][78] The northernmost pair is damaged most, and one of them looks feminine. The second pair to the south stands with slight inclination and shows trishula like horns above their crowns, possibly a symbolism for Nandi. The third pair too shows the trishula horns, while the fourth pair looks regal with conical crown and garlands as yajnopavita. The fifth pair looks angry, with small fang-like tusks, and strong stare. The five cells are all almost square, and all are empty. Scholars have interpreted the dvarapala pairs to suggest to whom these shrines were intended for. These are the five aspects of Shiva: Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa and Īsāna.[77][78] According to Srinivasan, the Koneri mandapa is likely from the Narsimha Varman I era.[77]\n\nThillai Natarajah Temple, Chidambaram or Chidambaram temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located in the town of Chidambaram, East-Central Tamil Nadu, South India. The temple is known as the foremost of all temples (Kovil) to Saivites and has influenced worship, architecture, sculpture and performance art for over two millennium. The Sangam classics list chief architect Viduvelvidugu Perumthachchan as directing an early renovation of the shrine.\n\nA major shrine of Lord Shiva worship since the classical period, there have been several renovations and offerings to Chidambaram by the Pallava, Chola, Pandya, Vijayanagara and Chera royals in the ancient and pre-medieval periods. The temple as it stands now is mainly of the 12th and 13th centuries, with later additions in similar style. Its bronze statues and stone sculptures depicting various deities and the famous Thillai trees (Excoecaria agallocha) of the surrounding forest reflect the highpoints of early Chola and Pallava art while its famed gold plated gopuram towers are medieval structural additions by the royals Aditya I, Parantaka Chola I, Kopperunchinga I, Krishnadevaraya and Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan. King Kocengannan Chola was born following prayers his parents offered at the temple and later in his life he refined its structure. The shrine gave the town its name.\n\nThe deity that presides here is கூத்தன் - Thillai Koothan (Thillai Nataraja - Shiva, The Lord of Dance). Chidambaram is the birthplace of the sculpture and bronze image representation of Lord Shiva as the cosmic dancer, a Tamilian concept and motif in Chola art that has since become notable as a symbol of Hinduism. The shrine is the only Shiva temple to have its main deity represented in this anthropomorphic form, as the supreme being who performs all cosmic activities. The consort deity here is Sivakami Amman (form of Amman - mother goddess and female energy). Two other forms of Lord Shiva are represented close to this in the vimana (inner sanctum) of the temple - as a crystallised lingam - the most common representation of Lord Shiva in temples, and as the aether space classical element, represented with empty space and a garland of fifty one hanging golden bilvam leaves (Aegle marmelos). Lord Shiva is captured in pose as Nataraja performing the Ananda Tandava (\"Dance of Delight\") in the golden hall of the shrine Pon Ambalam (பொன் அம்பலம்). The sculptures of Chidambaram inspired the postures of Bharatha Natyam. The Chidambaram complex is admired for its five famous halls (ambalam or sabhai), several grand smaller shrines to the Hindu deities Ganesh, Murugan, Vishnu and Sivakami Amman which contain Pandyan and Nayak architectural styles, and for its endowment from many water tanks, one of which links it to the Thillai Kali temple.\n\nChidambaram is one of the five Pancha Bootha Sthalams, the holiest Shiva temples each representing one of the five classical elements; Chidambaram represents akasha (aether). Chidambaram is glorified in Tirumular's Tirumandhiram and was visited by Patañjali and VyagjrapadharPulikaal Munivar. It is the primary shrine of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams - Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Tevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar saints Tirunavukkarasar, Thirugnana Sambandar and Sundarar. Hailed in the Tiruvacakam series by Manikkavacakar, these very volumes of the Tirumurai literature canon were themselves found in secret chambers of the temple. The Periya Puranam, a biography of these Nayanar saints by Sekkizhar commissioned by emperor Kulothunga Chola II, was written in the shrine's Thousand Pillared Hall. In Kanda Puranam, the epic authored by Kachiyappa Sivachariar of Kanchipuram, the Chidambaram shrine is venerated as one of the three foremost Shiva abodes in the world, alongside Koneswaram temple of Trincomalee and Mount Kailash.\n\nETYMOLOGY\n\nThe traditional name of the temple complex, Chidambaram Tillai Nataraja-koothan Kovil, alludes to the environment of its location and its origins and significance in Saivite worship. The mangrove of ancient Tillai (தில்லை) trees (Exocoeria agallocha) of the forest surrounding the shrine when it was first built inspired the shrine's name and early artistic inspiration; the Tillai trees of the nearby Pichavaram wetlands, the second largest mangrove in the world, extends to the temple area. The shrine is venerated as Tillai ambalam (தில்லை அம்பலம் ), literally meaning Tillai Open Stage, the open space surrounded by Tillai Vanam (தில்லை வனம்) (the Tillai forest) - the original name of this area.[9] The name of the town of this shrine, Chidambaram comes from the Tamil word Chitrambalam (சிற்றம்பலம்) - \"small hall/stage\"; also spelled Chithambalam (சிட்டம்பலம்), from citt/chitthu and ambalam - meaning \"wisdom of this open stage/atmosphere\". The shrine is where some devotees believe they will "
