        "text": "Indian classical music is generally divided into two major genres: Hindustani music from North India and Carnatic music rooted in South India. Nowadays, Hindustani music is mainly practiced in North India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Hindustani music has evolved from time to time through influences of Persian, Arabic, and other cultures. Carnatic classical music is mainly practiced in the southern regions of India; Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Sri Lanka.\n\nCarnatic music dates back thousands of years. The music is enriched with a vast range of rhythm, vocal techniques, and classical instruments. Carnatic music is deeply rooted in the cultural and spiritual traditions of India. Still, it has played a pivotal role in the country’s history and heritage. The ideology behind this style of music is to address the great actions of Hindu gods and goddesses and to convey the lessons that we can learn from their great actions. Some of the music conveys a great sense of religious devotion.\n\nThe art of listening Carnatic music is a unique experience, and it requires a certain level of knowledge, understanding of the music structure, and endearment of music. Unlike western music, this type of music cannot be easily accessible or immediately enjoyable. This form of music is quite complex and sophisticated art form which requires active listening, a willingness to explore, and the engagement of the listener. The structure of music places a strong emphasis on vocal music, with the majority of compositions being written to be sung. The music is intended to be performed in a singing style, even when played on instruments.\n\nCarnatic music is more rhythmically oriented and mainly performed on the string instruments (veena, mandolin, violin) and the wind instruments(Venu, Nadaswaram), Mridangam, Ghatam, Thavil, Idakka, etc.\n\nThe fundamental aspects of Carnatic music include adherence to a specific structural framework embodying ragas (melodic scales) and talas( rhythmic patterns) that can create a classical dance, as well as the performer’s improvisation. These ragas and talas are associated with emotions, moods and profoundly related to mantra rhythms. According to Hindu philosophy, rhythmic mantras can shape a person’s perspective, elevate positive vigor, and inculcate a greater sense of calm and self-awareness.\n\nTo fully appreciate this form of music, it is extremely essential to actively listen to the various elements of music, such as the rhythm, melody, nuances of music, and subtle differences between each variation of the ragas and talas.\n\nListen for the way the musician explores different variations of the raga and tala and how they use their instrument to create different tones and moods. This music is designed to challenge the listener and push the boundaries as far as possible. Another salient aspect of listening to Carnatic music is understanding the cultural and spiritual context of the music. This can deepen the understanding of music and enhance the appreciation of its beauty and complexity. It can be helpful to learn about the history and traditions of the music, as well as the different ragas and talas that are used in different contexts.\n\nSince the 1960s, Carnatic musicians have been combining Carnatic music with other forms, especially western music. It is called “fusion Carnatic music” and gained momentum in the 1990s with the emergence of several prominent artists who brought their own unique influences to the genre. The pure Carnatic music is considered as “Devotional Music “ and the lyrics composition are poetry recitations.\n\nRenowned artists have been composing Carnatic music by seamlessly blending different styles and genres while retaining the core elements of traditional Carnatic music.\n\nThe incorporation of Western harmonies, chords, and rhythms into Carnatic compositions has led to the creation of a new sound that is both innovative and captivating. Fusion Carnatic music has also played a significant role in expanding the audience for Carnatic music beyond its traditional base. By blending Carnatic music with other forms of music, Fusion Carnatic music has attracted a diverse audience, including young people who have never been exposed to Carnatic music before.\n\nOne of the challenges for Carnatic music is to strike a balance between traditional aspects of music and new fusion genres incorporated into classical pieces. Some argue that this fusion dilutes the purity of classical works and is essential to preserve the authenticity of the music. However, the culture should be evolving with time and should allow for innovation and evolution in the music that respects its roots and traditions while also keeping it relevant and accessible for future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, the art of listening to Carnatic classical music is a unique and rewarding experience that requires an open mind, a willingness to explore, and a deep appreciation for the intricate nature of melody and improvisation. By actively engaging with the music, listeners can gain a deeper appreciation for the beauty and complexity of this ancient and sophisticated art form while discerning the cultural background and religious depth of southern Indian people."
