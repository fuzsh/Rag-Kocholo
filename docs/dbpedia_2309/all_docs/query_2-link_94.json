        "text": "A Swara is a tone or a musical note on an octave. Swara is actually a Sanskrit word. It refers to the ancient Indian concept which is about the complete dimension of the musical pitch. There are seven Swaras in Carnatic classical music / Carnatic music. These seven Swaras are also called Sapta Swaras. They are Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni. These are actually the short forms of the swaras. Sa is the short form of Shadja, Re is the short form of Rishaba, Ga is the short form of Gandhara, Ma is the short form of Madhyama, Pa is the short form of Panchama, Dha is the short form of Dhaivat and Ni is the short form of Nishada. These seven Swaras actually build up Hindustani Classical Music and Carnatic Classical Music. The swaras are also the fundamentals of a raga.\n\nORIGIN OF SAPTA SWARAS\n\nIt is believed that swaras actually originated from the sounds of animals and birds. Shadja which is Sa is believed to have originated from the sound of the peacock which it makes when it sees clouds of rain in the sky. Rishaba which is Re is believed to have originated from the sound of roaring of a cow when it gets separated from her calf. Gandhara which is Ga is said to have originated from goat bleating when they are in the flock. Madhyama, which is Ma, is said to have originated from the cry of a Heron. Panchama which is Pa is said to have originated from the sound of a Nightingale that it makes during spring. Dhaivata which is Dha is said to have originated from horse neighing. Nishada which is Ni is said to have originated from the trumpeting of an elephant.\n\nSAPTA SWARAS AND THEIR RELATION TO WESTERN MUSICAL NOTES\n\nThere Sapta Swaras are believed to be equivalent to the Western Solfege which is Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, and Ti. Shadja which is Sa and means Six in Sanskrit matches with Do in Western Music. These are the first musical notes which generate the other 6 notes. Rishaba which is Re matches with the Re in Western Music. Gandhara which is Ga matches with Mi in Western Music. Madhyama in Sanskrit means middle as this is actually the mid- portion of the Sapta Swaras. Thus Madhyama which is Ma matches with Fa in Western Music. Panchama which is Pa in Sanskrit means Fifth and this matches with So in Western Music. Dhaivata which is Dha matches with La in Western Music. Nishada which is Ni matches with Ti in Western Music.\n\nSAPTA SWARAS IN CARNATIC MUSIC\n\nThe Sapta Swaras in Carnatic Music are Sa, Ri, Ga,Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni. These are also called the Solfege of Carnatic Music. Each member of the Swara has three variants. However there are exceptions to this. In the case of Shadja and Panchama, they have only one variant and Madhyama has two variants. In Tamil Nadu there exists a 7th century stone inscription at KudumiyanMalai which actually shows the vowel changes to the Solfege symbols. For example Re to Ra, Ri,Ru, etc. This is done in order to indicate the higher quarter notes. In a scale or raga there is only one variant of each note that is present. There is however an exception to this in the case of light ragas.\n\nTHE SAPTA SWARAS :\n\nSHADJA (SA)\n\nShadja is the first swara in classical music. This swara is also called Sadja. Shadja is the long form for Sa. It is the first swara in an octave or a Saptak. Shadja is also a basic swara which is very fundamental in classical music.This swara is played on the Tanpura for the singer so that they know whether they are singing in the right pitch or octave. An interesting thing to note about Shadja is that after one raga is sung or played and the next raga is to be performed, the Sa Swara is played so that there is no confusion with regards to the mixing up of the swaras. The swara of Shadja is always shuddha in any given raga and it can never be komal or tivra. The frequency of Shadja is 240 Hertz. Shadja is an Achal Swara. The Shadja Swara is often associated with the colour green and the planet Mercury.\n\nRISHABA (RE)\n\nRishaba is the second swara in classical music. This swara is also called Risabha and Rishabh. Rishaba is the long form for Re. The swara of Rishaba is komal and also shuddha. In Hindustani classical music Rishabha is pronounced as Re and in Carnatic classical music it is pronounced as Ri. The frequency of Rishaba is 270 Hertz. The Rishabha Swara is often associated with the colour red and also with the planet Mars. Rishaba is also a Chal Swara.\n\nGANDHARA (GA)\n\nGandhara is the third swara in classical music. This swara is also called Gandhar. Gandhara is the long form for Ga.

The Madhyama swara is both tivra and also shuddha. It is also the only tivra swara in the Saptak. The frequency of the Madhyama swara is 320 Hertz. The Madhyama swara is often associated with the moon and also the colour white. Madhyama is a Chal Swara.\n\nPANCHAMA (PA)\n\nPanchama is the fifth swara in classical music.
