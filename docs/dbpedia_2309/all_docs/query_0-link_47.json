Likewise there are equal number of Shiva and Ganapathy temples. We are blessed to be born and living in this Holy land.\n\n2.

Otherwise Continue\n\n3.1 Venugopalaswamy Temple, Movva, Andhra Pradesh\n\nVenugopalaswamy Temple, 6WG7+2RJ, Movva, Andhra Pradesh 521135 Famous Venugopalaswamy Temple is located at Movva, Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh at a distance of 55 Kms from Vijayawada and is the birthplace of the legendary poet and composer Kshetrayya.\n\nAs per the Legend,, once when Krishna was dancing, a bead from his anklet( Muvva) fell upon the earth at this place. He ordered Narada to search for the missing Muvva who whoever could not locate it. When he did severe penance, Vishnu himself appeared at that place in a blinding light, following which he made the murthy of him, and got it installed by Indra himself.\n\nThe Muvva that fell down, was reborn as Moudgalya Rishi,who became a devotee of Krishna. On doing penace to him, he appeared in a Swayambhu sand sculpture form, and the temple was built before dawn. As Vishnu descended here due to Rishi Moudagalya’s penance he was called as Muvva Venu Gopala Swamy, and the village came to be known as Movva. The temple is quite a charming place, with a sculpture of Kshetrayya, and beautiful paintings depicting the life of Krishna, set amidst green paddy fields and coconut groves.\n\nMahakavi Kshetrayya was a 17th century composer, whose real name was Varadayya, and was a devotee of Venugopala Swamy there.Though born in a Brahmin family, Varadayya never showed much interest in learning, and was more attracted towards music and dance. He also learnt Kuchipudi from an acharya. He was attracted towards a Devadasi called Mohanangi, who was known for her intellect and wisdom. She put a condition that she would accept his love, if he were able to compose 4 poems in praise of Venugopala Swamy and impress her. In order to fulfill her condition, Varadayya began to master the language, and as he composed the poems, he came to realize that only Gopala was the Supreme Lord, and gained enlightenment.\n\nAnother version states that Varadayya was an illiterate cowherd, who was taught the Gopala Mantra by a Rishi, and became a great scholar and poet, somewhat like Kalidasa. As he began to tour all the main temples down South, singing the glory of Krishna, as well as describing about those temples, he was called as Kshetragna or Kshetrayya( the one who travels). Along with Tyagayya and Annamayya, Kshetrayya is regarded as one of the 3 great composers and poets in Telugu. He composed around 4000 padams and keertanas, mostly on his Ishta Devata, Venugopala Swamy.\n\nThe padam format perfected by Kshetrayya is used to date. Most of his padams are sung in Kuchipudi, Bharatanatyam recitals. One unique feature is that the anupallavi is sung first, followed by the pallavi, and they center around theme of longing for Krishna. His compositions had Sringara as the main theme, expressing the madhurabhakti, where the relationship between the couple is a metaphor for the Jeeva( usually the Nayaki) to unite with the Divine. He used the signature of Muvva Gopala for his compositions.\n\nHis work has been a major influence in Telugu poetry, dance and music, on par with Annamayya, Tyagayya. Intimately connected with the devadasis of South temples, who interpreted his work through music and dance for a long time. With it’s Venugopala Swamy temple, and it’s association with Mahakavi Kshetrayya, and the picturesque surroundings around it, Movva is one of those places worth a visit, tucked off the beaten track.\n\nThere are separate shrines for Sri Venugopala Swamy and Godadevi in this temple. The temple has the Dasavatarams carved too, and the deity is flanked by his consorts Rukmini, Satyabhama.\n\nFestivals Celebrated : Sri Krishna Janmashtami, Deepavali, Sravana Masam, Dasara, Vaikunta Ekadasi, Vasanthotsavam,Dhanurmasam Timings to visit 05:30 AM – 01:00 PM | 04:00 PM – 08:00 PM\n\nNear by Temples : Mopidevi Sri Subramanya swamy Temple – 20km Hamsaladeevi Sri Venugopala Swamy Temple – 47km, Vijayawada Sri Kanakadurga Temple – 54km, Mangalagiri Panakala Swamy Temple – 66km.\n\n3.2 Thiruvarppu Sri Krishna Temple Kottayam, Kerala\n\nThiruvarppu Sreekrishna Swami Temple, Thiruvarpu, Kerala 686020 Thiruvarppu Sree Krishna Temple is located at Thiruvarpu, Kerala at a distance of 7 kms from Kottayam on the shores of Meenachil River. (Varppu is the cast used by smiths to make bell metal vessels). It is one of the famous temples of Krishna in Kerala which is at least 1500 years old. There are several legends of recovering the idol of Lord Krishna with 4 hands which was kept in an Uruli (Flat vessel made of bell metal).\n\nAs per one legend, when the Pandavas lived in the forest, Lord Krishna gave them his statue with four hands so that they can daily worship it. When Pandavas finished their sojourn in the forest and wanted to go back, the people of that area, requested for that idol. This was worshipped by the people of Cherthalai. But after some time due to reasons beyond their control, they were not able to continue their worship. So they simply dropped the idol in the sea.\n\nAfter a long time a sage was travelling by a boat in these parts. Suddenly his boat became immobile. When some one got in to the sea to find out the reason, the sea dried at that spot and they were able to recover this idol. The sage took the idol with him. Though he wanted to go west, the boat travelled to the east via Kunnam and Pallikkara and reached the present spot of the temple. The sage got down there along with the idol and found that a temple of Dharma Sastha was without any idol and hence he consecrated the idol in that temple.\n\nAs per another legend, the above sage got down from the boat along with the idol but due to inclement weather he was unable to proceed any further. Hence he kept the idol in an Uruli, which he found near the tank and went away. Later when he came back, he found that the idol had got fixed to the Uruli. That Uruli belonged to an individual called Kunnan Kari Menon. As soon as he heard about this incident, he gave the land for temple construction and completed the temple with the help of a saint called Madappurathu Samiyar. Even today special Pushpanjali ( offering of flowers) is done on behalf of the Asram of Madappurathu Samiyar in this temple.\n\nAs per another legend, the Pandavas deposited the idol they were worshipping along with their Akshaya Pathra in the sea, before leaving for their Agnatha Vasa. Some fishermen fishing in the Vembanad back waters at a place near Vechur (called Mangalathu Vila) recovered only the idol but not the vessel. They built a temple in a place called Chara Mangalam and consecrated the idol there. Soon various calamities occurred in their village and hence,they returned the idol to the backwaters. This time the idol fell directly into the original vessel itself. It was then that the divine person referred to earlier recovered the idol as also the vessel.\n\nHis boat travelled via Kunnam and Palikkara and was not able to travel further due to dense aquatic plants. The people of the area swam in to the water and made way for the boat to reach the shores. The idol in the vessel was kept in the shore temporarily in a structure called Valiya Madam. Later the idol was shifted to the present temple.\n\nThe architectural style of the shrine resembles the typical architecture of the temples found in Kerala. The Lord faces west along with his four hands. A peculiarity of this temple is that, the priest is given an axe as well as the key to open the door in the early morning. People believe that this God cannot tolerate hunger and so if there is any delay in opening the door with the key, the priest is permitted to break open the door with an axe.\n\nAnother peculiarity of this temple is that even during eclipse, the temple is not closed. People believe that this God would become hungry. This temple has a very peculiar drum made of bell metal. It is said that Lord Krishna announced the killing of Kamsa, playing on this drum. Another peculiar celebration of this temple is Pullattu Pooja,.\n\n3.3 Bhalka Tirth Temple, Somnath, Gujarat\n\nBhalka Tirth Temple, tirth temple, Bhalka, Veraval, Somnath, Gujarat 362265 Bhalka Tirth Temple is located in Bhalka, Somnath, Gujarat at a distance of 190 Kms from Rajgot and 90 Kms from Junagadh, Gujarat. Bhalka is part of the Lord Krishna circuit (Mathura, Vrindavan, Barsana, Govardhan, Kurukshetra and Dwarka). It is located just 4 KM from Somnath Temple, a Jyotirlinga, situated in Veraval, Gujarat,\n\nBhalka Teerth is one of the most magnificent temples of Somnath city. The temple at Bhalka Teerth is known as Mahaprabhuji’s Bethak, and a tulsi tree has been planted in Lord Krishna’s honour. Banyan trees dot the courtyard of the spectacular Krishna temple that is built in sandstone. Inside the shrine is an unusual idol of Shri Krishna in a semi-reclining position. The temple also contains a beautiful tribhangi idol of Lord Krishna playing his flute.\n\nAs per the Legend, the Kurukshetra war resulted in the death of all the hundred sons of Gandhari. On the night before Duryodhana’s death, Krishna visited Gandhari to offer his condolences. Gandhari felt that Krishna knowingly did not put an end to the war, and in a fit of rage and sorrow, Gandhari cursed that Krishna, along with everyone else from the Yadu dynasty, would perish after 36 years. Krishna himself knew and wanted this to happen as he felt that the Yadavas had become very haughty and arrogant (adharmi), so he ended Gandhari’s speech by saying “tathastu” (so be it).\n\nAfter 36 years passed, a fight broke out between the Yadavas, at a festival, who killed each other. His elder brother, Balarama, left his body through Yoga. Krishna retired into the forest and started meditating under a tree.\n\nThe Mahabharata also narrates the story of a hunter who becomes an instrument for Krishna’s departure from the world. The hunter Jara mistook Krishna’s partly visible left foot for that of a deer, and shot an arrow, mortally wounding him. After Jara realised his mistake, while still bleeding, Krishna told Jara, “O Jara, you were Vali in your previous birth, killed by myself as Rama in Treta Yuga. Here you had a chance to even it and since all acts in this world are done as desired by me, you need not worry for this”. Then Krishna, with his physical body ascended back to his eternal abode, Goloka and this event marks departure of Krishna from the earth.\n\nAccording to Puranic sources,[a] Krishna’s disappearance marks the end of Dvapara Yuga and the start of Kali Yuga, which is dated to 17/18 February 3102 BCE. The Lord left for his heavenly abode after this episode, but not before walking 4km from here to Shri Goloknathdham Tirth. The meaning of arrow is known as Bhall, so this pilgrimage has been known as Bhalka Tirth. In the 9th century AD Shri Vallabhacharya gave discourses on Shrimad Bhagavat Gita here for 9 full days.\n\nThis ancient temple was previously ransacked by Mahmud of Ghazni and looted precious jewels along with treasures back to his hometown.

However, fed up with the atrocities of Mathura’s king Kamsa, both of them with their people shifted to Nandgaon and Barsana. Nanda made Nandishvar hill his home and Vrishbhanu made Bhanugarh hill his permanent abode, which also ultimately became the abode of Radha. Presently, in both the twin towns of Barsana and Nandgaon, there stands the historical temples dedicated to Radha and Krishna on the peak of Nandishvar and Bhanugarh hills respectively. While Nandgaon temple is called the Nand Bhawan, Barsana temple is named after Radha, called Radha Rani temple or Shriji (Shreeji temple).\n\nShreeji Temple, with its arches, pillars and red sandstone, looks like a structure dating back to the Mughal era. This popular temple in Barsana is a classic example of the Rajput architecture prevailing during that time. The temple looks like a magnificent palace which is made up of red sandstone and adorned with intricate hand carvings, beautiful arches, domes and exquisite paintings on its inner walls and ceilings.

The king had fought wars with the Western Chalukyas and had also defeated the Cholas. The temple was built after the land’s best architects and artists were recruited and engaged in producing new designs and styles that would be the hallmark of the complex.\n\nThe Chennakesava temple is a fine example of fine quality work of art in stone. There are more than 80 Madanika sculptures in the temple, dancing, hunting, standing under canopies of trees and so on. The 4 Madanika figures (striking elegant dancing poses) on the wonderfully engraved columns of Navaranga are unique creations of Hoysala workmanship. The Garbhagriha is stellar in shape and its zigzag walls make the figures of 24 forms of Vishnu look different at different times of the day due to light.\n\nThe temple was built by master craftsmen – Dasoja and Chavana, a father and son duo, hailing from Balliganve, a centre of Kalyana Chalukya art in Shimoga district. It is said that Shantaladevi, the accomplished queen of King Vishnuvardhana is the model for one of the sculptures in the Vavaranga – Darpana Sundari. This work of art alone, speaks for the beauty of the magnificient temple. The temples of Kappe Chennigaraya, Soumyanayaki, Andal and other Vaishnava manifestations surround this main temple. Belur also has a samadhi believed to be of Raghavanka, the celebrated Kannada poet of the 13th century. As one enters this vast complex, a large rajagopura or gate arches above.

On the left of the Chennakeshava temple, one can find the Ranganayaki temple.Attractions in the temple complex include two ornate pillars, one of the Garuda and one with a lamp. The former was built during the Vijaynagar period and the latter is attributed to the Hoysala period.\n\nBuilt with soapstone, the Chennakesava temple features a very detailed finish built around a typical Hoysala style blueprint. The temple’s scale is what distinguishes it from many other temples of the Hoysala period and it is considered to be one of the earliest creations of the dynasty. At its highest, the temple stands 37 metres tall. Its outer walls are adorned with finely done artwork, with dancing girls in various postures.\n\nThe pillars of the temple exhibit some of the best details and finishing of sculpture and art work in the entire complex. The Narasimha pillar is one of the most popular of these temple pillars. There are a total of 48 pillars, all uniquely carved and decorated. The four central pillars were hand chiselled by artisans and feature madanikas or celestial damsels. The madanikas are in different poses and some of the popular ones which gain the attraction of tourists and art enthusiasts include the lady with a parrot and the huntress.\n\nVisitors who are keen to study the details of the wall sculptures at the Temple will find many references and depictions of important events from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. A careful observation would reveal subtle pieces of eroticism hidden amidst the detailed depictions. Animals that commonly feature in the wall sculptures include horses, elephants and lions.

Merta is a small town in the Nagaur district, Rajasthan. Meera Bai was born as a daughter of Ratan Singh, grand-daughter of Merta’s Rao Duda; and great-granddaughter of Rao Jodha, founder of Jodhpur. Meera’s mother died when the girl was 10 and the princess went to live with grandfather, Rao Duda, at Merta.\n\nCharbhuja Temple in Merta is the Temple where Meera Bai worshipped Lord Krishna before her marriage to Prince Bhoj of Chittor. The 400 year old Temple is also known as Meera Temple of Merta. Mirabai is well-known in India to this day as a Bhaktai (a worshipper) and composer of devotional songs to Krishna that continue to live on. Charbhuja temple houses the idol of Lord Krishna which Saint Meerabhai had worshipped. Nice calm, serene and divine temple – quite spacious inside – lectures and musical discourses take place in this temple.\n\nThe historic Charbhuja Nath temple built during the tenure of Meera Bai’s father Rao Duda. This tradition continues here from the 15th century till today. At 12 o’clock in the night, congratulations are given for the birth of Lord Krishna with the blowing of conch shells and then after Maha Aarti, Prasad Panchamrit is distributed to the devotees. Almost the entire city throngs here to take Panchamrit of Janmashtami. Only after that people go home and break their fast by worshiping Laddu Gopal. The historical Charbhuja Temple was built in the 15th century.\n\nAccording to legends, Rao Duda, son of Rao Jodha, the founder of Jodhpur, had laid the foundation of Merta. Even before that, Merta had been settled and destroyed many times, but Rao Duda built Dudagarh here in the 15th century. There is a story of that time that Ramdhan Mochi of Merta City had a cow. One day his wife told him that the cow does not give milk in the evening, someone milks it before evening. On this, Ramdhan chased the cow and came to know that the cow automatically sheds milk at one place. This news reached Rao Duda, the ruler of Merta. He also saw with his own eyes that Ramdhan Mochi’s cow automatically sheds milk. When that place was excavated on the orders of Duda, a black colored idol of Lord Krishna with four hands was found there. Rao Duda named it Charbhuja Nath and first built a platform there and later a grand temple was built there. Today the Charbhuja temple here is famous by the name of Meera temple. Here, right in front of the idol of Charbhuja, there is also a standing statue of his devotee Meera Bai.\n\nIt seems that the family members of Ramdhan Mochi had the first bhog. Ravduda, while building the Charbhuja temple, started a new tradition which is still a living example of social harmony. He said that Ramdhan Mochi’s cow used to feed milk to the idol of Charbhuja Nath, hence as soon as the doors of the temple open in the morning, the first offering i.e. milk would be made by Ramdhan Mochi. After that this tradition continues even today. Even today, the family members of the same Ramdhan Jeenagar cobbler continue to offer the first offering to Charbhuja Nath here. At present, child bhog is being offered on behalf of Bhajanlal Chhaganlal Gehlot (Cobbler) family, son of Damodar Jinagar, a member of Ramdhan’s clan. Apart from this, sandalwood from this family is also offered to God. Meera, born in Merta, got absorbed in the idol of God in Dwarka.\n\nBhaktashiromani Meera Bai was born in Merta in Samvat 1561 i.e. 1504 Once a procession was passing in front of the palace. Girl Meera Bai asked her grandmother who would be her groom, then grandmother gave an idol of Lord Krishna in her hand and said that this is your groom. From that very day Meera Bai became crazy about Krishna. Although she was married to Kunwar Bhojraj, the eldest son of Rana Sanga of Mewar in 1516, she considered Lord Krishna as her husband throughout her life. It is said that after the sudden demise of Bhojraj, Meera Bai started living among the groups of saints and at the age of 48, she reached Dwarkadham in Gujarat and got absorbed in the idol of Lord Krishna there. That is why it is said that no one on earth was as crazy about Lord Krishna as Meera Bai.\n\nThat is why it is said…Dhinmira, Dhin Medto, Dhin Charbhuja ro Nath, Jathe biraje hain sada, Meera ro Ghanshyam.Panorama has been telling a glimpse of Meera’s life.\n\nIn the courtyard of Rao Duda Garh near Charbhuja temple, where Meera Bai was born, Vasundhara Sarkar, during her last tenure, built a panorama of Meera Bai, which is today famous by the name of Meera Memorial. Every year thousands of domestic and foreign tourists come here to get information related to the life of Meera Bai. This panorama was completed in October 2008. Since then, more than 10 lakh devotees have acquired information from the life of Meera Bai here. In this memorial, there are statues made of fiber depicting many incidents from the life of Meera Bai as well a large collection of paintings depicting Saint Meera’s life,. Because of this memorial, Krishna devotee Meera Bai has become immortal in Merta.\n\nMost legends about Mirabai mention her fearless disregard for social and family conventions, her devotion to Krishna, her treatment of Krishna as her husband, and her persecution by her in-laws for her religious devotion. She has been the subject of numerous folk tales and hagiographic legends, which are inconsistent or widely different in details.\n\nMillions of devotional hymns in passionate praise of Krishna are attributed to Meerabai in the Indian tradition, but just a few hundred are believed to be authentic by scholars, and the earliest written records suggest that except for two hymns, most were first written down in the 18th century. Many poems attributed to Meera were likely composed later by others who admired Meera. These hymns are a type of bhajan, and are very famous across India.Temple timings are : 5 am to 10 pm\n\n3.10 Oothukadu Kalinga Narthana Perumal Temple, Tamil Nadu\n\nOothukadu Kalinga Narthana Perumal Temple, Shri Krishna Vilasam, Agraharam Oothukkadu, P.O, VIA, Avoor, Oothukadu, Tamil Nadu 612701 Oothukadu Kalinga Narthana Perumal temple is located at Oothukkadu, Tamil Nadu , 14 kms from Kumbakonam. Mahakavi Venkata Subba Iyer, popularly known as Venkata Kavi, who is beleived to be the reincarnation of Sage Naradha is believed to have lived here\n\nAs per legend,, Sage Narada prayed to Krishna to provide water for this place and immediately a pond appeared from a spring. Hence, the name Oothukadu, derived from the Tamil words ‘oothu’ (spring) and ‘kaadu’ (forest). In this pond,\n\nAs per legend, this place was once a Pushpa Vanam. Residing at the Kailasanatha temple in Aavoor, Nandini and Patti, the children of Kamadhenu, were providing milk to the Lord. Every morning, the two would also graze across to the nearby Oothukadu Village and collect flowers for the Lord from the Pushpa Vanam. Once the two little ones listened to Sage Narada’s narration of the story of Lord Krishna and his Kalinga Narthana. Hearing the story of the five year old Krishna taking on the poisonous asura snake (Kalinga) and performing the Kalinga Narthana, Nandini and Patti broke out into tears for the hardship and the onerous task imposed on the little boy Krishna.\n\nWorried about her children, Kamadhenu approached Krishna at Vaikuntam seeking a solution to her children’s shocked state of mind. Responding to her request, Krishna appeared here at the Pushpa Vanam at Oothukadu and performed yet again, with ease, the Kalinga Narthana in front of a delighted Nandini and Patti thus convincing them that this was a child’s play for him. Wanting all the devotees to enjoy this unique form of Krishna, Narada requested the Lord to be present here at Oothukadu as Kalinga Nardana.\n\nNarada is said to have installed the idol of Krishna as Kalinga Narthana with Nandini and Patti standing on either side of the Lord in front of him and referred to this place as ‘Then Gokulam’.The main deity here is not Krishna, but a large stone image of Vedanarayana Perumal in a seated posture with Goddesses Sridevi and Bhudevi on either side. The utsavar is Kalinga Nartana Krishna, flanked by consorts Rukmini and Satyabhama, and with Nandini and Patti along with their calves. This image is believed to be Svayambhu (self-manifested).\n\nThe idol of Sri Kalinga Narthana Perumal is beautiful and is about 2.5 ft high. Lord Krishnaa, portrayed as a five year old child is seen dancing with his left foot on the serpent’s head and his right leg in the air.His left hand does not fully hold the serpent’s tail. There is a hairline gap between the serpent’s hood and the left foot of the idol through which a piece of paper can be passed.. The right hand is in abhaya mudra (blessing) and it appears as though this deity is holding the tail of the snake with the left hand. However, Krishna touches the tail of Kaliya with only the thumb. Krishna, as a young boy, is shown fighting with Kalinga and the scars resulting from the whipping of the tail are seen on Krishna’s ankles.\n\nThe temple is small. Other Sannidhis are Narthana Vinayakar at the main entrance, Panchamukha Hanuman, Aandal and Oothukkadu Venkata Kavi inside the temple. Mahakavi Venkata Subba Iyer, popularly known as Venkata Kavi, who is beleived to be the reincarnation of Sage Naradha is believed to have lived here in early 18th century. Not being able to find a proper music teacher, he surrendered to Krishna in the Oothukadu temple who is believed to have blessed him. It is said that Krishna listened to his songs and kept the beat (tala) for him. He composed hundreds of compositions in Sanskrit and Tamil of which over 500 are available. He was proficient in a variety of musical forms such as the kriti, tillana and kaavadicchindu. He used taalas and themes that many other Carnatic composers had or have not. His compositions are a blend of a high degree of scholarship on a variety of subjects and inspired expression.\n\nIt is a surprise that somehow none of the twelve Alwars have visited here and mentioned about Lord Sri Kalinga Narthana Perumal and about Oothukkadu in any of their verses and hence this is not considered as a Divya Desam. To compensate this, Venkatakavi with selfless and pure devotion to Lord Krishna, had composed and sung about the plays enacted by Krishna at Oothukkadu. Even after centuries, these compositions holds us in a trance and sung in every occassion by our popular Carnatic singers. There is a small shrine for Oothukadu Venkata Kavi in this temple. A visit to the Kalinga Narthana temple will liberate one from Rahu and Kethu doshams and Sarpa Dosham as well.

Lalitpur ,Nepal\n\nKrishna Temple, M8FF+CXG, Lalitpur 44700, Nepal Krishna Temple, is located in , Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Nepal. Up until 2008, Nepal,was the only Hindu country in the World (now a secular state) where about 80% of the population is Hindu. Perhaps that’s why one can find temples and shrines in every nook and corner of the cities, especially Kathmandu and Patan. Kathmandu (the capital) has been rightfully termed the city of temples, closely followed by neighboring cities – Patan and Bhaktapur.\n\nFor followers of Lord Krishna everywhere, the Krishna Mandir of Patan has great architectural and spiritual importance.Situated in the center of the city of Lalitpur (Patan) in Nepal, Patan Durbar Square is one of the three Durbar Squares in the Kathmandu Valley, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites and a perfect sample of the Newari Architecture.\n\nKrishna temple was built by King Siddhi Narasimha Malla of Patan in 1637 AD. As per the Legend it was built because of a dream. One night, King Siddhi Narasigh Malla dreamt that the god Krishna and Radha were standing in front of the palace. The King ordered a temple built on the same spot. During a war with a neighboring kingdom a decade later, the King emerged victorious after calling on Krishna to vanquish his enemies. In gratitude, the King built a temple replica inside the Sundari Chauk courtyard.\n\nKrishna Mandir of Patan is perhaps Kathmandu Valley’s finest stone wrought monument. Krishna temple is made in the Shikhara architectural style, a style that is commonly found in what is now known as the Indian Subcontinent. The temple is made of stone, and the carving is finer than that of the other smaller Krishna Mandir at Patan Durbar Square, built by Yogamati, the great-granddaughter of Siddhi Narasimha Malla, in 1723. Beneath its 21 golden pinnacles are three floors. The first floor enshrines Krishna, the second Shiva, and the third Lokeshwor. Scenes from the Ramayana narrated in the Newari script decorate the temple’s interior.\n\nIts architecture successfully blends two styles: the solidly formed Southern Gupta shikhara form and the open multi-storied style of Moghul. The craftsmanship of the stone carvers can be seen in the intricate images of gods and the perforated stone screen railings of the passages. There is an open passage on the ground floor, and it is empty inside. A narrow and low passage leads to the center of the first floor.\n\nThe first floor is the main area of worship, where a large hall holds an image of Krishna with two consorts, Radha and Rukmini, all beautifully carved out of black stone. The flooring also contains images of the ten incarnations of Vishnu.The delicate stone carvings along the beam on the 1st-floor recount events from the Mahabharata. The second floor contains an image of Shiva. The hard-to-see beam on the 2nd floor features scenes from the epic Ramayana. The small fourth floor contains no images now; however, the people say that there was formerly a statue of Avalokitesvara. Perhaps such placement acted as an example of the harmonious blend of Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal.\n\nThe steps to the temple’s first floor are narrow and small, and it is not common for the first-timers to hit their head while climbing down the stairs. From the balcony of the first floor, one could look around Durbar Square. The temple is adjacent to the Patan Museum because of which one can glance at the temple from the window of the museum. Viewing with a binocular from the museum window would give a clear view of the idols of Lord Krishna and his consorts enshrined in the temple. The images of Vishnu and his mount, Garuda, are found throughout the temple. Four full-size statues of Vishnu upon Garuda surround the base of the sikhara, while bas-reliefs of the same theme are located on the ground floor cornices. Depictions of the 10 avatars of Vishnu are also set on the outside face of the ground-level gallery. A freestanding statue of gided Garuda, mounted upon a pole, is set in front of the temple. It was erected by Siddhi Narasingh Malla about ten years after construction of the temple.\n\nThe Krishna Mandir is managed by local Brahmins and is still used, though entrance is forbidden to non-Hindus (as was the case with the nearby Bhimsen temple, currently awaiting restoration as it was completely destroyed in the 2015 earthquake). It was painstakingly restored by the Kathmandu Valley Preservation Trust (KVPT) and reopened to pilgrims and tourists in 2018. The temple is usually opened at all times, and during the festival of Krishna Janmashtami, large numbers of devotees throng the square to offer worship to Lord Krishna. The temple is beautifully decorated with colorful papers, lights, and flowers during the festival.\n\n3.12 Choto Govinda Temple, Krishnapur, Bangladesh\n\nChoto Govinda Temple, 9R6M+WWP, Krishnapur, Bangladesh – Puthia Temple Complex Choto Govinda Temple is located in Puthia Temple Complex, Krishnapur, Bangladesh at a distance of 220 Kms from Dhaka.and 23 kilometres to the east of Rajshahi city.

One flower from the plait of Mohini fell down and it was smelt by Lord Siva. Then he surprisingly found “Sree Maha Vishnu” in the form of Mohini . The place where the flower from the plait of Mohini fell is named as RYALI the Telugu meaning of “Fall”.This place known as Ryali for the above reason became abode of Lord Siva.

The three are considered the primary three among the sixty three Nayanmars of the Saivite sect of Hinduism. The 278 temples that are mentioned in Thevaram are referred as Paadal Petra Thalam, meaning the temples that were sung in the verses.\n\n3.1 Bhavani Sangameshwarar Temple\n\nKNT003-Bhavani Sangameshwarar Temple, CMPM+25F, Bhavani, Tamil Nadu 638301 PPS TPS – Sangameshwarar Temple is located at Bhavani, Tamil Nadu at a distance of 15 kms from Erode and 64 kms from Salem is a Thevara Padal Petra Sthalam – Padigams Sung by Great Saivaite Saint Gna Sambhandar.

The temple was built at the confluence of rivers Cauvery, Bhavani and ‘Amutha Nathi’, an invisible underground water source. So the Lord Shiva here is called as Sri Sangameswarar (Sangamam meaning confluene). The temple is situated at the foothill of Padma Giri and is surrounded by four hills – Naga Giri, Veda Giri, Mangala Giri and Sanga Giri.\n\nThe temple is an ancient one, having been built by the first Pallava King, Mahendra Verman.All the three Tamil Kings- Chera, Chozha and Pandya- had done developmental work here.

Kuberan worshiped the Lord and was blessed with a darshan. The tree is still there and bears a lot of fruits.\n\nAs per another legend , Sage Vishwamithrar is said to have installed another lingam on the banks of the river and worshipped it by chanting the Gayathri Mantram. Hence this lingam is called “Gayathri Lingam”\n\nAs per history, a British dignitary by the name of William Garo donated a swing / cradle (Oonjal) made of ivory after he miraculously escaped from the collapse of his Rest house in the year 1802.

Sthala Vriksham : Vanni Tree . The Lord who is a Swayambumurthy was worshipped by Agasthya and his finger prints are seen on the Lingam.\n\nThere are three adjacent temples inside the same premises for Lords Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Hence it is also called Mummorthi temple All the three towers are east facing. The temple has epigraphs from the time period of King Sundarapandiyan Kesari’s rule.\n\nThough there are several Ganesas in this temple, the most important one is called Kaveri Kanda Ganesan ( One who has seen Cauveri ).

Another special Vinayaka in this temple is called Vyakrapada Vinayaka as He is having the feet of a tiger and this Murthy appears in one of the pillars! This kind of Murthy is not seen in any other temple.\n\nThe pose of Shiva Natarajar ( Kunjithapada Natarajar ) is unique in this temple- unlike other temples, both His legs are on the Peetam!

He is having only three faces ( representing Icha, Kriya and Gnana Shakthis ) and the Vanni is considered as the fourth face of Brahma.\n\nThis vanni tree is considered ageless and is very holy. While one side of the tree is with thorns, the other side is without them. This is explained as one part Brahma and other Saraswathi. This tree does not flower or offer any fruits and only the leaves are used for all purposes. These leaves even if immersed for years in water, do not get spoiled. Devotees from this area who go for Pazhani Kavadi Yatra, put some leaves in their pot carrying the Cauvery water to Pazhani. Going around this Vanni tree for kaal, arai and muzhu mandalams ( 12, 24 and 48 days respectively ) or the age of the person or 108 times, is considered very auspicious. Special prayers and abhishekam are performed to this Brahma on Mondays.

Agasthyar is believed to have prayed here on his way to Pothigai Hills. Here Cauvery river takes a 90dgree turn from South to East and this turn is attributed to Sage Aasthyar whereas some other legends attribute this is to Veeranarayana Perumal who prevented the Cauvery from flooding the town by turning its direction. Apart from Cauvery which is one of the Theerthams, there are several other theerthams within the temple like Bharadwaja, Brahma and Deva Theerthams.\n\n3.3 Arthanareeswarar Temple, Tiruchengode\n\nKNT004 Padal Petra Sthalam – 9VFX+26V, Arthanareeswarar Temple,\n\nArthanareeswarar Hill Temple Road, Tiruchengode, Tamil Nadu 637211 PPS, TPS .

The temple is more than 1000 years old.\n\nThis temple is located at the top of a hill, at a height of about 1900 feet and there are about 1200 steps to reach the top. You can either choose to climb the stairs or take the motorable road. Vehicles are going right up to the entrance of the temple.The hill is mainly composed of sand stone and is reddish (senniram) in colour. This is why the place is called Sencode. Another reason for the name Sencode could be that the hill is a straight formation (Senguthana malai). Other names of this hill are Nagagiri (nagam meaning snake and giri meaning malai) and Vayumalai (wind).\n\nMoolavar: Sri Arthanareeswarar / Sri Mathoru Pagar; Ambal: Sri Bagam Priyal; Theertham: Devatheertham; Sthala Vriksham:Iluppai Tree; Lord is Swayambhumurthy (self-manifested) constituted of Nava Bashanam..

In front of this hill, on the west side is the statue of a large Nandhi – seven feet in length and four feet in height.The idol of the main deity is six feet in height with the right half depicted as male and the left half as female. The male portion of the idol has jadamudi (knot of hair), thandam (baton), Silambu (anklet) and Rudraksham mala whereas the female portion has a Kazhal at the leg and Thali around the neck.

It is claimed that this rare posture of the Lord as prime deity can only be found in this temple in the whole of Asia.This temple also has an emerald lingam “Maragatha Lingam” and a small statue of Birunki Maharishi in front of the Moolavar. Ambal worshiped this Maragatha Lingam.\n\nAs per legend, Adisheshan and Vayu fought among themselves frequently to test their superiority. During one such struggle, against Vayu’s severe wind, Adhiseshan failed to hold on to the Mount Meru. Three portions of Meru Malai came down to earth with Adisheshan’s blood strain. One such piece is this hill. Since it was believed to be red in colour due to Adisheshan’s blood strain, it is also called as sencode.\n\nAs per another legend, whenever Sage Birunki used to visit Kailash, he would take the form of a small insect and perform his worship by flying around Lord Shiva only. He would ignore the Ambal even though they were both sitting together. Angered by this, Ambal cursed Sage Birunki. Lord Siva intervened and pacified Ambal by explaining to her that Ambal is inseparable from Shiva. This legend is believed to be another reason behind this unique union of Swamy and Ambal as it represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies of the universe.\n\nAs per another legend when Saint Thirugnanasambanthar visited this place he found that the people were adversely affected by “vishakaichal“ (Viral Fever) due to “vishakkatru” (hazardous pollutants in the air).

Out of jealousy, some Brahmins complained against Karuvurar Siddhar to the king that the Siddhar was following the Vama Margam – offering wine and meat to the Lord. Upon enquiry it was found this complaint was baseless and the king punished the complainants. However, unable to bear the continual harassment, he ran towards the shrine, embraced and became unified with the Lord Ahnilaiyappar. Because of his embracement, the Lingam is found in a slanting position. Inside the temple, there is a Jeeva Samathi of Karuvurar Siddhar.\n\nMoolavar: Sri Kalyana Pasupatheeswarar / Sri Ahnilaiyappar /Sri Pasupathy Nathar; Ambal: 1.

Once the king’s elephant wrenched the basket of flowers from Sivakami Andar, – a Shiva devotee and destroyed them .Sivakami Andar started crying ; Eripatha Nayanar happened to pass that way and became furious that an elephant had caused an aged Shiva devotee such distress. He hurled his powerful axe and killed it. He also killed the Mahouts since the Mohouts failed to control the elephant.\n\nOn hearing the news King Pugazh Cholan (staunch Shiva devotee) reached the spot .He requested Eripathar to kill him with his own sword as he took moral responsibility. . Moved by the King’s devotion to the Lord and fearing that he might have caused distress to the King – another Shiva devotee, Eripathar wanted to punish himself and he began to cut his own throat. Alarmed, the king grabbed the sword and stopped him. At this point ,Lord restored the elephant and Mahout back to life and intimated thatHe wanted the world to know the greatness of Eripathar\n\nAs per another legend, Vadivudaiyal who was born in a place called Appipalayam (near Karur), was devoted to Lord Pasupatheeswarar and wanted to marry him.

Even today, the Lord is found with his head tilted to one side and hence is also called “Mudisaithanathar”.\n\nVel paari, one of the “Seven greatest bestowers” of the last Sangam Era had two daughters Angavai and Sangavai. The Chera, Chola and Pandya kings in their desire to expand their territory, lay siege on the territories of King Paari. After a long drawn war, Paari was killed treacherously. His death left the two girls orphaned and Poet Kabilar, a bosom friend of the King took them under his care. He approached several Velir kings to accept the girls as brides for their sons, but they refused, fearing the wrath of the Moovendar (Chera, Chola & Pandya). Kabilar handed over the girls to a brahmin in Thirukoilur and fasted to death. The place where he fasted to death is called Kabilar Kundru and can be seen till date in Thirukoilur. The brahmin thought the only person who could solve this problem and get the girls married was Poet Avvaiyaar and brought the girls to her.\n\nAvvaiyaar approached Deiveegan and Yenadhi Kannan, the sons of Malayaman Thirumudi Kaari to marry Angavai and Sangavai. The young princes agreed to marry the girls provided the Moovendhars did not have an objection. Avvaiyaar came to Karapuram and worshipped Lord Ganesha and asked him to assist in convincing the Moovendhar. Lord Ganesha who is found in the name of “Vinai Theertha Vinayagar ” in this temple wrote the marriage invitation on a palm leaf and invited the kings. The Moovendhars promised to provide consent if Avvaiyaar was able to make fresh leaves sprout from a dried palm tree at the temple. Avvaiyaar sang hyms in praise of Lord Karapuranathar and with his grace, the tree bore not just new leaves but also fruits.\n\nThe Moovendars happily consented to the wedding and Kanjamalai Karadi Siddhar who worshipped Karapuranathar in the form of a bear was the witness to this agreement. The Jeeva Samadhi of Karadi Siddhar is found in this temple. Boys and Girls seeking good marriage alliance come to this temple with three garlands – One for Lord Karapuranathar, One for Goddess Perianayagi and the third for Avvaiyaar, preferably on the date their birth star occurs during the month. After performing archana to the God and Goddess, the garland that adorned the Lord in case of a girl and the Goddess in case of a boy is given to them. They wear the garland and go around the temple carrying coconut, flowers and a garland for Avvaiyaar. They garland Avvaiyaar,break the coconut and make sincere prayers for an early marriage. Soon the alliance is fixed, and they come back to offer new saree and the first invitation to Avvaiyaar.\n\nSeveral marriages thus fixed also take place in this temple. Many love marriages happen here, as this is the temple where Angavai and Sangavai had overcome several obstacles to find a good groom. The temple actually has a notice board which gives the list of documents that are required to register a marriage\n\nThe statues of all the 3 Tamil kings – Chera, Chola and Pandyan are placed at the entrance of the temple.There is also a staue of the great Tamil poet Avvaiyar.
