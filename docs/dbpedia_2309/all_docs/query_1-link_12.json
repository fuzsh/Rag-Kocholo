The later belonged to the 10th A.C Thirumaragal was composed in one. Sekelar’s Periya Punanam belongs to A. C 12th century.\n\nThe Importance of Specialty and Thirumuraigal\n\nThe entire Rishis who enjoyed the full blessings of Lord Shiva on (Veda which was composed of Manthiram and Thoththiras Thus the Thevara Thoththirangal songs by the devotees of Lord Shiva were again came into one as a Tamil Vedam.\n\nThevaram and Thiruvasagam can be described or explained as the essence of Thevara Thiruvasakangal says religious scholars Kasivasi Senthil |Natha Iyar has given an excellent review of the above mentioned religion songs. The songs Tamil Vetham is fill of piety and those who sing the same will be blessed with the feeling. Because the Nayanmarkal and Arularkal were blessed by God to sing such valuable religion songs. That is why there so called Arulalargal were able to do so many miracles. The Arulalargal’s miracles which were very holy were more than the miracles what the magician do with their Manthiras. Thus these Thirumurai Padalgal has got the power of creation, protection and distruction. They and at the same time Divine also they must be sung in the proper Pannisai, piety understanding the entire meaning of each and every word is it. Then only the singer the devotee will be fully blessed by the great Creator.\n\nThirumurai songs gives all ideas about the greatness of God, the blessings to all souls, also by singing the above holy songs, we pray to God to fulfill our needs and bless us with full containment. We have no change to commit when we sing the Thirumuragal, we can have mentioned the Thothirams and pray to His Almighty to protect us from all sins and request him also to bless us this birth and the birth to come by this kind of prayers we will be definitely blessed by our creator devotees who are blessed this are countless in number.\n\nThe Essential ideas found in Thirumurai\n\nFirst of all they special the main things of our religion, Pathy, Pasu and Pasam. Also about correct paths that leads us to divinity ie. Chariyai, Kiriyai, Yoga and Gnanam there four help us in this birth and well as births to come. These are mainly and fully described in the so-called Saiva Siththantham.\n\nIt is easy to sting properly the Thirumuraigal rather than understand what all said in Panniru Choothras and Sasthiras.\n\nAll most all the of Thirumuraigal are explained and praised in Suntharar’s composition Thiruthondar Thakai Nambiyanda Nambigal in his 11th Thirumurai has described the greatness and piety of the above mentioned devotees in to his writings named “Thiruththodar, Thiruanthathy. The same time precious facts and historical are given in details in Thiruththondar Puranam by Sekklar Swamingal which is a great asset to all Hindus. The main three aspects given here are the importance and speciality of Thirumuraigal, its singers and the benefits of the same.\n\nAs the Saiva Texts are mentioned to be Vedas Aagam and Puranas, the 9th Thirumurai, Vetha Manthiras and Thothirangal, the 10th Thirumarai ie. The so-called Thirumoolar’s Thirumanthiram also speaks about Aagama. The 12th Thirumarai remains as Punanam. The 11th Thirumarai consists of Thoththirams and Pirapantham.\n\nBenefits of Thirumurai Oothal\n\nThirugnanasambandhar describes all their holy songs “Thiruneriya Tamil” there “Thiru” – this term means Peerinbamukkthi. Thiruneri paves the way to Peerinbam as mentioned already in this “Thiruneriya Tamil” plays the most importance roll. The one who sings the Thirumuraigal must to pious, pure in heart and body. First of all, the Thevara Eedu or books must to pious in a holy place at the beginning end of Thirumurai that the singer should say Thirusittampala.\n\nThe specialty of Thirumuraigal\n\nOn the whole, Saiva Thirumuragal and purely based on Vetham and Agamangal. All the 12th Thirumaraigal can be compared in the 12 Rasis. Those composers of there Thirumuraigal and in total twenty seven in number similar to the 27 Nadchaththiras. There as scholars have contributed a great to Saivaism and it is growth. The beginning and end of the Thirumurailgal are specially meant to be sung during and after Prayers. Thirumanthiram is a “Sastra” compostion, Thiruthonda Puranam a “Kappia” Composition. Even then there are Thevarams as Thothiram amidst them. All these pious compositions of Thoththiras creates piety and enriches all who sings and listens to the same. These Panniru Thirumuraikal is definitely a religion to all Saivaists."
