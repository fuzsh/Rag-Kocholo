        "text": "Simone Cottrell\n\nshe | her | hers\n\nFounder, Owner & Creative Disruptor of Rachhana Creative Consulting\n\nDo you know what artists secretly love that we don't talk more about? How we are in creative heaven when we can be in the audience of other artists and listen to them share their craft. Not just a performance of their craft, but the history, social and cultural relevance, and how their craft is tied to other artforms. We love an artist's artist and I'm speaking directly about the brilliance of Priya P. Ram's House Concert at Ra-Ve Cultural Foundation on March 6. On one of the rainiest Sundays NWA has seen in 2022, Priya performed Carnatic music while also teaching the audience about the pre-Trinity, Trinity, and post-Trinity movements. In short, the history of where all Indian music comes from. What excited me the most as an artist was witnessing the trinity that occurred in this sold-out house concert. Though Priya was the headliner, she graciously shared space with three young, talented vocalists. And then as if having a headliner with students performing wasn't enough, members of the audience were so familiar with certain songs that they sang quietly around me. The trinity connection between master artist to apprentices to the audience and back again is how the arts rooted in culture works in real-time. Oh, and it didn't hurt that once the concert was over, the monsoon rains cleared for a golden sunset and samosas provided by Punjabi Kitchen. These are the magical experiences that an artist lives for. ​\n\nAnand Sankaran\n\nDirector, Walmart\n\n​President of Hindu Association of Northwest Arkansas\n\n​Music transcends language, religious and cultural barriers and is “food for the soul”. This statement would ring true for all those who attended the Carnatic music house concert hosted by Ra-Ve Cultural foundation on March 6th at the KIFA center in Bentonville, AR. Whether it was an uninitiated local Arkansas, a well informed Carnatic connoisseur or an ignorant Indian immigrant, there were all equally enthralled by the melodious and encapsulating lecture demonstration of the history of Carnatic music right from the origins of sound and music in the Vedic period to 2020’s. To traverse multiple centuries in a 90 min program is difficult enough but it was done in a flawless fashion by both Dr. Priya Ram and her husband Dr. Narasimhan Rajaram along with Priya’s disciples. Whether it was the songs of the spiritual masters of the early millennium or the more recent Carnatic trinity in 18 th century, it was evident that the painstaking research done by the presenter deserved the standing ovation the performance received. Well trained and gifted musicians such as Dr.Priya ought to help spread the inspiring Indian music to both India Diaspora in Northwest Arkansas and curious locals. May the force be with these artists!"
