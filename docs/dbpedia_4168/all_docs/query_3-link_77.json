        "meta_description": "Bolero is a 1934 American pre-Code musical drama film directed by Wesley Ruggles and starring George Raft and Carole Lombard. The Paramount production was a rare chance for Raft to play a dancer, which had been his profession in New York City, rather than portraying a gangster. The film takes its title from the Maurice Ravel composition Bol√©ro (1928). The supporting cast includes William Frawley, Ray Milland and Sally Rand.",
