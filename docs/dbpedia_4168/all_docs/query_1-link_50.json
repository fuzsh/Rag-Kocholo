        "text": "Description\n\nThe first book from professional boxer and social media star, Tommy Fury, revealing what life is like juggling his many identities: boxing champion, TV star, mental health advocate, fiancé and father.\n\nWhen Tommy Fury realised as a young boy that he wanted to become a boxer, the odds were stacked against him. His father was sent to prison when Tommy was only nine, casting his family life into chaos. He couldn’t afford a bus ticket to the gym to train, so he’d have to walk three hours instead. When he got there, everyone wanted to fight him – guys much older than him and twice his size – to say they could beat a Fury.\n\nIn Lightning Can Strike Twice, Tommy Fury opens up about his incredible story – defying pressure and triumphing regardless of the weight of expectation on his shoulders – and the many sides to his life. He shares unfiltered stories about his experience on Love Island, candid insight into his life at home with Molly-Mae and their daughter Bambi, and a glimpse behind the scenes of what life is like as part of the UK’s most popular family – including never-before-seen personal photos. Tommy Fury wasn’t supposed to succeed. How could another champion come out of the family that had already produced Tyson Fury? In this open, honest memoir, Tommy shows that lightning can strike twice and that there’s more to being a Fury than knowing how to fight."
