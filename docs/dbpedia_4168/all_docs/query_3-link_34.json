        "text": "Sometimes it is remarkable to learn how certain films were regarded prior to their release. Few of the people involved in the making of Casablanca imagined that it was anything other than one more unexceptional movie released in that year. It Happened One Night also had inauspicious beginnings.\n\nThe film was made by Columbia Pictures, which was considered a minor film studio at the time. For this reason, many famous actors refused to appear in the film. What director Frank Capra got instead was two reluctant stars, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, who disliked the script, and kept insisting on changes.\n\nColbert in particular loathed the movie. She complained every day, and was given to tantrums on set, according to Capra. “I just finished the worst picture in the world,” she told a friend. Columbia too did not have much faith in their film. After a limited promotional campaign, the film’s box office began slowly, only to suddenly take off as word got around.\n\nWith just a $325,000 budget, It Happened One Night took in $2,500,000 at the box office and another two million in theatrical rentals. From here, the film’s reputation has become so big that it is sometimes hard to separate truth from fable.\n\nI can state a few facts confidently. It was the first romantic comedy to win an Oscar for Best Picture. It was one of only three films that have ever taken all five of the most prestigious Academy Awards – Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture.\n\nOther claims that have been made about It Happened One Night I will present, but I cannot say for certain how true they are. Was it the first screwball comedy ever made? (Indeed is it a screwball comedy at all?) Is it the first movie to ever show the heroine jilting a man at the altar? Was it a personal favourite of both Stalin and Hitler?\n\nDid the character of Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns) inspire Friz Freleng to create Bugs Bunny? Did the scene where Clark Gable takes off his shirt and bares his chest lead to a decline in the sale of men’s undershirts? Is the man who sings the third verse of “The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze” Frank Capra? Take a look and see what you think.\n\nI can say with more confidence that It Happened One Night was one of the most effective romantic comedies of the 1930s, and it helped to popularise many of the traits that became familiar in later films. I discussed these in my review of Bringing Up Baby – the screwball comedy, the comedy based on notions of class, the odious fiancé or fiancée, and the good-natured battle of the sexes.\n\nI am not sure how far It Happened One Night counts as a screwball comedy in that the characters are mostly not screwballs. Neither the hero Peter Warne (Clark Gable) nor the heroine Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) are especially screwy. They are identifiable and believable characters.\n\nHowever the situations that they encounter are typical of screwball comedies – clashes of class and gender, relationship problems, absurd plot situations, and so on. The film also shares the typical fast-talking, witty repartee of a screwball comedy. I regard the film more as a pre-screwball comedy that contains some elements of that sub-genre, but does not really count as one itself. However I am prepared to humbly back down on this point if someone is able to persuade me.\n\nClass is an important driving factor in the story. Our first impression of Ellie is that she is a spoilt rich girl with a controlling daddy. Her father Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly) has imprisoned Ellie on a boat because he wishes her to annul her recent marriage to the gold-digger, King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Ellie responds in a tempestuous manner, overturning his dinner tray, and making her escape by swimming for shore.\n\nAppearances are deceptive, even at this early point. The tense relationship between father and daughter conceals much love. When Ellie’s father slaps her face, we are shocked, but our shock is mirrored in the face of Alexander himself. This is clearly not how he usually relates to his daughter. Later in the film, Ellie trusts her father enough to confide in him, and he encourages, and provides the means, to allow her to make the choice that is right for her.\n\nEllie’s wish is to travel to New York to be with her husband, but this closeted wealthy woman has never been allowed out on her own before, and finds the journey more complicated than she imagines. Fortunately, she runs into the worldly-wise and (I must inevitably say) wisecracking journalist, Peter Warne, who has just been sacked from his newspaper company, and has time on his hands.\n\nCuriously Peter is also nicknamed ‘King’ by his friends, but he is the polar opposite of King Westley. Peter is tough, masculine, blunt and honest. In this he stands in contrast to the effete Westley, a man who brandishes a stick for affectation, and who lives for attention. When he gets a chance to marry Ellie properly, Westley is unable to resist flying in by autogiro in order to impress the newspapers.\n\nWestley is a man who can be bought off. He holds onto Ellie for as long as he thinks he can milk the arrangement for money, and he gives her up in exchange for a cash settlement. Peter is no fortune hunter. When he turns up at Alexander Andrews’ office demanding money, Ellie’s father assumes that he is claiming the reward money for her return, and possibly he fears a little blackmail too.\n\nAlexander’s distaste is soon dispelled when he is instead presented with no more than an itemised account of the expenses Peter incurred on the journey, amounting to the princely sum of $39.50. Ellie’s father is impressed by Peter’s lack of greed, and realises that this is a man who would make him a better son-in-law.\n\nThis is not apparent when Ellie and Peter meet. In typical comic fashion, the two dislike each other at first, after Ellie takes Peter’s seat on the bus. From this point, he calls her Brat, a nickname to which she responds with suitable hauteur: “Are you talking to me?” She addresses him by the patronising label of “Young man”, although there is obviously no age gap between them. (Gable was two years older than Colbert in fact.)\n\nDespite this inauspicious start, there is a spark between them from the start. Peter cannot help watching over this helpless woman. Later this is supposedly for mercenary reasons after he recognises her, and hopes to get her exclusive story. However he is protective towards her, even before he knows that. He chases a man who steals her bag. He lets her rest her head on his shoulder when she is sleepy. He stays behind to help her when she misses the bus.\n\nFrom this point, she becomes dependent on Peter. The dominant male puts her on a budget, and tends to the needs of this vulnerable young lady. This extends to the smallest of items, leading to one or two absurd arguments about how to dunk a donut, and the correct meaning of the phrase ‘piggy-back’. Her misuse of the term earns her a spank on the backside, something we would not see in a movie today.\n\nPeter pretends to be her husband to help her to escape the attentions of the importunate Oscar Shapeley. Later he chases off Shapeley when the unpleasant fellow-traveller recognises Ellie and plans on getting the reward. This leads to them leaving the bus, and travelling on foot and by car, where Peter is obliged to feed her, and to rescue their bags from a shady driver.\n\nInevitably their feelings change over the journey, and they fall in love. Ellie comes to value the qualities of a man who is unlike anyone she has known before, a muscular man who is willing to stand up to her and for her. Peter’s resentment towards Ellie is also challenged, including his view that she is spoilt. Ellie responds:\n\nYou think I’m a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don’t see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I’ve always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom.\n\nWe get our first glimpse into the idea that it is not fun or liberating to have wealth, since Ellie has been kept cloistered from the world and never given the chance to make choices for herself. As a result she has got involved with the unworthy King Westley, because he finally gave her that freedom.\n\n1930s comedies often involve a battle of the sexes, but It Happened One Night is unusual in that the man firmly has the upper hand. This partly reflects the personalities of the two actors. Gable had a macho and assertive manner that did not lend itself to the traditional weak male required for romantic comedies. Colbert was too aloof to take control.\n\nAs a result, the two characters occupy traditional gender roles in relation to one another – the weaker helpless female and the sturdy virile male who looks after her. This is disappointing but perhaps inevitable given the choice of actors, and the theme of class differences, which naturally favours the lower class Peter over the upper class Ellie.\n\nThere is only one scene where Ellie firmly gets the upper hand. This is the famous hitch-hiking scene. Peter freely boasts about his skills in getting drivers to stop, but his boasts prove hollow. The drivers ignore his antics, and the cars flash past. Ellie uses her own method for stopping a car, which is to hitch up her skirt and show her leg. The first car to pass her hastily pulls up with a screeching of the brakes.\n\nColbert disliked this scene, feeling that showing her leg was unladylike. However she was even less enthusiastic about the studio employing a double to perform the scene, and agreed to do it herself. So the shapely legs you see in the movie are Colbert’s own.\n\nThis is a mildly risqué moment. It is said that It Happened One Night was one of the last romantic comedies made before the Hays Code began to be rigorously enforced. On the whole, it is not especially daring, but there are a few interesting scenes that hint at an erotic attraction between the two lead characters.\n\nThe film is unable to take this too far because Ellie is technically married to King Westley, even if their marriage for some reason lacks an official stamp. As a result, we have a romantic comedy in which the two lead actors never kiss or embrace. They express their feelings through talking, and through lingering looks.\n\nNonetheless there are moments of titillation. To avoid Ellie being found by searching policemen, Peter and Ellie pretend to be a argumentative couple. After the officers leave, Peter buttons up Ellie’s blouse in a manner that seems like a reversal of what his desire might be, and both of them seem stimulated by this chance to portray someone with coarser desires than they would normally express.\n\nThe movie’s most famous tease involves the Walls of Jericho. This scene was apparently dreamed up because Colbert refused to undress for the camera. While sharing an apartment, Peter comes up with a solution to the awkwardness that the two of them might feel about undressing in front of one another when going to bed.\n\nHis answer is to put up a sheet between their beds. “The Walls of Jericho will protect you from the Big Bad Wolf,” he tells Ellie. This allows the two of them to undress without the other seeing, but the sexual tension is palpable. On the first occasion, Peter removes his shirt in front of Ellie until she moves to her side of the wall. He is later conscious of Ellie putting her clothes on top of the wall where he can see them. She is notably softer towards him the following morning.\n\nThis wall must remain up until the end of the movie. We do not see what happens when the walls finally come down, but we hear a trumpet and can make a shrewd guess. I imagine it is this scene which inspires the title of the movie. The main action happens over four days, not one night, so it seems natural to assume that the title refers to their final consummation.\n\nHow Capra-esque is It Happened One Night? Early Capra films show some hints of the familiar concerns of later Capra offerings, but a few of them seem different to what we usually find in the works of the famous director. For example, Lost Horizon and The Bitter Tea of General Yen are a long way from It’s a Wonderful Life, You Can’t Take It With You, Meet John Doe or Mr Smith Goes to Washington.\n\nThere are the familiar quirky Capra characters, and the same blend of warmth and good humour that we find in his later films. There is less corniness and sentimentality, and the story is a straightforward comedy with little attempt to discuss social issues or deal with the problems of the little man. The only exception to this is a scene on the bus where Ellie and Peter help a child whose mother has fainted from starvation.\n\nThe film is made with higher production values than many early 1930s movies. There are none of the static scenes where the camera is fixed in one spot while the characters talk. In keeping with a film where the characters are always on the move, the camera tracks and follows the characters. It is able to do this because the camera has been put on a crane.\n\nOne scene that stays in my memory is a seemingly trivial one. After Peter and Ellie stop off for the night, Ellie is obliged to walk across the camp in order to take a shower. As she does so, the camera travels the camp with her, treating us to a remarkable view of the whole area as it does so.\n\nThere is no obvious need for this scene. It contains no action or humour. It has no artistic significance. It is presumably only there because the director wished to experiment with an interesting shot, and test out what he could do with a camera on a crane. The shot may be unnecessary in terms of the story, but it gives me great pleasure to watch.\n\nThat seems as fitting a point as any to leave It Happened One Night. There is no particular substance in the film compared with later Capra perhaps, but it is made with such skill and professionalism that it will always be a favourite among afficonados of old movies. To watch the movie is to feel a part of the world of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews, and I am always happy to return there for another visit."
