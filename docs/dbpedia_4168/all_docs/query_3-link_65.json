        "text": "\"The [c]inema must please the women or die,\" wrote Manchester Guardian film critic C.A. Lejeune in 1926. \"The vast majority of picture-goers are women and always will be.\" And while women like Lejeune wrote a great deal about film in the early decades of its history, little of that work has been anthologized or remained in print. Red Velvet Seat: Women's Writing on the First Fifty Years of Cinema, edited by Antonia Lant and Ingrid Periz and published by Verso in 2006, is a massive effort to fill in these gaps, bringing together more than 160 writings by women about the movies from 1895–1950. In their introduction, the editors write:\n\nCinema-going was the most important way in which women joined in the urban mass culture of the first half of the twentieth century. As film patrons, actresses, directors, and critics, they engaged with film as the most prominent medium of their age. They spoke of it as a precious refuge of their modern landscape, as a force of political change, as a pictorial mode, and as an opportunity both for education and for emotional transport; cinema \"makes itself her weepery,\" as Dorothy Richardson put it.\n\nWomen published their film opinions in a host of venues — daily newspapers, parent monthlies, art and literary journals, the fashion press — and in writing styles from the highbrow modernist's to the agony aunt's. Gay women, straight women, black women, white women, old women, young women, all wrote in response to film, women as unalike as social reformer Jane Addams, gossip columnist Louella Parsons, Imagist poet H.D., and internationally read Italian short-story writer Ada Negri, as well as black performer Fredi Washington, early sex-educator Catheryne Cooke Gilman, labor organizer Mary Heaton Vorse, birth-control pioneer Marie Stopes, and American suffragist Lillie Devereux Blake. Such a diverse group in itself testifies to the breadth of cinema's impact, but also points cinema's propensity for multiple rather than singular response — there was no one female view of the cinema.\n\nSpanning this diversity of forms and voices, the book includes texts by, among many others, Djuna Barnes, Maya Deren, Virginia Woolf, Germaine Dulac, Fredi Washington, Colette, Rebecca West, Janet Flanner, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Anita Loos, Hazel Washington, and Muriel Rukeyser — whose 1934 poem \"Movie,\" first published in New Masses, is reprinted below.\n\nSpotlight her face her face has no light in it\n\ntouch the cheek with light inform the eyes\n\npress meanings on those lips.\n\nSee cities from the air,\n\nfix a cloud in the sky, one bird in the bright air,\n\none perfect mechanical flower in her hair.\n\nMake your young men ride over the mesquite plains ;\n\nproduce our country on film : here are the flaming shrubs,\n\nthe Negroes put up their hands in Hallelujahs, 1\n\nthe young men balance at the penthouse door.\n\nWe focus on the screen : look they tell us\n\nyou are a nation of similar whores remember the Maine 2\n\nremember you have democracy of champagne —\n\nAnd slowly the female face kisses the young man,\n\nover his face the twelve-foot female head\n\nthe yard-long mouth enlarges and yawns\n\nThe End\n\nHere is a city here the village grows\n\nhere are the rich men standing rows on rows,\n\nbut the crowd seeps behind the cowboy the lover the king,\n\npast the constructed sets America rises\n\nthe bevelled classic doorways the alleys of trees are witness\n\nAmerica rises in a wave a mass\n\npushing away the rot.\n\nThe Director cries Cut!\n\nhoarsely CUT and the people send pistons of force\n\ncrashing against the CUT! CUT! of the straw men.\n\nLight is superfluous upon these eyes,\n\nacross our minds push new portents of strength\n\ndestroying the sets, the flat faces, the mock skies.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. A critical reference to the depiction of African American religion in the 1929 King Vidor film Hallelujah.\n\n2. A war-rallying slogan widely heard during the 1898 Spanish-American War.\n\n[book-strip index=\"1\" style=\"display\"]"
