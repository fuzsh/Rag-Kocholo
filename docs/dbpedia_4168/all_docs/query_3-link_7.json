        "text": "The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1934), 110 minutes, D: Sidney Franklin\n\nMGM's beautifully produced, prestige piece of work was adapted from Rudolf Besier's 1930 stage play. The film was unnecessarily remade in Cinemascopic Metrocolor as The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1957), awkwardly starring Jennifer Jones as the only American performer in the British cast. The historical, emotional, soap-operaish heart-felt tale was set in 1845 in London, at the home of the Barrett family (at 50 Wimpole Street). The household (of three daughters and six sons) was dominated by the tyrannical, villainous and dictatorial control of the widowed and patriarchal Edward Moulton-Barrett (Charles Laughton), who believed that romantic love was sinful. The only child that he showed any preference for was his mostly bed-ridden, invalid eldest daughter Elizabeth Barrett (Norma Shearer), nicknamed \"Ba,\" who could only manage sitting in a chaise lounge during the day. The nearly 40 year-old daughter occupied her time by reading and enjoying her pet cocker spaniel Flush. She also corresponded with Victorian literary poet Robert Browning (Fredric March), who came to her personally after one of her letters to pay a visit. The charming and handsome poet arrived and they happily discussed poetry, the arts, philosophy of life, and other engaging subjects (Browning: \"We've known each other a mere half hour, and yet we've talked intimately of art and life and death and love\"). Although overwhelmed by Browning's immediate ardent love for her, Elizabeth found herself also falling in love with Browning, and with newly-found vitality, health and happiness, was even able to struggle to the window to watch his departure. Her jealous, stern and over-protective father vigilantly observed the couple, and although he reluctantly allowed further visits, he strictly forbade Elizabeth from becoming romantically involved. As Elizabeth's romantic interest in Browning grew, so did her physical strength and ability to walk. Mr. Barrett also possessively ruled over the romantic couplings of his other children, mostly his youngest daughter Henrietta (Maureen O'Sullivan) and her military beau Captain Surtees Cook (Ralph Forbes). He brashly disallowed their illicit relationship (he called it a \"filthiness\"). He caught her in his company, viciously seized her wrists, forced her to confess to having sex with Cook, and harshly made her swear on a Bible that if she ever saw him again, he would disown her. Barrett's unreasonable stranglehold grew even tighter after he dismissed Elizabeth's doctor-recommended therapeutic retreat to the warmer climate of Italy, and threatened to have the family move to the countryside of Surrey to further curtail Browning's visits. To protest her devoted father's crushing control (\"You're like a shadow over our lives\"), Elizabeth sent word to Browning that she would meet him and runaway together. He responded that he wanted to marry her that very evening. To dissuade his disobedient eldest daughter after she denounced him, the abusive and obsessed Barrett claimed that only Elizabeth, out of all of his children, was conceived in love (not hateful rape), and insinuated that he had more than a fatherly love for her. He confessed that he wanted her all for himself: (\"Nothing and no one can come between us, my child, my darling! You want me to be happy. The only happiness I shall ever know is all yours to give or take. You must look up to me and depend on me and lean on me. You must share your thoughts with me, your hopes, your fears, your prayers...\"). [Note: The morals code of the 1930s tamped down the implications of his unnatural and incestuous interest in her, but allowed his admission that he exhibited \"dragon\" behavior.] Repulsed by his clingy, perverse sexual advances, Elizabeth decided to leave her home immediately to meet up and elope with Browning, get married, and move with him to Italy: (\"He can't stop me. I don't belong to him anymore. He could kill me, but he can't stop me....I must go. To Robert....Until today I've never really known my father. I've even hoped I might confide in him, but now I know it would be hopeless. He'd crush me as he crushed my mother....He's cruel - cruel and pitiless and I'm afraid\"); she left a note for her father that she was leaving to be married before taking one last look around with her dog Flush in her arms before departing. In the final scene, they were married, and would go on to live in Italy and become two of England's most beloved poets, writing sonnets and poems.\n\nManhattan Melodrama (1934), 93 minutes, D: W.S. Van Dyke II\n\nMGM's crime drama was notable for the first film teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy (who later would become famous with The Thin Man series), and were coupled together during their careers in a total of 14 films. A trivia item was that it was the only film that starred both Clark Gable and William Powell. It was also notorious for being the film that fugitive bank robber John Dillinger watched (for its similarity to his own life), prior to being killed by the FBI outside Chicago's Biograph Theatre, accompanied by a \"Lady in Red\" after a matinee showing in July of 1934. Its screenplay by Arthur Caesar won the Oscar for Best Original Story. In the plot beginning in 1904, two NYC boyhood friends were introduced: Blackie Gallagher (Mickey Rooney as 12 year-old boy, Clark Gable as a tough-guy adult), and Jim Wade (Jimmy Butler as boy, William Powell as a responsible adult). As a result of drownings in the East River during a holiday steamboat accident (General Slocum) that killed their parents, Blackie and Jim were rescued by Father Joe Patrick (Leo Carrillo). The two were raised as orphans together, and grew up to choose very divergent and opposite sides of the law. Blackie became a slick underworld gangster and shady racketeer who managed an illegal gambling casino (by paying off the authorities), while the studious Jim went to law school and chose to be a noble, honest, incorruptible and aggressive Ass't District Attorney, and ultimately was elected NY state governor. Blackie - and then Jim, both fell in love with the same charming woman Eleanor (Myrna Loy), who eventually married Jim when Blackie refused to choose a different, less dangerous life's path and commit to her. Blackie's involvement in gangland murders, including the killing of indebted gambler Manny Arnold (Noel Madison), brought him to the attention of his friend Jim, but without evidence, the case went unsolved. Their paths again crossed when Jim (as governor) fired his chief assistant Snow (Thomas Jackson) for corruption, and for making the false accusation that he had ignored Blackie's guilt in the Arnold case. When Blackie learned of Snow's scheming, he shot and killed Snow during an argument in a Madison Square Garden restroom during a hockey game, and was arrested, convicted, and imprisoned by his boyhood pal Jim. As governor, Jim refused to commute Blackie's scheduled execution for murder, until Eleanor informed him that Blackie had selflessly done it for the sake of Wade's future. Jim rushed to Sing Sing Prison to meet with Blackie, who turned down his offer (arguing that it would corrupt Jim's principles), and then went on to accept his electric-chair death without bitterness, attended by Father Joe - the prison's chaplain. As a result, Jim resigned his governorship when he acknowledged his willingness to compromise his principles, and reconciled with Eleanor who had briefly left him.\n\nThe Merry Widow (1934), 99 minutes, D: Ernst Lubitsch\n\nDirector Ernst Lubitsch's lavish, unique, stylistic musical was the definitive (and parody) version of Franz Lehar's 1905 operetta, set during the time of the downfall of the Hapsburg Empire. It was a remake of Erich von Stroheim's 1925 silent film (starring Mae Murray and John Gilbert), and would be re-envisioned by director Curtis Bernhardt as an extravagant Technicolored version starring Lana Turner (with dubbed singing by Trudy Erwin) and Fernando Lamas. It was notable that the 1934 version reunited its two stars for the last time: Jeanette MacDonald (in her second MGM film, before her many pairings with Nelson Eddy beginning with Naughty Marietta (1935)), and Maurice Chevalier. Lubitsch had already filmed MacDonald on three previous occasions, for The Love Parade (1929), Monte Carlo (1930), and One Hour With You (1932). In this film's plot set in 1885, King Achmed II (George Barbier) ineptly ruled the small Ruritanian country of Marshovia. His wife Queen Dolores (Una Merkel) was known to be involved in many extra-marital affairs. The King was determined to keep the kingdom's wealth at home, in order to prevent economic collapse. One of the country's rich widows, Madame Sonia (Jeanette MacDonald), owned 52% of everything in Marshovia, causing him worry if she should marry someone outside his domain. Therefore, he ordered womanizing and dashing playboy Prince Danilo (Maurice Chevalier) to pursue Madame Sonia to Paris, in order to romance, marry, and bring her back to Marshovia. The flustered Marshovian Ambassador Popoff (Edward Everett Horton) point-blankedly asked Prince Danilo: \"Have you ever had diplomatic relations with a woman?\" Later, the Ambassador called the scheme \"cold blooded patriotism.\" Luckily, Danilo had already met the widow singing on her mansion's balcony, although she appeared solemn and forlorn (wearing all black and a veil). Along the way toward romancing her, Madame Sonia adopted a disguise as Fifi, and was at first thought by Danilo to be one of the ladies of Maxim's in Paris. After a case of mistaken identity, all was thought to end happily as they danced to the magical sound of \"The Merry Widow Waltz\" at an elegant Embassy ball. However, the widow rejected Danilo, and Danilo was subjected to a trial back in Marshovia for being a traitor: (\"I'm guilty. Guilty of treason, failing in duty, of everything you want. But, most of all, I'm guilty of being a fool. Once in my life, I lost both my heart and my head. Therefore, I should be punished. Without mercy! Let my fate be a warning to every man\"). In the film's ending plot twist, surprisingly, the widow testified on his behalf that he had truly tried to win her affection. In his prison cell, the couple were again entranced by the waltz tune, and exchanged wedding vows!\n\nOf Human Bondage (1934), 83 minutes, D: John Cromwell\n\nDirector John Cromwell's first and best film adaptation of Somerset Maugham's tragic, classic literary novel marked the earliest critically-acclaimed role of Bette Davis. It became a turning point in her career, but Davis failed to win the Best Actress Academy Award in 1934. The pre-Code tale, a fallen-woman romantic melodrama was about an obsessive romance, and covered issues such as promiscuity, adultery, a birth out-of-wedlock, naked drawings, a mutually-destructive relationship, and retributive death from TB/syphilis during prostitution. Basically, the story entailed the development of an emotionally-compulsive infatuation and \"human bondage\" victimization between a sensitive, but lame (club-footed) young Englishman medical student Philip Carey (Leslie Howard) and a blonde vulgar, trampy, selfish waitress/barmaid Mildred Rogers (Bette Davis). At the film's start in the late 1800s, club-footed, sensitive artist Philip Carey - an Englishman who had been studying painting in Paris for four years, was advised by his art teacher Monsieur Flourney (Adrian Rosley) that his artistic work was mediocre and second-rate, and that he lacked talent and promise. Philip returned to London, England to take up studies to become a medical doctor. He soon became infatuated with blonde, lower-class, pale and anemic, coarse, trashy, slatternly and vulgar, Cockney-accented, illiterate tearoom waitress Mildred Rogers. He became preoccupied and smitten with the unfeeling and shallow female, even though she was disdainful of his club-foot, and they had nothing in common. The self-centered, disdainful and vindictive Mildred made \"I don't mind\" her standard response to him when he would express an interest in asking her out. Although he was attracted to Mildred, she was manipulative, repugnant, exploitative, callous, two-timing, shrewish and cruel toward him. Soon after, she stood him up for a date, claiming that her Aunt was ill, but her real excuse was that she had accepted a date from loutish, boisterous, womanizing traveling salesman Emile Miller (Alan Hale), another tearoom customer. Philip stalked her that night and realized she had lied to him. Nevertheless, he still failed to get Mildred out of his mind. His idyllic daydreams and night-dreams about her were far from reality. When Philip contemplated marriage with Mildred and proposed to her, she immediately declined his ring, telling him that she would instead be marrying Emile Miller. After the bitter rejection, Philip forgot all about Mildred when he fell in love with the attractive, gentle and considerate Norah Nesbit (Kay Johnson), an American romance-story tabloid writer (working under a masculine pseudonym Courtenay Paget) who was sympathetic toward him. Just when it seemed that Philip was finding love and happiness, Mildred suddenly reappeared and returned to him, claiming that Emile had abandoned her (and not married her because he was already married), after impregnating her. He took pity on tearful Mildred's penniless state and gave her apartment rent money and arranged to take care of her financially. As a result, Philip broke up with Norah due to his \"bondage\" to Mildred. Both Norah and Philip admitted how bondages existed in the interrelationships between people. After the birth of Mildred's child in the hospital, she had a cold reaction to her baby, fathered out of wedlock with Emile, and gave up its care to a nurse. During a dinner party with Mildred and Philip, one of Philip's fellow medical student friends, Harry Griffiths (Reginald Denny), flirted in an outrageous fashion with Mildred. Philip asserted that he had demonstrated his love for her by supporting her with an apartment, money and clothes, but when he also implied that she was \"cheap\" and \"vulgar\" - she slapped him, and announced her decision to run off with Griffiths to Paris - and finally, he ordered her out for good. For a second time after Mildred's departure, Philip found some comfort in his studies, and with 20 year-old Sally Athelny (Frances Dee), the daughter of one of his elderly patients Thorpe Athelny (Reginald Owen) in a charity hospital. However, it wasn't long before Griffiths told Philip that they had broken up: \"Mildred and I are all washed up.\" After being abandoned, Mildred returned penniless, ill, and destitute - and now with her baby in tow. She moved in with Philip (because he couldn't afford a separate apartment for her) in exchange for housework, and Mildred at first was conciliatory to try and seduce him again. In the film's most famous sequence, when she became sexy and flirtatious with him in a low-cut negligee, Philip pushed her away in disgust. She viciously retaliated and berated him, ending her tirade by calling him a cripple: (\"And after you kissed me, I always used to wipe my mouth! WIPE MY MOUTH!...You know what you are? You gimpy-legged monster? You're a cripple! A cripple! A cripple!\"). She spitefully wrecked his apartment (with his nude drawings and books) and burned the securities/bonds he was given by his Uncle William Carey to finance his medical college tuition expenses, before leaving with her baby. Now destitute himself without the bonds, Philip had to leave medical school, but was fortuitously offered a foot operation to rid himself of his deformity. In the film's ending, Mildred once again had located Philip. She was sick, distraught, unwell, ill (with a deep cough) and destitute (with black circles under her eyes). Presumably, she was living as a streetwalker in a brothel, and her baby had died the previous summer. He gave her some money and a medical prescription, but denied her any other assistance, and left. Philip passed his exams and finished medical school (after receiving an unexpected inheritance from his deceased uncle), and in the film's last few moments, Philip learned that Mildred had died (from TB or syphilis?). Freed at last from his obsessive bondage, Philip decided to remain in England and propose marriage to Sally right away.\n\nOne Night of Love (1934), 84 minutes, D: Victor Schertzinger\n\nDirector Schertzinger's and Columbia's delightful, lavish operatic musical (which won Best Original Musical Score, the first time this Academy Award Oscar was given) was the most successful of a sub-genre of films with real-life opera stars. Earlier, real-life Metropolitan Opera soprano star Grace Moore had made her first two films for MGM in the early 1930s (A Lady's Morals (1930) and New Moon (1930)). In this romantic show-biz related drama, aspiring soprano opera singer Mary Barrett (Oscar-nominated Grace Moore) competed in a radio opera singing talent competition in New York City, but lost for her performance of \"One Night of Love.\" The winner was awarded with training in Milan under the tutelage of renowned operatic maestro and vocal coach Guilio Monteverdi (Tullio Carminati). Nonetheless, the aspiring American singer, who hoped to achieve stardom in Europe, traveled to Italy anyway. She was accepted for training by the stern and demanding martinet Monteverdi after he heard her singing \"Ciri-Biri-Bin\" with the patrons in Cafe Roma - a cellar cabaret-restaurant. Although the eminent and brilliant Guilio invited her to live with him as a pupil, he vowed she would only be his musical protege without any romantic involvement. The controlling disciplinarian molded Mary during a serious regimen of difficult training exercises (Mary vowed at one point: \"One day so help me, I'll murder that man!\"), and also helped her to overcome stagefright. Her talent as a potential opera star (known as \"La Barrett\") noticeably grew. Entanglements and misunderstandings in a so-called love triangle grew between one of Guilio's ex-pupils and old flame Lally (Mona Barrie) and Mary while they were in Vienna. To anger and cause jealousy in her teacher, Mary announced she would give up her career with him, not appear to sing in an upcoming performance of Bizet's Carmen, and return to the US with her longtime friend and wealthy suitor Bill Houston (Lyle Talbot) and marry him. Guilio realized what was happening, told Mary that Lally would replace her on stage, and then confessed his love to Mary and proposed to her - they reconciled just before she went onstage to sing the Habanera in Carmen. However, their relationship again turned rocky after another argument and they appeared to break up permanently. Back in New York after Mary had accepted an offer to sing at the Metropolitan Opera House, the diva appeared to be nervous and unprepared during rehearsals for her debut performance of Puccini's Madame Butterfly. On the night of the opera's opening, \"La Barrett\" was strengthened and encouraged to perform calmly, triumphantly and flawlessly after viewing Monteverdi in the opera's prompter box (under the stage) - who whispered \"I love you\" to her.\n\nThe Scarlet Empress (1934), 110 minutes, D: Josef von Sternberg\n\nJosef von Sternberg's startling, dark, visually opulent, hauntingly expressionistic, and mostly fictional biopic was about Prussian-born Princess Sophia Frederica (Marlene Dietrich as adult, Maria Riva as child). This semi-erotic tale of 18th century Russia was one of the most daring films of the Hays Production Code era, featuring, among other things, immorality, nudity and open sexual decadence. The film also featured extravagant sets and von Sternberg's trademark stylization, as well as great performances. For a six-year period, Marlene Dietrich was Svengali von Sternberg's favorite leading lady - this was their sixth film together (and last great collaboration). In the film's main plot, the young, naive, tremulous bride-to-be Sophia Frederica (Marlene Dietrich) was brought in an entourage on a seven-week journey to Moscow, Russia for an arranged marriage to Grand Duke Peter III (Sam Jaffe), nephew of domineering, elderly Empress Elizabeth (Louise Dresser). Upon their arrival, the Empress renamed her Catherine. The hope would be that she would improve the royal blood line, but Catherine was revulsed by her bumbling, idiotic, and childlike husband-to-be, and instead became romantically involved with opportunistic womanizer Count Alexei (John Lodge) and other military figures. After the birth of a child (of questionable fatherhood), Catherine heard rumors that the Grand Duke had plans to remove her from power and execute her once the Empress passed away; he was also hinting that he would marry his black-haired, feral-looking mistress Countess Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Varonsoff (Ruthelma Stevens). Soon after in 1762, the Empress died, and Catherine realized the gravity of the new political situation once Peter assumed power and gloated over the open coffin of the Empress. Fur-hatted Catherine had other plans (\"Catherine coolly added the army to her list of conquests\"). She was slowly transformed into a sexually-depraved dominatrix ruler with a whip. As predicted, after the death of the Empress, Peter put Catherine under house arrest: (\"My wife is not to leave the palace. She's under arrest until further orders. Am I the Emperor of Russia, or am I not?\"). To consolidate his power, Peter planned to eliminate her. In the bell-ringing conclusion, Catherine (in the white uniform of a male Cossack) had engineered a coup d'etat with the military and Count Orloff (Gavin Gordon), to coordinate the downfall and assassination of Peter III. With the support of the military behind her, she escaped from the palace and rode with a cavalry batallion led by Count Alexei, as he proudly and succinctly affirmed the transfer of power: \"Exit Peter III. Enter Catherine II.\" They proceeded to a military encampment to prepare for the toppling of Russian Emperor Peter III in the palace. The cavalry soldiers (with Catherine in the lead) noisily rode their horses back to the palace; they galloped up the grand staircase into the interior of the palace, and assembled in the throne room where she was crowned as Catherine the Great, Tsarina of Russia. The film's last lines were delivered by Count Orloff to Emperor Peter who had been dethroned: \"There is no emperor. There is only an empress.\" She victoriously ascended the throne with her white stallion horse to take her rightful place before her royal forces after her seizure of power.\n\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel (1934, UK), 97 minutes, D: Harold Young\n\nThis UK film from director Harold Young was one of the greatest historical-adventure films ever made. It told about the double-life of an 18th century aristocrat who disguised himself to save French nobles from Robespierre's Reign of Terror in France. First written as a stage play produced in 1903, it became the first novel (published in 1905) in a series of historical fiction novels written by Hungarian-born English novelist and playwright Baroness Orczy. In the year 1792, during the time of the bloody French Revolution (with the Reign of Terror led by Robespierre), Sir Percy Blakeney (Leslie Howard) posed as a mild-mannered, chivalrous and rich English aristocrat. He was newly married to a beautiful French woman, Lady Marguerite (Merle Oberon). As an English nobleman, he was deeply concerned by news of the slaughter of the aristocratic French, including the deaths of the Marquis de St. Cyr and his family. The devious French Republic's ambassador to England, Monsieur Chauvelin (Raymond Massey) led a Revolutionary tribunal that condemned members of the aristocracy to death. To rescue innocent but condemned French noblemen who faced the guillotine, Sir Blakeney proposed adopting a new mysterious identity - as a dashing and mysterious hero known as \"The Scarlet Pimpernel.\" He took his name from the symbol on his family crest - a deep-red colored English primrose. The Pimpernel's trademark was to leave behind a small red flower - a pimpernel, sometimes in the form of red wax with a floral design (created by the imprint of his signet ring). The name was immortalized in a poem that he recited: \"They seek him here, they seek him there, those Frenchies seek him everywhere. Is he from heaven is he from hell -- that damned elusive Pimpernel.\" Blakeney was the organizer of a daring band of conspirators in a 'secret society' who saved imprisoned French aristocrats, noblemen, and royalists from death (from \"Madame Guillotine\") by smuggling them out of France to England. He took many expeditions to Paris with his fellow compatriots, including his wife's brother Armand St. Just (Walter Rilla), to secretly rescue condemned individuals, while mocking the French Revolutionaries. Blakeney was unable to reveal his secret identity to his new wife when he feared she would be endangered, or that she would divulge his hidden mission. Because of long absences, his costumed attire, his indolence, and his vapid, foppish 'gay' or 'dandy' mannerisms and affectations (to hide his true identity), Blakeney lost the respect of his beloved wife, who remembered him as he used to be before he became limp-wristed and weak. Ironically, she became enamoured and infatuated with her husband's romantic, charming alter-ego. Robespierre became enraged by the Pimpernel's activities, and dispatched villainous Chauvelin to Dover, England, to target members of his arch-enemy's underground movement. In England, Chauvelin learned that Lady Blakeney's brother Armand was allied with the Pimpernel, and coerced her into cooperating in his search, in order to save Armand (she was told he had been captured and arrested by French spies). However, the clever escape artist Sir Percy Blakeney eluded a trap in a library that was set by his would-be captor during a fancy ball held at Lord Grenville's (Allan Jeayes) home. Meanwhile, Lady Blakeney was astounded to learn that the Pimpernel was her own husband. The clue to his real identity was hidden in a huge family portrait of a Blakeney ancestor (Percival Blakeney, the 1st baronet) in her husband's private study; the painting showed him wearing a carved signet ring in the shape of a red primrose (or scarlet pimpernel flower) on his right hand. As the startling revelation came over her, the camera slowly zoomed toward her face; she called out: \"Percy. Percy!\" and raced from the room. She rushed to her husband's side at a French seaside rendezvous site (a tavern known as \"Lion d'Or\"), hoping to save him or die with him. There, after arriving ahead of her husband, she was captured and arrested by Chauvelin (who planned to be disguised as a priest) and she was forced to lure Percy to the inn at 10 pm with a lighted candle from a window as an \"all-clear\" signal; there, Percy was forced to surrender to Chauvelin (in exchange for Lady Blakeney's release). During this climactic confrontational sequence, Sir Percy merged himself into his 'Scarlet Pimpernel' disguise, and was able to outfox, outwit and fool Chauvelin, thus defeating him. The French soldiers in a firing squad that were ordered to execute Blakeney were actually his own men in disguise. Blakeney and his wife were finally reunited and set sail across the Channel back to England (the film's last line: \"Look Marguerite, England!\""
