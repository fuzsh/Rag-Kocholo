        "text": "Maniac is a 1934 American film about a former vaudevillian who assists a mad scientist in reanimating corpses and soon goes mad himself.\n\nDirected by Dwain Esper. Written by Hildagarde Stadie based on the short story The Black Cat by Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nHe Menaced Women with Weird Desires! (taglines)\n\nDon Maxwell\n\n[edit]\n\nI think too much of Satan to use cats as experiments.\n\nIt was in Miersholtz' eyes when he wanted to murder me. It was in Mrs. Buckley's eyes when she wanted to murder her husband. Alice had the gleam in her eye when she wanted to find me. She'd murder me! I must get rid of her. How? Mrs. Buckley! She will help. She must help!\n\nNot only do I look like Meirschultz, I am Meirschultz!\n\nDr. Meirschultz\n\n[edit]\n\nTonight, my dear Maxwell, I'm ready to try my experiment on a human!\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nBuckley: Oh! Stealing through my body! Creeping though my veins! Pouring in my blood! Oh, DARTS OF FIRE IN MY BRAIN! STABBING ME! AGONY! I CAN'T STAND IT! THIS TORTURE! THIS TORMENT! I CAN'T STAND IT! I WON'T!\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nMarvel: It's pretty though. Imagine the poor guy. I'll betcha nobody knows him all his life, and then... Say, wasn't there some guy in history who spent all his life looking for an honest man?\n\nJo: Sure! In his day, men were men, but now they're too scared to be anything but honest.\n\nAlice: If it wasn't for nervy little Alice, you'd all be sinking your weary bones into the soft recesses of some park bench, with light sleepy coverlets made by the great American press.\n\nJo: Press! That reminds me. I have pressing business.\n\nJo: Why don't you ditch that ham and get yourself a rich husband.\n\nAlice: Rich husband? Hah! I've heard they come that way. Not very often.\n\nMarvel: Often enough, but not our way.\n\nAlice: Oh, the girl has brains!\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nHe Menaced Women with Weird Desires!\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBill Woods — Don Maxwell\n\nHorace B.
