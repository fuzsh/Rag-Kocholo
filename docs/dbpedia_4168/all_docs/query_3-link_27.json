It's now considered a classic, but it was shot in only 12 days…",

        "text": "The Thin Man (1934)\n\nWe learn that Clyde and Mimi (Dorothy’s mother) had a nasty divorce, and that things can get rather complicated in the family. This about sums it up:\n\nClyde leaves–his tall, thin shadow leading the way into the night….fade to black.\n\nWe see Dorothy and her fiancé, and learn that Clyde has disappeared even though he was supposed to be back by now. We continue swooping through the crowd to Mr. Nick Charles at the bar. It’s a wonderful first meeting. He’s giving the bartenders a lesson:\n\nDorothy spots him and remembers that he was the detective who helped her father years ago when Clyde was receiving death threats. She tells him her father has disappeared, and Nick suggests she call his lawyer. This gets Dorothy out of the way for one of the best entrances in all of movies. Look out, it’s Nora Charles, arms full of Christmas presents, being pulled into the bar by Asta the terrier:\n\nMimi, (who looks an awful lot like Julia Wolf and shares her liking for platinum waves…) takes the drastic step of calling Julia to see if she can talk with her (i.e. get some money). Please notice the diamond buttons trickling down the back of Mimi’s black satin “house dress” with fur-trimmed sleeves and a modest train.\n\nAnyway, now Mimi and Dorothy are sure that Clyde murdered Julia. Meanwhile, Nick and Nora are throwing a raucous Christmas Eve party. Nora puts on her best striped, floaty dress and her massive diamond cuffs and helps Nick serve copious cocktails. The guests are mainly Nick’s friends from before he married Nora, so there are a lot of petty criminals, drunks, boxers, and ex-cons.\n\nPoor Nick tries to go to sleep, but dear Nora wants to chat (a situation replicated in almost all the sequels). Fortunately, Nick has a small bar in the bedroom, so he’s able to get a night-drink. Adorably peevish Nora asks what he got her for Christmas, leading to another of my favorite moments:\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave\n\nSaveSave"
