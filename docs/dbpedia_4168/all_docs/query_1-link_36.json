        "text": "BOO2! A Madea Halloween took the #1 spot at the box-office this weekend, opening in the top spot for the second year in a row.\n\nThe Halloween comedy raked in $21.2 million across 2,388 theaters in its first 3 days, meeting industry predictions almost to the dollar. A sequel repeating a top-spot opening only twelve months after the first film was released is a monumental feat for any comedy, but box-office success is nothing new for Tyler Perry, the filmâ€™s director, producer, writer, and actor. In fact, most of the films Perry has made over the past 17 years have opened in the top three spots domestically."
