Colmar, situated in the northeastern part of France’s Alsace region, is a charming little town that captivates visitors with its picturesque beauty and rich history. With its well-preserved medieval old town and stunning blend of German and French architectural styles, Colmar is a must-visit destination for those wanting to explore a picture-perfect Atlassian town.

A visit to Colmar is a must-stop while spending a weekend in Alsace. Its reputation as a pretty town is firmly established, and frankly, it is completely well-deserved! It’s a true picture-postcard town, where it’s extremely pleasant to wander around. I don’t believe that I know one single person who didn’t fall under the spell of Colmar! As for me, I can’t get enough of it, even if I have lived there and that I have explored it countless times with friends visiting it for the first time.

I was drawn to Colmar after hearing stories and seeing photos from other bloggers that painted a portrait of a picture-perfect town that couldn’t fail to charm (thanks Erin and Simon for the tip!). It’s in the Alsace region of France, right next to Germany, and you can see the German influence everywhere, from the architecture to the pretzel-filled menus. It would be easy to think you’re in Bavaria, save for the stylish window shutters and macaroon-filled bakeries that add a distinctive French touch.
