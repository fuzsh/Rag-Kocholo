        "text": "Colmar, baron von der Goltz (born Aug. 12, 1843, near Labiau, East Prussia [now Polessk, Russia]—died April 19, 1916, Baghdad, Iraq, Ottoman Empire [now in Iraq]) was a Prussian soldier, military teacher, and writer. He was an imperial German field marshal who reorganized the Turkish army (1883–96), and who served as commander in chief of Turkish forces against the British in Mesopotamia (Iraq) during World War I. Despite his advanced age, he successfully conducted the 143-day siege of General Sir Charles Townshend’s British contingent at Kut (1915–16).\n\nA soldier from 1861, Goltz taught military history at the military academy in Berlin (1878–83) and gained a reputation as one of Germany’s major theorists of warfare. Sent to Turkey in June 1883, he modernized its army so effectively that, after his return to Germany, Turkey was winning the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 decisively until the major European powers intervened to stop the conflict.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nUnderstanding the Ottoman Empire\n\nIn August 1914, the first month of World War I, Goltz was appointed governor-general of German-occupied Belgium. In November of that year he became aide-de-camp to the Ottoman sultan Mehmed V. Placed in command of the Turkish First Army in Mesopotamia, he halted Townshend’s Anglo-Indian army at Ctesiphon on Nov. 22, 1915, and then, on December 8, trapped Townshend inside Kut. After Goltz’s troops had repulsed a large British relief force, Townshend surrendered on April 29, 1916. According to the official report, Goltz had died of typhus, but it has been said that he was poisoned by the revolutionary Young Turks.\n\nAmong Goltz’s military writings is his classic Das Volk in Waffen (1883; The Nation in Arms)."
