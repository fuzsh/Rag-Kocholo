        "text": "Alsace is a region located in eastern France. It’s known for its picturesque towns, colorful half-timbered houses, and exceptional wines.\n\nIn 2019, I moved to the capital of Alsace, Strasbourg, and since then, I’ve visited every corner of this beautiful region.\n\nFrom Colmar’s Little Venice to Riquewihr’s medieval ramparts, there isn’t a place I haven’t been to.\n\nIn this post, I’ll share with you the most beautiful towns in Alsace and the best things to see and do in each one.\n\nPlease note: This post contains affiliate links, meaning I may earn a commission if you make a purchase by clicking on a link (at no extra cost to you). Privacy Policy.\n\n19 Most Beautiful Towns in Alsace\n\nThere’s no shortage of amazing towns to visit in Alsace. From beautiful panoramic vistas to savory traditional dishes, every village has something special to offer.\n\nHere are the most charming Alsatian villages that I recommend you visit while you’re here.\n\n1. Strasbourg\n\nStrasbourg is the economic and cultural hub of Alsace. Here you’ll find a true mix of French and German cultures. Not only that but it’s also the formal seat of the European Parliament.\n\nHighlights include the Strasbourg Cathedral, the Alsatian Museum, and, of course, the Christmas market.\n\nBut my all-time favorite thing to do is wander around La Petite France early in the morning, especially on Sundays.\n\nIf you head to Quai des Moulins, you’ll have a beautiful view of Place Benjamin Zix. That’s where I took the photo above.\n\nI recommend spending more than one day in Strasbourg if you want to take advantage of all this city has to offer.\n\n2. Colmar\n\nColmar is most renowned for its colorful half-timbered medieval and early Renaissance buildings. It’s easy to get lost in the side streets while admiring the gorgeous architecture.\n\nNeedless to say, there are endless things to see in Colmar.\n\nI’ve been to Colmar so many times, it’s hard to choose my favorite spot.\n\nBut if I had to pick, it would be Little Venice, a charming neighborhood with picturesque canals and traditional houses.\n\nI also loved touring the Unterlinden Museum and riding in a gondola down the Lauch River.\n\n3. Riquewihr\n\nRiquewihr is easily one of the most picturesque villages I’ve been to in Alsace. It has retained its rustic charm from the 16th century.\n\nThe cobblestone streets, flower-decked windows, and old-fashioned signs make you feel like you’ve stepped back in time.\n\nRue du Général de Gaulle was my favorite street. It’s lined with quaint shops selling local specialties and colorful half-timbered houses.\n\nIt’s also where you’ll find Restaurant le Médiéval, the best restaurant in town (photo above).\n\nI also enjoyed touring the Musée du Dolder and Musée de la Tour des Voleurs. Both are worth it if you have time.\n\n4. Ribeauvillé\n\nRibeauvillé is full of narrow streets adorned with medieval-style houses and cafés.\n\nIt’s most known for its three castles – Château de Saint-Ulrich, Château du Girsberg, and Château du Haut-Ribeaupierre.\n\nThey are free to visit, but you’ll have to hike a steep hill to get there.\n\nIt took me about 90 minutes, and it was worth every step. The views over the region were absolutely spectacular.\n\nOf the three castles, I found Château de Saint-Ulrich to be the most impressive. It was the most intact and best preserved.\n\nHelpful Tip: For the best view of Château de Saint-Ulrich, head to Château du Girsberg. That’s where I took the photo above.\n\nThen, if you are in Ribeauvillé on the first Sunday in September, don’t miss the Fête des Ménétriers de Ribeauvillé (also called Pfifferdaj).\n\nIt’s one of the oldest and most popular festivals in Alsace!\n\n5. Eguisheim\n\nLocated 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Colmar, lies yet another charming town in Alsace, Eguisheim. Like many others, it has won several awards, including the most beautiful village in France.\n\nBut this is not the only reason tourists flock here.\n\nEguisheim has a long-standing reputation for producing the best wines in the region.\n\nI’ve visited several wineries and my two favorites were Domaine Mann and Domaine Emile Beyer.\n\nThen, if you’re like me and love to hike, you’ll find tons of trails around Eguisheim.\n\nThe most famous leads to Les Trois Châteaux d’Eguisheim (The Three Castles of Eguisheim). I started on Rue Porte Haute and it took me about 75 minutes.\n\nThe castles were in ruins but the views over the town were incredible. I, then, followed the Route des 5 Châteaux to Château du Hohlandsbourg, the largest intact castle in the region.\n\n6. Kaysersberg\n\nKaysersberg or Emperor’s Mountain received its name from the high fortress, Château de Kaysersberg, that overlooks the village.\n\nWhile it served as an important strategic location in the past, it’s now one of the prettiest towns in Alsace.\n\nPopular activities include hiking in the Vosges mountains, biking on one of the many trails, and enjoying delicious wine.\n\nBut my favorite thing to do was watch the sunrise from Château de Kaysersberg. The view over the valley was incredible and I loved the peaceful setting.\n\n7. Rosheim\n\nRosheim dates back to the 8th century, and, to this day, it has retained many relics of its glorious past.\n\nThe most impressive is the Église Saints-Pierre-et-Paul (photo above). In fact, it’s considered to be one of the most beautiful Romanesque churches in the region.\n\nAfter I toured the cathedral, I stopped by Salon de thé Rohmer.\n\nNot only is this the oldest bakery in Alsace, but it also serves the best ropküeche (a sweet cake topped with nuts and cinnamon) I’ve ever had.\n\n8. Obernai\n\nObernai is one of the larger cities in Alsace, and it serves as a gateway to Alsace’s famous Route des Vins (Wine Route).\n\nHere you’ll find one of my favorite viewpoints in the entire region, Mont National.\n\nThis historical monument pays tribute to the Alsatian soldiers, who were forced to serve under the German army in World War II.\n\nThen, behind it is Allée des Cerisiers, a street lined with the biggest cherry trees I’ve ever seen. They bloom every year in April, so, if you’re in the area, it’s worth stopping by.\n\n9. Barr\n\nBarr is an undiscovered gem in Alsace. Most who venture this way stop in Obernai and continue south without ever giving Barr a thought.\n\nWhile there are not an overwhelming number of highlights, I found Barr to be absolutely beautiful.\n\nI’ve also used it as a base for day hikes in the area. My favorites were Landsberg Castle and Mont Sainte Odile. Both trails start at the Saint-Martin Protestant Church.\n\n10. Dambach-la-Ville\n\nDambach-la-Ville is one of the best places to visit in Alsace, especially if you don’t have a car. Highlights include Saint Sébastien Chapel and Château de Bernstein.\n\nAs the oldest wine-growing village in the region, touring a wine cellar should be at the top of your itinerary.\n\nI’ve toured several cellars here and my favorite was Maison Charles Frey.\n\nTours and tastings are free, but you’ll need to book a reservation if you want to guarantee a spot.\n\nHelpful Tip: Maison Charles Frey is also listed as Alsace Charles Frey on Google Maps.\n\n11. Munster\n\nMunster is one of the most underrated towns I’ve been to, but let me assure you there are a ton of things to see here.\n\nMeander around the city and appreciate the unique architecture or stop at a fromagerie (cheese house) and try some Munster cheese. Of the places I’ve tried, Maison Dischinger easily had the best.\n\nBut the biggest reason to stop by is for the outdoor activities.\n\nThe easiest hike follows the Chemin du Narrenstein (Narrenstein trail). It leads to a beautiful view of the city. That’s, actually, where I captured the scene in the above photo.\n\n12. Andlau\n\nFrom enchanting castles and magnificent churches to beautiful scenery and pristine hiking trails, Andlau has everything.\n\nIt was even labeled as one of the most adored villages in France in 2014.\n\nSome highlights include:\n\n✓Abbaye d’Andlau – A beautiful Romanesque church from 880.\n\n✓ Kastelberg Gazebo – A small gazebo that overlooks the town. It’s where I took the photo above.\n\n✓ La Seigneurie – A cultural heritage museum dedicated to the history of Alsace (particularly the area around Andlau and Barr).\n\nAfter I toured the town, I hiked to Château d’Andlau and then Château de Spesbourg. Both castles were free to visit and worth the long uphill hike.\n\nIf you only have time for one, I recommend Château d’Andlau. It’s not as far and most of the castle is still intact.\n\n13. Hunawihr\n\nHunawihr lies between Riquewihr and Ribeauvillé, and, while it may not be as popular as these two, it’s worth a visit.\n\nThis little town is home to less than 1000 people and is a great place to escape the tourist crowds.\n\nI loved walking through the vineyards and taking in the amazing scenery. It’s also one of the best places to view Hunawihr’s Fortified Church.\n\nHelpful Tip: The times I’ve gone to Hunawihr, I’ve stayed in either Riquewihr or Ribeauvillé and visited as a day trip.\n\n14. Mittelbergheim\n\nSince moving to Alsace, I’ve been to Mittelbergheim more times than I can count. It’s far from the more popular places, so I always have it to myself.\n\nAnd unlike the other towns listed here, it’s not known for its colorful half-timbered houses. In fact, Mittelbergheim is a true wine-growers village.\n\nMost houses on the main street (Rue Principale) are wineries and offer tastings.\n\nMy favorite was Domaine Armand Gilg Vigneron Indépendant Vins et Crémants d’Alsace.\n\nThey first gave me a tour of their cellars from the 16th century and then I tried a wide variety of wines. The best was their Crémant d’Alsace.\n\n15. Guebwiller\n\nGuebwiller is my home away from home. There are so many nature and outdoor activities here that I keep coming back.\n\nMy favorite hike, so far, was to the Grand Ballon. It’s the highest peak (1424 meters or 4671 feet) in the Vosges mountains and offers incredible views of the region.\n\nIt was a strenuous hike, but I was able to do it in a day. It’s 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) from the town center so make sure to bring lots of water and snacks.\n\nHelpful Tip: You can also drive to the top.\n\nIf you’re short on time or don’t want to tackle the Grand Ballon, Guebwiller has plenty of things to see.\n\nHighlights include the Romanesque church of Saint Léger, the Convent of the Dominicans, the Synagogue of Guebwiller, and the Theodore Deck and Museum.\n\n16. Turckheim\n\nOn the eastern slopes of the Vosges mountains lies a hidden gem that is rarely talked about, Turckheim.\n\nThis quaint Alsatian village is small but boasts some of the most spectacularly beautiful streets I’ve ever seen.\n\nOne of my favorites was Rue de Conseil.\n\nAs you can see in the photo I took above, every building was covered with hanging baskets of colorful flowers and lush vines.\n\nHelpful Tip: If you want the same picture, head to Jardin de la Ville.\n\nAfter I finished walking around, I stopped by the Boulangerie Pâtisserie Husser for a homemade sandwich, before touring the Musée Mémorial des combats de la Poche de Colmar.\n\n17. Cernay\n\nCernay is most known for its Stork Park.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of spring, around 60 strokes flock to this little town. It not only marks the end of winter, but also symbolizes new life, fertility, and happiness.\n\nCernay has played a critical role in their conservation, with nearly 30 storks being born each year. Their nests are dotted on the rooftops throughout the town, and they visit the park during mealtimes.\n\nI went early in the morning and saw about 10 storks.\n\nI spent an hour admiring these beautiful birds before heading to the Musée de la Porte de Thann in downtown Cernay.\n\n18. Sélestat\n\nSélestat is located between Strasbourg and Colmar, which means it’s a great base for exploring the area.\n\nIt’s, actually, where I took the shuttle to visit the Haut-Koenigsbourg Castle.\n\nOf course, the city itself is full of things to do.\n\nMy favorite attraction was the Humanist Library.\n\nHere you’ll find thousands of artifacts on display, some dating to the 15th century. Not only that but it’s also one of the most significant cultural wonders in Alsace to visit.\n\n19. Kruth\n\nNestled in the mountains, at the end of the train line, lies an absolute hidden gem, Kruth. It’s so secluded that you won’t find this Alsatian town in any guidebook.\n\nHere you’ll find beautiful vistas, gushing waterfalls, and endless hiking trails. If you love nature and the outdoors, you could spend a few days here, but one day is enough if you’re short on time.\n\nThe first thing I did when I arrived was hike to Château du Wildenstein. From there, I had a magnificent panoramic view over Kruth (photo above).\n\nThen, I followed the Tour du Lac de Kruth-Wildenstein around the lake, stopping by Cascade du Bockloch along the way.\n\nMap of Alsace Towns\n\nBelow is a map of the Alsatian villages that will be covered in this post. (Click the map to open Google Maps.)\n\nBest Time to Visit Alsace\n\nAlsace is a year-round destination where each season offers something unique.\n\nSpring (March to May) – The weather is mild, and the villages are decorated with fresh, vibrant flowers. The summer crowds have not arrived, so prices are reasonable.\n\nSummer (June to August) – Alsace is alive and bustling with tourists. This is one of the busiest periods of the year. The sun is almost always shining, and the vineyards are in full bloom. Expect higher prices and book everything in advance.\n\nFall (September to November) – This is my favorite time to tour around Alsace. The weather is mild, and the summer crowds are long gone. The vineyards turn bright orange, and the trees radiate with magnificent fall colors.\n\nWinter (December to February) – This is another busy time. In December, Alsace transforms into a winter wonderland as the Christmas markets start to open. The weather is cold and rainy, so make sure to bring warm clothing.\n\nGetting Around Alsace\n\nWhile the region is not gigantic, getting around Alsace can be tricky, especially for the smaller towns. Below I’ll cover the best ways to get around Alsace.\n\nBy Tour\n\nVisiting Alsace as part of a tour is the most convenient way to see the area. You won’t have to worry about organizing every step of the process or getting lost. Everything is planned so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy your trip.\n\nBy Car\n\nIf you prefer to travel at your own pace, then renting a car is the best option. You’ll have complete control over your itinerary and be able to plan exactly what you want to do. It will even give you a chance to get off the typical tourist path.\n\nBy Train\n\nTaking a train is the cheapest option. Keep in mind that several of the smaller villages don’t have train stations. So, you won’t get to visit these places, but you’ll still be able to see the main highlights.\n\nBy Bike\n\nIf you’re up for an adventure then renting a bike is the best option. There are tons of biking paths, including the Alsace Wine Route.\n\nFAQS About Alsace\n\nConclusion: Prettiest Villages in Alsace\n\nAlsace is a must-see region in France. Whether you love history, culture, or nature, there is no shortage of things to do.\n\nVisit the cobbled streets of Eguisheim or sample a glass of wine in Dambach-la-Ville.\n\nEither way, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nSo, now, all that’s left to do is plan your trip. I recommend booking a tour of the region. You’ll be able to sit back relax and enjoy our well-deserved vacation.\n\nRead More Articles About France\n\nI hope you enjoyed my article and found it helpful.
