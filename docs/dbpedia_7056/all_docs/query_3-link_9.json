        "text": "I normally limit day trips to 1-1/2 hrs each way, but in this case I might go ahead and do it as long as you're not expecting to explore those cities in depth. It would also depend on what time of year.\n\nIf you're going in December and want to see the Christmas markets it might be worth a really long day. If you're willing to leave Paris early (say by 8:00 am) and return late evening (say around 8-9 pm) you could do a loop. Take the train to Strasbourg and arrive by 10:00 am, see the Cathedral, visit the Christmas market and have lunch, then take an early afternoon train to Colmar (about 30min by train), spend the rest of the afternoon in Colmar, walk around the town, see Little Venice, visit the Unterlinden museum for an hour or so and then maybe have an early dinner at the Christmas market, then train back to Paris - leave Colmar around 6:00 pm.\n\nIf going in late Spring through early Fall, you could substitute a canal boat ride and more wandering around the city centers for the Christmas markets.\n\nLike I said, a long exhausting day, but might be worth it to you, depending on what you're expecting to see and do.\n\ndavey1108, I wonder if you'd care to post your current tentative itinerary? I think some of your past posts have been deleted, or at least \"Rick Can't Find This Page.\"\n\nOf course, it's your vacation, to plan as you wish. You don't seem to have described your scheme very much, but I get vibrations that this is your family's first trip to Europe. It's not likely to be your last, either. Since Paris is one of the great cities of the world, I wonder if you are being a little too ... capricious ... in tacking on outings. Our first trip to Paris, and our first trip to Europe after getting married in 1980, was 7 nights. After many additional stops there, we certainly have not exhausted the resources of this city. (In fairness, I should admit that we daytripped to Versailles one day, and to Giverny (train) another. But those are trivially short trips, with two meals still in Paris each day, and some walking around Paris. Both those trips were high on our list, and we were glad we went.)\n\nIt would also be useful to know if you, so far, have any other stops in France. You have posted about MSM (Mont St. Michel), and I also wonder if you may be planning to visit the Normandy beaches as well? In this case, I partly ask because it's entirely the opposite direction from Colmar and Alsace. It's just not a good idea to try and visit \"all of France\" in one week. Have you read any of Rick's general guidelines for trips to Europe? His books are in most public libraries, if you don't want to buy.\n\nI'm not sure it's a fair comparison, but would a French family reject a visit to our The White House because it's just a \"big house?\" Besides being beautiful, and having vast acres of gardens and pavilions in the gardens, Versailles has been the site of a lot of world history and art and music. I only bring this up in the hope that you won't accidentally miss out on the real purpose of travel, discovery. I don't mean to deny your right to set your itinerary.\n\nStrasbourg and Colmar are very nice, but there are conceptually similar (if perhaps from a different century) towns all over Europe. If your next trip to Europe isn't France, you'll probably have equally good options. I mean, there's a tourism circuit in Germany, with dozens of towns, called \"The Half-Timbered Road\". In fairness, many of these towns have some more modern houses mixed in, but some of them are quite \"pure\". This is not your \"only chance.\"\n\ndavey1108, I wonder if you'd care to post your current tentative itinerary?

In fairness, many of these towns have some more modern houses mixed in, but some of them are quite \"pure\". This is not your \"only chance.\"\n\nI appreciate this. Here's some context:\n\nMy health is declining for various reasons AND we'll soon have our first child in college. As a result, it's highly likely this WILL be our only European trip with our kids while I'm still of \"normal\" health. So, yes, we're trying to pack a bunch in. I know it's not ideal, but due to recent diagnoses, we also don't have much of a choice.\n\nRegarding Versailles: That's a fair point, we'll consider it (it hasn't been completely axed).\n\nIn term of itinerary, we've cut MSM and Normandy, so we have 6-7 days to see:\n\nHighlights of Paris\n\nLouvre\n\nGiverny\n\nMaybe some of the Loire Valley chateaus\n\nColmar/Strasbourg (or something similar)\n\nRiver Seine Sunset Cruise\n\nDavey not to muddy the water too much, but to many people Paris is almost like a drug. They love it and can't get enough of it. personally I feel Paris' strong force when I go there, to an extent understand it and certainly enjoy it. But honestly I'm ready to leave after a couple/few days. It's an amazing city, but it's still a big city, and I'm just not that into it.\n\nAnd there are still other who dislike Paris and actively work to stay away from it. The Frenchman who married my neighbor's nanny for instance live in Paris because of work, yet he thoroughly hates Paris, can't wait to get away from it.\n\nYou are going to hear a lot of \"Paris is a drug\" people tell you that a week in France's most intoxicating locale is barely sufficient to even get started there. That's true for them, and I can sympathize with their perspectives. But certainly not true for me, and maybe not true for you. We are all different, so know yourself. If you're the type who'd thrive off a full week in NYC you'd probably feel the same about Paris.\n\nThe train to Strasbourg from Paris is safe at any time of day, as is the train from Strasbourg to Colmar. The Paris train station you'd like depart from is also safe, although it is a big city train station with the usual cast of scumbags looking to grab a purse or con you out of your wallet. But you'll keep you head up and be fine.\n\nI'll also push back on the notion that Alsace isn't unique. I most certainly is, both in architecture and culture. If you want to see it, it's well worth your time. Last summer I went back for the fourth time in my last six trips, albeit a couple of those were stops of convenience passing through as opposed to a select destination.\n\nYou say 2.5 hours on the train from Zurich like it's a tough assignment. The train though is so easy and generally relaxing and pleasant. Look out the window and see new and interesting landscapes, catch up culling your photos, eat a yummy sandwich or pastry from the train station. In the US I do tend to think of transit hour as mild forms of torture, but in Europe I actually look forward sitting on the train, exhaling fully, and taking it easy for a bit.\n\nSo if it was me, and of course I'm not you, I'd fly to Zurich, train to Colmar, and post up in a nice AirBnB for 3 night. Day trip to Strasbourg and visit on of the pretty villages too. Then 4 or maybe 5 nights in Paris.\n\nI do think that Paris at the end of a trip is nice. It's the major leagues of Euro travel and I like to do it when I need my energy lifted and when I know I'm out soon so willing to go all in.\n\nMy wife and I certainly started out with the Great Cities of Europe, partly because they are easier to visit by train, and that kind of trip is more affordable for the young people we were at the time. I'm not going to defend big cities, although I might point out that there is a certain advantage (time and money) in a city's \"collection\" of \"beautiful places\" in \"captivity\". I don't mean that a visit to Colmar can be replaced with the contents of a museum; I just mean that the OP might have really enjoyed the Cluny Museum, the Louvre Decorative Arts Museum, or even Invalides. (I personally was insufficiently taught in school about the importance of Napoleon in the history of the World.) But he'll be rushing from one booked (if high profile) appointment to another in Paris, for a few days.\n\nI am arguing that a stroll and a seat on a park bench near the Tour St. Jacques, facing the Mairie, then walking around the historic Theatre du Chatelet, having an outdoor dinner nearby, is the kind of slow-paced immersion in another culture that's hard to find. I am also a little worried that the OP may not be doing enough formal research, and may (generational thing ... ) relying too much on \"the internet.\" That's what I meant by \"capricious\", not a criticism of his interests!\n\nThat said, Colmar is an excellent choice, because it is good for more than one day. Some related places, (which are not \"near Paris\") like Perouges, Vitré, Dinan, Guédelon are not as rich destinations. However, Aix, Avignon are, but not half-timbered. Having spent a week in Alsace with a car, I would mention that other (lovely) Alsace towns can be a little hard to negotiate without a car.\n\nThe OP might investigate whether he wants to visit Stein am Rhine or Aarau as a daytrip from Zurich. If they are spending more time in Basel than in Zurich, perhaps Freiburg or someplace in the Black Forest might deliver what's needed. I'm not sure why Switzerland (i.e. a detour) is essential if there is no time in the real mountains. I mean, Zurich and Basel are loaded with culture and history, but they are not \"better\" than Paris or Venice, and they are not very old-fashioned.\n\nI'm not a big nightlife guy, in any sense of the word. We once made a special effort to be in Paris (maybe our 10th time there) on Quatorze Juillet. That was just fine, but they light up the Eiffel Tower (without fireworks) pretty often. And we paid a fortune for a room with a balcony so we could avoid the Champ de Mars crowd.\n\nBut as a big daytripper (once went to Lille from Antwerp for the art museum, 3 hours each way), it's a misunderstanding of the purpose of daytrips to move heaven and earth to see a few video projections on a cathedral! Maybe hundreds of real candles on the facade of a Loire chateau, but all the same ... . For a limited total days, last good-health trip, you need high-value targets. Sorry to sound cynical, but even the interactive Van Gogh video is a better use of your time.\n\nIf you're not going to sleep, the main danger on a pre-midnight train is drunken bachelorettes with sashes, walking the length of the train singing. You hope they're near a bathroom if the booze gets to them. Do you use public transportation at home? You meet ... the public. But in Europe, not only poor people use the train.\n\nFred, actually that bachelorette story happened to us twice. And it happens many nights on the street, say, in Antwerp. But it was in Belgium, where the train line between Brugge and Brussels is a sort of subway-train of daily life. In fairness, the train between Rouen and Paris is not a major student and commuter line.\n\nConsidering how much safer Europe is than the United States, it always puzzles me that Americans are so worried about street crime. It's key that the OP was asking about non-\"overnight\" travel, where there have been (even, here) intermittent reports of sleeper's pockets being rifled. But even before the decline of overnight trains, I've never sought to save a night's hotel cost, to sleep on a train.\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k14139393-Safety-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nI want to add that I was trying to point out that projections on a building are a sort of \"derivative\" attraction. I remember when Leonard Bernstein set up an easel with a reproduction of a Monet \"Rouen Cathedral\" as part of his Young People's Concerts discussion of Impressionism. But as a stagehand, I've set up a lot of TV projectors, and I've paid to see several (indoor) video projects, like Van Gogh, and the Cunard building rotunda. I just think it's not the right basis for a daytrip, especially one with an exhausting late-return. Unfortunately, I've never been to Chartres or Rouen.\n\n@ Tim.....I don't share the view that night trains are on the decline as many new routes have been added in the last couple of years, certainly not based on what I've seen in central and east-central Europe. Postings to that effect one has seen on this forum.\n\nNumerous people take night trains, but what I've seen is that for sure they aren't Americans, (this is summer travel) , almost exclusively Europeans, ie, Germans, Italians, etc., a few Asians too. You listen to the languages spoken on the train platform, look at the numbers of people standing there waiting for night train to pull in, or as the passengers are on board trying to find their compartment. What you do not hear are anglophones.\n\nNever had any concerns at all pertaining to my personal safety on a night train (DB or OeBB) sitting solo in a six seat compartment or in the general seating area amongst strangers. I am as much a stranger to them as well. Yes, taking the night train option is to save a hotel night plus stretching out another travel day.\n\nFred, we too miss the night trains. We have taken several and always enjoyed them. Davey, the Swiss Air flights look good and a decent price. Fly to Zurich and catch the train to Colmar/Strasbourg. It's an easy trip. We have done it a couple of times. It goes by fast. Once in Strasbourg, you will love it. Then take the high speed to Paris when you are ready - less than 2 hrs and you are there. We have done that train many times. Colmar is charming, but we felt eh ...a day there was enough. Strasbourg is bigger, offers more restaurants, and things to do. Train station is an easy walk to most areas. There are a couple of rental car places by the train station if you want to day trip to Riquewihr or Ribeauville, or some of the smaller villages around the Colmar area. Don't get us wrong - Colmar is charming, but if with kids, Strasbourg offers more. The Petite France District reminds us of a Harry Potter movie. Very charming. We also took a 1/2 day trip over to Gengenbach, Germany from Strasbourg. It was a charming village, easy to get to by train. Probably 30 minutes tops. Another 30 min. and you can train to Baden Baden. The possibilities are endless. We are included in those who feel the drug of Paris. Love it. Go at least twice a year. That being said, you can do a lot for your first trip in 3-4 days. Hit the big sights, you can cover a lot of ground. Depends on how much you want to do and see."
