Please ask a member of our team.\n\nI am going skiing, do you offer snow chains?\n\nYes. In most French mountainous municipalities (Alps, Corsica, Central mountain, Jura Mountains, Pyrenees, Vosges Mountains), it is mandatory in winter, by virtue of the Mountain law, to have snow chains in the boot of the vehicle, or to drive a vehicle fitted with winter tires. If your rental location is in a department where the Mountain law applies, the vehicle will be automatically equipped with it, and the price of your rental will automatically be increased with the cost of the corresponding option. If you decide not to subscribe to such option, and upon return of the vehicle we find that the snow chains have been used, you will be charged the corresponding price.\n\nYou can also opt to book a category of vehicle fitted with winter tires.\n\nSnow chains may also be available in some other rental locations, please check with the rental location. The price of snow chains appears in our Tariff conditions.. If any snow chain is damaged, lost or stolen, you’ll have to pay for a replacement pair. If you can show the damage or loss was not in any way your fault or due to your negligence, we will refund this cost to you.\n\nWe can not fit snow chains for you, and we can not arrange for them to be fitted.\n\nNot sure if you need snow chains? Please ask a member of our team.\n\nI have brought my own skis with me, do you rent ski racks?\n\nYes, some rental locations offer ski racks.

If you rent the vehicle for more than 7 days, you will only be charged for a maximum of 7 days and get to use the ski rack for the duration of your rental, up to 30 days.\n\nSki racks can not be fitted to all our vehicles, so you may need to upgrade if you need one. This may increase the price of the vehicle and any excess you have to pay.\n\nIf the ski rack is damaged, lost or stolen, you will have to pay for a replacement. This is likely to cost 50 EUR on top of the hire fee. If you can show the damage or loss was not in any way your fault or due to your negligence, we will refund this cost to you.\n\nPlease give us at least 24 hours notice if you want to hire a ski rack.\n\nI have left my hands-free kit behind, do you rent them?\n\nNo, unfortunately we do not offer hands-free kits at this time.\n\nI am moving items, do you rent blankets?\n\nNo, unfortunately we do not offer blankets at this time.\n\nI am moving items, do you rent trolleys?\n\nNo, unfortunately we do not offer trolleys at this time.\n\nOptional extras available to buy\n\nI have left my USB charger behind do you sell them?\n\nNo, unfortunately we do not sell USB chargers at this time.\n\nI have left my mobile charger behind, do you sell them?\n\nNo, unfortunately we do not sell mobile chargers at this time.\n\nI want to charge my device in the car, do you sell car chargers?\n\nNo, unfortunately we do not sell car chargers at this time.\n\nI have left my iPhone 5 cable behind, do you sell them?\n\nNo, unfortunately we do not sell iPhone 5 cables at this time.\n\nCan I let anyone else drive?\n\nYes, but only if we have approved them.
