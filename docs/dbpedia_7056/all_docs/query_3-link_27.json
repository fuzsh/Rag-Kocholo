        "text": "When I first read about the fairytale village of Colmar, I knew I had to visit. As soon as the borders opened back up, we headed straight to Colmar. Located in the Alsace region along the border between France and Germany, Colmar is known for its colorful houses and the cutest Christmas market. Wandering the streets of Colmar is like stepping into a fairytale. It is said that it was the inspiration for Beauty and the Beast, and there is even a fountain that looks like the one in the movie. We only spent a day in Colmar, but we plan to spend more time at Christmas when the market is open. Colmar can become very touristy so I recommend getting there as early as possible or staying the night so you can enjoy the village without the crowds. We were lucky and it was not crowded the day we went.\n\nExplore Old Town\n\nWandering around Old Town is my favorite thing to do. This gorgeous timbered house is one of the most famous spots in Colmar to take pictures. It is decorated for every season. During Christmas, this area of Colmar turns into a holiday wonderland. I can’t wait to come back and see all the beautiful decorations. Old Town is the most charming part of Colmar with its colorful buildings, flowers on every window, and cute cafes.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nThere are so many cafes to choose from, but we decided to eat at Brasserie des Tanneurs. We had the most delicious lunch sitting outside this cute little cafe. We tried our first Flammkuchen. It’s a thin pizza with cream sauce instead of tomato sauce. It was so good! You can also try some of the famous wines from the Alsace region.\n\nExplore Little Venice\n\nLittle Venice or “La petite Venice” is the most picturesque part of town. With its gorgeous colorful timbered houses lined along the canal, it is the most romantic place to take pictures and enjoy the beauty of Colmar. It is called Little Venice because of the canals that run through the town. You can have lunch or dinner at one of the cafes along the canal. There is even outside seating areas that are over the water that would make for a very romantic dinner. You can also take a boat ride through the canals and take in the best views of the village from the water.\n\nTake a Picture in Front of Colmar’s Fountain:\n\nIt is believed that Colmar was one of the cute French villages that inspired the movie “Beauty and the Beast.” This fountain surrounded by all the colorful timbered houses looks a lot like the one in the movie. So I just had to stop and take a few pictures in front of it.\n\nWhere to Stay in Colmar\n\nThere are so many cute places to stay in Colmar. We did not stay the night, but we were looking for the perfect place to stay when we come back for Christmas. We decided to book our stay at the Hotel Saint-Martin. It is situated in the heart of Old Town and makes for the perfect place to explore the village during the Christmas market. It’s a historic mansion house that dates back to 1361, which has conserved its authentic charm and character.\n\nAnother great place to stay is Hotel Le Colombier. It’s located in the historic centre of Colmar, in the ‘Little Venice’ district. It also makes for the perfect place to explore the village of Colmar.\n\nLa Maison des Têtes is the only 5 star hotel in Colmar. It embodies the simple elegance of stately mansion homes that over the centuries refined the art of hosting. It showcases its cultural heritage through its gorgeous hotel and delicious restaurant.\n\nVisit The Audie Murphy Memorial\n\nSo this is not directly in Colmar, but it is about 15 minutes outside the city. This was another place that was at the top of our list to visit once we moved to Germany. Brandon’s grandfather was married to Nadine, Audie Murphy’s sister, so we have heard lots of stories about him growing up. Nadine always loved it when Brandon would join in the celebration on Audie Murphy Day in Farmersville, Texas. Audie Murphy was one of the most decorated American soldiers of World War II. We visited the exact spot where he at the age of 19 single-handedly held off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in January 1945. He then lead a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery.\n\nColmar truly is a magical fairytale village not to be missed. If you want to feel like you just stepped foot into a Disney movie, I highly recommend this cute village. We can’t wait to go back this winter for the Christmas market!"
