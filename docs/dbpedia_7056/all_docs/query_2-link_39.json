        "text": "Colmar is one those aesthetic places that once you set eyes on it, you simply won’t be happy until you visit. That was certainly the case with me. When I got there this June, it didn’t disappoint either. I instantly fell in love with its style. It is postcard perfect, and above all it is this which has encouraged me to write a blog based on my photos of Colmar. Some places need words to show their beauty and intrigue. Colmar most certainly doesn’t. Truthfully wilting it down to 50 photos was the biggest challenge. I’m not blowing my own trumpet, Colmars architects deserve all the credit. It is their artistic talent I celebrate today and not mine.\n\nColmar is located in the east of France, in the region of Alsace. It borders Germany, and was in fact part of Germany for some time in the aftermath of the Franco- Prussian wars. The end of World War I saw it annexed again, and after a brief uprising settling to its present day status as part of France. This was a struggle that dated from the earlier stages of Alsace, and this history is important in understanding the architectural evolution of this fine city.\n\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links, which means I may receive a commission if you click a link and purchase something that I have recommended. While clicking these links won’t cost you any money, it will help keep this site going and me travelling. Thank you for your support.\n\nMy top 50 Photos of Colmar\n\nIt’s not that all roads in Colmar lead to Le Petite Venise (or little Venice), it’s just that most visitors paths lead there first. Therefore it’s a good place for me to start! For more on the charms of this area you can in addition check out the local Colmar website.\n\nLittle Venice\n\nA tour of little Venice is best began at Boulevard St Pierre, and its quaint little bridge. It overlooks the start of the area, and also the Promenade En Barque, which is the perfect place to take a leisurely boat ride. The flowers and the boats completely add to the romance of the location. I’m sure some men have dropped to their knee right here.\n\nLittle Venice is best known by the view on Rue Turenne, and it’s the first formal introduction to those multi coloured timber houses. If you are looking for an insta-popular photo, then this is the place. We fell into that trap too, as soon as 45000 people moved out of the way. Follow the streets and the La Lauch river to the Marche Couvert (the covered market), for even more idyllic river shots.\n\nColmar has an embarrassment of rich architecture and none more so than along the Lauch.\n\nWe couldn’t resist the urge to see Colmar from the water, and the boat ride through the town was a relaxing way to soak up its sights. The gondolier shares a little history en-route, but it’s mostly just for pleasure. The buildings reflecting on the water in the evening were a marvel to witness.\n\nBack streets of Colmar\n\nAs with any city I advise to leave the centre, and therefore discover the true heart of any location. Colmars side streets are peaceful and above all are an ideal way to see local life. It’s here too you will get to see the many varied houses which make up the city. In other words, the real reason why you came to Colmar.\n\nColmar’s Houses\n\nThe Alsatian architecture is distinctive, it’s timber framed houses with clay roof tiles and wooden window shutters, contrasts against its colourful flower pots. The mix is brought into harmony by the colours that the timber frames are painted. The style is predominantly Germanic. This is a collection of my favourites.\n\nOther notable beauty in Colmar\n\nColmar is more than just a collection of pretty streets and finely built houses. Beneath the surface a cultural heartbeat is prevalent. But that’s a side of Colmar I describe in my blog, the Top Cultural Things to do in Colmar. I’ll finish this one on photos of Colmar therefore, with an introduction to some of the sculptures, churches and fine buildings that show the other side of Colmar.\n\nAnd so the sun sets on this article showcasing Colmar in photos. Above all, I hope by now you’ve seen enough of Colmar to include it in your next visit to France.\n\nBefore you rush off to book those flights, I would appreciate it if you could show this blog a little love, and pin or share."
