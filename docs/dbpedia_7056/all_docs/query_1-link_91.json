        "text": "Located in the heart of the Vosges at the height of Colmar, the Lac Blanc massif (1363 m) has a remarkable alpine character. The \"Tanet - Gazon du Faing\" reserve is caracterised by old forests and subalpine meadows (or thatchs) that give way rather abruptly to steep slopes facing east which testify to the past glacial erosion.\n\nThis site is a good site to see a variety of mountain birds. In an area close to the parking spot, you can easily encounter a few of them, mostly if you walk on the ridge south-west of the praking spot. Species are Citril Finch, Common Raven, Nutcracker, Common Crossbill and Ring Ouzel.\n\nThe diversity of environments is also found in that of the species observed. On the stubble nest Eurasian Skylark, Meadow Pipit, Water Pipit and Northern Wheatear. The screes that dot the southern slopes of the cirques and the rock walls are home to Peregrine Falcon and Eagle Owl. The forested areas at the foot of the cirques welcome the classic birds of high-altitude forests: Ring Ouzel, Coal Tit, Crested Tit, Willow Tit, Wood Warbler, Common Crossbill, as well as many species during periods of migration. The high-altitudes forest hosts the rare Eurasian Pygmy Owl.\n\nBecause of the great diversity of species present, each season is interesting. The route proposed here (12,6 km) is a day hike going through all these environments in which you will have great scenery views over the Vosges and the Alsace plain."
