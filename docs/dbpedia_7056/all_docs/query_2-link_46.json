        "text": "I believe those villages have at least a bit of bus service. You can check that out on Rome2Rio.com, but don't trust any of the details (fares, travel times, or frequencies). Drill down till you find the name of the company operating the bus in question and go to its website for accurate information.\n\nThe difficulty you are likely to have is that is it usually very difficult to find transportation from one small village to another--unless you're lucky and two places you want to go happen to be on the same bus line. Buses fan out from a hub--Colmar in this case, and you generally have to return to the hub to catch a bus headed for the next place you want to go. And when you're dealing with small villages, bus service is likely to be very infrequent. The buses my be intended for children to school and/or workers to jobs in the Colmar. That sort of scheduling is a challenge if you're going to places so tiny that you can walk every block of every street in 90 minutes or so. (I totally made up that walking time.)\n\nOne option would be to attempt to combine bus travel in one direction with taxi service. The taxi would probably have to come from Colmar (or maybe Selestat--I haven't checked the map), and you'd be paying for the round-trip mileage. But perhaps distances are short enough it would be affordable. Maybe you don't need to go to all four of the small towns?\n\nFor what it's worth, there's rail service between Colmar and Selestat.\n\nAnother possibility would be to pick up and/or drop off the car in Strasbourg. The airport would probably be best. Agencies there most likely have longer hours, and the airport is a bit SW of the city, sort of on the way to Colmar. There wouldn't necessarily be a significant drop charge if you picked up in Colmar and dropped off at the airport, or vice versa. There should be decent public transportation between the airport and the Strasbourg train station, but it's worth checking on its frequency on weekdays vs. Saturday vs. Sunday.\n\nFor getting the best out of your stay you need a car. There are numerous little lovely villages to explore and with public transport it will take too much time to move around unless you limit yourself to a few places. The villages you mention are nice but very touristy, many others are off the beaten track and worth seeing too like Barr has a very attractive market square where you will meet just a few tourists. Bergheim is lesser touristy and lovely as well, Obernai more north is nice too, but touristy.\n\nFrom Haut-Koenigsbourg you have a fantastic view over the Rhine valley, the same from the abbey of Mont Sainte-Odile. Strassbourg is best to reach by train and if oldtimers are of interest CitÃ© de l'Automobile in Mulhouse houses the largest and likely finest Bugatti collection. The railroad museum seems interesting too, but I didn't visited it when I stayed in Alsace.a few years back.\n\nThanks everyone. Iâ€™m in agreement that a car would be beneficial, which is why I found a place to stay that would allow for that, though I have not booked it yet. I have no problem driving in Europe and have done it many times. The biggest dilemma is the days the car rental office is open in Colmar. I think Iâ€™ll call Auto Europe today and see what they say.\n\nWe will be in the area in late March - early April. Iâ€™m less concerned about tourists at that time of year and more concerned about inclement weather conditions. We will be arriving from Germany, probably Cologne, where we are visiting family for a week. I actually have considered cutting one day from the visit with them, taking the train to Strasbourg and spending a night there. Later the next day we could pick up a car and drive to Colmar. That would in effect give us an additional day for villages because we wouldnâ€™t be spending one of our Colmar days going to Strasbourg. I was planning a day there anyway. The problem of course is the car drop off. I considered returning the car in Strasbourg, but we go to Lyon next. Obviously the opposite direction. Do we return the car in Strasbourg on Saturday and take the train back to Colmar? Do we want to drive to Lyon? Like I said, I donâ€™t mind the driving. Iâ€™m more worried about the weather. I know snow is a possibility that time of year. Iâ€™ve driven in the snow, but being a California girl I am by no means an expert.\n\nThanks for all the information, including places to visit in the area. Any more information of that sort is very appreciated.\n\nOur experience is that a car provides better opportunities, and a chance to see multiple towns in one day. We chose a smaller hotel in Ribeauville, with private parking, because many towns don't have enough parking. We also went to one or two destination restaurants for dinner, which was easier with a car. We don't always rent a car in Europe, but it was helpful in Alsace.\n\nI should say that we rented the car after a stay in Strasbourg, and returned it in Avignon. We actually could have made even better use of the car, not having time to get to the chapel in Ronchamp or a side trip toward Germany. We rented the car on our last day in Strasbourg, because we wanted to eat at L'Auberge de L'Ill. (I L L, named after a river.)\n\nHi Andrea, you have had good advice above.\n\nYou'll know that if you rent a car in Germany at that time of the year you will have snow tyres on the car. That's not required in France, and you probably won't.\n\nI agree that, especially off-season, you will be well served with a car in that part of Alsace. The villages are close, small and cute as a button. Easy parking just outside each village. I really really think you will be miles happier.\n\nBut I don't think I'd want that long drive to Lyon.\n\nI haven't looked at the SNCF route from Colmar to Lyon, but if money were no concern and were looking for a change up in the train sweepstakes you could go through Switzerland ... Colmar - Basel - Geneva - Lyon.\n\nThere has to be a solution for the Sunday return. I'm not surprised that are closed though....\n\nUpdate: I spoke to someone at Auto Europe. Europcar appears to be the only choice in Colmar. Their hours are so ridiculously limited that there is no way we can rent from there. They donâ€™t have an after hours drop off. The option is to pick up and return from Strasbourg. Itâ€™s not ideal, but it isnâ€™t impossible either. We could arrive from Germany in Strasbourg on the Tuesday, spend the night there and leave late the next afternoon by car for Colmar. Or maybe Turckheim? The train goes between there and Colmar. We would have to return the car in Strasbourg on the Saturday, then take the train back to where we are staying. Iâ€™d like to stay in the smaller village, but the train on Sunday only runs every couple of hours and there would be a long stopover in Colmar. Decisions, decisions.\n\nI don't like changing accommodations frequently, so I'd head straight to Colmar and visit Strasbourg one day from there. I always rent a car, and take the odd bit of public transportation, but with your limited time I'd give some thought to what Sam recommends. Chateau Haut-Koenigsbourg is a fabulous visit, other places can be visited by train and bus. Also, check out the timetables here and see if they work for you (I don't know how accurate the timetables are for the periods you are considering): https://www.l-k.fr/fiches-horaires-et-tarifs/\n\nKaysersberg is on Line 145\n\nEguisheim is on line 440. You can even walk there, if you want.\n\nRiquewihr, RibeauvillÃ© and Bergheim are all on the same line, 109, and are all worth a visit. There's a full day or more between them. If you are up for any hiking, there are nice walks through the vineyards between some of the villages.\n\nGunderson, our plan has been to do a day trip to Strasbourg to Colmar. That will continue to be our plan unless we do get a car.\n\nThanks to all for their advice. A car rental will be determined later. We have to decide if the hassle of picking up and returning the car in Strasbourg is worth the freedom to have the car while in Colmar. If we do get the car we will arrive in Strasbourg the day before and see Strasbourg before the car rental period begins. I donâ€™t want to have to worry about the logistics of arriving by train from Germany at the exact right time to pick up a car, not to mention the car would be just sitting there for a day while we would see Strasbourg. To cover all bases I am canceling our Airbnb without parking in Colmar and changing to a place that has free parking and two bikes to use. If we donâ€™t get a car we will do our best with public transportation. I was looking at a small group tour from Colmar to see some villages one day, but itâ€™s more expensive for 2 than the car rental would be for 3 days."
