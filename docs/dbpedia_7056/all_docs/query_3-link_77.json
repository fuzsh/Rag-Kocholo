        "text": "When we get to spend time at my parents’ vacation house in the Vosges, a mountain range in the Northeast of France, one of our favorite daytrips is to drive over to Colmar, a historic Alsatian town on the other side of the mountain.\n\nWe’ve been going for as long as my parents have had the house, a little over twenty years, and though Colmar is as gorgeous as Alsatian towns get (i.e. very), with paved streets, pretty canals, and amazing architecture, the capital-D Draw for me is the flammekueche we get for lunch.\n\nAlso known as tarte flambée, the flammekueche (pronounced flam-küsh*) can be described as the Alsatian pizza: a super thin round of dough topped with cream, finely sliced onions, bacon strips, and sometimes mushrooms (la forestière) and cheese (la gratinée), baked in a woodfire oven until the edges are golden brown and crisp.\n\nSitting at one of the outdoor tables outside our favorite restaurant in Colmar, we make conversation as we wait for our tartes flambées to arrive, and our collective joy vibrates through the air as the waitstaff brings them out, all hot and fragrant, on wooden boards.\n\nI would never have thought to make my own had it not been for Frédérique, the textile designer and special correspondent who will be sharing her guide to Strasbourg next month, and offered her recipe for flammekueche as a bonus. As she explained, it is a popular dish to make for a casual meal with friends throughout Alsace. In fact, it is so common that supermarkets sell ready-made rounds of dough that you can just garnish and bake.\n\nI’ve never come across those in Paris, and soon found out the dough is so easy to make there is hardly a need for a shortcut: it’s just flour, salt, oil, and water — no yeast to intimidate the cook.\n\nAnd once you’ve got your dough rolled out thinly, it’s just a matter of scattering a few toppings over it, and bake in a very hot oven. Within minutes, you can have your very own tarte flambée sizzling on your table.\n\nIndeed, I can’t think of a more festive food to share with friends over drinks. But it comes together so fast Maxence and I have also enjoyed it for a weeknight dinner. In fact, I did a test run one night, and we loved it so much we had tartes flambées for dinner four. nights. in a row. We called it Alsatian week.\n\n* Alternate spellings are numerous depending on the region and the dialect: flammkuche, flammkuchen, flammekuechle, flàmmeküeche…"
