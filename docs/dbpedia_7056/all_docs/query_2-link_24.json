        "text": "July 29th ~ Colmar, France\n\nDeparting from Basel, and leaving Switzerland behind, our ship next docked in Breisach, Germany but our tour was to Colmar, France. I think that amounted to three countries in less than 24 hours.\n\nColmar is in the Alsace region and has bounced back and forth between being under the French flag or German. Its origins date back to around 823, and it was the last city in France to be freed during World War II.\n\nCertainly one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, it is a must see for pure charm, striking architecture, great wine and food, and of course ‚ÄúLittle Venice‚Äù.\n\nThe half timber homes are most common in the old town section and are painted a variety of sorbet shades. Fun carvings may stand guard on the corners. Squares host amusing statues, some of which were done by Auguste Bartholdi, the French sculptor who designed the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe Bartholdi Museum, located in the home he was born in, tells more of his life story and presents many examples of his work.\n\nStreet musicians could be found playing a variety of instruments.\n\nThe store signs are pieces of art themselves. Giving a description or telling a story about the trade or product available in the shop, they would catch the eye as you walked past.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe local food and wine are worthy of inspection or tasting.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAnd of course the post would not be complete without at least one church üôÇ\n\nSt. Martin‚Äôs Church is Roman Catholic and made out of pink stone. Archeological findings show a foundation dating back to around the year 1000, but the current building was constructed between 1234 and 1365 as the church of a college devoted to the cult of Martin of Tours.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nHow about these ear muffs and forehead doilies!!!\n\nAnd our day was ended with this glorious sunset. We are off to a VERY good start!\n\nGRATITUDE MOMENT: Today I am grateful for seeing a horse with blue ear coverings, very purple leaves on a common plant, and a brilliant sunset over the river. Life is good‚Ä¶\n\nIf you like our blog, have something to share or a suggestion, or just want to say hello, please leave us a message in the ‚ÄúLeave a reply‚Äù section at the bottom of this page.
