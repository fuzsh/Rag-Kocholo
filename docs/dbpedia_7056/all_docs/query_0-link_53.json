        "text": "Actually, I thought Colmar was pretty sweet! I do public transportation only in Europe so Colmar was easy for me to get to from Paris. I did not go to any of the smaller wine towns around. When I visited I stayed for 3 nights and intended to spend 1 full day in Colmar and go to Strasbourg for the other full day. After the full day in Colmar there were still things to see so I just stayed there.\n\nColmar Tourist Information:\n\nhttps://www.tourisme-colmar.com/en/\n\nIf you'll zoom in on this brochure map there is a purple line for the TI DIY walking tour. If you have a phone with data each location on the walking tour has a QR code sign where you can get more information.\n\nhttps://reservation.tourisme-colmar.com/medias/documents/documentation/documentation-PLANCOLMAR-UK.pdf\n\nI stayed at the Hotel Saint-Martin which was very nice and right in the pedestrian area.\n\nIs Colmar bigger than you were looking for?\n\nHere was our impression from staying there in 2019. The area is charming! If I was going back, I would also want to see the castle in the area. I would book a full-day tour.\n\nI have a rolling pin from one of the nearby villages that’s carved to roll out Christmas-decor square cookies as you roll across cookie dough. I enjoy using it each year, thinking about the trip!\n\n“ COLMAR: When my husband & I arrived at Colmar we found a quaint town completely filled with tourists. Many of the shops had street displays of trinkets instead of locally made items. Both of us were disappointed because it felt like a fake version of a town, especially since we just came from Nancy which was so authentic and friendly. It wasn’t until later evening after the tourist crowd left and early morning before they arrived that the Colmar we had wanted to see became apparent.\n\nWe tried local specialties; I chose Quiche Lorraine since we were in the Lorraine region, and my husband had a traditional meat pie - both excellent. We ate fairly early ~7:00pm both nights and noticed that the outdoor tables were all filled by 7:20pm.\n\nOn Sunday, 2300 participants ran in the half and full marathon that went by our hotel, Saint-Martin. We loved that they began the race with three small teams - each grouped around a severely handicapped person in a modified bike. As they ran by our hotel, they were smiling while we cheered them on enthusiastically.\n\nWe reserved a village tour with Ophorus Excursions & Tours for the afternoon. Our half-day minivan tour to several small villages outside Colmar was very special. Our friendly guide briefly drove us to sites beyond the tour plan to thoroughly explain the significance of this area during WWII since it’s near the German border. His information, showing us bullet holes in stone building walls, and pointing out the American flag flown high up the hill at a memorial were very meaningful. He also provided lots of details about the wines & origins for this area. The villages were all so cute (he even drove us down to Eguisheim which was my favorite!), and with his time with us, it made an afternoon to be grateful, too.”\n\nI would not call Colmar a village. I think of it as a small town, which may be why it wasn’t on the list. I loved it. I suppose it is somewhat touristy, but I found it beautiful and a wonderful place to walk.\n\nWe visited some of the wine villages (by bus) and they were very pretty, but there was less to do and less places to eat, so I was glad we stayed in Colmar. I especially loved Ribeauville because there was a great hike to three ruined castles (up hill, so you have to be okay with hills).\n\nThe public transportation tends to fan out from Colmar, so I think that's likely to be the easiest base for you. It will depend on which small villages you want to visit, however. If you happen to choose two that are on the same bus or train line, either would be OK. You need to decide your target villages and then check SNCF Connect and/or Google for bus schedules.\n\nThis blog discusses some attractive places in Alsace that have rail service. I don't know that the info is totally up to date, so you'd need to go to the SNCF Connect website to verify service still exits and find current schedules. Some of the most popular places are notable by their omission. Ribeauville has a train station, but it's 2 miles from the village.\n\nhttps://www.getalsaced.com/villages-alsace-accessible-train.html\n\nI'll add to the list of folks who really liked Colmar. It is gorgeous and as a result gets heavy tourist traffic. As is often the case, that traffic is concentrated in a fairly small area, so you can find quieter areas. And the Unterlinden Museum is very good; the Isenheim Altarpiece is magnificent.\n\nWe stayed in Colmar for 4 nights in June. We fell in love with it. It’s definitely not a village. It has a charming old town area, but beyond that it is a decent size town of over 70,000 people.\n\nWe visited several surrounding villages: Eguisheim, Kaysersberg, Requiwihr and Turckheim. We had a car, which is really helpful for the villages. Only Turckheim has a train station. But these villages are no more than 20 minutes drive from Colmar. You could take a bus, or even bike to them.\n\nSome of the villages are very, very small, like Eguisheim. It is super cute, but would be too small for my liking as a base. Kaysersberg is a bit larger, with a river running through it and a castle ruins up above. My husband and I both thought it would be a good base for a few days if we wanted to stay in one of the villages. Lots of shops and restaurants to explore. By the time we got to Requiwihr, we were on cuteness overload.\n\nThey are all very similar. Eguisheim is very compact and the tiny streets are in circles around a tiny main square. I almost felt a little claustrophobic there. We were there early in the day and there were no crowds. It would be uncomfortable later in the day. Kaysersberg is flat and more spread out. Requiwihr is on a slight slope, so walking through the town involves an uphill climb, in case that is important."
