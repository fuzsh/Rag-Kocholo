        "text": "Since we took loads of photos in Colmar, I have been finding it tough to select which photos to share. I would have dearly lurveeed to share most of the photos that we took â€¦ but then I know that this is not possible. And for some reason, I could not think of how best to share as many photos as I could â€¦ which is why I have been procrastinating for days as to which photos to choose and upload â€¦ and it is taking ages to finish this entry even though I started working on it two weeks ago! Tsk, tsk, tsk â€¦ sometimes the brain just refuses to work lah!\n\nBut as I had been looking forward to share about our trip to Davos during the Christmas weekend â€¦ and surely I cannot share about the Davos trip when I have not shared anything on Colmar â€¦ so, I decided to push my brain to work a little harder to find a solution to this impasse â€¦ and thankfully, it finally did a few day ago â€¦ pheww!! So here is the first instalment of photos from our weekend trip to Colmar which we did the week before Christmas.\n\nBut first, I suppose I have to thank the mum for mentioning the idea of going to Colmar to see its MarchÃ© de NoÃ«l (Christmas market) â€¦ to the hubby. Otherwise, I do not think that we would have gone there â€¦ at least not around this time of the year, â€¦ and therefore not in time to catch its beautiful Christmas market â€¦ and be able to take lots of photos!\n\nOf course I had heard of Colmar â€¦ including the mini-duplicate version that exists closer to home, i.e. in Malaysia, as well as I had seen pictures of the beautiful and highly picturesque buildings to be found in the old town. This is why I was very interested in visiting Colmar one day. But I had not expected to do so this winter when its Christmas market was in full swing. So even though the mum later decided not to go with us â€¦ thanks to her, I got to go and see the place for myself!\n\nErrr â€¦ of course, must thank my kind Ta, too â€¦ for agreeing to go ahead with the trip even though the GOH (i.e. the mum) had decided not to. After all â€¦ it was planned as a birthday present for her â€¦ not mine! hehehe â€¦ ðŸ™‚\n\nAlthough it would have been nice to stay there a little longer so as to be able to see all its attractions â€¦ but, for now, it is enough that I got to see its old town with its beautiful half-timbered buildings â€¦ and that I was able to soak up the festive atmosphere of its MarchÃ© de NoÃ«l. It is a wonderful experience, I can tell you â€¦ and I lurveeeee it!\n\nOkay â€¦ in this entry you can ogle at the beautiful and colourful buildings in the old town of Colmar!\n\nThe beautiful building that houses the Colmar Railway Station and dates back to 1905-07 (and was modelled after a railway station â€¦ in Poland) â€¦ a contrast to the modern bus stop outside the station.\n\nFrom the railway station â€¦ there are clear signs to show the direction to get to the MarchÃ© de NoÃ«l . So we just had to follow the signs to our destination! Easy peasy â€¦ and so tourist friendly!! ðŸ™‚\n\nIt takes about 10-15 minutes or so to reach the old town where the MarchÃ© de NoÃ«l is held from the train station on foot â€¦ depending on how fast you walk, of course! We naturally took longer â€¦ because we (or rather especially me!) always like to dawdle a bit along the way â€¦ to look-see (as we would say it in our Singapore slang) and take some photos lah.\n\nJust before we reached the old town, there was a Christmas tree market next to the park (called â€˜Champ de Marsâ€™)â€¦ where one can buy â€¦ Christmas trees lah, what else! ðŸ™‚ So, naturally I stopped to look-see and snap some photos. For those who have never seen it before (like me!) â€¦ the machine on the right is used to wrap the Christmas tree so that it is easier to carry and bring back home!\n\nNext, we saw this beautiful old carousel (Franceâ€™s largest covered merry-go-round)â€¦ which dates to 1900 â€¦ and which unfortunately was not open that day. I went near to peer inside and even saw some kind of stairs inside it â€¦ very lovely! I just hope that this merry-go-round will be put back into working condition soon (a sign said that it was closed for renovation work).\n\nAnd then after the carousel â€¦ but just before we hit the corner to the old town â€¦ there was an ice-skating rink. There were a few comic and familiar characters there â€¦ to encourage the young ones to try skating, I suppose!\n\nAnd then â€¦ we saw it â€¦ the beginning of the old town of Colmar! Wohooo â€¦ ðŸ™‚\n\nI was really excited to finally arrive at the famous old town of Colmar â€¦ and its equally famous MarchÃ© de NoÃ«l!\n\nWe decided to go inside a small alley off rue des Marchands, called Le Hameau, and saw these houses with a little garden in their front yards â€¦ very pretty.\n\nAt another alley, a medieval house (right pic) caught my attention. This alley was called Cour des Trois Cultures â€¦ because, within that alley, three different styles of buildings â€“ medieval, modern and contemporary houses can be found.\n\nThe collegiate church of Saint-Martin, also (wrongly) known as the cathedral of Colmar, whose construction was started in the 13th century. Apparently, the initial plan was to have two towers built but the idea was abandoned after a plague outbreak in 1313 (as there were no longer enough workers around). The top of the tower was burnt and subsequently rebuilt after the fire of 1572 that damaged the top section of the church.\n\nFormer garrison barracks (Corps de Garde), erected in 1575 on the site of a previous church building facing Saint-Martin on place de la CathÃ©drale. Note the beautiful loggia from which official rulings decreed by the cityâ€™s council would be proclaimed.\n\nPlace de la CathÃ©drale with the start of rue MerciÃ¨re in the background and, before that on the right, maison Adolphe (the white house), which is Colmarâ€™s oldest house still standing: it was built in 1350 (note the beautiful central window on the second floor).\n\nLeaving place de la CathÃ©drale for rue MerciÃ¨re, which leads to rue des Marchands.\n\nMaison Ã  la Viole, on the corner of rue des Marchands and rue Schongauer (the family into which Martin Schongauer was born in 1450, a painter who came to be nicknamed â€˜Pictorum Gloriaâ€™ â€“ the Glory of Painters), was built in the latter part of the 14th century.\n\nThe beautiful Maison Pfister on the corner of rue des Marchands and rue MerciÃ¨re. Note the paintings of a religious nature on the first floor, done in 1577.\n\nMaison Pfister (left) and maison â€˜zum Kragenâ€™ (right) with 17th century sculpture believed to be that of a local sculptor, Adam Keller.\n\nThe busy rue des Marchands (with tower of maison Pfister on the left and a hot wine stand) a week before Christmas.\n\nCorner of rue des Augustins/rue des Marchands with place du MarchÃ© aux Fleurs (flower market) on the right\n\nA Chinese and Indian restaurants along Grand Rue. Thankfully, the ethnic decoration for both restaurants is muted so that it did not spoil the natural look of these old buildings and made it consistent with the rest of the buildings in the old town.\n\nView from the bridge of rue Turenne looking in the direction of rue de la Poissonnerie with the river Lauch.\n\nWindows of the restaurant Winstub La Krutenau adorned with Christmas decorations.\n\nThe highly picturesque area of Colmar along the river Lauch, called maybe a little pretentiously La Petite Venise (small Venice) given that this area has only one canal with houses along it, unlike Venice.\n\nLeft side of La Petite Venise, i.e. the one running along rue de la Herse.\n\nRight side of La Petite Venise, i.e. the one running along place des 6 Montagnes Noires.\n\nBridge rue Turenne (left) with a highly picturesque ensemble of houses and start of rue de la Poissonnerie (right).\n\nSome of the many half-timbered buildings in rue Turenne (left) and rue de la Herse (right).\n\nMaking our way from rue de la Herse towards La Petite Venise.\n\nView from the bridge on boulevard Saint-Pierre on the river Lauch looking towards rue Turenne.\n\nRiver Lauch near the bridge of boulevard Saint-Pierre with another fixture of Venice: the local versions of the gondola and gondolier.\n\nSome houses in boulevard Saint-Pierre, rue de la Poissonnerie, rue Turenne â€“ including with trompe lâ€™oeil decorations. Note the reproductions of drawings of the famous local artist Hansi (top right) with little girls wearing the typical costume of Alsace.\n\nQuai de la Poissonnerie, another famous and highly picturesque street in Colmar, along the river Lauch.\n\nAnother famous shot of Colmar: quai de la Poissonnerie from the bridge rue des Ecoles over the river Lauch.\n\nMarchÃ© Couvert de Colmar (the market hall, a building erected in 1865 which until recently had served as â€¦ a car park â€¦ but fortunately has been put back to its first use), River Lauch and quai de la Poissonnerie.\n\nAlmost the same vantage point as for the picture above but looking back.\n\nA little further on â€¦ a shot of the bridge (visible 2 pictures above, it is the orange bridge) over river Lauch at the end of rue des Tanneurs.\n\nMiscellaneous half-timbered buildings near the medieval area where the tanners used to work and live.\n\nRue des Tanneurs â€“ in the Middle Ages, this guild was an important one. However, for sanitary reasons several edicts were subsequently issued prohibiting its members from carrying their trade anywhere else than in this street (1669 and 1716).\n\nA building at place de lâ€™Ancienne Douane (Old Customs) with a trompe lâ€™oeil decoration above the gate.\n\nSo â€¦ what do you think of the buildings in the old town of Colmar? Lovely are they not? Well â€¦ they looked even lovelier with the Christmas decorations on them! Photos of the Christmas decorations and Christmas markets coming up next!!\n\nOther entries on Colmar on this blog"
