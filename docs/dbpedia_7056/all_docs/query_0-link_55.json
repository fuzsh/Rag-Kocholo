Not a battlefield this time, but following some footsteps of his most famous inhabitant, the French patriot, illustrator, caricaturist, and war propagandist, Hansi.\n\nWith the life and works of the artist, Hansi, a French Second Lieutenant during the Great War, in our mind, we make a walk through the historic city centre of Colmar.\n\nConcise history of Colmar\n\nTo help you understand the architecture of Colmar, some of the Alsatian culture, and the work of our leading character, Hansi, I would like to sketch you a concise history of Colmar with the emphasis on the period of 1870-1918.\n\nIn history Alsace Lorraine, a vital and an important industrial area, has always been a bone of contention for the French and the neighbouring German states. In 1679, while the Thirty Years War was still going on, Colmar was ceded to France in the Treaties of Nijmegen. As a result of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 the newly formed German Empire annexed Alsace Lorraine and of course Colmar. Alsace returned to France after World War I.\n\nSo, from 1870 until 1918 Hansi's Alsace Lorraine and Colmar belonged to the German \"Reich\" as \"Reichsland Elzass Lotharingen\". The Germans often called Colmar: \"Kolmar\".\n\nThough traditionally being used to change authorities, this German \"occupation\" had quite an impact on the Alsatians.\n\nThe Alsatians became German citizens. They had to obey German laws, had to pay their German taxes, and had to enlist under the conscription law in the German Army. The German government encouraged the migration of more Germans into Alsace Lorraine. German became the official language. The German \"Kultur\" was superior to the French.\n\nThese conditions, a proces of \" Germanisation\", were feeding the nationalism and patriottism of French Alsatians like the young Jean-Jacques \"Hansi\" Waltz.\n\nColmar August 1914\n\nEarly in the Great War, on 22 August 1914, the French troops succeeded to threaten Colmar at Ingersheim, which is nowadays a western suburbs of the modern city of Colmar.\n\nOne of the many units, that were involved in these fights for Colmar, was the 152nd Infantry Regiment, also known as the “Les Diables Rouges\", the Red Devils. Our leading character, Hansi, then still a corporal, was serving in this unit.\n\nMembers of the Bayerische Landwehr Infanterie Regiment 1 managed to stop the French advance at Ingersheim. The main force of the Germans withdrew on Colmar.\n\nThough a weak unit of French Cavalrists knew to reach the centre of Colmar on 23 August 1914.\n\nFrom the 28th the Germans drove the French troops back westward to a frontline, running roughly from Wintzenheim to Katzenthal. For the rest of the war Colmar would remain in German possession. In a matter of weeks the Germans forced the French to withdraw more westward, on the ridges of the Vosges.\n\nAlsace Lorraine and Colmar returned to France after the Great War, were annexed again by Nazi Germany in 1940, and then reverted to the French authorities in 1945 after the battle of the \"Colmar Pocket\" .\n\nWe start our walk southwest of the Saint Martin at the Place de l'Ancienne Douane. My late wife Christ ( + 08-05-2018 ) stands in front of the Schwendi fountain, made by Bartholdi.\n\nAfter all these centuries of hostilities and changing nationalities, in the unified Europe of nowadays both the German and French cultures have blended nicely together into a pleasant mix and life style.\n\nYou will recognise this rich Franco German culture mix in the baroque buildings, like \"Le Koifhus\", l'Ancienne Douane\n\n\"Koifhus\" means \"Kauf Haus\", l'Ancienne Douane, the old custom house used to be the centre of trade administration.\n\nView from Place de l'Ancienne Douane to the Quartier des Tanneurs.\n\nView from Place de l'Ancienne Douane to the Grande Rue.\n\nFrench style and German style fronts are mixed and alternating each other.\n\nIn the Rue des Marchands we find our first reminder of Hansi.\n\nThe owner of the \"Chez Hansi\" Restaurant adopted Hansi's reputation.\n\nThe menu offers also some typical Alsatian dishes...\n\nHansi designed a postcard with at the back the recipe for this dish.\n\nRue des Marchands and in the background the tower of the Cathedral of Saint Martin.\n\nMaison Pfister is one of the most beautiful townhouses in Alsace and a landmark in Colmar.\n\nMaison Pfister is named after a previous owner of the 19th century. The house was built in 1537 for the hatter, Ludwig Scherer. The architecture is still medieval, but the decoration of the facade is in Renaissance style. The paintings depict Habsburg Emperors of the 16th century, evangelists, and bible scenes.\n\nIn one of his books, \"The History of Alsace, told to little children by Uncle Hansi\", Hansi also aquarelled the Maison Pfister, relating to the events of 1870 in Colmar during the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nPerhaps a portrait of the hatter, Ludwig Scherer?\n\nAt the Place de la Cathédrale we find the Cathedral of St. Martin.\n\nAs in all small villages in Alsace, the storks have also here in Colmar their own nest on the roof of the church. \"Martin\" and \"Martine\" are guarding their little ones and the city.\n\nAt the end of the Rue des Marchands we go right to the Boulevard des Champs de Mars.\n\nOpposite the Hansi memorial, at the other side of the street at number 9, the house where Hansi lived from 1921 until his death in 1951.\n\nJean-Jacques \"Oncle Hansi\" Waltz (1873-1951)\n\nHansi (\"Little John\") was born as Jean-Jacques Waltz on 23 February 1873 in Colmar, a town in Alsace, which at that time belonged to the German \"\"Reichsland Elzass Lotharingen\". After the Franco Prussian War of 1870-1871 the Germans stipulated, that the raw materials and industrial richness of Alsace Lorraine again belonged to the brand new \"Kaiser Reich\". After their loss of the war the French experienced above all the loss of their Alsace Lorraine as a deep humiliation, which would continue until 1918.\n\nHansi was already during his schooldays showing his deep aversion to the prevailing Pan Germanism in drawings and cartoons. During that period Pan Germanism was in full bloom under the direction of the Kaiser. During these days as a youngster he already irritated the authorities.\n\nHansi often liked to wander around in the beautiful landscape of Alsace making sketches and drawings of the picturesque villages.\n\nProfessor Knatschke\n\nIn 1908 Hansi published his satiric novel, \"Professor Knatschke\", criticising the Germans with his texts and caricatural illustrations. This is the cover of a version in the German language.\n\nThis book, indeed, was a revelation. His favorite character, the German Gendarme.\n\nNever had the Germans been so wittily ridiculed.\n\nProfessor Knatschke, visits, as a German Tourist, the Louvre Museum in Paris. Hansi introduces also one of his most favourite themes: German Tourists.\n\nHansi's written observations are satirical and rather vicious, though Hansi avoids excess in his black and white caricatures.\n\nL'Histoire d'Alsace racontée aux petits enfants par l'Oncle Hansi\n\nIn 1912 Waltz published \"L'Histoire d'Alsace racontée aux petits enfants par l'Oncle Hansi\", \"The History of Alsace, told to little children by Uncle Hansi\".\n\nHansi tells the history of Alsace. His text possesses a firm French, patriotic, and anti-German view point. Though being a book meant for children, the political message of the illustrations is clear.\n\nQuote accompanying this picture:\n\n\"But the people of Baden then had another speciality, and as soon as the hordes arrived near a farm in Alsace, they looted the lower court. They took everything, but they especially preferred eggs. They made enormous omelettes, which they described as colossal, and so great for to go faster, they broke the eggs with their feet. Since that time they are called in Alsace: \"Men with egg yolk feet\" (in Celtic Galfiesla).\"\n\nHansi shows German soldiers of every period in the Alsatian history, always equipped by the spoils of war, and always a clock under their arm.\n\nThis book, but also his later books and postcards, is full of small, corrosive, caricatured jokes about Germans, a political reference of Waltz's aversion to the Germans and their Pan Germanism.\n\n\"The Huns for Strasbourg\", Hansi's co-author and illustrator Huens' interpretation of the events in 1870.\n\nHansi criticises the growing immigration of German inhabitants in Alsace.\n\nHansi shows his irritation about the presence of the German military.\n\nAbout the period after 1871 : the arrival of German immigrants in Alsace.\n\nThe arrival of German tourists in Alsace.\n\nFor postcards he also drawed caricatures of German Tourists in Paris.\n\nMon Village\n\nHis drawings with a critical wink to his society, and especially his book of 1913, \"Mon Village - Ceux qui n'oublient pas\", \"My Village - For those who not forget\", were bringing Waltz into serious trouble with the German authorities. This book for children is illustrated with romantic drawings of playing children in the villages of Alsace. But in his details Hansi is always mocking the German village gendarme.\n\nHansi's villages are almost always overlooked by the national symbol of Alsace, the proud stork, \"Le Cigogne\", on it's nest on the roof of the church.\n\nA \"Prussian\" teacher educates the French children of Hansi's village in German.\n\nTroubles with the German authorities\n\nThe German government dragged Waltz, as one of the members of the nationalist group of \"Les Revanchards\", into Court. First for the Tribunal in Colmar, and later to the Court in Leipzig! Because of his mockery of German officials, including police officers and teachers, the court condemned Waltz in July 1914 to one year imprisonment.\n\nHansi's \"Mon Village\" and his other books, drawings, and paintings were \"deutschfeindlichen Karikaturen\" and showed an \"anti-deutschen Haltung\".\n\nThis caused a national outrage in France, making headlines in newspapers, ...\n\n...and inspiring Clemenceau himself to write two editorials in his magazine, \"L'Homme Libre\".\n\nAlso in \"Mon Village\" Hansi plays with his favourite theme, the German Tourists.\n\nThis time Hansi shows also the arrival of well clothed French tourists, ...\n\n... their visit to Hansi's village, ...\n\n... and a German officer arguing with the driver of the car.\n\nFor fellow front travellers a recognisable image: The Alsatian children of Hansi's village visit a French memorial and the battlefields of 1870. Gretel holds a garland under her arm.\n\nHansi's Escape\n\nHansi fled to France, where he immediately enlisted in the famous \"Quinze Deux\", 15-2, the 152nd Infantry Regiment, as a corporal, soon to be promoted to Second Lieutenant and interpreter of the General Staff of the 41st Infantry Division.\n\nOn 1 September 1914 the German government in Kolmar announced on placards, that\n\n\"The painter, Jean-Jacques Waltz, called Hansi\", and two other notables from Colmar, \"who are to be found amongst the French troops, are declared traitors. Anyone who knows of their residence, or is hiding them in his residence, will be shot after war custom. Der Ortskommandant Kolmar, Oberleutnant von Wellebin\".\n\nPortrait of Jean-Jacques Waltz in 1917\n\nDuring the Great War Hansi went on illustrating, especially propaganda postcards. The liberation of an Alsatian village in August 1914 inspired Hansi in August 1918 to make two illustrations for postcards. Hansi commented afterwards: \"A village somewhere between Thann and Wesserling on 4 August 1914, the first day of the war.\"\n\nHansi: \"The same village during the French liberation on 10 August 1914. Everybody is happy, even the stork on the roof of the school is in a good mood.\"\n\nThe allied victory at theBattle of the Marne inspired Hansi also.\n\nHansi inscripted the kid's artillery gun with \"420\", referring to the German canon bombarding Paris.\n\nA variation on the theme of the German Tourist, or the German citizen.\n\nHansi is referring here to the French successful advances in some parts of Alsace, like in the Munster Valley around Metzeral.\n\nHansi's caricatures became more nastier. Another favourite theme of Hansi returned: the looting German soldier with a huge clock on his back.\n\nThe German Crown Prince, who Hansi calls \"the micro-brained megalomaniac\", is wearing four Iron Crosses.\n\nThe soldiers are wearing helmets and \"horizon blue\" instead of their red pantalons.\n\nBut Hansi of course never forgot to educate his little Alsatians and other French children into obeying, but before all, patriotic, French citizens!\n\nAt Chatenois (near Sélestat) a Poilu is even teaching the children \"A French Lesson\", ...\n\n... of course about the \"Cigogne\", the stork.\n\n\"La petite Alsacienne\", Gretel, with Uncle Hansi's doll, ...\n\n... indeed a Poilu in 1914 style uniform.\n\nIn November 1918 Waltz entered triumphantly his hometown Colmar with his Red Devils, his 152nd Infantry Regiment.\n\nAfter the Great War Hansi returned to live again in Colmar.\n\nHansi in the Second world War\n\nBut in 1940 Jean-Jacques Waltz was forced again to escape from the Germans to the \"free\" Vichy zone. But the revengeful German authorities had not forgotten him. In April 1941 the Gestapo succeeded to find Hansi in Agen, where they molested him seriously at night in front of his home. The Gestapo assumed that Waltz was dead, and left him for dead behind. Hansi managed again to flee again, this time to Switzerland. Until his dead Waltz would still suffer from these injuries.\n\nIn 1945, when Colmar became again French, he returned home. 0n 10 June 1951 Oncle Hansi Waltz, died of old age (78) at his home on the Boulevard du Champ de Mars. During his life Hansi has been awarded with the title Commandor of the Légion d'Honneur, with the Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 with palms, and the Croix de Guerre 1939-1945 with palms.\n\nWe continue our walk through Colmar through the Rue des Têtes.\n\nRue des Clefs. Hansi was born at number 41.\n\nGrande Rue.\n\nColmar possesses al lot of pubs and restaurants.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of the Rue St. Jean.\n\nThe last pictures are from the Quartier de la Petite Venise, \"Little Venice\"."
