        "text": "Looking for the most charming things to do in Colmar, France? We’ve got you covered. While choosing a favorite town in France is impossible, Colmar, France was definitely on the short list for our favorite small town in France. Colmar made it on our France road trip itinerary after I heard that the small town in France from Beauty and the Beast was rumored to be modeled after Colmar, France. It was way out of our way, but we felt the effort to visit was more than worth it. Colmar is just the cutest fairy tale small town in France and I 100% felt we had wandered straight into Belle’s hometown from Beauty and the Beast. You will notice a distinct German influence, as Colmar has been traded between France and Germany several times. It’s incredibly rich in history as the entire town escaped all damages during WW2, leaving it to be a perfectly preserved fairy tale small French town. Here’s a complete guide to Colmar, France including how long to stay, things to do in Colmar, where to eat, and where to stay.\n\nThe most charming things to do in Colmar, France\n\nHow Many Days to Spend in Colmar\n\nWe only had 1.5 days in the small French town of Colmar and didn’t feel like it was enough, BUT we are big wanderers. I would’ve loved 2-3 days. If you also prefer a slower pace I would recommend 2 – 3 days. If you are staying in Colmar as a home base and want to explore other towns in the Alsace region, I would recommend 3 – 5 days. If you are staying somewhere else in the Alsace region and just want to do a quick trip to Colmar, France, you could totally do it as a day trip. Just know that it will be a little bit rushed.\n\nHow to get to the small French town of Colmar\n\nAlthough Colmar is just a small town in France, it is easy to get to from many cities in Europe.\n\nIf you’re flying in: select a flight to Strasbourg-Entzheim Airport or EuroAirport. Both are around a 45 minute drive to Colmar. Since Colmar is a small town in France, if you are coming from the United States, you will need book a flight to Europe first. Frankfurt is a popular stop for many USA routes.\n\nIf you’re taking a train: Colmar Station is just a 10 minute walk to the city center\n\nColmar, France is especially easy to get to from Paris, France and Cologne, Germany. It’s the perfect weekend getaway from either of these cities.\n\nFrom Paris, France: 2 hours 15 minutes by train, 3 hours by bus, and 5 hours 20 minutes by car\n\nFrom Cologne, Germany: 3 hours 30 minutes by train, 5 hours by car\n\nBest things to do in Colmar, France\n\n1. Wander Old Town\n\nWandering the old town is one of the best things to do in Colmar, France. We could’ve spent days wandering the cobbled streets of this small town in France! It’s so cute and charming, with each street filled with candy colored buildings and charming details like cut out hearts, rustic paintings on the buildings, and lots of flowers.\n\nLike many small towns in France, these details are not just for aesthetics, they also tell the story of the family living there. Hearts on the building signify that the woman living inside is either available or getting married. The colors are representative of the family’s occupation, such as blue for fishermen and yellow for bakers.\n\nThe small French town is also rich in history as it avoided damage that many other French cities were exposed to during wartime. The town is preserved as a story book vision of old Alsace. You will truly feel like you are walking in a fairy tale as you explore the small French town.\n\nWe recommend spending the majority of your time in Colmar, France in the old quarter. If you prefer a little more structure than aimlessly wandering, the visitor’s center offers a self guided walking tour as part of their recommendations of the best things to do in Colmar.\n\n2. Explore Little Venice\n\nExploring Little Venice was our second favorite thing to do in Colmar, France. Nestled in the back of the old quarter is Little Venice, a storybook vision of canals and bridges. This is usually the image that most people have of Colmar, France and where the most photos are taken of this small French town.\n\nYou can take a boat tour through the canals, dine near the canals, and walk all around. We very much felt like we were in a storybook version of Venice or Amsterdam. Truly so romantic and charming.\n\nDepending on the season, Little Venice may look a little different. In the spring, it’s full of floral wonder, while in the winter, it’s a Christmas wonderland. Perfect any time of the year and one of the best things to do in Colmar, France any time of year. Such a cheery and happy place.\n\n3. Visit the market of Colmar, France\n\nNote: the pictures above are from the old town and not the market\n\nTHIS is where to buy souvenirs if you’re planning on getting any. The covered market dates back to 1865 and after many uses, is now a market again. There are a lot of sights and smells to take in here. We suggest allowing about an hour to walk around and sample the different food offerings. The stalls sell high-quality, local products such as: fruits and vegetables, butchery, charcuterie, dairy, bakery, fish, and souvenirs.We bought a wonderful homemade jam to take home and some delicious cheese. I also ate yet another pretzel here. Plan to have at least one of your meals in Colmar, France at the market.\n\n4. Take a photo at the “Beauty and the Beast Fountain”\n\nOkay, it’s not really called the Beauty and the Beast fountain, but this is my blog and being the Disney obsessed fanatic I am, I’m going to call it that. It’s really called the Fontaine Schwendi and it’s located in a picturesque square, surrounded by pretty half timbered buildings. The statute in the middle of this fountain was created by Frédéric Bartholdi, the same man who designed the Statue of Liberty. It’s not really one of the best things to do in Colmar, France UNLESS you love Beauty and the Beast like I do. In that case, it’s a must thing to do in Colmar!\n\nRumor has it that Belle’s small French town in Beauty and the Beast was inspired by villages in the Alsace region. While Colmar is not confirmed to be the official inspiration for Belle’s village, I had no doubt in my mind that it was. Walking through the cobblestone windy alleys of Colmar, France, I felt very much like I had stepped straight into a Disney movie and walking around Belle’s village. Take a look at the pictures below and see what you think!\n\nDoesn’t this small town in France very much look like Belle’s French town? Like any other dedicated Disney fanatic, I forced Bassam to lip sync to “Bonjour” from Beauty and the Beast on our Instagram Stories. {Because that’s what normal people do right?} Here are our goofy attempts for your viewing pleasure. Try not to laugh at us *too* much, although we will understand if you do.\n\n5. Tour the wines of the Alsace Region\n\nIf you have the time, we recommend taking a tour of the wineries in the Alsace region. There is an official wine tasting route you can do, check it out here. You can take a tour or rent a car to complete the wine tasting tour. These wine tasting tours are without a doubt some of the most popular things to do in Colmar.\n\nIf you don’t have time for a full day of wine tasting, you can still try all the famous varieties at a wine bar or wine shop in Colmar, France. The wines from Alsace are predominantly white. Unlike in Bordeaux and Provence, the wines are named by their grape varieties. The Alsace grape varieties are as follows: reisling, muscat, pinot blanc, sylvaner, pinot gris, Gewurtztraminer, and pinot noir. Unlike their American and German counterparts, these wines are surprisingly dry, light and crisp. There’s also an Alsatian bubbly variety called “Cremant d’alsace.”\n\n6. Visit a museum\n\nWhile all of Colmar feels like a living museum, there are also ten museums. We did not have time to visit any of them, but these four seem interesting as well worth adding to your list of things to do in Colmar:\n\nThe Toy Museum {Musee Jouet}: featuring dolls, cars, puppets, game and more. The exhibits are housed in what used to be a movie theater and gives in dept information on the history of the toys\n\nMusee Bartholdi: named after Colmar’s most famous son, whose statue lives in the Beauty and the Beast fountain I mentioned above. It houses his sculptures and sketches\n\nPfister House: even if you don’t go in, this art gallery is worth passing by for its beautiful architecture. The beautiful gem of Alsace architecture was built in 1537 and features glassed angular oriels and beautiful corbels. The bottom floor has a really great wine store where you can purchase Alsatian wines\n\nUnterlinden Museum: this museum is housed in a 13th-century Dominican sisters’ convent and a 1906 former public baths building. It’s home to a large collection of local and international artworks and manufactured artifacts from prehistorical to contemporary times. It’s supposedly one of the most visited museums in France, with the exception of the museums in Paris\n\n7. Take a day trip to a nearby small French town\n\nWe didn’t have time to do this, but we would’ve really liked to have visited the small French towns of Riquewihr and Ribeauvillé. They both look so charming and were highly recommended by our hotel concierge. We are going back to the Alsace region soon and will update you on all the other villages we visit!\n\nWhat and Where to eat in Colmar, France\n\nEating your way through the town is one of the best things to do in Colmar, but couldn’t that be said about any town? Here are some of the foodie highlights.\n\nFoods to try in Colmar, France:\n\nBretzel: a delight for any pretzel lover! This is the real deal right here. Savory brioche, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, lightly salted and buttered. We went back for seconds\n\nFlammekueche: a flambeed tart made of a blend of cream and cheese and topped with onions and bacon\n\nBerawecka: a soft bun, with spices, dried fruit, and toasted nuts. An Alsatian holiday speciality\n\nPoulet au Riesling: chicken cooked in white wine\n\nAlsace wine: not technically a food, but also not to be missed. The region is especially known for dry whites\n\nWhere to Eat in Colmar, France:\n\nNote: MAKE RESERVATIONS! We did not and were unable to get a seat at the places we wanted to dine\n\nFor a view of the canals:\n\nLe Comptoir de Georges: we expected any restaurants along the canals to be a tourist trap, but the food here was surprisingly really good. It’s such a pretty and relaxing spot to enjoy a glass of wine and a bite to eat. We especially enjoyed the goat cheese pastry pies {feuilletes de chèvre}\n\nFor breakfast:\n\nL’Atelier de Yann: the French are not big breakfast eaters. This was a hard adjustment for Bassam, who NEEDS his eggs in the morning. This is the only place we came across in Colmar, France to offer a traditional French breakfast {pastry} and an American style breakfast {eggs}. The pastry here is delicious and perfect for a dessert and coffee break as well\n\nFor a late night dinner:\n\nLe 3: we arrived late at night to Colmar, France and had a hard time finding many places open. Le 3 was a great option. It’s open late, it’s very causal and friendly, and you don’t need reservations. It’s very warm and cozy and they offer a lot of regional specialties\n\nFor a great dinner:\n\nAs I mentioned above, since we didn’t make reservations, we weren’t able to eat anywhere that was on our list. We just found restaurants as we walked around in old town that had availability. We highly recommend selecting a place from the Michelin Dining Guide. This is how we usually choose where to eat in Europe and it has never steered us wrong. There are several listed on the guide that are Michelin recommended, but not starred. That means they are much lower priced, but still really great food. The list also includes three restaurants that each boast a Michelin star. I also found this post that has more great dining recommendations\n\nWhere to stay in Colmar, France\n\nWe stayed at James Boutique Hotel and LOVED it! The location was perfect for us. It was just a block away from the heart of the city and easily located to all the best things to do in Colmar. It was so fast and easy to walk, but also slightly away from the crowds. The hotel was really nice with a great lobby to hang out, spacious and comfy room, really nice staff, and the price was very reasonable.\n\nHere are some other hotels in Colmar, France that look good:\n\n3 star: Hotel Turenne {Great location and reviews}\n\n4 star: Hotel Le Colombier Suites {Also great location, fantastic reviews, and well priced!}\n\n5 star: La Maison des Tetes {The only 5 star I found in the city center. Great reviews and not badly priced for a 5 star}\n\nSearch hotels in Colmar, France\n\nWhat were your favorite things to do in Colmar?
