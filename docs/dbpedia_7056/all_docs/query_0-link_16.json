        "text": "Colmar, town, Haut-Rhin département, Grand Est région, northeastern France. Colmar is located 42 miles (68 km) south-southwest of Strasbourg, 10 miles west of the Rhine River, bordering the German frontier and a few miles east of the foothills of the Vosges mountains. It is on the main railway from Strasbourg to Mulhouse and Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe first mention of Colmar is in a chronicle of the Saxon wars of Charlemagne, emperor of the West (800–814). In 1226 Colmar was raised to the status of an imperial town by the Holy Roman emperor Frederick II and was surrounded by defensive walls. Civil rights were granted to it by Rudolf of Habsburg in 1278. In 1632, during the Thirty Years’ War, it was occupied by Sweden. Louis XIII of France took the town under his protection in 1635; it was later gradually annexed by France during 1648–78. Colmar was twice annexed by Germany: from 1871 to 1919 and again during World War II.\n\nColmar’s many fountains, ancient churches, and Alsatian Renaissance houses have made it a centre of tourism. The Musée d’Unterlinden, formerly a convent, houses the 16th-century Isenheim Altarpiece, the masterwork of the German religious painter Matthias Grünewald. The home of the sculptor of New York City’s Statue of Liberty, Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi, who was born in Colmar in 1834, is a museum."
