        "text": "Where to Stay in Colmar\n\nI stayed at the aptly-named Colmar Hotel, and it was perfect for all my needs. Literally just a 2-minute walk from Colmar Train Station, Colmar Hotel is also only about a 15-minute walk away to the heart of Colmar, where all the famous sights are.\n\nThe rooms at Colmar Hotel were spacious, intricately designed and comfortable. The staff here were extremely friendly, going the extra mile to treat me well and answer all my questions. I would definitely recommend booking a stay here.\n\nColmar is well-served by France’s train system. From anywhere in France, you’ll be able to take the train to Colmar Station. You can also get to Colmar from other countries. For example, we arrived from Luxembourg, and you can also arrive from Switzerland.\n\nFrom Colmar Train station, the center of Colmar Old Town is about a 10-15-minute walk away.\n\nOf course, you can drive to Colmar easily as well if you have access to a car.\n\nStill, it’s one of Colmar’s prettiest areas, and is definitely worth a stroll through. If you have more time, there are boat tours that will take you through to the canal as well.\n\nAnother impressive church, the Dominican Church is only a short walk away from St Martin’s Church. Works for this church commenced all the way back in 1283, and it’s gone through several reconstructions to look like what it does today.\n\nMarché couvert Colmar\n\nThe Kofihus (otherwise known as Ancienne Douane) is another historic building in Colmar.\n\nThe building previously served as a Customs house, and in its lifetime, has been a theatre, a Catholic boys school and an Israelite school. Today, it’s known as the venue for a few important public events.\n\nThe Unterlinden Museum is one of the best-rated and most visited museums in all of Alsace. The museum is renowned for being the home to the Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Grünewald, a Germain Renaissance artist. Apart from this, it also features an extensive collection of art from local and international artists. Examples include works from Hans Holbein, Claude Monet, Martin Schongauer and Jost Haller.\n\nIf you’re a big art lover, then the Unterlinden Museum is a must visit.\n\nMaison Pfister\n\nYes, Colmar is definitely worth visiting, if you adjust your expectations.\n\nColmar isn’t necessarily one of those places with a long list of ‘must see’ attractions, but the town as a whole is a must-do. Life in Colmar feels very whimsical. There’s a special romantic atmosphere here that’s difficult to capture in pictures, so you should come visit and feel it for yourself.\n\nThe best way to plan your day is to pick out a few attractions to visit, and spend the rest of your time just casually strolling through Colmar’s many cute shops, café’s and houses.\n\nIf you’re coming from a long way away (from Paris, for example), then I would save a visit to Colmar up until you get closer to the Alsace area, so you can combine it with a visit to other cities, towns and villages – Strasbourg, Egusheim, Turckheim, Obernai are just a few destinations worth visiting as well. Although Colmar is wonderful, I don’t think it’s worth to drive 5+ hours here for a day trip, as it would be too rushed."
