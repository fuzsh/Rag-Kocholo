        "text": "Many visitors to Strasbourg often build in a day trip to Colmar, France after researching what to do. The second-largest city in the Bas Rhin region is easily accessible by train. Moreover, the city is Colmar takes even seasoned visitors to French towns by surprise. It’s just that beautiful.\n\nWhere is Colmar, France?\n\nColmar is part of the Alsace region in Eastern France. It is the third largest city (pop. ~70,000) after Strasbourg and Mulhouse. Typically, people visit Colmar by taking a train from Strasbourg. The ride takes 30 minutes and costs around 20 euros roundtrip. If you’re planning a trip to Colmar, note that the price of the ticket will vary depending on when you plan to visit and how far in advance you book your ticket.\n\nThe city of Colmar is situated on the Alsace Wine Route, with the Vosges Mountains rising into the sky to the west. Colmar has known many identities, having been viciously squabbled over by the French and Germans in the past. The city also endured a long German occupation during the Second World War.\n\nIn the end, the Alsatians and their language persevered. Today the city is known for a variety of things including:\n\nan international summer festival of classical music,\n\na museum all about toys, and\n\nthe Alsatian Wine Fair.\n\nNearby cities of interest when planning a trip to Colmar\n\nStrasbourg, France (30 minutes)\n\nBaden-Baden, Germany (1 hour 20 minutes)\n\nFreiburg, Germany (30 minutes)\n\nLuxembourg, Luxembourg (2.5 hours)\n\nOther, larger nearby cities include Paris, Zurich, and Frankfurt. They also have international airports.\n\nOf note: Basel, a much smaller city situated on the French/German/Swiss border, also has an international airport accessible by train from Colmar to an airport shuttle pickup point. When coming from a French city, take care to get off the train on the French side so that you are not\n\nI visited one summer day with my friend Laura, the mastermind behind Story of a City. We arrived in the morning and went directly to the tourist office. (Or rather, as directly as possible given that we’d exited the train station on the incorrect side.)\n\nNote: If you arrive by train and exit onto an industrial-looking street with no signs indicating the direction of the city center, you’ve come out the wrong side.\n\nThe woman working at the tourist office got us set up with a city map and recommended that we keep an eye out for gold triangles on the ground.\n\nShe told us these would lead us around Colmar past its most important and impressive sites and helpfully circled the most touristic attractions. Then, we were on our way – just in time to see the brown-and-tan tourist train pull in and empty out.\n\nI’d actually never been on such a touristy contraption prior to this fateful day, but Laura was more than willing. So, we paid a few euros and clambered aboard. It was about half an hour with an audio history narrative (available in nearly a dozen languages!). The narrative played intermittently as we trundled around the narrow cobblestone streets admiring the views.\n\nI have to admit, anytime I’m lectured, I start to get sleepy.\n\nI was also trying to follow the French version. But, I did hear Colmar-native Frédéric Bartholdi’s name mentioned A LOT. Turns out he’s a famous sculptor who designed the Statue of Liberty! Also, if you’re the museum type, there’s an entire museum devoted to him – the Musée Bartholdi. (1)\n\nI was also pleased with our decision to take the tourist train because it was a great chance way to get oriented in the city before exploring on foot. I’m horrendous at directions and have no sixth-city sense. What this means is that, in practice, I tend to wander in the direction of the suburbs or highway when left to my own devices.\n\nAfter the tour, we set out to discover Colmar on foot.\n\nColmar is known as the Wine Capital of Alsace\n\nAlthough cities such as Bordeaux, Beaune, and Reims may proclaim their expertise in wine more loudly, Colmar enjoys a celebrated and unique position of authority in France’s wine industry.\n\nAccording to an interview on Tourisme Colmar, Colmar has exported wine since the Middle Ages. Interestingly, Alsace and Corsica are the only two regions in France that make independent decisions about their wine – the others must get approval via a process centralized in Paris. (2)\n\nAnd the heart of wine in Alsace? Colmar.\n\nAlsace is known for white wines\n\nWhen browsing for a local bottle at the market or attending a wine tasting, expect to try Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Sylvaner, and Pinot Gris. Delicious rosé can be found as well, produced with local Pinot Noir grapes.\n\nTip: Personally, I’m a huge fan of Riesling because it is often produced dry and mineral-y. But if you prefer a sweeter white, you can’t go wrong with a Gewürztraminer.\n\nSurrounded by adorable villages such as Eguisheim and Riquewihr, the adorable architecture and fairytale feel of the rolling hills often disguise a fierce intensity and passion for upholding the proud Alsatian wine tradition.\n\nEvery year, Colmar hosts a Festival of Wine. This year’s runs from July 26th to August 4th, 2024. (3)\n\nThings to Do in Colmar, France\n\nOur ramblings took us to the following places.\n\nBelle’s reading fountain\n\nRemember that scene in the original Beauty and the Beast when Belle takes a break from singing about how boring her little town is to singing about her favorite part in the book she just borrowed for the upteenth time?\n\nThat fountain was inspired by this very one. It’s also rumored that Colmar itself was the inspiration for the animated French town. The fountain’s actual name is Fontaine Schwendi. And, the sculptor was the one and only Frédéric Bartholdi.\n\nColmar’s Covered Market\n\nAfter meandering all around the city, this little covered market is the perfect place for a lunch break. Ask about:\n\nthe local cheese at the long fromage counter\n\nlocal wine recommendations in le coin du vin\n\ntarte flambée (that’s flammekueche in German) on the outdoor terrace, and\n\nwatch the little wooden boats floating by on their afternoon tour of the quartier (neighborhood) the locals call “Little Venice.”\n\nWeather in Colmar, France\n\nThe weather in Colmar is similar to that of Strasbourg. The best times to visit are typically between May and October. It’s worth noting, though, that the past two summers have sent temperatures soaring well into the 90s in July and August.\n\nBest Restaurants in Colmar, France\n\nAs with anywhere in Alsace, lovers of hearty German-esque fare will find much to love about dining options. But, fine dining options abound too, with some really wonderful options boasting delicious and creative meals, typically using locally sourced, in-season ingredients.\n\nWhat food is Colmar famous for?\n\nTypical dishes in Colmar include:\n\nbaeckaoffe (a dish composed of three types of marinated meat and potatoes in white wine)\n\nle coq au Riesling (chicken in wine)\n\nThere are also sweet foods to try, such as:\n\npain d´épices (most similar to a local gingerbread)\n\nKougelhopf (sweet brioche traditionally made in a large ceramic mold with raisin marinaded in kirsch)\n\nResources"
