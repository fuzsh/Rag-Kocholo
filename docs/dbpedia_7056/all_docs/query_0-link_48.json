        "text": "We visited Colmar on a whim. I saw a photo of this small town in the Alsace region of France, close to the German border, and decided we should visit without knowing much about it. It was a good decision.\n\nColmar is so pretty that it doesnâ€™t feel real. Said to be one of the places that inspired Disneyâ€™s Beauty and The Beast, it certainly feels as if youâ€™ve stepped straight into a fairytale.\n\nCobblestone streets run next to canals lined with half-timbered houses in shades of rose, sky blue, lemon, peppermint, and apricot, many dating back to the 14th century.\n\nThe olde worlde buildings are distinctly Germanic but feature elegant French shutters. It can be hard to remember youâ€™re in France, but locals speak French, and the bakeries are full of croissants and pain au chocolate.\n\nIn this guide, you will find out the best things to do in Colmar, where to stay and where to eat. At the end, there is a map with everything mentioned.\n\nContents\n\nWhere is Colmar, France?\n\nHistory of Colmar\n\nThe Best Things to Do in Colmar\n\nWhere to Eat in Colmar\n\nWhere to Stay in Colmar\n\nColmar Alsace France Map\n\nIs Colmar Worth Visiting?\n\nMore France Posts\n\nWhere is Colmar, France?\n\nColmar is in the North-East of France along the border with Germany in the Alsace region. It is also close to Switzerland.\n\nGiven its location and convenient train station, 10 minutes walk from the town centre, visiting Colmar could not be easier.\n\nYou can book all trains on the SNCF website.\n\nWe visited Colmar as part of a month-long train trip around Europe. If you are doing something similar then we would recommend getting an Interrail (EU) or Eurail (Non-EU) pass.\n\nFrom Paris: The Paris to Colmar train journey is 2 hours and 20 minutes on the TGV. Most trains require you to change at Strasbourg, but there are a few direct trains from Paris Gare de lâ€™Est. Single fare from â‚¬60-â‚¬115 (Â£50-Â£95).\n\nFrom Strasbourg: The train from Strasbourg is a short 30-minute ride with regular trains throughout the day. Single fare from â‚¬5-â‚¬15 (Â£4-Â£13).\n\nFrom Basel: 43 minutes by train. Single fare from â‚¬5-â‚¬16 (Â£4-Â£14).\n\nBack to Contents\n\nHistory of Colmar\n\nIt is no surprise, given its location, that the village of Colmar has had an eventful past with France and Germany, passing between the powers over the centuries.\n\nIn 1673, France conquered Colmar, only for Germany to claim the Alsace region in 1871. Germany retained the town until after WWI, when it returned to the French.\n\nInevitably Colmar was re-occupied by the Germans during WW2. The last town in France to be liberated at the end of the Second World War, it has remained under French control ever since.\n\nThis dizzying history with its blend of influences is on full display throughout the town, through its buildings, food, drink and culture.\n\nBack to Contents\n\nThe Best Things to Do in Colmar\n\n1) Admire the Attractively Decorated Architecture\n\nWhilst Colmar is a compact place to explore, you could easily spend a whole day wandering and admiring the architecture alone.\n\nNot only can you see the German-French influence, but the buildings trace back to medieval and Renaissance roots.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, when the town was prosperous, citizens were urged to put their wealth on display through their decorations.\n\nLocals are still rightfully proud of their attractive homes, decorating them with pots of geraniums, colourful shutters, wrought iron lamps and signs, and often even more bizarre adornments.\n\nAs we wandered the streets, we felt like weâ€™d stepped into the pages of a picture-perfect fairytale.\n\n2) Explore Little Venice Colmar by Boat\n\nThe most picturesque area of Colmar is Little Venice, a short but charming canal with the river Lauch stretching between Pont Saint-Pierre and Rue des Tanneurs.\n\nMerchants used to sell their wares from flat-bottomed boats along the canal. Interestingly, the different coloured buildings represented the traders who occupied them: blue for fishmongers, white for bakers, yellow were cheesemakers, green for grocers, and pink for the less ahem family-friendly type of trade!\n\nWe enjoyed the view from the bridge at Quai de la Poissonnerie and got another perspective from the water on a 25-minute boat ride.\n\nWe took a boat trip with Sweet Narcisse, which cost â‚¬7 for 25 minutes (â‚¬4 for children 4-10, free for children under 4). Tours run every 15 minutes from 9.45am â€“ 11.45am/ 1.45pm â€“ 6.45pm in the summer. Times vary in winter. Booking online is advised.\n\n3) Take a Self-Guided Tour of the Historic Centre\n\nColmarâ€™s historic centre is pedestrianised and compactâ€”we never ended up more than 15 minutes from our apartment. The streets are lined with cobblestones, so itâ€™s easy to feel like youâ€™ve stepped through time.\n\nWe followed the self-guided walking tour on a map from the tourist office multiple times during our two-day stay. The Discovery Trail is handily signposted with gold triangles and an etching of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThe famous statueâ€™s sculptor Auguste Bartholdi was born in Colmar. A miniature replica of Lady Liberty welcomes people into the north of Colmar.\n\nThe best Colmar attractions in the historic centre include the KoÃ¯fhus (The Old Customs House, the oldest public building in Colmar dating back to 1480), the Tanners District, the Pfister House, the House of Heads and the Covered Market.\n\nBe sure to visit the Schwendi Fountain, designed by Auguste Bartholdi in 1898. Although not officially the fountain that inspired the one featured in Beauty and the Beast, itâ€™s so uncannily similar that itâ€™s one of the best Colmar tourist attractions for Disney fans!\n\nThe afternoons can get busy, mainly with older holidaymakers from France and Germany following the Alsace wine route, but the crowds never felt overwhelming.\n\nAt 7 am on my morning run, I had the streets to myself; even at 10 am, they were quiet.\n\nTo learn more about the history of Colmar, why not try this private guided tour, or try this fun self-guided scavenger hunt for those who want to channel the Davinci Code!\n\n4) Visit Saint Martin and Saint Matthieu\n\nDespite its small size, the town features two substantial 13th-century churches, Gothic Saint Martin (often mistakenly called the cathedral) and Protestant Saint Matthieu.\n\nRoman catholic Saint Martin was built between 1235 and 1365 and has been restored several times over the centuries. Itâ€™s a striking church built in the gothic style with red and gold stones. Look out for the Alsation colourful roof tiles.\n\nSaint Matthieu protestant church was constructed in 1292. It has had several renovations through the ages, including a ceiling lowered and re-raised and converted into a hospital in the 16th century.\n\nItâ€™s an impressive building to visit with a famous Silbermann organ from 1732. With its superb acoustics, the church is one of the main venues in Colmarâ€™s annual International Music Festival.\n\nBoth are free to enter and explore and worth adding to your Colmar itinerary.\n\n5) Make a Gourmet Picnic\n\nThe centre is full of classy boutiques and shops selling local gourmet productsâ€”white wine, cheese, sausages, chocolates, salted caramels, jars of sauerkraut, and bretzels (salty or sweet pretzels).\n\nThe covered market is an excellent place to pick up picnic supplies, perfect for a bike ride (see below).\n\n7) Visit Eguisheim Village by Bike\n\nOne of our favourite things to do in Colmar was hiring bikes to cycle to one of the nearest villages on the Alsace wine route, Eguisheim.\n\nWe didnâ€™t think it was possible, but the quiet village of Eguisheim is even cuter and prettier than Colmar.\n\nThe colourful, half-timbered houses are similar to Colmarâ€™s, but the narrow cobblestone streets run in concentric circles around the central square.\n\nThe flower displays are even more extravagant, and some of the 16th-century buildings tilt precariously.\n\nEguisheim is 7km from Colmar along a flat route. It took us 25 minutes to cycle along the main road (the Alsace wine route).\n\nIt was a bit busy but had lovely views of the hills and vineyards. On the way back, it took us 30 minutes on a much quieter route along the river and through corn fields and vegetable farms.\n\nWe rented bikes from Colmar Velo next to the train station. A city bike costs â‚¬8 adult/ â‚¬6.50 child for a half day and â‚¬11 adult/ â‚¬9 child for a full day.\n\nHybrid bikes are available at â‚¬13 adult/ â‚¬9 child per day, and electric bikes are â‚¬33 adult/â‚¬9 child per day. You need ID and a â‚¬150 deposit per bike (by card is fine).\n\nAdvanced booking is recommended, and rentals include a map, helmets and a puncture repair kit. Child seats are also available upon request for â‚¬4 per day.\n\nWhy not pair a bike ride with a wine tasting tour with this Alsace Vineyards and Wine Villages Private Bike Tour that starts just outside Colmar and includes bike hire.\n\n8) Go Wine Tasting Along the Alsace Wine Route\n\nStretching 170km from North to South of the region (Strasbourg to Colmar), the Alsace Wine Trail is the oldest wine route in France.\n\nThe famous route takes in Colmar and other picturesque wine-growing towns and villages (a whopping 70+!) and winds through lush green hills and vineyards.\n\nThe region produces delicious dry whites, sweet sparkling varieties, and rosÃ©s. Unsurprisingly you will also find outstanding Rieslings, Gewurztraminers, and Pinot Gris.\n\nExploring the wine trail further is more than enough enticement for us to return to the Alsace region!\n\nWhy not try this 4 Wonders of Alsace tour that offers pickup/ drop offs from your accommodation in Colmar.\n\nBack to Contents\n\nWhere to Eat in Colmar\n\nRestaurants are quite expensive, and as the local cuisine isnâ€™t ideal for vegetarians, we stuck to homemade meals of baguettes, cheese, and salad (the Monoprix is also good for supplies).\n\nOrganic restaurant Lâ€™Arpege has a vegetarian lunch menu, but it was fully booked when we visited.\n\nWe did enjoy an aperitif of local white wine, cheese, and tasty vegetable dips at Lâ€™Un des Sens wine bar.\n\nOther popular food and drink places in Colmar include:\n\nLa Stub â€“ A popular cheap-eat that specialises in savoury and sweet Flammekueche/ Tarte flambÃ©e AKA German pizza.\n\nBistrot Gourmand â€“ A cute bistro for breakfast and brunch options from crepes to sandwiches and salads and more.\n\nLe Cercle Des Aromes â€“ A wine bar with over 200 Alsace wines available by the glass to sample! They also have platters of cured meats and cheese to compliment your wine tasting.\n\nMuang Thai â€“ An authentic Thai restaurant for those who want a break from French or German cuisine. They have refreshing Thai iced tea for summer visits to Colmar.\n\nRestaurant Lâ€™incontournable â€“ A small bistro near Little Venice that has recommended set menus.\n\nEdelwâ€™ice â€“ A good ice cream spot with a range of flavours and also vegan and lactose-free options.\n\nBack to Contents\n\nWhere to Stay in Colmar\n\nBasing yourself in the historic centre or Little Venice makes sense, given all the main attractions. However, like in any touristy neighbourhood, the accommodation will be more expensive.\n\nStaying in Saint-LÃ©on, North Colmar, or near the train station will give you less pricey options.\n\nYou will most likely be in a charming historic building wherever you decide.\n\nWe stayed in an apartment in an atmospheric old building on Rue Des TÃªtes. Unfortunately, the exact place is no longer available, but the highly rated Appartements des 2 TÃªtes are in the same building and have modern amenities.
