        "text": "823 The Carolingian domain, “Columbarium” was first mentioned in a charter of the emperor, Louis the Pious\n\n1226 Colmar appears in a text as a town in its own right (civitatis).\n\n1278 Rodolphe of Habsburg grants the town franchise under the Franchise Charter.\n\n1354 Colmar participates in the creation of the Décapole, federation of the 10 imperial towns of Alsace.\n\n1360 Colmar is endowed with a new constitution by the emperor, Charles IV, which was a huge victory of the bourgeoisie over the nobility.\n\n1480 Construction of the current building, the Old Customs House or Koïfhus.\n\n1536 The Peasants War causes turmoil in Colmar, and the Reform’s first proponents appear.\n\n1575 Late introduction of the Reform in Colmar.\n\n1635 The Rueil Treaty places Colmar under the King of France’s protectorate\n\n1648 The Munster Treaty in Westphalia: French people leave Colmar, and the Empire’s imminence is confirmed.\n\n1679 The Nimegue Treaty: Colmar becomes a royal town of France.\n\n1698 The Sovereign Council of Alsace is established in Colmar, which becomes the judicial capital of the whole province.\n\n1753 Voltaire spends 13 months in Colmar.\n\n1773 Establishment of the Military Academy of Colmar by the poet and teacher, Pfeffel.\n\n1790 Colmar becomes the county seat of the Upper Rhine département.\n\n1800 Colmar becomes the seat of the prefecture and of the Court of Appeals.\n\n1854 The cholera epidemic claims many lives.\n\n1871 Under the Treaty of Frankfurt, Colmar, like all of Alsace, is annexed to the German Empire.\n\n1918 On November 18th, the jubilant entry of the French troops in Colmar.\n\n1945 On February 2nd, the town is liberated after the harsh battles of the “Pocket of Colmar.”\n\nChronology extracted from ”Colmar, Mémoire d’une ville” by Gabriel BRAEUNER (Colmar, Jérome Do Bentzinger Editeur, 2000).\n\nThe beast of Colmar\n\nThe informed visitor of Colmar knows that it is best to steer clear of the rue des Clefs at certain hours of the night. The street, by day a bustling shopping area (the Town Hall is also in the same street) at nightfall becomes the haunt of a terrifying calf, the famous Colmar Nachtkalb.\n\nNo one knows exactly how long he has been playing his evil tricks, lowing mightily from his hiding place and sometimes charging poor animals that have wandered away from the safety of their homes or tourists staggering out of the local wistubs, their bellies full of the local wine.\n\nThe club of Hercules\n\nHercules, the half-God, on his way back from the garden of Hesperides, found himself in the region between the Vosges and the Rhine, that would later become Alsace. It was late, hot and he was thirsty. He decided to halt and drank local wine that was (already) good.\n\nEntering an inn, he downed vast quantities of the local wine which was reputed even then and thereupon fell into a deep sleep, his head spinning. When he came to the next morning, his head was aching and he saw that his herd had run off during the night. Rushing off in hot pursuit, he left his club behind. The locals, with their love of all things tidy, eventually placed the forgotten club in the town´s coat of arms. This probably explains why, for as long as can be remembered, the inhabitants of Colmar have been known as the Kolbnarren - the mad clubmen.\n\nThe phantom of the milkwoman\n\nIf you lie in wait patiently, on certain nights in the rue des Augustins, just next to the prison of Colmar, you can espy the pale, furtive outline of a woman clothed all in white, the phantom of the milkwoman.\n\nThe poor woman, many, many years ago, was caught adding water to her milk and God, from a sense of justice, obliged her to return every night, in her penitent´s garb, to throw the offending liquid into the well of the Augustinians.\n\nThe mysterious horse with no body\n\nSeldom seen, but even more terrifying, on certain days of the year around midnight, there can be heard whinnying and the clattering of hooves on some stairways, heralding the fleeting glimpse of the bodiless, emaciated head of a galloping nag."
