        "text": "Stroll with Sweet Narcisse from the Saint-Pierre Bridge\n\nI chose to test the boat ride in Colmar with Sweet Narcisse, which I recommend. The walk takes place on the Lauch, the name of the river that crosses Colmar, starting from the Pont Saint-Pierre in Little Venice.\n\nOn the river in a flat-bottomed boat\n\nHere I am sitting in a flat-bottomed boat, like a tourist passing through Colmar. It is necessary to know how to be a tourist in its own region, it is very pleasant! These specially shaped boats were originally used by market gardeners to transport their vegetables to market.\n\nBoat tour in Little Venice and the Market Gardeners\n\nThe boat trip takes us through different parts of Colmar. The famous Little Venice, of course, but also the residential district of Les MaraÃ®chers, where vegetables used to come from, before returning to the city center to Les Halles, which still houses a covered market where I also recommend you to go.\n\nThe boat glides slowly on the water, letting us admire the landscape: half-timbered houses and green nature are there. The atmosphere is peaceful, it is very pleasant. Throughout the boat ride, the boatman gives us explanations on the history of Colmar. However, he takes a break when we pass through the residential area, so as not to disturb the peace of the neighborhood.\n\nHow long does the boat tour take?"
