        "text": "Driving from the Ramstein area:\n\nFrom the Ramstein area, the trip is about 2.5 hours one way. As a day trip, it may not be ideal for families with little kids or those on a time crunch. You may want to consider spending the night or making it your base for a few nights to visit different towns in the Alsace area. Some of my favorites: Riquehihr, Eguisheim, Kaysersberg, & Strasbourg. (Stay tuned for more videos & posts on these towns).\n\nThere are a few routes if you drive to Colmar. Most of the quicker routes require you to drive on the A4 in France with tolls. For a day trip, I normally pay it, at least one way. When you approach the toll booths the first time, you will take the printed ticket. Look for the lanes with the Euro signs. You pay when you exit. The machines take tap & pay, credit cards & cash. Tolls are 3.95 - 7 euro depending on the route. There are a few routes with no tolls that can add up to 30 minutes.\n\nParking\n\nThere are lots of areas available for parking including garages, lots & street parking. I was able to fit my older model Ford Explorer in this lot (Parking Montagne Verte). It's also is a short walk to market 2 of the Christmas Market. I really enjoyed parking at Parking Turenne. It is very close to La Petite Venise but qualifies as European tight parking spots. I had our other car & not sure I would have gotten the Explorer in there. The payment machines take euro, card, tap & pay or parking apps. Pay first then take the ticket & display it in your windshield. Make sure you know your license plate number as well.\n\nParking Apps: https://www.colmar.fr/paybyphone-easypark-flowbird\n\nGetting Acquainted with the Colmar\n\nThe first thing I do after parking the car & finding the toilet is to head to the tourist center. Keep in mind, the tourism offices in Alsace close for at least an hour in the afternoon. Current hours are Monday - Saturday 1000-1300/1400-1700 and closed Sundays. They have information about Colmar, nearby Alsatian towns & souvenirs.\n\nAlsace website\n\nColmar Tourism website\n\nBoth of these websites offer a wealth of information. If you like to plan there is information on museums, restaurants, hotels, etc. The Alsace website allows you to order paper maps & brochures to be sent to your local address or download.\n\nGROCERY STORES\n\nI have a few favorites I visit when I go to France. There’s Cora, Leclerc, & Monoprix. In Colmar, consider visiting the Cora on the way out of town. This location is huge & clean. (You can also see the traffic circle with the Statue of Liberty.) I buy baked goods to bring home to the family. I’ve also picked up fresh baguettes & the salted butter for newcomers as part of their welcome package. If you want some goodies to send in care packages, there is a good selection of housewares: hotpads, dish towels, mugs, wine glasses. I even found some Alsace themed baking supplies.\n\nAre you interested in all the locations I’ve visited? It’s all together in one list on my Google map of Colmar."
