While in Colmar, France, no one broke out in song, walking through the half-timbered town of Colmar is quite possibly one of the best things to do in France. So much beauty crammed into one little town, you wonder how it can possibly be real. While I will share with you what to do in Colmar in a day, we could have easily extended our visit and never ever left! Though perhaps that might be a bit of an overkill.\n\nWant the Beauty & Beast Experience in Colmar? PIN IT FOR LATER!!\n\n50+ STUPID PRETTY Towns in Europe\n\n72 Road Trip Essentials\n\nYour ESSENTIAL Guide to Europe\n\n3 Day Alsace Wine Route Itinerary\n\nThis article is now available as a mobile app. Go to GPSMyCity to download the app for GPS-assisted travel directions to the attractions featured in this article!\n\nWhere is Colmar?\n\nLocated in one of the most beautiful regions in France, Colmar is situated along the eastern border of France, sharing a border with Germany. Surrounding Colmar and it’s equally picturesque neighboring towns are endless rows of vineyards. If you plan to visit Colmar and the neighboring towns located along the Alsace Wine Route, a minimum of 3 days is required to absorb the beauty of these charming towns and to explore the French countryside.\n\nAbout the Alsace Wine Route\n\nAs previously mentioned, Colmar’s beautiful architecture is a blend of both German and French techniques, and many of the buildings date back to the 1400s, taking you back to a time long gone! Located in the center of town is the Saint Martin Collegiate Church with the town’s beauty emanating from its core. Many of the important sights to see in Colmar also include the Maison des Têtes, Dominican Church, the Pfister House – also known as Maison Pfister, – and the Old Customs House.\n\nExplore Colmar’s “Little Venice”\n\nNicknamed “Little Venice”, this picturesque quarter of Colmar is the highlight of exploring the town. An array of pastel colored, half-timbered houses line cobbled-stone streets, many of which line the canal. What was once a thriving area of gardeners, butchers, tanners and fishmongers, it’s now one of the most beautiful parts of the city, no thanks in part to the fact that the city was one of the French towns that escaped WWII with little to no damage, thus preserving its unique, Disney-esque apperance, making it one of the prettiest canal cities in Europe!\n\nWhile meandering the town by foot is highly recommended and is easy for all, a unique way to experience Colmar’s Little Venice is by taking a canal boat tour. Located next to the restaurant Le Caveau Saint-Pierre, you can hop aboard a flat-bottomed boat, the tour guide will provide you with unique history into the town as you admire the pretty array of rainbow colored half-timbered houses. Boat tours last about 30 minutes and are 6€ per person.\n\nRelated: Alluring canal Cities of Europe\n\nThe Fisherman’s Quay\n\nAfter your boat tour, you should definitely explore Little Venice by foot, as you can also stroll along the Quai de la Poissonnerie by perusing some of the quaint shops, cozy cafes and stop at some of the best patisseries in Colmar! You’ll be snapping an endless amount of photos along the way! Stretched out along the Lauch River, this part of Petite Venise is one of the most photographed streets in Colmar!\n\nLearn About Frederic Auguste Bartholdi\n\nIf you’re interested in visiting France and are looking for more information, I highly recommend using the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide or the Lonely Plant Travel Guide! Without these guides, I would be lost! These are my travel Bibles!\n\nDisclaimer: This post contains affiliate links.
