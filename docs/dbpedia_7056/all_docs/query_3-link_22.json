        "text": "I'm guessing you're interested in making a trip to Alsace (and lots of other parts of Europe too).\n\nNormally your first stop will be an Alsace city.\n\nAlsace cities make planning your trip easy. They have shops and restaurants. You don't need a car. You can take trains and the occasional taxi.\n\nBut here in Alsace, you may be surprised to find that we don't have that many cities.\n\nAnd on many travel sites, they confuse the villages and the cities a bit. Some people come to Alsace thinking Colmar is a village, for example.\n\nOr they stay in Strasbourg and miss out on all the other interesting villages and smaller cities in the region.\n\nHere we are going to talk about ALL the Alsace towns and cities.\n\nThe ones you've probably heard of (and may have already visited) and some towns that you might really enjoy (that no one talks about much).\n\nWhat is the Difference between an Alsace Town and an Alsace Village?\n\nSo what is the difference between a town or city and a village? you might be wondering.\n\nIn a village in Alsace, you can get to open, natural or green areas very quickly (maybe it's mountains, vineyards or big open spaces with few buildings).\n\nIn smaller towns, you usually still need a map to figure out where they are.\n\nAnd it takes awhile to get to those green areas by foot. You might even make a few wrong turns while trying to get there.\n\nThis is how I separate the villages from the small towns (and cities).\n\nAnd all the towns and cities have train stations of varying sizes. Alsace train stations aren't very big even in Strasbourg and Colmar by the way.\n\n1. Strasbourg\n\nChances are you've heard something about Strasbourg.\n\nIt's the capital city of the Alsace region (and now the Grand Est region). The largest city in Alsace (which is easy because we don't have many big cities).\n\nThe Capital of Christmas...we're famous for our Christmas markets.\n\nNot part of the wine region...so if you're interested in wine, you'll have to leave the city.\n\nAnd oh yeah...we have a pretty amazing medieval cathedral....and so many fascinating stories, history, culture, and more.\n\nBut there's a lot more you need to know about Strasbourg before your trip to Alsace...\n\n2. Colmar\n\nEven though it's a small town in Alsace...\n\nIt's big enough to keep you busy on your next visit. This town has made quite a few \"must see\" lists for travel in France.\n\nColmar can compete with Strasbourg for your attention despite its smaller size.\n\nAnd it's very centrally located in the Alsace region.\n\nBut Colmar is not Strasbourg. These are two unique and different cities with different stories to tell you.\n\nSo if you are wondering \"Which is better Strasbourg or Colmar?\" Well, I can only show you what they have to offer. Because they are both interesting (and beautiful) in different ways.\n\n3. Mulhouse\n\nMulhouse is the second largest city in Alsace.\n\nAnd the town that most tourists can't pronounce the right way. A little hint, there is no \"ow as in cow\" sound in French.\n\nNot that Mulhouse is really a French town name.\n\nBut it may be a little early to start talking about the Alsatian language and its pronunciation.\n\nIt's not a town where you see much tourism (well, not like Strasbourg and Colmar). But it has something to offer certain visitors.\n\nAnd if you like stories, this Alsace town has plenty.\n\nIf you're wondering if Mulhouse, has an airport, the answer is no...and yes. There is no airport in the town itself. But it has an airport...technically.\n\n4. Haguenau\n\nHaguenau is the fourth largest city in the region.\n\nAnd it's the biggest one in the enormous area north of Strasbourg (that not too many people go to but should if they love history and culture).\n\nThe favorite town in Alsace of certain Holy Roman Emperors...\n\nFrederick Barbarossa (and quite a few other emperors) loved to make stops in Haguenau to do a bit of hunting in the enormous forest around the town.\n\nThere's even a story with Richard the Lion Heart in this Alsace town.\n\nAnd that big forest (the one the emperors love so much) is where we can find the clay to make our traditional Alsace pottery. Maybe you've seen it. Most of it is very colorful and we still use it here in the region.\n\nWe still make our traditional pottery, but we get clay from many different sources now.\n\n5. Saverne\n\nSitting right next to the border between Alsace and Lorraine is the important town of Saverne (with lots of medieval castles if you're into that).\n\nAn Alsace town named for a place to get a drink on a Roman road...\n\nAnd before the Romans there was a large Celtic community too. So Saverne has been a popular place to be for thousands of years.\n\nThe Bishop of Strasbourg (a pretty important and powerful guy in Alsace) even moved to this town and built an enormous and beautiful palace.\n\nAnd if that doesn't get your attention...they also make their own beer!\n\nThat's right, one of Alsace's well known beers is made in this town. We're far away from the wine region here, so you'll have to make do with the castles, palaces, beer and much more.\n\n6. Selestat\n\nOne of the most centrally located towns in Alsace...\n\nAlmost exactly the same distance (give or take a few kilometers) to the most northern point of Alsace as to the most southern point in the region.\n\nBut Selestat has much more to offer...\n\nThis town was home to one of the most prestigious schools in the 1400s and 1500s.... and not just in Alsace. The wealthy sent their boys to Selestat from Lorraine, Switzerland, and Germany.\n\nAnd if you like old books...they have an amazing collection of old books...really old books. Like handwritten texts from the 700s and 800s all the way to the first printed books in the 1400s and 1500s.\n\nBut there's more than just books in Selestat...\n\n7. Obernai\n\nOne of the most popular towns to visit in Northern Alsace (after Strasbourg of course).\n\nSo you can expect to find lots of souvenir shops, tour buses and other tour groups walking around in the pretty town of Obernai.\n\nYou might have thought that Obernai is a village, but it's more of a town (or an extremely large village). You should be able to easily visit the historic parts of town by foot of course.\n\nAnd it's the official birthplace of Alsace's patron saint, Odile.\n\nWell, maybe. Her father was an extremely important guy here in Alsace, so maybe she was born in their castle in the mountains above the town or in the palace in town.\n\nOh, the challenges of noble life in the 600s...\n\n8. Saint Louis\n\nYou may be wondering why I've included the town of Saint Louis.\n\nMainly because if you're visiting Alsace, there's no really good reason for you to explore this growing (but not so exciting town).\n\nBut...you may need to know about it for travel purposes.\n\nBecause Saint Louis is the unofficial suburb of Basel Switzerland. Nearly everyone living in this town works in Switzerland.\n\nAnd when you fly into the Basel Mulhouse airport, you will technically be in Saint Louis.\n\n9. Basel\n\nBasel is not an Alsace city, but it's our closest neighbor.\n\nIt's a Swiss city and it is so close to our region that part of Alsace is a suburb of Basel. And there's even a Basel tram that goes to one of our train stations\n\nAnd it's a fabulous city (that for some reason Swiss guide books ignore).\n\nIf you're looking to add a little bit of Switzerland to your trip, Basel is an easy add-on. Just remember to adjust your budget, because everything in Switzerland is much more expensive than Alsace.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Alsace\n\nAre you just getting started thinking about coming to Alsace?\n\nLet's get you started off right with some of the most need-to-know details about your (hopefully) new favorite.\n\nWhat is Alsace France?\n\nAlsace is one of the smallest regions in France.\n\nTechnically we're now part of the Grand Est region since 2016 (with the Lorraine and Champagne regions).\n\nAlthough most Alsatians (and the regions of Lorraine and Champange) don't really like being put into one big region.\n\nSo, I would stick to calling us Alsace and Lorraine and Champagne.\n\nYou can find us in the north-eastern corner, right next to Germany and Switzerland. In fact some may say that we are the part of France that pokes into Germany a little bit.\n\nIf you learn anything about our history, you'll discover that it was a detail worth fighting over.\n\nThere was so much fighting.\n\nAnd although Alsace is a part of France now, it wasn't always the case. So Alsatian culture is pretty different than the rest of France.\n\nAn Alsace Map: How to Find Alsace on a Map\n\nSo, where is Alsace exactly?\n\nFrance isn't a huge country, but planning your trip with a little France geography in mind can make your travel plans much easier to organize.\n\nAnd Alsace is in a fantastic part of Europe, especially if you love travel.\n\nI can tell you that all of us here living in Alsace definitely take advantage of it.\n\nYou are really centrally located (Europe-wise) in Alsace.\n\nAnd I may be a little biased, but I think the eastern side of France is the best. So many fascinating and delicious places to visit on OUR side.\n\nIs It the Alsace Wine Route or the Alsace Wine Region?\n\nMaybe you're heard that we make wine in Alsace.\n\nAnd we do! Technically even the Celts made something alcoholic with the wild grape vines growing in Alsace.\n\nBut for most of Alsace, wine making started in the 400s or 500s (maybe a little earlier in some areas).\n\nBut what is the Alsace wine route? And is it the same thing as the wine region?\n\nYes and no.\n\nThe Alsace wine region is the part of Alsace where we are allowed to farm grapes for wine making (and we also usually make our own wines too here).\n\nThe Alsace wine route is a line drawn through the Alsace wine region.\n\nKind of a connect the dots with the wine making villages.\n\nAnd it's about 170 km or 106 miles long from top to bottom.\n\nYou see, there is no one road called the wine route. We have some roads named \"wine road\" but they are not all connected up. And they have very little to do with the Alsace wine route or road.\n\nIf you get in your car and follow the Alsace wine route, you will zig zag your way up or down the Alsace wine region.\n\nJust to warn you, it's not a straight line.\n\nIn fact it's very crooked. You will have to make turns. And it's on mostly two-lane roads. So don't plan to do it in an afternoon.\n\nAnd be careful. You'll be sharing the road with other tourists.\n\nSome of them are more interested in getting that photo of a stork than paying attention. Or they already made a few stops at wine makers to sample and buy wine.\n\nOr they may be hopelessly lost and they're trying to figure out where their next turn is.\n\nPersonally my \"favorites\" are the camper vans going 25 kilometers per hour (16 mph).\n\nAlsace Villages Map: Where Are All the Cute Villages?\n\nThere are just too many Alsace villages to fit them all on a map.\n\nBut I did try to squeeze as many as I could. If you're interested in checking out some Alsace villages, you can go to these two completely different and more comprehensive guides on the subject.\n\nIs Alsace Worth Visiting?\n\nPersonally, after over 12 years of introducing Alsace to English speakers, I say yes.\n\nOf course I'm clearly biased.\n\nBut I would never recommend Alsace to someone if they wouldn't enjoy it. I'm just not that kind of person.\n\nAnd ultimately, it depends on what you love doing on vacation.\n\nDo you like history in general?\n\nYou'll love Alsace, because we have tons of stories from many different periods. World War One and World War Two for example. But also plenty of strange, amusing and sometimes sad stories from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution.\n\nDo you like to take photos?\n\nYou don't need any talent to take great photos in Alsace.\n\nIt's hard to take a bad photo here. Especially with all the new gadgets we have now. And I know where all the best spots are. I have at least a few thousand photos.\n\nDo you love white wine?\n\nOh boy, will you love Alsace. You may never want to leave. Not many wine regions produce exceptional white wines like we do.\n\nI've only just scratched the surface with the possibilities here in the region.\n\nAnd each of those questions could be the focus on your stay here.\n\nWhat is Alsace Famous for?\n\nIn each part of the world, Alsace is not always famous for the same things.\n\nIn Europe (and especially France), Alsace is known for its different food. It's the best place in France to get our very popular (and traditional) version of sauerkraut, for example.\n\nIt's quite different than any sauerkraut I've had anywhere else.\n\nOf course we have many different dishes here too.\n\nMany people can't help but fall in love with our beautiful and colorful 300-500 year old cottages and our window boxes filled with flowers.\n\nWe love to garden in Alsace and we can grow nearly any kind of flower.\n\nAnd you can't take a photo without flowers in it somewhere (except in winter of course).\n\nYou may have seen pictures of some of our Christmas markets too. We have a very old tradition of them here (over 500 years long).\n\nAnd it's not just the markets that are a big tradition.\n\nWe have celebrated Christmas in Alsace in our own unique way for much longer. Of course now we celebrate the Christmas season officially for nearly 5-6 weeks each year nowadays.\n\nAlsace is also famous for its wine.\n\nOf course we have a small wine region in France, so finding it in every shop in every country is just not possible.\n\nBut you might be able to find some of it in larger towns where you live.\n\nOf course our best wines (also known as our Terroir wines and our Grand Cru wines) are much harder to find outside of Alsace because they are produced in limited quantities.\n\nWhat Cities are in Alsace Lorraine?\n\nWell, the first thing to remember is that Alsace and Lorraine are two different regions.\n\nThere are moments in history where they have connections, But for the most part, Alsace and Lorraine are distinct regions with unique cultures, languages and histories.\n\nStrasbourg is the largest city in either region and has been the capital of Alsace for a very long time.\n\nThe largest city in Lorraine is Metz (named for a Celtic settlement before the Romans arrived).\n\nAfter Metz, the larger towns in Lorraine are Nancy, Epinal, and Bar le Duc.\n\nIn Alsace, the larger towns after Strasbourg are Mulhouse, Colmar, and Haguenau.\n\nOf course, please keep in mind that neither of these regions have many large towns. Strasbourg has nearly 300,000 people and Metz a little more than 100,000 people.\n\nIs Alsace German or French?\n\nAt the moment Alsace is in France.\n\nAnd we all hope it stays that way. I don't think anyone wants another major war here in Western Europe.\n\nBut it wasn't always like this.\n\nFrance and Germany (as well as the French Kingdom and the Holy Roman Empire) have not always had good relations. They've gone to war so many times.\n\nThe Franco Prussian War, the Thirty Years War, World War One and World War Two are just a few of the biggest or most recent wars.\n\nSo there have been times (and some very long periods of time) when Alsace was not French.\n\nIn fact Alsace spent most of its history as a part of the Holy Roman Empire (which was a Germanic empire).\n\nWhich Is Better Strasbourg or Colmar?\n\nOh my, this is probably the hardest question to answer.\n\nBecause each city is different. They don't look anything alike nowadays. You'll probably want to take hundreds of photos in either town (but for different reasons). Their historic monuments are quite different.\n\nFor example, Colmar doesn't have a cathedral.\n\nBut each Alsace city has some fantastic stories. You wouldn't believe some of the interesting things that happened in Strasbourg and Colmar.\n\nAnd both cities have plenty of shopping and great restaurants.\n\nIt ultimately comes down to what you enjoy doing the most. And what you are planning to do while you are in Alsace.\n\nFor example, if you are planning to drive in Alsace, I don't recommend either town as a place to stay. Parking and navigating in the historic areas of both cities is not a relaxing experience for most people.\n\nOr if the wine region is a very important part of your travel plans, Strasbourg is a little further away from most of the wine route.\n\nOf course there are many other advantages and disadvantages for choosing Colmar or Strasbourg as your place to stay in Alsace.\n\nAnd the best way to make a great decision is to know what you would love to do.\n\nIn any case, I hope you won't spend all your time in just Strasbourg or Colmar.\n\nAs great as both of these cities are, we have lots of equally wonderful villages and historic sites for you too.\n\nReady to Plan Your Next Trip to Alsace?\n\nNow that you know a little bit more about Alsace, are you ready to come see it for yourself?\n\nYou should have enough info to know if our adorable region is right for you. And of course this is where to fun begins.\n\nPlanning a trip to Alsace can be that thing you avoid doing for months or...\n\nThe most fun you've ever had.\n\nLet's make it as much fun as the trip itself. Looking at photos, reading about it, getting more and more excited as the days and weeks pass.\n\nI promise to do my part...\n\nWhat about you?"
