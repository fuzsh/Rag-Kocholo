        "text": "Alsace, part of the Grand Est region in northeastern France, is an area known for its adorable villes (cities) and villages. Reminiscent of fairy tales, a couple of the cute towns are said to have inspired the setting for Walt Disney’s classic film Beauty and the Beast.\n\nThe area has been shaped by its shared heritage between France and Germany, having been ruled alternatively by both countries since the Middle Ages. Thanks to this dual heritage, the towns and villages in Alsace share certain culture traits, distinct from other regions in France: charming Christmas markets, hearty German-style cuisine, and beautiful half-timbered architecture.\n\nUnique in France, Alsace has retained some of the laws it held under German rule. It is the only area where laïcité, the formal separation of church and state, does not apply, and it has some extra holidays that are not days off elsewhere in France, like the Second Day of Christmas on 26 December.\n\nAnd the region has its own dialect, Alsatian, a mix of French and German languages. The first Alsatian phrase I learned was “Jetzt geht's los” (pronounced yets gets loss), which is the club motto for Strasbourg’s soccer team, RC Racing, and roughly translates to “Let’s go!” Unfortunately, the number of Alsatian speakers is on the decline, though it has been reintroduced in schools and on bilingual street signs in cities like Strasbourg to hopefully keep the dialect alive.\n\nAfter living in beautiful Strasbourg (capital of Alsace and the Grand Est region) during my France sabbatical year and revisiting the area often with my Frenchman, I’ve had the opportunity to visit many of the other charming towns and cites in Alsace.\n\nSince the French choose their favourite village every year with the televised competition series Le Village préféré des Français, I’m ranking them as I visit them. Like the TV show, my list is just for fun.\n\nThe Cutest Towns & Small Cities in Alsace—Ranked!\n\n9. Obernai\n\nPopulation: 12 100\n\nKnown for: The Kronenbourg Brewery\n\nThis is a tough little village. Its whole population died after two wars and the plague in the 17th and 18th centuries, and it was repopulated by Swiss, German, Hungarian, Austrian, and Romanian immigrants.\n\nBergheim has the colourful half-timbered buildings that the region is known for and won “Village préféré des Français” in 2022. Porte Haute, the western gate, has a cheeky engraving of a medieval man evading arrest. At a public park just outside the gate, a big tilia platyphyllos tree (large-leaved lime) was planted in 1313 and is recorded as the oldest tree in the Haut-Rhin department. It’s so old it’s being held up by support beams.\n\nThis cute village’s medieval fortifications, particularly those on its northern side, are perhaps the best in Alsace. The rectangular town is surrounded by these stone walls, and my favourite view is from the Rue de Remparts in the north. From that little street, one can see the impressive Château du Haut-Koenigsbourg resting high on a mountain in the Vosges range.\n\nVisitors should also check out the Witches’ House (Maison des Sorcières) museum near the church. This little building holds records relating to the women in Bergheim who were tortured and burned at the stake (not cute) for alleged acts of witchcraft.\n\n7. Sélestat\n\nPopulation: 19 300\n\nHighlight: The Humanist Library\n\nSélestat is located in central Alsace, between the two largest cities of Strasbourg and Mulhouse. The city acts as a hub when travelling by bus and train in the region. It’s on the Alsace Plains, a narrow fertile stretch between the Rhine river and Vosges mountains. Here, the Ill river, flowing parallel to the Rhine, crosses Sélestat and floods the area regularly.\n\nVisitors should go to the Humanist Library (La Bibliothèque Humaniste) in a former grain market, a pink sandstone building. Inside, it houses a collection of old medieval manuscripts and Renaissance books, many of which were bequeathed to the city by German humanist and religious reformer Beatus Rhenanus. The oldest book, a cute leather-bound manuscript, was published in the 7th century.\n\nA cultural highlight the annual Corso Fleuri parade. The event is a magnificent kilometres-long flower procession that takes place on the second Sunday of August. The stunning display features countless floats covered in vibrant and fragrant blooms, filling the streets with an enchanting aroma.\n\n6. Colmar\n\nPopulation: 70 300\n\nHighlight: Its “Little Venice” neighbourhood\n\nRiquewihr has been recognized as one of the “Plus beaux villages” (most beautiful towns) in France, a designation given to towns and villages with a population of less than 2000 with multiple protected historic monuments or sites or heritage sites.\n\nIt hasn’t changed much since its medieval days. The small village is situated between the Vosges mountains and the Alsace Plains. Great grapes have always grown here, including some Grand Cru (the most superior quality) vineyards today.\n\nThanks to this history of viniculture, the village got rich from trading wine and was able to build a double-fortification wall. The inner wall was constructed in 1291 and the outer in 1500. A (reproduction) engraved map that shows Riquewihr and its fortifications from 1644 is located at the main gate near city hall (la mairie).\n\nVisitors can walk along the Rue des Remparts, starting at the High Gate (Porte Haute) to admire these old walls. Another highlight is the impressive “skyscraper” yellow and brown building on Rue du Général de Gaulle. It’s one of the tallest of these timbered buildings in Alsace and worth a look.\n\n4. Ribeauvillé\n\nPopulation: 4800\n\nHighlight: Its three castles\n\nRibeauvillé and Riquewihr have been identified as the inspirational setting for Disney’s Beauty and the Beast, the “quiet village” where Belle lives. Certainly, the enchanting castle ruins that sit atop the hillside make Ribeauvillé feel like a fairy tale town.\n\nAfter strolling through the village, the hike (a 6-7 kilometres loop) to the three castles is a must for visitors. Starting partly along the stone fortifications, the walk zig-zags through the forest to reach the first ruins, Château de Saint-Ulrich. It continues to Château du Girsberg and Château du Haut-Ribeaupierre, though the latter is closed to visitors for safety reasons.\n\nA detour to Kahlfelsen Rock, just past the three castle ruins, is worth it for the viewpoint. This cute Alsatian town looks even better from above, looking out over the clay tiles roofs and farmland on the plains.\n\nI stayed a week at a homestay in Munster, a village situated in a Vosges valley, and had the opportunity to explore the town and its surrounds in early summer, so I got to see how special and perhaps underrated this town is.\n\nThere are lots of fun things to see and do in Munster, including the “Path of Poets” walk around the city. Over two hours, visitors pass by top sites while reading numbered plaques with poems and information about historical figures. Most of the plaques have Alsatian translations, helping to support the local language.\n\nWithin town, the pink sandstone Protestant church and the well-kept ruins of the old Benedictine Abbey (closed in 1791) are cute architectural highlights. But, as usual, one of my favourite views is from above. Up a steep but short path from town, Madman Rock (Rocher du fou) offers a beautiful vista of Munster and the surrounding mountains.\n\n2. Kaysersberg\n\nPopulation: 4700\n\nHighlight: The Château de Kaysersberg\n\nKaysersberg (full name: Kaysersberg-Vignoble) was voted Village préféré des Français in 2017 and it is easy to see why. It has winding, narrow cobblestone streets and colourful half-timbered buildings common in the region, but the shallow Weiss river that passes through town ups the charm factor.\n\nKaysersberg was the birthplace of Albert Schweitzer, whose personal philosophy of \"reverence for life\" and tireless humanitarian work that put this into action earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952. The town now has the Centre Schweitzer, an interpretive centre/museum (closed for renovations until August 2023) dedicated to his messages of peace.\n\nVisitors can hike up to the Château de Kaysersberg, a mostly granite castle that was built in 1220. It has been designated as a historical monument since 1841. After climbing 122 steps to the top of the circular keep, you can see a panorama of the town and its surrounding vineyards.\n\n1. Hunspach\n\nPopulation: 640\n\nHighlight: Its white and dark-brown timbered farm houses\n\nHunspach has earned two designations: it is one of the Plus beaux villages de France and was voted Village préféré des Français in 2020. This very small farming village north of Strasbourg is unique from other Alsatian villages in that its timbered buildings are all white. But don’t worry—bright geraniums and charming window decorations add pops of colour everywhere.\n\nThe shape of the buildings sets it apart, too, because many of the houses still have the traditional open central yards and attached farm building. Most of the population still works in agriculture, and its not uncommon to see locals using horses as transportation.\n\nThis town is also special because it doesn’t have much in terms of tourist services, like B&Bs or restaurants—it seems to have one of each—or things to see and do. This is a place to simply wander around and enjoy, just because.\n\nVisitors can, however, check out a few interesting sites nearby. Schoenenbourg Fort, the most important Maginot Line fortification in Alsace, was bombed heavily in the second World War, and it is open to tourists. The newly constructed Chemin des cimes de l’Alsace verte (which translates to “Path of Alsace’s green peaks”) is a nearly 100-foot tall observation tower with 360° views of the surrounding forest. Visitors climb an elevated wooden interpretive trail to get to the top, then can either slide (my choice) or walk back down.\n\nMap of the Cutest Towns & Cities in Alsace"
