        "text": "You’re probably more familiar with seeing photos of Colmar at Christmas, with the huge street decorations, oversized teddies adorning houses and the the twinkling lights of the Christmas market.\n\nColmar has become hugely popular over recent years and is now one of the must-see destinations when visiting the Alsace region of France. But of course that popularity has also made it more expensive during the peak seasons over Christmas and also in the spring/early summer when the already colourful town comes into full bloom, so you might be wondering when is the best time to visit Colmar.\n\nWhen is the best time to visit Colmar, France\n\nI chose to visit Colmar in the off season - late February/early March. It was very cold and Europe was experiencing the ‘Beast from the East’ so I was actually lucky enough to get snow while I was there! At this time the town was very quiet, there were still a few tourists but nowhere near as many, I was able to take pictures without crowds in, eat at the best restaurants without making reservations and get cheap flights and accommodation.\n\nFlights - £61 Return from Gatwick to Basel\n\nAccommodation - £64 euros for my own room and bathroom at IBIS Colmar Centre\n\nTotal for flights and accommodation = £125\n\nOf course if you’re wanting to visit to see the town during Christmas market time, or to see it in bloom then travelling at those peak times are unavoidable. But if you just want to see this quaint colourful town or maybe as part of a larger trip around the Alsace and Strasbourg area, then I definitely recommend travelling in the off-season or shoulder seasons.\n\nYou can read my post on how to get to Colmar here.\n\nLa Petite Venise\n\nCalled Little Venice for it’s place along the river, this is probably the most famous photo location in Colmar. The road is called Quai de la Poissonnerie and you can find the bridge these photos are taken from where the road meets Rue des Écoles. I would recommend going here early in the day as it is a popular spot and also remember these are actually people’s houses - they don’t want to find a full photography session on their doorstep when they’re trying to go about their day.\n\nWalk to the other end of this row of houses for a different perspective and to get the curve in the street.\n\nAlthough this looks like a public square, it isn’t labeled as one on the map. You can find this area where Rue des Marchands and Grand Rue meet. To get this view there are some stone steps you can climb and get this angle from above. The restaurant on the left in the photo is called Le Fer Rouge; I had a wonderful meal here with red wine for 35 euros.\n\nYou might be forgiven for not recognising this location! It is well-photographed on Instagram when it is completely covered in Christmas decorations.\n\nUnfortunately when I visited there was a lot of building work in front of it so I couldn’t get the shot I wanted, but the location is just down the Grand Rue from the last shot. Where Grand Rue meets Place de l’Ancienne Douane and Rue Basque.\n\nThe second photo above is the buildings just to the left of the pink house, remember to look up in Colmar, there are so many colourful and beautifully detailed facades.\n\nSo technically this isn’t Colmar, Equisheim is a medieval village southwest of Colmar and can be reached easily in 14 minutes by car/taxi or you can do what I did and rent a bike to cycle along the scenic river and country fields to reach it (it was very cold when I did this in Feb/March so just be cautious if roads are slippy!).\n\nEguisheim isn’t huge, there isn’t a lot to see and do but it is worth visiting this beautiful, colourful town if you can! This is the most well-photographed street in the village and it’s called Rue du Rempart S. You’ll most likely come into the village on Grand Rue, if you do, it’s the second street on your left.\n\nTake some time to wander around Eguisheim, it’s only small so it’s easy to do in an afternoon. Here are some of my favourite snaps from there."
