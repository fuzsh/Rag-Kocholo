        "text": "We were drawn to Colmar, France by colorful photographs depicting fanciful scenes of half-timbered houses and quaint canals. The weaving cobblestone lanes in the Old Town and cheerful Little Venice seemed to be plucked straight from a fairytale.\n\nNow that we’ve been, we can attest to the fact that Colmar is as pretty as a postcard. Maybe even prettier. We planned three full days of our Alsace Itinerary here, which allowed us plenty of time to experience the Best Things To Do in Colmar, France!\n\nTop Colmar, France Things To Do\n\nOur recommendations include city exploration, learning a bit of history, getting out in nature and savoring the cuisine. Visitors can plan their best trip to Colmar using our list of fun activities!\n\nTop Tip: At the end of the article, we include a helpful Colmar sightseeing map.\n\n#1 Explore Colmar Old Town\n\nTravelers wondering what to do in Colmar, France should start their discovery in the Old Town. No question about it, Old Town Colmar is the highlight of the city – and there are several ways to explore it.\n\nYou can wander aimlessly, find sights by using a Colmar tourist map, ride the Tourist Train or follow the Tourist Trail. Additionally, those who want to learn about the city from a local guide can book a 1-hour guided Colmar Walking Tour.\n\nTourist Trail to Colmar Attractions\n\nFor our first stroll through town, we opted to follow the Tourist Trail, which serves as a Self-Guided Colmar Walking Tour. The signposted route leads visitors on a 3.75 mile loop (estimated time: 2.5 hours) featuring the best places to visit in Colmar, France.\n\nThe trail is outlined on the free Colmar Old Town Map from the tourist office. To be honest – it really wasn’t necessary. Simply follow the golden triangles (embossed with Lady Liberty) to top Colmar sights. Each attraction features a sign (in French and English) with relevant information.\n\nPlaces To Visit in Colmar\n\nWe believe following the Colmar free walking tour trail is an ideal way to get acquainted with the city. However, for those preferring to ramble on their own, there are a few Colmar things to see that shouldn’t be missed. We recommend putting the following sights on your Colmar to-do list!\n\nLittle Venice\n\nLittle Venice in Colmar (La Petite Venise) is the most attractive part of the Old Town. Strolling through the district is one of the top things to do Colmar, France. The narrow and shallow Lauch River flows past brightly painted houses and under arching bridges.\n\nThe district is a must see in Colmar and it’s easy to tour on foot. However, taking a Colmar Canal Tour is a unique way to see the impeccably decorated homes along the river!\n\nSaint Martin Church\n\nThe impressive spire of St. Martin’s Church (Collegiale Saint-Martin) can be seen from many points around town, but it’s worth a look up close. Visitors will want to see both the ornate façade and the incredibly decorated interior. Not to be missed is the 13th century stained glass window in the nave featuring a beardless Christ.\n\nPfister House\n\nBuilt in 1537, the lavishly decorated Renaissance-style Pfister House (Maison Pfister) is a must-see in Colmar. Sitting along the charming Rue des Marchands, it features paintings from the Bible, as well as German emperors.\n\nHouse of Heads\n\nThe House of Heads (Maison de Tetes) is another one of the Colmar top attractions. Dating to 1609, the façade is decorated with more than 100 sculptures peering down at the onlookers. It’s a sight to behold!\n\nCustoms House\n\nOnce the center of business and politics, the Old Customs House (called Koifhus or ancienne douane) was built in 1480. The ground floor served as a warehouse, market and customs office for hundreds of years.\n\nCovered Market Hall\n\nThe beautiful brick and wooden Colmar Market Hall building dates to 1865. Perusing the goods at the Marché Couvert is one of the fun things to do in Colmar. In fact, it’s a great place to assemble items for a picnic!\n\nTanner’s District\n\nThe Tanner’s District (Quartier des Tanneurs) dates to the 17th and 18th centuries. It is where tanners (people who tan animal hides) lived. Their tall, half timbered houses were designed to allow animal pelts to hang and dry in the open air. No longer the case, the entire district is a Colmar must see sight!\n\nFishmonger’s District\n\nOnce home to fishermen, the Fishmonger’s District features a colorful rainbow of half-timbered houses along the Lauch River on Quai de la Poissonnerie. We think this is the prettiest street in Colmar!\n\nGrand Rue\n\nLovely and inviting, Grand Rue is the main street in town. Strolling the length of the cobblestone thoroughfare is, without a doubt, one of the best Colmar, France things to do!\n\n#2 Hike Through Colmar Vineyards\n\nColmar – and dozens of other smaller towns – are situated along the foothills of the Vosges Mountains. The stunning vineyard and hillside landscapes beg to be discovered on day trips from Colmar. What better way to explore the regional highlights than on a hike? It’s one of the best things to do around Colmar!\n\nUsing the public bus and our own two feet, we were able to visit more of the must see Alsace Region on a Wine Walk.\n\nPro Tip: Drivers can visit many of the quaint towns, which are linked together on the Alsace Wine Route. However, we believe trekking from village to village is part of the charm of Colmar!\n\nAlsatian Wine Route Walk\n\nNorth of Colmar, the towns of Riquewihr, Hunawihr and Ribeauville are nestled along the Vosges among hillside vineyards. Each of these historic towns boast a cluster of half-timbered houses and a church with a rising bell tower.\n\nThe three towns are connected by a 3 mile path – allowing those without a car to take a hike through alluring Alsace vineyards.\n\nRiquewihr\n\nMid-morning, we took a public bus from Colmar to Riquewihr. We walked the central cobblestone lane, stopping at Au Petite Delice for unbelievably delicious chocolate macaroons. Then we diverted onto charming Riquewihr side streets.\n\nWe exited town through the Thieves’ Tower and set off on our jaunt through the vineyards of Alsace. The path – which is also used by bikes and a few cars – steadily inclined through a forest and plateaued just above the town of Hunawihr.\n\nHunawihr\n\nFrom Hunawihr, we followed the path through budding vineyards, stopping often to take photos and enjoy the view. We found a picnic table under the shade of a tree where we ate our packed lunch (and macaroons) with a view. As we completed our easy trek to Ribeauville, we could see hill-topping castles perched above the town.\n\nRibeauville\n\nRibeauville, which is the largest of the three Alsace Wine Walk towns, is home to several winery tasting rooms. After our walk through the vineyards, we naturally rewarded ourselves with a taste of the local product! Much busier than the two previous towns, we casually strolled and sipped our way through Ribeauville before catching a bus back to Colmar.\n\nTips for Walking from Riquewihr to Ribeauville\n\nBuses conveniently transport passengers from Colmar to Riquewihr and back. Request a schedule from the Colmar Tourist Info Office – and ask which buses are running on the day of your trip. Not all buses run year-round or all days of the week and there are none on Sundays.\n\nIn Riquewihr, stop at the Tourist Office (located on the main street) for an Alsace Wine Walking Map. While at the TI, also pick up informative pamphlets on the towns, if you are interested in learning more about the sights. From Ribeauville, it is possible to continue hiking to the castle ruins in the hills above town, which takes about an hour each direction.\n\nPro Tip: Those who would prefer a guided tour of the Wine Route in Alsace should consider this popular excursion.\n\n#3 Bike to Eguisheim, France\n\nDay trips from Colmar, France are not limited to public transportation – Eguisheim can be reached by bicycle. We pedaled our way from the Colmar Train Station along the river, through open fields to Eguisheim, another popular historic town in Alsace.\n\nIt took less than an hour for us to navigate the route from Colmar to Eguisheim – and we stopped often to take photos. Once we arrived in Eguisheim, we locked up our bikes (just around the corner from the Tourist Info Office) and set off to explore.\n\nAt the center of the Medieval village, which was awarded the ‘Favorite French Town’, is the Chateau Saint-Leon. From the central square (that the castle sits on), three ring roads encircle the town. We lazily looped around Eguisheim on foot, marveling at the architecture and reading about the history on the informational plaques.\n\nTop Tips for Biking in Colmar\n\nBiking is one of the popular Colmar activities and there are a few places to rent bikes in the city. We rented our bikes from Colmar Velo – Velodocteurs, which is located at the train station. Ask for a free Colmar Cycling Map, and if you are biking to Eguisheim, inquire about the ideal route.\n\n#4 Dine al Fresco in Colmar\n\nDuring our Colmar visit, the weather was incredible – sunny skies, but not hot. It was perfect for dining al fresco! Throughout the Old Town, there are numerous Colmar restaurants that offer outdoor seating and feature local Alsace cuisine.\n\nRestaurants in Colmar\n\nThere are many incredible Colmar, France restaurants that feature local cuisine and international fare. We have a few tips for where to eat in Colmar.\n\nWistub Brenner\n\nA classic and cozy restaurant, Wistub Brenner focuses on traditional Alsatian food that is perfectly presented. The menu features 3-course meal options. Highlights are the pork knuckle and foie gras – but save room for the delectable desserts!\n\nLa Caveau Saint Pierre\n\nHoused in a quaint half-timbered house along the canal, Caveau Sant Pierre serves traditional French cuisine. The authentic meals are exquisitely prepared and offered at fair prices.\n\nJY’s\n\nSituated in the Champ du Mars park, JY’s is a fine dining restaurant (with two Michelin stars). Patrons can expect exceptional service and phenomenal French fare.\n\nHave a Picnic\n\nVisitors who want to experience something different can prepare a fun picnic lunch – like we did! In the morning, we went to the Covered Market Halle, gathering items for an afternoon picnic at Parc du Champ de Mars. At the shops, we found some of the best food in Colmar. We went with Munster cheese with cumin spice, freshly baked baguettes and almond-stuffed olives!\n\nPro Tip: The Covered Market Halle has several restaurants where you can dine before you shop. We started off with a quiche and fresh-squeezed orange juice at the small café in the center.\n\n#5 Sip Alsace Wine and French Craft Beer\n\nBeing smack in the middle of the Alsace Wine Region, drinking the locally produced wine should be on every Colmar itinerary!\n\nAlsatian Wine\n\nMost of the wine in Alsace is white, including varietals such as Riesling, Muscat, Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer. Pinot Noir is the sole red wine in Alsace. However, it is quite light in comparison to some other Pinot Noirs.\n\nLocal French wine is available at every café, restaurant and grocery store in Colmar. After long days of sightseeing, relaxing at a café in the Colmar Old Town and sipping Alsace wine was sublime!\n\nPro Tip: If you are planning to bring a few bottles home (who could resist?), make sure you pack your wine properly so it arrives safely!\n\nCraft Beer\n\nBeer drinkers, don’t despair. While wine is certainly the most popular drink of choice in Colmar, they have French Craft Beer as well!\n\nOur go-to spot for craft beer in Colmar is Les 3 Singes (The Three Monkeys). They offer a wide drink selection in a friendly atmosphere. There is one local craft brewery in Colmar, Brasserie St. Cru, which is located 2.5 miles north of the Old Town.\n\nAlsace Wine Tour\n\nWhile it is fun to stop into different bars and restaurants, those interested in learning more about the wine in Colmar can join a guided tour through the Alsace region. Both Full-Day and Half-Day wine tours are available where participants enjoy tastings, the scenery and the company of fellow travelers!\n\nMore Tips For Visiting Colmar, France\n\nWe have more advice for visiting Colmar and the Alsace Region – including day trips, where to stay, how to get there and our best packing hacks!\n\nDay Tours From Colmar\n\nThe city makes a great base for exploring the Alsace Region.

Although, even the fastest trains take 3.5 hours – so it is a really long day.\n\nThe train between Strasbourg and Colmar takes just 30 minutes. By train, the journey from Freiburg to Colmar takes about 2 hours to complete.\n\nBefore You Go to Colmar\n\nWe have a few final travel tips on what to pack in your suitcase or backpack. So grab our FREE Packing Checklist and let’s get you on your way to France!\n\nWalking Shoes\n\nColmar is a walkable city…but only if you have the right travel shoes! Don’t forget to pack a pair of lightweight and comfortable shoes. I wore my favorite trainers by New Balance and Kris prefers trail shoes by Merrell.\n\nTravel Camera\n\nWe’re certain you’ll be snapping tons of photos during your France trip. Rather than relying on your phone to capture the sights, upgrade to an actual travel camera for high quality photos. We travel with a Canon Rebel, which takes beautiful pictures and is an excellent budget camera option.\n\nGuidebook\n\nThose interested in the best Colmar wines can use the Wines of Alsace guide for the top vineyards of the region. Exploring more of France? Make sure to have a trusted guidebook before arriving.\n\nDay Pack\n\nWith long days of sightseeing, you will want to make sure you bring a travel day bag. An ideal day pack is comfortable to carry, has multiple pockets and can fit all your everyday items for travel.\n\nEuropean Travel Insurance\n\nIf you haven’t already obtained coverage for your vacation to France, consider traveling protected with World Nomads.\n\nStart planning your trip to France!
