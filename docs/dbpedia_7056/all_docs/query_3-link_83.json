        "text": "A year ago, in spring of 2023, I made an all too brief stop in the enchanting town of Colmar, France. The stop was a half-day excursion as part of a Rhine river cruise. While the visit was not long enough to experience all that Colmar has to offer, it did allow me to get a glimpse into the city’s history, culture, and beauty. And, as so often happens on a river cruise, it showed me that this is a place deserving of a longer visit in the future.\n\nColmar is part of the Alsace region of France, just across the border from Germany. It has a blend of German and French style in its architecture, culture, and cuisine. It also has a interesting history – from its medieval old town to the WWII battles that took place here. History buffs may know that Audie Murphy earned his Medal of Honor in the Colmar battle and there is a memorial to his efforts nearby.\n\nSome highlights from my short visit to Colmar:\n\nStorks have been nesting in this region for centuries as part of their migration pattern from Africa. They build nests at high points in the city – tree tops, roofs, and church towers. They are considered good luck (as well as fertility symbols). Storks are everywhere in Colmar – the real ones, toy ones, and even chocolate storks!\n\nHalf-timbered houses are a prominent feature of the historic old town. This can be explained by the fact the nearby forests provided plenty of wood for building. The old-world homes are colorful and give the old town its unique style."
