        "text": "Ever wondered what it is like to step into a real-life fairy tale? Picture this: cobblestone streets that wind through storybook houses, charming canals that reflect a world of wonders and a town that inspired the enchanting setting of Howl’s Moving Castle. Our adventure took us to Colmar, the very place that sparked the magic behind the Ghibli movie. My personal favourite Ghibli movie.\n\nColmar is like a fairy tale come true – I was so excited to visit the city with my little sister. It felt as though we were characters in the movie, wandering through an animated wonderland. Every corner of the Old Town in Colmar reminded me of Howl and Sophie.\n\nHere are some highlights and typical things that make this picturesque town truly special:\n\nHalf-Timbered Houses\n\nThe town is renowned for its charming half-timbered houses, each painted in an array of vibrant hues. These houses transport you into a fairy tale world as you wander through the cobbled streets.\n\nQuaint Cafés and Restaurants\n\nColmar’s culinary scene is a treat for the senses. Delight in traditional Alsatian cuisine, savoring dishes like Flammkuchen (a thin, crispy pizza with onion and bacon) and choucroute (sauerkraut and sausages), often paired with local wines.\n\nMaison Pfister\n\nA remarkable example of German Renaissance architecture, the Maison Pfister features ornate facades and intricate detailing that speak to the town’s historical significance. In a particular part of Hayao Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving Castle, we can clearly see Maison Pfister.\n\nAu Vieux Pignon\n\nThis charming building with its distinct sloping roof is a quintessential representation of Alsace architecture, adding to the town’s visual charm.\n\nKoifhus\n\nA centuries-old customs house, Koifhus stands as a testament to Colmar’s role as a medieval trading hub. Its stunning architecture and historical importance make it a must-visit.\n\nMuseum Unterlinden\n\nHoused in a former convent, this museum is a treasure trove of art and history. Its centerpiece is Matthias Grünewald’s masterpiece, the Isenheim Altarpiece, an exquisite example of Northern Renaissance art. PS. the garden is like a direct reminder of Hogwarts!\n\nCollegiale Saint-Martin\n\nThis stunning Gothic church is a marvel of architecture, with its intricate details and soaring spires. The interior is equally impressive, featuring remarkable stained glass windows.\n\nLittle Venice\n\nColmar’s “Little Venice” district features picturesque canals lined with these whimsical houses, creating a scene reminiscent of its Italian namesake. Taking a boat ride along these canals is a quintessential Colmar experience :)\n\nQuai de la Poissonnerie\n\nThis riverside promenade offers a captivating view of the canals, half-timbered houses and flower-lined pathways, making it an ideal spot for leisurely strolls and photography.\n\nMaison des Têtes\n\nA Renaissance-style building adorned with intricate sculptures of heads, animals and foliage, showcasing the artistic heritage of the region.\n\nChristmas Markets\n\nMake sure to visit Colmar at the end of the year when the town transforms into a winter wonderland during the festive season. Colmar’s Christmas markets are renowned for their festive atmosphere, offering handmade crafts, seasonal treats and warm mulled wine.\n\nTransfer from Switzerland\n\nDirect train from Basel to Colmar\n\nPrice: 15,80 € (one-way)\n\nDuration: approx. 45min"
