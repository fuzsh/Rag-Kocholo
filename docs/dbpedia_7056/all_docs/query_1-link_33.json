        "text": "Horticultural & Botanical History\n\n‘A highly esteemed pear of ancient and probably Belgian origin. Merlet mentions it in 1690 and La Quintinye in 1730.’ [Pears of New York p.341].\n\nA very old pear from France, raised before 1690, at which time it was described by Merlet as the newest and rarest in France. [Gard. Chron. 1860]. Figured in Pomona Britannica [PB pl.LXXXII/1812] and Saint-Hilaire [pl.89/1828], the illustration used here.\n\nHistory at Camden Park\n\nListed in the 1845 catalogue as ‘Passe Colmar’, and in 1850 and 1857 as ‘Colmar’ [Pear no.12/1845]. These are different pears. It seems likely that ‘Colmar’ was intended but both have been included in the Hortus. There is no diary entry for this pear.\n\nNotes"
