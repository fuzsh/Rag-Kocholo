        "text": "Wondering if Colmar is worth visiting?\n\nFrom colorful timber-framed houses to enthralling museums, there are tons of reasons why Colmar should be on your list.\n\nIn fact, since moving to France, I’ve been to Colmar dozens of times. That’s how much I love this little Alsatian village. And, today, I want to share with you what makes it so special. I’ll cover all the reasons why you should visit Colmar as well as tips to help you plan your trip.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIs Colmar Worth Visiting?\n\n19 Reasons to Visit Colmar\n\nFAQs About Visiting Colmar\n\nConclusion: Is Colmar Worth Visiting?\n\nIs Colmar Worth Visiting?\n\nYes, Colmar is definitely worth visiting!\n\nWith so many things to do, Colmar is the perfect destination if you’ve never been before.\n\nIt lies in the ever-magnificent region of Alsace and is famed for its fairytale-like atmosphere.\n\nHere you’ll find narrow cobbled streets lined with pastel-hued buildings, each of which is decorated with vivid flowers.\n\nBut that’s not all!\n\nColmar is also home to fascinating museums like the Unterlinded Museum. It even has a replica of the Statue of Liberty. There’s tons of green space and it’s not far from the infamous Alsace Wine Route. And, during the holiday season, Colmar transforms into a winter wonderland and hosts one of the best Christmas markets in France.\n\nNeedless to say, it’s the perfect addition to your next France itinerary.\n\n19 Reasons to Visit Colmar\n\nThere’s no shortage of reasons why you should visit this wonderful city. So, I’ve compiled a comprehensive list to help you decide if Colmar should be your next destination.\n\nBy the end, I can guarantee you’ll be adding it to your bucket list.\n\n1. Picturesque Half-Timbered Houses\n\nColmar’s biggest tourist attraction is, undoubtedly, its picturesque half-timbered houses. Each is a different color than the next. And, in summer, their windowsills and doorframes are decorated with vibrant bouquets.\n\nSome of the most gorgeous buildings are along Quai de la Poissonnerie. And, while it might look like a tourist attraction, it’s far more than that. In fact, these colors were once used to identify the inhabitants.\n\nIf the building was residential, blue showed that the household was Catholic while red was Protestant. If the building was commercial, the color represented the type of store.\n\nWhile these designations disappeared after the 18th century, residents continue to paint their houses in different colors. They must, however, have it approved by City Hall beforehand.\n\n2. Tons of Museums\n\nColmar is home to several fascinating museums.\n\nIn fact, there are so many it’s hard to choose which ones to add to your itinerary.\n\nBelow I’ve listed the best museums to visit in Colmar:\n\nUnterlinden Museum – This renowned museum houses an impressive collection of exhibits. The most notable is the Isenheim Altarpiece by Matthias Grünewald. Not only that but it’s the most visited museum in Alsace!\n\nBartholdi Museum – Dedicated to the creator of the Statue of Liberty, Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, this museum showcases his life and work.\n\nToy Museum (Musée du Jouet) – Colmar’s Toy Museum is a vast collection of toys and games from various eras. If you love reminiscing about your childhood, this is the place for you!\n\n3. Alsace Wine Route\n\nThe Alsace Wine Route is a must-visit for wine lovers and outdoor enthusiasts alike. Spanning 170 kilometers (105 miles), it winds through the rolling hills and picturesque vineyards. It’s here that some of France’s finest white wines are made!\n\nAnd Colmar is right in the middle of the Alsace Wine Route.\n\nRent a bike and cycle between towns, travel by car, or walk. There’s no wrong way to do it!\n\nIn fact, it’s one of the most common routes to take when traveling to Colmar from Strasbourg!\n\n4. Indulgent Cuisine\n\nColmar’s traditional cuisine is a tantalizing mix of French and German influences. From savory sausages to sweet treats, there’s something for everyone here.\n\nSome of the most famous dishes include tarte flambée, choucroute garnie, and kugelhopf. And a trip to Colmar wouldn’t be complete without sampling at least one of these.\n\nBelow is a list of the best restaurants where you can sample traditional Alsatian delicacies:\n\nLa Kilbe\n\nLes Bateliers\n\nLa Cocotte de Grand-Mère\n\nBrasserie des Tanneurs\n\n5. Excellent Guided Tours\n\nColmar is rooted in its rich cultural heritage and, while it might be small, there are a ton of things to see and do. Not only that but it’s close to many other attractions in the area.\n\nAnd, if you’re visiting Colmar or even Alsace for the first time, you might not know where to begin. Luckily, there are a ton of informative and enjoyable guided tours available.\n\nFrom historical excursions around Colmar to day trips to other Alsatian villages, there are options for every kind of traveler.\n\nBest of all, you won’t have to worry about navigating small towns, narrow roads, or a foreign language. You’ll be able to sit back, relax, and enjoy your hard-earned vacation.\n\n6. Little Venice\n\nThis charming neighborhood features beautiful canals lined with stunning medieval buildings. In fact, it’s reminiscent of its Italian namesake.\n\nStroll along the waterways and admire the architecture, stop by an artisanal shop, or enjoy a glass of wine on a terrace.\n\nMy favorite was the gondola ride. You’ll paddle along the Lauch River while gazing at the picturesque scenery. It’s a unique view of the city that you wouldn’t see otherwise. And, as a bonus, your guide details the fascinating history of Colmar. It’s perfect for history lovers and vacation goers alike!\n\n7. Colmar’s Christmas Market\n\nSpanning from late November through December, Colmar’s annual Christmas Market is a festive affair not to be missed!\n\nThis immersive experience is much like the original markets. The town is full of lights, decorations, and vendors selling handcrafted gifts in wooden chalets. It’s a magical winter wonderland that makes you feel like you’re in a fairytale.\n\nOf the Christmas markets I’ve been to, Colmar was the most beautiful.\n\n8. Unique Architecture\n\nThere’s no denying that Colmar has some of the prettiest streets in the region, if not the country.\n\nIn fact, tourists flock from all over the world to catch a glimpse of these colorful buildings.\n\nBut that’s not all there is to see.\n\nColmar actually has a lot of very quirky architecture.\n\nBelow are some of the coolest buildings in town:\n\nLa Maison des Tetes – This narrowly tall building stands out because it’s covered in small human heads (that are made of stone). Then, if you look carefully, you can see the windows are not the same size. While you can’t tour the interior, it’s worth stopping by!\n\nMaison Pfister – This iconic 16th-century Renaissance-style building features intricate wood carvings and unique bay windows. Wooden panels are painted with different scenes, the details of which are nothing shy of impressive.\n\nKoïfhus or Old Custom House – This historic building, once an important center for trade and politics, now hosts cultural events. Its most notable feature is, undoubtedly, the ceramic roof tiles. They are analogous to patterns found in Dijon and other parts of Burgundy.\n\n9. Perfect for Day Trips\n\nColmar’s location near the border of Germany and Switzerland makes it an ideal base for taking day trips. Whether you want to explore the greater Alsace region or wander around the Black Forest, you’ll be able to do so from here. That’s how well this little town is connected.\n\nSome of the most popular day trips from Colmar include Strasbourg, Eguisheim, Kaysersberg, and Riquewhir.\n\nBut did you know that you can also take the train to Dijon for a day in Burgundy? You could even go as far as Luxembourg or Paris!\n\n10. Covered Market\n\nIf there is one thing I love about France, it’s its markets. And Colmar doesn’t disappoint.\n\nLocated in the town center the Marché Couvert Colmar offers a variety of local products, such as cheese, charcuterie, and fresh produce. There’s even a restaurant in the back, La Terrasse du Marché, that serves the best tarte flambée in town!\n\nStop by to explore the stands or buy a souvenir!\n\n11. Parc du Champ de Mars\n\nThe Parc du Champ de Mars is a gorgeous public park located in the heart of Colmar. From the picturesque scenery to the relaxing environment, it’s the perfect spot to spend a sunny afternoon. It’s also the largest park in town!\n\nStroll along the covered walkways or picnic in the grassed areas, you won’t find a better place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\n12. Easy to Access\n\nOne of the best reasons to visit Colmar is because it’s so easy to get to.\n\nIt’s located in eastern France near Germany and Switzerland. That means you can get to Colmar by car, train, or plane. Whether you’re coming from nearby Strasbourg or are flying from the United States, you won’t have any problems getting here.\n\nThe nearest airports are:\n\nFrankfurt Airport\n\nCharles de Gaulle or Orly Airport\n\nEuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg\n\nAnd each one has trains and/or buses that go to Colmar.\n\nOnce you are in the city, there are plenty of transport options to help you get around. You can walk, ride a bike, or use the bus.\n\n13. St. Martin’s Church\n\nThe stunning St. Martin’s Church in Colmar is an impressive example of Gothic architecture that has been standing since 1235. It is here where the Isenheim altarpiece was created, a piece of remarkable art that contains wooden panels depicting the life of Christ.\n\nThis combined with its stained-glass windows and intricate exterior design, it’s easy to see why it’s the most beautiful church in town.\n\n14. Fantastic Wine\n\nWhether you’re a novice to wine tasting or a certified connoisseur, Colmar doesn’t disappoint. In fact, no trip is complete without sampling at least one glass of Alsatian wine.\n\nFrom full-bodied Pinot Gris to sweet Gewürztraminer, there’s a wide selection of wines that will captivate your taste buds. Enjoy a glass in a restaurant, explore a wine cellar, or go on a tour. Either way, your wine-tasting experience will no doubt be exceptional.\n\n15.

Here you’ll find tons of hiking, cycling, and nature exploration opportunities.\n\nIn summer, the trails are full of outdoor enthusiasts. Popular activities include hiking to the Grand Ballon, the highest peak in the Vosges mountains, and camping next to Lac de Longemer. But my favorite was taking in the views from the Lac Blanc.\n\nIn winter, adventure-goers will have their choice of snow-capped peaks and downhill slopes.\n\n16.
