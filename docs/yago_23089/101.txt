Pierce Brosnan's life led him to a lasting marriage with Keely Shaye Smith.

Brosnan was previously married to Cassandra Harris from 1980 until her death in 1991. Brosnan and Harris welcomed son Sean (born in September 1983), and he adopted Harris' daughter Charlotte and son Chris, whom she shared with her late ex.

Harris died in December 1991 after battling ovarian cancer. He opened up about coping with the loss in a 2008 interview, noting that his family "cherished every moment" they had with Harris. "Cassie was very positive about life," he said. "I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. She could read people extremely well. She had, above all, the greatest sense of humor. She had this wonderful laugh, which her children have inherited."

Brosnan found his second chance at love after meeting Smith during a trip to Mexico in 1994. They exchanged vows in 2001, expanding their family with sons Paris and Dylan.

“I had a great marriage which sadly had its own ending, and I was lucky enough to find love again. We were meant to find each other. I thank God for her every day,” Brosnan told Closer in January 2018. “When Keely looks at me, I go weak. I love her vitality, her passion. She has this strength that I wouldn’t be able to live without.”
