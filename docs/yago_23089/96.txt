Pierce Brosnan’s wife Keely Shaye Smith has paid tribute to her husband, as they celebrate 23 as a married couple.

The couple who share two sons together Dylan and Paris, got married in August 2001 at Mayo's Ashford Castle, and former model Keely Shaye Smith paid a sweet tribute to her husband via Instagram, with a post including the date and venue where they tied the knot.

“’You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest person I have ever known”, Smith said. “Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together”.

“May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flies on love’s wings”.

The post itself which you can check out below, features three photos, with the first image showing Brosnan dressed in a tuxedo, silver tie and white waistcoat. It also shows Smith in a white gown, with lace sleeves and a long veil.

Pierce Brosnan was previously married to Australian actress Cassandra Harris, who passed away from ovarian cancer in 1991.

They had one son together, Sean, while Brosnan also adopted Harris' two children, Charlotte and Chris. Charlotte passed away from the same illness as her mother in 2013.
