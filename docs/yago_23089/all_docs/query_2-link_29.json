Forever happy and blessed was I to be sitting there when you walked around the corner early one morning in Cabo San Lucas @keelyshayebrosnan üåπ,\" he wrote.\n\nAfter Pierce's first wife Cassandra Harris tragically passed away in 1991, he met Keely in 1994 in Mexico.\n\nThey married at Ballintubber Abbey in Ireland in 2001 and have two sons together ‚Äì Dylan and Paris.\n\nThe couple celebrated their 22nd anniversary last month and in June, Pierce shared a beautiful picture of the couple taken by famous friend and Mamma Mia! co-star Dominic Cooper, captioned with a beautifully poetic sentiment.\n\n\"Night falls, the moon rises, the firmament divides the primal sea, and stars break from the heavens ‚Ä¶home ward bound‚ù§Ô∏è,\" he wrote\n\nEarlier this year, Keely and the rest of Pierce's family shared their own loving messages for the James Bond superstar to celebrate his 70th birthday.\n\nHappy Birthday my darling @piercebrosnanofficial ü•Ç\" said Keely.\n\n\"Wishing you a blessed, bountiful and adventurous new trip around the sun. It‚Äôs not how old you are ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs how bold you are in life.\"\n\nAccompanying a range of photos of Pierce and his sons, Paris wrote: \"Happy 70th to the creator @piercebrosnanofficial. \"More life, more art, more blessings‚Ä¶\""
