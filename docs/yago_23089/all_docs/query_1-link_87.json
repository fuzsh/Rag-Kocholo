        "text": "Pierce Brosnan and his wife Keely have posted sweet tributes to each other as they mark 23 years married, making them one of Hollywood's longest-running couples.\n\nThe 71-year-old actor took to his Instagram to share an adorable message to the former journalist, alongside a four-picture collage of the pair.\n\nToday's top videos\n\n'Happy 23rd anniversary my darling Keely my beautiful brown-eyed girl, my north, my south, my east and west', he wrote. 'All my love, should I fall behind wait for me'.\n\nKeely shared a throwback snap of the pair as they tied the knot in a lavish ceremony at Ashford Castle on August 4th, 2001.\n\n'You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest person I have ever known', she began. 'Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together. May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flys on love’s wings.'\n\nThe Hollywood couple are known for showcasing their affection for each other, with the Mamma Mia actor sharing several heartwarming tributes to her over the years.\n\nThe pair met in Mexico back in April 1994, at a party in Cabo San Lucas. Keely had flown out to interview American actor Ted Danson.\n\nThe couple had an instant spark, with Keely telling People that he was 'captivating' and had a 'mischievous sparkle in his eyes' - and they went on their first date days later.\n\nCongratulations on 23 years Pierce and Keely!"
