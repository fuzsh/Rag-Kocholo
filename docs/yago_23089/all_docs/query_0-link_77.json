        "text": "Aside from his dashing good looks and his stellar performances in hit films including James Bond, Pierce Brosnan has been hailed the ideal man for his open adoration of wife Keely Shaye Brosnan.\n\nThe loved-up couple have been together for more than two decades, meeting as Pierce struggled to get back on his feet following the death of his first wife.\n\nAnd he is her biggest protector, as proven on the number of occasions where vile trolls have criticised the former model's weight.\n\nLast year, the Irish actor shared a snap of the pair on holiday. It was then placed alongside a throwback photo of them in the ocean in the '90s, which went viral with nasty commenters fat-shaming Keely.\n\nDefending his 59-year-old wife, Pierce reportedly delivered a brilliant comeback while also slamming a pal's surgery offer.\n\nIn a sweet message responding to a Facebook post comparing the pictures, the actor is said to have told how 'he loves every curve' of his wife's body, calling her the 'most beautiful woman'.\n\nHe apparently said: \"Friends offered her surgery to reduce her weight. But I strongly love every curve of her body.\n\n\"She is the most beautiful woman in my eyes. And also because she had our five children.\n\n\"In the past, I truly loved her for her person, not only for her beauty, and now I'm loving her even more that she is my children's mother.\n\n\"And I am very proud of her, and I always seek to be worthy of her love.\"\n\nIn admiration of the reported comments, one excited social media fan said: \"This is what true love is. It's who she is. Great personality, fun, humour, caring etc. Not how she looks.\n\n\"I am soo happy Pierce loves her just the way she is!! A true gentleman and an amazing husband.\"\n\nAnother replied: \"Have been a huge fan of his for decades. I now can admire him even more because he has shown to be such a loving husband.\"\n\nA third responded: \"You and Keely have done a remarkable job of showing that fame and fortune have no impact on having a positive relationship.\n\n\"You both are true role models in showing what a good marriage should be.\"\n\nPierce and Keely, who celebrated their 21st wedding anniversary last August, first laid eyes on each other at a party in Mexico.\n\nThe American model turned TV correspondent was there to interview Cheers actor Ted Danson, but when he got called away, she began speaking to Pierce.\n\n\"He was captivating,\" Keely told People in 2001.\n\n\"Tall, dark and handsome â€“ everything that everybody would immediately be attracted to. He had this mischievous sparkle in his eyes. I thought, 'Wow! Wow!'\"\n\nA few days later, the couple had their first date and ended up speaking with each other until three in the morning.\n\n\"We sat down under the stars and [Brosnan] held my hand. There were fireworks going off over our heads, and Kenny Loggins was singing,\" she recalled in the interview.\n\n\"I understand why women find him sexy, because he is an appealing man. He really likes and appreciates women.\"\n\nPierce has previously admitted that meeting Kelly \"saved\" him at a time when depression was taking hold following the death of his first wife - and he would do anything to see her, even when his career was really taking off.\n\n\"Wherever I went in the world I missed her, and I'd send her tickets to come so we could be together. We just seemed to fit,\" he said.\n\n\"I found a great woman in Keely Shaye,\" he said. \"Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.\""
