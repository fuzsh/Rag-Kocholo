        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: When the talk of the town is about celebrity couples, Hollywood has its share of dramatic love affairs to gossip about. From Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to Ben Affleck and JLo, A-list celebrity couples never fail to catch the attention of their fans with their quick marriages and een quicker separations. In light of this, when Pierce Brosnan got married at the height of his fame, they expected a similar 'ending'.\n\nThe world has always known Pierce Brosnan as the famous secret agent and womanizer, ‘James Bond’. But, little did they know, his heart holds true only for one woman in his life — wife Keely Shaye Smith.\n\nRELATED ARTCILES\n\nPierce Brosnan looks dapper as he goes on dinner date with wife of 22 years Keely Shaye Smith\n\nPierce Brosnan and wife Keely Smith exchange heartwarming throwback photos on their 26th wedding anniversary\n\nWhen it comes to romantic relationships, Brosnan is less like his fictional character 007. Over the years of his acting career, the Irish hunk has made thousands of fans, irrespective of gender, fall for his persona. However, despite his decades-long career as a star of box office hits, Pierce Brosnan is also a dedicated father and husband. He married Keely Shaye Smith in 2001 after first falling in love with her in 1994. That’s a long time to stay together and being there for each other, while being papped and being subjected To the 'will they, won't they break-up' game that tabloids play.\n\nThe heart wants what it wants\n\nPierce is unwavering in his support of Keely in both public and private, constantly singing her praises in the media. To start with, Keely started her career as an actress and model who appeared in TV and movies. Later, she became a television correspondent and advocated for environmental causes and animal rights.\n\nThe story of the two crossing paths is nothing less than a fairy tale. They were brought together by fate one evening in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. As a TV reporter, Keely was at the same event that Pierce was attending. In a surprising turn of events, she was meant to speak with Ted Danson, but she ended up getting to know Pierce. \"He had me spellbound. Anybody would be drawn to someone who is tall, dark, and attractive,\" Keely told People in 2001.\n\nHe found love after being heartbroken\n\nAs Brosnan’s fans may know, Cassandra Harris and Brosnan were married until her tragic death in 1991. After his first wife’s death, he met Smith. It seems, from the couple's 28 years of togetherness, the actor did finally move on to give love another chance with Smith, despite being a grieving widower when he met her.\n\nIn several interviews, Pierce has talked about how Smith helped him deal with Harris' death and how she encouraged him to express his sorrow. In one of his interactions with People, he proclaimed “I found a great woman in Keely Shaye. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.” Is someone chopping onions already?\n\nTogether forever\n\nKeely was once referred to by Brosnan as \"my North Star, constantly looking out for me.\" Brosnan too has had his share of sorrows when he lost his first wife as well as his daughter to cancer that Keely helped him through. And through it all, Keely and Pierce, have journeyed together, facing every high and low, often clasping hands in public to show how they lean on each other. Hollywood couldn't have written a better love story."
