It follows a teenage girl's quest to find her real father before she gets married.\n\nShe writes to the three men who could be her father asking them to the Greek island where the wedding is taking place.\n\nHer potential fathers are played by Brosnan, Firth and Stellan Skarsgard.\n\nMeryl Streep plays the taverna-owning mother Donna and the girl, Sophie, is played by Mean Girls star Amanda Seyfried.\n\nBrosnan married former journalist Miss Shaye Smith, 44, in 2001 and has two sons with her, Dylan and Paris.\n\nEdited by danslittlefinger, 01 July 2008 - 01:00 PM.\n\nShe looks great.\n\nI hate those magazines who published nasty comments about her figure. And I am glad that Pierce hasn't done the typical Hollywood thing and \"traded her in for a younger model\".\n\nShe looks great.\n\nI hate those magazines who published nasty comments about her figure. And I am glad that Pierce hasn't done the typical Hollywood thing and \"traded her in for a younger model\".\n\nSame here. I was pretty mad seeing those awful front pages of those tabloids. They can say whatever about Pierce he's a big boy, but Keely no way, she's been out of the public eye. And I have to hand it to Pierce not going Hollywood in that manner as well.\n\nThey're great together. Who cares about the tabloids, a bunch of trash. Let's have some real news people. When I read the title of this thread I was thinking she tripped and fell on the red carpet...\n\nTabloids\n\nShe looks great.\n\nI hate those magazines who published nasty comments about her figure. And I am glad that Pierce hasn't done the typical Hollywood thing and \"traded her in for a younger model\".\n\nSame here. I was pretty mad seeing those awful front pages of those tabloids. They can say whatever about Pierce he's a big boy, but Keely no way, she's been out of the public eye. And I have to hand it to Pierce not going Hollywood in that manner as well.\n\nWhy? Whats the fuss about? Pierce and Keely are obviously volunteering to have their picture taken, it's not as if she has been caught unawares on the beach in a beach tent? It's par for the course if you walk up a red carpet at Leicester Square you are going to get your picture taken. She is merely showing off her assets and they are HUGE so it is only natural the tabloids will comment on the same.\n\nThey are not awful either, she looks fantastic!\n\nHe doesnt look half bad too!\n\nI'm referring to the Enquirer and such tabloids in the US who had this summer splashed Keely across their front pages on their Worst Beach Bods issues (She was unawares at the beach in her swimsuit) making fun of her. They also did the same to Pierce because he's put on a few pounds. He lost that weight and it looks like that Keely may have begun to get in shape, which is different than getting thin. As long as she's healthy, that's all that matters.\n\nThis picture is great, Keely looks wonderful.\n\nShe looks great.\n\nI hate those magazines who published nasty comments about her figure.
