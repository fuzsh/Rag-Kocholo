        "text": "One wonders how many celebrities engage in romantic dalliances based on their partner's perceived ability to increase their own \"star\" cachet. More than a few male celebrities probably pair off with underweight starlets, only to ended up musing to themselves, \"Every magazine says you're beautiful--so why am I not attracted to you?\"\n\nSmall wonder, then, that so many Hollywood marriages end in divorce. The bond between them was never that strong to begin with.\n\nBy contrast, Pierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith have been married for two years, but have been together for many more--and their relationship is still going strong. As Nichole states so eloquently, in stark contrast to the underweight celebrities who epitomize the \"death aesthetic,\" Keely looks vivacious and dynamic and full of life:\n\nEven though they are a part of the celebrity culture that imposes artificial standards of appearance on women, this couple broke free of those media illusions, and found a \"separate peace\" for themselves.\n\nIn his 007 movies, Pierce Brosnan is typically paired off with a rock-hard, over-aerobicized female lead who exudes about as much warmth as a plastic store mannequin. How much more interesting those films would be if the secret agent instead fell under the spell of a woman with Keely Shaye Smith's curves! Such a character would be far more dangerous, and compelling, than any other ingenue in those formulaic movies.\n\nHowever, while a full-figured \"Bond girl\" would be a major breathrough, it is far more noteworthy that in choosing his \"real life\" soulmate, Pierce Brosnan rejected the \"rules\" of his curve-o-phobic profession, and followed his heart. In like manner, many couples find a private happiness for themselves in defiance of societal strictures. Despite a century of brainwashing, most men in our society still prefer women with full, natural curves. The few who don't . . . well, they probably go into show business (which is one reason why the media continues to resist plus-size beauty).\n\nImages of Keely Shaye Smith are widely available online, but let us briefly consider this one:\n\nLike the image in Nichole's post, this photograph is from the premiere of the new Pierce Brosnan feature, titled Laws of Attraction. The name of the film acquires a degree of irony when one sees Ms. Smith standing in front of this promotional poster. In the world of the movie--the distorted world of Hollywood--the leading man is involved with a thin starlet. But in real life, nature's true \"laws of attraction\" compelled Pierce Brosnan to choose a curvaceous soulmate.\n\nThis couple provides society with a terrific example to emulate. Let us hope that many others follow their lead--both in \"planet Hollywood,\" and on planet Earth."
