        "text": "IT'S FAIR to say Pierce Brosnan is one of the most famous (and sexiest) men on the planet.\n\nBut some fans often wonder about his wife, Keely Shaye Smith, who captured the James Bond actor's heart following the heartbreak of losing his first wife.\n\nWho is Pierce Brosnan's wife, Keely Shaye Smith?\n\nBorn in 1963, Keely Shaye Smith is an American journalist, model TV producer, and the wife of Pierce Brosnan.\n\nShe has won numerous awards for her journalism and specializes in gardening and the environment.\n\nAs well as that, she has worked as the entertainment correspondent for NBC's Today Show and CBS's Entertainment Tonight.\n\nKeely was also in a music video with Huey Lewis that spent three weeks at number one in 1986.\n\nShe appeared for one season on General Hospital in 1990 too.\n\nKeely is very involved in environmental activism including educating children.\n\nWhen did Pierce and Keely get married?\n\nKeely met Pierce on a beach in Mexico in 1994.\n\nThey tied the knot seven years later in 2001 in County Mayo in Ireland.\n\nSpeaking about his wife, he told Closer in January 2018: \"When Keely looks at me, I go weak. I love her vitality, her passion.\n\n\"She has this strength that I wouldn’t be able to live without.”\n\nHow many children do Pierce and Keely have?\n\nBetween them, Pierce and Keely share five children and four grandchildren.\n\nAfter getting married, the happy couple had two sons together. Dylan Thomas Brosnan was born in 1997 and Paris Becket Brosnan followed in 2001.\n\nDylan is a filmmaker who worked on the 2019 documentary Western Stars with Bruce Springsteen. He also worked on the docu-series Willie Nelson & Family and the short film So Many Dreams.\n\nParis has worked as a model, filmmaker, and environmental activist. He was a production assistant on Black Adam, in which his father starred in.\n\nIn 2021, Paris directed a short film documenting his 2019 trip to Sri Lanka. The film highlights a partnership between Clarins and the organization FEED to end childhood hunger.\n\nPierce was married to his first wife Cassandra Harris from 1980 until her death from ovarian cancer in 1991.\n\nHe adopted her two children from her first marriage - Charlotte and Christopher - and had a son, Sean, with her.\n\nChristopher Brosnan was born on November 11, 1972. He worked on the production teams for several of his father's films, including Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, and The Thomas Crown Affair.\n\nOn September 13, 1983, Sean Brosnan was born in Los Angeles, California. After struggling with addiction, he now works as a resident adviser at a treatment center for addiction, according to People.\n\nHe has two children, Marley May and Jaxxon Elijah, with his wife Sanja Banic.\n\nUnfortunately, Charlotte followed the same fate as her mother and died of ovarian cancer in 2013. Before her death, she worked as an actress. She had two children, Isabella and Lucas."
