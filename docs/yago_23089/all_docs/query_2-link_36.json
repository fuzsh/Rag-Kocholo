        "text": "Pierce Brosnan is not only a beloved actor but also a Hollywood heartthrob. The 70-year-old has appeared in countless blockbuster movies playing iconic roles and winning various accolades.\n\nBut away from his career in the spotlight, Pierce has been with his wife Keely Shaye Brosnan (nee Smith) for 30 years.\n\nKeely, 60, is an American journalist, author, television host, actress, producer, and director.\n\nKeely first met Pierce in April 1994 at a party in Mexico when she was an entertainment correspondent and had an assignment to interview Ted Danson.\n\nThe pair hit it off and were immediately smitten with each other. Keely spoke to PEOPLE about the first time they met, saying she found Pierce “captivating” and added that he was “tall, dark and handsome”.\n\n“He had this mischievous sparkle in his eyes. I thought, ‘Wow! Wow!’,” she said. “I understand why women find him sexy, because he is an appealing man. He really likes and appreciates women. … He’s intelligent, captivating and his real beauty emanates from the soul. And, like a fine wine, he’s ageing beautifully.”\n\nPierce echoed those sentiments about Keely, saying “I found a great woman in Keely Shaye. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.”\n\nThe couple dated for many years before tying the knot on 4 August 2001, but prior to their wedding they welcomed their two children.\n\nTheir eldest son Dylan was born on 13 January 1997, while their second son Paris was born on 27 February 2001.\n\nThe boys are following in the footsteps of their parents, with Dylan now a model and Paris an actor.\n\nIn November 2022, Dylan and Paris were featured in PEOPLE‘s Sexiest Man Alive issue as part of a portfolio on sons of famous people.\n\nThe brothers gushed about their parents, with Dylan saying, “We have the best parents you could ask for.”\n\nPierce also has one child, Sean, 40, from his first marriage, and also adopted his widow’s children Christopher, 51, and Charlotte.\n\nSadly, Pierce’s first wife Cassandra Harris passed away in 1991 due to ovarian cancer, and his adopted daughter Charlotte also tragically passed away from the same disease in 2013.\n\nPierce was married to Australian actress Cassandra from 1980 until her death.\n\nKeely has supported Pierce through these difficult periods, with the actor calling his wife his “North Star”.\n\n“Keely has always been kind and compassionate and encouraged me to mourn Cassie. … I suppose Keely is my North Star, always looking out for me,” Pierce told Irish Central in 2013.\n\nPierce and Keely are one of Hollywood’s strongest couples, with a rare long-lasting marriage.\n\nAccording to the Brosnans, the secret to their happy and healthy marriage is that they’re “best friends”.\n\n“He has a big heart, generous, warm, kind heart,” Keely said to PEOPLE about her husband.\n\n“Solving problems day in, year after year, liking each other, getting on with each other,” Pierce said about how their relationship has stayed strong for so long.\n\nKeely added: “Being best friends.”\n\nThe couple recently celebrated a huge milestone – 30 years together!\n\nIn honour of the occasion, Keely shared a loving tribute to her husband on social media.\n\n“4-8-94 was my lucky day. How could I have known as I walked around the corner and into your life that my destiny was about to change forever?” Keely began in her post.\n\n“Thanking my lucky stars that I had the courage to introduce myself to you and forever grateful for the connection and family we share 3 decades later. Happy 30th Anniversary!@piercebrosnanofficial ✨ Time flies on loves wings. ”\n\nPierce replied: “Thank God for you my dear Keely, you have given me wings to fly. Love you dearly.”"
