        "text": "Post by piercebrosnanhot on\n\nBond star lets his Irish roots show at Moncton U2 concert\n\nPublished Monday August 1st, 2011\n\nJames Bond.\n\nAt the end of the day, Pierce Brosnan, who has played 007 in three films, was the biggest star to attend Saturday's U2 concert at Magnetic Hill.\n\nForget about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.\n\nAnd those rumours about Oprah, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Bruce Springsteen and Justin Bieber turned out to be nothing but.\n\nThey all may like Bono and the boys, but none of them travelled to New Brunswick for the final show of the two-year, 360º Tour.\n\nAn accomplished actor whose credits include the television program Remington Steele and a number of other motion pictures, including Mrs. Doubtfire and The Matador, created quite a stir around the VIP tent, however.\n\nNot because he has a direct connection to the band, which wrote the theme song to GoldenEye, but because of his portrayals of the dashing secret agent in that movie, Die Another Day and The World Is Not Enough.\n\nBrosnan was swarmed by guests seeking his autograph, a handshake or a quick snapshot.\n\nDavid Alward, New Brunswick's premier, was among them.\n\n\"I'll never wash this hand again,'' Alward said, joking.\n\nAlward was one of two premiers in attendance - Robert Ghiz of Prince Edward Island was the other. Shawn Graham, the former premier, and his wife, Roxanne Reeves, also took in the show, along with a list of MLAs and MPs that included Bruce Fitch, Paul Robichaud, Sue Stoltz, Marie-Claude Blais, Robert Goguen, Victor Boudreau, Dominic LeBlanc and Trevor Holder.\n\nBut there was no sign of Sidney Crosby, who was also alleged to be among the more notable guests.\n\nBelieve me, if Sid the Kid or Oprah was there, somebody would have actually seen them.\n\nBubbles (Mike Smith) and Julian (John Paul Tremblay)from The Trailer Park Boys were also there, in the crowd to the right of the stage as U2 played, and they even posed for pictures. But Brosnan and them were it.\n\nIn previous years, the rumour mill also ran rampant. Despite what you may have heard, Johnny Depp was not at the Stones' concert at Magnetic Hill in 2005. And neither was tennis star Maria Sharapova, who was said to be dating a member of Maroon 5 at the time.\n\nAs for Bieber, the teenage crooner and heart throb, he was said to be seen in Moncton earlier in the day, setting off an alert among concert-goers.\n\nSupposedly, a friend of a friend of a friend's friend took a picture of him in Shoppers Drug Mart, which then got circulated through social media.\n\n\"To me, it looks like a cardboard cutout,\" Stephanie Tower of Sackville said, displaying the dark picture on her cellphone.\n\nSo that's it, until at least next year: Pierce Brosnan and a couple of Trailer Park Boys.\n\nBut wait a minute.\n\nWasn't that guy to the left of the stage Elvis?\n\nPost by piercebrosnanhot on\n\nPierce Brosnan's son Dylan is a double-07 of his handsome dad\n\nWhen your father is a former James Bond and widely accepted as one of the most handsome men on the big screen, you're always in danger of being compared to him.\n\nIt looks as though 14-year-old Dylan Thomas Brosnan has nothing to worry about though, as he is clearly following in his good-looking father's footsteps.\n\nThe teenager was spotted out with his parents doing some Sunday\n\nWhile 58-year-old Brosnan looked classic in a skin tight black T-shirt that showed off his muscular figure and khaki trousers, the youngster showed off a skater boy style.\n\nCarrying his skateboard around the market, Dylan kept his shaggy hairstyle hidden under a beanie, and wore a loose vest and jeans.\n\nHis mother Keely Shaye Smith was also along for the family outing, in a pretty white frock.\n\nThe 48-year-old former TV presenter returned to the car laden with flowers and groceries from the market.\n\nThe couple's other son Paris, ten, was not with them, although the family dog did make an appearance.\n\nPierce is currently in cinemas in I Don't Know How She Does It.\n\nThe Sarah Jessica Parker film, about a busy hedge fund manager who struggles to balance work and family life, also stars Greg Kinnear, Christina Hendricks and Olivia Munn.\n\nThe 007 star plays Sarah Jessica Parker's business client who also throws temptation away from her chaotic family life.\n\nSpeaking last month to Good Morning America, Brosnan said it was 'a delight' to work with Parker again, after Mars Attacks! in 1996. 'We had a great time making the film,' he said.\n\nwww.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2044533/Pierce-Brosnans-son-Dylan-Thomas-14-double-07-handsome-dad.html"
