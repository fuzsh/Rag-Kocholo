        "text": "When you think about the longest, most loving marriages in Hollywood, chances are you think about Pierce Brosnan and Keely Smith’s beautiful love story. They seemed like the perfect couple, until this past week when Brosnan was seen without his wedding ring. Instantly, fans got super worried that there was trouble in their marriage.\n\nHowever, insiders recently spilled the beans, and don’t worry, a breakup is not on the horizon for Brosnan and Smith.\n\nInsiders told Closer Online that all is good with the lovebirds. “Pierce and Keely are the first to admit they’ve had their difficult times down the years, like any other couple,” they said, adding that while they still love each other, it’s not always super easy. “It’s well known that she’s found his intense work schedule difficult to live with at times – plus, they’ve had patches where they’ve gotten on one another’s nerves and needed space for one reason or another.”\n\nThey added, “But, at the end of the day, they’re a total unit, and navigating these ups and downs, and learning to tolerate and compromise, is what’s kept them strong. Pierce is a staunch Catholic, who believes in the sanctimony of marriage and that Keely is very much his life partner until death do they part.”\n\nFor those who don’t know, the pair met back in 1994 while in Mexico. They fell for one another right away. They later married in 2001 at Ballintubber Abbey in Ireland, and welcomed two sons together.\n\nIn an interview with Closer via Marie Claire, Brosnan opened up his marriage to Smith, saying, “I’ve been a married man most of my life — that’s the way I like it. I’m one of those guys who believes you need a strong woman in your life.”"
