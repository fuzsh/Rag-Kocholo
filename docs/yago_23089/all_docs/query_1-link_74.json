        "text": "Pierce Brosnan’s wife Keely Shaye Smith has shared a sweet message in celebration of their 23rd wedding anniversary.\n\nOn Sunday the former model shared three photos to Instagram from their wedding with a caption highlighting the day it took place – August 4 2001, at Ashford Castle in County Mayo, Ireland.\n\nThe rest of the caption read: “’You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest person I have ever known.’\n\n“Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together.\n\n“May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flys on love’s wings.”\n\nIn the first photo, Brosnan can be seen dressed in a tuxedo, white waistcoat and silver tie while Smith dons an elegant white gown with lace sleeves paired with a long veil.\n\nThe couple, who share two sons together, Dylan and Paris, met in 1994.\n\nIn April, Smith, 60, recounted when they met and said in a social media post: “Thanking my lucky stars that I had the courage to introduce myself to you and forever grateful for the connection and family we share 3 decades later.”\n\nJames Bond star Brosnan, 71, was previously married to Australian actress Cassandra Harris and they had one son together, Sean.\n\nThe Irish-American actor also adopted Harris’ children Charlotte and Chris after he married their mother.\n\nCassandra died from ovarian cancer in 1991 and Charlotte died of the same disease in 2013."
