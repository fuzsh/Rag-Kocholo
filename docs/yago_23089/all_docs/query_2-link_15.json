Read on for everything you need to know about Pierce's wife…\n\nWho is Keely Shaye Smith?\n\nKeely is an American journalist and author who also has experience in acting, modelling and TV presenting.

Keely was there to interview Cheers actor Ted Danson when she started talking to Pierce and the pair hit it off immediately. \"He was captivating. Tall, dark, and handsome,\" she recalled. \"Everything that everybody would immediately be attracted to. He had a mischievous sparkle in his eyes.\"\n\nThe couple married seven years later in 2001 in Pierce's native Ireland at Ballintubber Abbey in County Mayo, in front of 100 guests. The day, which was covered exclusively by HELLO!, featured a fireworks display, a seven-tier cake and an elaborate ice sculpture of Rodin's The Kiss.\n\nIt's clear the 007 actor is totally smitten with his other half. He has previously told the Independent: \"I love her vitality, her passion. She has this strength that I wouldn't be able to live without. When Keely looks at me, I go weak.\" The romantic has also said: \"I found a great woman in Keely. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.\"\n\nHow many children do they have?\n\nPierce and Keely welcomed their first child, Dylan Thomas Brosnan, in 1997 followed by another son Paris Beckett four years later. The couple then tied the knot six months after Paris's arrival in the same abbey where their baby son was christened.\n\nWho was Pierce married to before?\n\nPierce sadly lost his first wife, Australian actress Cassandra Harris, to cancer in December 1991. Cassie, as she was known, was 43. The couple had one son together, Sean, and Pierce also adopted Cassie's two older children Charlotte and Chris. Charlotte sadly also died of ovarian cancer in June 2013.\n\nPierce has credited his wife Keely for helping him heal. \"Keely has always been kind and compassionate and encouraged me to mourn Cassie,\" he said. \"I think of her all the time. I suppose Keely is my North Star, always looking out for me.\""
