        "text": "Actor Pierce Brosnan recently took to social media to express his deep love and admiration for his wife, Keely Shaye Smith, in celebration of their 23rd wedding anniversary. The “James Bond” star shared a heartfelt collage of photos capturing their journey together over the years. In the post, Brosnan wrote, “Happy 23rd anniversary my darling Keely my beautiful brown-eyed girl, my north, my south, my east and west. All my love, should I fall behind wait for me.”\n\nThe collage featured numerous touching moments of the couple, both past and present, showing them holding hands, cuddling on the beach, and embracing in various other moments, beautifully narrating their enduring love story. The two first met in 1994 in Mexico and tied the knot in Ireland in August 2001. Together, they have two sons, Dylan and Paris. Brosnan also has three children from his first marriage to Cassandra Harris, who sadly passed away from ovarian cancer in 1991, and their daughter Charlotte also succumbed to the disease in 2013.\n\nKeely Shaye Smith also celebrated their anniversary on Instagram, posting wedding photos with the message, “You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest person I have ever known. Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together. May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flys on love’s wings.”\n\nIn a December 2023 interview with Fox News Digital, Brosnan divulged the secrets behind their long-lasting relationship in the often tumultuous landscape of Hollywood. He explained that a combination of mutual “like” and “love” for each other has allowed them to grow and evolve together. “And we’ve been down the road, and we’ve seen many, many hardships as families do, as we all do,” he said. “But watching someone grow up with you and grow old with you is a very spiritual journey. To watch each other change… whatever it may be, the hair, the waist. But it’s the love in the heart.” He also credited Smith for creating a strong family foundation for their sons and supporting his career ventures.\n\nThe couple’s enduring relationship serves as a touching testament to the power of love and endurance amidst life’s challenges."
