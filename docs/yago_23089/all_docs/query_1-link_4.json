All my love, should I fall behind wait for me,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe photos show Brosnan and Smith holding hands and cuddling while on the beach, both in the past and the present, as well as the couple with their arms around each other in similar poses over the years, showcasing how far the two have come together.\n\nPIERCE BROSNAN’S ‘SPIRITUAL JOURNEY’ WITH WIFE OF 22 YEARS: ‘WE’VE BEEN DOWN THE ROAD’\n\nThe \"James Bond\" star and Smith first met in 1994 during a chance encounter when they were both in Mexico. They married in August 2001 in Ireland. In that time, the couple welcomed their sons, Dylan and Paris. Brosnan also had three children with his first wife, Cassandra Harris.\n\nHe and Harris had one son, Sean, together, as well as her other two children, Charlotte and Christopher, from her first marriage, who Brosnan adopted.\n\nHarris and Brosnan were married for 11 years before she died from ovarian cancer in December 1991. Many years later, in 2013, their daughter Charlotte would also go on to die from ovarian cancer, at the age of 42.\n\n\"Happy 23rd anniversary my darling Keely my beautiful brown eyed girl, my north, my south, my east and west.
