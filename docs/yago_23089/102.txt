Pierce Brosnan, 69, constantly clung to his wife's waist or held her hand as he celebrated the premiere of Black Adam.

The actor is married to journalist Keely Shaye Smith, who is ten years his junior, and the chemistry between the inseparable couple was clear as they walked the red carpet.

The James Bond star, who appeared in classic movies including Die Another Day, Golden Eye, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough, donned a navy blue velvet blazer, paired with a white shirt, black trousers and patent leather loafers.

Meanwhile, wife Keely, to whom he has been married for more than two decades, raised a grin in a sparkly black midi dress, paired with a coordinating black velvet blazer.

Pierce rocked his natural salt and pepper hair with confidence, as the pair showcased their appearances in later age gracefully and looked spectacular.
