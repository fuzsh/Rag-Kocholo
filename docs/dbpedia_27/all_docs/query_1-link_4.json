Natchitoches became the first European settlement in the Louisiana territory.\n\nNatchitoches Parish\n\nSpain establishes the mission San Miguel de Linares de los Adaes approximately 20 miles west of the French settlement in Natchitoches.\n\nNatchitoches Parish\n\n1716\n\n1721\n\nAfter a skirmish with the French left the mission abandoned for two years, Spain reestablishes Los Adaes and builds an accompanying presidio (fort) named Nuestra Senora del Pilar de los Adaes.\n\nNatchitoches Parish\n\nLos Adaes serves as the capital of Spanish Texas.\n\nNatchitoches Parish\n\n1729 - 1773\n\n1762 - 1764\n\nLouisiana west of the Mississippi River ceded to Spain as payment for its support in the French and Indian War. Small Native American Tribes east of the river, former allies of the French, move to the area to avoid conflict with the English, including Yowani, Choctaw, Alabama, Biloxi, Chatot, Appalache, Panaca.\n\n(Faine & Gregory, 1986).\n\nEl Camino Real de los Tejas connected a series of posts and missions established in the early 1700’s extending from Mexico City to Los Adaes and later into Natchitoches. Although the route through many areas followed buffalo and Indian trails, this road had three major crossings at the Sabine River. It traveled approximately 47 miles from the Sabine River across what is now Sabine Parish to Los Adaes.\n\nSabine Parish\n\nEarly 1700s\n\n1762\n\nFrance cedes all territory west of the Mississippi River to Spain as payment for its support during the French and Indian War.\n\nSpanish ruled \"Luisiana\" expands settlements into Southwest Louisiana.\n\nSouthwest Louisiana\n\n1763 - 1803\n\n1764 - early 1800s\n\nPanaca tribe settles at the Calcasieu River.\n\nNear Elizabeth, LA\n\nAllen Parish\n\nLos Adaes, then the capital of the province of Texas, abandoned and families ordered back to San Antonio.

Families of Los Adaes re-settle eastern Texas from San Antonio (Faine & Gregory, 1986).\n\nSabine and Natchitoches Parishes\n\nLeCompte Land Grant\n\nOne of the earliest original land grants was made to Ambrosie LeCompte, a resident of Natchitoches Parish. The present day city of Leesville is located near the center of the LeCompte grant. Monsieur LeCompte received one square league of land, measured in such a manner that each half of the land is astraddle the road that passes through L’Anacoco Prairie. The grant is dated April 17, 1787, and signed by Don Antonio Gil Y’Barbo, Captain and Commandant of the post at Nacogdoches. As stipulated in terms of the grant, Monsieur LeCompte was to permit no stranger who did not have the proper passport to travel through his grant. He was given the authority to arrest the trespasser and to escort him to the Spanish officials at Los Adais. The LeCompte land grant was operated as a stock farm and plantation into the 1840s.\n\nVernon Parish\n\nApril 17, 1787\n\nLate 1700s\n\nEarly 1800s\n\nChoctaw Apache Tribe of Ebarb. The Choctaw Apache trace their heritage back into the 1600’s. The tribe is made up of descendants of 21 families of Adaes, Choctaw, and Lipan Apache people. The Apache were sold as slaves in Natchitoches and Los Adaes and settled as free persons in the area during the Spanish period, when Indian slavery was outlawed. The Choctaw ancestors arrived in the late 1700’s and early 1800’s seeking new lands, while ancestors also included natives of the Spanish mission at Los Adaes. Generally, the Choctaw Apache lived in isolated rural communities in the bottomlands of the Sabine River.\n\nSabine Parish\n\nRoman Catholic Church founded by Spanish at Bayou Scie.\n\nBayou Scie (Zwolle area), Sabine Parish\n\n1795\n\nc1797\n\nAmerican Indian Settlements comprised of various tribes who lost lands during the French-Indian War, who settled in the area.

It took effect in 1808, the earliest date permitted by the United States Constitution.\n\nUnited States\n\n1808\n\n1808 - 1816\n\nZebulon Pike Patrols\n\nPatrolling Louisiana’s Neutral Strip became a delicate dance of political negotiation. Any action conducted by America aroused the suspicions of Spain. Any action by Spain made America leery. Understanding that the solution required diplomatic finesse, Texas Governor Manuel Salcedo approached Louisiana Governor William C. C. Claiborne. Claiborne appointed Lieutenant Colonel Zebulon Pike to form a joint military expedition. Pike had clear instructions. His soldiers were to remove only squatters and outlaws. Settlers who had lived in the region before the Louisiana Purchase were to be left alone. During his 1812 foray into No Man’s Land, Pike’s troops drove out outlaws but also burned houses, tents, and camps belonging to many established settlers.\n\nWar between United States and England began,\n\n“War of 1812”\n\n1812\n\n1815\n\nTexian resettlement in No Man's land along with settlers from the Upland South begins.\n\nLouisiana\n\nHenry Stoker acquired land along El Camino approximately four miles east of Ft.

Jesup established to bring law and order to former Neutral Strip, also to act as Indian agents, prevent slave insurrections, clear Sabine River of obstructions.\n\nSabine Parish\n\nTwo miles east of Ft.

One of the purposes of Ft. Jesup was to supply necessary border fortification against incursions from Texas, which was under Spanish crown. In order to strengthen the military position of Ft. Jesup, a Block House was erected near Sabine River, not far from where El Camino Real crossed Sabine River at current day Pendleton Bridge. The well from the Block House has been preserved behind present Beulah Church.\n\nSabine Parish\n\n1836\n\n1840\n\nCalcasieu Parish established with parish seat at Marion.\n\nCalcasieu Parish\n\nSabine Parish created by State Legislature (from Natchitoches Parish).\n\nSabine Parish\n\n1843\n\n1848\n\nThe Bayou Scie Methodist Church was built around 1848.
