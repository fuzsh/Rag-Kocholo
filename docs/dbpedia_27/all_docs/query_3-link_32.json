Among these materials are the documents written and collected by Jean-Louis Berlandier between 1827 and 1851, many of which were acquired by Yale from Henry R. Wagner. One of these previously unpublished and seldom-cited documents is the diary kept by Gen. Manuel de Mier y Tera´n on his 1828 inspection of Texas as a boundary commissioner for the Mexican government. A translation of Tera´n’s diary is herein given, and for this privilege we must extend thanks to George Miles, director of the Beinecke. Over the years he has done much to stimulate interest in and appreciation for the Texas documents in this collection, and we trust that our volume will further the process. He has also generously allowed us to reproduce several facsimile pages and use two Tera´n letters from the Berlandier papers at Yale. We especially would like to thank Scooter Cheatham and Lynn Marshall for contributing their botanical observations to the book. Apart from the original inhabitants, people ever since Alvar Nu´n˜ez Cabeza de Vaca have wandered around Texas wondering about the ﬂora of the countryside—which tubers, fruits, and berries were safe to eat and which ones could kill you, for starters. Scooter and Lynn’s ongoing twelve-volume series, The Useful Wild Plants of Texas, the Southeastern and Southwestern United States, the Southern Plains and Northern Mexico, will answer many of these questions, and we are glad they were willing to shed some light on the plants that Tera´n saw on his journey through pristine Texas in 1828. Del Weniger offered his expertise on the fauna mentioned, which is the subject of volume two of his latest book, The Explorers’ Texas. Our friend Galen Greaser rendered much help with the Spanish records of the Texas General Land Ofﬁce, ﬁelded questions about early\n\nx texas by tera´ n\n\nsurvey plat maps, and also passed along copies of several important Texas maps he found in the National Archives. We received advice on different sections of the diary and individuals whom Tera´n met during the trip from Dorcas Baumgartner, Jim Corbin, Linda Flores, Patricia R. Leme´e, Thomas Ricks Lindley, Timothy K. Perttula, and Bill Stein. Betje Klier was gracious enough to let us reprint her translation of The´odore Pavie’s view of east Texas, and we wish to thank George Ward of the Texas State Historical Association for similar permissions involving traveler accounts of San Antonio in 1828. Ron Tyler, along with Howard Karno and Joseph Musso, helped us choose illustrations for the book, including several original Claudio Linati watercolors that are little known outside of Mexico. For securing the portrait of Tera´n on the dust jacket (also used as the frontispiece) we are indebted to Carmen Herna´ndez Pin˜a, and we must thank Engerborg Montero of the Museo Nacional de Historia at Chapultepec Castle for permission to reproduce it. We should also acknowledge Ohland Morton’s groundbreaking study of Tera´n’s life and the Texas State Historical Association’s beautiful two-volume edition of Berlandier’s Journey to Mexico, both of which made this project a lot easier to accomplish.\n\nS\n\nJack Jackson John Wheat\n\nTexas by Tera´n\n\nfigure 1 Lithograph of General Guadalupe Victoria, who was president of Mexico at the time of Tera´n’s inspection.

The inﬂux turned out to be overwhelming, and the North American colonists seemed little inclined to convert to a ‘‘Mexican’’ point of view. They kept their religious and political beliefs and insisted on their right to own slaves. Further, they clamored loudly for Mexico to recognize their ideas about selfgovernment and turned menacing when told to function according to the Mexican scheme of things. Already they outnumbered the nativeborn tejanos, and this demographic imbalance was rapidly increasing. Events like the Fredonian Rebellion, late in 1826, seemed to conﬁrm suspicions that the foreign colonists in Texas would not obey the Mexican government’s laws when they conﬂicted with the colonists’ own interests. Only a few of the Anglo empresarios, like Stephen F. Austin, gave any indication that they were genuinely interested in peopling the land with productive citizens or that they wished to reach an accommodation between the two cultures. But could Austin control his colonists? No one in Mexico was certain, and the situation concerning the other empresarios was even more questionable. With these serious matters looming, the idea of a Comisio´n de Lı´mites (Boundary Commission) began to take form. The Adams-Onı´s Treaty of 1819 had established a boundary between Spain and the United States, and the agreement was inherited by an independent Mexico. But it had not been ratiﬁed by either of the interested nations once Spain passed from the scene. Worse, the actual line had not been deﬁned nor its key points surveyed on the ground. This was the initial and primary purpose of the Boundary Commission: to mark critical points on the dividing line between the United States and Mexico (as set forth in the Treaty of 1819). Sweeping events, however, soon caused the planned expedition to assume a grander import for the government of Mexico than that of a routine boundary\n\n2 texas by tera´ n\n\nsurvey. These events made it more imperative for the Boundary Commission to assess the present condition of the frontier, determine the measures necessary for its security, and decide which points should be garrisoned and how. Of particular concern was the Indian situation, not only regarding the wild tribes who regularly committed depredations on the frontier but also concerning those ‘‘peaceful’’ tribes known to be ﬂocking to Texas from the United States. Little information was available in Mexico on these Indians, of diverse origins and various degrees of civilization, except that they were fearless ﬁghters and all well armed. Would they prove to be a stabilizing or disruptive inﬂuence on the tribes native to Texas? Alliances might be appropriate with some of these Indians, in order to bind them to the interests of Mexico, but no one knew which tribes merited such recognition or should be encouraged to occupy the frontier zone—for example, by awarding them concessions of land. Their westward migration into Mexican (Spanish) territory had begun as a trickle at the turn of the century but had since become a ﬂow of increasing proportions that must now be reckoned with. Some argued that their hostility to the North Americans would make them an effective buffer against U.S. designs on Texas, if they were guaranteed lands along the boundary line. Concerning the swarm of Anglo Americans into Texas, the Boundary Commission was to ascertain the true dimensions of the problem. Was it actually a problem involving Mexico’s territorial integrity, as the government had been warned? How many of them were in Texas legally, as opposed to being squatters, and what were their circumstances? This meant that the Boundary Commission had to review the results of the empresario system to date and learn how well these individuals were complying with their obligations to colonize Texas with respectable citizens. Some of these contracts might need to be canceled, due to nonfulﬁllment or improper behavior on the part of the empresarios. Word was that some of them planned to sell their concessions to speculative interests in the United States, thereby compounding the process of North American domination. The encouragement of immigration from Europe was one option being considered in order to achieve more of a racial and cultural balance in Texas; Irish, Swiss, and German families were deemed preferable, should this approach be taken. In view of rising fears in Mexico City concerning the attitude of the U.S. government toward the acquisition of Texas, it was important to know if some of these ‘‘colonists’’ were\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nactually agents working secretly to undermine Mexican control of the department. The Boundary Commission was also to compile a complete report on the natural resources of Texas, its agricultural, mining, and commercial possibilities, the history of its settlements, etc., in addition to satisfying the pressing need for geographical data. Named to head this ambitious undertaking was Gen. Manuel de Mier y Tera´n,1 perhaps one of the most qualiﬁed men in Mexico for the job. Tera´n, at the time the expedition was launched late in 1827, was thirtyeight years old and in charge of Mexico’s artillery school. He had graduated from the National College of Mines, was a recognized specialist in mathematics and engineering, and was very interested in the natural sciences. He had fought in the war for independence from Spain and then served in Mexico’s ﬁrst congress; later he was the minister of war. Many of Tera´n’s comrades in the struggle for independence were now top ofﬁcials in the government, and he was highly regarded by them.2 As the government wanted scientiﬁc results from its Boundary Commission, Tera´n was given a number of capable assistants; it was a matter not just of surveying a line but of cataloging the natural wealth of Texas, so that intelligent decisions could be made concerning its development. Two ofﬁcers, Jose´ Batres and Constantino Tarnava, were selected to make military and geographical observations under Tera´n’s guidance. Both were lieutenant colonels, Tarnava in the army’s engineering corps and Batres attached to the general staff. A sublieutenant of the artillery corps, Jose´ Marı´a Sa´nchez y Tapia, served as draftsman for the expedition, and it appears that he was also a gifted artist, although none of his original illustrations are presently known. In addition to these soldiers, several civilians were attached to the Boundary Commission. Jean-Louis Berlandier, a young native of France, went as botanist and zoologist, and Rafael Chovell, a student at the College of Mines, was selected as mineralogist. Compared to earlier inspections of Texas under Spanish rule, this expedition was well equipped and composed of men with the training necessary to compile a very useful report of what they saw. Leaving Mexico City on November 10, 1827, Tera´n’s team arrived at Laredo on the afternoon of February 1, 1828. They were greeted by Gen. Anastasio Bustamante, military commander of the eastern interior states, and remained there as his guests for three weeks. San Antonio de Be´xar was reached early in March, after an eleven-day journey. Tera´n stayed at Be´xar until April 13, using this six-week layover to familiarize himself with what was to come once he passed beyond this last bastion of Mexican culture in the north. While at Be´xar he wrote an interesting\n\n4 texas by tera´ n\n\nletter to President Guadalupe Victoria that tells us a great deal about Tera´n’s ideas on Texas before he had actually seen much of it. These ideas were either brought from Mexico City as part of Tera´n’s intellectual ‘‘baggage’’ or were based on information that he obtained in Be´xar, probably some of both. Getting under way at the time when Texas is an explosion of wildﬂowers, Tera´n passed through Gonzales—then a collection of six recently erected cabins. High water kept him at the Colorado River from April 23 to 25, near present-day Columbus, where Benjamin Beeson had a ferry. He reached San Felipe de Austin on April 27, staying there until May 10 as Stephen F. Austin’s guest. All the inspection team members wrote detailed descriptions of this place, the ‘‘spark’’ from which— Sa´nchez predicted—would ‘‘start the conﬂagration that will deprive us of Texas.’’ Leaving San Felipe they moved on toward Nacogdoches through unbearable heat, swarms of noxious insects, and rain-sodden roads. Stops were made at Jared Groce’s two houses near the Brazos River and at Holland’s place on the La Bahı´a Road, their progress being agonizingly slow. Tera´n, Berlandier, Juan the cook, and other team members suffered from fevers all the way to the Trinity, where they arrived on May 25. As it was impossible to cross the swollen, rapidly ﬂowing Trinity with his heavy coach and the breakdown-prone instrument wagon, on May 28 Tera´n decided to send them back to Be´xar, via the high road, with most of the team. He, Sa´nchez, and an escort of eight men continued by horseback, after crossing the river by ﬂatboat and using a canoe to negotiate the thickly wooded ﬂoodplain on its east bank. Worn and weary, they rode into Nacogdoches on June 3, and this town served as Tera´n’s base of operations for the next seven and a half months. During this time he was almost daily regaled by Indian visitors, being assisted by Peter Ellis Bean in this delicate business. He talked to the inhabitants, wrote letters to the Mexican capital, and received many political discourses from Austin, but bad weather and ill health in the summer and fall limited his travels into the boundary zone. Finally, on October 17 he set out to make observations of the line between the Sabine and Red Rivers, as called for by the Adams-Onı´s Treaty. He wandered near modern Shreveport and went down into the Bayou Pierre district, returning to Nacogdoches on November 11. A second month-long trip was begun on the 28th, its purpose to survey the mouth of the Sabine River. The country was ﬂooded, however, and\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nTera´n was forced to turn back before even reaching the Atascosito settlement on the lower Trinity, his route generally following its course downstream from the Coushatta villages. This frustrated attempt marked the end of Tera´n’s explorations along the border. Even so, extensive records of Tera´n’s expedition were written by various members of his team. A number of these accounts have been published and will be duly cited. Amazingly, Tera´n’s own diary of the inspection has not been published, despite its valuable and wide-ranging observations of Texas. This document is presented herein—for the ﬁrst time in Spanish or English—along with some of the general’s reports on conditions found in Texas as he passed through ‘‘this beautiful portion of Mexican territory.’’ In the Western Americana Collection at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Yale University are two copies of Tera´n’s diary: Ms. S-313, the document used for this translation, and Ms. S-314. The ﬁrst is titled ‘‘Texas por Tera´n: Su viage, 1828’’ (Texas by Tera´n, His Journey), which we have rendered simply as ‘‘Texas by Tera´n.’’ It commences when Tera´n left San Antonio de Be´xar on April 13, 1828, headed to Nacogdoches, and ends with his arrival at Matamoros on March 7, 1829. We have used this version because of its very legible and beautiful script, possibly in the hand of Jose´ Marı´a Sa´nchez, but we have closely checked it against the other version, which seems to be in Tera´n’s relatively cramped handwriting (compare Figures 2 and 3). This second version (S-314) is titled ‘‘Comisio´n de Lı´mites: Diario de General Tera´n, 1827’’; it begins when Tera´n left the Mexican capital with his inspection team on November 10, 1827, and runs through August 13, 1829, after he had returned to Tamaulipas. This fuller account, however, has a break between the Rio Grande and Be´xar. Either this portion is lost or Tera´n put the diary aside upon reaching Laredo and did not resume his entries until heading northeast from Be´xar. In terms of the expedition itself, this lapse is not a serious matter because Berlandier and Sa´nchez kept diaries for the Laredo-Be´xar segment of the trip, in which they recorded their impressions of both towns. These two accounts have been published in English and may be consulted for information missing from Tera´n’s diary.3 Brieﬂy stated, Berlandier’s diary focuses on scientiﬁc matters (especially those botanical) while Sa´nchez’s tends to be more personal and concerned with the threat posed to Mexico by the Anglo occupants of Texas. Sa´nchez was very suspicious of these people and found himself favorably impressed, often begrudgingly so, by only a few of them.\n\n6 texas by tera´ n\n\nfigure 2 A page from ‘‘Texas por Tera´n,’’ Ms. S-313, which we have used for our translation because of its highly legible script.

Not all North American settlers wished to ‘‘steal’’ Texas from Mexico, as Sa´nchez believed, and not all of them drank themselves into oblivion after a hard day’s work, as Tera´n observed at Nacogdoches. The Indians seen in Texas were routinely referred to as ‘‘savages’’ or ‘‘barbarians’’ (salvajes, ba´rbaros), despite the numerous steps they had taken toward civilization (which were also being noted by the writer in his description of them). This deprecating (by modern standards, insulting) terminology was almost as ingrained among Mexicans as it was among their North American counterparts. Nor did Africans receive from the diarists much serious consideration as individuals with inherent rights. Apparently, the long-standing tradition of servitude for dark-skinned peoples in both the Anglo and Hispanic cultures overrode whatever judgments Tera´n and his companions may have entertained about the realities of slavery seen up close. In their era it was easy to compartmentalize the institution and the abuses suffered thereby; indeed, in polite society it was almost expected that the concept of slavery would be dealt with separately from the reality. Since Tera´n in his Texas travels was hosted by the more prosperous class of people— many of them slaveholders—it should not surprise us that he often gives voice to their concerns over the government’s guaranteeing rights of ‘‘property’’ and recognizing the necessity of maintaining slavery for the development of Texas. In view of Mexico’s recent revolution against Spain and the stated egalitarian goals of the independent nation, a surprising theme emerges from the records of the 1828 inspection: class and regional distinctions between Mexicans themselves. The Mexicans in Texas were perceived as different from and somehow inferior to citizens in the rest of the republic: they were irresponsible, lazy, and backward. This theme is repeated in all the inspection diaries; it suggests that the diarists expected to ﬁnd the frontier a primitive, slothful, degenerate, and violent place and that their expectations colored what they actually saw. No doubt the tejanos entertained similar biases against these upper-class, cultivated visitors who came into their midst to pronounce judgment on them. In a sense, then, Tera´n’s visita was reminiscent of those of inspection teams that had ridden north from Mexico City during the Spanish colonial era. Alas, however, the citizens of the areas being inspected rarely\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\ncommitted their thoughts to paper, unless in ofﬁcial correspondence, and even then they were careful to maintain a respectful attitude toward General Tera´n and his entourage—just as they had been toward Rivera, Rubı´, and all the military inspectors of the past decades. Needless to say, we have endeavored to render Tera´n’s ideas just as he expressed them, without regard to their political correctness nowadays, and have tried to present his diary as a genuine reﬂection of conditions as they existed in Texas when he passed through and witnessed them in 1828. Of the other two diarists of the expedition, Berlandier is far better known than Sa´nchez and has more publications to his credit. Evidently this process began with his ‘‘Diario del viage de Luis Berlandier’’ (dated November 19, 1828), which was issued in installments starting on January 26, 1831, in the Registro Oﬁcial, a Mexico City paper.4 In 1832 a pamphlet called ‘‘Memorias de la Comisio´n de Lı´mites’’ appeared, dealing strictly with botanical observations but credited to both Tera´n and Berlandier.5 In 1850 a more comprehensive volume was published under the title Diario de viage de la Comisio´n de Lı´mites que puso el gobierno de la repu´blica, bajo la direccio´n del exmo. sr. general de divisio´n d. Manuel de Mier y Tera´n, listing Berlandier and Chovel[l] as the authors.6 It contains only the Laredo-Be´xar segment of the Boundary Commission’s 1828 travels in Texas (February 1–March 1), plus Berlandier’s excursion northwest of Be´xar to go bear and bison hunting with Col. Jose´ Francisco Ruiz and some Comanche warriors (November 19–December 18). This hunting trip occurred after Berlandier had to leave Tera´n’s entourage on the Trinity River because of illness and once he had sufﬁciently recovered. In addition to these published sources, at Yale there is a brief itinerary attributed to Berlandier and Chovell in Ms. S-307; it ends on May 4 at San Felipe de Austin. Still another Berlandier/Chovell variant, in Ms. S-315 (a duplicate copy in S-330), continues to the Trinity, where Berlandier’s fever caused Tera´n to fragment the expedition and send most of the troop back to Be´xar with the three vehicles. Also, there are copies of Berlandier’s ‘‘Voyage au Mexique’’ at the Library of Congress and the Gilcrease Museum, as well as the multiple variants at Yale. Yale has additional manuscripts attributed to Chovell, including one called ‘‘General Considerations on the Department of Texas’’ (written in French on seventy narrow pages, S-317). While all these diaries differ in minor respects, the most accessible (and extensive) version to appear in print is the Texas State Historical Association’s 1980 two-volume edition of Berlandier’s ‘‘Voyage au Mexique,’’ translated from the Library of Congress copy and published\n\n10 texas by tera´ n\n\nas Journey to Mexico. It covers not only his travels in Texas (including an 1834 trip) but those in Mexico as well.7 Why another diary of the Tera´n expedition? First, this one was kept by the man who headed the inspection team and whose views on Texas were critical to Mexican policy-making in the years ahead. After the inspection, Tera´n became the commandant general of the eastern interior states and the federal colonization commissioner for Texas, based at Matamoros. His opinions were solicited by the president and his cabinet ministers on all matters touching Texas, opinions which in large measure formed the basis of important national legislation like the controversial Law of April 6, 1830.8 Second, Tera´n’s diary contains information lacking in the journals of his assistants. As noted, the inspection was divided at the Trinity on May 28, 1828, and only Sa´nchez stayed with Tera´n on the trek to east Texas. For the critical months of the inspection Tera´n’s diary is our primary source concerning the activities of the Boundary Commission, because Sa´nchez apparently stopped his account once they reached Nacogdoches; thereafter he gives us only a brief glimpse of the town and lifts quotes from Tera´n’s diary on some of the Indian tribes who visited Tera´n at that place. Sa´nchez may have accompanied Tera´n’s two excursions to survey (i.e., observe) the boundary line, and though he also rode back to Matamoros with Tera´n at the beginning of 1829, his account—if he kept one—has not survived, or remains unknown. Consequently, only the diary of General Tera´n offers us a ﬁrsthand look at the most important part of the Boundary Commission’s work in Texas, and we are at a loss to say why no scholar has heretofore taken the trouble to make this important document available to the general reading public with an interest in Texas history. To give the reader a fuller, more nuanced picture of Texas in 1828, excerpts from the accounts of several other travelers are presented in two places: Joseph C. Clopper’s chauvinistic and testosterone-tinged view of San Antonio, and The´odore Pavie’s lively description of life in Nacogdoches. Between the historical accounts of these two young men, one a practical ‘‘go-ahead’’ American and the other a liberally educated Frenchman, we can get a good idea of how Texas looked to cultural outsiders. Taken with the descriptions by Berlandier (who had moved to Mexico from Geneva less than a year earlier) and Sa´nchez (a native Mexican but new to the northern frontier), it is possible to gain a somewhat balanced notion of the customs and habits of the various ethnic groups in Texas at the time of Tera´n’s visit. All of these descriptions\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\ncontrast nicely with Tera´n’s own impressions, which were usually given in a more formal, decorous, and nonjudgmental manner.9 We have also selected a few of Tera´n’s letters and reports written in Texas to augment the diary at various points. Rather than relegate these letters to an appendix, they are placed in the text to correspond with the time he wrote them. These letters give us a sense of how Tera´n’s ideas about Texas changed after direct contact with the land and its people, of how his opinions were formed concerning the course of action necessary to preserve Texas and keep it attached to the Mexican nation. Thus, these reports back to the president and various ministers of the government supplement Tera´n’s diary observations and demonstrate how his thinking on Texas crystallized into policy recommendations. Especially is this true concerning the large number of Indians who were coming into Texas from the United States as a result of the harsh removal policies being enacted in Washington and carried out from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. We have accordingly devoted attention to Tera´n’s views on these tribes as they appeared before him at Nacogdoches in a constant stream, all asking for lands in Texas, denouncing the greed and perﬁdy of the United States, and swearing eternal friendship to the Mexican nation. While Tera´n was duly concerned about the plight of these semicivilized tribes (and left us a marvelous account of their customs and appearances), his chief focus was on the restless horde of Anglo frontiersmen who were spilling into Texas and taking up residence with little regard for Mexican territorial claims. These uninvited people, not the various uprooted Indian tribes, were his main problem and Mexico’s as well. Tera´n was not happy with what he saw happening on the frontier—with the indigent squatters he encountered living hand-to-mouth in shacks or with the prosperous variety of colonists such as Jared Groce, who had settled in Texas under the empresario system, obtained legal title to his lands, and grown rich through the morally repugnant exploitation of Negro slaves. More feared than social implications, however, were the political views of these new ‘‘Mexicans’’ and whether or not their views— once put into action—would lead to the loss of Texas. This uneasiness extended even to men like Stephen F. Austin. Austin, of course, was the ﬁgurehead of Anglo-American aspirations in Texas, and for this reason alone he merited close watching. By virtue of his deceased father’s colonization contract, he had been the ﬁrst norteamericano authorized to parcel out Texas lands and usher the recipients into dutiful citizenship. Beyond their personal contact at San Felipe,\n\n12 texas by tera´ n\n\nAustin and Tera´n wrote each other frequently in 1828, their letters revealing much about their respective concerns. Tera´n was after scientiﬁc information, while Austin was pressing for recognition of his ideas on how Texas should be developed. Even though the two men came to have respect and something akin to personal regard for one another, by no means did they agree on the issues at stake in Texas. Still, Austin helped Tera´n understand the mechanics of the ‘‘system’’ in Texas and how it differed from the traditional land tenure practices of Mexico. When Tera´n left Texas early in 1829, he had a much ﬁrmer grasp on the internal affairs of the department than did any of his high-ranking afﬁliates on the national scene. But was the system working to Mexico’s advantage, or would these rich concessions to foreigners eventually result in the dismemberment of Texas from the Mexican federation? Tera´n came to Texas seeking answers to this vital question, and it occupied his time and attention more than what proved to be incidental concerns about a boundary line drawn through the wilderness—a line that would have little meaning anyway if Mexico could not control movement across it. Further, because of the high standing accorded Tera´n in the Mexican capital and the role that he played in the future colonization affairs of Texas, his views of the situation became critical to the formation of ofﬁcial policy for governing Mexican Texas. As these views to no small degree resulted from Tera´n’s experiences during his 1828 inspection tour, his diary and letters written while in Texas are the key to understanding subsequent events. What sort of a man was Manuel de Mier y Tera´n? He was a man of education, reﬁnement, and considerable talent—also a man of sensitivity, which sometimes led to bouts of depression when he saw events spinning out of control. Above all he was a soldier, dedicated to duty and willing to sacriﬁce his health, personal affairs, and predispositions for the good of his country. His men were devoted to him and perpetuated his memory long after his death.1 0 Left to himself, Tera´n might have spent years along the frontier, making careful observations of the stars, puzzling over unusual natural phenomena, and recording scientiﬁc data useful to the development of Texas. One can imagine him and the old revolutionary ‘‘Pedro Elı´as’’ Bean riding the boundary zone together with a pack mule, swapping memories, comparing the American and Mexican cultures, dropping in on the Indians whom Bean knew so well, marveling at the natural richness of Texas, and moseying off into the sunset. Political instability in both Mexico and Texas kept either man from enjoying such an idyllic life for long.\n\nintroduction\n\n13\n\nAmong the other things he meant to accomplish, Tera´n intended to create a map of Texas from his team’s carefully recorded information, but seemingly dropped the idea when he learned that Austin was well advanced in similar plans. Instead, Tera´n provided Austin with his very precise astronomical readings of latitude and longitude for various places, which Austin then incorporated into his published map of 1830. It was an important contribution to Austin’s work, and though he credited Tera´n with these observations at the foot of his map, Austin claimed sole authorship of the map and used it as a vehicle to spur further immigration to Texas—in the process weakening Mexico’s grasp on these fertile lands.11 Even after the tumultuous political climate of Mexico forced Tera´n to abandon the affairs of his Boundary Commission and head back to the Rio Grande, he still pursued the aims that had sent him north to Texas. For example, he kept diary entries for a reconnaissance upriver from Matamoros to Mier in the summer of 1829; because of its relevance to later events such as the Mier Expedition and the Mexican War, we have included this segment of Tera´n’s diary in our translation. It serves as an interesting counterpart to Berlandier’s 1829 and 1834 travels downriver along this same stretch of road, the details of which are already in print.1 2 Berlandier, after Tera´n’s suicide in 1832 and Sa´nchez’s death two years later, became the unofﬁcial custodian for most of the Boundary Commission’s records. It is to him that we owe the survival of this material and its placement in American archives. After Berlandier’s accidental drowning in 1851 these documents were obtained from his Mexican widow by an ofﬁcer of the U.S. Army who was visiting Brownsville and Matamoros.1 3 Prior to his death Berlandier worked constantly on ‘‘his’’ collection, recopying and polishing various drafts of the journals, reports, and miscellaneous records in his possession. A great deal of this documentation ended up at Yale University, but other notable pieces went to the Library of Congress, the Gilcrease Museum (Tulsa), the Smithsonian Institution, and the Gray Herbarium (Harvard University). Berlandier, with all of this material at his disposal, labored long over integrating the bits and pieces of information about northeastern Mexico into a cohesive whole worthy of comparison with Alexander von Humboldt’s work.1 4 Further, he produced such a multitude of slightly variant copies of his own diaries—and those of his associates on the Boundary Commission—that it is often difﬁcult to ascertain exactly what information derives from whom.\n\n14 texas by tera´ n\n\nThat Tera´n’s diary ﬁgured into Berlandier’s compilation process is undeniable, certainly with regard to the Indians of east Texas. Berlandier never personally visited these tribes, but he wrote a noteworthy study of their customs from the documents at hand, probably assisted by Sa´nchez’s sketches, notes, and recollections.1 5 Both Tera´n and Berlandier had an informed source on the Comanches and other Plains Indians: Col. Jose´ Francisco Ruiz, who spent eight years among these tribes in the aftermath of Gen. Joaquı´n de Arredondo’s brutal 1813 campaign against the anti-royalist rebels in Texas. Thereafter Ruiz acted as a sort of military Indian agent at Be´xar and wrote a report on the Plains tribes from his personal knowledge of them. This report is among Berlandier’s papers, now at Yale.1 6 Nonetheless, Berlandier continued to gather information on the Indians of Texas after the Boundary Commission effectively shut down in 1829–1830. We are indebted to him for his concise essay on the subject, as well as for the pictures of the Texas Indians that he assembled (evidently at his own expense) to illustrate his account. These charming watercolors are the work of Lino Sa´nchez y Tapia, though acknowledged as based on the now-missing original sketches of Berlandier and Jose´ Marı´a Sa´nchez.1 7 More maps, plans, views, and botanical illustrations were executed to accompany his ‘‘Voyage au Mexique,’’ which we must assume that Berlandier intended to publish— or at least hoped would someday be published.1 8 They are priceless documents for the historiography of Texas in the period 1828–1834, and we are fortunate that so much of Berlandier’s collection has escaped the ravages of time, especially ‘‘Texas por Tera´n: Su viage, 1828,’’ herein presented after these many years.\n\nS\n\nSan Antonio de Be´xar in 1828 As noted above, Tera´n’s diary does not describe San Antonio, but resumes only as he departs the city headed for east Texas. But the diaries of two of his assistants, draftsman Jose´ Marı´a Sa´nchez and botanist Jean-Louis Berlandier, have entries for the layover at the city between March 1 and April 13, 1828, offering us a fair picture of what was the capital of Texas until the union with the State of Coahuila. With the description by J. C. Clopper, a young trader from Cincinnati who visited Be´xar a few months after Tera´n’s Boundary Commission left, we have three perspectives of the town: from European, Mexican, and North American viewpoints.\n\nintroduction\n\n15\n\nSa´nchez, upon approaching the lower mission of Espada, felt considerable relief at his deliverance from the wilderness: ‘‘The view of this temple and the few small houses that surrounded it made an impression upon me that I cannot express. The sight of these dwellings brought forcefully to my mind the fact that I was still living among my countrymen.’’ 19 He and Berlandier commented on the other missions in the neighborhood of Be´xar, all of which were in the process of secularization at the time, and both men were caustic about the result. Of these four missions (Concepcio´n, San Juan, San Jose´, and Espada) Berlandier wrote: ‘‘Formerly celebrated, they are today abandoned to the mercy of the weather and have become private properties, sold for the proﬁt of the nation. Those who bought and maintain them are poor farmers, who live there in as great a state of misery as the indigenes whom the friars formerly shut up in them. At every moment the warring tribes kill some laborer, and they come almost constantly to steal the animals. . . . Although in ruins, these ediﬁces still bear the traces of a former splendor.’’ 20 Sa´nchez blamed their demise on the ‘‘very few’’ persons of judgment in the city, mainly property owners, who had clamored loudly, ‘‘Out with the friars, out with the good-for-nothings.’’ ‘‘Thus they abolished the missions and divided among themselves the lands they have not known how to cultivate and which they have left in a sad state of neglect.’’ 21 The ﬁfth mission, San Antonio de Valero, had been secularized in the 1790s and since converted into a military barracks. Berlandier gave the following description: An enormous battlement and some barracks are found there, as well as the ruins of a church which could pass for one of the loveliest monuments of the area, even if its architecture is overloaded with ornamentation like all the ecclesiastical buildings of the Spanish colonies. In the barracks of that mission lives a presidial company, long since come from Nueva Vizcaya [actually, Coahuila] from a presidio called Alamo de Parras, which has retained the same name in Texas. It is to be regretted that those who founded San Fernando de Be´xar did not join it to the presidio of the Alamo, located on a much more favorable site. Convinced of the dangers which another ﬂood could produce, recent authorities have several times proposed establishing the town there. Composed of some one hundred houses, the quarter of the Alamo is considered as part of San Fernando de Bexa´r. It is subject to the same authorities, and is separated only by the river.22 Berlandier and Sa´nchez described the city itself and its inhabitants in similar terms.\n\n16 texas by tera´ n\n\nThe streets of Be´xar [wrote Berlandier] are not very straight, not only because of the windings of the river which ﬂows to the east of the houses, but also because that admirable regularity characteristic of every town founded by the Castilians in the New World was disregarded there. Two large squares, separated from each other by the church and some houses, do not draw the traveler’s attention at all. The houses are for the greater part jacales [huts] roofed with thatch. The better ones are of a heavy and coarse construction, and the larger number have ﬁreplaces—in a word, there are already hints of a region lying outside the tropics. The inhabitants are gay and not very hardworking, and the dance is the chief amusement among the lower classes. Most of the families are linked to the military of the presidial companies, and it is to the great defect in the organization of these troops that the lack of agricultural progress observable in the region should be attributed. These soldiers, continually in the wilderness, or going from one presidio to another, cannot devote themselves to laboring in the ﬁeld. They content themselves with their pay, albeit this reaches their hands only after a thousand detours. The most comfortably off of the private citizens at the Mexican presidios are not lovers of farming; I have often seen them go elsewhere, sometimes even to the Anglo-American colonies, to seek the grain necessary for their subsistence. They much prefer to carry on a wretched trade, in which they have an infamous monopoly, to the detriment of the poor people—particularly since a law of the state excludes from retail trade all aliens who have not been naturalized.23 When they are reproached for their indolence, they allege that the Indians do not allow them to go out to cultivate the ﬁelds, which is partly true. But what I have never understood is why, although there are well-watered lands about the houses and the missions— even inside the presidio— one sees no planting there, whereas, moved by a principle of laziness, they go to sow de temporal [dry farming] ﬁelds of corn six or seven leagues from the dwellings (in localities truly exposed to attacks by the indigenes), solely in order not to have to take the trouble of watering the ﬁelds. From the brief idea which we have given of Be´xar it can easily be seen that, if it did not have a troop stationed there, the greatest of misery would prevail. Indeed, as the presidial companies are not paid in silver, money is extremely rare in the area. It is to the bad ﬁnancial administration of Mexico that one should attribute the audacity of the indigenes: because the soldiers are badly paid and frequently without horses, or else very badly mounted, the indigenes are sure that after they have committed a theft or a crime the soldiers will ﬁnd themselves unable to go in pursuit. The military have been without pay or clothing not only for months but even years, and they have been on campaigns against warring tribes in the meantime. They feed themselves by hunting game in the wilderness. When the commissioners of the ports send some few thousand piastres to these\n\nintroduction\n\n17\n\nwretches, there is always some speculator—guilty of the crime of embezzlement—who uses that money to buy merchandise to sell to the soldiers at an immense proﬁt. These petty tyrants abound in almost all the republic. They are especially common far from the central government, which cannot keep under surveillance the conduct of employees situated at such a great distance. During my sojourn in the Interior Provinces [states] I have witnessed actions which, under a well-regulated government, ought to lead their perpetrators to the gallows, at least. Ciudad de Be´xar resembles a large village more than the municipal seat of a department. There is no paved street and no public building. Trade with the Anglo-Americans, and the blending in to some degree of their customs, make the inhabitants of Texas a little different from the Mexicans of the interior, whom those in Texas call foreigners and whom they scarcely like because of the superiority which they recognize in them. In their gatherings, the women prefer to dress in the fashion of Louisiana, and by so doing they participate both in the customs of the neighboring nation and of their own. . . . Unfortunately for the creoles of Texas, the agricultural industry which they have shown in our times is so wretched that a monopoly over them by the American colonies founded in this department is to be feared. Several times have Be´xar and Goliad gone to seek grain and cattle in those colonies. They cannot vie in any respect with those industrious colonists, much more hardworking than they, who are supplied with implements useful to their labors. If the creoles have some well-built wagons, they are very few; in general, on seeing them one would believe oneself to have gone ten centuries backwards in the elementary and necessary arts. Their wagons [carts], which one would believe to have been built without any tools, ride on wheels made of one or two joined pieces which have a lenticular shape and which are drawn transversally by some large tree trunk. The rest of the wagon [cart] is nothing but an assemblage held together by ropes or rawhide; sometimes there is not even a wooden peg. Oxen, as badly harnessed as the wagons are defective, are the only animals used for draft and plowing. In regions where man struggles with the land, it is only when cultivation is extended and perfected that the herds multiply. In Texas the inhabitants ﬁnd themselves in completely opposite circumstances, for the raising of domestic animals on the immense plains covered with pasture is completely independent of the progress of agriculture. I agree that the great obstacle to the prosperity of the herds is the presence of the indigenes who steal or kill them. Nevertheless, those errant and nomadic tribes— enemies of the sedentary arts and of peace and [who are] continually at war with one another—raise horses. Lastly, the foreign colonies have had to overcome the same obstacles and today are full of such animals as oxen, cows, horses, pigs, etc.\n\n18 texas by tera´ n\n\nWhen the indigenes are at peace with the presidio, ranchos are found on all the banks of the rivers or streams. Independently of the missions they sow the most necessary grain, and the need for foodstuffs is less urgent. But these proprietors— more active than their fellow citizens— often lack ﬁeld hands at harvest time, even if paying good wages. At the time for cutting the sugarcane, I have seen a piastre paid to each worker, and even so there was difﬁculty in ﬁnding a sufﬁcient number. At Be´xar as at Laredo, at Goliad as at [San Juan Bautista del] Rı´o Grande, and in most of the presidios everything is military, for this is the most pleasant life for the indolent. . . . I shall content myself with pointing out that the inhabitants [of Be´xar] are not at all farmers. More than a century after it was colonized the region remains static, and it will never be covered with ﬁelds except in more active and harder-working hands. What surer wealth than the products of a ﬂourishing agriculture? By coastal trade, they would send their cotton to the United States and their grain to Campeche, as all the [Anglo-American] colonists have learned to do. But, ever disdaining what lies under their noses, the inhabitants of Be´xar (and even some Anglo-Americans), struck by the immense riches which have come out of Mexico, are forever searching for mines. At Be´xar one rarely hears talk about a well-cultivated ﬁeld or a splendid harvest, but rather hears it said that here or there—in a ﬂuvial terrain covered with fossils—there is a gold or silver mine. So avid are they for metal, the cause of human frailty, that one sees people buying from the Indians granite from the cordilleras of the interior, because they believe that the ﬂecks of mica are small scales of silver. It is perhaps due to false rumors about the existence of mines of precious metal that many adventurers from the north have several times tried to incite small revolutions, because the ignorant have imagined that gold and silver ﬂow there in large waves.24 Berlandier devoted much attention to the rather complex military situation at San Antonio. The commanding general of the eastern interior states (Nuevo Leo´n, Tamaulipas, and Coahuila y Texas) was Anastasio Bustamante, who had entertained Tera´n and his troop at Laredo. In charge of the Department of Texas was Col. Antonio Elosu´a,25 a career military ofﬁcer who had only assumed his position at Be´xar in December 1827; he reported directly to General Bustamante. A monthly tally of the troops in Texas dated February 1, 1828, reveals that Elosu´a had under his command 527 men, divided into eight companies hailing from different Mexican states.26 Over 300 of these soldiers were dispersed on various assignments, however, and it is difﬁcult to say exactly how many men were garrisoned at Be´xar at any particular time. Nor does this total\n\nintroduction\n\n19\n\nseem to include the regular army troops stationed at La Bahı´a (Goliad) and Nacogdoches. Further complicating the troop-strength picture was the ‘‘National Civil Militia,’’ sometimes called the ‘‘Be´xar Civil Militia,’’ whose captain was Gaspar Flores.27 An April 1832 summary shows 164 cavalrymen in this unit but the number ﬂuctuated widely; an October 1827 report has only 79 men enrolled. Nonetheless, it was a prestigious outﬁt, and service in the local civil militia exempted members from being ‘‘drafted’’ into the regular army. These militiamen soon played a prominent role in Indian ﬁghting and went on to see action in the Texas Revolution (on both sides). Other such militia units were organized at La Bahı´a, Victoria, Nacogdoches, and San Felipe de Austin. It is generally agreed that they were more effective at frontier defense than the army units sent to Texas for this purpose.28 To Berlandier’s picture of Be´xar, Sa´nchez added the following: The streets are not exactly straight, for they curve at various points, and the buildings, though many are of stone, show no beauty, nor do they have conveniences. There are two squares, almost joined together, being divided merely by the space occupied by the parochial church, but neither one is worthy of notice. The commerce, which is carried on by foreigners and two or three Mexicans, is very insigniﬁcant, but the monopoly of it is very evident. I could cite many instances to prove by assertion [that foreigners illegally dominate commerce?], but I do not wish to be accused of ulterior motives. Although the soil is very rich, the inhabitants do not cultivate it because of the danger incurred from Indian attacks as soon as they get any distance from the houses, as the Indians often lurk in the surrounding country, coming in the silence of the night without fear from the troops, for by the time the latter notice the damage done it is already too late. No measures can be taken for the maintenance of a continuous watch on account of the sad condition of the troops, especially since they lack all resources. For months, and even years at times, these troops have gone without salary or supplies, constantly in active service against the Indians, dependent for their subsistence on buffalo meat, deer, and other game they may be able to secure with great difﬁculty. The government, nevertheless, has not helped their condition in spite of repeated and frequent remonstrances. If any money arrives, it disappears instantly, for infamous hands are not lacking to take it and give the poor soldiers goods at double their normal value in exchange for what they have earned, suffering the inclemencies of the weather while these inhuman tyrants slept peacefully in their beds. I am not exaggerating; on the contrary, I keep silent about many worse\n\n20 texas by tera´ n\n\nthings I could say. The character of the people is care-free, they are enthusiastic dancers, very fond of luxury, and the worst punishment that can be inﬂicted upon them is work. Doubtless, there are some individuals, out of the 1,425 that make up the total population, who are free from these failings, but they are very few.29 Even if a foreign inﬂuence was creeping in, political power at San Antonio was still in the hands of Mexicans and would remain so for some years after the Revolution. The municipal authority was the ayuntamiento (town council), recently elected and led by alcalde (mayor) Juan Martı´n de Veramendi.30 A prominent citizen whose house had formerly been the governor’s residence, Veramendi later became vice-governor of the state and James Bowie’s father-in-law. His regidores (councilmen) were Manuel Flores, Luciano Navarro, and Jose´ Marı´a Ca´rdenas; Juan Angel Seguı´n was elected sı´ndico procurador (city attorney), and Ignacio Arocha acted as secretary to the ayuntamiento.31 The jefe polı´tico, or political chief, of the Department of Texas in 1828 was Ramo´n Mu´squiz,32 who took over the job from Jose´ Antonio Saucedo at the beginning of the year. Mu´squiz reported events in Texas to the man who appointed him, Jose´ Marı´a Viesca, the governor of Coahuila y Texas. Viesca, who resided at the state capital in Saltillo (also called Leona Vicario during this period), was generally favorable to the interests of Texas. In the state congress, or legislature, Texas had but one deputy until the constitution of 1827 was adopted, thereafter having two. At this time they were Jose´ Antonio Navarro and Miguel Arciniega, both natives of Be´xar. To them fell the difﬁcult chore of advancing legislation of vital importance to Texas in a capital far removed from the frontier and its unique problems. Also, they were outnumbered by deputies primarily concerned with the interests of Coahuila, not those of the vast undeveloped ‘‘department’’ to the north. In his diary, Sa´nchez related an ‘‘amusing instance’’ of a state deputy ‘‘who in 1828 wrote to a friend in Nacogdoches begging him to tell him about the region from the Guadalupe [River] on [eastward], and about all that was noteworthy, in order that he might be able to speak about them in the legislature when the occasion arose. Admirable fathers of their country! Alas, wretched republic!’’ This may have been an exaggeration, but Sa´nchez thought that blind indifference on both the state and federal levels would result in the loss of Texas to the ‘‘ambitious North Americans’’ who had already ‘‘taken possession of practically all the eastern part of Texas, in most cases without the [knowledge or] permission of the authorities.’’ 33 Berlandier, from a more cosmopolitan\n\nintroduction\n\n21\n\nEuropean background, was less outspoken on these political issues than native son Sa´nchez. His mind unclouded by such dire prognostications of the future, J. C. Clopper arrived at Be´xar in the summer and beheld what to him was an alien culture that he had not seen elsewhere in Texas. Though critical of the backwardness he found at San Antonio, compared to the bulging industrial muscle of Ohio and Pennsylvania, young Clopper was nonetheless charmed by the city—and especially by its ladies. His account follows.34 We cross the Salou [Salado], a small stream within ﬁve miles of San Antonio. Musquite prairie continues; the earth here is covered with small smooth grey ﬂint stones from an ounce to two or three pounds in size. The land is ascending for a couple of miles, when we are on an exceeding high country. Two miles further and we come to a Spanish fort and magazine commenced some years since and left unﬁnished. This stands on the summit of the circular ridge within one mile of San Antonio, commanding a view of the town and the vast plain on which it stands. From this spot San Antonio has a very striking resemblance to one of Uncle Sam’s handsomest and largest country villages.35 The curious traveller feels stimulated to urge on his jaded steed, satisﬁed from this ﬁrst blush that he shall be transported with a nearer view of its proportions, its lofty domes, its elegant simplicity and natural beauties. He hurriedly descends the eminence in a fever of body and mind— comes to a little canal [acequia] which he beholds with rapture, extending itself abroad o’er the thirsty land and watering beautifully verdant and ﬂourishing ﬁelds of corn. Enters a regular avenue of huge cotton wood trees 36—thinks of the grand Avenue leading to U. Sam’s house [and] asks who it was who so slandered this people by saying that they are little superior to the lowest grade of the human family. Surely the labour and utility of these canals— the beauty and taste displayed in the planting of this avenue—is a ﬂat contradiction to it all. He passes on, thro’ the midst of this friendly shade. On the right stands a massy pile of ruins. For what purpose were these stones piled one upon another and why were they thrown down[?]. This he discovers was one of the strong holds of Popish delusion, in which the Royalists in 1810 –1811 sought refuge from the avenging fury of the Patriots who battered down the mighty walls with their cannon; it is now a garrison [the Alamo].37 A few yds. before him he sees the exceedingly serpentine San Antonio [River], coming winding around the town and gliding by as if hurried with important despatches to the Gulph of Mexico. He looks with mortiﬁcation and disgust at the order of architecture which suddenly presents itself on his left.38 He crosses the little river and beholds the same wigwam style of building, which constitutes\n\n22 texas by tera´ n\n\nthe principal part of the town. He proceeds on, ﬁnds that the streets intersect each other very irregularly, [and he] presently enters the public Square. This is laid off at right angles, being about 150 by 300 yards, in the centre of which stands the Church, a large clumsy stone building that seems to have been standing for Centuries. It has a steeple of the same materials, very well modelled of octagonal form; in this is hung 2 bells kettle-toned and of different sizes. These have their tongues tied to ropes and are made to bellow most horribly by two barbarous boys who stand close by and jirk these engines of torture to the utter dismay and confusion of the astounded stranger perhaps 40 times per diem. This Church has also a skylight dome at the opposite end. In the midst of this Square the traveller stands and contemplates the buildings around him. He had before entering been disgusted with their dwellings that [were] ﬁrst met—being formed of branches of the Musquite tree set up end ways in all the zigzag varieties of their growth, having the interstices daubed with mud. These hollow squares are thatched over with the swamp ﬂag [reeds] and stand ready to receive their inhabitants, who carry in a few chests, a palate [pallet] or two, and some dried skins and the mansion is furnished.39 But the public square presents to the stranger’s eye a more solemn picture: each side is formed of one unbroken solid wall, except where the streets pass thro’. These walls have doors at neighbourly or family distances, opening into what may more properly be termed cells than rooms, as few of them have windows. None indeed have sashes, nor is there a pane of glass in the town. They seem more like port holes than windows, having bars like a prison grate or dark shutters. These walls show no roof above them but seem to stand as we may suppose do the ruins of an earth-shaken or sacked and burnt City after the buildings had been battered down to the last story by a destroying and victorious enemy. These walls are about 18 or 20 ft. in height [and] the roof is invisible from the outside. [It] is formed of huge cedar logs as rafters on which are laid small boards; these beams have a descending inclination from the back walls outwardly so as to rest upon the front walls about 21⁄2 ft. below their height. The roof is then covered with a cement from 8 inches to a foot in thickness, from off which the rain is conducted by wooden troughs passing thro’ the walls and projecting 3 or 4 ft. into the Square. Thro’ this square and the heart of the town runs a canal for the purpose of watering the garden lots, as the water by small outlets may be conducted from this to all parts of the place. The traveller hears around him a confusion of unknown tongues: the red natives of the forests in their different guttural dialects; the swarthy Spaniard of a scarce brighter hue; the voluble Frenchman; a small number of the sons of Green Erin; and a goodly few of Uncle Sam’s Nephews or half expatriated sons. He feels himself now for the ﬁrst time in his life a stranger truly in a foreign land and enters a door for a short residence that he may discover\n\nintroduction\n\n23\n\nsomething more of this people—but what he has seen we will let him make known in his own proper person. I ﬁnd that Father has obtained a house and opened his goods . . . business tolerably brisk, proﬁts moderate. Some difﬁculty in dealing with the Mexicans, not understanding their language. [I] form an acquaintance with two or three families [and] become somewhat a favourite with our landlady, who has two pretty daughters. Accompany them several times to the fandangos—waltzes and reels the principal forms of dance among them, always performed in the streets. Men do not select their partners—this is more gallantly left to the ladies, the former placing themselves in a line on the ﬂoor. When the latter arise and face the object of their choice, it sometimes happens that two or more make the same selection and then there is a good deal of elbowing among the fair ones. There are always managers to regulate matters. [I am] often solicited but never participate in the intricacies and mazes of their ﬁgures. Delicacy forms but a small part of female character in San Antonio. Their very language seems almost to forbid the cultivation of this most beautiful of the Graces. Unmarried girls are very vigilantly kept from all intercourse whatever with the other sex unless one of the parents be present. Soon as married they are scarcely the same creatures—giving the freest indulgence to their naturally gay and enthusiastic dispositions, as if liberated from all moral restraint. The complexion of the native mexican is a shade brighter than that of the aborigines of the country. The men are not generally well formed in feature or person [and] are extremely ignorant in all the advanced arts of civilization, the majority not being able to read. They are astonishingly expert in the management of horses—not surpassed perhaps by any other people on the Globe. They are completely the slaves of Popish Superstition and despotism, [being] distinguished for their knavery and breach of faith. The softer sex are generally handsome in person and regular in feature and of rather a brighter hue than the men— eyes black, sparkling, holding most intelligent converse when disposed in the still language of the affections. Wear [their] long black hair handsomely adjusted into curls and puffs on public occasions. They are remarkably addicted to dress and Jewelry and on festal occasions appear as richly arrayed as any females I have ever seen, exhibiting no small degree of taste and are certainly among the vainest of their sex. But all this show lasts no longer than till they reach their homes, where they instantly appear as if they might soon be numbered on the Charity list.40 The Gochapines [Gachupines] or European Spaniards that dwell among them are exceptions to these remarks. These are mostly intelligent and wealthy —became acquainted with a daughter of one of them. And often have I regretted my ignorance of their bewitching language. She was of the middle size, her person of the ﬁnest symmetry, moving through the mazes of the fandango with all the graces\n\n24 texas by tera´ n\n\nthat distinguish superiority of person, of mind, and of soul. Her face was perhaps not sufﬁciently oval to be of that form most admired as the model of beauty [but] her features were beautiful, forming in their combination an expression that ﬁxed the eye of the observer as with a spell. Her complexion was of the loveliest—the snowy brightness of her well-turned forehead beautifully contrasting with the carnation tints of her cheeks. A succession of smiles were continually sporting around her mouth; her pouting cherry lips were irresistible and even when closed seemed to have utterance. Her eye—but I have no such language as seemed to be spoken by it, else might I tell how dangerous was it to meet its lustre and feel its quick thrilling scrutiny of the heart as tho’ the very ﬁre of its expression was conveyed with its beamings. I felt lonely and sad as a stranger in that place, and a vision so lovely, coming so unexpectedly before me, could not fail to awaken tender recollections and altogether make an impression not soon to be forgotten. The 16th of Sept., the anniversary of the Declaration of Mexican Independence, was celebrated with a great deal of order and unanimity and considerable enthusiasm of feeling. A stage was erected in the public Square very much resembling a huge bedstead with a tester and curtains reaching down like drapery to the platform and made fast to the four posts, at the tops of which were ﬂying their own National ﬂag, that of The United States, of Great Britain, and of France— while that of Old Spain formed a carpeting for the stair case ascending to the stage. The Soldiery and citizens, both ladies and gentlemen, paraded the streets in the afternoon. In the evening an oration was delivered from the stage by a Priest—was told it was badly delivered and apparently with but very little effect on the multitude. A large table was set covered with wines and other liquors, sweetmeats, etc. ‘‘pro bono publico.’’ The Square was then lighted up with lamps and candles and everything cleared off for the enjoyment of the ‘‘dearly loved fandango,’’ ﬁve or six setts of it at once. Never before did I witness so large a collection of such happy beings. Thus passed off their day of Independence.41 Continue to be [by] myself ‘‘chief cook and bottle washer’’ for our company of Invalids in San Antonio. Have some amusements in teaching the [Mexican] girls A.B.C., and learning their language with them. Old lady no longer afraid to trust them to my discretion, [so I] have opportunities of witnessing their manner of living. Every family has in the yard an oven built in form of a cone solely for the purpose of roasting the heads, legs, and tails of animals. On such occasions all the connexion round [the neighbors] are invited [and] skins are spread on the earth. When these delicacies are thrown down in the centre of the waiting circles . . . every one that is fortunate enough to have a knife makes a lively use of it till the whole head is fairly demolished and as many of the legs as can be possibly crowded after it. When they have to pay for their meat in market a very little is made to sufﬁce a family; it is generally cut into a kind of hash with nearly as many peppers as there are pieces of meat—this is all stewed together.\n\nintroduction\n\n25\n\nThe way in which they obtain their bread is worthy of notice. They raise only Indian corn—this is soaked in lime or ley [lye] till the rind of the grain is taken off. It is then ground on a concave stone about 12 inches wide and 20 in length with legs cut to it 6 or 8 inches long—the hinder being somewhat longest so as to give the stone an inclination from the body of the grinder. A handful of corn is laid on this and masticated with another stone resembling a roller but cut so as to ﬁt the concavity. This operation is always performed by the women, and in a kneeling posture—they generally go over it a third time. If they wish to treat their friends with a very white bread, the whole family gather round the pot of corn and grain by grain bite off the little black speck at the end of the germ. When the dough is all ready, a small portion at a time is taken and patted in the hands till thin as a ﬂannel cake. This cake-making operation is always accompanied with tunes and words that seem peculiarly to chime in with the patting ceremony; it reminded me very much of our tuneful ladies in a ﬁnery starching scene. These cakes are baked on sheet iron and when eaten hot with butter or gravy are very palatable, but soon get tough. They answer the natives for spoons with which they all dip into the same dish of meat and peppers prepared as above, one spoon not lasting longer than to supply with two mouthfuls when a new one is made use of.42 Very few families are supplied with the common necessary kitchen and household utensils—not even with chairs, sitting on skins spread upon the earthen ﬂoors of their dwellings. Thus live the commonality throughout the northern provinces of Mexico. The population of San Antonio is differently estimated from three to ﬁve thousand—they must rapidly improve with their increasing intercourse with the Americans. There is kept up here a garrison of three or four hundred soldiers 43 for the defence of the place against the Indians but more particularly that very powerful tribe the Cumanches, who are supposed to be 6 or 7,000 warriors strong and are continually at war with the Mexicans in some part of the Province [State] of Texas. Saw about 20 or 30 of this tribe, who came in to trade; they are ﬁne looking men—and the largest in frame, considered collectively, I ever saw. [They] are remarkably proud and overbearing toward the Mexicans whom they heartily despise. Allways on horseback in their travels and warfare—are expert horsemen—use the bow, the lance, and the shield, not having many ﬁrearms among them. Their mode of attack is generally by arranging the lances in front, the guns in the center, and bows in the rear—their horses at full speed, accompanied with the fury and yellings of demons. They are among the bravest and most warlike of the Mexican tribes—friendly in their disposition toward Americans and dreading the deadly riﬂe. The Lapans [Lipans] are a branch of the Cumanches and the next most formidable tribe in Texas.44 These two tribes range from the Brazos River to the Rio Grande and the mountainous country south of Santa Fee but are rarely known to molest American traders in those countries.\n\n26 texas by tera´ n\n\n[The people] have [an] abundance of ﬁgs, peaches, and melons here. Very little attention [is] paid to the cultivation of fruits tho’ it is a climate very congenial to most of tropical productions. [I] fall from a grape tree [and am] very seriously hurt. [We] sell off our goods at auction—make arrangements for journeying to the east. Take a ride with Captn. Lindsay toward the head of the San Antonio river which rises 6 or 7 miles above the town, or rather gushes a full-sized river of the lesser magnitude from under one of the immense hills north of the town.45 We become bewildered among the hills, woods, and ravines and are disappointed in seeing the romantic spectacle but feel in a measure compensated by witnessing a few miles farther N the most picturesque and pleasing scenes of country that ever gratiﬁed our views: immense hills, extensive vales, barren rocks, luxuriance of verdure, deer starting up from before us and bounding over the adjacent landscape, blue mountains towering in the distance, as it were to shut out the view of inﬁnitude—the whole lovely in its original wildness, and most impressively imposing in sublimity. Such is the scenery around San Antonio—forming an immense and complete amphitheatre 6 or 7 miles in diameter, within which nearly the whole plain is a rich and productive soile and may be watered at any time of the year by canals of little expense from the San Antonio river. And certainly there never was a stream better calculated for the purpose of manufacturing machinery, but all is in the possession of a people too ignorant and indolent for enterprise and too poor and dependent were they otherwise capacitated. Begin to understand the ‘‘common parlance’’ of the place tolerably well. Landlady and girls most willing to assist me—am asked all about my country, how far it is, how many relations I have, what religion they profess. Tell them some were Roman Catholics [at which they were] greatly delighted. By the by, this family are pretty strict in their observance of their forms—repetitions of ‘‘Our fathers’’—‘‘Ave Marias’’—‘‘Credos’’ etc., for indeed the religion of this place is understood by very few if any as a gracious affection of the heart and soul but a mere requisition of personal mortiﬁcation in forms of penances etc. Old lady very anxious to know when I would visit her country again; tell her perhaps in two or three years. [She] informs me by that time her prettiest daughter will be marriageable and wished I would bring her some Jewelry with me. Gives me a brass ring with a blue glass sett as a remembrance from her daughter, whose delicate ﬁngers at the same time were ornamented with more than one of gold— put it carefully in my pocket, however, seemingly much ﬂattered by the distinguished compliment. On the evening of 3rd October leave San Antonio for Sanfelipe on the Brassos, Mr. Gregg having started some days previous with a company. Father, Doctr. Patrick, Captn. Lindsay, Myself, and a traveller forming our Company. As we ascend the hill one mile from town, look back and behold the sun taking his\n\nintroduction\n\n27\n\ndeparture also behind the western hills—not a cloud to hinder the warm greeting of his farewell beams, the evening as tranquil and serene as I ever witnessed— our hearts danced within us and our mouths spoke the gladness thereof. Not even the great distance [or] the toils and dangers that lay between us and our homes could lessen the joyousness of our feelings, for we felt for the ﬁrst time that the slow measured steps of our horses were now bearing us toward the land we loved best. We close our prelude to Tera´n’s diary with a lengthy letter that the general wrote to President Guadalupe Victoria on March 28, 1828, almost a month after his arrival at Be´xar and two weeks before heading east on his inspection. This letter is obviously a rough draft, with many words and sometimes sentences crossed out. Although there is no archival conﬁrmation that Tera´n ever sent the letter, we include it as evidence of his thoughts about Texas in the formative stage, before being tempered by ﬁrsthand experience and his own direct observation. The extent to which the ideas expressed sprang from his close friends in the governing halls of Mexico, or were derived from inﬂuential tejano citizens at Be´xar, is a matter of conjecture. Nonetheless, it will be seen that Tera´n had some notion of what he was facing in Texas and had already reached some conclusions about steps that must be taken to avoid losing the territory.\n\nS\n\nlet ter 1 tera´ n to president guadalupe victoria be´ xar, march 28, 1828 46 Most Excellent Sen˜or President Don Guadalupe Victoria Be´jar, March 28, 1828 My dear sir and friend of my greatest attention and respect: Since I left that capital I have set for myself as a rule that would contribute to the success of the matters that have been entrusted to me on this journey, to concern myself only with observing and collecting information, without coming to any conclusions until, returned to the tranquillity of my home, I could confront all the materials that I had gathered, subjecting them to a more rigorous examination. By this means I intended to demonstrate that during the entire course of my expedition I had possessed the calm and dispassion that contribute so\n\n28 texas by tera´ n\n\nfigure 4 A page from Tera´n’s letter to President Guadalupe Victoria written on March 28, 1828, while at San Antonio (translated as our Letter 1), from the general’s letter book and presumably in his own hand.

But situated in Be´jar and forecasting from my present situation what the future might hold, I ﬁnd myself compelled to abandon that principle and report to you immediately on matters that I wish would allow for more time. But the political situation of this country [Texas] grants no time period. Do not be surprised if, in a matter of such gravity, I make use of the private communication that you have granted me, sending letters instead of ofﬁcial reports through the ministries, because [deleted: ‘‘it is my experience with that of Foreign Relations that they do not reply’’ ] you will recall having told me before my departure that I should deal personally with you in everything regarding my difﬁcult commission. I am ready, nevertheless, to inform by ofﬁcial report as much as may be desired, and [deleted: ‘‘whatever may be the form in which it is received by the ministries’’ ]. Tejas, that is, an extension of territory greater than the states of Mexico, Puebla, Quere´taro, Guanajuato, and Valladolid [Morelia] together, is one of the three departments of the state of Coahuila, or of perhaps the most imperfect political division known. Its population consists of [deleted: ‘‘thirty’’] 25 thousand savages, eight thousand North Americans with their slaves, and four to ﬁve thousand Mexicans.4 7 The latter, nonetheless, are the owners of [deleted: ‘‘all’’] the land. Its fertility is well known, and doubtless there is no exaggeration in what is said about it, if one refers to the eastern part, which is traversed by rivers. But few of these come from far in the interior, and thus one must presume that the western part has lands of little use, such as some of those I have seen on the banks of the Rı´o Bravo del Norte under similar circumstances, that is, because they lack streams. The savages of different nations are scattered everywhere, but their main forces— or those of the most populous nation, which is the Comanche, with its two types: Yamparicas and Tanemues [Tanimas?]— live in mobile camps to the west and north.48 They maintain their life and independence in different ways, but in every way natural, and they contribute very little industry. Those who live on the seacoast are ﬁshermen. Some tribes located on the banks of the Colorado River of Texas [Tera´n may mean the Rojo here] and the Brazos de Dios have settled in villages with agricultural [land] that they abandon each winter to go on the hunt, and they know how to sustain themselves with seeds and crops. But these [nations] are few in number with respect to the vast majority, which subsists only on hunting. It seems very odd that the most precarious\n\n30 texas by tera´ n\n\nresource [the hunt] should be the one that feeds the greatest number. But we are speaking of the northern region of Mexico, or of thousands of square leagues of prairies where bison graze and within which are the migratory limits of these animals. Buffalo do not suffer from cold at 45 degrees of latitude nor from the heat of the nearby tropics; they are always on the move in the region in between, seeking in the variety of the climate solutions for the ﬂuctuations in the seasons. The American savages follow after and slaughter them. This is the greatest meat market that nature provides, and it should be noted that in the winter the savages living beyond and on either side of the region where the buffalo live come following them to the south, and the Mexican savage heads north to encounter the herds. In their movements on the hunt, tribes of men who never knew of one another before often ﬁnd themselves face to face, and in such encounters they usually make war. The need to continue [the hunt?] then leads them to harry the [enemy] territory. Thus, one sees alternatively expeditions of warriors traveling from south to north, or from north to south, invading their adversaries. Wars between the savages [ba´rbaros], as between civilized men, end with peace accords, and when this takes place the tribe from the north now knows a territory in the south that is less inhospitable than its own. They come to like it and ﬁnally occupy it. I have data to conﬁrm that this is an exact history of our frontiers, and that through incidents of this nature in Tejas they suffer the calamity of the sudden appearance of tribes whose existence was unknown. In the space of ten years have come the Chariticas, or dog eaters, tribe, as well as four others about which I have gathered reliable information.49 Whether it is the product of the rational progress of the Comanches or a notion born of instinct, the fact is that they do not wage wars of extermination on other savages. Campaigns involving large numbers of warriors and lasting several months usually have no other consequence than the stealing of a few animals and the death of a single adversary, with no motive for such moderation other than saving their blood and that of the enemy. From this we can infer, in every sense of the word, that only civilized men have such a reputation. The weaker tribes that cause the Comanches no concern are added through alliance. By allowing them to live independently distributed into camps of two or three hundred persons, the Comanches teach them their own martial habits and help to improve their condition. The Chariticas, Caihuas [Kiowas], and others I have mentioned had no quadrupeds for their use other than dogs when they arrived in Mexican territory. In a short time\n\nintroduction\n\n31\n\nthey were seen to convey their tents and property on pack animals and to make war on horseback the same as the Comanches, who previously were their adversaries. According to the inquiries I have made, the Sonsores, a large tribe extending from northern New Mexico to the Paciﬁc Ocean, were not familiar with ﬁrearms until the year 1814, when they came into contact with the savages of Tejas. The soil of this province is so appealing to outside tribes that some of them who come with the Charitica e´migre´s—who have the custom of burying their dead in a given place—are seen to carry their dead until, on the journey they make each year to their old country, they ﬁnally deposit them in a permanent cemetery. The Comanches currently are occupied in driving their principal enemies, the Huasa´s, from the Mexican frontier. To judge from the facts, one can believe that this is a powerful tribe that resists any alliance with the Comanches, even though it lacks horses and beasts of burden. Our neighbors to the north [the United States] already make contact with it through their settlements west of the Mississippi, for which reason it is to be hoped that the Huasa´s will agree to peace with the Comanches and come to make their camps on the soil of wretched Tejas. The key to the frontier in the country traversed only by the savages has come to be in the hands of the Comanches.50 [This paragraph crossed out: ‘‘East of the Mexican boundary other causes create the same scenario: the civilization of North America pushes the savages out of the forests that they have inhabited for centuries, and they rush to seek in the wilderness of Mexico an asylum for their independence. This movement, of such importance to the history of humankind, is surprising to one who observes it close at hand.’’] I shall not dwell long on what is happening to the east of the Mexican border, because it is already well known that the civilization of North America has removed the wild tribes from the forests that they have inhabited for many centuries. Zealous of their independence and forced from the land they once trod, the savages rush with weapons in hand to seek in Tejas an asylum for their freedom and settlements in keeping with the different levels of industry that they have achieved. Alongside these savage men who everywhere assault the Mexican frontier, arrogating to themselves the rights given them by the need to survive [and] sustained by their weapons, invaders of another kind are seen to arrive carrying the tools of a very advanced industry. Without respect for borders or boundaries of pure convention, they choose the\n\n32 texas by tera´ n\n\nbest land. Nature tells them that [the land] is theirs, because, in effect, everyone can appropriate what does not belong to anyone or what is not claimed by anyone. When the occasion arises, they will claim the irrefutable rights of ﬁrst possession. The laws of Mexico have provided for its territorial integrity, prohibiting foreigners from settling within twenty leagues of the frontier or ten from the coast unless permitted by the Supreme Government of the Union. But in the ﬁrst place, that line which is the terminus from which the count is to be made is not marked out. Even those farmers operating in good faith would insist that they are not geographers, nor could any law on earth oblige them to be such, and that if Mexicans want their borders to be respected then they should take the trouble to mark them or to post people to guard them. But leaving aside this question, I must say that law is ignored, and ofﬁcial documents that I have obtained prove that more than two thousand foreigners are living on the best lands on the border. None of them has requested permission or settled more than twenty leagues from the border. In the present state of affairs there is no one to demand that they obey the laws, because the predominance of North Americans in Tejas inspires mistrust in the authorities, and they fear what no one can prevent through excessive zeal. The current situation is maintained, but at the cost of tolerance and indulgence, or more clearly, in many places (the most important ones, to be precise), acts of government cannot be carried out lest they provoke an uprising that inevitably will accomplish the expulsion of Mexicans from Tejas.51 I do not wish to refer to the established settlements, because on this point we are dealing with political considerations that give rise to endless disputes. But I must say in all frankness that everyone I have talked to here who is aware of the state of the country and devoted to its preservation is convinced, and has convinced me, that these colonies, whose industriousness and economy receive such praise, will be the cause for the Mexican federation to lose Tejas unless measures are taken soon. According to the [colonization] contracts made with the state government, in the eastern part of Tejas—which, as I have said, is the most fertile and whose rivers provide for the export of crops from the Trinity River to the Sabine for a distance of 180 leagues—there no longer exists any stretch of land where a Mexican family might locate.52 The entire coast is given over to the colonists, without the ten-league restriction prescribed by law preventing the problems that can arise from such a great mistake. The coast of Tejas is very low; marshes and ﬂooding make the terrain uninhabitable for more than ten leagues [inland]. Why is it\n\nintroduction\n\n33\n\nthat the town and presidio of La Bahı´a are 12 leagues from the anchorage that gives them their name? Let me be shown one single inhabitant, not a ﬁsherman, of any nation who has been able to settle within 10 leagues of the sea. Precisely just beyond that forbidden terrain lies the most ﬂourishing and productive land, and as I have said, all of it has been contracted. Fortunately for the Mexican nation, however, all the empresarios save one have been men without resources who have been unable to carry out their agreements. Their time limits are about to expire, and it is to be hoped that we will not commit such a folly again. If it is bad for a nation to have vacant lands and wilderness, it is worse without a doubt to have settlers who cannot abide by some of its laws and by the restrictions that [the nation] must place on commerce. They soon become discontented and thus prone to rebellion, and everything becomes graver still if those people have strong and indissoluble connections with a neighboring government that would be lacking in the ﬁne moral qualities that characterize it if it looked with indifference, when necessary, upon the misfortunes of thousands of its subjects, who also would elicit the sympathy of their countrymen. This is a private sentiment that must be seen as a recourse in the policies of a people’s government such as theirs and ours. I believe I am not mistaken when I state that it is preferable [to have] a wilderness that bit by bit will cease to be so, in the hope of a time not far off when the progress of a population such as Mexico’s will spread over its empty lands. By now the Mexican inhabitants of Tejas would have settled a quarter of this wilderness, but their history since the time of their [ﬁrst] settlement shows that they have suffered numerous misfortunes, most of which emanated from government mistakes. I return to [the subject of ] the colony. The empresario Austin,53 who had some resources at his disposal, took the best land that exists anywhere in Tejas. His devotion and industry have made that land very productive. The colony that he has created contains 1,800 individuals. This does not include the slaves, because [the settlers] conceal the number of the latter, but it must be considerable if one notes that a single colonist named Gros 54 keeps 150 blacks to cultivate his suerte [grant] of land. The ﬁrst advantage that must be noted in the land chosen by Austin is that it is not frequented by the most powerful tribes of savages. Only the savages on the coast attacked the settlement, and since the North Americans understand war with the savages better than do our Mexicans, they dealt [the Indians] swift punishment, striking back ten times for every blow they received. If [the Indians] killed a settler, a large party of settlers would set out to hunt\n\n34 texas by tera´ n\n\ndown and kill ten of the tribe, of any age or sex. By such behavior they have reduced the tribe of Tarancahuases [Karankawas] such that no one speaks of it [today], because it seems to have been exterminated.55 It is also hard for the savages to attack the settlers because their location is more systematic. They live in well-constructed houses on the same land that they cultivate and close enough [together] to provide for defense. They domesticate their cattle, which allows them to be kept in an area over which [the settlers] can extend their watch. Industry in this colony is outstanding, not only in the cultivation of the land for the harvesting of cotton and other cereals except wheat, and for raising cattle, but also in artisanry. They make wool and cotton textiles of fair quality; they have machines to gin cotton and to saw lumber to make planks. They sell their products in Be´jar, La Bahı´a, and Nacodoches [Nacogdoches], and they also go to the sea by the Brazos River. Despite this, the empresario [Austin] is not satisﬁed with the progress of the settlement and complains of losses; two of the colony’s boats coming from Louisiana with big cargoes wrecked on the coast. Another [boat] that they sent to Yucata´n with a load of cereals at the invitation, they say, of the national government was turned away because it was foreign in origin. It put in at various places on the coast to sell its cargo, and at every one it was rejected; ﬁnally, all of it was lost on the return trip. [Austin] complains about the state government’s measures with regard to denying him permission to sell the land to the settlers [and] about not being permitted to bring in slaves. [He complains] about the prohibition against the introduction of ﬂour from the North, either for consumption or to sell in other places, as was done before and is done now, of course, because in Be´jar they eat bread from no other ﬂour. [Austin complains, ﬁnally] that [the settlers] do not grow and sell tobacco, and [about] other less notable matters. For all these reasons, the colonies here are considered to be in a state of discontent, and the empresario in one of bankruptcy. With the recent example of the revolution of Nacodoches, whose only cause was the discontent of the empresario Edwards because the state government justly demanded that he fulﬁll the conditions of his contract, there is constant fear of an upheaval, and the traveler hears talk of little else.56 I have spoken of the savages and the foreigners and now I must consider the situation of the Mexicans. Those who live in Tejas, whose number surely totals less than four thousand souls, constitute the three towns of Be´jar, La Bahı´a, and Nacodoches. The grand resource for the subsistence of these populations is the soldiers’ pay. One of the errors\n\nintroduction\n\n35\n\nthat we commit in Mexico is the belief that presidial soldiers are men who engage in agriculture. This is so untrue that we must consider that these troops are as alien to agrarian tasks as are those in the garrisons of [San Juan de] Ulu´a and Veracruz. When we speak of frontier communities, it is necessary to discuss the military companies because they are the most numerous among the inhabitants. When we say they are not farmers, we realize that the greatest calamity that can occur is to have no means of providing for the troops, and that these places can easily go to ruin. In the entire Mexican federation there is scarcely a more miserable little town than Laredo and some others located, like it, on the banks of the Rı´o Bravo. Because its bed is so deep, the river’s waters cannot be used for irrigating the land without costly public works. Thus, nothing is produced in those towns except for some corn that is harvested in the bottomlands of the river and that frequently is lost because of either a lack or an excess of water, depending on the ﬂoods. The communities receive everything from outside and from far away, because they are all outposts in the wilderness. It is difﬁcult to understand why they remembered the unfortunate villa of Palafox to register it with the commandery general as a site, because some years ago it disappeared from the face of the earth. The greatest obstacle to rebuilding it is that the catastrophe that happened there ﬁlled its longtime residents with such terror and panic that today the site where [Palafox] stood is held to be cursed and prone to calamities. What is certain, without a doubt, is that [the place] offers nothing that would attract settlers, though I do believe it important to reestablish the town at another site so as not to leave empty such a large area as lies between the presidio of [San Juan Bautista del] Rı´o Grande and Laredo.57 Focusing on Tejas, the three towns are isolated from one another and from the rest of the Mexican population. They cannot resist the feared uprising of the colonies and of the foreigners who have entered clandestinely. Rather, however much we might think to help the Mexicans, they must be considered already under the power of the agitators, and therefore the Mexicans [must be considered already] expelled entirely from Tejas. If the expedition sent to Nacodoches last year had landed at La Bahı´a, as planned, it would have come ashore into the most distressful situation, deprived of any means of entering the province, much less of reaching its destination through 170 leagues of wilderness. We cannot rely on aid from Be´jar, because that town has none, even in peaceful times. What can we expect in the case of a revolution, whose ﬁrst consequence would be to cut [Be´jar] off from the coast, because the town is\n\n36 texas by tera´ n\n\nunder the control of the foreigners, who are the sole owners of the wagons [carros] that are used for travel in this country? The towns of Tejas have suffered great setbacks, and what is learned from their history is that the mindless Spanish government, when it made a determined effort to populate these lands, sent Indians from Tlascala [Tlaxcala] under the charge of missionary priests. [The Spanish] placed exorbitant funds in the missionaries’ hands so that they might pursue unchecked their chief desire to construct buildings. Thus it was that at every league they went about building churches, some of them so sumptuous and of such quality that they could well take the place of many in Mexico. There are four of them in the vicinity of Be´jar, with their corresponding convents, and one of them preserves its silver ornaments to this day. When the friars were established and the orderly and systematic spirit that controls all their activities produced some result from such costly nonsense, that ﬁckle [Spanish] government removed the friars, and with them the sole reason for those clusters of inhabitants. They dispersed, and today not one of their descendants is known. After the friars were replaced by soldiers, there was nothing but expeditions and attacks on the savages, with little concern for what constitutes a stable settlement, which is the cultivation of the land and the growth of its population. The inhabitants of Coahuila, of Nuevo Leo´n, and even of San Luis [Potosı´] were brought in to exterminate the savages. This was followed by the revolution [i.e., War of Independence]; presidial troops were called far away to ﬁght against the patriots. Be´jar, after being under the control of the latter, passed into the hands of the royalists as a consequence of the battle of Medina. Elisondo 58 pursued those who were escaping toward the [United] States of the North. He stopped them at the Trinity River with false promises of pardon and protection, and when he had them in his power he cut the throats of seventy of them. Arredondo, who had the presidial companies together in Monterrey, also disarmed the inhabitants of the frontier and deprived them of any means of defense, which allowed the savages to create widespread devastation without punishment. These evils have subsided, and the other towns now enjoy some calm in which to recover from so much misfortune.59 But in Be´jar, which is the most important town among all those that have been embrace"
