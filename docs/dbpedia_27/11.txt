The Choctaw have lived for centuries in the Southeastern United States, largely in the area that was to become the modern-day state of Mississippi. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians are the descendants of those who refused to leave their homeland during the Trail of Tears. The Tribe is the only federally recognized Native American tribe in the State. It is a sovereign nation with more than 11,000 Tribal members, and more than 33,000 acres of Tribal land across Mississippi and Tennessee. Our Visitors section offers much more information about the Mississippi Choctaw.
