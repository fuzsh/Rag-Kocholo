It traveled approximately 47 miles from the Sabine River across what is now Sabine Parish to Los Adaes.

The grant is dated April 17, 1787, and signed by Don Antonio Gil Y’Barbo, Captain and Commandant of the post at Nacogdoches. As stipulated in terms of the grant, Monsieur LeCompte was to permit no stranger who did not have the proper passport to travel through his grant. He was given the authority to arrest the trespasser and to escort him to the Spanish officials at Los Adais. The LeCompte land grant was operated as a stock farm and plantation into the 1840s.

Choctaw Apache Tribe of Ebarb. The Choctaw Apache trace their heritage back into the 1600’s. The tribe is made up of descendants of 21 families of Adaes, Choctaw, and Lipan Apache people. The Apache were sold as slaves in Natchitoches and Los Adaes and settled as free persons in the area during the Spanish period, when Indian slavery was outlawed. The Choctaw ancestors arrived in the late 1700’s and early 1800’s seeking new lands, while ancestors also included natives of the Spanish mission at Los Adaes. Generally, the Choctaw Apache lived in isolated rural communities in the bottomlands of the Sabine River.

Zebulon Pike Patrols

Patrolling Louisiana’s Neutral Strip became a delicate dance of political negotiation. Any action conducted by America aroused the suspicions of Spain. Any action by Spain made America leery. Understanding that the solution required diplomatic finesse, Texas Governor Manuel Salcedo approached Louisiana Governor William C. C. Claiborne. Claiborne appointed Lieutenant Colonel Zebulon Pike to form a joint military expedition. Pike had clear instructions. His soldiers were to remove only squatters and outlaws. Settlers who had lived in the region before the Louisiana Purchase were to be left alone. During his 1812 foray into No Man’s Land, Pike’s troops drove out outlaws but also burned houses, tents, and camps belonging to many established settlers.
