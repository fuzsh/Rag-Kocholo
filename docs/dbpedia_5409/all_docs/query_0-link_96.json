        "text": "Insigne credited Gattuso for turning around the team's fortunes since he took over from the sacked Carlo Ancelotti last December.\n\n\"The coach has given us the right determination,\" said Insigne.\n\n\"It can also be seen in the fact that two players who haven't played for a long time, like Ghoulam and Lozano, they came on and were ready.\n\n\"His (Gattuso's) imprint can be seen and can help us grow further.\"\n\nIn Genoa, Andreas Cornelius scored his second hat-trick of the season as Parma moved seventh with a 4-1 win over the port city side.\n\nCornelius also teed up Dejan Kulusevski to add a fourth three minutes from time.\n\nIago Falque pulled a goal back for Genoa from the spot after Parma goalkeeper Luigi Sepe had earlier stopped Domenico Criscito's penalty.\n\nParma are level on points with AC Milan and three points off Napoli, with Genoa just above the relegation zone.\n\nCagliari, meanwhile, earned their first league win since December 2 with Giovanni Simeone scoring three minutes into injury time for a 1-0 win over SPAL.\n\nThe Sardinian side move up to 10th place with SPAL second from bottom and facing relegation to Serie B next season.\n\nTorino beat direct relegation rivals Udinese 1-0 for their first win since January 12, moving six points clear of the drop zone.\n\nTorino captain Andrea Belotti rifled in from an angle after quarter of an hour for his 10th league goal this season."
