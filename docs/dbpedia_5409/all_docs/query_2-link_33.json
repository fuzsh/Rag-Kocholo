        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this comprehensive meta-analysis including all available RCTs comparing prophylactic anticoagulation at an escalated vs. standard dose in hospitalized COVID-19 patients without a formal indication to be on therapeutic anticoagulation, we found that the escalated dosing regimen: (1) was not associated with lower risk of all-cause death; (2) was associated with significantly higher rates of any, major, and minor bleeding; (3) was associated with significantly lower rates of VTE, driven by a reduction in PE, but not of arterial thrombotic events; (4) showed consistent safety and efficacy profiles among both critically and non-critically ill patients.\n\nThromboprophylaxis is a guideline-recommended therapy for preventing VTE in selected hospitalized medical and surgical patients without an indication for anticoagulation therapy.20 Current evidence suggests that thromboprophylaxis reduces the risk of VTE in hospitalized patients with risk factors.21 However, thromboprophylaxis does not eliminate the risk of VTE or VTE-related death. Of note, in acutely ill medical patients, thromboprophylaxis does not reduce mortality.21 The potential clinical benefits of thromboprophylaxis on VTE prevention are associated with an increase in major and non-major bleeding, especially in the presence of risk factors such as frailty, active gastroduodenal ulcer, previous bleeding, and low platelet count.22 Nevertheless, a risk-balance assessment suggests that the benefits outweigh the risks, and therefore, it is considered a standard of care in selected patients.20\n\nBecause of the pro-coagulant state and increased risk of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients, the use of anticoagulation for prophylactic purposes is recommended.23 Anticoagulation can indeed be of potential benefit for the treatment and prevention of venous and arterial micro- and macrothrombosis.1 An early finding suggested that using an escalated rather than a standard prophylactic anticoagulant dosing regimen decreased mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 and coagulopathy.5 However, this study was not randomized, it excluded patients with bleeding diathesis, and included only patients from China. A meta-analysis of observational studies including 25 719 hospitalized COVID-19 patients found that an escalated prophylactic anticoagulant dosing regimen was associated with a 50% reduction in in-hospital mortality.6 Nevertheless, the absence of data from RCTs is a major limitation of these findings. Several RCTs were designed worldwide to address the critical clinical question on the safety and efficacy of anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients.7–9 However, none of these trials were powered for testing the superiority of treatment regimens with respect to all-cause death or major bleeding.\n\nIn this meta-analysis including 5154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from 7 RCTs, we found that the use of prophylactic anticoagulation at an escalated dose was not associated with a significant reduction in all-cause death compared to the standard dose regardless of the clinical status (i.e. critically and non-critically ill patients). Heterogeneity among trials for all-cause death was high (56%) possibly reflecting multiple causes of death including both bleeding and thromboembolic events. Compared to the standard prophylactic anticoagulant dose, the escalated-dosing regimen significantly reduced VTE, with an NNT of 46, but significantly increased the risk of bleeding, with an NNH of 102. There were no significant differences on arterial thrombotic events. Overall, the cumulative evidence to support the routine use of escalated-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in clinical practice is limited. An escalated dose might be considered only on an individual basis, when thrombotic risk is deemed too heavily outweigh the bleeding risk. It should be highlighted that of the included trial, the REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4a, and ATTACC non-critically ill patients met its primary composite endpoint of organ support—free days.13 However, this endpoint was not included in this analysis because it was only measured in the REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4a, and ATTACC trials.\n\nCOVID-19 patients may exhibit complex coagulopathy states. While at the beginning of the disease patients may exhibit a pro-thrombotic state, those who advance to severe forms of the disease may exhibit a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)-like state.24 Therefore, as the severity of the COVID-19 increase, the bleeding risk may also increase. In the present analysis, major bleeding and VTE were both more frequent among critically vs. non-critically ill patients (2.6% vs. 1.5% for bleeding and 5.7% vs. 2.4% for VTE), but critical-illness status did not significantly interact with treatment effects on these outcomes. Timing of administration of anticoagulation may be crucial. On average, the median time from symptom onset to randomization in the included trials was close to 10 days (7–8 days from symptom onset to hospitalization and 2–4 days from hospitalization to randomization). At this time point, some patients can be ending the pro-coagulant state and transitioning into a DIC-like state, albeit bleeding rates are not as high. Thus, in patients in whom the predominant state is pro-coagulant, prophylactic anticoagulation at an escalated dose may be potentially beneficial. However, in patients who advance to a DIC-like state, such escalated regimen may be harmful. Of note, observational studies have reported that major bleeding events may be related to higher risk of death in COVID-19 patients and should be considered as important as thrombotic events.25 Optimizing patient selection and the window for treatment with anticoagulant therapy can be challenging and warrants further research. The application of prediction models to identify patients at higher risk of thrombotic events may improve patient selection who can benefit from escalated doses of prophylactic anticoagulation.26 Moreover, special populations such as the elderly may benefit from tailored dose anticoagulation to minimize the risk of adverse events.27 However, this approach should be tested in dedicated RCTs.\n\nIn clinical practice, knowing the inflammatory status of an individual patient may be of potential utility given its association with the risk of bleeding. Observational studies have suggested that high C-reactive protein levels may be associated with an increased bleeding risk.28 Therefore, it may be hypothesized that anti-inflammatory therapies may modulate the risk of bleeding. Given the pro-inflammatory status which characterizes patients with COVID-19, the link between anti-inflammatory therapies and bleeding outcomes is important and warrants further investigation.\n\nProphylactic anticoagulation at an escalated dosing regimen was associated with a lower rate of VTE, driven by a reduction in PE, without any effect on arterial thrombotic events. Although arterial thrombotic events occur less frequently than VTE, they have greater impact on adverse prognosis.29,30 This may be attributed to the fact that VTE is commonly represented by in situ PE in COVID-19 patients.1,31 Taking into consideration the differential prognostic impact of venous vs. arterial thrombotic events, including all-cause death, it appears that VTE prevention does not compensate for the increase in bleeding risk associated with the use of prophylactic anticoagulation at an escalated-dosing regimen."
