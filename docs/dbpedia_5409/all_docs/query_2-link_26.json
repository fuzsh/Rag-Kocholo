First up is part one including Mattia Lanzano through to Alan Connell, squad nos.1 to 17. Ratings are made out of 10. Anyone who was in the squad but didn’t play automatically gets a default 5 out of 10…e.g Nathan Thompson Part\n\nRead more\n\nA very busy January at SN1\n\nScot Munroe gives his summary of the transfer window so far and what might be in store for Town fans. We are just over three weeks into the new year and the January transfer window, there has been no surprise that we’ve witnessed new signings and deadwood departing. On the way out of the County Ground we have seen Michael Timlin leave for\n\nRead more\n\nCiao Alberto Comazzi\n\nGradually the mistakes are being erased. First it was Ibrahim Atiku, then Mattia Lanzano was asked to go, now, we wave goodbye to centre back, and disaster central, Alberto Comazzi, writes Alex Cooke. Comazzi wasn’t a bad signing, he was just the wrong signing for this decade, and this country. As Paolo Di Canio admitted the grizzled centre back always looked like\n\nRead more\n\nAlan McCormack, back where he belongs\n\nPaolo Di Canio has changed him from a midfielder to a defender, but playing at the back has allowed McCormack to change the way Swindon play, writes Alex Cooke. It took an injury to get Alan McCormack’s Swindon Town career going: not an injury to him, but to Oliver Risser. For the Namibian had been deployed as an emergency centre\n\nRead more\n\nAnalysis: Who are Di Canio’s best options at centre back?\n\nThe central partnership in the Swindon Town defence has been up for grabs since Paolo Di Canio took charge earlier this summer. With the departure of Scott Cuthbert, Lescinel Jean-Francios and Andy Frampton, Town’s new look backline has seen five players compete for the right to play at centre back in League Two; Aden Flint, Alan McCormack, Alberto Comazzi, Joe Devera and Oliver Risser. We\n\nRead more\n\nMacclesfield 2 Swindon 0: Silkmen Sink Substandard Swindon\n\nSwindon slumped to yet another away-day defeat at lowly Macclesfield, extending their wretched and unpredictable run of form away from the County Ground in the process reports Tom Otbrebski. The performance at Moss Rose bore a striking resemblance to the showings at Cheltenham and Burton earlier on in the campaign: a tale of missed chances, a penalty that perhaps should have\n\nRead more\n\nSwindon 4 Barnet 0: Can we play you every week?\n\nSwindon secured their fourth victory in five games thanks to a comfortable 4-0 win over The Bees. However, despite Town’s dominance, it always takes two to tango, with Barnet heavily responsible for their own downfall. Reports Ron Smith. After being brought back down to earth a week ago at Burton, Paolo Di Canio responded with one enforced change in Comazzi returning to the side and Phil\n\nRead more\n\nSwindon 3 Rotherham 2: Is the Sky is the limit again?\n\nAlex Cooke reports on a second win of the League Two campaign for Swindon Town. Two red cards, five yellows, two missed open goals, one clear penalty, a rumpus in the dugout, an ex notching twice and redemption via the first touch of a substitute. As a game, Swindon 2 Rotherham 3 had everything. And if Sky were looking for\n\nRead more\n\nSwindon 1 Southampton 3: Town dumped out of the cup\n\nJohno’ reviews last night’s Carling Cup tie. Our views on where next for Leon Clarke coming up shortly. Out of the cup so let’s concentrate on the league. It might be an old cliché but one that is a famous phrase for a reason.
