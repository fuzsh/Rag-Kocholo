        "text": "As of today, What are our best options in the US when it comes to german cockroach gel baits? These are my top 3 gel baits for them: Vendetta Nitro: a trusted gel bait that has been in the market for years. Different from the Original Vendetta and Vendetta Plus, this gel offers a quicker kill, makes the gel bait last longer as it requires very little consumption, has a long lasting IGR (preventing population rebound), and a special matrix for glucose averse populations. Advion Trio: The advion brand has been in the market for years, itâ€™s active ingredient is a pro-insecticide that gets activated by the same mechanism that inhibits other insecticides, so, the more tolerant the cockroach, the more lethal advion is. This new version has TWO IGRs, including the powerful Novaluron, killing early nymphs and oothecae, preventing a population rebound. Ultimatum Roach: Despite this gel not containing an IGR like the previous ones, this is one of the strongest gel baits in the US market. Containing 0.05% Fipronil, itâ€™s almost a guaranteed kill both by contact and ingestion. What shines from other gels is its special matrix, which takes a (Really long time) to dry. This gel remains moist and flexible over a month (you have to try it yourself) making it more available for consumption for multiple generations. This gel has also being designed for Glucose averse populations. All in one product. Not saying the other gel baits are not good, but doing a deep assessment, these are the three best options when controlling hard german cockroach infestations or chronic issues. #pestcontrol #pestmanament #cockroaches #entomology #biology #newyork"
