BNT162b2 and CoronaVac are the main vaccines used in Chile. Much less is known about the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain-based vaccines in the pediatric population compared to adults. Given the worldwide need for booster vaccinations to stimulate the immune response against new Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2, we characterized the humoral and cellular immune response against Omicron variant BA.1 in a pediatric cohort aged 10 to 16 years who received heterologous vaccination based on two doses of CoronaVac, two doses of CoronaVac (2x) plus one booster dose of BNT162b2 [CoronaVac(2x) + BNT162b2 (1x)], two doses of CoronaVac plus two booster doses of BNT162b2 [CoronaVac(2x) + BNT162b2 (2x)], and three doses of BNT162b2. We observed that the [CoronaVac(2x) + BNT162b2 (2x)] vaccination showed higher anti-S1 and neutralizing antibody titers and CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity specific to the Omicron variant compared to immunization with two doses of CoronaVac alone. Furthermore, from all groups tested, immunity against Omicron was highest in individuals who received three doses of BNT162b2. We conclude that booster vaccination with BNT162b2, compared to two doses of CoronaVac alone, induces a greater protective immunity.

Data were collected through anonymous questionnaires, both paper-based and online, from 3030 respondents across Poland, with the majority being from TBE-endemic areas. The survey included questions on demographic characteristics, general vaccination beliefs, and specific perceptions of TBE and its vaccine. Statistical analysis revealed significant associations between willingness to vaccinate against TBE and factors such as general vaccination attitudes, information sources, vaccine safety ratings, and perceptions of disease severity. Results indicated that guardians from larger cities and those with fewer children were more likely to vaccinate. Additionally, parents who supported general vaccinations were significantly more willing to vaccinate against TBE. The study concludes that enhancing public awareness about the safety and importance of the TBE vaccine, especially in endemic regions, is crucial for improving vaccination rates. Targeted public health interventions addressing misconceptions and providing accurate information are essential strategies to increase TBE vaccine uptake and protect children from this serious disease.

This study examines attitudes and vaccination literacy among Kazakh students, providing insights into global immunization strategies. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 3142 students from various Kazakh universities. The HLS19-VAC instrument assessed vaccination literacy, while additional questions evaluated beliefs and attitudes toward vaccines. Data were analyzed to determine associations between vaccine-related beliefs and literacy. The mean vaccination literacy score was 84.74. Most students agreed on the importance (83.4%), safety (79.1%), effectiveness (80.9%), and religious compatibility (77.8%) of vaccines. Positive beliefs significantly correlated with higher literacy scores. Past vaccination behavior, age, gender, and location showed varied associations, with past vaccination status and higher age showing a positive correlation. Positive beliefs about vaccinations were strongly associated with higher vaccination literacy among Kazakh students. Educational interventions that reinforce positive beliefs may improve vaccination literacy and increase vaccination rates. This study underscores the importance of understanding vaccination attitudes to enhance public health strategies in middle-income countries.

We conducted this prospective cohort study to investigate the function of gut microbiota in the host immune response following three doses of BNT162b2. Methods: Subjects who received three doses of BNT162b2 were recruited from three centers in Hong Kong. Blood samples were obtained before the first dose and at the one-year timepoint for IgG ELISA to determine the level of neutralizing antibody (NAb). The primary outcome was a high immune response (NAb > 600 AU/mL). We performed shotgun DNA metagenomic sequencing on baseline fecal samples to identify bacterial species and metabolic pathways associated with high immune response using linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis. Results: A total of 125 subjects were recruited (median age: 52 years [IQR: 46.2–59.0]; male: 43 [34.4%]), and 20 were regarded as low responders at the one-year timepoint. Streptococcus parasanguinis (log10LDA score = 2.38, p = 0.003; relative abundance of 2.97 × 10−5 vs. 0.03%, p = 0.001), Bacteroides stercoris (log10LDA score = 4.29, p = 0.024; relative abundance of 0.14% vs. 2.40%, p = 0.014) and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (log10LDA score = 2.15, p = 0.022; relative abundance of 0.01% vs. 0, p = 0.010) were enriched in low responders. Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (log10LDA score = 2.99, p = 0.048; relative abundance of 0.09% vs. 0.36%, p = 0.049) and Clostridium leptum (log10LDA score = 2.38, p = 0.014; relative abundance of 1.2 × 10−5% vs. 0, p = 0.044) were enriched in high responders. S. parasanguinis was negatively correlated with the superpathway of pyrimidine ribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis (log10LDA score = 2.63), which contributes to inflammation and antibody production. H. parainfluenzae was positively correlated with pathways related to anti-inflammatory processes, including the superpathway of histidine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis (log10LDA score = 2.14). Conclusion: Among three-dose BNT162b2 recipients, S. parasanguinis, B. stercoris and H. parainfluenzae were associated with poorer immunogenicity at one year, while B. pseudocatenulatum and C. leptum was associated with a better response.

Despite the existing influenza vaccination recommendations for all persons with DM, in Spain, vaccination hesitancy remains substantial, and vaccination rates lag behind target. We aimed to assess predictors for influenza vaccination uptake and reasons for non-adherence among individuals with DM. Methods: Data from the 2020 European Health Interview Survey were analysed using uni- and multivariable logistic regression models, stratified by age group and including possible confounders and vaccination as an outcome. Associations with the sociodemographic profile, healthcare access and substance use were explored. Results: Our analysis included 2194 individuals with DM over the age of 15, showing an influenza vaccination rate of 53%. The findings revealed significant predictors of vaccination uptake, including age over 60 years and robust social support. Conversely, younger age, higher education levels, infrequent healthcare interactions and economic barriers emerged as significant obstacles to vaccination. Conclusions: To enhance vaccination rates, targeted public health interventions should emphasise the importance of vaccination for younger, more educated individuals with DM, those facing economic barriers and those with lower levels of social support, which could bridge the existing gap in vaccination coverage.

The most promising indicator has been suggested to be neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), which mainly block the interaction between the Spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and the host entry receptor ACE2. In this study, we aimed to develop and optimize conditions of a competitive ELISA to measure serum neutralizing titer, using a recombinant trimeric Spike protein modified to have six additional proline residues (S(6P)-HexaPro) and h-ACE2. The results of our surrogate Virus Neutralizing Assay (sVNA) were compared against the commercial sVNT (cPass, Nanjing GenScript Biotech Co., Nanjing City, China), using serially diluted sera from vaccinees, and a high correlation of ID50–90 titer values was observed between the two assays. Interestingly, when we tested and compared the neutralizing activity of sera from eleven fully vaccinated individuals who subsequently contracted COVID-19 (hybrid sera), we recorded a moderate correlation between the two assays, while higher sera neutralizing titers were measured with sVNA. Our data indicated that the sVNA, as a more biologically relevant model assay that paired the trimeric S(6P) with ACE2, instead of the isolated RBD-ACE2 pairing cPass test, could identify nAbs other than the RBD-RBM specific ones.

In Pakistan, a country with a population of 240 million, the world’s fifth largest, dengue has emerged as an escalating public health crisis, with seasonal outbreaks severely straining the healthcare system. Despite decades of vector control efforts, there has not been much success, necessitating the introduction of dengue vaccination to boost population immunity. Recent advancements in vaccine development demonstrate promising efficacy and safety profiles, even in dengue-naive individuals. Implementing a dengue vaccination program in Pakistan could significantly reduce the disease burden, lower healthcare costs, and prevent future outbreaks. Integrating vaccination with existing public health initiatives can achieve high coverage and improve overall public health outcomes.

Therefore, the delineation of the follicular (F)/germinal center (GC) immune landscape will significantly advance our understanding of HIV pathogenesis. We have applied multiplex confocal imaging, in combination with the relevant computational tools, to investigate F/GC in situ immune dynamics in viremic (vir-HIV), antiretroviral-treated (cART HIV) People Living With HIV (PLWH) and compare them to reactive, non-infected controls. Lymph nodes (LNs) from viremic and cART PLWH could be further grouped based on their TFH cell densities in high-TFH and low-TFH subgroups. These subgroups were also characterized by different in situ distributions of PD1hi TFH cells. Furthermore, a significant accumulation of follicular FOXP3hiCD4hi T cells, which were characterized by a low scattering in situ distribution profile and strongly correlated with the cell density of CD8hi T cells, was found in the cART-HIV low-TFH group. An inverse correlation between plasma viral load and LN GrzBhiCD8hi T and CD16hiCD15lo cells was found. Our data reveal the complex GC immune landscaping in HIV infection and suggest that follicular FOXP3hiCD4hi T cells could be negative regulators of TFH cell prevalence in cART-HIV.

This study investigates the impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on PASC symptoms in children in Taiwan during the Omicron pandemic. Methods: We enrolled children under 18 years with PASC symptoms persisting for more than 4 weeks. Data collected included demographics, clinical information, vaccination status, and symptom persistence. We used logistic regression models to compare symptoms in the acute and post-COVID-19 phases and to assess the association between vaccination and these symptoms. Results: Among 500 PASC children, 292 (58.4%) were vaccinated, 282 (52.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 7.6 (4.6) years. Vaccinated individuals exhibited higher odds of experiencing symptoms in the previous acute phase, such as cough (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–2.42), rhinorrhea/nasal congestion (AOR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.13–2.67), sneezing (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.02–2.76), sputum production (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.15–3.19), headache/dizziness (AOR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.04–2.87), and muscle soreness (AOR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.13–4.80). In contrast, there were lower odds of experiencing abdominal pain (AOR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.25–0.94) and diarrhea (AOR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17–0.78) in children who had received vaccination during the post-COVID-19 phase. Conclusions: This study revealed clinical features and vaccination effects in PASC children in Taiwan. Vaccination may reduce some gastrointestinal symptoms in the post-COVID-19 phase.

In the first trial, 125 μg of C. jejuni OMPs and 50 μg of CpG ODN were administered individually or in combination, either in ovo to chick embryos or subcutaneously (SC) to one-day-old chicks. In the second trial, different concentrations of C. jejuni antigens (heat-killed, whole lysate, and OMPs) were administered SC to one-day-old chicks. The results of the first trial revealed that SC immunization with the combination of CpG ODN and C. jejuni OMPs elevated interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-13 gene expression in the spleen, significantly increased serum IgM and IgY antibody levels, and reduced cecal C. jejuni counts by approximately 1.2 log10. In contrast, in ovo immunization did not elicit immune responses or confer protection against Campylobacter. The results of the second trial showed that SC immunization with C. jejuni whole lysate or 200 μg OMPs reduced C. jejuni counts by approximately 1.4 and 1.1 log10, respectively. In conclusion, C. jejuni lysate and OMPs are promising vaccine antigens for reducing Campylobacter colonization in chickens.

The aim of this prospective non-interventional observational single-center study was to determine the immunological and epidemiological effectiveness of single-dose vaccination against hepatitis A 9 to 11 years after its implementation. The anti-HAV IgG antibodies were determined in two independent cohorts of children who were vaccinated with a single dose of monovalent pediatric inactivated vaccine (HAVRIX® 720 EU) in Tyva in 2012 and recruited 9 years (Year 9 Cohort) and 11 years (Year 11 Cohort) after immunization. The seroprotection rates defined as anti-HAV antibody concentrations ≥10 mIU/mL reached 99.4% (95% CI: 98.2–99.9% [501/504]) in the Year 9 Cohort, but decreased significantly to 75.4% (95% CI: 73.0–77.6% [1006/1335]) in the Year 11 Cohort (p < 0.0001). The anti-HAV geometric mean concentrations decreased from 1446.3 mIU/mL (95% CI: 1347.1–1545.4 mIU/mL) in the Year 9 Cohort to 282.6 mIU/mL (95% CI: 203.8–360.8, p < 0.0001) in the Year 11 Cohort. The HAV vaccination program resulted in zero rates of hepatitis A incidence in the Tyva Republic since 2016. However, the limited monitoring of HAV RNA in sewage and environmental samples demonstrated the ongoing circulation of both the regional epidemic strain of HAV genotype IA and another genotype IA strain imported recently from other parts of the Russian Federation, probably due to subclinical infections in non-vaccinated children under 3 years of age. Taken together, these data indicate the effectiveness of the single-dose HAV vaccination strategy but suggest the need to expand the vaccination program to include children aged 12 months and older to achieve maximum effectiveness.

The WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean supported a regional study to assess the VE of COVID-19 vaccines against different clinical outcomes in four countries between June 2021 and August 2023. Health worker cohort studies were conducted in 2707 health workers in Egypt and Pakistan, of whom 171 experienced symptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Test-negative design case–control studies were conducted in Iran and Jordan in 4017 severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) patients (2347 controls and 1670 cases) during the Omicron variant dominant period. VE estimates were calculated for each study and pooled by study design for several vaccine types (BBIBP-CorV, AZD1222, BNT162b2, and mRNA-1273, among others). Among health workers, VE against symptomatic infection of a complete primary series could only be computed compared to partial vaccination, suggesting a benefit of providing an additional dose of mRNA vaccines (VE: 88.9%, 95%CI: 15.3–98.6%), while results were inconclusive for other vaccine products. Among SARI patients, VE against hospitalization of a complete primary series with any vaccine compared to non-vaccinated was 20.9% (95%CI: 4.5–34.5%). Effectiveness estimates for individual vaccines, booster doses, and secondary outcomes (intensive care unit admission and death) were inconclusive. Future VE studies will need to address challenges in both design and analysis when conducted late during a pandemic and will be able to utilize the strengthened capacities in countries.

This study aimed to assess their preferences for HPV vaccination services and evaluate the relative importance of various factors to inform vaccination strategy development. Methods: Through a literature review and expert consultations, we identified five key attributes for study: effectiveness, protection duration, waiting time, distance, and out-of-pocket (OOP) payment. A D-efficient design was used to create a discrete choice experiment (DCE) questionnaire. We collected data via face-to-face interviews and online surveys from female students across seven universities in China, employing mixed logit and latent class logit models to analyze the data. The predicted uptake and compensating variation (CV) were used to compare different vaccination service scenarios. Results: From 1178 valid questionnaires, with an effective response rate of 92.9%, we found that effectiveness was the most significant factor influencing vaccination preference, followed by protection duration, OOP payment and waiting time, with less concern for distance. The preferred services included a 90% effective vaccine, lifetime protection, a waiting time of less than three months, a travel time of more than 60 min, and low OOP payment. Significant variability in preferences across different vaccination service scenarios was observed, affecting potential market shares. The CV analysis showed female students were willing to spend approximately CNY 5612.79 to include a hypothetical ‘Service 5’ (a vaccine with higher valency than the nine-valent HPV vaccine) in their prevention options. Conclusions: The findings underscore the need for personalized, need-based HPV vaccination services that cater specifically to the preferences of female university students to increase vaccination uptake and protect their health.

This descriptive, cross-sectional study aims to explore the vaccination practices and intentions regarding influenza vaccines among young athletes. Methods: A structured, questionnaire-based study was conducted among students from the National School of Sports in Greece. The survey was conducted over the period of April to May 2023. Overall, 138 participants participated in the study. Results: More than half of the participants had received a flu vaccine in the past, but only 12.3% were vaccinated against influenza for 2022–2023. The main reasons seemed to be the lack of time (40.6%) and the idea that influenza does not lead to any serious health threats for the participants (36.2%). The main factor that affected their decision to get the flu vaccine or not was the need for more information regarding influenza vaccination (79%). Conclusions: The recent study showed low vaccination coverage among people of young age participating in sports activities. The qualitative views of the participants highlighted the significance of the lackof a well-organized information program provided by health professionals and coaches.

Infections with the pathogen are also common in the canine host. Our previous studies demonstrated that functional disruption within the E. chaffeensis phage head-to-tail connector protein gene results in bacterial attenuation, creating a modified live attenuated vaccine (MLAV). The MLAV confers protective immunity against intravenous and tick transmission challenges one month following vaccination. In this study, we evaluated the duration of MLAV protection. Dogs vaccinated with the MLAV were challenged with wild-type E. chaffeensis via intravenous infection at 4-, 8-, and 12-months post-vaccination. Immunized dogs rapidly cleared the wild-type pathogen infection and tested positive for bacteremia less frequently than unvaccinated controls. While immune responses varied among dogs, vaccinees consistently mounted IgG and CD4+ T-cell responses specific to E. chaffeensis throughout the assessment period. Our findings demonstrate that MLAV-mediated immune protection persists for at least one year against wild-type bacterial infection, marking a major advancement in combating this serious tick-borne disease. The data presented here serve as the foundation for further studies, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying virulence and vaccine development and aiding in preventing the diseases caused by E. chaffeensis and other tick-borne rickettsial pathogens.

The addition of saponin-based adjuvants is an interesting strategy to increase the effectiveness of vaccines. We have previously shown that ISCOM matrices from Q. brasiliensis (IMXQB) are a safe and potent adjuvant. In this study, we evaluated the use of IMXQB as an adjuvant for the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) in an aged mice model. Herein, we show that subcutaneous injection of the adjuvanted vaccine promoted higher titers of IgM, IgG (and isotypes), and serum hemagglutination inhibition titers (HAI). Notably, aged mice immunized by intranasal route also produced higher IgG (and isotypes) and IgA titers up to 120 days after priming, as well as demonstrating an improvement in the HAI antibodies against the TIV. Further, experimental infected aged mice treated once with sera from adult naïve mice previously immunized with TIV-IMXQB subcutaneously successfully controlled the infection. Overall, TIV-IMXQB improved the immunogenicity compared to TIV by enhancing systemic and mucosal immunity in old mice conferring a faster recovery after the H1N1pdm09-like virus challenge. Thus, IMXQB nanoparticles may be a promising platform for next-generation viral vaccines.
