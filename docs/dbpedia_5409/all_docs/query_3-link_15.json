        "text": "Prevention\n\nBleeding from the staple line can be influenced by stapling techniques. Selection of the proper stapler height against gastric wall thickness was the first step to prevent stapling failure or bleeding [12]. Yeo et al. [13] reported that using staple heights shorter than the typical recommendations could decrease intraoperative bleeding rates by exerting higher staple loading pressure in SG. Precompression before staple firing has usually been recommended to resolve tissue edema and optimize staple formation [14].\n\nVarious reinforcement techniques have been used to prevent postoperative bleeding. Among them, placing seromuscular sutures or oversewing the staple line is the most cost-effective and commonly used method in Korea. This procedure usually takes some time in the early learning curve of SG and can be decreased to approximately 10–15 minutes along with the accumulation of surgical experience. Continuous oversewing with a barbed suture material may further reduce the overall procedure time.\n\nAnother method for hemostasis involves the use of buttressing materials. Several buttressing products made from different materials have been introduced into the market, including bovine pericardium (Peri-Strips Dry with Veritas, Synovis, Deerfield, IL, USA), absorbable synthetic polymer membranes (SEAMGUARD®, Gore®, W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Newark, DE, USA, or Tri-Staple™ 2.0 Reinforced Reload, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Many previous studies have been conducted to elucidate the efficacy of these buttressing products in preventing bleeding from staple lines and leakage from staple line disruption. Although the results from these studies were not entirely consistent, using the buttressing product along the staple line during SG appeared to reduce the incidence of staple line bleeding; its efficacy on leakage has not been clearly demonstrated [4,11,15,16]. However, these buttressing products are not commercially available in Korea yet.\n\nAnother method involves the application of fibrin sealants. A recent meta-analysis including 2,136 SG patients from nine randomized controlled trials showed that there was a tendency toward less bleeding with fibrin sealant application compared to no reinforcement [8]. However, the hemostatic role of sealants was not evident in that meta-analysis of trials with larger samples [17]. It is still not clear whether applying fibrin sealant alone could reduce the incidence of postoperative bleeding.\n\nSome investigators have suggested that increasing the systolic blood pressure beyond the normal range (>140 mmHg) in cooperation with anesthesiologists and simultaneously decreasing the intraabdominal pressure below 10 mmHg at the end of surgery can help detect silent bleeding during surgery. De Angelis et al. [10] reported that after adopting this intraoperative protocol, all silent bleeding was detected and properly controlled during surgery, and there were no postoperative bleeding events after surgery. In addition, Sroka et al. [7] also demonstrated that routine elevation of systolic blood pressure and over-suturing of the staple line minimized the incidence of hemorrhagic events down to 0% with reasonable prolongation of the procedure in their randomized controlled trial.\n\nManagement\n\nManagement of leaks after SG is difficult and complicated. The mainstays of leak management include proper medical resuscitation, proper drainage of the complicated fluid collection, and repair of the wall defect. The early use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, along with high-dose proton pump inhibitors, is essential for initial management. Thus, patient stability will guide further management plans. Hemodynamically unstable patients with septic shock usually require immediate surgical intervention. Less invasive therapeutic options such as endoscopic interventions are preferred.\n\nWhen surgical exploration was performed on leak patients in the earlier period, the goal of surgical management was not a definitive repair of the leak but to wash out and remove the necrotic debris and to place proper drains. A simple primary repair might be attempted in acute leaks within three days after surgery when promptly diagnosed [30]. Nonetheless, it is usually less successful, with a high incidence of recurrence owing to extensive inflammation in the surrounding tissue. In the latter phase, when non-surgical management fails after three to six months, surgery can be used as a step-up or salvage therapy. This includes conversion to RYGB and fistulojejunostomy.\n\nIn stable patients, less-invasive non-surgical management should be attempted. This includes a wide range of endoscopic interventions, from endoscopic stenting and direct fistula closure, to internal drainage and radiologic interventions. Adequate drainage has been the most important treatment for early leaks, and abscesses can be drained percutaneously or endoscopically. The gastric wall defect needs to be repaired either by diverting the fistula or by direct closure. Endoscopic intervention depends on the size and characteristics of the defect [22].\n\nThe placement of self-expandable metabolic stents (SEMS) is one of the most commonly used methods for managing acute or early leaks after SG. It allows food materials to bypass the defect during fistula healing and enables early oral feeding or even discharge. The most frequent problem in stenting is migration, which is reported to be up to 30% depending on the type of stent. Therefore, some experts recommend additional clipping to secure the stent in place [31]. Other common complaints from patients are chest discomfort, nausea, and reflux after the procedure, and some patients might require premature removal of the stent due to intolerance. Stents are usually placed for four to six weeks, and fistula status needs to be reevaluated. Recently, several bariatric-specific SEMS have been introduced and are now available for clinical use. They are fully covered stents with a larger caliber and a longer length than usual stents to fit the bariatric anatomy ( ). The leak closure rate has been reported to be up to 100% with these bariatric-specific stents at the expense of a higher incidence of stent-related complications such as esophageal stricture, bleeding, perforation, and intolerance [31,32,33,34,35].\n\nDirect fistula closure can be attempted in the case of a small fistula opening. Closure with conventional through-the-scope clips might work in very small defects of less than 1 cm and in much less inflamed tissue, but demonstrates limited efficacy. Over-the-scope clips (OTSC) provide full-thickness closure of the fistula and show promising results [36]. Successful closure can be expected in early small-sized fistulas with less fibrotic tissue, and the success rate depends on operator experience. Mizrahi et al. retrospectively reviewed 26 patients who were treated with OTSC for sleeve leaks and reported that OTSC alone demonstrated a disappointing success rate of 56.8%, and additional endoscopic procedures were required in the majority of the patients to achieve successful defect closure [37].\n\nTissue sealants have also been used to close the fistulas. Fibrin glue functions in two ways: mechanical occlusion of the defect and promotion of fibroblast proliferation. The glue can be delivered endoscopically or radiologically, and multiple sessions with intervals of several days are usually required to occlude the fistula completely. Assalia et al. [38] reported that percutaneous application of fibrin glue with fluoroscopic guidance under endoscopic visualization achieved successful fistula closure in 23 of 24 patients with sleeve leak patients with 2.2 sessions on average (range, 1–6). This suggests that plugging leaky sleeves with tissue sealant is a simple, tolerable, and effective method to treat sleeve leaks with fewer complications.\n\nEndoscopic internal drainage (EID) with double-pigtail stents is another method to treat sleeve leaks. The stent keeps the fistula tract open and facilitates drainage of the abscess in the gastric lumen, which eventually leads to the collapse of the abscess cavity and the closure of the leak. It can be used for well-contained leaks and usually requires a nasojejunal feeding tube for enteral feeding for a couple of weeks. EID with endoscopic pigtail stents showed a success rate of up to 95% at relatively lower costs and fewer complications than SEMS, as well as minimal discomfort for the patients [39,40,41]. Therefore, it is rapidly gaining popularity as a therapeutic modality for leaks among bariatric experts.\n\nTo facilitate faster healing, endoscopic vacuum-assisted closure (EVAC) has been attempted [42]. Continuous negative pressure applied to the sponge absorbs complicated fluid collection in the cavity, reducing the risk of wide dissemination of infection and accelerating the growth of granulation tissue. However, the sponge should be changed every 3 to 5 days, which requires repeated endoscopic sessions, and either prolonged parenteral nutrition or feeding jejunostomy is necessary. In a small series, the success rate was reported as 87%, which was mostly achieved within a month, indicating that the treatment period was considerably shorter with EVAC than with EID [42]."
