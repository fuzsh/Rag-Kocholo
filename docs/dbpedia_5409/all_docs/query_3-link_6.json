        "text": "Italian footballer\n\nSergio Viotti (born 4 March 1990) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie D club Franciacorta FC.[1]\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nBrescia\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Brescia, Lombardy, Viotti started his career at Brescia Calcio. He was the starting goalkeeper of Primavera team in 2007–08 season, ahead Andrea Caroppo.[2] In June 2008 he left for Bellaria – Igea Marina.[3] On 1 July 2009, he returned to Brescia and promoted to first team (despite still eligible to Primavera, which was played by Nicola Leali and Michal Hrivňák). He was assigned shirt no.22 that season,[4] (which he had since 2006–07 season but did not play[5]) winning the promotion play-off with team to Serie A.\n\nTriestina\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2010 he left for Serie B team Triestina in co-ownership deal, for €50,000.[6][7] He was the understudy of Roberto Colombo.\n\nChievo and loans\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 24 June 2011, Triestina bought him outright for another €50,000[6][8] but in August sold to Serie A team Chievo, rejoining international team-mate Marco Silvestri (who already left on loan to Reggiana). Chievo also signed Alessandro Longhi and re-sold half of the rights to Sassuolo. On 31 August he returned to Trieste.[9]\n\nViotti was the starting keeper for Triestina in 2011–12 Lega Pro Prima Divisione. However, in January 2012 Grosseto loaned Viotti from Chievo.[10] Viotti was the understudy of Antonio Narciso and wore the number 23 shirt.\n\nIn July 2012 he returned to Verona. In January 2013 he was signed by Cremonese.[11][12]\n\nOn 16 July 2013, he was signed by Juve Stabia.[13]\n\nOn 10 July 2014, he was signed by Monza.[14] On 8 January 2015, he was signed by Pro Vercelli.[15]\n\nMartina\n\n[edit]\n\nViotti was signed by Martina on a free transfer in summer 2015.[16]\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nViotti represented Italy at youth level, playing for the Azzurrini (little Sky-Blues) from under-16 to under-21 level.\n\nU-16\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the Italy under-16 side, Viotti finished as the runner-up[17] in a youth tournament held in Montaigu, Vendée, France.[18] He started all 4 matches.\n\nU-17\n\n[edit]\n\nViotti was a regular for the Italy under-17 side in 2007 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship qualification, under manager Luca Gotti (playing 2 out of 3 matches, the first match against Andorra was played by Mattia Lanzano)[19] and in the elite qualification (playing the first match, then serving as a backup to Vincenzo Fiorillo).[20]\n\nU-18 & U-19\n\n[edit]\n\nViotti also received a call-up to the Italy U-18 and U-19 team training camp from manager Francesco Rocca.[21] However, the team's new coach Massimo Piscedda dropped both Fiorillo (who was promoted to the U-21 side) and Viotti, as well as Carlo Pinsoglio,[22][23] (who was ineligible to be called-up); the Azzurrini were eliminated from the first qualifying round held in Moldova.\n\nU-20\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2009, Viotti was promoted to the Italy under-20 team, and played in the third round of the 2008–09 Four Nations Tournament. He benched on the next game as understudy of Pinsoglio against England in March, but was later dropped for the fourth round of the competition. He was in the preliminary 30-man squad for the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup,[24] but was not included in the final squad coached by Rocca. He later played the first round of 2009–10 Four Nations Tournament, during which he was substituted by Alex Teodorani in the second half. Since then he was dropped from the under-20 national squad.\n\nU-21\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2011, Viotti was called-up by Ciro Ferrara, the coach of under-21 team.[25] After missing the team's next four friendlies following his first call-up, he returned to the team as the first choice goalkeeper in the 2011 Toulon Tournament, featuring in all of Italy's matches except the last bronze medal match, which was played by Marco Silvestri. He was dropped again from the squad ahead of the team's 2013 European Under-21 Championship qualifying campaign.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nViotti is a friend of Mario Balotelli, also a footballer and former international team-mate.[26]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
