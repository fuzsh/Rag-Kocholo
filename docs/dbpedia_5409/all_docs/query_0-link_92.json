        "text": "Weston McKennie has revealed his goal celebration in Juventus’ win over Bologna was inspired by his love for Harry Potter.\n\nThe United States international has increased his standing in the game since joining Juventus on loan from Schalke at the start of the season.\n\nWhile Juventus are not hitting the heights of previous seasons and face a battle to win the Serie A title for the 10th campaign in a row, McKennie has impressed in Turin.\n\nWorld Cup Qualification CONCACAF\n\nRound-up: Canada closing on World Cup place, USA beat Honduras\n\n03/02/2022 at 09:43\n\nReports suggest Juve will turn his loan into a permanent arrangement at the end of the campaign, and he did his cause no harm with the second goal in the 2-0 victory at home to Bologna on Sunday.\n\nAfter scoring, McKennie appeared to mimic being a wizard, and he has revealed that was entirely down to him being a huge fan of Harry Potter.\n\n“I am actually a big Harry Potter fan,” McKennie told DAZN. “I have a tattoo on my hand, so it was a magic spell.”\n\nKlopp creates 'huge problem' for Real Madrid – Euro Papers\n\nThe win revives Juve’s title hopes, and saw them make ground on AC Milan who were beaten by Atalanta on Saturday. They trail the leaders by seven points.\n\nArthur Melo notched his first goal for the Turin club in the first half with a deflected strike and McKennie headed home the second after 71 minutes.\n\nBologna goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski made some stunning saves to keep his side in the match and the visitors also had good chances in an entertaining encounter at the Allianz Stadium.\n\nIt was a much-needed victory for Andrea Pirlo’s side following the disappointment of their 2-0 defeat by Inter Milan last weekend as it cut the gap behind league leaders AC Milan to seven points and the champions also have a game in hand.\n\n“It’s very important for us. We watched yesterday how both Milan teams dropped points,” McKennie said after Milan lost 3-0 to visiting Atalanta and Inter were held 0-0 at Udinese.\n\n“We’re a game down and we still have to play both of them in Turin. We’re three points closer and I think it’ll be a fight to the end. We’ll see who wants it more.”\n\nHellas Verona came from behind to stun Napoli with a 3-1 home win on Sunday despite Hirving Lozano having scored the visitors’ fastest-ever Serie A goal after nine seconds.\n\nThe Mexican winger pounced on a missed clearance by Federico Dimarco to fire into the net moments after kick-off.\n\nClocked at 8.95 seconds, it was the third-fastest goal in Serie A history after Rafael Leao’s strike for AC Milan against Sassuolo in 2020 (6.8 seconds) and former Piacenza striker Paolo Poggi’s goal versus Fiorentina in 2001 (8.9).\n\nHowever, Napoli could not make their early advantage count and Dimarco made up for his earlier error by tucking in a Davide Faraoni cross to equalise in the 34th minute.\n\nVerona completed the turnaround with an Antonin Barak strike after 62 minutes and Mattia Zaccagni header 11 minutes from time to secure victory.\n\nGenoa beat Cagliari 1-0 thanks to a goal from Mattia Destro.\n\nSerie A\n\nPirlo leaves out three players for Covid-19 protocol breach\n\n02/04/2021 at 18:41\n\nSerie A\n\nMcKennie beats Pulisic to U.S. Soccer's male player of the year award\n\n18/12/2020 at 19:06"
