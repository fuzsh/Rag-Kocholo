        "text": "2 OVERTOURISM\n\nCities provide visitors with a diverse range of multifunctional, complex, and multiuser environments. In recent years, there has been a notable shift in the perception of city tourism, as the growing number of tourists has placed strain on public transportation, infrastructure, roads, museums, attractions, and other services initially designed primarily for local residents [1].\n\nThe concept of overtourism is closely associated with destinations facing the negative impacts of excessive tourism activity. Overtourism occurs when the number of visitors exceeds the maximum capacity that a tourist destination can handle simultaneously [2]. This maximum capacity is often referred to as the carrying capacity of the destination [3]. The United Nations Statistics Division (UNWTO) now defines overtourism as \"the impact of tourism on a destination, or parts thereof, that excessively influences the perceived quality of life of citizens and/or quality of visitors' experiences in a negative way\" [1]. As a result, the available space for local residents is reduced [2], and residents face challenges navigating the streets amidst crowds of tourists, disrupting their daily lives, limiting access to essential amenities, and impeding overall well-being [4].\n\nOvertourism implies that cities have a maximum capacity for tourism that can be exceeded, leading to uniform impacts [1].\n\nHowever, this concept poses challenges when seeking solutions, as it hampers a shared understanding among different stakeholders regarding the specific nature of the problem(s) within the local context [5], as noted by McCool (2001). Such understanding is crucial because overtourism is not solely caused by tourism itself, and effective management strategies will require collaboration with stakeholders beyond the tourism sector, including residents [2].\n\nWhen examining temporal overtourism, its most evident manifestation occurs during seasonal variations, such as the summer season in the Mediterranean and Golden Week in China, as well as during peak holiday periods and notable events like the Olympics [6]. These temporary situations exert immense pressure on local infrastructure and services, leading to overcrowding and a diminished sense of place.\n\nPlanning for temporal overtourism, particularly when driven externally and guided by global tourism supply chains, poses significant challenges.\n\nThe current discussions on these matters draw heavily from various disciplines, such as human geography, urban planning, and innovation studies, offering valuable insights that can unlock new avenues of research and provide frameworks to address the challenges posed by overtourism. By incorporating perspectives and approaches from these domains, researchers can explore innovative solutions and strategies to effectively tackle overtourism and its associated issues.\n\nPrevious studies have emphasized the importance of the urban context and the integration of tourism within urban planning [7]. However, the findings of Ko Kens et al.'s research (2018) indicate that the challenges associated with overtourism can also stem from broader societal trends, such as evolving lifestyles and seemingly unrelated factors like the proliferation of online shopping and social media [1]. This suggests that overtourism should no longer be viewed solely as a problem specific to the tourism industry or urban areas but rather as a social issue deeply embedded within the fabric of cities.\n\nWhile overtourism has played a significant role in shaping sustainable tourism discourse, its popularity has waned in recent years as other concepts related to sustainable tourism have gained prominence. These concepts, such as Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC), Visitor Impact Management (VIM), Visitor Experience and Resource Protection (VERP), and Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS), have become dominant in discussions on tourism management and its impacts [8]. These alternative frameworks prioritize the sustainable management of tourism and emphasize the need to balance visitor experiences with the protection of resources. As a result, overtourism has taken a backseat in contemporary discussions on tourism impact management.\n\n4 SUSTAINABLE TOURISM\n\nThe urgent need to investigate the carrying capacity of tourism arises from a growing set of sustainability challenges observed in recent years, including environmental pollution, landscape degradation, ecological imbalances, and decreasing satisfaction among tourists and residents [10]. Sustainable tourism should also encompass considerations for environmental conservation, social equity, quality of life, cultural diversity, and a thriving economy that provides employment and prosperity for all stakeholders [16].\n\nConsequently, conducting research on tourism carrying capacity is imperative to effectively address these pressing issues. Managers within the international tourism industry, operating at various levels, have developed planning processes with the objective of defining sustainable tourism models that are diverse, of high quality, and viable in the medium and long term [17]. To ensure the effective design, monitoring, and control of tourism policies, the utilization of appropriate analytical tools becomes essential in assessing the current state and evolution of destinations, considering their strengths and weaknesses. These tools play a crucial role in redirecting development processes as needed.\n\nThe environmental aspect of tourism assumes a fundamental role in achieving sustainable development in tourism activities and destinations. While tourism development can bring significant economic benefits to destinations, it simultaneously exerts significant pressure on public resources, cultural ambiance, and the ecological environment, thereby posing a threat to destination sustainability [10].\n\nInternationally recognized as a suitable option for evaluating progress towards more sustainable conditions in tourism destinations, sustainable tourism indicators exemplify their significance [17] [18].\n\nAccording to Blancas & Lozano-Oyola (2022), sustainable tourism is a complex concept that encompasses social, economic, and environmental dimensions, necessitating the use of indicators from each of these areas for a comprehensive evaluation [17]. However, the collection of these indicators within an information system often presents challenges in obtaining a holistic assessment of the analyzed territory.\n\nDespite efforts, limited progress has been made in achieving sustainability goals, and the utilization of diverse indicator frameworks has resulted in overlapping practices.\n\nRegarding the travel industry, as widely recognized, carbon emissions significantly contribute to the adverse environmental effects, particularly those caused by the transportation sector. A report by the US Environmental Protection Agency [19] highlights that in the United States alone, the transportation sector accounts for 28% of all greenhouse gas emissions. This sector encompasses the transportation of people and goods via various modes such as cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, and other vehicles. The primary source of greenhouse gas emissions in transportation is carbon dioxide (CO2) resulting from the combustion of petroleum-based products, including gasoline and diesel fuel, in internal combustion engines [19].\n\nTransport emissions make up approximately 20% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which can be categorized into road, aviation, shipping, and rail sectors. The accessibility and affordability of air travel have significantly contributed to the shrinking of the world, as evidenced by a 40% increase in the number of flights since 2010. However, despite its higher carbon intensity compared to road travel, aviation only accounts for 11.6% of emissions in the passenger transportation sector. On the other hand, road transport is responsible for a substantial 74.5% of CO2 emissions in the overall transport industry.\n\nIn general, transportation-related emissions contribute to approximately 20% of the total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. These emissions can be categorized into four main sectors: road transport, aviation, shipping, and rail transport [20] (Figure 1).\n\n5 THE REC-OVERTOURISM METHODOLOGY\n\nVarious destinations around the world have had to close their doors due to overtourism and generally unsustainable practices. As previously mentioned, some consequences include overcrowding, erosion, isolation of local communities, pollution, water scarcity, and a cultural divide between locals.\n\nIdentifying this complex issue and recognizing the possibility of more locations needing to temporarily close their doors to tourism, we aim to explore an alternative solution based on conceptual, critical, and speculative design. Through the project we have developed, our goal is to make these places accessible and visitable in unconventional ways.\n\n5.1 Conceptual Design\n\nA conceptual project explores alternative possibilities within the realm of reality, as defined by Dunne and Raby (2013), conceptual design is primarily about \"designing with ideas.\" Thus, the purpose of conceptual design is to provide alternative contexts for design outside the directives of market forces and create a space for experimenting with ideas and ideals [21]. The separation from market-driven logic creates a parallel channel for design, free from pressures and available for the exploration of new ideas and questioning.\n\nThese ideas can encompass new possibilities for design itself, aesthetic possibilities for technology, social, cultural, and ethical implications for scientific and technological research, or large-scale social and political issues such as democracy, sustainability, and alternatives to our current capitalist model.\n\nTherefore, the potential to use the language of design to ask questions, provoke, and inspire is the defining characteristic of conceptual design [21].\n\n5.2 Objectives and Research\n\nBuilding upon the framework of speculative practice, we pose the following question: What if it were possible to travel without leaving one's location and find sustainable and inclusive alternatives to avoid overtourism?\n\nTo address this question, we have developed an experience called REC-OVERtourism, which allows individuals to explore highly sought-after destinations that have had to close down due to excessive visitor numbers and unsustainable practices.\n\nThe purpose is to give the entire ecosystem time to recover.\n\nUsers will be able to explore these locations through live camera streams that cover the entire city, offering a chance to enjoy the beautiful views. However, the question remains: Will this alone be sufficient?\n\nTo begin our exploration, we conducted research on similar experiences and discovered highly relevant examples such as the Drive & Listen website and WindowSwap , which align with the proposal we are putting forward.\n\nWindowSwap allows users to open a new window to a location somewhere in the world and provides access to videos showcasing various views from windows that have been uploaded by users.\n\nThe Drive & Listen website allows users to virtually drive through 50 cities around the world while simultaneously listening to local radio stations in each country, as well as ambient sounds of the streets.\n\nThese examples (Figure 2) serve as inspiration for our proposal and demonstrate how technology can provide immersive experiences that allow individuals to explore and connect with different places and cultures, even when physically unable to travel.\n\n5.3 Ideation and Prototyping\n\nWe have created personas (Figure 3) that can represent different types of users who will interact with the website.\n\nThese personas help us better understand the needs, motivations, and preferences of our target audience.\n\nTo perform the user journeys (Figure 4) for the persona Isabel, we defined the task flow with the following goal: replace the travel experience to an art city through the digital experience of REC-OVERtourism. The task flow for the persona Ersilio has the following goal: distract himself from the busy daily routine and try a new traveling experience.\n\nThe transposition of the travel experience into a digital one can be less stimulating or appealing to the user. For this reason, we have added a relevant concept, which is the waiting time.\n\nThe trend is for the number of tourists to increase, resulting in a waiting list for accessing certain locations. This measure aims to allow for better recovery from various types of damages, such as historical, environmental, and impacts on residents.\n\nThe waiting time has been calculated for each destination based on factors like tourism carrying capacity, number of residents, and annual tourist numbers. It indicates the number of days a person would have to wait before being able to access a location once containment policies are in place and a waiting list is generated for visiting the place.\n\nTo make this information more relatable, the waiting time has been converted into units of time that users can better comprehend. For example: \"443 days of waiting time, enough time to walk twice the world's longest route and still have 69 days left.\" Users will encounter this statistic multiple times throughout the website. On the homepage, you can find three links:\n\nSimulator: an interactive feature that calculates the impact your travel could have on a chosen location. It also suggests good practices to minimize the impact.\n\nCamera streams: a collection of camera streams from various locations, including Boracay, Cinque Terre, Dubrovnik, Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon, Maya Bay, Machu Picchu, Mallorca, and Santorini. These streams autoplay while displaying the waiting time for each location.\n\nSingle location: whenever a specific location is on the screen, a pop-up with a scrollable list displays the waiting time for each location. Another pop-up provides a brief explanation about the waiting time concept.\n\nInteractive Map: the map that allows users to browse locations, understand the waiting time concept, and choose a camera stream.\n\nIn the following images, you can see the information architecture as well as some keyframes of the website prototype (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8).\n\nIn the simulator link can be calculated the impact that travel could have on a chosen location and explore a set of good practices to reduce the impact of travel.\n\nPostma & Schmuecker [22] identified potential areas of conflict between residents and tourists and sought to understand the negative perception of impacts by local residents. Based on their research, literature review, and considerations by the researchers, we present the following set of good practices: respect local customs and traditions; support local businesses; minimize waste and litter; engage in sustainable transportation; conserve natural resources; learn about the local environment; and support community initiatives.\n\nBy implementing these good practices, travelers can help reduce the negative impacts of tourism on local communities and foster a more sustainable and harmonious relationship between residents and tourists.\n\n5.4 Evaluation and User Testing\n\nTo improve the project, a Think Aloud Protocol was conducted, both online (via Zoom, Teams) and physically (in situ tests at people's homes). The objective of this protocol was to a) Understand what interests the user the most and what information they are seeking; b) Identify unclear parts and detect any misleading elements; c) Observe the user's reaction after using the prototype; d) Determine if the user fully grasps the problem we are addressing after experiencing the website and e) Assess whether the user's mindset changes and if they will be more cautious. To measure these objectives, specific tasks were defined. The user was required to:\n\nNavigate to the map, explore its features, click on various locations, and then select one from the list on the side.\n\nExplore three different locations and watch the related live streams.\n\nExplore and compare the data from two different locations, read and understand the issues they face.\n\nCalculate the impact of your own travel on a specific location using the provided tool or feature.\n\nWe received some relevant insights and found that the concept of waiting time is not immediately clear to users. As a solution, we decided to introduce the concept on the landing page to provide clarity from the start. Another important insight was the potential for users to suggest new locations to add to the live streams.\n\nNext, we applied the Single Ease Question method. The total number of participants was 7 (N=7), ranging in age from 25 to 40 years old, with an average age of M=32 years old (SD=5.62; range: 25 to 40). The following questions were asked:\n\nQ1: Did you understand the purpose of the website the first time you opened it?\n\nQ2: Was it easy to find the important information?\n\nQ3: Were the presented data impactful and easily readable?\n\nQ4: Is there anything that lacks sufficient affordance as an interactive element?\n\nQ5: Are you satisfied with the experience you just had?\n\nQ6: Do you find the transposition of the travel experience into a purely digital one relevant?\n\nQ7: Do you feel more aware of the problem after completing this experience?\n\nQ8: Do you believe this experience might help you be more careful in your future trips and holidays?\n\nTo complete the test with the Likert Scale [23] each potential user marked their response in a spectrum of 7 degrees of agreement, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\n\nThe following table presents the mean and standard deviation (STDEV) results of the responses obtained (Table 1).\n\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 MEAN 6 6,14 5,43 6,86 6 6,86 7 7 STDEV 0,57 0,69 1,27 0,38 0,82 0,38 0 0\n\nGiven these results, according to the “Single Ease Question” method, most markers have a mean greater than 5.5, representing a score within the average on the SEQ scale [24]. This analysis shows that participants were able to easily interact with the skins and had a generally positive experience.\n\nThe standard deviation (STDEV), in general, demonstrates that most of the values that represent the responses in the Likert Scale of the test are very homogeneous, since they are smaller than 1.0. The question that may generate the most varied responses is Q3.\n\nIn this project, we would also want to gather feedback from users regarding their emotional states when they are experiencing the website.\n\nThe subjectivity of emotional experience has always been an obstacle to the integration of emotion as a topic of scientific investigation, and it can be difficult to measure. The discrete approach considers that all human beings have an innate set of biologically determined basic emotions that can be identified by an individual's facial expression, the result of biological processes. In turn, dimensional models define human emotions in spaces situated in dimensions. An individual's emotional state can be described as a zone within a dimensional space. In this context, Russell (1980) presented a Circumplex Model of Affect [25], in which he proposes that all affective states result from only two fundamental neurophysiological systems. He defined the dimensions Valence (corresponding to a pleasure-displeasure continuum) and Arousal or Activation. In this model, emotions are distributed in a two-dimensional circular space, with Arousal represented on the vertical axis and Valence on the horizontal axis.\n\nOur goal was to understand the emotions of users while navigating a stream on the website and for this purpose, we applied the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) test.\n\nParticipants were asked to rate the levels of pleasure and tranquility they experienced during the stream. The SAM test aimed to assess whether the prototype provided participants with feelings of happiness or unhappiness, excitement, or calmness.\n\nFigure 9 displays the results of the SAM assessment, where each participant is represented by a colored circle.\n\nRegarding Valence, most indicated a pleasant experience. On the Arousal scale, there is a clear tendency for calm. Thus, it can be inferred that the experience brought a considerable level of pleasure and curiosity, and a feeling of calm, which was expected.\n\n7 CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, the issues of overtourism, tourism carrying capacity, and sustainable tourism are all interconnected and require careful consideration to achieve long-term sustainable development in the tourism industry. Sustainable tourism practices offer a solution to address the challenges posed by overtourism and to achieve a balance between economic development, environmental protection, and social well-being. By adopting sustainable tourism principles, destinations can strive for a more responsible and resilient tourism industry.\n\nThis involves diversifying tourism offerings, promoting off-peak visitation, engaging local communities in decision-making processes, and implementing effective management strategies to preserve natural and cultural resources.\n\nIt is important for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and local communities to collaborate and develop comprehensive destination management plans that prioritize sustainable tourism practices. This includes investing in infrastructure, improving waste management systems, regulating visitor numbers, and implementing educational programs to promote responsible tourism behavior among visitors. Furthermore, the use of technology and data analytics can play a significant role in monitoring tourist flows and identifying potential risks of overtourism.\n\nThe pursuit of sustainable tourism should be a collective effort, driven by collaboration, innovation, and a long-term vision for the well-being of both present and future generations. REC-OVERtourism is a small contribution towards these objectives. It provides an opportunity to explore popular destinations that have had to close their doors due to overwhelming visitor numbers and unsustainable practices.\n\nThis allows the entire ecosystem to recover and restore its balance. Users can immerse themselves in the location's beauty through live camera streams and enjoy breathtaking views from various vantage points throughout the city. Most users reported a pleasant experience and a clear inclination towards calmness.\n\nUltimately, we believe that we can raise awareness among users to adopt more sustainable practices when planning their travels to other countries."
