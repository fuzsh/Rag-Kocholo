        "text": "Coming up on the weekend of June 1, 2024, Unbound Gravel, formerly known as the Dirty Kanza, is a mass-start event that takes place in the Tallgrass Prairie and Flint Hills around Emporia, Kansas, in the middle of the United States. With five race distances on offer and 4,000 attendees, Unbound has become the world’s marquee gravel event.\n\nThe famous 200-mile course is a true test of endurance, self-sufficiency and equipment. In addition to needing to fuel oneself for 11+ hours of riding, the sharp flint rocks are notorious for slicing tires and dashing podium aspirations. Along the way, riders also need to contend with the undulating terrain and the weather.\n\nThe Midwest is notorious for its unpredictable weather, with the end of May bringing a dynamic mix of thunderstorms with heavy rain and hail, sudden temperature swings from unseasonable heat waves to chilly spells, and even the occasional tornado, meaning that riders must be prepared for anything.\n\nFor those seeking the ultimate challenge, organizers added a 350-mile option in 2018. This epic, named the Unbound XL has been won in the past by riders such a Rebecca \"the Queen of Pain\" Rusch and ultra-endurance star Lael Wilcox and sees riders suffering for 24 or more hours.\n\nNow in 18th year, the 200-mile Unbound Gravel race is more competitive than ever before and riders have to enter a lottery for a chance to score a race entry — a far cry from its humble beginnings of just 34 riders in 2006.\n\nThis year's all-star cast of competitors includes America's best off-road racers including the dominant Keegan Swenson, EF Education's Lachlan Morton and former winners Ian Boswell and Pete Stetina.\n\nThe ever-growing international presence has never been stronger with the likes of Olympic and Roubaix champion Greg van Avermaet, gravel world champion Matej Mohorič, 2024 Cape Epic winner Matt Beers, former Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix winner Niki Terpstra, and of course, the so-called Dutch Mafia with Laurens ten Dam and 2022 Unbound winner Ivar Slik among them, all taking to the start on Saturday.\n\nIn the women’s field, the female champions from the last four editions, Carolin Schiff, Sofia Gomez Villafane, Lauren De Crescenzo and Amity Rockwell are all returning to fight for the crown but competition will be stiff. Among the list of favorites are Canyon-SRAM's Tiffany Cromwell —fresh off a win at UCI Gravel World Series’ Swartberg 100 race, Traka 360 winner Karolina Migoń, reigning Gravel Earth Series champion Annabel Fisher, SD Worx's Geerike Schreurs and last year's podium finisher Sarah Sturm. See the full start lists below.\n\nRacing and riding aside, the week of Unbound is filled with parties, tech launches and an industry expo, all bringing some $5 million USD to the small college town.\n\nThe Race Within the Race\n\nContributing to the stacked fields of the 200-mile event is the fact that Unbound is also the second stop of the Life Time Grand Prix series, in which a cast of 60 handpicked WorldTour roadies, cyclocrossers and MTB Olympians compete for a $250,000 prize purse over the course of the U.S.'s hardest gravel and mountain bike races.\n\nUnbound Gravel: The 200-mile Course\n\nEquipment and handling skill will play a big part in who triumphs at this year's race.\n\nFollowing the mud-bogged mayhem of the 2023 event, characterized by ripped-off derailleurs and broken frames, the 2024 edition promises a challenge of a different kind with its chunkiest and most technical course yet.\n\nThis year, the race course heads north, a direction it has only ventured twice before. Rocky and technical, the 200-mile course may just be its most challenging yet, organizers say.\n\nThe course covers 202.9 miles of harsh gravel roads with approximately 11,000 feet of climbing—more than its previous north course editions. Surface types will range from fast gravel roads to chunky doubletrack and only a little bit of pavement, with 92% of the course marked as unpaved. There will be two checkpoints where riders can meet their crews and receive outside support and two neutral water support 'oases.'\n\nRead the full course report, here.\n\nHow to follow Unbound Gravel live\n\nSadly, following access problems, the Life Time Grand Prix Series and FloSports ceased the broadcasting of the Life Time Grand Prix series. But while there's no live broadcasting of the Unbound race action, you can follow updates via social media and the official timing website.\n\nThere are timing mats throughout the course, spaced approximately 10 miles apart, allowing fans to follow along. Time splits will be available on Athlinks.\n\nRace updates from the Elite men’s race can be followed in the Instagram stories of the @lifetimegrandprix. The Elite women's race will be shared via Instagram stories on the @unboundgravel account.\n\nAn extended highlights reel will be made available on Monday, June 3, as well. And we'll of course have the race reports post-event.\n\nUnbound Gravel: 2024 Start lists\n\nLatest Unbound Gravel 2024 News"
