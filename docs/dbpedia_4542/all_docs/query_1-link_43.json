Averill; Hardesty & CO., Publishers, Chicago and Toledo. 1882.]\n\nDr. Jabez True\n\nJabez True, son of Rev. Henry True, was born in Hampstead, New Hampshire, in 1796. It was the practice of the time for clergymen to instruct the youth and prepare young men for college. Rev. Mr. True had a class of this kind under his instruction. His son, Jabez, acquired sufficient knowledge of the languages to enable him to pursue a course of medicine with advantage. He read medicine in his native town, and completed his course near the close of the Revolution. He volunteered his services as surgeon of a privateer and sailed for Europe. Soon after commencing the cruise, the vessel was wrecked on the coast of Holland, and the marines thrown on the mercy of the Hollanders. Dr. True remained in Europe until the cessation of hostilities, when he returned to America and began to practice his profession in New Hampshire. Dr. True became a member of the Ohio Company in 1787, and came to Marietta in the spring of 1788. He built a small log office on Muskingum street. The new country did not afford a lucrative practice, but it was a fortunate circumstance that skilled physicians were present. He was employed at the opening of the Indian war as surgeon's mate for the troops and rangers, at a salary of $22 per month. During this time he also taught school a part of the time in one of the block-houses of the garrison at \"the Point\" Smallpox and scarlet fever broke out in 1790 and made it necessary for the doctors to visit the settlements, which, during the Indian war, could only be done by water, as none but trained rangers trusted themselves to enter the roadless forest; visits at that time even by water were extremely hazardous, but the sick required attention and Dr. True frequently risked his life to respond to the calls of duty. Dr. True was celebrated for his kindness and sympathy. So far as it was possible he patronized the prejudices of his patient and never resorted to radical remedies, except in cases of absolute necessity. \"The result of his calm, deliberative judgment was generally correct, and his treatment of diseases remarkably successful, which was doubtless owing to its simplicity, for it is a lamentable fact that too many die from too many and improper remedies as well as from disease itself.\" After the close of the Indian war, he improved a farm on the Ohio about a mile from Marietta, and took an interest in agricultural pursuits. His practice extended over a large area of territory, sometimes requiring him to ride 20 miles through forests and over bridgeless streams. The practice of medicine at that time was by no means lucrative. The general poverty of the people necessitated low charges and in many cases no charges at all, neither for medicines nor professional services. Dr. True's devotion to the church cannot be omitted from any sketch of his life, howjever brief. He joined the Congregational Church at an early period of its organization and was for many years a deacon. His house was a home for itinerant preachers, and his purse always open to needy charities. Dr. True, for several of the last years of his life, served as county treasurer, a position which afforded him ease and a moderate income. In 1806 Dr. True married Mrs. Mills, the widow of Capt. Charles Mills, an amiable and excellent women. He had no children, but the children of his wife were treated with all the love and affection of a real father. He died during the epidemic of 1823.

Anthony]\n\nMajor Anselem Tupper\n\nMajor Anselem Tupper, son of Gen. Benjamin Tupper, was born in Easton, Mass., October 11, 1763. In 1779, at the age of sixteen, he was appointed adjutant of Col. Ebenezer Sproat's regiment, which was engaged at Trenton, Princeton, and Monmouth. He served hrough the war, and was a member of the Society of Cincinnati. In 1786 he was with his father in the survy of the seven ranges, and when the Ohio Company was formed he became a shareholder and was engaged by them as a surveyor, and \"arrived at Marietta in the company of forty-eight, April 7, 1788.\" At the organization of the military companies at Marietta, in 1789, under Col. Sproat, \"Anselm Tupper was appointed post-major, and had command of Cpmpius Martius during the war.\" That winter he taught school in one of the block-houses of the fort. He was the secretary of the Union Lodge of Free Masons, before whom he delivered an address on St. John's day, 1790. Major Tupper was a brilliant man and a favorite in society. He died, unmarried at Marietta, December 25, 1808. - The Founders of Ohio [HIstorical Collection of Ohio By Henry Howe, 1902 - Transcribed By TK]\n\nBenjamin Tupper\n\nBenjamin Tupper was born in Stoughton, Mass., in August, 1738; died in Marietta, O., in June 1792. He served in the French war of 1756-63 and was in the field the whole of the Revolutionary war. In August, 1776, he commanded the gunboats and galleys on the North river. He served under Gen. Gates at Saratoga, was at the battle of Monmouth in 1788, and was breveted a general before the war closed. In 1785, he was appointed one of the surveyors of the Northwest Territory. With Gen. Rufus Putnam he originated the Ohio Land Company. In 1786 he took an active part in suppressing Shay's rebellion. Early in 1788 he removed to Marietta with his family, and that of his son-in-law, Ichabod Nye, reaching there 19th August 1788. These families and those of Col. N. Cushing and Maj. Goodale, who accompanied them, were the first families to settle in what is now the State of Ohio. Gen. Tupper was appointed Judge of the Common PLeas in September, 1788, and with Gen. Putnam, held the first court in the Northwest Territory. The following entry in Dr. Cutler's journal indicates that Gen. Tupper was the real inventor of the screw propeller: \"Friday, August 15, 1788. This morning we went pretty early to the boat. Gen. Tupper had mentioned to me a mode for constructing a machine to work in the head of stern of a boat instead of oars. It appeared to me highly probable it might succeed. I therefore proposed that we should make the experiment. Assisted by a number of people, we went to work, and constructed a machine in the form of a screw of the boat, which we turned with a crank. It succeeded to admiration and I think it a very useful discovery.\" - Life of Rev. Manasseh Cutler. [Historical Collection of Ohio By Henry Howe, 1902 - Transcribed By TK]\n\nDean Tyler\n\nDean Tyler, Esa., was a native of Haverhill, Mass., and liberally educated at one of the New England colleges. He possessed a brilliant mind, an agreeable person, and refined manners. In early life he formed an attachment to a young lady, who returned it with equal affection. But the wayward course of lovers sometimes crosses all their purposes; a misunderstanding occurred, which induced Tyler to embark for Europe, to flee from that which had really become necessary to his happiness. He took passage in a letter of marque for Bourdeaux. On the voyage out and back, he met with some fighting, some storms, and had several narrow escapes. These incidents probably helped to cure him of his jealousy, or whatever it was that caused him to go on this adventure. He returned with a full determination to confess his fault, and unite himself with her whom he had so abruptly parted from. But it was too late; he had broken the heart of his loved one, and the first news he heard on landing, was, that she was deadâhad died of a broken heart. The shock entirely overcame him; he was attacked with a violent illness, followed with delirium, and narrowly escaped that death he would willingly have suffered, could it atone for his error. His recovery was slow and tedious; and it was a long time before he could attend to any business. As soon as he was able to travel, he joined the Ohio Company adventurers, then in the opening of their enterprise to occupy the great west, and redeem it from the wilderness. He attached himself, in 1789, to the settlement of Waterford and, with them, drew a donation lot of one hundred acres. He was a brave and active pioneer; exposing himself to danger on every occasion, and doing all he could for the benefit of the inhabitants. During the winter months, he taught school; and on the Sabbath officiated as chaplain, reading the sermons of some able divine, and conducting the public devotions, which were regularly kept up during the period of the war, as well as subsequently. As a man, he was much respected by the pioneers, and the garrison built for their protection, was called Fort Tyler. He never married, but continued a bachelor to the end of his days. His habits were rather studious and sedentary; except when danger threatened the inhabitants from an Indian attack, when he was alert and active. In his latter years he became rather intemperate, probably hoping to drown his melancholy reflections in the inebriating bowl. His name is still fondly cherished by the descendants of his pioneer companions. [Source: A History of Belpre, Washington County, Ohio, by C. E. Dickinson, 1920, Transcribed by C. Anthony]"
