        "text": "(Aquila;53471)\n\n(Kriss;53413)\n\n]I have read the entire Bible on more occasions than I can count and there is no teaching of Universal Salvation We can go over every scripture one at a time and it still wont matter you can read whatever you want to see into them but that doesnt mean its right,\n\nI commend you for your Bible reading, however, many throughout the centuries have read the Bible all the way through and have entirely missed doctrinal truths found in Scripture. (Kriss;53413)\n\nI do not have time to go over every scripture you have quoted nowbut you have not answered the core questionWhy send Christ at all, why have a flesh age God could just have forgiven everyonr there sins and ended it,\n\nHad Christ not come and sacrificed his life for mankind all of mankind would be eternally separated from God. But on account of His blood, all things will eventually be reconciled unto God. Satan will have one nothing.(Kriss;53413)\n\nI could point out you are not taking into account some of these verse are talking about the plan of the ages and his second coming.\n\nThe second coming is an entirely different subject. I assure you that God will punish evil doers. However, God will bring them to their knees...not revel in their eternal torment. God isn't running a torture chamber, God isn't of the same character as Saddam Hussein. God's punishment is intended to be redemptive...not sadistic. The plan of the ages will end with all creation being brought into reconciliation with God.(Kriss;53413)\n\n\"For it is written, \"As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.\" This applies not only to the living in the flesh at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, but also to all souls that go the the Father, when they die in the flesh body.\n\nPlease show me chapter and verse for this idea. I contend that it is speaking of the consummation of all things...I Corinthians 15:27-2827For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. 28And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess when all things are put under his feet and all things are subdued unto him. And in that day the Son will be subject to the Father and God may be \"all\" in \"all\". Here we see the reconciliation of all of creation.(Kriss;53413)\n\nI know we are told there is no sin in the thrid earth age and that Satan and all those mentioned in Rev 21:8 are destroyed.\n\nGod isn't Shiva the Destroyer of Hindu faith. God is a savior, a loving God. God will not allow sin and Satan to destroy his children. None are expendable. God is and will be VICTORIOUS against sin and Satan. If sin and Satan succeeds in securing the eternal torment or destruction of just one soul...God's salvific purpose was defeated in that individual and God failed to be all in that one...but Scripture says that God will be all in all. Praise God! Please note that in Revelation 22 the wicked are mentioned again...they are not destroyed in chapter 21. Notice what it reads...Revelation 22:14-1514Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 15For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.Notice that the sinful are outside of the eternal city...but no lake of fire is mentioned. While these are not permitted to enter the city, they are no longer in the lake of fire and are reigned over for all eternity. (Kriss;53413)\n\nI also know there are no condradictions in Gods Word you want to believe all those that follow Satan, all the murders, rapists, and evil at heart will be saved I guess you will have to believe it but it is not what is taught.\n\nDoes God forgive murderers, rapists, the evil at heart and save them today??? Does God ever change???Who holds the keys to death and hell???Who descended into hell and redeemed those souls who were once disobedient going back to the time of Noah???Who is capable of delivering a soul confined in the lowest hell???Psalm 86:13For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.Who turns men to destruction...and causes them to return again???Psalm 90:3Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.God is a restorer not a destroyer. Lamentations 3:31-3331 For the Lord will not cast off for ever:32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.God is big enough to redeem all men from death and hell. How big is your God?Why am I not surprised? You are missing quite a bit. Yes Christ is the Saviour of all men, (Acts 4:12, I Timothy 4:12) But God allows Satan to do his thing to corrupt His plans to see if His children wants Him. Satan will die the second death, (Ezekiel 28:18) as His children who would rather follow the father of all lies (John 8:44) although Satan is His child as well. (John 3:16, Psalm 37:20) The second death is the death of one soul (Ezekiel 18:4, Ezekiel 18:20) (Revelation 20:14)Like I said not everybody wants Him, therefore, not everybody can be saved. All God wants is His children to repent (II Peter 3:9) and follow Him (John 14:6, John 14:15)Revelation 22 is future, which is after Revelation 20 and Revelation 21.Grace is only in this flesh age (Ephesians 2:8-10, Romans 11:6) and the Melinneum is likely not going to be grace but being judge according to their works.So no, Universal Salvation is completely unscriptural.\n\n(Aquila;53577)\n\n(thesuperjag;53473)\n\nWhy am I not surprised?

Hell was created for the devil and his angels. Souls will only suffer until they have paid what is due and submit to Christ's rule.We were once angels, hope you know that at least. Considering the fact you say that Hell is only for Satan (who is God's son) and his angels (who is also God's sons) and then say \"Souls will only suffer until they have paid what is due and submit to Christ's rule\" is contradicting each other literally and big time. Which one is it?I serve a God who can never lie. (Romans 3:4, I John 1:5) I serve a God who can't force anybody to love Him. (John 14:15) What I don't serve is a god who want to torture a soul until they come to christ. (II Corinthians 11:4, II Corinthians 11:14, II Corinthians 4:4)\n\n(thesuperjag;53480)\n\nWe were once angels, hope you know that at least.

The human soul will only suffer until they have paid what is due and submit to Christ's rule.\n\nI serve a God who can never lie. (Romans 3:4, I John 1:5)\n\nI serve a God who can never lie. He promised to draw all men unto himself and reconcile all things. Not only is my God incapable of lying...he's powerful enough to do what he says.I serve a God who can't force anybody to love Him. (John 14:15)I serve a God who CAN do all things, including use eternity to break the stubborn will of his children and bring them back into fellowship with himself.\n\nWhat I don't serve is a god who want to torture a soul until they come to christ. (II Corinthians 11:4, II Corinthians 11:14, II Corinthians 4:4)\n\nNo...you serve a destroyer. I serve a Savior. You have to study the Greek wording Jesus used in Matthew 25:46,Matthew 25:46And these shall go away into everlasting (aionious) punishment (kolasis): but the righteous into life eternal. \"Aionious\" means an age of unknown duration and \"kolasis\" means \"correction\" or \"punishment\", but unlike the typical Greek word for this, \"kolasis\" is based on \"kolazo\" meaning \"to correct by pruning\" and is used in Greek secular literature for rehabiliative punishments. I often put my son in timeout or give him a swat on the bottom. Why? Because I love him. My disciplining my son brings him into obedience to my will. What kind of father would I be if I tortured my son or destroyed him if he refused to listen? Is not God as loving a father as I am? Or am I more loving than God?Your view doesn't bode well with God's nature...God is Love. And Love NEVER fails.\n\n(Aquila;53489)\n\n(thesuperjag;53480)\n\nWe were once angels, hope you know that at least.

That's true love right there. It is also true love to tell the Truth.\n\n(thesuperjag;53527)\n\nYes, but not in men's interpretation of it.Matthew 7:21 - Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Matthew 7:22 - Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?Matthew 7:23 - And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.It won't change the fact that God can not force anybody to love Him. That's true love right there. It is also true love to tell the Truth.\n\nIn your theology God forces love. God says, “Love me or burn in Hell forever.” My point is that God doesn’t do that. God will sufficiently punish the sinner for their sin. However the sinner will eventually surrender in sincerity to God’s love and rule over their lives and be delivered from said punishment. In the verses you gave the issue is entering into the kingdom of heaven. Jesus’ point was that not everyone who merely professes adoration of him will enter the kingdom of heaven, only those who sincerely come to him seeking salvation and allow him to be Lord in their lives. But there is good news, the Bible tells us hilippians 2:10-11That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the GLORY of God the Father.You see, we know that all will one day sincerely make him Lord over their souls. This dovetails with the truth that all things will be reconciled to God in the verses I gave above. God isn’t going to just throw away the majority of humanity. God has offered his grace that all men might be saved from entering eternal punishment (meaning punishment of an eternal nature not duration). But although few will be saved from this punishment, it is this punishment that will serve as a refiner’s fire to purify and bring all mankind into reconciliation to him. You’re only reading and telling half of the story.\n\n(Aquila;53559)\n\n(thesuperjag;53527)\n\nYes, but not in men's interpretation of it.Matthew 7:21 - Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.Matthew 7:22 - Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?Matthew 7:23 - And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.It won't change the fact that God can not force anybody to love Him.

You’re only reading and telling half of the story. First off, would you please stop twisting my words. I never said \"God forces love\" In fact I said quite the opposite. 'It won't change the fact that God can not force anybody to love Him.'Secondly, I do not believe a \"Burning in Hell forever\" doctrine as it is well proven earlier in this topic. You are not taking all of my post as a collective data, but rather base my last and single post on what you think on what I said.Half the story? Nay.\n\n(thesuperjag;53562)\n\nFirst off, would you please stop twisting my words. I never said \"God forces love\" In fact I said quite the opposite.

Here you have a God that warns, “Love me or I’ll destroy you forever.” A God who claims to be love…yet is willing to absolutely destroy the vast majority of the creation he made in his image. Certainly the absolute horror of one facing what they know will be their absolute destruction would cause an infinite degree of terror in the moments leading up to one’s destruction. Satan still wins and succeeds in using sin to destroy the vast majority of God’s creation. Sorry, I still cannot ascribe to the idea that a loving, all powerful and all knowing God would do that or allow that. Also it rejects the ultimate aim of God’s redemptive plan …the reconciliation of all things. The Universal Salvation position puts forth a biblically sound view of a victorious God whose love conquers all. Sin and Satan win NOTHING.

I never said \"God forces love\" In fact I said quite the opposite. 'It won't change the fact that God can not force anybody to love Him.'Secondly, I do not believe a \"Burning in Hell forever\" doctrine as it is well proven earlier in this topic. You are not taking all of my post as a collective data, but rather base my last and single post on what you think on what I said.Half the story? Nay.\n\nSo you believe that God will eternally destroy the majority of mankind? Does this not face some of the very same issues of the eternal torment perspective? Here you have a God that warns, “Love me or I’ll destroy you forever.” A God who claims to be love…yet is willing to absolutely destroy the vast majority of the creation he made in his image. Certainly the absolute horror of one facing what they know will be their absolute destruction would cause an infinite degree of terror in the moments leading up to one’s destruction. Satan still wins and succeeds in using sin to destroy the vast majority of God’s creation. Sorry, I still cannot ascribe to the idea that a loving, all powerful and all knowing God would do that or allow that. Also it rejects the ultimate aim of God’s redemptive plan …the reconciliation of all things. The Universal Salvation position puts forth a biblically sound view of a victorious God whose love conquers all. Sin and Satan win NOTHING.

Hence the reason there is a second death. (Revelation 20:14) Without free will, there is no true love to make a choice. (John 14:15)Another thing, that is a long list of people, Christ being in there is a false claim, so does the Hebrew prophets in the OT, and so does the people you listed in the NT. One false person in the list makes the whole list false.You are perverting the Words of the Living God, even Christ.\n\n(Aquila;53660)\n\n(thesuperjag;53568)\n\nI believe God gave us a free will to choose either Christ or Satan. Hence the reason there is a second death. (Revelation 20:14) Without free will, there is no true love to make a choice. (John 14:15)\n\nAmen, we have free will. A person can choose to reject God and go to hell. There they will pay dearly for their sin and the flames will torment their souls…however, at some point in eternity God’s Word assures us that every knee will bow and every tongue will confess to the glory of God. Eventually all humanity will freely choose to embrace the sacrificial atonement of Jesus Christ. God’s love will win. And about free will…if your two year old son wanted to play in the street…would you just shrug your shoulders and say, “Oh well, I have to acknowledge his free will or I don’t love him.” WRONG. Any loving parent would do whatever it takes to yank them out of the street and break the will of that child. I love my son too much to give him free will. (thesuperjag;53568)\n\nAnother thing, that is a long list of people, Christ being in there is a false claim,\n\nJesus said, John 12:32And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. All means all.(thesuperjag;53568)\n\nso does the Hebrew prophets in the OT, and so does the people you listed in the NT. One false person in the list makes the whole list false.\n\nLuke wrote, Acts 3: 20-21And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.All means all.(thesuperjag;53568)\n\nYou are perverting the Words of the Living God, even Christ.\n\nYou’re ignoring the Word of the Living God. Read above.So you ignore the second death, the death of one soul (not only am I talking about Satan and his angels)(am talking about the souls of a humam being as well, Ezekiel 18:4, Ezekiel 18:20, Revelation 20:14)Reference Revelation 20:8-10, Revelation 20:15Now concerning about free will about a parents choosing a decision for a child, if I was a parent, I still do the same thing, to keep my child(ren) safe.All I'm saying is, Christ, God's prophet, Christ's apostles (and other NT people) does not support your Universal Salvation doctrine, but the other people in your list might have.\n\n(Aquila;53660)\n\nJesus said, John 12:32And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. All means all.Luke wrote, Acts 3: 20-21And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.All means all.You’re ignoring the Word of the Living God. Read above.\n\nI do not believe Jag is ignoring anything here. However, you *might* be (I think you are), and so I'm not sure what your point is.\n\nJohn 12:32And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.​\n\nJesus said that all would be drawn to Him, *IF* He is lifted up. The word *if* indicates that He can be lifted up (so we have to decide, when is if, and how does if happen?), and when He is lifted up (if He is) He will draw all men to Him. Also, there is that word *draw*--what does it mean? I can be drawn to something, and not receive it. Draw does not guarantee reception, and it most certainly does not guarantee salvation. This sctipture is a weak support for universal salvation. I am often drawn to chocolate cake, but I don't always eat it. I am often drawn to lots of things I may or may not actually receive. Jesus, is certainly no different, in that He draws us, but we must receive Him.Jesus says that He stands at the door and knocks... and *if* (there is that word if again) anyone opens, He will come in and sup with them. Jesus draws all of us to Himself, but not all come. Not all open the door either.On the second part, I do not understand your point. The prophets of old all spoke of the Messiah. What does this have to do with universal salvation? I am unconvinced. Should I be?\n\nThe state of \"death\" or being \"dead\" is often presented in the figurative sense. For exmaple in repentance we die to sin and the flesh. The New Testament states, Romans 6:2God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?Romans 6:7For he that is dead is freed from sin.Romans 6:8Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:Romans 6:11Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.Romans 7:4Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.Romans 7:6But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.Galatians 2:19For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.Colossians 2:20Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,Colossians 3:3For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.2 Timothy 2:11It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:If one rejects repentance and refuses to die to the flesh...they must endure the Second Death. The Second Death is a sentence to produce the \"dying\" necessary to conform the will and character of those punished to will of God. In the lake of fire they suffer \"death\", the dying of their sinful wills that they might cryout and live in Christ as God reconciles \"all things\" unto himself. Acts 3:20-21And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.\n\n(Aquila;53668)\n\nThe state of \"death\" or being \"dead\" is often presented in the figurative sense.
