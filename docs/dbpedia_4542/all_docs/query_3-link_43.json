        "text": "It’s fashionable to gossip about the aristocracy, to decry loafer-wearers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg as fusty and irrelevant, outdated and out-of-touch. “Come the revolution..!” scream those who believe the upper classes are a relic from another age. And admittedly, the behaviour of certain Old Etonian politicians in recent years has encouraged the idea that the average toff is a bumbling, half-witted pillock. But to be fair, all sorts of politicians are bumbling and half-witted. This isn’t exclusively the preserve of Old Etonians.\n\nActually, there are plenty of useful life lessons one can learn from the average posh person. I know this from five years of working at Tatler, an arduous job where I spent most of my time criss-crossing the country, going from castle to castle interviewing dukes and earls while old, slobbery labradors shoved their noses in my crotch.\n\nPlenty of them remain fairly eccentric (the aristos, I mean, not the labradors). One duke had an ashtray for his cigars that was shaped like a penis; another was the elephant-polo champion of Scotland. And yet the upper classes are still with us, however much the hammer-and-sickle mob wish they weren’t. How have they survived so many centuries?\n\nWell, they’re generally not into self-help books or mindfulness. You won’t catch a toff on the beach reading How to Win Friends and Influence People or The Power of Now. The supposed benefits of hygge have passed them by; nor do they go on detox holidays or listen to podcasts about breathing to quieten their anxiety. Because the truth is the British upper classes have developed their own way of managing along the centuries, which still stands them in pretty good stead today. True, the big house and inherited wealth helps a bit. But they have other tricks up their tweedy sleeves, which have helped preserve things just the way they like them, so here are a few tips I noticed along the way…\n\nThe Plus One by Sophia Money-Coutts is published on Aug 9 (HQ, £12.99)\n\nTen lessons we can learn from Britain's upper class\n\n1. Be frugal\n\nThe typical aristo is mind-bogglingly so. Often due to necessity; if you’ve got a leak in the roof that’s going to cost £200,000 you can’t go around the place eating caviar and flying on private jets. Those sort of fripperies are for oligarchs. With an overwhelming number of posh people, frugality is an in-built character trait which has been passed down the generations, like weak chins or long noses.\n\nNothing should be wasted – whether that be clothes, food, bath water, jam jars that have carried marmalade since the Victorian age, stained napkins that have been in use for a week or more. Even tea bags. Sir Benjamin Slade, eccentric 72-year-old baronet who has frozen his own sperm in the hope that he may still have an heir who can take over his 100-acre estate in Somerset, uses his tea bags twice. In 2014, I interviewed a charming character called Anselm Guise, who inherited his great-uncle’s 16th-century stately, just outside Stroud, and had to transform the place after decades of neglect. In one cupboard, he found an old cigar box with a label on it that read: “Pieces of string with no use any more.”\n\nThe Queen herself is an exceptional example of frugality. She once sent a lemon garnish back to the kitchen because she hadn’t touched it and thought it should be reused. She keeps her cornflakes in Tupperware so they remain fresher for longer. She recycles suits and some of her handbags date back 30 or 40 years. She keeps wrapping paper to use for next time.\n\nLara Grylls, sister of Bear and daughter of late Tory politician Sir Michael Grylls, is another I interviewed while at Tatler and who told me that “Granny Grylls” did all her Christmas shopping for that year in the January sales. Although toffs rarely buy anything new, as a rule. In part because they inherit quite a lot – houses, furniture, art and the like. But also because buying anything new is deemed extravagant and wasteful. They are, in one sense, the original eco-warriors.\n\n2. Go for a long walk\n\nSylvia Plath said she knew of nothing which could not be cured by a hot bath and toffs apply the same principle to a good walk. Ideally on very remote land that they own, romping several miles across Scottish hills or Yorkshire moorland after lunch but before tea. You are unlikely to see a duke or an earl on a treadmill or in a Zumba class because that would mean exercising alongside other people and being indoors. They are outdoorsy people, happy in any sort of weather, and like a dog to be walking outside with them.\n\nThe toff will often pretend that the walk is simply for the benefit of the dog but this is not true. They need lungfuls of fresh air and hours outside in the elements quite as much as Bingo the labrador. How would they get such ruddy complexions otherwise? In recent years, it has also become fashionable for female toffs to take up yoga, often going to India for several months to take a teacher-training course there as part of an extended gap-year. (The posh gap year can mean up to six or seven years of travelling and flower arranging courses). One of the most over-subscribed yoga classes in Chelsea is taught by the future Countess of Sandwich.\n\n3. Eat simply\n\nNothing too fussy. The average posho’s diet is similar to the Paleo Diet, which stipulates that you only eats foods that were available to human beings during the Paleolithic era from around 10,000 to 2.5 million years ago. This means meat, vegetables, fruit and nuts. Snacks that can be hunted and gathered, in other words. And as the upper classes remain very into shooting, hunting and fishing, this works splendidly. It’s not uncommon for a toff to be given his first taste of grouse aged three or four.\n\nAnd when I once went to the Badminton Horse Trials for Tatler – a sort of upper-class Glastonbury except with horses instead of musical acts – I spotted a food stall that was selling “pheasant goujons.” Nursery food such as shepherd’s pie, cottage pie and fish pie are also popular, alongside peas and carrots.\n\nThere is also something referred to quietly as “engagement roast chicken”. This is a dish cooked by young Sloanes in the hope that their other half will be so bowled over by the deliciousness of the chicken that they propose. And then, last November, Meghan Markle revealed that Prince Harry proposed to her over roast chicken. Ergo, it works.\n\n4. Be more dog\n\nMost aristocrats aren’t that religious. True, they may have their own church or chapel within their house or castle, but that’s just for Christmas Day, weddings and christenings. What the toff actually worships is the dog. Mostly the labrador, although certain breeds of terrier and spaniels are also acceptable. And in this age of mindfulness, the behaviour of the dog is certainly worth paying attention to. Dogs live in the moment, they live in the now. They want to gnaw that stick or fetch that ball immediately. Dogs do not sit around wishing that they’d been funnier at that dinner party or obsessing about what they should wear for the parent-teacher meeting next week.\n\nA dog does not worry that it ate too many calories for supper last night or obsess about how many likes it got for its last Instagram post. Dogs don’t bear grudges. Should someone have forgotten to unload the dishwasher or take the bins out, the dog won’t get cross.\n\nThe dog will remain cheerful and unfazed instead of sulking for several days. Social awkwardness is entirely alien to a dog, too. They couldn’t give a fig about whether to kiss someone on the cheek when meeting them or go for a handshake. They simply go straight for a sniff of their bottom. Much quicker, much more honest and a terrific icebreaker at parties.\n\nThe average toff loves its dog more than the members of its own family for all these reasons. When I went to interview the Duke of Northumberland at his family seat, Alnwick Castle, I was surprised to see several dogs lying very still on the backs of sofas and in the library. Upon inquiry, I was told these were beloved dead pets, which had been stuffed by a taxidermist so they could live with the family forevermore.\n\n5. Invest in a stack of loo books\n\n...and make these your main reading material. Forget self-help books, very little is cheerier than a loo-book joke for the upper classes, which is why their bathrooms remain full of yellowing, well-thumbed copies that date back to the Seventies. Wash your hands thoroughly after reading.\n\n6. Learn to tolerate the heat – and the cold\n\nTemperature extremes don’t matter much to the upper classes. Who can afford to double-glaze when you’ve got 264 windows? They especially love the cold because it means they can dress up in several layers of tweed and deploy household items that you might otherwise assume went out with the penny farthing – hot water bottles, draught excluders. The Queen still uses an electric heater from time to time at Balmoral.\n\nThey find the heat less enjoyable – those red faces – but they still bear it with stoicism, wearing a pair of pink shorts and a panama hat. Given that the pace of global warming seems to be cracking on, there’s a lot we can learn from the aristocrat when it comes to temperature control.\n\n7. Cultivate a vegetable patch\n\nVery sustainable, this. I was often sent back to London after interviews with carrier bags full of potatoes or runner beans, as if whoever I’d interviewed was suspicious that vegetables didn’t exist in London. After an interview and photo shoot at a grand hedge-funder’s house in Wiltshire last year, I drove back to the city with a carload of asparagus. My mother often sends me back to my flat with a carton of fresh eggs laid by her bantams, still covered with authentic chicken poo and downy feathers.\n\nHonestly, when the apocalypse comes, and it could be any day now, it’s the upper classes with their vegetable patches and orchards who will be laughing. Strong survival instincts.\n\n8. Embrace social media\n\nIn the old days, Nanny’s maxim was “nobody’s looking at you, dear”. But now you can find many aristos on Instagram – Viscountess Weymouth (28,700 followers), Lady Amelia Windsor (56,300 followers), Alice Naylor-Leyland (102,200 followers). Like a modern-day version of an “at home” photo shoot in Tatler, they use it to post artful photos of their houses, holidays and children.\n\nYou’ll find the odd duke on Twitter, too – the Duke of Beaufort for example, nickname “Bunter”, who tends to tweet about Jeremy Corbyn and sport. The mental health aspects do not trouble the toff because they are born with an innate sense of confidence – often referred to as “arrogance” – which allows them to post photos and tweets without worrying about any mental repercussions. Thus David Cameron can still be found tweeting about things such as football and the Queen’s birthday.\n\n9. Remember basic, old fashioned manners\n\nThe Hyacinth Buckets of this world always get this wrong and think that good manners means not saying “toilet” or “couch”. Actually, a proper posho wouldn’t dream of criticising anyone for their vocabulary or for using the wrong fork. They know that it’s awfully gauche to lambast someone for their behaviour.\n\nThere is an incredible amount of importance attached to shaking hands while looking the other people in the eye, though. It’s almost the first lesson the young posh person learns. Thus we saw Prince George and Princess Charlotte at their little brother’s christening last month, both shaking the Archbishop of Canterbury’s hand and looking at him squarely. My stepmother refers to people who can’t do this properly as having “slidey eye” and it is deemed a great crime.\n\n10. Keep buggering on\n\nThis was Churchill’s expression, but it still governs many a toff today and they apply it to almost any situation – school, marriage, illness. The “stiff upper lip” tradition of old is often criticised these days for being out of touch with our softer, more open, more emotional age. And hurrah for everybody becoming better at talking about their feelings because it’s allowed many poshos to become more comfortable with admitting that, actually, they can’t remember ever being hugged by their parents and they loathed boarding school. But at their core, they still retain an inner steeliness, a hardiness, which keeps them going.\n\nWhen I went to Knebworth House in Hertfordshire to interview its owner, Henry Lytton-Cobbold, he told me about a game the family plays called “pass the parcel.”\n\nThat is, each heir runs the 2,000-acre estate for 20 or so years before passing it down to the next generation. That is deemed long enough to handle the golden albatross before handing the keys over. The pile has been in the family since 1490, and although it’s a massive undertaking, which costs each generation millions in upkeep (thus Knebworth’s concerts came about in the Seventies), they’d rather struggle than chuck it all in and go and live in a bungalow. Self-preservation, see? The upper classes are very good at it."
