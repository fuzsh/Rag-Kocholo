        "text": "11 MARCH\n\npage 1 of 2\n\nin 1654 - Heinrich Georg Neuss, composer is born.\n\nin 1683 - Giovanni Veneziano, composer is born.\n\nin 1772 - George Reuter, composer, dies at 63.\n\nin 1781 - Anthony Philip Heinrich, (actually, Anton Philipp), prominent American composer of German Bohemian descent, is born at Schonbiichel.\n\nHe was adopted by a wealthy uncle and given lessons in violin and piano; all the same, he was mainly autodidact as a musician. At his uncle's death, he came into a rich inheritance, including property and a flourishing business. In 1805 he visited the U.S., and returned there in 1810 to pursue his business interests but without success.\n\nIn the wake of the Austrian financial debacle of 1811, he lost his wealth and returned to the U.S. in a vain attempt to restore his fortunes. After he failed again in business in 1817, he set out on a trek through the American wilderness, which took him from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, and then down the Ohio River to Bardstown, Ky.\n\nHe managed to find enough musicians to conduct one of Beethoven's symphonies in Lexington, Ky., on Nov. 12, 1817, the first known performance of a Beethoven symphony in America.\n\nIn 1818 he began to compose in earnest, which resulted in the publication of his op.1, The Dawning of Music in Kentucky, or The Pleasures of Harmony in the Solitudes of Nature (Philadelphia, 1820; rev. 1820-23), a collection of piano music, pieces for violin and piano, and songs.\n\nIt was followed by the collections The Western Minstrel, op.2 (Philadelphia, 1820; rev. 1820-23) and The Sylviad, or Minstrelsy of Nature in the Wilds of N. America, op.3 (Boston, 1823, and 1825-26). From 1826 to 1831 he pursued his career in Europe, returning there in 1833. In 1836 he received critical accolades as a composer in Graz. In 1837 he settled in N.Y. and acquired a notable reputation. His works were heard at festivals there in 1842, 1846, and 1853, and critics hailed him as \"the Beethoven of America.\"\n\nHe became affectionately known as \"Father Heinrich.\" In 1856 he returned once more to Europe. By the time he returned to N.Y. in 1859, interest in his career had plummeted and he ended his days in poverty. While Heinrich wrote some fine piano pieces and songs, he was a composer dedicated to scores on a grand scale.\n\nHis often amusingly titled symphonic works may be the product of a composer of an eccentric bent, but they are not without redeeming qualities. He was much taken by descriptive writing, and remains historically important as the first major composer in America to consider the American Indian as a subject worthy of serious compositional effort. - Died at N.Y., May 3, 1861.\n\nin 1787 - Maximilian JLP Gardel, French ballet dancer/choreographer, dies at 45.\n\nin 1792 - Natale Abbadia, Italian composer, is born at Genoa. He composed the opera Giannina di Pontieu (1812), the farce L'lmbroglione ed il castigmatti, masses, and motets. - Died at Milan, Dec. 25, 1861.\n\nin 1807 - Anton Eberl, composer, dies at 41.\n\nin 1812 – William Vincent Wallace, composer is born.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjaRrZgrxys\"]YouTube - William Vincent Wallace - Lurline - Ouverture[/ame]​\n\nin 1819 - Marius Petipa, French ballet dancer/choreographer (Don Quiotte) is born.\n\nin 1824 - Julius (Ferdinand) Bliithner, celebrated German piano maker, is born at Falkenhain, near Merseburg. In 1853 he founded his establishment at Leipzig with 3 workmen, and by 1897 it had grown to a sizable company, producing some 3,000 pianos yearly. Bliithner's specialty was the \"Aliquotflugel,\" a grand piano with a sympathetic octave-string stretched over and parallel with each unison struck by the hammers. He was awarded many medals for his contributions to the advancement of piano construction. He was co-author, with H. Gretschel, of Lehrbuch des Pianofortebaus in seiner Geschichte, Theorie und Technik (Weimar, 1872; 4th ed., 1921). - Died at Leipzig, April 13, 1910.\n\nin 1833 - Fridolin Weber, composer, dies at 71.\n\nin 1827 - Septimus Winner, composer is born.\n\nin 1826 - Gervais-Fracois Couperin, composer, dies at 66.\n\nin 1851 - Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"Rigoletto,\" premieres in Venice.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3zetSuYRg\"]Rigoletto La Dona e mobile - YouTube[/ame]​\n\nin 1867 - Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"Don Carlos,\" premieres in Paris.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiLGstIDhqk\"]Giuseppe Verdi - Don Carlos - \"Au palais des fees\" (Magdalena Kozena) - YouTube[/ame]​\n\nin 1876 - Carl Ruggles, Marion Mass, composer (Evocations) is born.\n\nin 1879 - Justus Hermann Wetzel, composer is born.\n\nin 1891 - Dorothee Manski, German-American soprano and teacher, is born at Berlin. She studied in Berlin, where she made her debut at the Komische Oper (1911); then sang in Mannheim (1914-20) and Stuttgart (1920-24). She was a member of the Berlin State Opera (1924-27); also sang in Max Reinhardt's productions; then appeared as Isolde at the Salzburg Festival (1933) and the Vienna State Opera (1934). She made her Metropolitan Opera debut in N.Y. as the Witch in Hansel und Gretel on Nov. 5,1927, and remained on the company's roster until 1941; also sang opera in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco, and appeared as a concert singer with leading European and U.S. orchs. She was professor of voice at the Ind. University School of Music in Bloomington (1941-65). Among her other roles were Sieglinde, Venus, Gutrune, Briinnhilde, Freia, and Elsa. - Died at Atlanta Ga., Feb. 24, 1967.\n\nin 1897 - Henry (Dixon) Cowell, remarkable and innovative American composer, is born at Menlo Park, Calif\n\nHis father, of Irish birth, was a member of a clergyman's family in Kildare; his mother was an American of progressive persuasion. Cowell studied violin with Henry Holmes in San Francisco; after the earthquake of 1906, his mother took him to N.Y., where they were compelled to seek support from the Society for the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor; they returned to Menlo Park, Calif., where Cowell was able to save enough money, earned from menial jobs, to buy a piano.\n\nHe began to experiment with the keyboard by striking the keys with his fists and forearms; he named such chords \"tone clusters\" and at the age of 13 composed a piece called Adventures in Harmony, in which they appear. Later he began experimenting in altering the sound of the piano by placing various objects on the strings, and also by playing directly under the lid of the piano pizzicato and glissando, thus the later development of the \"prepared piano.\"\n\nHe first exhibited these startling innovations on March 5, 1914, at the San Francisco Musical Society at the St. Francis Hotel, much to the consternation of its members. The tone clusters per se were not new; they were used for special sound effects by composers in the 18th century to imitate thunder or cannon fire. Vladimir Rebikov applied them, for example, in his piano piece Hymn to Inca, and Charles Ives used them in his Concord Sonata to be sounded by covering a set of white or black keys with a wooden board.\n\nHowever, Cowell had a priority by systematizing tone clusters as harmonic amplifications of tonal chords, and he devised a logical notation for them. These tone clusters eventually acquired legitimacy in the works of many European and American composers. Cowell also extended the sonorities of tone clusters to instrumental combinations and applied them in several of his symphonic works.\n\nIn the meantime, Cowell began taking lessons in composition with E.G. Strickland and Wallace Sabin at the University of Calif. at Berkeley, and later with Frank Damrosch at the Institute of Musical Art in N.Y.,and, privately, with Charles Seeger (1914-16). After brief service in the U.S. Army in 1918, where he was employed first as a cook and later as arranger for its Band, he became engaged professionally to give a series of lectures on new music, illustrated by his playing his own works on the piano.\n\nIn 1928 he became the first American composer to visit Russia, where he attracted considerable attention; some of his pieces were published in a Russian edition, the first such publications by an American. Upon his return to the U'S, he was appointed lecturer on music at the New School for Social Research in N.Y.\n\nIn 1931 Cowell received a Guggenheim fellowship, and went to Berlin to study ethnomusicology with Hornbostel. This was the beginning of his serious study of ethnic musical materials. He had already experimented with Indian and Chinese devices in some of his works; in his Ensemble for Strings (1924), he included Indian thundersticks.\n\nIn 1931 he formed a collaboration with Leon Therernin, then visiting the U.S.; with his aid he constructed an ingenious instrument, the Rhythmicon, which made possible the simultaneous production of 16 different rhythms on 16 different pitch levels of the harmonic series. He demonstrated the Rhythmicon at a lecture-concert in San Francisco on May 15, 1932. He also composed an extensive work entitled Rhythmicana for it, but it did not receive a performance until Dec. 3, 1971, at Stanford University, using advanced electronic techniques.\n\nIn 1927 Cowell founded the New Music Quarterly for publication of ultramodern music, mainly by American composers. Cowell's career was brutally interrupted in 1936, when he was arrested in Calif. on charges of homosexuality (then a heinous offense) involving the impairment of the morals of a minor. Lulled by the deceptive promises of a wily district attorney of a brief confinement in a sanatorium, Cowell pleaded guilty to a limited offense; he was vengefully given a maximum sentence of imprisonment, up to 15 years. Incarcerated at San Quentin, he was assigned to work in a jute mill, but indomitably continued to write music.\n\nThanks to interventions on his behalf by a number of eminent musicians, he was paroled in 1940 to Percy Grainger as a guarantor of his good conduct; he obtained a full pardon on Dec. 9, 1942, from the governor of Calif., Earl Warren, after it was discovered that the evidence against him was largely contrived.\n\nOn Sept. 27, 1941, he married Sidney Robertson, a noted ethnomusicologist. He then resumed his full activities as an editor and instructor; he held teaching positions at the New School for Social Research in N.Y. (1940-62), the University of Southern Calif. in Los Angeles, Mills College in Oakland, Calif., and the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore (1951-56); he was also appointed adjunct professor at summer classes at Columbia University (1951-65).\n\nIn 1951 Cowell was elected a member of the National Academy of Arts and Letters; he received an honorary Mus.D. from Wilmington College (1953) and from Monmouth (Ill.) College (1963). In 1956-57 he undertook a world tour with his wife through the Near East, India, and Japan, collecting rich prime materials for his compositions, which by now had acquired a decisive tum toward the use of ethnomusicological melodic and rhythmic materials, without abandoning, however, the experimental devices which were the signposts of most of his works. In addition to his symphonic and chamber music, Cowell published in 1930 an important book, New Musical Resources. He also edited a symposium, American Composers on American Music (Stanford, Calif., 1933). In collaboration with his wife, he wrote a biography of Charles Ives (1955). - Died at Shady, N.Y.,Dec. 10, 1965.\n\nin 1897 - Berthold Tours, composer, dies at 58.\n\nin 1903 - Lawrence (LeRoy) Welk, American orchestra leader and accordionist, is born near Strasburg, N.Dak. When big band music was at its height in the 1930s and 1940s, Welk led a successful territory band in the Midwest. After the Swing Era waned in the late 1940s, Welk prospered, launching a local television show in Los Angeles that joined a national network in the mid-1950s and continued to broadcast into the 1980s, bringing with it substantial recording success.\n\nWelk's light, sweet dance style was appropriately dubbed \"champagne music,\" and his ingratiating manner as a master of ceremonies endeared him to millions of faithful viewers long after his contemporaries had disappeared.\n\nWelk's parents, Ludwig and Christina Schwahn Welk, were natives of Alsace-Lorraine who immigrated to the U.S. in 1892, settling on a farm in North Dakota. Due to the family's European background, their isolation on the farm, and Welk's brief schooling, he did not learn to speak English until he was an adult and always spoke with a German accent. Welk's father played the accordion, and Welk took to the instrument as a child, turning to it more seriously at age 11 while recovering from appendicitis.\n\nWhen he was 17 his father bought him an expensive accordion on the understanding that he would work on the farm for four years while turning over his earnings as a musician to the family; he kept the bargain and left home on his 21st birthday.\n\nWelk formed his first band in the summer of 1925. In 1927 he moved to Yankton, S.Dak., where the four-piece Welk's Novelty Orchestra appeared on local radio station WNAX and began to build a following. By 1930 he had signed with a national booking agency and toured in many parts of the country.\n\nHe married nursing student Fern Renner on April 19, 1931; they had three children. Welk's orchestra remained a moderately successful territory band until 1937, when he began to try to reach a larger audience. He gained residencies at several major hotels, starting with the St. Paul in St. Paul, Minn. At the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, where he opened on New Year's Eve, 1938, and had a national radio hookup, he adopted the band name Lawrence Welk and His Champagne Music to describe his light, danceable sound. He also acquired a theme song, \"Bubbles in the Wine\" (music by Welk, lyrics by Frank Loesser).\n\nWelk had been recording for many years, starting when he paid for his own session with Gennett in the 1920s and cut the single \"Spiked Beer\" /\"Shanghai Honeymoon.\" Now signed to Vocalion, he reached the hit parade for the first time in February 1939 with \"Annabelle,\" returning in April with \"The Moon Is a Silver Dollar\" (music by Sammy Fain, lyrics by Mitchell Parish).\n\nIn 1940, Welk moved his base of operations to Chicago and took up a residency at the Trianon ballroom that lasted ten years. He scored his next Top Ten hit in May 1944 with \"Don't Sweetheart Me\" (music by Cliff Friend, lyrics by Charles Tobias). In 1945he teamed with Red Foley for \"Shame on You\" (music and lyrics by Spade Cooley)/\"At Mail Call Today\" (music and lyrics by Gene Autry and Fred Rose), which topped the country charts in November.\n\nWelk launched his own weekly radio show on the ABC network on June 1, 1949; it ran for two years. Leaving the Trianon in 1950, he toured the West Coast, debuting at the Aragon ballroom in Santa Monica and on a local television station on May 2, 1951. He scored another Top Ten hit with \"Oh, Happy Day\" (music and lyrics by Don Howard Koplow and Nancy Binns Reed) in February 1953.\n\nThe Lawrence Welk Show debuted nationally on the ABC television network on July 2, 1955. Although the Swing Era was a memory and rock 'n' roll was coming to the fore, Welk, with the charm of his heavily accented introductions and pleasant music, became vastly successful. Lawrence Welkand His Sparkling Strings, the first of 42 chart albums, became a Top Ten hit in 1956, and before the year was out Welk had returned to the Top Ten with the LPs Bubbles in the Wine, Say It with Music, and Merry Christmas.\n\nHe also had a second show on ABC, Lawrence Welk's Top Tunes and New Talent for three years starting in October 1956. Welk's records stopped charting after 1957, and he switched record labels, to Dot Records, by 1960, with dramatic results. Last Datereturned him to the Top Ten of the LP charts by early 1961,and \"Calcutta\" (music by Heino Gase) became his biggest hit single ever, topping the charts in February 1961 and going gold, as did the accompanying album, Calcutta! The LP earned a 1961 Grammy nomination for Best Performance by an Orchestra, for Dancing. Welk's four subsequent LPs, Yellow Bird (1961),Moon River, Young World, and Baby Elephant Walk and Theme from The Brothers Grimm (all 1962) also reached the Top Ten, and his albums continued to chart regularly up to 1973, with 1966's Winchester Cathedral also going gold.\n\nAlthough Welk's program was never among the most popular on television (it was rated among the top 25 shows only during the years 1965-68, never ranking higher than 12th), it attracted a steady audience, and when ABC canceled the show after 16 years in 1971, it did so more because of demographics than because of any fall-off in viewership.\n\nWelk was able to continue on television by organizing his own syndicated network; in fact, the show ran on more stations than before, and it went on another 11 years, finally concluding in 1982, although reruns still appear. Welk retired from performing after a concert in San Francisco in June 1982. He maintained his business interests, including the Welk Group of record labels, which acquired the classical/folk label Vanguard in 1986. Welk died of pneumonia at the age of 89 in 1992. - Died at Santa Monica, Calif., May 17, 1992.\n\nin 1906 - Hasan Ferid Alnar, Turkish conductor, teacher, and composer, is born at Constantinople. He received training in traditional Turkish music, and then studied harmony with Hiiseyin Sadettin Arel and counterpoint with Edgar Manas. He completed his studies in Vienna with J.

Brazilian-US soprano, born in Rio de Janeiro and was a leading artist of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1937 to 1952. At the age of 18, she made her major opera debut in Rio and her performance led to an opportunity to study with Elena Teodorini. She went on to perform in many major opera houses around the world. After fifteen years with the Metropolitan Opera, she gave her last performance in 1952, choosing to retire from opera while still at the top of her form. For the next two years she was a guest performer throughout the U.S., but in 1957 she decided to retire completely from public performance; two years after that she made her final recording as the soprano soloist on Villa-Lobos's world premiere stereo recording of his cantata Forest of the Amazon with the composer conducting the Symphony of the Air.\n\nin 1999 - Yehudi Menuhin, Baron Menuhin, OM, KBE dies at age 82. Yehudi Menuhin was a Russian Jewish American violinist and conductor who spent most of his performing career in the United Kingdom. He was born to Russian Jewish parents in the United States, but became a citizen of Switzerland in 1970, and of the United Kingdom in 1985. He is often considered to be one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century.\n\nYehudi Menuhin was born in New York City, United States, to Bielorussian Jewish parents from what is now Belarus. His sisters were the concert pianist and human rights worker Hephzibah Menuhin and the pianist, painter, and poet Yaltah Menuhin. Through his father Moshe Menuhin, a former rabbinical student and anti-Zionist writer, Menuhin was descended from a distinguished rabbinical dynasty.\n\nMenuhin began violin instruction at age four under violinist Sigmund Anker; his parents had wanted Louis Persinger to be his teacher, but Persinger refused. Menuhin displayed extraordinary talents at an early age. His first solo violin performance was at the age of seven with the San Francisco Symphony in 1923. Persinger then agreed to take Menuhin as a student. When the Menuhins went to Paris, Persinger suggested Yehudi go to his own teacher, Eugène Ysaÿe. He did have one lesson with Ysaÿe, but did not like his method or the fact that he was very old. Instead, he went to the Romanian composer and violinist George Enescu, after which he made several recordings with his sister Hephzibah. He was also a student of Adolf Busch. In 1929 he played in Berlin, under Bruno Walter's baton, three concerti by Bach, Brahms and Beethoven. In 1932 he recorded Edward Elgar's Violin Concerto in B minor for HMV in London, with the composer himself conducting, and between 1934 and 1936 he made the first integral recording of Johann Sebastian Bach's Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin.\n\nYehudi Menuhin performed for Allied soldiers during World War II, and accompanied English composer Benjamin Britten to perform for inmates of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, after its liberation in April 1945. He returned to Germany in 1947 to perform with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler as an act of reconciliation, becoming the first Jewish musician to do so following the Holocaust. He said to critics within the Jewish community that he wanted to rehabilitate Germany's music and spirit. After building early success on richly romantic and tonally opulent performances, he experienced considerable physical and artistic difficulties caused by overwork during the war as well as unfocused and unstructured early training (reportedly he said \"I watched myself on film and realized that for 30 years I'd been holding the bow wrong\"). Careful practice and study combined with meditation and yoga helped him overcome many of these problems. His profound and considered musical interpretations are nearly universally acclaimed. When he finally resumed recording, he was known for practicing by deconstructing music phrases one note at a time.\n\nMenuhin continued to perform to an advanced age, becoming known for profound interpretations of an austere quality, as well as for his explorations of music outside the classical realm.\n\nMenuhin credited German-Jewish philosopher Constantin Brunner with providing him with \"a theoretical framework within which I could fit the events and experiences of life\".\n\nIn 1952 Menuhin met and befriended the influential yogi B. K. S. Iyengar before he had come to prominence outside India. Menuhin arranged for Iyengar to teach abroad in London, Switzerland, Paris and elsewhere. This was the first time that many Westerners had been exposed to yoga.\n\nFollowing his role as a member of the awards jury at the 1955 Queen Elisabeth Music Competition, Menuhin secured a Rockefeller Foundation grant for the financially-strapped Grand Prize winner at the event, Argentine violinist Alberto Lysy. Menuhin made Lysy his first and only personal student, and the two toured extensively throughout the concert halls of Europe. The young protégé later established the International Menuhin Music Academy in Gstaad, in his honor.\n\nMenuhin made several recordings with the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, who had been criticized for conducting in Germany during the Nazi era. Menuhin defended Furtwängler, noting that the conductor had helped a number of Jewish musicians to flee Nazi Germany.\n\nIn 1962, he established the Yehudi Menuhin School in Stoke d'Abernon, Surrey. He also established the music program at The Nueva School in Hillsborough, California, sometime around then. In 1965 he received an honorary knighthood from the British monarchy. In the same year, Australian composer Malcolm Williamson wrote a violin concerto for Menuhin. He performed the concerto many times and recorded it at its premiere at the Bath Festival in 1965. Originally known as the Bath Assembly, the festival was first directed by the impresario Ian Hunter in 1948. After the first year the city tried to run the festival itself, but in 1955 asked Hunter back. In 1959 Hunter invited Yehudi Menuhin to become artistic director of the Festival. Menuhin accepted, and retained the post until 1968.\n\nMenuhin also had a long association with Ravi Shankar, which began with their 1966 album West Meets East. During this time, he commissioned composer Alan Hovhaness to write a concerto for violin, sitar, and orchestra to be performed by himself and Shankar. The resulting work, entitled Shambala (c. 1970), with a fully composed violin part and space for improvisation from the sitarist, is the earliest known work for sitar with western symphony orchestra, predating Shankar's own sitar concertos, but Menuhin and Shankar never recorded it. Menuhin also worked with famous jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli in the 1970s on Jalousie, an album of pop music of the 1930s arranged in chamber style.\n\nAt the Edinburgh Festival in 1957 Menuhin premiered Priaulx Rainier's violin concerto Due Canti e Finale, which he had commissioned Rainier to write. He also commissioned her last work, Wildlife Celebration, which he performed in aid of Gerald Durrell's Wildlife Conservation Trust.\n\nIn 1983 Menuhin and Robert Masters founded the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists. Now one of the world's leading competitions for young violinists, many of its prizewinners have gone on to become prominent violinists, including Tasmin Little, Nikolaj Znaider, Ilya Gringolts, Julia Fischer, Daishin Kashimoto and Lara St. John.\n\nIn 1991 Menuhin was awarded the prestigious Wolf Prize by the Israeli Government. In the Israeli Knesset he gave an acceptance speech in which he criticised Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank:\n\n\"This wasteful governing by fear, by contempt for the basic dignities of life, this steady asphyxiation of a dependent people, should be the very last means to be adopted by those who themselves know too well the awful significance, the unforgettable suffering of such an existence. It is unworthy of my great people, the Jews, who have striven to abide by a code of moral rectitude for some 5,000 years, who can create and achieve a society for themselves such as we see around us but can yet deny the sharing of its great qualities and benefits to those dwelling amongst them.\"\n\nIn 1997 Menuhin and Ian Stoutzker founded the charity Live Music Now, the largest outreach music project in the UK. Live Music Now pays and trains professional musicians to work in the community, bringing the experience to those who rarely get an opportunity to hear or see live music performance.\n\nMenuhin's pupils included Nigel Kennedy, Nicola Benedetti, and the violists Paul Coletti and Csaba Erdélyi. He owned and played several notable instruments; arguably the most famous of which is the Lord Wilton Guarneri del Gesù (1742).\n\nIn the 1980s Menuhin wrote and oversaw the creation of a \"Music Guides\" series of books; each covered a musical instrument, with one on the human voice.\n\nMenuhin regularly returned to the San Francisco Bay Area, sometimes performing with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. One of the more memorable later performances was of Edward Elgar's Violin Concerto, which Menuhin had recorded with the composer in 1932.\n\nOn 22 April 1978, along with Stéphane Grappelli, Yehudi played Pick Yourself Up, taken from the Menuhin & Grappelli Play Berlin, Kern, Porter and Rodgers & Hart album as the interval act at the 23rd Eurovision Song Contest for TF1. The performance came direct from the studios of TF1 and not that of the venue (Palais des Congrès), where the contest was being held.\n\nDuring the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Menuhin made jazz recordings with Stéphane Grappelli, classical recordings with L. Subramaniam and albums of Eastern music with the great sitarist Ravi Shankar. In 1983 he founded the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists in Folkestone, Kent.\n\nHis recording contract with EMI lasted almost 70 years and is the longest in the history of the music industry. He made his first recording at age 13 in November 1929, and his last in 1999, when he was nearly 83 years old. He recorded over 300 works for EMI, both as a violinist and as a conductor. In 2009 EMI released a 51-CD retrospective of Menuhin's recording career, titled Yehudi Menuhin: The Great EMI Recordings.\n\nIn 1990 Menuhin was the first conductor for the Asian Youth Orchestra which toured around Asia, including Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong with Julian Lloyd Webber and a group of young talented musicians from all over Asia.\n\nYehudi Menuhin was married twice. He married Nola Nicholas, daughter of an Australian industrialist, and sister of Hephzibah Menuhin's first husband Lindsay Nicholas. They had two children, Krov and Zamira (who married pianist Fou Ts'ong). Following their 1947 divorce he married the British ballerina and actress Diana Gould, whose mother was the pianist Evelyn Suart (who had played with artists such as Eugène Ysaÿe and Karel Halíř), and whose stepfather was Admiral Sir Cecil Harcourt. Menuhin and Gould had two sons, Gerard and Jeremy, a pianist. A third child died shortly after birth.\n\nThe name Yehudi means 'Jew' in Hebrew. In an interview republished in October 2004, he recounted to New Internationalist magazine the story of his name:\n\nObliged to find an apartment of their own, my parents searched the neighbourhood and chose one within walking distance of the park. Showing them out after they had viewed it, the landlady said: \"And you'll be glad to know I don't take Jews.\" Her mistake made clear to her, the antisemitic landlady was renounced, and another apartment found. But her blunder left its mark. Back on the street my mother made a vow. Her unborn baby would have a label proclaiming his race to the world. He would be called \"The Jew.\"\n\nMenuhin died in Martin Luther Hospital, Berlin, Germany, from complications of bronchitis.\n\nSoon after his death, the Royal Academy of Music acquired the Yehudi Menuhin Archive, one of the most comprehensive collections ever assembled by an individual musician.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaBoqhzF_QI\"]Yehudi Menuhin plays Mendelssohn violin concerto - YouTube[/ame]\n\n12 MARCH\n\n​\n\npage 1 of 2\n\n12 MARCH\n\npage 2 of 2\n\nin 2000 - Andy Lewis dies at age 33.

American bass player and sessionist; childhood friend of Michael Nesmith's from Texas, who had played with him in several working bands, he accompanied Nesmith and then-wife Phyllis Barbour to California, to try their luck in the Los Angeles-area music scene. When Nesmith was cast in The Monkees, John was his stand-in on the set, and in the studios when the originally-fictitious band began playing on their own recordings, it is John's bass lines we hear. In late 1969, he and Nesmith, left the Monkees, to form a new group with pedal steel guitar ace Red Rhodes and drummer John Ware. Calling themselves the First National Band, the group signed with RCA Records. Years after the Monkees and the First National Band, John served as key grip on several different productions, including 48 Hrs., Who Will Love My Children?, The Karate Kid, Long Time Gone, and Hudson Hawk.

In fact, the opera almost seems to represent a transition from the classicist works of Paisiello, Haydn and Mozart to the romantic music of Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini. However, the opera, a moderate success was quickly forgotten in France, only to be properly reevaluated in recent times.\n\nAmong its' unusual features, the secondary role of Neris, Medea's servant and friend, stands out: the part could have been another one in a long of background confidante characters but Cherubini blesses his singer with one of the most profound mezzo-soprano arias, graced by a perfect combination of understated string lines, a bassoon obbligato (a stroke of genius, if there ever was one) and a mournful vocal melody, as Neris sympathizes with her mistress' plight. Teresa Berganza who had sung the part in one of the productions with Callas in the title role is, as in the recital in general, vocally breathtaking and dramatically responsive, wonderfully enlivening the slightly cold Italian text.\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC9S940-4es\"]YouTube - Luigi Cherubini - Medea (1797) - Aria for Neris - \"Solo un pianto\" (Teresa Berganza)[/ame] ​\n\nin 1817 - Matej Sojka, composer, dies at 77.\n\nin 1832 - Alberto Randegger, composer is born.\n\nin 1839 - Robert Gallenberg, composer, dies at 55.\n\nin 1850 - Emilio Serrano y Ruiz, composer is born.\n\nin 1860 - Hugo Filipp Jakob Wolf, Windisch-Gr\"z Austria, composer is born.\n\nin 1862 - Vasily Mikhaylovich Metallov, composer is born.\n\nin 1883 - Enrico Toselli, composer is born.\n\nin 1887 - Carlos Isamitt, composer is born.\n\nin 1890 - Fritz Busch, eminent German conductor, brother of Adolf (Georg Wilhelm) and Hennann Busch, is born at Siegen, Westphalia.
