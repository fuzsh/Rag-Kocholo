        "text": "12/24/17\n\nScripture: Luke 2:1-20 Christmas Eve 11pm\n\nSermon: Playing Favorites\n\nThat’s not what Linus said they said.\n\nIn A Charlie Brown Christmas, when Linus took center stage and told the Christmas story, he got to the part about the angels and he said:\n\nAnd suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\n\nBut this year when I pulled out Luke 2 and read it, my eyes hit verse 14 like a speed bump and I sat back in my chair.\n\nGlory to God in the highest heaven,\n\nand on earth peace among those whom he favors!\n\nGranted, I was reading a different translation of the Bible then Linus, but good will toward men and peace among those whom he favors? That’s way different.\n\nDoes God play favorites? That’s troubling.\n\nWhen is favoritism ever a good thing? Certainly not in the family. We all know this. Who doesn’t have a story from childhood or adolescence when they were convinced their parents favored one sibling over another – nobody!\n\nWe all have them.\n\nNo parent intends it. We’ll go to great lengths to avoid any perception of it – like making sure each child has the same number of presents to open on Christmas morning – even if it means wrapping batteries separately…\n\nYet invariably first born children have more video footage, more candid photos… more Baby’s First Ornaments on the Christmas tree… and later born children – like me, growing up with 9 years between me and my next oldest sibling – we have it easier with relaxed rules and enlightened attitudes.\n\nLove each child equally yet differently, the wise adage goes. Each one is unique and has individual needs. Love them all fully and meet them where they distinctively are –but everybody knows: don’t play favorites.\n\nFavoritism kills office morale. As a manager of a sales organization – I knew full well the importance of setting fair territories and passing leads equitably – and how easy it is to perceive otherwise.\n\nBosses who surround themselves with an inner circle of yes people may think they’re ensuring job security but instead, they foster discontent, distrust and disloyalty. Their companies suffer from unrealized potential and personal and professional growth is stunted.\n\nReward achievement. Incent collaboration and creativity. Give everybody a chance to be successful and contribute. And whatever you do, don’t play favorites.\n\nFrom the playground to the lunch room… from wedding reception seating charts to casting characters in a play… in boardrooms and courtrooms and classrooms and family rooms – in every aspect of life – we know the temptation and toxicity of favoritism. Even in the church.\n\nWe all have stories we can tell of the heartache and heartbreak of being left out, looked over, and passed by.\n\nBut God? Playing favorites?\n\nI rolled my eyes when I first saw the bumper sticker: Jesus loves you, but I’m his favorite. You can actually get that on a tshirt, hoodie, keychain, plaque – even a coffee mug – it’s ridiculous! It’s a joke, right? Or at least I thought it was until I read Luke 2:14:\n\nGlory to God in the highest heaven,\n\nand on earth peace among those whom he favors!\n\nIf God’s favor is a thing and it appears it is, what does it mean? And what doesn’t it mean?\n\nFirst what it doesn’t mean. God’s favor is not about partiality.\n\nGod is not partial to one kind of people over another on the basis of economics or status or privilege.\n\nThe Bible is littered with verses and parables and stories that describe God as a God of justice, condemning those who would flaunt positions of power and wealth to gain access, reward or privilege. One example comes from the book of James:\n\nMy brothers and sisters, do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ? For if a person with gold rings and in fine clothes comes into your assembly, and if a poor person in dirty clothes also comes in, and if you take notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say: “Have a seat here, please,” while to the one who is poor you say, “Stand there,” or, “Sit at my feet,” have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?\n\nRenowned preacher Tom Long tells a story of a colleague of his who once put that scripture to the test in her church:\n\nShe was a well-respected leader in her congregation. One Sunday she chose to appear at church in the guise of a homeless person. She was by no means a “minks and gold rings” kind of woman, Tom said, but it nevertheless took a great deal of effort, theatrical makeup and thrift-store clothing to transform her into a person whose appearance showed the ravages of the streets.\n\nHer experience at church was remarkable, transforming. Church friends who would normally have greeted her cheerily in the hallway turned their heads and would not make eye contact.\n\nWhen she was not being ignored, she was glared at, and, as she made her way toward the worship space, she could sense the ushers tensing for a possible confrontation.\n\nThey seated her as far away from others as possible.\n\nThere was an anxious moment when she stood up to speak during the joys and concerns. It was then that she revealed who she was. They were astonished, then embarrassed, and the coffee hour after church was filled with apologies.\n\nLook again at the characters in the Christmas story: a young, poor teenage mom, making do with an animal feeding trough for her newborn… shepherds who literally live in caves in the fields alongside their sheep — the first witnesses… if God’s showing any partiality in this story, it’s the reverse – those with the lowest social status get front row seats.\n\nGod’s favor is not about partiality and God’s favor also cannot be earned.\n\nWhenever there’s favoritism, there’s also jealousy and competition – people who perceive themselves as less than, clamoring to become more than or better than – to win the favor of the parent or the teacher or the boss. Think of all the destructive behavior that comes from this: tattling and slandering, backstabbing and stealing credit for someone else’s work. Unlike human favor, God’s favor is not merit-based. It’s freely given grace.\n\nJesus illustrates this with a story about a son who takes his part of the family inheritance and goes to a distant country where he blows it all on wasteful living. He returns in shame, ready to offer to work it off as a hired hand for his father. Instead, his father throws open his arms and welcomes his son home by throwing him a big party.\n\nHe sets no conditions, no list of tasks… puts no plan in place for his son to earn back his love. The father’s love, like God’s love was and is free.\n\nThe son’s older brother saw this as exceedingly unfair. He’d worked his whole life to do the right and responsible thing – to earn his father’s favor. If anyone deserved a party, it should be him, but he’d never had a party thrown for him. Yet now, he was expected to celebrate? No.\n\nAll that I have is yours, the father said – to both sons. All that I have is yours and yours and yours and yours and his and hers and ours and theirs. God’s favor is impartial and unmerited – sounds very unlike any human system of favor.\n\nGlory to God in the highest heaven\n\nand on earth peace among those whom he favors!\n\nWhat if the angel’s proclamation is really about a peace that comes when we stop playing favorites altogether… stop ordering and directing our hearts and lives according to human systems of greed and power and privilege and status… and choose instead to play in the free and abundant life of God’s steadfast and limitless favor?\n\nWhat if the angel’s declaration is really a revelation — a call to a new humanity, born in Jesus that embodies abundant love and grace intended for all?\n\nIf ever there was a symbol of that kind of inclusive peace, it would be the nativity – where kings and shepherds take a knee side by side surrounded by animals and angels – a radical peaceable kingdom – a scene of a world in its entire– together worshipping love made flesh.\n\nHe was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him.\n\nBut to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.\n\nAnd the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth.\n\n12/17/17 — Christmas Cantata\n\n12/10/17\n\nScripture: Ezekiel 37:1-14\n\nSermon: Hope in the Valley\n\nThe hand of the Lord came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of a valley;\n\nIt was about 7am when the phone rang. A woman, a member of the church, a little younger than me was sobbing. She woke up that morning to find her husband dead at the bottom of the basement stairs. She never heard him cry out and she never heard him fall. It was a massive heart attack.\n\nI threw on clothes, jumped in the car and drove to her house, where I sat with her all morning. The youth director came and took her 12 year old daughter to breakfast – just to get her out of the house. Her mom didn’t want her to remember her dad that way.\n\nWe sat together in the middle of that valley – hugging and crying and praying and silent. The funeral home came and she made coffee and they carried her husband away and she turned to me and said: Will I be ok? And I said yes. Not today. But yes.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nThe hand of the Lord came upon me, and he brought me out by the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of a valley;\n\nMy next-door neighbor’s young son was in ICU — had been for several days. Medicine was keeping him deeply sedated while his brain healed from a stroke. The hospital called her. Something was going wrong. Her husband was away. Will you drive with me to the hospital? He may not make it through the night and I’m scared, she said.\n\nAnd I threw on my coat and got in the car with her and we drove. Teams were working on him when we arrived and we went to the chapel. We knelt together, gripping each other’s hands and prayed and cried and prayed and cried and prayed. In that deepest, darkest valley, we pleaded with God for his life. Will he be ok? she asked me. And we held each other in silent prayer.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nWe all have stories like this to tell… of the phone call or the text: there’s been an accident… it’s cancer… I’ve been arrested… I’m losing my job… he’s cheating on me… my wife’s tried to take her own life… can you come? will you come? And it’s like we’re picked up and carried to the valley … plunked down into the waiting rooms of life. Will I, will she, will he, will we be ok? Is there hope in the valley?\n\nWe go with the hand of the LORD upon us… sent out by the spirit of the LORD… to embody hope – like Ezekiel, whose name means “God strengthens”, we go in strength to strengthen by God’s grace and breath.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nEzekiel first started preaching about seven years before Judah fell to the Babylonians. For seven long years, he warned of their coming destruction. A captive himself, he had a front row seat for the pain and suffering of his people. Even after he was deported to Babylon, he kept on preaching – doom, punishment, consequence, judgment – exhausting stuff – truth telling nobody wanted to hear and he probably didn’t want to preach. And after Jerusalem fell, all was lost: the Temple, home, the glory of the past—all gone.\n\nAnd the hand of the Lord came upon him, and brought him out by the spirit of the Lord and set him down in the middle of a valley. There he was surrounded by piles and piles of bones. Very dry bones.\n\nImagine a battle scene, where the dead are left with no one to tend them – left to decay — utter and total defeat. the worst possible scenario. the darkest valley. Hell on earth.\n\nCan these bones live? The LORD God asked Ezekiel. The silence was deafening… lifeless… hopeless… everywhere despair.\n\nWe have come to the lowest and darkest point of the biblical story – deep in the heart of exile. The LORD God said: Mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely.’\n\nThere in that valley are God and the human being named “God strengthens” – together sharing the knowledge of the past with its broken promises and betrayals, and facing the wretched truth of the present.\n\nAnd God asks Ezekiel: Can these bones live? Will you (all) be ok? Isn’t that funny? That God is asking? I think about this poor ghost of a man Ezekiel who has endured such incredible frustration and devastation – now forced to look at it – wasteland stretching as far as his eye can see. Maybe he laughs out loud at God’s question – a big belly laugh at the ridiculousness of it – his whole exhausted frame shaking with hysteria until he begins to weep and fall to his knees sobbing.\n\nCan these bones live? Only you know.\n\nYou tell them this, the Spirit of God breathes hope in the valley.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nIt’s been a hard year for a lot of people… a very painful year for many within our congregation and community. A woman called me a couple of days ago and she listed all of the awful things she and her family endured this year. It sounded like Job from the Bible – one of her family members died unexpectedly, then another received a life threatening diagnosis, another lost a job, another went through a divorce, then she had a host of health issues…\n\nThroughout her story, as I was listening, I’d say things like: How awful for them… or… I’m so sorry… and then she’d say – No – wait– there’s even more… Hers is a familiar story.\n\nAnd God asks: Can these bones live? You tell them this: the Spirit of God breathes hope in the valley.\n\nIt’s been a hard year for our nation with shootings and natural disasters and a difficult and painful political transition. The national news has been relentless – each day seemingly worse than the day before – hammering away at faith and the belief that love wins… casting doubt that all really will be made well… that light really is stronger than darkness and the way, the truth and the life of Jesus is God’s dream – at work, even now… will justice ever prevail and peace ever come?\n\nAnd God asks: Can these bones live? You tell them this: the Spirit of God breathes hope in the valley.\n\nI need to hear that. I need to hear that over and over again, breathed into my heart to build up my hope and my faith – to bring me to my feet again – don’t you?\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nLast week we saw the Disney Pixar movie Coco. It’s about the Mexican holiday of Dia de los Muertos, a time when families remember their loved ones who have died. When 12-year old Miguel finds himself in the land of the dead, he learns that the memories of living relatives keep the dead animated. When they are no longer remembered by anyone, they experience a final death, fading away permanently.\n\nWhat reanimates the people of God in the valley of dry bones – in any valley– is also memory – God’s memory of the covenant.\n\nA new heart I will give you, says the LORD, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will put my spirit within you… then you shall live.\n\nThe season of Advent is a gift for exiles. It comes with language of waiting and longing and hoping… songs sung and prayers lifted by and for people of God living through hard times of transition — as strangers in a foreign land. Advent holds within it a knowledge of the past, a truth telling of the unsettledness of the present and a sure and certain promise for the future: light in the dark, peace in the storm, hope in the valley.\n\nOver and over again we are picked up and carried into the valley, to be with another: will I, will he, will she, will they, will we be ok? Hope begins and ends with God: God’s memory, God’s faithfulness, God’s breath of life, God’s restoration.\n\nYou tell them this: the Spirit of God breathes hope in the valley, that they may live.\n\n12/3/17\n\nScripture: Daniel 3\n\nSermon: Conviction\n\nIn his blessing written For an Exile, John O’Donohue writes:\n\nWhen you dream, it is always home.\n\nYou are there among your own,\n\nThe rhythm of their voices rising like song\n\nYour blood would sing through any dark.\n\nThen you awake to find yourself listening\n\nTo the sounds of the traffic in another land.\n\nFor a moment your whole body recoils\n\nAt the strange emptiness of where you are.\n\nThis country is cold to your voice.\n\nIt is still a place without echoes.\n\nNothing of yours has happened here.\n\nNo one knows you,\n\nThe language slows you,\n\nThe thick accent smothers your presence.\n\nYou sound foreign to yourself;\n\nTheir eyes reflect how strange you seem\n\nWhen seen across a cold distance…\n\nThis wasn’t their land. The locals didn’t speak their language and didn’t eat the kind of food they ate. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego weren’t even their real names.\n\nBack home in Judah, they were from the ruling class: the brightest, strongest, smartest – best of the best. After they arrived as prisoners in Babylon, they were shuttled to the palace and enrolled in an intense 3 year program of cultural assimilation.\n\nThey did well, graduating at the top of their class – ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in the whole kingdom. They landed great jobs in the government.\n\nBut though their names were changed to reflect Babylonian gods, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah never forgot who and whose they were.\n\nAlthough their story is set in the 6th century BC, most commentators believe it was written in the 2nd century BC during the reign of Antiochus IV. Antiochus was Greek and he demanded the people of his empire be Greek: culturally and religiously. His army enforced his decree that all worship Zeus. For the first time in recorded history, thousands and thousands of Jews were slaughtered specifically because they stood in the conviction of their faith and refused to bow. Antiochus added Epiphanes to his name meaning Illustrious One.\n\nThose he persecuted called him by another name: Epimanes meaning Mad One.\n\nIn the midst of such darkness and struggle, arose a story of courage and steadfast hope… a story of deliverance… of faithful and convicted heroes in exile… a story of a triumphant power greater than the awful tyrannical power of their day… reminding them to hold fast, stand firm… God was with them – even in the fiery furnace.\n\nO Nebuchadnezzar, O Antiochus Epiphanes (or Epimanes), O <insert the name of any stubborn and demanding oppressive leader> we have no need to present a defense to you in this matter. This matter – the matter of our ultimate heart allegiance – the matter of our worship.\n\nFreedom to worship God is the central theme of the whole biblical story. From the repeated refrain of the Exodus story: Let my people go so they may worship me! to the prophets speaking to the captives in exile, to Jesus who drives the money changers out of the Temple, condemning them for the burdens they place on people who come to worship… and again to Jesus who specifically chooses the Sabbath day to heal people, setting them free to worship — the whole story beats with the rhythm of freedom to worship.\n\nWhen Jozef Hehanussa was with us, he and I talked about religious freedom. He’s a Christian pastor living in Indonesia, where 87% of the population is Muslim. But Indonesia is not a Muslim nation, any more than the United States is a Christian nation – despite our 70% majority status. Thankfully, both of us live in democracies where religious freedom is a legally protected right.\n\nBut sometimes in Indonesia, Jozef said, fundamentalist Muslim clerics will introduce legislation that would privilege Muslims over people of other faiths. They might even call it a “Religious Rights” bill, despite the fact that it’s a thinly veiled attempt to reduce the religious freedoms of minorities. Because it favors the majority religion, it sounds good to lots of people.\n\nJozef and his fellow Christian leaders are well-versed in reading between the lines. But they need fair-minded and prudent Islamic leaders too, people of influential voice — to be freedom defenders– to take a stand out of their majority position and their democratic conviction that all may continue to be free.\n\n+++++++++++++\n\nLet’s turn this morning’s story slant and enter it from a different perspective. I invite you to stand in the crowd as one of the Babylonians. Survey the landscape of the plain of Dura. What do you see? Everybody’s doing what they’re supposed to be doing but those three guys who don’t look like us or talk like us … but we know this much about them — they’ve got important positions in our government.\n\nWe don’t know anything about their families or the land they come from. We don’t know they used to have different names or that those names meant something special to them. We don’t know that they were once royalty in their land.\n\nWe just know they got jobs that could have been ours and now they’re refusing to follow the law of our land.\n\nHow much does that offend us?\n\nDo we wonder why or ask them why they do what they do?\n\nCan we ignore them or does it bug us until we tell somebody they’re not doing what they’re supposed to do?\n\nDo we worry that if somebody doesn’t make them do it, everybody might stop doing it – and then what would be the purpose of having laws?\n\nDo we consider that if they get in trouble, they might get fired and if they get fired, we, or at least somebody more like us might get their jobs?\n\nDoes what they’re doing – or not doing — bother us so much that we can’t concentrate anymore on what we were doing before we saw them not doing what they’re supposed to be doing?\n\nDo we look around at other people in the crowd to see if we can tell what they’re thinking about this?\n\nDo we wonder why more people don’t seem as upset as we are?\n\nAnd does that make us wonder what this world is coming to that people can do whatever they want and not be held accountable?\n\nAt any point, do we question our law?\n\n++++++++++++++\n\nTurn the story again and enter it as Nebuchadnezzar:\n\nHow excited are you to roll out this giant gold obelisk?\n\nWhat a great idea it was to have this celebration and to decree that when the band starts playing everybody all together bows – with one heart and mind – everybody on the same page.\n\nDid it ever occur to you that anyone wouldn’t be on board?\n\nYou see the three of them before anyone says anything and you realize they’re on your staff.\n\nThey’re the smart and super productive guys from Judah– a great addition to the team.\n\nHopefully no one will notice they’re not bowing – nobody would notice if they all just focused on what they were doing, but of course they don’t, so of course they do – notice – and now they’ve made a big deal about it and as everyone looks on, you have to do something.\n\nDoes it occur to you to stand up for the three of them – knowing what you know about them?\n\nUnder what circumstances could you have? would you have?\n\nAre you personally offended?\n\nIs your anger a show… a cover for your embarrassment or a sign of your fierce and determined leadership…\n\nDo you feel betrayed?\n\nCould it have killed them to just bow – what is the big deal – everybody else is doing it?\n\nDoes it feel like they’re making you look like a fool?\n\nWhat does your anger feel like inside?\n\nIs there any part in you that appreciates their conviction that even after they’re called out, they still don’t bow?\n\nCould you ever let people know there’s something really impressive about that? What might happen if you did?\n\nCould you ever risk rethinking this whole thing?\n\nAnd at the end of it all, how does it feel to see them standing in the fire – unburned?\n\n++++++++++++++++\n\nThis is a fascinating story for any time. A story of conviction and of hospitality… of honor and of shame… of idolatry, hubris, xenophobia, conversion and deliverance…\n\nIsn’t it really a parable? A cautionary tale? An invitation to enter it and to see ourselves and our humanity or lack thereof in it and to consider for a moment what it is to be an exile… And what it is to be among exiles…\n\nWho are the exiles among us?\n\nStrangers, foreigners, people living through loss or those new to this place – maybe new to this town from another land or visitors to our church – maybe coming from a different Christian tradition where they raise their hands when they sing or they sing with a band or they don’t sing at all…\n\nMaybe the experience of church itself is a land of exile for some because they’ve never felt welcome or not for a long time but for some reason, here they are and they don’t know what to do…\n\nMaybe in their last town or their last job or their last church they were important people – everybody knew them – they were a part of something — and now nothing’s familiar…\n\nmaybe I sound like I’m describing you, that exile might describe you and you’re wondering when you might feel like you belong somewhere… anywhere…again or for the first time…\n\nWhat would it take to turn a stranger into a friend? Or to at least reduce the awkwardness with welcome…\n\nJohn O’Donohue’s blessing For an Exile concludes with these words:\n\nNow is the time to hold faithful\n\nTo your dream, to understand\n\nThat this is an interim time\n\nFull of awkward disconnection.\n\nGradually you will come to find\n\nYour way to friends who will open\n\nDoors into a new belonging.\n\nYour heart will brighten\n\nWith new discovery,\n\nYour presence will unclench\n\nAnd find ease,\n\nLetting your substance\n\nAnd promise be seen.\n\nSlowly a new world will open for you.\n\nThe eyes of your heart, refined\n\nBy this desert time, will be free\n\nTo see and celebrate the new life\n\nFor which you sacrificed everything.\n\nLet this story leave us with renewed conviction:\n\nTo give the allegiance of our hearts to One and One only.\n\nTo defend freedom for others to do the same.\n\nTo extend grace to the exiles in our midst and together create new home.\n\nTo carry with us the image of the holy one standing with us even in the fire and\n\nTo risk rethinking our most stubbornly-held convictions – unless they contradict the first one.\n\n11/26/17\n\nScripture: Jeremiah 29:1,4-14\n\nSermon: Settle Down\n\nIt’s been almost 150 years since the fall of the Northern Kingdom to the Assyrian empire. Sadly, after the wide-sweeping reforms of King Hezekiah in the Southern Kingdom of Judah, things went bad again. Hezekiah’s son Manasseh rebuilt all the altars to foreign gods his father had destroyed and the people turned away from God. Now it’s 597 BC and the Babylonian Empire is on the rise, led by King Nebuchadnezzar. His armies have sacked Jerusalem and taken many of its people as captives into Babylon.\n\nDon’t unpack your bags, many of the prophets proclaim, God will yet deliver us! We’re going home soon!\n\nOne lone prophet begs to disagree. Jeremiah knows the truth, and speaks it through tears.\n\nDon’t listen to them… Our time is up. God will be faithful again, but only after we’ve had a good long time to think about our disobedience. Settle down. Dig in. Commit to your surroundings. Babylon is your new home.\n\nA reading from Jeremiah 29, beginning with verse 1:\n\nThis is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:\n\n4 This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: 5 “Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. 6 Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease. 7 Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.” 8 Yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. 9 They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,” declares the Lord.\n\n10 This is what the Lord says: “When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place.11 For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. 12 Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 13 You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. 14 I will be found by you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back from captivity.[a] I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.”\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nMaya Angelou said, If you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude about it.\n\nJudah’s captivity was a given. Unchangeable. The sooner the people realized it, stopped fighting it, or even enduring it and invested in it, the better it would be – for everyone.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nMary learned that lesson. She went kicking and screaming into her exile, as her children banded together and insisted their parents sell their home and move into a senior living facility. Mary’s husband had Alzheimer’s and Mary wanted to continue to care for him independently.\n\nReluctantly, she agreed to move, but she was angry and resentful. She wasn’t ready to give up their lives and their friends. She hated every minute in the new place.\n\nFor several months, she refused to engage in activities and complained: nobody cared for her husband the way she would. Her relationship with her children suffered. She wasn’t sleeping well, wasn’t eating well and had no friends.\n\nOne morning after a particularly contentious visit with her children, she looked in the mirror and made a decision. I didn’t want to be angry anymore, and I was tired of fighting with my children, she told me. It was time for me to settle down and live my life here. She picked up the activity calendar and began to invest in the community around her.\n\nFor several years, Mary attended book clubs and went on field trips. She made friends with other women who had husbands in memory care. These relationships sustained her through the loss of her husband.\n\nWhen Mary died, her memorial was held at her community’s chapel. She was remembered well by a packed house. She had indeed settled down and made that place her home.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nSome of the most productive citizens in this country are the ones serving life sentences in prison, once they’ve learned to settle down and invest in their new place. But that decision doesn’t come easily, and for some, it never comes at all.\n\nEarly in my work with incarcerated people, I received a letter from a young man who was about ten years in on a life sentence. His letter was beautifully and passionately written. He was 19 the night the convenience store clerk was shot and killed. It wasn’t his gun and he didn’t shoot the man. He was riding in the car. The shooter was his sister’s boyfriend.\n\nYou say one word to anyone about this and I will kill your sister, he said when he dropped his passenger back home. The next day the author of my letter was arrested. Afraid for his sister, he remained silent throughout the entire trial. Before he knew what happened, he was serving a life sentence. All I need is someone on the outside willing to fight for me, the letter said.\n\nOver lunch the next week I shared his letter with two of my friends who work in prisoner advocacy and have for years. After they read it, they looked at each other and then one looked at me and said: Here’s what you need to do. You need to meet with him and tell him that the law and appeals process are not on his side. He will not win. You tell him to do the best time he can. Be the best citizen inside he can be.This is his life now.\n\nI have a marketing degree from University of Michigan, but that’s a hard sell. It is the absolute truth, but a truth no one wants to hear. A week or so later I sat across from this young man and watched him turn from hopeful back to resentful in a matter of moments. I’ll find someone else, he said, and I left. And for all I know, he’s still looking for a false prophet who will deceive him into believing he’s going home soon.\n\nStories abound of other lifers who’ve made a different choice and invested in the betterment of themselves and their community. Like Mary, they reach a turning point. They begin to look for opportunities to lead from within. They become mentors and coaches for other inmates… they take and teach classes… they employ other inmates in partnership with outside charities. They’re living in exile, but they’ve made it their home. Some might call it resignation. Others call it doing good time. They’ve settled down to build a life right where they are.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nIn the 6th century, St. Benedict formalized a rule of living for monastic communities. To the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, he added a vow of stability: a vow to commit to a specific geographic place and stay there for life. One Benedictine community describes it this way:\n\nWe vow to remain all our life with our local community. We live together, pray together, work together, relax together. We give up the temptation to move from place to place in search of an ideal situation. Ultimately there is no escape from oneself, and the idea that things would be better someplace else is usually an illusion. And when interpersonal conflicts arise, we have a great incentive to work things out and restore peace.\n\nThis means learning the practices of love: acknowledging one’s own offensive behavior, giving up one’s preferences, forgiving.\n\nBenedictines not only commit to their own internal community; they commit to care for their immediate neighbors as well.\n\nIn September of this year, PBS re-released a documentary called The Rule about a Benedictine school in Newark NJ. After the Newark riots of 1967, enrollment in the school plummeted. People were afraid. In 1972, the school closed. The order of monks who ran the school split. Some moved to a safer place and opened a new school there. Others refused to forsake their vow of stability and re-opened the school a year later. They doubled-down on their commitment to provide education for the students of their Newark neighborhood, many of whom couldn’t afford tuition.\n\nTheir story is fraught with struggle. Sometimes education takes a back seat to survival as students grow up living motel to motel or without fathers or surrounded by violence. Over and over again the monks teach each young man about his connectedness to the wider community. What hurts my brother, hurts me, is a school motto.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nAll theology is rooted in geography, writes Eugene Peterson, your place is that without which you could not do your work.\n\nOur church is rooted in a specific town. It is where we’re called to settle down, dig in and live out our ministry in community, trusting that God is ready and able to work with us and through us right here. Here and now we have some unique opportunities.\n\nTomorrow night there’s a City Council Study Session on the proposal to repurpose Herrick Manor as transitional housing for women and children. It starts at 7pm. There will be an opportunity, like there was last Monday, for public comment. And there will be opportunities to listen, to observe, to feel and to be present in the room. Remember how last Sunday I talked about leaving the light on? Bearing the light of Christ into doubt and fear and anger and grief…\n\nThe papers and radio told about last week’s City Council meeting: there was an outpouring of compassion and conviction on the part of this church and this town and City Council voted unanimously to take another look at the zoning decision. I’m thrilled with the outcome. But as I walked from City Hall back to the church, I thought about Dick Darm.\n\nDick and his wife live in the closest house to Herrick Manor. Like everyone else, I didn’t like what he said in the meeting, but the response wasn’t right either. What hurts my brother, hurts me.\n\nThe next day, I went to see Dick. I took him a jar of homemade applesauce. I just wanted to listen. He wasn’t home. I left my card with a note and the applesauce.\n\nLater he called me and left a long voicemail. He was thankful for my gift and for my outreach. He said he never had a chance to finish what he wanted to say and that was unfortunate. He works long hours and his wife is alone in the house most of the day. His biggest concern, he said, is safety. He said he believes the county needs a place for these women and children, but we need to make sure the people outside the facility are safe too.\n\nNo one has given me a 100% guarantee that my family will be safe, he said.\n\nI get it. Don’t you? We all want that. Safety for our loved ones can never be 100% guaranteed of course. We all know that. Anyone who says otherwise is a false prophet. But we owe it to each other in this town to make sure we do the best we can to ensure safety for the neighbors and for the women and children, should this transitional housing become a reality.\n\nDick began his comments on Monday night by calling himself a jerk. He’s not a jerk. He’s a concerned husband, father and grandfather. I’ve driven by Dick Darm’s house dozens of times on my way to visit people in Herrick Manor and in the hospital and on my way to my own doctor’s appointments and tests. He’s been invisible to me just like so many of the other residents of this town. May this be an opportunity to live more fully into our church’s mission of Invisible City and really see each other.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nThis is an extraordinary time for our town to do something of great importance and compassion: to learn together about homelessness and poverty… about prejudices and privilege… about ignorance and invalid assumptions… to ensure that fragile and vulnerable members of our community have access to a roof, warmth, hot showers, food, education, job skills training and an opportunity to invest in a new life… and to ensure that all voices are heard in the debate.\n\nIt’s humbling for all of us, but it’s an amazing opportunity to, in the words of that Benedictine community, learn the practices of love: acknowledge one’s own offensive behavior, give up one’s preferences and forgive.\n\nDuring last week’s City Council meeting I held a sign that said: Tecumseh, a town with heart. May we help our town live into that sign with a heart for all.\n\nJeremiah encouraged the people to seek the peace and prosperity of the city into which they had been sent. Pray to the LORD for it, he wrote, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.\n\nWe are theologians in residence, called to teach the real meaning of prosperity in this town. It is a deep and abiding wellness. The Hebrew word is Shalom: wholeness, safety, completeness, peace – in all and for all.\n\nMay we settle down into that good and holy work of a lifetime.\n\n11/19/17\n\nScripture: Isaiah 9:1-7\n\nSermon: Leaving the Light On\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel put our Scripture reading for this morning on the map through his famous oratorio Messiah, first performed in Dublin in April of 1742.\n\nApril, you say? Not December? Right – Handel wrote Messiah during Lent as an Easter piece. Only the first 1/3 of it is about the birth of Christ – the rest about his death and resurrection.\n\nHandel interprets these verses from Isaiah as foretelling the birth of Jesus. The gospel writer Matthew makes that connection as well – as do we. Almost always, we read this text during Advent: “The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who lived in a land of deep darkness—on them light has shined…” And while we can make that connection after the fact, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. There’s a historical setting to this story, and to that we now turn.\n\nIt’s the 8th century BC. Assyrian armies, with the support of the Southern Kingdom of Judah, are destroying the Northern Kingdom of Israel. They’ve already taken thousands of people into captivity and deported them to Assyria. Those who remain are lost – their neighborhoods and communities invaded and all they’ve held dear gone.\n\nIn the South, things are only marginally better. To defend against a civil war with the North and to appease the Assyrians, King Ahaz made a deal with the King of Assyria. As a vassal state, Judah was forced to pledge loyalty to the Assyrian gods. King Ahaz turned a part of the Temple in Jerusalem into a shrine to Asshur – king of the Assyrian gods. Ahaz even sacrificed one of his own children on that altar.\n\nThe people walked in darkness.\n\nBut, the prophet Isaiah proclaims, upon them, a light shines.\n\nAfter Ahaz, comes his son – a new, young king — and a good king – one who leads Judah through wide-sweeping religious reforms. About King Hezekiah, whose name literally means “strength of the Lord”, the biblical historians wrote: He trusted in the LORD the God of Israel; so that there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah after him, or among those who were before him. The LORD was with him; wherever he went, he prospered.\n\nHezekiah led a huge temple renovation project and reinstated the worship traditions of God’s people. And to the first Passover celebration since the renovation was complete, Hezekiah invited everybody. He even sent messengers into the Northern Kingdom –to the struggling remnant of the ten tribes— to invite them to come too… calling on them to set aside their political divisions and remember their spiritual kinship:\n\nO people of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. Come brothers and sisters… come unite with us for worship… come remember the story of our ancestors and our freedom… come home.\n\nThe people who walked in darkness, awaken to see a great light…\n\nLet’s listen to Brett play hymn #86 all the way through once and then let’s sing the story – a song which the prophet Isaiah very well may have sung during Hezekiah’s great Passover festival.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nMaricao is described as the poorest town on the island of Puerto Rico. 60 days after Hurricane Maria, it is still without electricity. Most of its 5000 residents live in the mountains. Farmers and coffee growers… they lost everything with the hurricane.\n\nA Presbyterian Disaster Assistance delegation met with members of the Iglesia Presbyteriana in Maricao to discuss the challenges facing their church. Anna Maria “Bachita” Segarra was there. She is 100 years old and grew up in the church. She lost everything in the hurricane. We can’t even imagine her heartache. But she was so excited to meet with the PDA delegation that she ended the meeting by ringing the church bell.\n\nOf the 30 churches in that presbytery, half were damaged; a handful badly. Flooded rivers sent water up to the ceilings in some churches. Your generosity in your offerings supports their restoration, as you give through the church to disaster relief.\n\nMoving from San Juan to the west coast and then up into the mountains, we continue to uncover the depth of the catastrophe that has affected Puerto Rico, said the Rev. Dr. Laurie Kraus, PDA director. In the Bible, the word apocalypse means to uncover. It’s interesting that in popular culture, we tend to use the word to describe catastrophic occurrences and situations. But if we look at the word biblically, (it’s about uncovering) things hidden or deep.”\n\nKraus says she’s witnessed the depth of spiritual strength and imagination in how people are responding to the emergency needs of their neighbors, with limited access to their own resources. They’re feeding those who are hungry in a very ‘loaves and fishes’ kind of way,” she said. They’re tending to the migrants and the forgotten and they’re doing that with a worshipful heart.\n\nThe people who dwelt in the land of the shadow, rise to a star shining bright…\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nLast Sunday, one week after the devastating shooting in the church in Sutherland Springs Texas, just before sundown, the church reopened to the public as a memorial. In one week’s time people worked tirelessly to strip the church of the bloodstained carpets… they painted the concrete floor white… and they took all the pews out, replacing them with 25 simple white chairs, placed where those who died had fallen. Only the individual’s first name is painted on each of the chairs: Crystal, Karla, Marc, Robert, Emily, Sara… and on each one, rests a single red rose.\n\nFor Pastor Frank Pomeroy, erasing the visible signs of destruction demonstrates the resolve that comes with faith. Rather than choose darkness, we choose life, he said to a crowd gathered for worship earlier Sunday morning. 1000 people came together from a variety of faiths – the largest number of people to come together for worship in the church’s 100 year history.\n\nThree days earlier members of the church gathered to open their weekly food pantry called By His Grace. The pantry’s director, 71 year old Lula White, was killed in the shooting. She was the grandmother of the shooter’s wife. People crowded inside, hugging and crying and filling bags with donated groceries, pastries and clothing – like they do every week.\n\nDespite their grief and heartache and loss, this church is leaving the light on for the world to see.\n\n✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜\n\nAn invitation to a political enemy to worship together… a 100 year old woman who’s lost everything in a hurricane ringing a church bell… a church refusing to let evil diminish their witness or close their service to the hungry and poor in their community for even one week… Leaving the light on in the midst of deep darkness.\n\nDeep darkness, tsalmavet in the Hebrew, literally: shadow of death.\n\nYea though I walk through the valley of tsalmavet I will fear no evil.\n\nThose who live in a land of tsalmavet on them, light has shined.\n\nIt’s the role of the prophet and the people of God to keep the light shining, or in the words of Frederick Buechner, to live an implausible dream – transcending circumstance… redeeming… restoring the reality that surrounds them; renouncing darkness.\n\nAccording to Advertising Age magazine it was one of the top 100 best advertising campaigns of the 20th century: I’m Tom Bodett for Motel 6 and We’ll Leave the Light on For ya.\n\nWhat’s that about? Why was that slogan so successful?\n\nWhen I was young I remember going to a haunted house and being so scared that I screamed and screamed until they turned the lights on. Yep, I was that kid. But as soon as the lights went on, nothing was scary anymore – the shadows had lost their power.\n\nThat’s what we’re talking about, isn’t it?\n\nShining a light of truth into falsehood…\n\nShining a light of hope into despair…\n\nShining a light of peace into fear…\n\nShining a light of compassion and empathy into hatred and division…\n\nShining a light of healing gentleness into grief…\n\nThe gospel writer John wrote: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not, (does not, will not) overcome it.\n\nIn the name and for the sake of Christ, we are to be light-bearers – people committed to leaving the light on.\n\nNot literally, of course. Even Tom Bodett admits that Motel 6 doesn’t literally leave the light on for you – you have to turn it on when you walk into the room.\n\nWe’re a creation-care church and sustainability is one of our core values. When our daughter was young, she posted notes next to every light switch in our house that said: Leaving? Turn the Light off. Please write this note upon your hearts. When you are the last one out of a room or hallway, please turn the light off.\n\nBut spiritually and emotionally – leave the light – the light of Christ on for each other.\n\nWe’re coming into the holidays. They’re wonderful times for some and painful, dark times for others. Some of our friends and family members are struggling with relationship issues or job losses or health crises… some of our tables remain divided politically or religiously… How will we leave the light on for our loved ones? How will we make the space safer, more hospitable, more gracious? And how will we bear witness to that deeper and ever-burning light source – from which our light comes?\n\nWe sometimes sing a song called the Servant Song:\n\nWill you let me be your servant\n\nLet me be as Christ to you\n\nPray that I might have the grace\n\nTo let you be my servant too.\n\nIn another verse are these words:\n\nI will hold the Christ light for you\n\nIn the night time of your fear\n\nI will hold my hand out to you\n\nSpeak the peace you long to hear.\n\nMay it be so – for you, for me and for us as church.\n\n11/12/17\n\nNearly 100 years have passed since the days of Elijah and Ahab and Jezebel, and the Northern Kingdom of Israel, with King Jeroboam II at the helm, enjoyed political and economic prosperity, the likes of which it had never before known. But morally and spiritually they were corrupt.\n\nGod sent a shepherd named Amos from the fields of Jerusalem, in the Southern Kingdom of Judah to preach a wake-up call to the North.\n\nThis morning, we’ll hear an excerpt of his message:\n\nScripture:Amos 1:1-2, 5:14-15, 21-24\n\nSermon: Just Worship\n\nHow about this!\n\nOn the very day we dedicate our pledges – our promised financial offerings for next year, we read about a time when God rejected the offerings of the people, was disgusted by their worship, tuned out their music and disregarded their prayers.\n\nI didn’t pick this Scripture for this Sunday.\n\nSince September, I’ve been preaching the Narrative Lectionary – a set of readings that moves through the story of God in relationship with God’s people – from the beginning. And that relationship, like any relationship, has it’s ups and downs. This is a down.\n\nThere are other texts where God is joyful over the offerings of the people. And if I were picking a text for today, I’d have been tempted to choose one of those – so we could feel good about what we’re doing – blessed – warm and fuzzy and close to God.\n\nBut this is so much better. Harder, but better.\n\nAmos, whose very name in Hebrew means bearer of burdens, brings us a warning – a cautionary tale: it’s not just about the offering… not just about the worship… it’s about bearing a burden for justice and righteousness into the world – about being accountable to practice what we preach in our neighborhoods and community… to connect our faith and spirituality with our politics and our public discourse… it’s about investing through the gifts of our resources and our lives into the common good.\n\nFaith without action is dead, we read in the epistle of James. And in Amos, we read, in so many words: Faith without justice is abhorrent to God.\n\nSo, in the spirit of Amos, let’s look at our life together under the justice microscope. Using some of Amos’ references: let’s let the plumb line drop and see where things are askew. Let’s put the silver on the scale and see if the needy get more than a pair of sandals.\n\nWhat is justice?\n\nIn our culture, justice is most often thought of in connection with the criminal justice system: ensuring offenders receive the punishment that fits their crime, restoring what’s been broken or lost, granting the victim or victim’s family satisfaction that responsible parties have been held appropriately accountable.\n\nMore broadly, justice refers to the administration of law. Hence Lady Justice, depicted on the cover of the bulletin is found in front of courthouses across our land – scales in one hand to weigh the arguments of both sides evenly, a double-edged sword in the other hand because although reason can be used both ways, justice has the power to enforce the law – and she’s usually wearing a blindfold so as not to be biased.\n\nBut when Amos and the biblical prophets talk about justice, they’re referring to economic and social justice. Not fairness where everybody gets an equal share, but justice, where everybody gets the resources needed to thrive.\n\nMy mother had a line she used to say back to me whenever I’d cry: That’s not fair! Life’s not fair, she’d say. Which is true, but teaching our children and each other that life’s not just is also true and we have a responsibility to that. Everybody doesn’t come into the world on a level playing field and there are social and economic structures in place that keep it that way, if not make it worse.\n\nAmos spoke to that, because in his day as in ours gross abuses of wealth and privilege and exploitation of and violence toward the weak, poor and vulnerable made for a sick and corrupt society.\n\nSome people had way more resources than they would ever need and lived in luxury, while others were homeless, begging even for a pair of shoes, and dying in the streets. God’s people were silent, complacent, complicit, and oblivious to their responsibility to it.\n\nAnd God was not and is not ok with that.\n\nSo let’s look through the justice lens at each of the ministry areas we outlined in our narrative budget. We’ll start with Pastoral Care. This includes tending after one another through prayer, support and visitation, and being the heart and face of Christ to those in need in the community. From time to time, people come to our church asking for help: a gas card or assistance with a utility bill or a car repair. Because of the generosity of this church, through our offerings, the Deacons administer a mercy fund for these types of requests.\n\nLast Thursday night at the Deacon meeting, we began to study a book together called: A Framework for Understanding Poverty. In it, the author, Dr. Ruby Payne, offers this working definition for poverty: The extent to which an individual does without resources. By resources, she means: financial, emotional, mental, spiritual, physical, support systems, role models and knowledge of the hidden rules of the game.\n\nAlmost always, when someone comes to the church for help, there are other things going on: chronic mental or physical illness, disconnected family, limited social network. Some live from one crisis to the next. That’s why it’s important for us to listen with our hearts to the rest of the story and to partner with other organizations and churches in the county — to sit at the table together–to help the whole system work more compassionately and productively.\n\nBut when we look at this under the justice lens, what else do we see? Times are tough and getting tougher as State and Federal budgets for human services are cut. More and more people in the county are facing housing, food and healthcare insecurity. When we see trends, or we learn about laws being passed that will cut resources for the most vulnerable, what do we do?\n\nWhat about the need for temporary housing for women and children in our county, for example – a need we’ve become aware of through Invisible City, our Deacons and our work with Catherine Cobb and Share the Warmth. We were hopeful that Herrick Manor might be repurposed as a new shelter, but last week, a zoning interpretation led to a “no” vote by our city council. As a church in this town, what’s our response? We pray for those in need, and what do we do?\n\nLet’s look at our education ministries. Again, because of the generosity of this church through our offerings, we’ve invested in our Sunday morning nursery/preschool, by hiring two staff people to grow the program. Both Samantha and Laura are credentialed in early childhood education. Every week, they plan a theme-based craft and learning activity each week to teach our youngest children Bible stories and faith practices.\n\nThrough adult education classes and Courageous Conversations we’re seeking to foster learning and dialogue about how our faith informs our responses to the complex issues of our day.\n\nBut when we put education under the justice lens, what else do we see? What’s happening in the middle school and high school that may inhibit a student’s ability to learn and thrive? What may be negatively impacting their support systems or emotional health? How are we reaching out to teens as mentors or coaches?\n\nWhat kinds of teen social and spiritual groups are needed? Who among us is on the front line, listening? Who can help guide us forward? We pray for our children to learn and grow into healthy adults, but how does our prayer convert to action?\n\nWhat about our hospitality ministries?\n\nLast week after the shooting in the church in Texas, this posting appeared on a Facebook group of pastors:\n\nOne of my parishioners wants us to lock the doors after worship begins. She also wants me to lock the door during office hours. Lots of comments followed, including one pastor who jokingly suggested posting a Deacon with an automatic weapon at the main door wearing a welcome t-shirt and another who, not jokingly said 6 parishioners carry concealed weapons in their church every Sunday and he has carried in the pulpit in the past. He wrote:\n\nI am of the strong belief we should prepare for the worst, and pray for the best. If force is not needed to protect the parish PRAISE GOD! But, as in Sutherland, TX, Columbia, SC, etc. evil happens all the time. I would rather be secure with force than be on the evening news talking about those killed.\n\nIt reminds me of the little band of disciples who were locked in the room for fear of the Jews when the resurrected Jesus came and stood among them, saying Peace be with you.\n\nPeople come into the church seeking sanctuary. People I’ve never seen before occasionally come in during the week to pray. What’s the message of a locked door or posted security detail?\n\nWhat about hospitality and justice? What is the purpose and nature of sanctuary… safe space… shelter… support… Who in our community needs it the most and how accessible is it? What negative baggage about church keeps people away from it? What kind of proactive healing is needed? How does the space itself speak a word of love and hope to people who walk into it?\n\nLooking at our mission and outreach ministries, we’ve been busy. We’ve been out in neighbors’ yards and in the Catherine Cobb Safe House through Invisible City. We’ve hosted mission partners from other parts of the world to learn about their culture and Christianity.\n\nWe’ve hosted events to help our partners raise funds for their work in the community. And we’ve begun to encourage the generosity of the community to help our mission partners too.\n\nTo engage in justice work through mission is a paradigm shift. It’s listening to the cries we hear through the relationships we’re forming and examining the structures that cause the pain. For example: what are the root causes of domestic violence and power abuse? Beyond organizing collections and painting rooms and helping Catherine Cobb raise money, what kinds of preventative work can we do?\n\nHow do we work to expose and unravel deeply ingrained generational racism? Courageous conversations are a great start, but what do we do next to affect real change?\n\nLast January at our leadership retreat, one of our elders suggested we get a list of every civic organization in our town and have somebody from our church at every table – eyes and ears and heart fully connected and engaged with this community. That’s how we hear what’s going on and where the gaps are. That’s how we partner for justice — that all may have access to the resources they need to thrive: financial, emotional, mental, spiritual, physical, support systems and role models.\n\nI’ve saved worship for last. Maybe it’s the hardest.\n\nIt’s about worship that people have some of the strongest opinions. Familiar patterns imprinted on our hearts… from the church of our childhood, we remember that song we used to sing at the end of every worship service… or reciting the Apostle’s Creed every week after the sermon.\n\nWe have opinions on the best way to serve communion and the type of bread to use… Some of us wish we had kneelers in the pews and more silence… and Christmas Eve isn’t quite right without colored bells for the children and candles during Silent Night.\n\nIn an ever changing world, for some, worship is the one thing they can count on – the one thing that brings them comfort week after week to hear the old, old story of Jesus and his love in a familiar way.\n\nYet, it’s through worship that God’s people are formed – the prayers, the songs, the readings, the practices… They’re to be purposeful and meaningful – to convict us and shape us – into people of Christ. Just worship is worship that teaches and embodies God’s dream for the world. But not so that it stays within these four walls. It is to go out with us, changing our lives to change the world.\n\nWhen we stand to sing, we are standing before the living God and in Richard Foster’s words:\n\nTo stand before the Holy One of eternity is to change. Resentments cannot be held with the same tenacity when we enter his gracious light… In worship an increased power steals its way into the heart sanctuary, an increased compassion grows in the soul. To worship is to change.\n\nOne of my favorite books on worship is by South African pastor John van de Laar called: The Hour That Changes Everything: How worship forms us into the people God wants us to be.\n\nVan de Laar wrote the book as a response to the prophetic call of Isaiah and Amos to a life of worship that overflows into a life of justice. Everything we do from the Call to Worship to the Confession and Assurance of Forgiveness… the passing of the peace and the offering of thanksgiving… the reading and proclaiming of the Word… the music… the prayers and the sacraments – everything is counter-cultural and intended to teach us a different way of living and being with and for the world.\n\nVan de Laar suggests that the only valid measurement of authentic worship is the extent to which we are changed into people who reflect Christ’s values, Christ’s attitudes and Christ’s gracious activity in the world.\n\nIt’s not just worship. It’s pastoral care and education and hospitality and mission and outreach – but it’s so much more than all of that.\n\nAll of that is the means by which we enter the world bearing the burden of justice and righteousness, practicing what we preach, living our faith in the public square and pouring ourselves out for the common good — in the name and for the sake of all God’s children – that all may live and live abundantly.\n\nThat’s God’s dream. May it be ours as well.\n\n11/05/17\n\nScripture: 1 Kings 19:1-18\n\nSermon: Strength for the Journey\n\nTick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick…\n\nI was working on my sermon and the sound of the woodpecker pecking away on my house was incessant. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick… Like Chinese water torture.\n\nI couldn’t hear myself think. Tick, tick, tick, tick… I got up from my desk, stormed down the stairs, walked out onto the back deck and looked up and there he was – at the very top of the roof peak, pecking away.\n\nHey—Do you mind taking that somewhere else? I’m trying to work here. He stopped for a second and then started again. Hey! Enough already! Go find some other place – you’ve got 50 acres of woods to choose from, stop pecking at my house!\n\nJezebel was like that woodpecker, but a whole lot worse. She was relentless and stubborn and hell-bent on destruction. It didn’t matter that God won the Mt. Carmel contest. It didn’t matter that it was finally raining again. She wouldn’t quit until Elijah was dead. There’s just no reasoning with that kind of madness. So Elijah ran for his life – almost the full length of Israel—into the Judean wilderness.\n\nHe settled under a broom tree. One of the only flowering trees of the desert, it’s drought resistant, sweet smelling and its branches provide thick shade as well as slow-burning fuel. Its no surprise the broom tree is an ancient middle-eastern symbol of renewal. But like a sick and wounded animal, Elijah climbs under it to die.\n\nHe’s had enough.\n\nWhen the rhythm of the heart becomes hectic,\n\ntime takes on the strain until it breaks;\n\nthen all the unattended stress falls in\n\non the mind like an endless, increasing weight,\n\nwrites John O’Donohue, Celtic poet, in his poem: “Blessing for one who is Exhausted”\n\nthe light in the mind becomes dim.\n\nThings you could take in your stride before\n\nnow become laborsome events of will.\n\nWeariness invades your spirit.\n\nGravity begins falling inside you,\n\ndragging down every bone,\n\nThe tide you never valued has gone out.\n\nAnd you are marooned on unsure ground.\n\nSomething within you has closed down;\n\nand you cannot push yourself back to life.\n\nElijah cannot conceive of any other plan. His entire hand has been played. He’s given all he has and it’s fallen short. He has failed to turn the tide; failed to make a lasting difference.\n\nI don’t know anyone who hasn’t been there: sick and tired of being sick and tired.\n\nThe Bedouins minister to people like Elijah.\n\nDesert tent-dwellers then and now, they are bound to an ethic of hospitality. A simple loaf of flatbread baked on coals and water… a gift from a stranger to a stranger… a little bit of strength in time of need. Non-intrusive, asking nothing in return – pure grace.\n\nI remember reading a few years ago on Facebook – a post either from Mrs. Orlowski or Mrs. Gonzales, I don’t remember which one– mothers whose sons died suddenly in that tragic auto accident that broke the hearts of our whole town—one of them posted a note of gratitude on Facebook to the anonymous angel who left several boxes of Kleenex on her front porch – exactly what she needed when she had no strength even to go to the store, but the tears would not stop flowing; a symbol that others were weeping with her; a silent sign that she was not alone.\n\nOn Thursdays at 6 in our “Giving Heart” study, we’ve been talking about practicing generosity – showing God’s abundant blessings. Some of the most meaningful gifts are the simplest. They are the ones that when given, in the words of Teresa of Avila:\n\n…the feeling remains that God is on the journey, too.\n\nJohn O’Donohue’s poem continues:\n\nYou have been forced to enter empty time.\n\nThe desire that drove you has relinquished.\n\nThere is nothing else to do now but rest\n\nand patiently learn to receive the self\n\nyou have forsaken in the race of days.\n\nYou have traveled too fast over false ground;\n\nNow your soul has come to take you back.\n\nWhat are you doing here, Elijah? the question is asked deep into his soul… calling forth reflection, truth telling, confession.\n\nI have been very zealous for the LORD, he says. Indeed he has. His enthusiasm, his passion, his fervor for the LORD God was exactly what God saw in him and why God chose him to organize the contest on Mt. Carmel.\n\nIt is one of the most compelling and dramatic stories in all of the Bible: The wood on the altar was soaked three times – even the trench was filled with water when Elijah began to pray: O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your bidding. Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so that these people may know that you, O LORD are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.\n\nAnd when the fire from the LORD fell upon the altar and every drop of water was licked up in it’s heat – every person fell to the ground – faces down in worship, hearts turned toward God.\n\nWhy didn’t the story end there? What purpose, what gain did Elijah serve by rounding up and killing all of Baal’s prophets? There’s zealotry and then there’s fanaticism… there’s zealotry and then there’s extremism… there’s zealotry and then there’s obsession, vengeance, insanity… What really brings glory to God? Worship or blood lust?\n\nI know it’s sometimes hard to tell in these violent texts of the Old Testament. I wish there had been a more direct critique of Elijah’s overzealous massacre. Yet, even with what’s here I think we can draw some conclusions:\n\nGod’s voice is not in the shattering power of the storm… God’s voice is not in the chaos of the earthquake, not in the ravage of the fire… God’s voice, God’s presence is in the sheer silence… the soft and gentle whisper. God is not in the bluster or the rage… not in overt displays of power… God is quiet, patient, disciplined strength.\n\nGenerations later when Jesus walked through Samaria with his disciples and the Samaritans refused to offer them hospitality, they asked him: Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them like Elijah did? And Jesus rebuked them. His way is peace. His way is grace. His way is love. His way, the way of the Living Word of God, is quiet disciplined strength. May we be more like Jesus.\n\nBack to John O’Donohue’s poem:\n\nTake refuge in your senses, open up\n\nto all the small miracles you rushed through.\n\nBecome inclined to watch the way of rain\n\nwhen it falls slow and free.\n\nDraw alongside the silence of stone\n\nuntil its calmness can claim you.\n\nBe excessively gentle with yourself.\n\nStay clear of those vexed in spirit.\n\nLearn to linger around someone of ease\n\nwho feels they have all the time in the world.\n\nGradually, you will return to yourself,\n\nhaving learned a new respect for your heart\n\nand the joy that dwells far within slow time.\n\nWhy are you here? God asked Elijah and I’m asking you:\n\nWhy are you here?\n\nTo find sanity in a mad, mad world?\n\nTo confess your part in the madness of it?\n\nTo linger around others who for a couple of hours suspend everything else to be with one another and sing songs of hope and pray for a healed world, and dare to believe that God is not done with any of us yet?\n\nTo be fed and nourished and renewed and refreshed for another day, another week?\n\nTo be reminded of who and whose you are and to be given bread for the day, strength for the journey – the complicated, painful, wonderful, surprising, amazing journey of life?\n\nGet up and eat, for the journey is too much for you, the messenger of grace said to Elijah. Indeed the journey is too much for any one of us. We come here to be part of a community of faith… to lift each other and to be lifted by each other… and finally to be reminded that each of us is needed, but God’s dream for humanity does not rest on any one of us. God is working through all and in all, above all and beneath all, before all and beside all – working… constantly working to bring about a just and whole world, because that is who God is.\n\nSt. John of the Cross, a Spanish friar from the mid-1500’s of the Carmelites, an order inspired by Elijah’s time of silence in the wilderness, wrote:\n\nWhat we need most in order to make progress is to be silent before this great God with our appetite and with our tongue, for the language he best hears is silent love.\n\nLet it be so for you and for me and for the church, to the glory of God.\n\n10/29/17\n\nScripture: 1 Kings 5:1-5; 8:1-13\n\nSermon: Building God’s House\n\nTake a few moments and come up with an image of church. That was our assignment. I was in seminary. Now, turn to your neighbor, and share it, our professor said. And we did.\n\nI don’t remember exactly what the person sitting next to me said, but it was something like: For me, church is more than the building, it’s the people who come together to worship God and serve the world.\n\nI said: I see stones… lots of different shapes and sizes and colors and textures – some cracked, some chipped, some smooth, some very old—none of them are perfect, but they fit loosely together. One by one they’re next to each other and stacked on top of each other – they’re being built into something – but it’s not finished. There’s no roof on it… the walls are not done. And there’s this beautiful flowering ivy growing in and through the stones –connecting them together.\n\nThen the professor said, Let’s go around the room and share with each other. There were about a dozen of us. One by one my fellow classmates spoke. And every one of them said some version of what the person sitting next to me said.\n\nThe church is a group of people that is called to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with the world…\n\nthe church is more than the people who are in the institutional church, it is also people outside living and working in the world…\n\nthe church is a place where people come together to learn and grow in faith…\n\nAnd as each person spoke, I felt more and more like I had totally missed the assignment.\n\nI see stones?\n\nI see stones, I began when it was my turn… lots of different shapes and sizes and colors and textures… After I finished, I remember feeling embarrassed.\n\nThe professor was quiet for a moment and then she said: You all have work to do. Except for one of you, you all gave me definitions when I asked for an image. Learn to speak in images, she said. They move people.\n\nIn 1 Peter 2, we find these words: Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and precious in God’s sight, and like living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture: ‘See I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious…’\n\nIt was time to build God’s house, says our text for this morning. David couldn’t do it when he was king because the fledgling nation of Israel was besieged on every side. They were too busy fighting – it consumed all their resources, their time and their energy.\n\nBut now his son Solomon was king and in his words: the Lord my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune. And in this time of peace, let the building begin.\n\nAnd indeed it did – with a massive campaign of forced labor: 30,000 men were assigned to move wood from Lebanon. They, along with 70,000 construction laborers and 80,000 stonemasons, were managed by 3300 supervisors. And talk about stones! They took enormous stones from the quarry and laid the foundation with them, then they lined the walls from floor to rafters with cedar. The whole house was overlaid with gold.\n\nIt took 7 years to build it.\n\nImagine with me that dedication day – and all that went into the detailed planning of it: musicians and banners, priests and special liturgy, all the holy vessels cleaned and properly placed, and the animals – too many to count – staged for sacrifice all along the parade route… Think of the number of people who needed to be in their places and ready – with no email confirmations!\n\nHaving just served on the planning team for the Presbytery’s worship celebration of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, I know all the work that went into it and all the loose ends and last minute emails that flew in the days leading up to last Sunday. Getting everyone in their places and lined up and ready to go was no small feat – and when the Collingwood church organist finished the prelude 3 minutes before the service was to begin, I pointed to my watch and said to the host pastor who was waiting to cue Will with the first words of the service – three more minutes. He looked at me and said, it will start when I say it will start. And it did. That was a grand celebration — but how much grander the dedication of that first permanent house of the LORD!\n\nOn that day, so long ago, when the ark of the LORD was placed inside the holy of holies for the very first time – Was there a guy with a clipboard standing anxiously on the sidelines wondering why those poles were sticking out – And who did the design calculations? Yet, didn’t that detail itself say: God cannot be contained!\n\nAnd suddenly, with a holy and thunderous: It will start when I say it will start – the presence of the LORD really and truly filled the whole place – driving out the priests and making everyone step back and drop to their knees with faces to the ground. An exclamation indeed: never forget whose house this is.\n\nUnless the LORD builds the house, those that labor, build it in vain, says the Psalmist.\n\n500 years ago, Martin Luther, in his way, said the same thing. And the Protestant Reformation began – protesting the ways in which the human-designed traditions and institutions of the church were corrupt, exploitative and heretical, and committing to reform to practices rooted in Scripture, Jesus Christ and grace. Centuries have come and gone and still the battle cry remains:\n\nEcclesia Reformata, Semper Reformanda: Church: Reformed and always being reformed — according to the word of God. It’s a call to continuously reexamine who we are, what we do and what we proclaim in every time and place — subject to the Word of God.\n\nAs living stones, let yourselves be built… We aren’t the primary actors, but the ones being acted upon – God is the builder – God is the reformer – God is the One filling the house.\n\nThroughout its nearly 150 year history, this church has been through struggle and hardship and growth and loss. As we took the 2nd graders through the church last week and once again we told the history of the horse hair in the pew cushions and the changes made to the front of the church… from pipe organ to electronic organ to the remodeling of the choir loft to the installation of the wooden Lord’s Supper carving… the broken windows replaced by windows from the Methodist church – some black and some brown and some upside down… and the bell in the steeple that used to be rung by hand and now sits silent – too fragile to be struck without repair…\n\nI thought about the families that have come and gone… the prayers and songs and tears and laughter… and still God is building this church: stone upon stone… stone next to stone…\n\nGiven our history – and particularly our most recent history as a church, consider with me again the words of King Solomon: now the Lord our God has given us rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.\n\nWe know first hand that fighting consumes a tremendous amount of energy and time and resources… and that reestablishing new policies and procedures are frustrating and distracting… and staff transitions are challenging –emotionally heavy ones are particularly hard on the whole body.\n\nCertainly we still have work to do, but doesn’t it feel like we’re in a new day? That the LORD has given our church a time of rest on every side? without adversary? without misfortune? That now we’re free to focus on being built into the church God would have us be?\n\nOver the last few years, we’ve worked hard on developing relationships with partners in our community. Increasingly, we’re seen as a dependable and generous church by those outside our walls. Organizations in the county call on us to collaborate on projects. The presbytery calls on us to help other churches as we have been helped. Most recently, Beth, our Saturday morning yoga instructor, inspired by the Catherine Cobb concert, asked us to consider hosting a yoga fundraiser to raise awareness about domestic violence.\n\nGod used the friendship—the partnership between King Hiram of Tyre and King Solomon, to build the house. How will God build through our community relationships?\n\nI see stones… new stones being laid… different kinds of stones building up and building out…\n\nBut something was missing in my image of church, as I think back on it.\n\nStones were being laid next to one another and stacked on one another but there were gaps between them. Ivy snaked up and through, but still the stones were only loosely connected to one another. What’s missing is the stuff that bonds the stones together. Mescla – they call it in Mexico.\n\nYears ago I went with teams to Mexico to build cement block houses along the border. We’d mix bunches of mescla– cement powder, gravel and water, and pass it through a bucket brigade – hand to hand, person to person. Spade after spade of it was slapped onto the gaps between the bricks and finished with the edge of the blade until all of the gaps were sealed.\n\nLike living stones, let yourselves be built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Reformation is the Priesthood of All Believers.\n\nTo combat a rising divide between priests and laity, Martin Luther said: All Christians are priests, and all priests are Christians. Worthy of anathema is any assertion that a priest is anything else than a Christian. John Calvin took this idea further and developed a new framework: Laity and clergy would serve side by side, both ordained, praying together, doing mission together, and proclaiming the word together. This is our Presbyterian polity of elders and deacons and pastors and congregation, and the Word shared between us is the mescla, the mortar that binds us, one to another.\n\nNow the Lord our God has given us rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune. It’s time to focus our resources, energy and time on the strengthening of the bonds between us – maybe through small group studies or one-on-one mentoring… through shared meals and fellowship nights – maybe through the formation of music ensembles – to proclaim the word in song…\n\nIn a day where people are becoming increasingly isolated from each other, and loneliness is on the rise, how will we let ourselves be built together… knit together… bonded together? How will the Word of God seal the gaps between us and build us as church?\n\nA few years ago, I attended a conference at a retreat center near Little Rock Arkansas. There, I saw it, the stone church of my image. This one had a roof, but the stones were all different sizes, shapes, textures and colors and stretching out from it was a stone walkway that led to a labyrinth whose path was marked with still more stones.\n\nWalking it, I noticed names written on some of the stones: Westside Middle School… Columbine… Sandy Hook… The conference center hosts healing camps for students who have been impacted by traumatic episodes of violence. When the labyrinth was built, it was the students themselves whose lives marked by stones, lined the path. For 17 years, groups of students have come and gone, leaving behind a piece of themselves as they have found healing. And that, too, is church.\n\nLiving stones that touch and heal and strengthen and connect… that reach out and encircle and support and hold… We are living stones and God is building us into a spiritual house.\n\nHow will we be built?\n\nWhat kind of a house will we be?\n\n10/15/17\n\nScripture: 1 Samuel 3\n\nSermon: Speak Up!\n\nIn those days, the word of the LORD was rare. In those days… the word of the LORD was rare? What were those days?\n\nThose days were long after Moses led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and long after manna rained down from the heavens and water poured forth from a rock…\n\nThose days were long after they’d received the\n\nTen Commandments carved into stone from the top of\n\nMt. Sinai… long after they’d built the tabernacle and placed the ark inside… long after the death of Moses.\n\nThose days were long after Joshua led them into the Promised Land and the walls of Jericho came tumbling down and the tribes settled into their territories.\n\nIn those days, the LORD raised up judges to defend the Israelites against their enemies. They were a loose federation of tribes – they had no king. And in those days, the book of Judges says: all the people did what was right in their own eyes.\n\nThose days sound a lot like these days.\n\nIn these days, in this land, we place a high value on personal freedoms, individual rights, private ownership and self determination. Truth is relative, boundaries are porous and no one has the authority to impose his or her idea of moral right or wrong on anyone else.\n\nThat’s not all bad. We value authenticity and taking responsibility for our own voices and thoughts and will. We want our children to grow up with confidence and to recognize and develop their unique passions and gifts. We encourage self development and self expression.\n\nBut in the pursuit of our highest American ideals of independence and freedom, we’ve sidelined mutual responsibility and shared community. We’ve ascribed higher values to some people over others… and some people’s freedoms over others… we’ve legitimized disrespect… and we’ve honored position and privilege over sacrifice and service.\n\nWe’ve forgotten that we grow alongside others… that we are actually accountable to one another… that we don’t live in individual silos but in families and in communities and we are interdependent, even as we are increasingly distant from each other… distrusting of each other… fearful even.\n\nAnd in this land, we’ve allowed our Christian faith to be co-opted as an instrument of the state.\n\nIn these days, we do what is right in our own eyes… for our own pleasure and our own gain. And in these days, as in those days, the word of the LORD is rare.\n\nIn the biblical story, when things got out of whack, God raised up prophets – truth-tellers- people who would be God’s mouthpieces to call the people back into right relationships with God and with one another.\n\nWe live in a time of confusion, isolation and heartache. Our cities are being destroyed by earthquakes, storms and wildfires. Our communities are fractured by polarizing attitudes—if ever we need a word from the LORD, surely it’s in these days…\n\nIs God speaking? Are we listening? Are we able to hear? Do we have the courage to speak up? Are truth-tellers welcome here?\n\nLet’s look to our story from this morning for clues for today:\n\nFirst – God calls prophets from inside the mess. Eli’s family was corrupt and Samuel, while not technically one of Eli’s sons, had a front row seat. Samuel was actually born to another couple: a faithful man who made regular pilgrimages to Shiloh – the center of Israelite worship before the Temple was built in Jerusalem – with his wife — who for years was barren. Hannah went with her husband to worship and she prayed and prayed for a child.\n\nWhen she finally became pregnant, Hannah vowed to dedicate her son – who she named “Samuel” – God has heard — to the LORD – to literally give him to Eli the priest, to be raised by him – to grow as a servant of the LORD.\n\nBut all was not well in Eli’s house. Eli’s sons were priests too—priests who didn’t know the LORD or care for the people they served. They took what didn’t belong to them and used the privilege of their position to extort and coerce those who were vulnerable and trusting. They were a scandal to the priesthood, an offense to God and harmful to the very people to whom they were responsible.\n\nSamuel grew up right in the middle of this.\n\nHe learned to be a priest while watching the effects of the perversion of it. Like Moses before him, growing up watching the brutality of slavery, Samuel knew first hand what wrong looked like.\n\nOver and over again, God calls prophets from the middle of the context in which they are needed — calls people to speak up and speak into the very corruption in which they live… In the words of the prophet Isaiah: I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips. Prophets are called to speak a word of God into what they know first hand.\n\nNext– God calls prophets who are tuned in. Samuel knew what was wrong—he regularly witnessed it—he lived surrounded by it, but Samuel was a young man of integrity in his own place. We’re told he grew in stature and in favour with the LORD and with the people. He was grounded and disciplined and remained focused on the task at hand. Maybe that’s why, when the call came Samuel was able to hear it.\n\nProphets are first and foremost listeners – intense listeners.\n\nOn the cover of the bulletin today is the Janet McKenzie painting entitled: Elijah Hears the Still Small Voice of God. About this piece, Janet writes: It is the moment Elijah has come through the violence of earthquakes, fire and wind and hears, in exquisite silence, the still small voice of God. His face reflects intense focus as he recognizes that ever so quiet voice reaching out to him. With eyes closed in concentration and hands cupping his ears, he strains to capture every word.\n\nProphets are tuned in and ready to receive. Here I am, Lord, Speak! I’m listening.\n\nGod gives prophets hard truths to speak. After the LORD finished speaking, Samuel stayed in bed. It’s one thing to know something is wrong and another thing altogether to be called to speak it aloud – to speak the pain of it… the inconvenience of it… the naked, shameful reality of it. It’s almost always bad news before it’s good news.\n\nThere needs to be a pregnant silence between hearing and speaking a word from the LORD… an uneasy and uncomfortable pause when the prophet holds the word—the necessary, aching word… holds it and examines it – wrestling with the seemingly impossibility of speaking it and the incredible burden of knowing that it must be spoken.\n\nPresbyterian pastor Frederick Buechner imagines this pondering time as a time when all goes silent and images flash – as if we were to watch the evening news without sound and in slow motion – without interpretation or explanation or justification – just image after image playing in agonizing and blessed silence.\n\nSamuel lay on the bed holding the word and watching in his mind’s eye over and over again all that he had seen – the greed and abuse, the disdain and disrespect, the heartbroken father suffering in silence, the people restless and abandoned…\n\nAnd the word of the LORD washed over the images, confirming that there can only be hope on the other side of the pain… But Eli… what about Eli… the only father Samuel’s known…\n\nCan truth be spoken without hurting the ones we love?\n\nFinally, the grace in the story is in the invitation to speak. Not surprisingly, when morning came and he stood before Eli, Samuel was afraid to tell him what the Lord had said. But Eli welcomed the truth: What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me.\n\nTo welcome truth – that’s the real rarity. To intentionally cultivate hospitable space – to treat a truth-teller with honor and respect – as a guest – to make space for the uninterrupted hearing of unvarnished truth. Not what we want to hear, but what we need to hear.\n\nRemember that Hans Christian Andersen story of the early 1800’s – The Emperor’s New Clothes? The emperor just had to have the latest and greatest wardrobe available – especially something made by those two new tailors in town who had such amazing fabric – magic it was – it was invisible to those who were either unfit for their positions or unusually stupid.\n\nIf he wore something made out of that, he figured, he would know instantly who was expendable from his court and he would be able to tell the wise man from the fool.\n\nBut, truth-tellers were not welcome in this emperor’s court. Instead, he demanded constant flattery. To the person: his minister, his officials, his entire entourage – each and every one pretended to see the cloth so they wouldn’t be revealed to be unfit or stupid. It took a child to speak the truth – in front of the whole town as the emperor paraded his new outfit for all to see:\n\nHe hasn’t got anything on!\n\nHad anyone, anyone been invited to tell the truth at any point along the way, How that story would have ended differently.\n\nIt’s risky to invite a truth-teller into your life, your home, the church, the office, the halls of government – risky… courageous… but the way back into right relationships begins when truth is spoken and heard.\n\nIn those days and in these days, the word of the LORD is rare. Rare – not as in infrequent and not as in undercooked, but as in rare treasure: precious, costly, of great value.\n\nWhat’s needed is good listeners: grounded in scripture, faithful practice and prayer – tuned in and focused to hear that still small voice amid the cacophony of distractions.\n\nWhat’s needed is silence between the hearing and the speaking – silence to hold the word until it sinks into our bones and we are compelled to speak.\n\nWhat’s needed is courage – courage to stand up and to speak up as the LORD our God leads us to do.\n\nSpeak O Lord, we pray, with a deep longing and not a small amount of trepidation… your servant church is listening. May it be so.\n\n10/08/17\n\nScripture: Exodus 16:1-18\n\nSermon: Enough Already\n\nFor over 1000 years, Jewish families have been singing a favorite song during Passover. It’s called Dayenu — It would have been enough.\n\nThere are 15 verses: Had God brought us out of Egypt and not given us their wealth – it would have been enough…\n\nHad God given us their wealth and not split the sea for us – it would have been enough…\n\nHad God split the sea for us and not supplied our needs in the desert for 40 years, it would have been enough…\n\nHad God supplied our needs in the desert for 40 years and not given us manna, it would have been enough…\n\nHad God given us manna and not given us the Sabbath, it would have been enough…\n\nIt’s a song of thanksgiving for God’s generosity. Naming blessing after blessing after blessing — from Sabbath to Mt. Sinai to the Torah to the Promised Land to the building of the Temple – the song covers the story of Israelite and Jewish identity – each time with the chorus: Dayenu – Day: enough, enu: for us.\n\nBut the song was written long after the fact looking backwards – after all of these things had already been given. As the biblical writers tell it, the people were far from content along the way – grumbling at each step.\n\nTo remind each other of this, Persian and Afghani Jews hit each other over the head and shoulders with scallions every time they sing Dayenu – especially during the verse that talks about manna in the wilderness, because after eating manna day after day after day the Israelites longed for onions and leeks and garlic… How many different ways, after all, can you prepare manna in the wilderness?\n\nThat would have been enough for us? After the fact, they could sing it, but in the moment – they were anxious, angry, lost, fearful. But they were learning… learning to be God’s free people. Learning to trust, learning to depend upon God, learning the blessing of enough…\n\nAll that I have is yours, was the theme of the conference I attended on generosity week before last. All that I have is yours, said the father to the elder son in the parable of the prodigal son – luke 15. You remember the story?\n\nTwo sons. The younger went to his father and demanded his portion of the inheritance early then went far away and spent it all on wasteful living. When he had nothing left and nowhere else to turn, he came home — willing to be a servant in his father’s household.\n\nIn a surprising display of generosity and overwhelming forgiveness, the father welcomes him home– not as servant, but as beloved son. His Dayenu song might have sounded like this:\n\nIt would have been enough had you allowed me to come home and not run down the lane with outstretched arms…it would have been enough had you run down the lane with outstretched arms and not thrown them around me… it would have been enough had you thrown your arms around me and not given me a robe and a ring… it would have been enough had you given me a robe and ring and not thrown me a party… it would have been enough had you thrown me a party and not killed the fatted calf…\n\nBut the elder brother who always did right by his dad… the one who worked hard for him and never left home – when his younger brother comes home and he sees this extravagant welcome for him — the elder brother song sounds more like this: Isn’t it enough that he shamed our family? Isn’t it enough that he wasted his life? Hasn’t he hurt us enough? He doesn’t even want to come into his brother’s party because… well because there was never a party thrown for him – and how unfair is that? And his father turns to him and says: All that I have is yours. And – not just yours – all that I have is his too.\n\nLearning to trust that God’s generosity extends to me and to you and to him and to her and to them day after day with blessings sufficient for each — day after day — it’s a process… one that didn’t come easily for the Israelites — because that’s definitely not how it worked under Pharaoh. The wilderness was their classroom and the people of God learned together.\n\nImagine throwing back the tent flap that first manna morning and seeing the ground covered with what is it? That’s your bread! Go out and collect just what you need, says Moses – and for those who need more specific instructions – that means an omer for each one of you. What’s an omer you ask? 1/10 of an ephah.\n\nSo what do you imagine they do? They’re hangry – hungry and angry. So do they go out and calmly collect an omer for each person in their tent? On day one of this new program?\n\nNo – some collect more and some collect less – and all the while they’re looking at each other while they gather – some fearfully collecting small handfuls while others greedily shove armfuls of the stuff into their satchels.\n\nThey’re used to Pharaoh… used to fighting and hoarding and distrusting their neighbor and doing what they have to do to feed their families and take care of their own.\n\nAnd the weaker among them hang back in the shadows picking up leftovers. The slower and more feeble ones– accustomed to being overlooked and left behind – not expecting to get their fair share.\n\nBut this is God’s economy now. And at the end of the day there is a great leveling and he who gathered much had no excess and he who gathered little had no deficiency. They each had what was right – they each had enough.\n\nI don’t know how that happened. Maybe it was supernatural… maybe their amounts were miraculously adjusted. Or maybe they began to realize they were part of a community and as they looked around at one another they saw the impact of their choices – that their over estimations left another in want – and while waiting in line to be measured, they willingly and humbly turned toward their neighbor with less and offered out of their abundance. Maybe there was a realization that they all faced the same wilderness and they all needed the same help and they all relied upon the same God. And they learned to share – that each may have enough.\n\nBy the way, An omer is nearly 9 cups per person of manna a day. That’s actually quite substantial. Compare that to the recipes listed for the annual Unicef “live below the poverty line” campaign where they challenge people to live for 5 days like the 1.2 Billion people in the poorest parts of the world who live on $1.50 per day.\n\nStir fried brown rice with 4 cups of rice, onion, cabbage and a leek is $1.10 and serves 2. A two egg omelet with spinach is $.86 and pancakes made with a cup of self-rising flour is $.46 per serving.\n\n9 cups of manna per person – with a quail too – sounds like a feast.\n\nAdmittedly, it’s a lot easier to see how one person’s choices affect another in a close community like the Israelites – much harder in a global economy. In 2014 Oxfam, the leading anti-poverty charity reported that the world’s 85 richest people own as much as the 3.5 billion poorest people in the world. And in 2017, they reported that 8 men own the same wealth as 3.6 billion people – half the world.\n\nTheir report, released in January, entitled: ‘An economy for the 99 percent’, shows that the gap between rich and poor is far greater than had been feared.\n\nIt details how big business and the supe"
