Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com: Look under Patterson-Magill-Daugherty Pedigree.5. Michael Dougherty was a Storekeeper of \"Newlondon Derry\", Chester County, Pennsylvania when the family first started their westward movement c1737/1738. Note The Michael Daugherty information that is entered into Broderbund World Family Tree 048, Tree Number: 0230 is incorrect and in error because it lists Michael Mor Dougherty's father as being Sir Cahir Dougherty, and his mother as \"Lady Cahir\". Sir Cahir did not have any children, nor had he ever been married, when the British killed him in 1608, however, his brother Sean (John) did carry on the name and did have children, so any Dougherty / Daugherty related to Michael Mor Dougherty - I should be able to trace his roots back to the immediate family of Sean O'Dochartaigh, brother of Sir Cahir O'Dochartaigh from . Note: Several American Doherty/Daugherty genealogists give Sir Cahir O'Dochartaight as our Irish ancestor. However, Sir Cahir was killed by the British at the in 1608 at the age of 21 without any heirs. His brother John (Sean) carried on the lineage. Additionally, after Sir Cahir was killed by the British he was beheaded and his head was on display on a pole outside Derry Castle for two centuries. The immediate family of Sir Cahir for the most part moved to Spain where their descendants live now. In fact the Spanish O'Dochartaign's are some of the closes O'Dochartaigh's in linage to Sir Cahir O'Dochartaigh.6. Michael Mor Daugherty-I (Liam O\"Dougherty, #2) was born circa 1690? at Lagan Valley, Donegal, Ireland. He married Catherine Rodgers circa 1712? He died in October/November 1763 at Augusta County, Virginia at aged more than 61. Michael was the catalyst that held the family together prior to and upon their arrival in America on 10 December, 1727 until his death in 1763. To Michael we (the family) own much of our inherent traits, i.e., sense of fairness, willingness to work 8 hours for 8 hours pay, stubbornness, sincerity, respect of womenhood, willingness to keep a promise regardless the circumstances, and love of country and freedom that America gives.7. Reference: DOUGHERTY, CALDWELL AND RODGERS FAMILIES OF KENTUCKY: \"On the day that King George II was proclaimed in New Castle, Delaware, December 10, 1727, there arrived from the Province of Ulster, Ireland a group of emigrants who were to furnish many of the early settlers of Kentucky. In that year began the heavier stream of emigration from Northern Ireland that was to dot Pennsylvania, Virginia and Kentucky with family names and place names reminiscent of Donegal, Loudonderry and Antrim. The Dochartachs had been seated in Inishowen, County Donegal, for centuries and the Caldwell name had been familiar in Presbyterian annals of Ulster in the seventeenth century.8. Setting foot on American soil that December day were John Caldwell, his wife Margaret nee Phillips; Thomas Dougherty and his wife, Margaret's sister, Anne nee Phillips Dougherty; and three of Caldwell's brother-in-law's who had married sisters, Moor, Ritchey and Dudgeon. With them, or soon after came at least one brother of Caldwell and perhaps one or more brothers of Thomas Dougherty, Michael Mor Dougherty-I (a Store Keeper) and his wife Catherine nee Rodgers Dougherty. \" In March, 1754 a court suit was brought against Michael Dougherty of the township of New Londonderry, Chester County, Pennsylvania, storekeeper by a Unknown Neill. It is believed that this law suit was never setteled and is still on the books as an active suit to present date. The group became established at Chestnut level, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, which until 1729 was a part of Chester County, Pennsylvania. The first mention of a Caldwell in Lancaster County records was on May 7, 1734, when William, believed to be the brother to John Caldwell, was on a jury with John Cunningham and others. John Caldwell was one of the viewers of a road to James Buckley's mill from Chestnut Level on February 3, 1736. On February 7, 1838, Thomas Dougherty was involved in a dispute with George Middleton, John Finley and several others. The case was continued that day and, oddly enough, is still on the books of Lancaster County, there never having been any disposition of the affair. It seems a fair assumption that this marks the approximate date of Thomas Dougherty's departure for Albermarle County, Virginia, where he next is found with John Caldwell, prior to their moving to what is now Charlotte County, Virginia, to establish the famous Cub Creek Presbyterian settlement.9. The jury list for that day, February 7, is interesting to students of the movement of emigration up the Valley of Virginia and into Kentucky. It included John Caldwell, John Stewart, Thomas Harris, James Patton, John Patton, probably not the Colonel James Patton of Augusta County, Thomas Paxton, Robert Jackson, James Robeson, Joseph and Samuel Crockett and Robert and Hugh Boyd. In the same period may be found Alexander Miller, the McConnell s soon to move toward the Ohio River, the Stephenson s, Logans and Morgan Morgan. James Dougherty is mentioned in 1748 in connection with the McConnell s; whether this is a brother of Thomas Dougherty is not certain, although James does not appear as early in Southern Virginia as does Thomas, and Alexander McConnell did not enter land there until some time after Thomas Dougherty and John Caldwell were established on Cub Creek, Albemarle County, Virginia. Many of the early records of Albemarle County were destroyed by the British so that gaps exist in the chronology of the movements of the Caldwell s and Dougherty's between 1738 and 1741, the approximate date of the establishment of Cub Creek settlement. Thomas Dougherty was granted land on Moreman's River, adjoining Major Henry, in 1743, but since patents generally were issued years after land had been entered and occupied, it is reasonable to suppose that Thomas was in Albermarle County about 1738. Dougherty's first land patent on Turnip Creek, adjoining, Cub Creek, is dated November 12, 1753, but other records indicate he was there much earlier, as was Caldwell and his other kin. Perhaps a relative, ( Hugh Dougherty believed to be a brother to Michael Mor Dougherty-I) was granted land in Albermarle on August 5, 1737; after the death of his son Michael in 1766, Hugh moved to Bedford County, Virginia. Michael Mor Dougherty-I, his wife Catherine nee Rodgers Dougherty and their three son's: William Dougherty-I(his wife Elizabeth nee Bunch Dougherty was already in Pennsylvania and was believed to have been a full blooded Cherokee Indian whom William married upon his arrival in Pennsylvania?); Michael Mor Dougherty-II and his wife Mary nee Clarke Dougherty both born in ; and Charles Dougherty and his wife Rebecca nee Cunningham Dougherty were among a group of immigrants from Valley Lagan, who landed at New Castle, New Castle County, Delaware on 10 December, 1727. Among the immigrants were several other members of Michael Mor's family, notably at least three of his brothers: a Hugh Dougherty (referenced above), a Cornelius Dougherty and a Thomas Dougherty (also referenced above). No mention is made of any daughters of Michael and Catherine, but there very well could have been, as in the early to late 1700's it was customary to have large extended families. As the above record indicates the families that were related usually travelled as a group such as the Dougherty's, Cauldwell's, Phillip's and Cunningham's did to America.10. Michael Mor and his family and the Caldwell family very shortly after arriving in New Castle County Delaware migrated on to Chestnut Level, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania where they established the Chestnut Level Presbyterian Church (References: The Cunningham s of Cub Creek, by John Goodwin Herndon, Haverford, Pennsylvania, page 1 and also Cub Creek and Congregation, 1738-1838, page 93 by Elizabeth Venable Gaines). For the most part the family remained there until 25 January 1737/1738 when they migrated from Chestnut Level, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania to Borden's Great Grant in what is now Rockbridge County, Virginia at the headwaters of Cedar and Mill and Broad Creeks of the James River. (reference for the above information can be found in \"THE DOUGHERTYS OF KENTUCKY by William C. Stewart, page 233\"). Note: On page 244 under notes; \"Note Number 6: Court Judgement, File 393, Augusta County, Virginia: & surveyor's book 1, page 5 & deed Book number 104, et sec. \" The Dougherty family had started westward shortly after January 25, 1737/1738, when Michael Dougherty (I), storekeeper of \"Newlondon Derry\", Chester Country, Pennsylvania, established himself in Bordon's Great Grant in what is now Rockbridge County, Virginia at the headwaters of Cedar and Mill and Broad Creeks of the James River\". Mill Creek is a branch of Poague's Run, and Michael's neighbors included Robert Poage, Erwin Patterson, John Maxwell, George Wilson, James McGavock, James Gilmore, James Crow, James Spratt, Robert McAfee, the Thompson's, Salling's, Walkers, McDowell s and others who were to be represented in the migrations from Virginia up the valleys into Kentucky. Another reason for mentioning the above families is that they will reappear in the family history of the Daugherty's later on, either through business, or marriage within the families. Michael was in Captain John Buchanan's Augusta County, Virginia militia company, listed for the first time as O'Doherty, in 1742 (Reference: F. B. Kegley, Virginia Frontier, page 141). He was appointed constable in 1747 at Augusta County, Virginia and through the 1740's and 1750's he, and his three sons, continued to accumulate land in the Forks of the James River. In the year of 1750 (19th May, 1750) Michael Dougherty was on the grand Jury for Augusta County, Virginia. One of the cases he decided was where the jury decided that at the house of James Greenlee, James River, before John Mathews, on body of Edward Hogan, late of this county. Found that he was drowned accidentally by the oversetting of a canoe now as he was crossing over James River, near the house of James Greenlee, on 13th May, 1750. Sitting on the Inquest was James Montgomery, Michael Dougherty, John Hitchins, John Ramsey, Josiah R. Hendon, John Vance, John Poage, Samuel Walker, Joseph Walker, John Mathews, Jr., Joshua Mathews, and Mathew Vance. Augusta County, Virginia Court Records, Page 69, 8th May, 1754 the records state: \"Philip Chittam's inventory, by John Maxwell, Samuel Walker, Michael Dougherty. Note--(Spinning wheel in nearly all inventories). In Court Records for 5th April, 1755 Augusta County, Virginia, page 111 it states: \"John Sprout (Sproul?) appraisement, by John McAswell, Michael Dougherty\". In court records for Augusta County, Virginia on page 280 in the year 1760 possession by Joshua Mathews and John Armstrong, in Capt. John Maxwell's company: among the men recruited into the Revolutionary Militia was one Michael Dougherty aged at the time more that 57 years old.11. Incursions by the Indians in Augusta County, Virginia during this time frame were not uncommon. Three of the Daugherty boys are listed in the militia in 1758 and Michael was paid by the militia for furnishing provisions to the militia. One of Michaels's son's; Charles , was killed on 17 July, 1763 by an Indian raid by the Shawnee Chief Cornstalk and that same year Michael Mor Daugherty-I died at more than the age of 61. Augusta County, Virginia Court Records 16th November, 1763, page 303 the records state: \"Michael Daugherty's appraisement (by Joseph Culton, Hohn McKee, Hohn Gilmore, William Edmondson). Recorded--Cash due by William Christy.\" During this Indian raid mentioned above William Daugherty-I's wife Elizabeth nee Bunch Daugherty became somewhat of a heroine by riding down the valley (William Daugherty-I was not at home when the alarm was given) and warning all the settlers about the approaching Indians. The settlers then fled to the mountains and were saved from the wrath of the Indian As stated above: Michael died in the same year (1763) that his son Charles was killed by Cornstalk and is buried at Rockbridge, Augusta County, Virginia. Michaels estate was appraised November 16, 1763 by Joseph Culton, John McKee, John Gilmore and William Edmonston. Following Michael's death the family started to break up and move to different locations both South and West into the wilderness. It is safe to assume that Michael Mor Dougherty-I and his wife Catherine nee Rodgers Dougherty were the fore bearers of the large and interesting Dougherty / Daugherty family that is a part of this document. Additionally, throughout the Dougherty/Daugherty family tree there are other family members that came from at the same time as Michael and his wife Catherine: notably three of Michael's brothers, Hugh Dougherty and his unknown wife, Cornelius Dougherty and his unknown spouse and Thomas Dougherty, Sr. and his wife Ann nee Phillips Dougherty. Additionally, further research into the fore bearers of Michael Mor Dougherty-I in Ireland could probably lead to the fact that he was related to Sean (John) O'Dochartaigh (brother of Sir Cahir O'Dochartaigh who was killed by the British in 1608 and all his lands in Lagan Valley, was divided among the British at Londonderry at the time). Sean (John) O'Dochartaigh carried on the family name of O'Dochartaigh because when Sir Cahir his brother was killed he was not married, was but 21 years of age and had no children. As history will later attest to the descendants of Sean O'Dochartaigh mainly the Dougherty/Daugherty Clann had a direct hand in the establishment, exploration, defense and settlement of the United States of America. 12.

At the time Daugherty carried on his fur trade, the trail from Richmond, Virginia, passed through the section about Danville and then joined the Saura-Saponi route which was being extensively used. The western fork of this trail served as a convenient connection twith the Occonee path which followed the course of the upper Yadkin to its source thence crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Watauga river, and along that stream to the Holston, then down the latter river to the Cherokee capital.

This lucrative business spread rapidly to Indians living further away until it has crossed South Carolina, passed over the Appalachians and even reached the tributary streams of the Mississippi River and even, at last, the great waterway itself. It reached the Cherokees at an early date. in 1684, when the whites had been in South Caroline only fourteen years the government at Charles Town entered in to a written treaty with chiefs of the Lower Cherokees. Soon Cherokees beyond the Appalachians were brought into these commercial relations. Footnotes 53_ W. W.

He resided on the Little Tennessee River and spent there the remainder of his life, leaving Indian descendants, some of whom \"still occupy honored positions in the tribe.

(1) Cornelius Dougherty, the oldest trader amoung the Cherokees, whose trading-house stood inthe town of Tugaloo as late as 1755, anticipated, if the winter of that year was butr tolerably favorable for hunting, collecting from his district alone in the nation 14,000 of buckskin leathers. Three years before the entire nation had been mapped off into thirteen hunting ranges or districts and a trader appointed to every one. Estimating these, says Logan, at but two-thirds of what Dougherty expected gathering, the production of the entifre Cherokee country would be more than 100,000 pounds of buckskin leather besides the abundant supply of skins of other wild animals. The average weight of deerskins is four pounds to the skin, there being little difference in the weight, dry or raw. Dougherty expected, therefore, observes Logan, the hunters in the Tugaloo range to bring down with their rifles 3500 deer, making for the whole nation about 25,000 annually.

Cornstalk was a Shawnee Chief, diplomat who lead raids in to the Greenbrier Valley area of West Virginia. He was the commander and chief of the combined Indian forces at the Battle of Point Pleasant. Sources: Willliam C. Stewart \"The Dougherty's of Kentucky\". Charles Dougherty was one of three son's of Michael Mor Dougherty-I and Catherine Rodgers Dougherty, both of Lagan Valley,. Charles and his wife Rebecca Cunningham Daugherty from Valley Lagan, all traveled to New Castle County, Delaware arriving on 10 December, 1728. Charles had two brothers, Michael Dougherty-II and William Dougherty. All three son's were also born in Ireland and accompanied their parents to America landing at New Castle County, Delaware on 10 December, 1728.From New Castle the family immediately moved to Newlondon Derry, Chester County Pennsylvania and stayed there until circa 1738 when they moved to \"Borden's Great Grant in what is now Rockbridge County, Virginia but at the time the family moved it was in Augusta County, Virginia. Accompanying the Michael Mor Dougherty-I family to America were several brothers to Michael Mor Dougherty-I along with a host of in-laws: A brother Hugh Dougherty who moved to Augusta County, Virginia shortly after landing at New Castle, Delaware and along with a John Caldwell helped to establish the Cub Creek Presbyterian community in Augusta County, Virginia; Another brother on the trip was a Cornelius Dougherty and a third brother on the trip was named John Doughert. Reference: ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR, By Charles E. Kemper it states: \"17. C. Daugherty vs. John Frazier. \"Not executed by reason of the Indians.\" 3d Wednesday in November, p.53. additionally, 19. John Harvie vs. John Daugherty. \"Not executed by reason of the e nemy Indians.\" 3d Wednesday in May, 1758, p. 66. The Daugherty family lived on the James River in present Rockbridge Co. Va., on Mill Creek. Survey book, No. 1, p.4.\" Charles Daugherty and his family as previously stated moved to Augusta County, Virginia, at that point in time, Augusta County, Virginia covered all of western Virginia and almost all of Kentucky and Tennessee, however, at a later date the county would be divided up and other counties and states formed from the original Augusta County.Charles Dougherty was killed in an Indian raid by a Shawnee Indian Chief named Cornstalk on 17 July, 1763. The 17th July, 1763 was a Sunday and Charles's family was all away from home attending the Timber Ridge Church with the serm on and services were conducted by the Reverand John Brown. During the church intermission between the morning and evening sermons some alarm was given, but such reports were frequently started without foundation, and therefore not much attention was paid to the alarm. At any rate Charles Daugherty was killed and scalped by the Indians and his father Michael Mor Dougherty-I also died in the same year 1763 at an age of more than 61 years old. The Indian raid that Charles was killed in was the same one that Charles's brothers wife Elizabeth Bunch Dougherty rode a horse down the valley warning all the settlers that the Indians were coming and to hid in the mountains. Charles lived further down the Valley and never heard the warning. Annals of Augusta County: On page 172 of the Annals it is stated that the following happened: \"Leaving the site of old Millborough, the savages passed over Mill Mountain at a low place still called the \"Indian Trail.\" Coming on the waters of Bratton's Run, they crossed the North mountain, where it is now crossed by the road leading from Lexington to the Rockbridge Alum Springs, and where there is a large heap of stones, supposed to have been piled up by Indians. From this point they had a full view of the peaceful valley of Kerr's Creek. Hastening down the mountain, they began the work of indiscriminate slaughter. Coming first to the house of Charles Daugherty, he and his whole family were murdered. Note: His story later refutes that Charles and his entire family were murdered and scalped. History indicates that Charles's wife Rebecca is recorded in history following the death of Charles. They next came to the house of Jacob Cunningham, who was from home, but his wife was killed, and his daughter, about ten years of age, scalped and left for dead. She revived, was carried off as a prisoner in the second invasion, was redeemed, and lived for forty years afterwards, but finally died from the effects of the scalping\". The annals goes on to name and give details about the different families that were murdered or captured. The truth of Charles Daugherty is that he was home and his family was away at church and only he was killed. His wife Rebecca nee Daugherty and family were later documented in the will of Charles and Rebecca was named as Administrator so she and the children could not have been killed by the Indians as the Annals state. Charles and Rebecca nee Cunningham Dougherty are known to have had at least 12 children: Catherine Daugherty, Cornelius Daugherty, George Daugherty, Sr., Anthony Daugherty, James Daugherty, William Daugherty, Sr., Thomas Daugherty, Daniel Daugherty, David M. Daugherty, Henry Daugherty, Rebecca Daugherty, and Hugh Daugherty. There may have been more children butthis is all the historical documents mention? As a person can readily see it was this time frame that the DOUGHERTY family started to spell Thier names as DAUGHERTY, and depending on location and the ability of the person to read and write the name was spelled in all variations besides just Daugherty and Dougherty. Any way the name was spelled most were related to the original Dougherty's from Valley Lagan, County Donegal Ireland. Even the Dougherty's who immigrated to America during the great potato famine came from County Donegal and were also probably related in some form or another to the Dougherty's who arrived on the 10th December, 1728. Sources William C. Stewart \"The Doughertys of Kentucky\" Liam (Oge)'s son Michael (Mor) and his family immigrated to America in 1727, probably with the large Caldwell settlement to New Castle, DE. Joseph Caldwell was the Daughertys' Presbyterian landlord who immigrated because of the English crown's persecution of non-Anglicans, both Protestant and Catholic.With his brothers and brothers-in-law (including a Dougherty), and others they sailed from the port of Londonderry. After landing in Delaware, the group moved through Pennsylvania and south to Virginia, where many of them formed a Caldwell settlement near Charlotte. Another of the families was Patton, which we see in frequent contact with the Daughertys, Magills, and Pattersons in Augusta Co., VA. By 1735 Michael (Mor) Dochartaigh/Doherty/Daugherty was a storekeeper in Newlondon Derry, Chester Co., PA. Abt 25 Jan 1737/8 he and his wife and sons moved with the colony southwest to Augusta Co., VA, settling on Borden's Great Grant in what later became Rockbridge Co. (There may have been daughters we don't know about). William Daugherty (called \"Sam\" by the Cherokee) was one of the first Indian agents for the colony of Virginia; he married Elizabeth Bunch, a Cherokee. Michael (Oge) Daugherty married Mary Clark. Charles Daugherty married Rebecca Cunningham whose family came from Ireland with the same colony. Charles, our ancestor, was killed 17 Jul 1763 by Cornstalk's Shawnee raiding party on Kerr Creek; his family was spared by being at church. William's wife Elizabeth was a heroine, riding up the valley to warn other settlers. After those attacks, William and Elizabeth moved further south. William and Michael (Oge) died in Montgomery Co., VA. Many of the children and grandchildren of Michael (Mor) Daugherty were pioneer settlers in Lincoln Co., KY, starting in 1775. The O'Dochartaigh Clan Hq. & Research Center was established on Inch Island at least 15 years ago but is now on the seaside at Buncrana. NOTE: \"Mor\" means Senior, and \"Oge\" means Junior.\n\nMisc Note - The O’Dohertys were the Gaelic rulers of Inishowen and the remains of many of their fortifications are scattered throughout the peninsula. Burt Castle was a 16th-century fortress of the O’Doherty clan, one of four guarding the south-west approaches to Inishowen, and in its day was a place of great strategic importance. Further on at Inch Island is Inch Castle, built in the early part of the 15th century and another stronghold of the once powerful O’Dohertys. Both Burt and Inch castles fell into the hands of the English after the failure of Sir Cahir O’Doherty’s short-lived rebellion in 1608. The walls are built of rough rubble and the keep is three storeys. There are two circular watch towers which offer superb views of the surrounding countryside. They both have openings for muskets. The original walls and outer defenses are no longer visible -------------- Liam O'DOUGHERTY Sex: M Birth: 1605 in Isle of Barth (Burt), Co.

Author: Inishowen Genealogy, Compiler: Patrick Dougherty Publication: Oct 2003 -------- Pioneer Irish in New England CHAPTER XVII page 265 We find Irishmen among the colonial merchants and traders. Cornelius Dougherty, an Indian trader from Virginia, was the first white man known to have penetrated the territory now embraced in the State of Kentucky (1690). John Anderson, the Irishman from Dublin, or, as the Dutch expressed it, Jan Andriessen, de Iersman van Dublingh, traded with the Indians on the Hudson River between 1649 and 1657, and Thomas Lewis, usually referred to in the Dutch records as Thomas, the Irishman, also traded with the Indians on the Hudson River in 1662. Thomas Lynch and Anthony Duane, both from Galway, Ireland, appear in New York records of the late years of the seventeenth century as prominently as any of the Dutch or English merchants of their time. Among merchants and landowners in New York, 1674-1677, we find William Walsh and Hugh ONeil; and Dr. William Hayes from Barrys Court, Ireland, is mentioned by OCallaghan as the physician who attended to the ills of the Dutch and English residents of New Amsterdam in the year 1647. William Hogan, van Bor in Ierlandt in de Kings County, i.e., William Hogan, who was born in Birr, in Kings (now Offaly) County, Ireland, was a merchant in Albany in 1680. The Newlins from Mountmellick, Ireland, who came in the Welcome with William Penn in 1682, were active business men in Philadelphia. Dennis Rochford from Wexford, who also came in the Welcome, was a man of much prominence in Philadelphia, and in 1683 he was a member of the First Provincial Council of the Province of Pennsylvania. Few of these receive any mention in the historical works that are read by the general public; their racial identity became submerged with the English, and consequently, they are almost unknown to the American people.\n\n1704 Virginia Quit Rent Rolls - Partial List - 1704 Accomac County, Virginia\n\nAlexander Richards\n\nAntho.
