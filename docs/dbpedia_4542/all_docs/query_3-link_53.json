Poachers are trapping dinosaurs for the black market again. Another scandal like this could kill her research if it comes out, and Grace’s boss wants her to look the other way until the thieves are gone. But Grace can’t bring herself to let the criminals get away. When the poachers discover Grace’s plans to blow the whistle, they attack her research station. Nakamura and Grace flee into the forest with her time machine, but it’s broken in the process. Nakamura knows a secret cache where they can hopefully fix the time machine, but it means a perilous trek through the wilderness. Braving prehistoric dangers together shows Grace she can trust Nakamura with her life, but she’s still not sure she can ever trust him with her heart.

The fact that the Vrika apparently chose the absolute worst partner for me only proves that the fated mate bond is all kinds of messed up. Gahn Errok is the epitome of arrogance. He’s brash, ungrateful, offensive, and possibly the most dramatic man I’ve ever met in my life, human or alien. He swept into our Sea Sand settlement expecting I’d fall at his feet and go back to his mountains as his obedient little wife. Well, I am going to the mountains, but only to help with the human mission there. I am definitely not going because of him. Even if he annoyingly insists that one day I’ll love him as much as he loves me. Alright, Gahn Errok. I’ll take that bet. Because you are the last male on this planet, no, in this universe, I would ever want to be with.

Finally, I will have the love I’ve craved. Only I meet my beloved in the dust and the sand and she…Does not seem to want me. Which makes no sense. Any woman would rejoice at the chance to be my mate! But, strangely, Zuh-Tephanie does not rejoice. In fact, she glares at me as if hoping I’ll fall off the edge of a cliff. Well, too bad for her that I am too clever to fall off a cliff. I am strong. I am worthy. I will win her. I just…Have to figure out how.
