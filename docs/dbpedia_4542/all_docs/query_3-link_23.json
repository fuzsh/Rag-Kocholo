Introduction by Elizabeth Alexander, Harryette Mullen, and the Editors. (University of Michigan Press, 2006)\n\nExplanatory Preface material:\n\nCave Canem is a nonprofit organization for African American poets founded in 1996 by Toi Derricotte and Cornelius Eady. Each summer fifty-two poets (about seventeen new poets a year, with the remainder returning for their second or third summers) take part in a one-week workshop / retreat. Over the past ten year over two hundred poets have gone through Cave Canem’s summer program. Since they return to the workshop / retreat for three years during a five-year period, Cave Canem poets have built a network of connections and support that lasts well beyond the workshop week in June.\n\nMeaning, presumably, that a poet who returned for three years would meet eighty and somebody-odd poets. The contributors here number roughly one hundred and twenty or so—more than half of the participants.\n\nContributors: M. Eliza Hamilton Abegunde, Opal Palmer Adisa, Elizabeth Alexander, Lauren K.

Not a cento—no dismally mechanistic dispersal of others’ work into some whiteboy notion of “multivocality”—that tenor gets voiced without my assistance. (Every African-American in the country grows up learning—at least—two distinct languages, is what I wager.) A few lines out of each piece, grabbed without prejudice, that is, no fore-notion or slant towards the “typical” or the “atypical” either. The selections follow the alphabetical list of contributors (above). (There is something like a crazy democracy at work in assigning each writer one poem: guarantee that nobody’ll be adequately represented. A riff offering a few lines out of each and every poem is, I suppose, a logical, if plod-prone, extension of that. Snapshot of a snapshot.)\n\nMy own mother passed this gift to me: the ability to simultaneously\n\nlose my country, my self, my secure knowledge that I\n\nowned the world.\n\n—\n\ni would do it again\n\nwork my way\n\nthrough the hatred\n\n—\n\nIn the early nineteen-eighties, the black men\n\nwere divine, spoke French, had read everything\n\n—\n\nskin like blood like wine like war binding tight the white flesh, the black pits\n\npressed into the narrow center sleeping like sin like sex\n\n—\n\na blueblack star marked my birth\n\na razor blade cut my course\n\na razor blade cut my course\n\n—\n\nI ain’t got to whine to let him know his place.\n\nI’d be starving if I ate all the lies they fed.\n\n—\n\nI remember like it was last Tuesday:\n\nour mutual parting of the ways come\n\non account of a can of 10W40\n\n—\n\nelbow-high gloves gargantuan on the slender arms,\n\nhead tilted like a sunflower, legs spread,\n\nand the sharp sucking against the teeth—\n\n—\n\nThe landlord told Raymond’s mother that twelve dollars\n\nwould be deducted from their rent for every rat killed.\n\n—\n\nIn the wake of my fifth bite\n\nof pear, two women, a visiting cousin\n\nand Marse’s new wife, were killed.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday—pot roast and hotwater cornbread,\n\nthe cornmeal sifted as fine as loose road dust\n\nlifting to settle on trousers and lace socks.\n\n—\n\nwe’d say Wow to the crushed-can collector,\n\nyeah, that funked-out guy we down with—\n\nhe one street off from cool now\n\n—\n\nOn Saturdays twicedamonth after a breakfast of pancakes and sahshees we went to visit the sick and shut-in or the well and shut-out (of a right mind).\n\n—\n\nTime is your\n\nhard breath\n\nin the field.\n\n—\n\nGrandmother breaks to wring and squeeze the purification towel free of water, soap, and a bricklike, muddy dirt. Child, all that noise ain’t necessary. If you could see this nastiness, you’d be thanking me.\n\n—\n\nwe dark still living\n\nwho crawled or\n\nwere dragged\n\nhair matted flat\n\n—\n\nIn angry mists, you see them, round hands\n\nreaching, beckoning their beloveds.\n\nToday, the sun burns through marine-white air\n\n—\n\nShe wants sounds pinioned,\n\nmelodic as high-voiced\n\ncanaries carousing, half-\n\nsinging\n\n—\n\n“the trees wave their knotted branches\n\nand . . .” why\n\nis there under that poem always\n\nan other poem?\n\n—\n\nand we fight over your\n\nfoolishness thinking love\n\ncan come in a redbone\n\n—\n\nand she went to work manufacturing lines of general foods\n\nwhere she punched time until they forced her to retire\n\nand in giving up work she opened her backyard bar\n\n—\n\nWe had lookouts\n\nin the alleys and the tall kids jumped the fence and the runners ran\n\nwith the bags. Peaches were easy. In the graveyard we had no trouble\n\ngetting peaches from the dead.\n\n—\n\nthe pulp of your carved initials\n\nmade with the solid grasp\n\nof a still-forming hand\n\n—\n\nMy arm, the arm\n\nof all our fishing generations,\n\nwho knew land could be sold\n\nfrom under you.\n\n—\n\nHell, round them all up—in minutes\n\nwe’ll be standing knee deep in\n\nthe unselected poems of black literature.\n\n—\n\nComfort is helping him pee, or lifting him\n\nonto the toilet, waiting, wiping after his bowels\n\nstir reluctantly.\n\n—\n\nAcross the ocean and decades\n\nbefore, two boys called each other\n\nin Crioulo.\n\n—\n\nGangly man, skin like red dirt,\n\nyou have let rip,\n\na streak of living\n\nacross these here United States.\n\n—\n\nSays she’s seen my kind and knows me well:\n\nSeditty. Too stiff to get down.\n\n—\n\nhe would load mustard on a saltine, lay a little\n\nfish on top, & tip it with a juicy slice\n\nof onion.\n\n—\n\nIf he turns his sax upside-down\n\nit curves like a question mark.\n\nWhat is a true measure of music?\n\n—\n\nsip of— jet mighty joe young overgrown\n\ndeep plum baby daddy DMX\n\n—\n\ncrawling back to you naked over porcupines\n\nselling my qualms and other precious possessions\n\ngiving you all the proceeds\n\n—\n\nCan’t say as I blame Miss Amy her grip on the house. Heaven knows, her husband’s a first-rate\n\nscoundrel, and a groggy fool to boot, Master Jackson was in amongst the ’taters with that servant\n\ngirl name of Lena.\n\n—\n\nA deal with the devil\n\nIn blues terms, the tongue we use\n\nWhen we don’t want nuance\n\nTo get in the way\n\n—\n\nThe easy way out is, I am nothing.\n\nI have nothing, so I collect things.\n\n—\n\nBlue jays caucused in leaves, vowing to conquer\n\nberry fields as water rehearsed its verses.\n\n—\n\nOver dinner my mother talked stories\n\nof her father stringing hogs\n\nfor November slaughter as segue\n\nto discussing black family mobility\n\n—\n\nThe idolized air\n\nonce loosed\n\nis never free.\n\n—\n\njust one-day’s walk and this sumac and sagebrush church\n\ncould be worshipped hard in Latin under the most wild sky\n\n—\n\nin glyph, the mind of percival everett’s baby ralph asks, “is a photograph always present\n\ntense?” as in here I am!\n\n—\n\nthe few black boys here circle white girls\n\nwho sprout from these backroads, smell\n\nof hairspray and floral alcohol of drugstore perfume\n\n—\n\nat once to be sly and unsly, no so\n\nunlike those terrible dancehall bodies\n\n—\n\nI know the scratch of bark between my legs,\n\nthe dogwood’s smooth deception. Their guilt-stained\n\nflowers ushered winter, the smell of death\n\n—\n\nSong like marble spun\n\ninto silk. The human\n\nloom.\n\n—\n\nOr teach us the phonics of bulleted speech no\n\nBlueprint would show how to build a new brick\n\nTo stitch a new tower from us to the voice all\n\n—\n\nHand on hip, I stood defiant.\n\nHow far could a broomswept\n\nHead go anyway?\n\n—\n\nisn’t there a word\n\nfor yellow-husk morning\n\nof coke-eyed soldiers\n\n—\n\nprep. 1. origin or cause: Aaron begets Helen, Laura, Ermine, Christine, Inez, Beulah, and Sonny. Sonny, he died of female complications. 2. material or substance: the house was built of bricks\n\n—\n\nyet Mingus caught Pres’s stride in ballads\n\neasing of the glottals his very song eclipsed\n\nin the high registers down low in Kansas City\n\n—\n\nNow and again a hoopty livery cab would chuckle along, rolling its heavy engine: Goodie-bye, it would say like mythical Ibo flying away\n\n—\n\nThey say . . . well, they say nothing about you, Mr. DogEared,\n\nbecause you disappeared. Side rocking and silly toed,\n\nVanish man across the sideways bricks of buildings, hesitant.\n\n—\n\nBoxed-in from birth by the Boogie-Down,\n\n“freedom” what could be taken in the streets,\n\nfrom a bottle or a blunt.\n\n—\n\nI stumble in the memory\n\nof Ohio, old names and faces\n\ngiven me: Pecola, Dorcas,\n\nViolet, Nel, First Corinthians.\n\n—\n\nI was to be taken somewhere and given a name\n\nMore bona fide and afflicted, I was to be shot\n\n—\n\nMy name is Lovely\n\nAnd I’m so\n\nPretty\n\nMy hair is long\n\nAnd yours is not.\n\n—\n\nred delicious red but red\n\nlike redeye gravy on grits\n\nat Gus’s or red like stoplights\n\n—\n\nspills tripe and bowels\n\nlike curses, like obeah\n\ninto the killing pan\n\noily, visceral proteins smell the air\n\n—\n\nThirty years of marriage sits between them\n\nlike a bomb.\n\n—\n\nYou have to\n\nEnglish\n\nthe world to\n\nbecome its possessor.\n\n—\n\nA flick of her wrist,\n\nflap: “His eyes are on the sparrow\n\nand I know he watches me.”\n\n—\n\nBecause she was homesick for the smell\n\nof Virginia tobacco and pit-roasted hog\n\n—\n\nHannibal grasps a Roman\n\nmonkeybar on history’s rung, and the mighty heroes at recess\n\nlay dead in woe on the imagined battlefields of Halo.\n\n—\n\nYes, these predictable fifths. O, the blues\n\nis all about slinging those low tales out\n\nthe back door\n\n—\n\nleadbelly you say.\n\nkiller huh\n\nsinger huh\n\n—\n\nLong from those indifferent hours,\n\nlong from the doors of the Maison du jouir\n\nand the affected gaze of his mistresses.\n\n—\n\nsomewhere, lips print a cigarette, low tones chase\n\nsmoke from her mouth, crawl into the ear of another man\n\n—\n\nmachete is our music, pianissimo the cut. I sing into the dip between\n\nshoulder and spine. elucidate the nape. how the belly infuses the barren palm.\n\n—\n\nYou no longer question\n\nWhat kind of blue pulls a man’s skin\n\nSo tightly over the face.\n\n—\n\nI want to leave behind the icy surge,\n\nThe cold I felt some twenty year ago\n\nIn October, when coral leaves wither and fall\n\n—\n\nand she missed not a note, hunched over that microphone,\n\nsong after song sweating through her spangles\n\nlike a dockworker, as men slid to and fro in shade\n\nIn front of the box stage.\n\n—\n\nwhisky in her treble some nights\n\nmoan making a slack belt\n\nrevival hymn to salt pork fingertips\n\n—\n\nFathered by a white desire,\n\nvials, by a quarter-T,\n\na lighter, needle, spoon.\n\n—\n\nmockingbirds arrive with stolen songs\n\n& cries, their unspeakable lies & omens\n\nas if they are some minor god’s\n\nonly true instrument & broken way\n\n—\n\nShe curses loud in thick\n\npatois, then calls on Jesus, but no one looks away from the corpse\n\nlaid out in front of the rose settee.\n\n—\n\nmean got dis suit fo ya john aint nobody worn dese clothes befo\n\nwalk proud in dese clothes dese is free mans clothes\n\n—\n\nThen with the severity of knives we drew seven from the bone-yard,\n\nThe common pile of thick and heavy permutations of dice.\n\n—\n\nrocks of rejection\n\nwere thrown at her because\n\nof the yellow tone of her skin\n\nnot high yellow\n\n—\n\nhumming a respirator song\n\n“I put slight faith in his own affirmation”\n\na man is as constant as the devil on holiday\n\n—\n\ndevil chasing his wife\n\ndown the street with a stick\n\nshe trying to run with only one shoe on\n\n—\n\nReluctant yellow light ties her fawn-colored lips shut. Behind resplendent fresh her teeth are clenched, her jaw is lantern.\n\n—\n\nNobody, woman\n\nor man, knows how to handle Al Green.\n\nThat Girl from Ipanema would have\n\ndug Al.\n\n—\n\nI am the woman at the water’s edge\n\noffering you oranges for the peeling,\n\nknife glistening in the sun.\n\n—\n\nLionel Hampton\n\n“Flyin’ Home,”\n\nriffin’ on his\n\nvibraphone\n\n—\n\nneither the hustlers nor\n\nthe pharmacists peddle the elixir\n\nthat banishes the Wolf, the Butcher,\n\nthe Posse—\n\n—\n\n& sits on the floor pulling out her hair\n\none strand at a time,\n\ntrying to weave it into the carpet\n\nwith a piece of fingernail\n\n—\n\nis on her back cramming\n\nmy hand down cropped\n\ndenims.

Something a little dogged about that “mode,” typing up the material. Conversely, though, there is the way that, under such hard handling, the material exhibits soonest its durability, or, its friability. Burning hard, or coming apart in one’s hands. (The experience is even more intense in the task of job-stick typesetting for letterpress, a high-recommend to individual writers whose raillery and verbosity is fit to swamp the writing.)\n\nHarryette Mullen remarks (part of a tiny history of Cave Canem wherein she explains how Cave Canem refers to a sign at the entrance of a poet’s house noted by Derricotte and Eady whilst touring the ruins of Pompeii—a sign meaning “beware the dog”) that “As African American poets traveling in Europe, they were aware that what is called “black experience” is only a part of the life that black people actually experience. They knew that pertinent experience of black individuals and communities often goes unrecognized and unrepresented in literature, art, and popular culture. They envisioned a productive space where black poets, individually and collectively, can inspire and be inspired by others, relieved of any obligation to explain or defend their blackness.” Too, Mullen writes: “What seems to characterize the current conversation is a greater tolerance of difference, uncertainty, and even confusion in our lives and in our work as poets. We can exist as black artists without hermetic definitions of art or blackness.” Something probably apt for all writers: it’s a restless era, one tending less to pronunciamento and certainty.\n\nAnd I—whiteboy—read the collection how exactly? I see blues and blunts, and a mean sense of history, and the ornery (and ordinary) devastations and redemptions of sex. Or is that just seeing what being a whiteboy in the present historical moment taught me to see—after all, I grew up reading Piri Thomas, and Malcolm X’s Autobiography, and H. Rap Brown, and Eldridge Cleaver, and Dick Gregory, all that for just that reason: for the nitty-gritty lacking in my own liberal Midwest university town surround. Having found it (and loved it) once, am I “condemned” then to see it (and it only) forevermore? I see little form for form itself—though there are sestinas, rhyming quatrains, a pantoum, blues. I do see still (despite the expressed desire to leave blackness somehow behind), a nearly complete refusal / inability to do so. (Such is the power of representation’s past—without a determined rupture, it endlessly reproduces itself.)\n\nCave Canem mosaic, Pompeii\n\nRadio\n\nClouds\n\nBehind a steering wheel, radio tuned to WGPR—“GPR, God’s Precious Radiations” is what I think I heard one deejay say. It’s a Detroit station, terrific gospel on Sundays, and the Reverend Dr. Dre’s “radio ministry.” He’s offering up, because it is “Couple’s Day,” weekend overnights at the Marriott in Southfield—he pronounces it Souf’field. He talks about a couple he knows—he’s “fifty and somebody-odd years old” and she likewise and they all crazy like kids, the usual high-hog sermonizing. I quit listening. I’m thinking about “somebody” as an intensifier, what it does for the rhythm, throws down a little cluster of vocables to make “odd” more pronounced.\n\nLately I’m reading a lot of fiction—particularly “just” lately Daniel Woodrell’s Ozark novels, Chandler in a pickup truck—and all because I ask for no more some days than rapturous sentences. (And the “post-avant” poetry league of late suffers a want of rapturous sentences.) It’s rhythm that drives the sentence, pure and simple. Pure rhythm. (See how I double pumped that one there—for oomph and majesty.) Between the shard-masters—syntactical cut-ups and fragment-splayers, with that Tinseltown approach to the poem—and the New Sentencers (who attend more to the gaps between sentence than the sentences propres, strewing out a series of solitary clunkers in the wake of a theory-ship), they ain’t no mess of rapture to find late-ways in Poetryland, no?\n\nSo, in search of sentences: fiction with its mock-orality (I gots to hear it). Or talk, interviews (note: danger of exoticism, the novelty of the lingo “carrying” the sentence—as opposed to sheer rhythm). Exempla:\n\nJohn Lee Hooker (b. 22 August 1917):\n\nWhy that I have such a big soul when I start singin’ the blues, spirituals, anythin’, is because I was normally a spiritual singer. I reversed from spirituals to the blues and when I get that big feelin’ look like it’s somethin’ like a bombshell hit me. You know, you can turn it right around’. The spirituals and the blues is based on just about the same pattern.\n\nWay back before you and everybody else and all the peoples was born, spirituals was the thing. Nobody can reach way back and find out just when it was born, but when spirituals was born it was born on the blues side.\n\nThere’s a lot of things that give you the blues, that give me the blues, that give any man the blues: it’s somewhere down the line that you have been hurt some place. I mean it’s no certain type of hurtin’ but you have been hurt some place and you get to playin’ the blues that reaches. And so that’s why when I sing the blues I sing it with the big feelin’. I really means it.\n\nYou can hear a certain type of record be playin’. You can be feelin’ very normal, nothin’ on your mind, period. But it’s somethin’ on that record hits you. It hits somethin’ that have happened in your life, and sometime if you can’t stand to listen to the record you take a walk or take a ride or get in your car because you don’t want to be hurt so deep that it cause heartaches and things. Because you’d rather not to hear it than to hear it. Because there’s some place in them records, there’s somethin’ sad in there that give you the blues; somethin’ that reach back in your life or in some friend’s life of yours, or that make you think of what have happened today and it is so true, that if it didn’t happen to you, you still got a strong idea—you know those things is goin’ on. So this is very touchable, and that develops into the blues.\n\n(Interviewed by Paul Oliver in 1960.)\n\nWilliam H. Gass (b. 30 July 1924):\n\nHe had his hat. To rise? To doff one final time? good day, Madame—goodby—surprise— . . . to leave? He could do that. Run under it out of the rain. How many of his dreams had flight and freedom in them? Ham and eggs. Pie and cheese. Muff and sniff. She’d hear the Southern slurs of melting custard and be . . . entranced. He had his hat. He could do that. But noises he made deliberately to set her off, stomps around the room or weights he placed on the floor to make it groan, soda he shook and swallowed, screws he gave an extra turn to, fists he left printed in the air, the pounding he gave the coverlet, or conversely the squeaks he silenced with sewing machine oil, the har har hars he swaddled in socks, the lids he glued or the many things he simply removed in the trunk of their car to cast on the dump or drop in a lake or bury: none of these acts move her because, she said, under torture matter could be made to say anything. Mud, mold, matter—what one called it didn’t count—but it had neither courage, nor loyalty, nor conscience. In her husband’s police state matter would moisten its tongue for its own ass, and she didn’t believe that was right, she refused absolutely to consider it, matter alone meant nothing, a calf of slime, she said, not an object of experience, of piety or speech; it was a convenient carrier at best, a carton for cats, and so she thought of it the way typhoid must have thought of Mary, no more, not even as a necessary ambience or elevation or so much as a stand for music, pediment for a statue or tower with an aerial, though that was closer, and what was he, then, in his dense maleness, a series of surfaces like a stack of plates, what was he with his bowling and his beer and his business—charging the living for their life and paying off only when death was a winner—what was he with his busy pencil and greedy teeth, in the flesh of his flesh, but the purest muck, individuation driven to the point of indifference, asafetida not energy, sheer dumb disagreeable stuff, unworked, unrealized, raw, foolish in its lean and teeter, its oils, wows. and ouches, as an Evereadied dolly, yet with a prick which led him on his little trot though life like a leash held at the loop end in the Pope’s fist? Butterflies leave laces in the air like a courtier’s cuffs, she said. Faugh. Easy to say such, harder to prove so.\n\n“Cartesian Sonata,” out of Cartesian Sonata and Other Novellas\n\nLists are juxtapositions, and exhibit many of the qualities of collage. The names which appear on them lack their normal syntactical companions. Most lists are terse, minimal, bald; they are reminders, commands, aspirations. We do not trouble to write: one medium head of nice fresh red Boston lettuce, two large slicing tomatoes if ripe, a small bottle of Dr. Bland’s salad dressing but only if it’s in that cute chef-shaped bottle . . .\n\n“I’ve Got a Little List,” out of Tests of Time\n\n—\n\nVying amongst treetops and other earthbound debris in an attempt to photograph the skies, I think of a story a bookseller named Garvin handed along. Common breed of windbag used-book dealer, opinion-plagued, borne up astride an oceanic font of “useless and pointless knowledge.” He related how one photographer—W. Eugene Smith is who I recall—up on a house ladder for a shoot of something or other, could see exactly the angle needed for the shot, out there, in mid-air. So, with camera, he jumped, fired the shutter, got the snap, and fell, fracturing a leg in the fall.\n\nW. Eugene Smith, Country Doctor, 1948\n\nThe way fireflies seem to ascend up out of lawns at dusk, tailing light up to the still barely light-lit heavens."
