Many of the founders were officers of the Revolutionary War who received land grants for military services. Among the officers of the American Revolutionary War buried in Mound Cemetery are General Rufus Putnam, General Benjamin Tupper, Commodore Abraham Whipple, and Colonel William Stacy.\n\n“ It was stated at the Conference that “more officers of the Revolution are buried in the Old Mound Cemetery, Marietta, than at any other place in the United States.” ”\n\n— DAR, American Monthly, Vol. 16 (Jan-Jun 1900), 329.\n\nGeneral Lafayette of France, who fought with the Americans during the Revolution, visited Marietta during 1825, and described these Marietta settlers and former soldiers: \"I knew them well. I saw them fighting the battles of their country…They were the bravest of the brave. Better men never lived.\"[5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Great Mound or Conus\n\n2 American Revolutionary War soldiers\n\n3 Gallery\n\n4 See also\n\n5 References\n\n6 Bibliography\n\n7 External links\n\nGreat Mound or Conus\n\nAccording to the Washington County Historical Society:\n\nThe origin and disappearance of the prehistoric Moundbuilders has long been shrouded in mystery. “Conus” is the burial place of chieftains. The mounds and earthworks were constructed between 800 B.C. and 700 A.D. These early inhabitants were the first farmers and artisans in the Ohio Valley and Marietta was the site of a Moundbuilders city.[6]\n\nThe conical Great Mound at Mound Cemetery is part of a mound complex known as the Marietta Earthworks, which includes the nearby Quadranaou and Capitolium platform mounds, the Sacra Via walled mounds (largely destroyed in 1843), and additional mounds.\n\nThe Great Mound or Conus is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the Mound Cemetery Mound, site #73001549.\n\nAmerican Revolutionary War soldiers\n\nThe Washington County Historical Society compiled the following list of Revolutionary soldiers buried in Mound Cemetery:[6]\n\nCol.
