They were certainly the progenitors of the state builders of the great Northwest. Within fifty years of their coming, Ohio had a million and a half of people, and had already made such rapid strides in its internal improvement, its systems of navigation, its jurisprudence, and its enlargement of public education, as to become an example to some of the older states.” [Kennedy, \"History of the Ohio Society of New York 1885-1905\", 183-84. (A slight correction to this reference: forty-seven persons arrived April 7, 1788, with the forty-eighth person arriving on April 12, 1788.)]\n\nThese early American pioneers to the Northwest Territory have been memorialized in poetry. The poem, \"Landing of the Pioneers\", was written sixty years after the landing by Francis Dana Gage, and included in her book of poems published in 1867. The poem, \"The Founders of Ohio\", was written in 1888 during the centennial of the event by William Henry Venable, and was published later in several books of poems.\n\nMany of these early pioneers are buried in Marietta at Mound Cemetery.
