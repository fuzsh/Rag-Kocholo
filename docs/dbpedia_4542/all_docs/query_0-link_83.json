        "text": "[FONT=&quot]16 MARCH[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 1 of 2\n\nin 1609 - Michael Franck, composer is born.\n\nin 1651 - Zaccaria Tevo, composer is born.\n\nin 1663 - Nicholas Siret, composer is born.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1710 - Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, remarkable Italian composer, is born at Jesi, near Ancona. The origin family name was Draghi; the name Pergolesi was derived from the town of Pergola, where Pergolesi's ancestors lived. He was the only surviving child of his parents, 3 others having died in infancy. His childhood seems to have been plagued by ill health; a later caricature depicts him as having a deformed leg. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He first studied music with Francesco Santi, the maestro di cappella of the Jesi Cathedral. He also studied violin with Francesco Mondini. He then was given a stipend by the Marchese Cardolo Maria Pianetti, which enabled him to enter the Conservatory, dei Poveri di Gesu Cristo in Naples, where he studied violin with Domenico de Matteis, and composition with Gaetano Greco, its maestro di cappella, Leonardo Vinci, and Francesco Durante. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Pergolesi became highly proficient as a violinist, playing at the Conservatorio and throughout Naples. His first work to be performed was the dramma sacro Li prodigi della divina grazia nella conversione di S. Guglielmo Duca d'Aquitania, which was given by the Conservatory at the monastery of S. Agnello Maggiore in 1731. He graduated shortly thereafter, and received a commission for his first opera, La Salustia (Naples, Jan. 1732). He then became maestro di cappella to Prince Ferdinando Colonna Stigliano, equerry to the Viceroy of Naples, in 1732. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His Lo Frate 'nnamorato (Naples, Sept. 27, 1732) proved highly successful. In Dec. 1732 he composed several sacred works for performance at the church of S. Maria della Stella as a votive offering following a series of severe earthquakes in Naples. He was next commissioned to write an opera seria to celebrate the birthday of the empress on Aug. 28,1733; however, the premiere of the resulting // Prigionier superbo was delayed until Sept. 5,1733; it contained the 2-act intermezzo La Serva padrona, which became his most celebrated stage work. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was named deputy to the maestro di cappella of Naples in 1734. During a brief sojourn in Rome, his Mass in F major was performed at the church of S. Lorenzo in Lucina (May 16, 1734). After returning to Naples, Pergolesi became maestro di cappella to Marzio Domenico IV Carafa, the Duke of Maddaloni. For the birthday of the king's mother, he was commissioned to write the opera Adriano in Siria; it was premiered, without success, in Naples on Oct. 25, 1734, with the intermezzo La Contadina astuta (subsequently staged under various titles). He then was commissioned to write an opera for Rome's Teatro Tordinona, resulting in his unsuccessful opera seria L'Olimpiade (Jan. 8 or 9, 1735). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His last popular success for the stage was the commedia musicale // Flaminio (Naples, 1735). By 1735 his health had seriously declined, most likely from tuberculosis. Early in 1736 he went to the Franciscan monastery in Pozzuoli, where he soon died at the age of 26. He was buried in the common grave adjacent to the Cathedral. Following his death, his fame spread rapidly through performances of La Serva padrona and several other stage works. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Paris revival of the work in 1752 precipitated the so-called querelle des bouffons between the partisans of the Italian and French factions. His fame was further increased by performances of the Salve regina in C minor and the Stabat Mater in F minor. The chaotic entanglement of spurious, doubtful, and authentic works attributed to Pergolesi was unraveled in M. Paymer's G.B. P.: A Thematic Catalogue of the Oper Omnia with an Appendix Listing Omitted Compositions (N.Y., 1976). The Opera Omnia, ed. by F. CafTarelli (5 vols., Rome, 1939-42), is most unreliable; it is being replaced by a critical edition, the first volume of which appeared in 1985. - Died at Pozzuoli, near Naples, March 16, 1736.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1745 - Johann Wilhelm Cornelius von Konigslow, composer is born.\n\nin 1792 - Murder attempt on King Gustavus III by count Ankarstrom at opera.\n\nin 1806 - Giuseppe Colla, composer, dies at 74.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1814 - Jules (Eugene Abraham) Alary, Italian-born French composer, is born at Mantua. After studying at the Milan Conservatory, he settled in Paris as a voice teacher and composer. He wrote numerous operas, among the most popular being Le ire nozze (Paris, March 29, 1851). His opera La Voix humaine had the curious distinction of being staged at the Paris Opera (Dec. 30, 1861) for the sole purpose of making use of the scenery left over after the fiasco of Wagner's Tannhauser. Alary also wrote a mystery play, Redemption (Paris, April 14, 1850), much sacred music, and some chamber pieces. - Died at Paris, April 17, 1891.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1819 - Nicolas Sejan, composer, dies at 73.\n\nin 1822 - Composer Gioacchino Rossini marries Spanish soprano.[/FONT]\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWzmnEmpcqU\"][FONT=&quot]YouTube - Maestro Gioachino Rossini - Tarantella (Maestro Beniamino Gigli)[/FONT][/ame][FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1823 - William Henry Monk, composer is born.\n\nin 1867 - Benjamin Hanby, composer, dies at 33.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1881 - Modest (Petrovich) Mussorgsky, great Russian composer, dies at St. Petersburg age 42. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He received his first instruction on the piano from his mother; at the age of 10, he was taken to St. Petersburg, where he had piano lessons with Anton Herke, remaining his pupil until 1854. In 1852 he entered the cadet school of the Imperial Guard; composed a piano piece entitled Porte enseigne Polka, which was published (1852); after graduation (1856), he joined the regiment of the Guard. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1857, he met Dargomyzhsky, who introduced him to Cui and Balakirev; he also became friendly with the critic and chief champion of Russian national music, Vladimir Stasov. These associations prompted his decision to become a professional composer. He played and analyzed piano arrangements of works by Beethoven and Schumann; Balakirev helped him to acquire a knowledge of form; he tried to write music in classical style, but without success; his inner drive was directed toward \"new shores,\" as Mussorgsky expressed it. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The liquidation of the family estate made it imperative for him to take a paying job; he became a clerk in th Ministry of Communications (1863), being dismissed 4 years later. During this time, he continued to compose, but his lack of technique compelled him time and again to leave his various pieces unfinished. He eagerly sought professional advice from his friends Stasov (for general aesthetics) and Rimsky-Korsakov (for problems of harmony); to the very end of his life, he regarded himself as being only half-educated in music, and constantly acknowledged his inferiority as a craftsman. But he yielded to no one in his firm faith in the future of national Russian music. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When a group of composers from Bohemia visited St. Petersburg in 1867, Staso published an article in which he for the first time referred to the \"mighty handful of Russian musicians\" pursuing the ideal of national art. The expression was picked up derisively by some journalists, but it was accepted as a challenge by Mussorgsky and his comrades-in-arms, Balakirev, Borodin, Cui, and Rimsky- Korsakov, the \"mighty 5\" of Russian music. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1869 he once more entered government service, this time in the forestry dept. He became addicted to drink, and had epileptic fits; he died a week after his 42nd birthday. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The significance of Mussorgsky's genius did not become apparent until some years after his death. Most of his works were prepared for publication by Rimsky-Korsakov, who corrected some of his harmonic crudities, and reorchestrated the symphonic works. Original versions of his music were preserved in MS, and eventually published. But despite the availability of the authentic scores, his works continue to be performed in Rimsky-Korsakov's editions, made familiar to the whole musical world. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In his dramatic works, and in his songs, Mussorgsky draws a boldly realistic vocal line, in which inflections of speech are translated into a natural melody. His first attempt in this genre was an unfinished opera, The Marriage, to Gogol's comedy; here he also demonstrated his penetrating sense of musical humor. His ability to depict tragic moods is revealed in his cycle Songs and Dances of Death; his understanding of intimate poetry is shown in the children's songs. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His greatest work is the opera Boris Godunov (to Pushkin's tragedy), which has no equal in its stirring portrayal of personal destiny against a background of social upheaval. In it, Mussorgsky created a true national music drama, without a trace of the Italian conventions that had here-to-fore dominated the operatic works by Russian composers. He wrote no chamber music, perhaps because he lacked the requisite training in contrapuntal technique. Of his piano music, the set of pieces Pictures at an Exhibition (somewhat after the manner of Schumann's Carnaval) is remarkable for its vivid representation of varied scenes (it was written to commemorate his friend, the painter Victor Hartmann, whose pictures were the subjects of the music); the work became famous in the brilliant orchestration of Ravel. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although Mussorgsky was a Russian national composer, his music influenced many composers outside Russia, and he came to be regarded as the most potent talent of the Russian national school. The paintings of Victor Hartmann that inspired Pictures at an Exhibition were reproduced by Alfred Frankenstein in his article on the subject in the Musical Quarterly (July 1939); he also brought out an illustrated edition of the work (1951). A collected edition of Mussorgsky's works was compiled by P. Lamm (8 vols., Moscow, 1928-34; 1939). – Born at Pskov district, March 21, 1839.[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT]\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHIux8A61Tw&feature=related\"][FONT=&quot]YouTube - Mussorgsky - Meditation (Album Leaf)[/FONT][/ame][FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1885 - Giacomo Benvenuti, composer is born.\n\nin 1887 - Emanuel Kania, composer, dies at 59.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1894 - Jules Massenet's opera \"Thais\" premieres in Paris.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1898 - Ernst Bacon, remarkable American composer, is born at Chicago. He studied theory at Northwestern University with Lutkin (1915-18), and later at the University of Chicago with Oldberg and T. Otterstroem (1919-20); also took private piano lessons in Chicago with Alexander Raab (1916-21). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1924 he went to Vienna, where he took private composition lessons with Weigl and Schmidt. Returning to America, he studied composition with Bloch in San Francisco, and conducting with Goossens in Rochester, N.Y.; completed his education at the University of Calif. (M.A., 1935). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From 1934 to 1937 he was supervisor of the Federal Music Project in San Francisco; simultaneously deployed numerous related activities, as a conductor and a music critic. He was on the faculty of Converse College in S.C. (1938-45) and Syracuse University (1945-63). In 1939 and 1942 he held Guggenheim fellowships. He also engaged in literary pursuits—wrote poetry and published a book of aphorisms—and espoused radical politics.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A musician of exceptional inventive powers, he published a brochure, Our Musical Idiom (Chicago, 1917), when he was 19; in it he outlines the new resources of musical composition. He later published Words on Music (1960) and Notes on the Piano (1963). In some of his piano works, he evolved a beguiling technique of mirror reflection between right and left hands, exact as to the intervals, with white and black keys in one hand reflected respectively by white and black keys in the other. However, Bacon is generally regarded as primarily a composer of lyric songs. – Died at Orinda, Calif., March 16,1990.

He studied at the Royal College of Music in London. Although he wrote several orchesta and chamber works, he composed mainly for the theater, films, and television. Among his many film scores, particularly effective in films with epic subjects and with understated humor, were Tom Jones (1963; Academy Award), Torn Curtain (1966), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968), Sleuth (1972), The Seven Per Cent Solution (1976), and Strange Invaders (1983). – Died at Bennington, Vt, Dec. 7, 1998.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1928 - Ramon Barce, composer is born.\n\nin 1928 - Christa Ludwig, Berlin Germany, soprano (Vienna State Opera) is born.\n\nin 1929 - Edwin London, composer is born.\n\nin 1930 - Minoru Miky, composer is born.\n\nin 1931 - Betty Johnson, Guilford County NC, singer (Jack Paar Show, I Dreamed) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1931 - Theo(dor David) Altmeyer, German tenor, is born at Eschweiler. He was educated in Cologne.[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Altmeyer began his performance career while still a voice student at the Hochschule für Musik Köln where he studied under Clemens Glettenberg from 1953 to 1956. His first successes were primarily as an oratorio soloist. He was hired by the Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) to perform in several recordings of cantatas and other religious music. He went on to win second prize at the WDR's singing competition in 1955.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1956 Altmeyer joined the roster of singers at the Berlin State Opera, where he sang for the next four years. While there he notably portrayed the title role in the world premiere of Humphrey Searle's The Diary of a Madman. Then starting in the 1960-1961 season he was the principal lyric tenor at the Staatsoper Hannover, making his debut there as Tamino in Mozart's The Magic Flute. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He became particularly successful in that house with several more Mozart roles like Ferrando in Così fan tutte and Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni. He also excelled in portraying roles in works by Albert Lortzing and Gioachino Rossini. Other roles of note included the title roles in Benjamin Britten's Albert Herring and Jacques Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld. He also found particular success in the title role of Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina, a role he also performed at both the Vienna State Opera and the Staatsoper Stuttgart.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The most important work of Altmeyer's career was in the field of religious music. He was one of the most lauded and prolific oratorio singers of his day. His repertoire spanned from the medieval masters to new compositions. He was particularly admired for his many performances and recordings of works by Johann Sebastian Bach. As an oratorio singer he performed with major orchestras and musical ensembles throughout Germany, France, Austria, Italy, England, Belgium, Holland and Switzerland. He also participated in two large and highly successful concert tours of North America and performed at major music festivals such as Bachwoche Ansbach, Lucerne, Montreux, Vienna, Florence, Naples and Venice.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1974 Altmeyer joined the voice faculty of the Musikhochschule Hannover where he taught for several decades. Among his students is Dantes Diwiak. He continued to appear in operas and concerts during many of these years, giving his last public performance at La Morra in 1996. He died in Hannover at the age of 76 on the anniversary of Bach's death.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]in 1936 - Fred Neil is born. A prolific singer-songwriter, folk-blues artist was an institution in the folk music houses of Greenwich Village during the Sixties. The son of a jukebox industry executive, Neil began playing guitar in his teens and left home to join a gospel group. After releasing several unsuccessful solo singles in the late Fifties, he was hired as a staff writer at Southern Music; among his compositions during this period were the often recorded 'Come Back Home Baby' and the 1961 Roy Orbison hit 'Candy Man'. Continuing to pursue a solo career, Neil became a regular at the folk clubs and coffee houses of Greenwich Village and was occasionally joined on stage by Bob Dylan. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Signed by Elektra, Neil teamed with Miami-based folkie Vince Martin on the Paul Rothchild-produced album, Tear Down The Walls, which featured guest musicians Felix Pappalardi and John Sebastian and the popular Neil composition 'The Other Side Of This Life', later covered by Sebastian's group, The Lovin' Spoonful, and Jefferson Airplane. The song also appeared on Neil's first solo album, the moody and bluesy Bleecker & MacDougal, released by Elektra Records in 1965. Aided by his manager Herb Cohen, Neil then signed with Capitol Records and issued three albums for the label that continued to earn critical, but not commercial success.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] One of the tracks from his first Capitol album, 'Everybody's Talkin'', became a hit for Harry Nilsson in 1969 after its inclusion in the Dustin Hoffman film Midnight Cowboy, while 'The Dolphins' was covered by fellow cult folkie Tim Buckley. By the mid Seventies, Neil became a semi-recluse and rarely performed. He died in Key West, Florida, of natural causes July 7, 2001. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1937 - David Del Tredici, Cloverdale California, composer (1980 Pulitzer) is born.\n\nin 1937 - Constanca Capdeville, composer is born.\n\nin 1942 - Alexander van Zemlinsky, Austrian composer (African Dance), dies at 69.[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT]\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX_8iURgcoQ\"][FONT=&quot]YouTube - Epizod na Maskaradzie (Episode at a Masquerade) by Mieczyslaw Karlowicz Part One[/FONT][/ame][FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1943 - Alice (Josephine) Artzt, American guitarist, is born at Philadelphia. She studied piano and flute before taking up the classical guitar when she was 13. She pursued training with Ida Presti and Alexandre Lagoya in France and with Julian Bream in England, and also was a student of Otto Luening (composition) and Paul Henry Lang (musicology) at Columbia University (B.A., 1967), and of Darius Milhaud (composition). From 1966 to 1969 she taught at the Marines College of Music in N.Y., and then at Trenton (N.J.) State Coll. from 1977 to 1980. In 1969 she made her formal debut in a recital at Wigmore Hall in London, and thereafter pursued a global career as a recitalist and as a soloist with orchestras. In later years, she also toured extensively with her own Alice Artzt Guitar Trio. In addition to articles and reviews in journals, she published the books The Art of Practicing (1978) and Rhythmic Mastery (1997). Her repertoire includes not only the standard guitar literature and various works written for her, but also transcriptions of works for guitar solo, duo, and trio, ranging from Handel, Vivaldi, and Haydn to Gershwin, Charlie Chaplin, and Bernstein.

Akagi maintains his own sound no matter what the context. In the last two decades his credits include significant stints with Miles Davis, Stanley Turrentine, Art Pepper, Slide Hampton, Joe Farrell, Airto Moreira, James Newton, Sadao Watanabe, and fusion stalwarts Al DiMeola, Jean-Luc Ponty, and Allan Holdsworth. First influenced by Bud Powell, Akagi came of age listening to everyone from Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, and Sonny Rollins to late Coltrane and Miles's seminal fusion. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His family moved to the U.S. when he was four and he spent his late teens back in Japan, playing guitar and studying composition at the International Christian University in Tokyo. Returning to the States, he became a philosophy grad student at the University of Calif., Santa Barbara, but after two years decided to play music full-time.

Jewish-Italian composer, born in Florence; he was known as one of the foremost guitar composers in the twentieth century with almost one hundred compositions for that instrument. In 1939 he migrated to the United States and became a film composer for some 200 Hollywood movies for the next fifteen years. In 1926, Castelnuovo-Tedesco premiered his opera, La Mandragora, based on a play by Niccolò Machiavelli. It was the first of his many works inspired by great literature, which included interpretations of works by Aeschylus, Virgil, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Walt Whitman, Federico García Lorca, and especially William Shakespeare. Another major source of inspiration for him was his Jewish heritage, most notably the Bible and Jewish liturgy. His Violin Concerto No. 2 , written at the request of Jascha Heifetz, was also an expression of his pride in his Jewish origins, or as he described it, the \"splendor of past days,\" in the face of rising anti-Semitism that was sweeping across much of Europe. In 1939, Toscanini sponsored Mario as an immigrant in the United States. He landed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, in Hollywood as a film composer.

He won a Grammy Award in 1971 for \"Good Feelin'\" and was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.

The stint was successful enough that the trio launched its own weekly 15-minute network radio series, King Cole Trio Time, in October; it ran until April 1948. This increased exposure, in turn, further stimulated record sales. The group's revival of the 1931 song \"You Call It Madness (But I Call It Love)\" (music and lyrics by Con Conrad, Gladys Du Bois, Russ Columbo, and Paul Gregory) made the pop Top Ten in September and \"(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons\" (music by William Best, lyrics by Deek Watson) became their first pop #1 in December.
