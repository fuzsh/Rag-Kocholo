Sister Bickel was born in North Carolina May 19, 1796; and happily married to Mr. Anthony Bickel, of Virginia, July 7, 1814. Shortly after her marriage she removed with her husband and settled in Gallia county, Ohio, where they both soon became useful members of the M.E. Church. They raised nine children, all of whom became pious and useful members of the church; one of the sons, R.S. Bickel, of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, is well known and greatly beloved throughout the bounds of the Western Virginia Conference.\n\nThe husband, Bro. Anthony Bickel, died March 24, 1860, in full triumphs of a living faith and rest from his labors. Sister Bickel was one of those women of whom it may in truth be said, “she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness, her children rise up and call her blessed.” And after struggling on for near a half century in the service of her blessed Savior she fell asleep in Jesus and has gone to that rest above where labor, pain and sorrow are felt and feared no more. Her children (though they weep and sorrow) have a bright hope of meeting her in glory.\n\n“Hope looks beyond the bounds of time\n\nWhen what we now deplore,\n\nShall rise in full immortal prime\n\nAnd bloom to fade no more.” C.

She was taken ill with erysipeias, and all that medical aid could do was done, but God saw it fit to call her home.\n\nShe died Sept. 13, 1912, aged 54 years, 3 months and 9 days. She left to mourn their loss a husband, three sons, four brothers, two sisters, one half brother and a host of relatives and friends to mourn her sad demise. She was converted in the year 1887, joined the Victory Baptist church and lived a consistent christian until her death.\n\nShe had many lovely traits of character which will live long in the memory of those who love her. the boys she taught for so many years in the Sunday School will always cherish her memory. During her last hours her husband gave her a drink of water and she said \"it tasted good.\" Then exclaimed, I am on the Mountain Top, and with a lovely smile on her face she fell \"Asleep in Jesus.\" The family circle is broken. The husband is sad and lonely and they are broken hearted now that mother is gone. The vacant chair will cause unhidden tears to flow, but the same Jesus lives who said, \"I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.\"\n\nThe church circle is broken. One of our most consecrated workers has fallen at her post. We will miss her at the church service, also in Sunday School, we will miss her everywhere; but she has gone to join the church triumphant. She has fought a good fight, she has finished her course. She had kept her faith and henceforth there is laid for her a crown of righteouness, which the Lord the righteous Judge will give to her in that day, not to her only, but to all them that love his appearing.\n\nThe funeral was conducted by Rev. J.L. Porter, assisted by her pastor Rev. E.S. Sheets. The floral tributes were many and beautiful, which spoke of the high esteem she was held by her neighbors.

On her arrival in this State, she found it nearly an unbroken forest, and inhabited by the red man of the forest. Having shared the toil and peril of emigrants she was finally settled upon a farm not far from the mouth of Campaign creek. Here she raised a family of children all of whom have settled in life. Mrs. B., enjoyed generally good health, and had been blessed with an iron constitution.\n\nShe was a kind and affectionate Mother__and a good neighbor. Her sickness was of short duration having been suddenly struck with the hand of death. It was my privilege to visit her at her son-in-law’s Mr. James Blake, where on the 26th of August she finished her earthly course in the 79th year. As he awoke from sleep, and as her reason seemed restored, I asked her if she was trusting in the Savior, she responded, “yes.”\n\nThus has passed away one much beloved and esteemed.

Bird, long a conspicuous member of the local bar in October, 1909, she divided her time among her children.\n\nNative of Graham Sta.\n\nHer death wipes out the family of Major Brown, one of the most prominent families in the history of Ohio River transportation.\n\nMrs. Bird was born at Graham Station, W. Va. She was one of nine children, all of whom were given names beginning with M, though one of them discarded her original name in her young womanhood. They were Miles and Marlin Brown and Mrs. Selina Guthrie, wife of Dr. W. B. Guthrie, all of whom lived here; Melvin, Matthew, Martin, Manley and Martha Brown, most of whom lived at Hartford and Graham Station, and most of them owners and operators of steamboats for many years.\n\nIn 1863 at the Brown homestead, Mary E. Brown and Charles Wesley Bird were married. For a while they lived at Mason City, where he was teaching school and studying law. He was a native of Staunton, Va., and would have been 93 years old next July 3. His first contacts with the Brown family came about presumably as a result of his filling clerkships on various packets in his youth. He was first admitted to the practice of law in West Virginia but came here about 1870, it is said.\n\nThree children survive, Mrs. Watts, William G. Bird, Nitro, W. Va., and Mrs. Josephine Petty, Washington, D. C.\n\nMrs. Bird was a member of Grace M. E. church. She was a woman of few activities, giving her attention and energies in full measure to her family and home and receiving the attention and devotion of her children in like measure in her later years. She was a kind and gentle wife and mother and ever stood high in the esteem of all who knew her.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 2 o’clock Sunday at the Watts apartment, Rev. H. H.

Her funeral services were conducted at her late home at 3 o’clock this afternoon by Rev. J. W. Dillon of the M. E. Church, her burial following at the old cemetery on Pine street beside her late husband, Robert Black and daughter Emma, conducted by Hayward & Son.\n\nHer parents, Charles and Martha Graham, were original residents of Letart, and removed to Indiana. They were the parents of one son and five daughters. There were Mrs. Black, Mrs. Dr. W. F. Hannan, Mrs. Reuben Graham, Mrs. E. E. Waddell and Mrs. Dr. Badgley—Lovisa, Matilda, Sarah, Jennie and Agnes—all born at Letart except Mrs. Badgley who was born in Indiana. They only lived in Indiana a short time when their parents died, Mrs. Badgley being only six years old.\n\nLovisa married Robert Black, a prominent citizen here, about the time of their parents’ death 1845 and they took Mrs. Badgley and kept her. The other girls taught school, making Mrs. Black’s home their headquarters during their vacations. Mr. Black prospered, became associated with the late E. Deletombe in merchandizing, was elected Treasurer of the county, etc., and built the brick residence now known as the Drouillard property down on Third street opposite Charley Mack’s, where they lived many years until Mr. Black retired from business, when they sold that property and built the beautiful home where Mrs. Black passed away.\n\nMrs. Black was exceedingly handsome, refined and intelligent lady with the most aesthetic tastes. She was very prominent in church circles, being a member of the M. E. Church from a child and was a liberal, generous donator to all its interests and purposes though exceedingly modest in all of it. She was good, honest, true, sincere and plain spoken, with decided opinions, keenly tempered, but well governed and with a very superior mind, which was clearly shown to the end.\n\nAbout two years ago she went to Columbus and Delaware to visit, in reasonably good health, though she had failed some for a year. The trip was too much for her and running about Columbus seemed to have tired her out. Getting better she came home and in ten days was taken ill with congestion of the lungs and as she got over that congestion of the brain set in. Her life was despaired of several times, but she would rally somewhat, but for months she has been helpless, constantly attended by her youngest sister, Mrs. Badgley, who hardly left her bedside for a moment.\n\nSitting propped up in bed Saturday evening while all but Mrs. Badgley were out at supper, she passed away in the 77th year of her age. The Church, the poor, the community have met with a loss that can only be felt when such as she passes away, but she longed to go, and the sorrow is not hers. Peace be with her forevermore.\n\nGallipolis Daily Tribune (Pg. 3)\n\nMonday, June 29, 1896\n\nTranscribed by Sandy Milliron\n\nBlack, Naomi\n\nKanauga Lady Dies\n\nKANAUGA, March 20 - Mrs. Naomi Black, widow of the late James Black, died at her home here at 8 p.m. Thursday after only a half hour’s illness from apoplexy.

But they mourn, \"not as those without hope,\" for it is their delightful privilege to gather up the precious memorials of a religious life, which commenced at the age of 20, which soon after led to a preparation for the work of the ministry, which found him immediately after the completion of his college course actually \"in orders;\" which, during a ministry of almost 40 years—21 of which were spent in New England—and the balance in the parishes of Mansfield, Newark, Dresden and Ironton, of the Diocese of Ohio; was full of strong hope and of earnest and faithful efforts to enlarge the bounds of the Church of his fathers [. . .] Rector St. Peter's\n\nThe Gallipolis Journal\n\nJune 27, 1867\n\nTranscribed by Eva Swain Hughes\n\nBlackburn, Agnes\n\nMrs. Agnes Blackburn, sick for a long time, died at the home of Mr. and Mrs. R.

Blake, One of the Oldest Residents of the County-\n\nSketch of His Life\n\nIn the death of Mr. A. T. Blake we record the departure of one of the first settlers of this county. The sad event occured at the home of his daughter, Mrs. W. H. McCormick, on Fourth street at 2:30 Friday afternoon, Nov. 27, 1896, where he had been tenderly cared for during his last illness.\n\nMr. Blake was born Nov. 23, 1801, in the old block house at Marietta, in which the settlers lived as a place of safety, and was the first male child born in that ancient city. He spent his earlier days in and around Marietta locating at his present old homestead at Swan Creek at the age of 17 with his parents, his folks coming down the river in a bark or dug-out, while he drove a yoke of cattle through by land. His father was a sea captain and took charge of one of the vessels that was constructed at Marietta. He loaded the craft with sasafras and took it to Dublin Island for disposal.\n\nMr. Blake was married to Hannah Trobridge Dec. 10, 1826, and for nearly sixty-nine years or until separated by the hand of death, they lived happily together. Mrs. Blake died May 2, 1895, in her ninety-third year. By their marriage six children were born, four girls and two boys, viz: William Blake, deceased; C. B. Blake, ex-sheriff of this county, who resides at Swan Creek and has charge of the old homestead; Mrs. Harriet Smith, deceased; Mrs. Julia Eaton, of Quaker Bottom; and Mrs. W. H. McCormick and Mrs. E. T. Moore, of this city.\n\nDeceased has been in declining health for over a year from the infirmities of old age and a cancerous growth, which hastened his death. Until about a month ago he was strong enough to be up and around. During his entire illness he was cheerful and bore his sufferings patiently. He realized his condition and had a premonition that the end was near and three days ago he called his children to his bedside and in a feeble, but distinct tone of voice, said: \"I would like to live to be with you, as I love you dearly, but my summons is near at hand, as they have told me, and I will live only three days.\" He fell into an eternal sleep without a sign of pain, surrounded by his three daughters and son, who did all that willing hands could do for one who had done so much for them.\n\nAs to his moral character Mr. Blake's was one of sterling quality. He always contended and worked to build up the principles of right and justice. He was a charitable neighbor and friend; always ready to help the needy with a lavish hand. He was economical that he might save something, not for his own aggrandizement, but that he might be able to give when called upon.\n\nDeceased was a life-long Republican, and even during his last illness at his suggestion he was driven to the polls that he might cast his last vote for Major McKinley, in whom he felt a great pride. He used to make trips to New Orleans with flat boats laden with produce which he sold in the Southern markets.\n\nMr. Blake's word was held in high esteem by all who knew him. In the words of one of his neighbors, \"His word to him was as good as other men's bonds, \" and that is one of the loftiest aspirations of a man's life, as a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.\n\nIn 1876 Mr. Blake attended the centennial at Philidelphia and also the celebration at Marietta of the one hundredth anniversary of the settlement of that city in 1886, which he enjoyed. At his native home the transformation of the block-house and an open court, where the children used to play, as they dared not venture out without imperiling their lives by falling victims of the red-skins, to that of a thrifty little city was like the removal of a hut and the building of a castle in its stead to him. The departure of such a venerable resident is regretted by all who knew his good traits and the sympathy of the community is with his children.\n\nThe remains were taken to Swan Creek this (Saturday) afternoon on the steamer Vesper, and the funeral services will be conducted at the old homestead Sunday forenoon at 10 o'clock by Rev. J. W. McCormick, burial at the family burying ground by Wetherholt.\n\n[Note: Cemetery entry gives his first name as 'Anselm T.'.

Blake, Esq., his son, in Ohio township. The deceased was born in Massachusetts in the year 1762, and although a youth of but thirteen years of age, when the battle of Bunker Hill took place, in June, 1775, he could not be restrained, but shouldered his musket and marched in defence [sic] of his country, but from his inability to undergo the hardships of camp life, had his musket taken from him and sent home, but his ardor was not abated, and was always desiring his parents to let him enlist, but as he was a minor during the whole war of the revolution, his parents prevented him.\n\nIn 1789, when the agents of the Ohio Company were soliciting the men of enterprise and fortitude to aid and assist in forming a settlement at the mouth of Muskingum, David Blake embarked in the enterprise, and with others came to Marietta in the spring of 1790. The year following the Indian war broke out, and from that time until Wayne's treaty with the Indians, in 1795, he performed the duty of a soldier under Captain Anselm Tupper. When the war ceased, he purchased a valuable tract of land in Washington county, which he highly improved, on which he resided many years, raising and educating a family of nine sons and daughters, and subsequently sold his farm, and purchased another in Ohio township, Gallia county, to which he removed in 1815, and with incredible labor cleared a farm in a dense forest of Ohio bottom, requiring to be ditched and prepared for cultivation.\n\nSome seven years since he lost the companion of his youth, and with her all ambition to attend to worldly concerns, and so dividing and arranging his estate, that he continued to reside in his own domicil [sic] with his son until he received the summons to prepare for the change he was to undergo. Instead of complaining and fault-finding, he was always cheerful and pleasant, ready to amuse his friends with the scenes of by-gone days. His life has been a time of the most interesting events; he has seen his country pass from a state of vassalage and colonial government to the enjoyment of the inestimable blessing of self-government; to see his country with a population of some four millions, contending successfully with one of the most gigantic powers of Europe, and establishing upon an indestructible basis the only free government upon the globe. He has seen his country grow as if by magic from four to twenty-five millions of inhabitants; to see her form a confederacy of but thirteen States, and to see them expanding and extending until she numbers thirty-one and some seven or eight territories; to see her extending her commerce into every corner of the globe; and causing her power to be respected by all nations of the earth, to see civil and religious liberty exjoyed by the inhabitants of her widely extended domain.\n\nWhile the mind of David Blake kept pace with the improvements of his country, he did not forget his spiritual concerns—he kept his Bible upon his table, which was his constant companion, and religion was his only solace and comfort in the trying hour of death, and his last words were—\"Lord, into thy hands I commit my soul.\" Anselm T.

Last winter both of them were in Florida and Oklahoma. In the latter place she contracted a severe cold from which she did not recover and which hastened her death.

[Trobridge]\n\nAT REST\n\nThe Death Summons Comes to Mrs. Anselm T. Blake, Wednesday, May 1, 1895\n\nThis community was saddened Thursday morning, when the intelligence of the death of Mrs. A. T. Blake [Anselm T.. Blake], at Swan Creek, the day before became known. There was probably no lady living in the county so well known as she, and no one more universally respected. Growing up with this county, she had come to be a well known part of it during her late years.\n\nMrs. Blake was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. David Trobridge, who departed this life years ago. Deceased was born in New England in 1803 and removed to this State when only eight years of age. She was united in marriage to Mr. Blake in Athens county, Ohio, December 10, 1826, and came immediately to this county where they resided. With a family of six children, two of whom are dead, she has lived among us almost a century, until summoned to eternal rest to await the sounding of the trumpet on that eventful morn.\n\nMrs. Blake has been an invalid for over four months, suffering from heart and stomach trouble, together with old age. She realized her condition, but was patient and loving and her earthly life went out quietly and peacefully, surrounded by the tender and attentive hands of the family.\n\nDeceased was a woman of great hospitality, taking delight in seeing her house filled with her friends. While not a member of any particular church, Mrs. Blake professed her faith in Christ at the M. E. Church and a firm believer in its doctrines. One of her characteristics was that of a charitable feeling for everybody, and of forgetting all harsh feeling herself and having a kind word for all her acquaintances. She was probably the oldest resident of Ohio Township, and that community can never forget her labors for the advancement of any and all good deeds proposed. She was ever faithful to all trusts, unswervingly loyal to her friends and an earnest worker of that _______.\n\nBesides Mr. Blake, who is very poorly, deceased leaves three married daughters and one son, Mrs. E. T. Moore, Mrs. W. H. McCormick, Mrs. John Eaton and Mr. C. B. Blake, to cherish and hold sacred the memory of a true and kind parent.\n\nThe funeral services were held at the family residence at Swan Creek, Friday afternoon at 2 o’clock, and were preached by Rev.
