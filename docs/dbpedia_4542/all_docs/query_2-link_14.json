        "text": "And I wanted someone who is absolutely and utterly powerful. It’s interesting because at the time, John Byrne had just taken over Superman and had announced that he was making Superman less powerful because he had become too powerful and you couldn’t write interesting stories about people that were too powerful. That started me thinking, “Well, no, actually you can, because what makes a person interesting or not interesting isn’t how powerful they are, but who they are.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\n“Alan Moore got to be the Beatles. … I was Gerry and the Pacemakers,” Interview, Los Angeles Times (2008-12-02)\n\nOn creating Morpheus, the Sandman.\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nOne word after another.\n\nThat’s the only way that novels get written and, short of elves coming in the night and turning your jumbled notes into Chapter Nine, it’s the only way to do it.\n\nSo keep on keeping on. Write another word and then another.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\n“Pep Talk from Neil Gaiman,” National Novel Writing Month (2011)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nI am old now, or at least, I am no longer young, and everything I see reminds me of something else I’ve seen, such that I see nothing for the first time. A bonny girl, her hair fiery red, reminds me only of another hundred such lasses, and their mothers, and what they were as they grew, and what they looked like when they died. It is the curse of age, that all things are reflections of other things.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\n“The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains …”, Trigger Warning (2015)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nThere’s nothing like studying the bestseller lists of bygone years for teaching an author humility. You’ve heard of the ones that got filmed, normally. Mostly you realize that today’s bestsellers are tomorrow’s forgotten things.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\n“This Much I Know,” The Guardian (2017-08-05)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nI miss what I had in terms of the speed of memory access. If I needed a word or a fact it was already at my fingertips and now it’s like an arthritic and elderly gentleman has to sit up and go down many, many flights of stairs very slowly and go and rummage in dusty drawers. Eventually he will return four days later, normally at about 1:30 in the morning, and I will sit up and go, “Oh yes! ‘Crepuscular.’ That was the word I was looking for.”\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\n“This Much I Know,” The Guardian (2017-08-05)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nEver since I had dinner with Lou Reed I’ve tried to avoid meeting the people who would make me feel starstruck. It was a great dinner but by the end of it Lou Reed was no longer my hero, and I don’t have many heroes. I resolutely avoided meeting David Bowie, which became harder when I became friends with Duncan Jones, his son, and then got even harder when I moved to Woodstock and he lived around the corner.

On very bad days I will observe that I must have written good things in the past, which means that I’ve lost it. But normally I just assume that I don’t have it. The gulf between the thing I set out to make in my head and the sad, lumpy thing that emerges into reality is huge and distant and I just wish that I could get them closer.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\n“This Much I Know,” The Guardian (2017-08-05)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nYou get ideas from daydreaming.

I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and Marilyn Monroe and the Beatles and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen — I believe that people are perfectible, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones who look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone’s ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline of good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the Big One comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we’ll all be wiped out by the common cold like the Martians in War of The Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind’s destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it’s aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there’s a cat in a box somewhere who’s alive and dead at the same time (although if they don’t ever open the box to feed it it’ll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn’t even know that I’m alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasn’t done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what’s going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies too. I believe in a woman’s right to choose, a baby’s right to live, that while all human life is sacred there’s nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you’re alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nAmerican Gods, Part 2, ch. 13 [Sam] (2001)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\n“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe I can get some kind of a happy ending.”\n\n“Not only are there no happy endings,” she told him. “There aren’t even any endings.”\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nAmerican Gods, Part 3, ch. 16 [Shadow and Bast] (2001)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nIf it makes you more comfortable, you could simply think of it as a metaphor. Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms, a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert, someone who loves you — even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers and triumphs over all opposition.\n\nReligions are places to stand and look and act, vantage points from which to view the world.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nAmerican Gods, Part 3, ch. 18 (2001)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nFairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nCoraline (2002)\n\nParaphrase by Gaiman of G.

And, most importantly (because I think there should be more kindness and more wisdom in the world right now), that you will, when you need to be, be wise, and that you will always be kind.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nBlog entry (2008-12-31), “Another Year”\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nI’ve never been convinced that there’s any meaningful division between high culture and pop culture — I think there’s good stuff out there, and there’s stuff that’s not much good, and that Sturgeon’s Law applies to high culture and popular culture: 90% of it will be crap, which means that 10% of it will be amazing.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nBlog entry (2009-04-02), “Apparently if you just write BEAVER! people’s minds head straight for the gutter”\n\n(Source)\n\nSee Sturgeon.\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nI hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes.\n\nBecause if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You’re doing things you’ve never done before, and more importantly, you’re Doing Something.\n\nSo that’s my wish for you, and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody’s ever made before. Don’t freeze, don’t stop, don’t worry that it isn’t good enough, or it isn’t perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or life.\n\nWhatever it is you’re scared of doing, Do it.\n\nMake your mistakes, next year and forever.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nBlog entry (2011-12-31), “My New Year Wish”\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nI think the most important thing I learned from Stephen King I learned as a teenager, reading King’s book of essays on horror and on writing, Danse Macabre. In there he points out that if you just write a page a day, just 300 words, at the end of a year you’d have a novel. It was immensely reassuring — suddenly something huge and impossible became strangely easy. As an adult, it’s how I’ve written books I haven’t had the time to write, like my children’s novel Coraline.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nBlog entry (2012-04-28), “Popular Writers: A Stephen King Interview”\n\n(Source)\n\nContributor's note to an interview with Stephen King, \"The King and I,\" Sunday Times Magazine (2012-04-08).\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nSo this is my wish, a wish for me as much as it is a wish for you: in the world to come, let us be brave — let us walk into the dark without fear, and step into the unknown with smiles on our faces, even if we’re faking them.\n\nAnd whatever happens to us, whatever we make, whatever we learn, let us take joy in it. We can find joy in the world if it’s joy we’re looking for, we can take joy in the act of creation.\n\nSo that is my wish for you, and for me. Bravery and joy.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nBlog entry (2012-12-31), “My New Year’s Wish”\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nSome years ago, I was lucky enough invited to a gathering of great and good people: artists and scientists, writers and discoverers of things. And I felt that at any moment they would realise that I didn’t qualify to be there, among these people who had really done things.\n\nOn my second or third night there, I was standing at the back of the hall, while a musical entertainment happened, and I started talking to a very nice, polite, elderly gentleman about several things, including our shared first name. And then he pointed to the hall of people, and said words to the effect of, “I just look at all these people, and I think, what the heck am I doing here? They’ve made amazing things. I just went where I was sent.”\n\nAnd I said, “Yes. But you were the first man on the moon. I think that counts for something.”\n\nAnd I felt a bit better. Because if Neil Armstrong felt like an imposter, maybe everyone did. Maybe there weren’t any grown-ups, only people who had worked hard and also got lucky and were slightly out of their depth, all of us doing the best job we could, which is all we can really hope for.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nBlog entry (2017-05-12)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nRemember: when people tell you something’s wrong or doesn’t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nIn “Ten Rules for Writing Fiction,” The Guardian (20 Feb 2010)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nRemember that, sooner or later, before it ever reaches perfection, you will have to let it go and move on and start to write the next thing. Perfection is like chasing the horizon. Keep moving.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nIn “Ten Rules for Writing Fiction,” The Guardian (20 Feb 2010)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nThe main rule of writing is that if you do it with enough assurance and confidence, you’re allowed to do whatever you like. (That may be a rule for life as well as for writing. But it’s definitely true for writing.) So write your story as it needs to be written. Write it honestly, and tell it as best you can. I’m not sure that there are any other rules. Not ones that matter.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nIn “Ten Rules for Writing Fiction,” The Guardian (20 Feb 2010)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nI don’t know that it’s an issue for anybody but me, but it’s true that nothing I did where the only reason for doing it was the money was ever worth it, except as bitter experience. Usually I didn’t wind up getting the money, either. The things I did because I was excited, and wanted to see them exist in reality have never let me down, and I’ve never regretted the time I spent on any of them.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nSpeech (2012-05-17), Commencement, University of the Arts, Philadelphia [06:33]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nLife is sometimes hard. Things go wrong, in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health and in all the other ways that life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do.\n\nMake. good. art.\n\nI’m serious. Husband runs off with a politician? Make good art. Leg crushed and then eaten by mutated boa constrictor? Make good art. IRS on your trail? Make good art. Cat exploded? Make good art. Somebody on the Internet thinks what you do is stupid or evil or it’s all been done before? Make good art. Probably things will work out somehow, and eventually time will take the sting away, but that doesn’t matter. Do what only you do best. Make. good. art.\n\nMake it on the good days too.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nSpeech (2012-05-17), Commencement, University of the Arts, Philadelphia [10:08]\n\n(Source)\n\n(Source (Video)). In the video, he starts it as \"Sometimes life is hard.\" In the middle, he says it as, \"Somebody on the Internet thinks what you're doing ...\" He also adds \"Make it on the bad days\" before the final sentence.\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nAnd now go, and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here. Make good art.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nSpeech (2012-05-17), Commencement, University of the Arts, Philadelphia [19:28]\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nMake mistakes. Make great mistakes, make wonderful mistakes, make glorious mistakes. Better to make a hundred mistakes than to stare at a blank piece of paper too scared to do anything wrong, too scared to do anything.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nSpeech, Harvey Awards (2004)\n\nMore quotes by Gaiman, Neil\n\nHow important are free speech and satire? Important enough that people will murder others to silence the kind of speech they don’t like.\n\nNeil Gaiman (b. 1960) British author, screenwriter, fabulist\n\nTwitter (7 Jan 2014)\n\n(Source)\n\nRegarding the mass murder at the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris."
