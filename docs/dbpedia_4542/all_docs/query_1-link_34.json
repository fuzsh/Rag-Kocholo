        "text": "Quick facts for kids\n\nSettlement of Marietta\n\n\"General Putnam landing at Marietta\"\n\nDate April 7, 1788 ( ) Location Marietta, later part of the U.S. state of Ohio Outcome Founding of the first permanent American settlement of the Northwest Territory\n\nThis is a list of early settlers of Marietta, Ohio, the first permanent settlement created by United States citizens after the establishment of the Northwest Territory in 1787. The settlers included soldiers of the American Revolutionary War and members of the Ohio Company of Associates.\n\nBackground\n\nThe first group of these early settlers is sometimes referred to as \"the forty-eight\" or the \"first forty-eight\", and also as the \"founders of Ohio\". These first 48 men were carefully chosen and vetted by several of the co-founders of the Ohio Company of Associates, Rufus Putnam and Manasseh Cutler, to ensure men of high character and bravery, as well as men with proven skills necessary to build a settlement in the wilderness. George Washington said of them: \"I know many of the settlers personally, and there never were men better calculated to promote the welfare of such a community.\" General Lafayette, who fought with the Americans during the Revolutionary War, visited Marietta on his US tour during May 1825 [1] and described these pioneers and former officers: \"They were the bravest of brave. Better men never lived.\" Historian David McCullough notes that these pioneers were: \"characters of historic accomplishment who were entirely unknown to most Americans\".\n\nUnder the leadership of Putnam, two parties of pioneers comprising the first 48 men departed New England, cutting trails westward through the mountains during an uncommonly severe winter. One party departed from the towns of Ipswich, Massachusetts and Danvers, Massachusetts on December 3, 1787; the other party departed from Hartford, Connecticut on January 1, 1788. The pioneers crossed the mountains and met at Sumrill's Ferry (present-day West Newton, Pennsylvania) on the Youghiogheny River. During the bitterly cold winter, the men built three log canoes, two flatboats, the 45-ton Adventure Galley (also known as the Mayflower, in honor of their Pilgrim ancestors) and the three-ton Adelphia. This small fleet carried the pioneers down the Youghiogheny River to the Monongahela River, and then to the Ohio River, and onward to the Ohio Country and the Northwest Territory. They arrived at their final destination, the mouth of the Muskingum River at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers, on April 7, 1788.\n\nFirst forty-eight, April 1788\n\n—William Henry Venable, April 1888.\n\nThe first 48 pioneers included the following men. This group of pioneers arrived on April 7, 1788, except for Colonel Meigs, who arrived five days later on April 12, 1788, and Anselm Tupper, who arrived on April 25, according to Putnam's journal.\n\nGeneral Rufus Putnam, superintendent of the settlement, co-founder of the Ohio Company of Associates\n\nColonel Return J.

Tupper)\n\nMajor Asa Coburn\n\nAndrew Webster\n\nThe Cushing and Goodale families\n\n1788 and 1789\n\nOther notable arrivals included:\n\nQuartermaster Griffin Greene (cousin of General Nathanael Greene)\n\nCommander Abraham Whipple\n\nLegacy\n\nDuring 1852 the president of the Ohio Historical Society described these pioneers: \"So various and eventful lives as theirs have scarcely ever fallen to the lot of man. They were born under a monarchy,—fought the battle of Independence,—assisted in the baptism of a great republic,—then moved into a wilderness,—and laid the foundations of a State,—itself almost equaling an empire. These men not only lived in remarkable times, but were themselves remarkable men. Energetic, industrious, persevering, honest, bold, and free — they were limited in their achievements only by the limits of possibility. Successful alike in field and forest,—they have, at length, gone to their rest,—leaving names which are a part of the fame and the history of their country\". On the centennial anniversary of the Marietta settlement, Senator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts orated, \"It was an illustrious band; they were men of exceptional character, talents and attainments; they were the best of New England culture; they were Revolutionary heroes\".\n\n\"Can too much be said in praise of the noble heroes who opened to settlement the Great Northwest Territory? These men had been trained in army life and discipline and were anxious to take this country as the payment due them for military service. They were men who had fought valiantly to preserve the principles of their government and were ready for other great achievements. They were men who had assisted in making this territory a part of the United States and had, in great measure, assisted in the formation and adoption of the Ordinance of 1787 which was to govern it. Indeed, a better company of men could scarcely have been selected than those who were directed by General Putnam.\"\n\n\"The forty-eight persons who disembarked from the 'Adventure Galley' at the mouth of the Muskingum, April 7, 1788, had come out into the wilderness to lay the corner-stone of one of the greatest political edifices that has ever sheltered millions of brave, prosperous and happy freemen. They were certainly the progenitors of the state builders of the great Northwest. Within fifty years of their coming, Ohio had a million and a half of people, and had already made such rapid strides in its internal improvement, its systems of navigation, its jurisprudence, and its enlargement of public education, as to become an example to some of the older states.\"\n\nThese early American pioneers to the Northwest Territory have been memorialized in verse and book. The poem, Landing of the Pioneers, was written sixty years after the landing by Frances Dana Gage, and included in her book of poems published in 1867. The poem, The Founders of Ohio, was written in 1888 during the centennial of the event by William Henry Venable, and was published later in several books of poems. The book Pioneer History (1848) by Samuel Prescott Hildreth describes the early civil history of the Northwest Territory in Ohio; Hildreth's book Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio (1852) provides biographies of the earliest settlers. Many of these early pioneers are buried in Marietta at Mound Cemetery. The film Opening the Door West, chronicling the pioneers, aired on Ohio PBS during the 2003 Ohio Bicentennial."
