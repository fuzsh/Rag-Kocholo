ABSTRACTS OF PROBATE AND LAND RECORDS by CLAUDE W. BARLOW, Ph.D. Clark University Worcester, Mass. Copyright 1962 by Edna Anne Hannibal Manufactured in the United States of America 1804092 INTRODUCTION. An intensive effort has been made to cover all im¬ portant original records for the area of southeastern Massachusetts where these Briggs families lived, whether these records were published or unpublished. All probate records for Plymouth County were abstracted through 1920 and for Bristol County through I85O. All Briggs deeds of Plymouth County were abstracted through 1820 and later; also all deeds of Bristol County at the Taunton Registry to 1790 and at the New Bedford Registry to 1870 and lat¬ er. Similar work was done in the probate and land records of Barnstable County and Nantucket. The chief sources of unpublished Vital Records that were copied were as fol¬ lows: 1) all the Vital Records and Church Records of the town of Wareham, found in two copies at the wareham Pub¬ lic Library; 2) cemetery inscriptions of Wareham; 3) cemetery inscriptions for dates after I85O in Rochester, Marion and Mattapoisett, as found in copies in the Lib¬ rary of the New England Historic Genealogical Society; 4) Cemetery records from New Bedford and Fairhaven; 5) Vital Records provided by the Town Clerk of Fairhaven; 6) all original marriage records to 1875 as found in the office of the Secretary of State in Boston; 7) death records to 1930 and sometimes later in the same office. Unpublished Vital Records previous to 1850 for the towns of Middlebo rough and Plymouth have not been examined. It should be emphasized that the birth records for Massa¬ chusetts towns after 1850 are not open to the public, and that the family lists of some of the Briggs name aft¬ er that date are undoubtedly incomplete, especially where not verified from probate or census records. The U.3. Census Records for all of southeastern Massa¬ chusetts towns through 1880 were completely examined. Military records for wars previous to 1776 and numerous other items of interest came from the State Archives in Boston and from the old records in the Suffolk County Courthouse. An effort has been made to give complete references to both published and unpublished sources for each family group. The Briggs records which were collected by the late Mr. Charles Harold Briggs of Minneapolis, Minn., and which have been microfilmed by his son and placed in the New England Historic G-enealogical Society, the Newberry, and the Los Angeles City Libraries have been examined. Several lines which are included in Mr. Briggs' microfilm as descendants of Clement Briggs have been shown by evi¬ dence to be descendants of John Briggs of Sandwich. The town directories of southeastern Massachusetts have also been consulted for evidence. oston etown •Tisbury lEdgartown ucket •Middleboro •Lakeville •Carver .Rochester Rail River Nantucket Sound hatham SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS JOHN BRIGGS OF SANDWICH, MASS., AND HIS DESCENDANTS. 1st Generation. 1.

On 1 June 1641 at the General Court of Plymouth his widow was granted the administration of his estate. Savage considered him to be the John Briggs of Lynn who probably came on the “Blessing 11 in 1635* ae* 20 y* However, the John Briggs who settled in Newport, R. I.. in 1639 may have been the passenger on the “Blessing.” The names of the children of John-1 Briggs are re¬ corded in the inventory taken of his estate by Edward Dillinghame and Thomas Tupper. “And the said Katherne Briggs Doth prmise and give unto her two children two cowes vis* the yeonger white cowe to her sonne Samuel and the browne heiff- er to her Daughter Sarah to be kept for them and thencrease and stock to be the ires from this tyme forward - “ .
