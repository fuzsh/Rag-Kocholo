        "text": "The Marietta Chapter Sons of the American Revolution was chartered in 2005. One of our first projects was to learn about the Patriots of the American Revolution who were the pioneer settlers of Washington County. After ten years of research and assistance from many who came before us, we have produced a list of 292 Patriots who served our Country during the American Revolution and their final resting spot is Washington County Ohio.\n\n​\n\nA special thanks must be given to the Marietta Chapter Daughters of the American Revolution, Beverly Schumacher of the Nabby Lee Ames Chapter DAR, the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Ohio Genealogical Society, Ernie Thode and Catherine Sams at the Washington County Public Library History & Genealogy, Linda Showalter at the Marietta College Special Collections, the Ebenezer Zane Chapter SAR, and the National Society Sons of the American Revolution.\n\nThe mission of our chapter is to perpetuate the people and events of the American Revolution, promote patriotism, and preserve the ideals of freedom. We conduct Revolutionary War grave restoration projects, document these graves (Graves Registration Committee) and conduct ceremonies related to the patriots who supported American's struggle for Independence at home and on the battlefield, as well as the pioneers who settled of the Northwest Territory.\n\n​\n\nRespectfully submitted May 14, 2015\n\n​\n\nJean Yost, Registrar and Past President, Marietta Chapter SAR\n\nScott Britton, Marietta Chapter SAR Historian"
