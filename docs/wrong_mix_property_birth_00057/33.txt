I am glad to announce my participation as a mentor in the upcoming business contest for high school students, hosted by Japan Finance Corporation, Hyogo Prefectural Government, and Kobe City Government this August. In this contest, I will guide students on leveraging Generative AI to refine their business ideas. This initiative is part of my ongoing efforts to inspire students through educational workshops focused on Gen-AI. I am deeply committed to advancing education with Gen-AI, and I welcome any connections from individuals interested in our work.
