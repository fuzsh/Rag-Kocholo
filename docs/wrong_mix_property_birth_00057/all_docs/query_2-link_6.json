        "text": "I have the impression the academic discipline may factor into this. I cannot recall ever reading a phrasing like your \"with\" examples in any STEM publication, but in the social sciences this may easily be different. From my limited experience with social sciences, many papers seem to have a bit more of a \"conversational\" tone to them, and your \"with\" examples would probably fit in more in such a style than with the fairly dry and reduced style of writing that is often preferred in STEM.\n\nThat said, what I have sometimes seen as a mixture, as in:\n\nConversely, researchers at the University of Gothenburg [1] have stated ...\n\nThat is, I have seen people mention the place where the research was conducted, but not the credentials. Obviously this would happen if it could have at least some tangential relevance where this research has been conducted. In your example, if the other researchers were outside of Sweden a reader may be inclined to put more trust into a statement on the Swedish welfare state from researchers actually working in Sweden versus people who only look at it from the outside. It goes without saying that this is simply not the case in most STEM publications (although, as I wrote, I have seen it come up very occasionally).\n\nI also have never seen in a literature review mentions of an author's credentials unless it is directly relevant to discussion. For example, during certain periods of time two different universities might have had different approaches to a philosophical orientation. In that case, noting where an individual was located at a given time might give some insight. So, an individual at the University of Chicago for Economics (neoclassical approach) might be contrasted with someone from the Austrian approach. So:\n\nJohn Smith [1], while lecturing at the University of Chicago, astounded his colleagues by suggesting massive federal expenditures.\n\nWithout some note about the UofC, the astonishment would not make much sense.\n\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines suggest that academic credentials are omitted. There is a blog post here where the guidance is that:\n\nTypically APA Style reference list entries and in-text citations do not include the authorsâ€™ academic credentials or professional titles.\n\nThis assertion is somewhat associated with section 2.02 (APA 6th edition). The MLA has similar guidlines.\n\nThere is a note that if the credentials \"are relevant to the discussion\" they may be included, which I think follows with my opening observation. This blog post on the MLA also suggests the omission of qualifications unless it directly makes a point:\n\nYou might, however, explain the qualifications of an author in the body of your essay if they are helpful in making your point or refuting a claim\n\nSo, based upon the OP's examples, the answer would be \"without\" as the titles and affiliation are not directly relevant to the discussion. The APA and MLA guidelines are in agreement on this point, I think."
