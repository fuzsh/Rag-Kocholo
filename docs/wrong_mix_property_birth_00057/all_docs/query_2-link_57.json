For example, it is usually preferable to list the title of the webpage article first if no author is available.\n\nHere is how to cite a webpage without an author in three of the most popular citation styles: APA 7, MLA 9, and Chicago (17th ed.).\n\nAPA 7\n\nReference Entry Template:\n\nTitle of webpage/article. (Year, Month Date of publication). In Website Name. URL\n\nReference Entry Example:\n\nGiant panda. (2022, June 29). In Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda\n\nWhen there isn’t a known author, use the source’s title in the in-text citation. For titles usually italicized in the reference entry (books, films, etc.), italicize the title in the in-text citation. For titles that aren’t italicized (magazine articles, reference book entries, etc.), enclose the title in double quotation marks.\n\nParenthetical Citation:\n\n(“Title,” Year) or (Title, Year)\n\n(“Giant Panda,” 2022)\n\nNarrative Citation:\n\n“Title” (Year) or (Title, Year)\n\n“Giant Panda” (2022)\n\nMLA 9\n\nWorks Cited Entry Template:\n\n“Title of the Webpage/Entry.” Title of the Website, Name of the publisher (if different from the website name), Date of publication, URL.\n\nExample:\n\n“Taiwan Cool to China Panda-plomacy.” CNN.com, 6 Jan. 2006, http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/01/06/china.taiwan.ap/index.html\n\nWhen there isn’t a known author, use the source’s title in the in-text citation. For titles usually italicized in the reference entry (books, films, etc.), italicize the title in the in-text citation. For titles that aren’t italicized (magazine articles, reference book entries, etc.), enclose the title in double quotation marks.\n\nCitation in Prose:\n\n“Title” (page number)\n\n“Taiwan Cool to China Panda-plomacy” says Taiwan may not accept the gift of two pandas (1).\n\nParenthetical Citation:\n\n(“Title” Page #) or (Title Page #)\n\nTaiwan may not accept the gift of two pandas (“Tawain Cool to China Panda-plomacy 1).\n\nChicago (17th ed., note-bibliography style)\n\nNote Template:\n\n“Article Title,” Website Title, Month Day, Year, URL.\n\nNote Example:\n\n“Taiwan Cool to China Panda-plomacy.” CNN.com, January 6, 2006, http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/01/06/china.taiwan.ap/index.html.\n\nBibliography Template:\n\n“Article Title.” Website Title. Month Day, Year. URL.\n\nBibliography Example:\n\n“Taiwan Cool to China Panda-plomacy.” CNN.com. January 6, 2006. http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/01/06/china.taiwan.ap/index.html.\n\nFor more citation help, visit the EasyBib Writing Center!"
