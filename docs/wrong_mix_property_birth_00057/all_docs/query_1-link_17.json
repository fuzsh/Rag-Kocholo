        "text": "It's a beautiful day I / II\n\nThe 90s saw a genre of music termed Shibuya-kei (\"Shibuya-esque\"). These works represent the rhythm and tone of that sound through geometrical motifs and use of color. Computer-generated rhythms, analog fluctuations and the feel of layers of sound have been recreated here in an abstract form.\n\nThese works represent Shibuya through the practically coalescing group of buildings in the city and the buildings soon to be completed. The parts that make up the walls of the buildings are drawn fluidly without taking on definite form.\n\nThese works depict Shibuya, an everchanging city, and its everchanging skyline. The countless primary colors used in these paintings represent the energies of the people who visit the city.\n\nARTIST\n\nEnlightment\n\nEnlightment\n\nENLIGHTENMENT is an artistic unit made up of Hiro Sugiyama in 1997. This artist unit consisting of Hiro Sugiyama, Yuta Nakajima, Mayu Yoshida, and Mayu Tsunoda.\n\nThe unit exhibits pieces at exhibitions in Japan and across the world in the fine arts space while also putting out free papers and art books.\n\nThey also continue to release their original graphics in the form of advertisements, magazines and CD jackets.\n\nHaving also received high praise for their audiovisual work such as music video production and video jockeying, ENLIGHTENMENT is creatively active across a broad range of spheres including three-dimensional pieces and spatial performance, in addition to two-dimensional work.\n\nSOUNDS OF SHIBUYA “J-POP”/ “HIPHOP”/ “TECHNO”/ “METAL”\n\nShibuya, the origin point of youth culture. All kinds of music come pouring out street shops, mixing with the noise of the streets to create the sounds of the Shibuya environment. It almost seems to symbolize the scramble of intersecting peoples, generations and values. The personalities of each person create the harmony and unity of strangeness and peculiarity which form the city we call Shibuya. For this event, I have created a series of four paintings that visualize the four genres of music that I imagine when I hear the words \"Sounds of Shibuya.\"\n\nARTIST\n\nDENPA\n\nDENPA\n\nBased on their \"no concept\" production philosophy, DENPA take an approach to art that seeks to abstractly express in naïve visual pleasure qualities and nuances that cannot be put into words. Based in their native Okinawa, they have held exhibitions in Brooklyn, New York, as well as locations across Japan, and are active worldwide, working with POW!WOW!, HAWAI, avex, Fujitsu and Yahoo! for their office mural.\n\n∞\n\nThis piece takes as its theme the well-known story of the faithful dog, Hachiko.\n\nThe time Hachiko spent as the loving companion of his owner, Hidesaburo Ueno, is said to have been barely 16 months, but the months and years followed Ueno's sudden death, when he would nevertheless come to Shibuya Station to wait for him, extended many times that to almost a full decade. My chest always tightens imagining what he must have felt.\n\nTired after his years of waiting, Hachiko, whose name is also the Japanese word for \"8,\" lay down one day, forming an \"∞\" shape, before crossing the Rainbow Bridge to the other side. He was then finally reunited with the person he loved most. I can only imagine how happy he must have been. This picture depicts just that moment. It is drawn in the hope that the two can be together forever in the next world.\n\nARTIST\n\nKeiji Ito\n\nKeiji Ito\n\nBorn in Tokyo in 1958, Ito has mainly been active as in graphic work and art direction. He has worked on visuals for Kirinji, Towa Tei, Scha Dara Parr, the Aichi World Expo 2005 official poster, NHK program title graphics and set designs, UK company Cravendale, and campaigns for Softbank.\n\nIto's work has been exhibited numerous times in Japan, such as at the \"VERDE COSMICO\" PACEL exhibition (Bakurocho). He is also actively involved in putting out art anthologies. He is a professor at the Kyoto University of the Arts and is the director of UFG.\n\nBorn in Tokyo in 1958, Ito has mainly been active as in graphic work and art direction.

He is a professor at the Kyoto University of the Arts and is the director of UFG.\n\nProfessor\n\nWhen we think of Hachiko, we tend to imagine the faithful dog who waited and waited for his owner, Professor Ueno. But Hachiko was also beloved by many other people, such as the mother of broadcast writer Fumio Takada , who would often feed him in Shibuya. So, some people like to say that far from waiting faithfully for the professor, Hachiko was just a dumb dog who came to Shibuya Station because people fed it. I cannot hide my excitement at the idea that this version of Hachiko wound up being cast in bronze and surviving to this day as the symbol of Shibuya. Hachiko the best boy!\n\nVestiges of the City\n\nhibuya seems to me like a city that is always under construction and where the culture of the city is always gradually changing.\n\nFinding vestiges that remain within this everchanging city is the archaeological fieldwork for Shibuya's street culture crowd, fieldwork that I think once again gives rise to new culture. This piece is created to visualize this feeling of being repainted from above while the things that remain entangle themselves while being connected to somewhere else.\n\nCarpe Diem Kekkai\n\nCarpe diem may be the antonym of memento mori, but put against each other back to back they mean the same thing. Let's eat drink and be merry! Let's value the time we call now and seize the beautiful day we call today. Because the world is an uncertain place.\n\nARTIST\n\nIchiro Tanida\n\nIchiro Tanida\n\nTanida has been active across a broad range of fields since the late 1980s, including as an illustrator, a graphic designer, a CG creator and an ad director. In 2022 he made his debut as a modern artist at the Akio Nagasawa Gallery. He is set to have a solo exhibition there in Fall of 2023.\n\nTanida has been active across a broad range of fields since the late 1980s, including as an illustrator, a graphic designer, a CG creator and an ad director.

I have enjoyed the culture of Shibuya since I was a high school student, be it the shopping, fashion or art. I also visit it as a place to communicate with friends. The many colorful windows of this piece invite the viewer to imagine the people gathering there, portraying a dream-like world at the intersection of the ordinary and extraordinary.\n\nNEUROMANCER\n\nIn the pit that is Shibuya a chaotic magic accumulates.\n\nIn the past the energy of that chaos would give rise spontaneously to new systems of values.\n\nBut amidst the new cityscape born of the redevelopment of Shibuya in recent years, I feel those magics have been driven out.\n\nRather than the new stories that come out of those jumbles of inorganic buildings, I am interested in the melting pot of energy that used to be here.\n\nAnd so, I have created this piece as a kind of requiem for that Shibuya.\n\nThe title comes from the William Gibson science fiction novel, which gave rise to the idea of cyberpunk.\n\nIf I had to put it into words, I would call it the Shibuya City Blues.\n\n\"The Wall\" SBY MIX 2023\n\nAs you walk around Shibuya you encounter works of graffiti and wall art. New pieces are painted again over the top of older ones. This piece samples those works of graffiti and recreates them on the canvas, before removing the color from the image to extract just the silhouettes of those motifs, expressing them in a more abstract form.\n\nPuzzle\n\nShibuya grows and develops like a living creature while emitting a signal from its own antenna. Even though I have long grown accustomed to the city, I still find myself getting lost in confusion amidst Shibuya's everchanging faces, wandering above and below ground as though through a puzzle while tracing out memories. I have attempted to visualize the image of the Shibuya that welcomes me in so carefree a manner not as a real city, but in a colorful way.\n\nARTIST\n\nMica Suga\n\nMica Suga\n\nBorn in Oita, Suga studied fashion illustration at Setsu Mode Seminar and etching at a lithography workshop. Inspired by fashion and design advertising and magazines, she became an illustrator. She now puts out her own work that spans genre boundaries as a form of self-expression. In addition to her works incorporating collages using traditional Japanese tissue paper (washi) for engravings, her art is also defined by direct expressions of people and imaginary landscapes using acrylics and oils. Her work has a running theme of mystery and illogicality.\n\nBorn in Oita, Suga studied fashion illustration at Setsu Mode Seminar and etching at a lithography workshop.

Holding my first private exhibition here, I also encountered like-minded people.\n\nI hope that Shibuya is able to continue to be a place where cultures and people can mingle.\n\nThrough this piece I have attempted to visualize a city constantly emitting bracing light that inspires bright futures.\n\nDiagram of a Quantum Garden - Shibuya, Tokyo\n\nThis work takes as its themes \"space\" and \"gardens.\" It is an image of a Shibuya garden that draws inspiration from quantum physics. The painting suggests that in the \"bit valley\" of Shibuya, where all manner of information and all kinds of people's workings intersect day and night, a multiplicity of realities exist. The artist hopes that as the new stories of people from across the world who visit Shibuya recur, the future continues to be born.\n\nARTIST\n\nChizuko Ninomiya\n\nChizuko Ninomiya\n\nChizuko Ninomiya initially studied law as a student before working as a systems engineer at a financial institution, before being active as a contemporary artist.\n\nWhile mobile devices have become pervasive and telecommunications networks have been established, giving people more opportunity than even to encounter images that are the result of processing by digital systems, consciousness of the systems and processes behind those images remains largely absent.\n\nIn recent years, she has reconstructed and presented programming languages and processing as art pieces, turning her attention to themes of \"casting light on unseen things\" at the same time as looking at the \"ethics/ideology (of a technology-wielding humanity).\"\n\nHewing to the idea that the history of art is inseparable from the history of technology, Ninomiya produces works that act as hooks into the near future, incorporating elements of the exponentially advancing technology of our day while commenting on human ethics.\n\nChizuko Ninomiya initially studied law as a student before working as a systems engineer at a financial institution, before being active as a contemporary artist.\n\nWhile mobile devices have become pervasive and telecommunications networks have been established, giving people more opportunity than even to encounter images that are the result of processing by digital systems, consciousness of the systems and processes behind those images remains largely absent.\n\nIn recent years, she has reconstructed and presented programming languages and processing as art pieces, turning her attention to themes of \"casting light on unseen things\" at the same time as looking at the \"ethics/ideology (of a technology-wielding humanity).\"\n\nHewing to the idea that the history of art is inseparable from the history of technology, Ninomiya produces works that act as hooks into the near future, incorporating elements of the exponentially advancing technology of our day while commenting on human ethics.\n\nCity of Evolution\n\nWhile the graffiti, stickers and taggings you see all around the streets of Shibuya continue to be chaotically overwritten atop one another, viewed observationally over a long span of time, they can be read as stored up \"street history.\" My own work, with its overlapping random images, bears a resemblance to it. This piece expresses a Shibuya that is a city at the apex of \"time and the accumulation of history\" as a \"crystallization of human progress and wisdom.\" In making this piece, I walked around the center of Shibuya at night, gathering the \"lights\" emitted from advertisements, neon signs and construction sites, sampling them in my own work. In the culture that colors this place, I feel an energy that progresses beyond the city, beyond nations and beyond time.\n\nARTIST\n\nsnAwk\n\nsnAwk\n\nsnAwk graduated from the Visual Arts program at the Emily Carr University of Arts + Design (Vancouver, Canada).
