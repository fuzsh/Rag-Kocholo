        "text": "When you refer to the words and ideas of others within your own research MLA style requires you to give credit by using an in-text citation (also known as “imbedded” or “parenthetical” citation) within the text of your paper.\n\nMLA requires the use of an in-text citation whether you put the words of others in your own words (paraphrase) or state them exactly as found in the original source (direct quote).\n\nThe in-text citation should occur in the sentence where the cited material has been used:\n\nSignal phrase reference (author's name) appears within the sentence with page number in parentheses at the end of the sentence\n\nFull parenthetical reference (author last name and page number) appears at the end of the sentence\n\nRemember that all sources mentioned within in-text citations in your paper must have a corresponding full bibliographic citation in your Works Cited list.\n\nIn-text citations generally contain the author’s last name (surname) and page location of cited material placed within parentheses at the end of a sentence.\n\nFull In-text citation\n\nStart with the surname of the author (or editor, translator, compiler, etc.). When referring to a particular part of a work, follow the surname by a space and a page number or numbers.\n\nExample: This psychological phenomenon has been previously demonstrated (Smith 178-85).\n\nUsing a signal phrase\n\nIf you introduce the cited material with a signal phrase (including the author’s last name within the sentence), omit the surname from the parentheses.\n\nExample: Smith demonstrates this psychological phenomenon (22-24).\n\nStandard punctuation\n\nStandard sentence punctuation should be placed after the parenthetical citation.\n\nExamples:\n\nCan we allow ourselves to trust Frank’s Dramatic Theory of Cause and Effect (73-74)?\n\nThere are ways to document this “overwhelming need for self-study” (Jones 18).\n\nDirect quotes with special punctuation\n\nFor a direct quote with specific punctuation associated with it, include that punctuation mark within the quotation marks followed by the parenthetical citation and end the sentence with proper punctuation.\n\nExample: In response, Mary replies, “what, no more fighting?” (Blackwell 43).\n\nWhen citing more than four lines of quoted material, position the quoted section as a separate or \"block\" set of lines.\n\nIndent the entire quoted section one half inch from the left margin: do not further intent the first line of the section.\n\nPunctuate the sentence introducing the quote with a colon and do not use quotation marks.\n\nAt the end of the last sentence of the block quote, use parentheses to identify page number(s) of the quoted material. If the author's name is not included as a signal phrase in the introductory sentence, include it in the parentheses, as well.\n\nExample: In Song of the Lark, Willa Cather demonstrates her ability to create detailed interior spaces in the first page of the novel with the description of the physician's office:\n\nThe waiting-room was carpeted and stiffly furnished, something like a country parlor. The study had worn, unpainted floors, but there was a look of winter comfort about it. The doctor’s flat-top desk was large and well made; the papers were in orderly piles, under glass weights. Behind the stove a wide bookcase, with double glass doors, reached from the floor to the ceiling.It was filled with medical books of every thickness and color. On the top shelf stood a long row of thirty or forty volumes, bound all alike in dark mottled board covers, with imitation leather backs. (3)\n\nCiting Works by Two Authors\n\nList all surnames, separating two authors with “and.”\n\nExamples: Griff and Blum offer a fresh reading of this novel (242).\n\nThis novel recently drew critical attention (Talbot and Smith 22).\n\nCiting Works by Three or More Authors\n\nList the first author's last name followed by et al. (with a period).\n\nExamples: Some critics consider this work to be Hawthorne's most gothic tale (Blaine et al. 75).\n\nIt has been said by Fredensen et al. that global warning is the biggest threat to our planet (45).\n\nWhen a source does not have a stated author, the Works Cited entry will begin with the title of the source. For the in text citation, either state the entire name of the source as a signal phrase, or use a part of the phrase in parentheses.\n\nExample: There is evidence that as many as 40% of all elementary students experience some type of bullying (\"Saving our Schools\")."
