        "text": "Alize Cornet is a professional tennis player who competes on the WTA Tour. She played her last match at the 2024 French Open, going down to seventh seed Qinwen Zheng in the first round.\n\nWhat Grand Slam record does Alize Cornet hold?\n\nAlize Cornet holds the record for most consecutive appearances in a Grand Slam main draw among the women. By competing in the 2022 US Open, she made her 63rd consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearance, breaking the record of 62 held by Ai Sugiyama.\n\nThe Frenchwoman has since extended that record to 69 by playing all the majors upto the 2024 French Open, which she announced would be her final tournament as a professional.\n\nis alize cornet Retired?\n\nYes. Alize Cornet announced that she would be retiring from tennis after Roland-Garros. On May 28, 2024, the Frenchwoman lost her opening round match at the 2024 French Open to seventh seed Qinwen Zheng in the first round 6-2, 6-1 to put an end to her playing career.\n\nWhat did Alize Cornet accomplish at Wimbledon 2022?\n\nAlizé Cornet defeated Iga Swiatek in the third round of Wimbledon 2022, 6-4, 6-2, snapping the world No 1’s 37-match winning streak. This marked the second time she beat a world No 1 at Wimbledon, having also beaten Serena Williams at the All England Club in 2014. Cornet’s run ended in the fourth round to Ajla Tomljanovic in a three-set battle.\n\nWhere is AlizE Cornet from?\n\nAlizé Cornet was born on January 22, 1990, in Nice. It was there that she began playing tennis at the age of 4. She lives with her partner, Michael Kujaz, who used to be her coach. She is 5ft 7in (1.73m) tall.\n\nWhen did she begin her career?\n\nCornet made her professional debut in 2006, a few months after revealing herself to the public at Roland-Garros in 2005. Aged 15 and given a wildcard into the event, she beat Russian Alina Jidkova for her first win on the Tour. She lost her following match against her idol Amélie Mauresmo.\n\nWho coaches Cornet?\n\nCornet was most recently coached by Pierre Arfi. She was coached by the former Polish player Sandra Zaniewska (career-best ranking of No 142) from December 2019 until July 2023. She was also previously coached by Georges Goven, Pierre Bouteyre and Laurent Orsini.\n\nWhat is her favourite surface?\n\nClay is the surface on which she can express her game the best, with her heavy, topspin forehand, variety and court coverage. In Rome in 2008, she scored her first major coup, after victories over Svetlana Kuznetsova and Anna Chakvetadze.\n\nWhat are her best victories?\n\nCornet is a giant-killer. Capable of highs and lows, she owns 25 wins over top 10 players in her career. Most notable of all, she has beaten Serena Williams three times, including in the third round at Wimbledon in 2014, and in 2022 she added Swiatek to that tally. Agnieszka Radwanska, Simona Halep and Angelique Kerber have all fallen victim to her talents.\n\nHow many titles has Cornet won?\n\nAlizé Cornet has won six trophies from 15 finals. Four of them were on clay (Budapest in 2008, Bad Gastein in 2012, Strasbourg in 2013, Gstaad in 2018) and two on hard courts (Katowice in 2014 and Hobart in 2016). The 30-year-old has also won three doubles titles.\n\nNot forgetting Fed Cup winning the Fed Cup in 2019 in Australia alongside Kristina Mladenovic, Caroline Garcia, Fiona Ferro and Pauline Parmentier under the captaincy of Julien Benneteau. It was during this campaign that she picked up her best victory, against the Belgian Elise Mertens.\n\nWhat is her best result at a Grand Slam?\n\nCornet reached her first Grand Slam quarter-final at the 2022 Australian Open. The Frenchwoman scored wins over Viktoriya Tomova, world No 3 Garbiñe Muguruza, 29th seed Tamara Zidansek, and 14th seed Simona Halep to reach the last eight at a Major on her 63rd attempt. She was defeated by American Danielle Collins in the quarter-finals.\n\nShe has made the last 16 at all the four Majors at least once in her career.\n\nWhat is Cornet’s best ranking?\n\nAlizé Cornet reached world No 11 in February 2009 after making the quarter-finals of the Open GDF Suez. You can find her current ranking and rankings history on her WTA Tour profile page.\n\nIs Alize Cornet on social media?\n\nOn her Instagram account, Alizé Cornet shares her tennis and travel snaps with 156,000 followers. On Twitter, she is followed by close to 171,200 people.\n\nWhat are her passions ?\n\nOne passion kept her particularly busy during lockdown; writing. Her first book was published in September 2020, just before the start of Roland-Garros (September 27-October 13)."
