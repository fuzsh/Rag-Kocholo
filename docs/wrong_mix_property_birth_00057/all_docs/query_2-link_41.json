        "text": "In some cases a numbered style is used and one needs to mention the author of one of the references. As an example, suppose you want to write the following sentence:\n\n\"In a recent paper Darwin et al discovered that monkeys eat bananas (12).\"\n\nWhere the references are listed in a numbered style, something like:\n\n11. ....\n\n12. Darwin C., Wallace, A.R., Moneys eat bananas. PLoS Biol 2016; 14.\n\n13. ...\n\nIn that sentence it would be very useful if it would be possible to cite the author (or author + year) automatically, avoiding manual typing (and thus errors). Is there such a possibility?"
