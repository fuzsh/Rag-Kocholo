        "text": "Do you want to include a website in your APA 7 style paper, but it has no author? How you cite a website in APA with no author is to use the article’s title instead. Although it is acceptable to include information from sources with no author listed in your APA website citation, make sure it at least comes from a reliable website, such as a government entity, university, or reputable organization.\n\nHow To Reference a Website With No Author Name Listed – APA 7th Edition\n\nOnline citations in APA style have four different components: the author, date, title, publisher, and URL. Many times, especially in local newspapers, articles are printed as staff articles or without any author’s name listed. If you do not know the author’s name or the article’s date, you can still cite a webpage in your APA 7 style reference list by using the title of the article.\n\nTitle of the article. (year, Month day). News Organization. URL (no period after the URL)\n\nAPA News Website With No Author – Reference List Example\n\nConcert raises thousands for earthquake victims. (2019, August 9). The News Review. http://www.news-ridgecrest.com/news/story.pl?id=0000010343\n\n500,000 Oregon residents evacuate statewide due to wildfires. (2020, September 10). HuffPost. https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oregon-residents-evacuations-wildfire\n\nAPA Journal Website With No Author – Reference List Example\n\nLanguage learning with the unique language used today. (2019, August 20). Psychological Review, 1-15. http://www.psychologyreview.org/language_learning_as_language_us\n\nAPA Magazine Website With No Author – Reference List Example\n\nNote: The style of the title follows the format it would take without the author missing. Therefore, it includes italics or no italics as needed. Online newspaper articles with a print version follow the format of a magazine.\n\nCiting a Website With No Author & No Date – APA\n\nWhen making an APA website citation with no author and date, you use n.d., which means no date, in the place of the year.\n\nTitle of the publication. (n.d.). Website. URL\n\nAPA Website No Author, No Date – Reference List Example\n\nFREE MLA & APA citation generator (n.d.). Bibliography.com. http://bibliography.com\n\nHow to Cite a Website With an Anonymous Author – APA\n\nAnother situation you might encounter in your APA research paper citations is an anonymous author of a website. Rather than listing the title as you would for no author, you use “anonymous” as your author.\n\nAnonymous. (Date). Title. Publication. URL\n\nAPA Citation for a Website Anonymous Author – Reference List Example\n\nAnonymous. (n.d.). Understanding the human brain. Psychology Today. https://www.psychologytoday.com/understanding_the_human_brain/\n\nHow to In-Text Cite a Website With No Author – APA\n\nWhen creating an in-text citation in APA without an author, you use the title. For the in-text citation, use only the first few words if it’s a long title. Use the full title if it’s a shorter title.\n\nIn-Text Citation Example for APA No Author\n\n(Concert Raises Thousands, 2019)\n\n(“Language Learning,” 2019)\n\nIn-Text Citation Example for Anonymous\n\n(Anonymous, 2020)\n\nNote: Italicize in-text citations in APA that are italicized in the reference list. Quotations go around entries that are not italicized, like magazine articles, per section 8.14 of the APA manual. Additionally, in-text citations use title case.\n\nAPA Citations for Online Articles With Organization Author\n\nFor some websites, the organization is the author of the article. In this case, you’ll include the organization’s name for the author in your APA citations.\n\nReference List Example for Organization Author\n\nExperis. (2019, August 1). 20 Tips for great job interviews. https://www.experisjobs.us/exp_us/en/career-advice/20-tips-job-interviews.htm\n\nIf there is no date available, use n.d. in place of the year.\n\nExperis. (n.d.). 20 Tips for great job interviews. https://www.experisjobs.us/exp_us/en/career-advice/20-tips-job-interviews.htm\n\nIn-Text Citation Examples for Organization Authors\n\nTips for Evaluating Online Articles\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re writing a short essay or a long research paper; you can use online articles with no authors as sources. Just be sure to include reliable primary and secondary sources to back up your research. Therefore, your research should focus on finding authoritative sources.\n\nOne way to establish authority is to inspect the author’s name and professional background. For example, if an article describes how to treat a medical condition, you would undoubtedly want to know the author’s credentials before following any advice.\n\nAlthough you may find articles with no author listed on reputable sites, it is better to establish the authority of your article by using sources written by established authors. If you find a random article that seems “formula” created with no listed author or references, bypass that source and choose a better one for your APA format paper.\n\nNo Author, No Problem"
