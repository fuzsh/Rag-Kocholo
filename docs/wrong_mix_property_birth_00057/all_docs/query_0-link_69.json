Hall ANN ARBOR * UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PRESS 1954\n\nPage IV Copyright, 1954 by University of Michigan\n\nEditor's Foreword on the Bibliographical Series\n\npp. v-vi\n\nPage V EDITOR'S FOREWORD ON THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SERIES The Bibliographical Series of the Center for Japanese Studies has for its main purpose the listing and evaluating of the major Japanese works pertaining to the humanities and social sciences, particularly as they deal with Japan and the areas immediately adjacent to Japan. It is assumed that Western materials pertaining to Japan are adequately covered in the bibliographies of Pages, von Wenckstern, Nachod, Praesent-Haenisch, Pritchard, Gaskill, etc., and that Western specialists in the several fields will know how to get at the Western materials in their respective fields. The bibliographies in the present series are intended to serve as an introduction to the native research materials in the several disciplines and hence as an aid to research for teachers and students. In each case an attempt has been made to describe or to evaluate each work that is listed, or at least to justify the inclusion of each item. The authors have also attempted to indicate the American libraries at which each item may be found. Scholars and librarians will perhaps find that the several bibliographies in this series will serve as useful guides to buying programs which they may wish to initiate. The bibliographies are selective. Each item listed is believed to be of some value or interest to the scholarly user. In those cases in which it has been impossible to examine a book or article of known value, it still is included. A book or article is thus included if it is written by a competent scholar, if it is included in a bibliography which is itself competently compiled, if it appears to treat its subject matter in detail and with an approach to completeness, if it is frequently quoted, if it is well reviewed, or if it is referred to as being authoritative. Wherever possible, notes as to why an item seems to be of value have been given. The scope of each bibliography is defined by the compiler or compilers in their introductions, but in general each of the bibliographies lists (a) important source materials, and (b) secondary sources dating from a fixed date in the recent past, as, for instance, the Meiji Restoration, 1900, 1910, etc. Although the materials in most cases deal with the Japanese islands, each compiler has set the limits of the geographical area which his materials cover. In certain cases expansion into areas that are outside Japan appears to be justified by the fact that Japanese research has been the dominant research for these areas. Hence one or more of the bibliographies will cover Japanese materials on Formosa, Korea, Manchuria, and the Mandated Islands. The format is uniform within each volume. In general the name of each author or compiler is given both in romanization and characters. The surnames are given first and the given names next, as the practice is in Japan. The names of corporate authors, such as government offices, are given in romanization and characters; they are then translated. The title of each book or article is given in romanization and characters; it is then translated. The place of publication and the name of the publisher are given in romanization alone, but a separate listing within each bibliography gathers together the names of the publishers, with the characters used in writing their names. 1. Long a, o, and u are indicated by macrons over the vowels. 2. Only the first letters of initial words and proper nouns are capitalized. 3. In the bibliographical data, the compilers have given both the edition and the printing of the work cited. Significant textual variations sometimes occur between different printings of the same edition of a given work. 4. When dealing with an item composed of one volume, complete pagination is given for that volume, including all separately paged sections. If any titlb is in more than one volume, only the total number of volumes is given, without paging. 5. In the event that the item cited happens to be part of a series or collection, the compilers have given in brackets introduced by an equals sign the title, characters, and translated title of that series or collection and the number of the volume concerned. 6. The location of each item in American libraries is shown by means of the symbols used in the Union List of Serials. The symbols for the major libraries concerned are as follows: CCC - Claremont Colleges CSt - Stanford General Library Cst-H - Hoover War Library CtY - Yale CU - University of California DLC - Library of Congress ICU - Chicago IEN - Northwestern MH - Harvard MiU - Michigan NN - New York Public Library NNC - Columbia WaU - University of Washington 7. Works such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, yearbooks, series, and collections are cited by title; the name of the editor or compiler, in romanization and characters, is usually given after the title. 8. In the case of articles found in journals, quotation marks surround the Japanese title, characters, and translated title. 9. Abbreviations are explained in lists, if necessary. v\n\nPage VI 10. If any volume of a journal is continuously paged, number and month may be omitted. If it has both continuous volume pagination and separate pagination for each issue, only the volume, year, and the continuous volume pagination may be given. If more than one volume appears in any single year, and each is separately and continuously paged, the procedure has been to give the volume, inclusive months of the issues in the volume, year, and continuous volume pagination. 11. In the case of a single article comprising a chapter or a section of a book which is a compilation of articles by a number of authors, this fact is shown by inserting the word \"in\" between the title of the article and compilation in which it is found. Following the \"in,\" a complete citation of the book in question is given. 12. All descriptions, evaluations, criticisms, and comments pertaining to a volume or article follow the citations in separate, indented paragraphs. These may include brief biographies of the authors or compilers, but only one biography per author or compiler is given in each bibliography. Cross-references from one citation to another are used to call attention to comments, biographies, etc. 13. A list of the standard professional journals is given whenever found to be convenient. The following remarks may interest the growing number of scholars who are concerned with the problem of publishing materials in the lesser known fields, in which the number of copies to be distributed is necessarily small and in which special problems, such as the one here faced of giving names and titles in characters, must be met. An electric typewriter was first used to type the materials in romanization. The characters were then written in, in spaces left for the purpose. The over-all dimensions of the typed area was 10 by 14 and 1/2 inches. This was reduced to the present size in photographing the pages. The photographs thus taken were then made the basis for reproduction by offset process. Except in the case of the introductory material, no attempt was made to justify the right-hand margins. Joseph K. Yamagiwa Note on John W. Hall's Japanese History: a Guide to Japanese Reference and Research Materials Users of the present work will find that Professor Hall is a historian who takes a wide-angle view of his subject. He has thus listed the principal bibliographies, reference works, anthologies, periodicals, and survey histories for such fields as geography, government, law, economics, education, religion, literature, art, and science. Students in all these areas, as well as historians proper, will-it is hoped-welcome this volume. Since the inception of this bibliographical series, Far Eastern libraries in the United States have made substantial additions to their Japanese collections. Because of the rapidity with which these materials are still being acquired, it is no longer possible to indicate for each of the items listed in any bibliography the libraries which own it. The present series will therefore discontinue the practice of indicating these libraries. J. K. Y. vi\n\nAuthor's Introduction\n\npp. vii-viii\n\nPage VII AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION A glance through the shelves of the major Japanese collections in the United States will reveal a great preponderance of works in the historical field. The student of Japanese history, first approaching these collections, is likely to find himself overwhelmed by the vast resources in reference works, source materials, and scholarly studies of all varieties which confront him. Since World War II, with the rapid expansion of Japanese library facilities in this country, and the increased use of Japanese materials by American scholars, the need for a bibliographical guide to Japanese publications in the field of history has become acute. It was with this need in mind that the present work was undertaken. In view of the scope and complexity of the subject, it has not been feasible to compile a single-volume guide which would cover all aspects of Japanese history to the satisfaction of the specialist. It was determined, therefore, for the purposes of the bibliographical series being published by the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of Michigan, to divide the field of history into several parts. The present volume, which is the first to appear, comprises a general introduction covering reference aids, published sources, scholarly journals, and a selected offering of survey literature of recent origin. This introductory volume will not attempt to discuss primary sources, pre-modern historical writings, or periodical articles. Such detailed coverage will be left to later volumes which will confine themselves to smaller segments of Japanese history. In preparing this work for the non-specialist the greatest problems which the writer has confronted have been those of selection and balance: selection which would make this work a guide of manageable size rather than a mere book-list; balance which would afford an impartial coverage of the many subjects embraced within the historical field. The writer realizes acutely the difficulties of achieving either of these goals. He is aware that a compilation of this nature cannot avoid numerous errors both of fact and judgment. The specialist in each field will discover much to disagree with either in the choice of entries or in the prefaces and annotations. Unfortunately, a bibliography is at best a perishable commodity. As the work is being labored over new publications make many of the entries obsolete. A further balance is enforced upon the compiler, a balance between bibliographical perfection and currency or utility. In this introductory volume the emphasis has been placed upon utility. For its inadequacies the writer asks the indulgence of the reader and sincerely solicits his suggestions and comments. Since it is proposed eventually to revise the several bibliographies published separately in the Bibliographical Series of the Center for Japanese Studies and to combine them into a coordinated whole, any suggestions which the reader may care to offer will be doubly welcome. In compiling this work the writer has attempted constantly to keep in mind the needs of the general non-specialist in the field of Japanese history. In selecting entries he has above all sought to avoid works of a technical or restricted nature. Since other bibliographies in this series will cover the contemporary period, emphasis has been placed upon reference works and historical surveys covering the pre-1868 phase of Japanese history, with only a minimum coverage devoted to the more recent period. Generally, works dealing with only a limited period of history have also been eliminated. However, in fields in which adequate survey literature is non-existent, outstanding works of limited scope have been included. Finally, works of recent appearance have been given general priority over those of earlier origin. This is not only because such recent works appear to offer more to the contemporary scholar but because more adequate guides to the earlier materials are available. While thus limiting the amount of detail contained within the individual sections of this volume, the author has attempted to interpret the scope of the field of history broadly so as to embrace as wide a variety of subjects as possible within both the social sciences and humanities. Such an approach to history, it was felt, was especially necessary when dealing with a people as alien to us as the Japanese. Where political, social, economic, cultural, and religious traditions differ markedly from our own, the historian must inquire more widely into the entire fabric of the past if he is to understand the factors of causation or bring his subject to life. It is hoped also that this more inclusive approach to the many facets of Japanese historiography will better serve to impress the reader with the breadth and variety of the work of Japanese historians. Organization of materials has naturally presented a major problem. In arranging the following works, the writer decided against the adoption of some rigid scheme approved either by Japanese or Western bibliographers, but permitted the categories to take shape as entries were collected. This has resulted in a somewhat unorthodox grouping of subjects but one which, it is believed, will be more useful to the active research worker. While the process of selection and organization is in itself a form of evaluation, the writer has sought to go farther by providing, through introductory comments and individual annotations, information for the guidance of the research worker. The task of annotation has been made especially difficult in two ways. First of all, the writer can claim to have specialized knowledge of only a few of the many sub-fields included in this work. Secondly, it has been physically impossible even to glance through all of the material listed. Thus, although the writer has attempted whenever possible to base his bibliographic data and annotations on direct observation, he has had to rely to a considerable extent on standard bibliographic materials or guides to historical literature, and on the advice of native experts. This procedure has made unavoidable the inclusion of a certain percentage of unannotated or even incomplete entries (since Japanese bibliographies seldom provide complete bibliographical information). It has furthermore greatly magnified the possibility of error both in bibliographic data and in the evaluations. The writer is especially aware of the difficulty of securing impartial judgment on works of the postwar period. With the Japanese academic world split rather sharply into conflicting schools of interpretation, many of the most recent guides to historical literature have revealed deep-seated biases. vii\n\nPage VIII A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS A final difficulty of a more technical nature involves two problems of romanization. One of these is the question of how to split or combine the long compound words employed by the Japanese, and in particular what to do with terminal elements such as shi (history), ko (treatise), or ron (essay). The general practice adopted below has been to split long compounds into as small segments as possible but to assimilate dangling elements without the use of hyphens (thus bunkashi, not bunka shi or bunka-shi). A more frustrating problem has been the lack of consistency in the romanizations employed by Japanese publishers when they themselves provide romanized titles. In most instances of this kind the publishers' romanization has been ignored for the sake of consistency. In a few cases, however, chiefly in the section on periodicals, where customary romanizations have become established, such spellings have been retained and enclosed in parentheses.. (Thus \"Zinbun\" and \"Nippon-Rekishi,\" not Jimbun and Nihon rekishi). The research on which this work is based was conducted over the course of several years. During the spring of 1951, the writer, with the aid of graduate students of 'the Center for Japanese Studies, made use of the Japanese collection at the University of Michigan together with standard Japanese historical bibliographies to lay a foundation for the project. In the summer of the same year a research grant from the Center of Japanese Studies and a travel grant from the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies enabled the writer to visit the major Japanese collections in this country, principally those at Harvard University, Columbia University, the Library of Congress, the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, and the Hoover Institute and Library on War, Revolution and Peace. Further work was done on the bibliography during the course of the writer's residence in Japan from February of 1952 to January, 1953. During this rather lengthy and diverse process of compilation, the writer has incurred an indebtedness to numerous individuals. For helpful suggestions and kind assistance in facilitating library search, the writer is grateful to Mr. Robert T. Paine, Jr. and Mr. K. Tomita of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Professor Serge Elisseeff and Dr. Kai-ming Chiu of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, Mr. Edwin Beal of the Library of Congress, Professor Donald H. Shively of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Nobutake Ike of the Hoover Library. While the writer was in Japan, Messrs. Kanai Madoka and Sugiyama Hiroshi of the Tokyo University Historiographical Institute painstakingly went over the manuscript and cards and made valuable suggestions and recommendations. Professor Kaji Shinzo of Tokyo University also gave freely of his time to help in facilitating this bibliographic project. On the University of Michigan campus the writer wishes to acknowledge the inspiration received from the first volume in the present Bibliographic Series, the work by Professor Robert E. Ward. For their efforts in reading the completed manuscript and offering valuable criticisms the writer wishes to thank Professor Sumio Taniguchi and Mr. Raymond Nunn. Finally a debt of gratitude goes to the editor of this series, Professor Joseph K. Yamagiwa, for his critical editorial suggestions and his careful review of the manuscript, and to the director of the Center for Japanese Studies, Professor Robert B. Hall, for his support and constant encouragement of the project. J.W.H.

BIBLIOGRAPHIES The historian is fortunate in having at his disposal a large number of bibliographical reference works covering the entire range of Japanese history. His chief problem is that of selecting from these an adequate number of aids which will offer easy and reasonably complete access to the sources in which he is interested. Naturally the number of works he consults will depend upon the degree of completeness which he desires. But a certain minimum number will be imperative if he is to achieve more than superficial coverage of his field. Since working bibliographies generally grow as research progresses, the historian will wish to begin by selecting secondary works in his field which contain useful bibliographical notes or appendices. If his topic is sufficiently broad, he, may find one of the recent \"introductions\" to Japanese history, such as T6yama Shigeki's Nihonshi kenkyu nyumon (Introduction to the study of Japanese history) (Entry 683) the place to start. This work discusses the significant literature on the major aspects of Japanese history. With the third edition it also appends an excellent introductory list of books and articles chosen for the historian whose special interest is in the social sciences. Many of the standard histories of Japan listed in Part V, Chapter 2 of this guide contain bibliographical references. Of these, the earlier works tend to cite primary sources while those written since the middle thirties more often refer to secondary materials. In the first group Kuroita Katsumi's Kokushi no kenkyu (The study of Japanese history) (Entry 25) and the seven-volume Sogo Nihonshi taikei (Synthetic survey of Japanese history) (Entry 748) are outstanding. Of the mnore recent prewar works Heibonsha's Nihonshi (History of Japan) (Entry 739), Mikasa Shobo's Nihon rekishi sensho (Complete series on Japanese history) (Entry 737), and Chijin Shokan's Taikan Nihon bunkashi zensho (Survey of Japanese cultural history series) (Entry 749) are most consistent and generous in their bibliographical citations. A postwar series, still in the process of publication, has the advantage of containing the results of most recent Japanese historical scholarship. This multivolume work entitled Nihon rekishi koza (Japanese history series) (Entry 734) is issued by Kawade Shobo. Individual articles vary, but in general they are consistent in their citation of selected readings. For more limited subjects a starting point will be found in the specialized monographs listed in Part V, Chapters 3 through 12 of this book. Specific recommendations will be found in the introductory passages to these chapters. It will also be noted that the entries in certain of the historical dictionaries conclude with bibliographical recommendations. While these are never exhaustive, they indicate the best-known sources for any given subject and therefore constitute a convenient starting point for further research. The new Heibonsha's Sekai rekishi jiten (Encyclopedia of world history) (Entry 232) when complete will constitute the best such source. The articles on Japanese historical subjects in this work are written by the most active postwar historians and contain up-to-date bibliographical citations. After acquainting himself with the above survey literature, the scholar will be ready to begin in earnest the augmentation of his bibliography through reference to the standard bibliographical guides listed in the next three chapters. Here his task will divide itself rather sharply into two distinct phases. His most immediate problem will be to gain access to the latest and most authoritative products of contemporary Japanese scholarship. But having done this, and wishing to pursue his subject farther, he will find it necessary to turn to the primary sources themselves. No single bibliographical guide will answer both of these needs. Instead, the scholar will find that each phase of his bibliographical task involves a number of separate problems, the first of which is that of acquiring familiarity with bibliographies of bibliographies. 1. BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES Works devoted exclusively to the listing of Japanese bibliographies are not numerous. Furthermore those which exist are, for the most part, incomplete or obsolete. For information on bibliographies published prior to 1933, the historian will find two works of special value. Amano Keitar-'s Hompo shoshi no shoshi (A bibliography of Japanese bibliographies) (Entry 1) is a standard classified but unannotated list of bibliographical literature published from ancient times to 1932. It is especially complete in its coverage of bibliographies published since the Restoration. To this should be added the essay by the French Japanologist, Emile Gaspardone, entitled \"Les bibliographies japonaises\" (Entry 2), written in 1933. This essay classifies and evaluates the major catalogues and bibliographies of pre-Restoration history, geography, religion, literature, etc. For bibliographical literature published after 1933 the historian's problem is more complicated. Nearly all of the standard types of bibliography listed in the succeeding Sections a through d contain lists of book catalogues, and bibliographies. The specialist, depending upon the nature of his research problem, will need to consult some or all of these more general publications. Guides to their use are suggested in the introductory paragraphs which follow. 1. Amano Keitaro f ff & *;ip, Hompo shoshi no shoshi # fp -t 7 ^.- (A bibliography of Japanese bibliographies), Tokyo, Osaka, Mamiya Shoten, 1933, 370 pp. The single most important work in this field, now considerably out-dated. It covers all bibliographical literature from ancient times through 1932. Part one is devoted to pre-Restoration bibliographies and book lists, part two to materials published after 1868. The second part is extensively classified. Late entries are added as a supplement and not integrated with the main body of the work. Bibliographic entries are for the most part unannotated and are frequently incomplete. Subject and author indexes are provided.\n\nPage 2 2 A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS 2. Gaspardone, Emile, \"Les bibliographies japonaises,\" Bulletin de la Maison Franco-Japonaise, v.4, 1933, pp. 29-116. A bibliographical essay especially important for its coverage of materials on pre-Restoration history, religion and literature. The essay is divided into nine sections: 1) general indexes, 2) periodical publications, 3) biography, 4) history, 5) geography, 6) economics and law, 7) language and linguistics, 8) religion, and 9) literature. More specialized fields such as mathematics, astronomy, and calligraphy are treated in an appendix. Because the author has attempted to present his bibliographical information in a smooth literary style, his citations are often left incomplete. 3. Hoshino Ko - X +-, Shigaku sosetsu ~ ' If jf (Collected historical essays), Tokyo, Fuzambo, r.-, 1909, 2v. 776+774 pp. v.1, pp. 559-775 contains an important essay on annotated bibliographies of pre-Restoration works. 2. GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHIES For access to contemporary historical literature the historian will find three general annotated bibliographies of indispensable service. The most extended in its coverage of fields is the work by Hatano and Yayoshi entitled KenkyU chosa sanko bunken soran (General survey of reference works for study and research) (Entry 8). This work covers the entire range of Japanese scholarship although its citations are limited largely to standard reference works and basic texts. More specifically historical in scope is Kurita Motoji's Sogo kokushi kenkyu (General guide for research in Japanese history) (Entry 24). Most entries in this work are annotated, and the various sections are provided with extensive introductory paragraphs full of bibliographical recommendations. Of outstanding importance, especially for the historian with the social science point of view, is the bibliographical series edited by Honj- Eijiro, Nihon keizaishi bunken (Bibliography of Japanese economic history) and its two successor volumes (Entries 10, 11, and 12). These bibliographies interpret economic history in its broadest sense and include nearly all subjects exclusive of literature and fine arts. Their value is immeasurably increased by the inclusion of references to a large number of periodical articles in addition to books. Entries which cite books are annotated. While the above works will suffice for most purposes, they none the less have severe limitations. All three are selective and tend to be arbitrary in their choice of bibliographical entries, while the first two mentioned works are by now severely dated. These volumes must be supplemented, therefore, in two ways, first for the sake of completeness and second for the purpose of acquiring more up-to-date bibliographical information. For the first of these two tasks the historian should refer to the more complete Ministry of Home Affairs and National Diet Library catalogues, the catalogues and accession lists of major libraries, and to those bibliographies devoted specifically to the listing of periodical articles. These steps are outlined in Sections b through e of this chapter. For continuing up-to-date coverage, the historian will find at his disposal several annual bibliographical publications. Most useful are the yearly bibliographical summaries of historical literature compiled by the major scholarly organizations in Japan. The first of these is the series begun in 1916 by Kyoto Imperial University and published in Shirin. This series was later taken up by the Yoyogikai, then by the Tsukuba Kenkyubu, and is now published in modified form by the Tokyo University Shigakkai (Institution of Historical Science). It is included annually in Shigaku zasshi (Journal of historical science) as \"Sen kyuhyaku[ ]nen no rekishi gakkai (Historical studies in Japan, 19[ ]).\" (Entries 37, 52, 50, and 39). The Shigakkai brought out in 1952 a combined bibliographical survey for the years 1946-50 entitled Shigaku bunken mokuroku 1946-50 (Bibliography of historical studies, 1946-50) (Entry 41). Since the work covers both Chinese and Western history as well as Japanese history, its listings of materials on the latter subject are limited. Nevertheless it provides one of the best surveys of historical literature in postwar Japan. It lists both books and articles and contains an author index. A second annual series has been edited by the Rekishigaku Kenkyukai (commonly called Rekken). Begun in 1930 as the Rekishigaku nempi5 (Annual report of historical studies) (Entry 35), it has continued in recent years as Rekishigaku no seika to kadai (Historical studies; accomplishments and problems) (Entry 36). Number 1 of the postwar series covered the years 1944-49 in analytical summaries only. Number 2 published in 1951 covers the year 1950 and contains not only articles analyzing the year's historical accomplishments but includes also a selected list of books and articles classified by historical periods. To these annuals should be added the chief publishers' yearbooks discussed in Section d of this chapter, the periodic indices to periodical literature discussed in Section e, and the review and current bibliography sections of the chief journals listed in Part IV. Access to primary material and works written before the advent of modern historical scholarship in Japan is a somewhat more difficult task. Here again a double problem presents itself. First comes the work of accumulating references to primary and pre-modern sources, next the need to acquire information concerning the nature and location of these sources. To aid in the first step there exist a number of classified but unannotated catalogues and indices. Of first importance is the chronological index to primary sources prepared by the Tokyo University Historiographical Institute as part of its monumental project of compiling the Dai Nihon shiryo (Historical materials of Japan). It is entitled Shiryo soran (Main points of the Historical materials of Japan) (Entry 48) and is arranged chronologically by historical incident. Under each incident are listed the major historical sources which relate to it. Naturally many of the sources so listed are extremely obscure and will be generally available only when the Dai Nihon shiryo is complete. Furthermore the Shiryo soran is considerably dated and often inaccurate. A further limitation is its coverage which terminates with the year 1583. Of more general use, therefore, are two less pretentious indices. The first of these is Mozume Takami's Gunsho sakuin (Bibliographical index) (Entry 27), which classifies minutely under individual subjects over ten thousand pre-modern sources. The second, Ban Nobutomo and Koizumi Yasujiro's Nihon shiseki nempyU (Chronological table of Japanese historical materials) (Entry 18), indicates in tabular form the standard sources covering any given year from ancient times to 1868. The encyclopedic Koji ruien (Encyclopedia of ancient matters) (Entry 207) may also be used to gain access to primary sources, as may also Tsuji Zennosuke's Dai Nihon nempyo (Japanese chronological table) (Entry 346). In the latter work each citation of an historical fact is followed by a code word which indicates the source from which it was taken.\n\nPage 3 BIBLIOGRAPHIES For entrance into less formalized historical materials, the various indices to series and miscellanies discussed in Section f of this chapter will be found indispensable. The historian will also want to know of the excellent classified list of historical sources included in End- and others' Shiseki kaidai (Annotated bibliography of history) (Entry 5). This list (pp. 231-250) arranges chronologically and topically the major sources used by modern Japanese historians. Finally, for maximum completeness the scholar may have to consult the catalogues of some. of the major libraries in Japan. These works are difficult to use, however, because of their lack of adequate classification. Since few of the above bibliographical materials supply more than the bare titles of books and manuscripts, the historian is still faced with the problem of acquiring information on the contents and location of the works to which he has been referred. At this point he must bring into play still another set of reference materials, the kaidai or annotated bibliographies of pre-modern materials. Two general kaidai of great value are listed below. The first of these is Samura Hachiro's Zotei kokusho kaidai (Annotated bibliography of Japanese books, revised and enlarged) (Entry 38). This work lists and briefly annotates some twenty-seven thousand Japanese works in all fields written before 1868, and indicates the location of modern printed editions when such exist. The other is Endu and others' Shiseki kaidai (Annotated bibliography of history) (Entry 5), a work of smaller and more strictly historical scope. Annotated bibliographies limited to single fields have been listed later in the chapters dealing with specialized bibliographies. Neither of the above works indicates the location of unpublished materials. This final problem has no easy solution. Since Japan has no centralized national archives, manuscripts are scattered among many private and institutional collections, few of which are adequately catalogued. The previously mentioned Nihon shiseki nempyU by Ban Nobutomo and Koizumi Yasujiru is, to the author's knowledge, the only work which indicates the location of manuscript sources. For manuscripts not listed in this work, the only recourse seems to be to consult individually the catalogues of the major Japanese libraries or archival collections, both public and private. The following list of general bibliographies is highly selective and includes for the most part only works in book form completely devoted to the subject of historical bibliography. Naturally a good deal of excellent bibliographical material lies hidden in the appendices of books on history and in the various historical journals. Such sources have not been systematically listed in the following section. However, the author has attempted to indicate in his annotations of the major journals and secondary works on Japanese history the existence of review sections and bibliographical appendices. It should also be pointed out that the following list makes no attempt to cover with any degree of completeness bibliographies dealing exclusively with government publications. Since the Meiji period, the various branches of the Japanese government have published such a quantity of material that orientation in this field of publication is an entire subject in itself. For most purposes, however, the historian should find the government publications series published by the Cabinet Printing Office (Entries 29 and 30) and the National Diet Library (Entry 20) sufficiently complete. It should also be noted that the general catalogues published by the National Diet Library (Entries 58 and 59) and the yearbook issued by the Shuppan Nyususha (Entry 89) list government publications. a.

Matsumoto Hikojiro's section on Japan comprises nearly half the volume and is devoted to critical commentaries on the chief historical works written in Japan from ancient times through the Tokugawa period. 5.

The book is arranged in three parts: Japan, Orient, and Occident. Two hundred and fifty pages plus eighty-two pages of index are devoted to Japan. Entries are arranged by title. Each work is extensively annotated giving date of authorship, resume of contents, full table of contents if the work is a collection, and location of modern printed editions. The index is very exhaustive since it includes not only the major citations but titles contained in serial publications. Pages 231-250 comprise a classified list of historical reference works, providing a convenient introduction to the major pre-modern sources in the field of history. 6.

It lists about twenty basic books in each of fifty fields including history and related fields. Selections are arbitrary and tend to include older works.

Arrangement is by decimal system. Within each field a section is devoted to history. There is a section on foreign bibliographies and an appendix on the types and uses of reference works. A detailed index of Japanese titles covers pages 741-865. This book relies rather heavily on Amano Keitaro's Hompo shoshi no shoshi (Entry 1) and thus perpetuates errors contained in that work. Annotations tend to be at a minimum and approximately one-fifth of the citations are unannotated. Bibliographical entries are frequently incomplete. 9.

Much more than just a bibliography of economic history, it covers the history of all social science fields in comprehensive fashion. Though it touches on intellectual and religious history, it is weak in these fields and neglects altogether literature and the arts. Annotations are largely written to explain the value of the entries to the economic historian. Volumes two and three of this series (see following entries), bring the entire coverage up to 1950. The Honjo bibliographies have a number of unique features which make them indispensable to the historian: 1) they include both books and articles; 2) the sections on historical materials break down the contents of the major collections and briefly annotate each item; 3) they include separate lists of local histories; and 4) they include separate bibliographies of Western works on Japanese social and economic history. The indices are full and contain references to both book titles and to the contents of the major collections. Articles are not indexed. 11.

The compilation office is now incorporated into the Shiryo Hensansho or the Historiographical Institute of Tokyo University. This series constitutes a simplified guide to materials found in the great collection of documents on the Restoration, the Dai Nihon Ishin shiryo (Entry 379). Like the Shiryo s-oran (Entry 48) it provides a chronology of events with documents listed for each incident. By 1939, ten volumes had been published covering the period 1853-69. 14.

Entries were submitted by the Tokyo University Philosophy Department, the Waseda University Literary Department, the Tokyo Geographical Research Institute and the Institute for Ethnological Research. The last two numbers constitute a single-volume special issue. The series covers the years 1946-1949, a period which is inadequately treated in other standard references.

For the student of recent history this thorough though unannotated bibliography will be of utmost value. Its coverage includes books, pamphlets, and articles appearing in a large number of journals and newspapers from 1916 to 1930. Entries are classified according to 36 major categories including contemporary Japanese economics, social conditions, politics, administration, law, foreign relations, etc. Each volume contains a detailed subject index.

This work consists of two tables. Table 1, chiefly the work of Ban, covers the years 888-1602; table 2 covers 1603-1868. Each table is divided into yearly sections. Each section presents a list of sources which contain references to events of that year. Generally between 20 and 50 works are listed. These works are divided into three categories. In table 1 the categories are: 1) archival material recommended by Ban Nobutomo, 2) amplification of 1), 3) diaries and biographical materials. In table 2 these categories are: 1) documents relating to the Imperial court, 2) materials on the Shogunal government, 3) miscellaneous. Pertinent chapters of works are identified; the location of manuscript copies is indicated by a code character. On the first occurrence of each work, significant bibliographical data is recorded. This constitutes one of the most important tools for gaining information on primary Japanese historical sources and for obtaining information on the location of manuscript copies of such sources. 19.

This bibliography attempts to cover all major fields of Japanese scholarship in a highly selective fashion. Each volume lists publications appearing during a given year (volume 1 covers 1932 and volume 8, 1938). The appearance of new journals is noted. Bibliographical entries are in Japanese and English. One special use which this series has is that it gives romanized readings of the names of contemporary Japanese authors. Unfortunately the lag between coverage and publication diminishes the value of this series. 22.

It was subsequently revised by Ito Chikara and Saito Matsutaro. Loosely arranged and difficult to use, it nevertheless contains a great deal of information on pre-modern sources hard to obtain elsewhere. The usefulness of the modern edition is enhanced by the addition of a title index. 23.

Kurita Motoji o'D C -, Sogo kokushi kenkyu, ' I li) { _ % (General guide for research in Japanese history), Tokyo, Dobun Shoin, 1935, 3 v. This work along with Kuroita Katsumi's Kokushi no kenkyu (Entry 25) is one of the most indispensable historiographical guides. Its historiographical importance derives from the excellent introductory essays which Kurita has prefaced to the various bibliographical sections of his work. It ranks with Hatano and Yayoshi's Kenkyu chosa sanko bunken soran (Entry 8), and Honjo's bibliographies of economic history\n\nPage 6 6 A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS (Entries 10 to 12) as one of the best of the selective annotated bibliographies. Its special focus is upon historical reference works, collections of historical sources, and upon secondary works in a broad variety of historical fields. The entries are descriptively annotated but little critical comment is added. Except for the fact that the work is now considerably out-of-date, it forms an excellent starting point for the student of Japanese history. The index contains references not only to the chief bibliographical entries but to titles mentioned in the historiographical prefaces and to the titles included in the large serial collections of historical materials. 25. Kuroita Katsumi., *5. Wt A, Kokushi no kenkyu t o_ T t L (Study of Japanese history), Tokyo, Iwanami Shoten, rev. ed., 1931-36, 4 v. Undoubtedly the most famous of modern Japanese histories, this work has a large number of bibliographical uses. Volume 1, entitled Sosetsu (General introduction), contains a number of bibliographical chapters; the most useful are: 1) a discussion of historical geography, and 2) of genealogies; 3) an historiographical essay which concludes with 4) a chronological listing of important Japanese works on Japanese history published from 1868 to 1930; 5) a similar list of Western language works published from 1364 to 1930; 6) bibliographical essays and recommended books and articles on the major period and subject divisions of Japanese history. The remaining three volumes constitute a standard political history of Japan. The author's documentation affords a valuable source of information on pre-Restoration bibliography. It is important to note that the materials used by Kuroita became the standard sources for the Tokyo Imperial University school of Japanese historiography. 26. Masamune Atsuo L-E- t.

An annual survey of Japanese works on Japanese, Oriental, and Occidental economic history. Part 1 contains critical reviews of the previous year's scholarship in a large variety of fields. Except for the 1934 issue, part 2 consists of a classified annotated bibliography of books and articles in economic history. Part 3 is a classified index of the contents of Keizaishi kenkyu during the previous year. Although the bibliographical data of this series is consolidated in Honj~'s Nihon keizaishi shin'bunken (Entry 11), and Nihon keizaishi daisan bunken (Entry 12), the review notes of part 1 continue to be of importance. 29.

Entries are arranged in irregular fashion under broad subject headings. Much of the material contained in this and its companion work, Nishimura Kanebumi's Zoku gunsho ichiran (Entry 32), has been incorporated into Samura Hachir's Kokusho kaidai (Entry 38). 35.

This annual special number of Rekishigaku kenkyu (Entry 568).parallels in its coverage the series begun by Shirin (See entry 37). The series was interrupted during World War II and resumed in 1950 with a second series under the title Rekishigaku no seika to kadai (See following entry). Each of the prewar volumes surveys a year's activity in the fields of Japanese, Oriental and Occidental history. Early issues contain both review essays and classified bibliographies of books and articles on the whole range of historical studies. Later issues become increasingly interpretive and hence contain less bibliographical information. As a whole, however, this series affords one of the best coverages on historical books and articles for the period 1936-43. 36.

An annual supplement to Rekishigaku kenkyu (Entry 568). The first issue after the war covered the years 1944-49 and thus filled in the interval from the termination of the prewar \"Rekishigaku nempo\" series (See previous entry). Volume 2 covers the year 1950. Volume 1 contains interpretive essays on the activity of Japanese historians in the fields of Japanese, Oriental, and Occidental studies. Volume 2 revives the feature of a selected, classified bibliography of books and articles. Users should be aware of the historical bias of the postwar Rekishigaku Kenkyukai. 37. \"Sakunen no shigaku DB 4- A^ t (Historiography during the previous year),\" Shirin, v. 1-14 (1916-29). This annual feature of Shirin (Entry 580) gives excellent coverage of historical literature for the years 1915-28. Later issues of this series include separate bibliographical sections on archeology and geography as well as history. Each issue contains a critical survey of historical literature in each of the major historical fields with copious references to the most significant books and articles published during the previous year. This survey was carried on by the Yoyogikai after Shirin dropped it in 1930. 38.

This monumental annotated bibliography of books and manuscripts of pre-Restoration Japan was first published in 1900 and affords the most complete and satisfactory coverage of earlier Japanese historical literature. The body of the work consists of an annotated bibliography of some twenty-seven thousand works listed by title in syllabic order. Annotations contain date of authorship, description of content, information on printed editions, and a note on the author. Volume 2 contains the following useful appendices: 1) An author index which includes pennames. 2) A classified index of works cited in the bibliography. Classification is based on the \"traditional\" system and hence difficult to use. 3) A title index by strokes, a most useful feature especially when the reading of a title is obscure. 4) A list of major serial publications plus a detailed breakdown of their contents. Indexes 1, 2, and 3 are not complete. Index 4 was prepared by Hamano Tomosaburz (See entry 107). 39. \"Sen kyuhyaku [ ] nen no rekishi gakkai 19 [ ] Z o /,. l.

This annual special issue of Shigaku zasshi (Entry 578) continues in somewhat abridged form the yearly summary of historical activities in Japan compiled by the Tsukuba KenkyUbu (Entry 50) up to the beginning of World War H. Each issue contains interpretive articles on publications in the fields of Japanese, Oriental, and Western history produced during the previous year in Japan. The section on Japan is divided into the following sections: 1) general, 2) ancient, 3) feudal, 4) Meiji restoration, and 5) recent history. There is no separate bibliographical list or index. 40.

This is a special number of Shakai keizaishigaku (Entry 612) edited by Ono Takeo. It contains articles by individual specialists on the development of Japanese scholarship in such fields as: agriculture, industry, commerce, thought, society, administration, law, and customs. Though the quantity of bibliographical information varies greatly from article to article, this work constitutes a valuable introductory guide to the general field of history as a social science. It has been widely used by contemporary Japanese historians.\n\nPage 8 8 A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS 41. Shigakkai.

It is a selected and classified list of books and articles by Japanese scholars in the fields of Japanese, Oriental, and Occidental history. Some nine thousand items are listed of which 4800 deal with Japan. Over four hundred journals are represented. An especially valuable feature of this work is its index by author. 42.

These have been used in the preparation of the various documentary series issued by the institute. They have also formed the basis of the research of many of Japan's leading historians. Unfortunately, this catalogue is now seriously dated. But until a more up-to-date catalogue is issued, this one will remain valuable as a list of important documentary materials. 43.

Following this the author gives lengthy reviews of approximately five major works published in each of several fields of history: political, economic, intellectual, religious, etc. Volume 1 provides, in addition, a selected checklist of important works published during 1942 in each of the above fields.

An annual review of Japanese historical literature continuing the series begun by Shirin (See entry 37). In addition to providing the usual critical surveys of the major historical fields the Yoyogikai began the practice of including a separate list of books and articles classified under 17 categories. In 1937 the series was taken up by the Tsukuba KenkyUbu (Entry 50). b. Ministry of Home Affairs and National Diet Library Catalogues Prior to World War II, the Japanese government customarily issued lists of titles submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs for copyright and censorship purposes. These lists provide a nearly exhaustive coverage of all commercially published books, especially for the period after 1924. Before that date the coverage was somewhat spotty. Following World War II the book collecting function of the Home Ministry was partially taken over by the National Diet Library. As yet, however, the bibliographical lists published by this library are not as complete as those of the prewar Home Ministry. This is due to the fact that the National Diet Library lacks legal powers to require all new publications to be deposited with it. While the above category of bibliographical materials is important for the completeness of its coverage, the scholar will find it somewhat difficult to use because of the lack of cumulative volumes prior to 1948. Thereafter the Zen-Nihon Shuppambutsu s-mokuroku (General catalogue of works published in Japan) (Entry 59) affords one of the most complete and accessible repositories of current bibliography available. The entries which follow have been chronologically listed since in a sense they constitute a single series. 53. Naimusho Toshokyoku; -A * Ii) -t -) (Ministry of Home Affairs, Bureau of Books), Hanken shomoku 4 -t A ~ (Catalogue of copyrights), Tokyo, Naimusho Toshokyoku, 27 nos. in 6 v., 1876-83 and 1921-23. This is the first of the Home Ministry's catalogues of books deposited for copyright purposes. The series is of interest chiefly for the historian of the early Meiji period. Titles contained in this series are cumulated in the Naimusho Toshokyoku's Toshokyoku shomoku (1883, 2 v.) and the Dai ni Toshoka shomoku (1886, 3 v.). The present series was succeeded by the monthly bulletin described in the following entry. 54.

A continuation of the Home Ministry's listings of books deposited with it. Most of the entries in this series were accumulated in the Toshokyoku shomoku and Dai ni Toshoka shomoku (see previous entry). This series was succeeded after a break by the Naimusho noohon geppo series (Following entry). 55. Naimush5 nohon gepp - t A,t- * 4 (Monthly list of books deposited with the Ministry of Home Affairs), Tokyo, Tosho Kenkyukai, v. 1-3, 1926-29. Monthly. Privately compiled under authorization of the Home Ministry this series continues a practice begun in 1912 and carried on by a number of publishing houses. Because of the complex nature of this series, its previous bibliographical history is condensed under this entry. Originating in 1912 in the Dokusho no tomo,, ~ e s (Readers' world); the Bukkuman 7\".y 7 - > (Bookman), TSkyo, Yomiuri, v. 1-2, 1924 -25; the Yomuhito BR L- / — (The reader), Tokyo, Yomiuri, v. 3, nos. 1-6, 1926; the Bukkuman, v. 3, nos. 7-9, 1926; the Bukku rebyu 7 - 7 -- t?- - (Book review), Tokyo, Tosho Kenkyukai, v. 1-2, 1926-28; and again the Bukkuman, Tosho Kenkyukai, v. 2, no. 11-v. 3, no. 5, 1928-29. Bibliographic information is compiled from daily mimeographed releases of the Home Ministry. Contents are divided into 22 subject categories. After October 1930 this series was published under different auspices (see below). 56.

This series may be said to have revived the work of the Home Ministry and the Tosho Kenkyukai which had been interrupted by World War II. It is a classified list of commercially printed books and journals deposited with the National Diet Library. Classification is by Dewey Decimal System. A quarterly publication, Nohon kiho, was begun concurrently but dropped almost immediately. The Nuhon geppo was superseded by the Kokunai shuppambutsu mokuroku (Following entry). 58.

Each issue has two major divisions: a classified list of government publications, and a classified list of commercially published books. Some issues also list phonograph records. An alphabetical title index is generally provided.\n\nPage 10 10 A GUIDE TO JAPANESE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH MATERIALS 59. Zen-Nihon shuppambutsu somokuroku /E\" E t-2;. t.. ~ E.

A cumulative summary of the monthly index of government and copyrighted publications issued in Nohon geppo (Entry 57) and the Kokunai shuppambutsu mokuroku (Entry 58). Volume 1 covers the period April 1948-March 1949. The work is divided into three major sections: 1) government publications, 2) commercially published books and journals, and 3) children's literature. Later volumes list periodicals and such miscellaneous items as works in braille, movies, film strips, and slides. c. Library Catalogues and Accession Lists The historian will find the catalogues and accession lists of Japan's major libraries of importance in two ways: first as a source of bibliographical information on pre-modern historical materials, especially on the availability of manuscript copies and rare items, and secondly for the coverage they afford of recently published literature. For the latter purpose, other more convenient guides exist, though few are as complete. Most Japanese libraries issue two series of catalogues, one with titles arranged in syllabic order (the kanabetsu or shomei series) the other by classification under broad categories (the bunrui or kemmei series). The latter is more convenient, but categories are often too general for easy use. The value of individual library catalogues naturally varies greatly with the institution. A discussion of the history of library collections and their present status is reserved to Part III, Chapter 1 below. Here it need only be pointed out that for coverage of pre-Restoration materials the catalogues of the Imperial Household Library (Kunaisho Toshokan), the Cabinet Library (Naikaku Bunko), the Imperial Library (Teikoku Toshokan, now the Ueno Library), the Seikad' Library, the Sonkeikaku Library, and the Tlkyo and Kyoto [Imperial] University Libraries are the most complete. For books of recent publication, the catalogues of the prewar Imperial Library and the postwar National Diet Library are most complete, since copies of nearly all commercially printed books are customarily deposited in these two libraries. In the following list, catalogues of only the most important libraries have been entered. Entries are classified by publishing library and thereafter chronologically. 60. Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan I - J ' f 1 ' (National Diet Library), Shusho tsuho 6 -t i., 4i. (Current acquisitions), Tokyo, Kokuritsu Kokkai Toshokan, Nov. 1948-. The National Diet Library, modeled after the United States Library of Congress, has taken over the government's centralizing activities formerly carried on by the Home Ministry and the Cabinet Library. Most major public libraries of the Tokyo area are now incorporated as branches of this library. The even numbered issues of this series list Japanese books while the odd numbered ones list Western books. Classification is by the Dewey Decimal System. 61.

Its holdings have been listed in various catalogues under several titles. See following entries. The present work is the basic list of holdings of the original Tokyo Library. This catalogue and its supplements are superseded by the later series published during the period (1894-1947) when the library was named the Teikoku Toshokan. 72.

After 1894 the To-kyU Toshokan became the Teikoku Toshokan. Supplements to the 1885 catalogue were renamed accordingly. Serial numbering remained continuous. This series completes the coverage through 1899.

The Tokyo Toshokan became the Teikoku Toshokan in 1894. This catalogue lists the holdings of the library as of the end of 1893, while supplements bring its coverage up to 1935. This series thus supersedes the one begun in 1886 by the old Tokyo Toshokan. The classified series which parallels this catalogue is much more convenient to use (See entries 77 and 78). 76.

Irregular. The first volume of this series is a classified catalogue of the old Tokyo Imperial University holdings as of 1888. Subsequent volumes bring the coverage up to the time of the destruction of the library in the earthquake of 1923. Twenty-one major classifications and numerous sub-categories are used, and a romanized title index provided. A title catalogue paralleled this classified series. It is, however, much less convenient to use. Since this collection is no longer in existence, these catalogues are useful only as a bibliographical reference. 81.

The Tokyo [Imperial] University Library was rapidly rebuilt after 1923, though it still lacks the rare historical materials of the older collection. In 1935 it began to compile a new catalogue of holdings up to that year. Up to the present only a few volumes have appeared. The following is the publication plan. Those entries with publication dates have already appeared in print.
