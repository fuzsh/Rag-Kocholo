Following the introduction, in which the perfect beauty of the young couple is emphasized, the rest of the story is devoted entirely to a description of the preparations for suicide and, in shockingly exact detail, the act of suicide itself. It is a paean to unswerving devotion to an accepted code and to the beauty of a young and noble death.\n\nThere is no undercurrent of irony here, no balancing of the passion of life with the necessity of death: the essential point is that the passion of life is only achieved through such a violent death. Death in the prime of youth is the fit culmination, the justification and the true glory of life, and the narrator takes enormous pains to make us assent to this point of view and emotionally participate in it.\n\nDying the beautiful death, the beautiful body of death, the instant of death that gives meaning to everything else—these were ideas to which Mishima constantly returned. This does not mean, of course, that all his short stories contained such meticulous and anatomically exact descriptions of suicide, but the beloved immensity of death works its influence on all his writings in one way or another.\n\nThere are other stories that deal directly with the subject of death itself or in which the principle character dies: \"Death in Midsummer,\" \"Sword,\" \"Kujaku\" (The Peacocks). Death's numinous presence, usually more a promise than a threat, underlies and gives coherence to a story. Its absoluteness makes the everyday concerns of those struggling to avoid death seem absurd and foolish by contrast. \"Death in Midsummer,\" one of Mishima's best-known stories, contains all these elements. The tragedy comes at the beginning. Two of Tomoko and Masaru's three children are drowned when the aunt watching them has a heart attack just as she sees them being swept out to sea; she dies before she can give warning. The rest of the story shows how the agony of grief is dulled gradually by the humdrum circumstances of life and the adjustments of the ego. Mishima convincingly shows the mother's anger and disbelief fading into a state where she has to remind herself to feel sad. Then she becomes pregnant again: \"While true forgetfulness had not come, something covered Tomoko's sorrow as thin ice covers a lake\" (translated by Edward G. Seidensticker). The roles have been reversed: \"It attacked the organism like an invisible germ.\" \"The organism\" here means her grief and despair, and it attacks forgetfulness, what would normally be regarded as the healing processes of life. The end of the story comes after the new baby is born and Tomoko suddenly feels an urge to return to the beach where the deaths occurred. As she stands gazing out to sea and the horizon of massed clouds, her husband observes her expression, as if she were waiting for something: \"'What are you waiting for?' he wanted to ask lightly. But the words did not come. He thought he knew without asking. He clutched tighter at Katsuo's hand.\" Katsuo is the one child who was not swept out to sea at the time, and it seems clear that what Tomoko is waiting for here is the death meted out to her other children, waiting to be borne out toward the infinity of sea and cloud and golden light—elements of landscape that occur frequently in Mishima's tales.\n\nAnother example, and one that illustrates the breadth of Mishima's reading and his eclectic use of sources, is the short tale \"Sea and Sunset.\" Set in medieval Japan, it is about an old man who climbs to the top of a hill every evening to view the sunset over the sea. He is not Japanese, but a Frenchman, once a shepherd boy from the Cevennes who had a vision urging him to lead a crusade. He was captured and brought as a slave to India, eventually ending in the service of a wandering Japanese monk. In his vision the sea would part for him and allow him to walk to the holy land. But it does not happen, and this is all he remembers, the fact that the sea would not part and that all experiences and memories now have disappeared into the glowing sea.\n\nIt is hard to deny that many of Mishima's ideas boil down to a kind of romantic nihilism. But however intellectually confused and often simply adolescent his philosophy may seem, an anarchic and nihilistic view of society allowed him to produce sharp and witty satires. This is the reverse side of the romanticism of death—the burlesquing of life. Some stories are simply comedies of manners, such as \"The Pearl,\" which describes the vindictiveness, injured pride, and social maneuvering of four wealthy, middle-aged women at a tea party. Mishima captures the icy hypocrisy of the exchanges between these women with an exactness that, even in translation, rivals Saki or Waugh at their best. Other of his stories, such as \"Act of Worship,\" \"Dojoji,\" and \"The Seven Bridges,\" contain many examples of the same witty social observation, although their overall tone is soberer: Mishima was even capable of a kind of Rabelasian grotesque, as in the tale of five monstrous students in \"Tamago.\"\n\nBut in the majority of Mishima's mature stories the main point is the ironic contrast between the characters' hopes and their real circumstances. Often they are engrossed in their trivial everyday concerns, until something brings them up against the emptiness at the center. This is especially true of the characters identified with what Mishima saw as the decadent materialism of post-occupation Japan. In \"Kyuteisha\" (Emergency Stop) a young man who wanted to be an artist instead makes his living creating lamps for the rich and tasteless. In \"Thermos Bottles\" a former Geisha with a talent for traditional dance is turned into just another Westernized Japanese mistress, as though \"the great vermilion-lacquered, black-riveted gate of some noble lady's mansion were suddenly to change into a slick revolving door.\" Although Mishima is better known for his novels, he, like Lawrence, is a writer whose best qualities and principle ideas can be easily understood from his short fiction. For someone who tended to lapse into long passages of speculative philosophy and equally long, and rather overcontrived and schematic descriptions, the constraints of the short story often did him a service, forcing him to make his effects cleaner and his ideas clearer, as well as bringing to the fore his talent for dialogue, which tends to go ignored in his longer works.\n\n—James Raeside"
