        "text": "Benjamin J. McCracken\n\nHere We Go Again\n\nPoetry\n\nCraft Workshop\n\nRepetition makes poetry. Poetry, as words arranged in order to produce memorable effects on the human ear and eye, depends on repetition in order to provide structure and to provide the mind with the opportunity to quickly grasp its sounds and shapes (if not its sense) and to retain these sounds and shapes for repetition to others. The long association between poetry and music, and between poetry and visual art, has given rise to a wide range of aural and visual techniques of repetition including the repetition of sounds, words, image patterns, and lines. In this workshop, participants will review some rhetorical techniques of word repetition in poetry including anadiplosis (‘Beauty is truth, truth beauty…’), anaphora, diaphora, epanalepsis (‘Blood hath brought blood, and blows have answered blows’), epistrophe, epizeuxis (‘Never, never, never, never, never’), polysyndeton, symploce, etc., including some well-known examples from English poetry. The workshop will also review some techniques of line repetition in stanzaic and fixed poetic forms including the pantoum, triolet, and villanelle. Participants will have time to practice one or more of these techniques of repetition by writing a few lines, stanzas, or a short poem.\n\nChristopher Simons is Senior Associate Professor of Literature at International Christian University in Tokyo. He has held the Harper-Wood Studentship in Creative Writing at St John’s College Cambridge. His most recent poetry collection is Flight Risk (Isobar Press, 2021).

Examples will be given using excerpts from various published writers, including but not limited to works of the presenters. Things that can be added to a work include visuals, quotations, work in a different genre or language, sound, metaphor, musicality, any type of found work, dialogues, and more. This session is intended to benefit any writer working in any genre or style at any level.\n\nJane Joritz-Nakagawa has lived in Japan since 1989. Currently she lives in Hamamatsu.

Eric Selland will introduce Brushwork, a reproduction of his notebook of visual poetry using black-ink pen and calligraphic brush. Masaya Saito will introduce and read from his two volumes of translations from the twentieth-century haiku master Saitō Sanki: Selected Haiku 1933–1962, containing translations of more than a thousand haiku, and The Kobe Hotel, Sanki’s picareque prose memoirs of his time in Kobe during the Second World War.\n\nPaul Rossiter has published eleven books of poetry since 1995. After retiring from teaching at the University of Tokyo in 2012, he founded Isobar Press, which specialises in publishing English-language poetry from Japan, and English translations of modernist and contemporary Japanese poetry.

To join, contact David directly at debidogirubi@gmail.com\n\nThe workshop is based on the familiar and successful structure and strategy as offered by John Gribble at the 2008 JWC and my own over the last six years. It will involve my sending out a brief to intending participants requiring submission of drafts of poems, then, before the actual workshop, reading and making comments on each of the participant’s poems and finally, participating in the workshop discussion itself at the conference.\n\nThis workshop allows writers to work on a poem or two in readiness for publication, recognising that conference delegates are themselves writers, teachers and editors and that there are both personal and professional benefits from a closely-focussed discussion of emerging texts. So the purpose of this workshop is to give a small group of poets the opportunity to meet, read and discuss in depth, a sample of each other’s work. The workshop will be open to a limited number of participants but writers of varying degrees of experience will be welcome. The session will be closed and of two hours duration. There will be two parts to the workshop: preparation and participation. Preparation also has two parts: submitting and close reading. Those who sign up for the session will be contacted before the conference.\n\nPoet David Gilbey was Adjunct Senior Lecturer in English at Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, Australia, and the founding President of Wagga Wagga Writers Writers.

The notebooks span the years 1959 to 1975, a time when he was maturing as a poet and as an editor. The ongoing relevance of his poetics are shared and discussed.\n\nSome years ago, the late American Kyoto-based expatriate poet, Cid Corman gifted Fred Jeremy Seligson, an American poet living in Korea, a collection of his notebooks/journals as a token of his appreciation for the financial support that Seligson had offered him during particularly difficult years. These notebooks span the crucial time period between 1959 and 1975, when Corman first arrived in Kyoto and was actively publishing his seminal literary magazine Origin and maturing as a poet. Although Corman’s other journals and papers were purchased and placed in research libraries after his death in 2004, these notebooks remained outstanding and uncollected. At present, Jeremy and I are engaged in creating a book, comprised of selections from the notebooks that will serve poets and those interested in poetry with gleanings from the notebooks of Corman’s most salient insights and teachings on the art and craft of poetry. This presentation will share our findings regarding Corman’s poetics. In doing this, we will show how Corman’s ideas concerning the art and craft of poetry remain vital and will be ever relevant.\n\nGregory Dunne has published prose and poetry in such venues as The American Poetry Review, Catamaran, Prairie Schooner, Manoa, Willow Springs, The Mainichi Shimbun, Crazyhorse, Kyoto Journal, Poetry East.

Since 2013, The Font has published essays, poetry and fiction pieces from language teachers around the world. James Crocker founded and has been Chief Editor from its foundation. James has been on hiatus since March 2022. This presentation will introduce the new editor and provide some data metrics on visitor and submission rates, where are submissions coming from, who is reading The Font, and some information about publication and editorial opportunities at The Font. Also, because of the long-time familiarity of the JWC with The Font, it is hoped that there will be a chance for suggestions and advice from other members about ways to improve and expand opportunities for both writers and the publication itself.\n\nThe featured readers include Michael Pronko, Steve Redford, and Jared Kubokawa.\n\nKelly Quinn teaches English in Japan. He is the author of several mediocre academic articles and the book Japanese History You Should Know, IBC publishing. He is currently Chief Editor of The Font.\n\nLiane Grunberg Wakabayashi\n\nGood News for Authors: Sourcing Expert Advice for Free\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A. online\n\nInstructional\n\nFor writers on a budget, knowing what to spend money on and what can be sourced for free, need not be a source of frustration or regrets. Find out about a plethora of free resources that will help you gain confidence in deciding what services are truly essential to pay for and what you can best do on your own.\n\nThere’s currently a mantra in the publishing industry that’s working to our advantage as writers. That is, “give away expert advice for free, then hook your writer with a paid service.” The expert advice found online covers everything a new or experienced author needs to know in this rapidly changing publishing world. These experts know that before they can hook an author onto a paid service, they had best offer to educate us why we need their services. The good news is that some of these free offers are so useful, so effective, you might not need the paid services in the long run. In this presentation, Liane will discuss her top free, or near-free resources, most of them a click away, to help authors at every stage of the writing process. Learn about websites, email subscription services, YouTube and podcast platforms, by both famous influencers and lesser known experts, offering practical information, community support and wonderful writing incentives.\n\nLiane Grunberg Wakabayashi is an artist and writer for many publications during her thirty years in Tokyo (1987-2017). Since moving to Israel, she writes for The Jerusalem Post Magazine and is the author of the recently published memoir: The Wagamama Bride: A Jewish Family Saga Made in Japan.\n\nMichael Pronko\n\nMaking Scenes: Types, Elements, Effects, Integration\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nFiction\n\nScenes linger in readers’ minds. Recall a great novel and you might think of character first, but always a character doing or saying something amazing. That’s a scene. This talk will consider ways to conceive, construct, and energize scenes in novels.\n\nScenes are the most essential building block of novels. By attending to the complexities of scenes, novels can be strongly developed, not just structurally, but in terms of affective quality and narrative energy. This talk will first look at types of scenes and consider where different scene types can be placed in the larger narrative. The essential elements of scenes will be examined together with their effects, both in terms of the narrative and the kinds of emotions evoked. Other issues such as pacing, balance, dialogue, irony, and opening and closing lines will also be discussed. Lastly, this talk will think about how to position and integrate scenes for a stronger overall sequence of scenes. By focusing not just on structural issues, but on emotional issues, the impact of scenes can be re-examined and given deeper consideration. Examples will be drawn from well-known novels and films.\n\nMichael Pronko has written for many publications but now focuses on the award-winning Detective Hiroshi series set in Tokyo. He also has three collections of writing about Tokyo and runs the website Jazz in Japan. He teaches American Literature at Meiji Gakuin University.\n\nTokyo Zangyo.

Join three journalist-members of Unfiltered as they share why the cooperative model can be a viable alternative for writers as they share their story and those from other creative cooperatives around the world.\n\nJournalists face new challenges as the industry comes under the control of a few large media outlets. In particular, Japanese media organizations lack diversity and lean toward narrow gatekeeping. The multi-lingual members of Unfiltered decided to create a place to share a broader range of stories and vantage points, to give voice to the marginalized. In less than two years, Unfiltered has covered sex workers and Covid-19, the Ainu and human rights, and freedom of the press in Japan among others.\n\nWhile writer cooperatives are relatively new, cooperatives have long empowered workers around the world. Three Unfiltered journalist members will discuss the cooperative model, reader inclusion, and the process of setting up and managing a media cooperative. We’ll also share how other new, innovative cooperatives allow writers, photographers, and artists to create content outside of the traditional business model in places like Hong Kong, the US, and Europe.\n\nChie Matsumoto is a freelance journalist covering mainly social justice issues and marginalized communities. Her work appears on Unfiltered.coop, and in Gender Expression Guidebook (2021) (Japanese) and State of Sexual Harassment in Media (2020) (Japanese) among others.\n\nNithin Coca is a Japan-based, Asia-focused freelance journalist who covers climate, environment and human rights across the region. He’s also the author of Traveling Softly and Quietly, a travel memoir published in 2013.\n\nJoan Bailey is a freelance food journalist based in Japan. Her work can be found at Unfiltered.coop, Atlas Obscura, The Japan Times, Modern Farmer, Civil Eats, and joandbailey.com\n\nSara Ellis\n\nWhy MFA When You Can BB?\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A, Craft Workshop\n\nFiction\n\nI will give a short overview of Big Bang and talk about my experiences as well as research and input from other participants producing original work. A workshop component will be in the second part of the presentation with Q & A, time allowing.\n\nA Big Bang is a writing challenge wherein writers are paired with artists in the creation of a longform fic to a specific deadline. Writers take part in Big Bangs for a variety of reasons: love of fandom, to experiment with original concepts, and for the comradery and intensive experience of writing long works to a deadline. Nevertheless, writing within specific fandoms also provides writers (and readers) with a powerful opportunity to discover strengths as well as diagnose and target weak points in their writing. While BB story concepts range from old Hollywood romances to retellings of Jurassic Park or blended Star Wars/Star Trek canons, the common points allow writers to better target where they might improve in areas such as pacing, characterization, and exposition. This presentation will focus on the experience and benefits of participating in Big Bangs to improve craft and produce original longform work. I will be citing my own experiences and research as well as that of other BB participants.\n\nSara Kate Ellis is a Lambda Emerging Writers Fellow and attended the Milford Science Fiction Workshop in 2017. Her recent stories have appeared in Analog, Fusion Fragment and Metaphorosis.\n\n“Snow on Snow” Visions, Shadowdance (Bulgaria)\n\n“In-Flight Damage” Analog\n\n“Collapse Noise,” Fusion Fragment\n\n“The Ratio of Silence” Space and Time\n\n“From Farm to Table: Superman as the Great Provider,” presented at the Superhero Project, Wolfsburg Catholic University, Germany\n\n“Women at Refrigerators: The Gender Politics of Food and Eating in Supergirl,” Genre en Series, France\n\n“To Die For” Sanvers Zine\n\n“Sturm und Clang,” Metaphorosis\n\nSara Fujimura\n\nBook Signing Superstar\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nCareer\n\nYou have a book signing! How do you look like a professional even if it is your first event ever? Spring 2022 Tempe Library Writer-in-Residence, Sara Fujimura walks you through a roll-and-go author kit that all easily fits in a piece of carry-on luggage. Author checklist included!\n\nFrom small library events and school visits to major U.S. book festivals and huge anime cons, young adult author Sara Fujimura has signed books at all of them. Though she is now a hybrid author, you may be surprised to know that many of Fujimura’s biggest signings were BEFORE she was traditionally published with Tor Teen. This workshop walks participants through setting up a simple but effective signing table with components that will all easily fit in a piece of carry-on luggage. Fujimura discusses what to do when your signing is a complete failure (it happens!) and how to course-correct afterward. A take-home worksheet makes sure authors show up at their events with all the necessary components. It also helps authors clarify their why for each event, collect important metrics, and offers tips on how to level up their book-signing game.\n\nSara Fujimura is a hybrid author of four award-winning young adult books: Tanabata Wish, Breathe, Every Reason We Shouldn’t (Tor Teen), and Faking Reality (Tor Teen). She is represented by Ann Rose of the Prospect Agency. Every Reason We Shouldn’t was named an NPR Best Book of 2020. www.sarafujimura.com\n\nSarah Coomber\n\nMoment by Moment: Demystifying the Writing of a First Memoir\n\nCraft Workshop online\n\nNonfiction, Other Genre\n\nMemoir\n\nTelling your story in memoir form can be daunting—you have a lifetime’s worth of experiences to draw from. Where to begin?\n\nMoment by moment.\n\nIn this craft workshop, I will share several strategies to help you on your way.\n\nMemoirs, like life, progress moment by moment. The most important thing is not whether your particular story is full of excitement, tragedy or coincidence. What matters is what you bring to the moments in your story—how you view, interpret, reflect on and react to them.\n\nInfusing moments with meaning will help you uncover your larger story. This can occur with sensory explorations, analogies, linked memories, about-ness and more.\n\nI will share what I wish I’d known before writing my first memoir and will coach you through several of my favorite moment-developing strategies.\n\nAttendees are encouraged to bring a scene or observation to explore.\n\nSarah Coomber is the author of The Same Moon (Camphor Press, 2020), a memoir about two years she spent regrouping in rural Japan after wrecking her Minnesota life. She has worked in public relations and journalism, coaches writing, has degrees in creative writing and journalism, and achieved level four certification in the Seiha School of koto. https://sarahcoomber.com/\n\nSwastika Jajoo, Masayuki Kobayashi, Trishit Banerjee\n\nCurating a Community Newsletter: The Story of ‘iro’\n\nPanel Discussion\n\nInstructional, Career\n\nThis will be a discussion geared towards understanding how community revitalisation and town rebuilding can benefit from art and artists, focusing specifically on the story of ‘iro’, a student-led newsletter launched in April 2022 in Futaba, Fukushima.\n\nWe aim to first introduce our project Palette Camp, which was launched in 2021 as a means to help create a sustainable future for Futaba, a town located in Fukushima severely affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. We will then shift focus to how writing and recording become intrinsic to any effort directed towards community building, sharing how stories need to be prioritised in our world today that seems to have become overwhelmed by statistics. We will then share how we conceptualised our newsletter, shedding light on challenges we faced along the way, what has been most rewarding during this journey and our vision for the future.\n\nMasayuki, Trishit and Swastika are the team behind Palette Camp. Masayuki Kobayashi is the Founder of Rurio and Palette Camp, and Trishit and Swastika (Hiba) are Co-founders.\n\nTrishit Bannerjee has worked extensively with journalism in both Japan and India. He won the Grand Prize at the 2019 All Japan English Presentation Contest. His article on community rebuilding was also featured on Japan Times in May 2022 (https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2022/05/30/issues/rebuilding-community-starting-scratch/)\n\nBesides being a poet, Swastika Jajoo was one of the 100 young journalists selected for the Future News Worldwide Summit by the British Council (2021 Edition): https://www.britishcouncil.org/future-news-worldwide\n\nTrishit Bannerjee:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r7LwWZi11s&t=342s\n\nhttps://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2022/05/30/issues/rebuilding-community-starting-scratch/\n\nSwastika Jajoo:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIKgRfJLCOI&t=80s\n\nhttps://theseventhwave.co/three-poems-by-swastika-jajoo/\n\nSwastika Jajoo\n\nPoetry as a Social Space\n\nCraft Workshop\n\nPoetry\n\nPoetry as a Social Space\n\nThis workshop will focus on how poetry, especially spoken word, can be used to reimagine the social spaces we inhabit. I would like for the participants to reflect closely on the issues our society faces today, and urge them to think about how poetry can be a tool for visualising social change. I will make a brief presentation about how poetry has been used in various social contexts in our world, sharing excerpts with a focus on India and Japan since these are the two landscapes I am most familiar with.\n\nI would like to begin by inviting the participants to contemplate the meanings of the words ‘society’ and ‘poetry,’ and create a virtual mind map simultaneously as they share their opinions. I will then proceed to talk about the traditional perception of poetry as a formal art, often out of reach for ordinary people, and contrast it with how poetry is becoming increasingly democratised in our world today, and how the stage is now society itself. I will then share some visuals from how spoken word poetry started out, and also share contemporary instances of it being used to stir social change. I will also talk about the dangers that come with poetry for social change — very often, we see poets appropriate the experience of others rather than passing the mic where they should be. Finally, I will have the participants form groups where they discuss a specific social theme and generate short verses pertinent to their chosen theme which will be shared with everyone towards the end as a means of closing the loop.\n\nOriginally from India, Swastika is currently a Master’s student in Linguistics, based out of Sendai, Japan. Her poetry is much like how she understands her unparalleled love for the local matcha latte and the longing for her mother’s spiced chai: an exercise in navigation. She won the second prize in the poetry contest organized as part of the international Glass House Poetry Festival in July 2020. Her work is featured or upcoming in Eunoia Review, Capsule Stories, The Wild Word, Riggwelter, Muse India, and Huffington Post, among others, and her spoken-word pieces have been featured on UnErase Poetry, one of India’s leading spoken-word content producers. In April 2019, she gave a TEDx talk featuring spoken-word poetry at her school, Tohoku University. She was also invited to perform with Rolling Stone India for Pride Month 2020.\n\nHer favourite things are fresh snow, old books and a traditional Japanese sweet called anmitsu.\n\nSteven Wolfson\n\nA Story Analyst’s Approach to Screenwriting: A Workshop on the Ins and Outs of Screenplay Development\n\nCraft Workshop\n\nWhether you are writing a studio feature or an independent film, at some point your script will enter the process known as ‘development.’ This workshop focuses on what really happens when a screenplay is developed for production. From issues of character and story to three-act structure and commercial viability, the class will look at the development process from both the perspective of the writer and the production company or studio. Through a series of writing exercises, students will learn how to manage script notes while at the same time protecting the integrity of their screenplay. The final goals of the workshop are a demystification of the development process and the tools to make your screenplay as production-friendly as possible.\n\nSteven Wolfson has taught screenwriting, playwriting and creative writing at The Writers Program at UCLA for the past 20 years and holds the distinction of having created the most new classes, workshops and seminars of any instructor in the program’s history. He has been awarded The Outstanding Instructor of the Year award twice, in both screenwriting and creative writing. As a screenwriter, Wolfson has sold projects to Fox, Lions Gate, TNT, MTV, Langley Entertainment, Beacon Films and producer Arnold Rifkin.

Multi-published authors Sara Fujimura, Clarissa Goenawan, Suzanne Kamata, Clara Kiyoko Kumagai, and Kristin Osani discuss the limitations and growth opportunities that come with this new post-pandemic reality.\n\nAre you waiting for the publishing world to “go back to normal?” The bad news: It’s not. Supply chain woes, soaring material costs, editorial burnout, and continued unrest in the world have made traditional publishing harder to break into and even harder to sustain a career. Savvy authors pivot. Five multi-published, award-winning, globally-minded authors give a state-of-the-industry report from their region of the world. They identify specific challenges they’ve had in the last two years, including launching new books during a pandemic (One out of 10 stars. Highly DON’T recommend!). They also offer tips and techniques on how to keep your writing career rolling when it seems the world is constantly conspiring against you.\n\nAmerican Suzanne Kamata has lived in Shikoku for over 30 years. During the pandemic, she published an award-winning middle grade novel, Pop Flies, Robo-pets and Other Disasters; The Baseball Widow, a novel for adults, and Waiting, her poetry debut. She is an associate professor at Naruto University of Education.\n\nClarissa Goenawan (she/her) is an Indonesian-born Singaporean writer and translator. Her award-winning short stories have appeared in literary magazines and anthologies in Singapore, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Italy, the UK, and the US. Rainbirds, her debut novel, has been published in eleven different languages. Her second novel, The Perfect World of Miwako Sumida, came out in 2020. Watersong is her third novel.\n\nKristin Osani (she/her) is a queer fantasy writer who lives in Kyoto, where she works as a freelance Japanese-to-English video game translator when she’s not wordsmithing, working on nerdy cross-stitching, or cuddling her two cats (three if you include her husband). She has translated games like The Kids We Were, Voice of Cards, and Triangle Strategy. Her original fiction has appeared in FlashPoint SF, the Arcanist, and Ghost Orchid Press’s Beyond the Veil: Supernatural Tales of Queer Love anthology.\n\nClara Kumagai is from Ireland, Canada and Japan. Her fiction and nonfiction has appeared in publications such as The Stinging Fly, The Irish Times, Banshee, Room, Cicada, and The Kyoto Journal, among others. Her children’s story, A Girl Named Indigo, was translated and published in Japanese with the title Indigo wo sagashite (Shogakukan, 2020).

The presenter, Todd Jay Leonard, has published extensively within the ESL/EFL market in Japan and will offer helpful advice to budding authors who wish to pursue projects geared to Japan’s domestic market.\n\nMost likely, every language teacher in Japan has (at some point during his/her tenure) contemplated writing a textbook to fill a void in the market…in that constant search for the perfect, all-encompassing textbook.\n\nIn today’s competitive publishing world, getting the proverbial “foot in the door” can seem daunting and nearly impossible. What are publishers looking for in the current market? What appeals to editors who ultimately decide which titles go to production and which ones do not? What are the salespeople on the front lines hearing from their market base? What must an author do in order to get his/her book published?\n\nThis presentation focuses on these very questions, offering inside insights from all the various points of view that must be considered when writing a proposal to publish a textbook–the publisher, the editor, the salesperson, and the author. Professor Leonard explains the realities within the publishing industry and addresses some common myths associated with EFL publishing.\n\nTodd Jay Leonard has been actively involved in book publishing for 30 years and has published 26 books. He has published books with a number of different Japanese publishing companies and this experience has given him a unique perspective in offering advice to potential authors on what the market is looking for currently and what the publishing industry is searching for in new titles.\n\nHe lives, writes, and teaches on the southern island of Kyushu, where he is a university professor at University of Teacher Education Fukuoka and is the department head for the English Department for the graduate faculty. He has published extensively in academic journals, magazines, and newspapers on cross-cultural, historical, and Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) themes.\n\nZoria Petkoska\n\nArcheologia Poetika: The Poetry Restoration Writing Method\n\nCraft Workshop – A lecture on the method I invented followed by a workshop in which everyone can try it\n\nPoetry\n\nArcheologia Poetika is an idea born out of both doom and hope. What if we lost or damaged the wealth of poems human history has? How can we restore them? It’s an imaginary scenario that led to creating this method.\n\nThe Archeologia Poetika method involves destroying a poem partially and trying to restore it. It drives you to distill the essence of a poet, inhabit their voice, choose your words, be mindful of structure and form.\n\nAside from being an entertaining poetry game, Archeologia Poetika is great for teaching poetry and creative writing. Among poets, it’s a good way to refresh a poem and get ideas for rewrites/edits through how others will “restore” your work.\n\nArcheologia Poetika is a poetry reading/writing method that I came up with circa 2017. Since, I’ve practiced with fellow editors at Tokyo Poetry Journal with great success. See examples here: https://www.topojo.com/post/archeologia-poetika-aka-the-poetry-restoration-method-unearthing-old-21st-century-poetrys\n\nZoria Petkoska is an Associate Editor at Tokyo Poetry Journal, Editor-in-Chief of the literary journal [Ш], and working full time as the Commissioning Editor at Tokyo Weekender magazine.

The more rational global society becomes, it seems, the greater our appetite for supernatural tales. The world of adult contemporary poetry publishing, however, can sometimes be an exception to this rule. This workshop will explore how to write well-crafted poems for readers who would enjoy folklore, myth, fantasy, and science fiction in their poetry—but without alienating journals and publishers. The workshop will consider an array of poetic charms, spells, and hypno-beams (i.e. formal and narrative strategies) to allow poets to write about magic, monsters, and killer robots without being dismissed by journal editors and contest judges. We will practice building a ‘magic inverse’: integrating magic into the music of verse. As A. E. Stallings writes in ‘Listening to Peter and the Wolf with Jason, Aged Three’: ‘I asked him where the wolf is. With grave logic / He answers me, “The wolf is in the music.”’\n\nParticipants are welcome (but not required) to submit a short poem to the workshop. Given the limited session time, not all poems may be discussed, but we will try to look at as many as possible. Workshop poems should be no more than 20 lines, on a theme or subject related to folklore, fantasy, or SF. Please submit your poems by 1 October. Submit to simons@ICU.ac.jp.\n\nChristopher Simons is Senior Associate Professor of Literature at ICU in Tokyo.

For the first ugly draft you need to keep the editor part under reins. However, for subsequent drafts you should gradually allow it more leash. In this session we will look at practical advice, techniques and suggestions on how to improve your editing skills, from working alone to joining a writers group to finally working with an editor. Do and dont’s along the way that may provide some useful insight for you when editing your own work.\n\nDavid, born and raised in Upperchurch in County Tipperary Ireland, currently lives in China.

To join, contact David directly at debidogirubi@gmail.com\n\nThe proposed workshop is based on the familiar and successful structure and strategy as offered by John Gribble at the 2008 JWC and my own over the last twelve years. It will involve my sending out a brief to intending participants requiring submission of drafts of poems, then, before the actual workshop, reading and making comments on each of the participants poems and finally, participating in the workshop discussion itself at the conference.\n\nThis workshop allows writers to work on a poem or two in readiness for publication, recognising that conference delegates are themselves writers, teachers and editors and that there are both personal and professional benefits from a closely-focussed discussion of emerging texts. So the purpose of this workshop is to give a small group of poets the opportunity to meet, read and discuss in depth, a sample of each other’s work. The workshop will be open to a limited number of participants but writers of varying degrees of experience will be welcome. The session will be closed and of two hours duration. There will be two parts to the workshop: preparation and participation. Preparation also has two parts: submitting and close reading. Those who sign up for the session will be contacted before the conference.\n\nDavid Gilbey was Adjunct Senior Lecturer in English at Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, Australia, and the founding President of Wagga Wagga Writers Writers, as well as a poet.

In this presentation Edward will share the simplest of techniques that can used to increase one’s attunement with nature and self, thus increasing our state of receptivity and balance from which all creative endeavors can benefit.\n\nBased on 40+ years of experience with nature meditations and attunement practices, I continuously find they benefit my writing, my photography, and my whole life. The effects of these practices are relevant to any kind of writing: fiction or non-fiction, memoir or poetry, travel writing or journaling, as well as teaching these same subjects. In this presentation, I use selections of my haiku and photographs to illustrate both literally and figuratively the power of breath combined with sharing simple practices to attune to the elements and then go beyond that. The goal is to become aware of the seen and unseen energies that surround us and allow them to become a part of our beings, our personalities, our writer persona, even part of the characters in our writings. From this cultivated attuned space, inspired writing emerges, perhaps not instantaneously, but with continued practice, words will sprout in a fertile field.\n\nEdward Levinson has lived in Japan since 1979. Whisper of the Land, his memoir, was published by Fine Line Press. He is an award-winning photographer and short filmmaker. He lives on Chiba’s Boso Peninsula staying attuned with nature and his garden, which inspires much of his haiku and poetry.\n\nGordon Vanstone\n\nDeveloping a Sense of Place\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A, Group Reading with Q&A\n\nLecture/Reading with Q&A\n\nFiction\n\n‘Place’ in fiction is more than just setting as it informs and enhances character, plot, theme, atmosphere, voice, and language use. Place can play a central role in influencing the narrator’s choices, challenges, and motivations. Citing select passages from my novel, I’ll highlight strategies used to create a strong sense of place and draw readers in.\n\nA crucial aspect of the storyteller’s job is to get your readers immersed in the world of your narrator, only then can you transport them through your tale. Place plays a vital role in this process. It’s most effective when places are portrayed as authentic, engaging, meaningful and relatable. Place can be a powerful tool to generate plot, character development and conflict. The setting becomes more than the backdrop of a novel; it dictates all that happens. It almost comes alive and pulls the reader along with it.\n\nReading select passages of my novel, I’ll highlight strategies used to draw readers in and create a strong sense of place: evoking the senses, capturing the essence (the devil is in the details), setting the scene vs utilising ‘nudges’ to create an accretion of environmental elements, giving locals a voice, showing impact on characters’ actions and emotions, burrowing down from the macro and establishing connections and fluidity between.\n\nGordon currently lives in Singapore. In April 2021, he published his first novel, Rainy Day Ramen and the Cosmic Pachinko, with Monsoon Books. Gordon lived in Japan as an international school teacher for eight years between 2004 and 2015. His novel, in part, is an ode to the country which captured a piece of his heart.\n\nHans Brinckmann\n\nMaintaining Close Connections With a City or Country Can Help Your Career\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nCareer\n\nOne of the many sources of inspiration for a writer is a life-long connection with a certain place – a city or area, or even a country. In my case, I maintained a special connection with Kyoto, going back to the late 1950s, which recently brought surprising literary results.\n\nSome authors focus their writing on certain places. My writings are set in many different locations, but one thread that has continued over time is Kyoto. Ever since the late 1950s, when I interacted with Kyoto artists and oddballs, I’ve stayed in touch, and included Kyoto in several of my writings. In 1970, my essay, Kyoto-san, was the lead article in the inaugural issue of Koto, a Japanese magazine. In 2011, The Tomb in the Kyoto Hills and other stories was published. In 2019 the Writers in Kyoto group invited me to give a lecture on my Kyoto connections, and they included one of my stories in Kyoto Journal, followed by a review of my memoir The Call of Japan. Then, this spring, after joining Writers in Kyoto, I participated in a short-story competition, and won Third Prize! Clearly, my long connection with Kyoto has been richly rewarded.\n\nBorn in Holland in 1932, Hans Brinckmann – though keen on writing – joined an international bank. Assigned to Japan in 1950, he stayed 24 years. He returned to Japan intermittently and since 2003 is a permanent resident and writer of seven works of fiction, non-fiction and poetry.

In this talk I will look at my own writing process as well as that of other writers and discuss the idea of autocomposting and of writer’s block.\n\nMy latest book, the novella “Life is Elsewhere/Burn Your Flags” was written in two days, but was the result of nearly ten years of thinking and planning. Too much attention is given to the part of creative writing where pen meets paper and not enough to everything that comes before, which I will argue is perhaps much more important. In this talk I will look at my own writing process as well as that of other writers who exemplify the concept of writing as a process in which putting words on paper is only one part. I will discuss the idea of autocomposting, of writer’s block and misconceptions about what creative writing looks like in practice.\n\nIain Maloney is originally from Scotland and now lives in Gifu. He is the author of three novels, a haiku collection, a memoir and a new novella, “Life is Elsewhere/Burn your Flags”.\n\nJames Crocker, Andrew Innes\n\nBest of The Font – A Literary Journal for Language Teachers\n\nGroup Reading with Q&A\n\nFiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Career\n\nReadings from Japan-based authors published in The Font in 2020/21\n\nThe Font is a literary journal for language teachers and learners. It has been publishing quality fiction, creative non-fiction, poetry and essays by language teachers and learners since 2013. These are all on the theme of teaching and learning languages at home and abroad. In other words, it is a place for teachers and learners to reflect on their experiences and observations while teaching and learning languages, or while living and teaching abroad.\n\nThis presentation features a selection of the best publications of the past two years, read by the authors themselves. The authors will answer questions after doing their readings.\n\nJames Crocker has published 20 text books and readers for language learning with OUP and Macmillan. He has also published numerous articles on language teaching. James has been editing and publishing The Font since it’s inception.\n\nAndrew Innes is from Cheshire near Manchester in England and since 2002 lives in Himeji. He divides his time between teaching at Mukogawa Women`s University, Himeji Dokkyo University, Kobe Shoin Women`s University and various freelance classes around the Kansai area. He has written on whether teachers can detect if students have used machine translation in their work and the tell-tale signs that they have; and the use of video in class to reduce transactional distance during online teaching. His forthcoming book touches on various themes of interest such as science fiction and how technology can blur the boundaries of our identity (Generation C), psychedelia (Pattern Separation), Cancel culture (Ms. Representation), Othering (The Gaijin Parade), Buddhism (The Koan), The Korean Wave (Veritas), Tourist pollution (When in Rome), New ageism (Digital Detox), horror (The Rotten Mikan), and metamorphosis (The Short Story Collective). He has written three stories for The Font and had a story published in Tokyo Weekender. He describes himself as a new writer and very much learning his craft.\n\nJoanne Anderton\n\nSpeculative fiction autobiography: The joys and the challenges of mixing truth with imagination\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nOther Genre\n\nThis lecture is an exploration of autobiography, speculative fiction, and the way in which we turn lived experience into narrative. I will discuss the joys and challenges of adapting my time living in Japan into a ‘speculative fiction autobiography’, and what other writers can gain from my research and experimentation.\n\nHow do you recount a lived experience, when writing it as a traditional memoir feels incomplete? Is it possible to mingle science fiction, fantasy and horror with autobiography, but maintain a sense of truth?\n\nMy creative writing PhD, The Realness of Unreal Things, is an attempt to do just that. A mixed genre collection, this ‘speculative fiction autobiography’ blends speculative short stories and creative non-fiction, drawn from my time living and working in Japan.\n\nIn this lecture, I will discuss the process of adapting my experiences in this unorthodox way, what’s challenging about it, what’s fascinating about it, and what other writers can gain from my research and experimentation.\n\nThe role of factuality in memoir inhabits a problematic space. I propose that speculative fiction autobiography will enable writers to examine the deeper truths of their lived experience, by freeing us from the difference between the real and the unreal.\n\nJoanne Anderton is an Australian author and PhD candidate. She has won awards for her speculative fiction, which includes the novels Debris, Suited and Guardian, and the short story collection The Bone Chime Song. She has published a children’s picture book and non-fiction in Island, Meanjin and The Japan News.\n\nJoe Palermo\n\nNo Pianos, Pets or Foreigners! Self Publishing a Memoir in eBook, Paperback and Audiobook Format at Minimal Cost\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nNonfiction\n\nA young Japanese woman was running through Tokyo station screaming “Save me! Save me!” There was a Japanese man chasing her and closing in. He grabbed her wrist and caught her about 10 feet in front of me. The woman was still yelling “Save me! Save Me!” but the Japanese people in the crowded station ignored her, not wanting to get involved.\n\nThis is the beginning of one of the stories from my experience living in Japan in the 1980’s, where I had moved right after graduating university. It was still rare to see an American who could speak Japanese fluently. This book guides the reader though my many adventures navigating through Japanese culture while living in the outskirts of Tokyo, as well as Tokyo proper.\n\nI will detail my experience writing and publishing a book and audiobook about my life in Japan, using Amazon KDP and Amazon ACX. I will talk about what I learned through the process and what I would do differently.\n\nJoe Palermo has retired after 30+ years as a corporate executive at the Nielsen Company and Information Resources, Inc. (IRI). He lived and worked in Japan for eight years and is the author of “No Pianos, Pets or Foreigners! My Life in Japan in the 80’s”.\n\nJoy Jarman-Walsh\n\nLive + Engaging Networking via Interviews with Japan Insiders\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nNon-fiction\n\nMoving beyond words on a page by live broadcasting interviews to a worldwide audience in realtime – it seems daunting but is transparent and engaging, reaching new audiences tired of traditional media. If you are researching an article, you are actually prepared to livestream- let me explain how to do it, and why it’ll make your content better.\n\nI’ve been on a crazy and unexpected journey researching and hosting daily interviews with various experts and insiders in Japan, or abroad who are focused on Japan, to dive into what it means to seek sustainability. A big part of seeking sustainability is transparency, which I think is also critical for good writing, which can be achieved by engaging with your audience as you create the content. I believe that one of the best ways to do this is by livestreaming content to engage with a wider audience. As of the end of May, I’ve done over 250 live interviews and the comments and questions of live viewers has been an important aspect of the finished product. I think this concept can inform and improve almost any type of writing project. There are key strategies to prepping for interviews as well as running live talkshows which engage with a live audience. There is also post-production work that needs to be done, including getting the interview onto a podcast platform. I will lay out not only the why’s but also the how-to’s of the process.\n\nJoy Jarman-Walsh (jjwalsh) runs a daily livestream talkshow called #SeekingSustainabilityLive which had it’s 250th episode in May 2021.

You can have your memoir stand out in this crowd by telling a story—one that is compelling and captivates readers. And assuming you’re not a celebrity, readers of memoirs want to know: “What’s so interesting about this person’s life that will induce me to read it?” You need to tell them on Page One.\n\nWritten well, your memoir will have momentum and not just be a collection of vignettes: “I went there, I did that.” Your reward in writing your story well will be in having readers not only relate, but care. And caring is what gets them from the first page to the last.\n\nIn this talk we’ll address, ask, and answer the question: How do we write a life as a story?\n\nKaren Hill Anton wrote the “Crossing Cultures” column for The Japan Times for fifteen years. Originally from New York City, she has lived in rural Shizuoka prefecture since 1975. Her memoir The View From Breast Pocket Mountain is winner of the SPR Book Awards Gold Prize, and the Book Readers Appreciation Group Medallion. https://www.karenhillanton.com\n\nLiane Wakabayashi\n\nMarketing Your Memoir Long Before It’s Completed\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nNonfiction\n\nThis lecture begins anecdotally, with Liane recalling the advice of a New York book publishing industry insider, who taught her how to take the long-range view of completing a memoir–by publishing extracts. She’ll walk you through the steps of reaching your audience, publishing one story at a time, and thereby communicating with your audience while your book is still in progress.\n\nOne of the best pieces of advice I ever got was that promoting a book essentially begins on the day we start writing it. When you’re immersed in writing a memoir, perhaps the last thing that you’re thinking about is pressing the pause button to market excerpts of your unfinished book to print and online magazines, or reading it out loud or on Zoom to your intended audience. In this lecture, we’ll talk about the why’s, the how’s and the when’s, step by step. As a journalist with nearly 40 years experience, I’d like to help inspire you to take the best excerpts of your memoir, let them be read, get your name known, and feel your confidence to soar, especially at the critical mid-point in book writing. Surely, the road to memoir completion is both a test of nerves and faith, and when someone else believes in your book, you are much more likely to as well.\n\nLiane Grunberg Wakabayashi, raised in New York City, lived in Tokyo from 1987 to 2017, when Israel tugged at her heartstrings.

Chutzpah is the way towards valuing our ideas enough to make bold moves.\n\nWe will explore the idea of “chutzpah”, the yiddish word for having the courage and audacity as writers. Publishing, in itself, is a series of steps that carry us from the private to the public, but all too often, the writer must navigate self-sabotaging thoughts, thoughts that keep the writer and the words cut off. Chutzpah is the antidote, bringing levity and spunk, shoring up the writer to harness the confidence to pitch effective ideas and drafts. It can bring our whole process of writing from meek to tremendous.\n\nThis workshop will look at the whole process, from seed idea to published piece and even onto the next step. Inspecting an idea and finding it good and profitable, we nurture it, (just how this looks will be discussed in-session) aiming big–to pitch the magazines, editors, and book queries from a place of strength and assurance in our identity, ideas, and work.\n\nParticipants will see where they have also thought “big”, taking an idea, finding its worth, and then growing it to pitch, whether inviting collaboration, beginning a new project, all of the “thinking big”. We will take part in an activity that inspires and ignites “big thinking” and all of the chutzpah we need as writers.\n\nMelissa leads creative writing camps, collaborating with Japan-based authors and illustrators. Her essays appear in places such as The Washington Post, LA Review of Books, Brevity, Kyoto Journal, Taste, The Japan Times, and the Sunlight Press. She is featured in various anthologies like Mothering Through the Darkness and Knocked Up Abroad Again. Melissa will be launching online workshops on the subject of Jewish Food Writing.\n\nMichael Frazier\n\nA Poem is a Thing that Moves: Contemporary Lyric Poems\n\nCraft Workshop\n\nPoetry\n\nA lyric poem is a thing that moves, through time, one’s mind, and, in turn, moves the hearts of readers. We will read and analyze lyric poems that move towards unanswerable questions, via associative jumps, by Leila Chatti, Li-Young Lee, and Aracelis Girmay. We will write our own lyric poems!\n\nScan through most recently released poetry collections and you are bound to find poems marked not by chronological narratives, but by incongruent images, ideas, and questions seemingly held together by only a distinct first-person voice and the magic of poetry. In this workshop we want to dispel the illusion of the non-linear lyric poem. We will read a handful of lyric poems that rely on associative jumps by Leila Chatti, L-Young Lee, Terrance Hayes, and Aracelis Girmay. We will analyze how these writers navigate through a poem (motifs, music, etc.), and pursue a question to arrive at a new revelation (the turn). As a result, we will understand how their poems are maps for how their actual minds move and perceive the world. A poem is a thing that moves, through time, one’s mind, and, in turn, moves the hearts of readers. Under scaffolded prompting, we will write our own lyric poems that prioritize the patterns of our psyche.\n\nMichael Frazier is a poet & HS Teacher living in Kanazawa, Japan.

Wilson shares her journey of launching her own press, plus tips and resources for starting your own.\n\nUntil recently, you couldn’t get published without gatekeepers, who not only dictated your content but took 90%+ of your profits. The alternative was exploitation at the other extreme by vanity publishers charging outrageous sums to print your book.\n\nInnovation over the past decade has changed everything. You can hire top-tier freelance editors, designers, and illustrators easily and safely through online marketplaces. You can affordably print a single book, or a thousand, or distribute ebooks and audiobooks. With personal websites, newsletter sign-ups, social media, and more, you can build a tribe of fans directly. Add to this the warm and collaborative support that indie authors and publishers offer one another, and you’ll never bother pitching an agent again!\n\nSarah Hinlicky Wilson shows how she launched her own press—and how you can, too.\n\nSarah Hinlicky Wilson is the author of 200+ articles and multiple books. She co-hosts the podcast “Queen of the Sciences: Conversations between a Theologian and Her Dad” and writes the quarterly e-newsletter “Theology & a Recipe.” She is associate pastor at Tokyo Lutheran Church and founder of Thornbush Press.\n\nSteven Wolfson\n\nDevelopment 101: A Workshop on the ins and outs of Screenplay Development\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nScreenwriting\n\nThis workshop focuses on what really happens when a screenplay is developed for production. From issues of character and story to three-act structure and commercial viability, the class will look at the development process from both the perspective of the writer and the production company or studio.\n\nWhether you are writing a studio feature or an independent film, at some point your script will enter the process known as ‘development.’ This workshop focuses on what really happens when a screenplay is developed for production. From issues of character and story to three-act structure and commercial viability, the class will look at the development process from both the perspective of the writer and the production company or studio. Through a series of writing exercises, students will learn how to manage script notes while at the same time protecting the integrity of their screenplay. The final goals of the workshop are a demystification of the development process and the tools to make your screenplay as production-friendly as possible.\n\nSteven Wolfson has taught screenwriting, playwriting and creative writing at The Writers Program at UCLA for the past 20 years and holds the distinction of having created the most new classes, workshops and seminars of any instructor in the program’s history. He has been awarded The Outstanding Instructor of the Year award twice, in both screenwriting and creative writing. As a screenwriter, Wolfson has sold projects to Fox, Lions Gate, TNT, MTV, Langley Entertainment, Beacon Films and producer Arnold Rifkin. Wolfson wrote the independent romantic comedy, Dinner and Driving, which premiered at The Austin Film Festival and went on to win audience awards at several film festivals and was sold to HBO. Wolfson also wrote and co-produced the critically acclaimed Lionsgate feature, Gang Tapes, a coming-of-age drama set in South Central, Los Angeles. Gang Tapes played to sold out audiences at film festivals in both The United States and Europe.\n\nSuzanne Kamata\n\nClara Kiyoko Kumagai, Kristin Osani , Clarissa Goenawan, Sara Fujimura\n\nWriting Identity, From Inside and Outside\n\nPanel Discussion\n\nFiction\n\nIn this era of #ownvoices and a heightened awareness of identity politics, what stories should be told, who should be allowed to write them, and how they should be presented are often contentious issues. In this moderated session, five authors of different backgrounds, writing inside and out of their lanes, will discuss diversity, identity, inclusivity, and their own experiences and approaches to writing these in their own work.\n\nIdentity politics play a large part in determining which stories are published and how they are currently received in the English-speaking market. Generation Z readers — the audience for YA and New Adult titles — are especially aware of issues surrounding diversity, appropriation, and ownership. In this session, to be moderated by Suzanne Kamata, four authors of different backgrounds, writing about Japan from inside and out of their lanes, will discuss diversity, identity, inclusivity, and their own experiences and approaches to writing these in their own work.\n\nIn this era of #ownvoices and a heightened awareness of identity politics, what stories should be told, who should be allowed to write them, and how they should be presented are often contentious issues.

I will discuss various question formats, writing with brevity and clarity, organizing categories, anticipating and heading off disputes, making obscure questions guessable, and techniques for flattering your audience by writing easy questions that sound hard.\n\n“I once attended a pub quiz in Bristol where a dispute over an answer resulted in a wild west-style brawl and the police had to be called,” a woman told the BBC in 2005. “Arrests were made, including the quizmaster.”\n\nQuizzes should be fun. If you wish to host one that doesn’t end in tears – or behind bars – well-written questions are essential.\n\nDrawing on my experience as both a contestant and a quizmaster, I will offer tips on how to write questions that are clear, entertaining, and minimally disputable.\n\nUsing examples from quizzes seen on TV and at pubs around Tokyo, I will discuss a variety of question formats, writing with brevity and clarity, ways of organizing categories, anticipating hecklers and nit-pickers, making obscure questions guessable, and the importance of flattering your audience by writing easy questions that sound hard.\n\nTom Baker appeared on four regular-season episodes of the U.S. quiz show “Jeopardy!” in 2004, before returning for the season-ending Tournament of Champions. He first guest-hosted a round of a Tokyo pub quiz in 2019, and has written and presented more than 20 rounds since then.\n\nHe presented over 20 rounds of questions live at a monthly charity pub quiz held at the Footnik bar in Ebisu, Tokyo, before the pandemic began, and has continued on Zoom since then. Topics have included “The FBI 10 Most Wanted List,” “Pigs and Rats,” “Literary Works,” “Officeholders,” “Prime Numbers,” “Traveling Around Japan,” “Body Parts” and “Motorcycle Gangs and Clubs.”\n\nWalt Mussell\n\nAcross Time and Time Zones: Researching history from half a world away.\n\nShort Lecture with Q&A\n\nFiction\n\nPresentation will discuss ways to do historical research on Japan while residing in another country. Presentation will include tips from famous authors on how they performed research (including non-Japan). Presentation to offer Q&A for attendees who wish to submit their own challenges and brainstorm ways to solve them.\n\nJapan is the inspiration for the presenter’s works. He spent four years there in the 90s, met his wife there, and has visited several times since. However, his last visit was in 2008 and his first book, The Samurai’s Heart, was published in 2017. The presenter will detail the challenges he faced in researching Japanese history from the southern U.S. and what he has done to overcome it.\n\nIn addition, the presenter will introduce a list of challenges faced by historical authors that research not only Japan but histories of other countries as well. Detailing the challenges faced by other authors will hopefully provide attendees ideas as to how they might creatively pursue their own research challenges.\n\nLastly, the presenter will engage the attendees to bring up their own research challenges and the group will brainstorm on ways to help the writers solve their challenges.\n\nWalt Mussell lives in an Atlanta-area suburb. He writes historicals, mostly about Japan where he lived for four years. He refers to his work as “Like Shogun, but the heroine survives.” His works include The Samurai’s Honor, The Samurai’s Heart, and A Second Chance.

Film directed by Yoshiaki Tago. Performance directed by Carla Blank. A Japan premiere. The film is 1 hour and 14 minutes long.\n\nFukushima is the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. It will take decades and billions of dollars to keep the multiple meltdowns under control. Spewed radiation has reached as far as the American West Coast. Some 100,000 people were displaced from the no-go zone. But, 10 years after 3.11, the story hardly makes headlines.\n\nJournalist Yuri Kageyama turns to poetry, dance, theater, music and film, to remind us that the human stories must not be forgotten. Carla Blank, who has collaborated with Suzushi Hanayagi and Robert Wilson, brings together a multicultural cast of artists to direct this provocative theater piece. Performing at ZSpace in San Francisco are U.S.-based actors/dancers Takemi Kitamura, Monisha Shiva, Shigeko Sara Suga. The musicians are Stomu Takeishi, Isaku Kageyama and Joe Small, as well as Japan-based Kouzan Kikuchi. Lighting design by Blu. Video by Yoshiaki Tago, who also directed the film. The film has won various awards, including Best Documentary Feature at the Rome International Movie Awards and Grand Festival Award at the Berkeley Video and Film Festival. It is still making the festival rounds and is not yet widely available to the public. The showing will be a Japan premiere. We are interested in getting feedback from this literary audience. Parts of the piece were first published in Ishmael Reed’s literary magazine KONCH in 2015. Reed called it, “A powerful reflection on the corruption and greed of men and their indifference to human life.” An earlier version debuted at LaMama in New York, with music led by Melvin Gibbs, in 2015.\n\nYuri Kageyama is a poet, journalist, filmmaker and author of THE NEW AND SELECTED YURI (Ishmael Reed Publishing, 2011).

I will explore the ways poetry can be futuristic, where it overlaps with concrete poetry in its use of asemic elements, and how can we employ AI writers.\n\nSpliced with coding, images and sounds, cyber poetry or digital poetry (to use two of the most prominent terms for this still-emerging genre) is getting ever more popular and complex thanks to leaps in technology. It certainly seems anachronistic to not use technology as a tool or as a theme in poetry, seeing how it is an integral part of our lives. One might say that when we started publishing poems on websites that was an early form of cyber poetry. However, not everyone is using the full potential of technology to create cyber poetry. We will discuss all the ways technology can be a tool, down to employing AI generators as writers. This will also raise the question of authorship and credit. I will also explore the overlaps with concrete poetry, and the difference from sci-fi writing.\n\nZoria Petkoska K. is an Associate Editor at Tokyo Poetry Journal, editor-in-chief of the literary journal [Ш], and an Assistant Editor at Tokyo Weekender magazine.

Which makes the first sentence especially important! We’ll talk about what what kind of first sentence, first paragraph, first sequence pulls the reader out of the everyday world and into the world of your story.\n\nA story boils down to three elements: who, what, and where. Character, plot, and setting. To pull a reader into a story, from the first words you have to serve up some combination of those elements. But to keep the reader going, you have to paradoxically nourish the reader with information that simultaneously famishes the reader for more. As T.S. Eliot said in Gerontion, “the giving famishes the craving.” We’ll start by examining the opening lines of Ken Follett’s The Key to Rebecca—one of the best opening sequences ever:\n\nThe last camel collapsed at noon.\n\nIt was the five-year-old white bull he had bought in Gialo, the youngest and strongest of the three beasts, and the least ill-tempered: he liked the animal as much as a man could like a camel, which is to say that he hated it only a little.\n\nBarry Eisler spent three years in a covert position with the CIA’s Directorate of Operations, then worked as a technology lawyer and startup executive in Silicon Valley and Japan, earning his black belt at the Kodokan Judo Institute along the way.\n\nEisler’s award-winning thrillers have been included in numerous “Best Of” lists, have been translated into nearly twenty languages, and include the #1 bestsellers Livia Lone, The Night Trade, and The Killer Collective. Eisler lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and, when he’s not writing novels, blogs about national security and the media. www.barryeisler.com\n\nChristopher Simons\n\nVirtuosity in Verse: Writing Powerful Cross-Disciplinary Poems\n\nCraft Workshop\n\nPoetry\n\nThis poetry workshop will discuss and practice strategies for writing short poems that use concepts and vocabulary from cross-disciplinary subjects that may be unfamiliar to most readers. The goal of the workshop will be to create poems that are clear and engaging without compromising their complexity of thought and language.\n\nThe workshop will look at poems on non-literary subjects (or not conventionally literary subjects) such as medicine, astrophysics, economics, politics, anthropology, linguistics, psychology. . . anything that uses concepts and technical vocabulary that aren’t immediately obvious to the general reader. How can a poem of 20 lines engage with new or challenging concepts and theories in such a way that the poem maintains the ’truth’ of the other discipline, but isn’t dry or obscure?\n\nPoets want their work to be published and read as widely as possible; this reality drives poets and publishers towards poems built on simple subjects, clear vocabularies, and familiar feelings. Yet our world is anything but simple. In order to remain relevant, poetry must engage with new scientific and technological vocabularies; new idioms from politics and popular culture; new kinds of relationships. This workshop will explore strategies for writing and revising poems about cross-disciplinary subjects that use vocabulary, images, and concepts that most readers may find unfamiliar. How can a short poem of this kind show the reader what the poem is about, without ruining the poetry? How can such a poem find an audience, or create one? Should poets use footnotes, or expect (or even demand) that readers Google as they read? This session will workshop poems submitted in advance; however, participants are welcome to attend without submitting work.\n\nChristopher Simons is Senior Associate Professor of Literature at ICU in Tokyo.

I will talk about this and voice in general, its importance and techniques used to achieve it. This will be followed by a Q&A and contributions/suggestions from those in attendance.\n\nVoice is perhaps the most important quality in writing fiction yet the most difficult to achieve. I will read from my novel Upperdown which has gained praise for it’s distinctive voice. I will also discuss and give examples of other writers who have achieved distinctive voices for their characters. You can have a brilliant story but if the execution of the voice doesn’t bring it to life, the story will be like the tree falling in the woods with nobody to hear it. However, you can get away with a mediocre story if you have a very distinctive voice. A good writing voice is idiosyncratic, representative of humanity and imperfect. This lecture and reading hopes to touch on the topic of not being afraid to follow the imperfection of voice.\n\nDavid currently lives in Suzhou. In June 2019 he published his first novel, Upperdown, with epoque press. He was been nominated for the Hennessey Award 2019/2020. He was one of the winners of the Irish Novel Fair 2018.

This year it will be offered via Zoom Participants will submit drafts of poems which will be circulated so each can read and prepare comments. In the workshop writers will read their work and participants will provide editorial advice.\n\nThis workshop allows writers to work on a poem or two in readiness for publication, recognising that there are both personal and professional benefits from a closely-focussed discussion of emerging texts. So the purpose of this workshop is to give a small group of poets the opportunity to meet, read and discuss in depth a sample of each other’s work. Writers of varying degrees of experience are welcome. There will be two parts to the workshop: preparation and participation. Preparation also has two parts: submitting and close reading those who sign up for the session, all of whom will be contacted before the conference.\n\nTo sign up, contact David directly at debidogirubi@gmail.com\n\nDavid Gilbey was Adjunct Senior Lecturer in English at Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, Australia, and the founding President of Wagga Wagga Writers Writers, as well as a poet.

It eventually went out of print, but second-hand copies remained available on amazon at exorbitant prices – up to US$1,300! Its popularity made me decide to republish the book, with a new section covering the years up to now. The successor to the original publisher agreed to issue it under a new title, “The Call of Japan: a Continuing Story – 1950 to the Present Day.”\n\nThe success of the original book was no doubt due to the personal nature of the story, and its roots in the postwar period, which was supported by the journal I kept over the years. It provided the flavour of authenticity, essential for a good memoir\n\nAward-winning author Hans Brinckmann (URL: https://habri.jp), born in The Hague, after a 36-year career as a “reluctant banker” turned to writing fiction, non-fiction and poetry.

I began writing a series of columns for Gaijinpot about my experiences as the only gaijin in the village, which was published as a memoir in spring 2020.\n\nThis presentation will focus on making narratives out of the real world experiences, both personal and from contemporary history. There are two sides to this coin: I will talk about the process of fictionalizing real events, looking at writers such as David Peace, while touching on my own fiction work. I will also look at turning everyday experiences into memoir. I will talk about the process of moving from writing fiction to narrative non-fiction, the similarities between the two forms and the challenges inherent in leaving the imaginary for the actual. I will also talk about appropriation, and the tensions between factual accuracy and the requirements of storytelling.\n\nIain Maloney teaches English and creative writing at Nagoya University of Foreign Studies.

It has since expanded to over 50 paid-up members. What do they do? Why do they exist? And what lessons can be learnt?\n\nWriters in Kyoto is a group of some 50 published and self-published English-language authors with a special connection to the ancient capital. It is run on a membership basis and is involved with promotion, book launches, readings, the exchange of information, and social events.

Aren’t they expensive? Are they difficult? Are they any good? What sort of program should I look at? What kind of benefits should I expect to receive? These questions and others will be addressed in this session.\n\nMasters of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and other advanced degrees with a writing emphasis have become a viable option for those seeking to improve their writing skills and advance themselves professionally. Some programs are full- or part-time on a university campus, some are on-line, some are hybrids, blending elements of both. The panelists, all with advanced writing degrees, will each talk about the programs they attended, their own experiences and answer your questions.\n\nJohn Gribble is a noted gasbag.
