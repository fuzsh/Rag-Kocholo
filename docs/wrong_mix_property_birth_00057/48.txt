It's a beautiful day I / II

The 90s saw a genre of music termed Shibuya-kei ("Shibuya-esque"). These works represent the rhythm and tone of that sound through geometrical motifs and use of color. Computer-generated rhythms, analog fluctuations and the feel of layers of sound have been recreated here in an abstract form.

These works represent Shibuya through the practically coalescing group of buildings in the city and the buildings soon to be completed. The parts that make up the walls of the buildings are drawn fluidly without taking on definite form.

These works depict Shibuya, an everchanging city, and its everchanging skyline. The countless primary colors used in these paintings represent the energies of the people who visit the city.

SOUNDS OF SHIBUYA “J-POP”/ “HIPHOP”/ “TECHNO”/ “METAL”

Shibuya, the origin point of youth culture. All kinds of music come pouring out street shops, mixing with the noise of the streets to create the sounds of the Shibuya environment. It almost seems to symbolize the scramble of intersecting peoples, generations and values. The personalities of each person create the harmony and unity of strangeness and peculiarity which form the city we call Shibuya. For this event, I have created a series of four paintings that visualize the four genres of music that I imagine when I hear the words "Sounds of Shibuya."

This piece takes as its theme the well-known story of the faithful dog, Hachiko.

The time Hachiko spent as the loving companion of his owner, Hidesaburo Ueno, is said to have been barely 16 months, but the months and years followed Ueno's sudden death, when he would nevertheless come to Shibuya Station to wait for him, extended many times that to almost a full decade. My chest always tightens imagining what he must have felt.

Tired after his years of waiting, Hachiko, whose name is also the Japanese word for "8," lay down one day, forming an "∞" shape, before crossing the Rainbow Bridge to the other side. He was then finally reunited with the person he loved most. I can only imagine how happy he must have been. This picture depicts just that moment. It is drawn in the hope that the two can be together forever in the next world.

Professor

When we think of Hachiko, we tend to imagine the faithful dog who waited and waited for his owner, Professor Ueno. But Hachiko was also beloved by many other people, such as the mother of broadcast writer Fumio Takada , who would often feed him in Shibuya. So, some people like to say that far from waiting faithfully for the professor, Hachiko was just a dumb dog who came to Shibuya Station because people fed it. I cannot hide my excitement at the idea that this version of Hachiko wound up being cast in bronze and surviving to this day as the symbol of Shibuya. Hachiko the best boy!

Vestiges of the City

hibuya seems to me like a city that is always under construction and where the culture of the city is always gradually changing.

Finding vestiges that remain within this everchanging city is the archaeological fieldwork for Shibuya's street culture crowd, fieldwork that I think once again gives rise to new culture. This piece is created to visualize this feeling of being repainted from above while the things that remain entangle themselves while being connected to somewhere else.

Carpe Diem Kekkai

Carpe diem may be the antonym of memento mori, but put against each other back to back they mean the same thing. Let's eat drink and be merry! Let's value the time we call now and seize the beautiful day we call today. Because the world is an uncertain place.

This painting colorfully depicts feelings and memories that come tumbling out of daily life, taking ordinary, immediately visible scenes such as buildings and plants as its motifs. I have enjoyed the culture of Shibuya since I was a high school student, be it the shopping, fashion or art. I also visit it as a place to communicate with friends. The many colorful windows of this piece invite the viewer to imagine the people gathering there, portraying a dream-like world at the intersection of the ordinary and extraordinary.

NEUROMANCER

In the pit that is Shibuya a chaotic magic accumulates.

In the past the energy of that chaos would give rise spontaneously to new systems of values.

But amidst the new cityscape born of the redevelopment of Shibuya in recent years, I feel those magics have been driven out.

Rather than the new stories that come out of those jumbles of inorganic buildings, I am interested in the melting pot of energy that used to be here.

And so, I have created this piece as a kind of requiem for that Shibuya.

The title comes from the William Gibson science fiction novel, which gave rise to the idea of cyberpunk.

If I had to put it into words, I would call it the Shibuya City Blues.

"The Wall" SBY MIX 2023

As you walk around Shibuya you encounter works of graffiti and wall art. New pieces are painted again over the top of older ones. This piece samples those works of graffiti and recreates them on the canvas, before removing the color from the image to extract just the silhouettes of those motifs, expressing them in a more abstract form.

Puzzle

Shibuya grows and develops like a living creature while emitting a signal from its own antenna. Even though I have long grown accustomed to the city, I still find myself getting lost in confusion amidst Shibuya's everchanging faces, wandering above and below ground as though through a puzzle while tracing out memories. I have attempted to visualize the image of the Shibuya that welcomes me in so carefree a manner not as a real city, but in a colorful way.

Mica Suga

Born in Oita, Suga studied fashion illustration at Setsu Mode Seminar and etching at a lithography workshop. Inspired by fashion and design advertising and magazines, she became an illustrator. She now puts out her own work that spans genre boundaries as a form of self-expression. In addition to her works incorporating collages using traditional Japanese tissue paper (washi) for engravings, her art is also defined by direct expressions of people and imaginary landscapes using acrylics and oils. Her work has a running theme of mystery and illogicality.

May

When I was a student, I would come to record shops to encounter new music, big bookstores to look at the art and photo albums amidst all the other stimulations offered by the city of Shibuya. Holding my first private exhibition here, I also encountered like-minded people.

I hope that Shibuya is able to continue to be a place where cultures and people can mingle.

Through this piece I have attempted to visualize a city constantly emitting bracing light that inspires bright futures.

Diagram of a Quantum Garden - Shibuya, Tokyo

This work takes as its themes "space" and "gardens." It is an image of a Shibuya garden that draws inspiration from quantum physics. The painting suggests that in the "bit valley" of Shibuya, where all manner of information and all kinds of people's workings intersect day and night, a multiplicity of realities exist. The artist hopes that as the new stories of people from across the world who visit Shibuya recur, the future continues to be born.

Chizuko Ninomiya

Chizuko Ninomiya

Chizuko Ninomiya initially studied law as a student before working as a systems engineer at a financial institution, before being active as a contemporary artist.

While mobile devices have become pervasive and telecommunications networks have been established, giving people more opportunity than even to encounter images that are the result of processing by digital systems, consciousness of the systems and processes behind those images remains largely absent.

In recent years, she has reconstructed and presented programming languages and processing as art pieces, turning her attention to themes of "casting light on unseen things" at the same time as looking at the "ethics/ideology (of a technology-wielding humanity)."

Hewing to the idea that the history of art is inseparable from the history of technology, Ninomiya produces works that act as hooks into the near future, incorporating elements of the exponentially advancing technology of our day while commenting on human ethics.

City of Evolution

While the graffiti, stickers and taggings you see all around the streets of Shibuya continue to be chaotically overwritten atop one another, viewed observationally over a long span of time, they can be read as stored up "street history." My own work, with its overlapping random images, bears a resemblance to it. This piece expresses a Shibuya that is a city at the apex of "time and the accumulation of history" as a "crystallization of human progress and wisdom." In making this piece, I walked around the center of Shibuya at night, gathering the "lights" emitted from advertisements, neon signs and construction sites, sampling them in my own work. In the culture that colors this place, I feel an energy that progresses beyond the city, beyond nations and beyond time.
