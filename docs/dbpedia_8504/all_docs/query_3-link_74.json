today's\n\nspeaker.\n\nI'm going to start with\n\na few notes about the\n\nfornat of our event.\n\nWe have time at the\n\nend for questions.\n\nPlease write your\n\nquestions on the index\n\ncards that have been\n\nhanded out.\n\nIf you need another\n\none flag down Bonnie\n\nhere and We'll keep an\n\neye out and We'll\n\ncollect those starting\n\nat about 4:30\n\nor so.\n\nFor those of us\n\njoining online, please\n\ntweet your questions\n\nusing the hash tag\n\npolicy talks and We'll\n\ntranscribe those on\n\nthe cards here\n\nourselves.\n\nJoining us to present\n\nthe questions is the\n\nstudents.\n\nFirst it Richardson\n\nand lily Alexander.\n\nThey will ask the\n\nquestions to our\n\nspeaker today and will\n\nbe assisted by a\n\nuniversity of Michigan\n\nstudent Michael wolf\n\nwho will be assisted\n\nby Sarah mills our --\n\nour senior project\n\nmanager.\n\nSarah has been leading\n\nan effort on campus to\n\nbring together\n\nfaculty, staff and\n\nstudents from across\n\nthe campus to look at\n\nissues across the\n\nurban rural divide.\n\nThey take particular\n\napproaching looking\n\nmore along a spectrum\n\nas opposed to\n\nconceiving them as\n\nacross a divide.\n\nSo we close our event\n\ntoday with a couple of\n\nnotes about a\n\nfollowing event.\n\nFinally I like to\n\nthank Bonnie Roberts,\n\nour events manager for\n\npulling together for\n\nyou today, great job,\n\nthank you Bonnie.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nToday's talk is\n\nabout listening to\n\nstrength in democracy.\n\nIt is sponsored by\n\nclose-up and the Ford\n\nschool.\n\nAs part of the\n\ninitiative of\n\ndifferences.\n\nI think we feel the\n\nstrain that our\n\ncountry is under,\n\ntrib\n\ntribalism plaguing our\n\npolitics.\n\nThe Ford school is\n\ncommitted to playing a\n\nleading role in public\n\ndiscourse that is\n\nnonpartisan and\n\nevidence based and\n\ninclusive.\n\nWe host public events\n\nthat model reason and\n\nevidence based debate\n\nand to explore issues\n\naround identity and\n\ndifference.\n\nWe developed new\n\nstudent programming\n\nand curriculum to\n\ntrain our students in\n\nhow to bridge\n\ndifference,\n\nproductively discuss\n\ncontested topics and\n\nnegotiate.\n\nWe practice trust\n\nbuilding through a\n\nproblem solving and --\n\nand procedural noev\n\nva\n\n-- innovation and\n\nlearning and solving\n\nproblems aCcross\n\ndifferences.\n\nWe generate diversity.\n\nThe school has a deep\n\nmission driven\n\ncommitment to the\n\nvalues of scholarship,\n\nrespectful dialogue\n\nand inclusive\n\ncommunity.\n\nOur graduate and under\n\ngraduate students, we\n\nhelp them to make\n\nprogress on difficult\n\nproblems through\n\nconstructive dialogue\n\nand action across\n\ndivides.\n\nSo today's talk by\n\nKathy Cramer is a\n\nperfect fit.\n\nWe're proud to\n\nannounce she earned\n\nher Ph.D. and she's\n\nthe anatomy chair and\n\nprofessor at Wisconsin\n\nMadison and senior\n\nadv\n\nadvisor at cortico to\n\nfoster public\n\ndiscourse among the\n\npublic but with also\n\namong the media to\n\nhelp us develop a\n\nbetter understanding\n\nof one another.\n\nSheil talk about some\n\nof this work today.\n\nKathy's work focuses\n\non the way that people\n\nin the United States\n\nmake sense of our\n\npolitics and their\n\nplace in it.\n\nShe's award winning\n\nauthor and known for\n\nan innovative approach\n\nto the study of public\n\nopinion in which she\n\nintroduces herself in\n\nto conversations -- of\n\ngroups of people to\n\nlisten and -- and get\n\na better understanding\n\nof how they make sense\n\nof public issues.\n\nShe's author of\n\n\"policies of\n\nresentment\" makes\n\nsense of this\n\napproach.\n\nSo rather than take\n\nany more time from\n\nKathy's talk you could\n\nread more of her\n\nreally impressive bio\n\nin your program.\n\nPlease join me in\n\nwelcoming Kathy\n\nKramer.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nHi, everyone.\n\nThank you so much for\n\nhaving me.\n\nBonnie Roberts, thank\n\nyou so much for all of\n\nthe logistics.\n\nShe's sort of amazing\n\nperson and if you need\n\nBonnie and\n\norganization in your\n\nlife, talk to her.\n\nI've only been here a\n\nfew hours but had a\n\nfabulous visit.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThank you Tom and\n\nSarah, thank you.\n\nYes, I am a proud\n\ngraduate of the\n\npolitical science\n\nprogram here at\n\nMichigan and I want to\n\ngive out a shout out\n\nto Don kinder who I\n\nsee in the room, a\n\ndear friend that\n\ntaught me the value of\n\nstudying the things\n\nyou care most about in\n\nthe world.\n\nYou'll see in short\n\norder I'm going to\n\ntell a series of\n\nstories.\n\nYou'll see in short\n\norder that I was very\n\nfortunate to -- to\n\nstudy political\n\nscience here because\n\nit was an environment\n\nin which I learned all\n\nof the cutting edge\n\nskills and I also\n\nlearned ideas of\n\npursuing ideas I care\n\nabout and important to\n\nthe world and the\n\nmethods by which I did\n\nthat were less\n\nimportant than\n\nstudying important\n\nthings and I owe a lot\n\nof that, the courage\n\nto do that to Don who\n\nsupported me from very\n\nearly on.\n\nSo, let me tell you\n\nstories.\n\nWhen I was a college\n\ngraduate student here,\n\nI was fortunate to get\n\ninvolved with Kent\n\nJennings who recently\n\nretired from the\n\nuniversity of\n\nCalifornia Santa\n\nBarbara.\n\nHe had been engage in\n\na study of political\n\nsocialization.\n\nIn the 1997 I was\n\ninvolved with that\n\npro\n\nproject.\n\nIt was a study of high\n\nschool seniors in 1965\n\nand they were followed\n\nover the course of\n\ntheir life.\n\nPart of my job was to\n\ninterview these folks\n\nin rural areas of the\n\ndeep south.\n\nSo I was doing --\n\nbasically a survey, a\n\nlaptop based survey in\n\npeople's homes, asking\n\nthem questions like\n\nthis.\n\nThis is a famous\n\nMichigan question\n\nabout identity.\n\nGenerally do you\n\nconsider yourself a\n\nDemocrat or republican\n\nor what?\n\nRepublican, democratic\n\nor what?\n\nPeople record the\n\nanswers.\n\nAt the time a lot was\n\ndo not on paper and\n\nyou had to fill out\n\nthe paperwork and send\n\nit back to the\n\ninstitute here or the\n\nsurvey research\n\ncenter.\n\nI was spending a lot\n\nof time in post\n\noffices.\n\nSo places like this,\n\nmailing these things\n\nback and rural areas,\n\npost offices are\n\nimportant hub of the\n\ncommunity.\n\nMost people have post\n\noffice boxes and they\n\nstop in about once a\n\nday, maybe it changed\n\nover time as surface\n\nmail becomes less a\n\npart of their lives,\n\nthey stop in and get\n\nthe news and move on.\n\nI was interested in\n\nthe conversations I\n\nwas encountering in\n\nthose places as well\n\nas the conversations I\n\nwas having with these\n\nsurvey respondents\n\nafter the survey was\n\nover.\n\nFrom pretty early on\n\nin my life as a\n\npolitical scientist, I\n\nknew I was interested\n\nin conversation.\n\nI knew I picked up a\n\nlot about their lives\n\nand about the way they\n\nunderstood politics\n\nfrom listening to them\n\ntalk with one another.\n\nSo again I owe a lot\n\nof credit to this\n\nuniversity saying yes,\n\nthat's interesting and\n\nwe support glou\n\nstudying it in\n\nwhatever way you think\n\nis useful.\n\nSo fast forward a bit.\n\nAcross the course of\n\nmy career this is\n\nbasically the question\n\nI've been pursuing,\n\nhow do people\n\nunderstand their\n\nworld?\n\nAnd what is behind\n\nthis is this\n\nrecognition by many of\n\nus that you can expose\n\npeople, two different\n\npeople, to the same\n\nmessage, the same\n\nspeech and campaign ad\n\nand they will come\n\naway with two\n\ndifferent readings on\n\nit, two different\n\ninterpretations.\n\nThey'll see different\n\nthings here.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nHow does that happen?\n\nIt happens because we\n\nall have different\n\nlenses that we see the\n\nworld and filter\n\nthings and process\n\nthem.\n\nI have found just in\n\ndifferent ways I've\n\nbeen pursuing this\n\nquestion.\n\nI found it much more\n\nrewarding than than\n\nquestion which is\n\nbasically how could\n\npeople be so stupid?\n\nHow could people vote\n\nagainst their\n\ninterests?\n\nWhat is wrong with\n\nthem.\n\nI like to ask not what\n\nare people getting\n\nwrong but how are they\n\ngetting it.\n\nI just earned tenure\n\nat the University of\n\nWisconsin.\n\nI told myself you can\n\nunderstand why social\n\nclass identities\n\nmatter.\n\nSo this was Wisconsin,\n\na bying background\n\nhere.\n\nThe blue areas are\n\nmore urban areas.\n\nWhat is I did, I was\n\ninterested in this.\n\nBui areas are more you\n\nare urb\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nWe're on the short end of\n\nthe stick in three main ways,\n\nlots of ways that I I can't\n\ncharacterize them.\n\nOne of this all of the decisions\n\nthat effect our lives are made\n\nin Madison or Milwaukee which\n\nare the two natural areas in the\n\nstate, the only two and\n\ncommunicated out to us.\n\nWe don't -- people don't come\n\nout here and ask us what we\n\nthink.\n\nWe're told what the rules are\n\ngoing to be.\n\nSo we -- we're on the short end\n\nof the stick in teams of power\n\nbasically and political power\n\nand decision-making power.\n\nWe're on the short end of the\n\nstick in terms of resources.\n\nYou know all of our taxpayer\n\ndollars get sucked in and spent\n\non Madison and Milwaukee and we\n\ndon't see that money in return.\n\nWe're also on the short end of\n\nthe stick in terms of respect.\n\nYou all making the decisions\n\ndown there, you don't know us.\n\nYou don't know what life is like\n\nin a place like this.\n\nYou don't like us.\n\nYou don't respect us.\n\nYou think we're racist and\n\nsexist and homophobic and Islam\n\nphobic.\n\nThat came out.\n\nThat's sobering.\n\nI think it is important.\n\nBut as a political scientist it\n\nseemed to me politically really\n\nimportant.\n\nThis is a set of sentiments that\n\na savvy politician might tap\n\ninto, right, in the following\n\nways.\n\nIt has many layers to it.\n\nYou may have heard some already\n\njust the way I'm explaining it,\n\nit is resentment toward city and\n\ncity people and also toward\n\nelites and one political party\n\nmore than another, perhaps\n\nincreasingly so since the time I\n\nwas in the field in early 2007.\n\nAnd it is also racism and\n\nresentment against minorities.\n\nWisconsin you may be familiar\n\nwith this is very segregated\n\nRichellely.\n\nWhen people talk about the\n\ncities, oftentimes it is also a\n\nconversation about race.\n\nTh\n\nThey can activate a component of\n\nthis and so potentially is\n\npowerful.\n\nIt sets the stage for divisive\n\nmessages that clears out to\n\npeople who is us and who is\n\nthem.\n\nPeople are like we're working\n\nhard to make ends meet.\n\nWe're good, hard working\n\nAmericans and it seems to us\n\nthat our hard earned money is\n\ngoing to -- to support people\n\nwho -- who -- who aren't as\n\ndeserving, aren't as hard\n\nworking whether it be you,\n\nKathy, you're a full-time\n\nprofessor down at university of\n\nWisconsin Madison.\n\nWhat are you doing driving\n\naround the state and having\n\ncoffee with us?\n\nHow is that hard work?\n\nSometimes they would say when do\n\nyou take a shower?\n\nI say before I go to work.\n\nExactly they would say, I work\n\nso hard that the first thing I\n\ndo when I get home is take a\n\nshower.\n\nThey would have -- they said\n\nthere hard workers and those\n\nthat sit behind desks.\n\nThey thought a lot of their\n\nmoney was going to pay for\n\npeople like me.\n\nThat's one example because\n\nsometimes the deservingness was\n\nracialized, they would have a\n\nstereotype of a welfare\n\nrecipient, someone that doesn't\n\ndeserve the public benefits.\n\nAnother way this was very ripe\n\nground for -- for a politician\n\nto tap into is that it sets the\n\nstage for someone to say, yeah,\n\nlet's have less government.\n\nPeople would look around at\n\ntheir communities and say\n\nwhatever government is doing, it\n\nis not working for us.\n\nIt is not working people in\n\nplaces like us.\n\nIt is not working for people\n\nlike us.\n\nThere's a sense that -- that --\n\nthat government folks were\n\npeople that didn't respect\n\npeople in the smaller\n\ncommunities.\n\nThere's a sentence that it was\n\nan urban thing.\n\nEven for public employee living\n\nin the community for example,\n\npostschool educators and people\n\nwould sometimes say things like,\n\nlook, yeah, I know, he's lived\n\nthere the last 25 years, but the\n\ntesting, the decisions about\n\ncurriculum, all of that stuff is\n\ndecided by you all down in\n\nMadison, in the by people here\n\nand whether or not that's true,\n\nthat was perception that public\n\nemployees the way they do their\n\njobs were good urban values and\n\nurban decisions.\n\nSo Lo and behold, Scott walker\n\ncomes on the scene.\n\nMind you, he was Milwaukee\n\ncounty executive.\n\nHe ran for governor and won.\n\nShortly after he took office, he\n\nproposed a piece of legislation\n\nknown as act 10 Wisconsin.\n\nIt was a budget addendum.\n\nIt was a budget repair ir bill that\n\nwould undercut public employee\n\nunions to organize and bargain.\n\nAnd also it required public\n\nemployees to pay in more of\n\ntheir pay checks for pensions\n\nand healthcare benefits.\n\nThis picture is a reaction in\n\nMadison, how people were around\n\nthe state capital in Madison.\n\nIt seemed to be the most\n\nunpopular legislation ever\n\nproposed in the state.\n\nBut 20, 25 miles outside of the\n\ncity, the conversation, the\n\nbehavior was very different.\n\nInstead people were saying\n\nthing, not like let's impeach\n\nthe guy, but it is about time.\n\nIt is about time someone came\n\nalong and made those people pay\n\nin more -- more to the pot.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nThat was all very sobering\n\nfor those of us in Wisconsin and\n\nthose of everybody watching from\n\nother parts of the country.\n\nThen the 2016 presidential\n\nelection took place.\n\nRight?\n\nPeople started wondering wow,\n\nwhat is going on in rural\n\nWisconsin?\n\nThose of you watching election\n\ncrosses and you realize will be\n\nthe next president and Wisconsin\n\nis in the middle of the night\n\nthe last state to clinch the\n\nelection for Trump.\n\nIt seemed quickly that whatever\n\nwas happening in Wisconsin had\n\nsome parallels to other parts of\n\nthe country as well.\n\nAnd Donald Trump is a very\n\ndifferent politician than Scott\n\nwalker.\n\nIn his own way, he was saying to\n\npeople, you were right to be so\n\nupset.\n\nYou are doing things as you\n\nshould, you are hard working.\n\nYou're a good American.\n\nWhat you deserve is going to\n\nother people or those people.\n\nAnd for Scott walker, the target\n\nof blame was basically public\n\nemployees.\n\nThat wasn't necessarily Donald\n\nTrump's blame he said he was\n\npointing the finger at\n\nimmigrants and uppity women and\n\nliberal elites and such.\n\nIn ways they were playing into\n\nthe same set of sentiment.\n\nNow I don't want to convey that\n\nit was -- it was rural\n\nWisconsin, rural Wisconsin,\n\nrural Americans who -- who were\n\nthe -- the kind of -- the kind\n\nof -- of -- of pivotal\n\npopulation group in the election\n\nof 2016.\n\nBut they were important to the\n\noutcome of the election.\n\nAnd my goodness, they received a\n\nlot of attention since then.\n\nRight?\n\nOne thing that happened to me,\n\nthis -- and personally, I\n\nthought I was -- was starting a\n\ncorner of the world that I cared\n\na lot about.\n\nElection -- that election\n\nchanged my life pretty much\n\novernight in terms of who was\n\nasking me to share my knowledge\n\nand -- asking me to commenTate\n\non the world around me.\n\nOne of my favorite stories, as\n\nreturns came in in 2016, I\n\nturned to my daughter who is 12\n\nand I said I think we should go\n\nhome.\n\nI think I'm going to be busy\n\ntomorrow.\n\nAnd I'm checking my e-mail\n\nbefore we went to bed and\n\nthere's an e-mail from the \"New\n\nYork Times\" saying, hi, we're\n\nthe \"New York Times\", we think\n\nwe know something, can we talk\n\nto you tomorrow?\n\nThat was the start of a lot of\n\npeople saying what the heck is\n\ngoing on in Wisconsin and what\n\ncan you -- can you help us\n\nunderstand about rural America?\n\nPart of what happened was many\n\npeople around the country and\n\naround the world, but primarily\n\nfrom the United States wrote\n\nmessages to me, primarily by\n\ne-mail saying -- sometimes\n\nasking questions but more often\n\nthan the no expressing things to\n\nme.\n\nThey heard me speak or read\n\nsomething that I wrote and --\n\nand felt compelled to tell me\n\nwhat was on their minds.\n\nI'm turning to those messages\n\nnext to help -- to help -- to\n\nhelp convey the importance of\n\nperspective.\n\nI think what I learned from --\n\nfrom doing this work is that --\n\nis that listening, taking the --\n\nhaving the luxury of taking the\n\ntime to go into people and\n\nsitting down with them and\n\nlistening to the way they talked\n\nabout politics opened my eyes to\n\nall kind of things that I hadn't\n\neven thought I -- I had been\n\nlooking for.\n\nOne thing in particular, you\n\nknow, the -- the way that people\n\nwere turning to me and saying\n\ncan you help me explain taught\n\nme that we really don't know\n\nmuch about the perspectives that\n\npeople are using to think about\n\npolitics in rural America but in\n\nmany different parts of our\n\nsociety.\n\nIt is not just rural Americans\n\nthat are feeling as though\n\nthey're unheard and not unseen\n\nor they're overlooked or\n\ndisrespected.\n\nMany people express those\n\nsentiments.\n\nAs a social scientist or\n\npolitical observer we're often\n\nasking the question, how can\n\npeople do that?\n\nThere's part of you us that\n\nwants to know more.\n\nHow are they understanding the\n\nworld?\n\nIt helps to listen to people to\n\ntalk to people in their own\n\nlives to get a better sense of\n\nthat.\n\nIt also taught me that there's\n\nmore to know about political --\n\npeople's political beliefs and\n\npartisanship, because I would\n\nask people, so tell me which\n\nparty best represents the\n\ninterests of the people around\n\nhere.\n\nAlmost always they would say,\n\nneither party.\n\nNone of them are paying\n\nattention to us.\n\nTheir attachment to the parties\n\nwas much more complicated than\n\nleaning towards republican or\n\nDemocrat but it -- it was\n\nintertwined with the sense of --\n\nof where -- where some of the\n\nparties -- it helped to listen\n\nto them to talk about the parts\n\nto understand that.\n\nI want to know one thing I think\n\nthese conversations did for me\n\nwas to see the complexity of the\n\nway, when people are talking\n\nabout those people and who is\n\nobserving that -- economics and\n\nracism and cultural anxiety and\n\nwhatever you want to call it are\n\nintertwined in the way people\n\nare perceiving candidates and\n\npolicy.\n\nI turn now to the letters to\n\ndive into these letters more.\n\nI want to share with you some of\n\nthe words that I received but I\n\nthink these are all from e-mail\n\nfrom people who were -- were --\n\nwere reading stuff I wrote and\n\nhearing things and responding to\n\nthe people I had been studying.\n\nPrimarily the people we assume\n\nvoted for Trump in the election.\n\nThey say things like, you know,\n\nI don't know what they're paying\n\nattention to.\n\nBut this seems to be from\n\nanother universe.\n\nThey would say things like,\n\ndon't they get that they're\n\ngetting going and support too.\n\nThat they're getting government\n\nbenefits themselves and how is\n\nit that they want to undercut\n\ngovernment and why Scott walker\n\nand why smaller government.\n\nSometimes they would say things\n\nlikes -- they have the\n\nopportunity to move.\n\nThey can move to where the jobs\n\nare.\n\nThe people in the communities\n\nare people that are left behind\n\nand wallowing in their own\n\nresentment.\n\nHarsh, right?\n\nWhat is harsh and troubling to\n\nme is all of that stuff sounds\n\nso much like the comments that I\n\nheard Trump supporters saying\n\nabout who we presume to be\n\nClinton supporters.\n\nI want to share those with you.\n\nSorry to make you even more\n\ndepressed.\n\nFor example, I would hear\n\noftentimes, or Democrats they\n\ncannot decide can for\n\nthemselves.\n\nThey being fooled and\n\nhoodwinked.\n\nOne guy saying, this Democrat\n\nsaid he basically even if Hitler\n\nhe would vote for him just\n\nbecause he's a Democrat.\n\nThey can't make their own\n\nchoices.\n\nHere's another set of things.\n\nThey would say things like, you\n\nknow, not just based on par\n\npartisan, they just vote for\n\nBarack Obama because he's black\n\nor Hillary Clinton because she's\n\na woman.\n\nOr they only vote for Democrats\n\nbecause they're on a government\n\nprogram and want the money to\n\ncontinue.\n\nThey would say they're\n\nhypocritical.\n\nOftentimes this comes up when I\n\ngo back after the 2016 campaign\n\nto some groups and say -- it\n\nwould come up the way before the\n\ngain who did I vote for?\n\nI would say Hillary Clinton.\n\nI would say why?\n\nI would say I saw the videotape\n\nand access video and I have a\n\ndaughter.\n\nWhat about bill Clinton?\n\nThey criticize Trump for things\n\nthey don't criticize their own\n\npeople.\n\nAnother thing that would come up\n\nis just the -- the perception of\n\nDemocrats being intolerant.\n\nSo this person is talking about,\n\nyou try to have a conversation\n\nwith them, they won't listen to\n\nyou.\n\nOkay.\n\nNow I thoroughly depressed you.\n\nWhat is troubling is there's\n\nenergy being spent on what is\n\nwrong with each other, what\n\nneeds to be fixed in those\n\npeople, while we're focusing on\n\nthe flaws of each other as\n\nopposed to focusing on the\n\nthings that are more\n\nfundamentally wrong.\n\nWhy is it that our attention is\n\ndrawn to -- to what is wrong\n\nwith each other.\n\nWhy is that the conversation?\n\nAnd what happens is that we get\n\nso frustrated with one another,\n\nright?\n\nWe think that -- that the\n\nproblem is those people and\n\nclearly they're not paying\n\nattention to the right news on\n\nany information that you give\n\nthem will not change their minds\n\nso it is hopeless.\n\nWe throw up or hands and turn\n\naway and we don't engage and\n\ndon't get involved.\n\nThe result is that the policies\n\nthat are getting us to these\n\nplaces whether we're talking\n\nabout economic policy or\n\notherwise continue.\n\nSo the people in power have the\n\nability to continue passing\n\nlegislation that actually isn't\n\nhelping the people who are\n\ncomplaining about the state of\n\naffairs.\n\nI'm wondering these days, is the\n\nquestion, what is wrong with\n\nthese people or those people?\n\nOr instead, should we be asking\n\nwhat is wrong with our overall\n\nsystem?\n\nWhat is wrong with the democracy\n\nthat we're in the state of\n\naffairs that we're in?\n\nWe can ask, so what is it that\n\nwith need or probably a question\n\nthat is more familiar to a lot\n\nof you, a question I've been\n\nasking myself since the campaign\n\nis what is it that I should be\n\ndoing with my talents at this\n\npoint in time?\n\nGiven our state of affairs, what\n\ndo I do to contribute to a\n\nsolution.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nOne thing I've been working\n\non since early 2017.\n\nThis is a project that I've been\n\nworking on with a colleague of a\n\ndear friend, he's a director of\n\nthe lab called the laboratory\n\nfor social machines.\n\nThey create a nonprofit\n\norganization called cortico\n\nwhich helps them deploy what\n\nthey invent.\n\nI've been in the lab.\n\nIt is a group of designers and\n\ncomputer engineers and analogy\n\nlanguage processing people and\n\nmachine learning folks.\n\nWhat we came up with is\n\nbasically our answer to how do\n\nwe scale up the listening that I\n\ndid in Wisconsin on a national\n\nscale, perhaps international,\n\nWe'll see how it goes.\n\nBut this is where a conversation\n\nwe started along this\n\nrecognition that the way in\n\nwhich we communicate with each\n\nother, whether we're talking\n\nsocial media and traditional\n\nimmediate yeah, typically it is\n\nloud and shallow and divisive\n\nand reactive and it is just not\n\nnuanced and it is often\n\ndisconnected from the things\n\nthat we're -- that we care about\n\nand are in our every day lives.\n\nIf you go to a friend and say,\n\nwhat are your biggest concerns\n\nthese days?\n\nMore often than not it is\n\nthought going to be the stuff\n\nthat is getting talked about in\n\nthe news but instead it is jobs\n\nand paying off your school loans\n\nand healthcare, maybe the\n\nenvironment.\n\nWhat we're aiming for is a kind\n\nof communication in which we\n\nlift up the voices of the people\n\nwho are under heard.\n\nPeople that don't fool listened\n\nto.\n\nPeople that feel they're\n\noverlooked and disrespected or\n\nignored.\n\nCommunication that is more\n\nnuanced as opposed to putting us\n\nin boxes in corners.\n\nInstead it enables to see the\n\ncomplexity of each other's views\n\nand not SisiSisimply say he's one of\n\nthem.\n\nHe's more grounded in our every\n\nday concerns.\n\nSo we came up with a thing that\n\nwe call the local voices\n\nnetwork.\n\nIt is to foster constructive\n\nconversations that help us each\n\nother.\n\nWe're aiming for simply a way in\n\nwhich we can listen to one\n\nanother and understand the per\n\nspktives of people who are\n\nunlike us or don't live near us\n\nor that we haven't had\n\ninteraction with.\n\nWe have grounded our work in\n\nthese five values.\n\nWe keep these front and center\n\nin our design decisions.\n\nThe first one is we're trying to\n\nget people to talk about their\n\nstories and their personal\n\nexperiences as opposed to their\n\nbullet points.\n\nWe want people to come into a\n\nconversation and share their\n\nlives rather than their\n\narguments.\n\nI'm understanding that it is --\n\nit is -- when you have the\n\nopportunity to hear other people\n\nstories that you can actually\n\nunderstand their lives better.\n\nAnother way of putting it is if\n\nyou bring people into a\n\nconversation and say, we're\n\ngoing to have a conversation\n\nabout climate change, people are\n\ngoing to show up with their --\n\ntheir points in mind, their\n\nbullet points, their arguments\n\nin mind.\n\nAs soon as you sit down in that\n\nconversation and people start to\n\ntalk, you will though who is on\n\nwhich side of what.\n\nAnd more likely than not your\n\ndefenses are going to go up.\n\nYou won't hear.\n\nYou won't actually listen to\n\nwhat other people have to say.\n\nWe're trying to foster people\n\ntalking about their stories.\n\nWe're also trying to engage as\n\nmany different types of people\n\nas possible primarily for the\n\npurpose again of lifting up the\n\nvoices of people that are not\n\nnormally heard and also called\n\npublic conversation project.\n\nWe're grounding our work in\n\ntheir particular communities in\n\nwhich we're trying out the local\n\nvoices network so -- so every\n\nplace we are we are working with\n\nthe community asking them what\n\nis it you want to the\n\ncommunication to look like?\n\nHow do you think this should\n\nshould work here and tailoring\n\nto each community as we go?\n\nWe're trying to be as\n\ntransparent as possible, where\n\nthe data is going, because we're\n\nmerging people and technology\n\nhere.\n\nAnd that hasn't gone so well in\n\nmany aspects.\n\nFinally we want it to matter.\n\nWe hope to have measurable\n\nimpact.\n\nThese are the key things we're\n\nfocusing on as we keep these\n\nvalues front and center and\n\ncreate a new public conversation\n\nthat we're -- again, we're\n\ntrying to lift up the voices of\n\npeople who are not normally\n\nheard and we're trying to get\n\npeople to listen and learn.\n\nYou could see affinity for the\n\nwork you're doing here.\n\nAnd again, we're trying to get\n\npeople to share their own\n\nstories, their personal\n\nconcerns.\n\nSo we call the public\n\nconversation network because at\n\nthe core our small group\n\nconversations much like the kind\n\nI was encountering in gas\n\nstations and designer where\n\nwe're aiming for about six\n\npeople to be led in a\n\nconversation by a facilitator,\n\nall of these folks are\n\nvolunteers from the community,\n\nand it is public that -- that\n\nthe conversations are recorded.\n\nEveryone knows they're recorded.\n\nThey know they're going to be\n\nrecorded from the moment they\n\nvolunteer to participate.\n\nAnd the conversations are shared\n\nacross the community and\n\nneighborhoods in the community\n\nand space.\n\nThis is possible through what\n\nthey have invented.\n\nIt is a scalable technology\n\nplatform that is tech lingo, not\n\nso familiar to me, meaning this.\n\nThey invented a thing called a\n\ndigital hearth.\n\nIt is size of a hug.\n\nWhat is inside eight\n\nmicrophones, raspberry pie and\n\ncomputer and enables this thing\n\nto communicate with the\n\ncontroller which I'll show you\n\nas well as a speaker.\n\nDuring the conversation which is\n\nopen-ended and yet structured\n\nwhich I'll say a lot about in a\n\nminute, the facilitator can say,\n\nI talked about affordable\n\nhousing.\n\nImagine there's other people in\n\nthe room with us.\n\nLet's play this from Paco,\n\nWisconsin and people are talking\n\nabout affordable housing and\n\nonce you hear the conversation\n\nwe can reflect together and\n\nthrough this thing we can bring\n\nin voices from other people who\n\nthese folks may not have\n\nencountered before.\n\nHere it what it looks like.\n\nWe put it in a box so it doesn't\n\nfeel like a phone during can a\n\nconversation.\n\nThese are the principles that\n\nguide the script and the guide\n\nthat the host uses to guide the\n\ninformation, but basically the\n\nconversation goes like this.\n\nShare your first name, tell us\n\nthe value that is important to\n\nyou and that is related to why\n\nyou're here today.\n\nTell us a story from your\n\nbackground that helps us\n\nunderstand the person you've\n\nbecome.\n\nTell us what do you love about\n\nliving here?\n\nAnd then what are are you\n\nconcerned about in this\n\ncommunity and then let's listen\n\nto a voice from another place.\n\nAnd then what do you wish would\n\nbe different five years from\n\nnow?\n\nWhat do you wish they knew about\n\nyour life?\n\nFinally what is one thing you're\n\ngoing to be taking away from the\n\nconversation?\n\nSimple questions that so far\n\nhave sparked some thoughtful\n\nconversations and -- and about a\n\nwide variety of -- of issues.\n\nSo we're not telling people what\n\nto talk about.\n\nPart of the idea is people --\n\npeople have the power to -- to\n\nset the agenda, to say what is\n\nimportant in their communities.\n\nSo it is community power to\n\nunderstanding and it is benefit\n\ndriven and it is in particular\n\ngeographies.\n\nWe started in Madison.\n\nThis is a group of people\n\ntraining to be facilitators in\n\nMadison.\n\nYou see the hearth at work here.\n\nWe're working with the library\n\nand they're a huge part of the\n\nlocal voices network.\n\nThese hearts live in the\n\nlibraries meaning that's where\n\nthey get recharged and that's\n\nwhere the data gets uploaded to\n\na cloud.\n\nAlso, they help us do\n\nrecruiting.\n\nBut importantly and by design,\n\nthese things can go anywhere, so\n\nlibrarians taught us early on if\n\nyou want to engage a wide\n\nvariety of people you need to go\n\nthrough them, right, which I\n\nthink I learned as well that if\n\nyou really want to listen to\n\npeople and understand how they\n\nthink about their community, you\n\nneed to go to where they are in\n\nthe course of their every day\n\nlives.\n\nThese things are portable and go\n\nto where people are and they\n\ncome back.\n\nHere's -- here's shots from the\n\nlibrary and they're -- they're\n\ntagging it and circulate with\n\nthe books.\n\nHere's very first hearth\n\ncheckout by a host that owns a\n\npancake restaurant.\n\nWent back to the restaurant and\n\nhad a conversation and to the --\n\nto the much chagrin of the\n\nengineers placed a cup on top of\n\nit.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo all of this data, then what?\n\nPart of the idea is people\n\nencounter the speaker playing\n\nparts of the conversation but\n\nalso there's a great web\n\ninterface that if you're a\n\nparticipate, you can log on and\n\nhear and see your own\n\nconversation but also hear and\n\nsee the conversations of other\n\npeople and -- and you can easily\n\nsearch through and find\n\nconversations about a particular\n\ntopic.\n\nThis is going to give you a\n\nquick overview of what the\n\nwebsite looks like.\n\nThis is the website for Madison.\n\nWhen you open it up, there's a\n\nmap and the bar shows you where\n\nconversations have taken place\n\nand how many.\n\nAlong the side, snippets of\n\ndifferent conversations.\n\nDive into one particular\n\nconversation here is that the\n\nblue spot is -- is where it took\n\nplace.\n\nWhen you open up a given\n\nconversation, there's a --\n\nthere's a -- a bar that shows up\n\nthat shows you who has\n\nparticipated along the left\n\nhere.\n\nAnd then across the top are key\n\nwords that pop up.\n\nIt is showing you what is\n\ngetting talked about where in\n\nthe conversation.\n\nYou could see that's where\n\nshooting was mentioned.\n\nThat's where school district is\n\nmentioned, the suppreme court and\n\nimmigration.\n\nHighlights by volunteers as well\n\nand people are fascinated by the\n\nconversations.\n\nYou click on one part and hear\n\nit.\n\nI don't have the audio linked to\n\nthis right now.\n\nAs it plays it highlights the\n\nwords that are being said so you\n\ncan follow along visually pretty\n\neasily as well as hear the\n\nperson's voice, let's see you\n\nthe full transcript and read\n\nthrough and again at any point\n\nwhat you want to hear the person\n\nsaying you'll click on it and\n\nthey'll play the transcript.\n\nIt is all -- it is all by -- you\n\nknow, it is all an experiment\n\nand -- and we are -- we are\n\nimproving things as we go.\n\nOn that I was shog you we now\n\nexpanded to Boston, New York\n\nCity, Birmingham, Alabama, which\n\nis just starting up, so there\n\naren't conversations up on the\n\nwebsite and as well as as apple\n\nton in Wisconsin.\n\nAnd peck.\n\nPeck is a smaller community.\n\nWhat we're showing you is a\n\ntopic index that went up maybe a\n\nfew weeks ago that is the result\n\nof -- of me highlighting parts\n\nof a conversation saying, these\n\nare conversations about\n\neducation, and then the machine\n\nlearning folks teaching,\n\nteaching the machines to look\n\nfor more conversations about\n\neducation and now you can go\n\ninto the page and say I want to\n\nsee conversations about the\n\nenvironment, show them to me.\n\nThey'll pop up.\n\nIn other words there's much more\n\nto say here.\n\nIt is an awesome tool for being\n\nable to search through the\n\nconversations and -- and now,\n\nwhat we're working on is how do\n\nyou meld the human ability to\n\ninterpret conversational data\n\nalong with a capability of\n\nmachines.\n\nWe have a long way to go.\n\nIt is my hope that we can find a\n\nway to go from post-notes to\n\nusing machines to be able to\n\nunderstand conversations about\n\npolitics on a larger scale than\n\nI was able to go in my\n\nVolkswagen or Prius.\n\nMedia outlets are amplifying\n\nthese conversations.\n\nIt is one thing for a volunteer\n\nto log in and listen.\n\nIt is another for the local\n\nmedia to say hey, look, a lot of\n\npeople seem to talk about\n\npolicing in schools.\n\nWhat are they saying?\n\nAnd let me as a journalist\n\nfollow up with that and have a\n\nmore in-depth interview to\n\nunderstand what is going on this\n\nthat person's life or their son\n\nor daughter's life for example.\n\nThis is one example of -- of --\n\nof an outlet that we're\n\npartnering with in Madison and\n\nthen these are others that we're\n\nworking with around the country.\n\nSo the ultimate hope is that at\n\none point in time there will be\n\none of these crazy digital\n\nhearts in every library.\n\nThere's 17,000 of them around\n\nthe country.\n\nSo we have a ways to go.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nI like you are hoping there's\n\nways -- we need to be creative\n\nabout how we listen, we need to\n\nbe creative, and this I hope is\n\none contribution for your\n\nattention and I really am\n\nlooking forward to your\n\nquestions.\n\nSo thank you to the students.\n\n[Applause]\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nThank you, Dr. Cramer for\n\nyour policy talk.\n\nI'm a first year masters student\n\nhere at the north Michigan.\n\nHow much of the world is\n\nadministered by media versus\n\nmore authentic sources like\n\ngrass roots sources?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nI don't know is the honest\n\nanswer.\n\nProbably a good bit of it.\n\nIt is hard to tell.\n\nI -- I -- for -- for -- for the\n\nwork with my book I worked with\n\nand Dave lawson and we did a\n\ncontent analysis of local\n\nnewspapers across the state\n\ngoing back to the 50s to try to\n\nget some sense of -- of -- of\n\nwas this a kind of sentiment in\n\nthe local news coverage.\n\nIs there a way that we could see\n\nit in local news and we really\n\ncouldn't at all.\n\nThat's not to say it is not part\n\nof the media.\n\nI think -- I think -- sentiments\n\nlike this are -- are a part of\n\n-- of political cultures which\n\ncome from so plane different\n\nthings.\n\nIt is what we say to each other\n\nand as well as what we pick up\n\nfrom -- from news and popular\n\nculture and movies and music and\n\nsuch.\n\nIt is hard to attribute it.\n\nIt is hard to quantify how much\n\ncomes from the media.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nGood question.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nI'm Marie Alexander.\n\nI'm with a club on campus to\n\nincrease dialogue.\n\nWith township governments\n\nthere's talk of consolidating\n\ninto fewer larger units but is\n\nthere a benefit to having\n\nsmaller government units closer\n\nto the people in rural areas?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nGreat question.\n\nThat's a difficult tradeoff.\n\nThere's a benefit for people\n\nhaving government close to them\n\nso they know who to contact if\n\nand when they have a grievance\n\nor an issue that they want\n\nattention on.\n\nYet, so many of our local\n\ngovernments are so strapped for\n\nresources that consolidating up\n\nand just some respects makes\n\nsense economically but if we're\n\njust talking about -- about --\n\nabout -- about -- about the\n\nsentiment of feeling heard,\n\ngetting rid of the local\n\ngovernments does seem a bit\n\ndangerous.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nThe next question is do\n\nsurvey questions that ask if\n\nyou're a republican or Democrat\n\nget it wrong?\n\nIs that just too simple?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nI wouldn't say it is wrong.\n\nJust -- it is a partial answer.\n\nRight?\n\nThat -- that -- that -- I\n\nimagine many of you in the room,\n\nif you were asked a question, if\n\nyou're a republican or 0\n\nDemocrat or independent or what\n\ncould pick one pretty easily?\n\nYet there's more you want to say\n\nabout yourself, right?\n\nYeah, I'm a Democrat but blah\n\nblah blah.\n\nIt is -- it is -- it is just\n\nincomplete answer, it doesn't --\n\nit is not the whole answer.\n\nYet, you know, that question\n\ncontinues to be very powerful\n\nfor predicting how people are\n\ngoing to vote or how they will\n\nstand on certain issues.\n\nIt is a very efficient a\n\nquestion for many decades now.\n\nThere's also -- there's more to\n\nlearn about people's leanings\n\ntowards the parties.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nIf rural American radio and\n\ncable are owned by chosely\n\nmonitored groups how can we\n\nchange this information?\n\nThat's a great question.\n\nWe clearly need ways of\n\ncommunicating and -- and\n\nlearning about -- about the\n\nworld around us in which the --\n\nthe incentive that -- and the\n\ndivisiveness is not profitable.\n\nI don't think we yet discovered\n\nwhat those ways of communicating\n\nare.\n\nFor time we thought social media\n\nwas going to enable that and\n\nthat hasn't really been a great\n\nanswer.\n\nThat's another.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI wish I knew the answer.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nYou talk about getting\n\npeople to share their stories\n\nand communities, how do you plan\n\nto extend these discussings\n\nacross communities?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nYes.\n\nSo one way is just do this what\n\nwe call cross-pollination of\n\nhaving for example say, a group\n\nof people in the Bronx.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nWhy use resentment\n\nin the title?\n\nIt is a strong word.\n\nWhy not the politics,\n\nquote, one down, end\n\nquote?\n\nI don't get the new\n\ntitle.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\n[Indiscernible].\n\nWell, good question.\n\nIt is a question that\n\ngot a lot of -- after\n\nthe 2016 election and\n\nso after 2016 election\n\nI felt compelled to go\n\nback to many of these\n\ngroups.\n\nI wanted to know, I\n\ntoo wanted to know\n\nwhat they were saying\n\nright.\n\nPart of the reason I\n\nwas going back even\n\nbefore the election\n\nhappened was I wanted\n\nto give all of them a\n\ncopy or so of the\n\nbook.\n\nAnd so I started to\n\nsay, don't hurt my\n\nfeelings, don't feel\n\nlike you're going to\n\nhurt my feelings?\n\nHow do you feel about\n\nthe title of the book?\n\nTell me, really.\n\nYou have to take it\n\nwith a grain of Sault,\n\nthey tell me they\n\ndon't like the title.\n\nOften what would\n\nhappen is people would\n\n-- would -- they\n\nwouldn't say anything\n\nand they would sit\n\nthis and pause and\n\nthey would say what do\n\nyou mean?\n\nWell, do you -- do you\n\n-- you know, how does\n\nit sit with you?\n\nHow do you feel about\n\nthe title?\n\nThey would say, you\n\nknow, we resent that.\n\nI'm like, yeah.\n\nWe resent this.\n\nI don't have a problem\n\nwith the title.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nThe way to the\n\npresidency is through\n\nrural Wisconsin\n\nvoters, what are the\n\nrural people from\n\nWisconsin saying about\n\nthe democratic\n\ncandidates?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nI don't know.\n\nTo answer.\n\nI've been creating the\n\nlocal voices network\n\nand a different\n\nproject that -- that\n\n-- so I haven't been\n\nback to the\n\ncommunities, not\n\nreally since the\n\ncandidates were up and\n\nrunning and -- and --\n\nand people have known\n\nabout them.\n\nSo I don't know.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nHow far back do\n\nyou think the politics\n\nof resentment go?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nA long time.\n\nSo you know, could go\n\nto ancient Greece.\n\nLike, you could say on\n\none-hand, there's --\n\nhumans created\n\nanything like a city.\n\nThere's been this --\n\nthis rural urban thing\n\ngoing on, but -- but\n\nto not so be flippant\n\nabout it.\n\nI would say since -- I\n\nwould say since the\n\nlate 60s early 70s, or\n\nthe mix of social\n\nmovements and -- and\n\nchanges in our economy\n\nthat -- that mix of\n\nthings that is both --\n\nboth -- resulted in a\n\ndownturn this the\n\neconomy and also this\n\n-- this sort of\n\ncultural backlash\n\nagainst many of the\n\ncivil rights movements\n\naction that mix of\n\nthings have been fuel\n\nfor the kind of\n\nsentiments that I\n\nheard in the rural\n\ncommunities.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nHow have you\n\naccounted for the\n\nidentity as a white\n\nwoman in having\n\nconversations with\n\nrural Americans?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nGreat question.\n\nI mean -- this this\n\nkind of work, you\n\nalways have to be\n\nmindful -- let me put\n\nit this way, in this\n\nline of work, you\n\nshouldn't fool\n\nyourself that your\n\npresence, you can do\n\nsomething to make your\n\npresence not matter.\n\nRight?\n\nI'm not just -- I'm\n\nnot just a thermometer\n\ngoing into a community\n\nand taking the\n\ntemperature.\n\nI'm a human being\n\nentering into\n\nrelationships with\n\npeople.\n\nAs with any\n\nrelationship, like who\n\nyou are or appear to\n\nbe in the world\n\ninfluences how that\n\nperson is going to\n\nrespond to you.\n\nSo I guess the answer\n\nis I think about it a\n\nlot.\n\nI ask myself would\n\nthis have been a\n\ndifferent conversation\n\nhad I been a different\n\nperson?\n\nI try to be attentive\n\nto that.\n\nI won't know for sure\n\nwhat it would sound\n\nlike or looked like\n\nhad I been a different\n\nperson.\n\nThere -- there --\n\nthere are certain\n\npeople in the world,\n\nwe're constantly\n\nmaking those\n\nassessments.\n\nMy position in the\n\nsociety as a such and\n\nsuch, how is that\n\nimpacting the -- the\n\ninteraction I just\n\nhad?\n\nOr the opportunity I\n\njust had.\n\nThe discrimination I\n\nfelt.\n\nI try to think about\n\nit at lot and report\n\nabout it when I report\n\nthe research when I\n\nbelieve it is relevant\n\nto what people said.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nAs populations are\n\nmore transient young\n\nfolks moving more and\n\nhaving less stable\n\njobs, how will place\n\nidentity shift?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nGreat question.\n\nI don't know for sure.\n\nBut there's been some\n\nreally interesting\n\nresearch around\n\nlanguage and dialects\n\nthat suggests to me\n\nthat itemity is going\n\nto be more important\n\nat least in the near\n\nterm.\n\nResearch I'm referring\n\nto is based on German\n\ndialects and those who\n\nare specialists in\n\nlinguistics may hear\n\nin your own voice.\n\nIt was spurred by the\n\ncommun\n\ncommunication.\n\nFeeling like you're of\n\na community and\n\nthere's a human --\n\nthere's a human drive\n\nfor that.\n\nSo I don't -- I don't\n\nknow.\n\nI think place identity\n\nwill be important, at\n\nleast in the\n\nshort-term.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nAfter doing\n\nresearch for years,\n\nwere you surprised as\n\nmany of us about the\n\noutcome of the 2016\n\nelection?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nI -- I -- I got my\n\nPh.D. at Michigan.\n\nI believe in research\n\nand that they can --\n\ngive us -- give us at\n\nleast a snapshot of a\n\nmoment in time.\n\nSo yeah.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nPeople want to be\n\nheard, but do you\n\nthink they want to\n\nlisten?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nGreat question.\n\nYeah.\n\nYes and no, right?\n\nLike, no I think\n\nhonestly the quick\n\nanswer, this moment in\n\ntime no people don't\n\nwant to listen.\n\nHow many of you just\n\nin the room.\n\nDon't put up your\n\nhand, you'll make me\n\nfeel bad.\n\nAs you're talking,\n\nyou're thinking, this\n\nlistening thing, I'm\n\nso done with people\n\ntelling me to listen.\n\nLike the last thing I\n\nwant to do is listen.\n\ncorner.\n\nThat's the last thing\n\nwe need.\n\nWe do not have time,\n\nwe need to defeat\n\nthem.\n\nI'm in the about\n\nlistening.\n\nI'm about organizing\n\nand figuring out how\n\nto bring them down.\n\nThat's more common\n\nsentiment, which is\n\nwhy I feel a need to\n\nbe a listening\n\nevangelist.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nAre\n\n[Indiscernible] the\n\nbiggest divide -- are\n\nthe elite the biggest\n\ndivide in America?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nNo.\n\nIf we to choose one, I\n\nwould say that -- and\n\nit is not -- it is not\n\na clean cut divide, I\n\nwould say that the\n\nracial divide, divides\n\nin our country are --\n\nis probably this --\n\nthe most profound but\n\nit is hard to know how\n\nto separate that from\n\ngeography from\n\neconomics.\n\nIf I had to pick one I\n\nwould say race.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nThe tax dollars\n\nfrom urban areas or\n\nrural areas, the\n\n[Indiscernible]\n\ndisproportionate\n\ninfluence.\n\nThe story from rural\n\nfolks is just not the\n\ntruth.\n\nThose [Indiscernible]\n\nwe don't know where\n\nthis is coming from,\n\nso what is the driver\n\nfor their false\n\nnarratives?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nJust give me a\n\nmoment.\n\nOkay.\n\nI hear what you're\n\nsaying and yes, you're\n\nright, but I want to\n\nshow you pieces of\n\ndata that will\n\nhopefully complicate\n\nyour view.\n\nSo this is an outdated\n\ndraft, this is\n\nrecovery from the\n\nrecession.\n\nIf you're a rural\n\nperson you may not see\n\nthis chart but you may\n\nlook around you and\n\nsay there's no jobs\n\naround here.\n\nThey're telling me the\n\nrecession is over.\n\nThere's been a\n\nrecovery.\n\nWhere?\n\nThis is broadband\n\nacross the country.\n\nThe orange spots is\n\nwhere it is like, used\n\nto in Ann Arbor where\n\nyou could do business\n\nand online learning\n\nand do anything\n\nbasically.\n\nThe blue parts are\n\nwhere, it is kind of\n\nhard.\n\nVery hard.\n\nThis -- we have graphs\n\nfrom my book and I'm\n\ngoing to zoom through\n\na quick -- quickly\n\nhere's.\n\nstate of Wisconsin.\n\nWhat I'm plotting here\n\nis the taxpayer money\n\nthat goes to each\n\ncounty and what you\n\ncan see here is -- it\n\nis -- it is not the\n\ncase that rural\n\ncounties are\n\ndisadvantaged so the\n\nfurther you are on the\n\nside of the dot, the\n\nmore rural you are.\n\nIt is also not the\n\ncase that -- that\n\nrural counties are --\n\nare disadvantaged in\n\nterms of federal aid.\n\nIf anything they're\n\ngetting more and\n\nthat's the question.\n\nThis is the stuff that\n\nthat they're referring\n\nto.\n\nWhen you look on per\n\ncapita basis, rural\n\ncounties in Wisconsin\n\nin particular, and\n\nthought -- not anymore\n\nthan other states, but\n\nwe're talking about\n\nthe people I was\n\nlistening to, they're\n\nnot right, right?\n\nThere's more money\n\ngoing to rural folks.\n\nI'm going by here a\n\nlittle bit.\n\nIf you look at median\n\nhousehold income in a\n\nrural county, it is\n\nlower.\n\nIf you look at who --\n\nwho -- the percentage\n\nof people living below\n\nthe Bopoverty line it is\n\nhigher and if you look\n\nat unemployment it is\n\nhigher in the rural\n\ncounties.\n\nThey say they don't\n\nknow what they're\n\ntalking about, they'll\n\nbe fooled.\n\nBut you can also say,\n\nthey don't see those\n\ncharts.\n\nThey don't know the\n\nper capita amount of\n\n-- of -- of -- of\n\ntaxpayer dollars that\n\nare coming back to\n\nthem.\n\nWhat they see is like\n\nthe conditions around\n\nthem and they hear who\n\n-- who is not -- not\n\nable to -- to -- you\n\nknow get dental care\n\nor who just lost a\n\njob.\n\nSo is the perception\n\nthat they're worse off\n\nthan the urban areas\n\nincorrect?\n\nI don't think it is an\n\neasy answer.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nHow do you think\n\nthe people that you\n\nmet to do research in\n\nWisconsin feel about\n\nthe title of your\n\nbook?\n\nDo you think they see\n\nthemselves as\n\nresentful?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nYes.\n\nWith the Dom innings\n\nof the two-party\n\nsystem and issues of\n\nidentifying we they\n\nare party what is the\n\nsolution.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nBoy.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nI came up with\n\nthis question.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nIf I had the\n\nsolution.\n\nI don't know.\n\nIf I had the solution,\n\nwould it matter?\n\nWhat a hopeless thing\n\nto say.\n\nIt is one thing to\n\nhave the solution, it\n\nis another to have the\n\npolitical power to\n\nchange thing.\n\nRight?\n\nSo we know\n\ngerrymandering may be\n\npart of the issue and\n\nyou know, you're in a\n\ndifferent context here\n\nthan many other states\n\nin the country, where\n\nyour voters had a\n\nchance to say\n\nsomething different.\n\nIt is not possible to\n\nimplement the solution\n\neven.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know it may help.\n\nSo.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nWe got a couple of\n\nquestions about Henry\n\nWallace and\n\nagricultural extension\n\nin the 1930s.\n\nHow do you think that\n\nfactors in what we're\n\nseeing today.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nExtension, I think\n\nextension is immensely\n\nvaluable.\n\nBecause when you think\n\nabout the universities\n\nin particular and --\n\nand -- and in my book\n\nI write quite a bit\n\nabout a University of\n\nWisconsin man\n\nsoutsending\n\nt\n\nthe sentiment, you\n\ndidn't listen, our\n\nkids can't get in,\n\nwhen they do you don't\n\nunderstand them.\n\nA way to remedy that\n\nis to have people of\n\nthe university in the\n\ncommunities living\n\nwith them, interacting\n\nwith them, knowing\n\nthose folks and then\n\ngetting you know\n\ncreating relationships\n\nwhich is an extension.\n\nAnd when I started my\n\nstudy I learned\n\nthankfully that --\n\nthat our extension\n\neducators around the\n\nstate are -- are\n\npeople with -- with --\n\nwith -- with very deep\n\nknowledge of the\n\ncommunities that they\n\nserve.\n\nIt was often extension\n\noffice I was calling\n\nto say, where in such\n\nand such Wisconsin do\n\npeople go on a daily\n\nbasis to visit with\n\none another to shoot\n\nthe breeze?\n\nThat community rooted\n\ndaily life information\n\nthat the extension\n\nfolks know.\n\nIt is an extremely\n\nvaluable part of a\n\nuniversity, not just\n\nin terms of P.R. and\n\nnot so it looks like\n\nwe're involved in the\n\ncommunities at our\n\nstate -- our\n\nuniversities serve.\n\nBut so we can actually\n\nlearn and hear what it\n\ngoing on out there in\n\nthe world in these\n\nplaces.\n\nWe can discover what\n\ntheir concerns are are\n\nand hopefully, not\n\nonly improve our\n\nresearch but improve\n\nour ability to really\n\nto the students who\n\ncome and learn from\n\nus.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nWas there a\n\nlearning curve with\n\nyour survey\n\ntechnology?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nIt is -- since\n\nthey're saying\n\ntechnology, I wonder\n\nif they're refusing to\n\nthe -- to the digital\n\nhearth.\n\nThere's -- yeah, it is\n\na constant learning\n\ncurve and thankfully\n\nit is -- it is -- so\n\nI'm learning that this\n\nteam of engineers and\n\nby their nature they\n\nare -- they -- they're\n\nused to and trained in\n\ncreating things, like\n\nputting together as\n\nmuch knowledge as\n\npossible to create\n\nsomething and deploy\n\nit and then carefully\n\nattending to the\n\nfeedback and then\n\nreviving it.\n\nIt has been an awesome\n\nexperience.\n\nIt is a different kind\n\nof learning from\n\nanywhere.\n\nIt usually, in my\n\nprevious work, I work\n\non something and\n\npolish it as much as\n\npossible and then put\n\nit out there in the\n\nworld.\n\nPut it out there as\n\nsoon as you can and we\n\ncan learn and improve\n\nit.\n\nIt is a constant\n\nlearning curve.\n\nI don't know if it is\n\nsteep, it feels steep.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nWhat is the\n\ndemographic of voices\n\nyou're getting?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nIt will depend on\n\nthe community.\n\nIn Madison the typical\n\nparticipant is as you\n\nmight expect.\n\nWhite, middle class,\n\nrelatively educated\n\nperson.\n\nThere's a wide\n\nvariety.\n\nThere's about -- about\n\n-- about percent of\n\nour facilitators are\n\npeople of color.\n\nMost people are -- are\n\n-- mostly facilitators\n\nare upper income.\n\nThe participants it is\n\na little hard to say\n\nbecause we have not\n\nyet started collecting\n\ndemographic\n\ninformation on people.\n\nBy choice, we the\n\nphilosophy behind the\n\nlocal network voices\n\nwe want people to see\n\nthe nuance in each\n\nother.\n\nWe have not.\n\nWe've been reluctant\n\nto ask people, we want\n\nyou to see and hear\n\nnuance in each other.\n\nCould you put yourself\n\nin -- in some boxes\n\nfor us so that we can\n\n-- we can better you\n\nknow, make sense of\n\nthe data?\n\nSo we're trying to\n\nfigure out a way to\n\ngive people a lot of\n\nleeway in describing\n\nwho they are to us.\n\nYet capturing\n\ninformation on who the\n\nparticipants are.\n\nSo -- so we think that\n\nwe're -- we're\n\ncapturing -- engaging\n\na live range of people\n\nbut I don't have the\n\nnumbers to share with\n\nwhat I mean on that.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nThe technology and\n\nthe potentials are\n\nneat.\n\nCould it be alienating\n\nand limits in terms of\n\nthe way people use it?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt is weird.\n\nSo many people wary of\n\ntechnology and\n\nespecially when we say\n\nthis -- this -- these\n\nthings are recording\n\nwhat you're saying,\n\nright?\n\nMany people who are\n\nwary of participating\n\nin that.\n\nSo we -- we are.\n\nThat's the driver of\n\ntrying to be as\n\ntransparent as\n\npossible.\n\nTrying to make it\n\nclear to people where\n\nthe data going and how\n\nwe're protecting it,\n\nwhat the purpose is.\n\nAnd we -- we recognize\n\n-- I mean it is like\n\ngood community\n\norganizing I guess in\n\nthat it is -- it is --\n\nit is understand that\n\nit is about\n\nrelationship building\n\nand about people\n\ngetting to know what\n\nthe local voices\n\nnetwork is and having\n\nexperience in it and\n\ndeveloping trust over\n\ntime as they see what\n\nwe do with it and what\n\nthe local journalists\n\ndo with it.\n\nHopefully what -- what\n\nlocal policy makers,\n\nwhat -- the good use\n\nthat they can -- this\n\ncan put it to.\n\nSo I hear -- I hear\n\nyou.\n\nAnother thing, though,\n\nI'm surprised with\n\njust how much people\n\ndo want their voices\n\nheard and recorded.\n\nSo on the other hand,\n\nthere are many people\n\nwho say, if my voice\n\nis going to be heard,\n\nyes, you need\n\ntechnology to amplify\n\nit.\n\nI'm happy to\n\nparticipate to get my\n\nvoice out there.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nWas it easy to be\n\naccepted into starting\n\nideological circles?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nLike.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt was easy.\n\nFor people to be asked\n\ndo you mind if I sit\n\ndo not and listen to\n\nwhat your concerns\n\nare?\n\nOnce people know I'm\n\ngenuine about that\n\nthat that really is\n\nwhy I'm there, and not\n\ntrying to -- to fool\n\nthem in any way like\n\n-- like I was telling\n\nthe students earlier\n\ntoday, I'm not trying\n\nto sell you anything.\n\nNot running for\n\noffice.\n\nNot trying to tell why\n\nyou're wrong.\n\nAs soon as they\n\nunderstand that I\n\nactually -- my purpose\n\nin being there is to\n\nlisten people were\n\nvery welcoming.\n\nIt didn't -- I guess\n\nit is a longer answer.\n\nIt didn't feel as\n\nthough I had somehow\n\nmagically passed over\n\nsome threshold and got\n\nmyself invited into an\n\nexclusive club.\n\nNever felt like that.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nHow have your\n\nbeliefs changed since\n\nstarting talking to\n\nother people?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nI think my -- very\n\nrarely I think does\n\nlistening change our\n\nbeliefs and I would\n\nsay that is not why I\n\nthink listening is\n\nimportant.\n\nInstead what it does\n\nis it helps you see\n\nthe humanity in the\n\nother people and helps\n\nyou probably better\n\nunderstand yourself.\n\nMy beliefs have\n\nchanged I think I have\n\na stronger ception of\n\nwhat I value in this\n\nworld and the kind of\n\nhuman interactions\n\nthat I think are\n\nimportant and that I\n\nstrive to -- to\n\nreplicate or have\n\naround me.\n\nBut I don't think my\n\nposition -- I don't\n\nthink my think on any\n\npolicy issue has\n\nreally changed or my\n\nown -- my own\n\npolitical leanings.\n\nI don't think that's\n\nwhat good listening\n\nusually results in.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nIf you say you\n\npicked up racism in\n\nthe conversations can\n\nyou elaborate?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nSure.\n\nSo most common way is\n\nwhen people are\n\ntalking about\n\neducation and policy\n\nand they would be\n\nreflecting on where\n\nthe school funding\n\nformula sends money in\n\nthe state.\n\nPeople would talk\n\nabout Milwaukee and\n\ntalk about how -- how\n\n-- we sent that city\n\nso much money and look\n\nat the schools and\n\nplaces.\n\nThere would be\n\nassessments.\n\nCultural policy\n\nassessments.\n\nMore money is in the\n\ngoing to solve the\n\nproblem because the\n\nproblem is the way.\n\nI'm not going to\n\nrepeat it.\n\nI rather not elaborate\n\non the staereo types I\n\nheard.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nCan you elaborate\n\non the people can get\n\ninvolved?\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nSure.\n\nGreat.\n\nAll you have to do is\n\ngo to lbm.org.\n\nExpress interest and\n\nsay local voices\n\nnetwork, sounds pretty\n\ninteresting, could we\n\npossibly start up a\n\nchapter here?\n\nYou could also but\n\nthat would probably\n\ntake some time and\n\nexpanding -- there's\n\nno -- there's no real\n\nformula for what it\n\nmeans to open a new\n\nchapter.\n\nIt may be some time\n\nbefore a chapter would\n\nstart up in Ann Arbor\n\nand you're Ann Arbor\n\nbut you may volunteer\n\nto be a curator who is\n\na person that goes out\n\nand lifts highlights\n\nand writes notes I\n\nthink other people\n\nshould hear this and\n\nwhy.\n\nYou could e-mail me.\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nVery good, thank\n\nyou if you want to\n\njoin me in thanking\n\nDr. Cramer for her\n\ntime.\n\n[Applause].\n\nI'm Tom Ivacko with the Urban Policy.\n\nIf you like me\n\nwant to talk to her\n\nmore, we are lucky\n\nthat she'll be in\n\ncampus for a couple of\n\ndays and back in the\n\nbuilding for breakfast\n\non Friday.\n\nThis is when the rural\n\nAmerica working group\n\nthat close-up is part\n\nof.\n\nIt is an\n\ninterdisciplinary\n\ngroup for -- for\n\nfaculty and staff and\n\nstudents across campus\n\nwho have interest in\n\n-- in research\n\ninterest in rural\n\nAmerica and\n\nopportunity to get\n\ntogether and she'll\n\njoin us then.\n\nIt is a small\n\nbreakfast and we can\n\nadd you to the list.\n\nThank you again, right\n\nnow we're ready --\n\nthere's a reception\n\nthat we hope you'll\n\njoin us for right\n\nafter.\n\nThank you."
