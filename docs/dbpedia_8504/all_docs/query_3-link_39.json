And, of course, the role that Tinderbox may play as a UI to AI/GPT.\n\nA Discussion Kathryn Cramer\n\nKathryn shares with us. Starting with the end, Kathryn in looking to see how all this will influence our efforts on learning and making knowledge, i.e., “What comes after the book?” Perhaps “a memory palace solar that can’t see the edges.” We discussed:\n\nGPT, “generative pre-trained transformer”\n\nThe root of GPT and the nature of a token, i.e., a single letter, a word, a concept, or a person’s name and how these “token” are influencing what is thought to be “known” today.\n\nEach word is a probability\n\nTemperature is the relative probability of the next word, 0 temperature is deterministic, while as some temperature allows for probability\n\nPersonality is really represented in bias\n\nThe probabilities are making weights between nodes, probabilistic trees\n\nTokens can end up having multiple meanings\n\nHolon, the most basic unit is a token “I” and “T” are token and “It” code be a token.\n\nIn Tinderbox, a “node” is a note; in AI it is a “token.”\n\nQuotes/Paraphrases\n\nKathryn “We are undergoing a transition where our “private” personalities can be commodified without our knowledge, understanding, permission, or compensation. We all could become Henrietta Lax.”\n\nKathryn “The ghost of Donald Trump is influencing open AI given the number of nodes are related to him and the tokenizing of tokens. “\n\nKathryn “We are not all equal in the eyes of AI; we need to understand personality.”\n\nKathryn “Commercial fiction will go the way of poetry in 10 years, as AI will crack the commercial code for the ‘midlist,’ what will actually sell.”\n\nKathryn “GPT4 can help you think better (like a calculator or slide rule).”\n\nKathryn “We are becoming intelligent in different ways.”\n\nKathryn “Internet roadkill: you have to check if citations exist.”\n\nKathryn “What is GPT good for? It is a process tool, not an end-product tool. It is a labor-saving device. It is good to tell you what conventional wisdom is? You can see what is obvious.”\n\nMark Bernstein “GPTs are great at getting things done but we don’t really understand what they’re doing.\n\nArt Currim “With great power comes great stupidity.”\n\nDetlef Beyer “Tinderbox is a great interface to AI… good way to find your way how to use AI”\n\nConcepts to follow up on\n\nNarrative Coherence\n\nCategory Theory\n\nGPT authors creating are manipulating the system, how does the “average” person survive\n\nIs everything going to be suffused with AI, how can we retain human purity?\n\nIn GPT4 use “tabulate” to tabulate column of keywords/answers\n\nResources\n\nSudowrite, a GTP3 for generating fiction\n\nThe Cuckoo’s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage\n\nWolfram Mathematica\n\nList of eponyms, An eponym is a person (real or fictitious) from whom something is said to take its name. The word is back-formed from “eponymous”, from the Greek “eponymos” meaning “giving name”.\n\nHolon, concept of token, is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole.\n\nCommon Crawl\n\nMachine Hallucination\n\nToken Mapping – this is the process of assigning the created token value to its original value. To enable permitted look-ups of the original value using the token as the index, a secure cross-reference database must be constructed.\n\n‘Too many notes, dear Mozart, too many notes’ is what Emperor Joseph II supposedly said after the first performance of the Entfuhrung aus dem Serail in Vienna’s old Burgtheater. Mozart’s reply was: ‘Just as many as necessary, Your Majesty.\n\nCLIP: The Most Influential AI Model From OpenAI — And How To Use It* 701 Translator\n\nGeorgetown–IBM experiment\n\nALPAC (Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee) *And the all important George Miller “Ambiguous Words”\n\nImmortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\n\nKathryn’s Thesis: A Thousand Future: A Search for Scenario Space\n\nWhat Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work?\n\nMacGuffin\n\nKathryn’s page at The Encyclopedia Of Science Fiction\n\nProject Athena, weave computing resources into the educational process, challenges of collaboration in an academic institution\n\nPlease comment\n\nPlease help with the development of future sessions by answering the three questions below.\n\nWhat were your top 2~3 key takeaways from this lesson?\n\nWhat do you want to learn next? Learn more about?\n\nWhat exercises would help reinforce your learning?\n\nPersonally, I think this is where Apple is going. The entire macOs/iOS/iPadOS/visionOS + iCloud is a substantial safe, secure, and open personal information management system (PIMS). We are slowing layering in the new tools to have control of our own data, our own identity. Per my last question(s) during the session on sovereignty and agency we need to do so much more to empower the individual."
