        "text": "The legendary Billerbeck Bakery was not the only business in Freeport that bore the Billerbeck stamp. There are people around who recall the downtown Freeport Hardware Co. which carried two generations of Billerbecks to wealth and prestige.\n\nKathryn Cramer has fond memories of Jay and Myrtle Billerbeck and the hardware store Jay ran following his father, Anton Billerbeck’s demise. Myrtle was office manager at the store.\n\nKathryn worked in the store as well as in Jay and Myrtle’s home at 1545 W. Stephenson St. Kathryn said the enormous brick house sits up higher than the street. It is distinguished, she said, by the brick pillars which flank the entry of the driveway.\n\nKathryn, daughter of William and Edna (Wachlin) Borchardt, said she and her mother worked together cleaning the Billerbeck home weekly for quite a few years. It was a huge house with many rooms. She recalls there being a large cedar closet, finished basement with a game room complete with flashing lights, and a section where exotic foods, like caviar, were stored under lock and key. The couple owned 24 or 25 other properties, Kathryn said.\n\n“Everything in the house reeked like cigar and cigarette smoke, curtains and all,” Kathryn said. “Both of them smoked.”\n\nKathryn was very fond of both the Billerbecks. Some people thought Jay was hard to get along with, she said, but she didn’t.\n\n“I got along with him fine,” Kathryn said.\n\nKathryn remembers at the store wearing half-aprons with pockets holding a variety of tools and wire. She alternated weeks between working at the store and at the home with her mother.\n\nKathryn’s mother would invite the elderly couple out to their home “for a day in the country, which Jay so looked forward to,” she said. “He would get up at 5:30 in the morning to be ready to go.”\n\nOn one of those visits, Jay noticed the sidewalks needed repair, so he took care of that for them.\n\n“He was especially nice to us,” Kathryn said.\n\nShe said his hands were crippled with arthritis which made it difficult for him to feed himself. She remembered how very grateful to her he was when she gave him a cup with a handle in which his deformed fingers would fit.\n\nMyrtle Billerbeck was blind, so they made quite a air. In their day they put on lavish entertainment for the social elite of Freeport. But after Jay died, Kathryn said, Myrtle became a recluse and would see no one, and wanted no one to see her. Their friends fell away and they eventually “down-sized” their living quarters, moving from their big house to an apartment above the building at the northwest corner of the intersection of Main Street and Galena Avenue. That building had been the site of Billerbeck Bakery, patronized by customers throughout northwestern Illinois.\n\nCherished Memories\n\nWhen Kathryn Borchardt married Harry Cramer, she had big plans for her wedding. She wanted a white gown, a veil and tiara. She was happy to have realized those dreams. She said Jay and Myrtle Billerbeck were very supportive in her plans for the beautiful ceremony. Myrtle bought her a pair of white net gloves and lent her the use of her silver service and white linen tablecloth. Kathryn was very nervous about using the valuable items, she said. She still has the white gloves sentimentally stored away with other wedding memorabilia.\n\nKathryn made her own wedding gown which she said was of princess style made of white satin brocade with a rose design. She still has it, as well as the dress her mother wore for her and William’s 25th wedding anniversary.\n\nKathryn said Mr. Billerbeck also wished to contribute something to make her wedding special so he came up with a plan. Kathryn’s mother wished to play her electric organ for the ceremony at Immanuel Lutheran Church in Lena, but getting the organ there seemed to be impossible, until Jay Billerbeck offered to transport it to the church and back in one of his trucks. Thus, Kathryn’s mother was able to furnish the music for her daughter’s wedding. These kindnesses from the Billerbecks remain etched in her memories to complement all those souvenirs she has tucked away.\n\nBillerbeck Businesses\n\nThe illustrious Billerbeck clan got its start in Freeport with the bakery. Kathryn recalls her father remarking that no trip to Freeport as a child with his parents would have been complete without a stop at the Billerbeck Bakery for coffee and a roll.\n\nFreeport’s most famous bakery was begun about 1860 by John Billerbeck as a sideline to his small grocery store, states the “History of Stephenson County 1970.” There was also, apparently, a small restaurant associated with the bakery.\n\nJohn Billerbeck had served an apprenticeship in Germany as a cracker baker and immigrated to Galena by way of New Orleans. Soon, though, he came to Freeport and started a grocery business and small bakery. After his death, his widow, son Charles, and daughter, Josephine, continued to build up the business until they had one of the largest wholesale businesses in the region. It is believed the Billerbeck Bakery instituted the production of pretzels, which became the trademark for the city and the athletic teams of Freeport High School. The bakery delivered its bread and other products throughout this northwest region. Kathryn remembered the basement of the bakery building had long tunnels underground where the baking had taken place.\n\nThe Freeport Hardware Co. was located at 103 to 109 W. Main St., according to Freeport City directories. An excerpt from the 1970 history dates its beginning in 1872 by Arndt and Leemhuis. In the 1880s, A Dr. Schulte replaced Arndt and in the 1890s, a man named Siecke replaced Leemhuis. Anton Billerbeck who had been a rival dealer joined the firm as manager about 1900 and soon bought out Dr. Schulte. Under his management and later that of his son, John A. “Jay” Billerbeck, the store expanded and prospered until 1968 when Jay Billerbeck retired due to ill health.\n\nWhen the business closed, “liquidating the huge stock at the store drew customers from great distances,” the history states.\n\nWriter’s Note: Today Kathryn keeps busy filling her many bird feeders daily year-round, no matter the weather. She loves to keep fancy chickens and has a dog. Kathryn loves to watch her soaps and feels fortunate that her friends take her out to eat and to movies as well as to get groceries and pay bills. She saw one film recently which she described as a “three tissue” experience.\n\nKathryn at age 85 still drives. She has her DVDs and her CDs and is nobody’s dummy. Kathryn Cramer is sharp as a tack and a delight to talk with. Her memories – like those about the Billerbecks – add fascinating color to the lives of our historic ancestry."
