        "text": "Guests of Honor\n\nVernor Vinge John Jude Palencar Cory Doctorow John G. Cramer Tor Books\n\nWriter Guest of Honor\n\nVernor Vinge\n\nScience fiction author Vernor Vinge has won Hugo awards for his novels A Fire Upon the Deep (1992), A Deepness in the Sky (1996) and Rainbows End (2006). A published story writer since the 1960s, Vinge is known in the sci-fi world as the author most closely associated with the theme of \"technological singularity.\" It's the idea that an event or sequence of events (the \"singularity\") will occur when technology surpasses human intelligence and society ceases to be recognizable to today's humans. Vinge began using the terminology in the 1980s, and in the 1990s went so far as to say he expected such an event to occur between 2005 and 2030. A computer scientist and mathematician, he was a teacher at San Diego State University in California (1972-2000) before becoming a full-time writer of the \"hard\" science fiction novels that made him famous. He has also won Hugo awards for his novellas \"Fast Times at Fairmont High\" (2002) and \"The Cookie Monster\" (2003). - Courtesy of infoplease.com\n\nClick here for Norwesconâs October 2009 interview with Vernor Vinge.\n\nClick here for more information about Vernor Vinge.\n\nArtist Guest of Honor\n\nJohn Jude Palencar\n\nArtist and illustrator, John Jude Palencar, is known throughout the world for his distinctive, ethereal style and unique conceptualization. For more than 20 years he has received honors for his contributions to the field of illustration including Gold and Silver Medals from the Society of Illustrators, two Gold Book Awards from Spectrum, and Best Hardcover and two Best Paperback Awards from the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists for three consecutive years. Besides being an active artist and illustrator, he has served on the juries of several international art competitions.\n\nHis work has appeared on hundreds of book covers in over thirty countries. Renowned authors, H.P. Lovecraft, Ursula LeGuin, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Octavia Butler, Stephen King, Charles deLint and Christopher Paolini are but a few. TIME Magazine, Smithsonian Magazine, National Geographic Magazine and Television and the Philadelphia Opera have employed his artistic talents for their publication and productions. Most recently, his cover paintings for Eragon and Eldest, by Christopher Paolini, have appeared on the New York Times Childrenâs Best Seller List for the past year. An influence on the young prolific author, Christopher Paolini named Eragonâs birthplace: âPalancar Valleyâ after John Jude (see chapter three â Eragon).\n\nHe has been a featured artist in IDEA Magazine in Japan and enjoys an on-going artist-in- residence program in County Kerry, Ireland. There, his paintings were included in a special exhibit entitled, âImages of Irelandâ, held at the National Museum in Dublin. He also donated his work to raise money for the Cill Rialaig Project at the 6th Annual Ambassadorâs Golf Classic held in Waterville, County Kerry, Ireland.\n\nHis work was featured in an exhibition entitled, âAs Seen From Ohio: Nine Illustratorsâ, at the Centro Cultural Recoleta in Argentina as well as The Spectrum Retrospective Exhibition held at The Society of Illustrators Museum of American Illustration in New York City. John Jude also has participated in dozens of group exhibitions at colleges and universities throughout the country.\n\nHis paintings are in numerous corporate and private collections in the United States and abroad. â Courtesy of johnjudepalencar.com\n\nFor more information about John Jude Palancar, visit his website.\n\nSpecial Guest\n\nCory Doctorow\n\nCory Doctorow (craphound.com) is a science fiction novelist, blogger and technology activist. He is the co-editor of the popular weblog Boing Boing (boingboing.net), and a contributor to Wired, Popular Science, Make, the New York Times, and many other newspapers, magazines and websites.

In 2007, he served as the Fulbright Chair at the Annenberg Center for Public Diplomacy at the University of Southern California.\n\nHis novels are published by Tor Books and simultaneously released on the Internet under Creative Commons licenses that encourage their re-use and sharing, a move that increases his sales by enlisting his readers to help promote his work. He has won the Locus and Sunburst Awards, and been nominated for the Hugo, Nebula and British Science Fiction Awards. His latest novel, New York Times Bestseller LITTLE BROTHER, was published in May 2008, and his latest short story collection is OVERCLOCKED: STORIES OF THE FUTURE PRESENT. In 2008, Tachyon Books published a collection of his essays, called CONTENT: SELECTED ESSAYS ON TECHNOLOGY, CREATIVITY, COPYRIGHT AND THE FUTURE OF THE FUTURE (with an introduction by John Perry Barlow) and IDW published a collection of comic books inspired by his short fiction called CORY DOCTOROW'S FUTURISTIC TALES OF THE HERE AND NOW. His next novel is MAKERS, due from Tor Books in October, 2009.\n\nHe co-founded the open source peer-to-peer software company OpenCola, sold to OpenText, Inc in 2003, and presently serves on the boards and advisory boards of the Participatory Culture Foundation, the MetaBrainz Foundation, Technorati, Inc, the Organization for Transformative Works, Areae, the Annenberg Center for the Study of Online Communities, and Onion Networks, Inc.\n\nIn 2007, Entertainment Weekly called him, \"The William Gibson of his generation.\" He was also named one of Forbes Magazine's 2007/8 Web Celebrities, and one of the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders for 2007.\n\nHe is presently working on a new young adult novel, FOR THE WIN (about union organizing in video games).\n\nOn February 3, 2008, he became a father.

Cramer - Bio by Pauline B. Cramer (January 23, 2010)\n\nJohn Cramer is a Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Washington in Seattle. Although he formally retired in January 2010, he will continue teaching part time and continue his usual physics research in ultra-relativistic heavy ion physics, participating in the STAR experiment at the RHIC facility of Brookhaven National Laboratory (Long Island, NY). He is also currently working on a popular-level book about the transactional interpretation of QM, as well as a third hard SF novel.\n\nJohn is an experimental physicist. He has published over 200 physics research papers in peer-reviewed physics journals. As an experimental physicist, John approaches theoretical physics from an experimentalist viewpoint, writing physics papers on Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, Bose-Einstein Interferometry, etc. He is known as the originator of the Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, which he considers to be a superior alternative to the orthodox Copenhagen Interpretation. See http://faculty.washington.edu/jcramer/TI/tiqm_1986.pdf\n\nJohn is actively pursuing a UW-based experiment in quantum optics that tests for the possibility that quantum nonlocality can be used for communication. He has received considerable media attention for the âtime travelâ aspects of this work. This experiment, if successful, would imply that entanglement can be used to send a superluminal signal between two distant locations (or backwards in time from the apparatus to itself).\n\nJohn writes âhardâ SF and is the author of two novels: Twistor, [William Morrow, Mar â89; AvoNova, Nov â91; Jun â97] and Einsteinâs Bridge [Avon Jun 97; Avon Eos May 98] John is also a science writer, and writes the bimonthly science-fact column \"The Alternate View\", for Analog Science Fiction and Fact magazine. John has written over 150 columns, available on the web at http://www.npl.washington.edu/av\n\nJohn G. Cramer was born and grew up in Houston, Texas. He was educated at Rice University in Houston (Ph D.1961). John and his wife Pauline have three children and six grandchildren. Their daughter Kathryn Cramer Hartwell is a writer, critic, and SF/Fantasy editor/anthologist. John and Pauline have three Shetland Sheepdogs, and John and his dogs compete in AKC agility trials.\n\nRecent Talks and Presentations\n\nhttp://faculty.washington.edu/jcramer/talks.html\n\nNorwescon 33 Power Point Presentation\n\nhttp://faculty.washington.edu/jcramer/PowerPoint/Norwescon_20100403.ppt\n\nFor more information about John G.
