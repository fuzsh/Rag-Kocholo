        "text": "“Triana’s tale hovers on the border between dark fantasy and outright horror, drawing upon the creepiness of Florida’s forgotten corners to infuse the setting with a sense of loss, decay, and impending doom.”\n\nPublishers Weekly (BookLife)\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"MOON CHILD is a tension-filled tale of paranormal suspense with a strong lead character and delicious chills. I loved it, and you will too!\"\n\nTim Waggoner\n\nBram Stoker award-winning author of Writing in the Dark and Your Turn to Suffer\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"Triana crafts Vale’s story using all of the abilities she has mastered throughout her previous work and delivers an atmospheric and haunting tale of friendship, family and fate that readers will find equally bewitching and exciting.\"\n\n​\n\nThomas Joyce\n\nThis is Horror\n\n​\n\n“Terrifying and beautiful in the tradition of the best Gothic fiction. The atmosphere lingers long after the last page is turned.”\n\n​\n\n- Michelle Zink, bestselling author of the PROPHECY OF THE SISTERS Trilogy\n\n​\n\n\"Gaby Triana's ISLAND OF BONES is a devious mystery with plenty of dark secrets, unexpected twists, and a very satisfying payoff. Highly recommended!\"\n\n​\n\nJonathan Maberry\n\nNYT bestselling author of\n\nGLIMPSE and V-WARS\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"First rate Southern Gothic, haunted and scary horror, steeped in atmosphere and strong on both story and characters.\"\n\n​\n\nCatherine Cavendish\n\nauthor of gothic fiction and\n\nIN DARKNESS, SHADOWS BREATHE\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"Very well written, highly engaging...enjoyable and fun, defying several genre expectations.\"\n\n​\n\nChristine Morgan\n\nThe Horror Fiction Review\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"A chilling, smart mystery. I could almost hear the hoofbeats!\"\n\n​\n\nAlex Flinn, author of Beastly\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"Tropical horror is not a genre explored as often, (after all folks don’t equate paradise with horror), but Island of Bones is a standout entry in the literary camp of the niche subgenre.\"\n\n​\n\nNicholas Diak\n\nPop Culture Scholar\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"In this page-turning, eerie novel, the author skillfully builds an air of quiet menace, where 'pumpkins sit on front porches like families gathered in the dark, telling ghost stories.' The book's action scenes echo the rhythms of hoofbeats, and the reader's pulse should pound along with Michaela's. It's indeed ambitious to write a horror story involving Irving and Shelley, titans of the genre; luckily, Triana turns out to be up to the challenge, with a smart, unusual take on the true legend of Sleepy Hollow.\"\n\nKirkus Reviews\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"On the surface, ISLAND OF BONES provides a drama-packed battle with the evils of human jealousy and greed against the backdrop of a swirling assault of ghosts and nature. But scratch away the veneer and you will uncover a reminder that supressing your true potential can be detrimental to your mental wellbeing. So be you, face your ghosts and pursue your passions just as Gaby Triana has done with this novel.\"\n\n​\n\nVicki Camps, Nightmarish Conjurings\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"With Island of Bones, Gaby Triana's nuanced story-telling enthralled and terrified me. I couldn't put down this pulse-pounding horror story until I'd devoured it in one sitting.\"\n\n​\n\nVirna DePaul\n\nNew York Times bestselling author\n\n​\n\n\"From the opening pages, this spooky YA immerses readers in an atmosphere reminiscent of the “real” Sleepy Hollow—a dark train station, late at night, a chilly wind, mysterious voices echoing in the air.\"\n\n​\n\nSchool Library Journal\n\n\"Wake the Hollow kept me on my toes. It had mystery, unexplainable romance, history like I’ve never read before, and a main character that I would love to see more of. Like it’s inspiration, it will be a story that won’t be forgotten any time soon.\"\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMoriah Chavis, A Leisure Moment\n\n​\n\n\"I've read about one hundred books over the last year, from giants like Stephen King, strange novels by Clive Barker, and indie novels from across the genre spectrum, but few have been as evocatively human as Island of Bones.\"\n\n​\n\nD.S. Black\n\nhorror author\n\nand reviewer\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"OMG!!! This retelling of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow surpassed all my wildest expectations and then some. The cover is stunning and the author's creative take on this ghostly read is simply outstanding. I was on the edge of my seat throughout this read that captivated me from beginning to end. This is an ominous read that will delight and scare you.\"\n\nYA Book Divas\n\n\"Like Richard Matheson's Hell House (which is just across the road, thematically speaking), the Springs is built on psychogeological stratae of human misery that gradually manifest through the different characters, who each have their own personal reasons for investigating the secrets of the place.\"\n\n​\n\n- Daisy Lyle\n\nGinger Nuts of Horror\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\" Gaby Triana's latest gothic horror novel is deliciously creepy, with a lush Florida setting that is a character in its own right. A gripping tale that will make your skin crawl in the best way.\"\n\n​\n\nDiana Rodriguez Wallach,\n\nauthor of the YA Latinx horror novel SMALL TOWN MONSTERS\n\n(Random House, Fall ‘21)\n\n\"It had everything I could want in a good book: great, unique characters, thick suspense that kept me on my toes, a gripping mystery, a sweet, unexpected romance and a town with an interesting history and past.\"\n\n​\n\nNight Owl Reviews\n\nNOR Top Pick\n\n\"The tone of the story is a bit ominous, which makes it difficult to put down. [...] The mystery of Washington Irving's descendants grows and so does the danger to Michaela. The suspense lasts throughout the book and the supernatural touch brings the right amount of thrill to the story. Wonderful spookiness!\"\n\n​\n\nLynnDell Watson\n\nDelta High School Media Specialist\n\n​\n\n\"I loved this book. It sucked me in so fast that I couldn't even stop reading long enough to take notes for this review. Oh my poor heart was a racing while reading this. I felt every emotion poor Mica felt, her fear, the tears, and the confusion on who to trust. The writing was amazing.\"\n\n​\n\nM.A. Hickman\n\nDaydreaming Between the Lines\n\n\"Great mix of suspense, mystery, and a little bit of romance. I am a big fan of the Sleepy Hollow legend, so it was very cool to see a modern story based on it.\"\n\nAmy, Amazon Reviewer\n\n\"Quite the mystery. Kept me on my toes the entire time!\"\n\nChristina\n\nLulo Fangirl YouTube Channel\n\n​\n\n\"OMG! This book kept me on my toes! It left me guessing right until the end...LOVED LOVED LOVED it!!\"\n\nShawna Cramer Blog!\n\n​\n\n\"Gaby Triana expertly weaves a story that kept me going. I was binge reading this book and had a book hangover afterwards.\"\n\n​\n\nCasia Courtier, 60 Seconds and More"
