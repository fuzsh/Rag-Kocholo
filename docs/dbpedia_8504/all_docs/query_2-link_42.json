        "text": "The following magazines are no longer eligible for the Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine:\n\nApex Magazine\n\nThe Dark\n\nLightspeed Magazine\n\nNebula Rift\n\nNew Realm\n\nAll five are now considered professional by the rules for the category. We’d like to congratulate them on their success and point out that this demonstrates that the revised rules are working as intended.\n\nPlease do not nominate these publications, even if you enjoyed them. You’d be tossing away your nomination. Please see the latest edition of the directory for an up-to-date status on eligible nominees. If a market you are interested in is not on the list, please let us know.\n\nEstablished: 2006\n\nEditors: Kaolin Fire (founding editor & editor-in-chief), Sue Miller (founding editor), Sal Coraccio (founding editor), Julia Bernd (editor & copyeditor), Debbie Moorhouse (editor & copyeditor)\n\nOverview:\n\nGUD (pronounced “good”) is a print/pdf magazine with two hundred pages of literary and genre fiction, poetry, art, and articles. Modern in business, method, and execution, but timeless in message, GUD is published twice a year, for your reading pleasure.\n\nGUD is FOR THE WRITER or ARTIST. A simple submission process, and the potential to earn royalties. Our issues never go out of print.\n\nGUD is FOR THE READER. We print the best of the best. Our business model is built for artists and consumers, not for ourselves. And GUD is flexible—buy the whole magazine or a single .pdf of the story, poem, artwork, or article you just have to have.\n\nAwards and Recognition:\n\n2008 Aurealis Award for Best Horror Short Story (Painlessness by Kirstyn McDermott, Issue 2)\n\nNebula Recommendation (Night Bird Soaring by Traci Morganfield, Issue 3).\n\nBSFA Best Short Fiction Recommendation (ditto).\n\nThree Honorable Mentions in The Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror 2008 (Twenty-First Annual Collection) (Songs of the Dead by Sarah Singleton and Chris Butler, Issue 0, Unzipped by Steven J.

Grant and Kelly Link\n\nOverview:\n\nLCRW is a paperzine — although we’ve been selling ebooks (on our site and fictionwise.com) for a couple of years now. We’re also going to go back and release the back issues as ebooks in the near future (i.e. when Fictionwise catches up with its submissions!).\n\nWhen I started the zine, it was in frustration at not being able to find the kinds of things I wanted to read. This isn’t true any more, but as long as we get great stuff in the mail, we’ll keep publishing.\n\nSmall Beer Press publishes 4-6 books a year but it’s fun to keep things simple with LCRW. It basically pays for itself, no small feat for a magazine of any size. We do black and white covers and legal sized paper because it’s affordable and a good page size.\n\nAwards and Recognition:\n\nLCRW was a Hugo nominee a couple of years ago, that was fun. Various stories have been reprinted in various year’s best anthologies.\n\nOther Items of Interest:\n\nI suppose the most interesting part would be that, if you like, you can get a chocolate bar with each issue. (That’s one part of the zine we’d love more submissions for.)\n\nWebsite:\n\nwww.lcrw.net/lcrw\n\nEstablished: 2009\n\nEditors: Caren Gussoff, Shane Hoversten, Eden Robins\n\nOverview:\n\nBrain Harvest: An Almanac of Bad-Ass Speculative Fiction is the creation of a brooding Minnesotan neuroscientist, a zombie-obsessed sexpert, and the ex-burlesque dancing Jewish mother you never knew you wanted. We all write and read speculative fiction, and we share a dream: to deliver whiz-bang spec fic you can swallow in a mouthful, but that outlives all of us. Brain Harvest will publish electronically and can be read right here, or dispatched to your iPhone, Blackberry, or whatever other mobile device–and maybe, one day, straight into your brain.\n\nAwards and Recognition:\n\nMentioned/endorsed by BoingBoing, Tor.com. No awards…yet. We’ve got our eyes on the prize, though.\n\nOther Items of Interest:\n\nWe will be holding our first annual contest this summer.

We discover and showcase quality works by predominantly Canadian writers and artists, in the genres we call “Speculative and Fantastic” literature. We foster the growth of emerging writers in this genre, by offering support and direction through constructive criticism, education, mentoring, and manuscript development. We try to publish as many new writers as possible, alongside works by established writers, and we also endeavor to support these writings with innovative cover art for every thought and emotion-provoking issue! We pay $50 to $200 for short stories (maximum 6,000 words) and poetry. As a member of Magazines Canada, we are currently undertaking an endeavor to offer our issues in a digital format to download through Zinio.\n\nOur History:\n\nIn 1989, a small group of Edmonton writers formed The Copper Pig Writers Society in order to fill a niche in Canada. At the time, there was no paying market for literary works that the major American SF & Fantasy magazines deemed to be too “alien” for their audiences.\n\nEnglish-speaking Canadian SF writers were frustrated with having to “Americanize” their stories for the paying markets. We knew there was an audience hungry for thoughtful, intelligent (often unconventional) SF and Fantasy with a uniquely Canadian perspective. After selling out our initial print run of a test issue filled with stories sent to us by invitation, we began receiving inquiries as to when the “next one” would appear. That was nearly twenty years ago!\n\nAwards and Recognition:\n\nNomination – 2008 Aurora Award for Best Work in English (Other), Diane Walton, Managing Editor\n\nWinner – 1997 Aurora Award for Best Work in English (Other), The Copper Pig Writers’ Society\n\nWinner – 1995 Aurora Award for Best Work in English (Other), The Copper Pig Writers’ Society\n\nWinner – 1991 Aurora Award for Best Work in English (Other), The Copper Pig Writers’ Society\n\nWinner – 1990 Aurora Award for Best Work in English (Other), The Copper Pig Writers’ Society\n\nOther Items of Interest:\n\n“The ABCs on how NOT to write speculative fiction” seminars.

Valente, Ken Scholes, and Mary Robinette Kowal. Each month, we also produce audio fiction which can be found directly on our site or available for free download through iTunes. In his summary of Clarkesworld in The Year’s Best Science Fiction, Gardner Dozois describes our taste in fiction as “stylishy written and usually faintly perverse.”\n\nOur non-fiction is split between interviews with authors and artists like Gene Wolfe, Steven Erikson, Kage Baker, John Picacio and Margo Lanagan, and articles on science, art, or literature. We’re also quite proud to be able to feature the works of new artists as a virtual cover to each issue.\n\nAwards and Recognition:\n\nNominee: 2009 Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine.\n\n2006 Million Writers Award for Best New Online Magazine.\n\n2006 Million Writers Award for Best Short Story.\n\nStories reprinted in The Year’s Best Science Fiction, The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Fantasy Best of the Year, Unplugged, Wilde Stories 2008: The Best of the Year’s Gay Speculative Fiction, The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror, and Horror Best of the Year.\n\nStories appearing on the recommended reading/honorable mention lists in The Year’s Best Science Fiction, The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror, Unplugged, the Locus Magazine Recommended Reading List, Nebula Awards Short Story Long List, and the Million Writers Notable Stories List.\n\nA complete list with links to winning, recommended, and nominated stories is available here.\n\nOther Items of Interest:\n\nIn an attempt to reach a broader audience and fund the free edition, all the original fiction in Clarkesworld is collected annually in a print anthology series called Realms.

Hartwell, & Kevin J. Maroney\n\nOverview:\n\nNYRSF is a monthly 24-page magazine of book reviews and criticism covering the science fiction and fantasy field published by Dragon Press, and run by an all-volunteer staff.
