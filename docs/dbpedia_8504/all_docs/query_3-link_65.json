        "text": "5 burning questions with Kathryn Cramer\n\nAuthor, editor, artist, and photographer Kathryn Cramer has edited 30 books including the World Fantasy\n\nAward-winning THE ARCHITECTURE OF FEAR (with Peter D. Pautz),\n\nMASTERPIECES OF FANTASY AND WONDER (with David G. Hartwell), THE\n\nASCENT OF WONDER: THE EVOLUTION OF HARD SF (with Hartwell), 11\n\nvolumes of YEAR’S BEST SF (7-17 with Hartwell), 8 volumes of YEAR’S\n\nBEST FANTASY (2-9 with Hartwell) and HIEROGLYPH: STORIES AND VISIONS\n\nFOR A BETTER FUTURE (with Ed Finn). Alongside Hartwell, Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa Nielsen Hayden, Susan Palwick, and Samuel R. Delany, she started the influential NEW YORK REVIEW OF SCIENCE FICTION.\n\nAn early proponent for hypertext fiction, Cramer served as editor for Seagate Systems, where she developed new works by others and crafted the hypertext fiction “In Small & Large Pieces.” Her more traditional short fiction has appeared in ASIMOV’S, NATURE, and Rudy Rucker’s legendary anthology MATHENAUTS. TOR.COM published Cramer’s chapbook AM I FREE TO GO?\n\nCover by Scott Bakal\n\nAll of us at Tachyon wish the multi-talented Kathryn an extraordinary birthday. May it be filled with wonders.\n\nFor more info on YEAR’S BEST FANTASY, visit the Tachyon page.\n\nCover designs by Ann Monn"
