Kris Swank framed Harry Potter not only in terms of the latest dystopian craze in YA fiction (Divergent, The Hunger Games), but also with the dystopian tradition of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. The Dolores Umbridge-corrupted …\n\nContinue reading MythCon 45 Day 3: Postmodernity at MythCon\n\nMythCon 45 Day 2: Where does fantasy fit?\n\nDay 2 of MythCon began Saturday morning. After breakfast, I really came to appreciate how many people had come to Wheaton College. In addition to seeing many of the faces I saw on Friday, Corey Olsen, the Tolkien Professor, was there. Allow me to explain one thing about this guy: I first listened to his …\n\nContinue reading MythCon 45 Day 2: Where does fantasy fit?\n\nFahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury\n\nIt was a pleasure to burn. The letters, the opening of Ray Bradbury's seminal dystopian novel, glimmered flatly on my Kobo screen as I realized the irony of what I was doing. I realized swiftly that the battle of digital media versus print is a central point that burns down in Fahranheit 451. I will …\n\nContinue reading Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury\n\nThe Year’s Best Fantasy, eds. David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer\n\nIt's like fantasy tapas, or if you prefer, a buffet: fantasy short stories contain all the excitement and inspiration of a novel, in a way that requires less commitment. Instead of reading a five-course fantasy series of 900+ pages, you can hunker down for a 10- or 20-page adventure. And while you're at it, eat …\n\nContinue reading The Year’s Best Fantasy, eds. David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer\n\nThe Secret History of Fantasy, edited by Peter S. Beagle\n\nIf you're like me, you have probably starved for an original fantasy novel. So many novels and short stories rely too heavily on The Lord of the Rings and the epic fantasy genre that spawned from it. Are there any original fantasy works that use impossible situations without having elves, orcs, and dragons run across …\n\nContinue reading The Secret History of Fantasy, edited by Peter S. Beagle\n\n13 Things I Learned Writing My First Novel: Battles of Rofp\n\nI hope you all had a merry Christmas. Now, while you're still warm with Christmas feeling (perhaps you are snug by the fire with a cup of hot cocoa, or a drink of rum and eggnog, experiencing a similar but not altogether identical feeling of warmth) let me take you down to Memory Lane to …\n\nContinue reading 13 Things I Learned Writing My First Novel: Battles of Rofp\n\nKing Arthur Conqueror of the Arctic? Historical Fantasy and Early British Imperialism\n\nJohn Dee was Queen Elizabeth I's court astrologer, mathematician, and geographer--and he might have become the first lord of the North American territory we now call Canada. Dee is known as a \"Renaissance man\" for the breadth of his knowledge and for his tendency towards the occult. On a trip to the Continent, he supposedly …\n\nContinue reading King Arthur Conqueror of the Arctic? Historical Fantasy and Early British Imperialism\n\nTop Ten Wainscot Societies\n\nWhen Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone gained unprecedented popularity, the world at large was introduced to a “new” concept: a hidden magical society that lived parallel to the everyday world, but scarcely—if ever—interacting with it. The idea of hidden societies, however, is not a new one. Many fantasy novels of all types include hidden …\n\nContinue reading Top Ten Wainscot Societies\n\nIs Fantasy Heresy?\n\n“War begets war. Destruction begets destruction. On earth, a century ago, in the year 2020, they outlawed our books.” -Edgar Allen Poe, in Ray Bradbury's “The Exiles.” Edgar Allan Poe fights rocket men on a Mars mission to annihilate everything fantastic or non-realistic, in Ray Bradbury's short story “The Exiles.” Bradbury's short story stands with …\n\nContinue reading Is Fantasy Heresy?"
