        "text": "This is an ISFDB Bibliographic Comments page for the author (or artist or editor) David G. Hartwell. This page may be used for bibliographic comments or extended notes about the author, or discussion on how to the author's works are to be recorded . The link above leads to the ISFDB summary record for David G. Hartwell. Please use Bio:David G. Hartwell for a biographical sketch of this person. To discuss what should go on this page, use the talk page. For more on this and other header templates, see Header templates.\n\nInformation below provided in an unsigned comment by User:Lauriemann during an ISFDB outage on May 5 2009 to the main talk page. Moved here on May 6. Kevin 10:56, 6 May 2009 (UTC)\n\nI'm generally not much on working on bibliographies, but I just updated David Hartwell's for the Anticipation Souvenir Book, and I'd like to see this info incorporated into his ISFDB information. In a couple of cases, like the \"best of the year 2009,\" these books are currently forthcoming, but as they will be out before Anticipation, I didn't add \"forthcoming\" to their publication information.\n\nI was able to review all issues of the New York Review of SF, except for issues 29-91. Whenever a NYRSF editorial was completely unsigned, David is listed as having written it.\n\nIn some cases, these articles and the like may have been published under \"David Hartwell\" or \"Dave Hartwell.\" For the purposes of this overall bibliography, I did not note those differences.\n\nDavid G. Hartwell Bibliography\n\nThis is a list of the first appearances of anthologies that David G. Hartwell edited, pieces he wrote, and a partial collection of books he's edited. The bibliography is primarily from the Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB - http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/index.cgi), the NESFA Indexes (http://www.nesfa.org/press/AvailableBooksByAuthor.html), and various book catalogues David Hartwell has compiled, with additional research by Laurie Mann.
