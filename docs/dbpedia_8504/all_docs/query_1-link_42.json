        "text": "Introduction\n\nWe are in the middle of some kind of short fiction boom in science fiction and the associated genres of the fantastic. Not an economic boom, but certainly a numbers increase, and it has been building for several years. There seems to have been an increase in quality as well as in quantity, too, with well-edited semiprofessional magazines and small press anthologies of generally higher editorial standards than those anthologies issuing from big trade publishers proliferating. And all this in spite of the desperate battles of the distinguished professional magazines to secure enough distribution and sales to persist in business.\n\nThe electronic publishers on the internet maintained the levels of quality established a couple of years back, and remain a vigorous dimension of the SF field, but there was not a significant increase in the amount of good fiction originating on the internet. The increase was predominantly in the semiprofessional book and magazine publishing sphere, and even in the zine area (as opposed to fanzines—zines are analogous to the cutting edge little magazines of the literary world, published and carefully edited by individuals, rarely for profit).\n\nStill, the highest concentrations of excellence were in the professional publications, the anthologies from the small press, and the highest paying online markets. The electronic fiction websites such as Infinite Matrix, Strange Horizons, and SciFiction continued to publish much fine work, though a majority of it was fantasy or horror.\n\nThere were hundreds of good stories to choose from this year to fill this volume (there were more than five hundred listed as candidates for the Locus recommended reading list for the year), making it clear that there are a really large number of talented writers of short fiction in our field, a real bonanza for readers. There are a lots of conclusions one might draw from this, but the one we highlight is that it makes this year’s best volume even more useful, since we try to sort through all this material. The small press really did expand again this past year, both in book form and in a proliferation of little magazines, in the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nOnce again, books and magazines of high quality, often anthologies and short story collections, from Canada, Australia, and the UK, drew our attention. We have to say that this year was generally as good as the pinnacle year 2003 for original anthologies and story collections—even though most of them will not be found in local bookstores because they are available on the whole only by direct mail or internet order, or from specialty dealers at SF conventions. Still, the total of good SF stories, and perhaps even the total of all SF stories, increased noticeably last year.\n\nBut—and this is a significant but—the majority of small press publications contained only a minority of science fiction genre stories, and the bulk of the rest were speculative literature, fantasy, horror, magical realism, allegories, or uses of SF tropes and images in the context of mainstream or postmodern fiction. This commonly proceeded from a breaking the bounds of genre attitude on the part of the editors and publishers of small press short fiction, and many of their writers. Distinguished examples of this trend are Leviathan and Polyphony.\n\nAnd to our continuing amusement, this attitude was again contradicted by one of the bastions of mainstream literary fiction, McSweeney’s magazine, which published a second genre fiction issue, McSweeney’s Astonishing Stories, in 2004, edited by Michael Chabon. It was filled mainly with genre stories, although no SF this time. Perhaps more significantly, the prestigious Denver Quarterly had an issue devoted principally to fantastic fiction without announcing the fact at all. Each year we find ourselves pointing with some irony at the areas of growth in SF, as if they were double-edged swords. While many of the ambitious insiders want to break out, at least some ambitious outsiders are breaking in, and some of them at the top of the genre. This is now a trend several years old.\n\nIt is our opinion that it is a good thing to have genre boundaries. If we didn’t, young writers would have to find something else to transgress to draw attention to themselves.\n\nSo, for readers new to this series, we repeat our usual disclaimer: This selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was published during the year 2004. It would take several more volumes this size to have nearly all of the best short stories—though even then, not all of the best novellas. And we believe that representing the best from year to year, while it is not physically possible to encompass it all in one even very large book, also implies presenting some substantial variety of excellences, and we left some worthy stories out in order to include others in this limited space.\n\nOur general principle for selection: This book is full of science fiction—every story in this book is clearly that and not something else. We have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream, and postmodern literature. We (Kathryn Cramer and David G. Hartwell) edit the Year’s Best Fantasy in paperback from Eos, as a companion volume to this one—look for it if you enjoy short fantasy fiction, too. But here, we choose science fiction.\n\nWe try in each volume of this series to represent the varieties of tones and voices and attitudes that keep the genre vigorous and responsive to the changing realities out of which it emerges, in science and daily life. It is supposed to be fun to read, a special kind of fun you cannot find elsewhere. This is a book about what’s going on now in SF. The stories that follow show, and the story notes point out, the strengths of the evolving genre in the year 2004.\n\nDavid G. Hartwell & Kathryn Cramer\n\nSergeant Chip\n\nBRADLEY DENTON\n\nBradley Denton [www.sff.net/people/bradley.denton/] lives outside Austin, Texas, with his wife, Barbara, their cat, and their twin hound dogs. He began publishing in the science fiction field in 1984. His first novel, Wrack & Roll (1986), is an alternate history. He won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for his second novel, Buddy Holly Is Alive and Well on Ganymede (1991). His next novel, Blackburn (1993), is a horror novel about a serial killer. Lunatics (1996) is fantasy. A new novel, Laughin’ Boy, about terrorism and daytime television, will appear from Subterranean Press in 2005. Most of his short fiction is fantastic, and collected in A Conflagration Artist and The Calvin Coolidge Home for Dead Comedians (1994)—two books which were published together in a slipcase and which won a World Fantasy Award for Best Collection—and in One Day Closer to Death (1998).\n\nSergeant Chip was published in Fantasy & Science Fiction, which had a particularly strong year in 2004. In this fine novella about the military virtues, the central character is a cybernetically enhanced dog. There is a war in the future in the Middle East, and something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nBut Sergeant Chip is intelligent, skilled, and a good dog who stands for the good, against anyone and anything. The story reverberates with contemporary political references and powerful sentiment. We didn’t read a better story this year.\n\nTo the Supreme Commander of the soldier who bears this message—\n\nSir or Madam:\n\nToday before it was light I had to roll in the stream to wash blood from my fur. I decided then to send You these words.\n\nSo I think of the word shapes, and the girl writes them for me. I know how the words are shaped because I could see them whenever Captain Dial spoke. And I always knew what he was saying.\n\nThe girl writes on a roll of paper she found in the stone hut when we began using it as our quarters three months ago. She already had pencils. She has written her own words on the paper many times since then, but she has torn those words from the roll and placed them in her duffel. Her own words have different shapes than the ones she writes for me now. She doesn’t even know what my word shapes mean, because the shapes are all that I show her. So the responsibility for their meanings is mine alone.\n\nJust as the responsibility for my actions is mine alone.\n\nLast night I killed eighteen of Your soldiers.\n\nI didn’t want to do that. They reminded me of some of the soldiers I knew before, the ones who followed Captain Dial with me. But I had to kill them because they came to attack us. And if I let them do that, I would be disobeying orders.\n\nI heard them approach while the girl, the two boys, and the old man slept. So I went out and climbed the ridge behind the hut so I could see a long way. I have good night vision, and I had no trouble spotting the soldiers as they split into two squads and spread out. Their intent was to attack our hut from different angles to make its defense more difficult. I knew this because it was one of the things Captain Dial taught me.\n\nSo I did another thing Captain Dial taught me. As the two squads scuttled to their positions to await the order to attack, I crept down toward them through the grass and brambles. I crept with my belly to the earth so they couldn’t see me coming. Not even with their infrared goggles.\n\nCaptain Dial once said I was black as night and silent as air. He was proud when he said it. I remembered that when I crept to Your soldiers.\n\nThey didn’t hear me as I went from one to another. They were spread out too far. Their leader wasn’t as smart as Captain Dial. I bit each one’s throat so it tore open and the soldier couldn’t shout. There were some sounds, but they weren’t loud.\n\nThe first soldier had a lieutenant’s bar on his helmet. I had seen it from a long way away. It was the only officer’s insignia I saw in either squad. So I went to him first. That way he couldn’t give the order to attack before I was finished.\n\nBut the others would have attacked sooner or later, even without an order from their lieutenant. So I had to kill them all.\n\nThe last soldier was the only female among the eighteen. As I approached her, I smelled the same kind of soap that Captain Dial’s wife Melanie used. That made me pause as I remembered how things were a long time ago when I slept at the foot of their bed. But then the soldier knew I was there and turned her weapon toward me. So I bit her throat before she could fire.\n\nI dragged the soldiers to the ravine near the southern end of the ridge. You’ll find them there side by side if You arrive before the wild animals do. I did my best to treat them with honor.\n\nThen I went to the stream. The stream is near the hut, so I tried to be quiet. I didn’t want to wake my people before sunrise.\n\nAfter washing, I went into the grass and shook off as much water as I could. But there was no one to rub me with a towel. There was no one to touch my head and tell me I was good.\n\nI remembered then that no one had ever told Captain Dial he was good, either.\n\nThis is what it means to be the leader.\n\nI wanted to howl. But I didn’t. My people were still asleep.\n\nI take care of them. I don’t let anyone hurt them. These were Captain Dial’s orders, and I will not disobey.\n\nCaptain Dial was my commanding officer. I was his first sergeant. If You examine the D Company roster, You will see that my pay grade is K-9.\n\nMy name is Chip.\n\nWhenever Captain Dial gave me an order, I obeyed as fast as I could. And then he always touched my head and told me I was good. Sometimes when I was extra fast, he gave me a treat. I liked the treats, but I liked the touch even more.\n\nThere was never a time when Captain Dial wasn’t my leader. But he wasn’t always a captain, and I wasn’t always his first sergeant. In the beginning he was a lieutenant, and I was his corporal.\n\nWe were promoted because of the day we demonstrated our training to the people in the bleachers.\n\nThat morning, in our quarters, Lieutenant Dial said that what we would participate in that afternoon was political bullshit. Money for the war was about to be cut, so public-relations events like this were an attempt to bolster civilian support. But Lieutenant Dial said that only two things had ever motivated the public to support the military: heroism and vengeance.\n\nHe also said that we had to do well regardless. He said I would have to do a good job and make him proud. So I stood at attention, and I thought about running fast to find mines and attack enemies. I thought about making Lieutenant Dial proud.\n\nThen he touched my head. He knew my thoughts. He always knew my thoughts. He told me I was good and gave me permission to be at ease.\n\nSo I wiggled and pushed my head against his knees, and my tail wagged hard as he buckled my duty harness. Even though he had said it was bullshit, I could smell that he was excited about the job ahead. That made me excited too. And as we left our quarters, Lieutenant Dial’s wife Melanie came with us. That made me even more excited, because she was almost never with us except in our quarters.\n\nMelanie spoke to me every morning, and although I couldn’t understand her thoughts too well, I knew she was telling me to take care of Lieutenant Dial throughout our day of training. And every night when Lieutenant Dial and I returned, Melanie touched my head and said I was good. Then, after we all ate supper, she and Lieutenant Dial would climb into their bed, I would lie down on my cushion at its foot, and we would sleep. Sometimes in the night their scents grew stronger and blended together, and they made happy sounds. But I stayed quiet because I wanted them to stay happy. Other times I smelled or heard strangers outside our quarters, and I would go on alert even though Lieutenant Dial was still asleep and had not given me an order. But the strangers always went away, and then I slept again too.\n\nThose were the only times Melanie was with us, and that one order every morning was the only order she ever gave me. All of my other orders, all of my treats, and all of my food came from Lieutenant Dial.\n\nBut Lieutenant Dial loved Melanie. I could see the word love whenever he thought of her. And that made me glad because it made him glad. So we were all happy on the day she came with us. She smelled like a hundred different flowers all mixed together, and she was wearing new clothes that seemed to float around her.\n\nShe also wore a gift that Lieutenant Dial had given her the night before. It was a shiny rock on a silver chain that she wore around her neck. Lieutenant Dial told me that Melanie liked the color of the rock. It just looked like a rock on a chain to me. But when Lieutenant Dial put it around Melanie’s neck, it made me think of the chain and tags that Lieutenant Dial wore around his own neck whenever he was on duty. And it also made me think of the collar he put on me when I wasn’t wearing my duty harness. So then I understood why Melanie was so happy to receive the rock and chain. Now we all had things to wear around our necks.\n\nWe didn’t go to our usual training area at the fort that day. Instead we went to a park by the ocean. There were flags and people everywhere. It was busy and noisy, and I wanted to run around and smell everything. But Lieutenant Dial ordered me to stay beside him, and that was fun too. I still got to smell everything. We walked from one tree to another, with me on one side of Lieutenant Dial and Melanie on the other. And at every tree, people gathered around while Lieutenant Dial told them who he was and who I was. Then he would give me a few orders—easy things like attention, on guard, and secure-the-perimeter—and we would move on. A lot of people asked if they could touch me, but Lieutenant Dial said they couldn’t. He explained that I was on duty. I wasn’t a pet. I was a corporal.\n\nHe was proud when he said it, and that made me proud too.\n\nAs we walked from place to place, sometimes Lieutenant Dial held Melanie’s hand in his. And once, Melanie reached across and touched my head. This violated the rule Lieutenant Dial had been telling everyone. But even though I was on duty, it seemed all right. I was glad she did it.\n\nAfter a while we walked away from the trees to a broad stretch of lawn beside the ocean. I saw a long pier floating on the water. And across the lawn from the pier were bleachers with people in them. There were more people in the bleachers than I had ever seen in one place before, and some of them were high-ranking officers in dress uniforms. So I knew that even if what was going to happen here was bullshit, it was important bullshit.\n\nOut on the lawn were little flags, mud puddles, wooden walls, sandbag fortifications, and some mock-enemies. I knew they were mock-enemies because they wore dark, padded suits. All of these things were familiar to me from training. But there were more things on the lawn than I had ever seen in one training session, and that excited me.\n\nMelanie went to the bleachers while Lieutenant Dial took me onto the lawn, where we were joined by other soldiers. Some of the other soldiers were also K-9s. I knew most of them. Lieutenant Dial and I had trained with them many times.\n\nOut on the pier, men and women dressed in white stood at attention. And when Lieutenant Dial and I reached a spot in the middle of the lawn, he told me to stand at attention as well. So I did, and all of the other soldiers did too.\n\nA colonel stood in front of the bleachers and addressed the crowd. He said a lot of words through a loudspeaker, but I couldn’t understand them. Since they didn’t come from Lieutenant Dial, they were meaningless.\n\nWhen the colonel stopped talking, the people in the bleachers clapped their hands. Then a soldier ran onto the lawn and handed Lieutenant Dial a microphone. Lieutenant Dial signaled that I should remain at attention, so I didn’t move as he took a step forward and addressed the people.\n\nHe told them a lot of things about K-9 soldiers. One thing he said was that while war dogs required a lot of training, we didn’t have to be trained to understand loyalty or rank. A dog who was raised and trained by one soldier would always see that soldier as his or her pack leader. So if Lieutenant Dial was put in charge of a platoon, that platoon would become my pack. And I would see my duty to that pack as absolute and unquestionable.\n\nIt surprised me that Lieutenant Dial had to explain that to people. It was as obvious to me as knowing that food is for eating. But then I remembered that people didn’t always think the same way that Lieutenant Dial and I thought. Melanie, for example. Melanie was always kind to me, but sometimes I could smell that she also feared me a little. And I always wondered how that could be. Lieutenant Dial loved Melanie, so I would never hurt her. And as long as I was near her, I would never let anything else hurt her, either. So I hoped that what Lieutenant Dial was saying to the people in the bleachers would help Melanie understand that she never had to be afraid.\n\nThen Lieutenant Dial said something that made him sad as he said it. I don’t think the people knew how sad it made him, but I knew. The other K-9s knew, too.\n\nHe said that during a war in the past, some high-ranking officers had decided that K-9s weren’t really soldiers. Instead, they were classified as equipment. That meant that when their units left the field, K-9s were abandoned or destroyed. They were treated like utility vehicles or tents. They weren’t allowed to return to their home quarters with their handlers.\n\nLieutenant Dial always spoke the truth, but this truth was difficult for me to comprehend. I knew I wasn’t equipment. I knew the difference between a vehicle and a dog. And the K-9s in that past war must have known the difference too. So I was glad the regulations had changed. But I wondered then, and wonder now, whether there might still be some high-ranking officers who don’t think of me as a soldier.\n\nI urge You not to make that mistake.\n\nLieutenant Dial’s sadness went away as he continued talking. He described some of the duties K-9 soldiers perform, and as he described those duties, different handlers ordered their K-9s to perform them. And as the dogs obeyed, their images appeared on a big screen that had been set up beside the pier.\n\nOne dog, a pointy-eared shepherd, attacked and subdued first one mock-enemy, then three, and then five. He was good at it. Even though the mock-enemies were padded so he couldn’t really hurt them, I could smell that they were afraid of him.\n\nAnother dog, a lean pinscher, ran fast fast fast, dodging and leaping over obstacles that popped up before him, and he delivered a medical kit to another soldier at the end of the lawn. Then he dragged that soldier to a designated safety point while avoiding some booby traps. The booby traps went off bang bang bang after the pinscher and his soldier were past them.\n\nA big-chested Malinois destroyed a machine-gun nest.\n\nAnother shepherd crept on her belly to flank an enemy platoon.\n\nA hound pointed out hidden land mines and howled as he found each one.\n\nLieutenant Dial announced each K-9’s name and rank, each handler’s name and rank, and the task to be performed. The K-9s were all good, and the people in the bleachers clapped. So I was glad because everyone was happy. But I was getting more and more excited because I wanted it to be my turn. In fact, as the second shepherd completed her flanking maneuver and took down a mock-enemy from behind, I almost broke attention. I wanted to help. I wanted to be a good soldier, too.\n\nI whimpered, and Lieutenant Dial gave me a corrective glance. So I tried extra hard to remain still and silent. I didn’t want to disappoint Lieutenant Dial. Disappointing Lieutenant Dial would be the worst thing in the world.\n\nWhen all of the other dogs had performed their tasks, Lieutenant Dial told the people that the modern K-9 soldier went beyond those of the past. He told them that K-9s and their handlers were now matched according to their skills, temperaments, and rapport—because there were some dogs and humans who had a gift for understanding each other, and some who didn’t. And he told them that such matchings had been so successful that dogs often knew what their handlers wanted them to do even before any verbal or visual orders had been issued. In addition, a subcutaneous device implanted in each dog made it possible for handlers to send pulsed signals that their K-9s had been trained to recognize as orders. And the implants, in turn, sent biometric signals to the handlers to indicate their K-9s’ levels of anxiety and confidence as orders were carried out. So even when a dog and handler weren’t in close proximity, they could still communicate and complete their mission.\n\nI didn’t remember receiving my implant, but I knew it was under the skin between my shoulders. I almost never thought about it because Lieutenant Dial almost never used his transmitter anymore. He had used it often in our early days of training. But as our training had progressed, our thoughts had become clearer and clearer to each other, and one day we had both known the electronic signals weren’t needed anymore. So Lieutenant Dial had unstrapped the transmitter from his wrist and put it in a pouch on his belt. After that day, he would sometimes send a signal just to be sure my implant was working, but I always started carrying out his orders before I felt the pulses anyway. That was because I paid attention to him, and I could see his thoughts even when he was far away.\n\nWhen Lieutenant Dial finished telling the people about the communication implants, he told them about me. He told them I had been rescued from a municipal shelter as a puppy, and that a military veterinarian had determined that the dominant breeds in my genetic background were black Labrador and standard poodle. That made me a Labradoodle. Some of the people in the crowd laughed when they heard that name, but Lieutenant Dial didn’t laugh when he said it.\n\nHe said I had the intelligence of a poodle and the temperament of a Labrador. He said I was three years old and in peak physical condition. He said I weighed eighty pounds, which was big enough to be strong, but small enough to be fast and to squeeze into places too tight for people. He said my black, wavy coat was good camouflage at night. He said I was at the top of my training class. He said I was a corporal and my name was Chip.\n\nThen Lieutenant Dial looked across the lawn at a sandbagged machine-gun nest and gave me the hand signal to attack. I knew he was going to give me the signal as soon as he looked across at the sandbags, but I also knew I should wait for it. The people in the bleachers wouldn’t like it if I didn’t.\n\nBut I jumped away fast when he gave it. I ran for the sandbags, and the machine gun opened fire. It was firing blank cartridges, but I knew from training that I had to act as if the ammunition could hurt me. So I zigzagged and made quick stops behind cardboard rocks, stacks of tires, and other things that were on the lawn between Lieutenant Dial and the machine-gun nest. The machine-gun barrel swiveled to follow me, but I was too fast and tricky for it, because when I ran behind a cardboard rock, I would come out in a different direction. The machine-gun barrel couldn’t keep up, and soon I was right under it so it couldn’t point at me. Then I jumped up over the sandbags and pushed the gunner onto his back. Two mock-enemies on either side of him pointed rifles at me, so I bit one in the crotch and twisted so that he fell against the other one. Then all three mock-enemies were on their backs, and I bit the pads at their throats. A bell sounded over the loudspeaker as I broke the skin of each pad and the mock-blood came out. After the third bell, the people in the bleachers clapped.\n\nThen I felt a quick series of pulses between my shoulders, but I was already jumping away from the machine-gun nest because I knew what Lieutenant Dial wanted me to do next. I ran as fast as I could to the farthest end of the lawn, dodging mock-enemies as they popped up and tried to shoot me, until I reached the wooden wall with the knotted rope at the top. The wall was high, but I liked that. I’m good at jumping.\n\nI ran hard and jumped high, and I grabbed the bottom knot on the rope with my teeth. Then I pushed against the wall with all my feet so I could grab the next knot, and the next, and the next. Just before the next-to-last knot, a piece of the wall broke away as my feet pushed it, and I almost missed the knot. I caught it with just my front teeth. But that made me angry at the wall and the knot, because they were trying to make me disappoint Lieutenant Dial. So I bit as hard as I could with my front teeth, and I kicked and scratched the wall until another piece broke away and gave me a good place for my hind feet. Then I pulled with my teeth and pushed with my legs, and I went all the way over the wall without having to grab the last knot.\n\nOn the other side of the wall, two soldiers lay on the ground. They had mock-wounds on their legs and chests, but they weren’t pretending to be unconscious. So I went to the nearest one and let him grab the handle on my duty harness. Then I dragged him through a mock-minefield to a medical station. The mines weren’t marked with flags the way they often were in training, but I didn’t need the flags. I know the smells of many different explosives, so I could smell the mines even though they were just smoke-bangs. It was easy to drag the soldier around them. Some of them went off when we were past, but it didn’t matter. None of the smoke touched us, and I got the soldier to the medical station in the same shape I found him in.\n\nI ran back for the other soldier, but when I reached him he was pretending to be unconscious. I whined and licked his face, but I knew it wouldn’t make him stop pretending. So then I grabbed one of his flak-jacket straps and began to drag him toward the medical station. But when we were halfway through the minefield, an open utility vehicle carrying four mock-enemies came driving across it, straight for us. The mines didn’t go off as the vehicle drove over them, and the mock-enemy manning the mounted gun began firing at me and my soldier.\n\nThey were trying to prevent me from obeying Lieutenant Dial’s orders. I wouldn’t let them do that.\n\nI dropped my soldier and started running so the mock-enemies would chase me. When they did, and when we were far enough from the wounded soldier that I knew he would be safe, I made a quick stop, turned around, and jumped. I cleared the vehicle’s windshield and had just enough time to bite the pad on the gunner’s throat. The bell rang. Then I hit the ground behind the vehicle and tumbled, but got up and turned back around in time to see the gunner slump over and the driver turn the steering wheel hard. The other two mock-enemies were raising their pistols.\n\nAs the vehicle made its turn, exposing the driver, I ran and jumped again. But when I bit the pad on the driver’s throat, the skin didn’t break right away. So I hung on and bit harder. The driver gave a yell that I don’t think was a word. Then the pad broke, the mock-blood came out, and I heard the bell. So I jumped away, spinning as my paws hit the ground so I could be ready to attack the remaining two mock-enemies.\n\nBut I didn’t have to. The vehicle rolled over so its wheels went up, and three of the four enemies fell out. Then it was still. The driver was still strapped in his seat, but his neck was bent against the ground, and he didn’t move. The three mock-enemies on the ground didn’t move either. So I ran to the two I hadn’t bitten yet, broke the skins on their throat pads, then returned to my soldier in the minefield.\n\nThe soldier was sitting up with his eyes and mouth open. But I grabbed his flak-jacket strap anyway and resumed dragging him to the medical station. Then he tried to pull away from me. But I was still under orders. So I growled, and then my soldier was still again. I delivered him to the medical station, ran back to Lieutenant Dial, and stood at attention.\n\nThe people in the bleachers began to smell unhappy. They made growling noises, and none of them clapped their hands. So for a moment I was afraid I had done something wrong. But then I knew it wasn’t so, because Lieutenant Dial touched my head and said I was good.\n\nThat was all that mattered.\n\nFrom Lieutenant Dial’s next thoughts, I knew that the driver in the utility vehicle had made a mistake. He’d been supposed to drive farther away from me after the gunner was bitten. But he had turned back toward me too soon, and I had been faster than he had thought I would be. Then, when his throat pad hadn’t broken right away, he had panicked and turned the steering wheel too sharply. So the vehicle had rolled over. But by then I had broken the throat pad and jumped away.\n\nAll four of the mock-enemies in the utility vehicle had to be taken away for real medical care, and I could hear that some of the people in the bleachers felt bad about that. But Lieutenant Dial didn’t. Instead, he became angry. He wasn’t angry with me, but I didn’t want him to be angry with anything. Being angry made him unhappy. And that made me unhappy too. Anger was like smoke with a bad smell in his head.\n\nThe K-9 demonstration was over then, and Melanie came down from the bleachers to meet us. I was glad to see her. But Lieutenant Dial was still angry. He told Melanie that the driver of the utility vehicle had done the exercise incorrectly, and that what had happened wasn’t my fault. I had done what I was supposed to do, but the mock-enemies had screwed it up.\n\nMelanie told him she already knew that, and that everyone else knew it too. She said he shouldn’t worry about what people would think of him, or of me, or of any of the K-9s, because we had all been wonderful.\n\nI didn’t always know what Melanie was saying, but that time I understood every word. And as she spoke, Lieutenant Dial’s anger drifted away. Just like smoke. And then he was happy and proud again. And so was I.\n\nI rubbed my nose against Melanie’s knee, and she touched my head. I wished I could tell her she was good.\n\nThen Lieutenant Dial, Melanie, and I walked to the edge of the water with some of the people from the bleachers, and we stood on a boardwalk while the people on the pier performed demonstrations with water animals. We had a good view even though we were about thirty meters from them. Lieutenant Dial said the animals that stayed in the water all the time were called dolphins, and the ones that hopped from the pier to the water and back again were called sea lions. One of the sea lions barked, but I couldn’t understand it.\n\nThe water animals delivered equipment to people underwater, and they also searched for mines and mock-enemies. Pictures of them doing those things appeared on the big screen. Sometimes a sea lion carried a clamp in its mouth, and when it found a mock-enemy, it swam up behind him and put the clamp on his leg. Then the mock-enemy was pulled up to the pier by a rope attached to the clamp, while the sea lion jumped from the water and got a treat from its handler. It looked like fun, and I wished I could go underwater and sneak up on the mock-enemies down there too.\n\nThen the sea lions had a contest. They were supposed to find some small dummy mines and push buttons on the mines with their noses, then attach handles and bring the mines up to the pier. It was a race to see which sea lion could bring up the most mines in two minutes. So the sea lions were swimming fast and splashing a lot, dropping the mines on the pier and grabbing new handles before plunging into the ocean again.\n\nThe dummy water mines looked like black soccer balls, and they had lights that came on if the button had been pushed. Once one of the sea lions brought up a mine that didn’t have its light on, and his handler threw the mine back into the water. Then the sea lion had to go get it again, and he had to be sure to push the button before putting it on the pier. If I had been that sea lion, I would have felt bad for not doing it right the first time. But I couldn’t tell whether he felt bad or not, because he kept on swimming for more mines. So then I was glad because he was still being a good soldier.\n\nHe didn’t win the contest, though. He came in second. At the end of two minutes, he had eleven mines, and the winner had twelve. All the people who had watched the race clapped and cheered, and the four sea lions who had raced got up on their hindquarters and barked. The people cheered even more then, and Lieutenant Dial and Melanie did too. But Lieutenant Dial didn’t clap because he had one hand on the handle of my duty harness.\n\nBoth Lieutenant Dial and Melanie were happy. So I should have been happy too.\n\nBut I wasn’t. Something was wrong.\n\nI didn’t know what it was at first, so I lifted my head high and sniffed the air. There were many smells. There was sweat, soda, and popcorn. There were buckets of little fish. The sea lions smelled salty. Melanie still smelled like flowers. The other K-9s smelled thirsty. The practice mines smelled like wet Frisbees.\n\nExcept there was another smell with the Frisbee smell. It wasn’t big. But it was there. It was a bad smell. It was a bad smell like the real mines that had been in the practice minefield during the hardest part of training. It was a bad smell like the real mine that had killed another K-9 who wasn’t careful enough.\n\nAnd as soon as I had identified that bad smell, I knew where it was coming from. The final mine that the winning sea lion had brought up wasn’t like the others. It looked like them, but it didn’t smell like them. It was different. It was bad.\n\nIt wanted to explode and kill someone.\n\nBut none of the sea lions were doing anything about it. They were still on their hindquarters, swaying back and forth, while the people clapped. One of the dolphins was splashing and chattering out in the water, so I think she might have known. But none of the handlers paid any attention to her. They were smiling at the clapping people.\n\nI was under no specific orders. But Lieutenant Dial had given me one General Order many training sessions ago: If I ever knew something was wrong, I had to act.\n\nSo I bolted for the pier, and Lieutenant Dial released my harness handle. I knew his thoughts, and he knew mine. He knew I was being good.\n\nI ran fast between people’s legs. Some of them yelled. And then I was on the pier. It moved up and down a little, but I kept on running fast even though it tried to make me fall. Two of the people in white stepped into my path, but I zigzagged around them. The pier was wet there, and my feet slipped. But I scrabbled hard like I did at the wall and kept going.\n\nOne of the sea lions came down from his haunches as I approached, and he opened his mouth as if to bite me. It was a big mouth with big teeth. The whole sea lion was as big as five of me, and he lunged at me when I came close. So I jumped over his head and kicked the back of his neck with my hind feet. That pushed me the last three meters to the end of the pier.\n\nMy front feet hit the pier right beside the bad mine, so I grabbed its handle with my teeth, whipped it forward, and let go so it flew into the water. Two of the dolphins swam away fast as the mine splashed and sank.\n\nThen I couldn’t smell the bad mine anymore, so I was glad. But when I turned around and saw the white-clothed people and their sea lions, none of them seemed glad. The people were shouting and the sea lions were barking. The sea lions’ barks still didn’t make sense.\n\nI saw Lieutenant Dial running down the pier toward me, so I started running toward him too. And just as I began to zigzag around the sea lions, I heard a rumble and a splash, and the pier rose up under me. I fell, and the pier hit my jaw and made me bite my tongue. Then the pier bounced up and down, and I couldn’t stand up because my feet kept slipping. One of the people in white had fallen down beside me, and he kept slipping too. That made me worry about Lieutenant Dial, so I looked up to see if he was all right. But a sea lion was in the way.\n\nThen I yelped. Later, a news reporter would say that I yelped because my tongue was hurt. But that wasn’t the reason. It was because I couldn’t see or hear Lieutenant Dial, and I couldn’t find his thoughts. There were too many people thinking and yelling all at once. I couldn’t even smell him because I was too close to the sea lions.\n\nThat was a bad moment. But the pier moved a little less each time it bounced, and finally I could stand up. And then I could see Lieutenant Dial. He was in the middle of the pier helping another person stand up, so I ran to him and stood at attention. When he had finished helping the other person, he looked down at me and saluted. And he told me I was good. He told me I was more good than I had ever been before.\n\nAnd the bad moment was gone.\n\nLater, investigators said that a real enemy had replaced one of the sea lions’ dummy mines with a live one, intending to hurt or kill as many people and animals as possible. But because I threw it back into the water, only one dolphin was hurt. And no one was killed.\n\nA few weeks later, Lieutenant Dial was promoted to Captain, and I was promoted to Sergeant. Captain Dial received silver bars for his uniform, and then he leaned over and showed me a new metal tag before clipping it to the ring in my collar. It was shaped like the insignia for Sergeant First Class. I knew I couldn’t wear it on combat duty, because it would get in the way and make noise. But it was still a fine thing, because that was how it looked in Captain Dial’s thoughts.\n\nOther soldiers were promoted during that ceremony as well, but I was the only K-9. Also, Captain Dial and I were commended for finding the live mine. We were called heroes.\n\nMelanie was there for the ceremony, and both she and Captain Dial were proud and happy. So I was proud and happy too.\n\nBut I still wasn’t as happy as I had been on the pier. That was where I had been more good than I had ever been before. Captain Dial had said so.\n\nThat was how I knew it was true.\n\nSoon after our promotions, Captain Dial and I left the fort with many other soldiers, and we all went to the war. Melanie came to the fort to say good-bye to us.\n\nShe and Captain Dial hugged each other for a long time while I stood at ease. Most of the other soldiers were hugging people too. There were wives and children, and even a few dogs who weren’t soldiers.\n\nThen Melanie knelt down and put her head against mine. It surprised me. She had never done anything like that before. I think she was trying to help me understand her thoughts the way I understood Captain Dial’s. It helped a little. But even if she hadn’t done it, I would have known she was telling me the same thing she had told me every morning before training. She was telling me to take care of Captain Dial.\n\nSo I kissed her face. I wanted her to be glad that Captain Dial and I were going to the war together. Her face tasted like ocean water.\n\nThen Melanie took her head away from mine and put her arms around Captain Dial again. After a while, Captain Dial pulled away from her and gave me the signal to proceed. We left Melanie and went to the D Company bus.\n\nWhen all the soldiers of D Company had boarded the bus, it took us to the air transport. Captain Dial was quiet during the bus ride. He just looked out the window. And for the first time, his thoughts weren’t clear to me. It was as if they were far away in a fog, and a fuzzy sound ran through them. I glimpsed Melanie, but that was all. Captain Dial kept his hand on my neck, though, and every now and then his fingers rubbed behind my ears. So I didn’t worry. Captain Dial always had some thoughts that I couldn’t understand anyway. The only ones I really needed to know were the ones that were orders.\n\nThe air transport took a long time, and it was loud. I didn’t like it. By the time it stopped at an island to refuel, all my muscles were sore. But I felt better after marking some trees near the airstrip, and better still after some food. We got back on the transport then, and Captain Dial gave me a pill to help me sleep through the rest of the flight. It helped a lot. But I was still glad when we were on the ground again. When we finally left the transport we were in a place that was dry and sunny, and all of the smells were sharp.\n\nThe soldiers of D Company spent one night in a tinroofed barracks at the combat zone airfield, and Captain Dial and I slept there with them. There was no kennel or cushion for me, so I slept on a blanket beside Captain Dial’s cot. I was the only K-9 in the company, and some of the other soldiers were nervous around me. But Captain Dial made sure that I met each one and learned that soldier’s smell. Captain Dial wanted to keep them all safe. So I wanted to keep them safe too.\n\nI could see some soldiers’ thoughts, although none of them were as clear to me as Captain Dial’s. But that was all right, because the soldiers’ voices and smells told me all I needed to know about them. Most of them were friendly, although several stayed nervous even after they met me. And a few smelled frightened or angry.\n\nOne of the angry ones was an officer, Lieutenant Morris, who was in charge of First Platoon. I couldn’t see his thoughts at all, but I still knew he didn’t like me. I knew he didn’t like Captain Dial, either. When he stood before us, his sweat smelled bitter, and his voice was low. And even when he saluted, his muscles were tense as if he were about to run or fight.\n\nCaptain Dial was aware of all this, because he knew my thoughts. But unlike me, he was able to think of a reason for Lieutenant Morris’s attitude. He thought Lieutenant Morris believed he should have been promoted to Captain and given command of D Company.\n\nThis troubled Captain Dial, because he had never wanted to lead a company of regular soldiers anyway. But I was the only one who knew it. What he really wanted to do was serve in a K-9 unit. But when we were promoted, he was ordered to command D Company because its original captain had died in training. So he requested that I be allowed to join the company with him, and we were both happy when his request was granted. We joined D Company on the same day we went to the war. And I knew that all of the soldiers in D Company were lucky to have Captain Dial as their leader.\n\nThe morning after our arrival in the combat zone, D Company was assigned to guard four checkpoints on highways that led to the airfield. So Captain Dial put a platoon at each checkpoint, splitting the soldiers among three separate road barriers per checkpoint. He told the lieutenants and sergeants to stop and inspect each vehicle at each barrier, and to detain the occupants of any vehicle found to contain contraband. He also told them to have their soldiers fire warning shots over any vehicles that passed the first barrier without stopping for inspection. They were to aim at the tires and engines of any vehicles that also passed the second barrier without stopping. And any vehicles that passed the third barrier without stopping were"
