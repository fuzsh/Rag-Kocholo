The Architecture of Fear

(1987)

An anthology of stories edited by Kathryn Cramer and Peter D Pautz

Publisher's Weekly

Setting is important in fiction, and perhaps never more so than in the horror genre. This anthology of 14 original stories proves the case. The quality of the selections varies, but there are some wonderful tales here. Particularly impressive are Gene Wolfe's play on fairy-tale themes, ''In the House of Gingerbread''; Ramsey Campbell's sad and sinister ''Where the Heart Is,'' about a widower who cannot bring himself to leave his home and memories; ''Visitors'' by Jack Dann, in which a boy becomes conscious of the dead souls inhabiting the hospital in which he lies dying; and Michael Bishop's sweet, surreal ''In the Memory Room,'' where a corpse wistfully reminisces as she is being made up by a funeral parlor cosmetician. Also particularly good are the stories by Joyce Carol Oates, Robert Aickman and Scott Baker.

Library Journal

Containing 11 original stories and three reprints, this horror theme anthology concerns itself with haunted houses and haunted minds. Superior stories, including Robert Aickman's ''The Fetch'' and Joyce Carol Oates's ''Haunted,'' range in style from literary mainstream to ''slasher'' film graphic, but are well written and ultimately convincing in the worlds they create. The anthology has a strong psychological bent, and several of the other stories lack the necessary depth to rise above merely illustrating some psychological tenet. Still, recommended for academic and larger public libraries. James B. Hemesath, Adams State Coll. Lib., Alamosa, Colo.
