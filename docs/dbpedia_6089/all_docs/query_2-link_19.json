        "text": "18th Century England is ruled by King George III (Eric Pohlmann) and he isn't particularly generous on the taxation front. In the South Coast town of Dymchurch, the local vicar, Dr Christopher Syn (Patrick McGoohan), isn't just a man of the cloth, by night he is the notorious smuggler \"The Scarecrow\". He's not a bad lad, he's more Robin Hood than anything else and the locals have come to rely on him for provisions. The King deploys his army to capture \"The Scarecrow\", however he has a few tricks up his sleeve to evade them.\n\nFaffing around on YouTube I found a clip from this and was impressed, for 1963, how disturbing the character looks under the stitched up mask.…\n\nAs a fan of Russell Thorndyke's original novel, and finding myself on holiday one time in the Romney Marsh of Kent (where it's set), I took my young daughter on a tiny little train from Romney to the seaside town of Dymchurch, where the (fictional) Reverend Doctor Syn preached his sermons and smuggled his rum. I had already seen and loved the Hammer version of the story, Captain Clegg, but eating fish and chips with my little one at one of the local pubs, I noticed a bunch of photos of this Disney version on the wall. And I knew I just had to track this down.\n\nThis movie takes some pretty significant liberties with the source material, completely eliminating…\n\nDisney's adaptation of the Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike is something I remember fondly from my childhood when I rented the video out a couple of times. Back then I remember being a little bit frightened of Syn's Scarecrow mask alter-ego (complete with Patrick McGoohan's darting eyes and mad cackle!) and it felt sort of strange to be frightened by a good guy. Of course, this trick was later adapted by Batman. Watching it again now on YouTube for the first time in many years, I'm struck by the fact that it is indeed quite dark for a Disney film...and the bird mask that his young assistant wears is just as unsettling!\n\nIt's a shame that Disney prevented Hammer's…\n\nI don't recollect exactly where or when I first watched this as a child, but it left a pretty big impression on my malleable young melon and was my first introduction to the power, majesty, and righteousness that is Himself.\n\nMcGoohan, with his creepy mask and scary laugh, plays the eponymous Scarecrow with real menace and a sense of danger. The plot is pretty serious stuff as well. At one point, the Scarecrow metes out some heavy vigilante justice by hanging a snitch, but since this is Disney, the rat is cut down and revived at the last minute, so the young 'uns wouldn't have *too* many nightmares and bedwetting incidents. Thanks, Uncle Walt!\n\nWrap all that goodness up in…\n\nScarecrow of Romney Marsh is a very pretty picture, with a masterful central performance from Patrick McGoohan. He was a tremendously unique actor, with a wonderful intensity/vibrancy he brings to the role of Doctor Syn... alias the Scarecrow.\n\nThe plot, and outlying characters, and, hell, just about everything in this miniseries is just average adventure stuff, though well executed. What really elevates this is the character of the Scarecrow.\n\nThe figure taps into the subconscious, something mysterious and supernatural, much like the Batman. A fighter for justice, but hard edged and, ultimately, as portrayed in the film, a unknowable mystery. Other adaptations get more into the nitty gritty of Syn's backstory, but by not doing so here, we constantly wonder…\n\nIf you're searching for the mysterious figure haunting Romney Marsh, and smuggling goods from the continent to bypass the HMRC, you might want to start with the guy who seems to have a touch of the old nominative determinism, Dr. Syn. Yes, he is the local vicar, but the Church of England doesn't exactly have a clean record when it comes to harbouring unsavoury characters.\n\nThe other thing, of course, and this is covered off very early on, is that despite the fact that he and his gang are unquestionably breaking the law, they are framed not as criminals, but as men fighting the injustice of having to pay tax on brandy and silk, which presumably then has to be…"
