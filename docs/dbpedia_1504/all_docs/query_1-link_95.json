        "text": "Our team need to get tougher collectively and individually. I”ve always thought the aggressor wins . . . and we pretty much got punched in the mouth and we didn’t do a very good job of responding. – Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — This was supposed to be the year the Utah basketball team finally won a preseason basketball tournament.\n\nAs documented in a Deseret News story earlier in the week, the Utes have never won an eight-team bracketed early-season tournament in 20 previous tries over the years.\n\nMake that 21.\n\nEven though the Utes came in as the highest-ranked team in the Puerto Rico Tip-Off Tournament, they had no answers for the unranked Miami Hurricanes, who crushed the Utes 90-66 Friday night at Roberto Clemente Coliseum.\n\nThe No. 16-ranked Utes fell behind 7-0 before the game was two minutes old and trailed by double digits throughout the night. Poor defense, sloppy ball-handling and a lack of firepower from the guard line doomed the Utes in their first defeat of the season.\n\nJordan Loveridge and Jakob Poeltl were the Utes’ two best players as they have been all season, scoring 18 and 16 points, respectively, while Lorenzo Bonam scored nine points and Isaiah Wright added eight points off the bench.\n\nAfter a day off Saturday, the Utes will come back Sunday and face Temple for the first time in the two schools’ history, at 2:30 p.m. MT in the third-place game on ESPNU-TV. After that, Miami will play No. 21 Butler in the championship game, which the Utes were hoping to play in.\n\nHowever, the Utes didn't come close to qualifying for Sunday's finals. Friday’s defeat was such a bad loss, the worst since a 71-39 drubbing to Arizona in the 2014 Pac-12 Tournament, that Krystkowiak wouldn’t allow any of his players to be interviewed after the game, perhaps the first time he’s done that since being coach at Utah.\n\nHowever, Krystkowiak had plenty of things to say about his team’s poor performance afterward.\n\nOn his team’s toughness: “Our team need to get tougher collectively and individually,’’ he said. “I”ve always thought the aggressor wins . . . and we pretty much got punched in the mouth and we didn’t do a very good job of responding.’’\n\nOn his team’s sloppiness: “Any time you (allow your opponent) to score 23 points off your turnovers, it’s impossible to defend. I don’t know if I’ve ever heard of that many points off turnovers.’’\n\nOn his team’s lack of rebounding: “I looks at the stat sheet at halftime and . . . we had one rebound among all of our big guys.’’\n\nWhile Krystkowiak talked about his team’s own deficiencies, he also praised Hurricanes, who deserved it because of the way they played. They didn’t look like a team picked for fifth in the ACC, with an experienced team of four seniors and a junior who has started much of his career.\n\nA night after beating Mississippi State 105-79 on 57 percent shooting, Miami shot 53.4 percent from the field and 52.9 percent from 3-point range, while outrebounding the Utes 34-25. The Hurricanes also had just seven turnovers compared to 16 for Utah.\n\n“Our guys played extremely hard and extremely well,’’ said Miami coach Jim Larranaga. “They share the ball and play together well.’’\n\nGuard Sheldon McClellan led all scorers with 27 points on 10-of-12 shooting while 7-foot center Tonye Jekiri scored a career-high 20 points and pulled down 12 rebounds. Angel Rodriguez, a Puerto Rico native and crowd favorite, scored 11 points and led Miami with four assists.\n\nAfter the poor start, the Utes made a couple of runs in the game, pulling within seven with 1:25 left in the first half at 39-32, only to see the ‘Canes close with seven straight points to go up 46-32 at halftime.\n\nThen in the second half they got within 10 at 62-52 on a Loveridge 3-pointer with 9:34 left. But Miami went on a 15-5 run over the next four minutes to stretch the lead to 20 and led by as many as 27 before Wright’s late 3-pointer.\n\nAs disappointed as he was with the loss Friday, Krystkowiak did keep his sense of humor. When asked if his players would have any fun Saturday on their day off, he said, “I think I’m going to tie them all up in the hotel . . . and starve ‘em. Punish the animals,\" before adding, “We’ll figure something out.’’"
