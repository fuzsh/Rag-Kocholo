Percy was born at his home at Red Hills Ranch near Encino, New Mexico and was a proud Veteran of the United States Army.\n\nHe was a teacher and principle at Del Norte High School for 33 years where he bled turquoise and black in his many years of devotion to his students and his staff that he considered his “Knight Family”. He was a member of the New Mexico Angus Association where he spread his passion as a rancher and raising cattle and wore his boots and cowboy hat as the REAL Cowboy he was. He was larger than life in his compassion for his family. He was a loyal husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend. He was very proud of his large loving family and will always be remembered for his unselfish dedication to his family and his cherished grandchildren. He is survived by his wife Ann of 52 years, his daughter, Melissa Melfi and husband Frank, Mark Larranaga and wife Jan, daughter Joetta Teupell and husband Trey.
