        "text": "All Business\n\nBy his own admission, Adam Hess wasn't thinking about much more than basketball when deciding on where he wanted to play his college basketball. But when the time came to transfer, Hess wanted to enroll at a school where he could pursue a career in the business world.\n\nIt's only fitting because the senior at William & Mary is all business on the basketball court.\n\nHis career began at Eastern Michigan, But Hess moved after one season from the mid-American Conference to the Colonial Athletic Association. For the academic standout, Ivy League schools were an option, but Hess wanted to play big-time college basketball and the lure of William & Mary was much to his liking.\n\n'There is a great bond among all the athletes here at William & Mary,\" says Hess. \"We all seem to know one another, and we all pull for each other. I really like that.\"\n\nAnd everyone who follows the Tribe really likes the fact that Hess chose Williamsburg, VA., as his basketball home. In each of his first two seasons at W&M, Hess has improved his game by leaps and bounds.\n\nInitially tabbed as a good shooter, Hess has worked hard on all aspects of his game to the point that he is a more complete player now.\n\n\"I heard that he was an excellent shooter and a great scorer,\" says head coach Tony Shaver, \"but he's impressed me with his all-around play, and when your best player is your hardest worker, you have something special.\"\n\nAnd the Michigan native is a special player in every way.\n\nHess has become a poster boy for what college athletics is truly all about. He has excelled in the classroom as well as the court, last season earning academic All-American honors.\n\nHess views it as a simple matter of applying one's self.\n\n\"I have never understood why people want to put all their eggs in one basket,\" says Hess. \"I grew up in the suburbs, where we were told that we couldn't excel in athletics so we should focus on academics. I never understood that. I have always believed that if you work hard enough at both, you can succeed at both.\"\n\nHess is a coach's dream. H attacks the books like he attacks the basket and is humble and hungry to continue to learn.\n\nIn his two plus years at W&M, Hess has worked hard to become much more than just a spot-up shooter. He has developed into a better rebounded and a better passer and he has improved in virtually every statistical category.\n\nBut the preseason CAA player of they year is more than just a great player in his own league.\n\n\"He is the best mind-major player in American,\" says Radford head coach Byron Samuels. \"Forget about the statistics. He does so many things well, and he makes everyone around him better. If you had five Adam Hesses you would win a lot of basketball games.\n\nThere is no question that Hess's game has benefited from the more up-tempo style employed by Shaver, his first-year coach. As Shaver points out, \"He's a marked man who is harder to find when we are in a transition game.\"\n\nComing into the season, Shaver wanted Hess to improve defensively and, as you would expect, Hess has worked hard to improve his footwork and add yet another facet to his game.\n\nNow it's hard to find a true weakness in his game.\n\nIf you are looking for a flashy, above the tin-type player, Hess is probably not going to wow you, but if you really appreciate the game the way it's supposed to be played, then you will love watching him play.\n\nHe's not one to do a lot of hollering or use body language to motivate his teammates. Instead, he leads by example.\n\n\"I always wondered why I would you need to scream at someone to motivate them,\" says Hess. \"I don't need that to motivate me.\"\n\nTalk about a coach's dream.\n\n\"He really is a great kid,\" says Shaver. \"There is really nothing not to like about Adam.\"\n\nThere are a lot of really good kids playing college basketball, but you would be hard-pressed to find one that is better than Adam Hess.\n\nAngela Lento is an editorial representative for Basketball Times.
