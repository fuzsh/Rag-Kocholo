        "text": "Jim Boeheim won't coach at Syracuse beyond the next three years. But so long as he does, he will remain at the top of the annual college basketball coaching tenure list.\n\nPlenty has changed since this exercise last year, but Boeheim's presence at No. 1 has not. Also the same: Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski's place at No. 2; both have been on the job for more than 35 years.\n\nIn fact, Boeheim and Krzyzewski have piled up a combined 74 seasons at the current jobs, as many as the bottom 97 coaches (out of 351) on the list have totaled in their gigs combined.\n\nWith the last of the head coaching openings filled last week (Louisiana Tech's Eric Konkol checks in at No. 351), it seemed an appropriate time to revise the list and update a few tidbits (while adding a few others).\n\nOnly 52 Division I coaches have been on the job for 10 years or more, though that number can leap to 55 by the start of next season.\n\nOnly 10 Division I coaches have been on the job for 20 years or more, though two others (Michigan State's Tom Izzo and Saint Joseph's Phil Martelli) will celebrate their 20th anniversary in their current positions this summer.\n\nThe median hire date is now May 9, 2011, which is when Maryland selected Mark Turgeon to replace the retired Gary Williams. That date is only 47 days later than last year around this time.\n\nThe ACC has seven of the 34 longest-tenured coaches in Division I (Boeheim, Krzyzewski, No. 21 Mike Brey, No. 22 Rick Pitino, No. 29 Leonard Hamilton, No. 33 Roy Williams and No. 34 Jamie Dixon). The other four power conferences have a combined four in the top 34 (No. 11 Tom Izzo, No. 17 Kevin Stallings, No. 24 Bo Ryan and No. 30 Lorenzo Romar).\n\nSeven leagues currently do not have a coach in the top 50 in tenure (American, Big Sky, Metro Atlantic, Missouri Valley, Southwestern Athletic, Sun Belt, Western Athletic).\n\nThe conference whose longest-tenured coach has been on the job the least amount of time is the WAC; New Mexico State's Marvin Menzies is No. 83 on the list. He was hired just shy of eight years ago.\n\nOf the the 68 teams in the 2015 NCAA tournament, nearly half (32) were led by coaches now in the top 100 of the revised tenure list (two of those, Indiana's Tom Crean and Oklahoma State's Travis Ford, began last season outside the top 100.\n\nOn a bit of a tangent, three of last year's first-year coaches got fired (Bowling Green's Chris Jans, Kennesaw State's Jimmy Lallathin and Tennessee's Donnie Tyndall), while two of them made the NCAA tournament (Butler's Chris Holtmann and North Dakota State's David Richman.\n\nOf the 32 Division I conferences, 11 (or roughly a third) did not have a coaching change (yet) this season. Only one league (the Northeast) has not seen a coaching switch in the last two offseasons.\n\nThe rundown from No. 1 to No. 351, a list that is still bound to change a few times before the 2015-16 season begins in November.\n\n1976\n\n1.
