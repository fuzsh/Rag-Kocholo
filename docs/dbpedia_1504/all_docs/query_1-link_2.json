        "text": "Chairman was a Dear Friend\n\nIt is with extreme sadness that I learned of the passing of New Mexico State Representative Lorenzo \"Larry\" LarraÃ±aga. Representative LarraÃ±aga was a dear friend, tireless advocate for all New Mexicans and humble public servant. His contributions to our state are too numerous to name and not done for his own recognition, but for the greater good of the citizens he served. Larry was a model for all of us who strive to improve our state to emulate. He was integral in creating the New Mexico Bioscience Authority, funding several key initiatives at the Health Sciences Center and supporting our mission to serve all New Mexicans with the highest quality healthcare available.\n\nI consider myself fortunate to have been able to call him my friend. I have reached out to Charletta and his family to let them know that we are thinking of them during this extremely difficult time. I ask all of us to spend some time reflecting on his legacy and continuing his good work in each of our respective missions.\n\n- Dr. Paul B. Roth, Chancellor of the Health Sciences Center"
