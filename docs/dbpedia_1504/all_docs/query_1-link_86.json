        "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, who stepped down from daily duties last summer as he battled Alzheimer’s disease, has been selected for the team’s ring of fame that he created in 1984.\n\nTeam president and CEO Joe Ellis said he visited Bowlen with the news Wednesday.\n\nBowlen is the only owner in NFL history to win 300 games, counting playoffs, in a 30-year span.\n\nBowlen will be honored before the Broncos’ Sunday night game against Green Bay on Nov. 1.\n\nEllis said he hopes the next move is for Bowlen to be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a contributor like 2015 inductees Ron Wolf and Bill Polian.\n\nLincoln – Nebraska basketball’s non-conference schedule for next season received a boost Wednesday afternoon, as the Big Ten and ESPN announced that the Huskers will take on Miami in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge. The matchup is slated for Tuesday, Dec. 1, at Pinnacle Bank Arena. Tipoff time and television information will be announced at a later date.\n\nESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU will combine to televise all 14 games of the three-day event matching top college basketball programs playing for conference supremacy and the Commissioners Cup. All 14 games will also be available via WatchESPN.\n\nThe Hurricanes went 25-13 during the 2014-15 season in overtime and lost in the championship game of the NIT Tournament. Jim Larrañaga’s Hurricanes, who finished sixth in the ACC last season, return their top four scorers, including senior guard Sheldon McClellan, who averaged 14.5 points per game as a junior. Senior point guard Angel Rodriguez (11.9 ppg, 3.9 apg and 1.8 spg) and senior center Tonye Jekiri (8.6 ppg, 9.9 rpg and 1.4 bpg) also are back for the Hurricanes. Miami posted road wins at NCAA champion Duke and Florida in 2014-15 and were ranked as high as 15th nationally at one point during last season.\n\nThis will be the second time that the Huskers and Hurricanes have faced off the Big Ten/ACC Challenge. In 2013, Nebraska posted a 60-49 victory over Miami, also at Pinnacle Bank Arena. The Huskers are 4-1 all-time against Miami dating back to the 1951-52 season.\n\nThe Huskers have played well in the Big Ten/ACC Challenge under Tim Miles, going 3-0 in that stretch, including a road win over Florida State last season. Nebraska’s .750 winning percentage in the event is the best of any Big Ten school, as NU has gone 3-1 since joining the Big Ten.\n\nThe Huskers return two starters in 2015-16, including senior forward Shavon Shields, who leads NU’s returnees in scoring (15.4 ppg), rebounding (6.0 rpg) and assists (2.2 apg). The Huskers also welcome a nationally ranked recruiting class which includes freshmen Ed Morrow Jr. and Glynn Watson Jr., both of whom are ranked in the top-75 nationally by ESPN.com. In addition, the Huskers also gain the services of guard Andrew White III, who sat out last season after transferring from Kansas.\n\nThe Big Ten retained the Commissioner’s Cup, given to the champion of the Big Ten/ACC Challenge, following an 8-6 victory last season. The Big Ten trails in the all-time series, 10-4-2, but is 4-0-2 in the last six years of the event.\n\nWednesday’s announcement is the second one for the 2015-16 season, as the Huskers will travel to Big East champion Villanova in the Gavitt Tipoff Games on Tuesday, Nov. 17.\n\n2015 Knights Basketball Camp Registration Form\n\nThe objective of the Knights Basketball Camp is to provide campers the opportunity to improve their fundamental skills and develop their understanding of the great game of basketball. It is our goal to teach basketball and offer the finest basketball camp experience around. The camp will stress fundamental skills such as shooting, passing, ball handling, rebounding, individual offensive and defensive skills each day. Most importantly, we will focus on attitude development. We look forward to seeing you at camp this summer!\n\nCAMP STAFF\n\nIn addition to members of the Knight’s Basketball staff, members of the North Platte Community College basketball team will serve as assistants and leaders in daily camp activities and drills. We offer an outstanding play/coach ratio and feature a veteran camp staff.\n\nCAMP FORMAT\n\nThe basketball camp will run for 3 hours a day. There will be instruction of basic basketball fundamentals: shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, foot-work, defense, and team ploy. In addition, we will add to the camper’s knowledge of the game through lectures, films, and demonstrations. League play and contest are also part of the basket ball experience.\n\nCAMP DIVISIONS\n\nFor boys currently in grades 2 through 9, this camp consists of a morning and afternoon session each day. Campers currently in grades 2 through 5 are grouped in the morning session, which is from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, and junior high campers currently in grades 6 through 9 are grouped in afternoon sessions from 1:00 to 4:00 pm. There are no evening sessions and no overnight lodging is provided. The camp includes a good mix of fundamentals, drills, games, contests, and FUN! The focus of this camp is on total player development in a highly spirited environment.\n\nFinal Girls Results\n\nFinal Boys Results\n\n2015 State Qualifiers – North Platte HS\n\nGIRLS\n\nRachel Kosmacek – Pole Vault – 3rd place\n\nHope Wilke – Shot Put – 2nd place\n\nTierney McPike – High Jump – 4th place\n\nHope Wilke – Discus – 2nd place\n\n4 x 100 Relay (Kathy Mathieu, Madison Raska, Hannah Hays, Kaitlynn Harvey) – 2nd place\n\nBOYS\n\nTrevor Lee – Discus – 2nd place\n\nKylan Rhodes – Pole Vault – 1st place\n\nTrevon Weaver – 100 meters – 2nd place\n\nTyler Aden – 110 Hurdles – 4th place\n\nTyler Aden – 300 Hurdles – 4th place\n\n4 x 100 Relay (Shay Bamesberger, Miles Creel, Jacob Zimbelman, Trevon Weaver) – 1st place – 42.83 NEW SCHOOL RECORD\n\nAdditional District Placers (Non-Qualifiers for State)\n\nGIRLS\n\nKaitlynn Harvey – Long Jump – 5th place\n\nBOYS\n\nTrevon Weaver – Long Jump – 6th place\n\nJacob Harvey – Pole Vault – 5th place\n\nBranden Hansen – Pole Vault – 6th place\n\nChase Lenz – High Jump – 5th place\n\nTrevon Weaver – 2oo meters – 4th place\n\n4 x 800 Relay (Miles Creel, Tanner Haws, Isaac Banuelos, Adam Sanchez) – 6th place\n\nQualifying for the NSAA State Track and Field Meet\n\n– There will be four Class A district meets.\n\n– The winners of the first three places in each individual event will qualify for the state meet, plus the next 4 fastest times of the non-qualifiers, regardless of place in a finals event. There shall be a maximum of 16 qualifiers. If there is a tie for the last qualifying spot, none of those tied shall qualify.\n\n– The winners of first, second and third places in the relay events qualify for the state meet, plus the next 4 fastest times of the non-qualifiers, regardless of place in a finals event, with a maximum of 16 relay teams qualifying. If there is a tie for the last qualifying spot, none of those tied shall qualify.\n\n– In field events, the first four places shall qualify for the state meet.\n\n– Athletes placing first, second, third or fourth must have cleared 9′ 6” or higher to qualify in the boys’ pole vault and 6’ 6” or higher in the girls’ pole vault.\n\n– Regardless of place would mean that in running events at district meets, any athlete or relay team who finished 4th -7 th place in their district meet could qualify for the state track meet if their time was one of the four fastest times of non-qualifiers from all districts submitted. It would not matter what place in their respective district they finished, but that the time was one of the four fastest of the non-qualifiers.\n\n– In the event the FAT timing system would fail in any district in any running event, that event would revert back to the original method of qualifying the top four in each district for the state track meet in that.\n\nDefending Division I men’s college basketball national champion Duke as well as 2015 Final Four participants Wisconsin and Michigan State are among the teams in this season’s 17th annual Big Ten/ACC Challenge from November 30 to December 2.\n\nESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNU will combine to televise all 14 games of the event matching top college basketball programs playing for conference supremacy and the Commissioner’s Cup. All 14 games will also be available via WatchESPN.\n\nOverall, the Challenge includes:\n\nEarly attention: Nine programs ranked in an ESPN.com early preseason top 25 poll, highlighted by four of the top seven: No. 2 North Carolina, No. 4 Maryland, No. 5 Virginia, No. 7 Duke, No. 12 Michigan State, No. 13 Notre Dame, No. 14 Indiana, No. 21 Louisville and No. 25 Wisconsin. Three of the games will pit teams in the early rankings against each other: No. 4 Maryland at No. 2 North Carolina, No. 14 Indiana at No. 7 Duke and No. 21 Louisville at No. 12 Michigan State.\n\nRecent Success: Thirteen teams that played in the 2015 NCAA Tournament: Duke, Louisville, NC State, North Carolina, Notre Dame and Virginia from the ACC, and Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan State, Ohio State, Purdue and Wisconsin from the Big Ten.\n\n2015 Big Ten/ACC Challenge schedule (times and networks will be announced at a later date):\n\nDate Game Mon, Nov 30 Clemson at Minnesota Wake Forest at Rutgers Tue, Dec 1 No. 4 Maryland at No. 2 North Carolina No. 5 Virginia at Ohio State Michigan at NC State Purdue at Pittsburgh Northwestern at Virginia Tech Miami (Fla.) at Nebraska Wed, Dec 2 No. 14 Indiana at No. 7 Duke No. 21 Louisville at No. 12 Michigan State No. 13 Notre Dame at Illinois No. 25 Wisconsin at Syracuse Florida State at Iowa Penn State at Boston College\n\nFirst Challenge Matchups: Eight of the 14 games will mark first-time Challenge matchups: Maryland at North Carolina, Wisconsin at Syracuse, Purdue at Pittsburgh, Louisville at Michigan State, Virginia at Ohio State, Notre Dame at Illinois, Wake Forest at Rutgers and Northwestern at Virginia Tech. Highlights:\n\nLouisville has won five of their nine games against Michigan State, but lost to the Spartans 76-70 in last year’s Elite Eight.\n\nThis season’s Illinois and Notre Dame matchup will mark the 40th meeting between the programs ever, but the first since 2003. Illinois leads the series 26-13.\n\nIn addition to first-time Challenge games, several of the teams are infrequent opponents: Syracuse has won two of its three ever matchups against Wisconsin, including a 64-63 Sweet Sixteen victory in the 2012 NCAA Tournament; Ohio State and Virginia will meet for the fifth time ever and the first since 1981, which also marked the only time the Cavaliers beat the Buckeyes; and Purdue has won six of the 10 games against Pittsburgh, including the last meeting in 1977.\n\nIn addition to meeting in the Challenge for the first time, Wake Forest at Rutgers and Northwestern at Virginia Tech will also be the first game between the programs ever.\n\nRubber Match: Boston College and Penn State will square off in the Challenge for the third time with each winning one game, both as the road team (Penn State in 2011 and Boston College in 2012).\n\nThe Big Ten captured the Commissioner’s Cup last season, winning eight of the 14 matchups. The two conferences split the previous two events, winning six Challenge games each in 2012 and 2013. The ACC won the first 10 Challenges (1999-2008) while the Big Ten won the next three (2009-2011). In the event of a tie, the Commissioner’s Cup remains with the conference that won the previous year.\n\nKEARNEY, Neb. – The 2014-15 season will go down as one of the best in the 15-year history of the Tri-City Storm. After finishing the regular season with an overall mark of 37-17-6 and 80 points, the Storm qualified for the Clark Cup Playoffs as the second seed in the USHL’s Western Conference.\n\nTri-City finished just one point behind the first-place Sioux City Musketeers in the standings, and swept the third-seeded Omaha Lancers in the opening round of the postseason three games to none.\n\nIn its first Western Conference Final appearance since 2005, the Storm were defeated by the Sioux Falls Stampede three games to one.\n\nHead coach Jim Hulton’s first full season behind the bench had plenty of highlights, including the team’s first postseason victory since 2007. Hulton made several in-season trades to bolster the roster including deals for goaltender Jared Rutledge, defenseman Vince Pedrie and forward Christopher Brown.\n\nBut Hulton’s roster also included 11 players from the 2013-14 squad that finished in seventh place in the west with a 21-35-4 record.\n\nForward Chris Wilkie led the way offensively all season for Tri-City, tying a team record with 35 regular season goals. The Omaha native was also tied for the USHL goal scoring lead.\n\nIn addition, Wilkie led the USHL in power play goals with 17, and shots on net, finishing his 59 game season with an even 300 SOG. Both of those totals broke individual Storm records.\n\nHeaded to play collegiately at the University of North Dakota next season, Wilkie finished fourth all-time in Storm history with 52 total goals over two seasons, and ninth all-time with 91 total points.\n\nAnother name that was cemented in the team record book this season was that of defenseman Bobby Nardella. Coming to Tri-City as a player to be named later in one of Hulton’s first trades during the 2013-14 season, Nardella had an outstanding offensive season on the blue line, scoring 10 goals and 32 assists.\n\nNardella’s 42 points was third-best among USHL defenseman, while his 22 power play assists was first among blue liners and third-best among all skaters.\n\nThe Notre Dame commit broke single season Storm records for most assists by a defenseman (32), most points by a defenseman (42) and tied Storm alum Jaden Schwartz for most power play assists (22). Nardella also finished 19th all-time among Storm skaters with a +15 rating.\n\nAlec Dillon led the way in net in his first USHL season. The Los Angeles Kings draft pick played in 41 games and had a 23-11-4 record with three shutouts.\n\nThe goaltender also led the USHL in goals against average, with a mark of 2.27, and finished fourth in the league with a .914 save percentage.\n\nThe team’s captain Garrett Gamez had another outstanding season, finishing second on the roster with 44 points on 15 goals and 29 assists, while playing just 44 games due to injuries. Playing in all situations, Gamez had 10 power play goals and six man-advantage assists and also logged time on the penalty kill.\n\nGamez will head to Providence College this fall in the top 10 all-time in Storm history in three categories after three full seasons with the team. The forward is third all-time in assists with 67, fifth best with 96 total points and tenth with 147 games played.\n\nOther players who have entered the team record books include assistant captain Kyle Eastman, who is 13th all-time in both games played (147) and penalty minutes (163) after three seasons, and Jalen Schulz, who is fifth all-time with 231 penalty minutes after two seasons.\n\nIn his first season in Kearney, forward Nick Master was second on the team with 23 goals, and led the squad with a +20 rating that is 11th best in Storm history. Master plans to play for UMass-Lowell in the Hockey East next season.\n\nTri-City tied the team record for longest winning streak, set in March of 2004, winning 10 consecutive games between Jan. 9 and Feb. 7. The Storm earned wins over Waterloo, Bloomington, Omaha, Sioux Falls and Lincoln during the stretch.\n\nSix of the 10 victories came in Kearney at the Viaero Event Center. The line of Gamez, Master and Matthew Freytag scored a combined total of 35 points during the streak, with Master accounting for 13 on six goals and seven assists.\n\nAs a team, Tri-City finished the regular season No. 1 in defense, only allowing 158 total goals for an average of just 2.63 per game. The Storm were also second-best in the league on the power play, scoring 25.1% of the time with the man-advantage.\n\n14 members of the roster have commitments to play Division I college hockey next season.\n\nTri-City is now preparing for the team’s annual tryout camp, which will be held in Las Vegas June 15-21."
