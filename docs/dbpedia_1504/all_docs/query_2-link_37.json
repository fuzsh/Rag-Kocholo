        "text": "It was October 2010 and Jim Larranaga was disappointed.\n\nHe and his George Mason staff had lost a fierce recruiting battle to DePaul for Shane Larkin, a speedy point guard from Orlando.\n\nThe chain of events that transpired shortly after changed University of Miami basketball forever. Larranaga left George Mason for UM in April 2011, and Larkin, citing a medical condition, transferred there four months later.\n\nOn Thursday night, Larkin’s decision will ultimately pay off. The All-American who led Miami to its first ACC championship is expected to be selected in the first round of the NBA draft, which could see several state players hear their names called.\n\n“I think about it all the time,” Larranaga said of Larkin’s transfer during a CBS Radio appearance on Monday. “It worked out great for him and for us.”\n\nLarkin and former teammate Kenny Kadji can make another historic mark on the Hurricanes’ program if they’re both drafted.\n\nMiami hasn’t had two players picked in the NBA draft since Wayne Canady and Don Curnutt were chosen in 1970, and it’s never had two players drafted in the first two rounds. The NBA went to a two-round draft format in 1989.\n\nKadji, who worked out with 13 teams, started the draft process in April without much buzz, but draft experts now project him as a likely second-round choice.\n\nFlorida’s Erik Murphy is the only other in-state college player likely to selected Thursday. The 6-foot-10, 240-pounder with good shooting skills is projected to go early or in the middle of the second round.\n\nBoth Kadji and Murphy fit NBA scouts’ “Stretch 4” descriptions. They play a similar style to Chris Bosh or Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nKadji’s age, 25, is a negative to some teams. Kadji, who transferred to Miami from Florida, is older than six-year NBA veteran Kevin Durant.\n\n“Kadji surprised scouts with his athletic ability at the Draft Combine,” Chad Ford wrote in a May 17 evaluation for ESPN.com. “If he was a couple of years younger, he might have contended for the first round.”\n\nFlorida State’s Michael Snaer, a 6-5, 200-pound guard, seems bound for an NBA summer league roster, where undrafted free agents compete against draft picks and young NBA players. Scouts worry about Snaer’s size as an NBA wing.\n\nBut those same scouts have concerns about Larkin, who at 5-11 posted the second-highest vertical leap in combine history with a 44-inch jump.\n\n“He’s a heck of a defender,” Larranaga said. “He’s a very, very fast, quick, athletic kid. The kid’s a great athlete. I don’t think size is as major a factor as it once was.”\n\nLarranaga referenced the just-finished NBA Finals, saying the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat both relied on smaller lineups in the games’ most critical moments.\n\n“There’s not a lot of back-to-the-basket being played in the NBA and certainly no point guards doing it,” he said.\n\nSome may disregard Larranaga’s comments, given his relationship with Larkin, but several teams picking in the teens in the first round agree.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks regularly come up in experts’ mock drafts as the most likely to select Larkin, who has a similar build to current Bucks point guard Brandon Jennings.\n\n“I’ve been telling NBA people he’s just gonna get better and better, kind of like a Tony Parker,” said Larranaga. “As he gets more comfortable with the NBA game, he’s got a very, very bright future ahead of him.”"
