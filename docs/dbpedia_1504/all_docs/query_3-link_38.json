        "text": "A version of SEMA model legislation (H.B. 510) to ease the process by which replica cars are titled and registered has been introduced. H.B. 510 defines \"replica car\" as a motor vehicle that is assembled from a pre-fabricated chassis and body kit purchased from a replica car manufacturer.\n\nPlease Contact Members of the New Mexico House Transportation and Public Works Committee (Contact Info Below) to Request Support for H.B. 510\n\nH.B. 510 creates a specific registration and titling class for replicas and provides that the model year is the year of manufacture of the model or brand that a replica car most resembles in outward appearance as described by the manufacturer in published information.\n\nH.B. 510 provides that a replica car is exempt from a state or local law or ordinance requiring periodic vehicle or vehicle emission inspections and testing.\n\nH.B. 510 provides that replica cars shall be maintained only for occasional transportation, exhibitions, vehicle club activities, parades, tours and similar limited uses and not for general or daily transportation.\n\nH.B. 510 provides that a replica car need not have equipment that was not required by state or federal law in its model year.\n\nH.B. 510, if enacted into law, would become effective on July 1, 2015.\n\nDON’T DELAY! Please contact members of the New Mexico House Transportation and Public Works Committee by phone or e-mail to request their support for H.B. 510\n\nPlease e-mail a copy of your letter to Steve McDonald at stevem@sema.org.
