        "text": "Former Baltimore Ravens fullback Lorenzo Taliaferro passed away Wednesday night at the age of 28, according to John Harvey III of the Charlottesville Daily Progress. The York County (Va.) police confirmed the passing of Taliaferro with a family member saying he had a heart attack, Bruce Cunningham of WBFF-TV says.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Lorenzo Taliaferro,\" Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said in a statement. \"Lorenzo was a kind, smart, respectful and determined young man -- someone always committed to his teammates and well-liked by everyone in our organization. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Lorenzo's family. May he rest in peace.\n\nA fourth-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens of Coastal Carolina in 2014, Taliaferro spent four seasons with the Ravens and appeared in 14 games. As a rookie, he rushed for 292 yards and four touchdowns in 13 games. He was second on the team in rushing scores only to Justin Forsett, as his role in the ground game increased after Ray Rice was released in the fallout of a domestic violence incident. Injuries plagued him in each of the next two seasons, as he was limited to three games each in 2015 and â€˜16. Taliaferro was waived during final roster cuts during 2017 training camp and was out of football that season before signing with the Hamilton Tiger Cats of the Canadian Football League for the 2018 season.\n\nTaliaferro spent two seasons at Lackawanna College (Pa.) before attending Coastal Carolina. After a season where he rushed for 357 yards in 12 games in 2012, he burst onto the scene in 2013, carrying the ball 276 times for 1,729 yards (6.4 average) and scoring 27 touchdowns in 15 games. He finished 11th in the voting for the Walter Payton Award, annually given to the most outstanding player in FCS football.\n\nGet the fastest scores, stats, news, LIVE videos, and more.
