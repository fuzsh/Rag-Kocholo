        "text": "What sport comes to mind first when you think of the Atlantic Coast Conference?\n\nIf you are like me, men’s college basketball is the immediate answer. The ACC has a rich and renowned history for excellent hoops action.\n\nOne of the reasons for this longstanding success is the quality of head coaches who have led these programs. Some of the best coaches of all time have prowled the sidelines for these schools.\n\nHere is a quick look at the best coaches in the history of each of the current 15 ACC members. Because we will consider the entire coaching histories of these schools, some of the men on this list coached in the times before the colleges and universities entered the conference.\n\nFor example, Duke entered the ACC in 1953. It's possible that the best Blue Devils' coach was back in their Southern Conference days (Yeah, right!).\n\nIn some cases, the men on this list were not the longest-tenured coaches or those who have the most wins.\n\nWe will, of course, look at total wins, but we will also consider average wins per season, postseason success and more to select the best at each school.\n\nThe coaches on this list represent three of the four all-time winningest coaches. They have won nine NCAA championships\n\nLet's go!\n\nCoaches information comes from Sports-reference.com\n\nOver the years, Clemson basketball has not had significant or consistent success.\n\nThe Tigers were one of the founding members of the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953. Since then, they have only won one regular-season championship (1989-90) and have never won the conference tournament.\n\nWhile Clemson has had a notable list of former head coaches (Press Maravich, Bill C. Foster and Cliff Ellis, to name a few), Rick Barnes was the best.\n\nBarnes was the Tigers’ head coach for only four seasons (74-48), but in that time, they made it into postseason play in all four years, three of those being the NCAA tournament (1995-98).\n\nHis 1996-97 team finished 23-10 and advanced to the Sweet 16.\n\nJim Larranaga has only been Miami’s head coach for two seasons, but he has already established himself as the standard-setter in Coral Gables.\n\nLarranaga’s two-year record of 49-20 is only the beginning of the story.\n\nIn Year 1 at The U, Larranaga was the first Miami head coach to log 20 wins in his initial season. Also, in 2011-12, UM won nine games in ACC play, the first time Miami has posted a winning record in conference play since joining the ACC.\n\nLast year’s team won both the ACC regular season and conference tournament (both firsts in school history).\n\nAfter losing their top six scorers off of last year’s team, Larranaga and the Canes will be facing a serious challenge in 2013-14.\n\nHall of Fame point guard Bob Cousy went from running the show for the Boston Celtics (1950-63) to leading the Boston College men’s basketball program (1963-69).\n\nIn his six seasons as the Eagles head coach, The Cooz posted an impressive 114-38 record (75.5-percent winning percentage), with four 20-win seasons.\n\nIn five of his six seasons, BC played in either the NIT (three times) or the NCAA tournament (twice).\n\nIn his last year (1968-69) as a college head coach, the Eagles won 21 consecutive games.\n\nAccording to NBA.com, an unidentified writer once said, “People have little doubt that while Dr. Naismith may have invented the game, Cousy made it as close to an art form as possible.\"\n\nSometime in the upcoming season, current Florida State head coach Leonard Hamilton will become the school’s all-time wins leader (surpassing J.K. Kennedy’s school mark of 234 victories that took him 18 seasons to set).\n\nGoing into the 2013-14 season, Hamilton has stacked up a 219-143 record since going to Tallahassee (2003-present).\n\nIn 2012, Florida State won its first ACC title in school history.\n\nHis Florida State bio expresses that the ‘Noles are the third winningest program in the ACC since the start of the 2005-06 season.\n\nIn his 11 years at the FSU helm, the program has gone to postseason play in nine of those seasons (four NCAA tournament appearances; five NIT looks).\n\nWhen Bobby Cremins took over at Georgia Tech in 1981, he had his work cut out for him.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets had won a total of 12 games in the previous two seasons as they entered the ACC (in 1979).\n\nCremins made immediate progress, winning 10 and 13 games, respectively, in his first two years in Atlanta.\n\nBut from that point forward, he guided Tech to 14 winning seasons and 14 postseason berths in his remaining 17 years. He led the Yellow Jackets to three ACC tournament titles, two ACC regular-season titles and a Final Four appearance in 1990.\n\nHis overall record at Tech was 354-237. His career mark was 570-360.\n\nCremins is Georgia Tech's all-time winningest coach.\n\nIt didn’t take Jamie Dixon very long to start piling up wins as the Pitt head coach. In his first year, the Panthers went 31-5, won the Big East and advanced to the NCAA Sweet 16.\n\nOver his 10 years in charge, he has a 262-86 (75.3 winning percentage) record and has taken the Panthers to a postseason tournament every year.\n\nDixon’s won 188 games in his first seven seasons, tying the NCAA Division I record for most wins in the first seven seasons of a head coaching career.\n\nAccording to Inside UVA, college basketball analyst Billy Packer once said, “Before Terry Holland, there was no Virginia basketball.”\n\nWhen Holland was hired at Virginia, the bar was not set very high. The Cavaliers had averaged less than 10 wins per season over the previous 23 years.\n\nHolland came to Charlottesville and took the Cavs to the NCAA tournament in his second year (1976). Can you say “job security?”\n\nOver his 16 years as head coach at UVA, he posted a 326-173 record (best in school history).\n\nIn a five-year stretch on Holland’s watch, the Cavaliers won the 1980 NIT and made two Final Fours (1981, 1984), one more Elite Eight (1983) and one additional Sweet 16 (1982) appearance.\n\nThe Cavaliers also won or shared the ACC title in three straight seasons (1981-83).\n\nWith only one year of collegiate head coaching experience under his belt, Digger Phelps took over at Notre Dame in 1971 at 30 years old.\n\nPhelps paid his dues in his first season at South Bend, only winning six games in the 1971-72 season.\n\nFor the next 19 seasons, his Fighting Irish teams competed in 17 postseason tournaments, including the school’s only Final Four appearance (1978), one additional Elite Eight and five more Sweet 16 games.\n\nIn 20 years, Phelps notched a 393-145 record (most wins in school history).\n\nHis ND teams earned a well-deserved reputation as Giant Killers, and Phelps holds a share of the NCAA record for most wins over top-ranked teams with seven.\n\nThe biggest of those surprise victories was ND’s win over UCLA in 1974, breaking the Bruins NCAA-record 88-game consecutive win streak.\n\nPicking Maryland’s best head coach was the most difficult of any of the ACC schools.\n\nChoosing between Lefty Driesell and Gary Williams was quite a challenge.\n\nWhile Driesell was an awesome sideline leader, putting up a 348-159 record in 17 seasons, Williams won 461 games in 22 seasons.\n\nHis Terrapins had 20 winning seasons, but where Williams really carved out his place in school history was in March.\n\nMaryland, on Williams’ watch, made five Sweet 16 appearances (outside of his Final Four appearances), two trips to the Final Four, including winning it all in 2002.\n\nWhen Dean Smith retired right before the 1997-98 season, he left the game on his own terms as the (then) NCAA all-time wins leader with an 879-254 record. His 77.6 win percentage puts him in the top 10 of all time.\n\nUnder Smith, the Tar Heels won 13 ACC tournament titles and 17 conference regular-season championships. Can you say, “domination\"?\n\nUNC made 11 Final Four appearances (tied for second all-time with Mike Krzyzewski), four more Elite Eights and five additional Sweet 16s.\n\nBefore stepping aside, Smith won two NCAA championships (1982 and 1993).\n\nSmith needed seven Final Four appearances just to win his first title, which shows how difficult it is to win it all.\n\nDuke’s Mike Krzyzewski is the NCAA all-time wins leader with a 957-297 record. Right now, he does not indicate any plans to shut things down anytime soon.\n\nCoach K began his Duke tenure in 1980. His first three years in Durham were less than impressive, only winning 38 games in his first three seasons.\n\nBut starting in the 1983-84 season, everything seemed to click for the Blue Devils.\n\nIn the 30 years since then, Duke, under Coach K, has won four NCAA championships and has appeared in nine additional Final Fours. They have won 13 ACC tournament championships and 12 ACC regular-season titles.\n\nUnless something unforeseen happens, Krzyzewski will win his 1,000th game as a college head coach somewhere in the middle of the 2014-15 season.\n\nWow! That’s huge!"
