        "text": "Jan. 27, 2001\n\nBox Score\n\nFairfax, VA, - The George Mason men's basketball seniors took over for the second straight game as the Patriots posted an 84-56 Colonial Athletic Association victory over American University Saturday afternoon before a crowd of 6,373 at the Patriot Center. It was Mason's 11th consecutive win over American.\n\nSenior George Evans netted 25 points, and classmate Erik Herring chipped in 24, marking the fourth time this season the pair has each scored 20 or more in the same game. Senior Tremaine Price dished out seven assists and scored seven points. It was his fourth straight game with seven assists or more, and the point guard has 18 assists and three turnovers in his last two outings.\n\n\"The upperclassmen know the second time around in the conference schedule is important, but it was a total team effort,\" said Evans. \"We want the regular season championship, the top seed in the tournament and the first-round bye. It's much easier to win two games than three.\"\n\nThe Patriots registered 16 steals and forced 22 turnovers for the game. Mason shot 49 percent from the floor and 50 percent (8-for-16) from three-point land.\n\nMason improved to 12-7 overall and 7-2 in the conference. American dropped to 6-14 and 2-7 in the CAA. Patrick Doctor led the Eagles with 18 points, and Ronald Hearns added 17.\n\nTrailing 19-14 with 7:28 left in the first half, the Patriots went on a 33-10 run spread over the remainder of the half and first 5:13 of the second stanza. Herring dropped in 13 points during the run, and Evans added 11 as Mason took a 47-29 lead with 14:47 to play.\n\n\"I've been getting good shots because we've been cutting and moving on offense and passing the ball around really well,\" said Herring. \"It's a combination of everything.\"\n\nWith Mason leading 12-10, American went on a 9-2 run, sparked by a Hearns layup which made the margin 19-14. The Patriots held the Eagles scoreless for the next 5:02 and finished the half with a 14-2 stretch to take a 28-21 cushion at the break. Herring ignited the spurt with a three pointer and added another trey and a layup.\n\n\"American came out very sharp at the beginning and did a good job of getting the ball to Doctor, and he got them off to a good start,\" said Mason head coach Jim Larranaga. \"Our defensive intensity picked up, which allowed us to attack at the offensive end. We distributed the ball very well.\"\n\nFAIRFAX, Va. (AP) - George Evans scored 25 points to help George Mason pull away from American Saturday as the Patriots beat the Eagles for the 11th straight time 84-56.\n\nGeorge Mason (12-7, 7-2 Colonial Athletic Association) used its pressure defense to force 21 turnovers and relied on Evans and Erik Herring, who finished with 24, to lead the Patriots to their largest margin of victory ever over American.\n\nWith 17:17 to play, American (6-14, 2-7) trailed by seven, but was outscored 33-14 over the next nine minutes as George Mason took a 65-39 lead.\n\nPatrick Doctor led the Eagles with 18 points, but there was little balance in American's attack as the Eagles attempted just 12 free-throws. By comparison George Mason converted on 16 of its 23 attempts.\n\nGeorge Mason trailed 19-14 with 7:29 remaining in the first half, but the Patriots closed with a 14-2 run to take a 28-21 halftime lead. American scored the first basket of the second half to cut the lead to five, but never threatened again. The Eagles have not won a conference road game since defeating William & Mary in January of 1999.\n\nWith American heading to the Patriot League next season, Saturday's game was the last CAA contest between the two schools. George Mason dominated the conference series by winning 24 of the 34 regular-season meetings."
