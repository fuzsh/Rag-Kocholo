        "text": "October 10, 2018\n\nMayor Tim Keller released the following statement on the passing of New Mexico Representative Larry Larrañaga:\n\n“Rep. Larry Larrañaga was one of the legislators who believed in a higher calling when it came to politics, often rising above the sometimes petty arguments to truly lead our state. He championed core values of process and fairness and made it his business to understand fiscal policy in New Mexico. Larry taught me a lot and I’m proud to have carried bills with him, and to have stood side by side to bridge partisan divides on some of the toughest issues that faced our state. My heart goes out to his friends, family, and the State of New Mexico. We’ve lost a legislative legend.”"
