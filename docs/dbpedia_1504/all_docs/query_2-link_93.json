        "text": "Bo Ryan announced the other day that he was stepping down as the Wisconsin basketball coach after next season. Syracuse’s Jim Boeheim has also given his target date (2018). It got me to thinking.\n\nIt seems like basketball coaching jobs are a lot more stable than football. But is it true?\n\nNo football coach can match the longevity of Boeheim (hired in 1976) or Mike Krzyzewski (1980) at Duke. But after those two, football coaches match basketball coaches.\n\nFootball has Frank Beamer, hired at Virginia Tech in 1987; Bob Stoops, Oklahoma 1999; Kirk Ferentz, Iowa 1999; Gary Patterson, TCU 2000; Mark Richt, Georgia 2001; and Gary Pinkel, Missouri 2001.\n\nBasketball counters with Tom Izzo, Michigan State 1995; Kevin Stallings, Vanderbilt 1999; Mike Brey, Notre Dame 2000; Ryan, Wisconsin 2001; and Rick Pitino, Louisville 2001.\n\nSo of the 13 longest-standing coaches in Power-5 conferences, both football and basketball, hoops has only a 7-6 advantage.\n\nNow, after that, basketball shows a little more stability. No current football coach was hired in 2002, 2003 or 2004. Nine basketball coaches still on the job were hired during those years.\n\nMike Gundy, hired at OSU in 2005, is the No. 7 active football coach among the 65 major schools. He’s tied with Utah’s Kyle Whittingham, South Carolina’s Steve Spurrier and LSU’s Les Miles, who departure from OSU is what opened the job for Gundy.\n\nBut that 2002-04 window is the only major discrepancy.\n\nFourteen football coaches hired from 2005-09 remain on the job; only 11 basketball coaches hired those five years remain on the job.\n\nAnd everything evens out in the last five years.\n\nSo what does this tell us? Well, I’d say it’s easier to be a decades-long coach in basketball than in football. Three hoops coaches have been on the job at least 20 years; two of those are approaching 40 years. Only Beamer has busted the 20 mark in football.\n\nThe pressure to win is the only compelling reason for the differences. In fact, basketball coaches have more opportunity to move, because there are a variety of hoops jobs outside the Power-5 leagues that are prestigious. The Big East schools, Memphis, Cincinnati, that crowd. Not near that many in football.\n\nYet basketball jobs are a little more stable. I think we know why. Conference realignment taught us that basketball is not quite as important. A coach like Andy Kennedy, on the job since 2006, can last a long time at Ole Miss without big-time results. The Mississippi football coach is not given that luxury. Travis Ford’s failure to get over the hump in basketball is accepted by Stillwater brass, because it would cost too much to make a change. OSU would not hesitate to eat the contract if it was football.\n\nAnd some of the basketball jobs at non-football power schools are incredibly stable. Jay Wright’s been at Villanova since 2001, John Thompson’s been at Georgetown since 2004, Mick Cronin’s been at Cincinnati since 2006 and Fran Dunphy’s been at Temple since 2006.\n\nAll in all, though, I was surprised at how well football coaches have fared in this chart. I would have thought basketball would dominate. Except for the Boeheim/Coach K and the 2002-04 window, there is no discernible difference.\n\nHere are the coaches at Power-5 schools, with basketball on the left and football indented:\n\nJim Boeheim, Syracuse 1976\n\nMike Krzyzewski, Duke 1980\n\nFrank Beamer, Virginia Tech 1987\n\nTom Izzo, Michigan State 1995\n\nBob Stoops, Oklahoma 1999\n\nKirk Ferentz, Iowa 1999\n\nKevin Stallings, Vanderbilt 1999\n\nGary Patterson, TCU 2000\n\nMike Brey, Notre Dame 2000\n\nMark Richt, Georgia 2001\n\nGary Pinkel, Missouri 2001\n\nBo Ryan, Wisconsin 2001\n\nRick Pitino, Louisville 2001\n\nLeonard Hamilton, Florida State 2002\n\nLorenzo Romar, Washington 2002\n\nScott Drew, Baylor 2003\n\nBill Self, Kansas 2003\n\nRoy Williams, North Carolina 2003\n\nJamie Dixon, Pitt 2003\n\nThad Matta, Ohio State 2004\n\nMike Gundy, Oklahoma State 2005\n\nKyle Whittingham, Utah 2005\n\nLes Miles, LSU 2005\n\nSteve Spurrier, South Carolina 2005\n\nMatt Painter, Purdue 2005\n\nPat Fitzgerald, Northwestern 2006\n\nAndy Kennedy, Ole Miss 2006\n\nMark Dantonio, Michigan State 2007\n\nNick Saban, Alabama 2007\n\nJohn Beilein, Michigan 2007\n\nBob Huggins, West Virginia 2007\n\nDabo Swinney, Clemson 2008\n\nDavid Cutcliffe, Duke 2008\n\nPaul Johnson, Georgia Tech 2008\n\nArt Briles, Baylor 2008\n\nTom Crean, Indiana 2008\n\nTravis Ford, Oklahoma State 2008\n\nJohnny Dawkins, Stanford 2008\n\nPaul Rhoads, Iowa State 2009\n\nBill Snyder, Kansas State 2009\n\nDan Mullen, Mississippi State 2009\n\nJohn Calipari, Kentucky 2009\n\nMark Fox, Georgia 2009\n\nSean Miller, Arizona 2009\n\nTony Bennett, Virginia 2009\n\nJimbo Fisher, Florida State 2010\n\nBrian Kelly, Notre Dame 2010\n\nMike London, Virginia 2010\n\nFran McCaffery, Iowa 2010\n\nTad Boyle, Colorado 2010\n\nBrad Brownell, Clemson 2010\n\nDana Altman, Oregon 2010\n\nDana Holgorsen, West Virginia 2011\n\nKevin Wilson, Indiana 2011\n\nRandy Edsall, Maryland 2011\n\nJerry Kill, Minnesota 2011\n\nDavid Shaw, Stanford 2011\n\nAl Golden, Miami 2011\n\nBrian Gregory, Georgia Tech 2011\n\nMark Turgeon, Maryland 2011\n\nJim Larranaga, Miami 2011\n\nMark Gottfried, North Carolina State 2011\n\nLon Kruger, Oklahoma 2011\n\nPat Chambers, Penn State 2011\n\nBilly Kennedy, Texas A&M 2011\n\nLarry Krystkowiak, Utah 2011\n\nMike Anderson, Arkansas 2011\n\nLarry Fedora, North Carolina 2012\n\nUrban Meyer, Ohio State 2012\n\nKyle Flood, Rutgers 2012\n\nTim Beckman, Illinois 2012\n\nRich Rodriguez, Arizona 2012\n\nTodd Graham, Arizona State 2012\n\nJim Mora Jr., UCLA 2012\n\nMike Leach, Washington State 2012\n\nHugh Freeze, Ole Miss 2012\n\nKevin Sumlin, Texas A&M 2012\n\nJohn Groce, Illinois 2012\n\nJohnny Jones, LSU 2012\n\nBruce Weber, Kansas State 2012\n\nTim Miles, Nebraska 2012\n\nTrent Johnson, TCU 2012\n\nFrank Martin, South Carolina 2012\n\nSteve Addazio, Boston College 2013\n\nDave Doeren, North Carolina State 2013\n\nScott Shafer, Syracuse 2013\n\nKliff Kingsbury, Texas Tech 2013\n\nDarrell Hazell, Purdue 2013\n\nSonny Dykes, California 2013\n\nMike MacIntyre, Colorado 2013\n\nMark Helfrich, Oregon 2013\n\nBret Bielema, Arkansas 2013\n\nGus Malzahn, Auburn 2013\n\nMark Stoops, Kentucky 2013\n\nButch Jones, Tennessee 2013\n\nRichard Pitino, Minnesota 2013\n\nChris Collins, Northwestern 2013\n\nEddie Jordan, Rutgers 2013\n\nTubby Smith, Texas Tech 2013\n\nSteve Alford, UCLA 2013\n\nAndy Enfield, Southern Cal 2013\n\nBobby Petrino, Louisville 2014\n\nDave Clawson, Wake Forest 2014\n\nCharlie Strong, Texas 2014\n\nJames Franklin, Penn State 2014\n\nSteve Sarkisian, Southern Cal 2014\n\nChris Petersen, Washington 2014\n\nDerek Mason, Vanderbilt 2014\n\nBruce Pearl, Auburn 2014\n\nJim Christian, Boston College 2014\n\nCuonzo Martin, California 2014\n\nKim Anderson, Missouri 2014\n\nWayne Tinkle, Oregon State 2014\n\nBuzz Williams, Virginia Tech 2014\n\nDanny Manning, Wake Forest 2014\n\nErnie Kent, Washington State 2014\n\nPat Narduzzi, Pitt 2015\n\nDavid Beaty, Kansas 2015\n\nJim Harbaugh, Michigan 2015\n\nMike Riley, Nebraska 2015\n\nPaul Chryst, Wisconsin 2015\n\nGary Andersen, Oregon State 2015\n\nJim McElwain, Florida 2015\n\nAvery Johnson, Alabama 2015\n\nBobby Hurley, Arizona State 2015\n\nMichael White, Florida 2015\n\nSteve Prohm, Iowa State 2015\n\nBen Howland, Mississippi State 2015\n\nShaka Smart, Texas 2015\n\nRick Barnes, Tennessee 2015"
