        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, March 31 - U.C.L.A. will play Louisiana State in an N.C.A.A. semifinal Saturday with two big men hurt. Ryan Hollins, the Bruins' 7-foot-1 center, bruised his right thigh during practice Friday.\n\nLorenzo Mata, their 6-8 center, broke his nose earlier in the week.\n\nHollins, a senior, was to receive electrical stimulation, massage and ice therapy on the thigh, Coach Ben Howland said.\n\n\"He has some swelling there,\" Howland said. \"Assuming it's just musculature, it will take a team of horses to hold him from being able to play. Anything's possible, though, especially this year.\"\n\nHollins was hurt in a collision with a teammate during a practice before the Bruins arrived at the RCA Dome for a shoot-around, which Hollins sat out. In the tournament, Hollins has averaged 12 points, second on the team, and 6.3 rebounds.\n\nMata practiced Friday with a mask after breaking his nose in practice Wednesday. \"Our trainer did a good job of snapping it right back into place,\" Howland said. Mata also broke his nose in January.\n\nTHE DAVIS AND NOAH SHOW -- Short news conferences before big sports events do not necessarily reveal character or even dimensions of personality. But they sometimes hint at an athlete's state of mind.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
