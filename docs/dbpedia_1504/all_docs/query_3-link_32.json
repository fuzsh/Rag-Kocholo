        "text": "Michael Jordan invited him to coach at his fantasy camp in Las Vegas over the summer, and in a blink Jim Larranaga was sharing tee times with all the glitterati. Chuck Daly, Larry Brown, Lenny Wilkens, Lute Olson, John Thompson, Dean Smith. On Larranaga went with the roll call of Hall of Famers, which eventually begged a question:\n\nDid he feel a part of that great fraternity, or merely the fortunate coach of the team that rocked the college basketball world by advancing to the Final Four last spring?\n\n\"I felt like this could be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, something I would always remember,\" he said.\n\nNothing changes in Fairfax.\n\nESPN can set up its tripods Friday for Midnight Madness, the christening moment for most of the nation's Division I college basketball teams. A Big East school in need such as Seton Hall can unsuccessfully court Larranaga about its opening. George Mason almost doubled his salary. And, because of last season's run, the kids Larranaga speaks to about coming to play for Mason no longer ask, dumbfounded, \"Who?\" and \"Where?\"\n\nBut at the core of the school's men's basketball team is the same coaching lifer who speaks in long soliloquies rather than editable sound bites, whose major daily alterations come at the campus dining facility, where Larranaga decides to order either the mashed potatoes or the rice with his usual baked chicken.\n\n\"Coach L?\" said Folarin Campbell, the best of the 11 returning players from Mason's magical run last season. \"Naw, he's the same. Nothin' different about him.\"\n\nAfter he checked out of his suite at the Mirage in Las Vegas and after his wife, Liz, returned the golf cart in Kona, Hawaii -- after the schmoozing died at the ESPYs in Hollywood -- Jim Larranaga came back to suburban Virginia to coach his mid-major college basketball team.\n\nPeople always forget that about the giant-killing business: David still had to go home and feed the sheep.\n\n\"I don't sleep much at all now,\" Larranaga said. \"I'm normally doing e-mails till midnight and up at 4:30 or 5, going back on my e-mail. But for the most part, I've tried to maintain the same schedule and routine as before.\"\n\nOf course, the reality is there are two college teams in America that cannot possibly do better than they did last season: Florida, which won the national championship, and George Mason, which turned a controversial at-large bid to the NCAA tournament into a reason for every school with towering dreams to be afforded the same opportunity.\n\nWinning the Colonial Athletic Association is kind of anticlimatic after shocking U-Conn. to win an NCAA region final, no? Before that game, Larranaga pretended his hands were drawn six-shooters, plucked dramatically from his make-believe holster. \"We're from the CAA,\" he said, pausing for effect while he blew on the barrels of his index fingers. \"The Connecticut Assassins Association!\"\n\nHis players laughed, roared and went out and made it all the way to Indiana, the cradle of small-basketball lore. How do you duplicate that?\n\n\"I'm not trying to duplicate last season; I'm trying to get them to see how good we can be this season,\" Larranaga said.\n\nLamar Butler, Jai Lewis and Tony Skinn all graduated and signed deals with European teams, leaving Campbell as the Patriots' big outside threat and Will Thomas as their most effective big man at about 6 feet 7. They have some nice pieces from last season, but let's be real: Is Mason Final Four good?\n\n\"If you had asked me a year ago that question and I said, 'We have a chance to go to the Final Four,' you would have said, 'This guy is crazy.' Right?\"\n\nRight.\n\n\"So this year you ask me that question. And if I said, 'We have a shot,' you might say, 'Hmmm. Is he serious?' \"\n\nThe point is, Mason has put a doubt in your mind. Of the three national television appearances this season -- no one in the athletic department can remember if three of George Mason's regular season games were ever televised nationally -- one is against mighty Duke in Cameron Indoor Stadium on Dec. 9.\n\nCan anyone guarantee their life savings that Duke wins that game? If they're smart, the answer is no. Not in a college hoops environment in which the nation's biggest programs lose their kids early and the nation's smallest are full of kids Mike Krzyzewski forgot to call back and thank for their interest.\n\nLarranaga was greatly compensated after Mason's run; the school extended his contract three years, through 2012. He went from making less than $200,000 per season to $375,000. The school tossed him a $100,000 bonus just for going to the Final Four. Seton Hall got permission to speak to him, but Larranaga wasn't ready to go Big East on Mason.\n\nHe liked his team, the school, the community and the kids he brought in. Plus, he achieved one of his lifetime goals, becoming a motivational speaker. Four days after the loss to Florida in the national semifinals, Larranaga spoke about the magic-carpet ride in front of 900 people at a Northern Virginia Technology Council breakfast. The Washington Speakers Bureau signed him to a lucrative deal. He is working with Lon Babby, the prominent Washington sports agent who represents Grant Hill and Tim Duncan, among other athletes, to explore book deals and the like. During a Nike-sponsored trip to Kona, Liz Larranaga actually commandeered a golf cart away from the course and toward a shopping mall, returning it just in time to meet the rest of her party at the clubhouse. \"Phil Knight thought that was the funniest thing ever,\" she said of the Nike founder. \"I guess it's because he's in retail.\"\n\nLost in the summer wonderland was a telling decision by Larranaga. Mason's third recruit this season was a bright, talented kid who had scored high on his SAT. Shortly after he was signed, he had a legal run-in involving an illicit substance. Nothing was proven and there was no conviction, and Larranaga wanted to give the recruit a second chance. When the problem materialized again, he thought it would be better if the kid started over somewhere else. He was asked whether it was difficult to part ways with a kid who he knew could help the team at a time when people were expecting much more from it after the pixie dust dissolved last March.\n\n\"I didn't think of it in those terms,\" he said. \"I dealt with him as I would have dealt with my own son. People would bring up the problem if he was here and I didn't think a 17- or 18-year-old kid needed to go through with that -- just as I thought that it wouldn't be great for George Mason. I really thought it would be better if he got a clean start somewhere else.\"\n\nThe kid ended up enrolling at Fairfield, Larranaga ended up keeping his values and life in the basketball department at George Mason University returned to normal. The coach is richer and more famous and Duke is on the schedule. But beyond the memory of last season, it's still very much baked chicken and rice with gravy in Fairfax. It's still Larranaga."
