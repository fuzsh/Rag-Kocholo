        "text": "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Watch sophomore running back Lorenzo Lingard during practice on Wednesday as he still waits to make his season debut.\n\nMiami (2-2, 0-1 ACC) hosts Virginia Tech (2-2, 0-2) on Saturday (3:30 p.m., ESPN).\n\nLingard has not played since suffering a left knee injury in practice nearly a year ago on Oct. 22, 2018. He has turned to his social media to state he is healthy and head coach Manny Diaz has stated he is close to playing multiple times, but Lingard has yet to play this year.\n\nJunior DeeJay Dallas (343 yards, 5 TDs), sophomore Cam'Ron Harris (125 yards, 2 TDs), sophomore Robert Burns (32 yards, 0 TDs), and senior James Murphy (17 yards, 1 TD) have handled the carries by the running backs this season.\n\nMiami is coming off a season-low 51 rushing yards against Central Michigan for the lowest total by the Hurricanes\n\nThe Hurricanes rank 86th nationally (out of 130 teams) and 10th in the ACC (out of 14) in rushing."
