        "text": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — It may sound cliché but the saying goes, the best offense is a good defense. At least on Friday night, the saying rang true for Miami as they blew past Utah in the Puerto Rico Tip-Off Tournament.\n\nAs the 16th-ranked Utes fell to Miami 90-66, the Hurricanes’ biggest strength was turning their defense into offense as they caused 16 turnovers, converting them into 23 points offensively.\n\n“They did a nice job defending us,” Utah head coach Larry Krystkowiak said. “Anytime you score 23 points off your turnovers, it’s impossible to defend against that. So when we throw the ball up and they pick it off, it’s really hard to overcome.”\n\nMiami played Utah tough in the backcourt causing Utah’s two starting guards, Lorenzo Bonam and Brandon Taylor to commit seven combined turnovers. The Hurricanes’ simply were quicker than the Utes as they had eight steals led by guard Angel Rodriguez who had three steals.\n\n“When we played good team defense and rotated and helped each other well, our hands were very active and sometimes we came up with the ball,” Miami head coach Jim Larranaga said.\n\nWhile the Utes trailed from the get-go, turnovers killed the Utes in the middle of the first half as the Hurricanes built a commanding lead. With 12 minutes left in the half, Utah trailed 21-12 and had plenty of chances in the following four minutes to chip away at Miami’s lead. However, like much of the rest of the game, turnovers halted Utah’s progress as they committed five turnovers in that time and allowed Miami to go on an 8-3 run.\n\nGOOD FOR GOOD, BAD FOR BAD: If a good offense was a good defense for Miami, then for Utah, a bad offense was a bad defense. On Friday night, the Utes were unable to stop Miami’s high-powered offense mostly due to a lack of intensity on their own offensive efforts.\n\nMiami’s Sheldon McClellan led the way scoring a season-high 27 points, while Tonye Jekiri dropped a career-high 20 points against Utah.\n\nKrystkowiak pointed to a lack of toughness offensively which really hurt the Utes defensively.\n\n“They played hard, but you have to play hard on offense too. I think it’s a misnomer that you only equate playing hard with playing defense,” Krystkowiak said. “They played harder than we did when they were on defense and when you combine that with not playing very intelligently and when you get outplayed from a toughness standpoint and then you shoot yourself in the foot with turnovers, it is a deadly combination.”\n\nKrystkowiak was quick to note that Miami play very well but that there are things that the Utes need to improve in order to be successful in the future.\n\n“They are a fine defensive team, but a lot of it was stuff that if we don’t fix, we won’t be very successful so I would like to think we can control some more of that,” he said.\n\nGAME-NOTES: Miami’s Rodriguez is probably the tournament’s most beloved players as he hails from Cupey, Puerto Rico. The redshirt senior finished with 11 points, four assists and three steals against the Utes and received the biggest cheers from the crowd… Austin Montgomery and Kenneth Ogbe saw their first minutes of the year for the Utes in the loss… Utah’s only previous game against Miami was an 88-87 loss in 1966… Sunday’s match-up against Temple will be the first-ever meeting for the two programs… After returning home from Puerto Rico next week, the Utes will play their next game at home against Idaho State on Nov. 27th."
