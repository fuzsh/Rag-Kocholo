        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. – NC State men's basketball players Jarkel Joiner and Terquavion Smith were named to the All-ACC Second Team while D.J. Burns, Jr., was an Honorable Mention All-ACC selection as the conference office unveiled the 2022-23 All-ACC Men's Basketball Team and award winners.\n\nThe 2022-23 All-ACC Team was determined by a 78-member panel consisting of the league's 15 head coaches and 63 members of the media.\n\nThis marks the first time since the 2012-13 season that NC State has had multiple players earn All-ACC recognition. In 2013, the Pack's Richard Howell (First Team), Lorenzo Brown (Second Team) and C.J. Leslie (Third Team) all received All-ACC honors.\n\nIn his one and only season with the Pack, Joiner earned All-ACC second team honors. The Oxford, Miss., native finished the regular season fourth in the ACC in scoring with an average of 17.3 points per game and was also fourth in the conference in free throw percentage at 82.5 percent and finished fifth in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio at 2.25. Joiner led the Pack in scoring in its 20 ACC games as he ended the season on a tear averaging 23.5 points, 5.7 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 2.0 steals in NC State's last six games of the regular season.\n\nIn 31 games this season, Joiner led NC State in scoring 11 times, assists nine times and steals nine times.\n\nSmith joined Joiner on the All-ACC Second Team. Smith led NC State in scoring (outscoring Joiner by two points in the regular season) with a 17.3 points per game average. The Greenville, N.C., native finished the regular season ranked in the top-10 in five different categories in the ACC. He finished third in scoring, fifth in three-pointers made per game (2.74), seventh in steals (1.5), eighth in assists (4.4) and ninth in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.99).\n\nSmith led the team in scoring, assists and steals in the regular season. In 31 games, he led NC State in assists 21 times, steals 13 times and scoring 12 times.\n\nBurns earned Honorable Mention All-ACC honors. The Rock Hill, S.C., native 13.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting 56.8 percent from the field this season. He increased those averages to 16.1 points and 5.6 rebounds per game in the Pack's 20 ACC games. He finished the regular season third in the ACC in field goal percentage.\n\n2022-23 Season Awards\n\nPlayer of the Year – Isaiah Wong, Miami\n\nDefensive Player of the Year – Reece Beekman, Virginia\n\nRookie of the Year – Kyle Filipowski, Duke\n\nSixth Man of the Year – Nike Sibande, Pitt\n\nMost Improved Player – Quinten Post, Boston College\n\nCoach of the Year – Jeff Capel, Pitt\n\n2022-23 All-ACC Team\n\nFirst Team\n\nIsaiah Wong, Miami, 337\n\nArmando Bacot, North Carolina, 324\n\nTyree Appleby, Wake Forest, 319\n\nHunter Tyson, Clemson, 271\n\nJamarius Burton, Pitt, 262\n\nSecond Team\n\nKyle Filipowski, Duke, 258\n\nTerquavion Smith, NC State, 243\n\nJarkel Joiner, NC State, 203\n\nJordan Miller, Miami, 148\n\nBlake Hinson, Pitt, 132\n\nThird Team\n\nNorchad Omier, Miami, 131\n\nPJ Hall, Clemson, 126\n\nKihei Clark, Virginia, 102\n\nJesse Edwards, Syracuse, 54\n\nReece Beekman, Virginia, 54\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nEl Ellis, Louisville, 50\n\nGrant Basile, Virginia Tech, 43\n\nJudah Mintz, Syracuse, 40\n\nJeremy Roach, Duke, 35\n\nQuinten Post, Boston College, 33\n\nJayden Gardner, Virginia, 31\n\nRJ Davis, North Carolina, 26\n\nDJ Burns Jr., NC State, 24\n\nCaleb Love, North Carolina, 21\n\nNotes: All-ACC Team points are determined on a 5-3-1 system (five points for first team, three points for second team, one point for third team); 75 total voters.\n\nACC Player of the Year\n\nIsaiah Wong, Miami, 30 votes\n\nTyree Appleby, Wake Forest, 23\n\nArmando Bacot, North Carolina, 9\n\nHunter Tyson, Clemson, 4\n\nKyle Filipowski, Duke, 3\n\nJamarius Burton, Pitt, 3\n\nJarkel Joiner, NC State, 2\n\nJeremy Roach, Duke, 1\n\nACC Rookie of the Year\n\nKyle Filipowski, Duke, 68 votes\n\nJudah Mintz, Syracuse, 7\n\nAll-Defensive Team\n\nReece Beekman, Virginia, 63 votes\n\nJesse Edwards, Syracuse, 56\n\nLeaky Black, North Carolina, 55\n\nDereck Lively II, Duke, 45\n\nKihei Clark, Virginia, 26\n\nAll-Freshman Team\n\nKyle Filipowski, Duke, 75 votes\n\nJudah Mintz, Syracuse, 72\n\nTyrese Proctor, Duke, 51\n\nJJ Starling, Notre Dame, 39\n\nDereck Lively II, Duke, 39\n\nACC Coach of the Year\n\nJeff Capel, Pitt, 57 votes\n\nJim Larrañaga, Miami, 8\n\nBrad Brownell, Clemson, 6\n\nKevin Keatts, NC State, 2\n\nTony Bennett, Virginia, 2\n\nACC Defensive Player of the Year\n\nReece Beekman, Virginia, 29 votes\n\nLeaky Black, North Carolina, 18\n\nJesse Edwards, Syracuse, 13\n\nDereck Lively II, Duke, 6\n\nFederiko Federiko, Pitt, 3\n\nJa'von Franklin, Georgia Tech, 3\n\nJustyn Mutts, Virginia Tech, 2\n\nNorchad Omier, Miami, 1\n\nACC Most Improved Player\n\nQuinten Post, Boston College, 23 votes\n\nSean Pedulla, Virginia Tech, 14\n\nJordan Miller, Miami, 14\n\nChase Hunter, Clemson, 10\n\nCameron Hildreth, Wake Forest, 3\n\nCasey Morsell, NC State, 3\n\nWooga Poplar, Miami, 3\n\nJesse Edwards, Syracuse, 2\n\nJJ Traynor, Louisville, 1\n\nFederiko Federiko, Pitt, 1\n\nJeremy Roach, Duke, 1\n\nACC Sixth Man of the Year\n\nNike Sibande, Pitt, 47 votes\n\nBen Vander Plas, Virginia, 8\n\nRyan Young, Duke, 7\n\nDariq Whitehead, Duke, 6\n\nBensley Joseph, Miami, 3\n\nDeivon Smith, Georgia Tech, 2\n\nDevin McGlockton, Boston College, 2"
