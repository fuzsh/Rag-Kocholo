        "text": "Jim Palma played basketball at the University of Miami for only one year in the 1940s, but that is irrelevant to Jim Larranaga.\n\nThe Miami coach took the time out of his schedule ahead of the matchup against the Duke Blue Devils to reach out to Palma, who was fighting pancreatic cancer.\n\n\"We have a saying,\" said Larranaga. \"Once a 'Cane, always a 'Cane.\"\n\n\"Coach was incredibly genuine,\" Palma's son, Larry, told The Associated Press. \"He was asking, 'How tall are you? What position did you play? How was your team? What did you study? What was your job? How are your kids? Did your kids play?' It was not like a mail-it-in phone call. He really cared, and at the end of the conversation, he said his team was dedicating the Duke game to Jim Palma.\"\n\n\"He was thrilled,\" said Larry. \"And that was the last phone call he ever took.\"\n\nAfter speaking with Larranaga, Palma stayed up late to watch the Hurricanes take on the Blue Devils, going to sleep when Miami led 14-12. His son woke him at midnight to give him some medication and told him that the Hurricanes defeated the Blue Devils 90-74.\n\nPalma passed away on Sunday morning at 88-years-old."
