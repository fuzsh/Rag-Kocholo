        "text": "Country music singer and songwriter Becky Hobbs has accomplished many things in her life, including writing Alabama's chart-topping I Believe There Are Angels Among Us .\n\nHer latest project is Nanyehi -- Beloved Woman of the Cherokee, a musical in honor of an ancestor.\n\nThe musical is one of eight recipients of grants from the 2010 Visual and Expressive Art Program at The Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. The museum supports arts activities to increase knowledge, understanding and appreciation of contemporary American Indian arts.\n\nHobbs has composed 16 songs for the musical, which will be staged by the Cherokee National Theatre Company in 2011. The goal is to create a traveling production that will eventually head to Broadway.\n\nHobbs also wrote the script with playwright- director Nick Sweet.\n\nThe musical is based on Hobbs' ancestor Nanyehi, also known as Nancy Ward. Her husband, Kingfisher, was killed in battle, and she took up his fight and led the Cherokees to victory over the Creek tribe.\n\nShe became a beloved Cherokee leader who advocated peace during the Revolutionary War era, and corresponded with Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.\n\nHobbs is a native of Bartlesville, Okla. She has performed in more than 40 countries and had 25 charted singles.\n\n\"My great-great-grandparents, Susannah Taylor Parks and Samuel Parks, arrived in the Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in 1835,\" Hobbs said. \"They had been living in the eastern Tennessee area. For the first time, I recently saw their list of belongings upon their arrival. Talk about touching.\"\n\nLOTS OF UPCOMING FESTIVALS: This is a great time of the year for blues, gospel, country and bluegrass music.
