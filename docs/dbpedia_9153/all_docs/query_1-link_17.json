        "text": "Starting out, Tell us who you are, how did you end up playing in Bartlesville, favorite drinks, entertainer, who inspires you to greatness, family, hometown, song, book, what is your passion when not performing....\n\nMy name is Becky Hobbs and I was born and raised in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. We lived on Quapaw and I went to Jefferson Elementary School until I was eight and then we built a house in Pennington Hills and I went to Will Rogers for one year, then Hoover for three. I started taking piano lessons from Nadine Russell when I was 8. Took 2 lessons and quit (I was painfully shy, believe it or not!), then I started back when I was nine, after I heard my older sister, Barbara playing “Witch Doctor” and “Flying Purple People Eater”! Barbara would sit down and play so beautifully...her hands just glided over the keys. My hands were smaller, so I had to play harder. My parents used to complain that they couldn’t hear the TV set when I practiced! I wore pigtails and my sister said I looked like “Rhoda” in “The Bad Seed” (the little girl who murdered people!) While at Madison Jr, High, I started getting into Bob Dylan and folk music. My folks bought me a $25. “no brand name” guitar and Nancy Sloan and I worked up some songs. We sang at a couple of Madison Assemblies. I went one year to Col-Hi, and it was that year that I started an all-girl band called The Four Faces of Eve. A friend of my dad’s MADE me an electric guitar and I got a $50. Airline amplifier and a $7. Microphone for Christmas. I was ready to rock! The first band consisted of Karen Esch on drums, Cherie Martini on organ, Audley Collins on lead guitar and me on rhythm. We rehearsed in the Martini’s living room, because Cherie’s “organ” was actually a giant living room monstrosity that belonged to her mother! We had more rehearsals than gigs! I remember inviting boys to come by to hear us (thinking they would think we were cool) and it didn’t work...it scared the hell out of ‘em! Sadly, Karen passed away a few years ago in Kansas City and it broke my heart. She was a wonderful, spiritual person. That group morphed into a group that included Beth Ann Morrison on bass, Mary Lou Morrison on drums and Judy Pershall on lead guitar. Sooner High opened and I went there for my Junior and Senior years. I continued playing with the girl band and also played with some guys (John “Ocean” O’Shaughnessy, Tom Gray, Charlie Spears, Billy Joe Cook, Mark Layden, etc.) called “Epicurean Time Machine” and “Undetermined Mud”. We did Jefferson Airplane, Cream, Animals, Jimi Hendrix, etc. We were a bunch of little Okie hippies having a great time! The guys chipped in to buy an old pea0green station wagon and called it “the Bomb”. I painted giant flowers on it (I ruined many a vehicle in my day). Someone busted out the front windshield, so the guys had to wear motorcycle helmets when they drove it! Bartlesville was way square back then. If you were a guy and had long hair, you got sent home from school! I got sent home a couple of times when my skirts were too short and another time when my dress was too long (I wore a “granny” dress to Col-Hi, heaven forbid!) I was told to cut my bangs more than once. I made most of my clothes, because I couldn’t find anything wild enough to buy, not even in Tulsa!\n\nBefore I was old enough to drive, my dad would drive me to the Bartlesville Civic Center and I would stand on the front row and listen to the bands. I saw Jerry Lee Lewis when I was real young, and then later on, a lot of the West Coast psychedelic bands. I’ll never forget a band called “The California Spectrum”. It was the first time I ever saw a strobe light! I was hooked! I saw “Them” from England, “The Fifth Estate”, “The Five Americans”, “The Blue Things”, the horn show-bands out of Lawrence, KS, like the Red Dogs, who had a Bville guys in the band, The Flippers, etc. They all impressed and inspired me. “The Wanderers” were a real popular local band then, with Raymond Berry on guitar, Gary Nodine on vocals, Chris Malick on organ. They played at the “Y-Hut” a lot. Since we were so young then, my bands didn’t play a whole lot of gigs...a few “Battle of the Bands”, a few Teen Hops, Whiting Hall in Pawhuska (we made $3. “gas money” to play on the Rogues V’s breaks once) and the Nowata VFW.\n\nThe “Killer” (Jerry Lee Lewis) is my all-time favorite entertainer. I like to drink wine with dinner and I like a good Irish Coffee after the show...it’s “good for the voice”! It’s funny...music is what brought me to the dance, but I spend most of my time at my computer, taking care of business stuff. I have a catalog of over a thousand songs, and also my own label, Beckaroo. When I do have some time to myself, I like to just sit at my grand piano and just play for my own enjoyment. I also like to look at magazines with my cats on my lap! I’ve given up on cooking. My husband is a much better cook than I’ll ever be, so I just let him do the honors! I do like to dig in the dirt. It makes me feel grounded and gives me ideas for songs.\n\nHow did you get started? When? Why? Describe \"the moment\" you knew you were destined to become a performing artist.\n\nI have been writing songs since I started playing the piano. I just assumed anyone could write a song. The older I get, the more I realize that it is truly a gift and that I really have very little to do with it. The best songs I have ever written are the ones where I just step out of the way. I found a little diary in my old bedroom on Princeton Drive. On one page, I wrote:\n\n“My name is Rebecca Ann Hobbs. I am in the fifth grade. I am a songwriter.”\n\nAfter I graduated HS, I went to Tulsa University for one year. I played in an all-girl band out of Tulsa and then I moved to Baton Rouge, LA for 2 years and played with a southern rock band called “Swampfox”. Went out to L.A. after that and stayed for 9 years before moving to Nashville 24 years ago!#!\n\nTell us about your current projects.....\n\nMy new album, SONGS FROM THE ROAD OF LIFE, just came out and I am busy promoting it. I have some gigs, not nearly as many as I used to have. For a solid decade, I was never home...I was supporting a band, a bus, a manager, an agent, etc. and I was digging myself a huge debt-hole. Plus I was exhausted all the time. My life is much easier now.\n\nHow would you define your music?\n\nA lot of it is rockin’. A lot of it is poignant. I just try to keep it as honest as possible.\n\nDo you play both acoustic and full band gigs? Which do you prefer, and why?\n\nNow I am doing more acoustic gigs than full-band. A lot of times, it’s just Duane on acoustic guitar and me on keys and sometimes just me by myself. I prefer the acoustic gigs now...less wear and tear. It’s easier to hear the words and enjoy the songs. However, if there’s a big stage and a big audience and a rockin’ band, I’m THERE!\n\nSongwriting, who writes most of the songs, or do you all write with others, or each other? If so, who?\n\nI’ve done a lot of co-writing through the years, but I prefer to write alone.\n\nWhat inspires you to write? What was your first original song preformed by You? What songs are you working on now? Do you ever curb your writing if it becomes to personal, and does that change the intergrity of the song?\n\nJust being around another day inspires me to write! ”In A Dish” and “Dancing “Bear” were a couple of real dogs back in the early days! Let me apologize right now to all those poor folks who had to listen to them!\n\nI don’t think a song can be too personal. I hate it when someone “waters it down.” If it’s true for me, it’s gonna be true for others.\n\nDo you think Bartlesville crowds are open to original music? Where do you want to see live music here in town in the future? Where do you want it to be and how can we get it there?\n\nIt’s been so long since I’ve performed in Bartlesville, that I don’t know what’s going on anymore. After I started getting some notoriety, I came back often to play. I played at the Community Center, the high schools, occasionally a night club. I would love to see a great “listening” venue in Bville, sort of like the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, where you can go and hear original music, relax and have a drink. There is so much talent in Northeastern Oklahoma. There should be an outlet.\n\n*Describe your \"dream venue\" for live music in Bartlesville. Accoustics, crowd, ambiance.....What improvements do you see being made in the local venues here and what additional things can be done.\n\nIn playing cover songs, do you find there is a magic mix for the fans, or the venues?\n\nWhat are some of the toughest challenges you’ve faced to this point?\n\nMaking a living making music my whole adult life has been tough, but it’s been worth it.\n\nWho would you cite as your biggest musical influence, also who has influenced your life more than anyone else would? –\n\nMy dad loved music so much and although he played violin in the Coffeyville Jr. College Orchestra, he never pursued it professionally. He was so proud of me for following my dream and he cheered me on. My dream started where his left off.\n\nHow important is creative freedom to you, both as a writer as an artist?\n\nGot to have it all the way around! I did learn the hard way, though, not to sing “Bullshit” in Hiawasse, GA!!! A lady wrote into the newspaper and complained!\n\nWhat do you feel your greatest reward has been as an artist thus far?\n\nWriting “Angels Among Us’ and knowing that it has helped raise money for charities all over the world.\n\nWhat advice do you have for aspiring musicians?\n\nDo what feels right in your soul, ‘cause you gotta live with yourself the rest of your life.\n\nWhat were some of the toughest challenges that you faced starting out?\n\nI was having too much fun to realize how tough it really was! I reckon that’s a good thing!\n\nHow do you balance \"normal life\" and the life of a musician, or is that possible?\n\nThis life is the only one I’ve known, so it is normal for me. Fortunately, I have a great husband, Duane Sciacqua who is also a musician (played guitar with Paul McCartney, Glenn Frey for 15 years, etc.) and we have a studio right in our home. He plays with me on most of my road gigs, and we have no children to worry about, so it makes the road a lot less lonely. Momaroo is here with us now in Nashville, so she is my main concern when we are gone, but she is doing much better now.\n\nWhat brings you peace?\n\nPeace to me is knowing I did the best I could do.\n\nWho is the best instrumentalist, and vocalist, you have ever performed with, and why? In these areas, who would you like to perform with and have not to date?\n\nI have performed with the Killer, Johnny Cash, Conway Twitty, George Jones, Merle Haggard, Alabama, you name it! The songwriter shows I have done with Randy Owen for St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital are some of my favorites.\n\nDo you want to share with us a “most memorable” time, and/or a.. “no one could have a worse night than this” event?\n\nMy most memorable tour was in nine countries in Africa in 1992. I met the most spiritual people in my life there. One night in Zambia, the promoter came back before the show and said that 30 to 50% of our audience had AIDS. I will never forget that night. The hotel we stayed at in Kigali was the one in the movie “Hotel Rwanda”. There was already a civil war going on there and we had heard nothing about it at home.\n\nAs far as a “panic” moment, Duane and I drove to Lexington, KY to catch one of Alabama’s “Farewell Tour” concerts last year. Their office had gotten us comp tickets to the show, but no one had contacted me about getting up there to sing. During the first part of the show, I had a glass of wine (which I NEVER have if I’m performing...I’m a real cheap date) and lo and behold Randy started talking about me and called me up to sing “I Want To Know You Before we Make Love” (which I co-wrote) with him. Now, the problem with this is that he sings it in E and I sing it in Bb!!! So, in front of thousands of people, I turned around to Teddy and said, start it in E, then walk into A and I’ll sing the 2nd verse out. I was sweating a possible “train wreck” right in the middle of a great Alabama show, but thank God it worked out just fine. Then, we sang “Angels Among Us” together. It was a great moment for me. After the show, I was in the Ladies Room and some young girls said, “You should be a SINGER!”\n\nDoes your instrument have a name? How did it get that name?\n\nNo, none of my pianos or keyboards have names, but Duane has a few choice names for my accordion!#!\n\nHow do you perceive a band to be? Is it family, business, friends, etc??? How does one work through problems that come up?\n\nI love the camaraderie of fellow musicians on the road, and I’ve always preferred my band members to be friends. A sense of humor is a must!\n\nDo you have a \"ritual\" before playing? What is it? Do you still get nervous before a show?\n\nI pray before a show. If Duane is with me, we pray together. I believe it’s all in God’s hands (but a good monitor man doesn’t hurt!) I’m always nervous before I go out there!\n\nLet’s do a short bio of you, name, hometown, years with band or involved in music, instruments played, vocals, nicknames, favorite food, drink, movie.. song, please feel free to add on or delete off of the list..\n\nMy nickname is “Beckaroo” given to me by Don Goodman the first time we wrote together! On stage I play mostly piano, some accordion and a little guitar. My favorite food is dark chocolate. As far as songs and movies go, there’s just too many to mention!\n\nThat’s it! I’ll bet you all are sick of me by now!"
