        "text": "Gene Watson’s Peers within the country music industry believe in the sheer talent of this unassuming man from east Texas, so much so that Gene is regarded by many of them as ‘the singer’s singer’ – and rightly so!\n\nAll of Gene Watson’s Peers, who were contacted during 2010, were most gracious with their time and words.\n\nIt is here, within this special part of The Gene Watson Fan Site, that you have an opportunity to read a quote from Liz Talley, which she submitted to this site on Sunday 21 February 2010.\n\nSean Brady would like to take this opportunity to say ‘thank you’ to Liz Talley who made a special contribution to this unique part of this online ‘celebration of a Lone Star Hero’.\n\nLiz Talley\n\nThis quote was submitted on Sunday 21 February 2010.\n\n‘Gene Watson is one of the finest singers in the business and I’ve been a fan of his as far back as I can remember.\n\nI’m so proud of everything our hometown boy has accomplished!\n\nHe’s from right here in Houston, Texas’\n\nThank you, Liz Talley, for your support of Gene Watson.\n\nAbout Liz Talley…\n\nLiz Talley hails from Houston in Texas and when she sings, the sound is a pure Texas delight!\n\nLiz Talley’s music is a breath of fresh air from the sounds of today’s country music radio in the United States. She takes you back to the days of the Texas dance-hall with twin fiddles and a steel guitar. ‘That’s exactly what I grew up listening to’, recalls Liz. ‘People took their kids to dances and Sunday gatherings. I learned to dance standing on my Daddy’s feet to that honky tonk music and I always loved that sound’.\n\nLiz Talley’s debut album, ‘Road to You’ (Armadillo Records, 2006), created quite a stir in the music scene.\n\nThe first single, ‘Texas In Your Swing’, which was written by Liz Talley and country music legend, Leona Williams, opened many doors for the petite Texan.\n\nLiz recalled, ‘Radio just went crazy over it and before I knew it, the song was getting airplay everywhere, even landing on Willies Place / Sirius XM Radio. I think people were excited to hear something different’.\n\n‘Texas In Your Swing’ (written by Liz Talley and Leona Williams) was nominated for several awards and Liz Talley won ‘Western Swing-Female Vocalist’ at the Academy of Western Artists Awards. The song was also featured in a commercial for Gabby’s Barbeque.\n\nAnother highlight on Liz Talley’s ‘Road To You’ (Armadillo Records, 2006) was ‘It’s Time To Cross That Bridge’, which was a duet with Billy Yates, and was nominated for several awards and is a favourite among the fans.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of country music legends Johnny Bush (Sunday 17 February 1935 – Friday 16 October 2020) and Jack Greene (Tuesday 7 January 1930 – Thursday 15 March 2013), Liz Talley started playing drums at the age of fourteen. Liz recalled, ‘There were dance-halls everywhere in town, with live music seven days a week. My parents had to take me to the clubs because I was underage. I was making a lot of money back then, bought a car and was putting myself through college’.\n\nIt wasn’t until the bands started getting requests for girl songs that Liz Talley started singing. She further recalled, ‘I was a very quiet kid, with severe stage-fright! I was perfectly content blending in with the band, but people started requesting Tanya Tucker and Patsy Cline (Thursday 8 September 1932 – Tuesday 5 March 1963) material, so I had to start singing!’\n\nLiz Talley, that ‘little drummer girl from Texas’, has played drums for Tommy Cash, Wanda Jackson, Tony Booth, Frenchie Burke and Barbara Fairchild.\n\nLiz Talley has also opened shows for a number of acclaimed country music artists, including Mel Tillis (Monday 8 August 1932 – Sunday 19 November 2017), Eddy Raven and Gene Watson.\n\nIn 2009, Liz Talley saw the release of her second album, ‘More Than Satisfied’ (Diamond Music Group, 2009), which received as much media attention as her debut album.\n\nLiz Talley’s ‘More Than Satisfied’ (Diamond Music Group, 2009) was a continuation of that traditional country sound with everything from Western Swing to heart wrenching ballads, including a remake of Asleep at The Wheel’s ‘Bump Bounce Boogie’ and a bouncy tongue-in-cheek tune ‘Johnny’s Getting Out of Jail BBQ!’.\n\nIn choosing material for the new album, Liz Talley went to songwriters with a similar style to hers. ‘More Than Satisfied’ (Diamond Music Group, 2009) contained pure country music, honky tonk music and Texas shuffles, with song-writing credits including Becky Hobbs, Leona Williams, Melba Montgomery, Lacy J. Dalton & Fred Koller, Don Williams (Saturday 27 May 1939 – Friday 8 September 2017) & Bob McDill, Billy Yates and Dave Kirby (Sunday 10 July 1938 – Saturday 17 April 2004).\n\nLiz Talley’s second album, ‘More Than Satisfied’ (Diamond Music Group, 2009), included the following tracks:\n\n‘I’m Not That Good At Goodbye’, which was written by Don Williams (Saturday 27 May 1939 – Friday 8 September 2017) and Bob Mc Dill\n\n‘You Can’t Take The Texas Out of Me’ (written by Lacy J. Dalton and Fred Koller)\n\n‘One Man’s Angel’ (written by Becky Hobbs)\n\n‘Reading Mama’s Bible’ (written by Becky Hobbs)\n\n‘What We Don’t Have’ (written by Billy Yates) / this track was a duet with Tony Booth\n\n‘The Way It Was’ (written by Leona Williams)\n\n‘Johnny Getting Out of Jail Barbeque’, which was written by Leona Williams and Dave Kirby (Sunday 10 July 1938 – Saturday 17 April 2004)"
