        "text": "Hobbs History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nThe Hobbs family name is linked to the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture of Britain. Their name comes from the son of Robert. 1 2\n\n\"Hob, patronymic Hobbs and Hobson. Naturally these surnames have left many descendants. Owing to its popularity Hob became the everyday term for a country clown.\" 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Hobbs family\n\nThe surname Hobbs was first found in Shropshire where the name first entry was as a forename as in Hobbe Litel, who was listed in the Pipe Rolls of 1176. A few years later, Hobb(e) (with no forename) was listed in the Curia Regis Rolls for Northumberland in 1198, the Pipe Rolls for Yorkshire and the Curia Regis Rolls for Worcester in 1205. These entries may be of the same person, but that is doubtful. Moving on, Osbert, Ralph Hobbe was found in the Pipe Rolls for Rutland in 1204, and again in the Pipe Rolls for Warwickshire in 1230. Isabella Hobbes was in the Subsidy Rolls for Worcester in 1327. 4\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 included: Agnes Hobbis, Huntingdonshire; and John Hobbe, Oxfordshire. 3\n\nIn Somerset, John Hobbes and William Hobbeson, were both listed 1 Edward III (during the first year of King Edward III's reign). 5\n\nLater, the Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379 listed: Willelmus Hobbes; Petrus Hobbeson; Willelmus Hobbeson; and Robertus Hobson. 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Hobbs family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Hobbs research.

Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents. One person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. The recorded variations of Hobbs include Hobbs, Hobs, Hobbes, Hobis, Hopp, Hoppe, Hopps and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Hobbs family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include\n\nThomas Hobbs (also spelled Hobbes) (1588-1679), English philosopher, pioneer of modern political science and at one time a mathematics tutor to Charles II.

Although the search for opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad took the lives of many because of the cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels, the opportunity perceived in the growing colonies of North America beckoned. Many of the settlers who survived the journey went on to make important contributions to the transplanted cultures of their adopted countries. The Hobbs were among these contributors, for they have been located in early North American records:\n\nHobbs Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nThomas Hobbs, aged 22, who settled in Virginia in 1635 aboard the ship \"Assurance\"\n\nThomas Hobbs, who settled in Providence in 1635\n\nJone Hobbs, who landed in Virginia in 1643 11\n\nGeorge Hobbs, who arrived in Virginia in 1650 11\n\nIsaac Hobbs, who arrived in Virginia in 1651 11\n\n...
