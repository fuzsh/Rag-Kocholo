        "text": "John and Nancy Lasseter first met at a computer graphics conference in San Francisco in 1985. They shared a love of storytelling, and soon discovered they both loved wine as well. In pursuit of this mutual passion, they would escape to Wine Country for romantic getaways, and they chose Sonoma County for their honeymoon. In the early ‘90’s they moved to Sonoma Valley, where they felt they could put down roots in a small town and raise their five children. Once established in the community, they quickly caught the wine bug; and by 1997 they were bottling up their own Bordeaux blend to give out as Christmas gifts. Soon after, Lasseter Family Winery was born. As passionate about conservation as they are about wine quality, their historic estate vineyard is farmed organically, accompanied by a state-of-the-art, eco-friendly winery.\n\nJenifer’s love of wine was sparked and nurtured in her hometown of Los Angeles where she spent her post-university years composing, recording and performing music, while being mentored by top sommeliers over the course of many years in restaurant service and management. Her move to Sebastopol in 2002 made for an auspicious first harvest and full immersion into winery marketing, sales, operations, and production at Paul Hobbs Wines where she spent the next twelve years.\n\nHer additional leadership roles include Kosta Browne Wine, Grgich Hills Cellars, and others as a consultant. She continues to compose and perform, and serves as Treasurer on the Sonoma County Parks Foundation Board of Directors. She is a passionate advocate of the parks, their life-changing youth programs, and commitment to accessibility for all.\n\nOur original estate was an enclave for the earliest French winemakers in California in the 1890s. Under the care of the Lasseters, it as been painstakingly restored and reimagined with great attention to detail, and is the site of a small, eco-friendly, state-of-the-art winery.\n\nThis site benefits from being a warmer area within the valley, but also the narrowest section, resulting in a funnel that concentrates the cool ocean breezes and creates huge diurnal shifts that allow for long hang time and full flavor development with good acid retention.\n\nThe Upper Bench Blocks are situated above the valley floor, on undulating terrain. The quick draining, cobbly soils of these blocks are ideal for the red Bordeaux varieties Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec.\n\nThe Heritage Blocks, the warmest location on the estate, include a century-old Zinfandel block that speaks to the Italian heritage of the area. Planted in 1919, it is a classic field blend of Zinfandel and eight other varieties (in descending order: Cabernet Franc, Alicante, Petite Sirah, Grand Noir de la Calmette, Peloursin, Lenoir, Merlot, Mourvedre). Specific blocks were redeveloped in traditional goblet style, including the red Rhône varieties Grenache, Mourvèdre and Counoise, with the remainder planted to Syrah and Merlot.\n\nThe Creekside Blocks sit along the east side of Calabazas Creek. With rocky soils over an alluvial fan, they hold the original planting of red Rhône varieties on the property: Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre. More recent plantings in the Train Block and Crescent Oaks Block, include Semillon along with additional Mourvèdre and Grenache vines all planted in goblet style.\n\nStone’s Throw is the most recently acquired of the Lasseter vineyards and is named for its proximity to Justi Creek Vineyards. This site, just a “Stone’s Throw” from our original vineyards, is a natural addition to our estate, given the similar soil types and microclimate. It is being developed to red Rhône Varieties."
