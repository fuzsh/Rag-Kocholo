        "text": "Dr. Raiszadeh’s passion for non-operative treatment started by realizing that many patients undergoing surgery for neck or back pain were not getting their desired long-term results.\n\nAfter completing undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley, Dr. Raiszadeh completed medical school at UC San Francisco, an orthopedic surgery residency at UC Davis, and his Pediatric and Adult Spine Fellowship at the Hospital for Joint Diseases/NYU in New York City. He has 20 years of experience with a broad range of spine surgery including minimally invasive surgery, complex spinal disorders such as scoliosis and kyphosis, and cervical spine disorders. During these 20 years he has noticed a dramatic increase in patients turning to surgery for treatment of neck and low back pain, but many of them not getting their desired long-term results. He, therefore, became increasingly interested in the improvement and standardization of non-operative treatment. By developing the best aspects of non-operative treatment in an atmosphere of empowerment to maximize the body’s own healing capacity, he noticed that many fewer patients required surgery, and the ones who underwent surgery had much better long-term results.\n\nLissa graduated from San Diego State University with a degree in Kinesiology: Athletic Training and then obtained her Doctorate of Physical Therapy from the University of Saint Augustine.\n\nAs a Certified Athletic Trainer, Lissa has worked with over 23 intercollegiate sports programs including UCSD’s 2011 NCAA Women’s National Softball Champions.
