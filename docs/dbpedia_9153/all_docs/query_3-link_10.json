This sickening tragedy should have never happened. I had to write this song.\n\nAnn Marie\n\nThis song was inspired by an article I read 54 years ago when I was in high school about a desperate young woman who had to resort to an illegal backstreet abortion and died at age seventeen. We cannot ever go back to those times.Every woman should have the right to make her own reproductive decisions.\n\nDestination Catoosa\n\nIn 2021 fellow Cherokee Betsy Swimmer booked me to play a concert for Native Arts Alliance in Catoosa, OK and asked me if I would consider writing a song called \"Destination Catoosa\" to debut at the show. I was thrilled to oblige! It went over so well that I recorded it a few months later. \"Western Swing\" music always makes me happy!\n\nOklahoma Music Shop\n\nIn 2015, I was at the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in Muskogee, OK talking with dear friend, the late great Jim Paul Blair, and he told me about a new cable TV series that he was spearheading called \"Oklahoma Music Shop,\" that would feature Oklahoma artists. He said they were looking for a theme song, so I jumped on it!\n\nCelebrate America\n\nIn 2013 I joined DAR expressly to honor my fifth-great grandmother Nancy Ward, Beloved Woman of the Cherokee (aka Nanyehi) who was honored as a Patriot during the Revolutionary War. In 2015 this song won first place in the National DAR Music Category. The theme was \"Celebrate America\" and I got to play and sing it on stage at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C.\n\nAll Keyed Up\n\nThis song was the title track to my 1988 album that originally came out on MTM Records, then later on RCA/BMG. I put it out as a single after a line dancing club in Sweden put choreography to it.\n\nTsa La Gi - We Are Many\n\nIn 2010 at the Cherokee National Holiday in Tahlequah, OK, dear friend Gary White mentioned to me that, as far as he knew, the Cherokee Nation did not have a national anthem. That planted a bee in my bonnet, and on the drive back to Nashville, the song started coming! The Cherokee National Youth Choir recorded it, and performed it with me and fellow Cherokee opera great Barbara McAlister at Principal Chief Bill John Baker's inaugurations and state-of-the-nation addresses.\n\nDownload or Stream\n\nThese are available in CD format:\n\nBEST OF THE BECKAROO: $25.
