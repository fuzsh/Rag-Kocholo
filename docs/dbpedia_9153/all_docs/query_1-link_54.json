        "text": "What does shipping cost?\n\nWe have a range of options for shipping and delivery:\n\n- Standard postage within lutruwita/Tasmania is $8\n\n- Express postage within lutruwita/Tasmania is $14.\n\n- Standard postage to mainland Australia is $12.\n\n- Express shipping to mainland Australia is $18.\n\n- Standard shipping is FREE for all orders within Australia over $150.\n\n- Standard shipping to NZ is $22.\n\n- Express shipping to NZ is $32.\n\n- Local Pick-upis FREE and contactless, from our store during opening hours.\n\nLarge/heavy parcels may incur an additional shipping fee. We'll contact you to confirm delivery costs and any additional payment required.\n\nPostage options will be offered to you at checkout. We will contact you if an additional shipping payment is required for your order.\n\nTracking is included on all items posted.\n\nInsurance is available on all parcels over $100, for an additional fee. Please contact us if you require this service.\n\nHow soon will I receive my order?\n\nYour order will be shipped within 3 business days, unless we are exceptionally busy. All parcels are sent via Australia Post and if you're outside Tasmania will usually take between 5-6 days after shipping, to reach you. Orders to New Zealand will take 6+ business days after shipping. Express post parcels will generally be received between 1-2 days after shipping. The delivery time will vary depending on your location. Please check your Australia Post Network for actual delivery times and allow extra time for delivery at busy times, like Christmas. If you require a parcel urgently, please let us know and we will endeavour to send it out within 24 hours. Please note, postage is currently slower than usual, due to COVID19.\n\nOrders are packed using a protective cardboard mailer, or re-used cardboard boxes. Where extra padding is needed, we use compostable honeycomb wrap, re-used bubble wrap, recycled brown paper, or re-used clean paper. We use brown paper tape and eco-shipping labels. All packaging materials can be composted in your home compost system, recycled, or used as sheet mulch.\n\nOf course, the elephant in the room is that you're buying plastic. It's our preference to stock well made, second-hand records, and those made from recycled or bio-plastic content, where possible. Our hope is that you'll take them home and love them for life.\n\nAll records come in a sturdy, clear, 90 microns CPP plastic sleeve. Seriously damaged or missing inner sleeves will be replaced with poly-lined paper sleeves. These are are not intended to be single-use plastic, but are intended to provide long-term archival protection for your records, so they last a lifetime, if well cared for. Please let us know if you'd rather not receive your record in a plastic sleeve.\n\nAll our shipping is carbon off-set.\n\nAll packaging materials we receive are re-used for postage, recycled (plastics only), or composted in our garden.\n\nIf you find an item in your order is damaged, faulty or not as described, please email us with photos and a clear description of the problem, within 7 days, to organise replacement of goods, or full refund of the product value.\n\nWe do not accept returns from customers who have changed their mind about a product. This is because we understand the environmental impact and waste involved in packaging and shipping parcels across the country, and aim to discourage fast and wasteful consumerism where possible. We aim to provide clear descriptions on all product listings and we're very happy to assist you in making your purchase. We want you to be thrilled about what you choose. Please choose wisely.\n\nCondition grading of preloved vinyl\n\nWe grade the cover (sleeve) and vinyl (record) separately, so you know what you’re getting.\n\nThe price label will show an abbreviated rating – first, the rating for the cover, and second, a rating for the vinyl record (e.g. VG/VG+).\n\nThe grading categories are:\n\nNear Mint (NM)\n\nThe cover (sleeve) should have no creases, folds, seam splits, or noticeable defects.\n\nThe record will be in near perfect condition with no imperfections during playback. It may have evidence of slight handling.\n\nVery Good Plus (VG+)\n\nThe cover may have slight wear, indents, cut marks or a slight split seam.\n\nThe record will show some signs that it has been played. Any defects should be cosmetic and not affect playback. The record may show some signs of wear and have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don't affect the listening experience.\n\nVery Good (VG)\n\nThe cover may have some signs of wear and noticeable indentations or cut marks. Any ring wear should be faint. Labels may be marred by writing or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached.\n\nThe record may emit surface noise upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song's intro and fade but will not overpower the music. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches that will affect the sound.\n\nGood Plus (G+), Good (G)\n\nThe sleeve will have seam splits. Tape, writing, ring wear, or other defects will be present.\n\nA record in Good or Good Plus condition can be played through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise, scratches, and visible groove wear.\n\nFair (F), Poor (P)\n\nThe sleeve barely keeps the record inside it. Inner sleeves are fully split, crinkled, and written upon.\n\nThe record is cracked, badly warped, and won't play through without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily marred by wear and writing."
