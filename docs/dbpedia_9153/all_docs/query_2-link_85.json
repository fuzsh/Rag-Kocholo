        "text": "(Cushing, Okla.) If you haven’t tuned in to KUSH radio lately, you are missing out – because exciting things continue to happen! Along with local notables, we have had numerous musical guests come through our doors for an on-air visit.\n\nJust this week (Oct 26, 2015), we have had musical guests in studio everyday. So far we’ve had The Voice alums, Dawn & Hawkes and Chase Kerby in studio, along with members of the Jason Young Band. The music continues Thursday and Friday with local favorites Kaitlin Butts at 9 a.m. Thursday and Brandon Jackson at 9 a.m. on Friday.\n\nBut that’s not all...we are extending the show Thursday to welcome recent Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame inductee Becky Hobbs and actress Michelle Honaker in studio to talk about the musical Nanyehi: The Story of Nancy Ward. Joining them will be producer for Nanyehi, David Webb.\n\nYou can listen at 1600 AM, or by clicking on the Listen Live link of our website (www.1600kush.com) or on your smart phone or tablet by downloading the free tunein radio app – just type in 1600 KUSH. We hope you join us!\n\nBecky Hobbs (Composer, co-playwright and music director) – Born and raised in Bartlesville, she is the 5th-great granddaughter of Nancy Ward (Nanyehi) and a Cherokee Nation citizen. Her song, “Angels Among Us,” recorded by Alabama, has been used to raise money for numerous charities throughout the world. Other songs of hers have been recorded by Conway Twitty, George Jones, Loretta Lynn, Glen Campbell, Emmylou Harris, Helen Reddy, Shirley Bassey, Wanda Jackson, Janie Fricke, the Cherokee National Youth Choir and more. As a recording artist, she’s had over 20 Billboard chart singles, including “Jones on the Jukebox,” “Honky Tonk Staurday Night,” and Top Ten Duet with Moe Bandy, “Let’s Get Over Them Together.” The “Beckaroo” has performed in over 40 countries and lives in Nashville, Tennessee with husband, Duane Sciacqua. She was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame on Oct. 16, 2015.\n\nMichelle Honaker (Nanyehi) – Thrilled to reprise her role of Nanyehi for the fourth time, Michelle currently lives in New York City where she actively works with AMERINDA, an organization dedication to supporting Native American artists and culture. Inspired by her Cherokee heritage, she spent two seasons performing in the outdoor drama “Unto These Hills” (Nancy) in Cherokee, N.C. Honaker received her Bachelor’s Degree in Musical Theatre from Young Harris College and her Stage Combat Certifications from the Society of American Fight Directors. Her Off-Broadway credits include “Miss Lead” (Robyn), “Daughters of Leda” (Iphigenia), and “Macbeth” (Malcolm/Witch). Michelle gives all the glory to the Lord and sends her love and gratitude to Beckaroo, Nick, her parents and the Cherokee People for their support.\n\nDavid Webb (Producer) – After putting up posters for Jim Halsey, David started a booking agency. Becky Hobbs’, “The Four Faces of Eve” was one of those bands David moved to Lawrence, Kansas as an agent for Mid-Continent Entertainment. A move to Chicago, led him to work with Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon. He became a partner in Chicago based Celebration Productions. David became VP of Sales and Marketing for Ovation Records. Big hits by country duo, The Kendalls, “Heaven’s Just A Sin Away,” led Jim Halsey to offer David a position as VP of Sales and Marketing at Churchill/MCA. There, David worked with artists, Roy Clark, Hank Thompson, and Ronnie Dunn (Brooks and Dunn). He then worked and managed James Brown. David served two terms a Vice President of the GRAMMY organization. David worked at KVOO, and was a Group VP/GM for stations in four states. David retired from IMG two years ago. He currently serves as a member of the Board of Directors for the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.\n\nNanyehi is the story of Nancy Ward (Becky Hobbs’ 5th-great grandmother), a legendary woman who was first honored in the 18th century as a Cherokee war woman, but then as a peacemaker during the American Revolution. The musical is written by Nashville-based, award-winning songwriter Becky Hobbs and playwright Nick Sweet.\n\nPerformances times and dates:\n\nThursday, Nov. 5, 2015 – 7:30 p.m. @ The Joint (Hard Rock Casino, Catoosa, OK)\n\nFriday, Nov. 6, 2015 – 7:30 p.m. @ The Joint (Hard Rock Casino, Catoosa, OK)\n\nSaturday, Nov. 7, 2015 – 7:30 p.m. @ The Joint (Hard Rock Casino, Catoosa, OK)\n\nShows are for all ages.
