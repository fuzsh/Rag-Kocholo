        "text": "Music and Text: Don Goodman and Becky Hobbs\n\nArrangement: Sam Cardon\n\nGrammy-nominated songwriter Don Goodman and country singer Becky Hobbs wrote “Angels Among Us” for the popular country band Alabama, who recorded it on their 1993 Cheap Seats album.\n\nThough it is not explicitly a Christmas song, “Angels Among Us” was performed at this concert against a backdrop of images that focused on selfless service and generosity, honoring the unsung heroes whose angel-like service embodies the true spirit of Christmas. They are the healers, defenders, protectors, teachers, volunteers, activists, and caregivers who, through their devoted acts of service and kindness, “show us how to live… teach us how to give, [and] guide us with the light of love.”"
