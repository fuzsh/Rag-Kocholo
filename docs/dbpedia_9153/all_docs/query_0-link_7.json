After retiring from Kraft, and missing the need for speed, he opted for the next best thing, Air Races in Reno, NV. His love for aviation and photography gave him the opportunity to travel to air shows and photograph many different types of aircraft. He was drawn towards WWII aircraft because many of those planes matched the airplane models that he built in his teenage years.\n\nFour years ago, Joe signed up as a volunteer with the WWII Airborne Demonstration Team. He became a frequent member of the team in the restoration of two WWII aircraft, “Wild Kat” a C-49 and “That’s All --- Brother”, a C-47.

The team restored the aircraft, and it flew to Normandy for the 75th anniversary of D-Day in 2019. Joe was able to join with the team overseas as they were in France when “That’s All---Brother\" flew over and dropped its paratroopers during the celebration. His love for aviation has come full circle with his creating the aviation artwork, designing and writing of this book, and telling the stories of these incredible machines.\n\nJoe has a Master of Photography, Photographic Craftsman and Master Artist degrees from the Professional Photographers of America organization. He is also a member in good standing with the American Society of Photographers, as well as a photographic instructor through various PPA affiliated schools and KelbyOne on-line training.\n\nKatey Sherrick Blair is employed as a BID Assistance Coordinator for Indian Capital Technology Center in Muskogee, Ok., where she counsels and advises business owners in the bidding and performance process with government contracting.
