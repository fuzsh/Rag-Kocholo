Get acquainted with other museums and cultural hotspots? And sometimes just have a complete nerd-a-thon about history and culture with some geeky museum folks? Then Museum Talk is the show for you! Merging with BCM’s Radio Bristol Book Club (every fourth Thursday of the month), you can join hosts Scotty Almany, Erika Barker, and René Rodgers on the other Thursdays at Noon to explore all things museum-y, hear some tunes, and meet interesting people across the airwaves!"
