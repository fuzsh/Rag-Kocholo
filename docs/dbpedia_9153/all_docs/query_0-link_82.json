        "text": "Register Today\n\nMake sure to register early for 2025 as the 2024 Wingfoot Running Camp SOLD OUT both weeks!\n\nAtlanta Track Club's cross country camp returns to the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2025. Middle and high school runners are invited to Wingfoot Running Camp at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. With 51 years of tradition and nestled in the foothills of the southern Appalachian mountains, this week-long overnight camp is led by college, high school, and elite coaches with college runners serving as camp counselors. The staff coaches alone have a combined total of over 500 years of camp experience and have coached more than 150 individual and team state champions! Guest appearances will be made by college/professional coaches, college/elite athletes, and experts in competitive running at the top of their fields. Educational sessions will cover proper running technique, speed, form, and team building. Runners will also learn about a wide range of running-related topics including nutrition, sports psychology and footwear. Wingfoot Running Camp is open to all entrants between the ages of 12 - 18, currently enrolled in middle or high school. Camp fees include all meals and accommodations in air-conditioned \"suite style\" dormitories with private restrooms.\n\nIn addition to a week-long camp experience, Wingfoot Running Camp offers a two-week session for campers. It's a great opportunity to relive previous trail experiences, enhance their training, and make new friends. The second week of Wingfoot Running Camp will feature different guest speakers, opportunities to sit in on new educational sessions, and more fun evening activities. Supervised activities and runs will be planned for the two days between camps, and housing will be provided. Campers should be prepared to pay for meals outside of the cafeteria and expect some free time.\n\nThe Coaches' Clinic is a week-long educational program led by veteran coaches and clinicians Eric Nelson and Tom Williams. Developed specifically for new and early to mid-career coaches, foundational topics are covered in-depth with opportunities for one-on-one mentoring. This clinic will prepare any coach for the upcoming season and many years to come. Networking opportunities with advanced practitioners and veteran coaches throughout the southeast will be provided and any head or assistant coach will find value in its instruction. More details can be found below. Coaches' meals and accommodations in air-conditioned \"suite style\" dormitories with private restrooms are included in the registration fee.\n\nWingfoot Running Camp and its accompanying Coaches' Clinic is solely operated by Atlanta Track Club, which is not affiliated with The Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama or The University of Alabama in Huntsville.\n\nView the highlight video of 2024's Week 1 of camp here or read an intern's blog of her camp experience here.
