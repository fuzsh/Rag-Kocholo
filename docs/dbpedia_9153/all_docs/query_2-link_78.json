        "text": "Some American Indians won’t even use $20 bills\n\nGrowing up in Oklahoma, Becky Hobbs noticed some of her Cherokee elders wouldn’t even touch a $20 bill because they so despised Andrew Jackson. To this day, the 66-year-old songwriter pokes him in the face whenever she gets one.\n\nFor Hobbs and many other American Indians, the U.S. Treasury’s decision to replace Jackson’s portrait with Harriet Tubman is a hugely meaningful change.\n\nA slave-owning president who forced Cherokees and many other Indian nations on deadly marches out of their southern homelands, being succeeded by an African-American abolitionist who risked her life to free others? Unprecedented.\n\n“We’re just thrilled that Andrew Jackson has had a removal of his own,” Hobbs said. “The constant reminder of Andrew Jackson being glorified is sad and sickening to our people.”\n\nMaking the change on currency is especially powerful, said Suzan Shown Harjo, president of the Morning Star Institute, a Native rights organization.\n\n“A country usually puts forward its best when it shows the world the people on a stamp or on money,” said Harjo, who is both Cheyenne and Muskogee. “They’re really saying, ‘This is what we want you to think of us ... these are our best people.’ ”\n\nA symbol of genocide\n\nCompared to all his predecessors, Jackson, who served in 1828-36, arrived at the White House as a self-made everyman whose populist message resonated with a country still solidifying its democracy a half-century after declaring independence. But for American Indians, Jackson stands for genocide — the polar opposite of a unifying figure.\n\n“He’s not the poster boy for America, and it’s good to see it changed,” said Bill John Baker, principal chief of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nBaker points out that a fourth of the Cherokees died after Jackson and his troops forced them onto what became known as the Trail of Tears. Other tribes that were forced to move to reservations in Oklahoma and beyond include the Seminoles, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Muscogee-Creek.\n\nMany Americans still celebrate Jackson for his victory over the British during the War of 1812. General Jackson then orchestrated the invasion of Florida in 1818, and convinced the Spanish government a year later to give up the territory. Along the way, he warred against American Indians — although some were his allies for brief periods — and his 1830 Indian Removal Act expanded U.S. territory at a critical time.\n\n“As horrible a policy as it was, it was something that was widely appreciated by many voters at the time,” said Andrew Frank, a historian at Florida State University.\n\nA ‘complicated guy’\n\nOn the centennial of his election, Jackson’s legacy was honored by promoting him to the $20 bill, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton replaced Jackson on $10 bills as the first modern-sized currency notes began circulating in 1929.\n\n“We won’t stop promoting his legacy,” said Howard Kittell, president and CEO of the Andrew Jackson Foundation, which operates Jackson’s historic home, the Hermitage, in Tennessee.\n\n“He’s a complicated guy, especially when you look at him and assess him from a perspective of 20th-Century values. We don’t try to varnish over the fact that he was a slaveholder and helped push the Indian Removal Act through Congress. But within his historical period, that was within the mainstream thinking.”\n\nNot quite, said Ed Baptist, history professor at Cornell University.\n\n“At the time, there were alternatives — there were congressmen who suggested alternatives. The Indian Removal Act was contested, there were lots of folks who opposed it.”"
