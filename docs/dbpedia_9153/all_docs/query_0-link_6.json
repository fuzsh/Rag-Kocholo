        "text": "FORT PAYNE, Alabama - The story behind the bronze statues of four men is central in this DeKalb County town of about 12,000 people. They are figures of natives Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry and Jeff Cook, who were later joined by Mark Herndon to form the country music band Alabama, for whom the phrase \"super group\" was formed.\n\nBut those who stop to see the tribute to the Country Music Hall of Fame inductees, or to visit the Alabama Fan Club and Museum on Glenn Avenue, may be unaware of the tale of an eerie premonition that resulted in the song \"Angels Among Us,\" a Christmastime favorite that has touched countless lives since it debuted in 1993, and led to the miraculous recovery of a comatose girl in 1996.\n\nNot long before Christmas of 1985, Nashville songwriter Becky Hobbs began having strange feelings of pending doom. She would wake in a sweat from nightmares of a crash and think, \"I'm not ready to die.\"\n\nOn her birthday, Jan. 25, 1986, Hobbs was traveling with members of her band from a benefit performance in Albertville. It was pouring rain. The band's van had stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of a four-lane highway when Hobbs looked up to see an 18-wheeler racing along the highway.\n\nSuddenly, the traffic light turned green for the van to move ahead. Hobbs realized the tractor-trailer rig was traveling too fast to stop and realized the band's road manager didn't see the oncoming truck. She yelled, \"Stop!\"\n\nJust as the road manager hit the brakes, the truck collided with the van. The trailer carrying the band's equipment was ripped from the back and the van was totaled, but its occupants had, miraculously, suffered only minimal injuries. If the van's driver hadn't slammed on the brakes, they likely would have been killed.\n\nThat's when Hobbs realized: the voice she'd heard the day before was that of her guardian angel. She scribbled down a song title, \"Angels Among Us.\" For several years, she would think about lyrics to go with the title. Then, at Christmas 1992, while sitting in her late dad's recliner, she got another feeling: Finish the song. Working with friend and fellow songwriter Don Goodman, she did.\n\nAngels in Alabama\n\nHobbs sent a tape of the song to Randy Owen of Fort Payne, lead singer of the country music group Alabama.\n\nOwen said he immediately liked the song and had a strange feeling about. It was different from any song the band had recorded. As he typically did, Owen played the song for his wife and children. His youngest daughter, who was three at the time, loved the song. \"She would say, 'Daddy, you've got to do that song about angels,\" Owen said in an interview for the book \"Christmas Tales of Alabama.\"\n\nAlabama eventually recorded the song.\n\nMuch to the surprise of Hobbs and Owen, when radio stations finally did begin playing the song, they played it at Christmastime. Neither believed angels were only around at Christmas.\n\nThe song became one of the group's biggest hits.\n\n\"It changed Alabama's career for the better,\" Owen says. \"To this day, a lot of people don't know anymore about Alabama than 'Angels Among Us' and 'Christmas in Dixie' ...You can do some really magical things with music.\"\n\nThe girl who came out of the coma\n\nIn 1996, a little girl in Virginia lay critically injured in a hospital bed. While out shopping for Christmas gifts, 9-year-old Heather Harcum, her mother and younger sister were involved in a three-car wreck. Penny Harcum and 6-year-old Holly were unharmed but Heather suffered bruises and swelling of her brain. For 12 days, she lay comatose. On Dec. 12, Penny had the idea to bring a tape player to the hospital and play Heather's favorite song. She retrieved a tape of \"Angles Among Us,\" which she and Heather's dad, Jim, had already tucked in Heather's Christmas stocking for her to find Christmas morning. The song had always made them cry because it made them think of relatives who had died.\n\nAs soon as the music started, Penny saw tears coming from her daughter's closed eyes. Penny crawled into the hospital bed with her little girl and whispered,\" I love you\" and asked Heather to say it to her. Heather gave a muffled, \"I love you.\"\n\nThen she awoke from the coma.\n\nRandy Owen and members of Alabama heard the news and invited the entire Harcum family, Penny and her husband Jim, Heather and Holly, to see their first Alabama concert in February in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nOwen said meeting Heather and her family that night was \"very emotional in a very positive way.\" Then he asked, \"How do you fathom something like that?\"\n\nHobbs, though, feels there is a reason behind each event that led to Heather's recovery.\n\n\"Maybe writing this song was one of the reasons I wasn't taken on Jan. 25, 1986,\" she said.\n\nThe Alabama Fan Club and Museum is located at 101 Glenn Boulevard SW in Fort Payne.
