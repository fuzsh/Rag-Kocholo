Through his work on major/mega ($1.5B to $3B) highway corridors, Michael has been directly involved in saving the State of Texas more than $1B through design and construction refinements, deferment strategies and optimization efforts.\n\nPrior to joining Archer Western Construction (a member of The Walsh Group family of companies) in July 2016, Michael held key management positions during his 24-year career with Jacobs Engineering.\n\nMichael held multiple corporate management functions at Jacobs, including Bridge Group Manager and Business Development Manager (Chicago), Transportation Group Manager, Outside Sales Lead and Operations Manager (North Texas), Regional Quality Manager, and Vice President of Divisional Operations for the Buildings and Infrastructure Americas Group.\n\nHolding an M.S. from the University of Illinois and a B.S. in Civil Engineering from Southern Illinois University, Michael’s technical background includes analyzing and designing steel and concrete bridge structures, including major river bridges for highways, Heavy and Light-Rail structures and advanced seismic analysis. His career also includes technical experience with highway and drainage design, bridge aesthetic concepts and design, field engineering (construction inspection and management), construction consultation and bridge erection procedures.\n\nMichael understands all perspectives and the complete dynamics of complex mega projects, having served as both Owner Engineer and Developer Engineer for notable projects such as the $2.5B LBJ Managed Lanes Project, $1.8B Chisholm Trail Parkway and the $1.1B Ohio River Bridges East End Crossing PPP. In addition, Michael has served in an Executive Management capacity on multiple projects, including the $2.3B I-4 Ultimate PPP in Orlando, Florida. In these roles, Michael has functioned at a high-level of business and organizational executive leadership to balance the interests of Owners, Contractors and stakeholders with the contractual and technical project requirements.\n\nEstablished in 1983, Archer Western is a nationally-leading general contractor and proven performer in a wide range of projects in the building, civil, transportation and water sectors.\n\nArcher Western is a member of the Walsh family of companies, a 118-year-old, family-owned business group in its fourth generation of leadership providing general contracting, construction management and comprehensive design-build services. The Walsh Group is consistently listed among the nation’s Top 20 Contractors in Engineering News-Record’s Top 400, and has held the top spot as the Nation’s #1 Bridge Builder for 4 years running (2012-2016).\n\nThe Walsh Group offers seamlessly integrated services to plan, finance, build, operate and maintain the full life-cycle of a project. Each of our projects demand unique, client-focused solutions, built on the solid knowledge base we’ve developed from our diverse portfolio. The result is a broad range of multi-faceted services – executed via a proven, highly disciplined process."
