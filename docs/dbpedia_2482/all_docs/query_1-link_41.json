He served as Chair of the Computer Science Department and as the Associate Vice-President Information Technology at UWO. He has served on and chaired NSERC’s Computer Science Discovery Grant review committee and has served on other NSERC committees. He is Scientific Director of SHARCNET, a multi-university high performance computing consortium (www.sharcnet.ca) which operates one of Canada’s national supercomputing facilities. He is also co-chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee for SOSCIP, an academic-industry initiative for applied research (www.soscip.org). He has also received the Excellence in Teaching Award from the University of Western Ontario and the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations Teaching Award.\n\nProfessor Bauer’s research interests include the design, implementation and management of distributed applications and systems, policy-driven autonomic computing, most recently focusing on applications and systems dealing with the Internet of Things and cloud computing, particularly in managing, monitoring and modelling smart city environments. He has explored the design and implementation of cloud computing environments to support high throughput computing for data analytics, and the use of cloud-based computational services for near real-time computing of results from stream-based data sources as well as the application of and use of data analytics tools as cloud services. He also has an interest in data analytics methods, including machine learning, for the analysis of health and medical data with the aim of discovering associations and developing predictive models. Some recent work in this area in collaboration with researchers in health sciences has focused on the use of mobile applications for the collection of data about students with the aim of exploring indicators of changes in student behavior that may be suggestive of mental stress. Dr. Bauer has also looked the development of methods to enhance intelligent driver assistance systems including looking at automated methods of inferring and predicting driving behaviour and the use of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure for data sharing among vehicles in order to enhance driver assistance systems.\n\nDr. Bauer has published over 250 peer-reviewed articles, has supervised 8 postdoctoral fellows, 19 PhD students, 80 MSc students and 111 undergraduate students and has been the Principle Investigator on research grants of over $6M. He has served on the organizing and program committee of numerous conferences and has refereed for a variety of international journals and is a member of the ACM and IEEE.."
