        "text": "Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine, Sports Medicine\n\nDr. Michael Bauer is a founding partner and Chief Medical Officer of Freedom Health Systems. As a dual board-certified physician in both Sports Medicine and Family Medicine, he is able to treat a wide range of patients from acute sick visits to complicated orthopedic injuries.\n\nDr. Bauer attended medical school at the University of Missouri-Columbia and completed his residency in Family Medicine at Halifax Hospital in Daytona Beach, Florida. He then went on to complete a Sports Medicine Fellowship at the University of South Carolina. Dr. Bauer was a team physician for USC’s football, basketball, baseball, soccer, cross country and equestrian programs. He also provided medical coverage for the Columbia City Ballet.\n\nFor the past 5 years, Dr. Bauer practiced Orthopedics and Occupational Medicine at a local hospital until he decided to develop his own healthcare system, along with his wife, Kelbie Bauer PA-C. Dr. Bauer is passionate about medical freedom and giving his patient’s options instead of dictating their care. He enjoys working with his patients to develop a treatment plan that gives his patients confidence to better their health while encouraging them every step of the way.\n\nDr. Bauer will be opening his dedicated orthopedic practice in Ozark at Freedom Health Systems in the coming weeks. He will be able to provide x-rays (ON SITE!) along with treatment of acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries. He is also specially trained in ultrasound guided injections.\n\nDr. Bauer looks forward to serving his community and giving his patients the fantastic care they deserve."
