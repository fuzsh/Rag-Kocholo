Most recently, he served as president of The Master Lock Company (the Security segment of Fortune Brands Home & Security) from 2014 to 2018.\n\nMr Orr continued: “Mike’s extensive experience and track record of success leading strategy, growth and margin expansion in multi-channel, global consumer product organizations are a strong fit for Libbey.\n\n“We are confident that Mike, working together with our strong management team, will help us leverage and expand upon our position as the world’s leading global glass tableware manufacturer.”\n\nWilliam A Foley, the manufacturer’s current CEO and Chairman of the board, will retire as CEO on March 24 2019, but remain as Executive Chairman of the board.\n\nMr Orr added: ”Bill has overseen a critical period in Libbey’s commercial transformation, including the creation of our highly successful and expanding e-commerce platform.\n\n“His leadership has helped to maintain and grow our leading industry position and we want to thank Bill for his hard work and dedication. We are also glad that we’ll continue to have his insights and contributions as an on-going member of our board of directors.”\n\nPictured: William Foley, current CEO of Libbey."
