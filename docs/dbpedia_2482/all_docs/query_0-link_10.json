        "text": "Victor John Chris Bauer, the youngest of five children of John William and Anna Koenig Bauer, was born October 13, 1918, at his parents’ home in northwest Audubon County and died September 2, 2011, at the Friendship Home in Audubon, Iowa at the age of 92 years, 10 months, and 19 days. Victor was baptized and confirmed at the Evangelical Brethren Church in Ross, Iowa. He attended rural school in Cameron Township then graduated from the Audubon High School in Audubon. He helped on the family farm and then enlisted in the U.S. Army on June 12, 1942. During his tour of duty he served in Central Europe, France, and Normandy and fought in several battles. He endured two battle wounds and received many honors including a Purple Heart and a Bronze Battle Star. He was honorably discharged on October 5, 1945, and returned to the Audubon area. Victor took several agricultural classes at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa and then began farming. On Tuesday, January 27, 1948, he was united in marriage to Vesper C. Baker at the Ross Church with her father Rev. Ray Baker performing the service. Six children were born to this union. They operated two different farms northwest of Audubon. They grew crops and raised livestock. In the early 1960’s Victor co-owned and operated People’s Produce and Feed in Audubon. Victor raised cattle and was one of the original shippers and instrumental in forming Operation T-Bone. Later he was honored as the Grand Marshall for the T-Bone parade. They moved from the farm into Audubon in 1989. Victor continued to help his son’s farm. Vesper died April 6, 2000. Victor lived in his home until he moved to the Friendship Home in 2006. Victor was a life long member of the Ross Calvary United Methodist Church in Ross. He served on many committees and served as the church treasurer. Victor enjoyed fishing, having coffee with his friends at Purina and the Chatterbox Café. But most of all Victor loved to farm. Victor was preceded in death by his wife Vesper; his parents; four siblings; a brother-in-law and a sister-in-law.
