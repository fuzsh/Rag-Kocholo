        "text": "These are important dates in the fictional home of Guiding Light, Springfield. They especially focus on the Bauer family, but reach out to other couples that I like or that are closely connected with the Bauer family. There are few Manny dates yet, but they will be added as I add to the episode guide. Other dates involve real life milestones for the show. As the execution of soap operas continues, I’ve gone back and added in start and end dates for other soaps. I hope it will help answer your questions about when something happened on Guiding Light.\n\nUpdate June 2010 – Peter Bradfield sent me some additions for the date list from the Atlanta-Journal Constitution’s soap summaries that they had that time, called “Soap Digest” by Lynda Hirsch. They were recaps presented at the time the episodes originally aired from 1977 to 1982. I appreciate the help and added them to the list.\n\nUpdate October 2010 – I’m going to add just a handful of Oakdale dates. Mostly from the special tribute issue put out in Fall 2010 for the finale by Soap Opera Weekly and Soap Opera Digest.\n\n1719 – The first lighthouse in America was lit.

[Jan. 25]\n\n1938 – The character of Dr. John Ruthledge writes a real book about the history of Five Points, the real setting of Guiding Light. It’s simply called The Guiding Light.

Joe’s response as Lee yells while falling, “Oh, no.” (Note: For more than a year before this, Lee was trying to gaslight Sara, and for much of 1969 had the assistant of their housekeeper, Miss Mildred Foss — who had been accidentally killed by Sara in the winter of 1969/1970 in the same third floor attic when Miss Mildred Foss tried to spook Sara into think Miss Foss was a burglar).

After she got back into the house she found out her misguided interest in a romance — really an obsession — Sara’s husband, Joe, was there after Joe had called her and Sara had somehow managed to answer the phone in her drugged out state. Before Kit left the first time, Sara was able to find out that Kit had also poisoned then Cedars Hospital Administrator Charlotte Waring Bauer (another rival for Joe in Kit’s twisted mind) in the same way the previous October — meaning that Charlotte didn’t die of a heart attack on the operating table the way Joe thought she did. Unfortunately, Joe himself was also shot during the struggle with Kit and would find himself with a reminder of the encounter that would eventually kill him in July 1976, a bullet to the heart wall.

It’s officially known as Guiding Light from this point.\n\n– Bridget and Jerome Dobson, daughter and son-in-law of GH’s creators, take on head writing duties at Guiding Light. They will hold those positions at Guiding Light until December 31, 1979. The Dobsons time as the head writing team for Guiding Light will be considered one of the more memorable time periods on the show as they give Rita her last name of Stapleton, and introduce both the Marler family and the Spaulding family to the Springfield landscape, are the first head writers to write for the show when it is expanded to an hour in November 1977 and also write the marital rape of Holly Norris Bauer Thorpe by Roger Thorpe in March 1979 and the subsequent trial and Holly shooting Roger and her ending up going to prison (another first for a daytime drama of a major woman character ending up being seen in prison for several months.)

(Unfortunately Rita’s relationship with Ed Bauer will suffer, as well as Roger’s marriage to Peggy Fletcher, when both Ed and Peggy show up in the courtroom when Roger admits all).

[July 22]\n\n– Roger Thorpe tells Holly he lied to Rita Stapleton that Ed was the father of their child, Christina (later Blake). [July 25]\n\n– At Jackie Scott Marler’s house, Hope Bauer tells her one-time fiance, Ben McFarren that she’s leaving Springfield. During the goodbye, they kiss, Ben’s current love interest Evie Stapleton, the younger sister of Rita sees this and misconstrues what is happening and runs out during a heavy thunderstorm without letting Hope and Ben know she was there.

Roger will never arrive there, but does leave town (later in the 1990s, it is explained that it is during this time that Roger supposedly started working for the government agency that saved him after he fell off the cliff and met and became involved with Hart Jessup’s mother).
