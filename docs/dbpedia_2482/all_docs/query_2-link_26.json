        "text": "Michael Bauer began his career in structural engineering upon graduating from California Polytechnical State University and working at a small structural firm that focused on public works projects. He cut his teeth designing schools, fire stations and public safety centers before joining DCI Engineers in 2018. At DCI, Michael has managed innovative and groundbreaking projects like 1510 Webster in Oakland, CA, the first Type IV-A mass timber building in North America, and loves to dive into challenging and unconventional jobs and offer practical solutions to complex problems. He’s well versed in designing high-rise projects in the San Francisco Bay Area using all types of construction materials, from mass timber, to steel, to concrete.\n\nWhat was your favorite class in college?\n\nConcrete Design Lab. At Cal Poly, they pushed “Learn by Doing” and this really reinforced my understanding of the fundamentals I use every day at DCI."
