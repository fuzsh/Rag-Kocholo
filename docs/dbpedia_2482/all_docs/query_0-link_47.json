Mark Radcliffe fought his last battle on April 1st, 2012, wrapped in the love and care given by his family, the wonderful dedicated staff at Aspen Gardens, and Hospice of St. Peters.\n\nMark was born September 6, 1918 in Shiprock, New Mexico, the first of three boys, to Marcus and Evelyn Radcliffe.

After the attack, he was sent to Officer Candidate School in Fort Benning, Georgia. In 1942 Mark was interviewed and selected for duty with the First Special Service Force at Fort William Henry Harrison in Helena as Company Executive Officer. He was trained as a paratrooper and a member of the elite Devil’s Brigade. He was assigned to the European Theater and participated in all the major force combat missions. Mark commanded the troops that captured and secured the enemy on Mt. Magio in Italy, was captured and wounded, and lead the first troops into Rome to secure their liberation. He was awarded the Silver Star, six Bronze Stars, three Army Accomodation medals, the Purple Heart with three clusters, the combat infantry badge, parachute wings, commendation for superior combat operations, and an official commendation for leading the first combat patrol into the City of Rome.
