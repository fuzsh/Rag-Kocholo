        "text": "Bio/Research\n\nDr. Michael Bauer is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Western Ontario. He was Chair of the Computer Science Department at Western Ontario from 1991-1996 and from 2002-2007. From 1996-2001 he was the Associate Vice-President Information Technology at the University of Western Ontario. He served on NSERC’s (National Science and Engineering Research Council) Computer Science grant review committee from 2005-2008 and was chair of the committee in 2008-2009. He was Principal Investigator for the CFI project that initially funded the creation of SHARCNET (www.sharcnet.ca) - a multi-university high performance computing grid. He is currently the Associate Director for SHARCNET. Professor Bauer’s primary specializations are in the fields of Distributed Systems, High Performance Computing and Applications of Parallel Computation. He is internationally recognized for his work on the use of policies in the management of distributed systems and applications and in autonomic systems. Dr. Bauer’s research in high performance computing includes the development of novel algorithms for the efficient uses of high performance computing grids, such as SHARCNET, and the development of novel parallel algorithms that can be used to analyze multiple, large multi-modal data sets. He has published over 220 refereed articles, has served on the organizing and program committee of numerous conferences and has refereed for a variety of international journals. He is a member of the IEEE and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and has served on various committees of both organizations. He has supervised over 70 graduate students.\n\nClick to Shrink <<"
