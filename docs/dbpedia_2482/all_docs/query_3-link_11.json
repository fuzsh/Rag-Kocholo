MICHAEL1 BAUER was born ABT 1765 in Alsase, Germany (Source: Letter of administration.(Source: Daily Evening Item, Lynn, Mass., Nov 4, 1925)). He married CATHERINE DOROTHEA ASTOR.\n\nNotes\n\nMichael Bauer and Katherine Astor came to this country from Elsass Germany and after a 6 week voyage landed in Philadelphia in 1791. Their son Michael Bauer who was born 19 October 1788 was only 3 years old at the time of the voyage. They settled at the west branch of the Susquehanna River below Williamsport, near Montoursville, in Lycoming Cty., PA.\n\nRef: Records of the ship\n\nMichael Bauer came to the US on the Ship Diana in 1790. He was accompanied with his wife Katherine Astor and 5 children. Actually Katherine's name was spelled Catharine Derothea Astor.\n\nThe children are listed in the book Pennsylvania German Pioneers, pgs. 42 & 43 and arrived in Philadelphia on August 10, 1791 aboard the Ship Diana, Ozias Goodwin, Commander.\n\nNote: Germans called their children by their middle name and frequently their children all had the same first name.\n\nThe children's names were listed Philip Jerry, Philip Jacob, Hans Michael, Catharine Deborah, and Hans Peter.\n\nRef: Newspaper article dated Nov 4, 1925, headlines were the election of Rudolph Sherman Bauer as he became mayor of Lynn, MA. Info. came from him and his mother, Hannah Sherman Bauer.\n\nThis article says they raised a family of eight children, five boys and three girls but it does not mention their names.]\n\nNotes\n\nOn August 10, 1791., Michael Bower and his wife, Catharine Dorothea, and their five children (Philip Jury, Philip Jacob, Hans Michael, Catherine Debora and Hans Peter) arrived in Philadelphia on the ship Diana from the port of Rotterdam after a voyage of six weeks, having come from Elsass (Alsace), France. However, a reference in a family bible gives their place of origin ad Hesse Darmstadt.\n\nMichael and his family were Redemptioners,... \"a class of white servants that played a significant part in the early settlement of this country. They (the Redemptioners) indentured themselves to be sold into bondage, and were in fact 'term slaves.' Their term, of service was virtually a state of slavery, worse in some cases than the bondage of the Negro, for the latter now and then had a kind master. Most of the Redemptioners were merely poor, uncultured or unfortunate people who wanted to improve their lot in life. There were thousands of these voluntary servants and they came from nearly all the countries of Europe. No country furnished Pennsylvania with. so many Redemptioners as Germany. The English Quaker traveler, Robert Sutcliff remarked 'I noticed many families, particularly in Pennsylvania, of great respectability, both in our Society and amongst others, 'who had themselves conic over to this country as Redemptioners, or were the children of such. And it is remarkable that the German residents in this country have a character for greater industry and stability than those of any other nation.\n\n\"Settlement of Lycoming County and the Muncy area by people of European origin began before the American Revolution.. Samuel Wallis began his farm estate here sometime in the 1760s and over about thirty years brought in bonded immigrants to work on it. Samuel Wallis perhaps brought a greater number of Redemptioners to the West Branch Valley of the Susquehanna than did any oilier individual. It worked somewhat like the modern employment agency; when Wallis needed white farm hands, artisans of house servants, he went to the shipping agents in Philadelphia and contracted for the type that he wanted. He then brought or sent them up to his 6,000-acre estate at Muncy in Lycoming County. The terms of the indenture depended in some degree on the shrewdness of the more or less helpless immigrants, but probably still more on their age, physique and prospect of usefulness, as well as on the demand for servants at the time of the landing of the ship, and on the liberality, or want of liberality of the individual to whom the bond is given. From such information as we have, it seems probable that those who bound themselves to Samuel Wallis bad the best terms that could be expected under the circumstances.\" (The quoted paragraphs are from The Now and Then, Muncy, Pa., 1891 and later.)\n\nOn September 17, 1791, Approximately one month after the Diana docked in Philadelphial, Michael Bower signed an indenture with Samuel Wallis, who agreed to pay 47 pounds 12 shillings and 8 pence for ship's passage in exchange for his labor for five years. After five years from September 17,1791, Michael Bower was to receive \"two suits of clothes, or wearing apparel, 50 acres of land and a house to live in for at least two years.\" Catharine Debora was to labor thirteen years from Sept. 17, 1791, for her passage and at end of term, \"two suits of wearing apparel.\" This was a still a frontier area when the Bowers arrived. Struggles between the Native Americans of the area and the new settlers lasted until shortly before the arrival of the Bowers in 1791. Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County in 1795, and the town of Muncy was not incorporated until 1826.\n\nAlthough we know the terms of Michael Bower's indenture, we know little more about him. According to an article in The daily Item of Lynn, Mass., Michael and Katherine settled on the West branch of the Susquehanna River, below Williamsport, near Montoursville, where they raised a family of eight children (five boys and three girls). In 1796, the year his indenture was completed, there was a Michael Bowers on the tax role of Muncy.\n\nA Michael Bower who is probably our Michael became a naturalized citizen of this country in September 1804, as did a Jacob Bower, who was probably his son (see copies of naturalization petitions).\n\nA Michael Bower is listed in the 1800 census of Northumberland County, and in 1810 there is a Michael Bower listed in the Town of Muncy in. Lycoming County. In 1814 there is a legal accounting of his estate in which Catharine, Michael and Peter are executors.\n\nChildren of MICHAEL BAUER and CATHERINE ASTOR are:\n\n2. i.

HANS MICHAEL2 BAUER , (BOWER) (MICHAEL1) was born October 19, 1788 in Elsass, France (Source: Daily Evening Item, Lynn, Mass., Nov. 4, 1925), and died May 1, 1853 in West Almond, Alleghany Co, NY, bur Phillips Creek W. Almond, NY. He married MARY HALL December 19, 1810 in PA (Source: Daily Evening Item, Lynn, Mass., Nov. 4, 1925), daughter of RICHARD HALL and MARGARET ROGERS.\n\nNotes\n\nAfter the marriage of Michael and Mary they lived in Muncey, Lycoming Cty., PA until 1817 when they moved to Bradford. In 1837 they moved to West Almond, Alleghany Cty., NY. Michael died 1 May 1853 and Mary moved to Oramel, Alleghany Cty., NY. She died 6 June 1854. Both Michael and Mary are buried in Phillips Creek, tow miles from the old Bauer homestead in West Almond, NY. They had 9 children.\n\nRef: Newspaper article dated Nov 4, 1925, headlines were the election of Rudolph Sherman Bauer as he became mayor of Lynn, MA. Info. came from him and his mother, Hannah Sherman Bauer.\n\nSame Ref as above:\n\nAt a very early age, as was the custom in those days he was bound out to a man living at Milton, PA, until he was 12 years old. he was married on the 19th day of December, 1810, to Mary, oldest daughter of Richard and Margaret (Rogers) Hall, who was born in Lyconing county, PA, on the 26th day of march, 1793.\n\nAfter their marriage, Michael and Mary (Hall)Bauer lived in the town of Muncey, Lyconing county, PA, until the year 1817, when they removed to the town of Bath, Steuben county, NY, and lived on a farm situated between Savona and Bradford. In 1837, they removed to a farm in West Almond, Allegany county, NY, where they dwelt when Grandfather Bauer died on the 1st day of May, 1853. The following spring. Brandmother Bauer moved to Oramel, Allehany county, NY, where she lived but a short time, as she died June 6, 1854. Both Michael and Mary Bauer were buried in the cemetery at Phillips Creek, two miles from the old Bauer homestead in West Almond, NY.\n\nThey were survived by nine children , of whom, eight grew up to manhood and raised families of their own.\n\nHans Michael Bower (Michael) was born October 19, 1788 in Elsass (Alsace), France (Source; Daily Evening Item, Lynn, Mass., Nov. 4, 1925), and died May 01, 1853 in Phillips Creek, Allegany Co., N.Y, (Source: Letter of Administration). He married Mary Hall December 19, 1810 in Pennsylvania (Source: Daily Evening Item, Lynn, Mass., Nov. 4, 1925), daughter of Richard Hall and Margaret Rogers.\n\nNotes\n\nWe know little more about Hans Michael, our forebear, than we did of his parents. Nothing is known of his brothers and sisters. Hans Michael dropped \"Hans\" from his name, and is referred to always as Michael on census reports and in the letter of administration of his estate.\n\nMichael was three years old when he came to this country. \"At a very early age, as was the custom in those days, he was bound out to a man living at Milton, Pa. (Samuel Wallis?), until he was 12 years old.\" (Daily Item) In 1810 Michael appears in the census as Living with his father's family. In December of that year he married Mary Hall. After their marriage, Michael and Mary lived in the town of Muncy.\n\nMichael Bower was probably a member of the Muncy Light Volunteers Infantry for 1812. The Volunteers enlisted for the defense of the City of Washington against at the invasion of the British. Many marched over the Genesee Road to fight at Niagara. The Genesee Country had excited the admiration of Revolutionary soldiers. Its early reputation and lavish advertisement attracted many settlers to the area, particularly after the War of 1812. Bath, established by Charles Williamson, chief land agent for the Pulteney Purchase, was for ten years his headquarters. Named after the English home of Williamson's employer was a handsome town with elegant buildings. Williamson first entered the Genesee Country from Pennsylvania. He opened a road from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, northward via the Tioga and Cohocton rivers to WiIliamsburg, New York, and made strenuous efforts to attract settlers through this portal.\n\nIn 1817, Michael moved his family to Bath, Steuben Co., N.Y., and lived on a farm situated between Savona and Bradford. In 1820 Michael was 31, the head of a household in Bath. N.Y. In addition to his wife, the household included; Susannah, Richard, Michael J., and. Mary. Next door is Richard Hall, and nearby there is a Samuel Hall. In 1830 Michael was 41 and he was still in Bath. He now had three sons Richard, Michael J. and. Joshua, and four daughters -- Susannah, Mary, Hannah and Catherine. In 1835 Michael appears in the census of Bath with 4 sons (?) and 4 daughters. (The extra child may be the one referred to in the Daily Item, which died young.)\n\nIn On July 20, 1837, for $650, Michael Bower bought 87 acres In Lot #131 and also part of Lot 132 for a total of 100 acres from Joseph Goodrich in the Town of West Almond in Allegany County. The land on which he settled was a part of the Morris Reserve, a 500,000-acre tract in the Genesee country. The southern part of the Genesee River basin consisted of more hilly land than the flatter, more desirable land to the north. It was later to yield oil in addition to its rich harvest of timber and farm produce. Settlement began in the first decade of the nineteenth century. Philip Church built an elegant estate at Belvidere at that time. Seventh Day Baptists established congregations at Alfred and a number of other Allegany County villages beginning in 1807, coming there from Berlin in Rensselaer County.\n\nMichael Bower has not been found in Allegany or Steuben counties in the 1840 census. Michael J. Bower was still in Bath.\n\nIn 1850 Michael Senior was now 61, living in West Almond. His youngest son, Thomas D., still lived at home with his parents. Michael died intestate on May 1, 1853. In 1853 Michael Senior died intestate. Mary and Joshua were executors of the estate. richard and Michael James apparently bought out their sisters' shares of the estate. Michael and Mary probably were members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Phillips Creek along with Silas Cartwright. The obituraries of two of his sons, Richard and Michael J., say that he came from Muncy, PA, and that he had eight children. According to his grandson, Ralph S. Bauer, both Michael and mary were buried in the Phillips Creek cemetery. A census of the cemetery lists a Michael Bower, a Catherine (illegible) and Mary G. Bower (daughter of Michael James Bower), but no Mary. Other stones may have been destroyed or illegible.\n\nChildren of HANS BAUER and MARY HALL are:\n\ni. SUSANNAH3 BAUER , (BOWER), b.

She married CLARENCE ELMER WEMETT April 5, 1910 in Hunts Hollow NY, son of GEORGE WEMETT and FRANCES CLEMONS.\n\nNotes\n\nHISTORY OF HEMLOCK, NY\n\n1779-1989\n\n1779 - Sunday, May 12 the Sullivan-Clinton army crossed the flats at the foot of Hemlock Lake, destroying the crops as they proceeded up over the west hill toward Conesus Lake. This action opened up the area for the early settlers.\n\n1796 - Phillip Short built a cabin about 1/4 mile in the valley north of Hemlock Lake. He was the forerunner of the Short family whose members were numerous in the area for many decades. (Arch Merrill' book \"The lakes Country\") states that Roswell Bliss came about 1795 and built a cabin and a saw mill).\n\n1797 - At about this same time Mr. Higby, from Livonia, established a saw mill on the outlet. Logs were coming in large quantities down the lake from Springwater and logging was taking place on the lake shore.\n\n1798 - Mr. Seth Simons, from Bristol, came and located a Grist Mill somewhere on the outlet.\n\n1800 - A hermit, named Maloy, came and built a cabin on the west shore. He was a hunter and trapper. The story is told that he had a bad encounter with a black bear. Maloy must have survived because he lived to tell about the fight.\n\n1801 - From this time on there was rapid change all the way from Hemlock Lake to Big Tree Rd. Many new settlers came. The saw mills were producing lumber, slab cabins were built and later on, frame buildings and businesses.\n\n1803 - Isaac Bishop opened a store in the area near the foot of the lake which came to be known as Gullburg. The area around the Canadice outlet, where it crosses the main road, became knwon as Glennville. Sometime later, just east of the road a dam across the outlet was built to back up the water and provide water power for a Gristmill which was built.\n\n1808 - The township of Livonia was formed; the Hemlock area being a part of it.\n\n1829 - This was a banner year. A Post Office was established in Hemlock, called the Post Office of Hemlock Lake. Mail came in from Gullburg, Glennville and Holden (later called Jacksonville). The first postmaster was John Van Fossen - 1/17/1829 - 10/18/36. The P.O. became Hemlock, New York on December 12, 1895.\n\n1832 - The Archer family, early settlers, were operating a saw mill on the outlet.\n\n1838 - The Baptist of the area organized as the 1st Baptist Church of Hemlock Lake, N.Y. The building was erected in 1844 at a cost of $1,400.00. It was located near the south end of Hemlock Village and still stands.\n\n1843 - A Methodist building was put up, which was destroyed by fire in 1948 and the present church was erected.\n\n1845 - Jacksonville was probably in its heyday. According to an Historical Maker, which was erected at the site by the Hemlock outlet 1 1/4 miles north-east of Hemlock, there were 130 houses, a brick yard, 10 mills and two distilleries. Almost all of the village was gone by 1850. The marker was installed in 1939 by the efforts of E. Short, Frank Connor and others.\n\n1850 - The Plank Road - A Company was organized in Rochester, N.Y. Much lumber was available at the time, so they decided to try planks. It is reported that 25 miles were completed and a Toll-Gate erected at the south end (where the Country Store is located now, corner of Big Tree and Rt. 15A). The road worked very well for a few years until the lumber began to warp and twist. It finally got so bad it was abandoned.\n\n1850 - The Metropolitan Hotel on South Main Street opened its doors for business after being under construction for about two years. There were three floors. The top floor was used for a ball-room and with a stage, it provided a great place for entertainment. An addition was built on a few years later on the south end.\n\n1851 - It was reported that Russell Jacque built a large farm house near the lake on the north end. The house was later (in 1873) made in to the three story famous \"Jacque-House\", one of the five hotels that existed on the lake during the steamboat days when excusions were offered on the lake.\n\n1853 - Due to the Old Bald Hill Road getting so much traffic, there aroase a need for the East Lake Road. Mr. John Hill caused the road to be built at a cost of $5,000.00. Soon after its completion, a Tollgate was set up at the Hemlock end. The story is told that one day while he was downtown, he became involved in an argument over the toll prices and fell dead with a heart attack. He never collected much toll. The road served the public for many years. Just the north end of the road is traveled now.\n\n1860 - Mr. George Watson built one of the first steamboats to ply the waters of the lake. This became one of the five boats that carried passengers on the lake from the dock at the foot of the lake to the hotels.\n\n1860 - The Baptist church, which had been established on the Curtis Corners about half way between Hemlock and Honeoye, disbanded and joined with the Hemlock church. The Rev. Ira Justin was pastor at that time.\n\n1866 - Frank Connor's history tells us that one day in '66 a large crowd assembled in front of the Metropolitan Hotel to discuss a Fair. That was the beginning of what later became known as \"The Slab City Fair\" \"The Little World's Fair\" and the just plain Hemlock Fair. In 1877 a two-day Fair was held and the Ladies Hall was erected. From then on it grew into what largely became contests of horse racing until the early 1900's.\n\n1876 - The gates were opened at Hemlock Lake and Hemlock Lake water rushed down the pipe line toward the city. This was the beginning of a gravity flow water system which has supplied the city of Rochester with millions and millions of gallons up to this very day. The system always needed inprovements and later on Canadice Lake water was tunneled into the lake. On file are several accounts of the growth of this famous water system.\n\n1879 - The three story St. James Hotel was opened on the east side of the lake. In the following years it was to accommodate many passengers from the steamships that were plying the lake.\n\n1882 - The Beam family built their first mill on the Canadice outlet. The dam and mill were just east of the main road. Powered by water power, the mill served the public for many years. Later the Beam family went on to build a mill on the Hemlock outlet in the village of Hemlock, just west of the main road. The family also operated a small store near the Canadice outlet.\n\n1888 - At this time, there were 112 buildings along the shores of Hemlock lake, 96 cottages, 5 hotels, 5 permanent residents and 6 cabins.\n\n1890 - A while back in our notes, we mentioned the \"hermit\" Maloy who came early to the foot of the lake. Around 1890, there came another man named Prinny Chesbro. He had been a sailor and it is said that he was the only man around who could safely splice a rope. He located a cabin somewhere near the half-way house. It is said that he lived to be 100 years old and came to be known as \"The Hermit of Hemlock Lake.\"\n\n1895 - The Lehigh Valley R.R. Co. railroad line was extended to Hemlock village and Hemlock Lake. Much could be written here about the Lehigh. With the coming of the railroad, Hemlock became alive. Quickly passenger service and the freight service grew until the middle of the 20th century many trains were in and out every week. Later on changing times caused the company to quit the runs to Hemlock and the rails were torn up in 1968. Eugene Spencer was one of the last station agents. The last passenger train pulled out of Hemlock in 1937. The \"section gang\" with their hand-car provided work for local men all those years.\n\n1898 - It is known that about this time there was a band in Hemlock. It was known as \"The Hemlock Cornet Band\". We do know of 3 or 4 of the members; Will Hoppough, Parker Hoppough, Chas. Briggs and possibly Will Mallaber. No doubt they played band music at the \"Slab City Fair\".\n\n1900 - Great days ahead for Hemlock, the village of Jacksonville had ceased to exist, Glennville and Gullburg had grown together and joined Hemlock, and activity at the lake was lively with new businesses.\n\n1904 - The Rebekah Lodge was organized. The I.O.O.F Order of Odd-Fellows had been established earlier (1898). The I. O.O.F. later went on to build a three-story lodge building south of the outlet on the east side of Main Street. In later years, the building was torn down.\n\n1906 - The Wemett Company incorporated. The hardware store, which had been owned and operated by Bacon & Wemett, changed hands due to the death of Mr. Bacon. C.E. Wemett started in the oil business selling Eldred Oil and later became distributor for the Shell Oil Co. 45 stations and about 4,500 customers were served as the oil business prospered.\n\n1911 - The old Gullburg school district, which was located just up the Old Bald Hill Road and on the east side of the road, voted to join the Hemlock district. The building was later used as a home and is still standing.\n\n1912 - At this time, Mr. V.P. Owen operated a Ford automobile agency from a building on the west side of South Main Street. It was the Ford agency and was selling Chevrolets.\n\n1915 - A little after this date some local people were busy. A few of the older people remember that the Nelson Cary family made baskets in their home on Clay Street. The Bates family lived near the entrance to the fair grounds. Thomas and Harry had a blacksmith and woodworking shop. Also, they made fine quality cutlery. Some of their knives are in the museum at the Livonia Library.\n\n1919 - This year the first hand-drawn chemical fire truck was purchased for the local firemen and a cider mill was established on Clay St. by Mr. Olin Mather. The building that housed the mill was torn down in Dixon Hollow and hauled to Hemlock. At the present time, it is an apartment house. It is believed that Olin Mather was the first man in the area to own and operate a self-propelled grain combine.\n\n1920 - There were three grocery and dry goods stores operating on the South Main Street. They were Beckers, Knapps, and LaMonts. Later Beckers was torn down to make room for a house, Knapps is now an apartment house and Earl Collins bought the LaMont property. There were two blacksmith shops on South Main; B. Naracong and Lewis Schneck, owners. By 1920, the Livingston County Canning Co. was in full operation on Railroad Avenue north side of the Lehigh Valley depot. Many local people were employed canning sweet corn, peas, and string beans. Many cases of canned vegetables were shipped out on the Lehigh R.R. The plant was destroyed by fire the fall of 1931. The Osborne brothers were owners.\n\n1925 - Niagara Power brought electricity to Hemlock. This brought an end to the use of water power which had been used to power the mills along the outlet. Soon the water was released from the old Hoppough mill pond west of Main Street. The pond, over the years, had been great for winter skating and fishing in summer.\n\n1925 - The Sullivan-Clinton Memorial maker was dedicated at the entrance of Hemlock Lake Park. It was made partly of Mill stones and inlaid with Indian arrowheads. It was a beautiful reminder of the past. The Hon. James W. Wadsworth was the guest speaker. Vandals have caused destruction to the monument in past years.\n\n1929 - The newly built present High School was completed and made ready for use.\n\n1930 - This year marked the end of an era. For 75 years, the Scott family had been coming every summer to their cottage and property on the west side of Hemlock Lake. They were, at last, forced to sell their property to the City of Rochester, which consisted of 175 acres of side hill land. Some of the land had been converted to grape vineyards several years earlier. There was also 1 1/2 acres and 175 feet of lake frontage. According to the records they were paid $55,000.00 for the property they had enjoyed for so long. They were just about the last people to sell out. NOTE: Grapes from their vineyard were at one time picked, packed and sold from a small building by the side of the road near the foot of the lake.\n\n1935 - At this time, there was a drug store in Hemlock. The druggist name was H. W. Thurston.\n\n1937 - 1941 - A weekly paper was published here in Hemlock. It was called the \"Hemlock Courier\". It was published by Mr. William Fletcher at his home on Clay Street.\n\n1941 - 1946 - There was no Hemlock Fair due to scarcity of gas and tires and the war effort of World War II.\n\n1942 - The Hemlock Church Club was organized.

The Club meets once a month and they have planned and promoted religious services as well as helping the two local churches financially. The club is still active.\n\n1943 - This year the Hemlock High School boy's basketball team won the Class C Sectional championship.\n\n1943 - A Service Man's plaque was dedicated. There were 34 names listed of men of the area. The stone plaque is located on the lawn of the High School and it is dated 1941-1945.\n\n1944 - The Hemlock Baptist Church celebrated the 100th Anniversary of the erection of the church building. It was a two day affair held on August 5th and 6th.\n\n1947 - At this time we mention \"The Roadside Craftsmen\". In a new building across the main road from the 1812 Country Store, the Iron Works were operating. Clarence Curtis of Lakeville, New York and his workmen were turning out useful and ornamental iron articles. Roadside Craftsmen, Inc. went on the establish unit in Avon and East Bloomfield.\n\n1949 - Kidnapped and murdered, the 11 year old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Reggie Lynn was walking to school from their home in Gullburg to Hemlock. She was picked up somewhere between there and town. Two days later, her body was found in a ravine south of Lima. She had been shot to death. Her killer has never been found.\n\n1950 - \"ECHO ROCK\" - It was about this time that Arch Merrill tried to locate the ROCK on the west shore of Hemlock Lake. Echo Rock once was a noted landmark on Hemlock's shores. The ancient boulder, a child of the glacial age, was venerated by the superstitious Indians who knew nothing of the principle of sound waves, and believed the answering voices at Echo Rock were those of kindred in the Spirit Land, when in reality they were only echoes across the lake. When the City of Rochester raised the level of Hemlock Lake by building dikes to increase their water supply the rock disappeared under water.\n\n1950 - At this time Frank Connor, Historian, was writing 24 installments of history for \"The Livonia Gazette\". Much of our material has come from these writings.\n\n1958 - June 16th, Hemlock voted to centralize with Livonia school. Ted Henry, of Hemlock, was elected to the School Board.\n\n1961 - Mark Wemett purchased the Hemlock hardware store from Hugh Drain.

Records show there were flying lessons taught and that at one time there was an airplane race from Hemlock to Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nDr. Hamilton occupied a house that was made over from the old school building at the top of North Main Street and it is still a private home.\n\nFOOT NOTES\n\nMrs. Mae Short Woodworth tells us that her first husband, the late Nathan Short, who had built their home on East Avenue in Livonia, N.Y. had passed away December 2, 1966. Nathan was the last living male member of the Short family who had come to Hemlock as the first settler (Philip Short). \"Nate\" was a first class carpenter and he worked around the Hemlock and Livonia areas for most of his life. He always had the interest of the community at heart. He was 70 years of age when he passed away.\n\n\"Death of Mrs. Clarence Wemett\", (newspaper article)\n\nAda Jennings Wemett, wife of Clarence Wemett of Hemlock, died at her home there at 6 o'clock Sunday morning, of pneumonia. She was taken sick the preceding Monday, and failed to respond to the medical treatment which was unsparingly given her. Funeral services were held at the Hemlock Methodist church Tuesday afternoon. Burial was in Union cemetery, Livonia.\n\nMrs. Wemett was born forty-seven years ago in Naples, the daughter of Nelson and Arvilla Bower Jennings.
