        "text": "Our research focuses on ultrafast processes in solids and on their surfaces. We are interested, for example, in plasmonic excitations at interfaces, adsorbate-surface interaction processes and non-equilibrium processes in two-dimensional materials. In our experiments we mainly use time-resolved photoemission techniques, such as time-resolved two-photon photoemission (TR2PPE), time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy with interferometric resolution (ITRPEEM) and time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRARPES). An essential aspect of our work is the continuous development of these experimental approaches."
