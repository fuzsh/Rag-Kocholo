        "text": "My visit with Dr. Bauer was wonderful. His communication, mannerisms, and especially his ability to perform his procedure on my knee with such care was outstanding!! Totally satisfied. ?\n\nGilbert F • August 19, 2024\n\nVery knowledgeable and kind from the front desk personnel to the physician. Would definitely recommend.\n\nElizabeth J • August 14, 2024\n\nDr. Bauer compassionately and patiently listened to my concerns and my spouse's concerns, suggested current labs to compare with previous labs, listened to my feedback, and worked with me to determine next steps in gathering needed information to help inform treatment planning that would be wholistic and individualized for my healthcare needs.\n\nKatherine P • August 13, 2024\n\nDr. Bauer and all the staff are so very helpful and make sure all of questions and needs have been addressed at each appointment. We always feel confident in our care.\n\nDebora B • August 13, 2024\n\nBypassing the hierarchy of a medical \"system\" held by the large monopolies in the city. Hands on. Quick and definate assessent. A treatment plan agreed on with me, the patient. My hopes for the best I can be which so helps me to feel like there are better days ahead.\n\nJudith G • August 09, 2024\n\nWonderful atmosphere, loved our experience!\n\nSammy L • August 08, 2024\n\nThe best place for your family, I fully trust these providers.\n\nMatthew M • August 08, 2024\n\nExcellent, personalized care! Dr Bauer and staff are professional and alert to the needs of the patient.\n\nCatherine P • August 08, 2024\n\nThis is how healthcare should be! We were so impressed with Dr. Bauer and his team. They are knowledgeable and professional, but treated us like partners in the healing process. Instead of a lecture and we felt respected and empowered with options. What a change from the impersonal healthcare model we're used to.\n\nMichele S • August 07, 2024\n\nDr. Bauer was great addressing my concerns.\n\nBrandon B • August 06, 2024\n\nHad a fantastic experience. No pain what so ever. The Doctor was so very kind and very knowledgeable. He also explained everything he was going to do and explained as we went along. How the shots worked and put me an easy. He nurse was superb! She was just amazing. Also the staff was great the entire experience was great. No pain my leg and knee after the procedure before it was at a 8 out of 10. Will definitely use him again when I have to have my other knee replaced.\n\nBillie Y • August 03, 2024\n\nGreat service! I would highly recommend this office.\n\nBrady B • July 31, 2024\n\nIncredible DR and facility!!! I highly recommend Freedom Health and Dr. Beauer. I have insurance and have had another DR. with one of the main hospital services for over 20 years. Since I discovered that DR. Beauer started his own practice, I quit my previous General Practitioner and have Signed up with Freedom Health. The personal care and lack of political environment (that comes with insurance required providers) is worth every penny!!!\n\nCharley A • July 31, 2024\n\nDr. Bauer was kind and personable.\n\nJamie C • July 30, 2024\n\nDr Bauer was attentive and informative. Never felt rushed and always felt he was engaged both with concern and empathy. His openness to alternative means as well as cultural is refreshing.\n\nRoy B • July 29, 2024\n\nThis was the best care and attention I’ve ever received from a physician.\n\nMatt W • July 29, 2024\n\nDr. Bauer takes the time to listen, inform, and be diligent in diagnosing a problem and recommending a solution. He is knowledgeable, friendly, and thoughtful in the way he explains what is going on and why he is recommending a certain course of action. I have been dealing with an issue for years with no diagnosis from previous doctors. Dr. Bauer took the time to fully evaluate my symptoms and to identify what was going on and then refer me to a specialist. I highly recommend Dr. Bauer!\n\nCharlotte W • July 23, 2024\n\nDr Bauer is very knowledgeable and caring. I am a human not a number. You can ask any question and he is happy to answer and talk to you about something else if there is a concern without making a separate appointment. I love this office and him as a doctor.\n\nShawna H • July 21, 2024\n\nDr Bauer was very caring and attentive. They worked me in on a day they were short staffed and still didn't make me feel rushed. I received excellent care and really love being a member of Freedom.\n\nNathan M • July 19, 2024\n\nThe atmosphere is wonderful, very uplifting. Dr. Bauer needs to work on his people skills...just kidding! He & the staff are very personable & made me feel quite at ease through the process. I'm grateful.\n\nMarilyn S • July 19, 2024\n\nVery thorough and a pleasure to have one who listens\n\nHerbert T • July 18, 2024\n\nDr Bauer and his staff are great. I’ve had the Iovera treatment on both knees and while it’s not a pleasant experience, Dr Bauer is a professional is every aspect. Heck we even talked college football during the procedure ?. Can’t ask for more than that!\n\nStephen T • July 18, 2024\n\nDr. Bauer and his assistant were both very kind and patient with me. Although I was very nervous about the injections they made me feel at ease after meeting them. The injections were not exactly a pleasant experience but Dr. Bauer talked to me and joked during the procedure to help put me at ease. The whole staff are kind, caring and considerate people. I liked them all very much and highly recommend them.\n\nBobbie H • July 13, 2024\n\nI just started going to Freedom and I love it. Great staff and Dr. Bauer is informative and a nice guy.\n\nJames M • July 11, 2024\n\nGreat doc and team!\n\nMatthew C • July 10, 2024\n\nI was very impressed with the entire practice. Everyone was very kind and informative. Dr. Bauer was very professional and reassuring. I would highly recommend him.\n\nKathleen J • July 05, 2024\n\nWith 7 kids and several active athletes, Dr. Bauer has been an answered prayer for us. Our son suffered a sports injury last week and it was so incredible to get an orthopedic appointment without the hassle of an overpriced emergency room visit. Having his expertise available as a cash pay patient is such a blessing to our family. Not to mention the great care, concern, and prayers we receive as patients there. I recommend Freedom Healthcare to everyone I know. So thankful for this place!\n\nMaverick P • June 24, 2024\n\nFreedom Health Systems is the doctor’s office I prayed for. From the compassionate providers making patients feel comfortable, ease at making appointments, clean rooms and facility, and blend of natural and conventional — Freedom Health systems exceeds my expectations! Highly recommend!\n\nRevy B • June 22, 2024\n\nReally love freedom health systems! My whole family goes to freedom and have always had a pleasant time! Great staff & awesome care!\n\nAugust W • June 21, 2024\n\nDr. Bauer was very professional and easy to talk during the procedure. His nurse was also very good. It was my first visit and I felt comfortable the entire time.\n\nJames T • May 09, 2024"
