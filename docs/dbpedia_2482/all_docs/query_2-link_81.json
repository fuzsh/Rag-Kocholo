Whether you are looking for a starter home, luxury home, farm/ranch or investment property I always offer the same level of quality service.\n\nI have always been a top producing sales agent in the Windermere Van Vleet office and am also among the top 3% in Jackson County. Since 1982, I have attained multi-million dollar recognition yearly, earned a Lifetime Membership in the Million Dollar Club and earned my CRS (Certified Residential Specialist) designation. My success is attributed to a large repeat clientele in the sale or purchase of residential, rural residential, multi-family and commercial sales. I have a Master's degree in finance from San Jose State University which provides me with the skills needed in analyzing investment properties.\n\nI have lived in Southern Oregon for 28 years after moving here from California. My family and I continue to enjoy the many cultural and outdoor activities Southern Oregon has to offer. As a team, my wife and I can provide you the professional and experienced service you should expect."
