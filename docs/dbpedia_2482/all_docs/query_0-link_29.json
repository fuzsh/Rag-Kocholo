        "text": "New York Philharmonic Orchestra Members\n\nThis list has been compiled from program rosters and records of the orchestra personnel office of the New York Philharmonic. Its first iteration was edited by Norman Schweikert, long-time hornist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; it has since been maintained by the New York Philharmonic Archives. It contains information on past and current members of the New York Philharmonic; it does not, however, include that of the New York Symphony Orchestra nor the New/National Symphony Orchestra, both of which merged with the New York Philharmonic in the 1920s. Additional information about current orchestra members can be found on our Meet the Orchestra page.\n\nDates with an asterisk (*) next to them indicate that the range does not reflect the entire tenure of the orchestra member, but rather their membership within a particular instrument section. If a player was a member of multiple sections, their other instrument(s) and date range(s) are listed in the notes. Players in multiple sections will appear multiple times. Principal and other roles are designated in the notes and do not always coincide with a memberâ€™s tenure dates. Principal in the violin section denotes Principal Second Violin; Concertmaster is listed separately. Substitute players are not listed, and extras are only listed for the harp and keyboard sections.\n\nWe will update this database each year on September 1. We anticipate future changes to historical data as we uncover new information about past members. Please contact the Archives with any further information or questions."
