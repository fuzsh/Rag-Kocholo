        "text": "1937 –The Guiding Light starts to air under creator and first head writer Irna Phillips. GL begins life as a fifteen minute radio drama on NBC Radio in Chicago. Phillips also introduced organ music scene transitions (organ players were cheaper than a live band, but more expressive and versital than a pre-recording) and concluding each episode with a cliffhanger. [Jan. 25]\n\nToday is Guiding Light‘s original birthday as a 15 minute radio soap opera. I have been working on retyping this article for quite awhile and saved it for today. I should mention that the original articles DOES have quite a few black and white photos. I’m still debating whether to scan them or not. If I decide to go ahead I’ll link the post here.\n\nSoaps The History Part 1 Guiding Light\n\nBack before the internet was a thing, specialized information about long term stories was hard to get. Often people would struggle long and hard and have to be lucky to get the right sources to produce histories of how things came to be. Now, on my blog alone, you can get a good idea about Guiding Light and how it came to be, but it used to be that such resources weren’t around. However, printing presses were. Access to a printing press used to give such a power to create and even though it’s now easier to create, it’s also less special and often less specialized. One soap magazine, Afternoon TV, would periodically do a special issue. This particular issue tells the history of soap operas.\n\nSoap history can be a tricky thing, especially pre-roughly mid 1990s when people started to record what happened each day online. So much happens that it can be an easy thing to over simplify or miss a detail that’s important to the over all story or that particular plotline whether the forgetting is either knowingly or not. For instance, both Phillip Spaulding’s adoptive mother and the love of his life are named Elizabeth. [The head writer who created Beth didn’t know that Phillip’s adoptive mother even existed much less knew her name and apparently didn’t think to ask.] Do you tell the history of how Henry Chamberlain came to town with his own company (what we saw happen) or the history that Henry Chamberlain had worked with Brandon Spaulding to build up Spaulding Enterprises and Carmen Santos envied their social position (what they told us happened later)? Do you say that Alan Spaulding moved to town and bought a house (what we saw happen) or that the family lived in the house where Alan AND Alexandra grew up (what they told us happened later)? So that being said any soap opera history is going to have issues. I do not personally stake that this one is a correct account of the first roughly 35 years of Guiding Light history, but this is what they told us the history was in 1983. The article spells the Rev. John Ruthledge’s name as Rev. Rudledge. I confirmed it in the book he “wrote” that Ruthledge was correct. I added quite a few notes correcting some things and explaining why I did others a certain way.\n\nThe Guiding Light\n\nThe Guiding Light first made its debut on the radio on January 25, 1937. The Fifteen-minute show, created by Irna Phillips, had as its central character the Reverend Ruthledge, a minister who tended his flock in a place called Five Points, USA. Reverend Ruthledge soon became a most beloved figure in homes throughout America, and a book of his Good Friday sermons is reputed to have sold over a quarter of a million copies. [See Note 1] The good minister did not survive the transition to TV and remained Five Points. [See Note 2]\n\nThe legendary Bauer family, which forms the core of the show did not make their appearances on the radio show until the late forties. [See Note 3] In those early days, the family was composed of Papa Bauer, played by Viennese actor Theo Goetz, Mama Bauer, and their three children; Bill, Meta, and Trudy. [See Note 4] Mama died soon after the Bauer clan joined the show and shortly thereafter Bill married Bertha or Bert as she was to be affectionately known by millions of devoted viewers. The role was acted at first by an actress named Ann Shepard, but she left after a year and Charita Bauer replaced her. The year was 1950. Man people believe, quiet erroneously, that the Bauer family name was inspired by Charita‘s. In reality the fact that her name and that her character are identical is strictly coincidental.\n\nThe Guiding Light was first telecast on June 30, 1952. Like all the early soaps, it had a 15-minute format and it was broadcast live and in black and white, During the many years it was presented to the public, born on radio and television. The actors and the story lines were identical. The local was changed to Selby Flats, and then to Springfield. [See Note 5]\n\nTheo Goetz played Papa Bauer until his death. He was for many years one of the most beloved characters in daytime drama. When he died, millions mourned his passing. Of his children only Meta and Bill continued in the show. Trudy was quickly phased out of the story lines after the show went on television. Meta, who was a strong, self-motivated character, survived for many years. She began her scandalous career by running away when she was young to become a model. Soon however, she became pregnant and was forced to marry. The marriage didn’t last very long and she ended by divorcing her husband. [Note 6] The child [Chuckie] that was born of that unhappy union was tragically killed and Meta murdered her ex-husband whom she blamed for the death of her child. A newspaperman called Joe Roberts helped her get acquitted, and later on they were married. Joe had a daughter called Kathy, and she and Meta did not get along. The friction between them worsened when Joe died and both women fell in love with the same man, whose name was Mark Holden. Mark eventually married Kathy, and they had a daughter named Robin. Both Kathy and Robin were to become very important to the show’s story line and when Kathy died in 1958 audiences flooded the studio with their expressions of grief.\n\nBy 1959 the cast included the following characters and actors:\n\nTheo Goetz.……………………Papa Bauer\n\nCharita Bauer………………….Bert Bauer\n\nEd Bryce…………………………..Bill Bauer\n\nEllen Denning…………………Meta Bauer\n\nBernard Grant…………………Dr. Paul Fletcher\n\nWhitfield Conor………………Mark Holden\n\nJames Lipton……………………Dick Grant\n\nLynne Rogers…………………..Marie Grant\n\nAbigail Kellog………………….Robin Holden\n\nLes Damon……………………….Bruce Banning\n\nJoan Gray………………………….Ann Fletcher\n\nPat Collins…………………………Billy Bauer [aka Ed Bauer as an adult – ed.]\n\nAlice Yourman………………….Laura Grant\n\nJoe Campanella……………….Joe Turino\n\nIn the beginning of the show Bert was a domineering wife and an interfering mother, but she softened with the passing of the years. She and Bill had two sons, Mike, the oldest, and Ed. Mike was played as a child by a young actor named Glenn Walker, who was to become the film star Christopher Walken. The name Michael Bauer was chosen for the older Bauer boy because Charita Bauer had just had a son whom she had christened Michael. She asked the show’s producers to name her TV son after her own child, and they agreed.\n\nIn the course of the years Bill Bauer developed a drinking problem and caused a great deal of sorrow to Bert, especially when he had an affair with a woman called Maggie Scott. [Note 7] But he eventually broke up the relationship and became cured of his alcoholism. [Note 8] His son Ed, who also became an alcoholic, was helped by Bill in his struggle against alcohol. By the time Bill died, he was a model husband and father. [Note 9]\n\nMike and Robin Holden had a love affair which was met with much-opposition from Bert. Bill interceded on his son’s behalf which caused a great deal of friction between him and his wife. Even Meta, who had every reason to oppose the match, tried to keep Bert from interfering, but without much success. All the tensions and problems surrounding the relationship proved to be more than the young lovers could handle, and the romance eventually hit the rocks. Mike left Robin and went to Law school, and Robin married a real cad by the name of Alex Bowden. Mike also married the wrong woman, a neurotic character named Julie Conrad. [Note 10] They had a daughter whom they named Hope, but their marriage began to deteriorate due to Julie’s increasingly mental instability. She was eventually committed to an insane asylum where she later died. By this time Mike had graduated Law school and decided to leave Springfield with his daughter Hope. They somehow ended up as characters on Another World. [Note 11] The invalid lawyer who was to be Mike’s first law partner was called John Randolph and Mike found himself immediately attracted to Randolph’s wife Pat. In order to avoid creating a rupture in the Randolph’s marriage, Mike decided to return to Springfield.\n\nBy this time, Ed had become a doctor and had married the daughter of his chief at the hospital, Dr. Steve Jackson. The marriage between Leslie Jackson and Ed Bauer was never successful. Ed’s frequent bouts with alcoholism led him to abuse Leslie physically at times. Slowly she lost all her love for him. When Mike returned to Springfield, he and Leslie were thrown together and the inevitable happened, they fell in love. This created a very popular and sizzling story line which involved practically all of the characters on the show. The viewers immediately took sides and most of them favored a union between Leslie and Mike. Their wishes were eventually granted, but not right away. To begin with, Leslie became pregnant by Ed, and for the sake of her unborn child she decided to give her ailing marriage a second chance. Mike was crushed by her decision, and married on the rebound. His new wife, a nasty character by the name of Charlotte Waring, caused him a great deal of grief, not the least of which was her ill treatment of Hope. After much pain and soul searching and some very complicated story lines, Mike left Charlotte. She was later killed by a psychotic called Kit Vested, who worked as a volunteer in the hospital where Ed worked. She connived to implicate Dr. Joe Werner in Charlotte’s death. Charlotte and Joe had been having a love affair, and Kit, who was in love with Joe, sought in this manner to punish them both. Joe Werner was discharged from the hospital where he worked as Chief of Staff. He was eventually phased out of the show.\n\nMike and Leslie were finally able to get married and their union was celebrated with much fanfare in Bert’s home. Ed, on the other hand, sought help for his alcoholism and was eventually cured. [Note 8 AGAIN!]\n\nNew characters kept flowing in and out of the story lines. The Norris family, composed of Stanley, Holly, Ken, and, Stanley’s ex-wife, Barbara, made their appearance during this period. Holly fell in love with a character called Roger Thorpe. [Note 12] Both Ken and Roger fell in love with another character called Janet Mason. [Note 13] Barbara, on the other hand, became involved with Roger’s father Adam, who was played by Robert Mill. [Note 14] In a series of complicated twists, Stanley was murdered and Leslie was implicated in his death. Mike defended her at her trial and got her acquitted, Holly continued to pursue Roger, who continued to pursue Janet, who was really in love with Ken. In the end Ken and Janet married, but their marriage was always threatened by his excessive jealousy.\n\nBy 1981 the cast had more than doubled, even though many of the original characters had been phased out of the show. New names mad their presence be felt in Springfield, names like Alan Spaulding, Tony Reardon, Carrie Todd, Ross Marler, Vanessa Chamberlain, Amanda McFarren, and an archvillainess called Diane Ballard. [Note 15] Also, added to the cast was a mysterious archeologist called Quinton McCord who soon took the show by storm.\n\nThe plots and subplots continued to multiply, romances continued to be ill-starred, marriages broke and then mended, people were murdered and innocents were accused of the murder, all very much in keeping with soap opera style.\n\nAround this time the multiple plots went something like this. Ross Marler, a sneaky, conniving schemer, falls madly in love with super sweet Carrie Todd, whose gentle ways transform Ross into a decent, sensitive human being. [Note 16] All looks peaches and cream for the pair until the spiteful and vicious Diane Ballard gets into the picture. It seems that Diane, who makes it her business to know all the skeletons hidden in Springfield’s closets, also knows enough about Ross’ unsavory past to try to blackmail him. Carrie finds out about Diane’s plans and goes to her house to try and dissuade her from her Machiavellic plans. Diane laughs at Carrie’s pleas to spare Ross and mocks her anguish. Carrie jumps at Diane and the two women begin to struggle violently. In the midst of the fight, Diane slips and falls down and hit her head on the stone fireplace. She dies instantly. Carrie is terrified at the accident and flees the scene, but not without taking with her a briefcase full of tapes incrimination Alan Spaulding, someone Carrie is very fond of. Of course, Diane had many enemies, and a lot of people become suspects in her death, including Ross and Alan. But in the end Carrie confesses the truth to Ross and then tries to commit suicide. She survives the suicide attempt and later on Ross marries her.\n\nIn the meantime Alan Spaulding is having big troubles of his own. The head of wealthy Spaulding Enterprises, Alan has climbed all the way to the top the same as Ross did, by lying and cheating. Like Ross, Alan meets a woman who changes him into a new man. this woman is Hope Bauer. Very much against Mike Bauer’s wishes, who hates and distrusts Alan, he marries Hope. But his unsavory past caught up with Alan and when Hope finds out the truth, she decides to leave him, even though by now they have a small son, Alan-Michael. After a complicated storyline, where an assassin tries to kill Alan in the desert, he escapes and is finally caught by the police and sentenced to two years in jail. Hope, who by now realizes she loves her husband above all things, decides to stick with him. Even Mike Bauer begins to soften towards his son-in-law, who has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that he has turned over a new leaf.\n\nIn other subplots, Nola Reardon gives birth to Floyd Parker’s baby with the reluctant help of Dr. Kelly Nelson, with whom Nola is really in love. But Kelly is married and although he and his wife Morgan are having martial problems, it doesn’t look like Nola is about to see her dreams of a marriage with Kelly come true. [Note 17] Besides, the mysterious Quint McCord seems to have rather sinister plans to change Nola’s life. If he succeeds in his intentions Nola may never be the same again. In any case, after her baby’s birth, Nola becomes the snoopy household supervisor for Quint McCord. Quint and his foreboding housekeeper, Mrs. Reinfield share secrets involving his profession and some women in his past.\n\nBy 1983, some of these plots had been more than entangled than ever. The cast of characters which had almost quadrupled since the soap’s debut, now looked like this [Ed. note: I published this list as a separate post.]\n\nAs the Quint/Nola story line unfolded, it soon became obvious that Quint was in love with Nola and meant to make her his wife. This however doesn’t happen so fast in soap operas. Love has to be tried and tested. This proved true also of Quint’s love for Nola. To begin with, there is a mentally unstable woman called Rebecca Cartwright with whom Quint was involved at one time. He doesn’t want her anymore, but Rebecca refuses to buy that. She’s out to get Quint one way or another. Her scheming leads to a car crash where Quint nearly loses his life. While he’s still at the hospital Nola learns that he’s really Henry Chamberlain’s son. This doesn’t please Quint at all.\n\nWhen Quint and Nola reveal their plans to marry, the furious Rebecca tells Nola that Quint had once thrown Rebecca off a cliff causing her to have a miscarriage and be disfigured. She proposes re-enacting the scene at the same cliff, but while she’s there she changes her mind and reveals that it was her husband, Mark Evans, who tried to kill her. She further reveals that Mark’s real name is Samuel Pasquin while hers is Mona Enright. Rebecca/Mona then goes completely crazy and tried to push Amanda Spaulding off the cliff. Mark/Samuel is able to save Amanda, but is shot by Rebecca and falls to his death. [Note 19] Rebecca jumps over the cliff after him, all of which suit Quint and Nola just fine, even if they are too noble to admit it to themselves. After some other minor complications, they finally get married and take off for a romantic honeymoon in Ireland.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly Nelson and Morgan continue to have marital problems and even a marriage counselor can’t help. To make things worse, Morgan becomes deeply infatuated with Josh Lewis and finally decides she wants a divorce.\n\nHope and Alan Spaulding are also having marital woes. He’s now out of jail and back in business. He begins relying more and more on Trish Lewis’ advice and even consults with her on the redecoration of his house. Hope reacts to the situation by immersing herself in alcohol. [Note 18]\n\nA mysterious woman called Annabelle Sims shows up around this time. She becomes romantically involved with Tony Reardon. They both become obsessed by a photograph depicts four men and a girl who bears an uncanny resemblance to Annabelle. As this interesting story line unfolds we learn that the woman in the picture was Anne, Annabelle’s mother, who was killed by someone during a boating trip. Annabelle, who was a witness to the tragedy, had blocked the whole thing from her conscious mind, but now begins to having a series of blackouts. To make the situation more perplexing, someone begins to murder the men in the photograph. One of the first victims is Bill Bauer, whose murder is made to look like a suicide. Then several attempts are made on other people’s lives, including H.B. Lewis. Finally, Annabelle begins to remember begins to remember and the murderer, who turns out to be Eli Simms, takes her back to the river where he killed Anne, and once there tries to kill Annabelle also. Luckily Tony happens to be in the vicinity and saves her life. Very convenient and very lucky for Annabelle. In the meantime, Eli falls from the boat and is shot dead, presumably by H.B. Lewis.\n\nAll the untimely demises and cancelled story lines that shook Guiding Light in 1983 were the result of Allen M. Potter, the show’s Executive Producer, being replaced by Gail Kobe. As soon as she was installed in the Producer’s chair, Ms. Kobe grabbed the proverbial axe and proceeded to decimate the show’s plots and cast. [Note 20] This caused a great deal of confusion and demoralization among the actors who managed to survive the devastation. Also, part of the show’s brush with disaster was the prolonged illness that befell Charita Bauer, the beloved matriarch of the Bauer clan. She was away from the show from summer through fall, first with pneumonia, and then with blood clots and diabetes. It is still uncertain whether or not she still will return to the show. If she doesn’t, Ms. Kobe will have to make some further and even more sweeping changes. Whatever happens, we hope that the fans of Guiding Light, some of whom have been faithful followers of the show for more than three decades, will continue watching.\n\nNOTES\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction I’m not sure what material was used in piecing together these histories. The memory doesn’t always pull up a complete story especially if you started watching after a certain event. I’m adding these notes below to correct information from the magazine as I know it.\n\nRuthledge’s book, published under the title The Guiding Light, appeared in 1938 as a promotion for the show. It purports to be a history of Five Points written by the character of Dr. John Ruthledge. A good part of the text is a collection of his sermons presumably those used on the radio show. He was fairly isolationist in 1937 which is a bit of a shock for people on this side of World War II history. I don’t know how many copies the book sold or if it was offered as some kind of premium, but I CAN tell you that you fairly trip over used copies in second hand book sellers.\n\nThe loss of the actor who played Rev. Ruthledge and the fact that his story and his family’s had been thoroughly explored, actually caused the move to Los Angeles. The Guiding Light only came TV after it had already been set in Five Points and Selby Flats before it moved to Springfield. The TV version has always been set in Springfield.\n\nThe radio show started in 1937 and the Bauer family was introduced in 1948.\n\nMama Bauer died soon after they joined the show and they either never said her first name, or nobody remembers it. She is only known as Mama Bauer.\n\nThe article mistakenly calls Selby Flats, Silkly Flats. I fixed it.\n\nThey hit all the major parts of Meta’s story, but they put them in the wrong order. Meta had an affair with Ted White, got pregnant, gave the boy, Chuckie, up for adoption, regained custody, married Ted, decided to get a divorce, Chuckie is fatally hurt taking a boxing lesson that Ted insisted he take, Ted realizes his mistakes, Meta kills him, and Meta is cleared of murder.\n\nThe text has it Maffie Scott, which would have been a more interesting name, but sadly which is incorrect. I fixed it. It should be Maggie Scott.\n\nYou cannot be “cured” of alcoholism, not even in Springfield. It means Bill entered recovery.\n\nExcept Bill was presumed killed in a plane crash. Once he learned everyone thought he was dead he ran off to Canada where he apparently had an affair with a woman years before. Her real husband had just died so he married her and became “step-father” to the product of this affair his daughter, Hillary. He will return to Springfield years later to make amends and ended up being murder by Annabelle Simms Reardon’s psychopathic father Eli Simms as part of the famous mysterious photo storyline that kind of unbelievably tied in a lot of older men around the canvas. However, it was much better written than the sorry attempt of a carbon copy Maryanne Curthers storyline which didn’t make a lick of sense towards the end of the show.\n\nI missed a trivia question on the year I went to the real life BBQ about which Bauer died in a mental hospital. It was in fact, Hope’s mother, Julie Conrad, But the way it was phrased I didn’t get it. I really don’t think a short term unhappy marriage that ends in your death really makes you a Bauer. But on the other hand she WAS Hope’s mother. What do you think?\n\nAnother Irna Phillips created soap, Another World took its name as a play off of As the World Turns. Originally it was planned to be a bookend with ATWT. CBS didn’t want the soap though so it instead sold to NBC and most links between it and the CBS soaps were dropped except the kickstart of Mike and Hope.\n\nThe article is called Roger Dawson for some reason. An odd mistake to make since he was such an important character. I don’t know if he came into town with a fake name, but from the description it’s 1000% Roger Thorpe and I fixed it in the article.\n\nKen Norris completely dropped out of the story after he was committed to a sanitarium. He returned to the show in 1998 reforming close connections with his sister Holly and niece Blake adopting a very protective attitude to them. However, he acted as if he didn’t know or still love either Janet Mason or their child. In between appearing as an actor he joined the show’s writers including being part of the team that won a Daytime Emmy for writing.\n\nRoger’s father and Holly’s mother, Adam and Barbara, developed a relationship. They married and despite their eventual divorce seemed to keep a warm relationship. I saw a clip and thought it must have been pre-marriage from their interactions and, nope, it was after.\n\nI fixed Diane Balland to Diane Ballard.\n\nI fixed Ross Marlen into Ross Marler.\n\nKelly and Morgan weren’t married, they were just starting their relationship when Nola moved in on them. They married afterward.\n\nHope and Alan are my second favorite soap opera couple of all soaps and all time and I’ve written about them before. This is hardly a fair depiction of their terrible fate, but I will just clarify that Hope’s job was as an interior decorator so to have Trish involved in designing Hope’s own home over Hope’s choices was awful.\n\nMark Evans and Amanda Spaulding were romantically involved – married? – that’s why Amanda was dragged into it. Apparently whatever other crap he pulled Mark truly loved her.\n\nA lot of upcoming issues with the lack of Bauers in the Bauer family can be traced back to Ms. Kobe’s decisions. Having taken over, she was determined the actors realize that no one was safe under her and hers was the will of God. So she took out Hope Bauer and other mainstays quickly began to fall.\n\nI was very pleased to find this three part history of Guiding Light. I don’t think it’s 100% accurate, but cleary had access to some records we don’t, like the cast lists. Also, they interviewed people that were involved with the soap in the early days. The first part I didn’t bother scanning for photos because of the color of the original, but I think the yellow, while not as good as white, is still OK to see the photos.\n\nDenis, Paul. “The Story of CBS-TV’s The Guiding Light” (Part 2 of 3). Daytime TV. October 1974 Vol. 5, no. 5, pp. 16-22, 50, 52, 54.\n\nThe Bill Bauer Role\n\nBill Bauer, originally played by Lyle Sudrow, was married to Bertha and became the father of Michael and Ed.\n\nSudrow left in 1956 and moved to Hollywood with his wife, Diana Cheswick, and their daughter, Nicole. Eugene Smith played Bill Bauer, and the character was declared dead in 1965 when a plane he was on was missing. But seven months later, Bill Bauer was brought back into the story and this time Ed Bryce was playing the role.\n\nMarried Actors\n\nThe only time Guiding Light has had a married acting team on the show at the same time was when Richard Morse (Karl) was playing the sweetheart to his real wife, Judy Robinson, who was portraying Robin Holden, in 1959. In the story, Morse wanted to marry Judy, but instead she married his best friend in 1960. (In their real life, they subsequently were divorced.)\n\nBlack Actors\n\nGuiding Light has employed some of the finest actors, James Earl Jones, who went on to stage and movie fame, portrayed Dr. Jim Frazier and Rubby Dee his wife, Nurse Martha Frazier. Later, Cecily Tyson played Nurse Frazier. Olivia Cole portrayed Deborah Mehran, Janet Mason Norris’ best friend and secretary to Dr. Sarah McIntyre, in 1973.\n\nGil Mehran was first played by David Pendleton and later by James Preston (who subsequently moved over to Another World).\n\nFran Myers\n\nFran Myers was 14 1/2 when she became Peggy Scott in 1964. As the daughter of Ben Scott (Bernard Kates), she literally grew up in full view of the TV audience. In 10 years, she has become a beautiful girl and an accomplished actress.\n\nAs Peggy, she subsequently married Johnny Fletcher, and is now the mother of Billy on the show.\n\nErnest Graves\n\nErnest Graves played Alex Bowden from 1960 through 1966. He says he started as a villain and then became a good guy, and they finally sent him off to Switzerland. In the story, Bowden had a fondness for young girls and, says Graves, “People were always yelling at me, ‘Leave that girl alone!'” Once, when he was particularly nasty in the story, an irate lady recognized him in a supermarket and ran her shopping cart into his leg.\n\nHe looks back with admiration at the skill of director Walter Gorman (who died a couple of years ago). “One day, an actress broke her leg, and it was 10:30am and we were worried, but Walter said, “I’m calling Nancy Malone, so don’t worry!’ Nancy arrived, glanced at the script, and did the show perfectly!'”\n\n(Graves is now on One Life to Live, playing Victor Lord.)\n\nThe Impact\n\nJames Lipton made several brief trips to Hollywood during the time he was portraying Dr. Dick Grant on The Guiding Light.\n\nOne day he happened to be having lunch in the Warner Brothers commissary — and a movie commissary is filled with blase people who would not raise an eyebrow if the biggest star walked in.\n\nBut when the waitress spotted Lipton, she murmured, “My God!….You’re not Dr. Grant?!’ When Lipton admitted he was Dr. Grant, she dropped her loaded tray and swooned. And then, amidst the noisy confusion, the rest of the waitresses lined up for an autograph of Dr. Grant.\n\nIt’s possible that some movie stars are still brooding about the day a New York soap opera actor took the spotlight away from them right in their home grounds. Lipton also recalls that Lena Horne, Cole Porter, and Tallulah Bankhead were among his most loyal fans. They watched The Guiding Light … and loved it!\n\nThe late Theo Goetz, to his dying day, could never quite believe how important he had become because of his Papa Bauer portrayal. He used to brood: “Am I Theo Goetz who plays Papa Bauer or am I really Papa Bauer who dreams he’s Theo Goetz?”\n\nTheo loved reading his fan mail and marveled at the marriage proposals he received. When the show decided to reveal his 65th birthday on the air and invite viewers to send in a card, Theo was worried that no one would write. And so he begged his corner groceryman to send in a card. But when 26,000 cards came in almost overnight, Theo was stunned.\n\nCharita Bauer, through the years, has been continually startled at the warm reception she receives no matter where she is. People recognize her, even in Ireland or London or Paris. She was stepping into a gondola in Venice once, when a woman came rushing up, gasping, “Don’t you play Bertha Bauer on The Guiding Light? And wouldn’t you come over to meet my mother?”\n\nAnother time, she was visiting backstage at the Metropolitan Opera House when opera star Grace Bumpry recognized her. “This is a thrill for me,” said Charita, and asked Miss Bumpry for HER autograph.\n\nDon Stewart (playing Michael Bauer) has a thriving singing career on the side, yet he hesitates to quit Guiding Light. He is constantly recognized as Michael Bauer everywhere he goes, and he appreciates what Guiding Light has done for him. He’s gained more fame on GL than all his years in Hollywood movies and nighttime TV.\n\nThe Cast in the 1960s\n\nIn 1960, the cast consisted of Charita Bauer (Bert Bauer), Ellen Demming (Meta Roberts), Theo Goetz (Papa Bauer), Bernard Grant (Dr. Paul Fletcher), Joan Gray (Ann Fletcher), Ed Bryce (Bill Bauer), Judy Robinson (Robin Holden), James Lipton (Dick Grant), Lynne Rogers (Marie Grant), Michael Allen (Michael Bauer), Joe Campanella (Joe Torina), Pat Collins (Billy Bauer), Les Damon (Dr. Bruce Banning), Connie Lembcke (Amy Sinclair), and Carson Woods (Phillip Collins).\n\nBy 1962, the cast included: Ellen Demming (Meta Banning), Barnard Hughes (Dr. Bruce Banning), Charita Bauer, Theo Goetz, Bernard Grant, Elizabeth Hubbard (Ann Fletcher), Ed Bryce, Nancy Malone (Robin Holden), James Lipton, Lynne Rogers, Paul Prokop (Michael Bauer), Pat Collins, Carson Woods (Phillip Collins), Ernest Graves (Alex Bowden), Barbara Becker (Doris Crandall), Phil Sterling (George Hayes), John Boruff (Henry Benedict), and Kay Campbell (Helene Benedict).\n\nIn 1964, the cast has added Ellen Weston (Robin Bowden), Sandy Smith (Julie Conrad), Chase Crosley (Jane Fletcher), Donald Melvin (Johnny Fletcher).\n\nBy 1967, the cast consisted of Ed Bryce, Charita Bauer, Robert Gentry (Ed Bauer), Theo Goetz, Bernard Grant, Gillian Spencer (Robin Fletcher), Bernard Kates (Ben Scott), June Graham (Maggie Scott), Francie Myers [Blog Ed.

When Gentry left in 1969, Mart Hulswit took over.\n\nRobin Holden through the years was played by Judy Robinson, Zina Bethune, Abigail Kellogg, Nancy Malone, Gillian Spencer. The character was Robin Holdin Bowden Fletcher when she was finally written out.\n\nJohnny Fletcher was portrayed by Daniel Fortas, Donnie Melvin, Don Scardino and finally by Erik Howell who left in 1972.\n\nHenry Benedict was played by John Beoruff, who also was a co-writer of the show at one time, Paul McGarth also played the role.\n\nThe bitchy character of Charlotte Bauer was first played by Victoria Wyndham and from 1971 to 1973 by Melinda Fee, who was then “killed off.”\n\nHope Bauer, daughter of Michael Bauer, was created by Paula Schwartz and then taken over by Elissa Leeds, who dropped out last year.\n\nDr. Sarah McIntyre was created by Patricia Roe in 1967, and was then played by Jill Andre, with Millette Alexander taking over in 1969.\n\nDr. Joe Werner was created by Ben Hayes. Ed Zimmermann suceeded him in 1967 and after Zimmermann died in 1972, Berkeley Harris was brought in and then Anthony Call.\n\nStanley Norris was first played by Michael Higgins and then by William Smithers.\n\nBarbara Norris was a role created by Augusta Dabney, and Barbara Berjer took over in 1970 after having played Claire Cassen for six years on As the World Turns.\n\nAdam Thorpe was created by Robert Gerringer and then Robert Milli succeeded him.\n\nPeter Wexler was first played by Leon Russom, and Michael Durrell took over until he left last year.\n\nBilly Dee Williams and then James Earl Jones both played Dr. Jim Frazier.\n\nCecily Tyson and Ruby Dee played Nurse Martha Frazier.\n\nLois Holmes and then Kate Harrington portrayed Muriel Conway.\n\nPeter Greene and then Dan Hamiliton played David Vestid.\n\n1966 Cast Review\n\nFourteen years after Guiding Light had premiered on TV, the characters and their approximate age of their show lives shaped up this way:\n\nBertha and Bill Bauer (Charita Bauer and Ed Bryce). The Bauer family continues to be the backbone of this serial.\n\nPapa Bauer (Theo Goetz), the patriarch, held in great affection by the audience.\n\nMichael Bauer, the elder Bauer son, very much on stage since 1952 and written out of the story about a year ago for conflict reasons.\n\nDr. Ed Bauer (Robert Gentry), the younger Bauer son, a resident in surgery at Cedars Hosptial, on stage a year.\n\nDr. Paul Fletcher (Bernard Grant) has his own clinic adjacent to home. He is also a GP on staff at Cedars Hospital. On show about 10 years.\n\nRobin Fletcher (Gillian Spencer), Paul’s second wife, part of the show over 10 years, from childhood to present. Her mother, Kathy, was one of the original lead characters and died in Robin’s childhood.\n\nJohnny Fletcher (Don Scardino), age 18 and Paul’s son by his first marriage, on show six years.\n\nJane Hayes (Chase Crosley), Paul’s half-sister and part of the story five years. She and George have a six-month-old daughter.\n\nGeorge Hayes (Philip Sterling), a lawyer and married to Jane. On the show 5 years.\n\nMrs. Maggie Scott (June Graham) Bill’s former co-worker and mistress. On the show five years.\n\nPeggy Scott (Francie Myers), Maggie’s 17-year-old daughter. On show two years.\n\nBen Scott (Bernard Kates), Peggy’s father and Maggie’s husband. On the show a year.\n\nLeslie Jackson (Lynne Adams), a volunteer aide at Cedars Hospital. In her early 20s and in love with Ed Bauer. On the show six months.\n\nDr. Stephen Jackson (Stefan Schnabel), chief of surgery at Cedars Hospital. On the show six months.\n\nDr. Joe Werner (Ben Hayes), Dr. Jackson’s senior resident. On show six months.\n\nDr Jim Frazier (James Earl Jones), a senior resident at Cedars. On show six months.\n\nMartha Frazier (Cecily Tyson), Jim’s wife and a nurse.\n\nFirst Heart Transplant\n\nThe Guiding Light is the first daytime serial to dramatize a heart operation.\n\nIn 1967 it staged a two-day operation, using real transplant surgical equipment. There was no blood or knife cutting into flesh shown on camera, but everything else was authentic. The cast and crew worked long hours to do the operation correctly, and Ed Bryce (Bill Bauer) played the patient. Paul McGarth portrayed the heart specialist, assisted by Stefan Schnabel (Dr. Stephen Jackson) and Ed Zimmermann (Dr. Joe Werner).\n\nWhen the heart was at last transplanted and the incision sewn up, the director told Ed Bryce, that he could get up from the operating table. But Bryce didn’t move; he had gone off to sleep.\n\nMart Hulswit\n\nMart Hulswit took over as Dr. Ed Bauer on Jan. 1, 1969.\n\nHe had worked for three years with the NY Shakespeare Festival and appeared in a few movies and many nighttime TV shows, but it’s been Guiding Light that put him on the map.\n\nHe’s been in the Top Ten as Best Actor in our Readers’ Poll once every three or four months, and in Runners Up the rest of the time. He and Don Stewart are easily the most popular actors on The Guiding Light.\n\nWhen asked if he’s like the character he portrays, he says, “Ed is more aloof in public than I am. He has more scientific intellect than I, and he has conquered many more problems that I hope I’ll ever have. I respect him; he’s quite a guy, and it’s too bad he can’t be happier.”\n\nTeen Fan\n\nThrough the years, Guiding Light has built a tremendously loyal audience, of course. And perhaps one of its most remarkable loyal viewers is John Genovese, 17, at 696 River Road, Cos Cob, Conn. 06807.\n\nHe has kept records of the storyline, the cast, the music etc. of the show, having watched it since he was a child, and asking his mother for facts about the show that took place before he was born. Despite an inordinate interest in certain daytime serials, he remains a first-rate student in school. Last year, he wrote a history of The Guiding Light as a school project.\n\nFirst Pregnancy Shown\n\nAs with most serials, pregnant actresses were carefully filmed so that their condition was hidden. However in 1966, Guiding Light decided to handle Gillian Spencer‘s real-life pregnancy differently. Since she was happily married in the story, the show let her be pregnant on camera. But in the story she lost her baby. When Chase Crosley was pregnant, the story let her bear the baby, too.\n\nThis serial ususally permits its actresses six weeks off to have their baby, but often lets this stretch to eight weeks. But that time, most actresses want to get back into the story.\n\nFan Clubs Help\n\nThere’s been a big increase in fan clubs for daytime actors, and two Guiding Light actors, Don Stewart and Mart Hulswit, undoubtedly have the most dynamic fan clubs on Guiding Light.\n\nDon’s fan club is headed by Ruth Paff of 646 Pontius Road, Cincinati, Ohio 4238, and Sue Steele, 21 Seward St. Apt. #E-5, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866.\n\nMart’s fan club is run by Nancy Dingus, RD 3, Box 134, Elizabeth, Penn, 15037.\n\nTony Call (Dr. Joe Werner) now also has a fan club, and its presdient is Elizabeth Papadinecz, 1424 139th St. Whitstone NY, 11357.\n\nHow the Casting is Done\n\nThe big detergent company, Proctor and Gamble, owns The Guiding Light, which is produced for it by the Compton ad agency in New York.\n\nThe serial is cast by Mrs. Betty Rea, who has an office in Compton. It’s her job to sift through hundrends of aspiring actors and actresses, and to recommend to producer Lucy Rittenberg and Proctor and Gamble her selections. She has “open interviews” on Monday, Thursday, and Friday mornings in her office. Actors wishing to see her may phone and ask for an appointment. She casts the extras or the under-fivers (actors who have less than five lines of dialogue), and speaking parts for brief roles, and those long-running roles that are put under contract.\n\nMrs. Rea starts with a “character breakdown of the role” from the writers, and then she seeks out actors who fit the qualities required.\n\nWhen a character is slated to have a relationship with somebody already in the cast, then the actor is asked to do scenes with the person he’ll beworking with. For instance, when Ed Zimmermann (Dr. Joe Werner) died, actors auditioning for the Werner role were asked to play scenes with Millette Alexander, who plays Werner’s wife, Sarah.\n\nSometimes, an actor is auditioned in another city and brought to New York, Don Stewart, for example, was auditioned in Hollywood and hired. Some are seen on other serials and, when their contracts are up, are sought out. Tony Call and Carol Teitel, for instance, had been working on The Edge of Night. Peter MacLean was remembered from Where the Heart Is. Robert Mili had been seen on Another World. Barabara Berjer came over after had been “killed off” on As the World Turns.\n\nSometimes a role is changed so that a fine actor can be hired. Lilia Skala, for instance, was auditioned for the role of Mrs. Dunbar, but her European accent ruled her out for that role. So Guiding Light changed the character to Mrs. Hoffman, which permitted an accent… and that’s how Lilia Skala was added to the cast.\n\nFat Captions\n\n1960: When Theo Goetz was 65, the show suggested the viewers might want to congratulate him personally.

It was celebrating roughly 20 years of soap operas on television. The article was written by Peter Andrews who was a former Producer and Director of The Guiding Life, How to Survive a Marriage, etc. The punctuation is as published. He abbreviates The Guiding Light as T.G.L. I’m not sure if that was standard at the time or if it was something he or the magazine editor did. The bolding of names I added and some last names of characters. It doesn’t specifically say, but the show he mentions as going off the air that he was with from the beginning, How to Survive a Marriage, started in 1974. Backtracking from that the 16 years he says was on Guiding Light, he must have joined around 1958. Although it doesn’t list Guiding Light, it does list How to Survive a Marriage so I’m pretty sure this is him.\n\nAndrews, Peter. “Looking Back 20 Years Backstage with Daytime Serials: It wasn’t All Grim for the 16 Years at the Guiding Light, Etc. …. There Were Giddy Moments, Too…” Daytime TV Super Special, vol. 1, no. 2, 1975, pp. 62-65.\n\nI sat in my living room, staring out at the gray sky and the bare, black tree branches outside my window. I felt like Fran Bachman of How to Survive a Marriage when she lost her husband David — empty.\n\nSomething I loved was going out of my life — How to Survive — was about to go off the air … the show I had worked with since it began would no longer be, and I was without work.\n\nThen I heard the dogs barking and that, of course, meant the mailman. I trudged to the mail box, got the mail, and — what’s this? — Daytime TV, Sept. ’74. Paul Denis, the editor, sent me a copy because my picture was included in his story of The Guiding Light. What a thoughtful thing to do. Thanks — I needed that!\n\nSo I read the Guiding Light story, and the memories of my 16 years on the show came flooding back! I notice that Mr. Denis, in discussing Irna Phillips, creator of T.G.L. talked of it being a family show. Well, the actors were like a family – a warm, fun-loving wholesome family – and I think their good will and their regard for each story showed through the screen.\n\nCharita Bauer (Bert Bauer) was the mother and set the tone — Joan of Arc holding the T.G.L. banner on high and rallying us around her. She was open, caring, always saying what was on her mind, getting angry when necessary — but bubbling through everything that great Irish wit, sauciness, sparkle, elan, joy in living.\n\nAnd always that professionalism, that dedication to the best possible show — stemming perhaps from a lifetime in the theatre – she was in the original Broadway production of Little Women!\n\nLucy Rittenberg, for many years the producer and still with the show, is also responsible for that altitude of no-nonsense, no-complaining, and no-thinking of self – “We’re here to put on the best show we can — to WORK at it!”\n\nWhen I joined T.G.L. in 1953 as the most piddling possible assistant, lost in the hustle-bustle jungle of cameras, lights, mikes, and cables, Charita, Lucy, and Flossie, the wardrobe mistress, took me under their wing and showed me what an acting company family was like- how everybody cared for one another and helped each other out, and took such great, heart-soaring joy in a show so well done that they sometimes cried.\n\nI thought Charita was wonderful and glamorous and wise and talented and funny. She made me feel loved and a part of things. She made me a part of her life — she gave me meals (when I got engaged, my fiance, Charita and I got a touch tipsy and threw pickles at the pigeons at Charita’s place.)\n\nLater when the actors used to play football in Central Park, Joe Campanella (Joe Turino) was the star and supporting players were Michael Allen (Michael Bauer)[Ed. note: who I’m sure was awesomesauce even as a little boy], that lumbering leprechaun Ernest Graves (Alex Bowden)[Ed. note: The link includes the sad story of Hope’s mother], Bert Grant (Paul Fletcher) who was better with jokes than end runs, Jimmy Lipton (then Dick Grant) who played football like a ballet dancer, which he was; the legendary Irish madman director Walter Gorman, and the equally legendary lighting man Ronnie Green, who, after getting knocked dizzy by pint-sized pepperpot associate director Bob Barr, got up and said, “You’re not going to believe this, but which way is North?”\n\nTiny digression — Michael Allen once invited me to join him in rowing to England. I declined (one of my few wise decisions) and the boat sank 10 feet into the Long Island Sound (luckily they had plenty of beer).\n\nAnyway, Charita felt the football games were family outings and worried about us getting our feet cold and that sort of thing. I can still remember her standing on a sheer of ice, the wind whipping her dress like Eliza on the ice flows, and holding a basket of sandwiches and hot coffee.\n\nAfter a while, she and Lynee Rogers (Marie Grant) joined the games. The games were too rough, and we started crying a lot (just kidding). After the games, Charita would have us over to her place and we would talk and make jokes about the game, which was even more fun than the game.\n\nOne day this glamorous, wonderful, wise person was a couple minutes late getting on the set for rehearsal. I still held the same piddling job but by that time I thought of myself as a big wheel … so I yelled at Charita: “C’mon get down here! You’re holding everybody up!”\n\nWell, Charita burst into tears! I was dumbfounded — but it made me realize how close we all were.\n\nYet another evidence that Charita had feet of clay was her excuses for being late. She would always come in huffing and puffing, as if she had expended her last ounce of energy in a herculean effort to fulfill her holy quest — being on time.\n\nOne time, when she was about half an hour late, she said she just couldn’t get across Lexington Avenue! The gasping announcement was greeted by a chorus of boos and laughter. We could just see the onrushing stream of evil black cars, never ending, going through red lights, hurling Charita back against the buildings by the force of the wind lash they created, and the evil occupants of the cars laughing their slimy laughs like The Shadow!\n\nAnother of Charita‘s dillys was that she couldn’t get her girdle on. When the director said, “So what?” Charita drew herself up to her full five-three and announced in her most lofty, glacial, shanty-Irish-haughty-tones: “Well! Would you want me to go on the air without my girdle!”\n\nThat little bombshell produced a stunned silence among those present. We all cringed in silent horror at the thought!\n\nAnother one that might have made the Hit Parade was this gem: ( She shouted this one as if she’d gotten to the end of her rope TRYING against impossible odds to make rehearsal on time) “Well I couldn’t find a TOKEN!” (In New York we use tokens for the subways.)\n\nOur image this time was of a poor little match girl in her tatters begging for a token to get to work.\n\nAnother subway-supper-silly excuse was: “Whew! What an experience! I got caught in the turnstile!” (She should have come in whirling round and round! We figured the turnstile was in league with the traffic — out to do Charita in!)\n\nEllen Demming (Meta Bauer White) always reminded me of the raw-boned pioneer women who crossed the prairies in the covered wagons, often pushing. They could whip up a meal, be depended upon when things went bad, stitch a quilt, crack a joke, and maybe even dispatch a few redskins if need be. Ellen was another mother on the show. She had immense heart and strength.\n\nAnyway, I guess Ellen felt she was being outdone by Charita because one day she came up with a super-excuse of her own, destined to really rock that laugh meter. One day she came in with the Charita out-of-breath act, and, eyes rolling, flung this to the heavens: “There’s been a LANDSLIDE at Spuyten Duyvil!” She swayed a few times, as if to fall, then pulled herself together, gave it the ol’ chin up. Mrs. Miniver treatment, and started rehearsing. It was all we could do to stop from applauding such a performance. Incidentally, Spuyten Duyvil was a place that her train went by. Also, to this day, nobody has been able to come up with anything in the papers or anywhere else about the landslide. (Maybe a kid was throwing pebbles at the train.)\n\nWhen Ellen married Bruce Banning on the show she was taller than the actor who played the part (Les Damon, I think). She was so embarrassed that she got married in her bare feet so she could be shorter. [Republisher’s Note: This seems silly, but was a big deal back then. An example from the same time is Get Smart Agent 99 was taller than Maxwell Smart and so if they’re walking he’s shorter, but if they’re standing still he’s taller — because he’s standing on a box.]\n\nIn the early days of the show, whenever there was a tragedy in the story, Meta would go around and buck everyone up — just as Ellen did in real life. She linked to offer other people chocolates. Just the thing for Dick Grant when Cathy was killed in her wheel chair! Her most famous line was: “Chocolate buds, anyone?”\n\nMany years later, when Bill Bauer was lost at sea in a plane crash, we gave Ed Bryce, the actor who played the part, a going-away party. The late Ed Zimmermann (Dr. Joe Werner), who was a lilting, witty, laughing, pixilated free spirit of a guy, wrote a skit in which the actors pretended they were in the plane going into its final tailspin. The climatic line, just as they were about to crash, was Ellen saying, “Chocolate buds, anyone?” (One last much before the crunch!)\n\nThe late Theo Goetz (Papa Bauer) and Walter Gorman (director) were the fathers of the family. Theo demanded professionalism — lines learned, on time, concentration, caring! He was an actor in the old tradition — he considered his work a great calling. He acted in the florid, Gotterdammerung, booming gesticulating style of his native Germany in the 20s and 30s. He was always telling stories of the great old days: “Affairs? … What do you people know of affairs?… The great affairs were in the 90s!” This with a hearty laugh.\n\nHe would tell of the glory days of the Schauspielhaus where the plays of the legendary German Director Rhinehart were presented to royalty and glittering German society. When Theo gave one of his flourishy, bravado performances, we used to kid him: “Boy, Theo, nobody can make a big deal out of something like you can! …Five minutes to say, “Dinner is served! Too bad the Grand Duke of the Tyrol isn’t here to applaud with his riding crop!”\n\nThen there was the day we took Billy Bell, Tennesse hillybilly cameraman (also lawyer and great guy), wrapped him up in a Confederate flag, and gave him to Charita for her birthday.\n\nAfter a while, I tried to be a father, too. Fran Myers (Peggy Scott) and Elissa Leeds (Hope Bauer) were my victims. Fran was 14 when she came on the show and Walter Gorman and I tried to be dads to her. (It didn’t hurt that she was pretty!) I remember telling Fran in my sternest tones to stay away from Lynne Adams (Leslie Bauer), who was a “bad influence” on her. Lynne was the live-it-up, adventurous, fun-loving, naughty member of the cast. One time she jumped in a hotel pool with her clothes on and persuaded sweet little Fran to do it too.\n\nAnyway, Fran, reacting typically to my advice, moved into Lynne‘s apartment with (Lynne was about 20) and they both benefited tremendously from it. (So much for my wisdom!)\n\nFran, who was always trying to improve herself as a person, used to carry around a little book with famous sayings in it which she would pull out and recite from at critical times. For instance, if the show was a total disaster, Fran would pull out her book and recite: “Adversity is the diamond dust Heaven polishes its jewelry with … Author Unknown.”\n\nWhen Jimmy Lipton (Dr. Dick Grant) “froze” in surgery, somebody put a prop vulture on top of the IV machine.\n\nLyle Sudrow (Bill Bauer), who used to cover not knowing his lines by developing a hesitant, shambling delivery, once was a victim of a great trick. He had just bought an expensive watch and was quite boastful about it, but it could be heard ticking in his scene and the director asked him to put in on the table. It could still be heard even on the table, ticking more faintly.\n\nUnbeknownst to all, a sound effect of a ticking clock was being fed into the studio sound system, and a technician just made the sound fainter by turning a “pot” or knob. The director asked Lyle to sit on the watch: the sound got fainter. When Lyle was told to take the damn thing out of the studio — which he did — and we still heard it — more faintly — we kind of figured we’d been had.\n\nThey used to kid Don Stewart (Michael Bauer) because he was so square – right wing, patriotic, Air Force Reserve pilot, and all that. Well, I admire him for standing up for what he believes.\n\nOne time I called the whole cast together and yelled at them for making fun of the scripts. Some of the actors didn’t like it; some laughed. Don told me he agreed with me about the actors’ duty to give the script a chance and he gave me some of his Navy books on leadership — a very thoughtful thing to do (I needed them).\n\nThat’s just a beginning, but I’m out of space. Gee, the sky doesn’t seem so gray anymore … in fact there’s a little light coming in the window … could that be…. The Guiding Light?\n\nThis is the eightieth in an irregular feature where we will report updates on what cast members of Guiding Light are doing now. I’m playing catch up on some soap magazine news.
