        "text": "\"Michael is a super skilled and experienced editor. He is diligent, quick and has a good eye for storytelling and humour. I hereby give my warmest recommendations of Michael Bauer.\"\n\n\"Michael is a very talented and accomplished film editor. In addition to being fiercely committed, he exhibits a distinct sense of humor, storytelling and human nature in his work. Plus, he's a pleasure to work with, which is sometimes the most crucial quality.\"\n\n\"First and all, Michael is a warm and great person. Humble and clever, asking the right questions. Felt sure that Michael is pushing the limits to get the best out of the material. Great at collaboration and an invested storyteller.\"\n\n\"Michael had a very great understanding of both Viaplay's and the director's ambitions and wishes, while he personally has a fantastic understanding of and overview of dramatic structure and complex character work. In addition, he has an ability to add fantastic rhythm and poetics to the narrative. I can only highly recommend Michael for your editing suite.\"\n\n\"When Michael is on board, you can rest assured that the material will actually be at its best, and as a director it is extremely important for me to feel that all options have been tried and no quick solutions have been attempted.\""
