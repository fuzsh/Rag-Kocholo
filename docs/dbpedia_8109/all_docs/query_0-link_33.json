A brutal crime, Lashner knew that the police would not be able to find the killer. So he took on the legal system, determined to find the killer himself.\n\nLashner's quest takes him from the streets of Baltimore to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. He fights tooth and nail to get the justice he believes his daughter deserves. But in the end, Lashner's relentless pursuit of the truth comes at a price. Hostile Witness is the story of a father's desperate quest for revenge, and his courageous fight for justice.; 8vo; 501 pages."
