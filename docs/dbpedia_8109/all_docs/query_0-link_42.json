        "text": "Definition of hostile witness\n\nNoun\n\nhostile witness (plural hostile witnesses)\n\n(law) In a legal trial, a person called to testify as a witness by a party to whom that witness is opposed.\n\nFurther reading\n\nA hostile witness is a witness in a trial who testifies for the opposing party or a witness who offers adverse testimony to the calling party during direct examination.\n\nA witness called by the opposing party is presumed hostile. A witness called by the direct examiner can be declared hostile by a judge, at the request of the examiner, when the witness' testimony is openly antagonistic or clearly prejudiced to the opposing party.\n\nA party examining a hostile witness may question the witness as if in cross-examination, thus permitting the use of leading questions. A hostile witness is sometimes known as an adverse witness.\n\nExternal links"
