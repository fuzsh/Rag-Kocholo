        "text": "The first installment in the new Kate Ford mystery series by debut author Leigh Adams\n\nWhen single mom and computer security specialist Kate Ford is suddenly and mysteriously put on administrative leave, she finds herself drawn into the drama of a lurid kidnapping case with ties to her company. Kate has enough on her plate dealing with a condition that leaves her extra-sensitive to stimuli, but the case is too juicy to leave untouched.\n\nBut what begins as simple curiosity quickly leads her to the countryâ€™s darkest corners of power and leaves her and her family the target of a ruthless network of war profiteers, who will stop at nothing to protect their billion-dollar interests in Hostile Witness, the first in this sharp and engaging series.\n\nSuzanne Elise Freeman spent her childhood watching her father act on stage, and causing mischief in the booth while he was on-air for the local radio station. She inherited her love of storytelling from him (even playing his daughter in On Golden Pond), and her passion for reading from her mother. Suzanne now works as a narrator and professional actor in projects ranging from television and movies to Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde. Born and raised in Minnesota, Suzanne now makes her home in Los Angeles."
