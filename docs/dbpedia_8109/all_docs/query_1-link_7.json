        "text": "Perjury prosecutions are hard to win, and therefore are not often brought. It is hard to think of a situation in which both \"yes\" and \"no\" would be subject to a perjury prosecution.\n\nThis Justia page says that for statements made under oath, one must prove the following elements to establish a case for perjury:\n\nA person took an oath to truthfully testify, declare, depose, or certify, verbally or in writing;\n\nThe person made a statement that was not true;\n\nThe person knew the statement to be untrue;\n\nThe person made the false statement willfully; and\n\nThe subject matter of the statement was material to the proceeding in which it was made.\n\nA US DOJ page on Elements Of Perjury -- Specific Intent says:\n\nThe third element of a perjury offense is proof of specific intent, that is, that the defendant made the false statement with knowledge of its falsity, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake or faulty memory. United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94 (1993). Section 1621 requires that the defendant have acted \"willfully\"; the section 1623 requirement is to act \"knowingly.\" In practice, these standards are virtually identical, although the government need not prove both willfulness and knowledge to sustain a section 1623 prosecution. United States v. Fornaro, 894 F.2d 508, 512 (2d Cir. 1990). Under either statute, the government must demonstrate the defendant voluntarily made the false statement with knowledge of its falsity. If the defendant believed his or her statement to be true when it was made, even though it was false, this essential element will not have been proven.\n\nSmith could reply \"Either 'yes' or 'no' would be a misleading answer. I would prefer to give a more detailed answer. May I do so?\" If, after that, the Judge insists on a Yes or No answer (which does happen but none too often) I think it would be very hard indeed to make a case for perjury from the answer.\n\nSuch a request to expand the answer would make the \"willful\" element almost impossible to establish.\n\nSmith could also ask to consult counsel before giving an answer, and it would be unusual for this to be refused. If Smith had gone though a plea of 5th amendment and immunity process, it is likely that Smith would have consulted a lawyer during the process, and pretty much certain that Smith had a chance to do so."
