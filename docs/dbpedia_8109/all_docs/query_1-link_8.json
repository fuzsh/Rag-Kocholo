        "text": "LawCrossing\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n14 min read\n\n·\n\nAug 27, 2019\n\n--\n\nWe asked attorneys throughout the United States what it means when a lawyer says “Permission to treat the witness as hostile?” Several attorneys responded and our readers might find what they said interesting. We hope you enjoy their answers.\n\nIt means that the witness you call to testify is not on your side, i.e., is ‘hostile’ to your client’s position. Nevertheless, you want to call that witness to testify in your case (in which you’re trying to prove your case, not disprove the other side’s) for other reasons, i.e., to fill in some facts that need to be stated for you to satisfy your burden of putting into evidence all of the facts necessary to demonstrate your entitlement to bring the claims your client has asserted. If the Judge accepts your assertion that the witness is hostile to your case, you are permitted to ‘lead’ the witness with questions like, ‘isn’t it true that the light was red when you first observed the blue car?’ If the witness is not ‘hostile’ the lawyer is not permitted to ‘lead’ the witness, i.e., to suggest the answer to the question. All you’re allowed to do is to ask open-ended questions like ‘where were you on the 20th of March? Who, if anyone else, was also there?’\n\nVictoria Pynchon\n\nTreating a witness as hostile is a mechanism to cross examine the witness when there are circumstances that dictate this. Here are 2 such circumstances:\n\nWhen you have called a witness in your own case in chief but they are an unfavorable witness or an ‘adverse witness,’ you may treat the witness as hostile and cross examine the witness. You technically do not have to request permission from the Judge but it is always good form and respectful if you do request such permission.\n\nWhen you have called a witness and are performing direct examination of this witness (because you believed they would testify as a favorable witness) but they start changing their story and are not cooperating, you may request permission to treat the witness as an adverse witness (aka ‘hostile’). This allows the attorney to cross examine the witness.\n\nCorri D. Fetman, Esq.\n\nUnder the rules of evidence, you are not supposed to ask leading questions of your own witness because leading questions suggest the answer. In other words, you can spoon feed answers to your witnesses, and that’s not what the courts want. They want you to ask open ended questions so the witness can testify based on what they know instead of what the attorney tells them.\n\nFor example, if you call a witness to testify that the light was red when the other side crashed into your client, the attorney cannot ask:\n\n“Isn’t it true that the light was red?”\n\nInstead, they should ask ‘What color was the light?’ This way the witness answers based on their own experience.\n\nFor the first question, the other side’s attorney would object to the question as “leading.”\n\nHowever, if the witness is ‘hostile’ for whatever reason then you may ask the court to declare the witness as hostile so you can ask leading questions, even if the attorney called the witness. Without such a showing, it is presumed that your own witnesses are not ‘hostile’, so opposing attorneys will object to your questions as leading.\n\nUsually, a ‘hostile’ witness is one that won’t answer your questions, shows a bias against you, or other similar reasons. I once had a hostile witness in a criminal case where I was a prosecutor, and the witness was a cooperating criminal. He wouldn’t answer my questions directly so I asked the judge to declare him a hostile witness.\n\nHere is Federal Rule of Evidence 611:\n\nRule 611. Mode and Order of Examining Witnesses and Presenting Evidence\n\n(a) Control by the Court; Purposes. The court should exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of examining…\n\nwww.law.cornell.edu\n\nMATTHEW S. JAMES\n\nJames Defense\n\nThe essence of the question is asking the court to recognize that the lawyer has called a witness to the stand on direct examination that is hostile to the claim or defense. Normally, a lawyer is given very little latitude when questioning witnesses favorable to her positions in the case. The lawyer is not supposed to ask a question that suggests the desired answer. Lawyers call these ‘leading questions.’ Think of them this way, a leading question essentially allows the lawyer to testify through the witness by designing questions that can only be answered in a yes/no format. Questions that begin with ‘Isn’t it true that…’ or that in themselves are statements not asking for open explanation are leading questions. If I as a trial lawyer called the witness to the stand there is a normal presumption that the witness is favorable to me, therefore I cannot ask leading questions.\n\nWhen the lawyer asks the court to treat the witness as hostile, the lawyer is asking permission to lead the witness to make specific points from a witness that normally does not want those points made. Normally, unless the witness is actually an opponent in the litigation or a hired expert witness for an opponent, the court will not allow the witness to be treated as a hostile witness until the witness exhibits hostility to the sponsoring lawyers positions in testimony with non-leading, open ended questioning.\n\n-Lin McCraw\n\nMcCrawGantt\n\nBoard Certified in Personal Injury Trial Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization\n\nThe short answer is that it means the lawyer is asking the judge if the lawyer may insert a ring through the witness’s nose and lead the witness wherever the lawyer leads.\n\nNow, why might that lawyer need that permission and why might the judge grant it? Well, broadly speaking, there are two rules that lawyers must follow at trial concerning the manner in which lawyers question witnesses. On direct examination, a lawyer generally may not ‘lead the witness.’ On cross-examination, the lawyer may do so, and generally will use nothing but leading questions.\n\nDirect examination is the type of examination that, generally speaking, occurs when a lawyer is putting on his client’s case-in-chief and calls a witness to the stand to testify. The lawyer must not lead the witness during questioning on direct examination. A leading question is one that suggests the answer, such as, ‘You left the bar at about 10:00 p.m. on that night, correct?’ ‘Yes.’ But if the lawyer has the witness on direct examination, the lawyer may not lead. Instead, the lawyer has to resort to who, what, why, when, and how questions, or ‘Please explain to the jury . . .’ or ‘Please tell the Court . . .’ So, back to our example about the guy leaving the bar, on direct examination the question becomes, ‘Now, on the night of the accident, Mr. Client, about what time did you leave the bar?’\n\nOn cross examination, which occurs when the lawyer is questioning a witness called or clearly associated with an adverse party, the lawyer is permitted to lead the witness. Cross examination is great fun for trial lawyers, because in essence, they get to do the testifying. In theory, the lawyer just puts the words in the witness’s mouth, and ideally all the witness says is yes or no. And as a result, the lawyer has much greater control over the course of the testimony. Well-coached witnesses will fight you, but there are other techniques for dealing with that problem. By contrast, direct examination involves much less control by the lawyer and can be more challenging for that reason.\n\nSo what’s with this permission-to-treat-witness-as-hostile question? Well, on occasion a lawyer may have to call a witness in his client’s case-in-chief who is just not all that fond of the lawyer’s client. Now, if that witnesses is someone clearly identified with an adverse party in the case-let’s say plaintiff calls to the stand in her case-in-chief an employee of the corporate defendant-then the lawyer may get to call the witness ‘under cross-examination.’ In that instance, the lawyer can start with leading questions right out of the gate, from the first question. But let’s suppose the witness I have to call is a former employee of my client and for reasons totally unrelated to this case, that ex-employee is just not a real fan of my client anymore. The judge probably will not permit me to call the witness in my client’s case-in-chief ‘on cross examination’ right out of the box. Instead, I may have to begin the questioning as if on direct examination with my usual non-leading, who, what, where, when, and why questions. If, however, the witness starts going off on my client, clearly demonstrating hostility and damaging my oh-so-well-crafted story for the jury, then I turn to the judge and say, ‘Your Honor, may I have permission to treat the witness as hostile?’ And if the judge grants that permission, I may now start using leading questions to get the witness to where I want to go.\n\n-Charles Penot\n\nThe Law Offices of Charles Penot, PLLC\n\nAn angry witness is stewing on the witness stand poised to pounce at any moment on our hero — the social pariah of a lawyer who is taking on corrupt government, big business, or vile criminals. As our hero fires off several rounds of questions, he’s outmatched by the cunning of the witness. Until suddenly, our hero screams out, ‘Permission to treat the witness as hostile?’ The judge readily grants the motion and a high stakes drama unfolds which eventually leads to the witness’s shocking confession before a stunned jury.\n\nBut permission to treat a witness as hostile isn’t usually all that exciting. The rules of evidence allow attorneys to use leading questions in cross examination against the opposing counsel’s witness. A leading question is a question that implies the answer and usually involves a yes or no question. For example, these types of questions might start with ‘Isn’t it true you….”\n\nUsually, these types of questions are improper with one’s own witnesses. The jury needs to hear testimony from the witness, not the lawyer. So, a lawyer should ask his own witness open ended questions such as who, what, where, when, why, and how. The idea behind the rules is that the opposing counsel’s witnesses may be biased or untruthful and leading questions are a tool to fully examine the accuracy of a witness’s statement, whereas one’s own witnesses must be free to explain what he or she witnessed and not influenced by an attorney trying to win a case. And yet there are times when the attorney’s own witness is evasive or prone to be hostile by virtue of the circumstances of the case. In those times, a court may grant latitude to use leading questions because the attorney’s own witness is not much different from that of opposing counsel. This is a very common tool when witnesses recant prior testimony.\n\nWhile this fun declaration is usually not as exciting as it’s portrayed in the media, it’s a very useful tool to the skilled lawyer to get to the bottom of the matter.\n\n-Mark Heath, criminal defense attorney,\n\nhttp://www.jacksonwhitelaw.com/"
