        "text": "Part I\n\nIndictment\n\n1\n\nWHAT I HAVE LEARNED through my short and disastrous legal career is that in law, as in life, the only rational expectation is calamity. Take my first case as a lawyer.\n\nThere were three of us at the start, fresh out of law school, hanging up our shingles together because none of the large and prosperous firms in Philadelphia would have us. We were still young then, still wildly optimistic, still determined to crack it on our own. Guthrie, Derringer and Carl. I’m Carl. All it would take, we figured, was one case, one accidental paraplegia, one outrageous sexual harassment, one slip of the surgeon’s knife, one slam-bam-in-your-face case to make our reputations, not to mention our fortunes. We were only one case away from becoming figures of note in the legal community that had so far left us out in the cold. But before that grand and munificent case came walking through our door, we were sitting with our feet on our desks, reading the newspapers, waiting for anything.\n\nI’ve got something right here for you, Victor, said Samuel R. Sussman, dropping a document on my desk. He was a bellicose little man who leaned forward when he talked and did annoying things like jab his finger into my chest for emphasis. But he was family.\n\nThe document was a demand note, personally guaranteed by a Winston Osbourne, representing a debt of one million dollars. Seven figures was two figures more than anything I had ever seen before.\n\nI picked up this baby at a discount, said my Uncle Sammy.\n\nWhat exactly do you want me to do with it?\n\nCollect it, he said with a finger jab. \"Osbourne says he’s broke and not going to pay me a cent. Get what you can off this society schmuck, and whatever you find keep a quarter for yourself. You’re getting married in the spring, right?\"\n\nThat’s the plan, I said.\n\nHe winked. Consider this my wedding gift.\n\nThat was how my first case out of law school came to be a collection. I had not intended to use my degree to collect debts, I had not gone to law school so I could most effectively foreclose on the houses of the poor, but at the start I was desperate for anything. And besides, Winston Osbourne was not your usual deadbeat.\n\nHe was the scion of an old Protestant family, born to wealth, to society, given every advantage withheld from me, and through talent, luck, and sheer perseverance he became bankrupt. Tall, finely manicured, with a prosperous round face and sincere thin lips, he was of the Bryn Mawr Osbournes, an old and revered family, blue of blood, properly Mayflowered through a line of cousins, listed with the Biddles and the Ambers and the Peppers in the Social Register. In every expression, in every gesture, Osbourne’s breeding showed. He looked like a somebody, one wasn’t sure exactly whom, but a somebody who was a something and I guess that was how he managed to borrow so much money on his personal guarantee, money he invested in a huge tract of undeveloped land in Whitpain Township, seeking to reap the miracle benefits of subdivision. Real estate is the only sure thing, he used to say, jaw locked, chin up, because they simply can’t make any more of it. As he strode across his glorious acreage in Whitpain Township, planning the location of the fine luxury homes he would build there, he must not have noticed the strange foul liquid, pale and sulfurous, like the earth’s own bile, seeping into each of his footprints. Within six months of buying the property Winston Osbourne faced environmental catastrophe, and within a year he was in utter default.\n\nSo you’re the grubby little shyster who’s chasing my money, Winston Osbourne said to me when I first hauled him into my office in search of his assets. He was wearing a perfect gray suit, Gucci loafers, his sandy hair was trimmed close and neat, a gold Rolex flashed from beneath his cuff, and he actually said that. Well, not in those exact words, maybe, but that’s what he was thinking. It was as clear as the cleft in his chin. What he actually said was, I’ve lost almost everything I ever had, Victor, and what little I have left is judgment proof. But I’m willing to pay you ten thousand dollars to end this. Believe me, Victor, that is the most you’ll ever get from me.\n\nI rejected his offer, and though I had a chip with which to bargain him higher, to Jew him up as it were, I thought the wiser play was to hold onto it, to flash it elsewhere in an effort to pry loose the entire million. I had no intention of letting him off the hook that was buried deep within his properly locked jaw. Winston Osbourne represented something to which I knew I could never ascend but my exclusion from which I could never quite accept. His old-line family name, the glorious prospects handed him at birth, his natural charm, even his bland sandy good looks, I resented it all, and for all of it he would pay. That was why that very day the process server was delivering a subpoena to Osbourne’s house in exclusive Gladwyne, ordering his wife to appear in my offices for deposition. I had plans for Mrs. Osbourne.\n\nShe was a handsome woman, elegant tweed suit, skin surgically tight around her blue eyes, pearls, hair that was done, I mean really done, a hundred and forty dollars’ worth of done, and I had her just where I wanted her, in our conference room, across the table from me, required to answer all my questions and sworn to tell the truth. She had chosen to come without counsel, which pleased me.\n\nHow many cars do you and your husband own, Mrs. Osbourne? I asked.\n\nThree, she said in a reedy, masculine voice. There is the station wagon.\n\nThat’s a Volvo, right?\n\nRight, she said. It is a Volvo. Then there is the blue sedan.\n\nA BMW?\n\nFrom your tone of voice it sounds like a crime, Mr. Carl.\n\nAnd the other? I asked.\n\nA vintage car my husband maintains. His toy, really, but quite valuable. It was his father’s.\n\nA Duesenberg.\n\nYes, that’s right. We have an old Lincoln, for transporting our dogs to the shows, but that’s hardly worth anything anymore. It’s almost four years old.\n\nSo that makes four cars total.\n\nYes, I suppose, said Mrs. Osbourne.\n\nAnd in whose names are the titles to these cars?\n\nMine and my husband’s.\n\nEven the Duesenberg?\n\nYes, Mr. Carl, she said, confidently stroking her pearls. Everything is in both of our names and, as you know, I’ve signed nothing.\n\nI knew that, yes I did. In Pennsylvania, property owned by a husband and wife together cannot be grabbed to satisfy the individual debts of either, so long as they remain married. Mrs. Osbourne, as best as I could determine, owed nothing to no one, not even to American Express. She had not guaranteed the loan and therefore all property she owned jointly with her husband was safely hidden from my grasp, so long as they remained married. And everything Winston Osbourne owned, his house, his cars, his bank accounts, even his damn Rolex, everything he owned he owned jointly with his wife. Well, almost everything.\n\nYou own a house in Gladwyne, Mrs. Osbourne, is that right?\n\nYes. The title is in both of our names.\n\nHas the house been appraised?\n\nFor insurance purposes, yes. It was appraised at two and a half million dollars. But that is our house, we live there, we raised our children there, we would never think of selling.\n\nYou’re aware, aren’t you, Mrs. Osbourne, that your husband owes Mr. Sussman a million dollars.\n\nI am aware that Mr. Sussman is a speculator who bought that note for an absurdly low amount and now wants to grab his handful of flesh. My husband is a wonderful man, Mr. Carl, and I love him very much. But he is not the cleverest of businessmen, not as sharp, I am sure, as your Mr. Sussman. Anyone who lends my husband money does so at his own risk.\n\nI actually admired Mrs. Osbourne as she sat in our crummy little conference room and so bravely defended her husband’s standard of living. If I was in less need of my twenty-five percent share of Winston Osbourne’s cash I might have thought twice about what I was planning to do. But even after a second thought I would have continued. My investigation had uncovered information of which Mrs. Osbourne might not have been aware and of which I assumed it was my duty to apprise her.\n\nYou own a property in Aspen, is that right, Mrs. Osbourne?\n\nA condominium, yes. The children love to ski.\n\nAnd that is in both of your names?\n\nOf course.\n\nAnd there is the property in Palm Beach.\n\nYes, but that is not ours. That is owned by Winston’s mother. Winston’s grandfather built it, it is a fabulous place, really. Have you been to Palm Beach, Mr. Carl?\n\nNo.\n\nWhere do you winter?\n\nIn front of the television.\n\nI see. Well, the house in Palm Beach is not ours. We are permitted to use it, but when we are there we are guests. My understanding is that Winston’s mother has willed it to Winston’s brother, Richard.\n\nSo my patience would not be rewarded.\n\nNo, I’m afraid not. The entire family is aware of Winston’s current troubles. Whatever is to be left is being left to the children. Winston has made you an offer, has he not?\n\nAnd there is the boat, I continued, ignoring her comment about the offer. You own a boat.\n\nYes. She sighed. He named it after me. We leave it in Florida.\n\nHow big is the boat?\n\nSomething like forty feet, I’m not sure. Winston is the sailor. He is quite dashing in his white ducks and blue blazer.\n\nIn whose name is the boat titled?\n\nIsn’t this getting repetitious, Mr. Carl? It is in both of our names. Everything is in both of our names.\n\nIncluding the condominium in Atlantic City?\n\nWe don’t own a condominium in Atlantic City.\n\nAre you sure? I said. There is a condo in a building right on the Boardwalk titled to Winston Osbourne. Let me show you a copy of the deed. I’ll mark this P. 12.\n\nThere must be some mistake, you must be thinking of another man. We don’t own a condominium in Atlantic City.\n\nThe person living there identified your husband as the owner.\n\nI’m not aware of a condominium in Atlantic City.\n\nWell, this person living there now says she doesn’t pay rent to Mr. Osbourne, and I was wondering if she paid the rent to you. Any such rent would be attachable on behalf of Mr. Sussman.\n\nNo, of course I am not receiving the rent.\n\nPerhaps you know the person living in your husband’s apartment, a Miss LeGrand?\n\nNo.\n\nLet me show you a picture. I’ll mark this P. 13.\n\nWhat is this? This is a brochure of some sort.\n\nYes, for a gentlemen’s club called the Pussy Willow. Why don’t you look through it. I’m referring to the section about the exotic dancers. Let me show you. The woman right there.\n\nTiffany LeGrand?\n\nOh, so you do know her, I said, even though the shaking of her head, her dazed eyes, opened brutally, unnaturally wide, the death grip with which she now held onto her pearls, all of it stated with total clarity that no, no, she did not know her, had never heard of her, no.\n\nI ran into Winston Osbourne again the gray and tremulous fall of which now I speak, a full six years after I had begun my relentless search for his final dollar. Halfway up 21st Street from Chestnut, just before my small and decrepit office building, yawned an alleyway. There was a stink to that alley, it was where the dumpsters were stored for the buildings on either side; it smelled of fish bones from the seafood restaurant on 22nd Street, of rotting vegetables from the Korean grocery beneath my office. Two homeless men shared the alley as sure as if they had signed a lease. They pissed in the entranceways of all the surrounding buildings, like wolves marking their territory. They panhandled, drank out of brown paper bags, shouted obscenities when the mood struck, and sometimes actually worked by carrying a sandwich board for Condom Nation, a prophylactic store, back and forth in the neighborhood. Every time I walked up 21st Street, I accelerated as I approached the alley, keeping my eyes straight and my shoulders hunched, trying to avoid any contact with my neighbors. I had just passed the gap one night that fall when I heard my name being called and felt a grab at my arm.\n\nI whirled away from the contact, expecting to see one of the homeless men, but who I saw instead was Winston Osbourne. His raincoat was grimed, his hair long and stringy, his once prosperous face now drawn and sallow. His fingernails struck me particularly; where they had been manicured and glossy they were now long, yellow, opaque with ridges. They were the fingernails of a corpse.\n\nVictor, he said, his voice still dripping with superiority. We’ve been discussing you, Victor.\n\nYou should have your lawyer contact me, Mr. Osbourne, I said, staring at his nails. I can only speak to your lawyer.\n\nHe took a rolling step toward me. There was a limp now that hadn’t been there before. Yes. But you see, I couldn’t afford to pay him. He took another step forward. Since the divorce I’ve gone through a difficult time, Victor. Much toil, much trouble. But I’m certain I can see my way clear of it now.\n\nThat’s good, Mr. Osbourne.\n\nBut I need to open a bank account, Victor, a local account for business purposes, and every time I try you end up attaching the funds. This has become very inconvenient for me.\n\nWith interest, Mr. Osbourne, you still owe Mr. Sussman almost nine hundred thousand dollars. My gambit with his wife had not worked as well as I had intended. Osbourne, sheared in the divorce settlement, had been able to secrete most of what little his wife’s lawyer had left him before I could file my attachments. Foreign bank accounts, straw-man holding companies. He was much better at hiding money than at making it.\n\nI’m aware of exactly all that I owe Sussman, said Winston Osbourne. And I do wish I could pay him back for everything. You too, Victor. In fact, plans are being laid this very instant to pay you back. But I need to open a bank account. I can’t revive my prospects without a bank account, now can I, Victor?\n\nHave you talked to a lawyer about declaring bankruptcy?\n\nYes, of course. But I’m an Osbourne, Victor, something you can’t begin to understand. He shuffled his feet uncomfortably. And not all my debts are dischargeable, I’ve been told.\n\nWhat do you want, Mr. Osbourne?\n\nI want you to leave me alone. All I’m asking is for you to behave reasonably. This is your last chance. I’m willing to pay you to leave me alone.\n\nHow much?\n\nTen thousand dollars, like before. But, unfortunately, nothing for at least a year.\n\nMr. Osbourne, you still have a vintage Duesenberg hidden somewhere. I believe you have money stashed in the Cayman Islands, as well as in certain Swiss banks. I understand you recently traveled to Florida, out of season, yes, but still Florida. Frankly, I think you can do better, Mr. Osbourne, than a slim promise of maybe ten thousand dollars to be paid in a year.\n\nYou can’t know how difficult it’s been for me since the divorce.\n\nFlorida. The Sunshine State.\n\nHis head dropped slightly. My daughter insisted I go with her.\n\nWhere is your Duesenberg, Mr. Osbourne?\n\nIt’s not worth anything anymore. It’s too old, I haven’t been able to keep it in repair. For your own good, Victor, take my offer.\n\nTurn your car over to the sheriff, Mr. Osbourne, and we’ll talk.\n\nI walked away from him, toward the door of the building, when I heard him shout, By God, man. I just want to be able to open a damn bank account like a human being.\n\nI couldn’t erase the image of Winston Osbourne and his fingernails from my mind for the whole of that season. There was a time in his life when the wealthy, handsome, socially prominent, socially registered, socially social Winston Osbourne was everything I ever wanted to be. Now, as I struggled with the frustrations in my life, he was everything I feared I would become. The case we had been waiting for, the slam-bam-in-your-face case, had never come, and we too now had bills we couldn’t meet, dunning letters came by the bushelful, we couldn’t pay our secretary week to week, not to mention the office rent. One of my partners had already bailed and I couldn’t really blame him, though I did. Six years out of law school and I was flat-out broke, one step up from the grimed broken figure I saw outside my office. I had once bitterly resented Winston Osbourne for all he was born to, but now I feared falling to his depths and so I resented him all the more. If he wanted to open a bank account that meant there was money and if there was money, by God, I would get my hands on it. Every last dollar, you bastard, every last dollar until you die.\n\nI see now that I was suffering a profound weariness that autumn. The disappointments of my life had worn me down, not to mention that I was alone and lonely and had been both for far too long. Whatever optimism I had once held had been supplanted by a deep and gnawing resentment of everyone and everything. Then in that sad gray fall there finally arrived the chance for which I had been waiting. It was an opportunity rooted in murder, premised on betrayal, an opportunity that required the suspension of all I once held sacrosanct, but still there it was. And the only question was whether I was man enough to pay its price.\n\nWhen I think back upon that season I see its inauguration in the apparitional appearance of the ruined Winston Osbourne, but from there it spun furiously out of control. It was the season of my opportunity, yes, but also a season of corruption, of treachery, a calamitous season of self-delusion and abnegation. Most of all it was a season of love, a sweat-soaked love that still leaves me gasping when I awake with a start in the middle of the night and remember. It was a season that promised my most desperate dreams and stroked my deepest fears.\n\nIt was fall in Philadelphia.\n\n2\n\nONE LIBERTY PLACE was a huge granite and glass rocket that blasted beyond the staid and squared-off Philadelphia skyline until it lost itself in smoky autumnal skies, the highest, grandest, most prestigious building in the reviving City of Brotherly Love. Which explained why the law firm of Talbott, Kittredge and Chase had leased the fifty-fourth, fifty-fifth, and fifty-sixth floors for its offices even before construction was completed. Talbott, Kittredge and Chase was the city’s most entrenched law firm. It was the home of congressmen and mayors; it had yielded six judges to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and one to the Supreme Court. It was the dream of every law student who sought the brightest of the golden rings the law had to offer. Only the best was good enough for Talbott, Kittredge and Chase.\n\nI applied for a position at Talbott, Kittredge as a second-year law student. I wrote a spiffy letter and goosed my resume until I didn’t recognize myself on its crisp ivory paper. I was not law review and my grade point average was merely mediocre, but still I sent my application off with a queer confidence, sure that my true quality would shine through the flat black type, and for all I know it did. But only the best was good enough for Talbott, Kittredge and Chase. I didn’t even rate an interview.\n\nI wasn’t consciously thinking of this rejection as I walked through the great stone lobby of One Liberty Place and stepped onto the marble-walled elevator seven years after sending off that letter, but as I rose to the fifty-fourth floor my resentment rose with me, and not just a resentment of Talbott, Kittredge and Chase. There was Dechert Price & Rhoads, there was Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, there was Rawle & Henderson, White & Williams, there was Drinker, Biddle, and Reath. There was even Wolf, Block, Schorr & Solis-Cohen. Out of law school I applied to the top twenty-five firms in the city and they all passed on my offer to slave in their libraries and work outrageous hours so their partners could become obscenely rich. Cut adrift, I was forced to stoop lower than I could ever have imagined and work for myself.\n\nBy the fall of my visit to Talbott, Kittredge and Chase there were only two of us left in our sad little firm, we were now merely Derringer and Carl. Our third partner, Guthrie, had fled. Seeing the inevitability of our failure, Guthrie had found himself a rich girl with family connections and had ridden her name to a job with Blaine, Cox, Amber & Cox, one of the fine old firms that had initially rejected us all. Where he found his young and prosperous wife, now Lauren Amber Guthrie, was in my bedroom, which made his leaving for the money and the prestige and the wood-paneled offices of his new employer particularly galling. The bastard left without a backward glance and he took our best cases with him. That left just Derringer and me and the bills we couldn’t pay and the files Guthrie didn’t think were worth stealing. One of those files was Saltz v. Metropolitan Investors, in the service of which my resentment and I were rising like a firecracker to the fifty-fourth floor of One Liberty Place.\n\nThe elevator opened on a broad and open lobby, tastefully floored with a rich wood parquet and furnished with antique couches. TALBOTT, KITTREDGE & CHASE read the glossy brass letters tacked above the receptionist’s desk. Two of the walls were of glass, offering killer views of the city south and east into New Jersey, with the blue sweep of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge spanning the breadth of the Delaware. The other walls were paneled in cherry, waxed and buffed to a military shine. But it was not those walls that were most impressive, nor the huge oriental carpets nor the couches nor the fine wood cocktail tables nor the gorgeous blonde receptionist who smiled warmly at me the moment I stepped off the elevator. What was most impressive was the enormity of the space itself, a breathtaking expanse bigger than a basketball court, a tract with no purpose other than projecting an image of elegance and wealth and power at fifty bucks a square foot. I couldn’t help myself from doing the math. With what they spent each year on that lobby alone they could buy me five times over.\n\nVictor Carl to see William Prescott, I said to the receptionist.\n\nFine, Mr. Carl. Take a seat and I’ll tell him you’re here.\n\nI stepped toward one of the couches and then turned back to the receptionist, who was already on the phone. She was a strikingly beautiful woman, this receptionist. The kind of woman who should only exist in perfume ads or on car show platforms. Her hair was pale and windswept, as if even while I stood in the enormous calm of that lobby, she was perched on the deck of an ocean yacht.\n\nDo I know you? I asked. That was my line at the time, though it has since been discarded, like all the others, due to continued and unmitigated failure.\n\nShe looked me over carefully and then gave a light toss to her oceanic hair. No, I don’t think so, she said.\n\nIt was worth a try.\n\nNot in this lifetime, Mr. Carl, she said with a look that exiled me to one of the couches at the far end of the lobby.\n\nBut she was right, of course. Women like that did not exist for guys like me, they existed for the wealthy, the witty, the thrillingly articulate, for ballplayers and movie stars and presidential aides. And, of course, they were for adorning the offices of those brilliant firms like Talbott, Kittredge and Chase that refused to let me join their ranks. Oh man, I hated this place, I hated it so bad I could taste it.\n\nMr. Carl, said a pretty, sharp-suited woman who had crossed the broad expanse of lobby to the couch where I was sitting. I had been waiting for half an hour, pretending to be interested in a copy of the Wall Street Journal I picked off one of the cocktail tables in the pathetic hope that the receptionist might mistake me for a corporate client checking on the value of his stock options. Come with me, please, the woman in the suit said. I’ll take you to Mr. Prescott’s office.\n\nI followed her up a flight of stairs and through twists and turns of broad hallways. I passed desks of grim secretaries typing efficiently into their word processors and caught glimpses of well decorated rooms from which worried associates darted back and forth. There was a hum of activity in those offices, a melange of sound emanating from the fluorescent lights, from the computer fans, from the laser printers squeezing out page after page after page, from the incessant soft ring of the phones and quiet voices explaining that Mr. Wilson or Ms. Antonelli or Mr. Schwartz was on another line but would get right back to you. To a lawyer the sound was of more than just run-of-the-mill office activity. It was the sound of billable hours, it was the sound of money. It was not a sound I heard too often. In our hallway what I heard instead was the hush of financial desperation.\n\nShe ushered me into a large corner office, an office bigger than my apartment. The view stretched south and west. Straight ahead Broad Street ran like a mighty river to Veterans Stadium in the distance, and to the right I could see old Franklin Field and the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, whose law school, along with Harvard’s and Yale’s and Stanford’s and NYU’s and all the other top ten’s, had rejected my application. Prescott’s office was wood clad, like a judge’s chambers, furnished with an elegant living room set at one end, a long oak table piled with briefs and exhibits in the middle, and a large, gilded desk in the windowed corner, with two tapestry-covered chairs before it and a low wooden credenza behind it. Across one of the walls was a flurry of framed photographs, pictures of mayors and congressmen, senators and presidents, each smiling as they stood next to a tall, stern-faced patrician, the photographs inscribed across the bottoms. On the far wall, above the living room set, hung a large neorealist painting of two boxers circling each other against an angry yellow background. The boxers’ bodies were clenched, they peered over their gloves, waiting for the moment to explode into violence. The painting was as tense as a coiled spring and the eyes of the fighters were filled with hate. It was a litigator’s painting.\n\nMr. Prescott will be right in, said my guide. Make yourself comfortable. She gestured at one of the chairs before the desk and I sat like a trained puppy.\n\nOn the credenza was a picture of the perfect family, three smiling beef-fed kids, a pretty wife, the tall patrician once again. In another the children were older, the wife wider, they stood before a beautiful country home with a wide veranda surrounded by thickly leafed trees, the patrician now in a wicker chair with a newspaper and a pipe. In that sad fall of my life such teeming family bliss seemed the most remote of all the ambitions I had so far failed to achieve.\n\nI had never met William Prescott III but I had heard of him, everyone had. He was a great man, this William Prescott, the pride of his old and revered family. Skull and Bones at Yale, the law review at Harvard, he was a former deputy attorney general, a former ambassador to some obscure country in South America, a former Chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar. He was a pillar of the Republican Party and served on the boards of the Art Museum, the Free Library, the Philadelphia Orchestra. And now he was the top trial lawyer, the prime rainmaker, the managing partner at Talbott, Kittredge and Chase. One had to wonder what price he had paid for such success. He had everything a lawyer could ever want, but was he happy? Well, to tell from the pictures, he was ecstatic. I had never met this William Prescott but already I despised him.\n\nVictor, thank you for coming up to see me, said a grayer version of the man in all the photographs.\n\nI stood quickly, like a thief caught in the act, when William Prescott swept into the room. He entered like an emissary from some great nation-state. Very tall, very thin, with narrow lips and high prominent cheekbones, he peered from beneath bushy black eyebrows with blue eyes of startling clarity. He was not a classically handsome man, his nose was too long and his lips too thin, but he was a compelling presence, the very image of integrity. He wore a navy blue pinstriped Brooks Brothers suit, a banker’s suit, which he kept formally buttoned as he reached out in greeting. My hand was swallowed by his. Despite his slenderness, I had the unpleasant sensation that had he wanted to squeeze my hand until the bones crumbled he could have.\n\nYou know Madeline Burroughs, Victor, I’m sure, he said as he led me to the living room set beneath the painting of the boxers.\n\nI hadn’t seen her there, my attention drawn so completely to Prescott and his presence. Yes, of course.\n\nHello, Victor, said Madeline. She was a round-faced, frumpish woman who dressed and acted like a spinster though still in her twenties. She smiled awkwardly for a moment; it was like a fist opening and closing.\n\nSit down, please, both of you, said Prescott. His voice was precise, graveled with age but still charmingly formal, like the wide unpaved driveways leading to Versailles. He came from the same world as Winston Osbourne and that was in his voice too, but where Osbourne’s voice betrayed all his innate snideness, in Prescott’s it was well hidden if it existed at all. I sat in one of the easy chairs, he sat directly across from me on the couch, leaning back and crossing his legs in a way that put me immediately at ease. Madeline sat tensely in the bend of the couch off to the side.\n\nI may call you Victor? he asked.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nNormally I love the autumn, don’t you? But the grayness of the skies this year takes all the pleasure out of it. It might be time to visit our Miami office. His blue eyes smiled at me and then turned cold. \"Saltz v. Metropolitan Investors, Victor. That’s why we’re here today. How long have we been tangling over this case?\"\n\nThree years, sir, I said. The sir came instinctively, drawn out by his very demeanor and appearance. He seemed to accept my deference as his due.\n\nYou’ve been hanging on all that time like a bulldog. Three years on a complaint not worth the filing fee. A bulldog. Good for you, Victor. Now Madeline here, one of our toughest litigators, has filed four motions to dismiss but the judge has kept it alive out of mercy.\n\nJudge Tifaro is too timid to make a decision, said Madeline, breaking into the discussion.\n\nWhat you’re both trying to say, I said, is that all your attempts to kill our case have failed.\n\nYes, said Prescott, giving me an appraising look. That is it exactly.\n\nSaltz was the weakest of those cases my ex-partner Guthrie left behind when he fled our firm on his way to success. A real estate limited partnership had gone bad, as they all seemed to have gone bad, and Guthrie had convinced the investors to sue those who had syndicated and sold the deal. There was a lengthy complaint with wild allegations of fraud and conspiracy. We had the case on a one-third contingency. I had thrown away a pot of money investigating only to find that there was no real evidence of anything other than stupidity on the part of all involved. My investigation wasn’t helped by the fact that a crucial witness, the accountant who prepared the prospectus, a weasel named Stocker, had disappeared, taking certain of his clients’ trust funds with him. Without him we had nothing but a hope that we could bluff our way into a settlement. Which was why I was there, to take one last look at my hand, to press my lips together, to look around the table and back at my hand and then to raise, confidently, in the faint chance the bastards would fold. Not likely. I had been asking for half a million, hoping they’d give me a counteroffer in the mid-five figures, upon which I planned to leap.\n\nWould you like some coffee or a soft drink, Victor? asked Prescott. He reached to a phone sitting on the coffee table between us and pressed a button. The pretty woman who had led me to the office immediately appeared. Janice, a coffee for me, please. And for you, Victor?\n\nCoffee, black. Janice left without taking a request from Madeline.\n\nWe’re not here to argue, Victor, said Prescott, which was a lie, because that was precisely why we were there. The syndicators have asked that I take a more personal interest in this case as we approach the trial. Glancing through the file, I noticed your name wasn’t on the complaint. It was filed by a Samuel Guthrie.\n\nHe was my partner, but he left the firm.\n\nYes. Joined Blaine, Cox, Amber and Cox, didn’t he?\n\nThey gave him a very handsome offer.\n\nMarried an Amber, I understand. Their youngest, the pretty one. I was invited to the wedding but was overseas at the time.\n\nI couldn’t make it either, I said, though I hadn’t missed it because I was overseas. I think there was something on television I needed to see that night, The World of Disney on Ice maybe, or something.\n\nI suppose the marriage might have had something to do with the offer.\n\nSomething.\n\nThat leaves you with two lawyers now, is that right?\n\nYes, sir. Prescott had done more than merely glance through the file.\n\nI assume Mr. Guthrie took a number of his clients with him, he continued. But he didn’t take this case. Tell us why not, Victor.\n\nBecause it barks, said Madeline.\n\nI glanced sideways at her and let out a soft growl under my breath.\n\nDo you know what the key to any successful law practice is, Victor? asked Prescott.\n\nI couldn’t help my bitter smile. Obviously not, sir.\n\nObjectivity, he said, with a rich man’s certainty. It’s all too easy in this business to take positions that satisfy our emotions but that ultimately hurt our clients. It’s all too easy to let our passions stir.\n\nI tried but failed to imagine passions stirring in the formal upright man before me.\n\nNow we’ve given you all our files and you’ve found nothing, he continued. His graveled voice, still precise and formal, now gained a touch of anger, just a hint, but just a hint was enough to send me slinking back in my chair. Some minor discrepancies between the information we received and what went out in the prospectus, yes, but not enough to show a pattern. And you won’t be able to prove reliance on the prospectus anyway. Nobody reads those things. You can be assured the jury will learn of the many charitable organizations our clients support, the many philanthropic boards they sit upon. And in the end the jurors will view your clients as fools with so much money they were willing to throw it away on any twisted tax shelter that promised they wouldn’t have to pay their fair share. Frankly, Victor, if we go to trial we’re going to bloody you, and you know it.\n\nHe paused when the door opened. Ah, Janice.\n\nShe came in with a large silver tray and laid it upon the low table. There was a silver coffeepot and two white china cups and a crystal creamer and a crystal sugar bowl with a fine silver spoon. On a doily set upon a china plate perched an array of fancy cookies. It looked as if the Queen were coming to join us. I was grateful for the respite as my eyes had begun watering. My eyes water whenever I am under attack, a condition that was hell in elementary school, and I was under attack now. In less than a minute Prescott had exposed every weakness in my case. As Janice poured for me, I tried to squeeze back the tears.\n\nThe project never made a dime, I said before taking a sip of coffee. It was so exquisite it startled me for a moment, rich and crisply bitter. I took another sip. As soon as you took our money it all went down the tubes. I’ll make that very clear for the jury.\n\nThe real estate market died on us, said Prescott. Everyone on the jury will know that. They can’t sell their houses either.\n\nYour projections weren’t even close.\n\nThey were only projections. We never claimed we could predict the future. He put a shrug into his voice. It was a business deal between businessmen that went bad. Business deals go bad every day without any fraud involved. We can go on all day like this, Victor, back and forth, but that’s no way to find common ground. Our clients want to fight to the end. Then he flashed the smile of a diplomat greeting an unworthy adversary whom protocol required him to flatter and said the words I had been waiting to hear. But I have convinced them that the economics are in favor of our working something out.\n\nI felt a thrill ripple through me just then, the thrill of a settlement on the horizon, of money in my bank. Without changing a card, my poker hand had grown brawny.\n\nKeeping his eyes focused on mine, he said, Madeline, what were the most recent figures discussed?\n\nPlaintiffs demanded half a million dollars, she said through a smirk. We offered five thousand.\n\nIt hadn’t seemed worth pursuing, I said.\n\nWell, let’s try, Victor, said Prescott. Even if you won everything you’d win what? A million dollars?\n\nWe’ve asked for punitives.\n\nYes, and we’ve asked for sanctions for the filing of a frivolous lawsuit. We’ll say a million. You received tax benefits on the losses of about thirty percent, so let’s put actual compensatory damages at seven hundred thousand. Now tell me honestly, Victor, since this is all off the record, at what do you put your chance of actually winning? Five percent? Ten percent?\n\nFifty-fifty? I hadn’t meant it to, but my answer ended up being phrased as a question.\n\nThat’s a joke, right? said Madeline.\n\nBe reasonable, Victor, said Prescott. We’re trying to work together here. Let’s put it at ten percent.\n\nIt’s not worth seventy thousand dollars, said Madeline.\n\nTen percent, Victor? Seventy thousand dollars. What do you say?\n\nOne third of seventy thousand dollars came to something like twenty-three grand, enough to pay off our firm’s bills and make payroll and rent for the next month. I had to hold myself back from shouting yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. It’s not enough, I said. You couldn’t try this case for less than a hundred thousand, and you still might lose. I’d go back to my clients with an offer of two hundred and fifty thousand.\n\nOf course you would, said Prescott.\n\nI told you it wasn’t worth discussing, said Madeline. Guthrie we could talk to, but Victor acts like he’s on some crusade.\n\nYou’re using my hourly rate against us, Victor, said Prescott. That doesn’t seem quite fair. Ninety thousand.\n\nI don’t set your fees, Mr. Prescott, I said, even as I figured. If we could pull in thirty thousand from this case, I thought, I could even take a draw, start to pay down my credit card bills. I put down the coffee cup so it wouldn’t rattle as my nerves started to pop. For two hundred thousand we could settle this today.\n\nOne hundred thousand dollars, Victor. And we won’t go higher.\n\nMadeline said, That’s way too high for this frivolous piece of…\n\nOne-ninety, I said, cutting her off.\n\nPrescott laughed. It was a deep, genuine laugh, warm in its way. It was so authoritative a laugh that I had to struggle not to join in, even though he was laughing at me. No, we’re not splitting the difference, Victor. One hundred thousand dollars, that’s as high as we go.\n\nThat’s not going to do it, I said. But threes started to jiggle like belly dancers before my eyes. Thirty-three, three hundred, thirty-three. Thirty-three, three hundred, thirty-three. It had a golden sound to it, like bangles sweeping one against the other during a slow, seductive dance. Thirty-three, three hundred, thirty-three. And thirty-three cents. One hundred and eighty thousand, I countered.\n\nYou’re disappointing me, Victor, said Prescott. I thought we could reach an accommodation. He leaned back again and looked away from me, toward the window and the view. I have instructed Madeline to begin trial preparations tomorrow. Once we start spending money on the trial, paying experts, compiling exhibits, organizing the documents, once we start all that, I can’t offer the same amount. So this offer is only good until you leave this office.\n\nI’ll tell you what, Mr. Prescott. For one hundred and eighty thousand dollars, we’ll disappear. We won’t say anything to the press, won’t sully the perfect reputations of your clients. No nasty trial. Nothing. The end.\n\nHe shrugged. That’s all a necessary precondition in any event. One hundred thousand dollars.\n\nI stood. That’s not enough.\n\nI’ll whip you in court, son.\n\nYou just might at that, sir.\n\nPrescott stared me down. I was supposed to turn to leave, that was the act, but the sound of those threes jangling bangling through my mind froze my feet in place and I stared back at him, waiting for him to save me.\n\nI’ll tell you what I’m willing to do, said Prescott. I hate doing this, I think I’m going too far, but you are a bulldog, Victor, and you don’t leave me much choice. What I’m willing to do is give you one more number. This number is a blue light special, do you understand? I want to hear a quick yes or no. If it’s yes we have a deal. If it’s no we’ll fight it out in court. Are you ready for the number, Victor?\n\nYes, sir, I said.\n\nOne hundred and twenty thousand dollars.\n\nThe division was so easy it couldn’t have been unintentional. Forty thousand dollars registered in my mind with the ringing clarity of a bell. In the blink of an eye I plotted my expenditures. Twenty thousand directly to the office, overdue salary to our secretary and receptionist, overdue rent, overdue use and occupancy tax, overdue dues due to the bar association. Blue Cross had been hounding us for money, as had West Publishing and Xerox, which had refused to service the machine because we were behind on our maintenance payments. All our copies came out badly streaked and gray, as if they were copies of copies of copies. We were short of stationery, manila folders, yellow pads; our postage meter hadn’t been reset in months. Twenty thousand dollars disappearing like so much drifting paper into the abyss of our failing legal practice. We’d put five in the bank to take care of another month’s nut, just in case, leaving fifteen grand to be split between Derringer and me, which, after paying overdue estimated taxes, would leave me with four thousand dollars. One of my credit cards was maxed, so I’d pay that down, and my student loans were deeply in default, maybe a payment or two would renew their patience, and I still owed my father the five thousand I had borrowed last year when things got very very tight.\n\nWe have a deal, Mr. Prescott, I said.\n\nHe slapped his palms onto his thighs and stood, smiling warmly, pumping my hand like I was a new father. Splendid. Just splendid. Madeline, he said without looking at her. Why don’t you get to work right away drawing up the papers. He said nothing more until she stood and, without saying farewell, left the office.\n\nI should get going too, I said. Tell my clients the news.\n\nNot just yet, Victor. You’re tenacious, I’ll give you that. A bulldog. Let’s take a moment together. I might have a proposition for you, son.\n\nHe put his arm around my shoulder. The gesture was so unexpected that I froze as if under attack.\n\nI might just have for you, he said, the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\n3\n\nCONNIE MACK, the ageless Philadelphia baseball magnate who coincidentally looked very much like William Prescott III, once said, Opportunity knocks at every man’s door, but I didn’t believe it for a second. There were men and women who toiled all the days of their lives without getting a single chance. I knew them, I was related to them, I was one. I had been waiting for it all my life and still it had never come for me, never called my name, never knocked on my door, never slipped itself through my mail slot. Or then again, maybe the post office had simply misplaced it, along with that letter I’d been expecting from Ed McMahon. No, it was the great myth of America that this is the land of opportunity. For guys like me, I had learned painfully, there was no such thing as opportunity, only a grind to wear away our spirits as it stole the heart from our lives day by day. So I was naturally skeptical. When someone like Prescott whispered the word opportunity in my ear, it generally meant the opportunity for him to take advantage of me.\n\nA brilliant man, said Prescott, gesturing toward a picture of himself standing beside a slouching President Nixon. It was an honor to work for him.\n\nI’m sure it was, I said. There were things I could say to him about Nixon the perjurer, the man who lied about his secret plan to end the war and then saturated Hanoi with his bombs, who resigned in disgrace and was saved from indictment only by presidential pardon, but this wasn’t the moment.\n\nOh, he made mistakes, of course, said Prescott. But in my mind that gives him all the more stature. He is a tragic hero, a man brought to power and glory through his brilliant, slightly paranoid will and brought to ruin by the same. But while he was at the top of his ride, he was a damn good president.\n\nI’m an admirer of Kennedy.\n\nOh, yes. He stepped over to another picture of a very youthful William Prescott III shaking hands with a smiling Jack Kennedy. We were standing before his wall of photographs, a shrine, really, to himself, as Prescott introduced me to the greats and near greats who had known him. I listened politely, fighting all the while to restrain the giddy joy I felt about the settlement we had reached in Saltz.\n\nAll charm and good looks, Kennedy, continued Prescott. But a bumbler, really. He stumbled into the Bay of Pigs, almost fumbled us into a nuclear war over Cuba, and then put us into Vietnam. November 22, 1963, was a terrible day, but frankly I think the country was better off because of it.\n\nKennedy had vision, I said.\n\nNo, not really. What did he care about civil rights before King started grabbing headlines? Now Reagan had vision. There was a large color photograph of Ronald Reagan with his arm around Prescott. He was a genuinely nice man, too. He wasn’t the brightest, but he didn’t have to be. There are a million smart bureaucrats in the federal government, that’s not what we need at the top. But Reagan’s vision was unrealistic. That’s why of all the presidents I’ve known, the one I admire most is Bush.\n\nHe guided me to a picture of himself with George and Barbara Bush. The Bushes were smiling warmly at Prescott, who was standing with a regal stiffness, staring straight into the camera.\n\nA fine man, said Prescott. A great leader. A true pragmatist in a world of ideologues. He was betrayed by his own people. That’s how the clown we have now slipped in.\n\nI voted for the clown, but this wasn’t the moment to bring that up either, though I did say, I’m not sure pure pragmatism is admirable in a politician.\n\nAnything else is just diddling, Victor. If you don’t concentrate on the practical consequences of your actions, what do you concentrate on, intent? Good intentions were not the problem with our presence in Vietnam, it was just that, practically, victory there was impossible. A quarter million French had been defeated by the Vietnamese, how did we think we could prevail? The only way to govern effectively is to look beyond the ideology, beyond the surface morality, right to the heart of the doing.\n\nBut what goals do you seek without an ideological framework?\n\n\"Peace, prosperity, justice, equality. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Goals are easy, everyone wants the same things, but a pragmatist won’t be misled by a false ideology and won’t let narrow restrictions on means get in his way. Lawyers are by their very nature pragmatists. Whether or not we’re in ideological agreement with our clients, our job is to win for them within the rules, no"
