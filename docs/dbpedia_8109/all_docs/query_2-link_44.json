Shut up!\n\n[laughing] I don't know what I would do\n\nif a judge told me to shut up.\n\nNo, sir! Especially when\n\nI was legally in the right.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nI will not shut up.\n\nObjections, How to Get Away With Murder.\n\nExplain why your eviction suit\n\nagainst Ms. Morelli was dropped, despite her inability\n\nto pay rent. Ms. Keating?\n\nIs it because her lost rent money was nothing,\n\ncompared to the millions you made,\n\nonce Ms. Stanley was out of your way?\n\n[gavel bangs]\n\nAnswer the question,\n\nSenator. Miss Keating, enough!\n\nI feel for her, she's making a strong point.\n\nIf you do not have the time to answer\n\nfor who bore the real cost of your development--\n\n[Man] Objection!\n\nThe judge has to rule on the objections\n\nand she should know to stop talking\n\nwhen she hears an objection and wait for the judge to rule.\n\nThe thousands who were displaced in the name\n\nof lining your pockets-- [gavel bangs]\n\n[Judge] Ms. Keating!\n\nContinuing after a judge has asked you\n\nto stop is very bad practice.\n\nThat is enough! Please, your honor!\n\nObjections, Suits.\n\nYou'd lie through your teeth\n\nabout it anyway, wouldn't you?\n\nObjection.\n\nMr. Evans, isn't it true that you're a--\n\nObjection, it's rule of trial practice 101,\n\nthat when a lawyer objects, the other lawyer waits\n\nand lets the judge rule on the objection.\n\nI just caught you in a lie. Objection, your honor.\n\nMr. Evans, my next move is gonna be--\n\nObjections are being raised repeatedly\n\nand the judge doesn't rule on it at all.\n\nJenny Griffith to the stand, and she's gonna testify\n\nthat you lied to her for years.\n\nObjection!\n\nThe most common objections are hearsay objections.\n\nBadgering. You rarely hear\n\na badgering the witness objection.\n\nShe's also gonna say that you were jealous\n\nof his mind-- Your honor!\n\n[Lawyer] Let me rephrase.\n\nInstead of ruling on the record,\n\nthe judge gives her a kind of hand gesture.\n\nThe judge has to rule on the objection,\n\notherwise there's a record\n\nthat there's been an objection and no ruling.\n\nObjection, objection, objection.\n\nThat's what the judge is supposed to do.\n\nMr. Specter is within his rights.\n\nIn the presence of royalty.\n\n[tiara dings]\n\nContinuance, Liar Liar.\n\nHow are we doing this morning, counsel?\n\nYour honor, I would like a continuance.\n\nA continuance is just an adjournment,\n\nso asking for a delay by a day or more.\n\nThis case has already been delayed.\n\nI realize that your honor, but I would really,\n\nreally, really like a continuance.\n\nHe's asking for the continuance\n\nbecause there's something impeding him\n\nfrom the ability to do his job.\n\nI'll have to hear good cause, counsel.\n\nIt's pretty accurate, actually,\n\nthat he'd be asked to show good cause.\n\nI can't lie!\n\nBut he shouldn't be lying in furtherance\n\nof his job, so he shouldn't get the continuance,\n\nwhich he doesn't.\n\nMotion for continuance denied.\n\n[gavel bangs]\n\nThere is a lot more gavel banging in TV\n\nand film than there is in real life.\n\nOrder! Order!\n\n[gavel banging]\n\nIt is a plea-- Pipe down.\n\nIn fact, I can't say I've ever\n\nhad a judge bang his gavel at me.\n\n[gavel bangs] [man groans]\n\nA defendant testifying, Law and Order.\n\nSo whoever actually pulled the trigger\n\nwould be the true slave to Allah\n\nand should be honored, is that correct?\n\nYou're just like Murdoch.\n\nYou're both enemies to Islam!\n\nDefendants only testify on their own behalf\n\nin the minority of cases, although\n\nthey absolutely have the right to.\n\nYou keep denying it, is that because you're scared\n\nto accept those consequences?\n\nThe prosecutor here is cross-examining the defendant\n\nand it's fairly true to life, to how it would happen.\n\nShe has killed her unborn child!\n\nWhere there is an outburst on the stand\n\nfrom a defendant or anyone else--\n\nShe poisons women! In all likelihood,\n\nthe judge would intervene and tell the witness\n\nto manage their temper.\n\n[Witness] And serves liquor in her home!\n\nAnd probably strike the outburst from the record.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nFor a classic witness outburst,\n\nlet's look at Legally Blonde.\n\nYou, however, had time to hide the gun,\n\ndidn't you, Chutney, after you shot your father?\n\nI didn't mean to shoot him!\n\nI thought it was you walking through the door!\n\n[all gasp]\n\nBoom, excellent cross-examination by Miss Woods.\n\nOh my god. She's asking\n\nleading questions. Didn't you, Chutney?\n\nAlthough her questions are appropriately leaning.\n\nWouldn't you have heard the gunshot?\n\nAnd if, in fact, you had heard the gunshot--\n\nThey're compound, she has a lot\n\nof questions in one question.\n\nYou, however, had time to hide the gun,\n\ndidn't you, Chutney, after you shot your father?\n\nIf I were the prosecutor, I would have objected\n\nto those compound questions.\n\nWouldn't somebody who's had say--\n\nRight here, she's talking directly\n\nto the jury, and that is not allowed.\n\nYou, however, had time to hide the gun.\n\nShe actually manages to break the witness.\n\nI didn't mean to shoot him! [all gasp]\n\nI've never seen that happen.\n\n[Elle] Yes! [triumphant music]\n\n[crowd cheering]\n\nThe classic witness outburst, A Few Good Men.\n\nColonel Jessup, did you order the code red?\n\nYou don't have to answer that question.\n\nI'll answer the question, you want answers?\n\nI think I'm entitled to them.\n\nYou want answers! I want the truth!\n\nYou can't handle the truth!\n\nThe rules in court-martial proceedings are different\n\nfrom the rules in a standard criminal courtroom\n\nbut it's unusual for a judge to allow an exchange\n\nbetween a lawyer and a witness to escalate to this level.\n\nI don't give a damn--\n\nIf a judge rules that a witness doesn't have\n\nto answer a question--\n\nYou don't have to answer that question.\n\nThe witness shouldn't answer the question.\n\nI'll answer the question. But I can't argue\n\nwith this, it's one of the great\n\ncourtroom scenes of all time.\n\nDid you order the code red? You're goddamn right I did!\n\nProtesting the verdict, The Practice.\n\nWe find the defendant, Edward Wicks, not guilty.\n\n[audience chattering] What?\n\n[gavel bangs] You call that service?\n\nMs. Gamble--\n\nWhat are you, morons?\n\nIt's hard for any lawyer\n\nto lose a case. That's it!\n\nBut this is above and beyond.\n\nWhat, do you like the color of Mr. Donnell's tie?\n\nMs. Gamble-- She should not have reacted\n\nthat way in front of the jury.\n\nSave it for when you get back to your office.\n\nA bunch of unemployed, brain-dead idiots.\n\nIn addition to possibly being held in contempt,\n\nshe could face ethical sanctions\n\nfrom the bar. Come on!\n\nOr potentially, lose her job.\n\nI don't care, judge, that's it!\n\nCalendar call, Roman J. Israel, Esq.\n\nWhat do you have on number 32, Langston Bailey?\n\nThis is a very realistic scene\n\nof a routine calendar call, when a judge has a lot\n\nof cases on that are all in a different posture.\n\nThe prosecutor's there with a banker's box,\n\nfull of case files, which is very common,\n\nand she's going to be reading from the materials\n\nwith respect to each one of those cases.\n\nFive years, that's as low as the people will go.\n\nHis name is Langston, he's a high school junior\n\nin good standing. Many defense lawyers\n\nwould use the kind of mitigating circumstances\n\nthat Mr. Israel sets out in trying\n\nto persuade a prosecutor to make a lower offer.\n\nHe has one prior minor offense.\n\nEach one of us is greater\n\nthan the worst thing we've ever done.\n\nI've never heard music in the background when they do it\n\nbut otherwise, it's very true-to-life.\n\nTake vows. Hollywood loves\n\nto take a moral stance in a situation\n\nlike this and so do defense lawyers.\n\nWhy don't we just get it over with then and shoot him?\n\nThat's the offer.\n\nIt's common for lawyers to negotiate a disposition\n\nduring downtime in court in situations like that.\n\nTalk to your client.\n\nAnd the only uncommon thing--\n\nMy conviction rate's 100%.\n\nIs the prosecutor referring to her conviction rate,\n\nwhich is just tacky. A fact.\n\nApproaching the bench, Philadelphia.\n\n[Man] Would you approach the bench, Mr. Miller?\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nA lawyer cannot approach the bench ex parte,\n\nwhich means without the other lawyer.\n\nEverybody in this courtroom is thinking\n\nabout sexual orientation.\n\nThis is great film, but this part is just not realistic.\n\nExplain this to me like I'm a two year-old.\n\nThe point of approaching the bench is so\n\nthat the rest of the courtroom doesn't hear you\n\nand you're speaking directly to the judge.\n\nLet's talk about what this case is really all about.\n\nSo this is inaccurate, first,\n\nthat the other lawyer isn't there,\n\nand second, that everyone in the courtroom can hear him.\n\nOur loathing, our fear. [dramatic music]\n\nAgain, with the poetic music.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nSome lawyers may hear it in their head\n\nwhen they're talking, but it's never happened to me.\n\n[audience applauds]\n\nExpert witness, My Cousin Vinny.\n\nThis witness is an expert in the field\n\nof automobiles and is being called\n\nto rebut the testimony of George Wilbur.\n\nAn expert witness, as compared to a fact witness--\n\nIn what way are you qualified?\n\nIs a witness who is permitted,\n\nbased on their expertise, to testify\n\nabout their opinion, rather than things\n\nthat are simply facts.\n\nI'd like to voir dire this witness\n\nas to the extent of her expertise.\n\nTo voir dire an expert witness\n\nabout their qualification to be certified\n\nas an expert, a lawyer would ask them questions\n\nabout their background.\n\nWhat would the correct ignition timing be\n\non a 1955 Bel Air Chevrolet?\n\nThey wouldn't pose a hypothetical,\n\nlike the lawyer does here.\n\nWith a 327 cubic-inch engine--\n\nTo approach the witness stand,\n\na lawyer has to ask the judge's permission first.\n\nThat's a [bleep] question.\n\nIt has to be for a good reason,\n\nlike to show them a piece of evidence\n\nor to have them point to something.\n\nDoes that mean that you can't answer it?\n\nThis prosecutor is getting a bit out of line.\n\nHe's getting in her face.\n\nNobody could answer that question!\n\nHe's speaking aggressively towards her.\n\nYou don't know the answer!\n\nAnd he asked her a hypothetical question.\n\nThe 327 didn't come out 'til '62\n\nand it wasn't offered in the Bel Air\n\nwith a four-barrel carb 'til '64.\n\nInstead of a question about her expertise,\n\nthat's inappropriate.\n\nWell, she's acceptable.\n\nCourtroom demonstration, To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nTom, will you catch this, please?\n\nYou can't use the body of someone\n\nwho is not on the stand as a demonstration in court.\n\nThis time, will you please catch it\n\nwith your left hand?\n\nI can't use my left hand at all.\n\nThat's not how the lawyer would make the point\n\nthat the defendant can't use his left hand.\n\nI got it caught in a cotton gin when I was 12 years-old.\n\nHe would have had to call the defendant\n\nto the stand to testify about it.\n\nGood lord. Or call a doctor\n\nor someone else who had firsthand experience\n\nabout the defendant's disability.\n\nAll my muscles were tore loose.\n\nWhen a witness is on the stand,\n\nyou're only supposed to be questioning that witness.\n\n[gavel bangs]\n\nNot the defendant or anyone else in the courtroom.\n\nI must be losing my memory.\n\nAtticus Finch is a hero amongst American lawyers\n\nbut he just doesn't get it quite right this time.\n\nYou sure?\n\nHostile witness, The Dark Knight.\n\nSomeone must have stepped up to run the so-called family.\n\nCould you identify him for us, please?\n\nIt was me.\n\nWhen your own witness unexpectedly contradicts your case--\n\nIt was me.\n\nThen you can ask for permission to treat them as hostile.\n\nPermission to treat the witness as hostile?\n\nThis is a pretty accurate depiction of a hostile witness.\n\nHostile, I'll show you hostile!\n\nUp until when he pulls the gun\n\nand that the lawyer punches him.\n\nCourthouses have metal detectors.\n\nYou can't bring guns into the courtroom,\n\nunless they're evidence.\n\nViolent witness, Primal Fear.\n\nHe put you in front of a camera,\n\nhe made you take off your clothes,\n\nand you don't think that that's another side?\n\nNo. Do you know\n\nwhat I would do if someone did that to me?\n\nI would kill him.\n\nThe moment she's making it about herself,\n\nI would have objected.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate. Lawyers aren't allowed\n\nto talk about themselves\n\nwhile they're cross-examining a witness.\n\nI would stab him 78 times with a butcher knife.\n\nI would have objected right there.\n\nI would chop off his fingers.\n\nThe judge would have interrupted her\n\nas soon as she started to hypothesize\n\nabout what she would do.\n\nI would slash his throat open.\n\nA judge would ask the court officers to intervene\n\nas soon as it looked like things were getting violent.\n\nI swear to God.\n\nThis is a terrifying movie\n\nand Laura Linney's character is way out of line.\n\nBut that's me. Sometimes,\n\nlawyers do try to agitate a witness,\n\nin order to get a reaction from them.\n\nNo further questions, your honor.\n\nWhere the hell do you think you're going?\n\nWhich seems to be what she's trying to do here\n\nand actually, she does.\n\n[Witness] [bleep] You, lady, come here!\n\nBailiff!\n\n[gavel bangs] Order, order!\n\nIt's rare for a witness or defendant\n\nto get violent, but it does happen\n\nand that's why there are armed court officers\n\nin every courtroom for criminal trials.\n\nNo, no, no! Don't you--\n\nCharacter witness, Big Daddy.\n\nKoufax is a good egg, he was nice to that kid.\n\nMr. Koufax is a really cool guy.\n\nBut he fights like a girl. [laughs]\n\nWhat, are you drunk, Mr. Herlihy?\n\nUnder the rules of evidence,\n\na character witness can only testify\n\nabout something that's at issue.\n\nWish my dad was as cool as him.\n\nSo where the issue is whether or not he's a good dad,\n\nthey could testify about his reputation\n\nas a good dad in the community,\n\nbut they can't testify in general about whether he's cool.\n\nMr. Koufax is a really cool guy.\n\nAnd they can't go off-topic.\n\nYou see, my dad was a military man.\n\nI'd rather live out on the streets\n\nthan under his freaky-ass rules.\n\nAnd also, the plaintiff should definitely\n\nnot be bribing the witness with McDonald's.\n\nIf OJ can get away with murder,\n\nwhy can't Sonny have his kid?\n\nJury selection, The Devil's Advocate.\n\nLet's get rid of number four, six,\n\nand I'd say lose number 12, except the prosecutor's\n\ngonna [bleep] up and do it for us.\n\nBoth sides have a set number\n\nof peremptory challenges they can use\n\nto strike potential jurors.\n\nNumber six, you're kidding, right?\n\nShe's my first choice.\n\nThey can both agree to strike anyone\n\nand that doesn't count against them\n\nand no one can strike a juror on the base\n\nof a protected category like race,\n\ngender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation,\n\nbut beyond that, it's no holds barred.\n\nShe wants on this jury, somebody hurt her\n\nand she wants revenge.\n\nLawyers definitely try to psychoanalyze potential jurors,\n\nbased on what they're wearing\n\nand the way they comport themselves.\n\nWe're often pretty wrong.\n\nHow the hell do you know that?\n\nIn my experience, most of the time,\n\npeople are trying to get out of jury duty,\n\nso I'm not sure how he thinks he can tell\n\nthat she wants to be on the jury.\n\nI don't know.\n\nPeople have all kinds of funny superstitions\n\nabout who they won't let on a jury.\n\nNone of this is based on science.\n\nIt's all basically guesswork and the bottom line is\n\nthat you want a jury who can be fair.\n\nAll right, here's the deal.\n\nI lose with your jury, you do the explaining.\n\nHere's another example of jury selection, The Rainmaker.\n\nDid you, Mr. Porter, or did you not\n\nhave a phone conversation a few days ago\n\nwith Mr. Rudy Baylor? Hell no.\n\nI thought you were gonna give me an honest answer.\n\nThis is an example of voir dire.\n\nThe lawyer's questioning the jury\n\nabout their ability to serve.\n\nDon't call me a liar. Well, you're a\n\nliar, all right. Mr. Tillman!\n\nYou son of a [bleep]!\n\nThere's an awful lot of jumping over the rail\n\nthat seems to happen in film and TV.\n\nOrder, stop it! [glass shatters]\n\nI've never seen it happen in real life.\n\nOrder in the court room! Oh my god!\n\nWhen something happens that can taint the whole jury pool,\n\noften a lawyer will make an application\n\nto have the whole pool dismissed\n\nand a new pool brought in.\n\nI move to dismiss the entire panel, your honor.\n\nHere, the judge probably\n\nwould have granted that application.\n\nDenied. Film and TV love\n\nto show jury selection. It's been tainted!\n\nFrankly, most lawyers hate it.\n\nHis shoe, you left it over there.\n\nThe judge saying out of order, from Justice For All.\n\nSomething really wrong is going on here.\n\nMr. Kirkland, you are out of order!\n\nA judge would typically call for order in the court\n\nin a situation like that. You're out of order!\n\nBut generally, much earlier.\n\n[Arthur] The whole trial is out of order!\n\nThe kind of language that he uses\n\nis totally inappropriate.\n\n[bleep] jail!\n\nAnd then he turns on his own client.\n\nSlime! The lawyer is undermining\n\nhis ethical obligation. Sorry, your honor.\n\nHollywood loves to show emotional outbursts from lawyers.\n\nYou son of a [bleep]!\n\nThose are pretty uncommon,\n\nwe do our best to control them.\n\nWe're gonna be seeing a lot of them today, though.\n\n[Arthur] I just completed my opening statement.\n\nRemoving the witness, from Daredevil.\n\nI know what I did, I know who I am.\n\nAny scumbag, any lowlife, any maggot piece\n\nof [bleep] that I put down--\n\nThe judge would reprimand any lawyer\n\nor witness who used bad language in the court room.\n\nI did it because I liked it! Order.\n\nMost lawyers would work closely\n\nwith the defendant before he took the stand.\n\nHell, I loved it!\n\nIn order to guard against\n\nthose kind of emotional outbursts.\n\nThe big, bad punisher.\n\n[Frank] Well, here I am!\n\nRemove the witness.\n\nCourt officers are trained to respond\n\nto a judge's orders immediately.\n\nYou want it, I'll give it to you.\n\nHere, the court officers do take him out\n\nas soon as the judge instructs them to.\n\nRemove the witness.\n\nMost judges would respond more quickly\n\nto have that defendant removed from the court room.\n\nYou're gonna send me to a nut house?\n\nThat kind of scene is fairly uncommon.\n\nWell that ain't happening!\n\nSettlement, A Civil Action.\n\nAre you comfortable?\n\nThey're right there.\n\nThe jury's been impaneled\n\nand opening statements are about to begin\n\nbut the lawyer sees the effect that seeing the plaintiff\n\nis having on one of the jurors\n\nand so that leads him to negotiate.\n\nIt's very common that plea negotiations\n\nwould continue through a trial like this.\n\nPlea negotiations have to happen outside the awareness\n\nof the jury, so if the jury were in the box like this\n\nand the parties were trying to negotiate,\n\nPost-its is exactly how they would do it.\n\n[Jan] Jan Schlichtmann for Paul Carney.\n\n[Kevin] Kevin Conway for Mr. Carney, your honor.\n\nI'd start sweating too if I saw a juror respond like this.\n\nIt is far more likely for both criminal\n\nand civil cases to be resolved with a plea\n\nor settlement disposition.\n\nThe parties involved have agreed to a settlement.\n\nAnd going through to the conclusion of a trial.\n\nCourtroom attire, The Simpsons.\n\nI rest my case.\n\nThe phrase, I rest my case, is a commonly used one.\n\nMr. Hutz-- But--\n\nDo you know you're not wearing any pants?\n\nWe usually wear pants to work.\n\n[Lionel yelps]\n\nThe formality of courtroom attire has decreased\n\nin recent years. Right.\n\nBut not quite to that level.\n\nThat's why you're the judge\n\nand I'm the law-talking guy. The lawyer.\n\nWitness stripping, Franklin & Bash.\n\n[Man] And how exactly did you book\n\nthe Mattress Masters ad?\n\nMy agent. Objection, your honor.\n\nShe's disrobing.\n\nTo my knowledge, there's nothing\n\nin the rules of evidence that says a witness\n\ncan't take their clothes off.\n\nThe client wanted a model who could demand attention.\n\nYour honor-- But it's against all rules\n\nof courtroom decorum.\n\nMiss Spencer-- Lawyers advise witnesses\n\nto behave respectfully towards the court,\n\nincluding dressing appropriately for court.\n\nPlease refrain from taking off your blouse.\n\nAnd not undressing in court.\n\nDon't listen to him.\n\nOf all the unrealistic things in this scene--\n\nExcuse me. The most unrealistic\n\nis when the lawyer tells the witness to ignore that.\n\nDid you just tell the witness\n\nto disregard my order?\n\nThat should never happen.\n\nIf justice is blind-- This is so dumb.\n\nThen justice is also naked. Miss Spencer.\n\nLet's focus on what she had to say.\n\nI didn't get in.\n\nThere's a request for read back again.\n\n[Woman] I was distracted.\n\nBut this stenographer\n\nreally dropped the ball on her job.\n\nIf we were all distracted by Miss Spencer\n\nin court, what about the people operating heavy machinery\n\non Sunset Boulevard?\n\nThis is made for TV alone.\n\nFilm and TV love this, where something happens\n\nin the courtroom and then the lawyer uses it\n\nto prove their case.\n\nDistracted. That's not a real thing.\n\nOnly things that are in evidence get to be used\n\nto further an argument.\n\n[scoffs] Like that ever scares us.\n\nApplause in the gallery, Changeling.\n\nWalter Collins was brutally murdered.\n\nIs that correct, Captain?\n\nWhen a lawyer is questioning about something\n\nas dramatic as that, everyone in the courtroom\n\ncan feel the tenseness of the situation.\n\nYes, it is. The lawyers,\n\nthe jury, the audience, everyone.\n\nNo further questions.\n\n[audience applauds]\n\nIn modern day, applause is not allowed\n\nin the courtroom, but before we had courtroom scenes\n\non television and film, people would go to court\n\nto watch proceedings as part of their entertainment,\n\nand during that time, sometimes, there would be applause\n\nin the courtroom.\n\n[snaps fingers] Just like that.\n\n[audience applauds]\n\nContempt of court, Serial Mom.\n\nOne beer with lunch is hardly drinking.\n\nDid you see that?\n\nShe just said [bleep] you to me!\n\nThe lawyer's antagonizing the witness,\n\nso if the judge saw that, she would have been reprimanded.\n\nLet the record show I am merely standing here.\n\nAgain, it's all about the record.\n\nSo if the stenographer didn't hear it,\n\nit's like it didn't happen.\n\nAre you insane? No, I'm not, you [bleep]!\n\n[audience gasps]\n\nIn Hollywood, courtroom scenes are so emotional.\n\n[Judge] Mrs. Hinkle, I find you guilty of contempt.\n\nThe judges are threatening to hold people\n\nin contempt all the time.\n\nYou lousy [bleep].\n\nIn reality, I think I've probably\n\nonly seen it happen once or twice.\n\nMidnight deadline, Night Court.\n\nUnfortunately, word got out that anyone\n\nnot arraigned before midnight was set free.\n\nWow, look at her hair.\n\nOh, we were so close.\n\nOh, well that's it, we're finished.\n\nNo we're not, hold on.\n\nNight court arraignments really happen\n\nin New York City and all over the country.\n\nCount one, the undersigned declaring complaint states\n\nwithout prejudice to the-- They tend to be\n\nvery busy and fast-paced, but not this fast-paced.\n\n[rapidly speaking gibberish]\n\nArraignment is the first time that someone\n\nwho's charged with a crime hears the charges\n\nread formally against them.\n\nNew York state and New York, is code for violation 231--\n\nSometimes it happens in night court.\n\nDrive the vehicle. [gasps]\n\nCount two-- When someone gets arraigned,\n\ntheir lawyer says waive the reading, not the rights.\n\nAnd what happened in that case,\n\nthe defendant didn't wanna waive the reading,\n\nso that's why he was forced to read them all aloud.\n\nDrive a vehicle, the end.\n\nCourt adjourned!\n\nWe did it! [all cheer]\n\nThe defendant representing himself, Law Abiding Citizen.\n\nAnd you've waived your right to counsel, correct?\n\nYes, sir. You sure you wanna do that?\n\nYes sir.\n\nThe defendant has an absolute right\n\nto represent himself in court.\n\nUsually, a defendant is assigned a back-up counsel,\n\nwho actually has legal training.\n\nI find it highly prejudicial\n\nto keep me detained without bail.\n\nWhen a defendant is representing himself,\n\nhe's granted more leeway than a lawyer is,\n\nin terms of editorializing about\n\nwhat he thinks is happening in the courtroom.\n\nThe prosecution has not presented one,\n\nsingle piece of evidence against me.\n\nHe's advocating for himself and he's entitled to do that.\n\nIt's a slippery slope, your honor.\n\nIt's not inappropriate and I think it's fairly realistic.\n\nI am actually inclined to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.\n\n[clapping] Thank you.\n\nIndicting a dog from Perry Mason.\n\n[Man] Present or not, a man is still responsible\n\nfor what his dog does.\n\nNot criminally, Mr. Wright, that depends\n\nupon a number of things.\n\nPerhaps the proper criminal procedure\n\nwould have been an indictment of the dog.\n\n[Man] Counsel is joking, of course.\n\nNot at all.\n\nHere, the argument is about\n\nwhether the person can be charged\n\nfor something that an animal did.\n\n[Man] A variety of animals have been accused,\n\nlegally indicted, and tried in the past.\n\nIn the modern day, animals can't be indicted and charged.\n\nThe last being a cow in 1740.\n\nHowever, animals can be considered dangerous instruments\n\nfor the purposes of a person committing an assault.\n\nSince this is the 20th and not the 15th century,\n\nI'm going to rule that the complaint is sufficient.\n\nSetting bail, 50 Shades Freed.\n\nDoes your client deny forcing entry\n\ninto this penthouse?\n\nHe does not, your honor, however,\n\nmy client merely wanted to confront the parties responsible\n\nfor destroying his career.\n\nI think he wanted to do more\n\nthan confront them, counselor.\n\nHowever, given his clean record, the court will grant bail.\n\nThe basic options when a judge is making a decision\n\nabout bail are releasing someone\n\non their own recognizance, which means counting\n\non them to return on their own free will,\n\nsetting bail, which means determining an amount\n\nof collateral that they will give over\n\nand that is likely to ensure that they return\n\nand remanding them, which means\n\nthat no amount of money or collateral will allow them\n\nto be released while the charges are pending.\n\n[Judge] Set at $500,000.\n\n$500,000 bail is not unheard of,\n\ndepending on the gravity of the charges,\n\nthe defendant's criminal history,\n\ntheir community ties, and their access.\n\nYour honor-- [gavel bangs]\n\nNext case.\n\nVery often, it has the result\n\nof meaning that someone can't make the bail\n\nand therefore, stays in custody.\n\nReadback, Intolerable Cruelty.\n\nDoes Elsbieta want some bones?\n\nWhere were we?\n\nDo you want some bones, does Elsbieta want some bones?\n\nThis is called readback, where a lawyer doesn't hear\n\nor loses track of what the response has been,\n\nthey can ask the stenographer--\n\nWhere were we? To readback\n\nfrom the transcription. Has anyone any bones?\n\nReadback can happen during the trial,\n\nfor a lawyer, or a jury can ask\n\nfor readback during their deliberations\n\nif there's something they don't remember.\n\nHard, crunchy bones. Right.\n\nWhat's not accurate is that a dog\n\nwould be in the courtroom, on the stand\n\nwith a witness, [dog barks]\n\nunless it was a therapy dog.\n\nShush, shush, shush, shush.\n\nSurprise witness, The Good Fight.\n\nThank you for testifying\n\non such short notice, Ms. Lockhart.\n\nI didn't have much choice, I was subpoenaed.\n\nYour honor, again, this is prosecution by ambush.\n\nWe are not prepared for this surprise witness.\n\nThat's just how that would happen.\n\nThe prosecution has to disclose their witnesses\n\nin advance of trial to permit the defense\n\nto appropriately prepare.\n\nYes, and as I said, you will have time\n\nif you need it, please continue.\n\nWhen something changes and a new witness comes to light,\n\nthe prosecutor might be permitted\n\nto call that witness but, as the judge promises here,\n\nthe defense would then be granted plenty of time\n\nto be able to prepare to cross-examine that new witness.\n\nYes, and quite well.\n\nMiranda rights, Madea Goes to Jail.\n\nApparently, your honor, our officers forgot\n\nto Mirandize her.\n\nI was waiting for Miranda to come in\n\nand nobody came in there, I was waiting for it.\n\nThat's right, ain't nobody Miranda me,\n\nMiranda wasn't even in the room.\n\nUgh, no. Excuse me?\n\nMiranda is the case that holds\n\nthat officers have to read a defendant their rights\n\nbefore questioning them.\n\nThis is ridiculous.\n\nWhat they're referring to here is\n\nthat Madea made a statement to police officers\n\nand she did it without having been\n\nfirst read her Miranda warnings.\n\nYou forgot to Mirandize her?\n\nThat old woman got the strength of any man.\n\nWhen that happens, the statement that's made\n\ngets suppressed as evidence, which means\n\nit can't be used against the defendant.\n\nI've got to let you go.\n\nBut it's not the case that the defendant\n\nthen just gets let go.\n\n♪ You gotta let me go ♪\n\n[Madea laughs]\n\nConference in the judge's chambers, The Verdict.\n\nAll I wanted on this trial was a fair shake, okay.\n\nPushed me to court five days early,\n\nI lose my star witness, and I can't get a continuance\n\nand I don't care, I'm going up there,\n\nI'm gonna try it, I'm gonna let the jury decide.\n\nIt's a TV and film trope that judges\n\nand lawyers are combative with each other.\n\nThey told me about you.\n\nIn general, we're all professionals\n\nand we try to maintain standards\n\nof professionalism and decorum.\n\nThey think you're a hard-ass,\n\nyou're a defendant's judge-- Well, I don't care.\n\nSeems like bad strategy\n\nto be leveling personal accusations at the judge\n\nwhile he has a case pending in front of him.\n\nI said to hell with it, to hell with it.\n\nDismissing a case, Miracle on 34th Street.\n\nIf the government of the United States\n\ncan issue its currency bearing a declaration\n\nof trust in God, then the state of New York can accept\n\nand acknowledge that Santa Claus does exist\n\nand he exists in the person of Kris Kringle.\n\nDon't tell my kids, but I don't think the existence\n\nof Santa Claus would stand up in court.\n\nCase dismissed.\n\nAgain with the gavel.\n\nThis is in New York, and I haven't seen a judge\n\nin this courthouse do that.\n\nSummation, or closing statement, The Night Of.\n\nWhat I normally do is plea my clients out\n\nbecause 95% of the time, they did\n\nwhat they were charged with.\n\nObjection. It's clear to me,\n\njust looking at them, so I tell 'em,\n\ndon't be stupid, take the deal.\n\nSummations can only be about the facts\n\nthat are in evidence.\n\nIt's what we think.\n\nAnything about the lawyer's personal contact\n\nwith the defendant, with the witnesses,\n\nor their experience in general\n\nis totally outside the bounds of appropriate summation.\n\nThe first time I saw Naz, he was sitting alone\n\nin a holding cell at the 21st Precinct.\n\nObjection, also not in evidence.\n\nI didn't see what I see in my other clients.\n\nJohn Turturro, this is not about you.\n\nWhat we don't have proof of is\n\nwho committed the crime he's been charged with.\n\nThat last part of the summation,\n\nwhere he's talking about the facts\n\nthat are in evidence--\n\nIt's circumstance and speculation.\n\nThat is the purpose of summation.\n\nYou hear that term a lot, what does it really mean?\n\nFor another example of summation,\n\nlet's watch A Time to Kill.\n\nMay I ask you all to close your eyes?\n\nThis is a story about a little girl.\n\nI want you to picture this little girl.\n\nTwo men jump out and grab her and drag her\n\ninto a nearby field, raping her.\n\nThis is really the appropriate time\n\nfor a lawyer to get theatrical, on summation.\n\nAnd that's exactly what he does here.\n\nI want you to picture a little girl.\n\nHe lays out his view of the facts of the case\n\nand then makes a powerful argument about bias.\n\nNow imagine she's white.\n\nThis is exactly the appropriate use of a summation,\n\nalthough it's awfully hard to watch.\n\nThe defense rests, your honor.\n\nConclusion. At the end of the day,\n\nI don't expect actors and directors\n\nto get every detail right.\n\nI understand that writers like\n\nto make courtroom scenes seem more dramatic\n\nthan they really are, but sometimes, they get it wrong\n\nand they're pretty fun to watch.\n\n[Man] That'll do it.\n\n[crew applauding]"
