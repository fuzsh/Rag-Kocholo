        "text": "Baaraan Ijlal’s spectacular paintings linger in your memory long after you’ve stopped looking at them. It’s fitting for how she plays with time, rendering history within the present moment—already disappearing. It’s easy to be stunned by the intricate beauty that each vast canvas in her series, Hostile Witness, offers—muted but rich blues and browns darkening into black, imposing facades of crumbling buildings packed with people and fantastical creatures. Rising seas lap at the paintings and look in the water, there’s a floating man with a violin. Elsewhere, a gun-headed business suit representing Jaabir—the destroyer of worlds, would-be coloniser of space—menaces a family on a scooter. To counter him, Zaagh-e-Zaman, the crow-woman, is everywhere if you’re paying attention to the margins.\n\nThis show is the culmination of nearly a decade’s work where Ijlal walked around recording sounds, photographing and painting fragile portions of a few cities including Bhopal (her ancestral home), Calcutta, Bombay, Lucknow, Benares. She still marvels at the first time a woman let a stranger like her into the house and talked for hours. “Sometimes, the women would tell me things like put me in this salwar-kurta with pink flowers. So then I would,” she laughs.\n\nChange Room, a sound installation of audio testimonials hosted at Ahmedabad’s Conflictorium in 2018, arose from this larger project. Here too, the identities of people have been anonymised. They find expression in couplets integrated within the paintings and poetic excerpts from Ijlal’s archival diaries of the encounters that accompany each painting.\n\nSometimes, the artist would revisit a site to find it was gone—along with its people. The locations were fragile structures that felt important to record before they disappeared. “We all know a site will evolve and a new structure will come up which will also meet the same fate. That is the nature of our cities and bodies,” she says. It was crucial to pause and centre those considered marginal, especially women who compound erasure by “self-erasing” and non-human animals in her narratives as well.\n\nShe speaks of recording with the Van Gujjars of Uttarakhand and their attunement to their buffaloes, migrating to higher climes as needed, “At 4 am, I woke up to the sound of deer who had come to find their new settlement because they dig holes and provide them with water. We’re not even looking at the people who live sustainably, instead, we’re ousting them.” Such harmony, which is wilfully trampled on, and the power dynamic between the artist and those gazed upon, inform her lens.\n\n“You see the water rising in every painting,” Ijlal says. “It’s taken centuries of not witnessing, of erasing such accounts for the seas to rise. And now here we are. It almost feels like wrap-up time for the planet. There won’t be any hostile witnesses because witnesses won’t survive,” she poignantly reflects.\n\nWho is listening?\n\nFor the show, Ijlal partnered with her historian-artist brother, Moonis. Together, they devised a fantastical vocabulary that could adequately describe bizarre events unfolding on earth. So contrived creations like Jehel (of silence) and Peshrau (species fighting erasure) are interwoven with oral histories and real cities. “We’re so ambitious that a war for outer space is unfolding among the privileged few who want to live in a bubble while things fall apart here. Their dream is a nightmare for 90 percent of humanity and other species,” says Moonis. “Typical coloniser behaviour,” interjects Ijlal. Moonis’s sculptures in wood form the connecting tissue of the show and the frames of the paintings that replicate the architecture of the buildings.\n\n“We’ve grown up seeing the Narmada Bachao Andolan across our house where thousands would come and put up tents, but the question is, who is listening?” asks Ijlal. For the siblings, the most uncommon narratives are those of the privileged, where there is “no chatter, where you don’t talk or listen to other people, and only use life as a consumer,” as Moonis puts it.\n\nThe sheer volume of intricacies in all the paintings, the poems, the diary archives and the vocabulary that greet you at the entrance—there’s a desperation here to tell all the stories. To transmit them to a witness who will pass on the story through a tin-telephone or a childhood game of Chinese whispers. Anything so that they aren’t lost. “There’s something about these worlds that evoke the strangeness of childhood fairy tales”, I tell Ijlal when we meet. Not those with neat Cinderella endings, but the grislier, more peculiar ones where women turn into cranes and people befriend mountain bears.\n\nAnd yet, to merely marvel is to miss the point. “I’m tired of people congratulating me on the aesthetic beauty,” she says. We speak in front of a giant canvas of the Iqbal Maidan in Bhopal. “What do you want people to take away from this?” I ask.\n\n“I want them to notice the women carrying scissors, the mourners evoking the Gas tragedy. That over there, the women under the trees are sharing an oxygen cylinder,” Ijlal points. She wants you to look up the real histories of the place, perhaps even defeat Jehel—resist erasure and silence. Let there be chatter.\n\nHostile Witness is on display at New Delhi’s Bikaner House until 5 December.\n\nAlso read:\n\nEnter the world of Petra Collins and Alexa Demie’s eerie, erotic Fairy Tales\n\nTwo artists celebrate the uniqueness of womanhood through their art\n\n“I don't work with happy coincidences”: Photographer Rohit Chawla's ‘The Design Eye’ exhibit opens in Delhi today"
