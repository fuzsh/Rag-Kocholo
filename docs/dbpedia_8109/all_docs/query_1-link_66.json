Let go!\n\nI have never seen it happen that,\n\nin the course of a trial, a lawyer moves\n\nin front of everyone in the courtroom\n\nto have someone on the stand arrested for new crimes.\n\nSometimes, you have to make a wrong turn\n\nbefore you find your way.\n\n[soft dramatic music]\n\nHostile witness, Law & Order: SVU.\n\nI don't wanna do this.\n\nPermission to treat the witness as hostile, Your Honor.\n\nPermission granted, proceed.\n\nYou must answer the questions, Miss Harper.\n\nWhen a lawyer's own witness isn't responding\n\nto questions, the judge can grant that lawyer permission\n\nto treat the witness as hostile.\n\nThat means the lawyer has been given permission\n\nto ask leading questions of the witness\n\nas you would on cross examination.\n\nYou heard the defendant's voice in your house.\n\nYou said you heard his voice in your house.\n\nThat's why you're hesitant to identify him now\n\nbecause if were wrong then, you might be wrong again now.\n\nLeading questions, though, have to be\n\nin the form of a question.\n\nIf Sean was there, then that would mean that--\n\nThat means he killed her.\n\nIs that what you were about to say?\n\nObjection! Let me rephrase.\n\nSo this lawyer,\n\nwho's repeatedly making speculative statements,\n\nThat means he killed her.\n\nIs that what you were about to say?\n\nis entitled to make those kind of inquiries,\n\nbut they have to be done in the form of a question.\n\nIs there a question anywhere here?\n\nSuch as isn't it right that if he killed her,\n\nthen you killed her, question mark.\n\n[soft dramatic music]\n\nRole reversal, Ghostbusters II.\n\nSo you were just trying to help\n\nHelp out a friend. out a friend.\n\nWho was frightened. Who was a-scared of what\n\nObjection. was happening to her\n\nwhen you scared, what? [muffled speaking]\n\nObjection.\n\nThere was no evil intended. There was no evil intended,\n\nno-- Objection.\n\nWhat is the witness doing here?\n\nThe lawyer should always be the one asking the questions.\n\nWhere the person on the stand is feeding the questions\n\nor commentary to the witness,\n\nthe opposing counsel should definitely object,\n\nObjection, Your Honor.\n\nand the objection should be sustained.\n\nSustained!\n\n[soft dramatic music] Witness preparation,\n\nSeinfeld.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 10th,\n\nyou received a phone call, did you not?\n\nPhone call?\n\n[audience laughs]\n\nYes, a phone call!\n\nFrom who?\n\n[audience laughing]\n\nFrom me.\n\nFrom you?\n\nYes, from me, from me!\n\nI called you, remember?\n\nLawyers are permitted to prepare their witnesses\n\nbefore a trial, and, in fact, it's a best practice\n\nto give your witness adequate preparation.\n\nWhat's the matter with you, you jerk?\n\nWe had it all worked out! [Kramer cries out]\n\nIt's endlessly surprising to me, though,\n\nthat no matter how many times you prepare a witness,\n\nthere's no accounting for what someone remembers\n\nor says in the moment.\n\nWhat was the question?\n\nThat said, I think that Newman's reaction\n\nis a little bit over the top.\n\nYour Honor, Mr. Kramer's obviously very distraught.\n\nI'm distraught?\n\nYou shut up! Ooh ooh ooh ooh!\n\n[soft dramatic music] Admissions\n\non the stand from MADtv.\n\nThe defendant is a flight risk, Your Honor.\n\nIf I was a flight risk, I wouldn't even be here.\n\nI could be in another country this afternoon\n\nif I wanted to.\n\nI got friends who can create false passports.\n\nThis is-- One of the reasons\n\nthat people who are charged with crimes are discouraged\n\nfrom speaking in court is because anything they say\n\non the record can be used against them.\n\nCareful, Mr. Henry.\n\nRight now, you're only being charged with armed robbery.\n\nEven if it is an acknowledgement\n\nof other uncharged crimes.\n\nI don't need the money, I'm a drug dealer!\n\nLike here. [laughs]\n\n[soft dramatic music] Motion to dismiss,\n\nErin Brockovich.\n\nAnd I have here 84 motions to strike.\n\nIn both civil and criminal matters,\n\nthe parties have an opportunity\n\nto file a motion to dismiss on the grounds\n\nthat the complaint itself is legally inadequate.\n\nIt is the order of this court that each\n\nof the 84 motions to strike and demurs are denied.\n\nOnce a motion to dismiss has been denied,\n\nnegotiations often start in earnest.\n\n$20 million dollars is more money\n\nthan these people have ever dreamed of.\n\nOh, see, now that [beep] me off.\n\nFirst of all, since the demur,\n\nwe have more than 400 plaintiffs.\n\nAnd let's be honest, we all know there are more out there.\n\n$20 million isn't [beep] when you split it between them.\n\nErin.\n\nBefore you come back here with another lame ass offer,\n\nI want you to think real hard about\n\nwhat your spine is worth, Mr. Walker,\n\nor what you might expect someone\n\nto pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez.\n\nThe majority of civil cases don't go to trial.\n\nOften, they are resolved after negotiations with the plea\n\nso that everyone can cut their losses and go home\n\nrather than risk the very high stakes\n\nof a trial and, ultimately, a much greater settlement.\n\nTake out your calculator,\n\nand you multiply that number by 100.\n\nAnything less than that is a waste of our time.\n\n[soft dramatic music] Throwing the book\n\nat someone from Crime Story.\n\nThey probably planted it investigating Tagley's link\n\nto the KGB.\n\nKGB?\n\nWell, it's strictly speculation,\n\nbut word on is that Tagley\n\nis selling nuclear secrets to the Russians.\n\nI don't know how true it is, but--\n\nYour Honor, the man's a liar!\n\nThat is a complete lie!\n\n[book thuds]\n\n[book thuds]\n\nYour Honor, do I have to suffer these indignities\n\nright here in the halls of justice?\n\nThe actor playing the lawyer is actually my dad.\n\n[ding]\n\nWe still got a trial, remember?\n\nA lawyer is permitted to refer to a witness lying\n\nbut not to call a witness a liar.\n\nYour Honor, the man's a liar!\n\nIf a lawyer were to actually throw a book\n\nor anything else at a witness,\n\nThat is a complete lie! [book thuds twice]\n\nthey would likely be held in contempt.\n\nAnd if a witness were to throw anything back\n\nat the lawyer or anyone else in the courtroom,\n\nproceedings would likely stop.\n\n[gavel bangs] Court adjourned.\n\n[Witness] Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n[soft dramatic music] Mandatory sentencing,\n\nFor the People.\n\nThis is happening all over the country,\n\nlow-level, nonviolent crimes\n\nthat trigger disproportionate mandatory minimum sentences,\n\n[slow sad piano music]\n\nand I'm part of the problem.\n\nWhat is unusual is that the judge,\n\nwhile he's pronouncing the sentence,\n\nis speaking out in opposition to it.\n\n[Nicholas] My hands are reluctantly\n\nand unwillingly tied in this situation.\n\nThis judge in For the People\n\nis reflecting a sentiment that is increasingly part\n\nof the criminal justice reform movement in this country,\n\nwhich is that mandatory minimum sentencing\n\nis an outdated approach to crime.\n\nI have no choice but to sentence you,\n\nMr. Punte, to 10 years in federal prison.\n\n[soft dramatic music] Reasonable doubt,\n\nThe Practice.\n\nYou know that 90-something percent\n\nof all defendants are guilty?\n\nThink about it.\n\nBy the time they get the trial,\n\nthey've been judged guilty many times.\n\nA lawyer is not permitted to offer statistics\n\nthat are not in evidence.\n\nClosing statements are reserved\n\nfor the facts in evidence and the law.\n\nI think he's guilty!\n\nBut in this country, we don't take away a man's freedom\n\non the possibility of guilt.\n\nYou have to find guilt beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\nWhile the lawyer is right, that if the jury has any doubt,\n\nthey must acquit because his client is presumed innocent,\n\nit is bad practice for him to bring in his own perspective\n\non his client's guilt or innocence.\n\nI'm sure as hell not supposed to say that,\n\nbut I think he did it!\n\n[soft dramatic music] Courtroom conduct,\n\nKramer Vs. Kramer.\n\nWe were married a year before the baby\n\nand then seven years after that.\n\nSo you were a failure\n\nat the one most important relationship in your life.\n\nObjection. Overruled.\n\nThe witness's opinion on this is relevant.\n\nIt might be appropriate to ask a witness whether,\n\nin their own view, something had been a failure.\n\nI was not a failure.\n\nOh?\n\nWhat do you call it then, a success?\n\nThe marriage ended in divorce.\n\nI think that this rather nasty line of inquiry is unfair.\n\nThe question about a relationship being a failure\n\nis a subjective one.\n\nWere you a failure--\n\nAnd it's not clear exactly why her view\n\nof who failed is what matters here.\n\nI consider less my failure than his.\n\nProbably the line of inquiry\n\nwould have been stopped earlier when it became clear\n\nthat there was a difference of opinion about\n\nwhat it meant for the relationship to have been a failure.\n\n[John] Were you!\n\nHer ex-husband in the courtroom trying\n\nto convey something subtly to her might sway her answer,\n\nand a judge, if they noticed it,\n\nmight respond by stopping their subtle communication.\n\n[soft dramatic music] Custody hearings,\n\nBig Little Lies.\n\nI just want you to know how sorry I am\n\nthat it's come to this.\n\nThere's nothing preventing opposing parties\n\nfrom speaking to each other off the record\n\nduring a custody hearing.\n\nBut at the end of the day, we are still family.\n\nOf course, they should bear in mind\n\nthat things that are said can be used\n\nby one party against the other.\n\nThis is awfully different from when we last saw Meryl Streep\n\nin a custody hearing in Kramer Vs. Kramer,\n\nprobably 30 years go.\n\nAnd probably in that case, too,\n\nshe was communicating with someone off the record.\n\nWe're not family, Mary Louise.\n\n[soft dramatic music] Irrelevant evidence,\n\nSouth Park.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is Chewbacca.\n\nChewbacca is a wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk.\n\nHe's using the Chewbacca defense.\n\nWhy would a wookiee, an eight-foot-tall wookiee,\n\nwant to live on Endor with a bunch\n\nof two-foot-tall Ewoks?\n\nThat does not make sense!\n\nBut more importantly, you have to ask yourself,\n\nwhat does this have to do with this case?\n\nNothing.\n\nObjection on the ground of relevance.\n\nThe evidence about Chewbacca here\n\nis entirely irrelevant.\n\nIf Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit!\n\nAll evidence that is admitted at trial must be relevant.\n\nLook at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company,\n\nand I'm talking about Chewbacca.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nIf, at the time it's offered, it is not yet relevant,\n\nit can be admitted subject to connection.\n\nAnd if Chewbacca, for some reason later in the trial,\n\nbecame relevant,\n\nWhy am I talking about Chewbacca\n\nwhen a man's life is on the line?\n\nit could, at that time, be introduced,\n\neven though he had already displayed it\n\nand offered it subject to later connection.\n\nThe defense rests.\n\nOkay then.\n\nWow, he's good.\n\n[soft dramatic music] Representing yourself,\n\nFracture. Mr. Crawford,\n\nyou have been charged with Section 664/187\n\nof the California penal code, attempted murder.\n\nDo you wish to enter a plea at this time?\n\nIt's not guilty, but I also want\n\nto waive my right to counsel and represent myself.\n\nIn order for someone to be permitted\n\nto represent themself, they'll be questioned\n\nabout whether or not they're doing so knowingly.\n\nYou aware that lack of counsel\n\nwill not be grounds for an appeal.\n\nOh, I understand.\n\nWhether they understand the extent\n\nto which they're giving up the expertise of an attorney.\n\nYour Honor, if I could have a moment with my client.\n\nI'm not client, try and keep up, will you?\n\nAnd generally speaking,\n\nthey will be assigned backup counsel\n\nto assist and answer questions\n\nas they proceed with their own defense.\n\nMr. Crawford, you wanna reconsider?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nIt's gonna turn into a circus.\n\nI appreciate your concern with the dignity\n\nof the court, 007.\n\nIt could be argued that the courtroom\n\nis one of the last bastions of formality\n\nin modern American life, but even there,\n\na coat and tails is a little bit too much.\n\nHowever, I was surprised\n\nto hear the judge refer to the DA as 007.\n\n007.\n\nUsually, that kind of joking commentary\n\nis reserved for off the record.\n\n[Judge] District attorney's office\n\nwill assign another prosecutor.\n\nNo, I like Mr. Beachum.\n\nWhile the defendant here has an absolute right\n\nto represent himself, he doesn't have the right\n\nto choose who the prosecutor is on his case.\n\nHe likes you.\n\n[people chuckle quietly and murmur]\n\n[soft dramatic music] Personal digs, Boston Legal.\n\nWhat better to satiate some pre-election hunger pangs\n\nthan a belly full of media attention?\n\nMr. District Attorney, my name appears second\n\non the ballad this November.\n\nGinsberg knows that.\n\nThat's why he's handling this case personally.\n\nOuch.\n\nClosing statements are reserved\n\nfor the facts and the law.\n\nOutside politics have no place\n\nin either party's closing statements.\n\nHe was starving.\n\n[slow dramatic tense music]\n\nWhen was the last time you starved?\n\nHow 'bout you?\n\nI know you're not starving except for attention.\n\nAll of this lawyer's inquiry about collateral issues,\n\nlike whether the jurors themselves\n\nhave starved and what the status\n\nof the district attorney's future election is\n\nare entirely impermissible in court,\n\nand the opposing counsel should have been\n\non his feet, objecting, and the judge should\n\nhave been sustaining all those objections.\n\nIt makes for great TV, but it's not realistic.\n\n[soft dramatic music] Tampering with the evidence,\n\nChicago. Miss Kelly,\n\ndo you know the meaning of the word perjury?\n\nYes, I do.\n\n[Billy] You also know that it's a crime?\n\n[Velma] Yes.\n\nAs it turns out that you knew\n\nthat this diary was a fake.\n\nI hate to think of you rotting away\n\nin prison for the next 10 years.\n\nAll I know is what I was told.\n\nThe lawyer is trying to accuse the other lawyer\n\nof having tampered with the evidence.\n\nAre you not suggesting that I tampered\n\nwith evidence, are you?\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, utterly absurd.\n\n[fast-tempo jazz drums and tap dancing]\n\nBut now that you mention it, you obviously had a sample\n\nof my client's handwriting.\n\nMr. Harrison, didn't you ask Roxy\n\nto write out a confession for you?\n\nYour Honor, this is outrageous!\n\nIt's outrageous!\n\nSave it for summation, Richard Gere.\n\nThe appropriate way to do that\n\nwould be for him to elicit the relevant facts\n\nfrom witnesses on the stand.\n\nAny idea who this mysterious benefactor might be?\n\nNo.\n\nIntroduce the relevant material evidence\n\ninto evidence and then, on summation,\n\nexplain his theory to the jury,\n\nnot to do it while there's a witness on the stand.\n\nThe defense rests!\n\n[soft dramatic music] Summation,\n\nThe People Vs. Larry Flynt.\n\nI am not trying to convince you\n\nthat you should like what Larry Flynt does.\n\nI don't like what Larry Flynt does.\n\nBut what I do like is that I live in a country\n\nwhere you and I can make that decision for ourselves.\n\nBut then ask yourselves if you wanna make that decision\n\nfor the rest of us because the freedom\n\nthat everyone in this room enjoys--\n\nObjection.\n\nUp until this point, Edward Norton\n\nis totally appropriately talking\n\nto the jury about the context of the case.\n\nWe live in a free country.\n\nYou and I can make that decision for ourselves.\n\nBut once he starts suggesting\n\nthat the jury should have a role\n\nin setting policy for everyone\n\nand thinking about how this plays\n\ninto the future of the country,\n\nAsk yourselves if you wanna make that decision\n\nfor the rest of us.\n\nhe's stepping beyond the bounds\n\nof an appropriate closing statement.\n\nAnd that's not freedom.\n\n[ding]\n\nThe American legal system is incredibly complex,\n\nand no TV show or movie gets it exactly right.\n\nThat said, it's a lot of fun to watch them try.\n\n[people clapping] [chuckles]"
