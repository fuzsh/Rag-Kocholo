        "text": "Ray Milland directs and stars as a distinguished lawyer who must defend himself when accused of murdering the motorist who killed his daughter. Also starring Sylvia Syms and Felix Aylmer.\n\nAdapted from the play of the same name by Jack Roffey, which occurred five years earlier, the story concerns a highly considered English lawyer, Simon Crawford (Ray Milland) who is distraught when he discovers that his daughter has perished in a hit-and-run incident.\n\nThe driver continues to be at large, and Simon becomes fascinated with trying to find the person responsible.\n\nFollowing a startling turn of events, Simon is put on trial for the demise of a neighbour, who also occurred to be a judge. Originally represented by a younger…\n\nFollowing the death of his daughter in a hit and run accident and a subsequent breakdown, a cocksure barrister is accused of the murder of a friend while he claims he was lying knocked out by some unknown assailant.\n\nRay Milland is often an irascible presence and here that quality is given free reign by his director, who just happens to be himself.\n\nAnd it's doesn't really have anything to do with the character he portrays, it's pretty much the way he is in every film, only more so here where he 's someone who is apparently able to get anyone he's defending acquitted, regardless of whether or not they're guilty.\n\nIn short he's a bit of an arrogant shit.…"
