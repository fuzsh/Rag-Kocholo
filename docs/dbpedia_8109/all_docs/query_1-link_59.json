A hostile witness testifies against the party that called them or provides evidence contrary to their previous statements. Indian law states that just because a witness becomes hostile, their entire statement should not be discarded. Courts have discretion to accept parts of a hostile witness's testimony that are consistent and reject inconsistent parts. Relevant sections of the Indian Evidence Act pertaining to hostile witnesses are discussed.",
