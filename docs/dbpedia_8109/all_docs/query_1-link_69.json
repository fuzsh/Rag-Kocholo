        "text": "Charles and L. Ron go to game 18 together to watch the Saints blow out the Falcons, then to a New Orleans bar to hope for help making the wild card. Guest cameos from some of our Men in the Dome and some fans in the Dome.\n\nWhat a satisfying win over the Buccaneers to make the final game of the season meaningful. Charles and L. Ron enjoyed it immensely. Tampa native and Bucs fan Andrew Lawrence of MMFA, not so much.\n\nSound engineering by LunarSnow\n\nCharles Star - bsky.app/profile/ugarles.bsky.social\n\nL. Ron Mexico - bsky.app/profile/lronmexico.bsky.social\n\nAndrew Lawrence - twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence\n\nDestiny is a fickle beast and if we ever controlled our own, we no longer do. L. Ron and Charles are joined by Plexico Gingrich, formerly of Ruthless Reviews, to talk about the Saints' dispiriting loss to the Rams in a season of dispiriting losses. Plus, a lot of talk about gambling, the DFS industry and the monsters and idiots that comprise the world.\n\nYou can find Plex's old movie reviews at RuthlessReviews.com\n\nSound engineering by Dan Parshall\n\nCharles Star - bsky.app/profile/ugarles.bsky.social\n\nL. Ron Mexico - bsky.app/profile/lronmexico.bsky.social\n\nPlexico Gingrich - https://twitter.com/ruthlessreviews\n\nDan Parshall - bsky.app/profile/enterim.bsky.social and you can listen to Candy Necklace at candynecklacephl.bandcamp.com/album/no-lâ¦e-low-life\n\nThe Saints roll on at home, this time through the Giants. L. Ron had a work emergency so Charles had to get What a Time to Be Alive's Patrick Monahan ass alone. L. Ron returned for Man in the Dome with Skooks. Happy horns for all (except Pat.)\n\nListen to Patrick (with Kath Barbadoro and Eli Yudin) on WATTBA at https://whatatimepod.com/\n\nSound engineering by Dan Parshall\n\nCharles Star - https://bsky.app/profile/ugarles.bsky.social\n\nL. Ron Mexico - https://bsky.app/profile/lronmexico.bsky.social\n\nPatrick Monahan - https://bsky.app/profile/pattymo.com\n\nSkooks - https://bsky.app/profile/skookses.bsky.social\n\nDan Parshall - https://bsky.app/profile/enterim.bsky.social and you can listen to Candy Necklace at https://candynecklacephl.bandcamp.com/album/no-life-low-life\n\nHappy horns ring out as the Saints break their losing streak and move back into (lol) first place in the abysmal NFC South. Joining Ron and Charles to lament how far his tepid support for the Panthers has fallen is Canadian transplant / Duke walk-on, George Pearkes. We Get His Ass, plus Skooks is back as the Man in the Dome.\n\nCharles Star - bsky.app/profile/ugarles.bsky.social\n\nL. Ron Mexico - bsky.app/profile/lronmexico.bsky.social\n\nGeorge Pearkes - bsky.app/profile/pearkes.bsky.social\n\nSkooks - bsky.app/profile/skookses.bsky.social\n\nSound engineering by LunarSnow.\n\nMore sad horns after the Saints fall to the Lions. Charles and L. Ron are joined by Defector's Blog Girl Lauren Theisen who is kinder than she needed to be about Getting Our Ass. Plus memories of Michigan. Plus, Skooks is back as the Man in the Dome.\n\nRead Lauren at the wonderful Defector.com, home of all your faves.\n\nCharles Star - https://bsky.app/profile/ugarles.bsky.social\n\nL.
