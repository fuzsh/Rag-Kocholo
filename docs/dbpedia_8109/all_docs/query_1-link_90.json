        "text": "Michael J. Hutter\n\nA common occurrence in the trial of an action is a party, compelled by the exigencies of the party’s case, calling as a witness a person who has knowledge of facts favorable to the party’s case but whose testimony regarding the matter in issue may be contrary to what was expected and harmful to the calling party’s case.\n\nSuch a situation may occur where the witness is an adverse party or a non-party witness who may be unfriendly. Such a witness may provide damaging testimony. For discussion of this concern, see Barker & Alexander, Evidence in New York State and Federal Courts (2d ed) §6:32. How may the attorney neutralize or minimize such testimony?\n\nIn the federal courts, the answer is readily available. The calling party may control such a witness through leading questions pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 612(c), and if, in fact, damaging testimony is given, the witness may be impeached through any available impeachment technique pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 607. However, the answer is not so clear under New York law. While direct examination may take the form of cross-examination by the use of leading questions, when that may be permitted is subject to various rules. As to impeaching the witness, New York law broadly proclaims impeachment of one’s own witness is generally not permitted, but exceptions abound.\n\nThis column will explore New York’s rules governing the questioning, including impeachment, of adverse parties and hostile witnesses on a party’s direct case. It will seek to clarify them to provide guidance to the bench and bar.\n\nExamining the Adverse Party and Hostile Witness\n\nNew York law had long recognized that a trial court has broad discretion to control the form of a question employed in the examination of witnesses. See, e.g., Downs v. New York Central R.R. Co., 47 N.Y. 83, 88 (1871); People v. Mather, 4 Wendell 229, 247 (Supreme Court of Judicature, 1830). One form of examination is to question the witness through the use of leading questions. Notably, the use of leading questions is not flatly prohibited. Wallis v. Randall, 81 N.Y. 164 (1880). However, the courts have adopted the view that leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness’s testimony. This view was embraced due to the Court of Appeals’ recognition of the danger of the witness accepting the version of the events put forth by the attorney to the exclusion of what the witness may have or have not actually perceived. See generally Barker & Alexander, supra, at §6:70.\n\nAs to the exception pertinent here, the Court of Appeals in Becker v. Koch, 104 N.Y. 394, 401 (1887), held: “An adverse witness may be cross-examined and leading questions may be put to him by the party calling him, for the very sensible and sufficient reason that he is adverse and that the danger arising from such a mode of examination by the party calling a friendly or unbiased witness does not exist.” The rule as developed permits, but does not mandate, the use of leading questions on the direct examination of a witness when the witness is “an adverse party or closely identified with an adverse party or has indicated hostility to the party or counsel calling the witness.” Martin, Capra & Rossi, N.Y Evidence 2d ed, §6.12.3, at p. 544.\n\nWith respect to an adverse party as the witness, the Second Department in Fox v. Tedesco, 15 A.D.3d 538, 539 (2d Dep’t 2005), observed that “where … an adverse party is called as a witness, it may be assumed that such party is a hostile party, and in the discretion of the court, direct examination may assume the nature of cross-examination by the use of leading questions.” Notably, an adverse party does not become hostile merely because the party is adverse. Rather, the trial court retains discretion to determine whether the adverse party is in fact “hostile,” as the Second Department in Fox indicated. Other Appellate Division departments have adopted the same view. For example, the Third Department in Matter of Ostrader v. Ostrader, 280 A.D.2d 793 (3d Dep’t 2001), held Family Court in the underlying custody proceeding did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the petitioner-mother to use leading questions in examining the respondent-father regarding the children’s possession of a gun. The reason was respondent was neither evasive or reluctant in answering questions regarding the children and guns before the request to treat him as hostile was made. The Fourth Department in Matter of Arlene W. v. Robert D., 36 A.D.2d 455 (4th Dep’t 1971), similarly held that while an adverse party should ordinarily be presumed to be hostile, a trial court retains discretion to find otherwise.\n\nThis same view extends to witnesses who are closely identified with the adverse party. Thus, an adverse party’s spouse or employee can be viewed as “hostile.” See People v. Rozanski, 209 A.D.2d 1018, 1018-1019 (4th Dep’t 1994) (defendant’s wife); Myers v. New York City Tr. Auth., 50 A.D.3d 263 (1st Dep’t 2008) (defendant’s employee).\n\nWith respect to other witnesses, a witness may be known to be unfriendly before being called or the witness’s hostility becomes evident when being examined. Whether that witness can be viewed in fact as “hostile” is a determination to be made by the trial court in the exercise of its discretion. See People v. Dann, 14 A.D.3d 795, 797 (3d Dep’t 2005); People v. Marshall, 163 A.D.2d 826, 826-27 (4th Dep’t 1990). Among the factors the trial court will take into consideration are the witness’s demeanor, any prior relationship with the calling party or adverse party, reluctance to answer questions, claimed inability to recall facts, and overall evasiveness. Id.\n\nIn sum, when a party may have to call as a witness on the party’s direct case the adverse party or a potentially hostile witness in order to established an element of a claim on a defense or because of a perceived tactical advantage, there is always the risk of that witness providing testimony harmful to the calling party’s case. A means of minimizing such potential is the use of leading questions as they enable “the examiner to exercise much greater control over the witness by limiting the scope and content of that witness’s answers.” Haig, Commercial Litigation in New York State Courts (4th ed.) §41.20 With respect to the adverse party or a witness closely aligned with the adverse party, permission to treat such witness as a hostile witness, allowing the use of leading questions, should be sought when the examination starts. With other witnesses, such permission should be asked once the hostility becomes apparent.\n\nImpeaching the Adverse Party and Hostile Witness"
