        "text": "TORONTO — The Toronto Raptors waived oft-traded guard Luke Ridnour on Thursday.\n\nIt’s the bitter culmination of a comical series of minor transactions involving the journeyman. After joining four news teams in a week, Ridnour is now looking for a home.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of texts from friends and family worried about us,” Ridnour told USA TODAY Sports last week from his home in suburban Seattle. “I just laughed about it and realized my contract is the reason I’m getting traded and how valuable my deal is for teams in free agency.\n\n“I knew what was going on and never really got invested in any team that traded for me. We’ve taken it pretty light-hearted and laughed at all the funny pictures we’ve seen.”\n\nToronto acquired Ridnour and cash considerations from the Oklahoma City Thunder on June 30 for the draft rights to forward Tomislav Zubcic.\n\nAfter averaging four points and two assists for Orlando last season, he was dealt to Charlotte last month in a deal involving Memphis and then almost immediately sent to the Thunder along with a conditional 2016 second-round draft pick for guard Jeremy Lamb.\n\nRidnour, 34, has averaged 9.3 points, 4.5 assists in 830 games — 493 starts — with Seattle (2003-’08), Milwaukee (2008-’10, 2013-’14), Minnesota (2010-’13), Charlotte (2013-’14) and Orlando (2014-’15)."
