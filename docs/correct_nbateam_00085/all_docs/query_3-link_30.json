        "text": "Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPoint guard Luke Ridnour's wild offseason got even crazier Thursday as the 34-year-old veteran was waived by the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe organization announced the move on its official Twitter account, but getting released is far from the first transaction Ridnour has been involved in since the conclusion of the 2014-15 campaign.\n\nAs seen in this graphic, courtesy of CBS Sports NBA, the University of Oregon alum was traded a remarkable four times in six days:\n\nHe ended up in Toronto after stops with the Orlando Magic, the Memphis Grizzlies, the Charlotte Hornets and the Oklahoma City Thunder, but his stay north of the border was short-lived as well.\n\nAccording to former Brooklyn Nets assistant general manager Bobby Marks, the signing of forward Luis Scola made Ridnour expendable:\n\nRidnour will now be a free agent, assuming he clears waivers, which means he figures to remain with his new team for the foreseeable future if he finds a taker.\n\nPer NBA.com's David Aldridge, Ridnour has managed to maintain a good sense of humor despite all of the movement in recent weeks. He also feels as though he still has something to offer to NBA teams: \"Professionalism, and you know what you're going to get every day, working hard, and I'm on the court. You're going to get consistency in what I do, and I can run a team. I can still do all that stuff, and I still enjoy playing. But I'm going to go with family first. So we'll see what happens.\"\n\nRidnour has appeared in regular-season games with five different franchises, and he is coming off of a year in which he averaged four points and two assists per game for the Magic.\n\nWith career averages of 9.3 points and 4.5 assists per contest, there is little doubt that Ridnour is a serviceable, savvy veteran who can provide quality depth.\n\nHis crazy offseason may cause some to assume that he is an unwanted commodity in the NBA, but he is a consummate pro who should fit well into any situation."
