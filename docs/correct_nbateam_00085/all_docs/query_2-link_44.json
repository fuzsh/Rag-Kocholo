        "text": "Thu, Jul 11, 2013 at 11:30pm\n\nMARTIN TO MINNY, RIDNOUR TO MILWAUKEE IN 3-TEAMER\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves acquired shooting guard Kevin Martin and cash from the Oklahoma City Thunder. Oklahoma City acquired the draft rights to Szymon Szewczyk from the Milwaukee Bucks, and a Traded Player Exception. And Milwaukee acquired point guard Luke Ridnour and a 2014 second-round draft pick from the Minnesota Timberwolves, plus cash from the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nWhat does it give the Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nThe Thunder essentially give up some cash here to pick up the rights to longtime prospect Szewczyk, while helping free agent Martin get paid a max deal in a sign-and-trade to Minnesota. Although Szewczyk hasn't come over to the NBA despite being drafted a decade ago, he is still an intriguing player with a well-rounded game and great size. The Thunder have been looking for options in the paint for awhile now, and if they can ever convince Szewczyk to make the leap to the NBA he could be a steal for them. Martin was their sixth man last season but they appear to be moving on from him. The Trade Exception allows the Thunder to trade for a player without sending out the same salary value in return (so long as they do so within a year).\n\nWhat does it give the Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nMartin provides the T-Wolves with a proven veteran scorer at shooting guard, one who can start and hold the spot while draftee {P Shabazz Muhammad} learns the NBA ropes. Last season Ridnour was Minnesota's starting 2-guard for parts of the season but he's really a point guard, and Minny has several other point-men around so Ridnour was expendable for salary reasons. The cash from Oklahoma City helps pay for Martin's salary.\n\nWhat does it give the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nMilwaukee has been involved in several deals so far this off-season, and this is another solid one. Ridnour knows the Bucks well and can be a quality backup at both backcourt spots for them. He played for Milwaukee before (two seasons from 2008 to 2010) and can provide stability; it's unclear who the Bucks' starting point guard will be next season ({P Brandon Jennings} or {P Jeff Teague}?) and shooting guard also needs depth (although several reports say {P O.J. Mayo} is expected to sign). The 2014 second-round pick simply sweetens the deal for Milwaukee, which didn't have to give much up here."
