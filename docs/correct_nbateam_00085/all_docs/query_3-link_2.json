        "text": "One of the most gifted point guards in school history created an instant buzz on campus with his precision passing and remarkable dribbling skills. Accentuating his lore as a tireless competitor by finding a way into Mac Court after hours, Oregon’s floor general started 96 consecutive games and directed it to the 2002 Pac-10 regular season title - the Ducks’ first outright crown since 1939. The Blaine, Wash., native was truly outstanding in the 2002 NCAA Tournament where he helped lead Oregon to the Elite Eight. Earning 2001 Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors following his initial campaign in Eugene served as a warm-up for his final two seasons. As a sophomore, the all-league selection used the 2002 NCAA tournament to showcase his skills. In one of the most underrated classics in school history, Ridnour scored 28 points on 7-of-11 shooting from three-point range as Oregon eclipsed a strong Wake Forest team in the second round. The two-time Associated Press All-America honorable mention pick and 2003 Pac-10 Player of the Year averaged 19.7 points and 6.6 assists per game his final season in leading Oregon to the 2003 Pac-10 Tournament crown and a second straight NCAA appearance. He set the school record with 218 assists as a junior and scored 649 points that year to rank third in school history at the time. He also surpassed a conference pinnacle by making 62 consecutive free throws. The 14th overall selection by the Seattle Supersonics in the 2003 NBA Draft still ranked 15th in career scoring (1,399 points), third in assists (500), third in three-point field goal percentage (.859), fifth in steals (150), and sixth in three-pointers (203) some 11 years after his final game as a Duck, and went on to enjoy the longest NBA career of any Oregon alum."
