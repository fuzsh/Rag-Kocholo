        "text": "Five years ago, in Luke Ridnour’s final season in Seattle, he played with future hall of famer Kevin Durant. While a reunion with Durant is unlikely, Ridnour could soon call another expected hall of famer a teammate: New York Knick Carmelo Anthony. The Knicks are one of several teams with interest in the Minnesota Timberwolves guard, according to a league source.\n\nLong-time NBA reporter Chris Sheridan is reporting the Wolves are expected to move guard Luke Ridnour. Utah likes Ridnour, according to a source. But a separate source said the Jazz are not willing to deal guards Alec Burks and Raja Bell for Ridnour. In fact, Burks is off-limits in the discussions involving Ridnour. The most logical scenario involves Utah sacrificing the worse of its two first-round picks in the June draft — the Jazz also owns Golden State’s selection — and Bell for Ridnour. Bell has an expiring contract. The Wolves don’t appear to be involved in any blockbuster trade talks.\n\nLuke Ridnour is being shopped by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and a league source told SheridanHoops.com “there is a good chance” the 10th-year point guard will be dealt before the Feb. 21 trade deadline. With Ricky Rubio back from an injury that wiped out the first half of his season, the T-Wolves have a glut at the position with J.J. Berea also under contract (for this season plus two more). Ridnour has a reasonable contract ($4 million this season, $4.3 million next season) and is a steady playmaker who has spent the majority of his career with bad teams, having appeared in the playoffs just twice."
