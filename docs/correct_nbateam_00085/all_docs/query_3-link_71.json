We won two. We lost my sophomore year in the state finals and won in my junior and senior year. It was fun because my school was so small (in Blaine, Wash.). All the kids I grew up with since first grade were on the same team. It was the first state title in school history. So for us to win it was pretty cool.\n\nI stay in touch with all of them. I was the point guard, but I was one of the taller ones, so I did a little bit of everything.\n\nIt’s never fun to lose. For me, it’s not until I get home and see my family that there’s perspective. You get to see your little guys running around, and they don’t care if you won or lost.\n\nI have three kids – all boys. They’re 2-1/2 years old and 11 months old. The twins are 11 months. It’s tough when you have twins and a 2-1/2 year old. They keep you busy. And we’re definitely in diaper mode.\n\nI got married at 24. I met her when I was 20. We met when I was in college. I just knew she was the one when I saw her.\n\nI’m a nice guy.\n\nBesides basketball, I played tennis and baseball in high school. In baseball, I did a little bit of everything. Outfield. Infield. We were a small school, so I was all over the place. I tried pitching, but my arm was so bad.\n\nMy parents had a big influence on my life. They got me involved in sports.\n\nWorst thing I did as a kid? We used to egg houses every weekend. It was nobody’s house in particular. We just liked to egg people.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I wanted to grow up to be a basketball player.\n\nIf I had a time machine, I’d like to go back to when Christ was alive. I’d want to be with him.\n\nFavorite cartoon growing up? “Transformers.” I liked the movies, too.\n\nFavorite cereal? Froot Loops.\n\nIf I could have any superpower, I’d want to be like Spiderman and go building to building.\n\nFunniest movie ever made? That’s a hard question. I like “Old School.” I like “Happy Gilmore.” What else is a classic? “Christmas Vacation.” That’s a classic.\n\nMy favorite movie is “Braveheart.”\n\nI don’t have a favorite actor or actress.\n\nPet peeve? Loud, chewing of gum. People that chomp.\n\nI’m a steak and potatoes guy.\n\nThe toughest part about being a pro basketball player is being away from the family. It’s just so much fun being around them. They don’t really understand why you’re gone.\n\nI want to be known as a good player, a good teammate. More importantly, I just want to be known as a man of God – someone who serves the Lord and plays for him and not myself.\n\nMy reaction to J.J. Barea joining us? You know, I’m been around long enough that whatever happens, I don’t really worry about it. I’m going to just come and compete. He’s a good player, so whatever can help our team, I’m in.\n\nI’ve got a feeling it’s going to turn around pretty soon (for the Timberwolves).\n\nI don’t really have a prized possession. No material things, really.\n\nBest book I ever read? “When Heaven Invades Earth.”\n\nI don’t have time for video games.\n\nMy idea of a perfect day is being with the family and just hanging with them. My kids love being outside, so just being outside would be fine.\n\nMy teammates would be surprised to know that I got third in the state in tennis. I did it my senior year. I still play tennis in the offseason. I never really played much. It just came kind of natural. It was fun.\n\nI’m big into worship music. I like a band called “Jesus Culture.”\n\nThere’s no time for TV any more. I used to like “The Office.”\n\nThe TV usually is on PBS and the Disney Channel now.\n\nI wouldn’t change anything about my life. I don’t regret anything.\n\nThe best advice I ever got was to forget what happened and keep going.\n\nI’m sure I’ve gotten bad advice, but nothing comes to mind.\n\nIf I could trade places for a day with anyone, I’d like to be a pro tennis player for a day. I’d pick an American. Andy Roddick. Just to be on the tour would be fun.\n\nI want my epitaph to say, “Here lies Luke Ridnour, a man of God who served the Lord and put Him first in everything he did.”\n\nBob Sansevere can be reached at bsansevere@pioneerpress.com.\n\nOriginally Published: January 16, 2012 at 11:01 p.m."
