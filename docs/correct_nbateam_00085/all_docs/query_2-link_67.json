        "text": "Ben Gordon. Channing Frye. Aaron Gordon. Elfrid Payton. Evan Fournier.\n\nI'm probably missing someone, but that's practically a brand new starting five for the Orlando Magic with the additions they have made this off-season via free agency and the draft. Add in young hold overs from last season such as Victor Oladipo, Nikola Vucevic, Tobias Harris and Moe Harkless and this Magic squad doesn't look much like a bottom feeder anymore.\n\nBut clearly the Magic aren't done improving their roster. Orlando signed veteran point guard Luke Ridnour to two-year deal yesterday, reports TNT's David Aldridge.\n\nHoop fans from the Northwestern part of the country might remember Frodo from his days at the University of Oregon where he led the Pac-10 in assists in the 2002-03 season.\n\nNo? Well perhaps they remember him for his time in Seattle as a Supersonic where the point guard co-starred in the Ray Allen & Rashard Lewis show and played a bit with Kevin Durant from 2003 to 2008. In Ridnour's best years in Seattle, he averaged around 11 points and 6 assists per game while starting most of the time.\n\nRIDNOUR IN SEATTLE:\n\nSeason\n\nAge\n\nTm\n\nPos\n\nG\n\nGS\n\nMP\n\nFG%\n\n3P%\n\nFT%\n\nTRB\n\nAST\n\nSTL\n\nBLK\n\nTOV\n\nPF\n\nPTS\n\n2003-04\n\n22\n\nSEA\n\nPG\n\n69\n\n6\n\n16.1\n\n.414\n\n.338\n\n.823\n\n1.6\n\n2.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.5\n\n5.5\n\n2004-05\n\n23\n\nSEA\n\nPG\n\n82\n\n82\n\n31.4\n\n.405\n\n.376\n\n.883\n\n2.5\n\n5.9\n\n1.1\n\n0.3\n\n1.8\n\n2.3\n\n10.0\n\n2005-06\n\n24\n\nSEA\n\nPG\n\n79\n\n77\n\n33.2\n\n.418\n\n.289\n\n.877\n\n3.0\n\n7.0\n\n1.6\n\n0.3\n\n2.1\n\n2.3\n\n11.5\n\n2006-07\n\n25\n\nSEA\n\nPG\n\n71\n\n58\n\n29.5\n\n.433\n\n.353\n\n.805\n\n2.3\n\n5.2\n\n1.2\n\n0.3\n\n2.2\n\n2.5\n\n11.0\n\n2007-08\n\n26\n\nSEA\n\nPG\n\n61\n\n5\n\n20.0\n\n.399\n\n.296\n\n.857\n\n1.5\n\n4.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n1.3\n\n2.0\n\n6.4\n\n5 seasons\n\nSEA\n\n362\n\n228\n\n26.6\n\n.415\n\n.335\n\n.855\n\n2.2\n\n5.0\n\n1.1\n\n0.2\n\n1.7\n\n2.1\n\n9.1\n\nSince leaving the Sonics, Ridnour has spent time with the Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves and most recently the Charlotte Bobcats last season. Ridnour averaged 5.0 points and 2.9 assists while splitting 61 games with the Bucks and Bobcats Hornets last season.\n\nRidnour is expected to be a back up to the younger guards, Payton and Oladipo, and did a decent job in that role last season backing up Kemba Walker in Charlotte, averaging about 2.5 points and three assists per game in their first round playoff series against the Miami Heat.\n\nWith Ridnour and other additions made to the roster this off-season, the Magic might not have a playoff team just yet, but they might be on the right track.\n\n--"
