Kevin is familiar with Coach Adelman's style of play and had success playing for him in Sacramento and Houston. We expect that to continue in Minnesota.\"\n\nAccording to Jerry Zgoda, the Wolves could finalize free-agent deals with Chase Budinger and Corey Brewer on Friday.\n\nThe Turiaf he's referring to is 6-foot-10 center Ronny Turiaf, who will sign a two-year, $3.2 million deal on Friday, according to his agent.\n\nTuriaf, 30, played about 11 mintues a game off the bench for the Clippers last season."
