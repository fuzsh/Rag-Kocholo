        "text": "April 18, 2003\n\nEUGENE, Ore. - Oregon basketball players Luke Jackson and Luke Ridnour have decided on a course of action for their immediate future, the two all-Pac-10 selections announced at a press conference at the Len Casanova Center Friday morning.\n\nJackson, a 6-7 guard from Creswell, Ore., will not submit his name for early entry into the NBA Draft.\n\nRidnour, a 6-2 guard from Blaine, Wash., has submitted a letter requesting early entry into the NBA Draft. He will not be signing with an agent, allowing him to keep all of his options open, including a return to Oregon for his senior season. Ridnour said a final decision will likely not come until immediately prior to the June 19 deadline.\n\nJackson averaged 16.0 points and 6.9 rebounds per game this season and was the only player in the Pac-10 ranked among the league's top 10 in scoring, rebounds, assists and steals. He ranks 11th in UO career scoring with 1,314 points, fifth in steals with 121 and ninth in assists 285.\n\nRidnour, an Associated Press honorable mention All-American, became just the second player ever to be named Pac-10 regular season player of the year and tournament MVP. He ranked second in the Pac-10 scoring 19.7 points per game and led the league with 6.6 assists per game.\n\nHe set school and Pac-10 records with 62 consecutive free throws made in January and February. He set an Oregon record with 218 assists this season and tied another with 63 steals. On the UO career lists, he ranks ninth in scoring with 1,399 points, third in assists with 500, second in steals with 150 and third in three-pointers with 203.\n\nBoth players are on track to graduate next year.\n\nImportant Dates:"
