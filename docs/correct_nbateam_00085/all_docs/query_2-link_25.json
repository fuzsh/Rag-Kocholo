        "text": "Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Luke Ridnour practiced without discomfort on Tuesday and expects to play on Wednesday night when the Timberwolves take on the Detroit Pistons in Winnipeg. Ridnour is recovering from a herniated disc in his back. He received a cortisone shot on Friday, Oct. 19 and has felt better since then.\n\nRidnour missed the Timberwolves first two preseason games and their most recent preseason game against the Chicago Bulls on Oct. 19. He has played in two preseason games thus far this season. Ridnour was unsure if he would start against the Pistons on Wednesday and said he was looking forward to getting his conditioning back.\n\nRidnour started 53 games last season for Minnesota and is expected to be the starting point guard at least until Ricky Rubio recovers from knee surgery. Last season Ridnour averaged 12.1 points and 4.8 assists in 33 minutes per game."
