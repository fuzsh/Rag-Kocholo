        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies have added another point guard. Memphis acquired Luke Ridnour from the Orlando Magic on Wednesday, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports. In exchange, Orlando is acquiring the rights to 2013 second-round pick Janis Timma.\n\nRidnour turns 35 next season, and the Grizzlies will be the sixth different team of his career. He was selected No. 14 overall out of Oregon in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Seattle Sonics, playing the first five years of his career with the team. He's made pit stops in Milwaukee, Minnesota and Charlotte before arriving in Orlando.\n\nRidnour appeared in 47 games last season, averaging four points per game in just 14 minutes of play. He posted an assist-to-turnover ratio better than 2:1, but his three-point percentage fell to 31.7.\n\nHe could include a point guard rotation that already has Beno Udrih and Nick Calathes, should either return to Memphis. Udrih has a non guaranteed contract, while Calathes is set to hit restricted free agency."
