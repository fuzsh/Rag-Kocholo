        "text": "A long overdue article on this player. If you wanna talk about a player who had a substantial amount of skill but never really stood out above the others — quite literally — Luke Ridnour is your guy. But in his 12 year career in the NBA, Ridnour made a huge impact with his style of play and evolution throughout the years.\n\nHe may have not been as flashy as Jason “White Chocolate” Williams once was, but Luke Ridnour showed similar flashes of the types of passes he could make for his teammates. He had an underrated ability to scan the floor as being the general of his team. He would intelligently set his teammates up with pocket passes in comfortable positions. If Ridnour would have ever been the first option for a team, there could be an argument that he would be one of the best point guards during his time. But he never had that chance. Regardless, Ridnour’s long career made a huge impact on every organization he suited up for.\n\nLet’s backtrack to Ridnour’s early days with the Seattle SuperSonics. Despite being the third-stringer behind Flip Murray and Antonio Daniels, Nate McMillan still gave Ridnour the minutes to produce. Ridnour had a great showing in his rookie debut with multiple 15+ point games. The following season, he was inserted into the starting lineup for all 82 games, and became a major factor in the Sonics 52-win season alongside Ray Allen.\n\nRidnour began to flourish well with guys like Ray, Rashard Lewis, and even a young Kevin Durant. He became a fanatic at distributing the basketball alongside being a scorer when needed to. The Sonics saw plenty of success with Ridnour. But after the signing of head coach Bob Hill, in addition to Ray Allen’s departure, the Sonics were moving in another direction. Ridnour was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in 2008.\n\nRidnour did have some strong showings in a Bucks uni. His position was switched to more of a role player off the bench, but Ridnour still made the most of his situation. His strong 2009–10 campaign allowed the NBA to understand how he could still provide scoring at a high level. Ridnour would find his way in Minnesota the following season, where he would spend three moons with the franchise.\n\nThere’s a lot to highlight in Luke Ridnour’s career; it is important to understand the value that he brought to the floor during the decade-plus time he spent balling. If Ridnour was placed on a championship contender, he could have elevated his game to another level and received more recognition — like a Jason Williams — but he just never had that opporunity. He should be remembered as a lethal point guard, and when his team needed his leadership the most, he always delivered."
