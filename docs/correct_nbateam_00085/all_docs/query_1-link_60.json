        "text": "Oklahoma City traded shooting guard Kevin Martin to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a sign-and-trade deal.\n\nMartin, who has played for Sacramento, Houston and Oklahoma City in the past four seasons, gives the Timberwolves a perimeter scorer who will likely start immediately.\n\nMinnesota needed to complete another deal earlier Thursday to create cap room for Martin, and also received cash from the Thunder to create a trade exception slot.\n\nThe Wolves found a trade partner in the Milwaukee Bucks, not waiting for resolution of the Jeff Teague offer sheet to add a point guard, acquired veteran Luke Ridnour from the Timberwolves in a trade Thursday.\n\nRidnour was in a logjam in Minnesota, which plans to start Ricky Rubio and has Alexey Shved and J.J. Barea to run the second unit.\n\nThe Bucks offered a four-year contract to Atlanta Hawks restricted free agent Jeff Teague. Teague would likely become the starter for the Bucks. Brandon Jennings, the starter in Milwaukee last year, is reportedly being discussed as a sign-and-trade option for the Hawks to replace Teague."
