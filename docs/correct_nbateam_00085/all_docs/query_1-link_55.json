        "text": "A lot has changed in Timberwolves Land since mid-May. It was then that the organization was informed that Kevin Love planned to opt out and leave the franchise — per his contractual rights — in the summer of 2015. From that point through August 23, Flip Saunders was scrambling. Not only did he have multiple picks in the June draft, but he was also charged with the task of trading a superstar player.\n\nRather than re-hash the process and results for the umpteenth time, it’s sufficient to say that Flip got ‘er done. For Love, he got back Andrew Wiggins, Anthony Bennett and Thaddeus Young. If either Wiggins or Bennett reaches his potential (or, gasp, if both do) it could go down as the greatest ever return in this “departing/disgruntled star wants out” trade scenario. Plus, Thad Young is already a good player who might fit nicely in a front court that already includes Gorgui Dieng and Nikola Pekovic at the center position.\n\nBut there is one little problem with this Timberwolves roster, as currently constructed:\n\nThere are too many guys. (Eds. Note: For more on this, see, inter alia, excellent posts here and here.)\n\nMore specifically, there are too many guys that will expect — and *should* expect — some playing time. And that brings us to positional battles, and the possibility that some Timberwolves players will need to spend time in the D-League — playing for the Iowa Energy (technically this is the Memphis Grizzlies affiliate, but that’s where they sent Shabazz last year because the Wolves don’t have their own team). Saunders has extensive experience in minor league basketball, coaching in the old CBA, and is a firm believer in it as a developing environment for certain players. It seems inevitable that, at some point this season, a Wolf or two will be sent down for some game reps.\n\nFor a young basketball player, the NBA — even on the Minnesota Timberwolves — must feel a bit like heaven on Earth. There are the big crowds, the SportsCenter highlights, the glitz and glamor, and the competition against players that were considered celebrity heroes just a short time ago. The whole thing must be a real trip for a new player entering the league.\n\nThe D-League… well, the D-League probably feels a bit more like Iowa.\n\nSo we thought it worthwhile to run through the candidates for D-League Duty, and predict which guys might end up playing some minor league ball in 2014-15.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWell, that was interesting. I had planned on doing a special post that analyzed the Love-Griffin matchup, breaking down each possession where they guarded one another. Since I did the work (the few times the matchup occurred) I’ll post the results, below. But the obvious story from this game was that just when Lob City was imposing its will on the young Muskies from Minnesota, Derrick Williams Happened. And then Michael Beasley Happened. Just check out the box score. Two bench forwards EACH SCORED 27 POINTS!!! Beasley shot 11 for 15; Williams 9 for 10. Each made every attempted 3-pointer (Beasley 3-3, Williams 4-4) and each made every shot they attempted in the 4th Quarter (I think). These two PUMMELED the Paul-Griffin combo when it mattered most. This wasn’t some lottery-bound, spongy defense either. D-Thrill was doing elbow-flying jump stops on Kenyon Martin, the meanest forward in basketball. Supercool Beas was torching Caron Butler.\n\nAnyway, I won’t extrapolate too much on this performance. It’s obviously anomalous for any players–let alone a couple of young and unproven ones like Beasley and Williams–to combine for a 20-25 shooting night and 54 points off the bench. But Pat and I are card-carrying fans/supporters/apologists of both players, so we’re sure-as-shit going to give some props when Williams and Beasley shine on one of the biggest stages in the league.\n\nIn this League Pass Era, this game was being witnessed all over the country by hoops junkies, and Beasley-Williams will be the buzz tomorrow morning. What a fun game to watch.\n\n—\n\nNow, to that Love-Griffin Matchup:\n\nSince Love and Blake are widely considered the league’s best young power forwards, I thought it would be fun to take a closer look at their matchup in tonight’s game. I noted what happened each time the two matched up on one another and anything happened. (Essentially, I ignored possessions where they weren’t guarding one another, and possessions where they simply passed the ball without any activity surrounding the matchup, like a double-team.)\n\nHere’s the list:\n\n1st Quarter\n\nBlake on Offense:\n\nPosts up Love, head fakes, up-and-under, 2 points\n\nBlake slides behind Love for alley-oop dunk attempt, misses dunk\n\nPass comes to Blake on wing/mid-post, Love gambles for steal and misses, Blake has open path for dunk\n\nBlake squares up from top of key (20 feet) and clanks a jumper\n\nHard double team comes from Rubio, Blake passes out leads to ball swing and jumpshot attempt\n\nSquares up and drives, Love fouls him at the rim, Love exits game cursing out refs\n\nLove on Offense:\n\nSquares up and hits jumper in Blake’s face\n\nDribble drive, takes difficult, contested jumper and misses\n\nPick and roll, catches pass but DeAndre Jordan is help defender and blocks shot\n\n2nd Quarter\n\nBlake on Offense\n\n(No matchups)\n\nLove on Offense\n\nSquares up and dribble drives, Blake flops for charge–no call–and Love is fouled by help defender on shot\n\nPosts up, ball poked away and it’s call out of bounds off Love\n\n3rd Quarter\n\nBlake on Offense\n\nMissed 3-pointer when he was floating around near end of shot clock\n\nFully double-teamed by Rubio, passes out for ball swing\n\nFights with Love for offensive rebound, gets it, is fouled on shot\n\nPosting up, pass sails overhead and out of bounds\n\nFloating 18 feet out as Paul drives, Love follows Paul toward basket, pass goes out to Blake and Love dares him to shoot — makes jumpshot.\n\nLove on Offense\n\nPosts up, misses hook shot\n\nPosts up for long sequence, 24-second buzzer goes off before shot, turnover\n\nPicks and pops, misses 3-pointer\n\n4th Quarter\n\n(No matchups, for reasons mentioned above.)\n\nA few thoughts on this matchup:\n\nFor the game, Love had 10 pts 7 rebs 2 asts 2 tos\n\nFor the game, Griffin had 30 pts 7 rebs 4 asts 3 tos\n\nObviously, this was not Kevin Love’s night. He shot 4-13 for 10 points and 7 rebounds in 25 minutes. Everybody knows that isn’t him. As Williams was killing it, Love went into the locker room with some kind of injury. What was interesting for my exercise was how often Adelman had other defenders on Blake. Perhaps it was an attempt to keep him out of foul trouble–Blake had it going in the 1st Half (24 points) and was getting lots of contact off dribble penetration. Williams, Pekovic, and Darko defended Blake for the majority of this game, hence the few number of matchups for me to describe.\n\nBlake commands a double team–a full one. Not many in the league are in this category and he’s already there.\n\nBlake can’t shoot very well. Until he gets a better rhythm on his shot–jumper and free throws–he’ll be fighting with guys like Love and LaMarcus Aldridge for “Best 4 in the World” recognition. If he shot just a little bit better, it wouldn’t even be a discussion. His potential is so, so high.\n\n—\n\nThis was obviously a rather disjointed Game Wrap. Chris Paul had me worried; the Wolves had no answer for him until Williams made it rain from the Staples Center sky. If there are two measured take-aways for what to do next, they are:\n\n* Take two or three minutes from Kevin Love and give them to Derrick Williams. Love is awesome, but he isn’t the type of player that should lead the NBA in minutes per game as he currently does. He’s a rebounding big man. That’s exhausting work and the team would benefit from having a bit more energy from both Love and his eager replacement.\n\n* Give the Wes Johnson minutes to Michael Beasley already. Shit, we’ve seen the talent discrepancy and it’s outrageous that this goes on. Beasley will upset us sometimes with a blown assignment or a ball-stop. But he’ll also go off from time to time, and he’ll ALWAYS be a better all-around basketball player than Wes.\n\nLakers tomorrow night. Kobe was concussed by D-Wade in the All-Star Game (yes, this happened) so he may not play tomorrow. Maybe it can be a Staples Sweep?\n\nSeason Record: 18-17\n\nThe early season narrative for the TWolves has been that Ricky Rubio and Kevin Love are amazing players who need some help. Other starting players, most notably Wesley Johnson and Darko Milicic, have failed to provide meaningful production or consistent play that breeds any confidence in the two stars’ supporting cast.\n\nMichael Beasley led last year’s team in scoring per minute (21.4 per 36; 19.2 per game) but didn’t make himself many fans after ankle sprains on each leg derailed what looked like a promising season. In 73 games, he surpassed 30 points 8 times, and 40 points once. But the way he scored those points, often isolation sets with some ball-stoppage, isn’t popular or always fun to watch. Also, and much more significantly if we’re being fair, his defense was often times lazy and always incoherent. A plausible retort to this would be that he was simply “joining the club” of Rambis-coached wings who had no idea how to rotate defensively. Beasley had serious flaws to be addressed if he were going to be an impact player on an up-and-coming team led by Rubio and Love.\n\nThis season, some fans and analysts expected a breakout year from Supercool Mike, both because of Rubio’s playmaking but more so because Rick Adelman would devise schemes to get him the ball closer to the hoop. A problem with the Rambis triangle was that it often resorted to clearing out for Mike 24 feet from the basket for everyone else to stand and watch. This wasn’t good for Mike’s efficiency or the Timberwolves win/loss record. In the early going this year, he showed flashes of improved play. His defense was been better. Night and day. He’s played respectable defense on LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and even Kobe Bryant. If you watched Wellington try to guard Kevin Martin (or if you remember the days of Shaddy McCants trying to defend Baron Davis or LBJ) you’ve seen an outmatched defender in a Wolves uniform. This is not Michael Beasley. If he’s focused and coached, he’s an adequate-or-better defensive wing. His shot was colder than we’ve ever seen it in the early going. He put together stinkers of 11-27, 2-6, 5-16, and 4-12 before spraining his foot and missing the next 11 games. It should be noted that the Wolves were probably playing their best basketball in that early going against a brutal schedule. They trounced the Spurs and Mavs (with Dirk, unlike the second time they beat them without Mike) and held late-game leads on title-favorites OKC and Miami. But Mike needed his shot to fall like it used to before things could really take off for he and the team.\n\nOf course, the schedule weakened right around the time of the injury and the team ripped off an 11-game stretch of over-.500 basketball, going 6-5. THEY’RE BETTER WITHOUT BEASLEY! LOOK AT THE BALL MOVEMENT! Only, if you watched the Toronto or Atlanta games, you saw what happened against a respectable foe when the game slowed down and shot creating became a necessity. The Wolves have exactly one shot creator on the team, and he was sidelined for those games. You might also look at those 6 wins and notice that they came against either garbage competition (Wizards, Hornets, Kings, Pistons) or good teams that were without future Hall of Famers (Clippers without Chris Paul, Mavericks without Dirk Nowitzki). The record was inflated by an easy schedule. Despite what some desperately wanted to believe, the team was NOT better without its best scorer.\n\nFast forward to tonight’s game at Houston. The Rockets (who recently spanked the Mike-less Wolves at Target Center) held a mighty 9-2 home record heading into this game. Minnesota had no rest, traveling overnight into Houston after a hard-fought loss against LA. Houston rested last night in their beds at home. This was not a game the Wolves should have won.\n\nOh, but they did win, and they pummeled the Rockets behind Mike Beasley’s 34 points on 14 shots. Mike had his jumper going, his dribble penetration game going, and he was getting to the line where he hit all 12 attempts. His monster scoring performance led the way in this one, increasing the lead throughout the second half. The Ricky & Love show became a Minnesota Big 3, as Rubio damn-near f’d around and got a triple double (18 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds) and Love added 29 & 7 of his own.\n\nIs Mike going to score like this every night? Of course not. But he will some nights, and on those nights Minnesota will be almost unbeatable. When he’s clanking shot after shot? Sit him down, or watch Kevin Love collect rebounds. Beasley draws extra defenders, a skill that doesn’t show up in a box score but is essential to consistently-successful offense in the NBA. He also complements the team’s best players by adding a skill that neither possesses: a dominant one-on-one game that will foul out opponents, allow teammates to get some rest on offense, and challenge opposing coaches into lineup decisions they might not prefer.\n\nI hope this isn’t a one-game fluke, and an amazing coach like Adelman can draw as much of Beasley’s natural talent as is possible. He’s a restricted free agent this off-season and the forward duo lauded by John Hollinger last year could be really something, especially with the Spanish floor general leading the way.\n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\n* Martell Webster’s feisty defense in the second quarter turned the game. He plays D on a slightly-different level than his teammates. Watch a Memphis Grizzlies game for comparable effort and approach. This is an asset, for sure, especially from a guy that the team can afford to get in foul trouble (because he will, if he plays this way). Webster should be the starting shooting guard very soon. Let’s all hope his back stays healthy. No more of these.\n\n* Derrick Williams is frozen out of the rotation. TRADE DERRICK WILLIAMS will become a common meme. That could be wise, depending on the deal, but let’s not lose sight of the talent here, and how similarly-awesome college players with talent took their licks en route to NBA improvement. James Harden and Evan Turner took time to adjust, as Williams will. Biggest reasons for NOT trading him: (1) He’s on the rookie scale; and (2) He’s insurance against Love getting injured or Love bolting after 3 years. If he continues to improve as a power forward, and he will, those are not insignificant factors. A shooting guard can be signed in free agency this off-season, if need be.\n\n* Kyle Lowry versus Ricky Rubio could be an All-Star debate in the next few years. Lowry bested him at Target Center, and Ricky took this match. Very different players. Very good players.\n\nSeason Record: 10-11"
