Not a lot out there:\n\nFormer Oregon point guard Luke Ridnour has signed with the Orlando Magic for a two-year, $5.5 million dollar deal. Ridnour, 32, has played 11 NBA seasons with the Seattle SuperSonics, Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Charlotte Bobcats. This new contract will take him through year 13, and put him just shy of $50 million in career earnings. Not a bad little career for himself.\n\nFormer Duck Brandon Austin won't be charged in connection with a sexual assault at Providence due to legally insufficient evidence. Dear Mr. Austin, you've been kicked out of two schools in a year for your inability to control yourself and are lucky you're not sitting in a prison. Get your shit together.\n\nMaarty Leunen has been looking good at a stretch-4 with an outside stroke for the Houston Rockets in their summer league. He's hoping for a training camp invite and, with a gutted roster, he may have a shot to make Houston's squad.\n\nTyson Alger of the Oregonian takes a look at the Oregon receiving corps.\n\nVideo\n\nOregon commit Taj Griffin ran the 40 at The Opening, clocking in with a 4.34. That's fast.\n\n.\n\nThat's all I've got for today. If you find more, share. GO DUCKS!"
