        "text": "Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Luke Ridnour became the latest victim to the plague of injuries infecting the team.\n\nPlaying increased minutes in the absence of Ricky Rubio, whose season ended when he blew out his knee on March 9, Ridnour sprained his ankle late in the third quarter of Minnesota's 116-108 Monday night loss to the Sacramento Kings.\n\nHe is expected to miss Wednesday's game against the Golden State Warriors, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nThe Wolves' other point guard, J.J. Barea, is already battling a thigh injury. He is expected back Wednesday, but his return doesn't figure to add any depth.\n\nAlong with Rubio, Ridnour and Barea, the other guard on the Wolves' roster is Malcolm Lee, a rookie from UCLA. Lee has played in just nine games this season and is averaging 2.6 points.\n\nOh, and Michael Beasley is still dealing with a toe injury.\n\nFor more on the Minnesota Timberwolves, check out Canis Hoopus.
