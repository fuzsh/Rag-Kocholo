        "text": "As Gery Woelfel of the Racine Journal Times reports, Orlando Magic guard Luke Ridnour is contemplating retiring after the 2014/15 season ends. \"Ridnour [...] said he isn't sure he'll play beyond this season,\" says Woelfel.\n\nRidnour, who turned 34 in February, signed a two-year contract with the Magic in July, with the second season reportedly unguaranteed. He's played a minimum role for Orlando in his first season with the club, making just 37 appearances and averaging a career-low 13.9 minutes per game, nearly five minutes fewer than his previous career-low, which figure he set in the 2013/14 campaign he split between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nThough Ridnour remains a solid, low-mistake playmaker, his other skills have declined: his foul-drawing rate, once one of his most valuable offensive contributions, has cratered as he's aged, and his three-point shot has eluded him in Orlando, where he's connected on only 29.5 percent of his attempts. Account for his defensive limitations and it's easy to understand why he may think it's time to hang 'em up.\n\nShould Ridnour retire, he'd leave Elfrid Payton as the only true point guard on Orlando's roster. But the Magic can probably find a replacement easily enough, especially given the frequency with which Victor Oladipo initiates the offense from the two-guard spot.\n\nRidnour owns career averages of 9.4 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game."
