        "text": "A new season, new players, new coach, but will we see a different result? Will we have another icy cold winter in the Twin Cities, or for the first time since Garnett departed in 2007, will we see a competitive TWolves squad?\n\nThe Timberwolves started 2010-11 losing 7 of their first 8 games, 24 of there first 30 and ended the season on a 15-game losing streak. With just 17 wins last season--the NBA's worst regular season record, the TWolves have nowhere to go but up. With exciting rookies: Derrick Williams, Ricky Rubio & Malcolm Lee as well as some talented young players: Kevin Love, Michael Beasley, Wesley Johnson & Anthony Randolph, and most importantly a brand new coach: Rick Adelman--the Timberwolves are one of the most exciting teams of '11-'12.\n\nAs noted, in a previous post, we examined some possible starting lineups for the Timberwolves in 2011-12. Ultimately it comes to Ridnour or Ricky at the point, Wes or Malcolm Lee at the shooting guard, Beas or D-Will at the 3, K-Love at the 4 (yeah, just Love) and Darko or Randolph at the center.\n\nThe biggest position battle coming into the season will be the former #2 pick: Michael Beasley vs. the current #2 pick: Derrick Williams. A report from an unofficial source says the Rick Adelman is '50-50' on Beasley at the small forward, but apparently Adelman believes he can make him great. I've only heard this from one person, so I'm not sure we can believe this one. Ultimately, these are things that will be examined and decided during training camp. Another report, states that Beas has slimmed down a bit and also cut his braids, who knows, with a slighter frame and a clean cut, will we also see a more mature Beasley on and off the court, who will maximize his talents? I can only hope...\n\nThere's been chatter ever since the Timberwolves found out they'd be drafting 2nd overall, whether or not Michael Beasley would be with the Timberwolves this season. As of right now, Michael Beasley is seen as the starting small forward, but a lot can change with the Wolves during training camp. So much so, that Beasley may not stay with the Wolves for too much longer. There's a very good chance if the TWolves were able to acquire a consistent and reliable veteran shooting guard or center, Michael Beasley would be traded. Say, something like, Beas & Wes Johnson for Philadelphia's Andre Iguodala or Beas & Nikola Pekovic for the Clippers' Chris Kaman (this would also fill a big need for the Clippers at the small forward). Those are just a few scenarios, but there's a good chance that Beasley will remain with the Wolves for the majority of the season, which would likely put rookie Derrick Williams as the team's sixth man.\n\nKeeping an eye on the Wolves' other two rookies, guards: Ricky Rubio & Malcolm Lee. The Timberwolves and their fans have been waiting two long years for the European phenom and its almost certain that by season's end, Rubio will be the starting point guard. There's also a good chance, barring and trades, that fellow rookie Malcolm Lee could be the team's starting two-guard. At 205lbs. and a great young defensive guard, who can play both the 1 & the 2, Lee is exactly the type of player Adelman loves: young athletic defenders. So potentially, by the end of the season, the Timberwolves could be starting all three of their rookies. Rubio, Lee, D-Will, Love & Darko?\n\nTaking a look at the Northwest Division as well as the Western Conference Outlook, the Timberwolves could easily be poised for a breakout season. That being said, I don't believe the Wolves will be a playoff team, as it's likely, any Western Conference team is going to need 38-40 wins minimum to make the playoffs. Can the Timberwolves rise from the bottom of the Northwest Division they've been for far too long? In the Northwest: Portland Trailblazers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Utah Jazz, Denver Nuggets & the TWolves. Portland & Oklahoma City are a shoe-in to make the playoffs. Utah could make the playoffs, if the figure out the logjam at the forward and center positions and potentially find a good backcout player, the Jazz could also sneak in as an 7th or 8th seed. The Nuggets have Ty Lawson & Danilo Gallinari, they'll likely retain Arron Afflalo, lose Nene and of course three of their best players: J.R. Smith, Wilson Chandler & Kenyon Martin (all FAs) are stuck in China, likely until February or March. As such, my prediction for the Northwest?\n\nNORTHWEST\n\n1.) Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n2.) Portland Trailblazers\n\n3.) Utah Jazz\n\n4.) Minnesota Timberwolves\n\n5.) Denver Nuggets"
