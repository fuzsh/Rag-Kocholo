Ricky Rubio raises the number to four if the Spanish phenom joins the Wolves in 2011-12 and Ridnour, Flynn and Sessions are still on the roster. That scenario seems highly unlikely.\n\nThe crowd at point guard is forcing Kahn to prepare Wolves fans for more moves in a busy offseason, perhaps as soon as the club learns the extent of Flynn’s left hip flexor, which forced him to cut back his participation in last week’s summer league in Las Vegas.\n\n“It’s not my intent to have three healthy point guards on the roster, and I was very clear with Luke about that,” Kahn said. “I recognize that we have to alleviate the situation.”\n\nThe Wolves are weighing treatment options for Flynn, who suffered the injury in the final week of the regular season. He sat out the Wolves’ season-ending game against Detroit, the only game he missed as a rookie. Kahn said Flynn might have aggravated the injury during workouts at Target Center before the summer league.\n\nKahn said he wants to learn more about Flynn’s condition before deciding what to do at point guard. He cautioned that Flynn’s injury is not a “dire situation.”\n\n“We should know something in the next several days,” Kahn said about Flynn.\n\nKahn said he spoke with Sessions’ agent, James Wells, to clarify Sessions’ status with the team. With Ridnour expected to join the Wolves, Sessions had become the subject of trade rumors the past two weeks. Sessions was Flynn’s primary backup last season after leaving Milwaukee as a restricted free agent.\n\n“We don’t know how this will play out,” Kahn said. “We’re trying to be as open and honest about the situation as we can when we talk to people. I told Sessions’ agent that we have a situation where Ramon could be the starting point guard or we could trade him. In the meantime, he’s a member of the team and nobody has stopped thinking otherwise.”\n\nRidnour, 29, is keeping an open mind. He said Wednesday he was excited to join the Wolves, although he was in negotiations for a similar contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers settled on veteran free agent Steve Blake to be their backup point guard.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 Ridnour has been a backup for most of his seven NBA seasons, but Kahn told him he would have an opportunity to compete with Flynn for the starting job.\n\n“I just want a fair chance to compete … not just to start, but to play,” Ridnour said. “At this point in my career, I’ve been through a lot. I just want to help the team win games. I believe this team is headed in the right direction. There’s a lot of talent here.”\n\nRidnour appeared in all 82 games last season with Milwaukee, averaging 10.4 points, 4.0 assists and 21.5 minutes as the primary backup to rookie standout Brandon Jennings. Ridnour, who played at the University of Oregon, was the No. 14 overall pick in the 2003 draft by Seattle.\n\nPekovic update: Kahn said he’s waiting on 6-11 center-forward Nikola Pekovic to complete a physical before finalizing a contract with the native of Serbia-Montenegro. Kahn said an agreement could be reached next week.\n\nPekovic, a second-round pick of the Wolves in 2008, is eligible to join the Wolves this season after completing his obligations with Panathinaikos Athens in the Euroleague.\n\nPekovic, 24, is ranked seventh by Draft Express among the top 30 foreign players whose rights are held by NBA teams. He averaged 12.9 points and 3.8 rebounds and shot 72.5 percent from the floor last season with Panathinaikos Athens.\n\nOriginally Published: July 20, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
