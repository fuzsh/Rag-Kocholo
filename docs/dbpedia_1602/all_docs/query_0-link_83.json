        "text": "At 8 o'clock on 15 November, as the C384/1 train between Kunming and Mohan of the China-Laos Railway slowly left Kunming Station, it arrived at Mohan, a border port in China, 4 hours and 45 minutes later, marking the official opening of the high-quality Electrical Multiple Unit(EMU) train of the domestic section of the China-Laos Railway.\n\nThe high-quality EMU trains are mainly to support and promote the construction and development of Mohan International Port City, facilitate the travel of business, tourism and public servants in Kunming and Xishuangbanna, and carry out economic and trade exchanges in and out of the China-Laos Economic Cooperation Zone.\n\nIt is understood that the Kunming to Mohan C384/1 C386/7 high-quality EMU train one-way running time is only about 4 hours and 40 minutes, which is nearly 1 hour shorter than the current train, and the running time is reduced by 20%. Among them, the C384/1 train from Kunming to Mohan departs from Kunming Station at 8:06 and arrives at Mohan Station at 12:51, running for 4 hours and 45 minutes; The C386/7 train from Mohan to Kunming departs from Mohan Station at 17 o'clock and arrives at Kunming Station at 21:44, running for 4 hours and 44 minutes, and the train stops at Mohan Station for more than 4 hours, allowing passengers to have sufficient time for business and official activities, as well as to achieve same-day round trips.\n\nAt the end of May this year, Mohan Town of Xishuangbanna was officially entrusted by Kunming, becoming the first provincial capital city in the country to have a border line. Since the trusteeship, driven by the China-Laos Railway, the construction of the China-Laos Mohan - Boten Economic Cooperation Zone has been in full swing and has made remarkable achievements.\n\nIt is reported that since the opening and operation of the China-Laos Railway, a good situation of passenger and cargo transportation has been formed, and as of the end of October, a total of 8 million passengers have been sent, with an average of more than 23,000 passengers per day, and the highest single day in China is 51,000. With the operation of high-quality EMU trains from Kunming to Mohan, it will better serve the economic cooperation between China and Laos and the construction of Mohan port cities.\n\nKunming Railway Bureau Group aims to offer high-quality train services of China-Laos Railway, and actively provides passengers with safe and comfortable journeys. For example, a lot of effort has been put into the decoration of the train platform, the dining bar and the first-class seat are arranged with the theme of \"peace\", and the peony flowers and Champa flowers, the national flowers of China and Laos, are embellished and integrated with each other. On the way, starting from the needs of passengers, the Service Station was set up in the dining bar car to provide passengers commonly used items such as U-shaped pillows, three-in-one data cables, sewing boxes, reading glasses, moisture-proof mats, and children's (adult) masks, bringing passengers a safer, warmer and more convenient riding experience. The \"Mommy Cabin\" has been set up in No. 6 carriage to provide passengers with children's products such as mother and baby nursing curtains, individually packaged diapers of different models, baby wipes, cotton wipes, disinfectant gel, toys and so on."
