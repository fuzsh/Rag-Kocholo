        "text": "If China can see the multiplier effect that a regional rail network can bring beyond just mere movement of people, goods, services and ideas, ASEAN leaders will need to also understand the potential of coming together to work with China to make this happen as equal partners. The network is also an idea infrastructure for energy, communications, water and many other key strategic resources that will be critical for ASEAN to share, protect and nurture we are to not only survive but thrive in the era of the sustainability pivot. We can no longer keep harping the fact that China is a major infrastucture player when ASEAN as an entity represents nearly half of China by population alone. The potential for us to work as equal partners will represent unprecedented prosperity for all. This prosperity can only be brought about if ASEAN act as a unified regional power and abandon any notion of zero sum strategies. Honestly, we can claim to desire industry 5.0 when we think like industry 1.0. ASEAN's real resolve to act as one will be really tested in this era of the global sustainability pivot. My 2 cents. Your views on this matter is appreciated. #ASEAN #China #Railnetwork #Energy #Infrastructure #RegionalProsperity #ZerosumStrategies #Partnership #RegionalSecurity #Utilities #ASEANGrid\n\nVietnam aims to start work on high-speed rail lines to China by 2030 China and Vietnam pledged on December 12 to deepen ties during President Xi Jinping's first visit in six years, as Beijing seeks to counter growing US influence with the communist nation. Vietnam aims to start building two high-speed railway lines linking its capital Hanoi with China before 2030, the Ministry of Planning and Investment said, another sign of a recent warming of ties between the two Communist-ruled neighbors. China is Vietnam’s largest trading partner and a vital source of imports for its manufacturing sector. The two countries are already connected via a system of highways and two railway lines that are old and need upgrading on the Vietnam side. One of the planned high-speed lines would run from Vietnam’s port cities of Haiphong and Quang Ninh through Hanoi to Lao Cai province, which borders China’s Yunan province, the ministry said in a statement released late on Tuesday. The other would run from Hanoi to Lang Son province, which borders China’s Guangxi region, passing through an area densely populated with global manufacturing facilities, including some owned by Chinese investors.\n\nChina's incredible high speed rail network expansion since 2008 \"In the 1990s, there were hardly any subway systems in Chinese cities, but now twenty-five cities have them. China opened its first high-speed rail line to connect Beijing and Tianjin in 2008. Since then, China has spent an estimated $360 billion to build 22,000 km (13,670 miles) of high-speed rail — more than every other country combined — and is expected to add another 15,000 km (9,321 miles) by 2025. This investment has transformed the way Chinese people travel and has had massive economic benefits\" source: https://lnkd.in/dtn_PzfS https://lnkd.in/dPhpn-8q #china #rail #highspeedrail\n\nThailand wants to build a brand new shipping route. Why isn’t China buying? The Land Bridge project, a proposed route for shipping that could bypass the Malacca Strait, is being shopped by the Thai government as it seeks financing If built, the bridge could reshape the economy of Southeast Asia – but China has not shown a willingness to put up the cash -- The latest option to come across Beijing’s desk is the Land Bridge project in Thailand, which uses rail links to connect the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand and bypass Malacca entirely. The project, a replacement for the more controversial and expensive Kra Canal, was brought up by Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin when he attended the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in mid-October. -- “China is not convinced [of what] it can expect from the project,” said Lu Xiang, a senior researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a Beijing-based governmental think tank... “It doesn’t look like an alternative route,” he said, adding offloading and reloading would be complex and may not cut costs to a significant degree. https://lnkd.in/drzXj3Uh\n\nIf the US wanted to show some good cooperation with China on programs to benefit a large number of people, it should consider working with China to ensure that some of the transportation projects of the Belt and Road Initiative are completed. There are some things we can disagree about, but there are others we can cooperate upon. Its a better reflection of the sort of relationship we should have with China. https://lnkd.in/gTK9ikup"
