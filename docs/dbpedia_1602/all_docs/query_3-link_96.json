        "text": "The Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) is a project to create an integrated freight railway network from Europe to Asia. It is part of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.\n\nOverview[]\n\nTemplate:Unreferenced section The project was initiated in the 1950s, with the objective of providing a continuous Template:Convert rail link between Singapore and Istanbul, Turkey, with possible further connections to Europe and Africa. At the time shipping and air travel were not as well developed, and the project promised to significantly reduce shipping times and costs between Europe and Asia. Progress in developing the TAR was hindered by political and economic obstacles throughout the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. By the 1990s, the end of the Cold War and normalisation of relations between some countries improved the prospects for creating a rail network across the Asian continent.\n\nThe TAR was seen as a way to accommodate the huge increases in international trade between Eurasian nations and facilitate the increased movements of goods between countries. It was also seen as a way to improve the economies and accessibility of landlocked countries like Laos, Afghanistan, Mongolia, and the Central Asian republics. Much of the railway network already exists as part of the Eurasian Land Bridge, although some significant gaps remain. A big challenge is the differences in rail gauge across Eurasia. Four different major rail gauges (which measures the distance between rails) exist across the continent: most of Europe, as well as Turkey, Iran, China, and the Koreas use the Template:RailGauge gauge, known as Standard gauge; Russia, and the former Soviet republics use a Template:RailGauge gauge; Finland uses a Template:RailGauge gauge; the railways in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka use the Template:RailGauge gauge, known as Indian gauge; and most of Southeast Asia has Template:RailGauge metre gauge. For the most part the TAR would not change national gauges; mechanized facilities would be built to move shipping containers from train to train at the breaks of gauge.\n\nBy 2001, four corridors had been studied as part of the plan:\n\nThe Northern Corridor will link Europe and the Pacific, via Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, and the Koreas, with breaks of gauge at the Polish-Belarusian border (Template:RailGauge to Template:RailGauge), the Kazakhstan-Chinese border and the Mongolian-Chinese border (both Template:RailGauge to Template:RailGauge). The Template:Convert Trans-Siberian Railway covers much of this route and currently carries large amounts of freight from East-Asia to Moscow and on to the rest of Europe. Due to political problems with North Korea, freight from South Korea must currently be shipped by sea to the port of Vladivostok to access the route.\n\nThe Southern Corridor will go from Europe to Southeast Asia, connecting Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Thailand, with links to China's Yunnan Province and, via Malaysia, to Singapore. Gaps exist between India and Myanmar, between Myanmar and Thailand, between Thailand and Cambodia, between Cambodia and Vietnam and between Thailand and Yunnan. The section in eastern Iran between Bam and Zahedan has been completed. Breaks of gauge occur, or will occur, at the Iran-Pakistan border (Template:RailGauge to Template:RailGauge), the India-Myanmar border (Template:RailGauge to Template:RailGauge), and to China (Template:RailGauge to Template:RailGauge).\n\nA Southeast Asian network; this primarily consists of the Kunming–Singapore Railway.\n\nThe North-South Corridor will link Northern Europe to the Persian Gulf. The main route starts in Helsinki, Finland, and continues through Russia to the Caspian Sea, where it splits into three routes: a western route through Azerbaijan, Armenia, and western Iran; a central route across the Caspian Sea to Iran via rail ferry; and an eastern route through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to eastern Iran. The routes converge in the Iranian capital of Tehran and continue to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.\n\nAgreement[]\n\nThe Trans-Asian Railway Network Agreement is an agreement signed on 10 November 2006, by seventeen Asian nations as part of a United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) effort to build a transcontinental railway network between Europe and Pacific ports in China.[1] The plan has sometimes been called the \"Iron Silk Road\" in reference to the historical Silk Road trade routes.[2] UNESCAP's Transport & Tourism Division began work on the initiative in 1992 when it launched the Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development project.[3]\n\nThe agreement formally came into force on 11 June 2009.[4]\n\nNetwork[]\n\nThe Trans-Asian Railway system will consist of four main railway routes. The existing Trans-Siberian railway, which connects Moscow to Vladivostok, will be used for a portion of the network in Russia.[5] Another corridor to be included will connect China to Korea, Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan.[6] In 2003, the president of Kazakhstan proposed building a standard gauge link from Dostyk (on the Chinese border) to Gorgan in Iran; it has not yet been built.[7]\n\nStandards[]\n\nComplicating the plan is the differences in rail gauges currently in use across the continent. While China, Iran and Turkey use Template:RailGauge tracks, tracks of Russia and Central Asia are gauged at Template:RailGauge. India's and Pakistan's tracks are Template:RailGauge gauge, the tracks of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Malaysia are Template:RailGauge gauge with some dual gauge track near the China-Vietnam border and within Bangladesh, and tracks in Indonesia and Japan are Template:RailGauge gauge.[3] This leads to time consuming interchanges or reloading to handle the break of gauge at main connecting points in the network.\n\nOther standards to consider include allowing for interoperability:\n\nRailway electrification – 25 kV AC the world standard for new long distance and heavy duty construction since the 1950s.\n\nCouplings – buffers and chains, Alliance, or SA3. Some dual couplings and adapters[8] or barrier vehicles are possible.\n\nBrakes – air, with or without electronically controlled pneumatic brakes (ECP).\n\nLoading gauge and structure gauge – able to take tallest possible shipping container. Possible double stacking.\n\nSignalling systems – where signals are electronic, not physically visible, and must be 'read' by equipment in the locomotives, or where the train must interact in different ways with the infrastructure\n\nElectromagnetic interference – where radio waves (noise) from electric motors can interact with different signalling systems\n\nRules and regulations.\n\nLanguage, including Seaspeak.\n\nBreak of gauge devices, such as dual gauge, Train on Train piggybacking or variable gauge axles.\n\nParticipating nations[]\n\nTransportation and railway ministers from forty one nations participated in the week-long conference[9] held in Busan, South Korea, where the agreement was formulated. The proposed 80,900-km railway network will originate from the Pacific seaboard of Asia and end on the doorsteps of Europe. The agreement's cosigners included:[1] (PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES)\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Afghanistan\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Armenia\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Azerbaijan\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Bangladesh\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Belarus\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Bhutan\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Brunei\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Cambodia\n\nTemplate:Flag icon China\n\nTemplate:Flag icon India\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Indonesia\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Iran\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Kazakhstan\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Laos\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Mongolia\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Nepal\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Pakistan\n\nTemplate:Flag icon South Korea\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Russia\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Sri Lanka\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Tajikistan\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Thailand\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Turkey\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Turkmenistan\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Uzbekistan\n\nTemplate:Flag icon Vietnam\n\nTemplate:Div col end\n\nThe 28 countries that did not sign the agreement at the conference had until 31 December 2007, to join and ratify the agreement.[10]\n\nOn 5 May 2007, officials in Bangladesh announced that the nation will sign on to the agreement at an upcoming meeting in New York City. The plan for the network includes three lines between India and Myanmar that traverse Bangladesh.[11] India made a similar announcement on 17 May 2007. As part of the agreement, India will build and rehabilitate rail links with neighboring Myanmar in projects that are estimated to cost more than Template:Indian Rupee29.41 billion (US$730 million).[12] Bangladesh finally signed the agreement on 10 November 2007.[13]\n\nIndia's Look-East connectivity policy has resulted in the launch of several connectivity projects with China and ASEAN nations.\n\nProgress[]\n\nThe Northern Corridor was working already in the 1960s, although at first only for Soviet Union-China trade. The Southern corridor has been opened up after 2000. Successes so far include:\n\nA train ferry across Lake Van, from 1970s allowing rail services between Turkey and Iran.\n\nLink from China to Kazakhstan (Turkestan–Siberia Railway and Lanxin railway, connected in 1990);\n\nLink from Iran to Central Asia (Trans-Caspian railway; branch Tejen – Sarakhs – Mashhad, completed in 1996).\n\nLink from Iran to Herat in Afghanistan completed 2013.Template:Citation needed\n\nDirect freight service between Germany and China through Russia, operating from the first decade of the 2000s (reloading of container at break-of-gauge).\n\nThe Eurasia Tunnel connecting European Turkey and Asian Turkey, opened 2013. Before this, there was a freight-train ferry there.\n\nIran-Pakistan: A Bam - Zahedan link, with a break-of-gauge at Zahedan (Pakistan railway uses broad gauge Template:RailGauge and Iran railway uses standard gauge Template:RailGauge). In August 2009 a goods train carrying containers traveled from Islamabad, Pakistan to Istanbul, Turkey; by April 2011, trains were running regularly.[14]\n\nSecond link from China to Kazakhstan (line Zhetigen - Khorgos, completed in December 2011).\n\nAgreement in 2014 between Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia on completing the north-south corridor.[15] The missing link is Astara–Rasht, 167 km. On January 7, 2017, it was announced that construction on this section would start in 2017.[16]\n\nSee also[]\n\nTemplate:Portal\n\nAfrican Union of Railways\n\nAsian Highway Network\n\nBandhan Express\n\nCosmopolitan Railway\n\nIntercontinental and transoceanic fixed links\n\nInternational Union of Railways\n\nJapan–Korea Undersea Tunnel\n\nMaitree Express\n\nNorthern East West Freight Corridor\n\nOne Belt, One Road\n\nTranscontinental railroad\n\nTransmountain railroad\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nThe Trans-Asian Railway\n\nstreamlinesupplychain\n\nRail links between India and China\n\nFuture Southeast Asia - A map of proposed railways in Southeast Asia\n\nAdapter piece\n\nTemplate:Eurasian Land Bridge Template:Use dmy dates"
