        "text": "Perennial Kunming South High Speed Railway International Healthcare and Business City\n\nPerennial Kunming South HSR International Healthcare and Business City is positioned as a one-stop regional healthcare-centric transit-oriented development (âTODâ) to serve the communities in the Yunnan Province. Spanning a total gross floor area (âGFAâ) of approximately 6 million sq ft, this mega TOD comprises two plots of land, which will host eldercare, medical and hospitality components, as well as complementary retail and healthcare-related trades.\n\nStrategic Location\n\nStrategically situated in the Chenggong District where the Kunming Municipal Government is located, Perennial Kunming South HSR International Healthcare and Business City enjoys a privileged location being only 4 km from the bustling city centre, 20 km from the Kunming Central Business District and approximately 25 km from the Kunming Changshui International Airport. It also has excellent rail connectivity to major cities in the Yunnan Province and beyond.\n\nThe development is sited adjacent to the operating Kunming South HSR Station, a key HSR station positioned as Yunnan Provinceâs East Asia and Southeast Asia Transportation Hub. Currently, starting from Kunming South HSR Station, the Yunnan HSR network provides convenient access to most cities in Central Yunnan within an hour and to the surrounding provincial capital cities within two to five hours. HSR trains originating from Kunming South HSR Station are connected to 23 major municipal and provincial capital cities. Kunming South HSR Station is also designated as the gateway station linking East Asian and Southeast Asian countries to various parts of China. It is currently connected to the Vietnam border at Hekou via an approximately 3.5-hour train ride. The China-Laos Railway also connects Kunming with the Lao capital Vientiane.\n\nWith its strategic location, Perennial Kunming South HSR International Healthcare and Business City is well-positioned to capture the emerging demands of domestic and international consumers via the Trans-Asian HSR network.\n\nEldercare Component\n\nThe eldercare component, positioned as Perennial Eldercare Community Kunming, will comprise a 500-unit Perennial Eldercare Home, a 606-bed Perennial Assisted Living Apartment and a 300-bed Perennial Nursing Home/Hospital. The eldercare component is expected to offer comprehensive, first-of-its-kind medical services in Kunming. These services include hydrotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine (âTCMâ), physiotherapy, rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy, and dementia care.\n\nMedical Component\n\nThe medical component, positioned as Perennial International Health and Medical Hub, will house a 500-bed Perennial General Hospital, a 300-bed Perennial Rehabilitation Hospital and a 300-bed Perennial Specialist Hospital.\n\nHospitality Component\n\nThe hospitality component will feature about 2,000 rooms across five 3- to 5-star multi-branded hotels. The five hotels are expected to feature over 26,900 sq ft of flexible MICE facilities for business travellers. These hotels will also offer in-house health and wellness services for medical travellers such as TCM treatment, hydrotherapy and nutrition consultation."
