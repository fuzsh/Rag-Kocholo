        "text": "The Lao-China railway (also known as the Boten-Vientiane railway) is part of six international economic corridors under China’s belt and road initiative (BRI). As part of the BRI, the Vientiane-Boten railway connects Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (PDR) with not only China (and eventually Singapore) but also the entire BRI network. The railway section that connects Kunming in China with Vientiane in Lao PDR is under construction, with plans to build a railway terminal close to export processing zones (EPZs) and the logistics park in Vientiane. The Thai railway section is designed to carry passenger trains on a new high-speed network while moving cargo traffic to the old meter-gauge network, creating potential challenges for transloading goods and passengers. The Lao-China railway aims to create closer trade linkages between not only Lao PDR and China but also between all economies in the BRI, which is expected to lower trade costs and accelerate economic growth and poverty reductio...\n\nISBN 978-92-9257-126-9 (e-ISBN) ISSN 2071-7202 (Print) ISSN 2218-2675 (e-ISSN) Publication Stock No. ABF157656 • The economies of South Asia and Southeast Asia are a bright spot in a fragile world economy. These economies are growing steadily and forging closer economic ties than ever before. However, regional integration between South and Southeast Asia is still relatively limited, hindered by various problems particularly bottlenecks in transport infrastructure. • Road and rail links between Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Thailand—the key land connections between the two regions—are patchy, with belowstandard sections and missing links. In the case of rail transport, these problems are compounded by differences in gauges and rolling stock. Furthermore, seaports in the Bay of Bengal suffer from deficiencies in draft, capacity, operational efficiency, and road and rail access. • Improving the quality of regional transport infrastructure, and adding it where it does not exist, will ...\n\nSoutheast Asia might have its first high-speed rail (HSR) project in the next few years. Located in Indonesia, this project is expected to connect Indonesia's capital Jakarta with the neighboring city Bandung in around 150 kilometers of distance. Proponents and critics have been addressed to this plan but only small amount of research has been conducted to examine HSR's operating system in Asia and Europe and the rate of success of HSR implementation in Indonesia. The objective of this paper is to provide an estimate of the total cost of building, operating and maintaining a HSR with technical characteristics and the supply and demand conditions based on Asia and Europe experiences. Although the calculation formula provides a lower bound to the actual cost, this expression summarizes the critical factors that must be taken into account when analyzing the costs of HSR lines. These include the line length, the number of trains needed to respond to the demand, train capacity, average distance and the corresponding unit costs. This understanding is very important and meaningful for Indonesia's future projects as it will lead to a better analysis of the expected construction and operating costs. Moreover, the number of passengers to be transported that are differentiated by economic and geographic conditions, and becomes the urgently service delivery to the nation people. This paper also provides suggestions and recommendations toward the government in considering the total service community.\n\nCountries of South East Asia (SEA) mainland have shown major concerns on the need to revamp and improve the railway sector within their respective borders specifically and throughout the SEA mainland region collectively. Following the agreement of ASEAN member countries to include the development of railway industry as one of the priority areas under the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2010 (MPAC2010), major constructions are being carried out to improve the facilities and services of rail-based transportation throughout the region. The challenges, however, do not lie in the initial development phase as during the other phases after that, especially, during the penultimate, nearing-of-completion phase.Â With huge amount of money invested during all phases of the developments, the next focus of the sector is to ensure that these development projects will have a positive return of investments (ROI) for all countries involved. This new focus entails the application of prudent busine..."
