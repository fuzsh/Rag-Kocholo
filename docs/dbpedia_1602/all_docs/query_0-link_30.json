        "text": "Seven Asian countries including China have planned to build a railway linking southwest China and Singapore, hopefully to bring prosperity to the area.\n\nThe railway starts from Kunming, capital city of southwest China's Yunnan province, and runs through Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia before reaching Singapore.\n\nThe railway is like a ribbon connecting China and Southeast Asian countries and providing golden opportunities for multi-lateral trade and investment.\n\nChina declared at a recent ASEAN 10+1 meeting that it will invest 5 million US dollars to dredge the upper Mekong River and kick off the railway project in 2003.\n\nThe China Railway Engineering Company will be responsible for building the first section, which is in Malaysia. It will be over 270 kilometers long and cost 1.2 billion yuan (144 million US dollars). It will cut the journey from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore by half.\n\nThree suggested routes\n\nSources from the Planning Department of the Ministry of Railways said, the idea of the Pan-Asia railway was first put forward by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir at the fifth ASEAN summit meeting seven years ago.\n\nMahathir suggested three routes. An eastern route from Kunming through Hekou in Yunnan to Vietnam. The central route from Jinghong in Yunnan to Laos and a west route from Dali to Myanmar.\n\nKunming Railway Director Zheng Jiandong said, \"The Pan-Asia railway is an international railway, which means its plan and construction must have the endorsement of the 10 ASEAN members. Ina recent meeting held in Malaysia, the majority favored the eastern route.\"\n\nThis route measures 5,600 kilometers and Hekou, a city bordering Vietnam will become the focus for the Chinese section of the railway.\n\nLink to contribute to communication and trade\n\nFarmers in Hekou said the railway will help rid them of poverty. More than 600,000 tons of banana and pine-apples rot every year as the result of the slowness and inconvenience of the present railway from Kunming to Hekou.\n\nThe Kunming-Hekou railway is 660.5 kilometers long and was built by the French 100 years ago. It zigzaggs through the mountains in order to transport and exploit China's resources.\n\nThe rail track is one meter wide, narrower than other national standard railways, but conforms to those in Southeast Asian countries.\n\nZheng Jiandong said, \"The narrow railway along mountainous areas has handicapped Yunnan's transportation and trade. It will take 24 hours to travel from Kunming to Hekou. On the other hand, it is indeed time-consuming when workers shift cargo to standard railways and vice versa.\"\n\nIn China's 2.8-billion-US dollar trade with Vietnam, Yunnan only contributes 160 million dollars.\n\nZheng said one feasible plan is to change 142 kilometers of one-meter-wide railway track to standard railway width and construct another 143-kilometer-long standard railway.\n\nAfter completion, the train's speed will rise to 80 kilometers an hour, cutting traveling hours to 9 hours and enhancing the cargo transportation capacity from 4.6 million tons to 200 million tons of cargo.\n\nZhai Kun, an expert on Southeast Asia from the Modern International Relations said, \"China is substantiating its commitment to build a free economic zone with Southeast Asian countries by the railway.\n\n\"China and ASEAN countries are complementary in many fields such as natural and human resources. Bilateral trade between China and Malaysia has risen to 9.4 billion dollars in 2001, 4.2 billion more than in 1999.\n\n\"The Pan-Asia railway will play an important role in communications and trade.\""
