        "text": "Laos has had extremely limited rail investment in the past, with its difficult terrain making it hard to build and operate extensive railways. So this line is the countryâ€™s first high-standard railway corridor in the north of Laos.\n\nAs a result, the project established the Laos railway technical standard system and innovated many major construction techniques for works that included the Yuanjiang River Super Major Bridge that has a high-pier and large-span, friendship tunnel with full face high-content halite strata, and high-filled subgrade in thick soft soil section.\n\nGreat importance was attached to environmental protection during project construction. The railway route bypasses 23 national natural reserves such as Xishuangbanna and Luang Prabang, five tourist attractions, three national forest parks and the main habitat of Asian elephants. So the project was designed to harmonise with the environment along the route."
