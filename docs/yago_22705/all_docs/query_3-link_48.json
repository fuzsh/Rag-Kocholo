        "text": "Nothing against John of Gaunt, but this is low-key an England screw.\n\nLet's start with the war effort that John II would inherit, which can best be summed up by saying that Edward III chose the worst possible moment to die.\n\nThe most recent truce with France was set to expire in a matter of days after Edward III's death and England was on the precipice of launching a major campaign into France. The army had already been mustered and a large navy assembled to shuttle men across the Channel -- and then it had to be called off. Why? Because legally it no longer had any authority to exist. The army had been gathered in the name of Edward III and it had no right to go to war in the name of a dead man. Even if the new King John II wanted the campaign to go ahead as planned, the lords and knights who were to lead this expedition had to be on-hand to facilitate and witness the transition of power. But the men and ships had already been gathered -- and so they had to be paid. This made for an enormous waste of money at a time when the kingdom was already cash-strapped.\n\nBut the problems don't stop there. Just as the army's authority to wage war had lapsed, so too had the diplomatic authority of Edward III's ambassadors. So, with the truce set to expire and the campaign having to be called off, the English had no ability to negotiate an extension of the truce. This gave France an open shot at invasion of English continental territories.\n\nThis above is the situation that OTL Richard II inherited, and that John will inherit in ATL. But John has one big problem abroad that Richard did not: his claim to Castile. John II would be styling himself king of England and of France and of Castile and lord of Ireland. This union of the Plantagenet claims to France and Castile in one man very probably draws the Franco-Castilian alliance even closer together -- and makes the war even more daunting for the English.\n\nThen, on top of this, John II has a number of domestic problems that Richard did not. Off the top of my head:\n\nJohn is a deeply unpopular figure at this point. Indeed, 1377 is probably the lowest point in John's career. He overreacted badly to the Good Parliament's reforms of royal administration, raising a small army to round up and toss a number of the reformers into jail. This was an extremely controversial move that tarred John with a wide swathe of the gentry who made up the commons -- i.e., the body that controls taxation and is now claiming new authority to oversee royal administration. This quite possibly sets up a showdown between the crown and parliament.\n\nThe reformers of the Good Parliament came largely from the retinue of the earl of March. The counter-reformers of the Bad Parliament came largely from the retinue of Lancaster. These parliaments in 1376 and 1377 are arguably the prelude to the Wars of the Roses, as the OTL reform platform was effectively a proxy war over who was in the line of succession after Richard. (The reformers wanted to limit John's powers as Edward's de facto regent and install March in government.) This is a clear indication that March was willing to fight for his right to the crown jure uxoris, which sets him on a collision course with John in a world where Richard dies and John is recognized as heir to the throne.\n\nJohn's opposition to the Good Parliament and his actions in the Bad Parliament had made him a powerful enemy in the church, as William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester (and therefore lord over the greatest ecclesiastical treasury in England), became caught up in the politics of these parliaments and ended up aligned against John. In OTL, Wykeham is pardoned early in Richard's reign, but who I am doubtful John would be so forgiving.\n\nJohn had made enemies in the church of England even before this feud with Wykeham, though. John's support for John Wycliffe in the 70s made him not quite a heretic, but you could say he was \"heretic adjacent.\" One of the country's chief opponents to Lollardy was William Courtenay, bishop of London, who was a major political player both by virtue of the office he held and by his birth (his father was earl of Devon and his mother was daughter of the earl of Hereford, giving him relations throughout the peerage). Courtenay was fiercely devoted to protecting the church's interests and John's support of Wycliffe seems to have come from a belief that the church had acquired too much power in the secular world. OTL Courtenay was part of Richard's regency council and likely one of the figures instrumental in keeping John and Richard's other uncles out of power. His inability to sideline John in ATL would surely set the two up for conflict.\n\nFinally, John had gotten caught up in the messy politics of the London merchant scene, which -- in addition to his terrible relationship with the bishop of London -- had made him broadly unpopular with the local population. (I have to admit that I don't fully understand the messy and partisan nature of the various merchant guilds of 14th century London, but John's problems with the merchants stems from his securing a pardon for one of his tenants, John Pecche, who -- in addition to being one of John's feudal tenants -- was a corrupt fishmonger.) This is no small thing. London merchants had become powerful figures by this point in history and were an important source of crown revenue, as they routinely extended loans to Edward III to finance his campaigns. John II may not be able to tap these men for their money the way his father had or OTL Richard II's regency council did.\n\ntl;dr: John of Gaunt has, by 1377, alienated much of the commons, has a major rival in the peerage (March), has two separate conflicts with major church leaders, and has run afoul of the wealthy merchant class in London.\n\nOn the plus side, John is the wealthiest man in the kingdom, he has an enormous retinue, his brother (Langley) is fiercely loyal to him, and one of his longtime supporters is the archbishop of Canterbury, so he is at least guaranteed a coronation. But I don't think this is enough, tbh. John II faces all the problems OTL Richard II faced while also having to fend off a possible rebellion from March, having to finance a war without the credit of London's merchants, and having poor relations with the church and commons. It is a nightmare scenario. He'd probably need to take several years just to secure his own position as king -- and by that time, France may well have thrown the English off the continent.\n\nI quess that having Henry IV & V awith unquestionable rights to the throne alone should change quite a lot\n\nThere's not going to be a Henry V as we know him. Mary de Bohun is a poor choice of bride for Bolingbroke in a world where he is prince of Wales. In ATL, Mary may end up in a convent without John of Gaunt's intervention, which brings the entire Bohun estate to Thomas of Woodstock. (Or perhaps John II would intervene in ATL to arrange a marriage for Mary to Edward of Norwich? cc: @CaptainShadow)\n\nI think there are two obvious places where John II would look to secure a bride for his son\n\nFrance: John inherits a mess of a war and has a number of enemies in his own kingdom -- he's not in a position to actually prosecute a war in 1377. I think it's most likely that he seeks a French bride to secure a truce, possibly even accepting a token dowry just to buy himself time to deal with his domestic crises. Charles V's daughters both die around his time, and so this will come to nothing if they suffer their same fates in ATL.\n\nNavarre: This is probably the best match for Bolingbroke. Charles the Bad still aspires to the French throne and has territorial ambitions in Castile, making him a possible ally who could also help shore up what remains of Gascony. The problem here is that John would need secure a truce with France without wedding off Bolingbroke and take the time the truce buys him to secure his throne. This could be possible because ...\n\nJohn has three daughters, which gives a huge diplomatic advantage over OTL Richard II.\n\nPhilippa was betrothed to heir of Gaston III of Foix in the mid-70s, but the boy -- another Gaston -- ended up wedding Beatrix d'Armagnac to end the long-running war between Armagnac and Foix. (Young Gaston died in 1382, but I have no idea of what.) I have to wonder whether this match is more appealing to Gaston III in ATL because, if so, the butterflies from this marriage are possibly huge. An English alliance with Foix transforms the situation in Gascony.\n\nElizabeth is guaranteed a more illustrious match than she got in OTL, but I don't know where she'd go off hand. Perhaps she'd be kept strategically unmarried as to keep a possible marriage to Charles VI on the table for some future negotiation?\n\nCatherine is the big one. She could be wed off to Enrique earlier in ATL, as to break the Franco-Castilian alliance and allow John to focus on the war with France. But there are some other, much crazier options for Catherine in ATL:\n\nJohn could try to wed Catherine to John I of Aragon if Martha of Armagnac dies on schedule. This would bring a wealthy and powerful new ally into the war on the English side and create a Barcelona-led Spain, if Aragon can succeed against the Trastámaras in Castile.\n\nJohn could also try to turn his enemies against one another if Catherine stays unmarried into the 80s, and Charles V dies on schedule in ATL. Charles VI was very close with his brother, Louis, and in OTL even tried to carve out an Adriatic kingdom for him. Would ATL Charles VI want a kingdom for his dear brother? And would he be willing to betray his Trastámaran allies, return Aquitaine to the English, and secure Louis a claim to Castile?\n\nThere is also John of Avis. Catherine could be used to secure Avis's claim to the Portuguese throne, depending on if the succession crisis in Portugal plays out as it did in ATL. After Beatriz of Portugal, the next people in line for the throne are Beatriz's uncles, John de Castro and Denis de Castro. But their legitimacy is murky and their claims aren't recognized by Beatriz's father. If you are to believe that the Castro brothers are illegitimate, then the next in line to the Portuguese throne after Beatriz is ... Catherine of Lancaster. (The rightful claim would go up to Alfonso IV's daughter, Maria, who was Pedro the Cruel's mother, and his claim descends to Catherine.) This creates the potential for a Portuguese-led Spain, if Portugal can succeed against the Trastámaras in Castile. (Though I doubt they can.)\n\nIf John II can secure a truce with France, then use the time that buys him to sort out his $#@! in England, and then re-enter the war in a stronger position ... it's an interesting place for England to be. But he's gonna have several long, hard years to get there and I think it's possible France just wins the war outright before he can.\n\nI think it's clear that in this era it would be her husband who is governing her name.\n\nThe only way I could see Philippa to have a chance to claim the throne in the first place, is to have some kind of a deal between their uncles. And all of Edward III's sons quite ambitious guys. She's not Empress Matilda for sure - and Matilda had to strike a deal with Stephen to make her son a king, and didn't have to worry about other male members of House of Normandy.\n\nIf he's King of England, he's probably too busy to go haring off after a foreign crown. Except that of France, of course.\n\nEngland at the time was in no economic shape for another invasion on France. Richard II looked for compromise, and I see nor reason, why John II wouldn't do the same - after all, he supported and helped Richard during Truce of Leulinghem negotionations. But John should be more effective, since 1) he was more skilled diplomat and 2) Unlike his nephew, he wasn't francophile. Of course France could start it, but it's not like they were in such great shape either. So both sides are in need for timr to catch breath, and I think that more pragmatic John II would gladly trade his right to use \"King of France\" title and removal of fleurs-de-lis for some money.\n\nOn the plus side, John is the wealthiest man in the kingdom, he has an enormous retinue, his brother (Langley) is fiercely loyal to him, and one of his longtime supporters is the archbishop of Canterbury, so he is at least guaranteed a coronation. But I don't think this is enough, tbh. John II faces all the problems OTL Richard II faced while also having to fend off a possible rebellion from March, having to finance a war without the credit of London's merchants, and having poor relations with the church and commons. It is a nightmare scenario. He'd probably need to take several years just to secure his own position as king -- and by that time, France may well have thrown the English off the continent.\n\nLike I said - France wasn't in such great shape either, Charles VI was a called mad for a reason, Kingdom was on the brink of civil war pretty much all the time, and France was trying luck in Italy during that time.\n\nJohn II faces all the problems OTL Richard II faced while also having to fend off a possible rebellion from March, having to finance a war without the credit of London's merchants, and having poor relations with the church and commons.\n\nNot exactly \"all of the problems\" as a lot of the problems of Richard were created by him not beign able to rule personally - either because his own age or \"problems\" or lack of kids. There is a reason why in 1390's were affraid of another regency possibility and no clear succesion. Also, John don't have to wory about Duke of Lancaster from obvious reasons\n\nEither way, I think your analysis of John's situation in 1377 is great and excellent \"starting point\". Sure, John will have to deal with some problems, but I still think his situation in 1377 is better than his nephew's OTL, arguably even better than the \"starting\" point of his father. The question is\" How different King John will be from OTL Regent John? It's not so uncommon for kings to reconcile with their fomer rivals and political adversaries - especially if both sides will gain something from it. But there is always a chance that post-coronation his actions will be dicatated by his huge ego boost."
