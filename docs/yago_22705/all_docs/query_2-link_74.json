        "text": "Royal Salute was created in 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nA potent, sophisticated and opulent blend, aged at least 21, this Scotch whiskey is named after the tradition of the 21 Gun Salute, which is fired by cannon from the Tower of London during royal celebrations.\n\nIt represents the perfect marriage of single malt whiskeys â€“ each of which has been individually aged in oak barrels for 21 years.\n\nIt was bottled in British porcelain jars.\n\nTEST RESULTS\n\nMOUTH\n\nFruity, deep and smoky flavors. Royal Salute's first taste brings the subtleties of the nose to life. Sumptuous flavors of sweet orange marmalade infused with fresh pears burst across the tongue. The second aftertaste brings a rich blend of spices and a nut of hazelnuts that have a mouth-filling intensity and then the final heat of masculine smoke notes."
