        "text": "What will you remember on your death bed? “I got great rates on plane tickets to Dallas one time, paid off my mortgage ahead of schedule, and got some nice bargain bubbles for my wedding.” No! You’re going to remember the extraordinary moments! Moments when you felt like you were going to burst with confetti! The Spécial Club bottles from Gaston-Chiquet have always reinforced my reverence for Champagne. Bottles like this remind me that there is divine wine out there. While for most it seems like shooting for the moon, Champagne can reach out and touch the celestial even if it’s only for a moment. Stop saving for a day that will never come and drink something that you’ll always remember. There is wealth that isn’t stored in banks, or funds, but rather in you.\n\n- SD"
