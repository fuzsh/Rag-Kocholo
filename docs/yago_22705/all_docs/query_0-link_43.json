        "text": "Merovingian Kings\n\nThe Salian Frank domination of Gaul began with Clovis (r. 481–511), grandson of Merovech (hence ‘Merovingian’). He defeated the Roman Syagrius at Soisson (486), moved against the Burgundians and married Clotilde (493), the Catholic daughter of the Burgundian Chilperic. Then, Clovis defeated the Alemanni and converted (probably from Arianism) to Catholicism. His baptism in Reims by bishop Remigius (later, St. Rémi) in December 496 marked the beginning of the intimate link between the Church and Merovingian (and later Carolingian) kings. The wealth and authority of the Church increased rapidly following Clovis’ conversion. He is said to have become royally drunk (Vizetelli Reference Vizetelli1882) on wines from vineyards planted by Remigius outside the city walls. Remigius possessed the earliest documented (Nouvion Reference Nouvion2018) vineyards in Champagne.\n\nWith Burgundian support, Clovis moved against the Visigoths in southern Gaul. In 507, he defeated them decisively at Vouillé (near Poitiers). Alaric II was killed during the battle, allegedly by Clovis himself. The Franks went on to plunder Toulouse and then took Bordeaux. Within a few years, the Visigoths permanently left Gaul for Spain. Clovis was the first Frankish king to try to establish a foothold in northern Spain. When that failed, he consolidated his power in Gaul. He accomplished this by killing those of his relatives who might have preferred to remain independent. Clovis eventually established himself in Paris, which remained the capital of Gaul (and then France) except during the reign of Charlemagne. By the end of his reign, Clovis had unified Gaul. His territory included most of France, Belgium, parts of the Netherlands, a wide track of western Germany, and Switzerland. But Burgundy, Brittany, Aquitaine, and the Mediterranean coast of France maintained some degree of independence.\n\nTrouble started after Clovis’ death in 511. For the Franks, the kingdom was not the Roman res publica (‘public thing’) but the personal property of the king. Clotilde insisted that each of Clovis’ four sons got his part. This gave rise to four kingdoms: Austrasia (‘East Land’, German speaking, Ripuarian law) with major cities Reims and Metz; Neustria (‘New Land’, later ‘Francia’, Latin speaking, Salic law), with Paris and Soisson; Aquitania, with Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Poitiers; and Burgundy, with Lyon and Geneva. Divisions of kingdoms among all the male sons of a king became the Frankish norm. This worked as long as each son could conquer new (non-Frankish) territory to secure the wealth he needed to remain in power and give land to each of his sons upon his death. Clovis’ sons tried to conquer new land in Spain and Italy, without success. So they turned on each other (James Reference James1988).\n\nThus, the death of a Frankish king with more than one son was often followed by a civil war, as each son wanted supremacy over his brothers. Kingdoms were subdivided, occasionally merged, while those parts that were used to being more or less independent increasingly resisted subordination to one or the other king. The details are complicated (James Reference James1988) and poorly documented. There were 30 Merovingian kings, most of them in the ‘forgettable’ category. Clothar II briefly re-united the kingdom in 613. His son Dagobert was the last powerful Merovingian king. Following his death in 639, there was a succession of young kings who required a regent for guidance. Some of them died before being able to consolidate power. Since their own children or heirs were very young themselves, executive power permanently shifted from the king to the mayors of the palace, a title comparable to that of prime minister today. This title became hereditary and new kings could not even pick their own mayor. They no longer engaged in the extensive travel required to confirm their authority throughout their lands, resulting in greater local independence. The later Merovingian kings have been labelled rois fénéants (do-nothing kings). In truth, there was not much they could do.\n\nIn 732, the Austrasian mayor Charles Martel defeated a Muslim expeditionary force (moving north from Spain) between Poitiers and Tours. The battle established Charles as the de-facto ruler of the kingdom even though the Arabs maintained a strong presence in Southern Gaul for several more decades (Chebel Reference Chebel2011). Interestingly, the Spanish ‘Chronicle of 754’ refers to Martel’s army as consisting of ‘Europenses’, possibly the first use of this name. The battle of Poitiers revived the interest of the Franks in the now quasi-independent Aquitaine. Martel imposed his authority in the region, but died in 741. His son Pepin (later, ‘the short’) became mayor. In 751, Pepin asked Pope Zachary to recognize that the actual power was in the hands of the mayor and depose the last Merovingian, Childeric III. Zachary agreed and Pepin became the first Carolingian king. The same year, in Italy, the Lombards took Ravenna.\n\nKingdom, Monasticism, and Wine\n\nThroughout the Merovingian period, Gaul experienced near-continuous warfare at one location or another. The population was mostly rural. Society was divided into laboratores (those who work, the overwhelming majority), with a few percent oratores (those who pray) and bellatores (those who fight: the nobility). The limited wine trade involved shipping on rivers. The roads, mostly the old Roman ones, were not maintained and brigandage was common. Travel was dangerous, especially while transporting saleable wares. The production of most goods, including wine, was intended for the local market. Wines, essential everyday food (Garrier Reference Garrier1995), were poured unfiltered into barrels within hours of being pressed. They contained some fruit matter and residual sugars. Such wines were low in alcohol (below 10%), more nutritious than they are today, but also more unstable. They turned sour within months: a one-year-old wine was probably undrinkable.\n\nThe Frankish kings used their own income to pay for the needs of their army. The soldiers themselves were not paid but were guaranteed basic supplies and a share of the loot. Some commanders received land (Pohl Reference Pohl, Webster and Brown1997). This resulted in an armed and landed aristocracy. Small landowners and peasants had to pay all sorts of taxes and fees to use the mill or wine press that belonged to the local lord, bishop, or abbot. There were tolls on services as well as bridges – including for navigating under them. Landowners also had to pay the tithe to the local bishop or abbot. The bishops, usually Gallo-Romans appointed by the king, were the local spiritual and temporal leaders. They collected taxes on behalf of the king and played the role of judges. The law was the local custom. The bishops also organized health care, provided hospitality, and sometimes ordered the construction or repair of defensive walls. If there was a count nearby, he and the bishop would split these tasks among themselves. The dukes, usually Franks, were military commanders in charge of a large territory.\n\nNeither Clovis nor his Merovingian successors were crowned by a pope or bishop: they did not owe their crown to the Church. Instead, the king appointed bishops and abbots, and used the institutions of the Church for political purposes. In return, the bishops and abbots received protection, privileges, and donations of land, including vineyards. Thus, bishops and monasteries accumulated vineyards and wealth. In Bordeaux, the archbishop and the establishments associated with the Church were the principal owners of vineyards. They needed wine for communion which, until the thirteenth century, involved both bread and wine. They were also expected to take care of visitors, travellers, and the sick. All this involved large quantities of wine.\n\nThe Paris region was covered with vineyards, many of which were owned by the Abbeys of St. Germain-des-Prés (south of Paris) and St. Denis (north and within Paris, including the hill of Montmartre). The king owned vineyards on the ‘Ⓘle de la Cité’, but these disappeared in the mid-twelfth century as the city grew. Since the days of Dagobert, St. Denis had a famous fair on October 9, on time to sell the new wine. In the twelfth century, the nearby port-city of Rouen on the Seine became one of the largest wine-trading port in Western Europe.\n\nMonasticism (Melville Reference Melville2016) began in the third century, as hermits in Egypt and Syria started to attract followers. This was a life of isolation, contemplation, and self-sacrifice. The early monastic communities in Gaul such as the one founded by St. Martin de Tours near Poitiers involved eremitical life. A rule for monastic communities by Augustine of Hippo (354–430) focused on chastity, poverty, obedience, and detachment from the world.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, monasticism provided some security. Food was available and someone would take care of you if you were sick. New monasteries emerged, including institutions for women, such as the Abbey of the Holy Cross founded by Queen Redegund (c. 520–587). A monastic revolution (Melville Reference Melville2016; Seward Reference Seward1979) began with Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–547) who led the monastery of Monte Cassino. Benedict’s Rule organized every aspect of monastic life based on chastity, poverty and obedience, with equal time for prayer, work and rest. The concept of working monks was new. Agricultural work included viticulture, as wine was required for Mass. Indeed, since 397, canon law forbade the use of apples or other fruits as substitutes for fermented grape juice: … nec amplius in sacrificiis offeratur quam de uvis et frumentis (Concilium Carthaginienses III, can. 24). After his death, Benedict and his Rule briefly faded from memory and Monte Cassino was destroyed by the Lombards in 577. Benedict and his accomplishments were revived by Gregory the Great (590–604). The Rule of St. Benedict was adopted by many monasteries in the seventh century.\n\nThe Rule (chapter 40) allowed moderate drinking (Seward Reference Seward1979): the daily ration was a hemina of wine. This is about half a pint, roughly the volume associated with the Roman hemina. The second-in-command at a Benedictine monastery was the cellarer described as ‘wise, of mature character, sober, not a great eater, not haughty, not excitable, not offensive, not slow, not wasteful, but a God-fearing man who may be like a father to the whole community’. He was in charge the ‘cellar’ – not a wine cellar but the colder location where food reserves were kept, including the wine barrels. During one of his expeditions in Italy, Charlemagne visited the (rebuilt) monastery of Monte Cassino and obtained a copy of the Rule. He and his son Louis tried to enforce strict adherence to it by all monasteries, with only partial success.\n\nIn Merovingian and Carolingian times, abbeys or monasteries (Melville Reference Melville2016; Seward Reference Seward1979) were established by the king or the nobility. Land and vineyards were given in exchange for prayers to facilitate whatever pesky negotiations with St. Peter might be required when the donor reached the Pearly Gates. The appointed Abbot would often be a close relative to the donor, without involvement from the pope or local bishop. The ‘royal’ monasteries received rich agricultural lands (with serfs attached to it) and benefited from the direct protection of the king. In exchange, they were expected to provide lodging and feed the king with his (usually huge) retinue when he was travelling. They also had to provide military support, often led by the local bishop or abbot in full armour. Monasteries also served as prisons. The king could get rid of an annoying competitor by forcibly shaving his head and locking him up in some distant monastery, never to be heard of again.\n\nAmong many examples of donations (Seward Reference Seward1979), Gontran of Burgundy gave land and vineyards in Dijon to the Abbey of St. Benignus in 587; Duke Amalgaire of Lower Burgundy founded the Abbey of St. Pierre and St. Paul in Bèze with vineyards at Gevrey, Vosne, and Beaune in 629; the Royal monastery of Lorsch, founded in 764 by Pepin the Short, received land and vineyards all over South Germany. These were not just vineyards and agricultural land, but also houses, woodlands, pastures, watermills, serfs, and entire villages. Monasteries sometimes paid the tithe to their bishop, but no other taxes, and often enjoyed free navigation. ‘Franche nef’ was first granted to St. Mesmin, a monastery endowed by Clovis. In 799, Charlemagne granted (Simon Reference Simon1906) free shipping in Rouen to the abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés.\n\nSmall landowners were at a substantial disadvantage. They had to pay the tithe (the best 10% of the crop before harvest) and were the last in line to rent the wine press. They were not allowed to sell their wine until their lord’s wine was sold out. Transporting wines to a market involved fees and tolls. The vineyards owned by the nobility, bishops, or monasteries had no such issues. They had the best grapes and pressed them first. Their wines were better and often had good reputations.\n\nCarolingian Kings, Vikings, and the Division of Europe\n\nIn November 753, Stephen II crossed the Alps to anoint Pepin (the Short) in St. Denis and request his help against the Lombards who threatened Rome. For the first time, the pope crowned a Frankish king, thus establishing the superiority of the Church over monarchs. In 755–756, Pepin led his army into Italy and defeated the Lombards. In Rome, he was presented with a forged document, the ‘donation of Constantine’ (Chamberlain Reference Chamberlin1993), which he approved (Charlemagne later confirmed it). It is not clear if Pepin knew how to read, much less recognize a fake, but his approval gave birth to the Papal States. The pope became a secular leader with a large tax base.\n\nPepin fully exerted his authority and strengthened his hold on power. He invaded Aquitaine in 763 and destroyed many vineyards. He did it again in 766, after which he received oaths of loyalty and hostages. Pepin died in 768, and his kingdom was divided between his two sons: Carloman and Charles (later, Charlemagne). Carloman conveniently died in 771 and Charlemagne (Riché Reference Riché1978; Chamberlain Reference Chamberlin1986) became the sole ruler. He would extend the Frankish kingdom into an empire.\n\nCharlemagne went to war almost every spring. His soldiers were not paid: once in enemy territory, looting was profitable. If resistance was encountered, the soldiers would not hesitate to kill. Parts of Aquitaine, Brittany, and Saxony needed decades to recover from the destruction. Almost every year from 772 to 802, Charlemagne fought the Saxons and other pagan tribes east of the Rhine, finally conquering and forcefully Christianizing Germany all the way to the Elbe.\n\nIn 773–774, Charlemagne conquered the Lombards. In 778, he moved into Spain (without much success) where he suffered his only major defeat when his rearguard was massacred by the Basques at the Roncesvalles pass. His son Louis would ultimately conquer Barcelona from the Muslims in 801. In the east, Charlemagne defeated the Avars in 796 and returned to his capital Aachen with an enormous booty. In Rome, on Christmas Day 800, he was crowned Emperor by Leo III. By the end of his reign, Charlemagne’s empire included Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Austria, Northern Italy, and a part of northern Spain.\n\nIn the late eighth century, Rome had an estimated 20,000 inhabitants, but Paris only about 4,000. About 90% of the population of Gaul was rural. Just as in Merovingian days, the towns were ruled by a bishop appointed by Charlemagne. He also appointed abbots, usually among people close to him. His biographer, Einhard, became the head of six monasteries, which guaranteed him a substantial personal income. Monasteries and bishoprics played important roles as representatives of the king and repositories for food and wine. There was a constant fear of lack of supplies. Floods, droughts, or plagues were common, resulting in famines such as those in 793, 805, and 807. Monks provided medical care and refuge for travellers: the roads were not safe from brigands. Merchants carrying grain, salt, iron, and wine by water on the Seine, Loire, Rhine, and smaller rivers were charged numerous tolls along the way.\n\nCharlemagne reformed the monasteries and tried to enforce the Rule of St. Benedict. He donated much land and vineyards to monasteries. The royal abbey of St. Ricarius in north-eastern France, founded by St. Ricarius in the seventh century, grew considerably when Angilbert, Charlemagne’s son-in-law, became its Abbot. Most famously, Charlemagne gave part of the hill of Corton to the Abbey of Saulieu in 775. The wine produced there became the famed Corton-Charlemagne. In 814, the Benedictine abbey of St. Germain des Prés near Paris owned (Dion Reference Dion2010; Phillips Reference Phillips2016; Seward Reference Seward1979) some 20,000 ha of land with 300 to 400 ha under vines, most of which was leased to tenants. St. Germain des Ores possessed over 30,000 ha; St. Bertin over 10,000; Fulda over 15,000.\n\nCharlemagne encouraged wine production and drunk moderate amount of wine himself during meals, sometimes even sharing his goblet following the Frankish tradition (Dion Reference Dion2010; Riché Reference Riché1978). But he did not approve of excessive drinking in his presence. Yet, most people at the time drank heavily, including abbots and bishops. Theodulf, poet and bishop of Orleans, pointed out: ‘A bishop who keeps his gullet full of wine should not be permitted to forbid it to others. He ought not to preach sobriety who is drunk himself’ (Riché Reference Riché1978). Wine taverns could be found in many locations, sometimes within monasteries, some of which also had their own brewery. ‘Without a doubt, this was an age obsessed with wine’ (Riché Reference Riché1978). The wine accessible to the common people was probably not very good, but it was a safe drink (Garrier Reference Garrier1995). It was nutritious and an integral part of people’s diet. Wine was also used as a cure for all sorts of ailments. But the wine trade remained local, limited to towns accessible by rivers. Viticulture was the most important cash crop but was the privilege of the wealthy. Bishops, abbots, and princes all had carefully tended vineyards. Tenants did the work. They would typically be paid with half the harvest but had to pay taxes on it.\n\nCharlemagne outlived all of his sons but one, Louis. In 813, Charlemagne crowned him co-emperor in Reims, the city where Clovis was baptized. The city would become the regular site of coronation of French kings. The banquets always included generous volumes of local wine. Thus, early on, the wines from Champagne were associated with royalty. Of course, in the days of Charlemagne, they did not resemble today’s sparkling champagne. The wines were praised, but we do not know what they were compared with.\n\nBy the late eighth century, the Viking (Chamberlain Reference Chamberlin1986; Ferguson Reference Ferguson2010) threat appeared. They attacked the monastery of Lindisfarne (Northumberland) in 793. They sacked the monastery of Iona (west coast of Scotland) in 795, 802, 806 and 807, after which the monastery was abandoned. In Carolingian territory, the Vikings attacked the monastery of Noirmoutier (on an island off of Nantes) in 799. Monasteries – wealthy and poorly defended – were obvious and easy targets. Gradually, the Vikings expanded their reach by navigating up rivers, stealing horses when needed, and attacking small towns, then cities. They wanted silver and slaves, but gladly took barrels of wine and other goods as well. Charlemagne was getting old and did not organize a major resistance against this threat. Viking raids continued almost every spring and summer, with increasing frequency. In the 830s and 840s, they established short-term winter settlements instead of returning home. In 841, the city of Rouen was sacked and the monastery of Jumièges burnt.\n\nCharlemagne died in 814. Louis I (the Pious) tried to maintain the Empire, but he was no Charlemagne. He had three children by his first wife: Lothar, Pepin, and Louis (later: the Germanic). Hoping to avoid future inheritance fights, he declared early on how his Empire would be divided after his death: Lothar would get the Emperor title and the bulk of the land, Pepin and Louis would get Aquitaine and Bavaria, respectively. Only Lothar liked this division. The tension among the brothers came to a boil when Louis the Pious re-married and had a fourth son, Charles (later: the Bald). Charles’ territory now had to be carved out of lands already promised to his other three sons. When Pepin died in 838, Louis the Pious decided to give Aquitaine to Charles. But Pepin’s own son expected this inheritance for himself. The civil war exploded at Louis’ death in 840, while the Vikings were sacking many parts of the country.\n\nAfter two years of war, Charles and Louis swore loyalty to each other in Strasbourg (842). The fighting ended with the Treaty of Verdun the following year. The Empire was divided into three parts: Charles the Bald took the west (later: France); Louis the Germanic the east (later: Germany); the imperial title and a thick slice of land between France and Germany went to Lothar. It extended from the Netherlands to Provence and about half of Italy. Dion (Reference Dion2010) claimed that Louis the German specified his ownership of some parcels of land on the west side of the Rhine propter vini copiam (for the culture of the vine), but no copy of the treaty of Verdun has survived.\n\nThis is the period when a community of Benedictine nuns was established at Château Chalon in the Jura (Lorch Reference Lorch2014). It was conceded to the Church in Besançon by Lothaire II in 869. At its prime, would-be novices had to demonstrate 16 degrees of nobility to be admitted. Since the early days of the abbey, the nuns produced wine. They are often credited for producing the first ‘vin jaune’ for which this region is so famous. However, it is not known if, when, or how these nuns created it. The community was permanently dissolved after the French Revolution (some ruins are still visible in the village).\n\nIn the meantime, the Vikings pillaged Nantes (843), attacked Toulouse (844), sacked Paris (845), and St. Germain des Prés (861). They repeatedly attacked Aquitaine, and Bordeaux was virtually abandoned mid-ninth century. Orléans was pillaged in 868. Charles the Bald could not respond fast enough to the multiple Viking raids in different locations. He asked his counts and dukes to maintain military forces and build fortresses against the Vikings. The counts and dukes then kept local taxes and tolls to cover the costs. By the late tenth century, they had become independent, had their own army and castles, considered their title to be hereditary, and appointed abbots and bishops themselves. The king had lost much of his power as well as most of his land and tax base.\n\nIn 845, Charles the Bald paid the Vikings a ransom of 7000 pounds of silver to lift the siege of Paris by drawing from Church treasures as much as fortune has bestowed upon them. The Vikings left. When Louis the Stammerer became king, the Vikings returned. In 885, they again besieged Paris which was heroically defended by Odo of Paris. When Charles the Fat came to the rescue, he did not fight the Vikings as expected but offered them another ransom instead. He was forced to abdicate in 888 and died the following year. Odo (an ancestor of the Capetian) was acclaimed king. After the Siege of Chartres in 911, his successor Charles III (the Simple, a Carolingian) offered to a group of Vikings the land between the mouth of the Seine and Rouen. In exchange, their leader Rollo agreed to end the brigandage, swear allegiance to the king, convert to Catholicism, and defend the Seine from further Viking raiders. Rollo became Count Roland and his land became Normandy (later, a duchy).\n\nThe Viking raids stopped in the 930s. By then, many monasteries had been abandoned after being sacked or destroyed, and the rights of ownership transferred back to the nobility. The old Merovingian and Carolingian monasteries, tools of the king or emperor, no longer existed. The first sign of an independent monasticism appeared in 863: Girard de Vienne founded a monastery on his land under the pope’s authority. The abbot was to be elected by the monks rather than appointed by him or the king. This was new. And then, in 910, William the Pious (duke of Aquitaine) installed monks on his land at Cluny in southern Burgundy and placed this abbey under the authority of the apostles Peter and Paul: it answered directly to the Pope. The last Carolingian of Francia, Louis V, died in 987. The Capetian dynasty took over as Hughes Capet (987–996) was crowned in Reims.\n\nFrom the Year 1000 to the Renaissance\n\nA barrel of wine can work more miracles than a church full of saints.\n\n(Old Italian proverb)\n\nBy the year 1000, the climate had improved and would stay so for three centuries, a period referred to as the medieval warm epoch. The growing seasons became longer and catastrophic weather events less frequent. Better crops meant greater availability of food. The population grew. Market towns became cities. An increasingly wealthy merchant middle-class emerged, thirsty for higher-quality wines. Forests were cut, watermills and windmills constructed. Gothic cathedrals were built. New vineyards were planted near cities (close to markets) and along rivers (for easy access to markets). Large-scale viticulture was developed in Alsace. Universities were created in Bologna, Paris, Oxford, Cambridge, and other cities. The first crusade (1096–1099) established the kingdom of Jerusalem, but later crusades failed to preserve it. They had little impact on the history of wine except for donations of vineyards to monasteries by departing crusaders in exchange for much-needed prayers. Banking and credit became available. Marco Polo visited China. Dante Alighieri wrote the Divine Comedy.\n\nThe early Capetian kings had the support of the Church but little else: they only controlled the Ⓘle-de-France region around Paris, a very small tax base indeed. Dukes and counts often had more land and power than their king, in particular those of Aquitaine, Burgundy, and Normandy. William of Normandy (the Bastard, and then the Conqueror) invaded England in 1066 and became its king. Members of another Norman family, the Hauteville conquered Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, and Roger II was crowned king of Sicily.\n\nThe Capetian kings gradually re-conquered French land from the English. The south was absorbed following the Albigensian Crusade. The concept of France emerged. Cistercian abbeys acquired many prestigious vineyards, especially in Burgundy. The papacy moved from Rome to Avignon. Clement V and then John XXII expanded the vineyards nearby. The Châteauneuf-du-Pape wine has been famous ever since. The centre of the all-important wine trade with England moved from Rouen to La Rochelle, and then to Bordeaux. By 1300, the populations of Paris, Rouen, and Bordeaux were about 200,000, 50,000, and 40,000, respectively, as compared with 45,000 for Rome.\n\nThe calamitous (Tuchman Reference Tuchman1978) fourteenth century began with the onset of the Little Ice Age (Behringer Reference Behringer2015). During the medieval warm epoch, the cereal crops were good-weather plants: wheat, barley, oats, and rye have tall stems and a heavy top. Strong rains and winds break the stems, leaving the cereals to rot on the ground. The Baltic sea froze in 1303–1304 and 1306–1307; the Venice lagoon froze in 1311 and 1323 (it would freeze 30 times until 1800); the vintage in Bordeaux was miserable in 1315; there was a vintage failure throughout France in 1316; 1322 was the coldest winter in memory. A famine of biblical proportions hit Western Europe from 1315 to 1322. And then, the Hundred-Years’ War caused misery in France, especially during the periods of peace, as ‘companies’ of unemployed soldiers pillaged the country. The Black Death (Benedictow Reference Benedictow2006) arrived in 1347. Within a couple of years, it killed more than a third of the population. The plague returned in 1361, and then again in 1369, 1373–1374, 1388–1390… albeit with smaller death rates.\n\nFollowing the Black Death, the population of France dropped from ∼16 million in 1340 to ∼11 million in 1400. This resulted in wage increases as the demand for labour vastly exceeded the supply. Vineyard workers paid 8d (deniers) par day in 1345 received up to 20d in 1350 and 30d later that century. Urgent or difficult work could be paid as much as double that amount (Autrand Reference Autrand2001).\n\nMany areas previously under cultivation (including vineyards) were now used to raise farm animals. Cultivation continued only in the most appropriate locations. In the 1400s, because of increased yields associated with better soils and the availability of manure, the cost of basic food items dropped. For a while, the general population had more available income and consumed greater amounts of expensive foods such as meat and higher-quality wine. By the 1500s, the populationFootnote h of France had rebounded to 16 million or so. It reached about 20 million in 1700 and 28 million by the Revolution of 1789.\n\nIn the mid-1400s, the Renaissance had begun in Florence under the Medici. It would spread throughout Europe and profoundly change the way people view the world. The availability of paper combined with Gutenberg’s invention of movable type allowed the rapid propagation of new ideas. The Ottoman Turks took Constantinople (1453), marking the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Granada fell to Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabelle of Castille (1492), marking the end of Islamic Spain. Later that year, Columbus sailed to the New World, marking the beginning of new European wealth, viticulture in the New World, but also mass African slavery. Medieval Europe was history.\n\nEleanor and English rule in Bordeaux\n\nAt the age of 15, Eleanor (Seward Reference Seward1978; Markale Reference Markale1979) inherited the duchy of Aquitaine from her father, William X. Aquitaine was much larger than it is today, extending from the Loire to the Pyreneans. Eleanor’s guardian, Louis VI (the Fat) married her to his son Louis, and then promptly died. Thus, in 1137, Louis VII began his reign with a young, beautiful wife and a much-enlarged kingdom. But Eleanor, known for her feistiness, did not get along with Louis: she complained about having married a monk. In 1145, she travelled with him on his ill-fated crusade, where Louis justified one of his nicknames: the Incompetent. In March 1152, the marriage of Eleanor and Louis was dissolved on grounds of consanguinity. Two months later, she married Henry Plantagenet who would become Henry II, king of England, in 1154. All of a sudden, the territory of the French king had considerably shrunk while the English crown controlled the north and west of France: Henry II was count of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine – all wine-producing regions. As for Louis VII, the best he ever did was to re-marry and father Philip II (Augustus), who would recover much of that territory.\n\nEleanor and Henry spend their first year together in Aquitaine (Gradis Reference Gradis1888). They ultimately had five daughters and four sons, two of whom would become kings: Richard I (Lionheart) and John (Softsword, a lesser nickname). Henry’s sons rebelled against him about power sharing. Eleanor supported them and ended up confined in various castles for 16 years. By then, France was led by Philip Augustus. Henry died in 1189 and Richard I released his mother from custody. Eleanor governed the Plantagenet empire while he was on crusade and then held for ransom. She later returned to Aquitaine where she died in 1204.\n\nRichard I made Bordeaux the base of his French operations. He issued an ordinance that included severe punishments for the theft of a cluster of grapes: 5s (sous) (a substantial fine) or one ear (a painful loss). This suggests that stealing grapes was a significant problem at the time, and also that viticulture was a business worthy of special protection.\n\nFew Bordeaux wines were exported to England at that time. Most French wines found in England came from Rouen (‘French’ meant produced in the Ⓘle-de-France, along the Seine, and the Marne) while Rhine wines came from Cologne. These wines were sold at the same price: £2 5s per tun (∼900-liter barrel). Light red and white wines from Anjou were shipped on the Loire and made their way to England as well as Paris. These wines were popular (Dion Reference Dion2010; Simon Reference Simon1906; Lavaud Reference Lavaud2010; Higounet et al. Reference Higounet, Etienne and Renouard1973) with Eleanor, Henry, and Richard. Yet, all of them did spend time in Bordeaux and knew its wines. After Richard’s death in 1199, the throne of England was taken by John. He imposed a maximum price on wines sold in England. His edict (Dion Reference Dion2010) listed Poitou, Anjou, as well as ‘French’ wines, but not the wines from Bordeaux or Gascony.\n\nAfter Philip Augustus confiscated Normandy, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, and Poitou, John wasted considerable resources fighting back, without success. The battle of Bouvines (1214), a resounding victory of Philip over John and the Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV, secured the Capetian gains. England was left with just Aquitaine and Gascony. Rouen, until then the most important wine-shipping port to England, lost its tax privileges. The centre of the English wine trade moved to La Rochelle.\n\nHaving raised taxes and then exhausted the treasury while losing most of his father’s possessions in France, John was forced to put his seal on the Magna Carta in 1215. That same year, he ordered 120 tuns of Bordeaux wine for his personal use. That was probably the first large-scale order of Bordeaux wine. But John had little time left to enjoy them. In addition to a strong rebellion by the English nobility, he had to fight a French invasion led by Prince Louis. Few lamented his death in 1216.\n\nIn twelfth-century Bordeaux, the majority of the vineyards and the wine production were centred on the city itself. The vineyards covered just a small portion of today’s Graves.Footnote i Most of them were owned by the Church (especially the archbishop of Bordeaux) and a few wealthy families. The actual work was done by tenants under contract: they kept up to two-thirds of the harvest for their efforts but had pay the tithe on their share, often in wine. The grapes were sold to winemakers who dealt with coopers and merchants. In the end, most people in Bordeaux were directly or indirectly involved in the wine trade. A wealthy bourgeois middle-class emerged. These bourgeois were exempt from some taxes and enjoyed free navigation on the Garonne. Over time, they acquired nearby land and planted their own vineyards, in particular in the swampy but fertile ‘palus’ along the banks of the Garonne. These were drained and planted with vines.\n\nA wine policy, the ‘police des vins’, was established: the wines produced in the ‘haut-pays’ (in practice, any vineyards not owned by the bourgeois or the diocese of Bordeaux) were not allowed within city limits before St. Martin’s day, November 11. After 1373, this date was pushed back to Christmas (Lavaud Reference Lavaud2010; Higounet et al. Reference Higounet, Etienne and Renouard1973). Thus, only local wines were sold in the fall following the harvest. The production from farther away could not reach the market until spring. This policy was ignored when the local harvest was insufficient to satisfy the demand. The ‘haut pays’ wines arriving in the fall were stored in warehouses along the river, outside the city: les Chartrons.\n\nThree taxes (Trabut-Cussac Reference Trabut-Cussac1972) were levied per tun of wine: Grande Coutume (an export tax), Issac, and Petite Coutume. The first two were determined after each harvest: in 1302, 7s 6d for the Grande Coutume and 3s 9d for the Issac. They went up to 16s and 8s, respectively in 1304, but then dropped in 1305. In 1203, John exempted Bordeaux, Bayonne, and Dax from the Grande Coutume. The following year, La Rochelle was also granted this exemption. The Petite Coutume, fixed at 2d1o (obole), applied to wines from the ‘haut pays’: In addition to transport and storage costs, these wines were also charged more taxes. Not surprisingly, only 12 to 20% of the land was under vines in Barsac, Preignac, Sauternes, and other regions (Lavaud Reference Lavaud2010). This was enough for the local needs but not for commercial quantities of wine. Virtually none of Médoc was under vines.\n\nIn 1224, Louis VIII took La Rochelle, Saintonge, Limousin, Périgord, and part of the Bordelais. But Bordeaux resisted and the French army did not cross the Gironde. Since the wines from La Rochelle and Anjou were now French in the eyes of the English king, they could not reach the English market or were taxed at a very high rate. This is when Bordeaux became the most important wine-shipping port to England.\n\nPhilip IV (the Fair) took control of Bordeaux from 1294 to 1303. Following the Auld Alliance (1295), the wine merchants from Scotland, a French ally, were granted privileges. When Aquitaine returned to English rule, Bordeaux enjoyed a golden age in terms of wine trade with England. Edward II ordered 1000 tuns of Bordeaux wines for his coronation in 1307.\n\nIn 1308–1309, some 100,000 tuns of wine were shipped (Harris and Pépin Reference Harris and Pépin2015) to England, three-quarters of which came from Bordeaux. The wines were shipped to London, Bristol, Cork (Ireland), and Hull (Yorkshire). Bordeaux also shipped to the Baltic region, Spain, and Portugal (Phillips Reference Phillips2016). But only about 10,000 tuns were produced by the city’s bourgeois. The rest came from a growing list of towns such as Barsac, Langon, St. Macaire, Cahors, Moissac, Montauban, Dax, and Bayonne. The wines from the north bank of the Garonne (Bergerac, Fronsac, Saint Emilion, etc.) were shipped from Libourne, which exported some 11,000 tuns to London that year. The entire region was engulfed in the wine trade.\n\nA dynastic dispute precipitated the Hundred-Years’ War (1337–1453). The last Capetian, Charles IV, died without a heir in 1328. Philip of Valois (a nephew of Philip IV) and Edward III (a grandson of Philip IV through his mother) claimed the throne. Edward had the stronger claim but with a fatal flaw: he was English. The French nobility argued that the throne cannot be inherited through a woman and chose Philip (VI, the Fortunate). He confiscated Aquitaine in 1337 and the war began. Thanks to a better military organization and technology (the longbow), England prevailed at the battle of Crécy (1346). In 1355–1356, the dreaded ‘chevauchées’ of the Black Prince (Edward’s eldest son, prince of Wales and Aquitaine) devastated the south-west of France: towns, granaries, mills, barns, and haystacks were burned, wine vats smashed, vines and fruit trees cut, bridges destroyed, women and children abused. He won the battle of Poitiers (1356) where he captured John II (the Good). The resulting treaty of Brétigny (1360) saw John II renounce his rights to Aquitaine and Edward III his rights to the crown of France.\n\nEdward’s successor, Henry V, crushed a superior French force at Azincourt (1415) thanks again to the longbow and the lack of unified leadership on the French side. Tensions between the Bourguignons and Armagnacs escalated and Burgundy allied itself with England. The treaty of Troyes (1420) promised the crown of France to the son of Henry V: France almost became English. It took a young woman, Joan of Arc, to turn things around. In 1429, she relieved the siege of Orléans, won at Patay, and brought Charles VII to Reims to be formally crowned, reversing the treaty of Troy. Joan was then captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, and burnt at the stake (1431).\n\nCharles VII re-organized the French administration, established a formal system of taxation and a permanent army under the king’s control. He used canons (for the first time) to defeat the English at Formigny (1450) and Castillon (1453), ending the Hundred-Years’ War. England permanently lost its possessions in France, except for Calais (until 1558). Bordeaux lost its tax advantages with England, starting a long period of sluggish sales. England would soon be devastated by internal conflicts (the Wars of the Roses). The people of Aquitaine and Gascony, used to considerable independence since Clovis, found themselves under the authority of the king of France. The wine trade continued but on a much reduced scale. The next boost for Bordeaux wines came decades later and involved the Dutch.\n\nThe Cistercian Revolution and Burgundy\n\nIn the ninth and tenth centuries, many monasteries were sacked, destroyed, or abandoned (Melville Reference Melville2016). They later rebounded but, at the turn of the Millennium, monasteries had become quite different from what they were under the Merovingians and Carolingians. They were no longer an arm of the monarchy, funded by the crown and led by appointees of the king. Instead, they were under the supervision of local bishops and their abbots were often chosen by the monks themselves.\n\nFor some 500 years, almost all the monasteries had been Benedictines. But in the late eleventh century, the Carthusian (1086) and Cistercian (1098) orders were created, and then the military orders (Hospitallers and Templars) followed by friars (Franciscans and Dominicans). In the twelfth century, the Cistercians dominated the monastic landscape. As far as French wine is concerned, they played the most important role, especially in Burgundy and Champagne.\n\nTheir adventure began when some monks in the wealthy abbey of Molesme (Burgundy) decided on a more austere religious experience, away from comfort. They moved about 100 km south and, in 1098, established the abbey of Cîteaux (Williams Reference Williams1998, Leroux-Dhuys and Gaud Reference Leroux-Dhuys and Gaud1998). The name comes from ‘cistelle’, a reed common to the area. The habit of the new order was made of undyed wool, hence ‘white monks’. The monks spent about eight hours a day working, the rest was prayer and rest. They hired poor lay brothers to help with (and later do all) the hard work: construction, agriculture, and pastoralism (Leroux-Dhuys and Gaud Reference Leroux-Dhuys and Gaud1998). Their third abbot, Stephen Harding, finalized the constitution of the new order, based on a strict interpretation of the Rule of St. Benedict. In 1119, the charter was approved by Calixtus II, officially establishing the Order of Cîteaux: the Cistercians.\n\nAs their number increased, groups of at least 13 (in reference to Christ and his 12 disciples) would leave, find a new location, and start a daughter abbey: the first were La Ferté (1113), Pontigny (1114), Morimond (1115), and Clairvaux (1115). They generated more daughter abbeys. Each abbey was autonomous, financially independent, and had its own abbot, but was annually supervised by its mother abbey. The first abbot of Clairvaux, the very ascetic Bernard (later, St. Bernard), had enormous influence with kings and popes.\n\nThis was a time of strong religious feelings and the Cistercian model attracted many. New daughter-abbeys were built in or near Burgundy and then further out, from Portugal to Russia, from Sicily to Scotland. There were 322 abbeys by 1150, 531 by 1200, 651 by 1250, and 697 by 1300. Concurrently, 158 Cistercian nunneries were founded. This phenomenal growth slowed down with the onset of the Little Ice Age and stopped with the Black Death.\n\nThe Cistercians rarely cleared new land but acquired properties that were already cultivated (Hoffman Berman Reference Hoffman Berman1992). They enjoyed papal privileges such as immunity from local episcopal jurisdiction and exemptions from ecclesiastic tithes. They negotiated with local authorities permissions to travel and move goods toll-free. At a time when salt was a heavily-taxed royal monopoly, they received grants of salt, which is essential for preserving foods and in the diet of animals. Most abbeys had plenty of them: in 1316, Poblet (Catalonia) had 40 horses, 111 cattle, 2,215 sheep, 1,500 goats, 172 pigs… Their manure made fields very productive. The Cistercians acquired mills and wine presses. In 1143, Longpont received a wine press and 100 casks for their wine.\n\nOn the other hand, peasants had to pay tithes to the Church, which decided (just before harvest) which ten percent of the crop it wanted. The lord (who could be an abbot or bishop) had the droit de ban: the right to declare the earliest date for the grape harvest. This often was just after his own vineyards would be harvested. The peasants then had to pay a fee to use their lord’s wine press but they were the last in line to access it, therefore producing late and often oxidized wines. They were not allowed to sell any wine until their lord had sold his own. And then they were charged tolls to transport it. Competing with the Cistercians was daunting.\n\nMany peasants and small landowners found it preferable to donate their land to an abbey and continue to work on it in exchange for guaranteed food and protection. Non-affiliated monasteries and hermitages also joined Cistercian abbeys, sometimes simply to benefit from their tax exemptions. The Cistercian holdings kept growing and growing. By the late thirteenth century, they had profitable ‘granges’. These were large agricultural units with buildings but no church. Clairvaux had eight granges, Morimond 15, Fontfroide over 20… The spectacular Clos de Vougeot itself was a grange.\n\nThe abbeys also received gifts of land and vineyards. The monks of the Abbey of Pontigny were the first to plant Chardonnay in Burgundy. In 1098, Cîteaux received part of the Meursault vineyard from the duke of Burgundy. Its monks also created the famous Clos de Vougeot. The Cistercians acquired vineyards at Meusault (e.g. Perrières), Beaune (e.g. Cent Vignes), etc. The Cistercian nuns (‘Bernardines’) of Notre-Dame de Tart made wine at Bonne-Mares (originally bonnes mères), Clos de Tart, Chambolle-Musigny, and so on.\n\nBy the mid-fourteenth century, the Cistercians owned hundreds of hectares of vineyards in Beaune, Pommard, Nuits, Corton, etc. In the late twelfth century, they were selling wine in bulk and shipping it on rivers using their own barges. By the mid-thirteenth century, wine was openly retailed in monastic precincts, even though no monk was directly involved in the financial transactions. The Cistercians became amazingly wealthy.\n\nThe biggest impact of the Cistercians was in Burgundy and Champagne, but they were also present (Seward Reference Seward1979) in Bordeaux (e.g. Château La Tour Ségur). In 1309, Grandselve (near Figeac) shipped 300 tuns of its wine down the Garonne for sale in Bordeaux. The Cistercians were present along the Loire (Clos de la Poussie is one example) and the Rhône (vineyards in Vacqueyras and Gigondas). They were also active in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and other countries. Cistercian abbeys even produced wine in the north of Poland (Williams Reference Williams1998) albeit just enough for their own needs.\n\nThe Cistercians were not alone. By 1275, the Benedictines of Cluny owned all the vineyards around Gevrey, including the famous Clos de Bèze. Cluny became the biggest landowner in Burgundy. From 1232 to 1246, the wife of Odo II (Duke of Burgundy), donated several vineyards to the priory of Saint-Vivant (dependent of Cluny). This donation added up to a little more than 6 ha of the current Romanée St-Vivant. The priory also received the ‘Cloux (clos) des Cinq Journaux’, now Romanée-Conti. ‘Journaux’ (old French for journées) referred to the area one worker could till or prune in one day (in this case, Cinq Journaux was an area that required five man-days of work). The Carthusians had connections to wine throughout France, especially in Cahors and Châteauneuf-du-Pape. The famous Quai des Chartrons in Bordeaux, where much wine was stored, is named after a Carthusian charterhouse founded in 1383. The Templars had vineyards in Bordeaux (such as Clos les Templiers in Saint Émilion or Château de l’Eglise in Pomerol), along the Loire (Clos des Templiers), and in Champagne. The Carmelites of Beaune owned La Vigne de l’Enfant Jésus. The list goes on. Seward (Reference Seward1979) lists over 100 wine appellations of monastic origin in France.\n\nThe progress achieved by various monks in the art of viticulture and vinification has been poorly recorded (Williams Reference Williams1998, Hoffman Berman Reference Hoffman Bermann.d.), if at all. The Cistercians are often credited with establishing the concept of terroir, Footnote j possibly because Citeaux’s Clos-de-Vougeot was the first large vineyard to be surrounded by a stone enclosure (‘clos’) in 1212. Its grapes were probably vinified separately, producing a wine characteristic of this specific vineyard. But there is no Cistercian document discussing the concept of terroir. The Cistercians returned the marc (leftover in the wine press) to the vineyard as a fertilizer, but they were not the only ones doing it (Seward Reference Seward1979). They built vaulted cellars to store their wine barrels. These may well have been the first wine cellars. They learned to compensate for evaporation by topping off the wine in the barrels (ullage). But who first realized the importance of ullage is also not known.\n\nThe dominant red grape in Burgundy was the ‘Noirien’, also called ‘Morillon’ or ‘Auvergnat’. It became (Phillips Reference Phillips2016) Pinot Noir after 1395. The reason for the name-change is unclear, but ‘pinot’ refers to the shape of the clusters, which is reminiscent of a pine cone (Dion Reference Dion2010) (pomme de pin).\n\nFollowing the plague of 1360, the local wine production was down by 75% relative to its 1350’s level (Berlow Reference Berlow1980). Wine growers planted Gamay, which yields three times as much as the Pinot Noir and matures a couple of weeks earlier. But Duke Philip the Bold did not like it. In 1395, he forbade (Berlow Reference Berlow1982) Gamay in Burgundy in favour of the Pinot Noir. He called the Gamay ‘a very bad and very disloyal plant […] very harmful to human beings’ (Berlow Reference Berlow1982). His order had mixed success, but there is little Gamay today in Burgundy. It is the cultivar further south, in Beaujolais. Note that Philip the Bold most likely referred to the prolific ‘gros Gamay’, less distinguished than the ‘Gamay fin’ in Beaujolais today. Philip the Bold’s grandson Philip the Good and then his son Charles the Bold also emphasized the quality over the quantity of Burgundy wines.\n\nIn 1443, Nicolas Rolin, chancellor of Philip the Good, and his wife Guigone de Salins founded the Hôtel Dieu (Hospices de Beaune) to be run by nuns, the ‘soeurs hospitalières’. The goal was to provide spiritual help to the poor and sick, of which there were many near the end of the Hundred-Years’ War. The first patient was welcomed in January 1452 and the Hospices rapidly filled up. In the large hall for the poor, two patients shared a bed. There were smaller halls offering better privacy to wealthy patients. The institution served the local population until the 1960s.\n\nThe Hospices received many donations: sometimes money, but also buildings, land, as well as vineyards. The first vineyard donation came from a Guillemette Levernier in 1457, and the Hospices still receive occasional gifts today. Over time, the Hospices acquired many prestigious vineyards and produced some of the best wines in Burgundy. Since 1859, they are sold in 288-liter barrels at an annual auction mid-November. The auction now includes 33 red and 17 white ‘cuvées’, each of which consists of a few up to several dozen barrels. The purchaser must bottle the wine in Burgundy bottles and the label must include the geographical appellation as well as the name of the benefactor, such as ‘Beaune 1er Cru, Cuvée Nicolas Rolin’. The Hospices de Nuits-Saint-George were established in 1633 by Guillaume Labye, legal counsel to Louis XIII and have a similar history. Their wine auction (18 cuvées) takes place on the second Sunday of March.\n\nLanguedoc and Châteauneuf-du-Pape\n\nIn the early 1200s, Languedoc was parcelled between the house of Barcelona-Aragon and two families: Saint Gilles (Raymond of Toulouse) and Trencavels. Allegiances were complicated. For example, the Count of Toulouse was the vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor as well as the Kings of France, England, and Aragon for different parts of his lands. Languedoc had been closely related to northern Spain, with many cultural and economic exchanges. Roussillon, part of Catalonia, was ceded to France in 1659. It is possible that this is the period when cultivars such as the Spanish Garnacha (Grenache) and Monastrell (Mourvèdre) arrived in southern France. They now play important roles, especially in Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Languedoc was spoken, a language related to Catalan and distinct from the Langue d’Oil (future French) spoken in northern France. The agriculture involved mostly grain: vineyards were only planted in soils too poor to grow cereals.\n\nAt least one-third of the population was not Catholic but dualist Cathar, with a major centre around the city of Albi. Raymond of Toulouse was tolerant about religion, but the papacy was not: Catharism was a challenge to the authority of the Church and a heresy to be eradicated.\n\nIn 1209, Innocent III initiated a crusade against the Cathars (O’Shea Reference O’Shea2000; Sumption Reference Sumption1978). Philip II, and later Louis VIII and Louis IX, saw this as an opportunity to grab valuable territory along the Mediterranean coast. The war was brutal. Following the treaty of Paris (1229), Languedoc and parts of Aquitaine became French, but the Albigensian Crusade lasted until 1244. By then, Pedro of Aragon was dead, many local people had been killed in war, burnt at the stake, imprisoned, or dispossessed. The Dominicans were in charge of the Inquisition, a Church tribunal created by Gregory XI in 1233 to deal with heresy. With the help of the Franciscans, they ruthlessly eradicated all traces of Catharism in the region by 1321. More importantly for our story, Languedoc was now French. It would become the largest wine-producing region of France.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, the popes did not feel safe in Rome. Some popes only spent a few months in the city, others shunned it altogether. There were violent feuds between local families, such as the Orsini and Colonna. Another problem was malaria in the summer and fall. Rome and the Papal States were often threatened by the armies of the Holy Roman Emperor. And then, Boniface VIII was kidnapped and roughed-up in Anagni (his birth town) by Guillaume de Nogaret, an adviser of Philip IV. Boniface died a short time later, in 1303. Now, the entire Italian peninsula felt insecure.\n\nFor 11 months following Boniface’s death, the cardinals were unable to agree on a new pope among themselves. They ended up selecting an outsider, Bertrand de Got, archbishop of Bordeaux (Clement V, 1305–1314). Upon his elevation to archbishop, his brother had given him a vineyard in Pessac. The wine produced there is still known as Château Pape Clément.\n\nClement V was painfully sick, probably with stomach cancer. He was resting in Poitiers when Philip IV arrested the Knights Templar on Friday, 13 October 1307. They were under the jurisdiction of the pope but Clement was too weak to stand up to the aggressive Philip. In 1309, Clement moved to the Dominican priory in Avignon, population ∼5000. This town was a reasonable choice, not too far from the various centres of power. Clement planted (Mullins Reference Mullins2011) a small vineyard next to the Avignon cathedral and another one on a hill near the fortified town of Châteauneuf-Calcernier, named for nearby limestone quarries (calcaire in French). The local castle had been given to the bishops of Avignon by Frederic Barbarossa in 1157. Philip IV died in 1314. So did Clement V.\n\nThe conclave lasted until 1316. It might still be going on today had not Philip V locked up the cardinals in a Dominican convent and gradually reduced their food rations until they elected a new pope. They chose the 72-years old Jacques Duèze, former bishop of Avignon (John XXII, 1316–1334). Nobody expected him to live until the age of 90. But John was energetic and healthy. He enjoyed the good life and good wines. He held banquets which fed thousands for days. As a bishop of Avignon (1310–1312), he had spent as much time as he could in Châteauneuf. As a pope, he expanded (Mullins Reference Mullins2011) the local vineyards and transformed the castle into a papal residence. He also enlarged and renovated the bishop’s palace in Avignon. John never contemplated returning to Rome. The cardinals, most of them French by then, had built themselves luxury residences in and near Avignon (across the Rhône). By the time John died in 1334, Avignon had become the centre of the Christian world with a population of about 25,000.\n\nJohn was the last pope to fully appreciate Châteauneuf. Over time, the city became more famous for its wines than its limestone. For this reason, in 1892, the city council requested a name change from Châteauneuf-Calcernier to Châteauneuf-du-Pape or Châteauneuf-des-Papes, as both names were used to label the wines (Figure 2). In 1893, the name was officially changed by decree to Châteauneuf-du-Pape.\n\nJohn’s five successors were all French. Some of them spent considerably on the fun life and good wines. Forget poverty and chastity! Jacques Fournier (Benedict XII, 1334–1342) was a former Inquisitor. He started the transformation of the Bishop’s palace into a fortress: the Palace of the Popes. He also moved the papal archives from Anagni to Avignon: the popes were here to stay (Mullins Reference Mullins2011; Renouard Reference Renouard1994). The Hundred-Years’ War began during his papacy.\n\nBenedict’s successor, Pierre Roger (Clement VI, 1342–1352), was a former chancellor of Philip V. He lived a sumptuous lifestyle. He appointed 25 cardinals, of whom 21 were French and at least 10 closely related to him. Avignon became a major banking centre with international merchants, and 11 brothels. The Black Plague hit France in 1348. In the overcrowded Avignon, the death rate was a staggering 75%. The overall death toll in Europe was so enormous that the entire medieval social structure collapsed. It became expensive to find labourers. Serfdom disappeared. Many vineyards were abandoned for lack of workforce.\n\nThe 1352 conclave elected Etienne Aubert (Innocent VI, 1352–1362), cardinal of Ostia. He was old, sick, sober, and fiscally responsible. The latter two qualities were rare among medieval popes. One of the problems he faced was the Hundred-Years’ War, especially the periods of peace when ‘companies’ of unemployed soldiers (under brutal leaders such as Captal de Buch, the Comte de Foix, Matthieu de Gournay, and especially Bertrand Du Guesclin) committed atrocities on the population of France. Many towns paid ransoms to avoid being looted. The companies sacked Burgundy, Normandy, Champagne, and Languedoc. Following the treaty of Brétigny (1360), one company besieged Avignon. Innocent paid them to go fight in Italy, and began the construction of a defensive walls around the city. The second wave of the plague arrived in 1361.\n\nGuillaume de Grimoard (Urban V, 1362–1370) was a Benedictine monk used to an ascetic life. He eventually became a saint. To the dismay of the cardinals, there were no fantastic banquets or luxurious wines. The companies again threatened Avignon. In 1364, Urban issued two Bulls (Cogit Nos and Miserabilis Nonullorum) which excommunicated the companies and granted plenary indulgences to all who died fighting them. He finished the defensive walls around Avignon and taxed wine to pay for it. But Avignon no longer felt safe, while the situation in Rome and the Papal States had stabilized. He considered a return to Rome. His successor, Pierre Roger de Beaufort (Gregory XI, 1370–1376) did just that in 1376, and died there. By then, Avignon was a large city (for the time) with some 40,000 inhabitants (vs. ∼15,000 in Marseilles).\n\nThe papal court in Avignon consumed vast volumes of wine (Renouard Reference Renouard1952) and the cardinals had extensive cellars as well. The first pope, Clement V, drunk local wines. Starting with his successor John XXII, the papal cellars were stocked with wines from Beaune (typically one-third of the total wine expenses), Saint-Pourçain, local wines, and a few luxury wines from distant locations. The annual purchases from Burgundy increased from 10 barrelsFootnote j (∼8000 litres) in 1343 to 72 barrels in 1353. The popes sent special envoys to Burgundy to handle these wine purchases.\n\nThe cost of transportation was substantial. In the case of Burgundy, shipping on the Saône and then the Rhône added about 20% to the cost of wine. A typical ship carried 38 ‘queues’Footnote k and encountered 26 tolls, where the ships could be tied up for days. Wine bribes expedited the formalities. However, long-distance transport over land (Renouard Reference Renouard1952) could more than double the cost of the wine. For example, a delivery of twelve barrels from Saint-Pourçain to Avignon involved ∼175 km over land to Chalon-sur-Saône with ferries across the Allier, Loire, and Bourbince. Such a trip required 13 barrels, carts, horses, and drivers. The wine in the 13th barrel was needed to compensate for losses due to leaks in the other barrels and facilitate the transactions at numerous tolls and the ferries. One also needed a cooper to repair any damage to the barrels caused by bumps on the dirt roads, and a handful of armed guards to prevent theft. Once reaching the Saône, a house had to be rented to store the barrels while waiting for a ship to arrive for the last leg of the journey.\n\nThe Wine Trade with England\n\nThere is evidence (Brown et al. Reference Brown, Meadows, Turner and Mattingly2001) that the Romans planted numerous vineyards, mostly in the southern part of England, and some as far north as Northamptonshire. The tumultuous times that followed the departure of the Roman army from England in the early fifth century make it likely that many of them were abandoned. Indeed, in his Ecclesiastic History of the English People (Bede Reference McClure and Collins2008), the venerable Bede (?–735) mentions the existence of vineyards, but only in a few locations. Viticulture requires long-term investment and extended periods of peace, both of which were in short supply in early England. Small-scale viticulture re-emerged with the first monasteries (Simon Reference Simon1906) and some trade with France occurred in the days of Charlemagne. It involved deliveries of wine to these new monasteries and shipments of wine in exchange for wool and metals. The first indication of a sustained trade, an import tax on French wine, was recorded (Simon Reference Simon1906) in the late tenth century when Aethelred (the Unready) levied a toll of six shillings per ship. The wine trade picked up after 1066 with the arrival of William of Normandy.\n\nIn the mid-twelfth century, England imported French wines from Rouen, Loire wines from La Rochelle, and Rhine wines via Flanders. In 1175, Henry II of England granted (Simon Reference Simon1906) to the merchants of Rouen a shipping monopoly on the Seine. The wines arriving in Rouen were subject to the pontage (bridge duty), the moéson (tax per cask), and then had to be sold to local merchants who did the shipping. Rouen had a large fleet and was active in international shipping, far beyond the trade with England (Brumont Reference Brumont2018).\n\nRouen was not the only city to enjoy a monopoly (Dion Reference Dion2010). Every wine-producing region wanted to keep the market to itself. The wines produced by the bourgeois of Bordeaux were shipped to England every fall, while the wines produced outside Bordeaux proper (‘Haut Pays’) could not even be sold to Bordeaux merchants until late fall. In 1190, the bourgeois of Paris obtained from Philip II the exclusive right to sell and trade wine within the city. In Orléans, a royal decree stipulated that the city gates had to be closed during the vintage. Since the wine presses were inside the city, any outside producer had to pay a tax to reach them. In Burgundy, the import of wines from Côtes du Rhône was simply forbidden.\n\nAfter 1224, Bordeaux dominated the wine trade with England, but did not have a substantial fleet (Brumont Reference Brumont2018). Merchant ships sailed from England in the fall and returned before Christmas with the new wine (‘wines of vintage’). They sailed again in the spring and returned before Easter with the wines produced away from Bordeaux the previous fall (‘wines of rack’: they were racked into new barrels for shipping). The latter wines were subject to the Petite Coutume if the producers were subjects of the king of England, but two or three times more if they were subjects of the king of France.\n\nLife was considerably more difficult for wine-makers in regions without easy access to markets. Their wines required shipping along more than one river or, worse, considerable overland transport. Tolls and fees added to the cost, and some routes were altogether forbidden in order to protect the local production from competition. The wines had to be of exceptional quality in order to be competitive. Despite the fact that the wines from Beaune enjoyed a reputation of excellence, hardly any of them reached England: there were substantial overland transport costs from Burgundy to Flanders or Rouen, with multiple tolls along the way. Since the King of England imposed (Simon Reference Simon1906) a maximum retail sale price, the wines from Beaune were taxed beyond any profit. However, they did make it to Paris: overland to Cravant and then shipping on the Yonne. In 1337, they were taxed (Dion Reference Dion2010) 5s (sous) in Paris, versus 4s for wines from Bordeaux, 2s for those from Auxerre (called ‘Burgundy’ at the time), and 1.33s for ‘French’ wines. Transport costs were even higher for the Arbois wines (Jura). Yet, these were already of high-quality: Philip IV ordered 37 muidsFootnote k (Renouard Reference Renouard1952) of them, in part as a gesture of friendship toward the people of the region.\n\nUpon arrival in England, the wines were charged import duties (Simon Reference Simon1906) and the King used (abused) a privilege called recta prisa: his choice of two tuns of wine from every wine-laden ship arriving at a port where royal officers had been appointed. In 1280, Edward I got 238 free tuns of wine (Simon Reference Simon1906). This rule, the taxes and fees, and the severe restrictions imposed on merchants arriving in London (where and how long they could stay, to whom they could sell, etc.) resulted in smuggling through smaller ports. But that wine had to be transported overland to its final destination.\n\nMerchant ships were also targets for Breton or English pirates (Simon Reference Simon1906). England did not have an organized navy capable of protecting commercial shipping. Piracy grew worse during the Hundred-Years’ War. England reacted by ordering the nobility to provide ships with a crew, archers, and men of arms to attack pirate ships. In return, they could keep the recovered goods. To everyone’s surprise, these armed ships attacked pirates and merchants alike. In response, the merchants organized themselves in convoys. At the beginning of the fifteenth century, the situation became so dire that Henry IV had to send an armed fleet to Bordeaux to fetch wines.\n\nThe largest purchaser of wine in England was the King. He needed large stocks in each of his many residences (Westminster, Clarendon, Windsor, Kempton, Gloucester, Tewkesbury…) not just for himself but for his substantial retinue (hundreds, if not thousands, of people) as well as for the queen’s court, bishoprics, gifts, not to mention wine for his armies in the field. In France, the King was also the largest purchaser of wine (1.5 to 2.0 million litres a year) as he was expected to feed a large number of people, every day. The king’s largest expense was for wines from Beaune, then Saint-Pourçain, ‘Burgundy’, and ‘French’. The nobility also consumed vast volumes of wine. The Duke of Berry, nephew of Charles VI, often hosted several hundred guests. They would drink his wine (Clos de Vierzon) as well as wines from Beaune (12 livres per muidFootnote k ), Sancerre (8 livres), Saint Pourcain (4 livres), and ‘French’ (2 livres).\n\nThe Fine Rolls of Henry III (1207–1272) are full of wine-related issues. Most deal with the purchase of new and the sale of old ‘deteriorating’ wines (one-year old). The short lifetime of wines was due to a lack of understanding of the processes involved in fermentation, poor hygiene (poorly cleaned barrels), and the absence of precautions to prevent the early oxidation (ullage). It was also common to harvest the grapes early (often before full maturity) from fear that the onset of bad weather would ruin the crop. The King’s orders to sell were often accompanied by instructions not to permit the sale of any other wine in the area until all the King’s wines were sold. The growth, cru, vineyard, owner, or specific origin of the wines were not mentioned: the wines were from Gascony or Guyenne (medieval name for Gironde), Poitou, Rhine, and so on. Sometimes, the colour (red or white) was specified. In rare instances, the grape was mentioned (‘Muscadine wine’). In one roll, the king imposed a fine (one mark of gold) on a merchant for delivering a tun of bad wine. In another, he ordered the bailiffs of Canterbury to cause all wines found in the city to be arrested to the king’s use in preparation for his arrival. This must have been highly unpopular.\n\n‘Claret’ was first used (Simon Reference Simon1906) in the mid-thirteenth century. In his Calendar of Close Rolls, Henry III ‘commands the keeper of his wines at York … to deliver … two casks of white wine to make gillyflower and one cask of red wine to make claret’ (Simon Reference Simon1906). Thus, in the mid-thirteenth century, claret had to be ‘made’ and referred to a light-colour blend red and choice white wines, both of which probably came from Bordeaux. The ‘claret’ style must have been popular: in 1295, the wines purchased for the enthroning of Archbishop Robert Wincheslee were: six casks of red (80s per cask, shillingFootnote l ), four casks of claret (73s4d), one cask of choice white (66s), one cask of white for cooking (60s), one butt of malvoisie (80s/pipe), one pipe of Ossey (60s), and 11 aulms of Rhine wine (26s/aulm). In the late-thirteenth century, claret no longer had to be made but was one of several types of wine readily available in casks. It was cheaper than red but more expensive than choice white, consistent with claret referring to a red/white blend. For reasons unknown to me, ‘claret’ later became exclusively associated with red Bordeaux wines. It still is today.\n\nThe French wine trade with England took a nose dive after the end of the Hundred-Years’ War. England entered a tumultuous period, the Wars of the Roses, during which Edward IV prohibited the import of wine from any French province that had once belonged to England. Wine merchants had to prove that their wine was, say, from Spain and not Bordeaux. This was near-impossible if the ship had made a stop in Bordeaux at any time. Some French wines were shipped to England via Cork in Ireland. Smuggling increased, especially through Bristol (Jones Reference Jones2012). This was done almost openly. The ‘searcher’ was the man charged with collecting import/export taxes, and preventing ships from being loaded or unloaded illegally. But he purchased his job from the Lord Treasurer of England, received very low wages, and had to pay deputies out of his own pocket to inspect the ships. The solution was to forget to inspect a ship from time to time, or undercount a cargo – for a bribe of course. Some searchers became very wealthy. In 1495, Henry VII restored the old privileges of English merchants in Bordeaux and the wine trade increased under Henry VIII.\n\nFrom the Renaissance to Phylloxera\n\nI could not live without Champagne. In victory I deserve it, in defeat I need it.\n\n(Sir Winston Churchill (1874–1965))\n\nThe hopeful period known as the Renaissance brutally ended in May 1527 with the sack of Rome (Chamberlain Reference Chamberlin1979) by Spanish, Italian, and German troops of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (he was in Spain during these events). This Catholic-on-Catholic cruelty was just the beginning, as the Spanish Inquisition, Reformation, and Counter-Reformation brought religious violence to most of Europe. While the reasons for territorial, economic, or political wars disappear when the desired goal is achieved, the reason for religious wars always remains. In France, a long period of religious intolerance began with the 1562 massacre of the (Calvinist) Huguenots in Wassy by soldiers of the (Catholic) Duke of Guise. This was followed by the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre (1572) of Huguenots throughout France, with an estimated 10,000 deaths. Many Huguenots fled. A few of them ended up in South Africa where they contributed to the country’s history of wine (Estreicher Reference Estreicher2014).\n\nHenry III, the last Valois, died without a heir in 1589. Henry IV became the first Bourbon king. Famous for showing greater interest in earthly pleasures than theological exactitudes, he switched religious sides a few times and then reduced the religious tensions with the Edict of Nantes (1598). It restored some fundamental religious rights across France.\n\nThe Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648), one of the bloodiest conflicts in European history, started in Central Europe but later engulfed Sweden and France. In 1636, Spanish troops ravaged (Phillips Reference Phillips2016) most of Champagne, Alsace, and Burgundy: they drunk, killed, and destroyed vineyards and wine-making equipment. The war ended with the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), leaving much to be rebuilt and many vineyards to be replanted. But by then, the drinking habits in Germany had changed from mostly wine to mostly beer.\n\nIn 1685, the religiously intolerant Louis XIV (r. 1643–1715) revoked the Edict of Nantes, depriving the French Protestants of all religious and civil liberties. This resulted in economic problems as many Huguenots left France. Louis’ finance minister Colbert promoted mercantilism, encouraged the production of luxury goods, improved roads, and built canals.\n\nFrance was at war for about 160 years between 1635 and 1815. The Franco-Spanish war (1635–1639), war of devolution (1668), Franco-Dutch war (1672–1678), and war of the Reunions (1683–1684) resulted in some territorial gains for France. The Nine Years’ War (1688–1697) was fought for precious nothing. The war of Spanish succession (1701–1715) began after the death of Charles II of Spain and resulted in the treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt: the Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, gained most of Spain’s European possessions while a Bourbon became king of Spain as Philip V. He kept Spain’s American colonies but renounced his rights to the French throne. Next came the wars of Polish (1733–1738) and Austrian (1740–1748) succession. These were again power struggles between Bourbons and Hapsburgs (and their allies). The Prussian invasion of Saxony triggered the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763). By its end, Britain confirmed its colonial and maritime supremacy while France lost nearly all its claims in North America and trading interests in India.\n\nThe impact of these conflicts on wine was a disrupted trade, confiscated wine stocks, and often considerable damage to vineyards and wine-making hardware. Who paid for all these wars? Until the French Revolution, almost all the wealth was in the hands of the tax-exempt higher nobility and clergy. All attempts to impose taxes on them failed. Thus, the enormous cost was passed on to the common people, including those barely able to survive off the land. Further, food supplies were often raided to feed the armies. The economy performed poorly and inflation – accelerated by the large influx of gold and silver from the Americas – caused prices to soar. Grain prices increased five-fold between 1520 and 1600. The hated ‘taille’ tax, levied on the land, primarily affected the peasantry. It increased about eight-fold during that period. The population (Phillips Reference Phillips2016) of France grew from ∼17 million in the early fifteenth century to ∼28 million at the end of the eighteenth century. Nearly 90% of the population was rural. The largest city, Paris, had grown to about 650,000 inhabitants.\n\nMisery was everywhere, a fact duly noted by Jefferson (Gabler Reference Gabler1995; Jefferson Reference Jefferson1784) during his 1787 wine trips. He commented that the over-supply of cheap wine made it impossible for the producers of common wines to scrape a living. Only the famous vineyards were highly profitable: they served the wealthy and powerful. Jefferson predicted that serious social instability was in the making.\n\nThe 1789 Revolution exploded with the storming of the Bastille prison in Paris. This was followed by the Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen, in part inspiredFootnote m by Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence (1776). Then came the Terror (1793–1794) during which any opposition to the Committee for Public Safety was eliminated: the right to life, liberty, and equality applied mostly to those who shared its views. Many thousands were guillotined, many more imprisoned, while others fled the country. Among the guillotined were Elie du Barry (owner of Margaux) and Nicolas Pierre de Pichard (owner of Lafite).\n\nAmong the legacies of the Revolution were the abolition of the nobility and its privileges, and the introduction of religious freedom. France became a secular state: cardinals, bishops, and abbots lost their political influence. Priests became salaried employees of the state. The state seized and sold the estates of the Church (the largest land-owner in France) and of the exiled nobility. This included enormous wine-related possessions, especially in Burgundy and Champagne. New inheritance laws (1793) stated that all children of a marriage should inherit equal shares upon the death of their parents. Over time, this resulted in a parcelling out of vineyards, especially in Burgundy. Today, Clos de Vougeot has about 80 owners. In Bordeaux, the owners set up a system of shareholders for their estates, thus bypassing the succession laws. Many Bordeaux estates remained undivided.\n\nIn 1768, the city-state of Genoa ceded Corsica to France (treaty of Versailles). The following year, Napoleon was born French. He joined the French army and was active during the wars triggered by the Revolution. And then he took power. He modernized the state finances, stopped inflation by introducing the gold Franc, and reformed the legal system. He also started a series of aggressive wars which redrew the political map of Europe. Peace returned after Waterloo (1815). But his wars had caused considerable and long-lasting political instability throughout Europe. Popular discontent led to a wave of revolutions throughout Europe in 1848. Yet, the 1815 to ∼1860 years were a golden age for French wines, especially Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Champagne. By the 1820s, France, the largest exporter of wine in the world, produced about five times more wine than Italy or Spain.\n\nNapoleon III established the Second Empire in 1852. France accelerated its industrial development. Canals were opened and railroads built. They allowed wines from almost any region of France to compete in Paris, the administrative centre. The economic growth was shattered by the Prussians at the battle of Sedan (1870). The brief war with Prussia was followed by a rebellion known as the Commune (March to May 1871), which was brutally suppressed. At the treaty of Frankfurt (1871), France lost Alsace and part of Lorraine (recovered after the First World War) and had to pay enormous war reparations to Prussia. The excise tax on wine and spirits went up by 66%. The domestic sales of Cognac fell by half.\n\nIn addition to politics and wars, the climate played an important role. A wine crop can be ruined by droughts, strong hail (it destroys leaves and fruits), late spring freezes (young buds die and, in extreme cases, the sap freezes causing the vine to crack and die), cold summers (the fruits never mature), excessive rain at harvest time (watery berries, grey rot), various infestations (spiders, caterpillars, fungi, or viruses), and exceptionally cold winters. The Little Ice Age (Fagan Reference Fagan2000) had started in the early fourteenth century. It was characterized by large weather fluctuations and many exceedingly cold winters. The worst ones occurred from 1675 to 1715, during the Maunder Minimum (Behringer Reference Behringer2015), when very few sunspots were observed. The winter (Lachiver Reference Lachiver1988; Gráda Reference Gráda2009) of 1709 followed an already bad 1708 and was exceptionally brutal: ships were trapped by ice in rivers and harbours, rabbits froze solid in their dens, wine froze in cellars and cracked the barrels, and many vines died. Precious little wine was produced that year. The normal annual wine production (Lachiver Reference Lachiver1988) of the abbey of Saint-Denis near Paris was 130 muids. It produced 28 in 1708, 14 in 1709, and only 31 in 1710 because so many vines had died. The extreme weather affected other crops as well: grain was scarce and very expensive; wine, an important (Phillips Reference Phillips2016; Garrier Reference Garrier1995) part of people’s diet, was near-impossible to find. If found, it cost a fortune. People starved. After 1709, many old vineyards were replanted and new ones created, some with high-quality cultivars (such as the Muscadet in the region of Nantes) and others not (the Pinot Noir all but disappeared from the Paris region). A few years later, the production was so high that prices crashed, pushing many into poverty.\n\nBad weather hit France again in the late eighteenth century: many years saw excessive rain, heavy hail, or other problems. The ferocious winter of 1778–1779 caused bread riots and helped trigger the French Revolution. Following the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, 1816 became the ‘year without summer’. It affected the entire world. The industrial revolution, associated with the extensive burning of fossil fuels (charcoal, and then coke and coal) to produce wrought iron and then steel, initiated a period of global warming which continues to this day.\n\nThe period from 1500 to about 1850 was exceptionally rich for wine. Considerable progress was achieved in science and technology, from a better understanding of fermentation and the chemistry of wine to the distillation of wines, the birth of Cognac and Armagnac, and the invention of strong bottles which allowed wines to age gracefully (for the first time since Roman times). The first French noble-rot wines were made in Sauternes and Barsac, and the first modern Champagne was created. Individual wine estates and vineyards gained international recognition. The first classifications were made.\n\nScientific and Technological Developments\n\nFollowing the interest in the arts, sciences, and study of nature brought on by the Renaissance, many practical aspects of winemaking were approached using the scientific method: observations and measurements, followed by experimentation and/or theoretical modelling, leading in turn to new observations and measurements. This led to a quantitative understanding of many aspects of viticulture and vinification, grape diseases and pests, alcoholic and malolactic fermentations, the aging of wine, and other issues. Questions requiring precise answers included which terroirFootnote j is the most appropriate for a specific cultivar? What are the optimum (grape- and location-specific) ways to prune the vine? How to prevent, heal, or control vine diseases, fungi, and pests? What is the nature of fermentation and how to control it? How long should the maceration last? How to clean empty casks so that they can be re-used? How to strengthen weak (low-alcohol) wines or ‘refresh’ wines that are too strong and heavy? How to properly transport and age wines? Scientific and technical contributions came from many scholars (Martin Reference Martin2009).\n\nIn the south of France, long, sunny, and warm growing seasons often produced excessively sweet must, resulting in strong (high-alcohol) wines which lacked finesse. This was partly corrected by the addition of plaster of Paris (gypsum or calcium sulphate CaSO4, a food additive). It enhances the colour, brightness, and acidity of the wine. Plaster powder was sprinkled on the grapes before pressing, or was added to the finished wine. This trick was already known in Roman times but became widely used in the mid-nineteenth century with the arrival of oïdium and then mildiou.\n\nOlivier de Serres (1539–1619) objected to the use of plaster, especially for finished wines (de Serres Reference de Serres1600). It was commonly used until an 1891 law made it illegal to sell and deliver wines containing more than 2 grams of sulphates per litre. The barrels containing plastered wines had to be clearly marked using large letters. Later, wine makers used tartaric acidFootnote n to enhance the acidity of heavy wines. This is still done today.\n\nAntoine Alexis Cadet de Vaux (1743–1828) co-authored (with Chaptal) L’art de faire le vin. This book contained practical advice on the selection of clusters, de-stemming, avoiding CO2 poisoning (released during fermentation), properly washing fermentation vats, etc.\n\nLouis Augustin Guillaume Bosc (1759–1818) studied over 450 cultivars and their relation to the terroir. He advised that growers select the cultivars most suitable to their terroir rather than the most productive ones. He is considered to be a ‘father of ampelography’.\n\nFor centuries, it was common to grow a variety of cultivars in the same vineyard, and then harvest everything at the same time (field blend). In his Oenologie, Ou Discours Sur la Meilleure Méthode de Faire le Vin et de Cultiver la Vigne (1770), Edmé Beguillet (?–1786) argued that one should separate cultivars so that an entire vineyard matures at the same time. This would not be done until most vineyards had to be replanted following phylloxera.\n\nAntoine Baumé (1728–1804) invented the aerometer to measure the density of liquids, thus allowing winemakers to determine the alcohol content of wine or spirits.\n\nPierre-Joseph Macquer (1718–1784) argued against chemical manipulations to hide the bad flavours of wines that begin to turn into vinegar, in particular the use of lead acetate or ‘sugar of lead’ Pb(C2H3O2)2. It imparts sweetness to wine and masks unwanted flavours, but it causes lead poisoning (Nriagu Reference Nriagu1983; Archibald Reference Archibald2020; Needleman Reference Needleman2004; Eisinger Reference Eisinger1982). Lead had been used as an additive for over 3000 years, especially in wines consumed by the wealthier classes. Lead affects the central nervous system (colica pictonum or colic of Poitou), which can be lethal. The link between leaded wine and the colic was already established by Eberhard Gockel in Ulm (Germany) in 1696. Duke Eberhard Louis of Würrtemberg (1676–1733) banned the use of lead in winemaking, imposing the death penalty for violators, but its use continued. Note that lead can also leak into wine from drinking cups (pewter, leaded crystal) or containers (leaded bottles or decanters). Lead was a component of wine capsules into the 1990s. Any white residue around the neck of an old bottle could be lead tartrate and should be wiped out.\n\nThe cooler climate in northern France (Champagne, Chablis) meant late springs and early falls. The grapes were often not fully mature at harvest time and contained too little sugar. Low sugar in the must results in wines with low alcohol content (7 or 8%) and excess acidity. They easily turn into vinegar. The remedy is to add sugar to the must. The Romans used honey, raisins, or boiled must (Fleming Reference Fleming2001). In 1776, Macquer started with low-quality grapes and achieved strong, low-acidity wines by adding a set amount of sugar during the fermentation. Any source of sugar worked: grape must, cane sugar, honey, etc. The process was quantified (Chaptal Reference Chaptal1807) by Jean-Antoine Chaptal (1756–1832) and is now called ‘chaptalization’. Chaptal also argued for separating cultivars in the field and planting them in rows rather than allowing the branches to root randomly.\n\nIt was obvious at that time that sugar plays a key role in fermentation. But how it becomes ethanol was not understood. Antoine Laurent de Lavoisier (1743–1794), a wealthy tax collector with a chemistry hobby, postulated that no element is created or destroyed: fermentation had to be a re-arrangement of the elements in a sugar molecule (glucose) into alcohol (ethanol) and carbonic gas. Louis-Joseph Gay-Lussac (1778–1850) established the famous equation: C6H12O6 → 2C2H5OH + 2CO2. But something had to trigger that reaction.\n\nFrom 1854 to 1862, in Arbois, Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) studied the alcoholic and malolactic fermentations, the bacteria that transforms alcohol into vinegar, the legendary longevity of the vin jaune (Berthaud Reference Berthaud2011), and a number of wine ‘diseases’. He determined that the trigger of the alcoholic fermentation is a living organism: the yeastFootnote o saccharomyces cerevisiae. He also discovered that – as is the case for sherry – the ‘flor’ that develops on the surface of the vin jaune and protects it from the vinegar bacteria also involves yeasts.Footnote o The last word on fermentation belongs to a German chemist, Eduard Buchner (1860–1917). He discovered that it is not the yeast itself but an enzyme inside it that triggers the fermentation. For this, he won the 1907 Nobel Prize in chemistry and hopefully celebrated with properly fermented grape juice.\n\nGlass is an ancient material, but the production of bottles thick and sturdy enough to allow the aging and transport of wine first occurred in England in the 1630s. This was related to the development of powerful furnaces during the industrial revolution. Sir Kenelm Digby is credited with making the first new bottles (Twede Reference Twede2012). They were made of dark (often green) glass and had a capacity of about 750 ml. The first bottles were onion-shaped with a broad base. They were designed to stand and were used to carry wine from a cask to the table. Within a few decades, the importance of laying wine bottles on their side for aging was recognized: this keeps the cork wet inside the bottle and prevents it from shrinking, thus maintaining a good seal. The bottles became cylindrical with a longer neck, similar to modern bottles (Figure 3). Most bottles were the property of the consumer and were personalized with a family seal or the initials of the owner who would get them filled from a barrel by a wine merchant.\n\nThe early bottles were mouth-blown, a slow and expensive process, and then moulded. Whenever possible, empty bottles were collected and re-used. At first, cloth, leather, with or without wax were used to seal a bottle, but these were soon replaced with corks, a material used for sealing amphorae since Etruscan times. The corks were tapered in order to adjust to the variations in the opening bottles. Glass bottles were first used for ports, bubbly champagnes, and other specialty wines. Packaging had to be done carefully in order to minimize breakage. In addition to the cost of bottles, corks, labour, and packaging, the wine had to be free of impurities. This implied racking the barrels and fining the wine with egg whites, isinglass, or gelatin. Bottling properly fined wines allowed them to age gracefully. It also helped minimize counterfeiting and manipulations by merchants, who commonly blended wines from different vintage years, regions, and cultivars in order to ‘improve’ some wines and increase the volume of their best-selling wines. Wine labels were soon printed. But the overwhelming majority of wines were still sold by the barrel. For example, the first documented (Portes Reference Portes2014) sale of Châteauneuf-du-Pape wine in bottles involved just 150 bottles of Château La Nerthe in 1782, the equivalent of maybe half a barrel.\n\nBy the late eighteenth century, bottles had become cheaper and were increasingly used by wine producers. Around 1880, Claude Boucher invented a semi-automatic glass-blowing machine that used compressed air to produce thousands of bottles per day. The first fully automatic and large-scale bottle-making machine was invented by Michael J. Owens in the early 1900s. The ‘Owens machines’ sucked a precise amount of molten glass from a furnace into a mould. His ‘10-arms’ model (1910) produced (Twede Reference Twede2012) an amazing 23 pint bottles per minute and he designed a ‘15-arms’ machine in 1917. The price of bottles plummeted. Many local bottle producers went bankrupt.\n\nDistillation and Distilled Wines\n\nDistillation is a very ancient technique (Forbes Reference Forbes1948). It probably began by simply evaporating water to concentrate less volatile components (such as perfume). Starting in the mid-eighth century under the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad (the famed House of Wisdom), scholars at Islamic centres of knowledge greatly enhanced our understanding of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and chemistry – or rather its ancestor, alchemy – long before any hint of a European Renaissance. Their studies included distillation (Forbes Reference Forbes1948; Cockx et al. Reference Cockx, Meloni and Swinnen2020) as a tool to find ‘fundamental’ substances.\n\nArab and Persian scholars such as Ja’far Al Sâdiq (702–764), Zakariyyā Râzî (854–925), Al-Zahrawi (Albucassis, 936–1031), Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980–1037), or Ibn Rushd (Averroes, 1126–1198) improved the art of distillation and designed alembics (al-anbiq). ‘Anbiq’ was the long tube in which vapours condense by cooling, but the word later referred to the entire apparatus: cucurbit (the pot containing the liquid to be distilled), cap (placed over the cucurbit to gather the vapours), and anbiq. These scholars distilled many liquids, from rose water to crude oil, sometimes performing several successive distillations to achieve higher purity. Originally, al-kohl referred to a fine powder and later to any substance reduced by distillation.\n\nThe distillation of wine or other fermented liquids requires separating a mix of ethanol (evaporates at 78oC) and water (evaporates at 100oC). If the temperature is maintained somewhere in-between, more ethanol than water evaporates. The vapours condensate in the anbiq, and that condensate contains a higher concentration of ethanol than the original liquid. The process can be repeated to achieve ever higher concentrations of ethanol. The maximum that can be achieved by distillation is about 96%.\n\nAl-Kindi was the first (Cockx et al. Reference Cockx, Meloni and Swinnen2020) to discuss the distillation of (date-palm) wine in his Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations (ca. 866). He likely only produced very small amounts of alcohol as the cooling technology was in its infancy. Progress was achieved (Needham et al. Reference Needham, Ping-Yu, Gwei-Djen and Sivin1980; Plouvier Reference Plouvier2008) in Cordoba by Albucassis, who distilled larger volumes of (grape) wine.\n\nThe Arab and Persian writings on the topic were translated into Latin in the mid-twelfth century at the medical school in Salerno (southern Italy) by Matthaeus Platearius, Magister Salernus, and Bartholomew of Salerno. References to distilled alcohol are found in the writings of Salernus, who referred to it as aqua ardens. It was also called aqua vitae (water of life, eau-de-vie in French) because high-purity alcohol was the most powerful antiseptic known and its use to clean infected wounds saved many lives. It was later referred to as quintessence (the fifth element), something fundamental enough to rival earth, water, air, and fire.\n\nThe technology spread fast, and the distillation of (often red) wine was soon done by monks, pharmacists, vintners, and innkeepers in much of Europe. The production of ‘burnt wine’ (gebrannter wein, branwin, later brandewijn in Dutch hence ‘brandy’) was regulated in Nürnberg in the late thirteenth century. The production and medical use of alcohol further spread during the Black Plague, but the production was limited to the local demand. There was simply no market for large volumes of spirits. Further, one suspects that the spirits produced at the time contained too much methanol, making them unfit to drink.\n\nThe commercial distillation for human consumption began in the early sixteenth century. The first evidence of shipments of spirits in the Bordeaux notary registers involves one shipment to Picardie (1513) and a few to the Netherlands (1515) and Ireland (1517). Brumont (Reference Brumont2011, Reference Brumont2014) researched 4000 ship cargos between 1504 and 1570 and found that only six of the shipments included spirits, all in small quantities and most of them destined for Ireland. The first tolls paid for spirits at Øresund (the entrance to the Baltic) were recorded in 1562. Jehan Serazin is recorded as merchant and ‘faizeur d’eau-de-vie’ in the Charente region in 1571.\n\nAt the time, the commercial distillation of wine was promoted (Dion Reference Dion2010, Brumont Reference Brumont2011, Reference Brumont2014) by the Dutch. Unsold wines were distilled because spirits brought a higher profit than vinegar. They were shipped to northern Europe and Baltic countries. They were also used to strengthen weak wines which would then better survive transport by sea. Other fermented liquids were soon distilled as well, leading to the production of specialty spirits and liqueurs: Calvados, Benedictine, Chartreuse, and so on.\n\nIn the early seventeenth century, the demand for spirits, and therefore the production, increased. Around 1620, spirits were produced (Brumont Reference Brumont2014) in the Haut Pays in Bordeaux for the first time. While the wines from the Haut Pays could not be sold to Bordeaux merchants before late fall, spirits could reach the market at any time. Almost 90% of the shipments went to the Netherlands.Footnote p The Grande Coutume registers of Bayonne for the years 1628–1629 show 7307 tuns of wine and 15 pièces of spirits (the pièce was 240 litres at the time, but grew to 500 litres around 1660). In 1631, 46,000 tuns of wine and 2200 pièces of spirits were shipped from Nantes. That same year, 245 alembics were unloaded in Nantes, 235 of which came from the Netherlands. The production and the volume of exports grew fast. The Øresund toll at the entrance to the Baltic showed 800 barrels of spirits in 16"
