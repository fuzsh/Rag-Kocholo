        "text": "Are there hands, just out of frame\n\nthat might dart forward in time to catch them?\n\n“Still Life Moving”\n\nThrough excavation, erudition and exacting detail, Martha Sprackland’s latest collection Citadel is stone-solid and appetizing. Loosely framed by inhabiting the life of Juana de Castilla, Queen of Castile & Aragon (1479-1555), aka La Loca, the book combines daily details of modern life in Madrid with travels through the Iberian peninsula and England. Sprackland has disguised her insightful verse as a time-traveller’s cloak.\n\nMinutiae become a gateway for time travel. Poached eggs, a football game on TV, or ‘bars of autumnal light falling through the curtains,’ can lead to the Oslo Airport or a Medieval Armada or Toxteth. In “A Blow to the Head,” Sprackland enters this citadel of memories, and returns with ‘the end of it,’ a cord in her hand:\n\nMy hand was the key – found her strung\n\nlike a diver – eyes shut, calm and before\n\nthe old world dragged me back I loosed\n\nthe cord from her wrist – woke\n\nback into a different time with the end\n\nof it in my hand.\n\nAnother common transporter is food. Odes to “Cocido Madrileño,” ‘the meats reclining/ in an adoring harem of chickpeas’ and “Pimientos de Padron,” ‘sweetness spreading across the tongue/ and then head to the airport/ for the first flight anywhere but home’ are succulent and inviting. Anthony Bourdain gives a prologue to the poem “God of Larks and Buntings” which is robust with Armagnac and ‘bishoply buttocks’ tending a garden.\n\nIn Citadel, the plights of Juana de Castilla are brought to the present day. Otherwise known as La Loca, she rebelled against her mother Queen Isabella, who established the Inquisition. Questions about where and how to be, and whether to bring more life into this world thread the subtexts together. In both the modern images and the historical re-imaginings, sparks of mental illness as a reaction to repression are constant. Who has what choice? How are our choices portrayed in time? One wonders why La Loca became “the mad one” only after her politically arranged marriage.\n\nI feel in the core,\n\nthat takes my balance —\n\nand just when I’ve\n\nforgotten it could exist\n\nanother egg drops\n\nlike a spent coffee capsule\n\nthrough the body of a machine.\n\n“Anti-Metre”\n\nAlongside minutiae and food, a third transporter is ekphrasis. “The Perfect Wife” is inspired by 19th century paintings of Doña Juana de Castilla hanging at the Prado Museum. The fourth section of the poem ends with these powerful and controversial lines:\n\nTo keep a wet-nurse is adulterous to the husband.\n\nBe as sweet and as interesting as milk.\n\nIn the waiting room of the Catholic clinic\n\nI pick up another leaflet:\n\nGet Married and Be Submissive.\n\nGive her the reward she deserves.\n\nPraise her in public for what she has done.\n\nLiverpool University Press has created a lovely book to hold and Martha Sprackland has filled the pages with sharp, delicious and multi-layered verse. To meld the symbolic with the historic into an interior dreamscape of pain and glory is no easy task. Citadel is elaborate, robust, pleasurable, and built to last."
