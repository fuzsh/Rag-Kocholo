        "text": "Where to after Iona? Having walked across Mull to Iona, I felt the tug of the Outer Hebrides. Having read about the Hebridean Way stretching 300 km from Vatersay in the south to the Butt of Lewis in the far north, this string of islands (all but two nowadays joined by causeways) is both remote and sparsely inhabited and looked captivating. With my friend Andy at my side, it felt like the logical next step from Iona.\n\nA flight on the tiniest commercial plane I’ve ever been on took us from Glasgow to the famous beach airport at Barra, and a bus and taxi deposited us early one morning in Vatersay, the most southerly inhabited island of the archipelago. Dipping our boots in the sea, we fell into step with Ashley, another walker. Past the remnants of a 1943 military plane crash – debris from the Catalina still littering the ground - we crossed into Barra, and began the steepest ascent of the walk up Beinn Tangabhal up boggy and ill-defined paths. The views were breath-taking as we started descending again; deserted white sandy beaches and a turquoise sea. Lunch was enjoyed as I lay back and watched the clouds forming and dispersing overhead. We heard our first – of many - cuckoos and met some lurid yellow sheep; but humans were few and far between. It was good to reach the sanctuary of an excellent B&B in Aird Mhidhinis, a few kilometres from the ferry that would take us over to Eriskay.\n\nUp early, we walked to Ardmhor and caught the 7am ferry across to Eriskay. There were two walkers conversing in French. I used my limited language skills to join in and eventually asked them which part of France they were from. Belgium, came the answer. Eriskay was a 40 minute ferry ride away, and we landed near where the Young Pretender, Bonnie Prince Charlie had made landfall in 1745 to set Scotland ablaze until his eventual defeat the following year at Culloden. We passed the famous Politician pub, named after the SS Politician (immortalised by Compton MacKenzie as the SS Cabinet Minister in “Whisky Galore”). Eriskay ponies wandered freely along the open tracks and roads. McDonald is a common surname here, and children are often named after parents and other family members, leading to the no doubt apocryphal story about two brothers both named Donald McDonald. When challenged, the father retorted that one was named after him, and one after their grandfather. Over the causeway to South Uist and a seemingly empty landscape, with a few scattered houses. The weather began to cloud over and as we approached Daliburgh, the rain arrived. Having acquired lunch at the local co-op (and dinner, and breakfast, and next day’s lunch – next shop 30 miles north) we emerged into bucketing rain and wind. The local church proved an excellent sanctuary for two wet pilgrims as we sat in the grand empty building and tried not to leave crumbs on the polished pews. The afternoon dragged, enlivened by the random kindness of strangers in the shape of a woman driving down a track at one stage and giving us butterscotch sweets to keep us going! From wet, windy and often difficult terrain we emerged many hours later into the welcome sight of the Howmore youth hostel where we cooked pasta and chatted to the other dozen or so inhabitants.\n\nThe path took us across a wild and liminal landscape across islands that cross Loch Druidibeag before emerging onto a road again. The weather remained wet and wild and we had a soggy lunch in a small bus shelter. Past “Our Lady of the Isles” statue, we continued on the road and across the causeway into Creagorry where we could hear lots of Gaelic spoken. Trudging on in the rain we reached the welcome of our B&B near Liniclate.\n\nAfter a good breakfast we set out in sunshine past the Dark Isles hotel and onto the beach where flat and firm sand made the going easy. A jogger told us to look out for golden eagles and otters but we wondered whether she says this to all the tourists! Arriving at Aird and resigned to the detour into the nearby village of Baivanich for supplies we were delighted to meet a dog walker who took us from the path to the shop, waited outside and then returned us to the path – the kindness of strangers again. The path continued along small roads and paths before eventually climbing to the top of Rueval and a trig point. The views were like nothing I’ve seen in the UK before. Many small lochans, glistening in the sunshine with the sea in the distance and a panoramic view of heather, gorse and emptiness. I could have stayed all afternoon, drinking in that view. Eventually, we came down the hillside, into Kyles Flodda and past a new whisky distillery just before the causeway into Grimsay and then again into North Uist where a little further on arrived at out bunkhouse for the night.\n\nUp and immediately off road across the moors. We’d paid to have our packs taken to Lochmaddy and it was liberating to walk with just a day sack. Along stony and grassy paths, the way took us across a vandalised bridge (but still just passable) and suddenly to the upmarket Langais Lodge hotel. Stopping for carrot cake and coffee in the sunny garden, we listened (at least according to Andy’s bird calls app) to goldfinches, chaffinches and a willow warbler. The path then took us above a standing stone circle, attributed to Fionn mac Cumhaill (in English, Finn MacCool, or Fingal). This is believed to date from the second millennium BC. We descended past a Sitka spruce plantation (specially selected to thrive in this normally treeless environment) and past the place where an escaped bear was recaptured in 1985. (A long story involving an Andrex ad). The road led across another causeway and we passed several peat cutters – it looked backbreaking work. The sun and a fresh breeze made for glorious walking weather. Eventually the path dipped into Lochmaddy where we sat and watched the Calmac ferry come and go from the hotel balcony.\n\nThe final day of this trip was a walk to Berneray (from where a post bus, plane, bus, and two trains would eventually deposit us back in York). Weather was sunny and windy, and the landscape had a subtly different pastoral feel to it. An old phone box served as a library cum essentials shop – all of course on an honesty basis. Passing through Trumaisgearraidh some fantastic views of Berneray. Past the old ferry port and into Aird Ma-Ruibje where I fell asleep in the sun. The ferry duly arrived from Leverburgh in Harris and as ever, the public transport worked seamlessly as the small bus connected and drove us back to Benbecula airport.\n\nUp to 2021, the last time in Scotland had been pre pandemic (Jan 2020). I’d watched the boats sweeping in and out of Oban and wondered when I might make the crossing over the water to Mull. Post pandemic turned out to be the answer! It was great to be back in Oban and boarding the Calmac ferry to Craignure. Once ferry had emptied it was strangely quiet and the road quickly narrowed to single track with passing places. Passed Duart castle, ancient home of the Clan Maclean and a few people foraging on the receding tide for oysters. Passed a mussel farm and then waited for the last bus to Fionnphort, watching the play of light on the hills surrounding me.\n\nBus back to same spot the following day and some hail and rain gradually ceded to sunshine. Great views to left over Loch Sguabian and a path threaded its way between high tors on both sides then once again through forest before joining the southern bank of Loch Scridain. Dramatic views opened up every few hundred yards. The occasional car would pass, but apart from that near silence reigned. The only sounds were the lapping of the loch, distant birdsong (and once) a seal honking. The smells were of timber, petrichor and the kelp in the loch. Stopped at Penyghael for my packed lunch and then continued on in warm sunshine for many miles to Bunessan where the Spar had closed promptly at 5pm some minutes before. Less convenience store, more “inconvenience store”. Shout out to the small charity shop however for a great name – “Island Castaways”. Noted one old postbox with Edward VII on it – modern post boxes in Scotland don’t carry the EIIR insignia but simply a logo, following the so called “pillar box wars” of the 1950s (Scots point out that the current monarch is not Elizabeth II as Elizabeth I was only queen of England, whilst Mary Queen of Scots reigned north of the border).\n\nThe last day to Iona was a delight and included deserted lochs, skeletons on bicycles, abbeys, wild swimming from sandy white beaches, ferries and gourmet cuisine… I soon polished off the 6 miles from Bunessan to Fionnphort and caught the ferry to Iona. A small Spar bore witness to the Scottish love of biscuits and next door a craft centre sold many of life’s unnecessities. Still, one doesn’t come to Iona to shop. One comes for the calm that seems to pervade the island – what Archbishop Stephen Cottrell has called “…another still ness, that achieved by the intensity of prayer over many centuries”. The abbey is smaller than I expected, with a tiny hermitage lit only be a few flickering candles. The road north soon peters out and a track led down to deserted white sandy beaches where I swam and sunbathed. Journey’s end!\n\nThe next segment started in Crianlarich after a very early morning train from Glasgow - walking from hotel to train station lots of Glaswegian birdsong at half four in the morning.. A great breakfast at the hotel, while the rain bounced off cars outside. Picked up the West Highland Way and after a few miles a welcome cup of tea in the dry at Strathfillan Wigwam. Into Tyndrum – more tea! Weather pretty miserable by now. Leaving the town I followed the A85 for a few hundred metres before struggling up a hillside where to my relief I found the forestry road marked on my OS map; this swept up and down for a few miles before coming to an abrupt end and forcing me down the hillside back onto the A85. The relentless rain had led to torrents of water everywhere and the small streams were swollen providing some challenges in crossing. Weary and wet I arrived in Dalmally at the wonderful Craig Villa guesthouse run by Taryn & Ewan – so hospitable and welcoming. A train to Loch Awe and a great dinner at the Ben Cruachan Inn and a dram with Taryn & Ewan concluded the evening.\n\nThe following day it was again raining hard and I took a minor road via Stronmilchan to Loch Awe. Stopping briefly at the atmospheric St Conan’s Kirk, the road led on to the Falls of Cruachan and a huge hydroelectric power station. Stopping near Bridge of Awe for more tea and flapjack eventually arrived in Taynuilt and the inn there. Great meal, book and rioja!\n\nThe final day to Oban was a delight. The rain eased off to allow patches of blue cloud and eventually watery sunshine and a tiny deserted ribbon of tarmac led past sheep and highland cattle with mountain views at every turn. Passing odd houses and farms at Bargillean, Duntanachan, Clachadubh and some remarkable standing stones and cairns near Strontoiller I eventually arrived at Oban, journey’s end for this segment. The Calmac ferries drifted in and out to Mull of Kintyre but that would have to wait for another time…\n\nStill walking in the \"wrong\" direction, I left Stirling one afternoon in December 2017. Took time to get going - it was a cold afternoon and the incongruity of a genuine churreria with Spanish doughnuts and proper hot chocolate was too good to ignore - but after a couple of hours arrived in Bridge of Allan where a small cafe provided bacon roll and soup - perfect. From there tiny roads led to Doune home to the Deanston whisky distillery and Doune Castle, which has been used as a filming location for Outlander, Game of Thrones and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In a nice touch, Terry Jones does the recorded voiceover for castle tours. No sign of the killer rabbits though... Walked into the Red Lion - where conversation temporarily ceased - and decided to have dinner at the hotel.\n\nThe following day brought some winds but no snow and, using the head torch for the first half hour, swung onto minor roads. The sun was rising behind me, and I kept spotting the small white rumps of deer disappearing into the trees to the side of the road. Ignoring the temptations of the unexpected gin distillery at Drumbane, I arrived in Callender for lunch and enjoyed half an hour thawing out at the Deli Ecosse run by two friendly ladies who in my mind will always be the Callender girls... Following the disused Oban to Callender railway along the shores of Loch Lubnaig, past the Strathyre log cabins, the birthplace of the outlaw / hero Rob Roy McGregor (1671-1734) and on to the Strathyre Inn whose friendly but opinionated approach divides the Trip Adviser community!\n\nThe following morning was snowy, -1 degree and no heating in the restaurant - the only time I've eaten breakfast indoors in coat, woolly hat and gloves. The path was fantastic - still following the old railway line, over viaducts and through virgin snow that had fallen overnight. Left the trail at Lochearnhead for a Tunnocks and a cup of tea and then met no-one apart from some beaters trying to raise some grouse for the disappointed \"Guns\" in the valley below. Rather than go east to Killin I followed my nose and the map and left the path to cut across country westwards. I stopped at a small hut within which were swinging three freshly shot deer - whether by owners or poachers I shall never know. About half past two I headed down to the road and the small hotel (the Luib Hotel) where I was staying the night. Friendly owner and local shepherds who I enjoyed chatting to, along with the regulation idiot Brextremist propping up bar and blaming EU for decimalisation (1971, two years before we joined EEC) and regulating potato size. Further lamentable diversions from reason continued; his conversation seemed intent on creating as many great oxbow lakes as possible from the river of sanity. A couple of whiskies made for a good night's sleep and the following morning an unremarkable eight miles to arrive at Crianlarich and the train home.\n\nWalking north for a change, I soon exited Edinburgh and found myself on a riverside walk. A cyclist stopped for a chat and found he had walked from Le Puy to Santiago – Spain never far away even in Scotland. Found myself in a leafy part of Edinburgh with landscape gardeners’ vans much in evidence – “Down to Earth” a great name I thought. A stop for a sandwich at Cramond Bridge and then the scenic route to the Forth Bridge which looped through forests and past a luxury hotel. The shore and the small road along the firth was crammed with people wielding binoculars, one of whom gestured towards the opposite shore in Rosyth where the new aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth could just be seen – “£3bn of taxpayers’ money” he informed me. The last few miles I was on reserve tank and glad to arrive at Boness and the Richmond hotel and a good dinner.\n\nThe following day was relentless rain. A mate texted me and asked how wet I was on a score of 1 to 10. About 9 was the answer! To Linlithgow, under a splendid viaduct and then followed river Avon until it joined a canal and a dramatic aqueduct where the towpath seemed just a bit too narrow. The path then unexpectedly led me into the grounds of, and past, Callendar House. I wasn’t anticipating a grade 1 listed building near the centre of Falkirk, still less something that so dramatically fused Scottish baronial with French Renaissance architecture. Rich in history, I found that the marriage agreement between Mary Queen of Scots and the French Dauphin was signed at Callendar House in 1547 and that its chatelaine Lady Anne Livingston gave hospitality to Bonnie Prince Charlie before the Battle of Falkirk in 1746. Unfortunately for her, after his subsequent defeat at Culloden, her husband, the Earl of Kilmarnock, was beheaded for treason.\n\nThe last day of the segment was against the clock (I had a train from Stirling I needed to catch at half one) and took me through minor roads eventually into Stirling and a whisky shop where I chatted to the owner (her other half was currently cycling LEJOG (Lands End to John O Groats – JOGLE is apparently the shorthand for the southbound equivalent) and bought a souvenir before catching train south again.\n\nStepping out from Edinburgh station liked the Walter Scott quote etched onto a window there: “The ae half of the warld thinks the tither daft” - never as true as at that time in the UK. My arrival had coincided with a fun run at which Mo Farah was participating but gradually left the lycra hordes behind and found the cycle path I wanted where the wildlife included squirrels, woodpigeons and seagulls. Exiting Edinburgh was not scenic – grey slabs of housing estates and industrial estates – but eventually broke into the country beyond Musselburgh and a quick sandwich lunch at Mercat followed. Another old railway line led me to Pencaitland and a taxi to Ardiston Manor where I stopped the night.\n\nAn early start the next day took me through West and then East Saltoun and stopped for a welcome tea and scone at La Lanterne Rouge in Gifford – the only walker amid many cyclists. Then a steady climb onto open moorland, with grouse clattering out of the heather to the summit and then a gradual descent into Cranshaws. Passed a huge house which I later learned belongs to Mrs Dulce Packhard, the Brazilian widow of Fred Packard, heir to the Rank Organisation fortune. One of her daughters was a classmate of Princess Eugenie and had been “romantically linked” with Prince Harry… Arrived in Cranshaws after a long walk where I joined “Messy Church” in the Village Hall where I agreed to meet my hosts for the night – the theme was animals and we all enjoyed meeting a racoon, armadillo, skunk, arctic fox, meerkat and snake!\n\nAfter a restful night minor roads led me to the small village of Preston and eventually into Chirnside where I stopped for soup and a whisky (why is Scottish beer so horrible?) and got chatting to a retired paratrooper who regaled me with tales of his career. (Apparently exiting the plane and getting caught in the slipstream is known as a “rivet inspection”).\n\nFollowing day after a great walker’s breakfast carried on to the village of Paxton, home of Eric Liddell’s family. Past the English border – no passport required just yet - crossed the A1 and followed a small footpath down to the Tweed where a bench allowed me to contemplate the river and enjoy the peace. A second-hand bookshop and a quirky art gallery / café provided an enjoyable end to the day.\n\nThe stretch between Berwick and Beal was walked in reverse order (ie south to north) and was marked by hundreds of birds in a huge V overhead and easy walking, sandwiched for most of the day between the sea and the east coast main line through the hamlets – once thriving villages – of Cheswick and Goswick to Berwick which sits exactly on the latitude of 2 degrees west.\n\nI had made the evocative walk across the sands from Lindisfarne following the markers of the Pilgrims' Causeway as far as Beal and the junction with the AI back in July 2014 so this formed my start point one cold and rainy Tuesday in April 2016. Procrastinating in the warm and dry shop with a coffee after the bus has dropped me off, I eventually set off down small lanes to arrive in the drizzle at Fenwick. Passing its deserted (closed) primary school I walked on across fields and then onto a small lane (Dolly Gibson's Lonnen), past Kyloe Woods, (owned originally by Captain C J Leyland, who first planted the Leylandii cypresses which blight so much of suburbia and are named after him). Diverging from St Cuthbert's Way, the path followed led past Swinhoe Lakes and emerged at Swinhoe Farm. Crossing a wide field, the path eventually led down into Belford, where 3 pubs vied for limited custom. I chose the Black Swan, a small pub with the young landlady and her dogs sitting in the lounge. She pulled me a pint and invited me to take my boots off and warm them by the fire - perfect. Continuing on, and across the east coast main line (after requesting permission from Tweedmouth signal box!) and the path inclined upwards taking me past Spindlestone Heughs (some dramatic rocky outcrops) to Spindlestone Ducket (a four storey tower shown on some maps as a disused windmill but more likely an old dovecote; and now a luxury self-catering cottage)! Past the \"Witch and Worm\" (commemorating the ancient local legend where a new lady of the manor turns her step daughter into a serpent...worry not, she receives her comeuppance). A circuitous route round the headland brought me to Bamburgh and finally to Seahouses. As the sun set, some light rain offshore combined to produce a magnificent rainbow and turned the sea coral pink.\n\nThe following day took me along the coast, and through golf courses with views of the Farne Islands to Beadnall and then to Low Newton-on-Sea and the attractive Ship Inn. More golf courses, and a gradual approach to Dunstanburgh Castle, built in the early 14th century by the rebellious Earl of Lancaster (grandson of Henry III). However he was captured and beheaded at Boroughbridge leading a rebellion against Edward II and the castle suffered further damage in the Wars of the Roses - but still hugely impressive. Then a lovely walk across cliff top fields led into Craster, home of the herring / kipper industry in the UK. These I duly sampled at Robsons, where huge quantities are sold, sampled and served in their restaurant with its sweeping views across the bay.\n\nContinuing on one June morning from a sleepy Craster enjoyed the great sea views to my right. Fell into step with two couples, Penny, Sue, David and Lewis and chatted about how walking creates connections with the landscape (and literature – we also talked about how we’d recently passed Embleton, familiar to fans of “The love song of Queenie Hennessey “...) On through Bulmer, home of the distinctive yellow helicopters that provide air and sea rescue across northern England and southern Scotland. Down through footpaths to Alnmouth, described by John Wesley as “a small seaport famous for its wickedness” on account of its smuggling trade. Stopped for a pint overlooking the estuary before wending my way via small footpaths and a stretch along the beach, to Warkworth and its dramatic castle. The hotel bar later was colonised by a large and lively group of ladies of a certain age who kept me captivated with conversation ranging from star signs, the Queen’s habits at Sandringham, risqué birthday presents and the etiquette of comfort breaks.\n\nThe following day took me via grassy paths and tracks back under the east coast main line and eventually to the lovely village of Felton where the excellent Running Fox cafe and the beautiful church provided material and spiritual sustenance. On through resinous forests to lunch at the Anglers’ Arms at Weldon Bridge, and an afternoon of varied countryside (riverside paths, forests, fields and a disused railway line) to Rothbury, a rather smart Victorian town. The path from Rothbury led via Sharps Folly (a job creation project of the local vicar in the eighteenth century) into remote countryside and then into Harwood Forest. Munching my sandwiches at a deserted farm perched on an ancient sheepfold, I reflected on how few walkers I’d seen and the emptiness of Northumbria. Lovely scenery but little else of interest until eventually arrived at Knoweside and a rather damp and unloved hotel where I met Alan, who had apparently been about half an hour behind me all day. The following morning we walked the first 10 miles together in wet weather before going our separate ways. After a long bridleway I eventually emerged onto the path along Hadrian’s Wall and so to St Oswald’s church at Heavenfield. Perched on a hill the church has no electricity, running water and is very exposed to the elements; it is reputed to be built on the site of the battle of Heavenfield in 634. On via a small gated country road to Acomb and then dropped down into Hexham.\n\nFrom Hexham station on a cold but sunny day - an appropriate location as St Wilfrid of Hexham (sometime Bishop of Northumbria) was the first recorded English pilgrim to make the journey to Rome in the late 7th century. Wrapped up against the cold, I climbed out of Hexham, quickly leaving the town behind in a fold of the hills. Underfoot the ice on the grass splintered and cracked underfoot - sometimes as thick as glass after the night's heavy frost. A descent and then another climb through Slaley Forest where the surrounding pines filled the still air with the scent of resin. Abruptly, the forest ended and an ice encrusted path led across bleak and open moorland with the occasional grouse butt the only man-made structures visible. The path eventually carried me down to the beautiful village of Blanchard. In 1165 Blanchland Abbey was founded by Walter de Bolbec, and the current pub and hotel (The Lord Crewe Arms) was built as the Abbot's lodge, guest house, kitchens and the Abbot's dining room; its gardens served as cloisters for the white clad monks. Dissolved in 1539, the monks are commemorated in the village's name, and also the neighbouring church. One of the Sunday Times' best 100 pubs in Britain, it seemed right to stop for a drink in the vaulted and panelled bar. A sign outside promised \"canny bait, propa beer, crackin' fires - muddy boots welcome\" - my sort of pub! A labrador was also lolling about, its owner reminiscing how the pub used to sell Snuffles dog \"beer\" (No really, it's true. \"Snuffle is made with beef or chicken and malt barley extracts, mineral oils, vitamin B and other doggy goodies\") Thankfully it's non-alcoholic. I'm not a dog lover at the best of times but a drunken burping dog sounds great fun.... Munching my sandwiches I walked on across minor moorland roads south east and then east picking up the Waskerley Way along a disused railway and passing the ghost village of Waskerley - now just some picnic benches but in its prime a thriving railway community with a goods station, sidings, a shed for six engines, wagon repair shops, church and school. Past Smiddy Shaw, Waskerley and Hisehope reservoirs, planes taking off from Newcastle airport were clearly identifiable as they climbed, heading south. Then a footpath across fields and a long walk to pick up the A68 for the last couple of miles to Tow Law.\n\nSetting out from Tow Law's town centre (insofar as Tow Law can be said to have one), a short walk took me to Thornley, home to a few houses and a small church - St Bartholomew, built in 1838 to accommodate the growing local population. Hard to believe now with the village population standing at 155.The lectern had a small wooden mouse carved at its base - tell-tale handiwork of Robert Thompson, the \"Mouseman of Kilburn\". A war memorial commemorates three brothers, all sons of the Rev Humphreys, killed in the Great War. His remaining two sons both served and survived. Later, emerging onto a busy main road I spotted a catering van in a layby and stopped for a cup of tea. The amicable couple tending it said they didn't see many walkers and asked where I was going; I briefly explained the walk. \"You're like Forrest Gump!\" the woman exclaimed. Onto a bridleway, disturbing a parliament of rooks as I went (not often one gets to use that collective noun). There were so many that as they rose in the air the trees appeared to smoke. On across fields to emerge at Witton le Wear and its two pubs, both closed for lunch as is traditional. Along by the side of a railway line (freight from Tow Law to Bishop Auckland) and into Bishop Auckland in the now pouring rain. Quick pub stop for shelter rather than beer and then on past \"The Red Alligator\" pub and through Shildon, desperately proud of its part in the birth of the railways. Across footpaths and a rare encounter with that mythical construct, a friendly farmer. He kindly escorted me across a field through some cows and calves and told me a long story about a local lord who'd fought in the Crusades, before telling me to aim for a tree in the far distance. Sure enough, this proved to be the junction of another path I wanted which led south and eventually out to the road from where a short walk took me to Heighington railway station.\n\nFrom Heighington early one morning, heading south, with the familiar sensation of the sun gradually rising on my left. At one point, nettles were so thick that I had to wade through them with arms upstretched, as if dramatically surrendering to someone or something. Past an inquisitive black sheep, and then on through surprisingly open and rolling countryside. I hadn't expected the path three miles from Darlington to be so beautiful. Over the A1 and then a picturesque bridleway led through woods and fields; but once off the footpath onto roads the town (known affectionately as \"Darlo\" to locals) became more intrusive - first past second hand car lots and then past rows of fast food outlets into the unlovely town centre, the main street being a mixture of charity shops, nail bars, pawnbrokers, ethnic grocers and kebab shops together with a huge number of pubs. The \"Glittering Star\" and the \"Golden Cock\" both promised a lustre that was not immediately evident. Underneath the railway and once again due south past a garden full of gnomes and a graveyard for Big Cats (scores of XJ6s in various states of scrappage) led me to Neasham and - for a short distance - the Teasdale Way by the side of the river. Along a minor road that became a farm track and then onto a footpath crossing the Tees (and a large notice warning of the dangers of giant hogweed- who knew!) Through the day, there was the constant accompaniment of combine harvesters as farmers made the most of the sunshine to get crops in. Through Hornby, Appleton Wiske (where I stopped for a picnic earlier acquired) and then Welbury and East Harsley, where a cricket match was in progress. A turn down a minor road east led across the busy A19 and towards Mount Grace Priory, a well preserved 14th century monastery. Up a steep hill, and down a track led me into Osmotherley. Dehydrated and very thirsty, I walked into the Three Tuns and asked for both a pint of beer and a pint of tap water, an action that prompted the senior citizen installed at the bar to pipe up, “Tha doesn't need to dilute it, tha knows. T'brewery have done that already\".\n\nArrived in a deserted Osmotherley early one morning and set out on the Cleveland Way path which rose and fell along narrow paths and forests, past reservoirs and then a 6 mile hike across open moorland to Sneck Yate. One of those mornings that reminds me why I love walking so much. The German film director Werner Herzog – a long distance walker himself - has said that “the world reveals itself to those who travel on foot” and when he is asked for advice by aspirant film makers he replies, “Walk a thousand miles. It’s worth much more than three years in film school”. It was a lovely bonus to find mid-morning \"High Paradise Farm\" run by Ginny which provided tea and freshly baked scones. Other walkers coming in the opposite direction were also enjoying its unexpected presence after a long walk north. I walked off with Chesterton's poetry bouncing round my mind, \"For there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen / Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green\". Along paths and minor roads past isolated farms to Old Byland and then, skirting Rievaulx, to Helmsley. Fortified by a pint of Hobgoblin, on via an appallingly maintained and signposted path to Sproxton and eventually Oswaldkirk and journey's end at the Malt Shovel (shades of Emmerdale Farm...)\n\nOswaldkirk to Hovingham was a brilliant walk, along bridleways and fields to come out in the centre of the village past sheep and sawmill (Now there's a name for a pub). Climbing out of Hovingham, I eventually reached the little village of Terrington where the church was decked out for a wedding the following day between Jonathan Hubery and Anna Louise Savage. The order of service included Pam Ayres' \"Yes I'll marry you my dear\" and the lovely version of \"Somewhere over the rainbow\" by Eva Cassidy, Against the clock now, a rapid pace swept me southwest and down along bridle paths and footpaths to Sheriff Hutton where I made the bus back to York with 30 seconds to spare.\n\nSheriff Hutton felt like a civilised place with a strong village identity - not to mention a wine shop, upmarket deli, lovely church and ruined castle, parts of which date back to the mid twelfth century. Past sheep and across meadows and eventually onto a well-defined track, trees on one side, wheat fields on the other. A path across two footbridges led to Strensall and then led along the Foss towards Haxby. The machine gun fire from the Queen Elizabeth II barracks in Strensall was clearly audible as I passed the church with its poster for world peace. South of Haxby the path crossed the York ring road and drifted down through Earswick and home.\n\nIn January 2014 set out from my front door en route to Canterbury. A pilgrimage is a walk with a goal. There’s a sense in which its focus therefore lies in the future and it was great to have my sights fixed on the next ultimate destination. Even in England on a cold winter's day in the York suburbs felt that surge of wellbeing and excitement that I always associate with being \"on the road\". Initially the route very familiar past Archbishop Holgate's School, Grimston Bar and then through Elvington and Sutton on Derwent where shortly after crossing the Derwent (the boundary between North & East Yorks) I stopped at the ancient village church of St Michael & All Angels. John Betjeman once said \"that every church I've passed I've wanted to stop and look in.\" and small country churches are endlessly fascinating; this one remembering the village's association with the St Vincent family (John Jervis, Admiral of the Fleet, First Earl of St Vincent will be familiar to all fans of C S Forester's \"Hornblower\" series). I was reminded of a comment by Bill Bryson to the effect that we undervalue our cultural heritage. He observed how remarkable it is that you could stick a pin in a map of the UK and find within a 5 mile radius that someone famous had been born there, or something remarkable invented, or a significant event had taken place there.; \"You just can't do that in Iowa\" he added. On via Melbourne, Everingham and Shiptonthorpe to arrive wearily in Market Weighton and a pint in the Carpenter's Arms before catching bus back to York.\n\nThe walk from Market Weighton to South Cave, done one day on 2011 along with the final leg from South Cave to Hessle, are both on the Wolds Way. The walk is largely on chalk downland and I took the short detour to visit North Newbald with its magnificent church, village green (and welcome pubs - both with an animal theme, the Tiger and even more unusually, the Gnu. The smart money is on the Tiger if it ever comes to a fight.). South Cave is a pleasant enough large village / small town and dormitory suburb to Hull. I've driven through it hundreds of times but great to slow down and notice stuff I'd never seen before (stone bears on a wall, an Italian bakery owned by a genuine Roman, the gothic entrance to a local hotel).\n\nFrom South Cave the path descends via Brough and Ferriby towards the Humber (never the River Humber...) and past a plaque commemorating the discovery of some Bronze Age boats in the middle of the last century by two local men until finally the Humber Bridge towered over me.\n\nAcross the bridge in icy weather and through Barton I hit a minor road that took me steadily south and then became a footpath (part of the Viking Way) for a short while paralleling the A15 and then peeling off along the side of fields south east and then south west through an empty landscape. (A previous bishop of Lincoln, rather unepiscopally and I'm sure unfairly, has referred to Lincolnshire as \"two and half thousand square miles of b****r all\") I stopped near a stile to munch some sandwiches and noticed the aroma of coffee from a large factory in the distance. The path led back to the A15 after a few miles and crossing the M180 motorway I found myself in the small town of Barnetby. Deciding I'd press on further, the landscape became more interesting, leading first across muddy fields to the village of Bigby and then into the hamlet of Somerby. (the \"by\" suffix is Old Norse for a village or settlement and often appears in this part of the country with its Viking heritage - the meaning lingers in English in bylaw and by-election). Near Somerby Hall is a monument erected in 1770 celebrating 29 years of marriage for the then inhabitants of Somerby Hall (or as the inscription would have it, \"the 29th year of their happy conjugal union in the tenth year of our good and gracious King George III.\" As someone who until September 2014 was also in the 29th year of my own happy conjugal union, it raised a smile! Down a small track through woodlands and over the single track railway line from Cleethorpes took me to the small village of Howsham.\n\nFrom Howsham, I stopped for a morning breakfast roll and tea at Clayton's Corner Coffee House where the excessive alliteration was the only thing with which to find fault. Great food, reasonable prices and some innovative handmade cards and gifts. On to North Kelsey and, perhaps predictably, South Kelsey where I visited the church and mourned the fact that the pub was firmly closed (although at least still trading, in contrast to at least two closed village pubs encountered that day). I stopped at the small church at Thornton le Moor and sought out the key from a local villager. He accompanied me and gave me a guided tour of the church showing some of the original Saxon stonework. Outside the door was the grave of a soldier from the First World War; unusual in that soldiers were all buried in France or Belgium with no repatriation - the odd exception like here was generally where a soldier had been invalided back to Blighty and subsequently died of wounds. Across a very muddy field and into Osgoodby (closed pub, open (tiny) post office in someone's front room). Through West Rasen and then a lovely bridleway across fields and through woodland until coming out onto a busy A road for the last couple of miles into Faldingworth. This would have been a pretty boring 40 minutes were it not for the Red Arrows (based locally at Scampton) who were out practising and who enthralled me with my own private acrobatics display at times directly overhead and nearby - fantastic!\n\nA few weeks later, returned to Faldingworth and set out for Lincoln. On the drive down the temperature had fluctuated a degree or so either side of freezing, so although the chill was diminishing, the first village, Cold Hanworth, seemed appropriately named. Past some old hangars, remnants of a long forgotten second world war aerodrome which once hummed to Lancasters and Halifaxes before closure in 1946.Through Welton, where I stopped for a Lincolnshire sausage sandwich and pint (when in Rome...) and admired the church with its distinctive war memorial, and into Nettleham where a wedding had taken place that morning. Across some fields and then a slog into Lincoln where I met up with Margaret at the cathedral (we'd combined a weekend in Lincoln with some walking for me).\n\nThe following day attended Choral Matins at the Cathedral which was attended by the High Sheriff (originally of course the Shire Reeve and the King's representative in the county) and various other local luminaries in distinctive dress! The back of the order of service listed every High Sheriff since 1155 when Jordanus de Blossevilla held the post. He - and until 1989 it always was a he - is elected for one year and it's fascinating to trace the local families back through time; John Lindley Marmion Dymoke (1979) for instance has at least one ancestor in every century back to Robert Dymoke in 1484....The service finished with upmarket canapes and champagne in the nave where chief constables and QCs made polite conversation with random tourists; the Dean asked me where I was from and on hearing York responded, \"Ah, welcome to a proper cathedral!\" Margaret caught the train back home and I continued south, originally by way of the old railway line towards Boston alongside the River Witham and then through the village of Washingborough which marked the beginning of the Lincolnshire Fens. One of the stained glass windows in the (Norman) church there commemorates the Zeppelin raid on the village in 1916. Along minor roads and footpaths to Potterhanworth, Nocton, Dunston, and with dusk falling, into Metheringham. I'd booked a room at the Lincolnshire Poacher which proved a great choice. First class accommodation, excellent food and beer and one of those enjoyably serendipitous conversations with a couple of semi-retired teachers, Frank and Anne, who were also staying there.\n\nThe following day dawned bright and clear with some spring sunshine and was almost entirely across fields, on bridleways and footpaths - brilliant walking. The route in these parts in called the \"Spires and Steeples Way\" and is aptly named with sleepy village churches in almost every hamlet and village. I often find that paradoxically it’s through walking that one finds some inner calm. The mechanical action of steady walking leaves the mind free to reflect and meditate. Archbishop Stephen Cottrell, in his own book about walking the camino, comments, “It was the insistent activity of the walking that was bringing me to stillness, doing something to me, and heightening my awareness of what was around me and what was within me”. Robert McFarlane in his lovely book “The Old Ways” captures something of the same idea: “Walking is a reconnoitre inwards, and the subtle way in which we are shaped by the landscapes through which we move”. Through Scopwick, (where there was a mainly Canadian war graves cemetery filled with Canadian aircrew) Digby, Dorrington and into Ruskington where I stopped for a sandwich. The last part of the day was minor roads, bridleways and then finally along the river Slea into Sleaford where the day's walk ended at the station among hundreds of kids awaiting their school buses back to the surrounding villages.\n\nLater in March, an early start from York had me back in Sleaford before eight, although no thanks to the pea brained signalman who decided to put a slow freight train just in front of the 0600 from York thus creating a 20 minute delay into Grantham and a rush across the bridge to catch connecting train. Dank and misty in the early morning, this was a day to put one's faith in the weather forecast, which had forecast a fine day by mid-morning. Signs warned of the possibility of deer, cattle, and more unusually, toads, and there were plenty of rabbits and squirrels in evidence. The minor road I followed took me past some industrial chicken farming, with a nasty accompanying niff of ammonia, but then more pleasantly onto a footpath along an old disused railway line (The old Sleaford to Bourne line, but with such negligible passenger traffic that it survived for less than sixty years after its opening in 1872). It now makes a lovely walk through ash and oak trees with small copses from which partridge and pheasant would occasionally clatter. Arriving in Scredington the road took me over an ancient packhorse bridge, originally created by Gilbertine monks to aid travel between Sepringham Abbey and Haverholme Priory, and rebuilt in the seventeenth century, and eventually after a long straight minor road with just an occasional car, into Helpringham - the many villages ending in -ham around here (Old English for a farm or homestead) - reminding me that this has been farming country for many centuries. Stopped briefly at the only shop I encountered between Sleaford and Spalding for a drink, and headed south and then east. The minor roads became tracks, with grass growing down the centre, and serving only the odd house or farm. (Passed two Home Farms, a Bridge Farm and a Grange Farm today, but no sign of either Eddie Grundy or, more regrettably, \"The Bull\"). On schedule the sun came out just after eleven, and the path eventually led onto a bridleway paralleling the busy A52 and then headed south again as a footpath next to the functionally named South Forty Foot Drain. These drainage ditches were a real feature of the day's walk and necessary with the altitude rarely more than 10 feet above sea level. Disappointingly large amounts of litter along one stretch adjacent to a picnic table led to my wondering whether the preponderance of Carling cans mean that Carling drinkers were especially antisocial, but concluded that it's probably just a function of brand size (\"More dentists use Colgate\": true, but so do delivery drivers, dancers, dockers, dieticians and detectives - it's the biggest brand!). This is really thinly populated country but as the hamlets got smaller, their names became increasingly grandiloquent: Donington Westdale, Burton Redwardine and Gosberton Risegate were just some encountered during the day. (My favourite named Lincolnshire villages lie a little to the east of the walk; to the signpost with the legend \"To Old Bolingbroke and Mavis Enderby\" someone once added, \"A son\"). Turning east once more, the fields were mainly devoted to growing daffodils. Wordsworthian it wasn't, with huge gangs, mainly east European, bent double harvesting these and stacking them on special pallets. Through Gosberton and eventually into Pinchbeck and Northgate where a final leg east and then south along mainly tiny roads led to a footbridge across a large Drain, alongside some nurseries, and into Spalding town centre leaving me feeling both weary and contented after a long day.\n\nEaster Saturday and another day's walking. An early start from York, breakfast at Sainsbury's in Spalding and quickly left the town behind. Past ubiquitous fields of daffodils, and along a road for a couple of miles until a footpath to the right took me along tracks past huge stacks of hay bales being rearranged with a forklift truck - a Sisyphean task. Back onto an A road for a mile or so then onto a small track where a guy was forking crab apples into a wheel barrow; he proudly indicated his labour of love - a fantastic open garden flanking the road for several hundred metres. Stopped for lunch and ate my sandwiches outside the church of St John Holbeach Fen which was unlocked and open to visitors. A little further on and stopped for a post lunch kip in a field for 30 minutes and then arrived at the \"Woadman's Arms\" in Newton where the clientele were nearly as scary as the blue daubed face on the pub sign. Legend goes that ancient Britons used to fight naked daubed in bright blue woad; giving rise to the song popular about a hundred years ago (tune - Men of Harlech): \"What's the good of wearing braces / Vests and pants and boots with laces /Spats or hats you buy in places / Down the Brompton Road?/ What's the use of shirts of cotton / Studs that always get forgotten / these affairs are simply rotten / better far is woad / Woad's the stuff to show, men / Woad to scare your foemen / Boil it to a brilliant hue / And rub it on your back and abdomen....\" And finally into Cambridgeshire. Farewell Lincolnshire. It does feels like I've been walking through England's second biggest county for ever. I've enjoyed it; its deserted old airfields, daffodils, waterways, village churches, beer, eponymous sausages and windmills but most of all its sheer emptiness; huge in size but one of the most unpopulated (83rd out of 90 counties / metropolitan areas for population density with only 121 people per square kilometre: the comparable figure for Greater London is over 5,000). The last few miles into Wisbech on a footpath parallel to yet another waterway which led past some docks into Wisbech town centre where a monument commemorates Thomas Clarkson (1760 - 1846), a contemporary and friend of Wilberforce who was active in the campaign for the abolition of slavery.\n\nA couple of weeks later and continued south from Wisbech - a day of bright sunshine although still quite cold. Surprised within a mile or so to find myself in Norfolk - had no idea it came this far west! Breakfast at a propitiously placed Morrisons near the outskirts of the town and then off the road and onto footpaths - with so much birdsong it sounded almost artificial. The paths continued, through woodlands, over fields, and skirting an orchard before arriving in Upwell, where the perfect combination of an ancient church and a pub (both open) presented itself. Today was one of those days where you sense things imperceptibly change in terms of landscape (more trees and woodland) architecture (churches) and even the beer (first pint of Norfolk Wherry!). Only when walking does one tend to notice these slight changes that signal movement from one part of the country to another. The footpath a bit further on had been illegally blocked by the farmer with threats of loose dogs but clutching a heft of fallen branch I decided that D J Boyce of Outwell was probably bluffing and so it seemed as I remained unbitten... The last few miles were remarkably deserted - footpaths and bridleways took me past a pair of swans fiercely guarding an egg, bemused looking cows crowding the footpath and some remarkably stupid sheep until I arrived at the Lamb & Flag at Walney where I stayed the night. (The Lamb, representing Christ, and the Flag, representing the Crusader emblem, were often originally meeting places for the 13th century Crusaders. Other surviving variations on this theme are the Turk's Head and Saracen's Head).\n\nSunday dawned much warmer and a brisk morning's walk took me almost exclusively along footpaths and bridleways towards Ely, the cathedral looming in the distance for the last few miles. Was much taken by the small medieval church at Chettisham, its ancient font, and its sense of peace. Stephen Cottrell has observed that some places of worship have a stillness “achieved by the intensity of prayer over many centuries” and this was one such where I stopped awhile before completing the last couple of miles, arriving in Ely and the cathedral there just at the end of the morning service.\n\nCarved out a couple of days walking prior to the wedding of Rosie (my cousin's daughter - first cousin once removed?) which was to be held in Cambridge on the Saturday. Starting out from Ely the path follows the flood wall along the Great Ouse, the pink and blue trains in the distance running roughly parallel to the path looking most incongruous against the green and gold of the fields. Path well defined although overgrown in places and at times with abundant nettles and thistles. The tall grass hiding the river provided the illusion of boats seemingly gliding through the fields - a mixture of narrow boats and cruisers. Many of these were named in a pretty conventional way (Serenity, Carpe Diem, The Good Life, Liberty) although I liked the ones that seemed to reach out further in time and space (Guinevere, Aurora) although “Omega Three” proved that whilst Alpha is the beginning, Omega is not necessarily the End. Through some fields with a sign warning of the presence of bulls (which always makes me slightly on edge, especially when, like today, wearing a bright red T shirt), the path eventually diverged and I swung right to follow the Cam, and stopped for a picnic opposite a small marina. I continued past Waterbeach station and saw the welcome sight of the Bridge Inn just off the path where I stopped for a drink and enjoyed the view from my bench outside by the river. Another couple of miles took me to some locks with a long list of rules posted from the slightly sinister sounding \"Conservators of the River Cam\". A little further, and about three miles outside Cambridge passed an increasing number of rowing eights practising on the river. Past the well-appointed homes of the Cambourgeoisie in the outer suburbs and finally arrived at the Forts St George pub where I enjoyed another pint and later that evening a meal for old times' sake in nearby La Mimosa - a restaurant by the side of the Cam that I have eaten at several times over the last 4 years during Caroline's stay in Cambridge.\n\nFollowing day was less warm with the promise of heavy showers later. Followed the Cam when it emerged from the Cambridge Backs southwards and after a small detour arrived in Grantchester, made famous by Rupert Brooke's nostalgic verse, written in Berlin in 1912 (“Say, is there Beauty yet to find? /And Certainty? and Quiet kind? / Deep meadows yet, for to forget / The lies, and truths, and pain? … oh! Yet / Stands the Church clock at ten to three? And is there honey still for tea?) Past The Old Vicarage (home to Jeffrey & Mary Archer) and to the church with its ubiquitous pelican motifs (a reminder of its long association with Corpus Christi College where the pelican forms part of their coat of arms - the pelican was traditionally thought to be particularly attentive to her young, to the point of providing her own blood by wounding herself when no other food was available, and as a result, the bird came to symbolise the passion of Jesus and to be incorporated in heraldry). Across fields and across the M11 on a footbridge and into the small village of Haslingfield in a light drizzle. (“Is dawn a secret shy and cold / Anadyomene, silver-gold? / And sunset still a golden sea / From Haslingfield to Madingley?) Er, no. Continued into Barrington and ignoring the tempting pub, followed a footpath across the river Shep, round the edge of some fields, past a farm and across a railway line to arrive in the village of Shepreth. At the green, thought I could see a pub sign in the distance to the left and sure enough found the Plough - recently reopened and serving great beer and a Spanish deli board. Sitting outside, munching piquillo peppers, chorizo, lomo, manchego cheese and reading on my Kindle an account of someone's walk along the camino felt authentically Spanish, the weather and the beer notwithstanding. Continuing I then stumbled quickly across the \"Teacake\", a small tea room where I decided to again stop and enjoy a cup of tea and a fantastic chocolate and beetroot cake as dessert. Two other ladies were engaged in animated conversation about the Scottish independence vote - the first time I've heard this spontaneously discussed in England! I liked Shepreth. Some ribbon development led me to Meldreth and the rain started in earnest. Remembered I had been here once before in a previous life to visit the head office of a large ice cream wholesaler (I could still see their lorries parked in a yard behind the station) I pressed on in what was becoming a deluge. Even with my map tucked into a kagoule, it was now sufficiently wet for the map to begin to disintegrate into pulp but just when I could get no wetter, the rain eased and I swung right from a small footpath onto the beginnings of a bridleway, part of the Icknield Way. This led after a while onto a main road that led me the last couple of kilometres into Royston (“And Royston men in the far South / Are black and fierce and strange of mouth”) and its train station.\n\nBack on the road just a couple of weeks later, I headed south from Royston station just after 9 one morning. Eventually found the path which broke out of suburbia into some fields and eventually became a well-defined bridleway. Someone had built a cairn and laid an engraved stone with the words. \"Opening your eyes can take a lifetime; seeing is done in a flash\" which provided some food for thought. Countryside open and still very rural although the small villages (Reed, Buckland) beginning to feel rather more manicured (raked gravel. manicured lawns, all visible through freshly painted security gates) than some I'd passed through further north. Buckland had a lovely village church (St Andrews) straight out of central casting but no longer in regular use but still consecrated and maintained. Paused for lunch at Wyddial; inoffensively (I thought) sitting on a bench by a small road and when suddenly a horse and rider appeared from behind an adjacent hedge. The horse reared, and cantered to give me a wide berth, looking back nervously once it had passed. Its rider just smiled and said \"You're very scary, you know!\" Thanks. On through Hare Street (nice tearoom, dodgy pub) and through Hay St, Braughing, Puckeridge (the post office that time forgot) and into Standon, where the old station has been lovingly restored. The path followed for a while the track bed of the old railway (part of the branch line from Ware to Buntingford which opened in 1863 and closed just over a century later under Beeching).Towards the end of the walk I managed to lose the path and found myself inside the grounds of a big stately home - my exit at the end of a long drive blocked by large gates and a CCTV camera - not being able to face the long walk to retrace my steps I eventually scrambled over a fence and back onto the track I wanted, into the evocatively named hamlet of Cold Christmas. 30 minutes later I arrived at my destination for the evening, Fanhams Hall. Looking for somewhere to stay the previous night I've stumbled across this luxury hotel offering a £145 room at less than half price including breakfast - what's not to like?\n\nThe following day after a great walker's breakfast (granola, full English, toast and marmalade and two mugs of tea) I walked the mile and a half into Ware hoping to buy a map (I'd accidentally forgotten to bring one showing eight miles of today's walk). Ware was smaller than I'd anticipated and the local paper shop had no maps at all. Just as I was wondering what to do, a retired gentleman in the shop asked if he could help as he'd overheard the conversation. Turns out he was a fellow long distance walker and gave me (what turned out to be immaculate) detailed instructions for the missing (mapless) section. Good things happen on the camino! For much of the day I was following the Lea Valley Navigation which took me through Broxbourne and then Waltham Cross. More meditative fuel was provided by an inscription by William Blake set into the canal towpath, \"He who binds to himself a joy / Does the winged life destroy / But he who kisses the joy as it flies / Lives in eternity's sunrise.\" Under the M25, and on to Enfield and a particularly desolate section of waterway past industrial parks and factories. Eventually found a small Greek cafe just off the towpath whose beans on two toast, diet Coke and Kit Kat refuelled me and gave me fresh energy (and change from a fiver). Past Pickett's Lock (there seemed to be a lock every mile or so) and the density of moored narrow boats became even greater - most of them permanent homes rather than transient holiday makers. Although many of them were named clumsily or unimaginatively (is there really anything less like a dragonfly than 15 tonnes of steel that can move sluggishly in a straight line at a maximum speed of 4mph?) some made me smile; best of the day was \"Narrow Escape\". On through Edmonton and Tottenham, where for a short stretch of the towpath there were many orthodox Jews and families walking, and onto Walthamstow and eventually Old Ford with the Olympic Park straight ahead. The philosophical theme continued with a graffito on an overhead pipe running across the canal noting that \"Change is the only constant\" and exhorting me \"Play Your Part\". Someone had then risked life and limb to add a further graffito that very Englishly reassured me \"But Feel Free Not To.\" The sun came out and I stopped a couple of times for a quick cup of tea, and, later, a snatched pint, aware however of deadlines and performing complicated mental maths to work out average speed so far and average speed required to get to Kings Cross station by 8pm! At 5pm turned west onto what became Regents Canal and took me through Hackney, Clapton, the achingly hip Haggerston, Islington and Pentonville to eventually arrive at Kings Cross station around ten past seven. It seemed very appropriate to celebrate arrival in London with a glass of red wine at the Spanish \"Camino\" bar a stone's throw from \"Cruz del Rey\" station.\n\nIt was later in November I set out from Kings Cross in a light drizzle and headed off down the Farringdon Road, across Chancery Lane, past St Pauls, noting Pilgrim St as I paused for a coffee, and down across London Bridge to the George Inn which stands close by the site of the famous Tabard Inn from where Chaucer's pilgrims set out one showery April morning in 1386. The Tabard Inn burnt down in 1669 and was promptly rebuilt but was finally torn down for redevelopment by the Victorians - a plaque nearby commemorates the site. Down the uninspiring Old Kent Road with its melancholy mix of fast food joints, pound shops, second hand car lots and the occasional hypermarket and through Peckham, once the butt of jokes and home of Del Boy but now rapidly becoming yuppiefied and home to trendy bars galore. A road sign however raised a smile with its directions to Dover, the Channel Tunnel.... and Peckham (shades of Trotter's International Trading). Through New Cross, Deptford and a left down to Greenwich where I enjoyed my sandwiches under the watchful eye of Nelson, still ceaselessly watching out over the Thames signs of an invading French armada, and the Trafalgar pub. From here followed the Thames Path which allowed one to sample both derelict wharves and forgotten warehouses interspersed with new apartments and shiny offices. This led eventually past the O2 to the Thames barrier which close up appears to be clad in bacofoil, and then to the Woolwich free ferry, the path affording great views of London City Airport on the opposite bank. Abandoning the now rapidly widening river, I headed towards Plumstead and eventually to Abbey Wood where I'd found some unconventional lodgings in a housing estate between Abbey Wood and Thamesmead.\n\nThe following day set out early and was treated to some fantastic views as the sun came up and the mist lifted over parks and Bostall Woods. For an hour or so I was definitely the odd one out as I marched south east into an endless oncoming stream of hurrying commuters and kids heading to school. Eventually reached Dartford and stopped for a welcome coffee and banana cake -special mention to cheery waitress at Costa. After a mile or so I stopped to look at my map, searching for the road that would take me south over the A2 towards Green St Green and into Kent proper. A lady stopped and pointed me in the right direction. \"Just take the second right past the doctors' surgery - it's called Pilgrim's Way...\" There's always a moment walking out of a city when you feel you're starting to escape the centripetal urban pull and escape into the country and for me it was just outside Dartford - the buses switch from red to green, there are farms starting to appear and fields replace houses and shops. Under the M25 and along a rather long and empty road, stopping for lunch in Longfield at a small sandwich bar called Nancy's where a ridiculously beautiful woman made me a cheese and pickle roll and served me a Coke. Pausing at the imposing church of St Mary Magdalene, I forked off onto minor roads which took me through Meopham and Sole Street - by now deep into stockbroker country. A footpath led through some apple orchards where, incongruously, I could hear the faint drone of bagpipes. Into Cobham and, pausing only for a brief pint at The Plough, I continued along a footpath through Cobham Park and past the Cobham mausoleum (commissioned by the 4th Earl of Darnley and built in 1786) and through woodland and eventually across the high speed railway to France and anticlimactically into the suburbs of Strood where a further 25 minute walk, past seas of purple placards exhorting passers-by to cast their votes for UKIP's Mark Reckless in the next day's by-election, led me to Strood station.\n\nTrain down to London - another late arrival from Virgin East Coast. Apparently we were late leaving Peterborough due to \"slow running\". In other words, we're late because we're late because we're late... From Strood station past tattoo parlours and dodgy pubs over the Medway; the traditional dividing line between Kentish Men and Men of Kent. Heading south along the Medway I passed the village of Borstal where the original young offenders' institution was set up. A Baptist church was offering hot cross buns and tea so stopped on impulse and enjoyed a chat, tea and buns. Out onto the Kent Downs, and enjoyed the many different shades of green from avocado to mint saturating the landscape. The Robin Hood pub was tucked away and stopped there for a pint and to read the paper. The path wound on until I found myself in Thurnham and the White Horse where I decided to stop. Random conversations heard today: \"I've stopped wet shaving my underarms\", \"we could put them on the hymnbook shelf but then they might get communion wine on them\" and \" he drank all the profits - occupational hazard for a barman\". Fantastic meal and a good night's sleep.\n\nThe following day decided I needed to cover a bit more ground so after a proper walkers' breakfast set off at a good pace along the Pilgrim's Way and quickly arrived at Hollingbourne (with its famous monk themed pub \"The Dirty Habit\") and then on past Harrietsham and detoured off the path to Lenham where I found a great tea room serving carrot cake and tea - weather warm enough to sit outside - and bought a cheese roll and cake for lunch. The path was peaceful with just a quiet hum from traffic sometimes audible as well as the occasional plane two or three miles above gradually closing on Gatwick some 35 miles away to the west. \"Pilgrim bound, with thy staff of faith, rest thy bones\" exhorted a plaque on a bench. The scenery became increasingly beautiful as the path typically followed a ridge on top of the Downs offering great views and perspectives - rolling grassland, stud farms, vines, and traditional oast houses with their traditional clapboard sides now almost all converted into private houses. Despite the views, there were remarkably few walkers; just the occasional dog walker following a lead. Signposting was awful - clustered thickly when the path was blindingly obvious and completely absent at key junctions where four or five paths spread in different directions. Lay in sunshine and read paper and ate picnic and then continued on through Westwell and eventually after some 25 miles arrived in Chilham where I found a room at the Woolpack Inn. Went to the other pub in the village for dinner which was a great choice - good food, beer and affable young landlord who combined a career turning round failing pubs with an antiquarian book business, Bed and a welcome nine hours’ kip.\n\nLeft Chilham for the final 8 miles walk into Canterbury and after some stiff climbing and wending my way past an vast acreage of orchards complete with portakabins for the (largely East European) pickers and fleet of buses for transport arrived on outskirts of Canterbury where I stopped for a coffee and a chat with two brothers, one of whom had a Taiwanese wife and the other a young son called Lorenzo. Destination's end was the cathedral where I slipped in and joined the Good Friday service for an hour or so. \"Forgive us Lord when we achieve our ambitions because we have wished for so little; forgive us for arriving safely when we have sailed too close to the shore\" seemed apposite and challenging prayers both for the day and the journey thus far.\n\nJuly / August 2012\n\nStarted pilgrimage on Wednesday 18th July at the early morning communion service at York Minster where a special prayer for pilgrims was said; the reading for that day was Psalm 91 - very reassuring! Margaret said goodbye is typically undemonstrative fashion – “Have a good session – see you sometime” – which made walking away easier. Caroline joined me for the first two days and after taking the train to Canterbury, we had a great day’s walking from Canterbury from the stone that marks the start of the Via Francigena that actually goes all the way to Rome – I was only doing approximately half of it to Switzerland! The path escaped the city’s suburbs and became the Pilgrims’ Way. This took us through Patrixbourne with its lovely church and shortly after past Higham Park, once home to racing car driver Count Louis Zborowski, known for building and racing cars which were known as Chitty Bang Bangs, and were the inspiration for the eponymous book and film. Other famous visitors to the mansion (beside Ian Fleming) have included Mozart, Jane Austen and Charles de Gaulle. The path continued, across fields smeared yellow with oilseed rape, to the village of Womenswold with its thatched cottages, and finally to Shepherdswell where we took the train back to Canterbury.\n\nThe next day a return train to Shepherdswell to begin a day’s walking which was gentle and fairly flat. Lots more oilseed rape – but also some woodland copses and villages with red tile cladding and peaked chimney oast houses, originally for hop kilns. The route also took us through the grounds of another grand house, Waldershare House, a grade 1 listed Palladian building from the early eighteenth century, and once the seat of the Earl of Guildford. The path then followed minor roads to begin the descent into Dover past the castle – the largest and arguably the most impressive castle in England. It dates from the 12th century and contains almost five kilometres of underground tunnels which saw extensive use during the Second World War when invasion was thought to be imminent. I said my goodbyes to Caroline, and boarded a ferry, where I met an Italian pilgrim, Francesco, and we walked to the youth hostel in Calais together. Had dinner together and chatted - he was a history teacher in Tuscany - and then decided to walk the next 18km together the following day until our paths diverged (he was walking further than me that day). Had a chance to briefly look round Calais which is pretty much the dump I remember. Noted that the English are specifically blamed for bombing the cathedral in 1944 whilst it was just \"bombing\" that destroyed much of the rest of the town in 1940...\n\nThe path starts off on the beach until climbing to Cap Blanc Nez and fantastic views - England clearly visible 24 miles away. Place rich in history with lots of crumbling concrete German bunkers as well as reminders that Caesar set out from near here to invade England. I also passed Bleriot plage, the take off point for the first powered aeroplane flight of the Channel in 1909. Wissant where I stopped for the night was a pleasant seaside town.\n\nSet out in rain along path which that day (Sat 21st) was a mixture of farm tracks, forest paths and minor roads; however some sunshine by the time I arrived in Guines for lunch (a beer and a packet of crisps as a small bar was the only sign of life). Fellow historians will remember this as the meeting place of Henry VIII and Francis 1 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. Also passed en route at Mimoyques the site of the V3 base where Hitler planned his final throw of the dice in 1944. Chambre d’hôte that night at Alembon with classic four course dinner with wines for each course - just like being at home, really....\n\nSunday is always the hardest day to walk in France - everything is shut and as one trudges on in the sunshine one catches the classic smell of French Sunday lunch drifting from dozens of windows - today I had to endure roast chicken, grilled lamb, beef daube and other enticing smells.... Good to arrive in Wisques and present myself at the Abbey de Notre Dame where on scrutiny of my pilgrim \"passport\" was shown to a basic room, and then served a simple dinner with other pilgrims before joining the Sisters for the service of compline at 8 which was sung in Latin - tremendously haunting in the huge abbey church; and then abbey doors locked and a welcome 10 hours sleep concluded my first ever night in a nunnery. Learned that religious sisters are never addressed as \"Madame\" but \"Masoeur\" (unless it's the Abbess who is \"Mamère\"). Gradually adjusting to life in rural France where things are generally reliably open between 10 and 12 and then 3 to 5 on Tuesdays to Fridays - beyond that one hopes for the best but without much expectation!\n\nMonday 23rd July set out from Wisques just for a few kilometres to Wizernes where I travelled off the path to St Omer where I found an auberge and then had a rest day which I appreciated.\n\nThe following day (Tuesday 24th) I caught the bus back to Wizernes and continued south east over the river Aa (surely the first river to be listed in a gazetteer of all the world’s rivers?) onto Thérouanne. Accosted by the mayor in the street who insisted on providing me with a drink and showing me the two rooms of the municipal museum including cannonballs from the siege of 1533. Making my excuses I continued on some remote tracks through a couple of hamlets eventually arriving in Auchy en Bois. Spotted some Commonwealth war graves in churchyard - allied airmen killed in crash between two aircraft in August 1943 and buried there - very peaceful now. I'd phoned ahead to book a chambre d’hôte I'd plucked at random from the guide but what a find it turned out to be! Turns out it is recommended by Alistair Sawday and other guides and has been run for many years by Gina Bulot who was tremendously hospitable, has some fantastic accommodation and cooked a great dinner. There were three other English couples staying there en route to Italy and Switzerland and we had a convivial dinner together - good to be able to talk in English for a change - it seemed strange that one couple was planning to arrive in Switzerland the following day where for me it's still a month away...\n\nWednesday 25th set out just after 8 en route to Bruay-la-Buissiere where I arrived late afternoon. This is gradually becoming (ex) mining country - lots of spoil heaps in evidence that over time are becoming grassed over and even forested; their unnatural cylindrical shapes the only clue that these are manmade and not natural features. The path meandered a lot today - as Gina explained last night it has become quite political with every small commune wanting to route the path through \"their\" hamlet or village. Given that I've met exactly one other walker in six days walking in France they may be being optimistic in the perceived benefits of the 'pilgrim euro'; but I'm sure they were having exactly the same arguments a thousand years ago... With 169km under my belt I'm now about one sixth of the way to Geneva and I think I'm only just belatedly starting to realise what an undertaking this is! Enjoying it hugely but taking it a day at a time is the key. Feet in good shape and having done over 100 miles in new boots I'm hopeful that they're now properly broken in and should be OK. Weather has gradually improved the further from England I have travelled - today has reached 32° with more to come apparently.\n\nThursday 26th was a big stage - 35km to Arras. Got up early therefore and was en route by 6.45. Route a real joy to walk - a mixture of old railway lines, farm tracks, minor roads and grassy paths beside the river. Quite misty to start with but the sun coming through around 10. Hardly saw a living soul - and was relieved after 21km non-stop to stumble across a boulangerie five minutes before it closed at noon. The long morning included thousands of spiders' webs already dissolving in the heat; curious cows following me; alternate rows of red and green lettuces growing (very artistic) and lots of hay bales stacked in fields. The route to Geneva is predominantly south east so I'm always happiest when the compass is showing something between 120 and 150 degrees - anything else is effectively a detour! This means that most days I get lightly toasted on my left hand side in the morning but then really grilled in the fierce afternoon sun between 2pm and 5pm on my right side - Thursday was no exception.\n\nAbout 4 km from Arras the route goes within 200m of Louez First World War cemetery. Like all Commonwealth War Graves cemeteries this is immaculately maintained - but significant for me as this is where my maternal great uncle Wright - killed on the Somme in August 1916 - is buried. Along with 154 comrades the graveyard lies tucked away in farmland on land ceded to Britain by the French government in perpetuity. As I made the short journey to his grave I inevitably found myself once more reflecting on the lines from Rupert Brooke: \"If I should die think only this of me / that there's some corner of a foreign field / that is for ever England.\" Wright’s younger sisters survived him by nearly three quarters of a century. On to Arras, found a hotel and over dinner got chatting to Bryan and Sylvia, two friendly Canadians (brother and sister) also visiting family graves from a century ago after fulfilling some work commitments in Paris.\n\nFollowing day set out for Bapaume. Getting out of big towns on foot is always a dreary business and Arras was no exception but after 4km hit open country and the sun came out. On what has become the \"normal\" mix of quiet country roads and tracks suddenly came across another war cemetery - \"Sunken Road Cemetery\". Many of these small places - containing perhaps one or two hundred graves from a particular phase or location of the war - are folded into the surrounding countryside and are very serene and peaceful; it certainly now is \"all quiet on the Western Front\". I found myself reflecting on the words of Edward Thomas, killed in France not far from here in 1917 (and whose own wife Helen also lived another 71 years until 1988): “Now all roads lead to France / And heavy is the tread / Of the living; but the dead / Returning lightly dance.”\n\nLater that afternoon a recumbent form in the distance resolved itself into Marcello, another Italian pilgrim. He is really pushing himself; having allowed himself just 62 days from Canterbury to Rome (I'm doing about half the distance in 44 days). Walked with him into Bapaume where he found a pilgrim's shelter (the local church hall) and I a cheap hotel. As this didn't open till 6 I sat outside a bar sipping a beer or two and watched the heavens open and a torrential thunderstorm unfold. Dry under a canopy I nevertheless eventually admitted defeat and went inside where a cheerful Aussie and an equally relaxed Frenchman were rapidly becoming best buddies comparing notes about the (very valiant) Australian exploits at nearby Villiers - Bretancourt in 1917. I made the mistake of joining the conversation at which more beers flowed; tearing myself away at 7.30 I went to check in and eat an evening meal. Slept well apart from a persistent mosquito which had infiltrated itself into the room. Was reminded of Anita Roddick's famous quote; \"If you think you're too small to have an impact, try going to sleep with a mosquito in the room!\"\n\nSaturday 28th dawned a bit cooler. However nowhere open and relieved to find a bakery open at Moislains just before noon. Rain showers started and feet starting to hurt as well but marched on and arrived Péronne and checked into first hotel I came too - too tired to contrast and compare. Bought some Compeed and sat outside café writing up journal and pondering several things including why French hotel rooms favour such lurid colours (orange and primrose yellow two particular favourites, often together); why France as a major European nation has no indigenous pop music and has to rely on English classics; the strange and unnatural French love of the endive, a peculiar vegetable; and my growing fondness for Leffe Belgian beer.\n\nSunday took a \"jour de congé\" or day off to rest the feet. Sat in square in morning and finished \"The unlikely pilgrimage of Harold Fry\" A brilliant book and highly recommended - thanks Mary Wride for pointing me at it before I went. There's a lovely bit in it just before the end about listening to nuns singing: \"the nuns' voices rose, woven in song, and for one splendid, fleeting moment the beauty of it crammed her with something that felt like happiness\" which put me in mind of my experience at Wisques a week earlier. Visited the big memorial museum there, \"The Missing of the Somme\" which was very powerful in showing the war on both the front and at home for France, Britain and Germany. Feeling by this stage the need for some activity I borrowed a bike from the Tourist Info Office and cycled 25km in a big loop around Péronne, encountering yet more war graves. The inscriptions on the grave stones (all identically sized, without variation by rank, and made from white Portland stone) are often moving, particularly filtered through early twentieth century restraint: \"It's hard to say farewell to such a kind husband and loving father\", \"Called to higher service\", \"Where your treasure is there will your heart be also\", \"Missed\", read some of them. Dinner at family restaurant where mother combined waitressing with eating with her husband and 3 kids on big table at front of restaurant.\n\nMonday 30th departed from Péronne along an old railway track and the miles quickly fell away. The landscape is gently undulating, with crops including wheat, maize, courgettes, lettuce and cabbages among those I could recognise; together of course with the ubiquitous and never ending poppies at the side of the fields. Someone had recommended to me a pilgrim hostel at Tugny-et-Pont and I walked steadily towards this arriving about half three. What a place! Run by Jean-Marc and Marie-Antoinette there are four self-contained little rooms in a field by the edge of the river Somme where Jean Marc (a sculptor) is also restoring an old 14th century mill destroyed by the Germans during the retreat of 1917. They left about 9 having cooked me a fantastic supper of omelette, pasta and salad washed down with rosé and followed by cheese and peaches, leaving me in charge of the site, a goat and a small sheep! Slept for ten hours despite the goat plaintively rubbing its head against the door; the bell round its neck ringing the whole time.\n\nOn Tuesday I quickly arrived at Tergnier; the last 10 km the most scenic including a grassy track and then following a canal into the town. My guidebook had given me low expectations of Tergnier; \"Tergnier\" (it opined darkly) \"is one of the least attractive towns on the route. It is a former railway hub and has limited accommodation; some of which is very poor\". To be honest, I've seen worse, but it's fair to say the influx of Brits who've decided this is the new Dordogne won't be arriving just yet. It has a footnote in history, however, as being the station from which the German and French delegates departed in 1918 to discuss Armistice terms, before transferring to a railway carriage that the French had deliberately chosen as belonging to Napoleon III (defeated of course by the Germans - or more accurately the Prussians - in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. The French have long memories). Being a former railway hub it was easy to jump on a train to Laon (tomorrow's destination) find a cheap hotel and then return Wednesday on the train just with a day sack to walk the 36km back again.\n\nPlan worked flawlessly and having caught the 0641 from Laon I started walking from Tergnier back towards Laon on Wednesday just after 7am. One of the best days yet. My pace was slightly faster without the rucksack and the countryside was changing as well: more hills and more forest - for the first time since Calais found myself above 200 metres, a gentle reminder of what's still to come! There was just the perennial problem of finding somewhere to eat as 23km in I was beginning to fade in the hot sunshine. On cue however unexpectedly appeared \"Le Rustique\" which was offering today's menu (rabbit terrine with cornichons, chicken in mustard sauce with fried potatoes, cheese, mousse au chocolat and 25cl of wine) for 14 euros. My reckless addition of a coffee pushed this to nearly 16 euros and I left refuelled with a smile on my face remembering one of the reasons I love France so much. On in the sun (it's 1pm and 32°, real mad dogs and Englishmen stuff) but with regular application of sun cream and water reached Laon without incident. Laon is a beautiful town, the old town perched on a rock 100m above the surrounding countryside and as a result the cathedral dominates the view from miles around (I could see it, rather depressingly, when I was 15km away in the distance). Sat in the cool interior for a while, admiring the huge rose window, and listened to the plainsong quietly playing. At 347km I'm now over a third of the way with 15 days out of my 44 gone so still on track; I'm perhaps a bit fitter and can walk 30 km without collapsing but still aware of some 38km stages and of course plenty of hills still to come!\n\nLeft Laon on Thursday morning (2 Aug) and this proved to be another delightful day across fields, through woodland and along small lanes, crossing the huge forest of St Germain. Even the barking dogs were more muted today. (Buried somewhere in the French civil code is a requirement for all citizens to have at least one dog; and to train it / them to bark frantically at the slightest provocation). Every day I encounter dozens of hounds who noisily mark my passage, generally from the other side of fences and gates. I have discovered that the volume, ferocity and duration of such barking can generally be extended by momentarily pausing, or banging my stick, or trailing it along the ground - these tactics send the average mutt wild with fury. For maximum effect, slowly raising the stick to point directly at the pooch and growling softly will generate the most extreme paroxysms of rage, although on two occasions now the animal has responded to this raising of the stakes by letting its ears droop and wandering off, apparently thoroughly cowed. John Hattam the dog whisperer? It made a change today to spot a sign warning not of dogs but merely \"Attention - chat ferocé!\" At lunchtime stopped for a picnic at the tiny village of Chernizy-Ailles and got my pilgrim passport stamped - this \"proves\" that one is genuinely walking long distance and is a credential that one is often asked to show when staying overnight in abbeys and the like; but is also becoming an interesting record of my snail's progress across rural France. The French love of bureaucracy means that an official stamp is rarely hard to find! Stayed at small hotel in Corbeny that night - the owner was very pleasant but was clearly in the middle of a ferocious argument with his wife which he broke off to welcome me, check me in, and give me the room key. His wife stood grimly by while he did all this, looking like a bulldog chewing a wasp. As I ascended the stairs I could hear them start again with undiminished vigour. Corbeny, a small village with a population of perhaps a couple of thousand souls boasted the following facilities: a florist, taxidermist (evidence of the French love of hunting), butcher, doctor, restaurant, bar, hotel, church, bakery, hairdresser, post office and épicerie. It also marked a significant departure in that it contained the first vineyard I'd seen since entering France - a reminder that I'm now south of the fifty degree line of latitude and proof that champagne country is approaching...\n\nOn Friday the sounds and smells of breakfast brought me downstairs and I left just before eight; setting a good pace as today was a long stage. After 10 km the route dropped down onto the St Quentin canal which I then followed until the outskirts of Reims. Canals are good for walking alongside in that they are generally (a) quiet (b) easy to navigate and (c) flat! However this seemed interminable with long straight featureless stretches. I wrote of leaving Arras that getting out of big towns is always a dreary business but entering them at the end of a long day is even worse. Having already done 32km, re-joining the road for the last 5km to the town centre was hard work but arrived eventually and found hotel. Along the way I asked two fishermen how far it was to the centre of Reims - one said 20 km and the other 4. It proved to be about 12; never ask non-walkers for estimates or directions; they have no idea! In Reims enjoyed a drink, a meal; and met once again Francesco, the Italian pilgrim first encountered in Calais with whom I shared a beer. Reflected that I've now covered 414km and am on track against the timeline required. Not yet half way of course, and still a long way from Geneva. It is not the end, or even the beginning of the end, (but to quote Churchill) I think I'm entitled to see arrival in Reims as the end of the beginning. Saturday evening's highlight was the magnificent son et lumière at Reims cathedral at 11pm. Never seen anything quite like it as the whole cathedral seemed to shimmer and dissolve; quite literally jaw-dropping.\n\nSunday morning found a French église evangelique and went to morning service there - good to be with people with whom I have much more in common than the language which divides us. The rest of the day involved a chance stop at a circus where jugglers were getting ready for their afternoon performance (Le Temps des Cerises) and where I got a chance to play their ancient piano; a meeting on the path with Rodney and Shani, two Oz pilgrims making their way north from Rome with 1600 km under their belts since their departure on 23 May and who encouraged me with tales of the route still to come; a walk through the magnificent vineyards of Champagne and through the classic wine villages of Verzenay, Verzy and Trepail; a serendipitous conversation with a lovely English couple, Yvonne and Giles Halling who although full at their chambre d’hôte took me in, chatted and found me a bed in Trépail 7 km down the road; and a stupendous rainbow at the end of the evening. A great day, bearing out the truth of a passage in a book I'd read a few days previously. \"Travelling on foot is the right speed for human beings. Walking sorts out your problems and anxieties and calms your worries.\" (Nine Lives, William Dalrymple).\n\nMonday was a quiet walk through the champagne villages of Ambonnay and Bouzy (yes, really) and then along canals and through woodland to arrive at Chalons en Champagne, where I found a hotel in the town square and had a quiet meal before an early night.\n\nTuesday's stage had been preying on my mind, to be truthful. It was a 39km monster with nowhere really to cut short the day, and the guidebook warning that, \"this is an extremely long and exposed section crossing open country. It is essential that you carry sufficient water and food for the day - accommodation choices are extremely restricted.\" Having bought a picnic at Monoprix the previous night I set off before 7am having booked myself in at the only (chambre d’hôte) accommodation in the village of Le Miex Tiercelin. It was a hard day, but not too hot and for most of it following the old Voie Romaine, a wide stony and exposed track that runs pretty much south for dozens of kilometres. Straight as an arrow, one can see it piercing the landscape ahead for many miles. With my MP3 player on and with the encouragement of Eva Cassidy, Fairground Attraction, Abba (sorry), Chopin, Beth Nielsen Chapman, John Rutter, James Taylor and Bach (random shuffle is truly a wonderful invention) the kilometres quickly fell away. The landscape is huge cereal fields (almost prairies) in all directions with the occasional grain silo in the distance. First field of sunflowers today, something I always associate with the south of France and another reminder of progress made. Lunch was taken at Coole, 27km in, and then those last kms (more slowly now) to Le Miex Tiercelin where I arrived about 5. Run by a very old lady (a doppelganger, for any family reading, to dear old Auntie Ethel) who provided basic accommodation and a meal of sorts later that evening! It also marked the half way point - another landmark.\n\nWednesday (8th) was another long day continuing at first on the old Roman road and then on a series of pretty much deserted country lanes until an unpleasant final 6km into Brienne by the side of the D396 with lots of articulated lorries heading to pick up the motorway a few km further on. Brienne provides a free pilgrim gite for walkers who can demonstrate their credentials (see earlier in blog) and so ensconced myself there - un grand merci to the burghers of Brienne. Noticed today that I had crossed into another département. The French divide the country into 95 départements (counties). These are all numbered alphabetically from Ain to Val d'Oise and one tends to notice when one has crossed the boundary as all the car number plates start to sport the new number. So far have passed through 62 (Pas de Calais), 59 (Nord); 80 (Somme), 02 (Aisne); 51 (Marne) and 10 (Aude); do keep awake at the back, there. Today is also the halfway mark in time (22 days spent out of 44) but with 53% covered feel I'm still on track! Had a quick look round Brienne in the evening: memories of Napoleon dominate as he spent 5 years here at military college (1779 to 1784) and in 1812 the chateau became his headquarters for a while. He is commemorated in \"Le Petit Caporal\" tabac and \"La Pharmacie de l'Ecole Militaire\" among others. Dinner provided great entertainment - two German businessmen bemused by the menu but one wishing to impress and translate for the other; \"Was ist coq au vin?\" \"Ja, es ist ein Fisch!\" Fell into conversation with a Dutch couple, Willem and Mariella, after dinner; more wine was ordered and the world put to rights. Back to my gite through a silent and shuttered town.\n\nThursday 9th was a more reasonable 29km section to Bar sur l'Aube following the approximate line of the river Aube southwards. I took the time to slow down today as having completed two big stages the previous two days it's easy to press on, be focused on the destination and not take time to 'stop and stare'. The longer I spend on this walk, the more I realise that although the destination is important, it isn’t that that changes us but the process of travelling – the time and space and interactions that allow us to explore the geography of our own hearts. Robert McFarlane puts it well in his introduction to The Old Ways; “this is a book about people and places, about walking as a reconnoitre inwards, and the subtle ways we are shaped by the landscape through which we move”. The purpose of pilgrimage, therefore, is not just to arrive, but to journey well – it’s as much about travelling hopefully as it is about arriving. And it is this challenge to live in the “now” that I’m finding most rewarding, not just on my walk, but in life generally. It’s making me conscious of just how much time I can spend regretting the past or planning for the future and not enjoying the here and now. The Bible tells us that “by faith Abraham set out, not knowing where he was going”, and I’m beginning to think this is quite a distinctive feature of the Christian hope. Both optimism and despair know the answer and are clear about the outcome. They complete the story prematurely. They know too much about the future. However for those of us who are Christians, we have no way of describing or predicting our journeys, or of knowing what lies ahead.\n\nToday therefore made time to take a break at Unienville; sit and admire the church at Jessains; enjoy a leisurely picnic in a deserted Dolancourt; and at Jancourt the river looked so inviting that I stopped for a quick swim. Overhead all day the sky was crisscrossed with vapour trails 6 or 7 miles up - I'm guessing that I must have been underneath one of the main European air traffic control routes. Arrived in Bar - a pretty town sporting many of the half-timbered buildings that seem to be the local architectural vernacular - and found a basic hotel, the halls and stairways conforming to Hattam's rule of small French hotel décor by being strikingly decorated throughout in fuchsia pink and mustard yellow. Dinner in the 'Jardin des Délices\" was OK - spoilt a bit by wasps (which wasn't their fault) and lackadaisical service (which was).\n\nFriday 10th a rest day in Bar sur l'Aube - good to have a long sleep and then catch up on rest day chores including a visit to la laverie! A picnic lunch and then explored the town. On the edge of Champagne it has some real gems including the lovely 12th century church of St Pierre; spent some time sitting in there in the coolness, sensing the centuries of worship that have soaked into the old stones and taking a pause for some prayer and meditation of my own. Roy Uprichard talks of the places “where memory, hope and prayer make the air porous and one can navigate the borderlands between this world and the next”. I guess we all need to find those \"thin places\" for ourselves.\n\nIn the afternoon, sitting in the mediateque next to the church, updating the blog and catching up with emails, was treated to the organist practising for a forthcoming concert: we had at full volume some Mendelssohn, Bach, St Saens and lots of other stuff I didn't recognise - magnificent! Evening meal in the Celliers des Moines (old 12th century cavern) provided some great food. One of the things I love about moving across France at this snail's pace is the almost imperceptible changes in the local food and wine: today for the first time the fromages included the Burgundian cheeses of Epoisses and Brillat Savarin; a nod to the fact that I'm about to move from Champagne into Bourgogne.\n\nSaturday was a short stage through vineyards and forests in hot sunshine to the famous Cisterian abbey of Clairvaux - now mainly transformed into a high security prison. Stayed at small hotel in the village where the proprietor apologised that they had a wedding party that evening and that it would go on long into the night. Met Rolf and Petra, two German pilgrims from Munster walking to Santiago in short stages of three or four days every year as they have young family of four boys. The wedding party didn't keep me awake at all and slept soundly.\n\nSunday 12th a long day so breakfasted at 7 and started off at cracking pace. It was good to see a mobile boulangerie about two hours later where I bought some lunch. I covered the first 25 kilometres non-stop - one of those days where the scenery is sublime, legs are rested, the day is fresh, and the pack seems to weigh so little that I started worrying I'd forgotten to pack something! Had planned to head south east to the little village of Mormant but a series of calls to several small chambres d’hôtel and hotels in the area had established that everywhere was full. It seems that not only have the French treacherously abandoned their posts at hotels and shops that I would have liked to have used but have then had the temerity to decamp en masse to some of the most beautiful countryside in France taking up valuable beds there.... Took a detour therefore to Chaumont, which I knew would add about 13km to overall distance; worse, psychologically, was that the last 15km of the day took me slightly north east in the \"wrong\" direction. Passed close to the village of Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises; the ancestral home of Charles de Gaulle and the place where he is buried. At Chaumont took a train to Langres, the next day's destination and found hotel there: this meant that I could return to Chaumont the following morning without pack and walk back to Langres w"
