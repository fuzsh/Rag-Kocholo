        "text": "What begins here is the brainchild of my endless love for history, what ifs and dislike for some turns of history. Let's see that I \"just\" aim to rewrite the history of Aragon from 1299 to 1490 or so...\n\nAlfonso IV if Aragón, the Kind (Naples, 1299 – Barcelona, 1364*).\n\nKing of Aragon, of Valencia, de Sardinia, Corsica and earl of Barcelona\n\nfrom 1327 to 1364.​\n\nAlfonso IV of Aragon is noted for his military successes and the expansion of his kingdom, that became one of the military powers in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislation and government as well as the ravages of the Black Death.\n\nHe came to the throne after her brother, Jaime, renounced the throne to become a monk in 1319 and after the death of his father, Jaime II (1267 – 1327). As Ramon Muntaner states in his Crònica, a chronicle of his life and the age he lived, Alfonso had a very stressing beginning of his kingdom, as his wife, Teresa of Entenza, was very ill after giving birth to their seventh children ** when his father died.\n\nAlfonso had to face several and deep troubles during his reign. The first was the conquest of Sardinia, a long and complicated enterprise that was to last for a whole century and that led to long wars (1351-55 and 1377–81) with the Republic of Genoa.\n\nThe second was the economical crisis, worsened by the wars with Castille (1356-1361) and Genoa, that affected the commerce of Aragon through the Mediterranean sea, that were to last until the final defeat of Genoa in 1380, during the fourth war between Venice and Genoa, that began the decline of the Republic.\n\nThe third trouble was the Black Death, that added to the damage caused by the economical crisis by decimating the population of the kingdom. Meanwhile, the fiscal pressure on the kingdom caused by Alfonso's expensive wars and alliances led to discontent at home. The king purged the royal administration of a great number of ministers and judges, but, in the end, he had to negotiate with parliaments of his kingdom, that forced the king to accept a deal.\n\nBy the early 1360s, it was clear that Alfonso's policy of alliances was too costly, and yielded too few results. A major change came in July 1361, when Alfonso staged a major offensive, advancing deep in Castille a force of 10,000 men. His army sacked several cities and, when he was withdrawing back to Aragon, he was intercepted by Pedro's forces. Amazingly, on 11 September 1361, the Aragonese army defeated a far larger Castillian army in the Battle of Villena, causing heavy casualties to Pedro, who, faced with the threat of a Muslim invasion from Granada and the ongoing civil war with his bastard brother, decided to cut expenses and offered a peace treaty to Alfonso, that the Aragonese king was eager to accept.\n\nAlfonso's later years were marked by inertia and political strife. He lost the appeal for the day-to-day affairs of the state so during the 1360s he increasingly relied on the help of his subordinates, some of them deeply hatred not only by his subbdits, but also by his sons. The political institutions that existed in the kingdoms he ruled (Aragon, Valencia and the county of Barcelona) reinforced their own privileges, weaking the powers of the king, something that, in the future, was to be cause of deep troubles between the crown and the parliaments of those kingdoms.\n\nThankfully those later years were of relative tranquillity, without wars, but with the discontent caused by the fiscal pressure of constant campaigns. Those problems were to arise only after Alfonso's death.\n\nAlfonso IV died on June 21st, 1364, in Barcelona. He was succeeded by his fourteen-year-old grandson, King Juan I.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nChildren of Alfonso IV of Aragon & Teresa of Entenza ****:\n\nAlfonso (b. 1315 — d. 1317)\n\nConstanza (b. 1318 - d.1346)\n\nPedro (b. 1319 — d. 1361)\n\nJaime I (b. 1320 - d. 1379), earl of Urgel\n\nIsabel (b. 1323 – d. 1327)\n\nFadrique (b. 1325 — d. 1350), earl of Montblanc\n\nSancho (b. 1326 — d. 1387), earl of Girona\n\nJaime (b. 1328 - d. 1370), earl of Ribagorza\n\nJuan (b. 1330 - d. 1358)\n\n---\n\n* Here you have the first butterfly: Alfonso lived 25 years longer than he did IOTL.\n\n** Here you have the second butterfly: Teresa didn't die whilst giving birth to her son Sancho on 20 October 1327 at Zaragoza, only days before her husband became king of Aragon.\n\n*** Third butterfly\n\n*** Until Sancho, those are the OTL sons and daughters of Alfonso and Teresa, althought some of the have their life expenctacies a bit... changed. From then on, butterflies...\n\nJuan I de Aragón, called by posterity the Hunter\n\nor the Lover of Elegance (Perpignan, 1350 - Torroella de Montgrí (Gerona), 1383)\n\nKing of King of Aragon, of Valencia, of Sardinia and earl of Barcelona (1364-1383)​\n\nJuan I de Aragón, was, without a single doubt, one of the worst kings of Aragon. A very cultured man, with a taste for verse and expending money that was ill-suited for the economy of his kingdoms. He was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, something which led him to try to restrain the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead; he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, with art and culture at the centre, and the cause of most of his expenses and, thus, of his troubles.\n\nAs Juan I was 14 years old when he became King of Aragon, and, as the parliaments of his kingdoms genuinely feared that Juan's uncle, Jaime, earl of Urgell, would usurp the throne, the prince was quickly crowned king on 16 July 1364. Again, fears of Jaime's ambitions influenced political decisions, so there was no regency led by the King's uncles, and Juan I was to exercise kingship with the help of a series of \"continual councils\" from which Jaime of Urgell was excluded. Jaime, together with his younger brother Sancho, earl of Girona, still held great informal influence over the business of government. Furthermore, most of the Catalan nobility sided with them.\n\nHowever, the king's councillors and friends, most of the Aragonese noblemen, increasingly gained control of royal affairs and earned the mistrust of the Parliaments, specially the Consell of Barcelona. Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of taxation between 1364 and 1368 that were spent on military expeditions against the rebellious Sardinia. By 1368, there was a deep-felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of the society of the Kingdom.\n\nWhile the poll tax of 1369 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt (Spanish. Guerra de los Remensas, Catalan la Revolta del remences), the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death (1348-1349) and subsequent outbreaks of the plague, made worse by the bad harvest of 1310/1314 and 1324/1329, plus the famine of 1334/1335 in Catalonia and the famine of 1340/1347 in Valencia. The Black Death was to plague the Crown of Aragan with several smaller bouts in 1362, 1371, 1383 and 1395.\n\nThe Remensa was a Catalan mode of serfdom. Those who were serfs under this mode are properly pagesos de remença (pagesos meaning \"peasants\"); they are often (though not quite correctly) referred to simply as remences (singular remença). The rebellion was a popular revolt that began in Catalonia in late May 1369, and on 12 June, bands of peasants, under the leadership of a man called Verntallat des d'Hostoles, gathered mainly in the mountainous interior, and fought the royal army. To the cry of \"Visca el Rey\" (Long live the King\"), the small remensa army advance taking many small towns, threatening Vic and even venturing a full attack against Girona on December 14th, 1369, forcing Juan I to go to rescue the city.\n\nIt is unclear how much Juan, who was nineteen years old, was involved in the negotiations, but it seems that he was present at the meetings held outside the walls of Girona. There the king agreed to the rebels' demands, but the rebel leaders were not convinced of the king's sincerity, but the king acted with calm and was very persuasive, thus he appeased them and, after granting them clemency, Juan I allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.\n\nThe king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into the area of Vic and Girona to suppress the rebellion. By the end of June the last rebels had been defeated and the Peasants' Revolt was finished. During its durantion, John had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion.\n\nOne of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry Martha of Armagnac (18 February 1347 - 23 October 1378), daughter of Count Jean I of Armagnac: on 24 June 1370. The marriage had diplomatic significance, as the king was a Francophile, while his grandfather had been an Anglophile. Martha died during a bout of the Black Death in 1378, and was greatly mourned by her husband.\n\nAs the King kept spending more and more and his reign was characterized by disastrous financial administration, his relation with the parliaments of his kingdoms went form bad to works and, when in October 1380 he requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm (in part related with the expenses caused by the expeditions send to Sardinia, as the island was almost lost because of Juan's incompetence), the parliament, gathered at Monzón, responded by refusing to consider any request until the king made some changes in his policy and got rid of some people from his close circle, mainly the king's favourites. Carme of Vilaragut, one of the friends of the late queen, was the object of the most vicious accusations.\n\nJuan was deeply offended by this affront to his royal prerogative, and confronted by a group of nobleman led by Jaime de Aragón, earl of Urgell, and Juan de Aragón, earl of Empurias, who brought an appeal of treason against several favourites of the king. Juan tried to stall the negotiations to gain time, as he was expecting one of his favourites to arrive with military reinforcements. However, those forces were routed by the armies of the earls of Urgell and Empurias. Joan now had no choice but to comply with the appellants' demands; two of the favourites were judged, condemned and executed, while some other sent to exilesentenced to death in February 1381. The circle of favourites around the king, was thus broken.\n\nJuan gradually re-established royal authority in the months following and by May 1382 he had recovered the control of the government, claiming that the difficulties of the past years had been due solely to bad councillors abd promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly.\n\nHowever, he had neither forgotten nor forgiven the indignities he perceived. Then he began to look for another wife. The chosen one was Yolande of Bar, daughter of Robert I. Meanwhile, as the troubles in Sardinia were still going on and the Catalans forces were in danger of being overrun, the king decided to intervene. While the expedition was being prepared, he used this army to strike at his enemies and had them arrested, claiming that a plot was being planned against him, although there is no evidence that this was the case.\n\nThe trials were fast. Jaime de Aragón, earl of Urgell was the first to be brought to trial, on September 1382, condemned and executed. Juan de Aragón, earl of Empurias was held prisoner but, when the time for his trial came, he was found dead on his cell. . It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed. The rest of the rebellious earls were either sentenced to life imprisonment or to the death penalty.\n\nHowever, before the dust was settled, Juan I died. It took place during a hunt in forests near Foixà when he fell from his horse, like his namesake, cousin, and contemporary, John I of Castile. As he had no male heirs and his younger brother had died in 1381 because of the Black Death, he named his cousin Martin, earl of Girona, as his heir in his last will, and to him went the crown.\n\nSo maybe we have a Spain that largely speaks Catalan instead of Castilian, right?\n\nNo, I'm sorry. I must admit I didn't think about that option when I started this thread. Now I'm considering at doing something about Castille, but I don't think that what you suggest is possible or doable. It is like hoping that England would end up speaking Lowland Scots or Scottish Gaelic after having James Vi of Scotland and I of England as king. Not doable, so to speak.\n\nXenophonte puts it very well.\n\nHowever, it doesn't mean I'm not going to forget about them...\n\nThe problem is that regardless of the wishes, the cold reality of the potential demographic and the great territorial extension Castilian; indicate that unless as in OTL, stronger safeguards and guarantees were created, Castilla will become the more probably dominant partner in the union;\n\nAbsolutely right. I can only imagine a divided Castille between the old kingdom of Leon and Castille as a victim to Aragonese expansionism... and not even then.\n\nthis superiority can be compensated perhaps by an earlier Union and a monarch who resides in Aragon and / or is a Aragonés.\n\nNot all are disadvantages for Aragon, in a possible union with Castile ...\n\nget the backing of the bigger human resources of the Castilian Kingdom and the support of its powerful navy...\n\nProvided of course that the organization of the political power in this hypothetical Iberian Union, allowing to Aragon dispose of those resources in its Mediterranean expansive policy.\n\nThis is most interesting when comes to deal with France and/or any Italian campagin, if we ever come to that...\n\nAnother interesting possibility would be the union of all the Iberian kingdoms under one monarch.\n\nEven though It's difficult to reconcile the different and opposites Geostrategic Interests of the three Iberian kingdoms and control the powerful centrifugal forces represented by its powerful territorial aristocracy who jealously guarded their privileges and autonomy from theirs monarchs and who did not hesitate to initiate and support rebellions and / or rivals to the reigning monarch*or not recognizing the royal succession in or out of the governing dynasty.\n\nRight now, I can only think of two possible kingdoms in the Peninsula to be annexed to Aragon\n\nWell, we shall see. The problem is that Aragon is orientated sea and somehow pro-English and Castille is orientated to the Atlantic ocean and quite pro-French. Not to mention some difference in economies, that are shaper if we compare Catalonia and Valencia with Castille, while Aragon in some sense, is quite \"Castillian\".\n\nYour feelings about the Trastamaras are quite understandable and very shareable given as they behaved and how they used their Aragonese heritage; but in my case is for what they represent .. the prototype and predecessor of Great Spaniard Aristocracy 'the Grandes of España' (the Grandees of Spain).\n\nI share your both points of view about them.\n\nMartin the Humane (Girona, 1347 – Barcelona 1393),\n\nalso called the Elder and the Ecclesiastic\n\nKing of Aragon, Valencia, Sardinia and Corsica\n\nand Count of Barcelona from 1383 and King of Majorca from 1390.​\n\nMartin the Humane, during his youth, had been appointed by his father and the Sicilian nobilty, lord and regent of the island of Sicily, since its queen Maria, was underage (Maria's father, Frederick III the Simple, died in 1377). When he became king, he arranged the marriage of his first son and heir, Pedro, with Maria, thus uniting both crowns in the future.\n\nMartín never felt sure on the throne. Martin was not next in the line to the throne; the heir presumptive was Juan of Urgell, Earl of Jérica, who descended from Alfonso IV's second son, Jaime, Count of Urgel. Martin's father, Sancho, earl of Girona, was Alfonso's third son. He was named heir by the last will of Juan I, but that was not enough for him, apparently.\n\nMartin consulted with Parliament frequently, but was sometimes at odds with the members, especially over ecclesiastical matters and the Western Schism. In 1401, following his failure to mediate between Pope Urban VI and the antipope Benedict XIII, he changed sides, and supported Urban, and made the Parliaments of his kingdoms the enactment of De heretico comburendo, which declared that all the supporters of Benedict XIII were herecits and, so, punishable with being burned at the stake. Inr spite of all his troubles with Parliament, it never reached, not even remotely, the levels of animosity seen during the kingship of Juan I.\n\nEarly on in his reign, a thorn on Martin's side had been Jaime V of Majorca (1). Though the kings of Majorca traditionally swore an oath of fealty to the kings of Aragon, Jaime III of Majorca claimed that no king could have lordship over any other king and since 1342 no king of Majorca went to Barcelona to perform the ceremony of homage to the King of Aragon, his feudal overlord, or, if they did, was on his terms, as in 1339 or 1350. The rising economic star of Majorca, whose merchants were establishing independent markets and gaining trading privileges in the western Mediterranean, threatened the supremacy of Barcelona. The gold coinage of Majorca and the diplomatic equality granted it by the powers of France and Italy irked Martin further. Martin's outrage, however, was given no excuse until 1388, when Jaime, threatened with invasion by the French over disputed rights to the Lordship of Montpellier, called Aragon for aid. In order not to offend France nor to support Jaime, Martin summoned the king of Majorca to a cort at Barcelona, to which he knew he would not come, and when Jaime failed to appear, Martin declared himself free from the obligations of an overlord to Jaime.\n\nMartin then opened a legal process against Jaime, with the intent of dispossessing him of his kingdom. He alleged that the circulation of Jaime' coinage in the Counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne to be an infringement on the royal right of monopoly of coinage. James resorted to ask help to Rome, but Urban VI was too busy ending communal rule of the banderesi and restorung the Papal authority. By the time he could have been able to intervene, he was terminally ill and Martin went on with the process against his cousin. In February 1389 Martin declared Jaime a contumacious vassal and his kingdom and lands forfeit.\n\nThe legal process being terminated, Martin went to war. In June a fleet landed arn army at Majorca and quickly defeated Jaime's force at the Battle of Santa Ponça. Martin received the submission of all the Balearics and confirmed the privileges of the islands as they had been under Jaime I. Then Martin invaded the remaining lands of Jaime, the Roussillon and Cerdagne. In March 1390 Martin had declared his realm incorporated into the Crown of Aragon in perpetuity and ceremoniously had himself crowned its king. Jaime, reduced to its lands in Montpellier, sold them to the king of France to pay for an army to invade Catalonia, just to be defeated again. After that, Jaime fled into Castile, where he died of illness or poison at Soria on 20 January 1395. His pretensions to Majorca passed to his sister Isabella, wife of John II of Montferrat.\n\nThe later years of Martin's reign were marked by serious health problems. He suffered acute attacks of some grave illness in June 1391; during the winter of 1391–92; finally a fatal bout in March 1393. Medical historians have long debated the nature of this affliction or afflictions, with no avail. The acute attacks have been given a wide range of explanations, from epilepsy to some form of cardiovascular disease.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nChildren of Martin I of Aragon & Margarita de Prades (1347 - 1400), daughter of Pedro of Aragon, Baron of Entenza (1332–1375)\n\nPedro IV of Aragon (1366–1412)\n\nMartin, earl of Urgel (1367–1411)\n\nJaime earl of Montblanc (1369–1425)\n\nBerenger, Duke of Tarragona (1370–1437)\n\nBlanca (1372–1409) married in 1402 Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg\n\n(1) As there had been no process against Jaime III of Majorca, his line has lasted a bit longer... to meet the same fate.\n\nPedro IV of Aragon (Barcelona, 1366– Lleida, 1412), called the Honest,\n\nking of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and Corsica and king of Sicily,\n\nand count of Barcelona, Roussillon and Cerdanya.​\n\nPedro IV was regarded during his lifetime as a warrior-king. His youth was marked by his military endavours fighting the Corsican revolts, that were to go on during his reign. That rebellion caused no small troubles to him, as the he came into conflict with his father, whose health was increasingly precarious from 1391 onward. Father and son had different opinions about how to end the rebellion, as Pedro was more willing to use sheer strength and harh measures to end the rebellion for once and all, something that was not of his father's liking.\n\nIn the last year of his father reign, the rebellions picked up speed. Aragon had been trying to subjugate Sardinia since the reign of James II, and gradually the Aragonese had conquered most of the island. However, in the 1380s, during the reign of Martin, the remaining independent principality of Arborea became a fortress of rebellion and the Aragonese were rapidly driven back by Eleanor of Arborea, so that practically the whole of Sardinia was lost. King Martin sent his son Pedro, by then king of Sicily through his marriage to Queen Maria of Sicily, to reconquer Sardinia.\n\nIt was long lasting enterprise that Pedro had to left half-finished to return to Barcelona to be crowned in 1383 and pestered his reign until the king won the Battle of Sanluri (Saint Luis, San Luis) in 1390, drove away the Genoese allies of the Sardinians, and subjugated a vast number of Sardinian nobles. This soon caused Arborea's total loss of independence.\n\nIn 1400, the Epiphany Rising took place in Sardinia. It ended with the defeat and execution of the ruler of Arborea, Marianus V. Thus the Sardinian rebellion was fatally wounded. Sardinia would rise again twice, in 1403 and 1408, two minor issues compared with the previous risings. The island was, after that last rebellion, finally pacified and divided among several Catalan noble families (the Cardona, the Cruilles and the Lleonart) that were to play an important role during the reign of Pedro IV's heir. During this rebellion, Maria of Sicily died in 1400\n\nAfter defeating the last Sardinian rising, Pedro returned to Barcelona to look again for a wife and to pacifiy his kingdoms, as they were restless because of the internal strife caused by nobles and factions, which he had to work very hard to quell.\n\nDuring the Sardinian revolts, Pedro found time to recover one of the dreams of Jaime I by sending a crusade to the East. In fact, it went just to Constantinople. In 1400-1402, the byzantine Emperor, Manuel II, toured several European courts asking for help against Sultan Bayezid I, who was besieging Constantinople since 1394. In 1399, Charles VI of France sent Marshal Jean Le Maingre with 6 ships carrying 1,200 men to Constantinople. Pedro sent 6 ships wth 1,000 men that joined the French expedition and remained in Constantinople until 1403.\n\nOne of the reasons that kept the Sardinian issue going on were the internal troubles of the Aragonese kingdom, but another one were the problems of the neighbour kingdom, Castille and Pedro's lover, Constanza Enríquez (1382-1445). When, on 9 October 1390, king Juan I of Castilla died and was succeeded by his minor son, Enrique, the siste of the late king, Leonor, opposed her nephew's accession and she formed the League of Lillo along with her illegitimate half-brother Fadrique and her cousin Pedro. King Enrique III opposed the League. As Constanza was a friend of Leonor, she persuaded his lover, the Aragonese king, the enter the war in the side of the League, but Pedro IV, instead of doing that, prefered to mediate between the warring parties to avoid seeing Aragon and Castilla going into war.\n\nConstanza also took a keen interest on the political life of Aragon, something that was deeply resented by the nobility, making hard to pacify the kingdom and the feuds between the noble families, as the old rivalries had become even worse during the long Sardinian war. Then, Pedro IV died suddenly on 12 July 1412. He was 46 years old.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nChildren of Pedro IV of Aragon & María de Sicilia\n\nPedro V (1393 - 1463)\n\nAlfonso (1396–1398)\n\nMaria (1397–1405)\n\nSancho (1410–1416)\n\nPedro V of Aragon (Girona, 1393 - Barcelona, 1463),\n\ncalled \"the Bewitched\" (Spanish: el Hechizado, Catalan \"el Embruixat)\n\nKing of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica and king of Naples,\n\nand count of Barcelona, Roussillon and Cerdanya.​\n\nPedro was the only child of King Pedro IV that survived his childhood. He succeeded to the throne as King of Aragon upon his father's death in 1412, when he was 19 years old. Upon succeeding his father he called a Parliament in Zaragoza for his coronation. He crowned himself, disappointing the Archbishop of Zaragoza and thus rejecting the surrender Peter II had made to the Papacy, in an otherwise traditional ceremony. He did, however, affirm the liberties and privileges of his kingdoms.\n\nAfter the festivities in Zaragoza, Pedro V began on his way to Barcelona to receive coronation there. On route he stopped at Valencia to affirm the Constitutions of Valencia and receive the homage of his subjects. Once in Barcelona, he took revenge on his father's lover, Constanza Enriquez, depriving her of income and forcing her to leave Aragon and never to return.\n\nIn 1413 he married Blanca of Navarra (1387-1455), daughter of King Charles III of Navarre. She had been married before to Phillip II, Count of Nevers, but, as Blanca was unable to give him sons, the marriage has been dissolved. The same seemed to repeated, until her first son, Jaime, was born in 1443.\n\nApparently, some kind of mental illness plagued the king since his very childhood, as, even if he was 19 years old when he was crowned, there was a regency council to govern on his name until 1419. Two of Pedro IV's surviving brothers, Jaime, earl of Montblanc, and Berenger, Duke of Tarragona were appointed regent of the realm in the councy,\n\nThen, in 1421 the childless Queen Joan II of Naples adopted and named Pedro as heir to the Kingdom of Naples, and he went to Naples. Apparently, all that was the result of the influence, bribe and schemes of the Earl of Montblanc, who isolated and left out of the game the rival claimant, Louis III of Anjou. By 1422. However, somehow Montblanc began to loose his influence over Joan, forcing him to spend more time in Naples until May 1423, when Joan II repudiated her earlier adoption of Peter V and, with the backing of Martin V and of the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, named Louis III as her heir instead.\n\nThat led to an all-out war in Italy In late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Filippo Maria Visconti defeated the Aragonese ships and moved in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, rapidly conquering Gaeta, Procida, Castellammare and Sorrento. Naples, which was held by the earl of Montblanc, was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joan's troops. The city fell in April 1424 and Montblanc had to fled to Sicily.\n\nIt was not until 1427, shortly before his 34th birthday, that king Pedro V obtained some measure of independent authority, but his unwillingness to involve himself in administration forced the restorarion of the regency council. Pedro, too trusting and too shy, was soon dominated by a few noble favourites who clashed with the Regency council. The most powerful of those favourites was Guillem, Earl of Pratdip (1406-1464).\n\nAn opportunity for Pedro to reconquer Naples occurred in 1435, after the death of Louis (in 1434) and Joan (in 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to René of Anjou, Louis III's younger brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, Eugene IV, who nominally was the feudal lord of the King of Naples. Then Pedro (in fact, the regency council) decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured Capua and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. Then, the other oncle of the king, the Duke of Tarragona (Montblanc had died in 1425), began to negotiate with Milan, showing to his Duke, Filippo Maria Visconti, that it was not in Milan's interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples. Helped by a Sicilian fleet, the Duke of Tarragona captured Gaeta in February 1436. In the meantime, René had managed to reach Naples on 19 May 1437, but he had run out of luck; the Aragonese army could easily capture Aversa, Salerno, Benevento, Manfredonia and Bitonto.\n\nThe Duke of Tarragona, provided with the most impressive artillery of the times, began to besiege Naples on 10 November 1438, ending it on 2 June the following year. Followed by the Duke, king Pedro V made his triumphal entrance in Naples on 26 February 1440, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom.\n\nThen queen Blanca, who had a great influence upon her husband, as soon as their second son, Alfonso, was born (in 1448), wanted him to be declared heir to the kingdom of Naples, as his first son was the heir of Aragon. Pedro wavered in yielding Naples to Alfonso, knowing that the move would be opposed by the of the Regency Council, and specially by the Duke of Tarragona. However, Blanca was determined to make him see it through. Whern the King made public his decision in 1451, public anger focused on the Guillem, Earl of Pratdip, who was accused of having bewitched the King.\n\nIn 1452, the King and Queen summoned the Duke of Tarragona before parliament on the charge of treason. Apparently, during the war with Naples he had used his powers as Regent to enrich himself and making the Crown unable to enlist troops to avoid the fall of Naples in 1424. This blatant lie was used by Blanca and the Duke of Tarragona's enemies, the Earl of Pratdip, whom Maria held in great esteem, and his nephew, Roger, Earl of Terrasa. Berenguer of Tarragona was put in custody but he died, probably of a heart attack (although there were rumours speaking of poisoning) before he could be tried.\n\nTo make it worse, Carlos, the new earl of Urgell, third in line of succession after to two royal princes, was excluded from the court circle and sent to govern Sardinia in 1452, while his opponents, the Earls of Pratdip and Terrasa, were promoted to Dukes. The new Duke of Terrasa was sent to Naples as a new governor, as it looked that France would try to wage war again in Italy.\n\nCarlos, earl of Urgell, was the nephew of the late Jaime, earl of Urgell (1320-1379) James was the grandson of James, the first earl of Urgell, second son of king Alfonso IV or Aragon, and his claim to the throne was thus superior to that of Pedro V and his father, Pedro IV, whose father, Sancho, earl of Girona, was Alfonso's third son.\n\nIn the following years of Pedro's reign, the monarchy became increasingly unpopular, due to a breakdown in law and order in the countryside, corruption and nepotism, the troubled state of the crown's finances, and the steady loss of territories in France. In 1455, Queen Blanca died and, without his main protection, the Duke of Terrasa who was the most unpopular of all the King's entourage and widely seen as a traitor, came under fire. He had been so utterly uncapable of defending the kingdom of Naples that Carlos of Urgell had to be sent with a new army to replace and to recover the lost castles. The Duke of Terrasa was impeached by Parliament and the king was forced to send him into exile.\n\nThe next mistake came when Carlos of Urgell was replaced by the Duke of Pratdip, as Urgell was becoming too popular with his victories over the French, who were forced to sign a disaventageous peace treaty in 1456. However, in the spring of 1457, the Duke of Pratdip, reopened hostilities in Naples, but by the autumn had been pushed back to the city itself. By 1458, the French had retaken the whole kingdom,\n\nThus Pedro was forced to send the earl of Urgell to Sicily when the island came under French threat on 1458. In April 1459, Urgell had not only secured the island but had landed on Italy and was advancing towards Naples, which was recovered in December 1460. By then, the huge costs of the war had tarnushed the good name of Pedro V, along with claim his rightful place on the council and put an end to bad government. His cause was a popular one and he returned to Barcelona to presenta list of grievances and demands to the court circle, including the arrest of Guillem, Duke of Pratdip. The king initially agreed, but his sons intervened to prevent the arrest of Pratdip. This led to a confrontation between the King's (in fact, the Princes') party and Urgell's party.\n\nBy then, the mental health of Peter V broke down and the king become unable to rule (He may have been suffering from a form of schizophrenia, according to modern authorities).\n\nCarlos of Urgell, meanwhile, had gained a very important ally, Ramon of Cardona, earl of Cardona, one of the most influential magnates of Aragon. Together, they managed that Urgell was named regent 1461. The royal princes were excluded completely from the council, among rumours that they were not of royal blood, as it was suggested that their real father was one of Maria's favourites, either the Duke of Terrassa or the Duke of Pratdip, who was again put under arrest. Other than that, Urgell's months as regent were spent tackling the problem of government overspending and reinforcing the defences of Naples, Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia.\n\nThen, on January 23rd, 1463, king Peter V died, among rumours of having been murdered by Urgell.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nChildren of Pedro V of Aragon & Blanca of Navarra\n\nJaime III (1443-1471)\n\nAlfonso (1348–1371)"
