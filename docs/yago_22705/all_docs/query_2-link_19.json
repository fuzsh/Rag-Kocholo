        "text": "www.britishbabynames.com/blog/2012/12/martha.html\n\nMartha\n\nGentle, steady and modest Martha was a staple in\n\nBritain for over 300 years. Once again, she is winning over the\n\nhearts of British parents who are looking for a homely antique.\n\nOrigin:\n\nA Latin transliteration of the Greek Μάρθα (Martha), which first appears as a given name in the New Testament. The Greek form is thought to be a translation of the Aramaic (specifically Chaldean) word מרתא (martā). The term originates as a feminine form of מרי (mry) \"master,\" and so has the approximate meaning of \"mistress,\" \"lady,\" or \"lady of the house\"— much like the Latin domina.\n\nThat Martha of Bethany in the New Testament was given this name is highly appropriate. The Book of Luke tells the story of when Jesus visited the home of sisters, Martha and Mary. Mary chooses to honour their guest by sitting at Jesus' feet and listening to his teachings; Martha (the \"lady of the house\") busies herself around the house in order to ensure that Jesus is comfortable. She was later made a saint, and her reputation as an industrious and attentive person made her the patroness of homemakers, cooks, servants, and all those who tend the sick and needy.\n\nUsage:\n\nLegend has it that Martha and her family travelled to Provence, and later Tarascon in France. There Martha, it is said, encountered a fearsome dragon that plagued the local people. She managed to tame the creature, and received the title \"St. Martha the Dragonslayer\" in turn. Her shrine is situated in Tarascon, and became the focus of her cult in the Middle Ages.\n\nA few examples of Martha in use as a given name crop up across Europe in the Middle Ages but, for the most part, they are rare. In some cases the name was borne by medieval Scandinavian nobility (including a Queen of Sweden), but some of these examples appear to have been conflated with variants of Margaret.* In England, a handful of examples can be found in Canterbury between 1377-81.\n\nUsage of the name really kicked off at the end of the 16th century and steadily rose over the succeeding century. This upward curve is very clearly demonstrated in Smith-Bannister's frequency tables of 1538—1700. Martha ranked #40 in 1560-9, #26 in 1580-9, #20 in 1600-9, #15 in 1620-9, #14 in 1640-9, #9 in 1660-9, #8 in 1680-9.\n\nThe high usage of Martha led naturally to the need for diminutives. Matty was the first to be used for Martha, which in turn led to Patty and then Patsy. These nicknames were in widespread and standard use by the 18th century (Thomas Jefferson's daughters, for example, were Martha \"Patsy\" and Mary \"Polly\").\n\nThe name was still highly popular throughout the 19th century, and only began to decline toward the beginning of the 20th century. In England and Wales Martha ranked at #30 in 1890, #44 in 1900, #64 in 1904 and #84 in 1914 — after which it fell out of the Top 100. In Scotland, Martha ranked #19 in 1900 and was just hanging on in the Top 100 at #95 in 1950.\n\nIn recent years however, Martha has been enjoying a popular revival. Back in 1996 Martha ranked #214 (198 births) in England and Wales. It gradually picked up usage until, in 2005, it ranked #110 (456 births). That same year, lively Martha MacKenzie (2005-2010) debuted as a character on popular TV soap Home and Away, which may have helped boost Martha into the Top 100: #96 in 2006, #87 in 2007, #81 in 2008 and 2009, and #85 in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Martha ranked #83 overall with 723 births. Individually that equates to #87 in England and #66 in Wales\n\nIn Scotland Martha ranked #133 (38 births) in 2009, #116 (42 births) in 2010 and #116 (38 births) in 2011.\n\nFamous Bearers:\n\nHistory:\n\nSt Martha of Bethany, a woman who witnessed Jesus' resurrection.\n\nSt Martha, mother of Simeon Stylites the Younger, saint in the Eastern Orthodox church.\n\nMartha of Armagnac (c.1348—1378), daughter of John I of Armagnac.\n\nMartha Washington (1731—1802), wife of George Washington.\n\nMartha Gellhorn (1908—1998), notable American novelist, travel writer, and journalist.\n\nRoyalty:\n\nMartha of Sweden (c.1277—1341), influential queen consort of King Birger of Sweden.\n\nPrincess Märtha of Sweden (1901—1954), granddaughter of King Oscar II of Sweden and the consort of Crown Prince Olav of Norway.\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise of Norway (b.1971), daughter of King Harald V and fourth in line to the Norwegian throne.\n\nLiterature and Other Media:\n\nMartha (1844), a romantic comic opera by Friedrich von Flotow.\n\nMartha (1923), a short film made by Walt Disney.\n\nMartha My Dear (1968), a Beatles song written by Paul McCartney\n\nMartha Jones, a companion of the Doctor in Doctor Who.\n\nMartha MacKenzie, a character on Australian soap Home and Away.\n\nOther:\n\nMartha's Vineyard, an island located south of Cape Cod in Massachusetts.\n\nVariants:\n\nMarthe (French, German), Marta (Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Polish), Martta (Finnish)\n\nPronunciation:\n\nMAR-thə [key]\n\nPossible\n\nDiminutives:\n\nMari, Marty, Matty, Patsy, Pattie, Patty\n\nFlorence\n\nStately and sweet, Florence is a proper little lady.\n\nIt isn't a royal name -- but it feels like it should be.\n\nOrigin:\n\nFlorence is the Anglicised form of both the Roman names Florentius and Florentia, meaning \"belonging to Florens,\" which was a common Roman cognomen. Florens itself means \"blossoming,\" derived from floreo meaning \"to blossom, flower, flourish.\"\n\nFlorence is also the English name given to the Italian city of Firenze. There are several theories as to how the city came by its name. The most plausible are either that it derived from the Latin Colonia Florentia meaning \"flowering colony\" (possibly as a figurative term) or that it was a corruption of Fluentia from fluens \"to flow\" owing to the fact that it was situated between two rivers.\n\nUsage:\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Florence was used as both a masculine and a feminine name, most likely thanks to its use by saints or to denote a person being \"of Florence\". There are several Saints Florentius, including a 3rd century Roman martyr, and a St Florentia (d. c. 303). Latinised forms included Florentius, Florentia and Florencia, though all were called by the vernacular Florence.\n\nAlso in use was similar Floria, derived from the Old French flur \"flower,\" which were used in the vernacular form Flur/Fluri and often used with the epithet 'sweet'. Florkin was used as a diminutive.\n\nFlorence was never wildly common, but it was used enough for it to engender the surname Florence. Notable namesakes include Florence of Worcester (d. 1118), a renowned monk and chronicler, Florence (or Floris) of Holland (d.1210), a 13th century nobleman and cleric, and Florence Wilson \"Florentius Volusenus\" (c. 1504–1547), a Scottish humanist.\n\nAfter the 15th century, Florence became far less common as a masculine name, but it maintained better use as a female name. There were exceptions of course, which mostly depended on local area. In Midlothian, Cumbria and Hereford, for example, it clung on as a masculine name for quite a while and eve in my poll of the most popular Elizabethan Norfolk names, Florence was only used once -- for a male.\n\nOverall however, Florence became more common for girls, especially among the peerage. For example, Florence Poulett (b.1612), daughter of politician John Poulett, 1st Baron Poulett had a niece named after her, which was then passed down from mother to daughter for several generations.\n\nIn his top 50 rankings from 1538-1700, Smith Bannister lists Florence four times for girls: 1590-9: #38; 1600-9: #47; 1610-9: #44; 1640-9: #47.\n\nIn Ireland, Florence was maintained for much longer as a masculine name thanks to its being used to render several Irish names such as Flaithrí and Fingin. Notable examples include Fláithrí Ó Maolchonaire \"Florence Conroy\" (1560– 1629), an Irish Franciscan and theologian and Florence \"Flurry\" Knox, a pub landlord in the novel Some Experiences of an Irish RM (1899) by Somerville and Ross.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, Florence was in moderate use. Initially wasn't especially popular it doesn't appear in Dunkling's top 50 girls names for England and Wales in 1700, 1800 or 1850 but it was used continually, and still occasionally for boys.\n\nDickens used the name for his character Florence Dombey in Dombey and Son (1846) which seems to have given the name considerable boost, and author Elizabeth Gaskell named one of her daughters Florence Elizabeth in 1842. Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) was so named because she was born in the city of Florence in Italy, as was and this was perhaps the influence for other parents as Florence was a fashionable destination for wealthy English Victorians.\n\nA further boost to Florence's fortune came with the event of the Crimean War from 1853-1856. Parents clamoured to give their children eventful names. Battles led to several babies being named Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and Sebastopol and names notable figures were also used. Thanks to her part in the war effort and her being used as by the British government as a poster girl, Florence Nightingale became an overnight sensation and national treasure.\n\nBirths in England and Wales:\n\n1838: 26 births\n\n1840: 21 births (at least 3 males)\n\n1842: 63 births (at least 5 males)\n\n1844: 50 births\n\n1846: 86 births -- The year Dombey and Sons was published.\n\n1848: 256 births\n\n1850: 247 births\n\n1852: 398 births\n\n1854: 545 births -- The year Florence Nightingale went to the Crimea.\n\n1856: 1677 births\n\n1858: 1522 births\n\n1881 Florence\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nAs we can see, effect of both Dickens and Florence Nightingale the name Florence was marked and it went from strength to strength.\n\nFrom not ranking in the top 50 in 1850, it was #14 by 1870, #6 in 1880, #3 in 1890, and #2 in 1900. Data from the 1881 census shows that it was most prevalent in England, especially in the southern counties, though it did reach #49 in Scotland by 1900.\n\nIt maintained it's popularity initially in the 20th century, but gradually began to decline. It was #2 in 1904, #6 in 1914, #23 in 1924 and #49 in 1934, after which it fell out of the top 100.\n\nThis can be seen in Dunkling's data for the number of girls registered with the name in every 10,000 births in England and Wales over the 20th century:\n\n1900 1925 1935 1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990\n\n394 142 44 10 4 - - 4 - - 6 -\n\nBirths for FlorenceFrom 1996 to 2003, Florence bobbed along comfortably in the bottom quarter of the top 200 in England and Wales. It gradually began to pick up from 2004, bursting into the top 100 in 2008 at #94. Since then it has risen steeply, ranking #54 in 2010, #34 in 2012 and #29 in 2013.\n\nAs it was in the 19th century, Florence proves it's still very much an English rose.\n\nIndividually, Florence is much less popular in Wales than England (#71 in 2013 compared to #29 in England) while it has yet to reach the top 100 in Scotland and Northern Ireland in recent years\n\nIn Scotland, the name has ranked consistently between #100-#300: #233 in 2010, #142 in 2011, #203 in 2012 and #155 in 2013.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Florence has had no more than 8 births in any given year, peaking at #229 in 2012 and ranking #284 in 2013.\n\nFamous Bearers:\n\nHistory:\n\nFlorence of Worcester (d. 1118), a renowned monk and chronicler.\n\nFlorence Wilson \"Florentius Volusenus\" (c. 1504–1547), a Scottish humanist.\n\nFláithrí Ó Maolchonaire \"Florence Conroy\" (1560– 1629), an Irish Franciscan and theologian.\n\nFlorence Caddy (1837–1923), English writer.\n\nFlorence Nightingale (1820-1910), pioneer of modern nursing.\n\nFlorence LaBadie (1888-1917), Canadian silent movie actress.\n\nFlorence Lawrence (1890-1938), inventor and actress, referred to as \"The First Movie Star.\"\n\nFlorence Marjorie Robertson \"Dame Anna Neagle\" (1904-1986), British actress and singer.\n\nContemporary:\n\nFlorence Bjelke-Petersen (b.1920) Australian politician and writer.\n\nFlorence Henderson (b.1934), American actress and singer.\n\nFlorence King (b.1936), American author.\n\nFlorence Welch (b.1986), British singer and frontwoman of Florence & the Machine.\n\nLiterature and Other Media:\n\nFlorence Dombey, a charcter in Dicken's novel Dombey and Son (1846).\n\nFlorence \"Flurry\" Knox, a pub landlord in the novel Some Experiences of an Irish RM (1899) by Somerville and Ross.\n\nVariants: Florentine, Florentina; Florentia, Florentius (Late Roman), Florenz (German), Floor, Floris (Dutch), Fiorenza, Fiorenzo (Italian)"
