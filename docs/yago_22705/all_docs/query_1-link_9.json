        "text": "Chronica Majora. Before 24 Jun 1237. In the same year, the emperor Frederick (age 42), by special messengers and imperial letters, summoned all the great Christian princes of the world to assemble on the day of St. John the Baptist's nativity, at Vaucouleurs, which is on the confines, or near the confines, of the empire and the French kingdom, there to discuss some difficult matters concerning the empire as well as the kingdom. The king of France, as if entertaining suspicion of this conference, proceeded at the time fixed to the place appointed, attended by a large army, which he had assembled for the purpose, and thus set dreadful and pernicious example to others, inasmuch as he went to discuss matters of peace in the same way as he would to attack his enemies. The king of England (age 29) made reasonable excuses for not coming in person; but sent a peaceful embassy, consisting of some of the chief men of the kingdom; namely, Richard earl of Cornwall (age 28), his brother, with some other nobles, fit to manage a conference, under the guidance of the venerable archbishop of York (age 57) and the bishop of Ely, and other trustworthy persons selected for the purpose. The bishop of Winchester, although selected before all others, absolutely refused to go, and, not without reason, gave the following as the cause for excusing himself: \"My lord king,\" said he \"you lately laid a heavy complaint against me before the emperor, telling him that I, with some other nobles, disturbed your kingdom: whether you did this with justice, or unjustly, God knows; but I trust that I have saved my conscience in every respect. But if your words were now placed with confidence in my mouth and in your letters, and should declare that I was a familar and faithful friend of yours; all this would appear as contrary, and he would accuse both you and me of instability; and this would blacken your fame in a great degree. Therefore, because it would be manifestly to your dishonour, I will not go on any account.\" And in the opinion of many, this reply gave sufficient excuse for him. When all preparations had been made, and they were all ready to set sail on this journey, they were met by letters from the emperor, to say that he could not go to the conference then, as he had purposed; but that what he could not do then, should, by God's favour, be carried into effect on the Nativity of St. John the Baptist in the following year; and thus each and all of them returned without effecting anything. In this year, on the day of the Supper, the bishop of Hereford consecrated the holy unction in the church of St. Albans [Map]. About this time, too, John Scott (deceased), earl of Chester, closed his life about Whitsuntide, having been poisoned by the agency of his wife (age 19), the daughter of Llewellyn (age 65). The life of the bishop of Lincoln (age 69), too, was also attempted by the same means, and he was with difficulty recalled from the gates of death. In the same year, in the week before Whitsuntide, there fell storms of hail which exceeded the size of apples, killing the sheep; and they were followed by continued rain.\n\nLetters 1536. 24 Jun 1536. R. O. 1193. John Husee to Lady Lisle (age 42).\n\nHas this day received her letter by Corbet, and with it £4, which he has delivered to Basset, \"who is now, lauded be God, merry and in good health at Lincoln's Inn.\" This will pay all his debts and what he has borrowed for his commons. \"And it is not to be doubted but he will be husband good enough, for he is both discreet, sober, and wise, and not too liberal in spending.\" Can keep nothing secret from her ladyship. Finds that Basset has not been half so well treated as he was at Mr. Danastre's, \"but hath been grontyd and grudgid at, and laid in a worse lodging than he was wont to be.\" Finds he has no mind to return thither \"by reason of a dunne cowe that is in the house, by whom he hath had five or six calves, so that she thought all too much that was set before him, and would have Mr. Danastre spare for to bring up her calves. God send them good weaning! But I had little thought Mr. Danastre had been a man of so vile and dissimuling a nature,\" else he should not have been so fat fed. Hopes to get \"him\" (Basset) an honest lodging within seven miles of London against the vacation, but Mr. Skerne and his wife have shown themselves at all times to be one manner of people. Will learn of my lady Sarum the Queen's (age 27) pleasure about your coming over to the coronation. Will do all he can about Hide for my lord and my lady's profit. As to your ladyship's daughter, you will receive herewith my lord Montague's letter showing both my lady's and his meaning. My lord said the Queen had appointed all her maidens already, and that on the next vacancy he would get my lady to do her best for your daughter's preferment. This was all his answer. Mentioned the matter to Lady Rutland (age 41), Mrs. Margery, and Mrs. Arundell, but is sure no one moved it except lady Sarum and Mr. Hennage. Did not press Lord Beauchamp (age 36), who would scarce give him a hearing. Will show Mr. Hennage that Mrs. Catharine is of sufficient age. Will work by Mrs. Margery's counsel and Mrs. Goldyng's if he find her friendly. Is sorry Skutt has disappointed her about her gown. He promised repeatedly it should be made like the Queen's gowns. Is sure the \"velot\" (velvet) will be found satisfactory. God have mercy on Mr. Norres's (deceased) soul! for my lord may say he lost a friend. Hopes, however, his new friends will be good at length. Begs that William Sendy, Lady Lisle (age 42)'s man, may have the profits of making the passports. Has delivered the hogshead for lord Daubeney to Thomas Seller, who has cellared it till he know my lord's pleasure. Has written to lord Daubeney about it, and about the quails sent by my lady, which were given to his friends as he was so far off. Seller said he would undertake to redeem Bekonholt Wood for £40, or that if you would write to Mr. Hatche that my lord Dawbny should do his pleasure with Waram Wood, Bekonholt might be allowed to stand without money. Geofford is in town. Will speak with him in the morning. London, 24 June.\n\nIf her ladyship would send the Queen her bird and her dog, thinks they would be well received. Hol., pp. 4. Add.\n\nLetters of the Court of James I 1613 Reverend Thomas Lorkin to Sir Thomas Puckering Baronet 24 Jun 1613. 24 Jun 1613. London. Reverend Thomas Lorkin to Thomas Puckering 1st Baronet (age 21).\n\nIf these letters did not assure you to the contrary, you might judge me dead; at least that some strange accident hath befallen me, who have kept so deep silence so long a time; for to imagine that either I could forget or neglect your so infinite merits towards me, were a censure too hard and rigorous once to enter into the conceit of so generous a disposition. None of these therefore have been the occasion, but only a mere necessity, first of drawing forth my journey into a longer tract than ever I propounded to myself, and then of making a farther abode in France, than at the beginning I intended, thereby to accommodate certain businesses of your brother [Note. brother-in-law] Newton's (age 33)1, which began through my absence to grow into some untowardly disorder. But now that I am safely arrived here, I shall promise to dedicate myself wholly to your affairs, and will hope to improve my industry and diligence such as you shall find no fault to complain that ever you reposed in me that trust which you have done. Touching your design in the prince's' service, I had already communicated it with Mr. Newton, who giveth small encouragement of proceeding farther in it, at least till his highpess grow near upon the point of bis creation [as Prince of Wales], which is yet likely to hold us in expectance three years longer.\n\nThere hath been already some contestation had between your brother (age 33) and Mr. Murray2, the prince's tutor, touching the place of secretaryship, this man making it, as your brother formerly did, the chief end of his hopes; so that at length Mr. Newton hath been content to relinquish his right thereunto, upon condition to be made his highnesses Teceiver»general, which is like to be no less beneficial than the former. The mastership of his highness's horse hath divers competitors. Sir Thomas Howard is the most importunate suitor; and Ramsey, who is first escuyer to the prince, thinks it great wrong if he do not enjoy it. In the bedchamber, you know there are already two, Sir Robert Carey and Sir James Fullerton (age 50): David Murray sues to be the third, hoping by that means to recover himself of what he is so much cast behind in, having made a very weak and uncertain estate unto himself, notwithstanding all his former service. But he is like to meet with difficulty enough before be obtain it, notwithstanding all the furtherance he finds from Mr. Murray, his kinsman.\n\nAmong the grooms, Sandilands began the suit first, and had procured the king's grant for his present entrance into that charge: but this giving occasion to Gibb and Ramsey to do the like, their importunity hath been a means to revoke and cross that which the other made sure reckoning to have before fully effected for himself.\n\nThe first day of this next month the prince begins to keep house at Richmond, where Sir Arthur Mainwaring (age 33) and Sir Edward Varnam (age 23) (so I think they call him, for I am a bad treasurer-up of names) are like to exercise their former places, though they both sue to exchange them with being gentlemen of the privy-chamber. Mr. Alexander likewise shall be pat again into the possession of his. So shall Mr. Peter Newton and his fellow Shaw also. Few others shall be admitted above stairs at this present; and for them below, the first clerks in every office shall execute their proper charge as before.\n\nThe great places of the court are not yet disposed of. The manifest faction which is between the family of the Howards on the one side, and the Earl of Southampton (age 39) and Viscount Rochester (age 26) on the other, is supposed to be the cause thereof. For the treasurership, the general voice confers it still upon Northampton (age 73), as it did that of the secretaryship upon Sir Harry Neville; though, for this latter, I suppose his hopes quite dashed; for merely depending upon my Lord Rochester (age 26), he wants not opposition; and then, besides, Overbury (age 32) being fallen into disgrace3, he is thereby deprived of his best instrument. The most likely man to carry it, in the judgment of those who are not al- together unacquainted with those businesses, is Sir Charles Cornwallis, late treasurer to the prince deceased, who is reported very sufficient for foreign affairs: and with him it is thought shall be joined Sir Thomas Luke, though in a far meaner condition than were their predecessors, by reason of the lord treasurer's present greatness.\n\nThere hath lately come forth a proclamation against one Cotton, a west-country gentleman and a great recusant, charging him with high treason against the king and State, for having published a very scandalous and railing book against his majesty; and promising a very large reward to whosoever could apprehend him and bring him in. At the very self-same time, this Cotton being to cross the Thames, and inquiring of the watermen what news, they, not know- ing the man, told him what was newly happened concern- ing himself. Whereupon being landed, he muffled himself in his cloak, thinking thereby to pass unknown to any of his acquaintance that he might haply meet. But he had not passed thence many paces, when one Maine, a follower sometimes of the late Lord of Devonshire, and a sure friend of his meeting him in the street and discovering well what he was, [warned] him likewise of danger, with protestation nevertheless not to make any benefit of the discovery of his friend, but wishing him to provide for his own safety. Thereupon Cotton demanding his opinion what he thought fittest to be done, he advised him to submit himself to the king's mercy: whose counsel he followed, and presently went and surrendered himself into my Lord of South* ampton's hands, and so rests at his majesty's mercy.\n\nYour brother Newton (age 33), Mr. Southcot, and one Mr. Wood, have all, jointly together, lately obtained letters-patents for the putting in practice of an invention of the said Wood's, who by steeping all kind of com and grain in a certain liquor, undertakes thereby to render it more fruitful with five shillings' cost, than would ever have been before done with forty. They are now very busy in projecting a course for the [spread]ing of it throughout the realm, and hope to reap no small profit and advantage by it. When that is settled, your brother meaneth to make a journey to Durham4, whither Sir Thomas Grantham and his lady purpose to accompany him. He despatches away before great store of provision by sea, both of wine, beer, and divers other commodities, and means to be at the charge of a very honourable entertainment. Only Mrs. Newton stays behind, being hindered by a very happy occasion, finding herself quick with child.\n\nSir Thomas Mildmay5 keeps Whitehall close, not daring to venture abroad, for Sir John Wentworth's debt. He intends [to sell] Moulsham away shortly, and so to procure his own liberty.\n\nAbout four or five days since, the Duke of Savoy's (age 51) ambassador took his leave, who hath been here honoured with a very royal entertainment. The occasion of his ambassage, I suppose, is well enough known unto you, namely, to treat of a second motion of marriage between our prince and one of the daughters of Savoy. His offers are very great, and such as none other cometh near to. His wars upon the Duke of Mantua do, in a manner, furnish the whole subject to the Frenchmen's discourse. To write anything of them, I hold it needless; for, being much nearer, you cannot but understand those things likewise, much better than myself. Only I shall, in a word or two, inform you in how doubtful a deliberation the state of France stands, touching those affairs. The Prince of Conde (age 24) and the Duke of Bouillon press both very earnestly for the relief of the Mantuan against the Savoyard. The Duke d'Espemon, on the contrary, travaileth all he may to overthrow and hinder it. And not long since, this point being debated in open council. Monsieur le Prince, in the heat of his contestation with the said duke, spared not to tell him that there was now carried so much respect to the affairs of Spain, as in the mean time they quite forgot that natural affection which they owed unto France, threatening therewithal that, in case they continued to reject the wholesome counsel which he gave in a matter of that importance, he would go and make his protestations to the Court of Parliament. It is that which keeps the adverse part somewhat in bridle, though yet the queen seems rather inclined to authorize the advice of the others than his. For, as touching the little aid which the Chevalier de Guise hath lately carried over, it is rather by permission than any commission from the queen, and is wholly composed of mere voluntaries.\n\nThe Duke de Vendome having lately retired himself from court to a certain house of his, not far from Paris upon a discontentment taken in the behalf and favour of the Prince of Conde (age 24), and there threatening never to return again so long as the regency of this queen lasteth; the queen, being advertised thereof presently, sent and con- fined him to his house. But the said duke, not able to brook any such confinement, contrary to the queen's in- junction, made a journey into Bretagne, and there put himself into a very strong castle, named Ansenis. Where- upon, the queen presently despatched Monsieur de la Yarenne towards him, to command him to return; and, in case of his refusal, threatened to deprive him of his goyemment. The duke thereto made a very humble and submissive answer, yet no way disposes himself to obey her commandment Hereupon, the queen hath renewed it a second time by letters; but these are thought will as little avail as the former. And yet, nevertheless, the Prince of Conde (age 24), employing himself very earnestly in favour of the said duke, it is not like that there will be any rigorous proceeding against him, as is threatened.\n\nNote 1. Adam Newton, Esq (age 33). He is styled by Dr. Thomas Smith, \"Vitre quorandam eruditise et illost. virorim,\" printed in 4to., in 1707, vir elegantissimi ingenii.\"\n\nNote 2. This appears to refer to Mr. Thomas Murray, who was tutor to the Duke of York, Charles I (age 12).\n\nNote 3. He had ventored to remonstrate with the favourite (age 26) respecting his intimacy with the Countess of Essex (age 23).\n\nNote 4. See the letter of August 12. Mr. Newton (age 33) was, as we have stated, Dean of Durham, though a layman: such an appointment being allowable at this period.\n\nNote 5. Knighted by King James I., at his majesty's arrival at Whitehall from Scotland, July 23, 1603, and created a baronet, Jane 29, 1611.\n\nPepy's Diary. 24 Jun 1666. But he did adde (as the Catholiques call 'le secret de la Masse'), that Sir Edward Spragge (age 46)-who had even in Sir Christopher Mings's (deceased) time put in to be the great favourite of the Prince, but much more now had a mind to be the great man with him, and to that end had a mind to have the Prince at a distance from the Duke of Albemarle (age 57), that they might be doing something alone-did, as he believed, put on this business of dividing the fleete, and that thence it came1. He tells me as to the business of intelligence, the want whereof the world did complain much of, that for that it was not his business, and as he was therefore to have no share in the blame, so he would not meddle to lay it any where else. That De Ruyter (age 59) was ordered by the States not to make it his business to come into much danger, but to preserve himself as much as was fit out of harm's way, to be able to direct the fleete. He do, I perceive, with some violence, forbear saying any thing to the reproach of the Duke of Albemarle (age 57); but, contrarily, speaks much of his courage; but I do as plainly see that he do not like the Duke of Albemarle's (age 57) proceedings, but, contrarily, is displeased therewith. And he do plainly diminish the commanders put in by the Duke, and do lessen the miscarriages of any that have been removed by him. He concurs with me, that the next bout will be a fatal one to one side or other, because, if we be beaten, we shall not be able to set out our fleete again. He do confess with me that the hearts of our seamen are much saddened; and for that reason, among others, wishes Sir Christopher Mings (deceased) was alive, who might inspire courage and spirit into them. Speaking of Holmes, how great a man he is, and that he do for the present, and hath done all the voyage, kept himself in good order and within bounds; but, says he, a cat will be a cat still, and some time or other out his humour must break again. He do not disowne but that the dividing of the fleete upon the presumptions that were then had (which, I suppose, was the French fleete being come this way), was a good resolution. Having had all this discourse, he and I back to White Hall; and there I left him, being [in] a little doubt whether I had behaved myself in my discourse with the policy and circumspection which ought to be used to so great a courtier as he is, and so wise and factious a man, and by water home, and so, after supper, to bed.\n\nNote 1. This division of the fleet was the original cause of the disaster, and at a later period the enemies of Clarendon charged him with having advised this action, but Coventry's communication to Pepys in the text completely exonerates Clarendon.\n\nPepy's Diary. 24 Jun 1667. He tells me, speaking of the horrid effeminacy of the King (age 37), that the King (age 37) hath taken ten times more care and pains in making friends between my Baroness Castlemayne (age 26) and Mrs. Stewart (age 19), when they have fallen out, than ever he did to save his kingdom; nay, that upon any falling out between my Baroness Castlemayne's (age 26) nurse and her woman, my Lady hath often said she would make the King (age 37) to make them friends, and they would be friends and be quiet; which the King (age 37) hath been fain to do: that the King (age 37) is, at this day, every night in Hyde Park with the Duchesse of Monmouth (age 16), or with my Baroness Castlemaine's (age 26): that he [Povy (age 53)] is concerned of late by my Lord Arlington (age 49) in the looking after some buildings that he is about in Norfolke, where my Lord is laying out a great deal of money; and that he, Mr. Povy (age 53), considering the unsafeness of laying out money at such a time as this, and, besides, the enviousness of the particular county, as well as all the Kingdom, to find him building and employing workmen, while all the ordinary people of the country are carried down to the seasides for securing the land, he thought it becoming him to go to my Lord Arlington (age 49) (Sir Thomas Clifford (age 36) by), and give it as his advice to hold his hands a little; but my Lord would not, but would have him go on, and so Sir Thomas Clifford (age 36) advised also, which one would think, if he were a statesman worth a fart should be a sign of his foreseeing that all shall do well. But I do forbear concluding any such thing from them. He tells me that there is not so great confidence between any two men of power in the nation at this day, that he knows of, as between my Lord Arlington (age 49) and Sir Thomas Clifford (age 36); and that it arises by accident only, there being no relation nor acquaintance between them, but only Sir Thomas Clifford's (age 36) coming to him, and applying himself to him for favours, when he come first up to town to be a Parliament-man. He tells me that he do not think there is anything in the world for us possibly to be saved by but the King of France's (age 28) generousnesse to stand by us against the Dutch, and getting us a tolerable peace, it may be, upon our giving him Tangier and the islands he hath taken, and other things he shall please to ask. He confirms me in the several grounds I have conceived of fearing that we shall shortly fall into mutinys and outrages among ourselves, and that therefore he, as a Treasurer, and therefore much more myself, I say, as being not only a Treasurer but an officer of the Navy, on whom, for all the world knows, the faults of all our evils are to be laid, do fear to be seized on by some rude hands as having money to answer for, which will make me the more desirous to get off of this Treasurership as soon as I can, as I had before in my mind resolved.\n\nWith Mounted Infantry in Tibet by W J Ottley Chapter 9. Colonel Hogge rejoined the General's column on the 24th, and the march to Gyantse was resumed on the 25th, and this accounts for the delay in arriving. When we returned to Gyantse on the evening of the 25th, and reported to Colonel Brander the state of affairs, he decided to take out his flying column and co-operate with the General in the capture of Naini next day. He started early next morning, and took his four guns and infantry up the enormous heights overlooking Naini from the Gyantse side, and sent the 1st Mounted Infantry up the ordinary road to block that line of escape. The General's force arriving from the other direction at 9 A.M., the 900 Tibetans were hemmed in on all sides in Naini. The action was opened by Captain Peterson, commanding the advanced guard, composed of the 2nd Mounted Infantry, twenty-one of the 1st, and fifty of the 40th Pathans. They all went at it with a will, and cleared the Tibetans out of several of the outlying houses; but it was soon seen that the thirty-foot wall of Naini monastery required some shelling and guncotton before they could get in. They also found that the village between Naini and the river was strongly held. A company of the 23rd and a company of the 32nd cleared the village, all except one house, which was so strongly barricaded that, although the men of the 23rd were endeavouring to make a hole in the wall with their bayonets, without guncotton they could not get in, and had to retire to give the artillery an opportunity of battering it. Here the 23rd lost two men killed and two wounded, and Lieutenant Turnbull, of that regiment, greatly distinguished himself in carrying a wounded man to a place of safety. The Tibetans in this house behaved splendidly, and although battered with seven-pounder shells from 250 yards, did not cease fire till the guns had knocked down most of the front face of the house. They lay low in the house till late in the evening, but could not resist firing at the rear guard as it was passing, killing one of the Gurkhas. The rear guard immediately stormed the house and burnt part of it; but when they had marched on about 500 yards, the original Tibetans in the house came to life again and fired away as well as ever. Meanwhile, Colonel Brander's guns from the heights, and the other four guns of No. 7 Mountain Battery which had arrived with the General, shelled the monastery, and taking the Tibetans in reverse drove them from their loopholes. The 40th Pathans, having worked up to the back wall, found a ladder in position by which they made their entry. The Mounted Infantry, the 23rd, and 32nd broke in the main gate, and then the hardest of the fighting began. The Tibetans had taken refuge in the houses and cellars, and were, as usual in those places, fighting well. Major Lye, of the 23rd, leading his men into a house thronged with Tibetans, was cut down by them, and very severely wounded on the head and left hand, and was well saved by his own men. Several houses and cellars were blown in with guncotton, and the occupants killed or captured, and now, as the whole place was occupied, the General, not wishing to punish them any further, ordered the march to Gyantse to be continued at 3 P.M."
