        "text": "On 27 August 1349 a young Sicilian infanta rode into Valencia astride a magnificent palfrey.\n\nThe 24-year-old infanta was Eleanor of Sicily, the daughter of Peter II of Sicily and Elizabeth of Carinthia. She was the second of eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood. Awaiting her in Valencia was her betrothed, Peter IV, king of the Crown of Aragon, commonly known as the Ceremonious. Fleeing the disputes between the Angevins and the Aragonese over the throne of Sicily, the infanta, who favoured the union with the Crown of Aragon, rode into the city under the protection of the guard sent by Peter IV. Eleanor of Sicily was anointed and crowned in Zaragoza on a weekday, a Wednesday, in 1352. Like her husband sixteen years before her, she wore a sumptuous red dalmatic lined with silk (taffeta) and a silk damask maniple on her arm embroidered with gold. The marriage between Peter the Ceremonious and Eleanor of Sicily would produce three boys and a girl. The two surviving sons, John and Martin, would inherit the Crown of Aragon. John I died at the young age of 45 and would be succeeded by his brother, Martin I, called ‘the Humane’. The pregnancies, the constitution she would pass down to her son Martin, and maybe the early symptoms of some illness changed the young, slim princess into an obese woman who would be remembered as “the fat queen”.\n\nQueen Eleanor always played an active role in the politics of the kingdom: her regencies in 1363 and in 1374 enabled her to exercise royal authority in the absence of the King; and her opposition to the interests of the House of Anjou caused her to become intensively involved in Sicily’s politics, working to lay the foundations for the island’s integration into the Crown of Aragon, a union which was finally brought into force by her son Martin at the beginning of the fifteenth century. In 1354 Eleanor participated in the siege of Sardinia with her own guard, and 300 letters written between 1374 and 1375 give testimony to her intensive efforts to provide supplies of grain to the main cities to overcome the shortages that successive epidemics of plague had caused in the Catalan territories. She also intervened decisively in the plot that resulted in the fall and subsequent conviction of the royal counsellor Bernat Cabrera, and from 1368 onwards she had her own palace, the Palau Menor [Minor Palace], in order to preserve her autonomy. It is well known that the Queen maintained unyielding opposition up until her death to the marriage of her daughter Eleanor to John I of Castile.\n\nUpon a royal stay at her home in Empordà, Queen Eleanor made Sibila of Fortià her lady-in-waiting. This led to an eventful future for the girl. Eleanor attended the marriage of both of her two sons, a little less than a year apart. According to historians, Martin was much the favourite son of the Queen. Martin took as his wife the Aragonese noblewoman Maria de Luna, they were less than 16-17 years old. After the early death of Maria de Luna’s father, the mother sent her five-year-old daughter to the court. Queen Eleanor of Sicily looked after her upbringing and education. Thus, the child lived in the Queen’s household in the company of the boy who would be her husband. Eleanor’s eldest son John married Martha of Armagnac, a calm and conciliatory woman. Eleanor treated Martha as her own daughter. In Lérida on 20 April 1375, the Queen died leaving her husband a widower and her three surviving children. Her husband remarried to Sibila of Fortià, a girl that was over thirty years his junior. Most of the family, including Eleanor’s children, came into conflict with Sibila.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Rich Robes of Queen Eleanor of Sicily (1325-1375) by Montse Aymerich Bassols"
