        "text": "In the last decades, the multiplications of works in the field of Witchcraft Studies made it possible to profoundly renew the approaches and the study designs of the repression of witchcraft in the late Middle Ages and in the beginning of the Early Modern Era. Consequently, research has substantially specified the methods and configurations (ideological, political and doctrinal) that contribute to the genesis of the “witch-hunt”. Research also uncovered that the repression of witchcraft could take a number of different forms depending on the contexts, the spaces studied, the sources and the aims they seem to pursue. It underlines the extreme plasticity of the accusation of witchcraft and the categories of such a crime. Hence, the conference aims to focus the discussions on three main areas: the definition of the crime of witchcraft, its different receptions and the question of its reality. The goal of the conference is also to discuss the crime of witchcraft by highlighting new fields of research and unstudied sources. The variety of definitions, the modalities of reception and the different realities that the crime of witchcraft had undergone in the late Middle Ages and at the beginning of the Early Modern Era (14th-16th centuries) will be addressed and debated. Potential topics include, but are not limited to: – Medieval and Early modern discourses and conceptions on the crime of witchcraft – Medieval and Early modern representations of the crime of witchcraft – Theorization of repression – Forms of resistance against the charge and repression – Discourses and controversies on the reality and/or veracity of witchcraft – History and epistemology of the repression of witchcraft The conference will be in French and in English. The conference is open to young researchers, PhD students, Post-doctoral researchers as well as advanced graduate students. Submission: You are invited to submit a 300-word abstract with key words in either English or French by November 30th, 2020 to the following email address: maxime.perbellini[at]ehess.fr. Please include: a brief résumé, the title of your presentation, as well as your name and your academic affiliation. Please send any additional questions you may have to the aforementioned email address. The presentations will have to be 20 minutes long maximum. Practical information: The conference is sponsored by the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS, Paris, France). It will take place on the premises of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS, Paris, France) on May 20th-21st 2021. The conference would start on May 20th at 2pm and would end on May 21st at 5pm. Conference organizers: Maxime Gelly-Perbellini, PhD student at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS, Paris, France) and at the Free University of Brussels, Belgium, Research and Teaching Assistant at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardennes, France Olivier Silberstein, PhD student at the University of Neufchâtel, Switzerland\n\nAccording to many historians and anthropologists, female deviance and authorization have been significantly expressed through witchcraft. The crime of witchcraft was charged against women, who were supposed as undermining the social agreement of patriarchal control. As a medieval delusion, witchcraft has been seen as an idea that progresses varied from cultural context to cultural context and finally stopped undergoing their most significant changes and rifeness at the time of Early Modern Period, both in the old and in the new world. Thus, the stereotypical witch image represents societies' misogynistic fear of women's deviances and evil since Early Modern England, Continental Europe, and New England. The oral and graphic dialogues and its performance surrounding the oppression of witches are competed as being the result of a dialectic communication concerning the different heights of early modern society, especially concerning the conventional scenes of the learned Christian religious and secular academic experts, as well as heterodox non-Christian faith at the ordinary people level. Unluckily, the craze of witchcraft track in seventeenth-century England, Continental Europe and New England was primarily powered by the domination of Christian religious and demonological rumors and agreements, directing to more humongous extent women, women-as-witches. From Continental Europe to Colonial New England, three types of witches can be classified: the English Popular Witch, the Continental Demonic Witch, and the Colonial Puritan Witch. The paper's objective is to discuss women as witchcraft images since medieval Europe through a documentary methodological analysis that reflects a stereotypical classification."
