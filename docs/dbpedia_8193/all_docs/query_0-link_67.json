Hospital de Alta Especialidad Dr. Antonio Fraga Mouret, México, México, 2Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, México, México, 3Orthokinetic Training Center, Cali, Colombia, 4Dental Orthokinetics Clinic, Yuriria, México.\n\nAbstract: Background and Aim: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by excessive production of collagen in the skin and internal organs and vascular and immunological abnormalities. SSc leads to temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), and craniocervical (CC) and craniomandibular (CM) dysfunction. The aim of this study was to compare each mandibular bone measurements and angles in panoramic and lateral cranial radiographs of SSc patients and healthy controls.\n\nMethods: We studied 21 SSc patients and 21 healthy controls. The associations between mandibular resorption and TMD and clinical findings were examined. Three cranial radiographs were performed in all patients and controls. A quantitative analysis of the mandibular anatomy based on cephalometric analysis and functional equilateral triangles of Tatis™ using Orthokinetor Plus 2™ software was performed. Data were analyzed with Students’ t, Mann-Whitney U, and Chi square tests.\n\nResults: We included 21 SSc and 21 controls, with 5 to 38 years of SSc disease duration. A reduction were found: in the length of both mandibular branches, right (69.01±7.50 vs 74.37±5.82 mm, p<0.05); left (67.32±9.63 vs 74.35±6.69 mm, p<0.05); left mandibular condyle (17.34±3.10 vs 20.35±2.88 mm, p<0.05); in the depth of both glenoid cavities, right (5.33±1.39 vs 6.67±2.54 mm, p<0.05), left (5.33±1.56 vs 6.86±2.31 mm, p<0.05), and in the right gonial angle (127.45±14.16 vs 118.47±5.52 mm, p<0.05). The maxillomandibular planes were hiperdivergent. The inferior functional equilateral resulted in smaller mandibles (3±2 vs 0±4 mm, p<0.05) and decreased mandibular movements.\n\nConclusions: Patients with SSc have involvement of the mandibular bones, mostly in the coronoid process, condylar head and mandibular angle that can be measured by cephalometric analysis of panoramic radiography.\n\n6\n\nREAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE OF SECUKINUMAB FOR AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS IN A PRIVATE HOSPTIAL\n\nCarlos Carneiro1, and Nuno Fernandes1. 1Hospital Particular Algarve, Portimao, Portugal.\n\nObjectives: Spondylarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease predominantly affecting the axial skeleton and possibly the peripheral joints and entheses with a major impact on quality of life. There is increasing evidence that IL-17A blockade can be effective in patients with active SpA. Our goal is to evaluate short term efficacy of secukinumab in the management of SpA.\n\nMethods: Observational medical records review study of twenty-five patients with spondyloarthritis who were consecutively treated with 150mg of secukinumab during 12 months. Laboratory and clinical assessments were based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease activity score (AS-DAS)-CRP and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). Data were recorded at baseline and at the 12- month follow-up visit.\n\nResults: The study included 25 patients. The mean age was 43 years and the majority of patients had received a previous anti-TNF biologic treatment prior to secukinumab (78%). Both BASDAI and ASDAS-CRP showed a statistically significant reduction between the baseline and the 12 month visit (p< 0,0001). During the laboratory assessment ESR and CRP showed a significant decrease (p< 0,0005 and p< 0,0008 respectively). Patients had a mean (SD) Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity index global score of 4.96 (2.5). Among patients who experienced overall improvement in AS symptoms 24% reported overall symptom improvement within 4 weeks after receiving secukinumab and 50% within 3 months. No radiographic progression from using the Modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spinal Score change from baseline < 2 was observed in 81% of patients received secukinumab after six months of treatment. Median pain VAS dropped from 8 at baseline to 3 IQR (p< 0,001) at 12 months. Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT) revealed an impressive improvement Only one patient stopped secukinumab due to lack of compliance. There were only two registered adverse events (one respiratory infection and one urinary tract infection – Candida infection).\n\nConclusion: Secukinumab has proven remarkable short-term effectiveness, regardless of the biologic treatment line. The safety profile of secukinumab was favorable and similar to previous studies in the phase III program. Further studies should be required in order to monitor its long term efficacy, safety and clinical response.\n\n13\n\nSCHNITZLER SYNDROME WITH SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE TO CANAKINUMAB\n\nPablo Finucci Curi1. 1Hospital San Martín, Paraná, Argentina, Paraná, Argentina.\n\nObjective: Schnitzler syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by chronic urticarial rash and monoclonal gammopathy, accompanied by intermittent fever, arthralgia or arthritis, bone pain and lymphadenopathy, in which interleukin 1 (IL1) has a preponderant role. To report a case of Schnitzler syndrome with successful response to canakinumab, a selective inhibitor of IL-1β.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The case of a 48-year-old male who presented with a one-and-a-half year history characterized by pruritic urticarial lesions located in the trunk and upper and lower limbs, accompanied by arthralgia and intermittent fever is presented here. On physical examination he was thinned, asthenic and febrile, with pain on joint palpation, without swelling. In addition, urticarial rash located in the trunk and upper limbs, and bilateral inguinal adenopathies were found. The laboratory showed anemia of chronic disease, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, increased acute phase reactants, and IgM monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Autoantibodies and viral serologies were all negative. A CT scan showed mild splenomegaly, bilateral inguinal adenopathies and increased bone density in the right iliac bone. A skin biopsy reported perivascular neutrophilic dermatitis, without vasculitis. The bone marrow biopsy revealed to be slightly hypercellular with dyshematopoietic changes, granulocytic hyperplasia and slight increase of plasmocytes, with no findings suggesting malignancy. Inguinal lymph node biopsy: follicular hyperplasia; numerous congestive capillaries and lymphoid follicles of prominent germinal centers that respected its architecture; no findings of malignancy. Blood, bone marrow and lymph node cultures for common germs, tuberculosis and fungi were negative. The patient had received different treatments combined with antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids, colchicine and hydroxychloroquine, achieving partial and transient improvement of rash, persisting fever and poor general condition.\n\nResults: Since patient met the criteria for Schnitzler Syndrome, it was decided to start treatment with canakinumab 150 mg every eight weeks, which showed a clear improvement within 5 days, with disappearance of skin lesions, fever and arthralgia.\n\nConclusion: The interest of this case lies in the excellent response of Schnitzler Syndrome to canakinumab, highlighting the importance of considering the diagnosis in patients with chronic urticarial rash and monoclonal gammopathy; to date very few such cases have been reported.\n\n8\n\nTRIAGE AND TELEREGULATOR RHEUMATOLOGIST - REDUCING SOCIAL COSTS\n\nVarlei Serratto1, and Sérgio Kowalski1. 1Municipal Health Secretary of Curitiba, Curitiba, Brazil.\n\nObjective: (1) To evaluate the decrease in the number of patients in the queue for a rheumatologist; (2) To evaluate the decrease in the waiting time for the first consultation; (3) To evaluate the cost reduction with medical consultations after the implementation of screening and teleregulation by a rheumatologist.\n\nMaterials and methods: Patients referred from Primary Health Care to rheumatology. Data analysis for first consultation with rheumatologist. Variables were number of patients in the queue, length of stay and costs of consultations. Source e-health of the Municipal Secretariat of Curitiba and DATASUS (Brazil). Compared data from 2013-2015 (supply and demand model) with data from 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 (triage and teleregulator rheumatologist).\n\nResults: Between 2015 and 2019, there was a decrease in the queue from 6429 to 50 patients; a reduction from 600 to 9 days waiting for the first consultation with a rheumatologist and a 41% reduction in the costs paid for medical appointments.\n\nConclusion: Triage and teleregulator rheumatologist were effective in reducing the social cost of patients with rheumatic diseases.\n\n9\n\nCONSUMERS OF PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES AND CARRIERS OF HIV IN AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE HOSPITAL IN GUAYAQUIL, 2014-2015\n\nFreddy Rodriguez Chato1. 1Ministerio de Salud Pública, Tonsupa, Ecuador.\n\nGoals: To determine the prevalence of psychoactive substances consumption and carriers of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), treated at the Infectious Disease Hospital of Guayaquil, José Daniel Rodríguez, between 2014 and 2015.\n\nMaterials and Methods: A descriptive, medical records review, cross-sectional and observational study was done. Variables documented in the medical records, age group, consumed substances and opportunistic diseases, among others.\n\nThe information was taken from the medical records of 1003 HIV positive patients from this hospital.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nDiscussion: The consumption of multiple psychoactive substances, mixed generally with alcohol, generates dependence, overdosing, diseases such as AIDS and death; this is recognized as a difficult challenge in public health. There is thus a population of high risk “hunted” for their age in the education system, which explains high school dropout rate and poor performance. Structuring preventive processes are needed.\n\nThe national studies about drug use in subjects ages12 to 65 years, carried out in 10976 HIV carriers, established an alcoholic beverage prevalence of 56,2%; higher in males (64,9%) between the ages of 15 to 49 years, while cigarette smoking prevalence was of 28,1% and the use of drugs was of 35,8% in men between the ages of 15 to 49 years. A study in Colombia established the first alcohol consumed occurred at a mean age of 15.9 and without being HIV+. Arango A., Vanegas C. (2014)\n\nThe consumption of psychoactive substances can be associated to poverty, lower educational level, marginality, etc., factors also related to HIV. The data presented do not allow to conclude the relationship between HIV infection and drug consumption. Other studies are needed to establish the relationship between them\n\n10\n\nLYME ARTHRITIS IN AMERICANS ONLY? EASTERN EUROPE’S FINDINGS\n\nAgne Petrulioniene1, Daiva Radzisauskiene2, Arvydas Ambrozaitis2, Saulius Caplinskas3,4, and Algirdas Venalis1,5. 1Clinic of Rheumatology, Orthopaedics Traumatology and Reconstructive Surgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania, 2Clinic of Infectious diseases, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania, 3Center for Communicable Diseases and AIDS, Vilnius, Lithuania, 4Mykolas Romeris University, Vilnius, Lithuania, 5State Research Institute Center for Innovative Medicine, Vilnius, Lithuania.\n\nBackground: Lyme borreliosis (LB) is an infectious disease with a wide range of clinical symptoms. Usual LB manifestations are: Erythema migrans, Neuroborreliosis, Lyme arthritis, Lyme carditis. The clinical view of the disease varies depending on geographical area. In North America it is usually Lyme arthritis, while in Europe, Erythema migrans and Neuroborreliosis predominate.\n\nObjectives: To elucidate the frequency of different Lyme’s disease clinical syndromes in Lithuania (Eastern Europe). To find out the baseline characteristics of Lyme arthritis.\n\nMaterial and Methods: We have analyzed the data from Vilnius University Santaros Clinics, Infectious disease center from all the adult patients, who were diagnosed with Lyme disease on the ambulatory setting between 2014-2017.\n\nResults: 1009 patients were enrolled. Clinical syndromes of the disease were as follows: Erythema migrans 947 (94%), Lyme arthritis 32 (3%), Neuroborreliosis 24 (2%), Lyme carditis 4 (0.4%), Acrodermatitis 1 (0.01%). Lyme arthritis was more frequently diagnosed in women 28 (87.5%) than in men 4 (12.5%), age range 19 – 80, median age 55. Affected joints were: knee 13 (32.5%), hand 11 (27.5%), ankle 10 (25%), elbow 3 (7.5%), foot 2 (5%), wrist 1 (2.5%). In 2 cases information about which joint was affected was not recorded. Monoarthritis 15 (50%) to compare with oligoarthritis 15 (50%) (hand arthritis counted as an oligo, because there was no data about how many small joints were inflamed) appeared equally.\n\nConclusions: In Lithuania the main Lyme’s disease clinical syndrome is Erythema migrans. Lyme arthritis was seen 1, 33 times more often than Neuroborreliosis, other syndromes are rare. Lyme arthritis mainly manifests in middle age women as mono or oligoarthritis, the mostly affected joint is the knee. According to current knowledge about Lyme borreliosis, Lyme arthritis is a common entity for American rheumatologists, but these data show that the disease exists in the Eastern part of Europe, only less often.\n\n12\n\nARE ANTI-RNP-A ANTIBODIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOIMMUNITY?\n\nFernando Lozano Morillo1, Óscar Cabrera Marante1, Antonio Serrano Hernández1, Miriam Retuerto Guerrero1, Patricia Lavilla Villar1, Boris Anthony Blanco Cáceres2, Rosa González Crespo1, and Luis Morillas López1. 1Hospital Universitario 12 De Octubre, Madrid, Spain, 2Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.\n\nObjectives: Anti-RNP-A antibodies are included in automated multiplex immunoassays for the detection of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) available in most centres, though a low specificity for autoimmune disease has been described and may be frequently present as a false positive in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential association between those antibodies and the development of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs).\n\nMethods: We performed a search for patients with at least one positive determination of anti-RNP-A antibodies in the absence of concomitant positivity for the rest of multiplex specificities (dsDNA, chromatin, ribosomal protein, SSA/Ro-52, SSA/Ro-60, SSB/La, Sm, Sm-RNP, RNP-68, Scl-70, Jo-1 and centromere B) using the BioPlex™ 2200 ANA screen assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and also with negative AAN-IIF, from January 2012 to June 2016. Medical reports of patients were longitudinally reviewed up to October 2019 (minimal follow-up of 3 years up to 7 years) to find out if a previous diagnosis of IMID was present, the nature of clinical suspicion that motivated AAN determination and finally if a diagnosis of IMID was established.\n\nResults: We found 310 patients with isolated anti-RNP+, of which 78 (25%) had already a previous diagnosis of IMID (38.5% RA, 11.5% IBD-related spondyloarthritides, 9.0% SLE, 7.7% PsA, 6.4% PMR, 5.0% Sjögren’s syndrome, 3.8% axial spondyloarthritis, 2.5% myositis, 2.5% antiphospholipid syndrome, 2.5% systemic sclerosis, 1.2% MCTD, 3.8% IBD, 5.1% other). Among 75% of patients without an IMID (n=232), in 76 of them (33%) we could not identify the reason for suspected such. In the other 156 (67%), most frequent reason of suspicion were arthritis/arthralgia (33.3%), skin rash (9%), unexplained neurological symptoms (7.7%), myopathy/elevated CK(5.1%), interstitial lung disease work-up (4.5%), nephritis work-up (3.2%), sicca symptoms (2.5%), inflammatory ocular diseases work-up (2%) and Raynaud’s phenomenon (2%).\n\nOf 156 patients without initial diagnosis with suspicion of IMID, a diagnosis was established in 23 of them (14.7%) but only in 9 (5.8%) it was of an AAN-related connective tissue disease (1 SLE, 1 drug-induced SLE, 2 MCTD, 2 APS, 3 Sjögren). In the other 14 patients (8.9%) a diagnosis of another immune-mediated disease (5 PsA, 3 RA, 2 PMR, 1 axial SpA, 3 vasculitis) was done.\n\nConclusions: Though anti-RNP-A may be present in healthy subjects without any underlying autoimmune disease, our study shows that a small percent of patients with suspicion of IMID and isolated anti-RNP-A+ can develop an immune-mediated disorder after several years. These findings could justify a periodic follow-up in patients with high clinical suspicion of IMID.\n\n20\n\nCAN HLA TYPE I AND II ALLELES BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF CHIKUNGUNYA INFECTION?\n\nDaniel Augusto Martin Arsanios1, Juan C. Rueda1,2, Ana M. Santos1, Jose-Ignacio Angarita1, Eugenia-Lucia Saldarriaga1, Viviana Reyes1,3, Santiago Bernal-Macias1,3, Sofia Arias-Correal1, Nathalia Muñoz1, Jose Arias-Correal1, Ingris Peláez-Ballestas4, Mario H. Cardiel5, and John Londono1,3. 1Universidad de la Sabana, Bogotá, Colombia, 2Biosciences Programme, Faculty of Medicine and Engineering Universidad de La Sabana, Chía, Colombia, 3Rheumatology Department, Hospital Militar Central, Bogotá, Colombia, 4Rheumatology Unit, Hospital General de México \"Doctor Eduardo Liceaga\", México City, México, 5Centro de Investigación Clinica De Morealia Sc, Morelia, México.\n\nObjectives: Virulence factors as well as host immune response play an important role in disease susceptibility via the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA). There are no known studies associating the presence of HLA class I and II alleles with the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in Latin America. Based on the population included in Community Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD), this study was developed to identify which HLA alleles are present in patients with CHIKV infection and their association with the clinical spectrum of the disease.\n\nMaterials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis nested in a community cohort including patients aged > 18 years. Patients from the COPCORD study who met the definition of CHIKV infection (WHO criteria and ELISA IgG and/or IgM) were included. HLA typing of HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 alleles was performed. Two-by-two tables were used to establish associations between allele presence and clinical characteristics.\n\nResults: Of the 6528-people surveyed in the COPCORD study, 548 (8.4%) were included in our study as suspected for CHIKV infection. From this subgroup, 295 (53.8%) were positive for CHIKV IgG or IgM, and thus fulfilled the WHO criteria for confirmed CHIKV infections, of which 65 were HLA typing. Most frequent HLA-A alleles in the patients’ group were A*02 (n: 25;38.5%), A*24 (n: 21; 32.3%), and A*68 (n: 10; 15.4%), being the latter the only allele associated with CHIKV infection (p=0.005; OR: 8.90, CI:1.88- 42.13) while HLA A*29 was a protective factor for CHIKV infection (p=0.002; OR: 0.10, CI:0.02-0.44). HLA-B most frequent allele in CHIKV infected patients was B*35 in 47.7% (n: 31) with significant association (p=0.03; OR: 2.01, CI: 1.06-3.86). HLA-DRB1*04 (p=<0.001 OR:5.70, CI;1.95-16.59). DRB1*13 (p=0.004; OR: 3.75, CI: 1.50-9.39) and DRB1*01 (p= 0.001 OR: 5.70 CI; 1.95-16.59) was also found to be associated with CHIKV infection. HLA DRB1*04 was associated with face (p=0.02 OR: 3.20, CI; 1.11-9.15) and abdomen rash (p=0.007 OR: 4.33 CI;1.45–12.88).\n\nConclusions: This is the first study that evaluates the relation between HLA, CHIKV infection and the development of signs and symptoms. HLA type I and type II alleles are associated with CHIKV infection, and specifically an HLA type II allele with dermatological symptoms. Our results suggest the need of further research and set a path for future investigation on genes outside the HLA system to help elucidate the pathophysiology of the CHIKV infection as well as its interaction with its host.\n\n161\n\nA LATIN AMERICAN CARDIO-RHEUMATOLOGY CLINIC FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES\n\nDionicio Ángel Galarza Delgado1, José Ramón Aspin López2, Iris Jazmín Calunga Pedraza1, Ana Laura De León Ibarra1, Mayra Alejandra Reyes Soto1, Alejandra Pérez Villar1, Itzel Zarate Covina Salinas2, and Paola Fernanda Frausto Lerma1. 1Rheumatology Service, University Hospital, Dr. José Eleuterio González, UANL, Monterrey, México, 2Cardiology Service, University Hospital, Dr. José Eleuterio González, UANL, Monterrey, México.\n\nObjective: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most important comorbidity in rheumatic diseases. This has led to the development of Cardio-Rheumatology Clinics. Objective: describe the population characteristics and prevalence of primary prophylaxis of a cohort of patients attending the first Latin American Preventive Clinic since 2014, located in the University Hospital \"Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez\" in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nMethods: Cross sectional study. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients 40-75 years that fulfilled ACR/EULAR2010 and Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) Caspar 2006 criteria with no CVD and no overlap syndromes were recruited from August 2014-December 2019. Each patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist on CVD assessment. Following the algorithms, patients who had high risk initiated primary prophylaxis and patients with moderate risk were re-stratified with carotid doppler of both arteries performed by a radiologist. Frequencies, mean (±SD) and medians were used.\n\nResults: A total of 539 patients were included. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. 64 RA patients were high risk classified using calculators. The other 31 patients with onset of primary prophylaxis were intermediate risk and reclassified to high risk using carotid doppler. CVD events occurred in RA, myocardial infarction in 8 (1.8), 2 (0.4) strokes and 1 stable angina. No CVD events in PsA were reported.\n\nConclusions: Among the patients who were referred to cardiovascular risk stratification, 121 (49.77%) needed preventive treatment with statins. These data demonstrate that there is a considerable increase in CVD risk in patients with rheumatic diseases, highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary work and prevention through the establishment of Cardio-Rheumatology Clinics.\n\n27\n\nLIVING WITH RHEUMATIC DISEASES: THE BRAZILIAN PATIENT’S PERSPECTIVE\n\nWanda Heloísa Ferreira1, Nilma Rodrigues de Oliveira2, Gladis Lima3, Iara Kobielski4, Mateus Rodrigues Alves5, and Mayari Eika Ishimura6. 1Instituto GRUPARJ-Petrópolis, Petrópolis, Brazil, 2ARUR, Uberlândia, Brazil, 3Psoríase Brasil, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 4GRUPAL, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 5Former UCB Biopharma employee, São Paulo, Brazil, 6UCB Biopharma, São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nBackground: The patient´s journey includes all experiences that a person goes through since the identification of the first symptoms of a disease. Therefore, it is crucial to understand this journey and to generate awareness that can positively impact the life of those patients who live with chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to understand the different variables in the journey of people living with rheumatic disease in Brazil, as well as its association, and its impact on different areas of the patient's life.\n\nMethods: Data were extracted from a survey containing 58 questions. It was available online for public participation. The association of qualitative variables was calculated through the Chi-square test. The null hypothesis was that the variables were not associated. To determine the strength of the association between variables, Cramer's coefficient was used. Analysis was performed on R software.\n\nResults: Most of the 1223 participants were between the ages of 18 and 54 years. 38.72% were working, while 32.34% declared being retired or on sick leave. About 60% of the attendees have taken more than a year to be seen by a rheumatologist and 48.08% received their diagnose after at least one year of the first symptoms. More than half of the participants classified their disease activity as moderate or high, did not have access to another health care provider other than the rheumatologist, and reported no involvement with patients’ associations. While the majority considered themselves knowledgeable about their disease and treatment, the topic of family planning is still an issue to be addressed. Half of the women had an unplanned pregnancy (50%, n=71) and only a minority had discussed with their rheumatologist a treatment plan compatible with pregnancy (16.2%,n=23) or with breastfeeding (25.8%,n=31). Analysis of associations indicated that the type of treatment was associated with arthritis´ impact on daily activities (cc=0.478/p=0.001604), side effects (cc=0.5/p=0.00222), and satisfaction with treatment (cc=0.473/p=0.005009). Most participants considered that their arthritis had completely impacted their daily activities in the last month, regardless of their treatment. However, in the patients’ group treated with immunobiological drugs, there was a lower proportion of low satisfaction with treatment while a higher percentage of patients reported no side effects when compared to analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticoids, and synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs.\n\nConclusion: This work indicates opportunities for improving the patient’s quality of life and illustrates the complexity of the patient journey who lives with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis and Axial Spondyloarthritis.\n\n16\n\nASSOCIATION BETWEEN C -REACTIVE PROTEIN AND NEUTROPHILS / LYMPHOCYTES RATIO WITH THE FIVE SCORE FACTOR IN TREATMENT NÄIVE ANCA ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS PATIENTS\n\nPedro Arbey Quevedo Mayorga1, Paola Andrea Perez Benjumea1. 1Hospital Universitario Clínica San Rafael, Bogotá D.C, Colombia.\n\nIntroduction: Systemic vasculitis is a heterogeneous group of autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation of the blood vessel wall as a result of activated proinflammatory cytokines in response to the presence of autoantibodies (ANCA) resulting in injury and tissue necrosis. The Five factor Score is an instrument that allows predicting five-year mortality according to the presence of specific clinical-demographic markers.\n\nObjective: Establish the association between CRP and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio with the Five Factor Score (FFS) as prognostic markers in patients with treatment naive ANCA vasculitis.\n\nMaterials and methods: Cross-sectional study. We included patients older than 18 years with diagnosis of ANCA associated vasculitis (ACR 90 classification criteria and Chapel Hill 2012) treatment naïve, being cared for at the San Rafael Clinic University Hospital in the last five years. Patients with infection, hematological disorder, and other connective tissue diseases were excluded. The information was obtained from medical records and registered as demographic, clinical and serological variables. The correlation analysis was performed with Spearman correlation coefficient (rho). The multivariate analysis by cluster analysis and principal components analysis (PCA). ANOVA analysis was applied for mean difference. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. R Study version 3.5.2 was used for statistical analysis.\n\nResults: 37 patients were included, of which 56.67% were women. The mean age was 55 years (+/- 14.9). The ANCA associated vasculitis more frequently found was granulomatosis with polyangiitis (59.4%) followed by microscopic polyangitis (37.8%). The mean of N/L ratio was 6.87 (+/- 5.98), FFS was 1.43 (+/- 0.92), CRP 77.7 (+/- 74.4) and BVAS 10.62 (+/- 6.52). There was no correlation between FFS and R N/L (rho = -0.048 p = 0.77), but we found a positive correlation between CRP and R N/L (rho = 0.56 p = 0.0005). With regard to activity as assessed with the BVAS, a positive correlation was evidenced between CRP and BVAS (rho = 0.53 p = 0.0006) but not with R N/L and BVAS (rho = -0.05 p = 0.77). In the cluster analysis, a quality of 0.83 was demonstrated for 3 groups. In the analysis of variance no association was observed between FFS and R N / L (F = 0.023 p = 0.88).\n\nConclusions: Serological variables and the FFS do not show a significant correlation, however when examining this index with other serological markers, we found a significant correlation suggesting than alternative low cost markers may be useful in the evaluation of the systemic inflammatory response.\n\n44\n\nHEMATOMA IN THE PSOAS MUSCLE AS A MANIFESTATION OF HEMOPHILIA ACQUIRED IN LATE-ONSET SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS: A CASE REPORT\n\nCristian Camilo Guzman Gualteros1, Pedro Arbey Quevedo Mayorga1, Jhon Fredy Buitrago1, and Viviana Lopez Ramirez1. 1Hospital Universitario Clínica San Rafael, Bogotá, Colombia.\n\nCase Report: 78-year-old male patient with asymmetric edema of the right lower limb, insidious onset associated with limitation for walking, no history of trauma or medication use. Other symptoms, he referred photosensitivity, oral ulcers, xerostomia, xerophthalmia and arthralgias. No medical history of relevance. On physical examination he had normal vital signs, conjunctival hypochromia, presence of an ecchymotic lesion of the anterior side of the right non-painful arm and pain at flexion of the left hip, no synovitis. Laboratory tests performed revealed anemia of normal volumes, without thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was prolonged in 97.7 Sec (normal: 26 - 32 Sec), with prothrombin time (PT) in 12.5 Sec (Normal: 10.4 - 13 Sec) cross-PTT study and Rosner adjustment index test in non-incubated tubes detected an abnormal value by raising the probability of a specific inhibitor; later the study was complemented with factor VIII levels: 0.4% (50 - 150), and the measurement of factor VIII inhibitors was performed with positive results (18 Bethesda Units). Due to the limitation of the lower limb, computed tomography of the pelvis was performed, showing hematoma in the left psoas muscle. Given the suspicion of secondary etiology of hemophilia, an autoimmunity profile with positivity for 1/640 positive antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro/SSA (-), anti La/SSB (-), anti Sm (-), anti RNP (-), and anti-DNAds (-) without complement consumption was performed. Other etiologies such as paraneoplastic syndromes and hematologic malignancies were ruled out; and it was considered that the patient fulfilled SLE classification criteria (SLICC / ACR 2012); immunosuppressive treatment with steroids was indicated at a high dose (1mg / k / day) plus azathioprine 50mg every 12 hours plus activated prothrombin complex at a dose of 90mg / kg dose; Factor VIII inhibitor levels control was performed with subsequent decrease to 8.3 units Bethesda / ml after 3 weeks of treatment.\n\nConclusion: Acquired hemophilia is an unusual hematological expression of rheumatic disease; due to its variable severity, it must be considered as a differential diagnosis in elderly patient with hemorrhagic disorders and associated autoimmunity.\n\n106\n\nDETECTION AND INTERVENTION OF RHEUMATIC DISEASES IN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN CHIAPAS\n\nLeticia Santoyo Fexas1, C. Mario Alberto Garza Elizondo1, Cesar Vidal Elizondo Solis1, Martha Mariana Castañeda Martinez1, Andrea Moreno Salinas1, Ingris Peláez Ballestas2, and Dionicio Ángel Galarza Delgado1. 1Hospital Universitario \"José Eleuterio González\", Monterrey, México, 2Hospital General de México \"Dr. Eduardo Liceaga\", México, México.\n\nBackground: Indigenous populations have a higher prevalence of rheumatic diseases than the general population; the process of seeking medical attention in indigenous communities is usually very long, due to this these patients are predisposed to late diagnosis and worse prognosis and outcomes.\n\nCommunity-oriented program for the control of rheumatic diseases (COPCORD) is a program aimed at obtaining reliable epidemiological information from the community for the control of rheumatic diseases.\n\nObjective: Estimate the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, rheumatic diseases and other associated diseases using COPCORD methodology, as well as to evaluate quality of life with EuroQ5d.\n\nMaterial and methods: Design: Community-based-cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in the communities of Chenalhó, Chiapas, México in which all transculturally valid screening questionnaires (COPCORD) and quality of life (EuroQ5d) were applied house by house by health professionals with the help of translators. Positive COPCORD individuals were evaluated by a rheumatologist for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nPopulation: patients over 18 years, who met the criteria for indigenous designated by the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Populations of Mexico.\n\nAn informed consent was signed in their dialect, Tzotzil and Spanish.\n\nA descriptive analysis of variables was performed.\n\nResults: A census of the study population was conducted, where 453 inhabitants were registered, of which 209 were adults, 126 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 116 (90.4%) reported painful joint or soft tissue/musculoskeletal pain in the last 7 days, 12 (9.5%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, 15 (11.9%) with osteoarthritis, 18 (14.2%) with regional appendicular pain syndrome, 18 (14.2%) with low back pain, 51 (40.5%) with nonspecific musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nThe quality of life is reported in graphic 1.\n\nConclusions: The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is remarkably high in this population compared to the reported in the general population (90.4% vs 25%). Likewise, the prevalence of rheumatic diseases was 35.7% being higher than reported in indigenous communities of Guatemala (8.4%) and Chihuahua, Mexico (10.5%). These types of epidemiological studies are essential to create a plan to support indigenous communities and achieve better management of health problems.\n\nThis was the phase one of a larger study; now we are studying the process of seeking medical care, and after that to implement a program of care with cultural sensitivity.\n\n273\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SARCOIDOSIS PATIENTS IN A REFERRAL HOSPITAL OF THE CITY OF CALI, COLOMBIA\n\nGermán Eduardo Puerta Sarmiento1,2, Mario Alejandro Bautista Vargas1,2, Gabriel David Pinilla Monsalve1,2, Juan David Marin Escobar2, and David Alejandro Aguirre Valencia1. 1Hospital Universitario Fundación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia, 2Universidad ICESI, Cali, Colombia.\n\nObjetives: The objective of this work is to provide data on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of sarcoidosis in a population of diverse ethnicities with a high level of miscegenation.\n\nMethods: Clinical records were taken between January 2011 and July 2019 of patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis at the Fundación Valle del Lili Universitarian Hospital. Demographic variables, initial symptoms of disease presentation, involvement of other systems, paraclinical at the time of diagnosis were analyzed, including in most cases angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. In addition, the findings in pulmonary CT were analyzed, as well as the findings in the lung or other organ biopsied. Finally, a description was made of the treatment received with which initial control of the symptoms was achieved.\n\nResults:\n\nConclusions: Sarcoidosis is more common in Mestizos and occurs earlier in men, high ACE levels do not relate to extrapulmonary involvement, serum phosphorus-calcium profile alteration was not useful. ANAs test positivity could be a diagnostic exclusion factor.\n\n144\n\nREAL WORLD EFFECTIVENESS OF SECUKINUMAB IN PATIENTS WITH AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS: FINDINGS FROM A RECENT CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF RHEUMATOLOGISTS AND PATIENTS IN EUROPE\n\nUta Kiltz1, Elizabeth Holdsworth2, Haijun Tian3, Nicola Booth2, Papa Anthony2, Niraj Modi4, Dorothy Keininger5, and Philip Conaghan6. 1Rheumazentrum Ruhrgebiet, Herne, and Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany, 2Adelphi Real World, Manchester, UK, 3Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, USA, 4Novartis Healthcare Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad, India, 5Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland, 6University of Leeds, UK.\n\nObjective: Secukinumab has demonstrated clinical benefits in axSpA patients in clinical trials. This study assessed effectiveness of secukinumab in axSpA in a real-world setting.\n\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional survey of rheumatologists and patients in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK. Data were collected online from June-December 2018 via physician-completed patient record forms. Patients receiving any treatment for axSpA were included in the survey (n=1392). Patients receiving secukinumab >4 months were included in this analysis. Patients reported current satisfaction with secukinumab treatment, quality of life, work, and functioning measures at current consultation (EQ5D, WPAI, ASAS HI). Physicians reported patient demographic and disease characteristics, current symptoms, concomitant and previous treatments, time since diagnosis, and physician satisfaction with secukinumab. Physicians also reported overall disease severity (mild/moderate/severe), pain (1-10 scale), global VAS score (0-100 scale), and BASDAI score for two time points – at the initiation of secukinumab, and at the time of data collection (current consultation). Data were analysed descriptively.\n\nResults: 359 axSpA patients were receiving secukinumab >4 months at their current consultation. Patient mean age was 45.4 years, with 25% female, 67% working full time, and a mean BMI of 25.7. On average, patients were diagnosed with axSpA 7.1 years before, had received secukinumab for 10.6 months, and for 53% of patient secukinumab was their 1st advanced therapy (specifically bDMARDs), 30% their 2nd, 17% their 3rd or more. 15% of patients were also receiving a csDMARD concurrently. 9% of patients had enthesitis, and 20% had spinal fusion. Patients reported a mean EQ5D utility score of 0.83, mean WPAI overall work impairment of 27.4%, and mean ASAS HI score of 5.4 at their current consultation. 83% of patients and 92% of physicians reported being satisfied with secukinumab. Between initiation of treatment and current consultation, reduction in BASDAI score (at initiation 6.2 vs at current consultation 2.9), pain score (7.3 vs 3.1), and physician (56.2 vs 23.7) and patient (63.4 vs 26.5) global VAS score were observed. 50.6% of patients achieved a 50% reduction in BASDAI score. Proportion of patients with moderate and severe disease severity decreased at the current consultation (mild: 66.6%; moderate: 30.9%, severe: 2.5%) vs at the initiation of secukinumab treatment (mild: 1.9%; moderate: 49.8%, severe: 47.6%).\n\nConclusions: This study provides insight into secukinumab effectiveness in axSpA in a real-world clinical setting. Significant improvements were seen across all outcomes highlighting a sustained response to secukinumab.\n\n98\n\nTOFACITINIB IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND CO-OCCURRENCE OF DEPRESSION AND/OR ANXIETY: A POST HOC ANALYSIS OF PHASE 3 AND PHASE 3B/4 CLINICAL TRIALS\n\nGustavo Citera1, Rakesh Jain2, Fedra Irazoque3, Renato Guzman4, Hugo Madariaga5, David Gruben6, Lisy Wang6, Lori Stockert7, Ming-Ann Hsu6, Karina Santana8, Abbas Ebrahim7, and Dario Ponce de Leon9. 1Instituto de Rehabilitación Psicofísica, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2Texas Tech University School of Medicine, El Paso, USA, 3Hospital Angeles Mocel, San Miguel, México, 4Fundación Universitaria Juan N. Corpas e IDEARG, Bogotá, Colombia, 5Clínica del Sur, Arequipa, Peru, 6Pfizer Inc, Groton, USA, 7Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, USA, 8Pfizer Inc, Ciudad de México, México, 9Pfizer Inc, Lima, Perú.\n\nObjectives: Depression and anxiety are common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Mental Component Summary (MCS)≤38 has been used to identify probable major depressive disorder and/or probable generalized anxiety disorder (pMDD/pGAD) in patients with RA.1 Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of RA. We assessed pMDD/pGAD prevalence by SF-36 MCS≤38 status in tofacitinib clinical trials for RA, and efficacy by baseline pMDD/pGAD status.\n\nMethods: This post hoc analysis pooled data from five Phase 3 trials and one Phase 3b/4 trial, and included patients receiving tofacitinib 5 or 10mg twice daily (BID), adalimumab 40mg every other week (ADA), or placebo, with non-missing baseline SF-36 MCS. Demographics/baseline characteristics were reported by baseline pMDD/pGAD status (SF-36 MCS ≤38, presence; >38, absence). At Months (M)3/6/9/12, SF-36 MCS change from baseline (Δ) was estimated by modeling pooled data and percentage of patients with pMDD/pGAD reported. Efficacy endpoints (American College of Rheumatology [ACR]20/50/70 response rates; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [DAS28-4(ESR)]<2.6 rates; ΔHealth Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index [HAQ DI]) were estimated at M3/6/12 by linear models, comparing tofacitinib-treated patients by baseline pMDD/pGAD status.\n\nResults: Baseline pMDD/pGAD were reported in 44.5% (tofacitinib 5mg BID), 39.8% (tofacitinib 10mg BID), 45.4% (ADA), and 39.1% (placebo) of patients. At baseline, higher C-reactive protein levels and worse disability, fatigue, pain, and sleep were reported in patients with vs without pMDD/pGAD. A numerically, and sometimes significantly, greater increase in SF-36 MCS was reported with tofacitinib vs placebo/ADA (ADA through M12). The proportion of patients with baseline pMDD/pGAD who continued to have pMDD/pGAD at M3/6/9/12 was generally lower with tofacitinib vs placebo/ADA and had reduced from baseline by 61.9–63.7% at M12. Efficacy at M3/6/12 was generally similar with tofacitinib 5 and 10mg BID, irrespective of baseline pMDD/pGAD status.\n\nConclusions: Around 40% of patients with RA had baseline pMDD/pGAD identified by SF-36 MCS≤38. Improvement in SF-36 MCS was greater in patients receiving tofacitinib vs placebo/ADA. In tofacitinib-treated patients, the proportion with pMDD/pGAD reduced by ~60% at M12. Tofacitinib efficacy was similar in those with/without baseline pMDD/pGAD. Future research using a gold-standard psychiatric interview is required to validate SF-36 MCS≤38 in the identification of pMDD/pGAD.\n\nReference: 1. Matcham F et al.

Schneeberger1, Gustavo Citera1, Peter Nash2, Josef S. Smolen3, Philip Mease4, Enrique R. Soriano5, Claudia Helling6, Annette Szumski7, Rajiv Mundayat8, Daniela Graham9, and Dario Ponce de Leon10. 1Instituto de Rehabilitación Psicofísica, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2Department of Medicine, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia, 3Medical University of Vienna, Austria, 4Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington, Seattle, USA, 5Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 6Pfizer Inc, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 7Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, USA, 8Pfizer Inc, New York, USA, 9Pfizer Inc, Groton, USA, 10Pfizer Inc, Lima, Perú.\n\nObjectives: The Disease Activity Index in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) minimal disease activity (MDA) are recommended to assess remission and low disease activity (LDA).1 Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of PsA. We compared DAPSA LDA with MDA, and DAPSA remission with very low disease activity (VLDA) and DAS28-3(CRP) remission, in patients with PsA receiving tofacitinib.\n\nMethods: Data were pooled post hoc from two Phase 3 studies (OPAL Broaden [NCT01877668]; OPAL Beyond [NCT01882439]) for patients receiving tofacitinib 5 (n=237) or 10mg (n=236) twice daily (BID) or placebo (n=236). DAPSA was determined by summing: swollen joint count (SJC66); tender/painful joint count (TJC68); Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis (PtGA; visual analog scale [VAS]); patient-assessed pain (VAS); and CRP. MDA or VLDA was defined as ≥5 (MDA) or ≥7 (VLDA) of the following criteria: TJC68 ≤1; SJC66 ≤1; Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index ≤1 or body surface area ≤3%; Pain (VAS) ≤15; PtGA (VAS) ≤20; HAQ-DI ≤0.5; Leeds Enthesitis Index ≤1. Logistic regression modelled demographic and baseline characteristics as predictors of DAPSA scores at Month (M)3. DAPSA LDA (≤14), MDA, DAPSA remission (≤4), VLDA, and DAS28-3(CRP) remission (<2.6) rates were compared at M1, M3, and M6 for tofacitinib 5mg BID, and at M6 for tofacitinib 5/10mg BID. A Kappa test evaluated agreement between disease activity indices at M6. The percentage of tofacitinib-treated patients achieving MDA and VLDA at M6 was stratified by achievement of DAPSA LDA or remission.\n\nResults: Older patients receiving tofacitinib, and tofacitinib- or placebo-treated patients with higher baseline SJC66, TJC68, PtGA VAS, HAQ-DI, LEI and Pain VAS, were significantly (p<0.05) more likely to have higher DAPSA at M3. DAPSA LDA/remission, MDA, DAS28-3(CRP) remission, and VLDA rates generally increased from M1 to M6 in both tofacitinib dose groups. At M6, most tofacitinib-treated patients with MDA, and all with VLDA, were also in DAPSA remission or LDA. There was ≥moderate agreement (defined as Kappa values 0.41−0.60) between DAPSA LDA/remission and MDA, and DAPSA remission and VLDA.\n\nConclusion: Remission and LDA rates generally increased over time in patients with PsA receiving tofacitinib. DAPSA LDA and remission showed ≥moderate agreement with MDA and VLDA, respectively. DAPSA and MDA are useful tools to measure PsA disease activity.\n\nReference: 1. Smolen JS et al.

Sociodemographic characteristics: age, sex, smoking habit and body mass index (BMI); disease features: diagnosis, HLA B27, RF or ACPA; and treatment: current BT, previous BT, time from diagnosis until the first BT and treatment without DMARD were obtained. We registered if BT was tried to be optimized and if it could be maintained, as well as the dose and frequency of administration.\n\nResults: We included 147 patients (61.2% women and 38.8% men) with a mean age of 53.8 years. The mean BMI was 28.4, 54.5% were active smokers or ex-smokers and 45.5% were non-smokers. From the RA patients, 87.7% were RF and /or ACPA positive and from the SpA patients 73.3% were HLA B27 positive.\n\nBT was given without DMARD to 32.7% of all patients and the mean time from the diagnosis to the first BT was 90.5 months; 32% had received at least one previous BT [mean number of previous BT of 1.5 (0.9; 1-5)]. The optimization attempt was made in 81 patients (55.1%) and it was maintained in 54 (36.7%).\n\nComparing patients with BT at standard versus optimized doses, no significant differences were found in most of the sociodemographic, disease or treatment characteristics examined. There were significant differences in BMI (29.3 vs 26.8, p = 0.007), having or not previous BT (p <0.001) and number of previous BT (1.7 vs 1.1, p <0.001). In multivariate analysis we found an OR = 1.13 (95% CI: 1.04-1.22), p = 0.004 for the BMI and an OR = 6.98 (95% CI: 2.6-18.7), p <0.001 to have received or not prior BT.\n\nComparing patients attempted to optimize BT without success with those in which optimization was maintained, significant differences were found only in BMI (29.5 vs 26.9, p = 0.047).\n\nConclusion: Among our patients with inflammatory arthropathy who receive standard vs. optimized BT there are differences regarding the BMI and previous biological treatment received.\n\nThe risk of non-optimization increases by 1.13 times for each point increased of the BMI, and up almost 7 times in the case of having received previous BT.\n\n56\n\nSECUKINUMAB PROVIDES SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT OF ENTHESITIS IN ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS PATIENTS: A POOLED ANALYSIS OF FOUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 TRIALS\n\nAtul Deodhar1, Georg Schett2, Xenofon Baraliakos3, Filip Van den Bosch4, Lianne Gensler5, Mikkel Østergaard6, Shital Agawane7, Ayan Gupta7, Shephard Mpofu8, Todd Fox8, Adam Winseck9, Brian Porter9, and Abhijit Shete8. 1Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, United States of America, 2Department of Internal Medicine, Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany, 3Rheumazentrum Ruhrgebiet Herne, and Ruhr University Bochum, Herne, Germany, 4Ghent University Hospital, Belgium, 5University of California, San Francisco, United States of America, 6Copenhagen Center for Arthritis Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, 7Novartis Healthcare Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad, India, 8Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland, 9Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, United States of America.\n\nObjectives: To evaluate the effect of secukinumab (SEC) on axial and peripheral enthesitis in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients (pts) with baseline enthesitis (BLE) across all Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score-(MASES) sites (N=13), axial sites [N=11; 13 MASES minus Achilles tendons (AT); AxS], peripheral sites (N=6; AT + lateral condyles of humerus/femur; PS), and the AT (N=2) at Weeks (Wks) 16 and 52.\n\nMaterial and Methods: This post hoc analysis pooled data across 4 SEC studies (MEASURE 1-4) from pts originally randomized to SEC 150mg, 300mg (MEASURE 3 only), or placebo (PBO) with BLE (MASES >0). Evaluations include mean change from BL in MASES, complete resolution (CR; MASES=0) and improvement from BL in MASES score of ≥5 counts.\n\nResults: Overall, 355 (70.4%), 58 (76.3%), and 280 (72%) pts had BLE in 150mg, 300mg and PBO groups, respectively. At Wk16, mean change from BL for overall MASES and AxS was greater for SEC 150/300mg vs PBO. At Wk16, a higher proportion of pts treated with SEC 150/300mg vs PBO achieved CR of enthesitis based on overall MASES and at AxS. A higher proportion of SEC vs PBO-treated pts achieved a higher threshold of improvement (≥5 counts) in overall MASES at Wk16. Further improvements were observed for all endpoints at Wk52 (Table).\n\nConclusion: SEC 150mg and 300mg were associated with higher mean change in MASES and complete resolution of enthesitis at overall MASES and AxS compared to PBO in AS pts at Wk16, which further increased through Wk52.\n\n23\n\nOUTCOMES OF CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH PRE-ESTABLISHED RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS\n\nMario Bautista Vargas1, Germán Puerta Sarmiento1, Nicolás Salazar Otoya1, and Carlos Cañas Dávila1. 1Fundación Valle Del Lili, Cali, Colombia.\n\nBackground: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arbovirus that caused a pandemic with cases reported in Colombia, mainly between 2014 and 2015, with an incidence of 1356 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Around 150 cases were treated at Fundación Valle del Lili Hospital, Cali, Southwest Colombia; six patients were found to have a previous diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who were in clinical remission at that time. Outcomes of CHIKV infection in pre-established RA are not reported in the medical literature. We present a case series of this condition treated in our hospital.\n\nAim: The aim of this study is to describe both clinical manifestations and treatment required by patients with RA in clinical remission and intercurrent CHIKV infection.\n\nMethods: Medical records of patients with RA who had intercurrent CHIKV infection were examined. Clinical outcomes were measured with the DAS28 score before, during and after infection. Additionally, we describe the treatment options needed in those patients to achieve disease control.\n\nResults: Five women and one man were found, with a mean age of 66 years (SD 11.9), who had been receiving low doses of glucocorticoids (GC) (mean dose of prednisolone: 4.2 mg each day, SD 1.3). Three patients received Methotrexate, two received Etanercept before CHIKV infection, with a mean DAS28 of 2.9 (SD 0.5) by the last control visit. At the time of CHIKV infection, in addition to the constitutional symptoms, they presented a mean DAS28 of 4.0 (SD 0.4), requiring more than double their usual dose of GC (mean dose of prednisolone: 8.8mg each day, SD 2.6). Due to the poor clinical response, one patient required a change from Etanercept to Adalimumab and three others started Rituximab, Tocilizumab and Tofacitinib as a de novo second-line medication. The table summarizes the findings.\n\nConclusions: A case series of patients with RA in clinical remission who presented acute CHIKV infection, are reported. Those patients developed exacerbation of their underlying disease, with an important difficulty to achieve control of joint inflammation. An increase in the doses of GC and switch or induction to the use of second-line medications (anti-TNF, anti-CD20 or Janus Kinase Inhibitor) was required.\n\n24\n\nNEURO BEHÇET’S MIMICKING PONTINE GLIOMA: A CASE REPORT\n\nDijo Joseph1,3, Ritwik Bhatia2,3, and Larry Young3. 1Jackson Memorial Hospital/University of Miami Internal Medicine Residency Program, Miami, United States, 2Jackson Memorial Hospital/University of Miami Neurology Residency Program, Miami, United States, 3Bruce W. Carter Miami Veterans Association, Miami, United States.\n\nIntroduction: Behçet's Syndrome (BS) is a systemic inflammatory disorder that classically causes multiple oral ulcers, genital ulcers, and ocular lesions.\n\nLess than 10% of patients with BS can also develop Neuro Behçet's (NB), which has a particular predilection for young adult males and individuals of Mediterranean heritage. Patients can develop headache, behavioral changes, and focal neurological symptoms corresponding to lesions most commonly in the brainstem, diencephalon, and basal ganglia. We present a case of a Peruvian-Italian male who was thought to have a pontine glioma but was subsequently diagnosed with NB.\n\nCase Report: A 36- year old Peruvian-Italian male with a past medical history of migraines presented with six months of worsening headaches associated with transient diplopia and blurred vision. Patient was hospitalized and additionally developed acute onset confusion and seizures, prompting an MRI brain which revealed lesion concerning for pontine glioma.\n\nPatient was then transferred to our hospital, and after having been given intravenous steroids, reported improvement of headache and cognitive symptoms, but had persistent visual disturbances. Neurological exam was significant for diplopia, decreased sensation on the left side of his face, and gait instability. Oral mucosa had multiple ulcerated lesions and patient revealed a three-year history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers. There were no active genital lesions, synovitis, or skin rashes.\n\nCSF studies demonstrated WBC 1, glucose 70, and protein 27. No evidence of malignancy was noted on pathological examination of CSF. Autoimmune, paraneoplastic, and infectious labs were negative.\n\nRepeat MRI brain showed a decrease in size of the left pontine lesion, with no evidence of enhancement.\n\nFluorescein angiography demonstrated retinal vasculitis. Pathergy skin test was negative for any pustules.\n\nPatient met international criteria for NB, and was initiated on pulse dose methylprednisolone, exhibiting further improvement in symptoms.\n\nHe was discharged on prednisone 50 mg daily and, after complete resolution of his symptoms, was started on adalimumab and a steroid taper.\n\nDiscussion: This case illustrates a presentation of NB that was initially diagnosed as pontine glioma. Integration of clinical history, including demographics, associated signs and symptoms, as well as thorough physical examination can raise clinical suspicion for NB in the setting of an indeterminate CNS lesion. Given the rarity of Behçet's syndrome in the western hemisphere, it is a diagnostic challenge that requires an understanding of the disease in order to guide efficient, expedited treatment to prevent unnecessary testing, treatment, and life-threatening neurological consequences.\n\n26\n\nARE THERE ANY IDENTIFIABLE TRIGGERS IN POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA? A MATCHED-CONTROL STUDY\n\nMayra Alejandra Tobar Jaramillo1, Victor Santos Andrade1, Marina Scolnik1, John Fredy Jaramillo Gallego1, Luciano Lo Giudice1, Gelsomina Alle1, Dra Valeria Scaglioni1, and Enrique Soriano1. 1Hospital Italiano De Buenos Aires, Ciudad autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nBackground: As with many other rheumatologic diseases, the pathogenesis of Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) is not well understood. Genetic factors seem to play a role. Some studies have suggested a seasonal variation, indicating a possible infectious trigger; others have shown and association with statins’ initiation. Our objective was to compare PMR patients with matched controls in order to identify possible triggers in the year previous to PMR development.\n\nMethods: PMR patients (fulfilling ACR 2012 criteria) belonging to a Health Management Organization (HMO) of a tertiary university hospital were matched 1:1 by gender and date of birth with controls belonging to the same HMO. Date of PMR diagnosis was considered as the index date for patients and their corresponding control. Electronic medical records were manually reviewed and data on infections, hospitalizations, surgeries, vaccines and starting of statins in the year previous to the index date were recorded for both PMR patients and controls and compared between them. For PMR patients, season where disease symptoms started was also examined.\n\nResults: 169 PMR patients and 169 controls were included. 79.9 % were female. Age at PMR diagnosis was 79.5 years (SD 6.1). No differences were found between PMR patients and controls regarding infections, hospitalizations, vaccines, surgeries or statin initiation in the year previous to PMR diagnosis (table 1). PMR symptoms started in summer in 50 patients (29.6%, 95% CI: 23.1-36.9), in autumn in 50 (29.6%, 95% CI: 23.1-36.9), winter in 42 (24.8%, 95% CI: 18.9-31.9) and spring in 27 (15.9%, 95% CI: 11.1-22.4) (Table 2).\n\nConclusion: We did not find an identifiable trigger for the development of PMR when analyzing data from the year previous to diagnosis comparing to matched controls. No seasonal pattern was clearly seen.\n\n90\n\nINTERFERON LAMBDA 3/4 (IFNΛ3/4) RS12979860 POLYMORPHISMS ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OASL-1 EXPRESSION LEVELS IN MEXICAN PATIENTS\n\nYaneli Juárez-Vicuña1,2, Julia Peréz-Ramos3, Laura Adalid-Peralta4,5, Fausto Sánchez6, María del Carmen Ortiz-Segura7, Aline L.

In particular, interferon lambda 3/4 (IFNλ3/4) rs12979860 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are significantly associated with SLE susceptibility in Taiwanese. In addition, the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is increased in SLE patients in parallel with the extent of disease activity.\n\nObjectives: To investigate whether the rs12979860 SNP is associated with the presence of SLE in Mexican individuals, and to assess whether this SNP is associated with the expression of several ISGs.\n\nMethods: We included patients with SLE according to the 1997 classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, as well as healthy blood donors without a family history of autoimmune diseases. DNA was extracted from whole blood using UltraClean DNA BloodSpin (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Genotyping was performed using TaqMan probes by real-time PCR and allelic discrimination plots were constructed for rs12979860 IFNλ3/4 SNP using software of LightCycler 480 system (Roche). In parallel, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from venous blood by centrifugation in Ficoll-Histopaque-1077 from SLE patients (n=78). We determined levels of mRNA levels of the ISGs OASL-1, MX1, OAS1, ISG15 and Ly6E using real- time RT-PCR.\n\nResults: A total of 164 patients with SLE and 169 healthy blood donors were included in the study. The genotype and allelic frequencies of the rs12979860 polymorphism were similar between patients with SLE and controls. The distribution of rs12979860 SNP in SLE patients was as follows: 44 (27%) CC, 83 (51%) CT and 37 (23%) TT; meanwhile, among the healthy donors were as follows 43 (25%) CC, 89 (53%) CT and 37 (22%) TT. The rs12979860 SNP was associated neither with the susceptibility to SLE nor with the development of lupus nephritis. However, OASL-1 expression levels by PBMCs were significantly different between rs12979860 genotypes in SLE patients. Patients carrying CC genotype showed OASL-1 mRNA median levels significantly higher (0.282± 0.049) than patients with CT and TT genotypes (0.182± 0.025 and 0.172± 0.024 respectively; p<0.05). Meanwhile, no association was observed between the rs12979860 genotypes and the level expression of MX1, OAS1, ISG15 or Ly6E.\n\nConclusions: Our results suggest that rs12979860 polymorphism does not play a relevant role in susceptibility to SLE in Mexican individuals. Although IFNλ3/4 genotypes appear to be associated with the expression of the ISG OASL-1 by PBMCs from patients with SLE.\n\n104\n\nOCULAR CICATRICIAL PEMPHIGOID: IS IT AN UNDERDIAGNOSED DISEASE?\n\nAndrea María Smichowski1, Victor Caputo, Cecilia Romeo, Estela Rivero, Natalia Morales, and Gustavo Casado. 1Hospital Militar Central 601, Caba, Argentina.\n\nIntroduction: Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid (MMP) is a chronic, multi-systemic autoimmune subepithelial blistering disease which predominantly affects the mucous membranes and may cause serious irreversible scarring. Isolated ocular involvement is known as Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid (OCP) and may lead to irreversible blindness if it is not treated early enough. The treatment involves the suppression of inflammation with systemic immunomodulatory drugs.\n\nObjective: To examine the epidemiological and clinical data, as well as management and treatments established for patients with OCP in the Rheumatology Service of our Hospital.\n\nMethods: Observational descriptive study of medical records data collected in patients with a diagnosis of OCP by conjunctival biopsy, referred from the Ophthalmology Service for the management of systemic immunosuppressive therapy from 2008 to 2019.\n\nResults: The medical records of 27 patients diagnosed with OCP by biopsy were reviewed. Women predominated, 62.9% and the mean age at diagnosis was 65 years (SD 9.215). The average duration of disease was 4.3 years (SD 6.384) and the average time from the first symptoms to the diagnosis was 2.5 years (SD 2.17). No extraocular manifestations were observed. The average follow-up time was 25.6 months. 67% of the patients were diagnosed and referred overthe last 2 years. The majority presented Foster Stage I. Unilateral progression of stage was observed in only two patients. 18.5% (5 patients) had associated Sjogren's Syndrome. 4 of these 5 patients had to change the treatment. 40.7% showed erythrosedimentation greater than 20, 25.9% were C-reactive protein positive, and 33.3% had polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. In 29.6%, a history of cancer was recorded.\n\nRegarding treatment, 1 patient underwent topical treatment with cyclosporine, 24 with methotrexate (88.8%), 2 with azathioprine, 1 with leflunomide, 4 with mycophenolate mofetil, 2 with cyclophosphamide, 1 with sirolimus and 3 with rituximab. The majority continues in monotherapy with methotrexate. Only 5 patients switched treatment and / or received combination of treatment. 4 patients are currently in remission without treatment. 37% presented mild adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal. No serious adverse events were recorded.\n\nConclusion: Epidemiological data coincide with previous publications. The association with Sjogren`s Syndrome worsens the prognosis.\n\nMost of the patients were referred over the last two years due to the greater knowledge and suspicion of this pathology. This enables early treatment and better prognosis.\n\nEarly initiation of immunosuppressive therapy is essential. In our experience, methotrexate is an effective and safe first-line alternative and the treatment must be scaled according to the disease’s course\n\n128\n\nINHIBITION OF STRUCTURAL JOINT DAMAGE WITH UPADACITINIB AS MONOTHERAPY OR IN COMBINATION WITH METHOTREXATE IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS\n\nCharles G. Peterfy1, Mark C. Genovese2, In-Ho Song3, Alan Friedman3, Stephen Hall4, Eduardo Mysler5, Patrick Durez6, Xenofon Baraliakos7, Jeffrey V. Enejosa3, Tim Shaw3, Yihan Li3, Su Chen3, and Vibeke Strand2. 1Spire Sciences Inc., Kentfield, USA, 2Stanford University, Palo Alto, USA, 3AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, USA, 4Monash University, Cabrini Health and Emeritus Research, Malvern, Australia, 5Organización Médica de Investigación, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 6Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium, 7Herne and Ruhr-University, Bochum, Germany.\n\nBackground: Long-term prevention of structural joint damage is a key treatment goal in the management of RA1. Upadacitinib (UPA), a JAK1-selective inhibitor, inhibited the progression of structural joint damage at 6 months as monotherapy in methotrexate (MTX)-naïve RA patients (pts)2 and in combination with MTX in pts with inadequate response (IR) to MTX3.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the progression of structural joint damage (radiographic) through Week 48 in pts with moderately to severely active RA treated with UPA monotherapy or in combination with MTX.\n\nMethods: Radiographic progression was assessed in 2 phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as previously described2,3. MTX-naïve pts were randomized to UPA 15 or 30mg QD or MTX monotherapy [SELECT-EARLY, N=945], while MTX-IR pts were randomized to UPA 15mg QD or adalimumab (ADA) 40 mg eow or placebo (PBO), with continuous background MTX [SELECT-COMPARE, N=1629]. Both RCTs specifically enrolled pts at high risk for progression of joint damage (high disease activity including elevated hsCRP, presence of baseline erosions and ACPA and/or RF positivity2,3). The mean changes (Δ) from baseline (BL) in modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), joint space narrowing (JSN), and erosion scores (ES) as well as the proportion of pts with no radiographic progression (ΔmTSS ≤0) at Weeks 24/26 and 48 were determined in both RCTs. Data were analyzed by linear extrapolation (LE) for missing data imputation and treatment switching, and as observed (AO).\n\nResults: BL demographics have been reported previously2,3. At Weeks 24/26, UPA as monotherapy and in combination with background MTX significantly inhibited radiographic progression measured by mean ΔmTSS and the proportion of pts with no radiographic progression vs MTX and PBO, respectively (LE and AO). The significant inhibition of radiographic progression with UPA was maintained through Week 48 vs MTX (LE and AO) in EARLY and vs PBO (LE) in COMPARE. Following the switch of all PBO pts to UPA in COMPARE by Week 26, no further change in mean mTSS was observed through Week 48 (AO). The inhibition of radiographic progression vs comparators was not only observed for the overall mTSS scores but also its components – the JSN and ES in both RCTs (LE and AO).\n\nConclusions: UPA both as monotherapy, and in combination with background MTX, was effective in inhibiting the progression of structural joint damage through Week 48 in MTX-naïve, and MTX-IR patients, respectively.\n\n118\n\nSAFETY PROFILE OF UPADACITINIB IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: INTEGRATED ANALYSIS FROM THE SELECT PHASE 3 CLINICAL PROGRAM\n\nStanley B. Cohen1, Ronald van Vollenhoven2, Kevin Winthrop3, Cristiano A. F. Zerbini4, Yoshiya Tanaka5, Louis Bessette6, Ying Zhang7, Nasser Khan7, Barbara Hendrickson7, Jeffrey V. Enejosa7, and Gerd Burmester8. 1Metroplex Clinical Research Center, Dallas, USA, 2Amsterdam Rheumatology and Immunology Center ARC, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 3Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, USA, 4Centro Paulista de Investigaçao Clínica, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 5Univ of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitayushu, Japan, 6Laval University, Quebec, Canada, 7AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, USA, 8Charité University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.\n\nObjective: Assess overall safety of Upadacitinib (UPA) as monotherapy(mono) and combination therapy with background csDMARDs in pts with moderately to severely active RA.\n\nMethods: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from 5 pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-or active-controlled Phase 3 trials of UPA 15mg (included in all 5 trials) or 30mg QD (included in 4 trials) in RA pts were analyzed and summarized for integrated placebo (PBO) (3 trials; 12/14 weeks), integrated methotrexate (MTX) (2 trials; mean exposure: 36 weeks), originator adalimumab (ADA) (mean exposure: 42 weeks), UPA 15mg (mean exposure: 53 weeks) and UPA 30mg (mean exposure: 59 weeks) groups as exposure adjusted event rates (EAERs; events/100 patient-years [E/100PY]).\n\nResults: Across the trials, 3834 pts received ≥1 dose of UPA 15mg (n=2630) or 30mg QD (n=1204), with no option to switch doses, for a total of 4020.1 PY of UPA exposure. EAERs of overall SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation on UPA 15mg were comparable to ADA; while rates of both were higher on UPA 30 vs UPA 15mg and MTX. Across the studies, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and urinary tract infections were the most commonly reported AEs and occurred more frequently in the UPA compared with PBO. Rates of deaths were comparable across the treatment groups. Serious infection (SIEs) rates were comparable between UPA 15mg and ADA while higher on UPA compared with MTX. Rates of herpes zoster (HZ) were higher in both UPA groups vs MTX and ADA. The rates of SIE and HZ were higher on UPA 30 vs 15mg. Rates of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) and adjudicated MACE and VTE were comparable across the treatment groups. The rate of NMSC in UPA 15mg, MTX and ADA groups were similar with higher rates in the UPA 30mg group, however the rates for both UPA groups were in the range reported for RA patients treated with DMARDs3. The age-gender adjusted standardized incidence ratio (SIR, 95% CI) for malignancies other than NMSC (15mg: 0.98 [0.61, 1.49], 30mg: 1.49 [0.85, 2.42]) was within the range expected for the general population (SEER 18 Registry 2000-2015).\n\nConclusions: Rate of SIE on UPA 15mg was similar to ADA. The rate of HZ was higher on both UPA doses compared to MTX and ADA. The rates of VTE, MACE, and malignancy were comparable with that observed in the MTX and ADA groups while also being consistent with reported rates in the RA population.\n\n116\n\nA COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF UPADACITINIB MONOTHERAPY AND UPADACITINIB COMBINATION THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS FROM TWO PHASE 3 TRIALS\n\nMaya H. Buch1, Alvin F. Wells2, Andrea Rubbert-Roth3, Manish Jain4, Casey Schlacher5, Heidi S. Camp5, Yihan Li5, Yanna Song5, and Peter Nash6. 1University of Leeds & NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds, UK, 2Rheumatology and Immunotherapy Center, Franklin, USA, 3Kantonsspital St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland, 4Rheumatology, Great Lakes Clinical Trials, Chicago, USA, 5AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, USA, 6University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.\n\nObjectives: To compare the efficacy of UPA monotherapy and UPA in combination with MTX using data from two Phase 3 trials of RA patients with an inadequate response (IR) to prior MTX therapy.\n\nMethods: In SELECT-MONOTHERAPY, 648 MTX-IR patients were randomized to receive UPA 15 mg or 30 mg monotherapy once daily (QD), or continue with MTX monotherapy (cMTX; given as a blinded study drug), for 14 weeks. In SELECT-NEXT, 661 csDMARD-IR patients were randomized to receive UPA 15 mg or 30 mg QD or placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks on a background of csDMARDs. Only patients receiving concomitant MTX (with or without additional csDMARDs) at baseline in SELECT-NEXT were included in this analysis. The primary endpoints of both studies were the proportion of patients achieving ACR20 and DAS28(CRP) ≤3.2. Additional endpoints included ACR50/70, DAS28(CRP) <2.6, CDAI remission (≤2.8), CDAI low disease activity (LDA; ≤10), and change from baseline in HAQ-DI. Logistic regression or ordinary least squares analyses were used to compare outcomes with monotherapy versus combination therapy, adjusting for demographics and baseline disease characteristics.\n\nResults: A total of 1114 patients were included in the analysis, of whom 648 received monotherapy in SELECT-MONOTHERAPY and 466 received combination therapy in SELECT-NEXT. Of the patients receiving combination therapy, 338 (72.5%) were receiving MTX background therapy only and 128 (27.5%) were receiving MTX plus other csDMARDs. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the study cohorts; the majority of patients in both studies were female and of white ethnicity, with a mean age of approximately 55 years and a mean MTX dose of approximately 17 mg/week. Consistent with previously reported results from SELECT-MONOTHERAPY and SELECT-NEXT, both UPA monotherapy and UPA combination therapy led to significant improvements in efficacy outcomes versus cMTX/PBO+MTX. No significant differences were observed between UPA monotherapy and UPA combination therapy across a range of clinical endpoints, including ACR20/50/70 responses and measures of LDA and remission. In addition, improvements in quality of life as measured by HAQ-DI were similar with UPA monotherapy and combination therapy. Efficacy was comparable between the two UPA doses in the combination therapy group, whereas in the monotherapy group numerically higher responses were observed with UPA 30 mg versus UPA 15 mg.\n\nConclusions: In MTX-IR patients with RA, the efficacy of UPA appears comparable when administered as monotherapy or when given in combination with MTX.\n\n114\n\nUPADACITINIB TREATMENT AND THE ROUTINE ASSESSMENT OF PATIENT INDEX DATA 3 (RAPID3) AMONG PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS\n\nMartin J. Bergman1, Yoshiya Tanaka2, Gustavo Citera3, Sami Bahlas4, Mira Ali5, Sebastian Meerwein6, Yanna Song5, and Vibeke Strand7. 1Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA, 2University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, Kitakyushu, Japan, 3Instituto de Rehabilitación Psicofísica, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 4Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 5AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, USA, 6AbbVie GmbH Co. KG, Ludwigshafen, Germany, 7Division of Immunology/Rheumatology, Stanford University, Palo Alto, USA.\n\nObjective: We assessed the effect of UPA treatment on RAPID3 in the SELECT-BEYOND, SELECT-COMPARE, and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY trials.\n\nMethods: In SELECT-BEYOND1, bDMARD-IR patients received UPA 15 mg or 30 mg once daily (QD), or PBO for 12 wks while continuing stable csDMARD therapy. In SELECT-COMPARE2, MTX-IR patients received UPA 15 mg QD, PBO, or ADA 40 mg every 2 wks for 12 wks while continuing MTX. In SELECT-MONOTHERAPY3, patients received UPA monotherapy 15 mg or 30 mg QD, or continued MTX monotherapy (cMTX) for 14 wks. We assessed the least squares mean changes from baseline (BL) in RAPID3 and the proportion of patients reporting RAPID3 remission (≤3), low (LDA, >3 to ≤6), moderate (MDA, >6 to ≤12), and high disease activity (HDA, >12). Correlations between RAPID3 remission and remissions defined by CDAI, SDAI, and DAS28(CRP) were also assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Non-responder imputation was used for categorical endpoints, and last observation carried forward for continuous endpoints in patients who received rescue therapy in SELECT-COMPARE. Other continuous data are as observed. Data were analyzed descriptively.\n\nResults: 498, 648, and 1629 patients were randomized in SELECT-BEYOND, -MONOTHERAPY, and -COMPARE, respectively. Numerically higher improvements from BL in RAPID3 were reported with UPA 15 mg and 30 mg treatment vs PBO in SELECT-BEYOND, and vs cMTX in SELECT-MONOTHERAPY. UPA 15 mg QD was also associated with greater reductions from baseline in RAPID3 vs PBO and ADA in SELECT-COMPARE. Of note, the improvements in RAPID3 with UPA and ADA exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID = 3.84). The proportions of patients achieving RAPID3 remission were numerically higher in the UPA 15 mg and 30 mg groups vs PBO and cMTX in SELECT-BEYOND and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY, respectively. In addition, the proportions of patients in RAPID3 HDA were lower with UPA vs PBO and cMTX in these trials. In SELECT-COMPARE, higher rates of RAPID3 remission, with fewer patients in HDA, were evident with UPA 15 mg treatment vs PBO and ADA. Correlations between RAPID3 and other remission endpoints were significant (p<0.001; r=0.35–0.75) in all three trials at both baseline and Wk 12/14.\n\nConclusions: UPA was associated with improvements in RAPID3, both as monotherapy and in combination, in MTX-IR (SELECT-COMPARE and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY) or bDMARD-IR (SELECT-BEYOND) patients. UPA treatment can result in improved patient-reported disease activity, pain, and physical function in RA.\n\n117\n\nMACE AND VTE ACROSS MULTIPLE UPADACITINIB STUDIES IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: INTEGRATED ANALYSIS FROM THE SELECT PHASE 3 CLINICAL PROGRAM\n\nErnest Choy1, Iain B. McInnes2, John Cush3, Jacob Aelion4, Ying Zhang5, Nasser Khan5, Jianzhong Liu5, Heidi S. Camp5, Sebastian Meerwein6, William Rigby7, and Alexander T. Cohen8. 1CREATE Centre, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK, 2University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK, 3Baylor Scott & White Research Institute, Dallas, USA, 4Arthritis Clinic PLLC, Jackson, USA, 5AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, USA, 6AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co KG, Ludwigshafen, Germany, 7Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, USA, 8Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS FT Hospitals, King’s College, London, UK.\n\nObjective: Patients with RA have an approximate 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality and venous thromboembolic events (VTE)1,2. Among RA patients, rates of major adverse CV events (MACE) and VTE were 0.3–0.7 incidences per 100 patient-years (PY)3 and 0.3–0.8 events per 100 PY4, respectively. Here we assess rates of MACE and VTE from the integrated safety database of the Phase 3 clinical program of Upadacitinib (UPA), an oral, potent, reversible, JAK1-selective inhibitor, in patients with moderately to severely active RA.\n\nMethods: Treatment-emergent adverse events of MACE and VTE from 5 pivotal, randomized, blinded, Phase 3 trials of UPA 15 mg QD (all 5 trials) or 30 mg QD (4 trials) in RA patients were summarized into the integrated placebo (PBO), MTX, ADA 40 mg, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg treatment groups. Data are presented as exposure adjusted event rates (EAERs, E/100 PY). All suspected MACE and VTEs were adjudicated by an external, independent, CV adjudication committee.\n\nResults: Across trials, 3834 patients received ≥1 dose of UPA 15 mg (n=2630) or 30 mg (n=1204) with no option to switch doses (exposure =4020.1 PY), 1042 patients received PBO (256.8 PY), 530 patients received MTX (368.7 PY) and 579 patients received ADA 40 mg (467.8 PY). History of prior CV events (2-3%) and VTEs (4-7%) were comparable across groups.\n\nThe EAERs of MACE and VTE in the UPA groups were comparable to PBO, MTX and ADA. Approximately 40% of MACE events and 1 pulmonary embolism event (UPA 15 mg) were fatal. All patients with a MACE or VTE event had ≥1 CV risk factor (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia) or ≥1 VTE risk factor (prior history of thrombotic event, obesity, or hypertension) at baseline, respectively.\n\nThough treatment with UPA increased the levels of low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C and HDL-C), their ratio remained constant over time. Analysis of data showed no association of LDL-C increases and MACE occurrences. In both UPA groups, neither a dose-response nor a pattern of time-to-VTE-onset (23 to 1127 days of UPA) was observed. Slight decreases in mean platelet count from baseline were observed.\n\nConclusions: EAERs of adjudicated MACE and VTE with UPA were comparable with MTX and ADA and consistent with reported background rates in the RA population. Similar to other JAK inhibitors, UPA increased the levels of lipids.

Camp6, Sebastian Meerwein7, Mark Howard6, Yanna Song6, Sheng Zhong6, and Bernard Combe8. 1Albany Medical College, Albany, USA, 2Ghent University Hospital and Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, 3Kantonsspital St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland, 4Universidade Federal do Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil;, 5Charité-Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany, 6AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, USA, 7AbbVie Deutschland, Ludwigshafen, Germany, 8CHU Montpellier, Université de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.\n\nBackground: Upadacitinib (UPA), a selective JAK1 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when combined with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs).1,2 However, the efficacy of UPA plus MTX has not been directly compared with UPA plus other csDMARDs.\n\nObjectives: To compare the efficacy of UPA in combination with MTX versus UPA in combination with other csDMARDs in patients with an inadequate response (IR) to csDMARDs (SELECT-NEXT1) or biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs; SELECT-BEYOND2).\n\nMethods: 661 patients in SELECT-NEXT and 498 patients in SELECT-BEYOND received UPA 15 mg or 30 mg once daily (QD) or placebo (PBO) for 12 weeks; all patients received concomitant csDMARD(s). The primary endpoints for both studies were rates of ACR20 response and DAS28(CRP) ≤3.2. Additional endpoints included DAS28(CRP) <2.6, CDAI low disease activity (≤10), and CDAI remission (≤2.8). Patients were grouped according to concomitant csDMARD use (MTX vs non-MTX csDMARDs); patients receiving both MTX and a non-MTX csDMARD were included in the MTX group. p-values were calculated based on a logistic regression model with treatment group and type of background csDMARD as fixed factors, adjusting for demographic and baseline factors. p-values from the interaction between treatment group and background csDMARD were also calculated, to assess the consistency of the effects of study treatments for different background csDMARD type. Non-responder imputation was used for missing data.\n\nResults: In SELECT-NEXT and SELECT-BEYOND, 535 and 410 patients, respectively (~80%), were receiving concomitant MTX (mean dose 17 mg/week), and 124 and 82 patients were receiving non-MTX csDMARDs. Demographics and disease characteristics were broadly similar between treatment groups; the majority of patients were female and of white ethnicity, and around half were using oral corticosteroids at baseline. Across all subgroups, the proportion of patients achieving efficacy outcomes was higher with both UPA doses compared with PBO. There were no significant differences between efficacy outcomes with UPA in combination with MTX versus UPA in combination with non-MTX csDMARDs in either patient population. This included ACR20 response as well as low disease activity and remission defined by DAS28(CRP) and CDAI.\n\nConclusions: In this post hoc analysis, the efficacy of UPA in patients with RA appeared comparable whether administered in combination with MTX or non-MTX csDMARDs.\n\n129\n\nMONOTHERAPY WITH UPADACITINIB IN MTX-NAÏVE PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: RESULTS AT 48 WEEKS\n\nR van Vollenhoven1, T Takeuchi2, AL Pangan3, A Friedman3, S Chen3, M Rischmueller4, R Blanco5, RM Xavier6, and V Strand7. 1Amsterdam Univ Medical Centers, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2Keio Univ School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan, 3AbbVie Inc., N Chicago, USA, 4The Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Univ of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia, 5Hospital Univ Marqués de Valdecilla, Cantabria, Spain, 6Univ Federal do Rio Grande do Sul Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 7Stanford Univ, Palo Alto, USA.\n\nObjective: Assess safety/efficacy of upadacitinib (UPA) through 48wks in ongoing extension of ph3 SELECT-EARLY RCT.\n\nMethods: Patients received UPA15 or 30mg monotherapy or MTX. Rescue therapy was offered if patients met the following: Wk12-24, <20% improvement from BL(Δ) in both TJC and SJC at 2 consecutive visits continued blinded study drug with optimized background RA medications; Wk26, patients with CDAI≤2.8 continued original study drug; patients with CDAI>2.8 and <20%Δ in TJC and SJC, on MTX, UPA15/30mg was added; patients on UPA15/30mg, MTX was added. Patients with CDAI>2.8 but ≥20%Δ in TJC and SJC, background medications were optimized. Efficacy data up to Wk48 are reported based on initial randomized treatment. For binary non-radiographic endpoints, NRI was used for missing data and rescue handling; for continuous non-radiographic endpoints, LOCF was used for rescue handling. Adverse events (AE) per 100 patient years (PY) are summarized up to a cut-off date of Aug 16 2018.\n\nResults: Of 945 patients, 747 (79%) completed Wk48 treatment, 163 (17.2%) discontinued study drug prior to Wk48, 35 (4%) did not complete study. Primary reasons for discontinuation were AEs for 62 (6.5%) and lack of efficacy in 20 (2.1%) patients. At Wk26, UPA15/30 was added for 37 (12%) of patients on MTX; MTX was added for 19 (6%) and 9 (3%) of patients on UPA15 and UPA30, respectively. Cumulative exposures to MTX monotherapy, UPA15and UPA30 monotherapy were 314.4, 343.1 and 336.7 PYs, respectively. Through Wk48, patients on UPA15/30 vs MTX continued to have significantly greater improvements in clinical, functional and patient-reported outcomes. At Wk48, CDAI Remission (REM) was achieved by 33% and 40% of patients on UPA15 and 30 respectively vs 17% on MTX; 28% and 33% vs 13% achieved Boolean REM. At Wk48, ΔmTSS were significantly less on UPA15/30 vs MTX. Safety profile of UPA15/30 monotherapy was generally similar to MTX, except for total AEs and herpes zoster, which were higher with UPA15/30 vs MTX. There were 11 deaths (including 3 non-treatment emergent deaths).\n\nConclusion: UPA15 and 30mg monotherapy continued to show significant improvements in RA signs, symptoms and inhibition of structural damage vs MTX through 48wks. Only a small proportion of patients required MTX addition to UPA monotherapy at Wk26 to achieve and maintain response. Safety profile based on all exposure remained consistent with ph2 and 3 RCTs in RA, although integrated safety analysis of UPA across the full ph3 RA program will provide more comprehensive understanding of the benefit: risk profile of UPA in RA.\n\n32\n\nCLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PATIENTS WITH SPONDYLARTHRITIS IN A DOMINICAN COHORT TREATED IN THE DIVISION OF RHEUMATOLOGY OF THE REGIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL JOSÉ MARÍA CABRAL Y BÁEZ\n\nCarmen Maria Tineo Rodriguez1, Glenny Paulino, Catherine Rodriguez, Greisy Diaz, Romilda Salas, Franchezca Alvarez, Yanela Surlel, Diana Rozon, Anllely Tapia, Yamell Camilo, Piery Guzman, Idelfy Sanchez, and Esthela Loyo. 1Hospital Regional Universitario Jose Maria Cabral Y Baez, Santiago, Dominican Republic.\n\nIntroduction: The spondylarthritis are chronic rheumatic disorders that encompass a series of diseases that share similar genetic, clinical, radiological and outcome characteristics. However, disparities in the characteristics of the disease have been reported in ethnic groups and little is known about the clinical behavior of spondyloarthritis in the Dominican population.\n\nObjective: To identify the clinical, radiological, serological and pharmacological characteristics of patients diagnosed with spondyloarthritis in a Dominican Republic cohort treated in the Division of Rheumatology of the Regional University Hospital José María Cabral y Báez.\n\nMaterials and Methods: This is a descriptive, crossd-sectional and primary source analysis of the records stored between 2008 and 2018. We included 104 patients diagnosed with spondyloarthritis of both genders. The variables evaluated were sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, acute phase reactants, HLA-B27 and treatment. The data were presented in frequencies and percentages in tables and graphs. The statistical analysis was performed through the Chi square test.\n\nResults: The cases corresponded to 56 men and 48 women with an average age of 43 ± 15 years with an average disease duration of 8 years. 18.3% (n = 19) of the patients had a family history of spondyloarthritis. There were comorbidities such as hypertension (28.8%) and diabetes mellitus (6.7%). HLA-B27 positivity occurred in 45.7%. 91.3% were under treatment with NSAIDs and 70.2% with biologicals. Ankylosing spondylitis occurred in 57.7% of the cases and psoriatic arthritis in 28.8%. The most common type of joint involvement was mixed, axial and peripheral.\n\nConclusions: Ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis were the most frequent clinical forms. Ankylosing spondylitis was more prevalent in men and associated with psoriasis in women. The clinical manifestations that were statistically significant were inflammatory back pain, pain in alternating buttocks and dactylitis.\n\nKey words: Spondylarthritis, Psoriatic arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, HLA-B27.\n\n45\n\nINTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS TREATED WITH TOFACITINIB\n\nMarisel Vanesa Bejarano1, Maria Natalia Tamborenea1, Mario Goñi2, Lina Saldarriaga3, Cecilia Pisoni4, Rodrigo García Salinas5, Mariana Salcedo6, Claudia Helling7, and Adrian Salas7. 1Hospital Rivadavia, Argentina, 2ILAR, Argentina, 3Hospital Universitario San Jorge, Colombia, 4CEMIC, CABA, Argentina, 5Hospital Italiano de la Plata, La Plata, Argentina, 6IICZAR, Argentina, 7Pfizer SRL, Argentina.\n\nObjectives: To describe the course of dyspnea, spirometric parameters, DLCO and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in RA patients with associated ILD, who received Tofacitinib for a period of 12 months.\n\nMaterials and methods: Patients with a diagnosis of RA who fulfilled ACR 1987/ACR-EULAR 2010 criteria, with associated ILD, were included. Tofacitinib dose used was 10 mg / day. Design: Descriptive, medical records review, multicenter study. The following variables were examined: change at 12 months from baseline in the degree of dyspnea (according to the modified scale of dyspnea MMRC), forced vital capacity (FVC), DLCO and findings in HRCT.\n\nResults: Fifteen patients were included. 60% (n: 9) were women. The mean age was 64.4 years (± 10.92). The median time of RA duration was 9 years (IQR: 4-40). All patients were double seropositive (RF and ACPA). The median time of ILD duration was 4 years (IQR: 1-24). 60% (n: 9) of patients had previously received methotrexate.33% of patients (n: 5) had received previous treatment with biological agents. The average time of treatment with tofacitinib was 1.93 years (± 0.96).\n\n47% of patients (n = 7) received tofacitinib monotherapy. 27% (n: 4) of the patients had grade 3-4 dyspnea at baseline. Improvement in the dyspnea scale was observed in 8 patients.\n\nAt 12 months, 4 patients achieved a FVC> 80%. The average DLCO at baseline was 45.6 (± 18.84), with improvement of 30% at 12 months in 4 patients. No progression of the disease was observed in HRCT at 12 months in any of evaluated patients.\n\nConclusion: The present preliminary study was performed with patients of daily practice, not being available in all cases, the corresponding respiratory functional examinations. However, despite these limitations, none of the patients showed worsening of dyspnea, and improvement was observed in some patients. Respiratory functional examinations and DLCO, remained stable after treatment in the majority of patients, but 4 patients presented improvement from baseline parameters. Results of recent post hoc analysis suggest that development of interstitial lung events is numerically lower in patients who received Tofacitinib compared to placebo group (IR: 0.18). It should be noted that these results were obtained in patients included in clinical trials, which differ widely from daily practice patients, being longitudinal studies necessary, of larger sample size, with systematized controls of pulmonary function and images, to corroborate this hypothesis.\n\n34\n\nVALIDATION OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE-RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SCALE II (QOL-RA II) IN ARGENTINEAN PATIENTS WITH PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS\n\nTatiana Barbich1, Carolina Ayelen Isnardi1, Emilce Edith Schneeberger1, Virginia Carrizo Abarza1, Gisele Luna1, and Gustavo Citera1. 1Irep, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nObjectives: To validate the QOL-RA II questionnaire in a Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) cohort and to determine the impact of different sociodemographic and clinical factors on the quality of life in these patients.\n\nMaterial and methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out. Patients ≥18 years old, with PsA according to CASPAR criteria from the RAPSODIA cohort were included. Sociodemographic data, disease characteristics and presence of extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities were recorded. Joint count (66/68), presence of dactylitis and enthesitis (MASES), nail and skin involvement, morning stiffness, ESR and CRP were registered. DAPSA, MDA and VLDA were calculated. Self-questionnaires were administered: HAQ-A, EQ-5D-3L, PsAQoL, DLQI, QOL-RAII, GAD-7 and PHQ-9.\n\nStatistical analysis: Student's T-test, Chi2 test, ANOVA. Spearman's correlation. Reliability by Cronbach's α. Linear regression models.\n\nResults: 52 patients were included, 65.4% were female, with a median (m) age of 56 years (IQR 43.2-65.7) and median disease duration of 12 years (IQR 5-17). DAPSA m was 12.8 (IQR 6.8-21.4) and 14 (27%) were on MDA. QOL-RA II m was 6.5 (IQR 5.1-7.9). The QOL-RA II showed very good reliability (0.95), floor and ceiling effect were 0% and 3.8%, respectively. There were no missing questions. Redundancy between question N° 8 and N° 4, N° 5 and N° 7 was observed. QOL-RA II correlation with other quality of life questionnaires was reasonable (DLQI: Rho -0.48, PsAQoL: Rho -0.40, EQ-5D-3L: Rho 0.47). The quality of life was significantly worse in patients presenting dactylitis (• 4.4±1.6 vs • 6.5±1.9, p=0.03), anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 5) (• 5.9±1.6 vs • 7.1±2.2, p=0.04) and major depression (PHQ-9 ≥10) (• 5.5±1.5 vs • 6.7±2.1, p=0.04). In other way, patients who were in remission by DAPSA had a better quality of life (• 7.5±2.3 vs • 4.3±2.1, p=0.01), as well as those on VLDA (• 8.1±2.1 vs • 6.1±1.8, p=0.01). In the multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration, disease activity assessed by DAPSA was associated with poorer quality of life [Coefficient β: -0.45, 95% IC: -0.14 -0.02), p=0.008].\n\nConclusion: The QOL-RA II questionnaire showed good reliability in patients with Ps; however, the presence of redundancy was detected among some questions and it showed poor correlation with other quality of life questionnaires.\n\n82\n\nJUVENILE SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS IN TWO PEDIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGY CENTERS. 20 YEARS´ EXPERIENCE\n\nMarina Carrillo1, Gabriela Necul1, Alejandra Pringe1, Brusco Isabel1, Vanesa Cervetto1, Maria Marcantoni1, Tatiana Velasco2, Viviana Mastri2, Mariana Fabi2, and Jimena Gomez Sosa1. 1Hospital Pedro De Elizalde, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2Sor María Ludovica de La Plata, La Plata, Argentina.\n\nIntroduction: Juvenile Systemic Sclerosis (JSS) is an autoimmune disease with multisystemic impact. Its etiology is unknown and its presentation in pediatric patients is infrequent (<2% in children under 10 years, 1,2-9% in >10). Its course is prolonged, frequently characterized by systemic and progressive symptoms, which can lead to incapacity and death.\n\nDue to its low prevalence it´s important to be aware of the initial symptoms and course so as to arrive to an early diagnosis and give opportune treatment to prevent multiorgan involvement.\n\nObjective: To describe the initial presentation, course, organ involvement and treatment in pediatric patients with JSS in two pediatric rheumatology centers over the last 20 years.\n\nMaterials and methods: Observational, descriptive, medical records review, cross-sectional study\n\nPopulation: Patients under 18 years of age, with JSS diagnosed by PRES/ACR/ERULAR 2007 criteria, treated in either Center between June 1999 and June 2019.\n\nDemographic data and organ involvement were registered according to classification criteria (PRES/ACR/ERULAR 2007) at first visit, 6 months and then annually until 5 years of follow-up or last visit. For continuous variables each mean with its SD (or median and IQR) were calculated. Categoric variables are presented as absolute numbers.\n\nGastrointestinal and pulmonary involvement association was calculated by Chi square distribution curve. Kaplan Meier curve was used to describe when the diagnosis of organ involvement occurred. Statistical analysis by SPSS 20.0\n\nResults: 23 patients with JSS were included. 17 were female. Median age at initial symptoms was 8,68 years (0,33-15); median age at diagnosis 10,04 years (1,4-15,33)\n\nInterval between fist symptoms and diagnosis 16± 19 months; time of follow-up 52,9±47,7 months\n\nAt diagnosis 15/23 patients were ANA + and 1/17 was Scl70+\n\nInitial symptoms: diffuse cutaneous involvement 17; musculoskeletal 8; arthritis 8; arthralgia 8;"
