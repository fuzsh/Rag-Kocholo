        "text": "Agustín Barrios’s guitar music has become increasingly popular over the last forty years. After his death, a revival of interest in his compositions began in the 1970s, motivated by a series of publications and recordings of his music by important guitar performers at that time. The most important of these recordings came from the Australian guitar performer John Williams, who was interviewed in 1976 by ABC Television Australia for a film about the Paraguayan composer. The next year, Williams recorded a collection of fifteen works in his album John Williams-Barrios: John Williams Plays the Music of Agustín Barrios Mangoré. After this, the published editions of Barrios’s works have proliferated, many of these transcriptions of the composer’s own recordings. However, the publication of differing transcriptions has led to a lack of authoritative editions, creating a confusing situation for performers. Therefore, this research intends to highlight the importance of making critical editions of Barrios’s works based on folk music, using the Cueca as an example. This research offers an analysis and comparison of Chilean cuecas from the first half of the twentieth-century—the timeframe in which Barrios was in contact with this genre–to Barrios’s Cueca. Second, it proposes a critical/performance edition of Barrios’s work taking into account both the performance practice of traditional Chilean cuecas, and the two primary sources of this work: a handwritten manuscript and the composer’s own recording. This research does not analyze nor compares the Argentinian and Bolivian versions of the cueca.\n\nThis article examines through the lens of Chilean folk-based music how in the second quarter of the twentieth century, conservative and middle-class liberal notions of chilenidad and criollismo shifted alongside changing social and political perspectives. It begins with an overview of Chilean political developments in the early twentieth century and proceeds to illustrate how against this backdrop the conservative elite ultimately adopted a huaso (Chilean cowboy) based conception of chilenidad and worked to instill this notion of identity throughout the country as part of their efforts to quell working-class radicalism. The article also examines the shifting perspectives of a middle-class intelligencia, who in addition to advocating for more inclusive social and political reforms, began to adopt a wider notion of Chilean identity that extended beyond huaso imagery and the creole music of huaso groups. This wider notion of Chilean identity was rooted in the conception of folklore as an unfettered, unstylized expression of popular life throughout Chile, a conception of folklore that would influence the philosophical orientation of the nueva canción movement decades later.\n\nFrom the 1920s onwards, the post­revolutionary Mexican state supported intellectuals and artists in their quest to discover, describe, and catalog expressions of Mexican popular culture. Music, dance, and poetry were among such expressions that suffered from MÚSICA ORAL DEL SUR, No 12, Año 2015 ISSN 1138­8579 Centro de Documentación Musical de Andalucía 435 Raquel Paraíso University of Veracruz­Xalapa RAQUEL PARAÍSO a process of selection and de­contextualization as the state aimed to create prototypical regional traditions to represent Mexico and Mexican identity, thus narrowing the country’s actual cultural diversity. Now, with a renewed interest in both the study and performance of these traditions, some are trying to bring them back to the social contexts in which they originated and were once performed, authenticating their popular nature in shared spaces. At popular fiestas—and in more formally organized events—Mexican sones have become the center of attention as practitioners, cultural promoters, and audiences reclaim the original context of their production and performance, embracing their music, dance, and poetry to reflect a way of understanding life. Thus, the fandango has become a statement of roots, identity, and ownership of one’s culture in various parts of Mexico. The revitalization of the son experience entails a connection with the past, which brings a powerful element into the practice. My paper deals with a fandango in Huetamo, Michoacán, as an example of re­contextualizing traditions and the construction of social identities through music and dance.\n\nThis ethnographic research will allow us to enter the Hip Hop movement in Cuenca from a social perspective. Its characteristics, identities, artistic and cultural expressions will be known through its elements. Their needs will be made visible as part of the urban cultures of Cuenca, in order to understand how they influence society, whether or not they are excluded, whether or not they enjoy privileges as subjects of law. In this qualitative study, the ethnography technique is applied, whose main objective is to learn about the history of hip hop in the city, its beginnings, the pioneers of the genre; For this we will contextualize this group in the world and we will know the elements that compose it such as: Graffiti, Rap, Break Dance and Turntablism, also called DJing. This study also tries to examine the communication processes and the participation of the hip hop movement in the public space in which decisions are made on matters of interest and how the forms of participation i...\n\nThis dissertation engages the concept of resonance in order to explore how Chilean feminist activists, musicians, industry leaders, and audiences have used popular musical practices to create space for themselves and their communities. Centrally, this study asks, how are feminist organizers in Chile engaging music to mobilize artists, audiences, and industries to end patterns of patriarchal oppression? To what extent do feminist musical practices allow participants to navigate, re-sound, and re-envision the physical, social, industrial, and virtual spaces of which they are a part? By examining a diversity of feminist musical practices from the mid-twentieth century to the present, I explain how musical and interpersonal resonances shape feminist coalition-building while also reconfiguring the gender politics of social and geophysical space. Each chapter in this dissertation makes audible distinct feminist understandings of Chilean music history, spatial politics, and the patriarchal systems that shape these. In Chapters Two and Three, I examine the role of cantautoras (women singer-songwriters) across generations of political movements, specifically addressing the feminist legacies, activism, and travels of folklorist Violeta Parra (b. 1917) and singer Pascuala Ilabaca (b. 1985). The latter two chapters examine two highly distinct community music practices. Chapter Four draws on my participant observation in women’s community cueca classes in Santiago to analyze the process of “sacando la voz” (raising, drawing out, or finding one’s voice) within the urban folk music tradition, cueca brava. Chapter Five examines the history of countercultural arts collective Coordinadora Femfest and their collaboration with trans performer Hija de Perra. I explain how members have used peripheral venues and DIY performance practices to develop a transfeminist coalition building based on “sounding from under”–outside mainstream institutions and in solidarity with marginalized communities.Each case, I argue, represents a different enactment of feminist worldmaking in which sound is made into a reclamation of space, an amplification of voices, or a mobilization of power. I define feminist worldmaking as the performative means through which musicians and musical collectives practice modes of existence and envision human futurity outside the strictures of sexism, classism, and xenophobia. Based on this perspective, I locate feminist worldmaking possibilities in these practices not only in the way their artistic imaginings envision new futures, but also in the very real ways that their organizing, production, and performance actively transform gender and sexual politics within their social context"
