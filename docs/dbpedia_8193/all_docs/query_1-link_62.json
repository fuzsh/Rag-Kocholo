        "text": "Public policies are necessary to reduce the increasing public health, economic and social costs of non-communicable diseases( 1 , 2 ). Considering that consumption of foods with high energy, fat, sodium and sugar content has been identified as one of the main causes of a considerable proportion of deaths associated with non-communicable diseases, policies aimed at encouraging people to make more healthful choices have the potential to reduce the global burden of these diseases( 2 , 3 ).\n\nInformation provision has been regarded as a core policy to enable informed decisions and encourage changes in food habits( 4 ). In this sense, nutrition information has been included on food labels to enable people to evaluate the nutritional quality of the foods they consume( 5 ). However, conventional nutrition labelling has been extensively reported to be difficult to find and interpret, and therefore to be seldom used by consumers when choosing the foods they eat( 6 , 7 ). For this reason, simplified front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition labels have been proposed as an effective alternative to improve consumers’ ability to find and understand nutrition information( 8 ). Different FOP nutrition labelling schemes have been developed, which can be classified into three categories according to their ability to communicate how healthful a food is( 9 ): (i) non-directive, which provide information about the content of key nutrients; (ii) semi-directive, which classify nutrient content in low/medium/high; and (iii) directive, which flag healthful or unhealthful products. Given the wide availability of products with unfavourable nutritional composition in the current food environment( 10 , 11 ), directive FOP schemes that flag unhealthful products may raise consumers’ awareness about the negative health consequences associated with their overconsumption, which could potentially foster habit change( 12 ).\n\nThe inclusion of warnings on the package of unhealthful products has been proposed to discourage consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages( 13 ) or products with high content of key nutrients( 14 , 15 ). Evidence of the efficacy of warnings exists in the public health literature, as they have been associated with greater knowledge and increased risk perception of the health harms of using tobacco products and alcohol, as well as with reduced consumption of these products( 16 , 17 ). Warnings aim to provide information that enables people to understand the risks and consequences of a specific behaviour which, consequently, can enable them to make informed decisions( 18 ).\n\nIn particular, warnings have been recently introduced in Chile as a directive FOP nutrition labelling scheme to highlight products with high content of energy, sugar, saturated fat and sodium( 15 ). One year after their compulsory implementation in Chile, preliminary studies confirm the efficacy of warnings: consumers report having modified their food purchases by selecting the products with fewer warnings( 19 ) and sales of chocolate and cookies have decreased by 8·0 and 1·2 %, respectively( 20 ). In addition, recent research has reported advantages of warnings compared with other FOP nutrition labelling schemes. Arrúa et al.( 21 ) reported that warnings were superior to the Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) and traffic-light systems in terms of their ability to improve consumers’ capacity to find nutrition information on labels and to decrease healthfulness perception of products with high energy, fat, sugar and/or sodium content. In addition, warnings have been reported to be more effective than the traffic-light system in discouraging children’s choice of labels of snack products( 22 ). The superiority of warnings over the traffic-light system can be explained considering that the former highlights only those products with high content of key nutrients, whereas the latter classifies the content of each nutrient as low/medium/high. In this sense, research has shown that judging product healthfulness based on the simultaneous evaluation of the content of different nutrients is usually a complex task for consumers( 23 ).\n\nAccording to the communication–human information processing model, the ability of warnings to catch people’s attention and clearly communicate their key concepts play a key role in their effectiveness( 24 ). Current lifestyles do not allow consumers to take much time to select foods and to process all the information available on labels( 25 ). In this context, increasing the ability of warnings to rapidly and automatically catch consumers’ attention, even if they are not looking for them, can increase the likelihood of consumers noticing them and, in turn, taking them into account in their decision-making process( 24 ). Once warnings are attended to, understanding is a key determinant of whether they can influence people’s food choices( 7 ). Since consumers only have a few seconds to process the information included on warnings, the use of familiar warning signs can be an effective way of communicating key concepts( 26 ).\n\nWarning design plays a key role in the ability of warnings to catch consumers’ attention and to communicate their intended meaning. Through repeated exposure to warnings people learn to associate design features of warnings with meanings( 24 ). Although these associations may be influenced by culture, some warning signs are expected to be similarly understood due to the international uniformity of road signs and symbols( 27 ). For instance, a red octagon means ‘stop’ and a yellow triangle means ‘danger’ on traffic signs( 28 ). Learned meanings of warning signs can influence behaviour, even below the level of conscious awareness( 29 ).\n\nThree main design features can be identified in warning signs: colour, a shaped border and textual information( 30 ). Colour is probably one of the most important features of warnings as it influences risk perception and compliance behaviour( 31 ). The meanings conveyed by different colours are used to convey information when textual messages are limited( 32 ). Research has shown that different colours communicate different hazard information and that red colour is usually associated with the highest hazard( 33 – 36 ). In addition, red warning labels have been reported to be more noticeable than black signs( 37 ).\n\nWarnings are usually enclosed by borders with specific shapes, which influence risk perception( 30 ). Shapes largely influence people’s first perception of products by metaphorically communicating their key characteristics( 38 ). Riley et al.( 39 ) reported that pointed shapes tend to be more associated with danger than rounded shapes. In particular, these authors reported that the triangle on its vertex was the shape most associated with danger, followed by diamond, octagon, hexagon and pentagon. However, it should be taken into account that shaped borders are used inconsistently across warning systems( 40 ).\n\nWords are usually included in labels to convey information about the presence of a hazard and the level of danger involved (severity and probability)( 30 ). In the context of nutrition labelling, different expressions can be used to communicate that the nutrient content of a product should be regarded as unhealthful. The traffic-light system refers to foods with high content of key nutrients( 41 ), whereas the nutrient profile of the Pan American Health Organization( 42 ) refers to products with excessive content of nutrients. Furthermore, one of the most common expressions for indicating an excessive consumption of a target nutrient is ‘too much’( 43 , 44 ). These three expressions (i.e. ‘high in...’, ‘excess of...’ and ‘too much...’) can convey different risk perception and could potentially affect the efficacy of warnings. Particularly, the expression ‘high in...’ may raise positive associations, as it is frequently used in health claims to highlight positive product characteristics (e.g. high protein, high monounsaturated fat, high polyunsaturated fat)( 45 ). For this reason, this expression may be less effective in communicating product unhealthfulness than the expressions ‘excess of...’ or ‘too much...’. In the specific case of Chile, nutritional warnings include the expression ‘high in...’( 15 ), although the expression ‘excess of...’ was deemed more appropriate by both researchers and the Ministry of Health( 14 , 46 ).\n\nApart from the design of warning signs, their relative size and position on the labels are also expected to influence their effectiveness as they have a direct impact on their ability to catch consumers’ attention( 24 ). In this sense, the attentional capture of warnings is expected to increase with increasing size and a more salient position on the label( 47 ). The position of information about specific nutrients on the nutrition facts label has been reported to affect consumers’ attention: nutrient information located at the top of the label is viewed more frequently than that positioned at the bottom( 48 ). In addition, according to the latter authors, nutrition facts labels with a central location on the label received more attention than those located peripherally( 48 ).\n\nWarning signs have been recently implemented in Chile as black octagonal signs featuring the expression ‘High in...’ (‘Alto en...’ in Spanish)( 15 ). However, no published study has been found analysing the influence of the design of this type of warning on consumers’ healthfulness perception and attentional capture to inform policy making. This type of information is important for policy makers in other countries considering the adoption of a similar scheme.\n\nIn this context, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the influence of design features of warnings as a FOP nutrition labelling scheme on consumers’ perceived healthfulness and attentional capture. For this purpose, five studies were carried out in the capital city of Uruguay (a Spanish-speaking country located in South America, between Argentina and Brazil). In the first study, the association of colour and perceived healthfulness was evaluated in an online survey. In the second study, the influence of colour, shape and textual information on the perceived healthfulness conveyed by the warnings was evaluated using choice-conjoint analysis. The third study focused on implicit associations between two design features (shape and colour) on perceived healthfulness. Finally, the fourth and fifth studies used a visual search paradigm to evaluate the influence of colour, size and position of the warnings on attentional capture.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWarnings have been proposed in the public health literature as a way to communicate the risks associated with consumption of specific products, such as tobacco, alcohol and sweetened beverages, and, in turn, enable consumers to make informed choices( 16 , 17 , 65 , 66 ). In addition, warnings have been recently implemented as a directive FOP nutrition information scheme to facilitate the identification of unhealthful products with high energy, sugar, fat and sodium content( 14 , 15 ). This scheme has been reported to be superior to the GDA and the traffic-light systems in terms of goal-directed attentional capture, ability to decrease healthfulness perception of products with high sugar, fat and sodium content, and to discourage choice of unhealthful products( 21 , 22 ). The potential of warnings to foster changes in eating patterns has been highlighted by preliminary studies conducted one year after their compulsory implementation in Chile( 19 , 20 ).\n\nThe effectiveness of warnings depends on their ability to catch consumers’ attention and clearly communicate their key message( 26 ). The design of warning signs plays a key role in increasing the likelihood of consumers taking them into account when making their food choices( 30 ). In this context, the present study evaluated the influence of design features of warning signs on consumers’ perceived healthfulness and attentional capture.\n\nColours have been shown to have strong healthfulness associations( 31 ). Results from Study 1 showed that black and grey were the colours with the strongest association with unhealthfulness, followed by red and violet. In addition, in Study 3 black showed a stronger implicit association with unhealthfulness than red, in agreement with previous studies that reported that black colour was associated with the words ‘fatal’ and ‘poison’( 67 ), as well as with the concepts of dirt and toxicity( 36 ). Colour was the most important design feature influencing perceived healthfulness of warnings in Study 2, red being significantly more associated with an unhealthful product than black. Therefore, although black had a stronger implicit association with unhealthfulness than red, the opposite trend was found in the context of warning signs. This result suggests an interaction effect between shape and colour, which may be explained by learned associations through repeated exposure to warning signs, as red signs are frequently included in traffic signs to convey danger or risk (i.e. STOP traffic sign)( 28 ). Further research should investigate the influence of interaction effects between shape and colour on healthfulness perception of warning signs.\n\nRegarding the influence of colour on the attentional capture of the warnings, results from Study 4 showed that black signs were easier to find on labels than red signs. Contradictory results on the influence of colour on the attentional capture of logos have been reported in the literature. Braun and Silver reported that black increased the perceived saliency of warnings compared with red( 31 ). Similarly, Bialkova and van Trijp reported that the attentional capture of monochromatic directive FOP nutrition labelling schemes (choice logos) was higher compared with polychromatic logos( 59 ). On the contrary, Young( 37 ) and Laughery et al.( 26 ) found that red warning labels were more noticeable than black labels. These contradictory results may be explained considering that the attentional capture of warnings strongly depends on the graphic design of the labels on which they are included, particularly their colour and label clutter( 30 ). In this sense, one of the strengths of the present study was that labels with different background design were considered in the visual search task and, consequently, average response times considered part of the heterogeneity of food labels available in the marketplace. In addition, it should be taken into account that in the present study warnings were surrounded by a white area that could have increased their attentional capture. This strategy may increase the attentional capture of warning signs regardless of the graphic design of the labels. However, further research in this respect is necessary to confirm this observation.\n\nThe influence of colour on healthfulness perception suggests that policy makers should specify the colour of warnings. Results from the studies included in the present work suggest that black seems to be the best colour for nutrition warnings given its superior attentional capture and its implicit association with the concept of unhealthfulness, even if the red octagon was perceived as more unhealthful than the black octagon. This colour has been selected by Chilean authorities for the warnings included in the FOP nutrition labelling scheme( 15 ). However, warning labels recently proposed in the USA for inclusion on sugar-sweetened beverages are required only to be conspicuously included on the front of the package( 68 , 69 ).\n\nAlthough shaped borders are used inconsistently across warning systems( 40 ), in the present work the octagonal shape was consistently more associated with the concept of unhealthfulness than the triangle or the triangle on its vertex. This association may be explained by the learned association between octagonal shape and the concept of danger through repeated exposure to the STOP traffic sign. On the contrary, in the context of hazard perception, the triangle on its vertex has been reported to perceived as more dangerous than the octagon( 39 ). These results support Chilean regulations, which specify that FOP nutrition warnings should have an octagonal shape( 15 ).\n\nTextual information included on the labels also influenced healthfulness perception. Warnings containing the expression ‘excess of...’ for referring to unhealthful products were perceived as less healthful than those containing the expressions ‘high in...’ or ‘too much...’. The concept of excessive amounts of key nutrients (sodium, free sugars, total fat, saturated fat and/or trans-fat) to identify products with unfavourable nutrient profile is included in the Nutrient Profile Model of the Pan American Health Organization( 42 ). Although this expression was preferred by Chilean authorities( 14 , 46 ), their current law specifies that nutrition warnings should include the expression ‘high in...’( 15 ).\n\nThe ability of warnings to rapidly catch attention can increase the likelihood of consumers taking them into account when making their food choices( 24 ). In this sense, the size and position of the warnings on the labels are expected to have a large influence on attentional capture. Results from Study 5 showed that the size and position of the warnings on the labels significantly influenced the time needed by participants to identify a warning on the label. This suggests that policy makers should introduce compulsory requirements for these features in their regulations. Chilean regulations do not specify a compulsory location but suggest that warnings should be included on the upper right position of the labels( 15 ). However, results from the present work suggest that the upper left position should be preferred as it tended to have higher attentional capture, particularly in the case of the bigger labels. These results are in agreement with those reported by Graham and Jeffery( 48 ) and can be explained by the usual way of reading (from left to right) in occidental countries. Regarding warning size, attentional capture increased with increasing warning size, as expected. These results support the warning sizes included in Chilean regulations for labels of 45 and 152 cm2 ( 15 ).\n\nIn closing, the limitations of the present work should be highlighted. First, all studies were conducted in one country with a non-representative consumer population. Therefore, results may not be generalizable to other countries around the world. However, it is important to highlight that most of the results reported in the present work are based on learned associations from warning signs that are internationally uniform, such as the STOP sign( 27 ). Besides, results from the visual search tasks are based on fundamental attentional processes that are not largely influenced by individual characteristics( 60 ). Second, in the present study interaction effects between colour and shape were not studied. Further research should evaluate healthfulness perception of warning signs with different shapes and colours. Finally, the effect of warnings on consumers’ healthfulness perception of food products was not evaluated. All the studies focused on the comparative evaluation of warnings with different design features. Therefore, conclusions are not expected to be influenced by the perception of specific food products or nutrients. In this sense, further research should focus on the effect of warnings on healthfulness perception of different products with excessive content of different nutrients. Although preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of warnings exists( 19 – 22 , 65 , 66 ), further research on their effect on consumers’ food choices is needed. In particular, it remains unclear how consumers react to the inclusion of nutrition warnings on the package of their usual products. A more in-depth exploration of changes in consumer behaviour caused by the implementation of nutrition warnings can provide relevant information regarding the effectiveness of warnings as a public policy aimed at shifting eating patterns."
