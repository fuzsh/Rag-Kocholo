In future oceans, SA combined with decreased upward transports of nutrients may synergistically reduce PP in pelagic zones.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nA nitrate budget of the Bohai Sea based on an isotope mass balance model\n\nShichao Tian, Birgit Gaye, Jianhui Tang, Yongming Luo, Wenguo Li, Niko Lahajnar, Kirstin DÃ¤hnke, Tina Sanders, Tianqi Xiong, Weidong Zhai, and Kay-Christian Emeis\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2397–2415, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2397-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2397-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe constrain the nitrogen budget and in particular the internal sources and sinks of nitrate in the Bohai Sea by using a mass-based and dual stable isotope approach based on δ15N and δ18O of nitrate. Based on available mass fluxes and isotope data an updated nitrogen budget is proposed. Compared to previous estimates, it is more complete and includes the impact of the interior cycle (nitrification) on the nitrate pool. The main external nitrogen sources are rivers contributing 19.2 %–25.6 %.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nFormation of organic sulfur compounds through SO2-initiated photochemistry of PAHs and dimethylsulfoxide at the air-water interface\n\nHaoyu Jiang, Yingyao He, Yiqun Wang, Sheng Li, Bin Jiang, Luca Carena, Xue Li, Lihua Yang, Tiangang Luan, Davide Vione, and Sasho Gligorovski\n\nAtmos.

Its physiological responses to warming were significantly modulated by light, with growth peaking at 27 Â°C under the light-saturating condition but being non-responsive across the range of 23–31 Â°C under the light-limiting condition. Light shortage also weakened the acclimation ability of Trichodesmium to warming, making light-limited Trichodesmium more sensitive to acute temperature change.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nHyposalinity tolerance inthecoccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi under the influence of ocean acidification involves enhanced photosynthetic performance\n\nJiekai Xu, John Beardall, and Kunshan Gao\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-4,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-4, 2019\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA lot of papers studying Ocean acidification (OA) have been published while no related reports can be found on the combined effects of OA with decreased salinity on coccolithophores yet.Thus, we investigated the physiological responses of an Emiliania huxleyi strain grown at 2CO2 concentrations and 3 levels of salinity and found cells could tolerate reduced salinity under OA as its increased light capturing capability, which suggests a potential niche extension of coccolithophores in the future.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nPhysiological and biochemical responses of Emiliania huxleyi to ocean acidification and warming are modulated by UV radiation\n\nShanying Tong, David A.

In this study, we found that UVR can counteract the negative effects of the greenhouse treatment on the calcification rate to photosynthesis rate ratio, and may be a key stressor when considering the impacts of future greenhouse conditions on E. huxleyi.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nEffect of elevated pCO2 on trace gas production during an ocean acidification mesocosm experiment\n\nSheng-Hui Zhang, Juan Yu, Qiong-Yao Ding, Gui-Peng Yang, Kun-Shan Gao, Hong-Hai Zhang, and Da-Wei Pan\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 6649–6658, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6649-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6649-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnvironmental effects of ocean acidification and trace gases have drawn much attention in recent years and existing studies reveal that the response of communities and trace gases to ocean acidification is still not predictable and requires further study. The present study examined the effect of elevated pCO2 on trace gas production and phytoplankton during an ocean acidification mesocosm experiment.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nInteractive network configuration maintains bacterioplankton community structure under elevated CO2 in a eutrophic coastal mesocosm experiment\n\nXin Lin, Ruiping Huang, Yan Li, Futian Li, Yaping Wu, David A.

We found that the elevated CO2 hardly altered the network structure of the bacterioplankton taxa present with high abundance but appeared to reassemble the community network of taxa with low abundance. Results suggest that the bacterioplankton community in this subtropical, high-nutrient coastal environment is insensitive to elevated CO2.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nInteractive effects of seawater carbonate chemistry, light intensity and nutrient availability on physiology and calcification of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi\n\nYong Zhang, Feixue Fu, David A.

High CO2 (HC) and low nitrogen (LN) synergistically decreased growth rates, high light compensated for inhibition of low phosphate (LP) on growth rates at LC, but exacerbated inhibition of LP at HC. LN or LP increased PIC quotas and ETRmax.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nEffects of ultraviolet radiation on photosynthetic performance and N2 fixation in Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101\n\nXiaoni Cai, David A.

We conducted short- and long-term UV exposure experiment to investigate how UV affects this organism. Our results showed N2 fixation and carbon fixation rates were significantly reduced under UV radiation. As a defense strategy, Trichodesmium is able to synthesize UV-absorbing compounds to protect from UV damage. Our results suggest that shipboard experiments in UV-opaque containers may have substantially overestimated in situ N2 fixation rate.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nPhysiological responses of coastal and oceanic diatoms to diurnal fluctuations in seawater carbonate chemistry under two CO2 concentrations\n\nFutian Li, Yaping Wu, David A. Hutchins, Feixue Fu, and Kunshan Gao\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 6247–6259, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-6247-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-6247-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOngoing ocean acidification is being superimposed on the natural carbonate buffer system to influence the physiology of phytoplankton. Here, we show that coastal and oceanic diatoms respond differentially to diurnal fluctuating carbonate chemistry in current and ocean acidification scenarios. We propose that the ability to acclimate to dynamic carbonate chemistry may act as one determinant of the spatial distribution of diatom species.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nCombined effects of elevated pCO2 and temperature on biomass and carbon fixation of phytoplankton assemblages in the northern South China Sea\n\nGuang Gao, Peng Jin, Nana Liu, Futian Li, Shanying Tong, David A.

HT did not change dark respiration at nearshore station but enhanced it at offshore station. Our findings indicate that responses of coastal and offshore phytoplankton assemblages to ocean warming and acidification may be contrasting, with the pelagic phytoplankton communities being more sensitive to these two global change factors.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nThe role of coccoliths in protecting Emiliania huxleyi against stressful light and UV radiation\n\nJuntian Xu, Lennart T.

Our data show that the dissolved organic matter originates partly from land and partly from microbial processes in the water. Internal recycling is likely important for maintaining high nutrient concentrations, and we found that there is often excess nitrogen compared to silicon and phosphorus. Our data help to explain how eutrophication persists in this system.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nInvestigating the effect of silicate- and calcium-based ocean alkalinity enhancement on diatom silicification\n\nAaron Ferderer, Kai G. Schulz, Ulf Riebesell, Kirralee G. Baker, Zanna Chase, and Lennart T. Bach\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2777–2794, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2777-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2777-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOcean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a promising method of atmospheric carbon removal; however, its ecological impacts remain largely unknown. We assessed the effects of simulated silicate- and calcium-based mineral OAE on diatom silicification. We found that increased silicate concentrations from silicate-based OAE increased diatom silicification. In contrast, the enhancement of alkalinity had no effect on community silicification and minimal effects on the silicification of different genera.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nOcean alkalinity enhancement using sodium carbonate salts does not lead to measurable changes in Fe dynamics in a mesocosm experiment\n\nDavid GonzÃ¡lez-Santana, MarÃ­a Segovia, Melchor GonzÃ¡lez-DÃ¡vila, Librada RamÃ­rez, Aridane G.

This process changed the levels of certain ions in the water, affecting its pH and buffering capacity. The researchers were particularly interested in how this could impact the levels of essential trace metals in the water.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nQuantification and mitigation of bottom-trawling impacts on sedimentary organic carbon stocks in the North Sea\n\nLucas Porz, Wenyan Zhang, Nils Christiansen, Jan Kossack, Ute Daewel, and Corinna Schrum\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2547–2570, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2547-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2547-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeafloor sediments store a large amount of carbon, helping to naturally regulate Earth's climate. If disturbed, some sediment particles can turn into CO2, but this effect is not well understood. Using computer simulations, we found that bottom-contacting fishing gears release about 1 million tons of CO2 per year in the North Sea, one of the most heavily fished regions globally. We show how protecting certain areas could reduce these emissions while also benefitting seafloor-living animals.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nInfluence of ocean alkalinity enhancement with olivine or steel slag on a coastal plankton community in Tasmania\n\nJiaying A. Guo, Robert F. Strzepek, Kerrie M. Swadling, Ashley T. Townsend, and Lennart T. Bach\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2335–2354, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2335-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2335-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOcean alkalinity enhancement aims to increase atmospheric CO2 sequestration by adding alkaline materials to the ocean. We assessed the environmental effects of olivine and steel slag powder on coastal plankton. Overall, slag is more efficient than olivine in releasing total alkalinity and, thus, in its ability to sequester CO2. Slag also had less environmental effect on the enclosed plankton communities when considering its higher CO2 removal potential based on this 3-week experiment.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nMulti-model comparison of trends and controls of near-bed oxygen concentration on the northwest European continental shelf under climate change\n\nGiovanni Galli, Sarah Wakelin, James Harle, Jason Holt, and Yuri Artioli\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 2143–2158, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2143-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2143-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work shows that, under a high-emission scenario, oxygen concentration in deep water of parts of the North Sea and Celtic Sea can become critically low (hypoxia) towards the end of this century. The extent and frequency of hypoxia depends on the intensity of climate change projected by different climate models. This is the result of a complex combination of factors like warming, increase in stratification, changes in the currents and changes in biological processes.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nPicoplanktonic methane production in eutrophic surface waters\n\nSandy E.

We have identified the crucial role of picoplankton (> 3 µm) in CH4 recycling, especially with the addition of methylated substrates (trimethylamine and methylphosphonic acid) during upwelling and non-upwelling periods. These insights improve understanding of surface ocean CH4 recycling, aiding CH4 emission estimates.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nVertical mixing alleviates autumnal oxygen deficiency in the central North Sea\n\nCharlotte A.

The risk of O2 loss in the productive coastal/continental slope regions is increasing. Autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with O2 optodes provide lots of data but have problems resolving strong vertical O2 changes. Here we show how to overcome this and calculate how much O2 is supplied to the low-O2 bottom waters via mixing. Bursts in mixing supply nearly all of the O2 to bottom waters in autumn, stopping them reaching ecologically low levels.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nHypoxia also occurs in small highly turbid estuaries: the example of the Charente (Bay of Biscay)\n\nSabine Schmidt and Ibrahima Iris Diallo\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1785–1800, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1785-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1785-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlong the French coast facing the Bay of Biscay, the large Gironde and Loire estuaries suffer from hypoxia. This prompted a study of the small Charente estuary located between them. This work reveals a minimum oxygen zone in the Charente estuary, which extends for about 25 km. Temperature is the main factor controlling the hypoxia. This calls for the monitoring of small turbid macrotidal estuaries that are vulnerable to hypoxia, a risk expected to increase with global warming.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nSeasonality and response of ocean acidification and hypoxia to major environmental anomalies in the southern Salish Sea, North America (2014â2018)\n\nSimone R.

An in situ dataset was used to quantify the mechanism involved in the presence of these conditions in northern Patagonian fjords. Water mass analysis confirmed the contribution of Equatorial Subsurface Water in the advection of the low-oxygen water, and hypoxic conditions occurred when the community respiration rate exceeded the gross primary production.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nAbove- and belowground plant mercury dynamics in a salt marsh estuary in Massachusetts, USA\n\nTing Wang, Buyun Du, Inke Forbrich, Jun Zhou, Joshua Polen, Elsie M.

The Hg sources found in marsh aboveground tissues originate from a mix of sources, unlike terrestrial ecosystems, where atmospheric GEM is the main source. Belowground plant tissues mostly take up Hg from soils. Overall, the salt marsh currently serves as a small net Hg sink.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nVariability and drivers of carbonate chemistry at shellfish aquaculture sites in the Salish Sea, British Columbia\n\nEleanor Simpson, Debby Ianson, Karen E.

We show daily and seasonal variability in pH and saturation states of calcium carbonate at nearshore aquaculture sites in British Columbia, Canada, and determine the contributing drivers of this variability. We find that nearshore locations have greater variability than open waters and that the uptake of carbon by phytoplankton is the major driver of pH and saturation state variability.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nUnusual Hemiaulus bloom influences ocean productivity in Northeastern US Shelf waters\n\nS.

In summer 2019, a bloom occurred of a large unusual phytoplankton, the diatom Hemiaulus, with nitrogen-fixing symbionts. This led to vast changes in productivity and grazing rates in the ecosystem. This work shows that the emergence of one species can have profound effects on ecosystem function. Such changes may become more prevalent as the ocean warms due to climate change.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nTechnical note: Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement Pelagic Impact Intercomparison Project (OAEPIIP)\n\nLennart Thomas Bach, Aaron James Ferderer, Julie LaRoche, and Kai Georg Schulz\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-692,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-692, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOcean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) is an emerging marine CO2 removal method but its environmental effects are insufficiently understood. The OAE Pelagic Impact Intercomparison Project (OAEPIIP) provides funding for a standardized and globally replicated microcosm experiment to study the effects of OAE on plankton communities. Here, we provide a detailed manual on the OAEPIIP experiment. We expect OAEPIIP to help build scientific consensus on the effects of OAE on plankton.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nInsights into carbonate environmental conditions in the Chukchi Sea\n\nClaudine Hauri, Brita Irving, Sam Dupont, RÃ©mi PagÃ©s, Donna D.

To understand their impacts, they must be accurately mapped. We use drone data to estimate the size of three saltmarshes in NE Scotland. We find that drone imagery, combined with tidal data, can reliably inform our understanding of saltmarsh size. When compared with previous work using vegetation communities, we find that our most reliable new estimates of stored carbon are 15–20 % smaller than previously estimated.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nIron âoreâ nothing: benthic iron fluxes from the oxygen-deficient Santa Barbara Basin enhance phytoplankton productivity in surface waters\n\nDe'Marcus Robinson, Anh L.

Here, we investigate how mats of bacteria that proliferate on the seafloor of the Santa Barbara Basin sustain and potentially worsen these O2 depletion events through their unique chemoautotrophic metabolism. Our study shows how changes in seafloor microbiology and geochemistry brought on by declining O2 concentrations can help these mats grow as well as how that growth affects the basin.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nThe Northeast Greenland shelf as a late-summer CO2 source to the atmosphere\n\nEsdoorn Willcox, Marcos Lemes, Thomas Juul-Pedersen, Mikael Kristian Sejr, Johnna Michelle Holding, and SÃ¸ren Rysgaard\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-6,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-6, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor this work we measured the chemistry of seawater from bottles obtained from different depths, lon- and latitudes off the east coast of the Northeast Greenland national park to determine what is influencing concentrations of dissolved CO2. Historically, the region has always been thought to take up CO2 from the atmosphere but we show that it is possible for the region to become a source in late summer and discuss what variables may be related to such changes.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nA comprehensive assessment of electrochemical ocean alkalinity enhancement in seawater: kinetics, efficiency, and precipitation thresholds\n\nMallory Ringham, Nathan Hirtle, Cody Shaw, Xi Lu, Julian Herndon, Brendan Carter, and Matthew Eisaman\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-108,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-108, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOcean alkalinity enhancement leverages the large surface area and carbon storage capacity of the oceans to store atmospheric CO2 as dissolved bicarbonate. We monitored CO2 uptake in seawater treated with NaOH to establish operational boundaries for carbon removal experiments. Preliminary results show CO2 equilibration occurred on order of weeks to months, was consistent with values expected from equilibration calculations, and was limited by mineral precipitation at high pH and CaCO3 saturation.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nUncertainty in the evolution of northwestern North Atlantic circulation leads to diverging biogeochemical projections\n\nKrysten Rutherford, Katja Fennel, Lina Garcia Suarez, and Jasmin G.

In one projection, the NA shelf break current practically disappears; in the other it remains almost unchanged. This leads to a wide range of possible future shelf properties. More accurate projections of coastal circulation features would narrow the range of possible outcomes of biogeochemical projections for shelf regions.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nThe additionality problem of ocean alkalinity enhancement\n\nLennart Thomas Bach\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 261–277, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-261-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-261-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOcean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is a widely considered marine carbon dioxide removal method. OAE aims to accelerate chemical rock weathering, which is a natural process that slowly sequesters atmospheric carbon dioxide. This study shows that the addition of anthropogenic alkalinity via OAE can reduce the natural release of alkalinity and, therefore, reduce the efficiency of OAE for climate mitigation. However, the additionality problem could be mitigated via a variety of activities.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nShort-term variation in pH in seawaters around coastal areas of Japan: characteristics and forcings\n\nTsuneo Ono, Daisuke Muraoka, Masahiro Hayashi, Makiko Yorifuji, Akihiro Dazai, Shigeyuki Omoto, Takehiro Tanaka, Tomohiro Okamura, Goh Onitsuka, Kenji Sudo, Masahiko Fujii, Ryuji Hamanoue, and Masahide Wakita\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 177–199, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-177-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-177-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe carried out parallel year-round observations of pH and related parameters in five stations around the Japan coast. It was found that short-term acidified situations with Omega_ar less than 1.5 occurred at four of five stations. Most of such short-term acidified events were related to the short-term low salinity event, and the extent of short-term pH drawdown at high freshwater input was positively correlated with the nutrient concentration of the main rivers that flow into the coastal area.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nDissolved Nitric Oxide in the Lower Elbe Estuary and the Hamburg Port Area\n\nRiel Carlo O.

Our findings have implications for the reliable use of Mo and U to reconstruct oxygen changes in fjords.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nInfluence of a small submarine canyon on biogenic matter export flux in the lower St. Lawrence Estuary, eastern Canada\n\nHannah Sharpe, Michel Gosselin, Catherine Lalande, Alexandre Normandeau, Jean-Carlos Montero-Serrano, Khouloud Baccara, Daniel Bourgault, Owen Sherwood, and Audrey Limoges\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4981–5001, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4981-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4981-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the impact of submarine canyon processes within the Pointe-des-Monts system on biogenic matter export and phytoplankton assemblages. Using data from three oceanographic moorings, we show that the canyon experienced two low-amplitude sediment remobilization events in 2020–2021 that led to enhanced particle fluxes in the deep-water column layer > 2.6 km offshore. Sinking phytoplankton fluxes were lower near the canyon compared to background values from the lower St. Lawrence Estuary.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nSingle-celled bioturbators: benthic foraminifera mediate oxygen penetration and prokaryotic diversity in intertidal sediment\n\nDewi Langlet, Florian Mermillod-Blondin, NoÃ©mie Deldicq, Arthur Bauville, Gwendoline Duong, Lara Konecny, MylÃ¨ne Hugoni, Lionel Denis, and Vincent M.

They were previously reported to horizontally and vertically transport sediment particles, yet the impact of their motion on the dissolved fluxes remains unknown. Using microprofiling, we show here that foraminiferal burrow formation increases the oxygen penetration depth in the sediment, leading to a change in the structure of the prokaryotic community.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nAssessing impacts of coastal warming, acidification, and deoxygenation on Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) farming: a case study in the Hinase area, Okayama Prefecture, and Shizugawa Bay, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan\n\nMasahiko Fujii, Ryuji Hamanoue, Lawrence Patrick Cases Bernardo, Tsuneo Ono, Akihiro Dazai, Shigeyuki Oomoto, Masahide Wakita, and Takehiro Tanaka\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 4527–4549, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4527-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-4527-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis is the first study of the current and future impacts of climate change on Pacific oyster farming in Japan. Future coastal warming and acidification may affect oyster larvae as a result of longer exposure to lower-pH waters. A prolonged spawning period may harm oyster processing by shortening the shipping period and reducing oyster quality. To minimize impacts on Pacific oyster farming, in addition to mitigation measures, local adaptation measures may be required.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nThe estimates of carbon sequestration potential in an expanding Arctic fjord affected by dark plumes of glacial meltwater (Hornsund, Svalbard)\n\nMarlena Szeligowska, DÃ©borah Benkort, Anna Przyborska, Mateusz Moskalik, BernabÃ© Moreno, Emilia Trudnowska, and Katarzyna BÅachowiak-SamoÅyk\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2023-162,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2023-162, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for BG\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEuropean Arctic experiences rapid regional warming resulting in the retreat of glaciers terminating in the sea onto land. Due to this process, area of one of the well-studied fjords, Hornsund, increased by 100 km2 and 38 %. Using improved mathematical model, we estimated that despite some negative consequences of glacial meltwater release such newly ice-free area markedly contribute to atmospheric carbon uptake and become efficient carbon sinks.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nMultiple nitrogen sources for primary production inferred from Î´13C and Î´15N in the southern Sea of Japan\n\nTaketoshi Kodama, Atsushi Nishimoto, Ken-ichi Nakamura, Misato Nakae, Naoki Iguchi, Yosuke Igeta, and Yoichi Kogure\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3667–3682, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3667-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3667-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCarbon and nitrogen are essential elements for organisms; their stable isotope ratios (13C : 12C, 15N : 14N) are useful tools for understanding turnover and movement in the ocean. In the Sea of Japan, the environment is rapidly being altered by human activities. The 13C : 12C of small organic particles is increased by active carbon fixation, and phytoplankton growth increases the values. The 15N : 14N variations suggest that nitrates from many sources contribute to organic production.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nInfluence of manganese cycling on alkalinity in the redox stratified water column of Chesapeake Bay\n\nAubin Thibault de Chanvalon, George W. Luther, Emily R. Estes, Jennifer Necker, Bradley M. Tebo, Jianzhong Su, and Wei-Jun Cai\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 3053–3071, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3053-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-3053-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe intensity of the oceanic trap of CO2 released by anthropogenic activities depends on the alkalinity brought by continental weathering. Between ocean and continent, coastal water and estuaries can limit or favour the alkalinity transfer. This study investigate new interactions between dissolved metals and alkalinity in the oxygen-depleted zone of estuaries.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nEstuarine flocculation dynamics of organic carbon and metals from boreal acid sulfate soils\n\nJoonas J. Virtasalo, Peter Ãsterholm, and Eero Asmala\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2883–2901, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2883-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2883-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe mixed acidic metal-rich river water from acid sulfate soils and seawater in the laboratory to study the flocculation of dissolved metals and organic matter in estuaries. Al and Fe flocculated already at a salinity of 0–2 to large organic flocs (>80 Âµm size). Precipitation of Al and Fe hydroxide flocculi (median size 11 Âµm) began when pH exceeded ca. 5.5. Mn transferred weakly to Mn hydroxides and Co to the flocs. Up to 50 % of Cu was associated with the flocs, irrespective of seawater mixing.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nDrivers of particle sinking velocities in the Peruvian upwelling system\n\nMoritz Baumann, Allanah Joy Paul, Jan Taucher, Lennart Thomas Bach, Silvan Goldenberg, Paul Stange, Fabrizio Minutolo, and Ulf Riebesell\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2595–2612, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2595-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2595-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe sinking velocity of marine particles affects how much atmospheric CO2 is stored inside our oceans. We measured particle sinking velocities in the Peruvian upwelling system and assessed their physical and biochemical drivers. We found that sinking velocity was mainly influenced by particle size and porosity, while ballasting minerals played only a minor role. Our findings help us to better understand the particle sinking dynamics in this highly productive marine system.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nImpacts and uncertainties of climate-induced changes in watershed inputs on estuarine hypoxia\n\nKyle E. Hinson, Marjorie A. M. Friedrichs, Raymond G. Najjar, Maria Herrmann, Zihao Bian, Gopal Bhatt, Pierre St-Laurent, Hanqin Tian, and Gary Shenk\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1937–1961, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1937-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1937-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate impacts are essential for environmental managers to consider when implementing nutrient reduction plans designed to reduce hypoxia. This work highlights relative sources of uncertainty in modeling regional climate impacts on the Chesapeake Bay watershed and consequent declines in bay oxygen levels. The results demonstrate that planned water quality improvement goals are capable of reducing hypoxia levels by half, offsetting climate-driven impacts on terrestrial runoff.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nConsiderations for hypothetical carbon dioxide removal via alkalinity addition in the Amazon River watershed\n\nLinquan Mu, Jaime B. Palter, and Hongjie Wang\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1963–1977, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1963-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1963-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnhancing ocean alkalinity accelerates carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. We hypothetically added alkalinity to the Amazon River and examined the increment of the carbon uptake by the Amazon plume. We also investigated the minimum alkalinity addition in which this perturbation at the river mouth could be detected above the natural variability.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nHigh metabolism and periodic hypoxia associated with drifting macrophyte detritus in the shallow subtidal Baltic Sea\n\nKarl M. Attard, Anna Lyssenko, and IvÃ¡n F. Rodil\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 1713–1724, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1713-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-1713-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAquatic plants produce a large amount of organic matter through photosynthesis that, following erosion, is deposited on the seafloor. In this study, we show that plant detritus can trigger low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia) in shallow coastal waters, making conditions challenging for most marine animals. We propose that the occurrence of hypoxia may be underestimated because measurements typically do not consider the region closest to the seafloor, where detritus accumulates.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nProduction and accumulation of reef framework by calcifying corals and macroalgae on a remote Indian Ocean cay\n\nM. James McLaughlin, Cindy Bessey, Gary A. Kendrick, John Keesing, and Ylva S.

The coral reef framework is produced by corals and calcifying algae. The Kimberley region of Western Australia has escaped land-based anthropogenic impacts. Specimens of the dominant coral and algae were collected from Browse Island's reef platform and incubated in mesocosms to measure calcification and production patterns of oxygen. This study provides important data on reef building and climate-driven effects.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nZooplankton community succession and trophic links during a mesocosm experiment in the coastal upwelling off Callao Bay (Peru)\n\nPatricia AyÃ³n Dejo, Elda Luz Pinedo Arteaga, Anna Schukat, Jan Taucher, Rainer Kiko, Helena Hauss, Sabrina Dorschner, Wilhelm Hagen, Mariona Segura-Noguera, and Silke Lischka\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 945–969, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-945-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-945-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOcean upwelling regions are highly productive. With ocean warming, severe changes in upwelling frequency and/or intensity and expansion of accompanying oxygen minimum zones are projected. In a field experiment off Peru, we investigated how different upwelling intensities affect the pelagic food web and found failed reproduction of dominant zooplankton. The changes projected could severely impact the reproductive success of zooplankton communities and the pelagic food web in upwelling regions.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nTemporal and spatial evolution of bottom-water hypoxia in the StÂ Lawrence estuarine system\n\nMathilde Jutras, Alfonso Mucci, GwenaÃ«lle Chaillou, William A.

Below 65 µmol L-1, the waters are said to be hypoxic, with dire consequences for marine life. We show that the extent of the hypoxic zone shows a seven-fold increase in the last 20 years, reaching 9400 km2 in 2021. After a stable period at ~ 65 µmol Lâ»Â¹ from 1984 to 2019, the oxygen level also suddenly decreased to ~ 35 µmol L-1 in 2020.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nSignificant nutrient consumption in the dark subsurface layer during a diatom bloom: a case study on Funka Bay, Hokkaido, Japan\n\nSachi Umezawa, Manami Tozawa, Yuichi Nosaka, Daiki Nomura, Hiroji Onishi, Hiroto Abe, Tetsuya Takatsu, and Atsushi Ooki\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 421–438, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-421-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-421-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted repetitive observations in Funka Bay, Japan, during the spring bloom 2019. We found nutrient concentration decreases in the dark subsurface layer during the bloom. Incubation experiments confirmed that diatoms could consume nutrients at a substantial rate, even in darkness. We concluded that the nutrient reduction was mainly caused by nutrient consumption by diatoms in the dark.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nContrasts in dissolved, particulate, and sedimentary organic carbon from the Kolyma River to the East Siberian Shelf\n\nDirk Jong, Lisa BrÃ¶der, Tommaso Tesi, Kirsi H. Keskitalo, Nikita Zimov, Anna Davydova, Philip Pika, Negar Haghipour, Timothy I. Eglinton, and Jorien E. Vonk\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 271–294, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-271-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-271-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith this study, we want to highlight the importance of studying both land and ocean together, and water and sediment together, as these systems function as a continuum, and determine how organic carbon derived from permafrost is broken down and its effect on global warming. Although on the one hand it appears that organic carbon is removed from sediments along the pathway of transport from river to ocean, it also appears to remain relatively âfreshâ, despite this removal and its very old age.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nSediment quality assessment in an industrialized Greek coastal marine area (western Saronikos Gulf)\n\nGeorgia Filippi, Manos Dassenakis, Vasiliki Paraskevopoulou, and Konstantinos Lazogiannis\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 163–189, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-163-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-163-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe pollution of the western Saronikos Gulf from heavy metals has been examined through the study of marine sediment cores. It is a deep gulf (maximum depth 440 m) near Athens affected by industrial and volcanic activity. Eight cores were received from various stations and depths and analysed for their heavy metal content and geochemical characteristics. The results were evaluated by using statistical methods, environmental indicators and comparisons with old data.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nLimits and CO2 equilibration of near-coast alkalinity enhancement\n\nJing He and Michael D. Tyka\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 27–43, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-27-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-27-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecently, ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) has gained interest as a scalable way to address the urgent need for negative CO2 emissions. In this paper we examine the capacity of different coastlines to tolerate alkalinity enhancement and the time scale of CO2 uptake following the addition of a given quantity of alkalinity. The results suggest that OAE has significant potential and identify specific favorable and unfavorable coastlines for its deployment.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nRole of phosphorus in the seasonal deoxygenation of the East China Sea shelf\n\nArnaud Laurent, Haiyan Zhang, and Katja Fennel\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5893–5910, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5893-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5893-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Changjiang is the main terrestrial source of nutrients to the East China Sea (ECS). Nutrient delivery to the ECS has been increasing since the 1960s, resulting in low oxygen (hypoxia) during phytoplankton decomposition in summer. River phosphorus (P) has increased less than nitrogen, and therefore, despite the large nutrient delivery, phytoplankton growth can be limited by the lack of P. Here, we investigate this link between P limitation, phytoplankton production/decomposition, and hypoxia.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nInterannual variability of the initiation of the phytoplankton growing period in two French coastal ecosystems\n\nColine Poppeschi, Guillaume Charria, Anne Daniel, Romaric Verney, Peggy Rimmelin-Maury, MichaÃ«l Retho, Eric Goberville, Emilie Grossteffan, and Martin Plus\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5667–5687, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5667-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5667-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper aims to understand interannual changes in the initiation of the phytoplankton growing period (IPGP) in the current context of global climate changes over the last 20 years. An important variability in the timing of the IPGP is observed with a trend towards a later IPGP during this last decade. The role and the impact of extreme events (cold spells, floods, and wind burst) on the IPGP is also detailed.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nSpatio-temporal distribution, photoreactivity and environmental control of dissolved organic matter in the sea-surface microlayer of the eastern marginal seas of China\n\nLin Yang, Jing Zhang, Anja Engel, and Gui-Peng Yang\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5251–5268, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5251-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5251-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnrichment factors of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the eastern marginal seas of China exhibited a significant spatio-temporal variation. Photochemical and enrichment processes co-regulated DOM enrichment in the sea-surface microlayer (SML). Autochthonous DOM was more frequently enriched in the SML than terrestrial DOM. DOM in the sub-surface water exhibited higher aromaticity than that in the SML.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nMetabolic alkalinity release from large port facilities (Hamburg, Germany) and impact on coastal carbon storage\n\nMona Norbisrath, Johannes PÃ¤tsch, Kirstin DÃ¤hnke, Tina Sanders, Gesa Schulz, Justus E. E. van Beusekom, and Helmuth Thomas\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5151–5165, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5151-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5151-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTotal alkalinity (TA) regulates the oceanic storage capacity of atmospheric CO2. TA is also metabolically generated in estuaries and influences coastal carbon storage through its inflows. We used water samples and identified the Hamburg port area as the one with highest TA generation. Of the overall riverine TA load, 14 % is generated within the estuary. Using a biogeochemical model, we estimated potential effects on the coastal carbon storage under possible anthropogenic and climate changes.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nA Numerical reassessment of the Gulf of Mexico carbon system in connection with the Mississippi River and global ocean\n\nLe Zhang and Z.

The GoM surface CO2 values experienced a steady increase over the past 2 decades, and the ocean surface pH is declining. Although carbonate saturation rates remain supersaturated with aragonite, they show a slightly decreasing trend. The northern GoM is a stronger carbon sink than we thought.\n\nThis article is included in the Encyclopedia of Geosciences\n\nCited articles"
