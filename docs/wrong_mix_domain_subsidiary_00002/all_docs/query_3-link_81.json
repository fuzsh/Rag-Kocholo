        "text": "Design\n\nThe terrarium design for Biosphere 2 was conceived in the 1980s by American engineer John P. Allen, who was the director of Space Biospheres Ventures, a joint venture that in 1984 purchased the property where the facility is located. Its construction was completed in 1989, revealing a structure consisting of three main sections: an aboveground airtight glass-enclosed area, a belowground technology area (the Technosphere), and an area designated as human habitat. The main aboveground structure is made of nearly 204,000 cubic metres (7.2 million cubic feet) of sealed glass supported by steel frames and is 27.7 metres (91 feet) at its highest point. The main portion of the glass structure, which is rectangular and has ends resembling pyramids, contains five ecosystems: coastal fog desert and tropical rainforest, which occupy the pyramidal ends, and savanna grassland, mangrove wetland, and ocean (complete with coral reef), which are found in the middle region. The rainforest and desert ecosystems are separated from the other ecosystems by lightweight plastic curtains. Connected to the main biome area by a walkway are three rounded glass enclosures housing the agricultural area. The belowground Technosphere supports the 1.27-hectare (3.14-acre) facility and contains the technology that runs and maintains the biosphere environment. Among the Technosphere components are more than two dozen air-handler units that control air temperature and humidity in the biosphere, allowing for cooling, heating, condensation, and dehumidification. Air is circulated to the air handlers from the Energy Center, a building external to the glass-enclosed area. The Energy Center also provides hot and cold water for temperature regulation and houses generators that serve as an additional power source for Biosphere 2.\n\nOn the south and west sides of Biosphere 2 sit two large aboveground geodesic domes that contain the biosphere’s “lungs”—huge variable-expansion chambers that regulate air pressure inside the glass enclosure. Each lung is connected to the biosphere by a tunnel and consists of a heavy metal plate attached to a rubber membrane. As external temperatures rise and fall, air remains trapped in the biosphere or is released from it. The release of air dissipates pressure that may exceed the strength of the glass. Below the south lung lies a 757,000-litre (200,000-gallon) tank for the collection of water from condensation within the biosphere; this water is stored for uses such as fire suppression.\n\nBiosphere 2 also contains a biologically based waste-treatment system that employs both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms and other biological recycling systems, including algal scrubbers in the ocean and a soil-bed reactor. While the algal scrubbers remove nitrates, phosphates, carbon dioxide, and other unwanted chemicals from the water, the soil-bed reactor pumps air through soil in the agricultural domes, making trace gases produced from technological and biological sources available to soil microorganisms for metabolic breakdown and thereby preventing their accumulation to potentially harmful levels.\n\nAdditional research facilities, as well as classrooms and student housing, were later added to Biosphere 2.\n\nMissions\n\nSurvivability missions in Biosphere 2 began on September 26, 1991, when four men and four women, referred to popularly as “Biospherians” (individuals trained to perform specific tasks during the mission), were sealed inside the glass biome. Agricultural tasks occupied much of the Biospherians’ daily routine, since they were expected to produce their own food, which included vegetables and grains from plants grown in soil beds; meat, eggs, and milk from farm animals; and fish raised in aquaculture beds. The crew kept detailed records on agricultural production, on changes observed in the wilderness area (the area housing the various ecosystems), and on atmospheric conditions. Within several months of entering the indoor atmosphere, the Biospherians detected a decrease in oxygen levels and an increase in carbon dioxide. At the start of the mission the indoor atmosphere consisted of about 20.9 percent oxygen; 17 months later, oxygen levels had dropped to just 14.2 percent. Unable to identify the cause, officials decided to inject oxygen into the facility on at least two occasions, and the lungs were opened daily to allow inflow of air from the external environment. While this move was criticized because of the impossibility of such a rescue for a self-sustaining colony in space, the Biospherians experienced marked lethargy and difficulty breathing before the oxygen was injected, raising concerns about their health and ability to finish the mission.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

One explanation is that the 1991–92 El Niño year produced more cloud cover than usual in southern Arizona, which may have limited the photosynthetic activity of the plants inside and thereby contributed to reduced food production. Lack of photosynthesis likely also contributed to the reduced oxygen levels inside the biosphere. Another possible cause for low oxygen levels was later attributed to soil microorganisms that absorbed oxygen and released carbon dioxide. The performance of the first group of Biospherians was further hindered about six months into the mission, when the group split into two factions. Nevertheless, the Biospherians held out for two years in the glass environment, emerging on September 26, 1993. On March 6, 1994, having made various upgrades and improvements in system engineering and having introduced additional species into the ecosystem and agricultural areas, the second mission, with a crew of seven, began. In September that same year, however, the experiment was ended prematurely following disputes over management and finances."
