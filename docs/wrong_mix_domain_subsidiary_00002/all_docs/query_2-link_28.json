Air is forced over the metallic cathode where the reduction of oxygen generates hydroxide ions. The hydroxide ions are transported through the molten NaOH electrolyte to the anode where they react with the carbon anode releasing CO 2 , H 2 O, and electrons. These electrons travel through the external circuit to the cathode, and generate electricity.\n\nSuitable metals such as Ni are employed for anode and cathode materials.\n\ndispersed carbon particles react with the carbonate ion to form CO 2 and electrons, while oxygen from air react with CO 2 at the cathode to generate carbonate ions.\n\noxygen from air react with CO 2 at the cathode to generate carbonate ions.\n\nthe carbonate ions formed at the cathode migrate through the molten electrolyte towards the anode, the electrons liberated at the anode travel through the external circuit towards the cathode generating electricity.\n\nYentekakis and co-workers [I. V. Yentekakis, P. G. Debenedetti, and B. Costa, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 28, 1414 (1989)] published a paper-study and proposed the concept for and simulated the expected performance of a direct carbon conversion fuel cell employing a molten Fe anode and an yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid electrolyte immersed in the molten anode.\n\nthe operating temperature of such a cell would necessarily be higher than the melting point of Fe, which is 1535 0 C. Indeed, their modeling was done for extremely high temperatures up to 2227 0 C (or 2500 0 K).\n\nthe present invention is fundamentally different from these prior approaches. It employs a dense and nonporous solid oxide ceramic electrolyte for selectively transporting oxygen necessary for oxidizing carbon. While others employ either electronically nonconducting molten salt electrolytes or electronically conducting molten metal anodes, the proposed concept uses instead a gas-solid system where mass transport and kinetic rates are significantly higher than for liquid-solid systems. Hence, the expected power densities in this proposal will proportionately be higher. Operationally, it also less complicated to deal with and study reactions in gas-solid interfaces than in the double and triple phase interfaces employed in the molten electrolyte or molten anode gas-solid-liquid systems above.\n\nDCFC direct coal fuel cell\n\nZirconium dioxide has three well-defined polymorphs, with monoclinic, tetragonal and cubic structures.\n\nthe monoclinic phase is stable up to about 1300 0 C and then transforms to the tetragonal phase.\n\nthe cubic phase is stable above 2200 0 C with a CaF 2 structure.\n\ntetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transition is accompanied by a large molar volume (about 4%), which makes the practical use of pure zirconia impossible for high temperature refractory applications.\n\naddition of 8-15 m % of alkali or rare earth oxides e.g., CaO, Y 2 â 3 , SC 2 O 3 ) stabilizes the high temperature cubic fluorite phase to room temperature\n\nIonic conduction in these materials is a highly thermally activated process with strong temperature dependence and large activation energy of about 1 eV.\n\nionic conductivity for the oxide ions increases exponentially with temperature, dictating the need of high operating temperatures for fast transport rates. Therefore, it is desirable for the solid oxide electrolyte to operate between 600 to 1100 0 C in order to provide sufficiently fast transport rates for the oxide ions that would make it attractive for practical use.\n\nE is the equilibrium potential of the fuel cell under open circuit conditions\n\nR is the gas constant\n\nF is Faraday's constant\n\nn is the number of electrons per mole ( in the case of O 2 , n\n\nFigure 1 shows the theoretical conversion efficiency and the expected open circuit voltage as a function of temperature for the electrochemical oxidation reaction of carbon. Note the temperature independence of E and efficiency for the carbon oxidation reaction, while the behavior is strongly dependent on temperature for the case of hydrogen Figure 2.\n\nSchematic design and operating principle of the direct carbon fuel cell depicting the details of the cell cross section (not to scale), ionic transport, and electrode reactions.\n\nthe direct carbon fuel cell may be operated at a single temperature, such that the reaction is in a single temperature zone.\n\nFIG. 3 Schematic stalactite design of the agitated bed direct coal fuel cell illustrates the general design features including one-end closed ceramic tubular cell and the capability to capture any entrained coal particles in a cyclone, and recycling the captured coal particles and part of the CO 2 back to the coal bed, the latter in order to enhance mass transport by agitation.\n\nFIG. 4 Schematic stalactite design of the agitated bed direct coal fuel cell illustrates the general design features including one-end closed ceramic tubular cell and recycling part of the CO 2 back to the coal bed in order to enhance mass transport by agitation.\n\nFIG. 5 Schematic stalactite design of the immersion bed direct coal fuel cell illustrates the general design features including one-end closed ceramic tubular cell. There is no recycling of the CO 2 back to the coal bed for agitation.\n\nFIG. 6 Schematic stalagmite design of the immersion bed direct coal fuel cell illustrates the general design features including one-end closed ceramic tubular cell. There is no recycling of the CO 2 back to the coal bed for agitation.\n\nFigure 7. Shell-and-tube type design where the pulverized coal bed is outside the tube in touch with the anode surface. This particular schematic does not illustrate CO 2 or captured coal rcycling, but these features can easily be incorporated and falls within the scope of this invention.\n\nFIG. 8 Shell-and-tube type design (inverted version of Figure 7) where the pulverized coal bed is now inside the tube in touch with the anode surface that is also inside the tube.\n\nthe annulus between the metal shell and the cathode surface facing the metal shell allows a flow of air.\n\nThis particular schematic does not illustrate CO 2 or captured coal recycling, but these features can easily be incorporated and falls within the scope of this invention.\n\nFIG. 9 Schematic of the two-chamber flat plate fluidized bed fuel cell design where the pulverized coal bed is in touch with the anode surfaces of the ceramic membrane assemblies. More chambers are possible. This particular schematic also applies to corrugated plate design of ceramic membrane assemblies. It does not illustrate CO 2 or captured coal recycling, but these features can easily be incorporated and falls within the scope of this invention.\n\nthe invention is directed to a fuel cell for the direct conversion of a carbon-containing fuel into electricity.\n\nthe fuel cell comprises an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte.\n\nthe fuel cell operates at elevated temperature, with a single temperature zone.\n\nthe fuel cell utilizes direct physical contact of an anode surface with carbon-containing particles.\n\nthe electrochemical conversion of coal into electricity involves a high temperature fuel cell that features an oxide ion selective solid electrolyte that supplies the oxygen required for the electrochemical oxidation of carbon.\n\nPulverized coal is introduced into the anode compartment of the cell with or without other solid constituents, such as sequestering agents for capturing the CO 2 and SO 2 produced.\n\nthe open circuit voltage of the fuel cell is determined by the carbon-oxygen equilibrium at the anode, since the oxygen activity on the cathode side is fixed by air.\n\nFigure 1 shows the theoretical conversion efficiency and the expected open circuit voltage as a function of temperature for the electrochemical oxidation reaction of carbon. The figure also compares the carbon-oxygen couple with that for hydrogen, which shows strong temperature dependence.\n\nSOFC solid oxide fuel cell\n\na typical schematic of the fuel cell ceramic tube involves a thick porous ceramic cathode that provides mechanical integrity for the multilayer structure.\n\nAnother typical schematic of the fuel cell involves fiat or corrugated plates of multilayered ceramic membrane assemblies.\n\nOther cell geometries, including flat tubes, rectangular or square tubes, and planar configurations, etc. are also possible and is covered under this invention.\n\na thin, impervious layer of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid electrolyte is coated on the outer surface of the cathode tube.\n\nAnother thin but preferably porous layer that serves as the anode is then deposited on top of the YSZ as the outermost layer.\n\na schematic of the tube structure and its operating principle is shown in Figure 2.\n\nthe YSZ and porous anode layers are each 10-50 _m thick, while the cathode support tube may be about 1-2 mm in wall thickness.\n\nthe porous cathode support tube is made of a mixed conducting perovskite while the porous anode layer is typically made of catalytically active cermet or a mixed conducting oxide.\n\nFigure 2 shows an anode 202, a solid oxide electrolyte 204, a cathode 206, oxygen ions 208, air 210, a seal 212, and a metal shell 214.\n\nYSZ is the preferred solid electrolyte 204 for its high stability and ionic conductivity.\n\nscandia stabilized zirconia (SSZ) has an even higher conductivity than its yttria counterpart [T. M. GOr, I. D. Raistrick and R. A. Huggins , Mat. Sci. Engr., 46, 53 (1980)].\n\ntetragonal zirconia which is known to possess higher conductivity and better thermal shock resistance than cubic zirconia electrolytes.\n\nother oxide ion conductors such as doped cerates (e.g. Gd 2 O 3 -CeO 2 ) and doped gallates (e.g., La 2 O 3 -Ga 2 O 2 ) can also be considered for the thin electrolyte 204 membrane.\n\nthe inner surface of the cathode 206 support tube is in contact with air 210 to furnish the oxygen 208 needed for the oxidation reaction at the anode 202, while the outer surface of the anode 202 is in direct, physical contact with the carbon fuel.\n\nthe YSZ solid oxide electrolyte 204 film in between serves as a selective membrane for transporting oxygen 208 ions from the air 210, leaving behind the nitrogen.\n\nthe oxygen 208 picks up electrons from the external circuit through the cathode 206 and is reduced to oxide ions, which are then incorporated into the YSZ solid electrolyte 204.\n\nthe electrons released during the oxidation reaction at the anode 202 travel through the external circuit towards the cathode 206, producing useful electricity.\n\nthe oxygen 208 chemical potential difference between the anode 202 and the cathode 206 i.e., air 210) provides nearly 1 volt of open circuit voltage.\n\nlattice oxygen i.e., Eq. (3)\n\nlattice oxygen is preferred in embodiments involving the single temperature reaction zone and the direct physical contact of the anode 202 surface with the particles of carbon-containing fuel.\n\nthe desired reaction is (4) for obtaining maximum conversion efficiency. Therefore it is important to bring coal particles in direct physical contact with the active anode 202 surface. This can only be achieved if the anode 202 surfaces and the coal particles reside in immediate physical proximity such that they experience the same temperature regime, and not thermally and spatially separated from one another. Hence, a single temperature zone fuel cell reactor design is the preferred embodiment in this invention where the active surfaces of the anode 202 and the coal particles experience direct physical contact and the same temperature space.\n\nthe carbon-fuel comprises any carbon rich substance including: all grades and varieties of coal, charcoal, peat, petroleum coke, oil sand, tar sand, coke, char, carbon produced by pyrolysis of a carbonaceous substance, waste plastics, and biomass.\n\ncarbon-fuel substances listed above may be referred to as \"coal\" in this document.\n\nthe coal bed operates in the temperature range 500 to 1300 0 C. This range provides the spectrum for the optimum operation of the coal bed and the oxidation process.\n\nconversion of carbon to carbon dioxide has an inverse temperature dependence and hence is favored more with decreasing temperatures. More specifically, the formation of CO 2 is thermodynamically favored at temperatures below about 720 0 C, while the partial oxidation product CO is stable above this temperature. In other words, the thermodynamic cross over between full oxidation and partial oxidation of carbon occurs around 720 0 C.\n\nthermodynamics dictate only the natural tendency of a system to change or react, but does not govern how fast the system undergoes change. Kinetics and diffusion dictate collectively how fast a reaction or change will occur, and this is an exponential function of temperature. So higher temperatures offer faster reaction rates.\n\nthe kinetics and product distribution of the carbon conversion reaction is best optimized when the operating temperature range of the coal bed lies between 500 to 1300 0 C.\n\nthe coal bed may operate between 600 and 1100 0 C, where the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte 204 membrane is larger than 10 \"4 S/cm. To obtain even better performance, the coal bed may optionally operate in a temperature range of 700 to 1000 0 C.\n\nFIG. 3 shows coal fuel 302, a resistive load 304, a coal bed 306, electrodes 308, CO 2 310, a membrane assembly 312, recycled CO 2 314, and ash and slag 316.\n\nthe schematic of the agitated bed direct coal fuel cell shown in Figure 3 illustrates the general design features including the stalactite design of one-end closed ceramic tubular cell.\n\nthe agitated bed is preferably made of a stainless steel shell with proper ports for feeding the pulverized coal into the bed, and discharging the flue gases. It also has the capability to capture any entrained coal particles in a cyclone, and recycling both the captured coal particles and part of the CO 2 gas 314 back to the coal bed 306, the latter in order to enhance mass transport by agitation of the coal bed 306 by gas flow.\n\nFIG. 5 Another design concept shown in Figure 5 is an immersion bed direct coal fuel cell where the coal bed 306 is immobile and there is no forced agitation of the bed caused by the recycling of the CO 2 product gas.\n\nFIG 8 shows spent air 802 and an air flow annulus 804.\n\ninverted shell-and-tube type design i.e., inverted version of Figure 7\n\nthe pulverized coal bed 306 is now inside the tube in touch with the anode 202 surface that is also inside the tube as shown in Figure 8.\n\nthe annulus between the metal shell and the cathode 206 surface facing the metal shell allows a flow of air 210.\n\nThis particular schematic does not illustrate CO 2 314 or captured coal recycling, but these features can easily be incorporated and falls within the scope of this invention.\n\nFIG. 312 Although similar in operation, another design geometry involves the use of flat or corrugated planar ceramic membrane assemblies 312. These are multilayered structures that consist of porous anode 202 (or cathode 206) support plates coated with thin impervious layers of the oxide conducting solid electrolyte 204 membrane, over which there is coated another thin but porous electrode layer to complete the fuel cell structure. The plates are stacked in parallel fashion in the reactor as shown in Figure 9 such that the anode 202 surfaces face each other. Carbon-fuel 302 is fed in between the anode 202 surfaces in alternating pairs of plates while air 210 is flown along the outer surfaces that act as cathodes for the reduction of oxygen 208.\n\nYet another mode of operating the direct coal fuel cell is to couple it to CO 2 and SO 2\n\nSequestration of CO 2 and SO 2 can be\n\ngettering agents such as calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, dolomite, a variety of micas, clays, and zeolites, or a variety of magnesium silicates (e.g., olivine, serpentine, talc) mixed with pulverized coal and fed directly into the bed.\n\ngettering agents such as calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, dolomite, a variety of micas, clays, and zeolites, or a variety of magnesium silicates (e.g., olivine, serpentine, talc) mixed with pulverized coal and fed directly into the bed.\n\ngettering agents such as calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, dolomite, a variety of micas, clays, and zeolites, or a variety of magnesium silicates (e.g., olivine, serpentine, talc) mixed with pulverized coal and fed directly into the bed.\n\nMica, clay and zeolite individually refer to large families of minerals and materials.\n\nmicas examples include muscovite, biotite, lepidolite and phlogopite; clays include montmorillonite, bentonite, hematite, illite, serpentine, and kaolinite; and zeolites include clinoptilolite, chabazite, phillipsite, mordenite, molecular sieves 13X, 5 A, and ZSM-5.\n\nzeolites include clinoptilolite, chabazite, phillipsite, mordenite, molecular sieves 13X, 5 A, and ZSM-5.\n\nAll these inorganic compounds may be used to sequester carbon dioxide and oxides of sulfur.\n\nthe gettering agents readily react with these oxidation products inside the bed forming solid carbonates and sulfates which eventually settle to the bottom of the bed due to their much denser bodies compared to coal, where they can be extracted. Or the flue gas leaving the bed can be treated with these gettering agents in a separate containment outside the bed where the reaction products CO2 and SO2 can easily be sequestered by fixing them as solid carbonates\n\na fuel cell using a single temperature zone A fuel cell using direct physical contact (or touching) of anode -surface with the coal particles.\n\na fuel cell using immersion or agitated bed to materialize contact A fuel cell using immersion or agitated bed to materialize contact.\n\na fuel cell wherein there is a one step process for direct conversion of coal to electrical energy.\n\na fuel cell that utilizes solid oxide electrolyte to supply the oxygen for the electrochemical oxidation of coal.\n\na fuel cell that produces highly concentrated (85-95% CO 2 ) flue gas that enables easy capturing and sequestration of the carbon dioxide.\n\na fuel cell that offers single source collection of CO 2 .\n\na fuel cell that utilizes mineral carbonization.\n\na fuel cell that offers potentially near-zero emissions and stackless operation.\n\nLandscapes\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nManufacturing & Machinery (AREA)\n\nSustainable Development (AREA)\n\nSustainable Energy (AREA)\n\nChemical & Material Sciences (AREA)\n\nChemical Kinetics & Catalysis (AREA)\n\nElectrochemistry (AREA)\n\nGeneral Chemical & Material Sciences (AREA)\n\nFuel Cell (AREA)\n\nSolid Fuels And Fuel-Associated Substances (AREA)\n\nPCT/US2006/011542 2005-05-16 2006-03-27 High temperature direct coal fuel cell WO2006124120A2 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (3)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title EP06739986A EP1897160A4 (en) 2005-05-16 2006-03-27 HIGH TEMPERATURE DIRECT COAL FUEL CELL AU2006248111A AU2006248111A1 (en) 2005-05-16 2006-03-27 High temperature direct coal fuel cell CA002608503A CA2608503A1 (en) 2005-05-16 2006-03-27 High temperature direct coal fuel cell\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (4)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US68192005P 2005-05-16 2005-05-16 US60/681,920 2005-05-16 US11/372,553 US7799472B2 (en) 2005-05-16 2006-03-09 High temperature direct coal fuel cell US11/372,553 2006-03-09\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date WO2006124120A2 true WO2006124120A2 (en) 2006-11-23 WO2006124120A3 WO2006124120A3 (en) 2007-10-25\n\nFamily\n\nID=37419486\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date PCT/US2006/011542 WO2006124120A2 (en) 2005-05-16 2006-03-27 High temperature direct coal fuel cell\n\nCountry Status (5)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US7799472B2 (pt-PT) EP (1) EP1897160A4 (pt-PT) AU (1) AU2006248111A1 (pt-PT) CA (1) CA2608503A1 (pt-PT) WO (1) WO2006124120A2 (pt-PT)\n\nCited By (1)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US8012453B2 (en) 2007-10-25 2011-09-06 Surendra Saxena Carbon sequestration and production of hydrogen and hydride\n\nFamilies Citing this family (21)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title GB0709244D0 (en) * 2007-05-14 2007-06-20 Imp Innovations Ltd Fuel cells WO2009002566A1 (en) * 2007-06-26 2008-12-31 The Board Of Trustees Of The Leland Stanford Junior University Integrated dry gasification fuel cell system for conversion of solid carbonaceous fuels KR101010535B1 (ko) 2009-03-06 2011-01-24 ë¶ì°ëíêµ ì°ííë ¥ë¨ ê°ëê°ë³í ìíì°ë£ì ì§ ì ë WO2010141629A1 (en) 2009-06-02 2010-12-09 Thermochem Recovery International, Inc.
