        "text": "1. XBRL in Oracle 11i and R12-The journey begins Mahesh Vallampati Coach America\n\n2. About the Presenter Mahesh Vallampati Presented several papers at IOUG and OAUG Worked at Oracle for 9 years Started out as a DBA/Apps DBA/Developer Now GL/AP/FA/PO techno functional expert DW/OBIEE Development and Support Microsoft CRM Manager Director of Oracle Applications and Technologies at Coach America in Dallas, TX Also worked at SmartDog, Hotsos and Eagle Global Logistics\n\n3. Survey How many did XBRL filings to SEC last year? How many have to do it this year? Next year? Don’t have a timeline Have not heard about XBRL\n\n4. Agenda How XBRL will change reporting XBRL XBRL in 11i and R12 XBRL Example walkthrough Next Steps/How XBRL will impact you\n\n5. First the bad News Metalink Note: 744514.1 Solution XBRL is not supported for use with FSGs in Applications Release 12. Or in Release 11i for that matter Why I will explain later\n\n6. Metalink note 744514.1 Are XBRL Taxonomies Provided and Are Any Patches Required for XBRL for R12? [ID 744514.1] Goal It appears that the R12 tables and table modifications are present in 12.0.5 for XBRL. However, the modified forms for Row Set, Report and Run Report do not appear to be present. Also, no seeded taxonomies are provided. 1. Are any patches necessary for XBRL reporting in 12.0.5? 2. Does Oracle provide seeded taxonomies? Solution XBRL is not supported for use with FSGs in Applications Release 12.\n\n7. The Good News XBRL is XML. The XML output of FSG’s and reports can be used just as fine. Several Vendors have solutions in the marketplace Oracle has other options\n\n8. HOW XBRL WILL CHANGE REPORTING\n\n9. Before\n\n10. After\n\n11. One way this could work\n\n12. XBRL\n\n13. What is XBRL? e X tensible B usiness R eporting L anguage\n\n14. XBRL is An XML language Open Standard Free of License fees A modern method for communicating business information Open Data Standard for Financial Reporting\n\n15. XBRL History 1998 - Conceived by Charlie Hoffman in 1998 2000 - V1 – Based on DTD’s 2001 - V2 – Moved from DTD’s to XML Schema 2003 - V2.1 – Conformance and Strengthening 2003 - SBR – Standard Business Reporting XBRLS – XBRL Simple Application Profile\n\n16. XBRL Document XBRL is an XML Document All XML Documents have two pieces Definition Document Data Type Definitions – DTD XML Schema – used by XBRL Instance Document An instance of a document The data the document seeks to represent Validation Well formed (Syntax Check) Valid (Conforms to the vocabulary of the document)\n\n18. Why do we need XBRL or XML The separation of a document data from it specification is key The data and the specification can be read and interpreted by a machine. A spreadsheet is readable by a specific kind of application designed for it. An XML Document and the instance of the document which conforms to the syntax can be read by any program that can process XML\n\n19. XBRL Architecture © 2010 International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation.\n\n20. XBRL Architecture Taxonomy Schema Element Linkbase (Relationship between elements) Presentation Calculation Definition Reference Label Taxonomy Extension\n\n21. Taxonomy A kind of classification For example, an income statement is a taxonomy It identifies specific accounts Derives new accounts by specifying relationships Provides context Presents the data in a specific way Profit=Revenue-Expense is a taxonomy\n\n22. Taxonomy According to XBRL 2.1 Specification “ A Taxonomy is defined as an XML Schema and the set of directly referenced extended links and any extended links that are nested within the XML Schema.” Taxonomy-A collection of interrelated files Schema File: xsd files Linkbase Files: xml files\n\n23. Schema\n\n24. XBRL Element or Concept Copyright © 2010 All rights reserved. XBRL US, Inc\n\n26. Linkbase Label - Associate different roles and languages to (is a concept) Reference - Attach external information to concepts Presentation - Nesting and Ordering of Concepts Calculation - How calculations are performed with concepts to create new concepts Definition - Define additional meaning and relationships Footnote - Associate footnote’s to a concept\n\n27. Taxonomy Extension An extension is a customization to an existing base taxonomy It can add or remove elements from the base taxonomy DTS is a Discoverable Taxonomy Set\n\n28. XBRL Benefits Improved access to Financial Information Increased Productivity Improved data quality and validity\n\n31. Load Taxonomy\n\n32. Associate XBRL in RowSet\n\n33. Run Report\n\n34. So what’s the problem? This will work for simple XSD’s and instances of XBRL Documents But XBRL Documents are quite comprehensive They have a lot more components than the schema and the instance So you really need a solution which incorporates all the parts of XBRL\n\n35. NEXT STEPS/HOW XBRL WILL IMPACT YOU?\n\n36. SEC Mandate Securities and Exchange commission got on the XBRL bandwagon SEC will require by law for all public companies/non-profit’s to post Financial information in XBRL format Phased Implementation 2009 – S & P 500 companies 2010 – Another 1800 companies 2011 – All companies\n\n37. SEC Accountant/Controller This is the person who gets impacted the most They have to migrate to a new way of doing reporting There is a cottage industry of software/service firms ready to “help”\n\n38. Even if you are privately held… Even if you are privately held Your investors may ask for XBRL reports Your bank may ask for it too Any other serious large scale stakeholder\n\n39. US GAAP Taxonomy http://ww.xbrl.org/\n\n40. OPTIONS FOR XBRL REPORTING\n\n41. Oracle Technologies Hyperion supports the generation of XBRL from its reporting engine Hyperion has been a part of XBRL for a while However, it will involve licensing Hyperion technologies and solutions http://blogs.oracle.com/FinancialsMkting/2010/01/how_oracle_supports_xbrl.html\n\n42. Other Options A third party software that maps FSG output to XBRL SEC taxonomies will work This will be a quick way of doing it. Look for vendors who will provide a software/service solution Have strict SLA’s around generation of these documents It is usually a one time investment Your SEC accountant is a key stakeholder\n\n43. What to look for in XBRL Software Ready made packages for SEC reporting for your industry taxonomy A good XBRL Processor A viewer of XBRL output Be able to create and edit XBRL documents by business users as well as technical users Be able to analyze XBRL documents A version control mechanism would be nice to have\n\n44. What to look for in XBRL Software Good Mapping tools Mapping tools will help map your FSG elements back to the taxonomy that you will use Ease of mapping should be a key determinant Focus on objective first, process next Financial Statements need to be submitted in a timely manner. First time can be iterative and ad-hoc, but eventually you want to be predictable and time-bound Your deadlines will not change for the SEC Proof of Concept is more important than vision\n\n46.
