        "text": "When I first heard about Bali years ago, it was just a hidden gem, a stunning island escape. Today, it has remarkably transformed into a business hub, buzzing with networking and business opportunities. Today, Bali is no longer just a place on a map—it's a global symbol of breathtaking beauty, rich culture, and a lifestyle unlike any other. It's the first name that pops into many minds when they think of Indonesia. And those who once came solely for the beaches (myself included!) are now looking into business potential. Indonesia's booming economy is a powerhouse brimming with potential. Consistent growth is just the tip of the iceberg. A flourishing middle class means a surge in purchasing power, creating a massive demand for diverse products and services. As a result, many have been (and are still) intrigued by the prospect of expanding their business to Indonesia. Are you one of them? Let me know what you think! #Bali #BaliBusinessLandscape #BaliBusiness #BaliBusinessConsulting #ExploreBali\n\nSelamat Datang di Yogya! I am delighted to be back in #Yogyakarta for Artjog, and to find myself falling in love with the city all over again. Non-Indonesians may be more familiar with bustling Jakarta and touristy Bali, but did you know that: 1. History: Yogyakarta (“Yogya”) was briefly the capital of #Indonesia, when Yogya Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX offered refuge to President Sukarno and his nationalist forces after they were defeated by the Dutch in Batavia (modern day Jakarta). 2. Politics: In return for Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX’s support for the fledgling Indonesian republic during the Indonesian war of independence, President Sukarno declared Yogya a \"Special Region\", where the Sultan is also governor. As such, Yogya is the only province in #Indonesia still ruled by a monarch today. 3. Economy: Yogya’s GDP (adjusted for purchase power parity) is approximately USD 8 billion, similar to Monaco’s. While this is not huge, it is worth nothing that the tertiary sector makes up almost 80% of Yogya’s economy. This includes education, hospitality, F&B, IT, financial services, fine art, and the creative industries. 4. Education: Yogya is renowned as an education centre, and is home to a large student population and dozens of schools and universities including Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM), the country's largest institute of higher education and one of its most prestigious. 5. Culture: Formerly part of the Majapahit empire and the Mataram Sultanate, Yogya is widely regarded as the cradle of Javanese culture, and remains an important centre for traditional Javanese arts like batik textiles, silversmithing, and wayang puppetry. 6. Heritage: Greater Yogya is home to not one but two UNESCO World Heritage Sites - Borobudur and Prambanan - which attract thousands of tourists every year. 7. Infrastructure: I landed a few hours ago at the new Yogyakarta International Airport (YIA), another gleaming example of Indonesia’s recent infrastructure drive. YIA commenced operations in May 2019, and is really getting into its stride as a regional airport, as post-Pandemic travel picks up. I was particularly impressed by the Airport Railink Train, which takes only 30 minutes to get to the city! 8. Tourism: Yogya has always been a popular tourist destination, and welcomes approximately 12k per month. This weekend, the city plays host to not one, but two tourist events - Artjog and the Yogyakarta Marathon. So if you’re in Yogya this weekend, drop me a line and let’s see if we can catch up over a kopi jos, or some of Yogya’s famous jajanan pasar!

Among the worst-ranked countries, there are 20 cities with the lowest quality of life, updated in mid-2023. From this list, the capital of the Philippines, Manila, ranks as the country with the lowest quality of life, with an index of 41.1. Next, Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is at the 7th position, Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is at the 9th position, and Bangkok, Thailand, is ranked 15th. The reasons for the low quality of life in these cities can be attributed to various factors, such as economic conditions, infrastructure, social issues, and more. It would require a detailed analysis to determine the specific causes for each city.

From the dense rainforests of Sumatra to the pristine beaches of Bali and the towering peaks, this country boasts an array of landscapes that captivate the imagination. The Country Has A Lot Of Languages: The number of languages spoken in this country is shocking because of the extensive variety. Bahasa is the official language of this place, but you can expect to encounter more than 700 languages in Indonesia. People in different provinces speak more than 270 dialects, while the population of individuals from diverse backgrounds is also high in Indonesia. The World’s Biggest Young Population Is In Indonesia: Indonesia is an excellent place for kids and young adults because most of the population in the country is below 30. It is easier for young travelers to meet people of their own age while traveling around the country. Socializing opportunities are vast in Indonesia for backpackers and locals alike. Kids can meet each other at parks, restaurants, and much more. Indonesia Has Only Two Seasons: The country does not have four seasons like many other nations. Instead, you will only experience wet and dry seasons in Indonesia. They are mainly driven by the monsoon and allow you to enjoy lots of rain. Due to the tropical climate, both wet and dry seasons involve rain in the country. However, the dry season has comparatively less rain. The wet season spans from October to April, leaving the rest of the months to be dry. #factswithflora #flora #facts #knowledge #uklst #ntisuk #pakistan #IndonesiaDiversity #BahasaAndBeyond #YouthfulIndonesia #SocializeInIndonesia #TwoSeasonsInID #TropicalParadise #IndonesianLanguages #RainySeasonFun #ExploreIndoLandscapes #IslandLifeID\n\n⭐️ The Experts Talk l Danang’s Growth Vision: Striving for Global Excellence 💥 In the first half of 2024, Vietnam welcomed over 8.8 million international visitors.

Her story depicts the struggles that many young people face when pressured to comply with the local culture, while also living in an increasingly globalized era. It is hard to find a balance between preserving one's culture and adapting to the dominant culture spread by globalization. This paper invites us to reflect upon the hurdles that young people in the Global South face when choosing between continuing their cultural lineage and adapting to different ways of living that likely lead to more financial opportunities. This essay also highlights the fact that every culture has some positive characteristics that the world could learn from to create innovative open-minded solutions to contemporary problems. Every culture also has defects. Hence there is no one culture superior to another, rather there are simply differences in ways of living and viewing our existence. Therefore, I believe that cultural preservation is important as learning about other cultures allows people to become more open-minded, increase their understanding with those who are different from them, and increase empathy. Increased empathy and understanding are essential ingredients needed for more peaceful relations between nations and communities. #culturalpreservation #globalization\n\nAs I prepare to leave Indonesia, a country that has become a cherished part of my life since 2006, I am deeply moved by its extraordinary transformation over the years. The comparison of data from 2006 to 2023 illustrates this incredible journey of growth and progress: ➡ Population Growth: From 222 million (2006) to approx. 275 million (2023). ➡ GDP Growth: From USD 364 billion (2006) to around USD 1.15 trillion (2023) ➡ Internet Users: From about 10% penetration (2006) to over 70% (2023) ➡ Urbanization: Urban population increased from 42% (2006) to over 56% (2023) ➡ Tourism: International tourist arrivals from 5 million (2006) to over 16 million (pre-pandemic 2019) ➡ Renewable Energy: Renewable energy capacity from under 5% (2006) to around 11% (2023) ➡ Education: Literacy rate improved from 90.4% (2006) to 96% (2023) ➡ Ease of Doing Business Ranking: Improved from 135th (2006) to 73rd (2023) ➡Foreign Direct Investment: Grew from USD 8.5 billion (2006) to USD 23 billion (2022) ➡Healthcare Spending: Increased from 1.8% of GDP (2006) to 3.1% (2023) ➡Airports: Number of airports increased from 176 (2006) to over 230 (2023) ➡Mobile Phone Penetration: Grew from around 20% (2006) to over 90% (2023) Additionally, the transformation of Jakarta, where I first experienced Indonesia's vibrant culture, has been extraordinary. The city's evolution into a more cosmopolitan and modern hub, with state-of-the-art facilities including a world-class airport, epitomizes the country's overall growth. Being a part of Indonesia's journey of resilience and dynamism, a country I am incredibly proud of and feel as my own, has been an extraordinary honor. Sampai jumpa, Indonesia. Terima kasih atas kenangan dan pelajaran yang telah diberikan. Kekuatan dan semangat bangsa ini akan selalu menginspirasi saya di mana pun saya berada! #Indonesia #Growth #Transformation #Farewell #Jakarta #Modernization Photo taken by me during Car Free Day at Bundaran HI, Jakarta"
