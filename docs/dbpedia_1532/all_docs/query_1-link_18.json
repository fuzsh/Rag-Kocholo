        "text": "The lyrics of Asya's song \"F\" convey a strong message of standing up against negative energy and toxic behavior. In the first two verses, the repetition of \"Go fuck yourself with your bad energy\" emphasizes the artist's defiance towards those who bring negativity into their life. The command to \"Go home, stay safe\" can be interpreted as a dismissal of these damaging influences, urging them to remove themselves from the artist's space for their own safety and well-being. By asserting \"I'm your worst enemy,\" Asya is flipping the script and reclaiming power over those who seek to harm or disrupt her peace.\n\nThe following verse introduces the term \"buddy\" as a sarcastic address to someone desiring conflict and chaos. By declaring \"I see you want it bloody,\" the artist acknowledges the other party's aggressive intentions but maintains her own indifference and refusal to engage in drama. The line \"I no send anybody\" suggests a disinterest in involving others in the situation, indicating a desire to handle conflicts directly and independently. The reference to \"spoiling my joli\" further emphasizes a commitment to protecting one's joy and inner harmony from external disturbances.\n\nThe shift to Russian lyrics in the third verse adds a new layer to the song's narrative. The lines \"You thirst to spoil everything / To arrange a terrible argument / A gap between us / It's not worth talking / It's not worth / Believe, believe / It's not worth / You waste yourself in vain\" portray a sense of weariness and exasperation towards someone intent on causing discord and conflict. The plea to refrain from further confrontation highlights a desire for peace and a recognition of the futility of engaging in pointless disputes.\n\nThe final repetition of the chorus reinforces the song's defiant and assertive tone, with the artist reiterating her stance against negative energy and her role as a formidable adversary to those seeking to disrupt her peace. The lyrics serve as a powerful statement of self-preservation and boundary-setting, urging listeners to protect their own well-being and guard against toxic influences. Asya's bold delivery and uncompromising lyrics convey a sense of empowerment and resilience, inspiring listeners to stand strong in the face of adversity and prioritize their own mental and emotional health."
