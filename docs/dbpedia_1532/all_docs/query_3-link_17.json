The Minority Owned Business Committee is incredibly blessed and thankful for her entrepreneurial knowledge, astute perspective & kindred spirit.\n\n“Wonderful presentation this am - Thank you so much for your openness in sharing your journey. I don't know that I've ever heard anyone really speak / address what it has been like to get to this point in our careers, I really am grateful that you're able to do that with the platform you've created.”\n\n“My most favorite quote of the PMI Mile Hi Women in Project Management Conference - Asya Watkins, MBA, 6σGB, PMP®(She/Her) shared her mantra “Success is my birthright, and excellence will always be my natural rhythm. So inspiring!”\n\n“Had a great day at the PMI Women in Project Management Leadership Summit 2022 yesterday. The highlight for me was being able to speak with Asya Watkins from Women Of Project Management.”\n\n“Asya is a professional that communicates well offline and is easy to work with when confirming the podcast interview logistics. She infuses courage and cheers women on to be brave and trust the truth that they can work to create the life and legacy that they want for themselves through dedicated professional development.”"
