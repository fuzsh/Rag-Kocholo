If not, at least what other alternative are available in order to achieve drop down lists? Please… I am stuck here… help me out.!\n\nHi Aysa,\n\nWhat are you trying to accomplish with your slack bot, and specifically by using dropdown menus? My instinct is that we don’t currently support integration of those, but I’m trying to understand better how you want to use Rasa\n\nHey @erohmensing,\n\nSay you would want to build a bot that gives you the details of your staff. So for this I would initially like the bot to display an auto complete enabled options menu displaying all the names of the employee. On selecting a name, the employee details are to be displayed. So with this, it would be easier and would also avoid the chances for any errors while typing the name of the employee manually.\n\nHope you got what I meant!\n\nHi Aysa, very sorry for the late response. As of now it looks like we only support button and image attachments, no drop down lists. If it’s important enough to you to add this enhancement yourself, it looks like slackclient does offer this and could be implemented in this manner:"
