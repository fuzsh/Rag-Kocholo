(DBW) Aziza A., Kulak Misafiri (2009)\n\nDiscussing Turkish culture without considering the Turkish-German experience is quite a bit like discussing Mexican culture without considering the Mexican-American experience. Apart from tech-death demigod Muhammed Suiçmez, the most prominent Turkish-German musicians seem to be rappers (notably Ceza and Kool Savaş) relating bleak immigrant chronicles over arabesk samples. Aziza A. is one of the few females in the genre, and though her 1997 debut fit comfortably into the Turkish hip hop pigeonhole, her third disc covers more territory, from dance pop to acid jazz (\"Huzurum\"). Aziza had always sung in addition to rapping, but now the former is outweighing the latter (\"Zufrieden,\" a midtempo groove with a funky guitar hook). \"Guzelsin\" is the sort of smooth funk you'd expect from Patrice Rushen or maybe Daniela Mercury. Even \"Soy De Ye,\" one of the few conventional Turkish hip hop cuts relying on Near Eastern strings, has stuttering sampled voices and DJ scratches straight out of '80s dance music. As on her previous releases, a couple of songs are in German (\"Eigentlich\"). Sometimes described as the Turkish Queen Latifah, to me she's closer to MC Lyte circa Act Like You Know - either way, this is a consistently pleasurable experience, and if I could speak either of her languages I suspect it would be an ?informative one to boot. (DBW)\n\nVarious, A Very Special Christmas Live (1999)\n\nAn all-star concert recorded in Washington DC, one of a series of benefits for the Special Olympics. Since most of the obvious Yuletide standards had turned up on earlier Very Special albums, the track list leans heavily on Fifties and Sixties rockers (\"Rockin' Round The Christmas Tree,\" sung by Mary J. Blige with a casual authority that blows the rest of the vocalists away). But there's a fair amount of variety: Vanessa Williams delivers a respectable nightclub jazz take on \"What Child Is This?\"; Run-DMC serves up their \"Christmas In Hollis\" (originally written for a previous benefit album). Eric Clapton sticks to the blues, singing Sonny Thompson's \"Christmas Tears\" and donating predictable leads to John Popper (\"Christmas Blues\"), Sheryl Crow (\"Merry Christmas Baby\") and Tracy Chapman (the decidedly secular \"Give Me One Reason\" - she also gives a moving performance of \"O Holy Night\"). Jon Bon Jovi solidifies his claim to the throne of Dean Martin with MOR takes on two similarly-named tunes, \"Please Come Home For Christmas\" and Phil Spector's \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).\" And of course everyone comes back for the singalong finale, \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town.\" Sort of a Christmas album for people who don't like Christmas albums, and since I'm one of those people, I shouldn't be too critical: all the performances are tossoffs, but not unenjoyable, the money goes to a good cause, etc. etc. Just don't expect me to be enthusiastic. (DBW)\n\nAmon Amarth, Twilight Of The Thunder God (2008)\n\nAnother Swedish melodic death metal band formed in the early 90s, Amon Amarth majors in Norse mythology with a minor in Tolkien (yes, their name is Sindarin for Mount Doom). There's nothing distinctive about Johan Hegg's grunted vocals, Fredrik Andersson's blast beat drumming, or Olavi Mikkonen and Johan Söderberg's intricate-yet-punishing guitars, but they put those pieces together well on some satisfying tunes (\"Free Will Sacrifice\"). Overall they're better at the \"death metal\" aspect than the \"melodic\": there's a lot of headbanging while you're listening (\"No Fear For The Setting Sun\"), but very little you'll be whistling afterwards. And there are several guests - Entombed frontman Lars Göran Petrov appears on \"Guardians Of Asgard\"; Apocalyptica adds strings to \"Live For The Kill\"; Roope Latvala contributes a guitar solo on the title track - but that can't disguise an overall lack of scope... one track is pretty much like another, and the disc too rarely ascends into the stratosphere. (DBW)\n\nAmon Amarth, Surtur Rising (2011)\n\nThe band doesn't have any new ideas this time out, but what they do have is one righteous, precisely arranged, rage-filled tune after another (\"Töck's Taunt - Loke's Treachery Part II\"), together creating an invigorating roller coaster ride. Producer Jens Bogren gets a sound that's clear, balanced, and hard-hitting as I've ever heard, making the most familiar licks (\"Slaves Of Fear\") leap from the speakers, ready to do battle with your poor benighted eardrums. Similarly, the record doesn't overflow with virtuoso playing, but the solos are timely and effective (\"A Beast Am I\"). \"War Of The Gods\" sounds like a more vicious Judas Priest, while \"The Last Stand Of Frej\" is more deliberate but just as thunderous. As you might have guessed, the lyrics retell a Norse saga or two (\"Wrath Of The Norsemen\"). Some configurations of the album have bonus tracks: if Amon Amarth's KISS and Accept covers are as good as their take on System Of A Down's \"Aerials,\" they're worth tracking down. (DBW)\n\nAnata, The Conductor's Departure (2006)\n\nYet another fantastic Swedish death metal band, though this time more technical than melodic (\"Cold Heart Forged In Hell\"). Guitarists Fredrik Schälin and Andreas Allenmark and bassist Henrik Drake (Conny Pettersson's drumming is a bit thing) form anunstoppable machine, combining the lumbering inevitability of a stoner band with the atonal unpredictability of a tech-experimental band - they end up sounding like a cross between Immolation and Necrophagist, but to my ears better than either. Each heavy groove leads into the next mindblowing riff which leads into the next headbanging break, and every song sounds better than the one before... After a while, I just sit there with my mouth open (\"The Great Juggler\"), and by the end of the disc I can't remember why I ever wanted to listen to anything else. They're recording a new album in 2013 after a long layoff, though as far as I know they haven't replace Allenmark, who left in 2008. (DBW)\n\nAsya, Aşktir Beni Güzel Yapan (2007)\n\nIt seems Turkish pop stars get started in one of two ways: as song contest winners or backup singers. Asya (born Tülay Keçialan) is the latter, having served four years backing up Nilüfer (who, in turn, had been a Eurovision contestant). On this disc, Asya's fifth, she wrote nearly everything (Gürsel Çelik co-wrote a couple of cuts), and the basic template is Near Eastern tonalities and instrumentation bolstered with electronic keyboards and percussion... Generally, the faster the tempo, the more electronics (\"Teslim Oldum Aşka,\" bouncy disco), though the all-acoustic \"Yeter\" is quite peppy. (\"Tesadüfen\" is an exception to all those rules, midtempo with a soft rock chord progression, electric guitar and chattering synths.) It's all quite competent without stretching too hard, and thus the record has a low beta: when the compositions are solid, the tracks are a bit better (\"Kırmızı Kart\"); when they're mediocre (\"Sendem Sonra,\" overly similar to Sting's \"Fragile\") it's still listenable. Produced by Bülent Seyhan. (DBW)\n\nBWP, The Bytches (1991)\n\nIn the early 90s, before Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown, the epic confrontation was waged between self-exploiting male-pleasing hip hop pseudo-feminism and self-exploiting male-bashing hip hop pseudo-feminism. (Hint: the male-pleasing side won.) Both sides used variations of NWA's name: HWA (Hoes With Attitude) were the nearly naked, down-4-whateva male fantasy (light-skinned, natch), while BWP (Bitches With Problems) were the casually dressed, cynical, horny but potentially castrating male nightmare. While neither act had rhyming skills or production savvy, BWP managed to score a hit of sorts with the overly blatant \"Two Minute Brother\" (similar in approach though not as catchy as 20 Fingers' \"Short Dick Man\"). This album contains that tune and lots more of the same: \"Fuck A Brother,\" \"Is The Pussy Still Good?,\" ad nauseum. If you've heard the vocabulary before, there's nothing particularly shocking here, and shock value is clearly what lead rapper Lyndah, second fiddle Tanisha Michelle and producer Mark Sexx were going for (\"Shit Popper\"). Sexx and Lyndah wrote all the material (except for some samples), and it's dreadfully boring: unvarying keyboard and drum loops behind stilted, unoriginal rhymes. Since Lyndah and Sexx see feminism as just women stepping into the male role - dominating instead of being dominated - the avowedly pro-woman numbers like \"No Means No\" come off as absurd, the anti-woman songs (\"Cotex\") are appalling, and all the \"brothas ain't shit\"-type songs are just sad. I may have rated this one too high. (DBW)\n\nBackstreet Boys (1997)\n\nTalk about multi-tasking: impresario Lou Pearlman put this band together in his spare time, when he wasn't running his massive Ponzi scheme, and he soon put together another multiplatinum boy band, 'N Sync, out of castoffs from this project. Apart from his boundless energy, the key to Pearlman's success was finding Swedish writer/producer Max Martin, who's become sort of a Diane Warren on steroids, writing innumerable hits for machine-manufactured stars the world over. Not just hits, but career-defining signature hits: \"...Baby One More Time\" for Britney Spears; \"Since U Been Gone\" for Kelly Clarkson; \"I Kissed A Girl\" for Katy Perry. I've always been kind of creeped out by Martin's aesthetic, but his ear for hooks and ability to match the song to the performer are impressive to say the least. And his first smash successes are on this record: the love songs \"Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)\" and the irresistible \"As Long As You Love Me\"; the smoking electrofunk \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back).\" Apart from Martin's work, the Boys are essentially a teen idol pop group crooning ballads that drip with fake sincerity (\"I'll Never Break Your Heart\" - yeah, sure), or Ricky Martinesque dancefloor tripe (\"Get Down (You're The One For Me)\"), and unfortunately that material makes up most of the disc. Each of the five singers is passable though no one stands out the way Justin Timberlake did with 'N Sync. I'm reviewing the US version, which was patched together from the group's first two international releases. (DBW)\n\nBackstreet Boys, Millennium (1999)\n\nMartin came up with another massive ballad: \"I Want It That Way,\" and to my ears it's not as golden as \"Long As You Love Me\" but it's close, and became their best-known song. Elsewhere, he basically sticks with his formulas, but he has a lot of them - \"Backstreet's Back\"-recalling party funk (\"Larger Than Life\"); \"One More Time\"-style electrocrunch (\"Don't Want You Back\"); soothing romantic nothings (\"Don't Wanna Lose You Now\") - and as before, a way with melody and arranging detail. The impersonality and calculation of his productions still puts me off, though... there are a lot of artists I love to hate, but Martin's one of the few I hate to love. And you can get a sense of how hard it is to do what he does by listening to the non-Martin tracks here: \"No One Else Comes Close\" has the same open-ended love lyrics and calming backdrop for group harmonies, but never transcends its transparent tripe. (Though actually the Mom tribute \"The Perfect Fan,\" co-written by one of the Boys, is quite effective if overdone.) (DBW)\n\nBeck, Odelay (1996)\n\nThe record which made Beck's rep as a slacker alt-rock deity. He produced with The Dust Brothers, who reuse their Beastie Boys schtick of piling on so many samples and shifting gears so frequently you won't notice there's no depth to the material. Many of the cuts follow the same pattern: obvious rock riff stated on (a) electric keyboard (\"High 5\") or (b) acoustic guitar doubled on fuzz electric (\"Devil's Haircut\"), on top of a hip-hop influenced drum loop, surrounded by retro touches like organ, and if you're lucky some computerized vocal effects. It results in one brilliant track, \"Where It's At,\" but on most of the disc, he comes across like a kid trying to impress you with how fast he can solve a Rubik's Cube: you couldn't do it if you tried, but you don't care either. The lyrics are meaningless free association, and Beck's voice is bland, blase and lethargic - just like a million other angst boys - which only accentuates the unemotional dryness of the experience. Rock critics are famously impressed by this sort of facile genre bending, and the record turned up on a zillion year-end Ten Best lists. It is enjoyably trivial, but don't expect too much. Beck plays nearly all the instruments, though a few guests pop up, including Charlie Haden on bass. (DBW)\n\nBelly, King (1995)\n\nTanya Donnelly sure has gone through a lot of bands: after leaving Throwing Muses and then The Breeders, she fronted Belly for a couple of years before finally giving up and going solo. The rest of the band is bassist Gail Greenwood and the Gorman brothers, Tom (guitar) and Chris (drums). Apparently this album turned off the underground without crossing over to the mainstream, but it's pretty good: the bright but unbubbly \"Seal My Fate\" seems like it should have been a hit, for example, and \"Red\" has a gorgeous countrified chorus. An unstable but intriguing mix of Neil Young grunge guitar and detached Blondie vibe/vocals (\"Super-Connected,\" one of a few Greenwood co-writes; \"Now They'll Sleep\") plus a few added attractions: \"Puberty\" incorporates PJ Harvey-style droned harmonies. Though nothing's flat-out bad, there are a few ho-hum numbers (the plodding \"Silverfish\") and the overall impression is rather slight (\"L'il Ennio\"). (DBW)\n\nBlack Box, Dreamland (1990)\n\nThe early 90s saw the death throes of dance music based on soulful vocals and irrestistable melodies, before techno and electronica took over and everything went to hell. A number of terrific tunes hit dance floors in late 1990, including Deee-Lite's \"Groove Is In The Heart,\" C+C Music Factory's \"Gonna Make You Sweat,\" and several tunes by this Italian dance outfit. Mirko Limone, Valerio Semplici and Daniele Davoli wrote, produced and performed a series of impressive singles combining uptempo percussion-heavy grooves, unforgettable keyboard riffs, DJ-savvy breakdowns, and powerful vocals: \"Everybody Everybody\" (with its Sugar Bear-sounding \"Owww\"), \"Strike It Up,\" and my favorite dance song of the decade, the insanely hook-filled \"I Don't Know Anybody Else.\" The debt to disco is strong throughout (\"Open Your Eyes\" sounds like Chic's \"He's The Greatest Dancer\" plus electronic percussion), but the bright production and unpredictable cut-and-paste approach to song structure keep it from sounding dated. Most importantly, though, the record is anchored by the full-out vocals of former Weather Girl Martha Wash, who croons, wails and belts out nearly all the tunes (\"Ghost Box\" and the title track are instrumentals). Wash was originally uncredited on the record, as the gullible public was expected to believe that frontwoman/model Katrin Quinol was doing the singing - the fiction was impossible to sustain, in part because Wash was simultaneously ghost-singing similar hits for C+C Music Factory. There's one cover, a credible version of Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Fantasy,\" though Wash's full-throttle vocal doesn't particularly suit that material. Loleatta Holloway adds vocals to \"Ride On Time,\" the group's breakthrough single but actually one of the less interesting tunes; other guests include guitarist Sauro Malavasi and saxophonist Rudy Trevisi. For whatever reason, the group vanished into obscurity almost instantly - no followup ever made it across the Atlantic, at any rate. (DBW)\n\nBoss, Born Gangstaz (1993)\n\nThe first and last record by Detroit native Boss may be the most perfectly nihilistic hip hop album ever. Staying in character throughout as a murderous blunt-smoking sociopath (together with her sidekick Dee), she has no faith and no mercy: life is a continual hail of bullets, and then you die. There's not a passing nod to religion or Black Power or any potentially positive force; even romance is quickly reduced to kill-or-be-raped-and-killed (\"A Blind Date With Boss\"). Who else would express nostalgia for bygone days - because they were more violent (\"I Don't Give A Fuck\")? She's not even particularly interested in blaming anybody for her situation. But somehow she remains convincingly human - not crossing the line into unfathomable monster or Geto Boys-style cartoon - by questioning her own actions, motives and sanity (\"Deeper,\" a single), and between the lines of this \"Diary Of A Mad Bitch\" you uncover a scared, defiant, vulnerable person. In this context the obligatory anti-violence piece \"1-800-Body-Bags\" doesn't read as hypocrisy, just another layer of confusion. With all the gunshots, violent imagery and nonstop profanity, reviewers didn't pay any attention to the music, but much of it is excellent, with producers Def Jef, Erick Sermon, AMG and MC Serch creating layered, bass-heavy grooves, often built on smokey guitar licks (\"Born Gangsta,\" \"Recipe Of A Hoe,\" and especially the eminently chantable \"I Don't Give A Fuck\"). However, there's a lot of second-rate material that just rehashes Boss's main ideas (\"Drive By,\" \"2 To Da Head\"), and it's so relentless it can be hard to sit through the whole thing. Guests include Onyx and Boss's parents(!), Lillie and Joe Laws. Boss rapidly faded away after The Wall Street Journal revealed that her life on the streets was largely fabricated, and was invisible until a 2001 appearance on a Krayzie Bone record. (DBW)\n\nDoyle Bramhall II (1996)\n\nBramhall's father used to be in Stevie Ray Vaughan's backing band, and Junior's Texas drawl sounds a lot like SRV's. But the resemblance ends there: young Doyle's not a bluesman, he's more of a cross between late Allman Brothers and current dance-pop, with plenty of \"alternative\" angst thrown in. If you like this record, you'll really really like it, because every song sounds the same: clanging rhythm guitars playing standard chord progressions, lots of \"where have I heard that before?\" riffs, half-moaned misogynistic vocals, relentless 4/4 drums. In fact, it often sounds like a deliberate knockoff of Jagged Little Pill. I don't know what Wendy & Lisa saw in this guy - they produced, and co-wrote all three of the album's best tunes: \"They Get Together\" is reasonably catchy, the fingerpicking insturmental \"Time\" is fun, and the album closer \"Stay A While\" has the duo's characteristic ethereal touch. All of which just makes you wish they could get label support to make their own record, and dump this guy. (DBW)\n\nToni Braxton, Secrets (1996)\n\nThe African-American Celine Dion, Braxton has a big, anonymous voice tailor-made for Adult Contemporary ballads. She hit big with her debut, which occasionally projected a strong woman persona; she became far bigger this time around, femmeing out completely with a diaphanous wardrobe and a set of plaintive, plodding pleas. Ace craftsperson Diane Warren came up with the year's dominant ballad, \"Un-Break My Heart,\" and R. Kelly and Tony Rich get in one number each, but most of the tunes are Babyface's, and all of the production bears his synth-based signature. He comes up with several nice melodies (\"Why Should I Care,\" \"You're Makin' Me High\") and his acoustic guitar playing is a nice break from all the sustained synth lines (\"There's No Me Without You\"). But there are a lot of problems: first, Braxton's lack of emotional range or interpretative skill combined with the all-ballads format makes the record remarkably soporific. Then there's Kenny G's endless noodling on the overblown \"How Could An Angel Break My Heart.\" But the record's low point is practically the only place where Braxton's involved with the writing: her lyrics on \"Talking In My Sleep\" are meant to be tough and thought-provoking, but all they provoke are laughs. If you loved \"Un-Break My Heart,\" this is an hour of the same. If you're hoping Braxton can stretch beyond that, don't waste your money. (DBW)\n\nThe Breeders, Last Splash (1993)\n\nKim Deal didn't get a lot of air time when she played bass in the Pixies, but with the group winding down she switched to guitar and formed her own band with Tanya Donnelly of Throwing Muses, cutting Pod in 1990. After Donnelly was replaced by Deal's clone-like twin sister Kelley they broke through with this excellent record, which is notably more accessible than anything the Pixies did. Instrumentally it could hardly be more basic (the instrumental \"S.O.S.\"), with heavily distorted buzzsaw guitar lines and primitive, half-spoken vocals that are simultaneously girlish and creepy. But the band really knows how to milk dynamic shifts (Kelley Deal's hard-rocking spotlight \"I Just Wanna Get Along\") - one track after another welds far out, funky licks onto big loud grunge choruses (\"Cannonball\"). It's especially fun when the Deal sisters' demented sensibilities run into their slow-grinding, tension-building riffs (\"Invisible Man\"; \"Hag\"). Kim also carries over the Pixies' weird obsession with surf rock (the steel guitar-slathered \"No Aloha\" and surging instrumental \"Flipside,\" both of which just totally rock out; \"Saints,\" with a huge lick). Even some of the more spaced-out stuff works (the epic, nightmarish, head-banging, Zeppelin-like \"Roi,\" later reprised). And they even put together a jangly, radio-friendly anthem (\"Divine Hammer,\" may be the high point). They fare worse when they slow things down (\"Do You Love Me Now?\"; the zombie waltz \"Mad Lucas\"), and sometimes you just can't tell what the hell they're getting at (\"New Year\"). But who cares? The rhythm section is Josephine Wigg (bass) and Jim Macpherson (drums); Carrie Bradley fiddles on the fun and completely incongruous country tune \"Drivin' On.\" Co-produced by Kim Deal and Mark Freegard. I don't have the band's 2002 reunion album Title TK, but I did see them live when they toured to support the record, and they were good. (JA)\n\nVarious Artists, Bridge To Havana (rec. 1999, rel. 2004)\n\nAs part of a Clinton-era cultural exchange project, a group of gringo musicians went to Cuba for a week to write and record with their Cuban sistren and brethren, and then performed the resulting tunes in a concert, captured for posterity. This release collects the studio recordings on CD and the concert performances on DVD, and I'm reviewing them all together. The Cuban lineup features Giraldo Piloto (\"Keeps Me Hangin' On\"), Manolito and most of Sintesis while the US contingent is led by Gladys Knight (\"Feelin' Good (Vacilón)\"), Bonnie Raitt and Montell Jordan. This sort of well meaning exercise of intellectual solidarity rarely leads to significant artistic results, and generally that's the case here: Jordan and Alfonso's reggae \"Walking On Sunshine\" and Peter Frampton's Silvio Rodríguez-like \"Hey Hey\" are pleasant but extremely slight. The biggest disappointment, Brenda Russell and José Luis Cortés's DVD-only \"Esto Es Pa' Gozar,\" is just a ramshackle jam. The best tunes are the ones which mostly resemble the artist's usual: Carlos Varela (with Beth Nielsen Chapman) on \"Not So Close, Not So Far\"; \"Volveré\" by Síntesis; Mick Fleetwood's reasonably catchy hippie consciousness tune \"One World.\" (DBW)\n\nChuck Brodsky, The Baseball Ballads (2002)\n\nPhilly-raised folk singer-songwriter Brodsky had gotten a good reaction from a handful of baseball-themed songs he'd penned over the years, so he pulled them together, wrote a bunch of new ones, and whammo! Instant concept album. Brodsky has a pleasant voice (Dylanish but in a good way) and an easy gift for melody (\"Gone To Heaven\"). The story songs are invariably interesting (\"The Ballad Of Ernie Klepp,\" about the first white player in the Negro Leagues) but often not much more than that: they're functional retellings of anecdotes but without much emotional resonance (\"Dock Ellis' No-No\"). The big exception is \"Letters In The Dirt,\" a terrific song that's not so much about Dick Allen as about a kid growing up in Philadelphia trying to understand how we relate to our heroes. Produced mostly by Kristian and Brandon Bush, who also play bass and drums respectively; other musicians include Jenny Hersch, Don Porterfield (both bass) and David Hamburger (dobro and slide). (DBW)\n\nJeff Buckley, Grace (1994)\n\nWhereas 70s and 80s hard rock bands relentlessly imitated Led Zeppelin's pomp and power chords, in the 90s a few artists emerged who were more inspired by the band's lighter side - by the drama, by the casual etherealness of songs like \"Down By The Seaside\"... in a word, by Plant rather than Page. Tori Amos is one of these artists, Jeff Buckley (Tim Buckley's son) was another. Buckley uses many of Plant's vocal mannerisms (though thankfully he doesn't \"push\") and epic multi-part structure, but in a mostly acoustic folk-rock context, basic rhythm section supplemented by occasional loud guitar and/or strings. \"So Real\" even uses guitar cues from Physical Graffiti's \"Ten Years Gone.\" Unfortunately, Buckley shares their lack of concern for time, taking forever to get to the heart of a song (\"Mojo Pin\"), and love of repetition. Furthermore, he's all atmosphere, no melody - without his admittedly commanding presence, the tunes wouldn't amount to much. (Alroy tells me Tim Buckley had many of those same qualities, so my analysis of Jeff's influences may be totally off... wouldn't be the first time.) Buckley wrote most of the tunes - there's also a cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" - and played most of the guitars plus some keyboards; Mick Grondahl's on bass and Matt Johnson's on drums. Produced by Andy Wallace. Buckley accidentally drowned before completing another album, and all that's available is a two-CD set of unfinished material, and some live recordings; read more at this fine fan site. (DBW)\n\nBush, Sixteen Stone (1994)\n\nThe fact that this hard rock band is overwhelmingly popular makes me want to move to another planet. Lead singer/songwriter Gavin Rossdale is so consumed with angst he can't be bothered to write melodies or play his guitar, and nearly every song has the exact same structure and arrangement: slow start, then chunky distorted rhythm and loping bass with Nigel Pulsford's minimal, echoey lead guitar weaving in and out of the mix. It gets dull during the opening \"Everything Zen,\" let alone the whole album which follows. Rossdale's delivery is passionless, and his lyrics are piled-up non sequitur clichés - unless he's making some postmodern point I'm not getting. No overdubs, backing vocals or anything that might give the material some interest. The silver lining is Robin Goodridge's solid, creative drumming, and a couple of tunes do have some cathartic force (\"Bomb,\" \"Glycerine\"). But there are probably five better bands on your block: this is nothing to go out of your way for. (DBW)\n\nBusta Rhymes, The Coming (1996)\n\nBusta Rhymes is the perfect guest rapper: his triple-time, larger than life clowning will liven up almost any track. But on his own, the schtick gets wearying, largely because he doesn't have anything to say except for vague apocalyptic prophecies (\"Abandon Ship,\" \"The End Of The World\"), and equally unspecific cutdowns of other rappers (\"Do My Thing\"). Production on this disc, his second or third solo album, is by Easy Mo Bee, DJ Scratch, The Ummah, Rashad Smith and Busta, and it's uniformly dull - slow, rumbling synth strings and nearly identical beats from track to track. He certainly has his moments (the single \"Woo Hah!! Got You All In Check\"), and I don't deny that he's a kinetic performer - I'll watch one of his videos any time - but an hour spent just listening to him is about forty-five minutes too long. Guest artists include Q-Tip, Jamal, Redman, Rampage The Last Boy Scout, and a few people I've never heard of, but nobody makes much of an impression. This was a big hit, and his 1998 release (with a guest appearance by Janet Jackson) was even bigger. (DBW)\n\nThe Charlatans, Up To Our Hips (1994)\n\nKnown in the U.S. as Charlatans U.K. to distinguish them from an obscure 60s rock band, the Charlatans are another Stone Roses-influenced Britpop act. Singer Tim Burgess' laconic crooning isn't terribly melodic, drummer Jon Brookes delivers insistent percussion overdubs and a loud, if danceable Manchester beat, bassist Martin Blunt makes no particular use of his McCartney-like tone (\"I Never Want An Easy Life...\"), and guitarist Mark Collins apes the early 70s-style guitar god heroics of a John Squire. The only thing setting them apart is Rob Collins' blaring, repetitive, retro Hammond organ licks, which often leave them stranded in the late 60s (title track). On their third record since 1990, they simply refuse to expand their thoroughly derivative sound. About half the grooves are catchy, but the tunes are monotonously formulaic - \"Come In Number 21,\" \"Patrol,\" and \"Inside-Looking Out\" all exactly follow the Stone Roses' characteristically self-indulgent, discombulated groundplan; the ominously psychedelic, six-minute funk-techno instrumental \"Feel Flows\" has all of the Roses' ego and none of Squire's virtousity; the plodding, White Album-based semi-acoustic ballad \"Autograph\" just mirrors their influences. Things only fly on the faster, shorter, guitar-dominated tunes: \"Can't Get Out Of Bed\" has some energetic, Keith Richards-like strummery and Bee Gees-ish harmonies; \"Jesus Hairdo\" is an amusing Led Zeppelin photocopy, right down to its Plant-like nonsense lyrics, Jones-inspired electric piano, hard-kicking Bonham-based drums, and especially Mark Collins' unusually sharp Page-y slide guitar; he also pulls off a lyrical lead and some bona fide dynamics on the angsty \"Another Rider Up In Flames.\" Producer Steve Hillage does get an authentic classic rock sound of them, but the songwriting leaves much to be desired. Rob Collins died in a car crash in 1996, after the 1995 release of their eponymous fourth record; despite this, they released further records in 1997 and 1999. (JA)\n\nVarious, Chef Aid: The South Park Album (1998)\n\nThe overnight success of the cable cartoon series South Park gave its creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, license to do just about anything they wanted, and here's the result: they play keyboards and drums respectively on much of the album, and many of the tunes are Parker's. His writing and playing is surprisingly professional, particularly on the songs featuring Isaac Hayes, who is hilarious (in character as \"Chef\") parodying his sex god persona on \"Chocolate Salty Balls,\" \"No Substitute,\" \"Simultaneous\" and \"Tonight Is Right For Love (With Meredith Baxter-Birney),\" a duet with Meat Loaf. The backing is tuneful, authentic 70s slow funk, and an entire album of this material would have been well worth hearing. Unfortunately, the disc is packed with second- and third-rate efforts by artists old (Devo, Joe Strummer) and new (Rancid, Ween), plus the inevitable superstar collaborations (Rick James and Ike Turner on a tepid version of Parker's \"Love Gravy\"; Ozzy Osbourne, Ol' Dirty Bastard and DMX on Crystal Method's electronica \"Nowhere To Run\"). The only bright spot is Elton John's rousing \"Wake Up Wendy.\" Worst of all are the songs sung by other South Park characters: \"Eric Cartman\"'s rendition of the Styx epic \"Come Sail Away\" is amusing the first time through, but \"Ned Gerblansky\"'s take on Bad Company's \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" is a dreary exercise in bad taste. Largely produced and mixed by Rick Rubin. (DBW)\n\nChildren Of Bodom, Are You Dead Yet? (2005)\n\nNowadays, heavy metal has so many tiny subgenres it's impossible to keep track of them all. The Finnish band Children Of Bodom seems to play melodic death metal, not to be confused with melodic black metal. (Both styles use grunted vocals, slow tempos and synthesizers, but the \"death\" bands have more personal and less Satanic lyrics than the \"black\" bands.) Anyway, COB - named for an unsolved 1960 multiple murder case - has released five studio albums starting with 1997's Something Wild. There are a lot of top-notch headbanging riffs here, from the rapid-fire title track to the slow-burning \"Punch Me I Bleed,\" the tunes are concise, and the band has a finely poised sense of menace (\"Trashed, Lost & Strungout\"). The problem is, they lose me each time Janne Wirman's cheesy synth comes in: whether it's playing high-speed single note solos (\"Bastards Of Bodom\") or adding atmostpheric background (\"In Your Face\"), the tones are bland and poppy, as if they'd escaped from an old Human League album. I'm not opposed to keyboards in metal, but they should sound, y'know, metal... Apparently their earlier albums have even more synth, so I'm gonna stay away from those. Vocalist/lead guitarist Alex Laiho runs the show, writing nearly all the songs and playing nearly all the leads, though second guitarist Roope Latvala (formerly of Steon) gets a couple in; the rhythm section is Jaska Raatinkainen (drums) and Henkka Seppälä (bass). (DBW)\n\nChildren Of Bodom, Blooddrunk (2008)\n\nVery much in the same style, with brutal downtuned guitar vamps and way too much squiggly synth (\"One Day You Will Cry\"). Lyrically they stick with tired Satanizing (title track; \"Banned From Heaven\"). So if you're not crazy about the band's general approach the record will do nothing to change your mind, but if you like them it's solidly satisfying (\"Tie My Rope,\" which turns into a lead guitar free-for-all). Though the tunes clock in around four minutes, Laiho packs a bunch of sections into each one: \"LoBodomy\" is a fascinating riff stew, and \"Done With Everything, Die For Nothing\" is a thrilling adrenaline cocktail. Even the less memorable tracks are well constructed (\"Smile Pretty For The Devil\"), so they get more mileage out of their formula than you'd think possible, but I do wish they'd mix in a new formula now and then. (DBW)\n\nCibo Matto, VIVA! La Woman (1996)\n\nTwo women (Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori), their keyboard, and streams of their collective consciousness. I saw them in Central Park and it was fun: they would spin a simple, Deee-lite-like groove, throw out some random lyrics and build to a mildly amusing chorus. For variety they brought in live musicians for a punk version of \"The Candy Man,\" and ended with a hilarious spoken word piece about throwing up on Keanu Reeves. But in the studio, everything falls flat: the Reeves piece didn't make it to this disc, the cover of \"Candy Man\" is ambient trance like the rest (i.e. dull like house music, only hard to dance to), and the free-associated lyrics are self-consciously silly. When Hatori starts screaming the chorus of \"Birthday Cake\" you may find yourself running for the eject button. A couple of the quieter tunes make pleasant background music (\"Sugar Water,\" \"Apple\") - otherwise, wait to see them in concert. (DBW)\n\nConverge, Axe To Fall (2009)\n\nHailing from Salem, Mass., Converge has always incorporated hardcore punk, thrash metal and mathcore elements, but has varied the balance over the years. When at the top of their game, they take the best from each genre and serve up a stew of focused fury, mind-blowing complexity and pulse-pounding heaviness (\"Dark Horse\"; \"Slave Driver,\" up Dillinger Escape Plan's alley). Other times, they just sound scattered and frantic (\"Reap What You Sow\"; \"Losing Battle\") but never boring. On most tracks drummer Ben Koller and bassist Nate Newton set out a treacherous sonic landscape on which guitarist/producer Kurt Ballou lays down rhythm and lead, supplemented by a variety of guest musicians (Cave In's two guitarists appear on \"Effigy\"; most of Genghis Tron is on \"Wretched World\"). Meanwhile, vocalist Jacob Bannon has a perpetual air of confused frustration, as if he'd been woken up from a drunken bender by being dropped off a roof. Most of the tempos are fast (\"Dead Beat\"), though they slow down for a headbanging vamp every so often, especially during the six-minute centerpiece \"Worms Will Feed/Rats Will Feast.\" (DBW)\n\nConverge, All We Love We Leave Behind (2012)\n\nAt this point in their career, Converge has two basic operating modes: full-speed hardcore punk (\"Vicious Muse\"; \"Sparrow's Fall\") and tempo-shifting mini-epics (\"Coral Blue\"). I much prefer the latter, and this collection focuses on the former (most of the tracks clock in under three minutes, often well under). And apart from a few gems (\"Predatory Glow,\" one of the all-time great riff tunes), the tunes are not as striking as most of Axe To Fall. That said, the individual tracks are well executed (\"Sadness Comes Home,\" alternately blood-boiling and chilling) and everything sounds great thanks to Ballou's furious-but-clear production (\"Trespasses\"). (DBW)\n\nCookie Crew, Fade To Black (1991)\n\nWhen I say early 90s pop-rap, you probably think MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice, but there was a lot of better stuff out there too: Salt-N-Pepa, MC Lyte's Act Like You Know, and the debut from this British duo. The primary producer is Dazzle, who takes unashamedly pop hooks like Brenda Russell's \"So Good So Right\" (\"Secrets (Of Success)\") and Sister Sledge's \"He's The Greatest Dancer\" (\"Like Brother Like Sister\") and cooks up entertainingly lightweight tracks. Though it's unambitious, he rarely missteps (\"The Powers Of Positive Thinking,\" using the same Bill Withers sample which turned up on Boss's \"Deeper\") so it's hard to complain about. The rhymes are similarly good-natured, socially conscious (title track) though rarely penetrating, and the rappers do fall into the same, Monie Love-recalling candence in song after song (\"Time 2B What We Wanna Be,\" based on an Earth, Wind & Fire sample). Gang Starr produced Guru's guest shot, \"A Word To The Conscious\"; Roy Ayers adds extensive vibes to the enjoyable dance cut \"Love Will Bring Us Back Together.\" (DBW)\n\nCradle Of Filth, Thornography (2006)\n\nA British heavy metal band formed in the early 90s, Cradle Of Filth has some similarities to Marilyn Manson: Gothic makeup, gender-vague pseudonyms (lead singer Dani Filth) and a calculated, desperate desire to offend. Pretty much all borrowed from Alice Cooper. Over the years, Cradle Of Filth has won plenty of fans while alienating others by remaining vague on whether they really believe all this stuff about vampires or they're just screwing around (as evidenced by tongue-in-cheek covers like Cliff Richard's \"Devil Woman\"). What's sillier, someone who really worships the devil, or someone who just pretends to? This album, the group's twelfth, is more of the same mock-poetic mock-blasphemy (\"Rise Of The Pentagram\"; \"Libertina Grimm\"), produced by Rob Caggiano (formerly of Anthrax). Apparently the grandiosity is reined in from earlier discs, though there's still a symphonic opening with a pretentious title (\"Under Pregnant Skies She Comes Alive Like Miss Leviathan\"), and a bunch of seven-minute cuts (\"I Am The Thorn\"). Tunewise, there are about as many misses (\"The Byronic Man\"; a cover of Heaven 17's 1983 \"Temptation\"; \"Cemetery And Sundown\" spoils the \"Symphony Of Destruction\" riff) as hits (\"Libertina Grimm,\" with a Sabbath-quality bent lick). But when they're on, they're really on: \"The Foetus Of A New Day Kicking,\" one of the shortest songs, is an eye-opener; piano-like keyboards are set against metal guitars on the strangely moving, mostly instrumental \"Rise Of The Pentagram\"; and the mini-opera \"Lovesick For Mina\" conveys overwrought emotion like King Diamond at his best. (DBW)\n\nSheryl Crow, Tuesday Night Music Club (1993)\n\nOnce in a great while, an album comes along that's so staggeringly unoriginal it makes you question your faith in humanity. This isn't that album, but it's damn close: so many standard rock elements are reused here you might think you're listening to a Seventies Mellow Rock compilation. \"Strong Enough\" is a mostly-acoustic tune that strongly recalls Rumours-era Fleetwood Mac; \"The Na-Na Song\" is an embarrassing stream-of-consciousness ripoff of John Lennon's \"Give Peace A Chance\"; \"I Shall Believe\" is every mushy self-help anthem you ever heard, and less. A massive seller behind the hit single \"All I Wanna Do,\" which features the \"Suzy Q\" bass line endlessly repeated while Crow half-sings pseudo-poetic verses, and a chorus that really was catchy the first hundred thousand times I heard it. Crow's voice is featureless, which suits the material, and the band is slick and professional: when it comes to lowest common denominator, Bonnie Raitt Lite, WalMart-targeted rock and roll, Crow delivers. (DBW)\n\nDark Tranquillity, The Gallery (1995)\n\nYet another Swedish melodic death metal band, Dark Tranquillity has been influential within that scene since the beginning of the 90s, and their reputation primarily rests on this disc. The sound is pristine and potent - guitarists Niklas Sundin and Fredrik Johansson layer crisp melodies and crunching rhythms with equal aplomb - and though most of the disc is at a furious pace (\"The One Brooding Warning\") they do incorporate some mellow sections (\"Lethe\"; title track). Often the individual licks aren't particularly noteworthy (\"Punish My Heaven\"), though when they are, the genre-defining mix of precision and power sounds wonderful (\"The Dividing Line\"; the concluding suite \"Mine Is The Grandeur... Of Melancholy Burning\"). Overall, though, the disc is lacking in drama and emotional impact... it doesn't help that new vocalist Mikael Stanne's growl has no emotional shading, or indeed any variation at all. Produced by the band and Fredrik Nordström, who also produced At The Gates's 1995 Slaughter Of The Soul - another technically impressive disc that doesn't move me much. A recent CD reissue includes several covers including Metallica's \"My Friend Of Misery.\" (DBW)\n\nDark Tranquillity, Fiction (2007)\n\nThe intervening twelve years haven't dimmed the band's ferocity, but they do seem to have lost almost everything else. Stanne sticks to a low growl for the most part, though he does sing clean a couple of times (\"Misery's Crown,\" where he declaims like an 80s goth). The sound is furious and technical (\"The Lesser Faith\"; \"Empty Me\" with uncountable time signatures) but uninvolving, partly because it's so unchanging, and partly because the guitars and basses are so down-tuned and muddy, you can hardly tell what they're playing - Martin Brändström's trebly keyboards are stuck carrying the melodies. And since I can't make out any of the lyrics, I'm left with nothing to listen for... I'm stuck here going \"Yep, that Anders Jivarp sure is one technically proficient drummer. How many more songs until I can change the CD and listen to some actual music?\" The standout track is \"Inside The Particle Storm,\" with a quiet middle that permits some dynamic range and ultimately some actual emotion. Produced by the band and Tue Madsen; the only guest is Nell Sigland, who adds vocals to the closer \"The Mundane And The Magic.\" (DBW)\n\nÖzcan Deniz, Ses Ve Ayrilik (2004)\n\nThere used to be a legend about East Sixth Street in Manhattan that the entire row of Indian restaurants sold food from the same kitchen. Well, Türkpop is a bit like that, in that the best songs from a whole slew of artists all come from a tiny handful of songwriters. Sezen Aksu didn't write any of these songs, and Deniz himself wrote several, but two of the strongest are from reliable hit provider Nazan Öncel: \"Canim\" is present in three full versions (plus a brief intro); the dance mix and acoustic guitar mix are fine, though Öncel's orchestrated arrangement is where the emotion really comes through. And like Öncel, Deniz integrates traditional instrumentation directly into pop songs (\"Tomurcuk\"), where, say, Candan Erçetin tends to keep folk instruments on folk songs, Greek instruments on Greek songs, and so on. Each approach have its merits, but as easily bored and unappreciative of authenticity as I am, I tend to prefer the former. Deniz himself is tough to pin down, traveling from electronic dance (\"Yanima Gel (Remix)\") to slow love song (\"Olmadi\") by way of every point in between (\"Anlayamadim,\" bubbling over with crafty hooks). The upside of that is, he's unpredictable; the downside is, he doesn't quite establish an identity, which his anonymous though clear voice doesn't help. (DBW)\n\nDez Dickerson, Oneman (1997)\n\nIf you know who Dickerson is at all, it's probably for his stint as lead guitarist in Prince's backup band: last time I saw him was his brief appearance in \"Purple Rain\" singing \"(I Want To Be A) Modernaire.\" In the intervening years he's become a born-again Christian, and this collection of guitar-driven pop rock is mostly religious-themed (\"Real To Me,\" \"This Song,\" title track), but he mostly manages to avoid the usual clichés. Phil Solem of the flash-in-the-pan Rembrandts worked on a couple of tracks here, and the disc echoes that band's Beatle-derived feel-good rock, with bright, chunky rhythm guitar chords all over the place. Dickerson - who wrote everything except one cover, produced, played nearly all the guitar and bass parts and sang all the vocals - stays within his limits: he doesn't try to outplay or outsing everyone else on the planet, he just crafts three to four minute pop songs. There's very little variety from track to track, but it's all very earnest, and pleasant enough. If you're a fan of undemanding guitar pop, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this disc. (DBW)\n\nAni DiFranco, Puddle Dive (1993)\n\nA folk singer from Buffalo, NY, who's built herself into a cottage industry without any help from record companies, developing her own Righteous Babe label by selling self-written, self-produced tapes out of the back of her Volkswagon. Singer/songwriters tend to be self-absorbed - nature of the beast - but DiFranco pushes it to an extreme on her fourth album, spitting out song after song about her solitary life on the road, making the same observations that urban hipsters have made about small towns since the beginning of time (\"4th Of July,\" \"God's Country,\" \"Back Around\"), and including a few self-congratulatory \"I see through corporate conditioning\" odes (\"My IQ,\" \"Willing To Fight\"). She evidently works quickly: clutches of words appear with no evident relation to the rest of a song (\"Names And Dates And Times\"), while the melodies give \"rudimentary\" a bad name (\"Egos Like Hairdos\"). But what's striking and valuable about the record is precisely that fuck-it bravado: DiFranco's voice ranges from a cutting sneer to a quavery yodel, all the arrangements are built around her harshly strummed acoustic guitar - instruments ranging from violin to marimba crop up here and there, but they're purely decorative - she's tough enough to show weakness (\"Used To You\"), and she frequently finds powerful images that most people would be afraid to touch (\"Pick Yer Nose,\" \"Blood In The Boardroom\"). Arresting if aggravating, but probably not her best work; DiFranco's 1995 Not A Pretty Girl is often cited as a high point, and I'll be looking for it. (DBW)\n\nAni DiFranco, To The Teeth (1999)\n\nDiFranco's twelveth album in ten years (not counting some collaborations) finds her mellow, having smoothed out the rough edges in her voice and her songwriting - mild declarations outweigh manifestos here - so it's consistently dull rather than intermittently annoying. Half-spoken vocals with no discernable melody, sluggish acoustic guitar accompaniment, soporific six- and seven-minute running times (the anti-NRA title track), lyrics so direct they read like diary excerpts (\"Short Shoulder\"), and an overall depressed manner (\"Carry You Around\"). The closest comparison I can find is Tracy Chapman in her most artless moments. The only track with arresting energy is the rock star whine \"Freakshow\"; the one excellent song is \"Hello Birmingham,\" a keenly detailed meditation on political assassinations. The spare arrangements usually include guitar (DiFranco), drums (Daren Hahn), acoustic bass (Jason Mercer), organ (Julie Wolf), and occasional horns (Maceo Parker on sax, Brian Wolf on trumpet and trombone) - Prince adds faint vocals to \"Providence.\" There's an amazingly detailed fan site. (DBW)\n\nDimmu Borgir, In Sorte Diaboli (2007)\n\nNorway's Dimmu Borgir has achieved notable success over the years by stretching the definition of black metal to include everything from symphonic orchestration to the sort of lead guitar harmonies more commonly found in melodic death metal (\"The Conspiracy Unfolds\"). But they haven't turned their back on Satan: the lyrics tell a story about a medieval priest's assistant who comes to appreciate the joys of devil-worship. Despite the touches of synth - courtesy of Mustis - and strings, guitarists Silenoz and Galder carry most of the weight, while new drummer Hellhammer (previously with Mayhem) rarely lets up. ICS Vortex is scarcely audible on bass; he also handles the occasional sung choruses, singing in an almost operatic power metal style (\"The Serpentine Offering\"), while frontman Shagrath contributes the menacing growling that make up the bulk of the vocals. It's all quite silly but rather effective in its way (\"The Foreshadowing Furnace\"). Produced by Fredrik Nordström, Patrik Jerksten and the band. (DBW)\n\nCeline Dion (1992)\n\nThe French Canadian Toni Braxton, Dion has a beautiful voice but brings absolutely no personality to her material: she's the kind of artist who could sing her own diary without giving you the impression that it meant anything to her. It's a talent that makes her a natural for movie themes, and this disc includes the title song from \"Beauty And The Beast,\" a duet with Peabo Bryson. This was either her first or second album in English, and it's in the mold of her later releases: lush ballads and bouncy pop. Sometimes it sounds like Mariah Carey's worst moments, particularly when Carey cohort Walter Afanasieff is on hand (\"If You Could See Me Now,\" \"If I Were You\"), but where Carey's got a deep bag of vocal tricks, Dion just keeps plugging away until she's made it to the end of the cut. Half the songs are by Diane Warren, and they're tenth hand romantic clichés wedded to servicable but unmemorable melodies (\"Nothing Broken But My Heart,\" \"Love Can Move Mountains\"). Prince's donated \"With This Tear\" is no better. Producers include Ric Wake and Guy Roche, and they don't have one original idea between them. But this kind of music isn't about originality, it's about catering to sentimentality - music's answer to soap operas - and on that level it's a complete success. (DBW)\n\nKenan Doğulu, Patron (2009)\n\nIstanbul-born pop singer Doğulu embraces a multitude of Western styles with a decidedly retro bent (the neo-soul \"Cadİ Kazanİ\"). He wrote all the songs, his brother Ozan produced, and between them they get all the little things right: \"Nights In White Satin\" organ on \"Aşkkolik\"; oom-pah brass on the Mod swaggerer \"Etme\"; the technofunk title track captures the essence of late Timbaland while avoiding pastiche; \"Salak\" sounds just like Gorillaz. And the big things are pretty good too: most songs are well-defined and vital (the romantic yet vaguely threatening \"Olur Mu?\"); Doğulu's voice is supple enough to accommodate each genre he takes on (\"Öp,\" where he convincingly imitates Justin Timberlake), while bringing cohesion to what could have sounded like a patchwork. Though they mostly eschew Near Eastern melodic and instrumental trappings, a Turkish sensibility still gleams through (\"Rübeni Bileceksin,\" despite vague similarities to the children's song \"Michael Finnegan\"; the plaintive \"Sevdim\"). (DBW)\n\nKenan Doğulu, Aşka Türlü Şeyler (2012)\n\nDoğulu toned things down considerably, with a strong emphasis on gentle rhythms, whether programmed (\"İstanbul\") or live instruments (\"Zevk Alalım\") - only \"Kalp Kalbe Karşı\" is a viable summons to the dancefloor - and he's competent and comfortable (\"Bir İleri İki Geri\"). Unfortunately, the record's also not nearly as melodic (\"Bal Gibi\"): sometimes artists forget that mellow music needs to be more tuneful than the hard stuff. Do)gulu is both versatile and talented; on this release there's ample evidence of the former (\"Tencere Kapak,\" a Candan Erçetin-like homage to '60s pop français) but scant of the latter (\"Güle Güle\" - tranquil but tuneful - is an exception). (DBW)\n\nJermaine Dupri, Life In 1472 (1998)\n\nHot producer Dupri assembled a top-flight cast for his first solo album, bringing in artists he'd brought to the limelight (Da Brat, Xscape) or at least made hits for (Mariah Carey). But somewhere along the line he got so focused on star power he forgot about making good music. The disc is overloaded with hip hop clichéfests (\"Turn It Out,\" \"Money Ain't A Thing,\" \"You Get Dealt Wit\") featuring inarticulate, highly commercial rappers like Jay-Z, Mase and Snoop Dogg and one obvious sample per song. \"The Party Continues\" (with Da Brat and Usher) isn't much better, and Slick Rick's \"Fresh\" is incredibly dull. (However, \"Get Your Shit Right\" - with DMX and the Mad Rapper - and \"Protectors Of 1472\" have fine, ominous grooves.) Dupri certainly knows how to create interesting, original backing tracks, and I don't understand why he so consistently failed to do so here. The two slow R&B tunes are standouts: \"Lay You Down\" with Trina and Tamara Powell, and Carey's lovely cover of the Rainy Davis hit \"Sweetheart\" (also released on her concurrent greatest hits compiliation). Hopefully, this was an abberation, and Dupri's not descending into Puffy-style music-by-numbers. I will give him credit for not including any annoying interludes or hidden tracks. Other guests include Too Short, Eightball, Lil' Kim, Warren G and Keith Sweat. (DBW)\n\nJermaine Dupri Presents 12 Soulful Nights Of Christmas (1998)\n\nDupri put his name on this set of Yuletide R&B, but he doesn't appear and only produced two tracks: Faith's simple, touching \"A Christmas Lullabye\" and Trey Lorenz's \"My Younger Days,\" built on a sample of Freddie Hubbard's \"Red Clay.\" There's an unusually high proportion of original tunes, with just a couple of workhorses like \"The Christmas Song\" (sung by Tamia), and most of them are pretty good: Gerald Levert's \"Christmas Without My Girl,\" Brian McKnight's \"Because Of His Love.\" McKnight also wrote and produced Xscape's feature, \"Christmas Without You,\" and his low-key, Babyface-singin'-like-Stevie Wonder approach underlies much of the disc (Kenny Lattimore's \"This Time Of Year\"). Trina Broussard's \"Not Really Christmas\" is perhaps the best of the bunch, with a smoky nightclub vibe, live instruments, an irresistable fade chant and an emotive but not overdone lead vocal. The sixteen-year old Alicia Keys performs a neo-soul version of \"Little Drummer Girl\" produced by Rodney Jerkins - her Erykah Badu impression sounds great, though her streetwise spoken intro is cloying. Chaka Khan sings \"Christmas Only Once A Year\"... the melody sounds very familiar but I can't quite place it. That ever happen to you? Boy, it's frustrating. Anyway, the disc is too much of a good thing - virtually all in the same style at the same tempo - but that beats the hell out of too much of a bad thing. (DBW)\n\nEminem, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000)\n\nEasily the most overrated hip hop album of the year. The music is thin, with Eminem and the other producers - Bass Brothers, F.B.T., Doctor Dre - blending brittle keyboard lines, nursery rhyme melodies and tinny beats. There are a few clever rhymes here, and Em does have a smooth delivery, but his vocabulary is mostly limited to four-letter words, and he repeats drab choruses endlessly (\"Kill You\"). He's phenomenally self-absorbed, ranting about his media representation at length that would embarass Chuck D. (\"The Way I Am\"), referring to his record sales on almost every track, and packing in trivial pop-culture references to obscure his total lack of originality or message (\"The Real Slim Shady\"). The intended-to-offend schtick that underlies his popularity is nothing new: Sticky Fingaz, who guests on \"Remember Me?,\" worked the same material with a more forceful, unhinged presentation and better backing tracks; Gravediggaz and the Geto Boys went farther describing horrific violence, without the misogynist slant; Ghostface Killah's \"Wildflower\" is a far more honest anti-woman tirade than \"Kim,\" Em's vicious verbal assault on his wife (who attempted suicide soon after the disc was released); Dre's N.W.A. blazed a trail for homophobic ignorance back in the 80s. Eminem's about as inventive and creative as a three-year-old who's discovered he can rattle his parents by saying \"fuck.\" Critics and networks (especially MTV) lining up to defend the disc are either misguidedly attempting to support free expression by ascribing non-existent artistic value (a la 2 Live Crew), or just trying to pump up their hipness quotient by backing a \"controversial\" artist popular with disaffected youth (a la Marilyn Manson). (DBW)\n\nEn Vogue, Funky Divas (1992)\n\nHighly commercialized R&B, as influenced by hip hop as by Philly soul. The four lead singers - Terry Ellis, Maxine Jones, Cindy Herron and Dawn Robinson - can really sing, and many of the arrangements here give them each a chance to shine. The hit single \"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)\" is an irresistable blend of taunting vocals, quick cuts, smooth harmonies, and a stolen James Brown riff. Now for the negatives: Svengalis Thomas McElroy and Denzil Foster are extremely derivative. Besides the uncredited Brown reference, they cover both singles from the Curtis Mayfield/Aretha Franklin collaboration Sparkle (releasing \"Giving Him Something He Can Feel\" as this album's second single), and \"Free Your Mind\" has a \"U Got The Look\" style dance rock groove and a sanitized Funkadelic chorus. And did we really need another cover of \"Yesterday,\" no matter how nice the vocals are? Nothing else matches the promise of \"My Lovin',\" but it's a step up from their debut Born To Sing, and since the band lost one of its voices and its production team soon after this release, this is the place to start if you want to have the En Vogue experience. (DBW)\n\nEsthero, Breath From Another (1998)\n\nOntario-born Jenny-Bea Englishman transformed herself into trip-hop vocalist Esthero, sounding a little like Erykah Badu, a little like Deborah Harry (\"Lounge\"), a bit like Deee-Lite and a lot like Björk (the samba-meets-screamo \"Heaven Sent\"). Generally the mood is mellow, dispassionate and detached, which doesn't normally float my boat, and while Esthero and musician/producer Doc mix up genres indiscriminately (wah-wah guitars on the otherwise Sade-like \"Country Livin'\") that's par for the course in trip-hop. What really makes the record stand out is the casual melodicism (\"Swallow Me\") and judicious use of off-kilter musical elements, which are given enough space to assert themselves without becoming gimmicks: the ballsy brass on the fragment \"Flipher Overture\"; coffeehouse acoustic guitar and film noir strings on \"That Girl.\" Her lyrics are also more ambitious than the usual dancefloor mutterings (the cosmic \"Indigo Boy\"; title track, a pointed statement of purpose). Esthero went seven years before her next release, Wikked Lil' Grrrls, which only featured Doc on two cuts, and since then she's popped up mostly on hip hop records. (DBW)\n\nEvanescence, Fallen (2003)\n\nThe Little Rock-based band exploded onto the scene with this major label debut, driven by three very different songwriters: goth frontwoman Amy Lee, hard rock guitarist Ben Moody, and Christian rock keyboardist David Hodges. Their three styles coalesced into a sound - tuneful but vaguely \"alternative\"; overflowing with angst and emotion but highly professional; equal parts mournful synths and raging guitar distortion - that's immediately identifiable (though not far from Lacuna Coil's). The first two tracks, both singles, set the tone: \"Bring Me To Life\" (with nü-metal style vocals from Paul McCoy) and \"Going Under\" are constructed more like dance tracks than traditional rockers, fading guitars, strings, keyboard, live and programmed drums up and down in the mix as Lee emotes. \"My Immortal\" - another big hit - and \"Hello\" don't fit the mold: they're essentially straight ballads. Though it's all a bit overwrought and precious (\"My Last Breath\"), there are enough satisfying riffs (\"Whisper\"; \"Tourniquet\") and thrilling vocals (\"Everybody's Fool\") to reward you for persisting through it all. Produced by Moody and Dave Fortman. Hodges left right before the record was released, Moody split shortly afterwards, and the band became Lee's show. (DBW)\n\nYonca Evcimik, Şöhret (2008)\n\nEvcimik originally made a name for herself as an actress and dancer, but shot to far greater fame after recording her first album - 1991's Abone - in her late twenties. This disc (her most recent) contains seven new songs and two remixes, so it's on the border between an EP and LP (please don't call it an ELP), but there's a lot going on here: three tracks feature U.Ur, evidently an acoustic rock combo led by Ceyhun Pome (\"Ah Be Yonca,\" with a cute quote from \"On Broadway\"). Evcimik ranges from funky pop (title track) to up-down techno (\"Çapkın Kız\") and succeeds in each field she essays. Not counting the remixes, \"Anasının Kuzusu\" is the only tune that doesn't pull its weight. Arranged by Onur Betin. (DBW)\n\nFor Real, It's A Natural Thang (1994)\n\nFour young black women with really strong voices. Make you think of En Vogue? The producers apparently did too - everything from the programmed pseudo-hip hop drumming to the sassy lyrics (\"You Don't Wanna Miss\") and vocal style sound like an En Vogue knockoff, and that band was only marginally original to start with. The album has one key track, the a capella \"You Don't Know Nothin',\" with lovely harmonies and a hummable tune - after hearing them sing that at a Stevie Wonder concert, I was looking forward to hearing this. But everything else is mechanical and obvious, with trite lyrics (\"I'm Thinking Of You\") and familiar-sounding tunes - the only other enjoyable one is \"I Like.\" The group's close-cropped hair and dressed-down appearance is a sign that they really do want to be more than someone else's shadow, and the fact that many of the tunes are band-written has some potential for future growth, but this debut is not auspicious. (DBW)\n\nFor Real, Free (1996)\n\nUsually it's a bad sign when a group starts posing nude on their album covers. But this is actually a definite step up from their debut: Dallas Austin took over as main producer, and he chucked the high-tech hip-hop in favor of 60s retro: live-sounding piano, bass and drums. This makes for fewer distractions from the group's vocals, and he's also written a bunch of nice, smooth tunes (\"Like I Do,\" \"Hold Me\") though he occasionally slides over the boundaries of good taste (\"Good Morning Sunshine\"). Stevie Wonder's uncredited guest vocal on \"How Can I Get Close To You\" is also fun, though the tune is in a generic Boys II Men mold. Austin's influence extends to SoulShock, the other main producers - Steve Bray also sneaks in one track - and they come up with mellow, tuneful R&B on \"Remember\" and the title track. For good measure, the year's hottest songwriter Diane Warren contributes \"The Saddest Song I Ever Heard\" (it isn't). This time around the band members didn't contribute much to the songwriting, but everything else is improved, and if you're into the current wave of group-vocal R&B you should enjoy this. (DBW)\n\nFountains Of Wayne, Utopia Parkway (1999)\n\nI'm a sucker for melodious rock, but check out that rating: I do have some kind of self respect. This is the glossily produced second major-label effort by the frequently annoying pop-rock revival band, which is basically the Adam Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood show (they even produced; Schlesinger is on bass, Collingwood on guitar and dorky lead vocals). They're only even vaguely distinct when they try to rip off the Cars: cheesy synth meets 50s sock hop (title track, the high point). But even then they keep things totally professional, with slicker melodies and harmonies (\"Denise\"), and some cautiously loud guitars (\"It Must Be Summer\"). Whenever they get away from the Cars thing, they actually sound a lot like the dB's (\"The Valley Of Malls,\" which has a decent hook) - when they're not dishing out a clueless \"acid rock\" tribute (\"Go, Hippie\"), an early 70s Kinks-style number (\"Laser Show\"), or a sappy early 70s pop ballad, complete with strings (\"Prom Theme\"). Lyrically they're clever but frustrating: they push too hard with the humor, they overuse pop culture references, they're obsessed with teenage girls (no, really), and often they're just vapid. They try really hard (\"Amity Gardens\"), but they're hopelessly dull (\"Red Dragon Tattoo\"), and they're especially wimpy when they slow things down (\"Hat And Feet\"; \"A Fine Day For A Parade,\" with Ron Sexsmith on backing vocals; the shockingly generic pop song \"Troubled Times\"; \"The Senator's Daughter,\" one of the few catchy tunes). Although there is some modest entertainment in here (the chipper, economical \"Lost In Space\"), they're so tedious I found myself thinking, \"shoot me before I drop dead from boredom.\" Jody Porter is the second guitarist, and Brian Young is on drums - he sounds totally anonymous here, although he was outstanding with the Posies. (JA)\n\nGillette, On The Attack (1995)\n\nWhen Gillette's one hit \"Short Dick Man\" (bowlderized to \"Short Short Man\" - both versions are here) hit the airwaves, I thought it was a no-talent's dull entry in the BWP \"let's counter misogyny with misandry\" microgenre. But for some reason I got the CD anyway, and I'm glad I did, because more often than not her cheerful, sex-positive-if-male-negative strings of one-liners are a hoot (\"Mr. Personality\" - it's not a compliment). Most often the blend of rock vamps and yelled couplets recalls early Beastie Boys (\"Wanna Wild Thing\"), while the more dance-oriented insouciant numbers are closer to Gwen Stefani, Da Brat or even Lisa M (\"Coochie Dance\"). What it lacks in originality (\"Pay Back\" borrows the \"Tush\" riff; \"You're A Dog\" replays the George Clinton tune) the record makes up in enthusiasm (the title track with its honest-to-Satan metal guitars). Produced by 20 Fingers (Manny Mohr, Charlie Babie, J.J. Flores and Onofrio Lollino), who also produced her little-heard follow-up Shake Your Money Maker; the striking guitar solos come from Lenny Vertucci and Greg Suran. (DBW)\n\nGorguts, Obscura (1998)\n\nLike a dictionary pretending to be a novel, or a picture book pretending to be a film, the third release by this Quebec tech death unit consists of breathtaking building blocks that are nonetheless unsatisfying when considered as art. If you're in a band, you'll want to hear the innovative effects - wrenched guitars like a scab torn off a wound on \"Faceless Ones\"; heavy riffs slipping into pinch harmonics in \"The Art Of Sombre Ecstasy\"; anarchic strings in \"Earthly Love\"; jazz touches in \"La Vie Est Prelude\" - but for the ordinary listener, it's ultimately an empty experience because the effects rarely cohere into songs, let alone an album (the slow trudge \"Clouded\"). But \"Nostalgia,\" with fuzzed-out noise, funky bass and droning vamps, is a blast, and \"Sweet Silence\" packs its cacophony so densely it's never dull. Produced by the band with Pierre Rémillard. (DBW)\n\nGorillaz, Plastic Beach (2010)\n\nAs much as I defend the right of artists to break out of pigeonholes and disregard genre boundaries, I've been skeptical of all the rockers - from U2 and Radiohead to Kathleen Hanna - who switched majors to electronica and hip hop in the 90s, because it seems like a lazy route to remaining \"relevant\" compared with digging deeper into the forms that had brought them into the public eye in the first place. Damon Alborn may be the only one of the bunch to become more successful after changing paths: his Britpop band Blur made some waves, but \"virtual band\" (consisting of four cartoon characters whose parts are played by different musicians from one album to the next) Gorillaz became a worldwide multiplatinum sensation. Perhaps that's because Alborn takes the cut-and-paste freedom of modern dance music as a starting point, not the destination: he doesn't use the guest rappers (Snoop Dogg, De La Soul), unexpected genres (The Syrian National Orchestra For Arabic Music on \"White Flag\") and (gasp!) rockers (Mick Jones, Lou Reed) for cheap recognition value, but to create actual songs (\"Stylo,\" with Bobby Womack and Mos Def; ). Improbably, the Cerrone-like \"Empire Ants\" is as touching as it is danceable, and \"Rhinestone Eyes\" is even better. The mood is often downbeat (\"Stylo\") or even disconsolate (\"On Melancholy Hill,\" with hints of Peter Gabriel), with just a little party fodder (\"Glitter Freeze,\" with The Fall's Mark E. Smith; the Auto-Tuned \"Superfast Jellyfish\"). Gorillaz also put out a second album, The Fall, at the end of the year, and it seems much less substantial. (DBW)\n\nVarious, Grace Of My Heart Soundtrack (1996)\n\nIt's time to play \"Spot The Ripoff.\" In making the soundtrack for a film loosely based on the life of Carole King, producer Larry Klein decided to write new songs with current artists that sound like specific artists from the early and mid 1960s. Even when the execution is successful - J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr sounds just like Harvest-era Neil Young, For Real does a good job of imitating the Supremes - it's distasteful, and when they miss their mark it's really embarrassing: the surf music number (\"Take A Run At The Sun\") is exceptionally irritating, and the Everly Brothers imitation is tuneless tripe the real Everlys never would have come near. Bizarrely, Joni Mitchell came on board to rip off herself: \"Man From Mars,\" sung by Kristen Vigard (unless you're lucky enough to find a misprinted copy with Mitchell singing) is a copy of the For The Roses sound, with a clever, deceptively mellow arrangement and a surprisingly mundane lyric. Only a couple of tunes are more than outright knockoffs: the single \"God Give Me Strength\" written and performed by Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello is original enough, it's just not very interesting; Juned's \"Groovin' On You\" is a nice mix of psychedelic pop rock with Suzanne Vega-style breathy vocals and syncopated rhythm guitar. I don't really know who would enjoy this record, since I'd assume nostalgia buffs would rather hear the original songs by the original artists, and the ahistorical pop consumer would miss the point of all the anachronistic touches. Usually movie soundtracks are thrown together quickly and sloppily, and are forgotten as soon as the movie leaves the theaters; this time, the producers put a lot of thought and effort into the soundtrack, and it was forgettable even before the movie closed. (DBW)\n\nGrant Lee Buffalo, Copperopolis (1996)\n\nThe Mantovani of 90s alt rock, singer/songwriter/full-time egotist Grant Lee Phillips tries hard to put the \"I\" back in \"rock band.\" That leads critics to compare him to 70s icons like David Bowie and Neil Young whose personalities nearly overshadowed their own music. Indeed, Phillips' creaky, whispery tenor, soul cowboy harmonica playing, and affinity for feedback, acoustic jangle, and stately 3/4 time signatures do recall Young on Quaaludes, and bassist/keyboard player/producer Paul Kimble does toss in a Bowie-sized serving of odd instrumentation and studio tweaking. But Phillips' artsy-fartsy influences are from elsewhere: \"The Bridge\" is a flat-out Carly Simon imitation; the glacial \"All That I Have\" is an old timey torch song; the more up-tempo tunes (\"Better For Us\") recall 70s pop rock like Air Supply, Badfinger, or (at best) a mopey Wings (\"Comes To Blows\"); \"Even The Oxen\" is a John Mellencamp-style confessional anthem, and \"Homespun\" a snarling, Tom Petty-ish foot-stomper; and when Phillips' lyrics aren't full of sophomoric nihilism and self-pity (\"Hyperion And Sunset\") they retread the all-American jingoism of Mellencamp, Petty, and Bruce Springsteen (\"Bethlehem Steel,\" with a brooding string arrangement that almost salvages the song's monotonous, repetitive rhythm; \"Crackdown,\" a current events whine). Laden with dramatic flourishes, meandering melodies, and woeful low-energy angst, Phillips' sluggish tunes are usually flat and forgettable (\"The Only Way Down\"), but the few strong ones do have some emotional resonance (\"Homespun\"; \"Arousing Thunder,\" with Roger McGuinn-style guitar and vocals). Mood music for the recovering nose-ring addict. The drummer is Joey Peters, and there are a few bit players on pedal steel, violin, and horns. (JA)\n\nCee-Lo Green, The Lady Killer (2010)\n\nAtlanta hip hop/soul singer/songwriter Cee-Lo Green has shown evidence of his abundant talents since his 90s work with Goodie Mob, but he seemed to have trouble focusing: his solo debut followed so many different threads it never knit together, and for every smash success like \"Crazy\" (working with DJ Danger Mouse under the name Gnarls Barkley) there was an incoherent mess (e.g. the second Gnarls Barkley album). This time Green went to the opposite extreme, relentlessly hewing to a late 60s/early 70s retro-soul sound: \"Bodies\" is a precise imitation of an Isaac Hayes slow burn; \"No One's Gonna Love You\" copies Ron Isley; \"It's OK\" has the bounce of a 1966 H-D-H hit. The \"Billie Jean\" bite on \"Bright Lights Bigger City\" is a recent reference by comparison. Green had a smash single with \"Fuck You\" (written with 2010 ubiquity Bruno Mars), and even if you find the song's strident appeal to everyone's inner second grader cloying (as I do), it's nearly impossible to resist the joyful, bouncing groove... I believe it's the first song with the word \"You\" in the title to be nominated for a Grammy. The album as a whole follows the same pattern: as photocopied and superficial as most of it is, it's so well rendered and catchy you'll be unlikely to complain. Still, it's a relief when genuine feeling shows through the contrivance on the Gamble/Huff-like \"Fool For You\" (with sky-high backing vox from Phillip Bailey). (DBW)\n\nGreen Day, Insomniac (1995)\n\nThe follow-up to the factory-made California punk band's breakthrough album Dookie, this is a textbook example of how teenagers are manipulated by the mass media. Everything about it screams teen rebellion, from the militaristic, double-time, 80s-style punk drumbeats to the satiricial, Norman Rockwell-inspired, apocalyptic cover art to the liberal use of generic obscenities like \"shit.\" And everything about it is entirely fake, from frontman Billie Joe's affected quasi-Cockney enunciation to his monotonous, just-loud-enough guitar distortion to drummer Tre Cool's ridiculously self-referential pseudonym. Joe's idea of \"punk\" is to play at an unwavering, speedy tempo, strum power chords non-stop, stick with standard power trio instrumentation, eschew overdubs, and bitch and whine about the boredom of the middle-class American lifestyle (\"Brat\") - the kind of thing done with ten times the sincerity by older bands like the Jam and the Meat Puppets. But at heart he's just another prefab AOR professional, singing in key, playing flawlessly, arranging Beatles-style vocal harmonies, and ripping off 70s dinosaurs like the Who (\"Panic Song\"), Kinks (\"Walking Contradiction\"), and Aerosmith (\"Bab's Uvula Who?\") - at his best he has the band veer into a punk take on early 80s American New Wave (\"No Pride\"), or even REM's power-pop formula (\"Geek Stink Breath\"). Every track here sounds exactly the same, and every one is entirely dispensable in its tuneful, foot-tapping catchiness; if you had to turn one into a hit, I guess it would be \"Stuart And The Ave.\" or the metal-punk head-banger \"Brain Stew.\" For self-deluded nose-ring wearers only. (JA)\n\nJuliana Hatfield, Only Everything (1995)\n\nThe slickest and most high-profile release by the ex-Blake Babies bassist. Despite all the unromantic, depressingly poetic lyrics, Hatfield's commercial sense is unimpeachable. She plays all the guitars and keyboards and some of the bass, and proves to be a competent lead guitarist (\"Dumbfun\") and a pounding rhythm player, belying her girlish, clean-cut vocals. She puts across a series of hard-driving rockers with blazingly distorted guitars, irresistable hooks, and gobs of energy (\"OK OK\"; the lurching \"You Blues\"; best of all \"What A Life\"). She does drop to a lower gear for a demo-like experiment (\"Outsider\"), a sludgy down-tempo number (\"Bottles And Flowers\"), and some Nirvana-style quiet/loud alternation (the impressive \"Universal Heartbeat,\" with a mesmerizing Wurlitzer line; \"Dying Proof\"; \"Hang Down From Heaven\"). Golly, there's even a cut in French (\"Fleur De Lys\") and a druggy grunge waltz (\"Congratulations\"). And in a couple of places she even falls back to the breezy, innocent-sounding pop rock that marked her earlier work (\"Live On Tomorrow\"; \"My Darling,\" with a mellotron line). Some of the material does drag (\"Simplicity Is Beautiful\"), and as with all of her records the production is fairly monotonous. But this is tour de force of rock technique, from dynamics, melody and harmony right down to guitar tone. Most of the bass parts are by Dean Fisher; Josh Feese and Mike Levesque are on drums. Co-produced by Hatfield and engineers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie. (JA)\n\nTim Hawkes, Make You Worry (1998)\n\nIt's a rare record that cuts through my deep-seated prejudices. I got this disc in the mail, and the approach is one I usually hate: rambling voice-over vocals (by Hawkes) over programmed beats, plus guitars and loops masterminded by a keyboardist/producer (Brent Bodrug). But here it works, mostly because the grooves are so catchy they're just irresistable (\"Better Place,\" \"Son To Shine,\" \"What's It For\"). The bass lines (played by Drew Birston) are truly funky; the rock guitar licks (by Bruno Ierullo, Kevin Vienneau and Mike Hampson) are fierce; even the drum programming sounds fresh (Denton Whited contributes some real drumming). I'm not enthralled with Hawkes' subject matter, lyrics or delivery (\"Tell Me\" and \"What's It For\" practically define sophomoric philosphizing), but he's come up with some damn fine tunes. The slower numbers can drag, though (\"Did I Make You Worry\"), and the trip hop remixes are a waste of time, draining the energy out of some of the best material (\"Station\"). You can get more information through Bodrug's B-Group Music web site; I'd certainly be interested in hearing more Bodrug productions (hint, hint). (DBW)\n\nHelium, The Dirt Of Luck (1995)\n\nAlong with the Posies, Helium was one of the best things to come out of American rock music in the 90s. Leader Mary Timony delivers grinding, grungy, neurotic, unconventionally structured, brilliantly arranged, self-produced indie rock (\"Pat's Trick,\" a.k.a. \"Beautiful Thing\"), sometimes bordering on acts like Yo La Tengo or Pavement, but entirely distinct. Timony's ringing, deliberate instrumental and vocal hooks are insiduous (\"Silver Angel\"; \"All The X's Have Wings\"; \"Flower Of The Apocalypse\"). Her taut rhythms are methodical and tension-building (\"Trixie's Star\"). Her shy and precise vocals are remarkably angsty. She gets a sparse, intimate sound out of elaborate orchestrations. She's primarily a guitarist who plays the instrument like a converted violinist, but her grab bag is impressive, ranging from bass and drums to keyboards (the creepy, beautiful instrumental \"Comet #9\") and even xylophone (\"Baby's Going Underground\"). And although her fractured, image-strewn poetic fantasies are a little pretentious, they're always striking and intelligent. A lot of the material is too wimpy (\"Honeycomb\") or more often too arcane to be memorable, but there are still plenty of idiosyncratic masterpieces (\"Medusa\"; the head-banging \"Skeleton,\" a dissertation on dynamics; the ecstatic \"Superball\"; the straightforward rocker \"Oh The Wind And Rain,\" a.k.a. \"I Want Everything You Do\"), making this record an intermittent auditory orgasm. Ash Bowie is on bass and so on; Shawn King Devlin is on drums. (JA)\n\nLauryn Hill, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)\n\nThis solo effort by the former Fugee, mostly self-written and produced (though a lawsuit alleged otherwise), is retro soul with live bass, keyboards and occasional horns and strings over a bedrock of simple programmed beats... hardly any samples (aside from the cover of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\"). Some of the instrumental flourishes are very clever (the harp runs on the ballad \"When It Hurts So Bad\"), but they don't make up for the relentless ordinary compositions (\"Final Hour,\" \"Ex-Factor\" - the rambunctious \"Every Ghetto, Every City\" is an exception). But Hill's the rare artist who sounds credible both as a rapper and as a singer, and she gets high marks for sociopolitical relevance: the hit single \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" updates the battle of the sexes (though the verse taking underdressed women to task is a bit hypocritical coming from the micromini-clad Hill, and the slam against Koreans is doubly so); \"Final Hour\"; and the song for her young child is touching (\"To Zion,\" with an overmild guitar solo from Carlos Santana). But many of the songs are so personal to Hill they don't resonate the way confessional lyrics should (\"Lost Ones,\" \"Superstar,\" which at least has a smokey soul groove), and her lyrics can be distressingly obvious (\"Lost Ones\"). Mary J. Blige (\"I Used To Love Him\") and D'Angelo (\"Nothing Even Matters\") each drop by for a forgettable duet, and Shelley Thunder contributes a verse to the reggae-influenced \"Forgive Them Father.\" Musicians include James Poyser (keys), Grace Paradise (harp), Johari Newton (guitar), Chris Meredith (bass), Dean Frasier (sax), Everol Ray (trumpet). Hill racked up ten Grammy nominations and won five including Album of the Year, but has released almost nothing since. (DBW)\n\nHole, Live Through This (1994)\n\nCourtney Love has a lot of talent, all right: too bad most of it is for self-promotion. The leader of this Seattle grunge outfit can occasionally put together a solid lyric (\"Doll Parts\") and has an enviable Brian Johnson yell, but she relies way too heavily on three pet themes - ambivalent reflections on beauty standards, getting sick, and dying - and one arranging concept: alternating quiet and loud sections, which the band does on every single song, even the punk rave-up \"She Walks On Me.\" Kristen Pfaff on bass and Eric Erlandson on guitar (with Love) gamely repeat two- and three-chord progressions with mild distortion; Patty Schemel plays a solid, original drum part on \"Gutless,\" but spends much of the album bashing on her kit apparently at random. At times it all sounds like Blondie without the hooks or danceability (\"Credit In The Straight World\"). The musical and lyrical approach is so unvarying you might think you're listening to the same song twelve times, the only variety being the repeated commonplace serving as a chorus: \"Plump,\" \"Miss World,\" \"Jennifer's Body,\" \"I Think That I Would Die\" - I can't tell the goddamn difference. Cleanly produced by Paul O. Holderine and Sean Slade; no listed guests, but Kat Bjelland co-wrote one tune. (DBW)\n\nThe Honeydogs, Everything, I Bet You (1996)\n\nMinnesota's greatest Jewish alt-country band - no, really - got national attention with its minor-label sophomore album, jump-started by their superbly melodious, mid-tempo love song \"Your Blue Door.\" Lead vocalist/guitarist Adam Levy writes everything, and he's genuinely talented, delivering well-structured tunes, solid hooks, thoughtful lyrics, and just enough stylistic variety to keep things interesting. The rest of the band has a raw, sincere sound, although they're a bit faceless (Noah Levy, drums and backing vocals; Trent Norton, bass; Tommy Borschied, lead guitar). They've got a soft spot for slow-paced, dominantly acoustic, super-sincere country, which suits Adam Levy's warm, confessional baritone quite well (\"Miles Away\"; the dreamily waltzing instrumental \"P'Twgs\"). They even take a couple stabs at jumpy, chugging honky tonk (\"Kandiyohi\"; the clichéd \"Busy Man\"). It's pleasant, and they score with a series of sweet, innocent love songs (the aching \"Bad Day, Good Night\"; the old timey \"Over You\"; \"Miriam,\" much like \"Blue Door\" and just as good). And fortunately they mix things up with some surprisingly aggressive, Replacements-style college rock (\"Glee\") that reflects similar influences like the Rolling Stones (the foot-stomping \"Tell Me\") and Gram Parsons (\"Moth\"). One of the key alt-country records of the decade. Co-produced by the band and Tom Herbers, with several incidental players like Jon Duncan (accordion, keyboards), Mike \"Raz\" Russell (fiddle), and John \"Strawberry\" Fields (wurlitzer). I've never seen their 1995 debut, but I've seen them live. (JA)\n\nThe Honeydogs, Seen A Ghost (1997)\n\nIt's weird, Levy's talent is everywhere here but it just doesn't add up to much. With more cash on hand he uses more elaborate production - there's a string quartet on several cuts (the pretty, stripped-down \"Sweat Pea\"); \"Into Thin Air\" has a Revolver-like psychedelic sound; and the respectable Replacements imitation \"Twitch\" is a little weird too. But mostly it's the same kind of thing. And talk about spinning gears: there's even an ill-advised rerecording of \"My Blue Door\" with the same basic arrangement. There are some brisk, jangly tunes with catchy hooks (\"Rumor Has It\"; the late 70s English New Wave-style \"Cut Me Loose, Napoleon\"), they're fairly successful when they go back to their country-rock sound (\"Those Things Are Hers\"; the reverby, mellow title track; \"Mainline,\" with a nice walking bass line), a few tunes create some drama (\"Donna's 7\"), and Levy's slashing rhythm guitar brings a Stones-y sound to some of the midtempo rockers (\"Cherub\"), while his witty, colorful, slightly morbid lyrics are intriguing. But when they slow things down and throw in some sugar they practically sound like John Cougar (\"I Miss You\"), and the country tunes can be pretty generic (\"Sans Sucre\"). Good music to chill out by, but it's often just plain dull (\"Old John Brown\"), there are no real standout tracks, and basically the record is nothing special. Co-produced again by the band and Tom Herbers. Bit players include Fields, and on many tracks Duncan; Al Kooper shows up on two numbers as well. I've also got 2001's overproduced Here's Luck, which is no improvement. (JA)\n\nIhsahn, Eremita (2012)\n\nBest known as the frontman for Norwegian black metal band Emperor, Ihsahn has spent the last decade focusing on his solo work, which retains some black metal touches (\"The Paranoid,\" perhaps the most conventional number) while incorporating a host of other influences, frequently venturing into long songs and instrumental flights of fancy (\"The Eagle And The Snake\"). He's black metal's Porcupine Tree, sort of, and continuing the parallel, though he's a talented songwriter and arranger (the soaring \"Arrival\"), his supersized soundscapes can test your patience (\"The Grave\"). Even the few unsuccessful cuts are incongruous enough to hold your attention (the squalling sax opposite croaked vocals on the not-very-cathartic \"Catharsis\"). Ultimately, the weakness of the album is that it's so focused on technique it's less than involving emotionally; still, it's worth hearing: Metal fans are often stereotyped as unwilling to step outside their comfort zones; Ihsahn takes enough risks that you should find something to challenge your sensibilities no matter what kind of music you normally listen to (\"The Departure,\" which veers between headbanging riffage and Jane Siberry-ish gossamer). (DBW)\n\nImmolation, Majesty And Decay (2010)\n\nVisceral, unironic and deliberately unhip, death metal doesn't seem very New York-y, and in fact this quartet is from Yonkers, just outside the city limits. They've followed the same basic blueprint since their 1991 debut: twin guitars playing extremely dissonant low-end patterns, with angry growling from frontman/bassist Ross Dolan and the drums (via Steve Shalaty) loping along behind. Similarly, every song has the same basic structure and mood, apart from the grand, drama-filled \"The Rapture Of Ghosts\" and a couple of link tracks (the factually if unimaginatively titled \"Interlude\"). The best material - \"The Comfort Of Cowards\"; title track - is ear-catching and exhilarating, with the sort of mindbending licks that technical death metal bands might come across, but taking enough time to explore them before rushing off somewhere else. Most of the material isn't up to that level, but their approach to composition is so idiosyncratic the misses are as novel and unpredictable as the successes: the riffs may leave you unfulfilled - often, even - but they won't remind you of anyone else's riffs, and the same goes for Robert Vigna's twisted, cryptic leads. (DBW)\n\nIn Flames, Whoracle (1997)\n\nGenerally considered the high-water mark for this Gothenberg melodic death metal crew, with the menacing snarls, ferocity and precise riffing that define the mini-genre. Though there's no singing of actual notes, otherwise they cover a lot of territory, revving up to near-punk speed on \"Morphing Into Primal,\" changing pace on the slow multi-part \"Jester Script Transifigured,\" and using an unexpected amount of acoustic guitar (the closing title track). They also make heavy use of harmonized lead guitars (\"The Hive\") in a manner reminiscent of The Scorpions - crap, am I gonna have to review them too? - inspiring successors such as Trivium. So they have a lot of compelling elements, but the actual tunes are very dull and dry, with the best rising to the level of \"adequate\" (\"Jotun\"; \"Episode 666\"): song after song starts out with promise then goes nowhere (\"Food For The Gods\"). Oh, and I have no idea what they were getting at with their deafening cover of Depeche Mode's irritating \"Everything Counts.\" (DBW)\n\nIn From The Storm (1995)\n\nEddie Kramer put together an amazing lineup for this Jimi Hendrix tribute album: a melange of top guitarists (Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin, Robben Ford, Steve Vai, Steve Lukather, Brian May), Hendrix associates (Noel Redding, Buddy Miles, Billy Cox, Mike Finnegan), and highly respected non-rock musicians (Taj Mahal, Tony Williams, Stanley Clarke, Bootsy Collins, Toots Thielemans). Most tracks also feature the London Metropolitan Orchestra, which sounds out of place even on the mellower tunes (\"Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)\") thanks to overly obtrusive arrangements by (variously) Nick Ingman, Joe Mardin, Michael Kamen and Bernie Worrell. The guitarists are mostly content to imitate Jimi's signature style, without adding much of their own personalities (Vai is the most impressively lyrical). As a result, it's like listening to Jimi on an off day, with a bunch of noisy strings on top, and unsurprisingly, the best track is the one with no guitars: Thielemans's affecting harmonica version of \"Little Wing.\" Though it's a dull listen overall, the disc indirectly reveals how underrated Hendrix is as a vocalist: the high-quality stand-ins - Paul Rodgers, Corey Glover, Sting - fall short of Jimi's original vocal every single time. (DBW)\n\nInfectious Grooves, Sarsippius' Ark (1993)\n\nThis funk-metal outfit was a Suicidal Tendencies side project: frontman Mike Muir and bassist Robert Trujillo (who co-wrote all the tunes) plus temporary drummer Josh Freese were concurrently in ST, and rhythm guitarist Dean Pleasants joined up later, so only lead guitarist Adam Siegel was a true outsider. I get the feeling that the sole impetus behind the group was that Trujillo wanted to show off his formidable funk bass skills, because Muir doesn't have much to say (\"Don't Stop, Spread The Jam!\") and there's no real metal influence, just lots of guitar distortion (\"Turtle Wax\"). As a result, the sound is VERY close to the Red Hot Chili Peppers (\"These Freaks Are Here To Party\"), except that the recording quality is sketchy (\"Infectious Grooves,\" cut to 8-track by an earlier lineup). There are two covers, and I don't know which is more damning: that they can't find anything interesting to do with \"Immigrant Song,\" or that the straight-up take on \"Fame\" is the album's highlight. Almost forgot to mention: nearly every track is prefaced by a longwinded, unfunny introduction by \"Sarsippius,\" who sounds suspiciously like the Funky Granny, only far less entertaining (\"Legend In His Own Mind (Ladies Love 'Sip)\"). (DBW)\n\nInfectious Grooves, Groove Family Cyco (1994)\n\nIf you're curious about the band, make sure you start here. The same basic approach as the previous disc, but it works eight million times better. First of all, most of the silliness is gone: no Sarsippius interludes, no lo-fi home recordings. The metal elements are baked-in, not pasted on, from the blastoff \"Violent & Funky.\" Trujillo's bass is as far-forward as ever, but this time there's something for him to play off of (\"Boom Boom Boom\"). Muir finds some content to sink his teeth into, with a loose concept about a family of lunatics (title track; the ultra-creepy, strangely affectionate spoken-word \"Cousin Randy,\" which is almost in Les Claypool territory). And the capper is a hilarious slap at/parody of Rage Against The Machine, \"Do What I Tell Ya!\" Produced by Michael Vail Blum. (DBW)\n\nInner City Blues: The Music Of Marvin Gaye (1995)\n\nTribute albums have a common set of problems: tackily \"modern\" updating of classic songs, weak performances by flavors of their respective months, and Bono singing with a dead person. This set steps right into all of those traps. Madonna's trance take on \"I Want You\" (with Massive Attack) is sterile and dull; \"good for you\" rappers Digable Planets and Speech each get a track full of blathering (\"Mavin, You're The Man,\" \"Like Marvin Said (What's Going On)\"); and Bono embarasses himself (if such a thing is still possible) with an ex post facto duet with Marvin on \"Save The Children.\" Mostly the best work is by artists who stay close to Marvin's original approach: R&B crooners Boys II Men doing \"Let's Get It On\"; Sounds Of Blackness in a gospelly medley of \"God Is Love/Mercy Mercy Me.\" Marvin's daughter Nona Gaye gets the plum title track (produced by Me'Shell NdegéOcello with Wendy & Lisa), but her performance is drab. The set list focuses on Marvin's 70s work almost exclusively - fair enough, since he didn't write many of his 60s hits. There's one redeeming, transcendent moment: Stevie Wonder's rollicking rendition of \"Stubborn Kind Of Fellow\" (with For Real on backing vocals) not only outshines the original hit, it's more playful and energetic than anything Stevie's cut in ages. (DBW)\n\nJoi, Star Kitty's Revenge (2002)\n\nJoi is vaguely similar to Erykah Badu - high, thin voice; retro approach; outré presentation - but on closer examination the differences outweigh the similarities: Joi relies heavily on electronic-sounding production, is much more interested in being wild and crazy (\"Lick\") than in projecting intelligence or depth, and she's completely missing Badu's lyrical and melodic skills. Dallas Austin serves up some of his usual high-tech backing without his usual taste: \"Techno Pimp,\" with an overprocessed rap, repetitive bass vamp, and squealing chorus, is perhaps the most annoying song I've ever heard, \"Mr. Neo-Soul\" Rafael Saadiq co-produced and played guitar and bass on several tracks. The genre-mandatory Chaka Khan cover is \"I'm A Woman (I'm A Backbone)\"; there's also a cover of Bootsy Collins' \"Munchies For Your Love\" that's deadly dull without his epic bass solo. \"Missing You\" has a nice middle, with bass and guitar by Van Hunt, but it's awfully little awfully late. Joi's 1994 debut The Pendulum Vibe is supposed to be great... unless I find it real cheap I'm never going to find out. (DBW)\n\nJudgment Night (1993)\n\nSoundtrack to a horror flick; the unoriginal idea here was to pair hard rock/metal bands with rappers, which had been done years before by UTFO and Public Enemy, both working with Anthrax. None of those acts appear here, instead there's a succession of well-known and obscure artists. Most often the strategy is to rap over heavy metal backing: this is most successful with Slayer and Ice-T on \"Disorder,\" partly because the band bangs out their hi-speed riffs with precision, partly because Ice-T sounds comfortable here (at the time he fronted his own hardcore band, Body Count). Also Living Colour and Run-DMC mesh well on \"Me, Myself & My Microphone,\" plus Dinosaur Jr and Del The Funky Homosapien crank out the catchy \"Missing Link.\" The record's big disappointment is Sonic Youth's collaboration with Cypress Hill: the music is dull hip hop trance, with only the occasional sonik guitar sound, and Kim repeating herself like she's meditating on Valium, while the rappers create yet another boring ode to marijuana. The rest of the tracks are predictable: Biohazard and Onyx are violent but dull, De La Soul is mellow and samples a crummy Tom Petty tune (\"Fallin'\"), House of Pain rants and whines, Sir Mix-A-Lot reports his pornographic fantas"
