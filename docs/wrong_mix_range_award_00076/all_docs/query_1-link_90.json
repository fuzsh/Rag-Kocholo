        "text": "Again the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded by the Swedish Academy. Again no American had arisen to such distinction. The recipient was Ladislas St. Reymont, Pole, aged 56, author of 23 volumes of short stories and novels, in particular author of The Peasants (4 vols., 1902-06), for which the prize this year was given. In form a novel, the work actually constitutes a review of Poland’s history since her partition at the close of the 18th Century.\n\nAuthor Reymont, one of the dozen children of poor parents, grew up under the hardships to which so many Slavic writers have been heirs. Early expelled from school for refusing to abandon his native language for the Russian, he tried variously to make a livelihoodâ€”as store clerk, telegraph operator, actor, rail employe, farm hand, Paulist novice. He wrote his first short story, The Death, in 1894. He is now working on a cycle of six novels, of which one will have its setting in the U. S., whither he came in 1919 to study the life of Polish peasants who had emigrated.\n\nThe Nobel Prize brought Author Reymont about $40,000.\n\nWinners of Nobel Prizes in Literature:\n\nYEAR NAME NATIONALITY\n\n1923. . . .William B.

Mr. Cabell’s Straws and Prayerbooks* is a book which admirers of Mr. Cabell will find admirable and most of the others will find dull. The author of Jurgen I have never met, although I have several times met his delightful wife. In Richmond, one hears much of this local hero, who is from a long line of Virginians. His loyal friends attest his charm. He is visited by such literary figures as Hergesheimer, Van Vechten, Elinor Wylie. They return with fine words concerning his charm. As a writer, I find him positively the hero of the U. S. undergraduate of the intellectual type. His books I admire for their grace and elaborate technique; but all this is a prelude to the statement that, for the most part, I find his writings dull, and I seem to be fairly alone in this opinion.\n\nFrom The Literary Spotlight I quote a description:\n\n“Cabell is a man of medium height, and of a somewhat stocky figure. His head is finely molded with the broad forehead of the esthete and the thinker, not unlike that of the young Augustus; his eyes are heavy-lidded and sleepy, such eyes as one often sees in old portraits of the cavaliers and courtiers of the time of the Stuarts, rather insolent and a little bored; his mouth is delicately cut and sensitive, generous yet not too full, the mouth of a poet but not of a philosopher; and between those eyes and this mouth he has a quizzical little snout.”\n\nCabell was born at Richmond in 1879 and has lived there most of his life. He was graduated from William and Mary College in 1898, has taught French and Greek and has a hobby for studying and writing about genealogical subjects. This is shown forth in the publication of such efforts as Branchiana, Branch of Abingdon, The Majors and Their Marriages, etc., etc.\n\nWhatever else he may be, he occupies a lonely and a wistful place in American letters. The age of chivalry is not with us; and he writes beautifully and grotesquely of some chivalric code manufactured by himself in his mystical land of Poictesme. As he himself is withdrawn from people, so his books are withdrawn from life, and yet all the time his pretty visions are punctuated by shafts of irony.\n\nJ.F.\n\n*STRAWS AND PRAYERBOOKSâ€”James Branch Cabellâ€”McBride ($2.50)."
