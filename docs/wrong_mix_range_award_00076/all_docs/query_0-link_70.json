Since March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".\n\nAs per Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway. Since 1990, the prize is awarded on 10 December in Oslo City Hall each year. The prize was formerly awarded in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law (1947–1989), the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905–1946), and the Parliament (1901–1904).\n\nDue to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the subject of controversies.\n\nFast & Free Shipping within U.S.A.\n\nWe Care for your order, Pack it carefully and ship it within 24 hours.\n\nSatisfaction Guaranteed!\n\nPlease explore our store for more stamps, souvenir sheets, post-office collectibles and philately books and pre-philatelic items:\n\nmeditative.philately\n\nSeller Information\n\nSeller\n\nMeditativePhilately (468)\n\nRegistered Since\n\n04/09/2018\n\nFeedback\n\n100%\n\nStore\n\nMeditative Philately\n\nItem Location\n\nNew York, United States\n\nShips To\n\nWorldwide\n\nPostage Calculator\n\nSelect Country\n\nQuantity\n\nReturns Accepted\n\nNo"
