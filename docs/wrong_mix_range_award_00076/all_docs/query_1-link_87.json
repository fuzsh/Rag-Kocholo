Taken in 1915, it showcases Maeterlinck's distinguished presence as he poses for the camera. As a member of the Symbolist movement, Maeterlinck's contribution to literature was highly regarded. In fact, his exceptional talent earned him the prestigious Nobel Prize for Literature in 1911. While he wrote numerous works throughout his career, one of his most famous plays is \"The Blue Bird\" which was published in 1908. In this photograph from Album de Photographies dans L'Intimite de Personnages Illustres (1855-1915), we see Maeterlinck dressed impeccably in a uniform that reflects both his occupation and personal style. His hat - a straw boater - adds an elegant touch to his ensemble while emphasizing his status as an esteemed writer. Maeterlinck's piercing gaze reveals both intelligence and depth. It is evident that this portrait captures not only the physical appearance but also the essence of a man deeply dedicated to his craft. The monochrome effect further enhances the timeless quality of this image. Overall, this print offers us a glimpse into the life and legacy of Maurice Maeterlinck – an influential figure whose literary contributions continue to inspire generations today.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
