        "text": "A Flock of Seagulls‘ eponymous debut album will be reissued as a triple-CD deluxe edition, and on coloured vinyl, in February next year.\n\nOriginally released in 1982, A Flock Of Seagulls was a significant success in America, reaching the top 10 in the album charts. The second single from the album, ‘I Ran (So Far Away)’ was also a top ten hit in the US and was an early sign of the so-called Second British Invasion, which saw British synth-pop or new wave acts enjoy chart success Stateside, in part, thanks to MTV.\n\nCuriously, both the album and the single enjoyed less success in the UK; indeed, ‘I Ran’ didn’t even crack the top 40 singles chart in Britain (the group’s only UK top 10 single was ‘Wishing (If I Had A Photograph Of You’ from the second album, Listen).\n\nThe (slightly belated) 40th Anniversary 3CD reissue includes the original album remastered, as well as b-sides, singles, BBC Sessions and a BBC concert held at the Paris Theatre, London, which was originally transmitted in January 1982. SDE contributor John Earls contributes notes which include an interview with A Flock Of Seagulls lead singer and founding member Mike Score. The album is also being reissued on coloured (orange) vinyl.\n\nThis expanded reissue of A Flock Of Seagulls will be released on 17 February 2023 via BMG."
