But if the universe is somehow aligned in a way that I ever have children, I will have to alter my music listening habits slightly. My taste in music is too Peter Gabrielish, and I'm not usually a big fan of cutesy, bright and bubbly music meant for children. ...But then here comes this Sean Altman guy with this insanely likable pop album that's not only cute and silly enough for the chilluns, but it's also melodically and lyrically clever enough to appeal to us bigguns, too. Why, this must be the most adult/kid-friendly albums that I ever reviewed!\n\nSean Altman had once been the lead singer of Rockapella, an a cappella group that's most famous for doing the theme song for the PBS game show Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. He and the group were also pretty intimately involved with the show itself (singing clues for the contestants). In 1997, he left the group to embark on a solo career. ...Evidently, he had been hoping to get a big studio contract, and SeanDEMOnium (you'll never guess) was his demo! He evidently didn't get the recording contract based on the fact that I'm listening to a demo, and he worked in a few recorded phone conversations he had with record company receptionists. (They do not accept unsolicited material... Ahhhh... poor guy...)\n\nBut how on earth could the record companies have stonewalled him? This demo is delightful; it's quirky, humorous, and overflowing with memorable melodies. Since he was formerly head of an a cappella singing group, you can expect that most of these songs on his solo debut are a cappella as well. And for my money, these are the album's most endearing moments. I can listen to this guy singing his warm, charming a cappella music all day. And I normally hate that sort of music. It usually comes off as pretentious, like we're supposed to be automatically impressed with people for having singing voices... (You were born with it! Get over yourselves!!) But Sean Altman comes off as an instantly likable guy in these songs. You'll want to invite him over to your house for a barbecue.\n\nLet's highlight some of the songs. ï¿½Personï¿½ is just a solid, soaring composition that's sure to make you smile. The follow-up, ï¿½Baby Go Bye-Byeï¿½ is quirky and fun, particularly noting his playful back-up vocals. Another major highlight is ï¿½Miserable Destinyï¿½ with its striking, quirky '50s doo-wop vocal back-up style and that strange, muttering rant prominently featured. Not only is he excellent at quirky compositions, but ballads are usually great. His ï¿½Marry Meï¿½ is rather fluffy, but his sincere, soaring vocal performance completely wins me over. Similarly, ï¿½Pretty Babyï¿½ is a heartfelt romantic song, and ï¿½My Parents' Sonï¿½ is a loving tribute to his parents.\n\nHe also has this funny habit of creating a lot of very brief, throwaway tracks. Many of them are four seconds long and consist of Altman singing the song title. ï¿½Seandemonium-Bop,ï¿½ ï¿½Big Sean Music NY,ï¿½ ï¿½Ooooh-Angst,ï¿½ ï¿½Sullen Malaise,ï¿½ ï¿½Male Pattern Baldness.ï¿½ Sort of pointless, but it's quirky so whatever. When you see that this album has a whopping 30 tracks in it, you'll have to note that this is why! Other songs are a little more lengthy and perhaps not quite as ï¿½throwaway.ï¿½ One track, ï¿½The Pink Pigï¿½ appears to be Altman and his nephew fooling around. Another, ï¿½Day's Easy Moan,ï¿½ is a brief interlude of quirky circus music.\n\nIt must be said that SeanDEMOnium isn't a very good pick for cynics out there. If you automatically cringe at the thought of listening to a sweetly romantic song about a marriage proposal or a loving tribute to his parents, then you might want to steer clear of this. Although, I consider myself cynical, or at least 80 percent cynical, and I managed to enjoy this album quite a lot. Sure, I generally cringe at the thought of listening to cutesy, fluffy music, but how could you think ill of him if he's so sincere at it? I suppose this album would have sounded nicer if he gave it a full studio treatment with polishï¿½and the record companies really missed out on the chance to have a hit recordï¿½but as it stands, SeanDEMOnium is a charming piece of work that showcases his considerable songwriting abilities and his warmth, humor and sincerity as a singer.\n\nParticularly if you're a minivan-driving parent who doesn't find it appropriate to play Slayer albums on roadtrips, you must get this album. I DECLARE IT IN CAPITAL LETTERS AND EXCESSIVE EXCLAMATION MARKS, YOU MUST!!!! You can get it on the Internet. If you're reading this review, then you're probably on the Internet right now, so you have no excuse. Off with thee to order it!\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nSeanDEMOnium\n\nBad Brains: Bad Brains (1982)\n\nAlbum Score: 12\n\nHardcore punk ain't exactly my music. I listen to this album as a curious outsider trying to objectively ï¿½dissectï¿½ this music, which probably isn't the way you're supposed to listen to it. I am a whitebread suburbanite. Unlike, say, when I review Elton John or Genesis records, I don't come into this already swept away by them. So, whatever. There's my ï¿½this review isn't written in the point-of-view of a fanï¿½ disclaimer. That said, this isn't the first time I reviewed albums that lie somewhere outside of my comfort realm. It's not even the first hardcore punk album I reviewed. I ain't no n00b. Let's get on with it!!!\n\nIt was the year 1982, which was pretty early for hardcore punk. If the writers at Wikipedia can be trusted at all, this was one of the first hardcore punk albums of all time... Maybe they even invented it. Who knows? Who cares? All I know is that Bad Brains is full of some pretty freaking wild stuff. It's likely small potatoes when compared to other hardcore punk bands who came later. In fact I know it is, because I actually enjoy listening to this album. (Believe me, I'm as surprised as you are... Perhaps moreso...)\n\nThe big surprise, of course, is that these guys don't look like they should be a punk band. They're BLACK. I feel like I'm Mr. Bently in the first episode of The Jeffersons... I'm their eccentric neighbor living in an upscale Manhattan apartment complex... I invite myself in and talk eccentric neighbory things, I leave for a bit and then barge back in exclaiming ï¿½Good God, you're BLACK!ï¿½ What's more, they're all members of the Rastafarian religion. So, in addition to being black, they're whacked-up pot-heads. Way to go shatter my image of hardcore punk bands. (Sorry for that bad analogy just now... I just wanted to talk about The Jeffersons.)\n\nThere are a few slow-moving reggae numbers awkwardly inserted in this album, which is where the Rastafarian thing comes in. I find the reggae numbers to be quite bland....... But they're kinda like intermission periods. They give me the needed opportunity to catch my breath a bit before the next hardcore punk song comes up. I appreciate that. Quite a lot.\n\nOf course the hardcore punk songs are the star of the show. I don't know why I didn't start talking about those in the first place. They're loud, fast-paced, wild and sloppy... in other words, they're all hardcore punk is supposed to be. The lead singer doesn't so much sing as he does yell and growl. Occasionally he will yelp. At one point, he even yodels. He isn't the most distinctive singer I've heard, but I've gotta give him credit for being craaaaazy enough for me to spend much of a paragraph talking about him. He's not quite Jello Biafra, but he's amusing. The guitars, of course, are similarly wild, crazy and somewhat undistinctive. Sometimes, I hear a rather exciting fast-paced solo. Other times, I hear a series of ultra-fuzzed-up power chords. Even the drummer gets a little nuts... In particular, he seems to favor these super-fast drum rolls. It's nothing too complicatedï¿½in fact they're a little blandï¿½but he plays them as fast as he damn well can!!\n\nThe songwriting is pretty good for punk music. Nothing in here is especially memorableï¿½no great riffs or melodies to speak of. But there's this funny, sort of unpredictability to these songs that keeps me on my toes. At one point, they might be stuck in some sort of mid-tempo power-chord phase before they launch pretty quickly into their fast-paced punk stuff... The other hardcore punk outfit I had intimate exposure to were The Dead Kennedys, who are probably more exciting to me. But Bad Brains aren't too far behind them thanks to their flagrant, sloppy style and that unpredictable edge. The production on Bad Brains doesn't seem too good. It's rather murky, and sometimes I can't make out the singing. Although, even if it were a little clearer, I wouldn't be able to make it out anyway... he's screaming, growling, and yelping, after all. Murky production standards aren't exactly the sort of thing punk fans usually complain about, so I'll shut up about it...\n\nAll in all, this is a good album. I usually hate hardcore punk, but I enjoyed this. Somehow. I can report that my opinion of African-American Rastafarians has improved. Even though they're still a bunch of wacko cultists who invented their religion as an excuse to smoke pot all day. ...Hey, these guys got a job, though. What a world!\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nBad Brains\n\nBilly Thorpe & The Aztecs: More Arse Than Class (1974)\n\nAlbum Score: 12\n\nIf you thought Crocodile Dundee was wild, then you haven't heard Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs, a rabble-rousing hard-rock group from Down Under. These guys knew how to bottle lightning. After listening to More Arse Than Class, it's no surprise that they were one of the most popular 1970s hard-rock groups from Australia, but why haven't they gained fame in the United States where similar bands like Grand Funk Railroad, Foghat, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, and ... other bands were making names for themselves? I don't see any reason other than geography that they couldn't have made it big in the States... Ah, I guess we can say that about a lot of things!\n\nThe album opens with the rollicking ï¿½Boogie Woogieï¿½ whose song title tells no lie. It is indeed a boogie woogie. It's also a peculiar boogie woogie with its menacing pace and those crazy ascending key-changes toward the end. Billy Thorpe's powerful, raspy vocals are also an amazing thing to behold. They bear a resemblance to Roy Wood's, but with slightly more body. I also bring up Roy Wood, because ï¿½Boogie Woogieï¿½ reminds me of Wizzard. It's normal genre music, but with a slightly alien edge to it. And it's very good, too!\n\nProbably the greatest testament of Thorpe's vocal prowess is the epic closing track ï¿½Slowly Learning How.ï¿½ It alters back and forth between a soulful blues number and a tight rock 'n' roll groove resembling early Dire Straits. Thorpe's utterly soaring vocals have the same effect on me as Joe Cocker's ... and bringing in that gospel choir at the end only made me wish I would have joined in with them. That song is hardly amazing as a composition (it does nothing more than repeat those two sections for the entire nine-minutes), but it's such a rousing experience that I'd gladly listen to it many more times. And I probably will.\n\nï¿½I Wanna Knowï¿½ is also a gospel-oriented number, and Thorpe's commanding lead vocals keep the song exciting. The melody is catchy, and I like that ascending chord progression its based on. But I'd have to say the star of that show is that wily harmonica solo in the middle. If one thing's clear about Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs, they were a first-class jam band.\n\nAnd that fact about them couldn't be any more clearer than it is on ï¿½Back on the Road Again,ï¿½ which is such a powerful rocker that is so tight and exciting that I can't contain myself! (I'm not kidding, either, I'm hopped up on adrenaline right now.) It's obvious they're emulating '50s rock, but it's impossible to not get caught up in its spirit. The drive of that song is amazing, and Thorpe's lead vocals take an incredibly commanding lead over it. Perhaps even more amazing is that extended jam sequence in the middle. It takes a lot for me to enjoy a rock 'n' roll jam, but I rarely run across things this exciting. When that Jerry-Lee-Lewis-style piano solo comes in, it's like nothing could be more thrilling... It starts playing normally, but it starts to favor the high-pitched keys in the middle and also plays some brilliantly weird patterns. The electric guitar solo operates in a similar fashion... it's normal and exciting at first, but it turns into something more fuddled and hyperactive. Crikey!\n\nStill good, but not one of the highlights is the energetic R&B number ï¿½Walking Down the Street.ï¿½ Thorpe's spirited vocals that opens the track is hilarious (at one point nearly going off in a rant), but unfortunately whoever was in charge of producing this album did a weird number on the panning effects... It's painful to listen to this song with headphones. ï¿½No More Warï¿½ is apparently a psychedelic anthem with a rubbery guitar brought in throughout and that huge reverb sound put on the vocals. It's jam-oriented, but it's not quite as arresting as the others I've already mentioned.\n\nIt's a shame that Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs aren't well-known in America. This style of music is still very popular around here, and if I'm able to enjoy the crap out of this, then there are millions of others who are bound to like it more. Trust me, if you've had your fill of all the Foghat you could handle (as if that's possible!), and you're feeling a little bit like visiting the land of wallabies and Vegemite, then you should put Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs on your list. Even if you're not, then you should still consider giving them a try. After all, they seemed very passionate about rock 'n' roll, and they could rock like nobody's business. That's more than I get from most hard rock bands. Plus, it's kind of cool to have an album called More Arse Than Class on your iPod just to see the reaction on people's faces.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nMore Arse Than Class\n\nBelle and Sebastian: If You're Feeling Sinister (1996)\n\nAlbum Score: 13\n\nThis album consistently makes the upper portion of every critics' list of best albums of the '90s. While that's impressive I suppose, that doesn't automatically mean I'm going to like it. After all, music magazines are awfully prone to exhibiting a bandwagon mentality when it comes to ranking music. Since it's toward the top of every list, I automatically became suspicious of it. I listened to this casually over the years, and my initial impression was that it was mightily respectable and well-written, but a bit bland for my tastes.\n\nNow, I've finally buckled down and gave it a half-dozen pretty intense listens, and I've learned that there is a pretty good reason for its acclaim: It's a pretty damn good album! The most important thing about it is it has melodies. They're not the sorts of instantly catchy melodies of an ABBA variety; they're more understated. They have the priceless quality of being melodies that weave their ways into your heart if you give them the proper chance. ...That said, some of these melodies are stronger than others, but even the least notable ones are well-written.\n\nThe instrumentation is brilliantly done throughout this album as well. These guys favor a low-tech, somewhat unkempt approach. Usually, you won't find anything more complicated than an acoustic guitar, a pure electric guitar, a simple bass, or a piano in these songs. Occasionally, you'll find woodwinds, electric organs, and string sections, but these also have a distinctly organic flavor to them. My favorite moments of the album are principally the ones where the orchestration gradually builds up through the course of the song. ï¿½The Stars of Track and Field,ï¿½ for instance, begins with lead singer Stuart Murdoch singing an engaging melody to a folky acoustic guitar. It's interesting by itself, but the song seems to get even better when that bass guitar comes in, and then that jangly electric guitar. It all sounds quite delicate, but that build-up makes the song one of the more engaging ones I've ever heard. If that song is the only reason music magazines put this toward the top of their '90s lists, then I'm with them 100 percent.\n\nLead singer Stuart Murdoch is a capable vocalist, for sure. That might be an understatement, but how can you blame me? He's an understated singer! I like that quality about him. He comes off as somewhat lackluster at times, but that's an integral part of this band's sound. Every time I think of Belle and Sebastian, I think of Murdoch wearing ordinary street clothes, singing about things that happen to be important to him at the time. And just because I said he sometimes sounds lackluster, it doesn't mean he's emotionless. His folksy vocal performance in ï¿½The Boy Who Done Wrong Again,ï¿½ for instance, leaves me with a tear in my eye. That's a bittersweet masterpiece right there. (I prefer Murdoch wildly over Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum who seemed to think screaming his ass off is equal to emotion.)\n\nSo, I've given If You're Feeling Sinister a pretty damn glowing review so far! But I do have one pretty major hang-up about it. It goes back to the initial reaction I had to the album that I mentioned at the beginning of the review: it's all a little bit samey to me. While I adore the way the homemade-flavor way they orchestrate these songs, there's not much they do to make them sound extremely different from each other. This isn't a deal-breaker, of course, but I continue to think they could have improved it. Compare this to Paul McCartney's Ram and see how many different wild flavors and ideas he somehow seemed to cram in there. Nothing on that album sounded alike, and yet nothing betrayed the homemade flavor that he was going after.\n\nI also think some of these songs are better than others. The title track begins with a rather extended recording of kids playing in a playground, and that moment just seems dead to me. The rest of the song, while nice and sunshiney, also seems like it could have developed a bit faster. It also seems like they could have done more to develop ï¿½Like Dylan in the Movies,ï¿½ since it doesn't seem to have as surprises in it as the other songs. ...But I'm really nitpicking there, since that's a very enjoyable song anyway!\n\nAll in all, If You're Feeling Sinister is an excellent album with more than its fair share of brilliant moments. I recommend this album highly with the stipulation that you might have to work pretty hard to get into it at first. I was on the border between a 12 and a 13 on this one. I opted for a weak 13 specifically because ï¿½The Boy Done Wrong Againï¿½ leaves me with a tear in my eye, and I figure any song that makes me feel like that deserves extra credit. ...Also, I love extra credit. If only my college professors felt the same way......\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nIf You're Feeling Sinister\n\nLaura Branigan: Laura Branigan (1982)\n\nAlbum Score: 6\n\nLaura Branigan died in 2004 very unfortunately of a brain aneurysm at 47. I felt horrible about it even though I never really liked her music. I mean, I like the song \"Gloria,\" but Branigan had nothing to do with it other than sing it with boring studio musicians.\n\n\"Gloria\" was a reworking of a big hit in Italy, which sounded like an Alan Parsons Project track sung in Italian. Naturally, it took an English speaking singer to turn it into an international hit! Well, it's a keeper, certainly, although the instrumentation is boring and strictly by-the-book. That put quite a damper on the melodies throughout the effort, which weren't too bad.\n\nThe opening ballad \"All Night With Me\" is the album's second best track though it doesn't come close to matching Gloria's glory. The melody is rather catchy and the instrumentation doesn't spoil anything. That's more than I can say for the other tracks, which are so bland that it hurts. It hurts me because each song had good melodic elements that had the potential to be decently average songs, but the producer/arranger had no vision and didn't do anything justice! This is one flat album!!! The fact that there's only one real embarrassment in here, the appropriately titled \"Down Like a Rock,\" makes that even more tragic!\n\nBranigan had a capable voice, but it wasn't anything special. She could hit all the right notes, but the voice had no personality. Hey, she did look good in those sweet leather pants!! I do wish her debut album was more creative, but this is corporate-rock after all. You can't expect art from non-artists! That doesn't mean you have to like it. Thumbs down, baby! Now, rest in peace!\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nLaura Branigan\n\nBuilt to Spill: Perfect From Now On (1997)\n\nAlbum Score: 11\n\nBuilt to Spill specialized in lengthy jam-type rock songs. While they weren't as versatile with their guitars as bands like Phish, they also didn't try to bite off more than they could chew. You won't find much in here in terms of amazing guitar acrobatics, but they could still create some nice, interesting textures with their guitars. That skill comes in handy since many of these songs are extremely long! They range from five minutes to nine minutes! A few of them, such as ï¿½Stop the Show,ï¿½ are a little more progressive-rock-ish, but the majority tend to stick with repeating a handful of chords.\n\nIndeed, their ability to interweave different textures throughout these songs are these guys' main strength, although if you listen to this album I think you'll understand that they are novices compared to bands like Can. The opening song ï¿½Randy Described Eternityï¿½ would have been boring if they continued to remain in that calm lull that it started off with. Instead, around the 45-second mark, they decided to up the ante and make it more driving and menacing. That was a very nice touch that grabbed my attention! That said, the song still would have fared better if they would have been more succinct with it. That 45-second intro could have been 20 seconds. Furthermore, why didn't they get even *more* violent and menacing later on in the song? The initial *shock* was done nicely, but why stop at that? Hm. Well, at least they close the track with a fun rubbery guitar jam. Good times, good times!\n\nï¿½I Would Hurt a Flyï¿½ has similar nicely done textural and tempo changes. At the beginning, its overall pacing might too slow for its own good, but they very subtly work in more violent passages into it. The end is more of a traditional rock jam in the spirit of Cream, and it ain't a bad one either. The star of this show, again, is that rubbery guitar, which plays throughout the track; whoever is playing it is apparently pretending to be in a '60s psychedelic band, and he's probably having a lot of fun, too!\n\nWhile most of these songs keep my attention pretty well, there's not a single track that wouldn't have benefited significantly with editing. Even the five-minute ï¿½Made-Up Dreams,ï¿½ while a nice composition, would have been more tight and effective if it was cut by a good minute. But things don't get truly excessive until we reach the second half of the album. The eight-and-a-half minute ï¿½Velvet Waltzï¿½ is more long-winded than most of my high school teachers (and believe me those guys could talk up a storm). I usually don't like sitting through such long songs that basically repeat the same chord progression over and over again, but they continue to do such a nice job shifting the textures around that I'm able to contently sit through it. That's a triumph in itself as far as I'm concerned.\n\nIn fact, I'm never truly bored in this album until the nine-minute ï¿½Untrustable / Part 2 (About Somebody Else)ï¿½ pops up. I like listening to the first five minutes of the song just fineï¿½I especially like that ringing guitar tone they useï¿½but the last three minutes is a weird, disconnected and awkward groove that's difficult to listen to. I suppose they were 'experimenting' there, but that proves these guys were far better off sticking to the normal stuff.\n\nSince I mentioned earlier that ï¿½Stop the Showï¿½ was progressive-rock-ish, I bet you could automatically guess that's my favorite song on here. It is, indeed! However, the development isn't the major thing I'm impressed with (in fact, I feel that song is too bloated like the others ... for example, I don't see why that ultra-calm two minute acoustic introduction needed to be any longer than 30 seconds). I like the melody! It's so bouncy, bright and hooky that it's comparable to a Ween melody. (Although it doesn't quite *glisten* like theirs does.) That's a fun song!\n\nWhile I might not be an overwhelming fan of this albumï¿½it needs a good liposuctionï¿½I think it's mightily respectable with a fair number of nice melodies and well-developed textures. If they were going to truly impress me, however, they would have had to go work a lot harder, developing even more intricate textures and more shocking mood changes. That masterful live album I reviewed recently, Royal Albert Hall October 10 1997, is a great example of how far it's possible to take these sorts of lengthy compositions. At the very least, Perfect From Now On is easy to listen toï¿½at least there aren't any disgusting, aimless fuzzy guitar sounds like on some albums that I can think of! This might just be worth your time if you're into indie-rock.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nBuilt to Spill\n\nCaravan: Better By Far (1977)\n\nAlbum Score: 11\n\nLet me get this out of the way right now: I sympathize with the droves of classic Caravan fans when they express their disappointment towards this 1977 release. I mean, these guys were one of the premiere prog groups of the early '70s and it can be positively disconcerting to hear them write so many songs that sounds like they were trying to wedge themselves in between The Carpenters and Roberta Flack on the AM radio station. But on the other hand, this album is also far better than that one-star review on allmusic.com would have you believe.\n\n...Me? I'm lukewarm about it. I'm so lukewarm towards it that it was even slated to receive the most lukewarm rating of them all, a 10. But then they had to go and throw in an unexpectedly beautiful song at the very end, ï¿½Nightmare,ï¿½ that I'd wager is nearly as captivating as the best of their classic material. ...So unexpected is that ending that I wouldn't be surprised if there were a fair amount of Caravan followers in 1977 who couldn't even stomach it enough to flip the album over and listen to the second side much less make it all the way to the final song. If you didn't pawn off your vinyl collection yet, take a listen to it!\n\nAnd, I feel as though I've got to mention the significance of the year 1977 for progressive rock bands, which of course was the year punk-rock murdered them all. They didn't leave many survivors in their wake. Prog-bands that year had to either keep doing the same old thing and come off as dinosaurs... or try to reinvent the same old things to keep up with second generation prog-bands like Styx and Kansas... or turn to POP music and sink even further into obscurity because nobody cares about prog-bands who write pop music. Listening to the opening song of this album, which reminds me of one of the non-hits off an early ABBA album, it's as clear as a clear blue sky which direction Caravan decided to go.\n\nNaturally, the bad thing about writing songs that remind me of non-hits off of early ABBA albums is that those are the sorts of songs I will only sit politely through while I wait for the hits to pop up. But this album doesn't really have any hits. The closest thing they get to that is ï¿½Behind You,ï¿½ which is a nicely written and fitfully hooky song that I overall enjoy the experience of listening, but it also can't quite seem to wedge itself in my brain. I also like hearing their ballad, the title track, which might have disastrously cliched lyrics, but it has a tune that I'd describe as pretty nice. And a tune that's pretty nice is pretty good.\n\nThe opening number, ï¿½Feelin' Alrightï¿½ has one of the more memorable melodies on the album, but that caffeinated drumming is sloppy. The mid-tempoï¿½Silver Stringsï¿½ is also sloppy, although there are a few interesting moments in it involving crunchy violins. The album's penultimate track, ï¿½Let it Shine,ï¿½ sounds like it belongs on a Sweet album... And speaking as a person who has listened to a few Sweet albums and thought they were pretty fun, I've also fitfully enjoyed the experience of it. I also like that ï¿½Give Me Moreï¿½ uses a 3/4 time signature; that's a cute ditty, above all else.\n\nBut as I mentioned before, you'd might as well throw everything before it into the garbage after you here the morose, atmospheric, and thunderous closer, ï¿½Nightmares.ï¿½ It's a shame they buried it way down there, because it's easily the gem of the album. The lead vocals are sweet, it has a surprisingly captivating violin solo, and it all ends with one of the more blistering electric guitar solos I've heard in awhile. You'd probably wonder what a song like this is doing in an album filled with pop numbers, but there it is. Listen to it! ...Less significantly, there's a sort of jazz-fusion number called (*groan*) ï¿½The Last Unicorn.ï¿½ Their instrumentals are formidable there, but it's way too easy for me to sit through that and zone myself out.\n\nThere's no way on God's green earth that I'd claim that Caravan's Better By Far is some sort of lost classic. But at the same time, it doesn't deserve to be cast and forgotten in the dungeons of rock 'n' roll like it apparently has been. If you're in the business of collecting Caravan records, then I think you'll probably want this in your collection. They might have gone AM radio pop for a lot of it, but I would think even their most stringent fans will find something to love out of the closing number. And maybeï¿½just maybeï¿½they'd even find themselves enjoying some of those pop numbers as well. (But they might have to be alone in a dark room before they'd ever admit that to themselves!)\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nBetter By Far\n\nChicago: Chicago Transit Authority (1969)\n\nAlbum Score: 12\n\nBefore Chicago sucked, they didn't suck. Right now, I'm not too sure at what point in their career they started to suck. But I do know that Chicago was a sucky band, at the latest, by the 1980s. In 1969, Chicago didn't suck. OK, that's sorted out. (Oh, and they were officially called \"Chicago Transit Authority,\" but I'm going to refer to them as \"Chicago\" here on out.)\n\nI took a music appreciation course a long time ago, and for some reason the professor singled out Chicago as one of the great rock bands of all time. He admitted that he didn't know much about rock music (obviously). But apparently a friend of his dragged him to a Chicago concert before they were famous in '60s, and they left quite an impression on him. He was also a trumpet player. That probably explains it.\n\nAnyway, let's not talk about some professor whose name I can't even remember. Let's talk about this wonderful album. It's HUGE. You see that there's only 12 tracks in this album, but know that this thing is 1.3 hours long. It was unusual for a rock band to be allowed to cut a double album as their debut, but here is this monstrosity. The story seems to be that they were originally going to make a normal, full-length album, but they recorded too much material for it. So, they decided to go ahead and record more material to make it a double. Honestly, this album probably would have been better if they would have just stuck with the full-length. When you see tracks like the utterly useless guitar solo \"Free Form Guitar\" and the rather excessive 15-minute rock jam \"Liberation\" tacked on at the end, you're going to think that brevity might have been the better option for them.\n\nAt the same time, the epic quality of these tracks, in general, is one of the album's main benefits, so how can you rightly want to cut it all down to 40-50 minutes? Nah, keep the lengthy tracks. Just know that this is also one of the album's primary pitfalls. This will inevitably become a chore to sit through except among the most patient of people.\n\nNow let's talk about this album's greatness. These songs are wonderful! Their trademark horn sound works beautifully throughout this. That brought some unique sound to these already wonderful songs. My favorite work on here is clearly \"Questions 67 & 68,\" which is also their most poppy track. That's the best of both worlds, in my opinion --- great melody and instrumentation.\n\nThis is a remarkably solid album, despite its excessive length. The instrumentation, all around, is remarkable. I'd wager to say this is among the best of all rock 'n' roll... It was quite a product, and it manages to stick out in its year of release, 1969, which seems to be the year when rock hit its peak. That's weird to think of about Chicago if you only know them for their '80s work, but it's all true. (Likewise, you'd probably be surprised that the Bee Gees also created an interesting, near masterpiece in 1969 called Odessa.) Well, such was the magic of 1969, I guess. All of that said, it's not difficult to imagine these guys were capable of making a perfect album, but they decided to stuff this up with filler instead. Well, apart from \"Free Form Guitar,\" at least it's glorious filler.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nChicago Transit Authority\n\nDJ Screw: 3 'N the Mornin' Part 2 (1996)\n\nAlbum Score: 10\n\nDJ Screw tells me in the opening song of this album, ï¿½Watch Yo Screw,ï¿½ that people are always stealing screws, which is why you've got to ï¿½watch yo screw.ï¿½ ...Incidentally, I just did a homework assignment where I had to calculate the load capacity of lag screws, and with that in mind, I have one important question to ask him: How is anybody going to take the screws out? I mean, if they're load bearing, you've got to be some kind of Superman to even budge those things... Of course he could be talking about screws that are just sitting in a box, but ï¿½ what do those things cost, two cents? Personally, I'd spend my efforts watching my jar of pennies...\n\n...Oh by the way, I should give you a little extra disclaimer: I'm a nerd who never listens to rap music. (Emphasis on the never and double-emphasis on the nerd.) If you want to read a review of this rap album from someone who actually knows what he or she is talking about, then look somewhere else. This is literally the second rap album I've ever reviewed, so when I say I have no idea what I'm talking about, I mean it. With that said, speaking as someone who isn't very much into rap music, I really enjoyed listening to the song ï¿½Smokin' and Leanin'.ï¿½ Holy crap, that is one freaky show.\n\nI never heard of this before, but DJ Screw specialized in making what Wikipedia calls ï¿½Screw tapesï¿½ where he takes rap songs done by different artists and screws with them. This almost always involves slowing down the speed, which makes the rappers' voices sound a bit like mutated slugs. Why that worked on ï¿½Smokin' and Leanin'ï¿½ so much is that he also, I presume, added some wobbly electronic instrumentation on top of them. With the comically low-pitched rapping and the wobbliness, it sounds like it's under water. It's such a peculiar idea, and it's really a lot of fun there.\n\nUnfortunately, where the album loses its spark for me is the rest of these songs. I mean, they all just sound like ordinary rap songs with the speed slowed down. Some of the rap songs seem like they were quite good when they were played at their usual speed; ï¿½High With the Blankstaï¿½ is based on a very sophisticated descending chord progression that captivates me. ...In that song, also, the slowed-down speed lets me soak up its somewhat involved synthesizer texture, which I might not have noticed so much in its normal speed. Similarly, I like ï¿½Servin the Duceï¿½ mostly for its very well-programmed drum beat... I don't think it's too often I like a song specifically for a programmed drum beat...\n\nProbably the biggest reason I'm out of my element reviewing this album is that I'm completely unfamiliar with the artists he takes these songs from. Have you ever heard of these guys? ESG, Al-D, Mack 10, 20 2-Life, Botany Boyz... (That last ones sounds like a bunch of nerds... If I ever started a rap group, I would so want to name it Botany Boyz...) They're all from Houston. Southeast Houston to be exact. I guess many of them cooperated with him specifically for this album, and all of them were members of what is known in the region as the Screwed Up Click. (Not Clique? ï¿½ Click?)\n\nAs is the nature with slowed-down rap music, I guess, you'd be lucky if you can understand the lyrics at all, since they all sound like Jabba the Hut. When I do understand the lyrics, I almost wish I didn't, because they're so profanity laden that it annoys the crap out of me. And when they're not making swears, they're being annoying otherwise. For example, in the closing two songs, ï¿½Pimp Tha Penï¿½ and ï¿½South Side,ï¿½ I keep on hearing the phrase ï¿½You know what I'm saying?ï¿½ repeated over and over... I mean, I think I know what he's saying, but after having that questioned so much, maybe I don't actually know anything, and my entire life is really a dream?\n\nThis is an unusual album, and I was on the fence between a 10 and an 11. Certainly the uniqueness and enjoyability of ï¿½Smokin' and Leanin'ï¿½ would prompt me to go with the higher rating, but really I'm not too wild about the other songs. I get tired of its ï¿½gimmickï¿½ midway though. In many cases, I would have rather just heard the songs played at their normal speed, since many of them seemed perfectly decent ...But as I said in the second paragraph in this review, I feel verrrrry out of my element reviewing this, so feel free to take whatever I say about this with a grain of salt. I know I am! ...Seriously, I don't personally subscribe to anything I just wrote in this review.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\n3 'N the Mornin' Part 2\n\nDream Theater: Images and Words (1992)\n\nAlbum Score: 10\n\nDream Theater never seem to be as good as their fans say they are, but they also never seem to be as terrible as everyone else says they are. So I guess that goes to show that you'll have to listen to these albums to decide which camp you fall into. Because I love you, I'm going to ask you a question to make it easier for you to determine which sort of person you are. ...Do you enjoy a good tune? If not, then you might be a Dream Theater fan.\n\nI've gotten enough people over the years sending me notes saying things along the lines of ï¿½There is more to music than melodies, you blockhead!ï¿½ (There's the Rated G version of what they tell me, anyway.) Yup, those are Dream Theater fans. ...Or Rush fans, more likely, because I've had many-a-naughty thing to say about Rush in my time so far on the Internet. If there's one thing clear, Dream Theater were very, very diehard Rush fans. You might get an inkling of that impression by reading the title to one of their songs, ï¿½Metropolis-Part 1: The Miracle & The Sleeper.ï¿½ You'll get that impression even more if you actually listen to it. It's a sprawling epic with plenty of busy guitar, even busier drumming, and so many changing textures that it makes my head spin. (So much for my neck.) With no second thought of the matter, that's not a song for people with a weak stomach. Keep your arms and legs inside the moving vehicle at all times.\n\nI know this is going to unleash an endless hell-fury on my e-mail account, but I really don't think Mike Portnoy is a very good drummer. I don't say that to trash the guy necessarily, because he doesn't deserve a trashing; he's got to be one of the most technically proficient drummers out there. All those tight, rapid-fire fills he does makes me go positively featherbrained. Butï¿½as some wise drummer somewhere must have said at one point or anotherï¿½a drummer has got to know how to effectively use silence. When I'm listening to Dream Theater, it sounds as though I'm stuck in the trenches of World War I bombarded with heavy machine gun fire. These guys also have a keyboardist, although I wouldn't know he was there most of the time. He usually seems pretty happy playing one-fingered, three-note arpeggios or blank chords on a Casio keyboard in the background. He doesn't take many chances.\n\nBut there's one exception to that: the keyboard texture at the beginning of ï¿½Wait for Sleep,ï¿½ which sounds a lot like the beginning of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. And no! It's not a rip-off; it's a homage!! (Seriously, the dude comes up with one interesting keyboard pattern, and all everyone can think of is Tubular Bells? He found a good pattern, so let the dude play!) And speaking of that song, considering most Dream Theater fans don't think melodies are that important, Dream Theater could, at long last, come up with a pretty decent melody. Listen to ï¿½Wait for Sleepï¿½ if you want proof. The album has two other ballads, ï¿½Another Dayï¿½ and ï¿½Surrounded,ï¿½ and they sound like they're right out of a mid-'80s pop-metal album. That's a shame because this was released in 1992.\n\nI do like, quite a lot, their operatic lead singer James LaBrie. He has the ability to soar over these songs and present a somewhat coherent melody despite what utter nonsense the guitarists and drummer were trying to pull off in whatever random time signature they felt like working in. ...I know that everybody who likes Dream Theater say they were one of the most creative bands of all time, and I suppose if working in goofy time signatures makes you creative, then it must be true. ...But my appreciation of that creativity is occasionally thwarted by their guitars and drums, which occasionally veer off into a texture that I find uncomfortable to listen to. It also sounds, creatively, a lot like Kenny G is playing the saxophone on ï¿½Another Day.ï¿½ (You can breath a sigh of relief, because it's not. It's a fellow named Jay Beckenstein. Or, to close friends, he is known as Beckenstein J.)\n\nBut anyway, this is hardly the worst album on the history of the planet. I like it better than that Dream Theater album I've listened to that a lot of people have dubbed their masterpiece, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. I even took a listen to this album at work even though I had gotten fair warnings that it might have made me want to smash things. For the sake of me not getting fired, I'm glad that it didn't! Instead, I found this to be a mightily OK listen. Surely, it would have been better if the drummer didn't feel the need to constantly bombard my eardrums with all sorts of rattly noise. It also would have been nice if the lead guitarist knew something of subtlety. But other than that these songs flowed pretty well. So there it is: I don't hate Dream Theater. I'm going to lose my ability to hear one of these days, and life is too short to sit around and sneer at things anyway. (But of course I still let myself write snarky comments. Where would I be in life without letting myself write snarky comments?)\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nImages and Words\n\nEngland: Garden Shed (1977)\n\nAlbum Score: 11\n\nEngland is one of those forgotten prog-bands from the '70s that I could have easily lived the rest of my life without ever knowing about. The fact that I would have found that to be a minor tragedy is evident that I am an incurable egghead. So, I have to extend my gratitude to Ken, who requested that I do this review. And now I can spread the message of England on this here website of mine. Granted, not very many people visit this website, but if one egghead listens to Garden Shed as a result of reading this review and likes it, then I feel I have done my patriotic duty. Not patriotic to any country, but patriotic to prog... um... Perhaps I should get on with it...\n\nThe reason that Garden Shed is largely forgotten is completely understandable. It was released in 1977, which is very late for a prog album, especially one that so faithfully recreates the classic sound of Genesis and Yes. Not only had the music scene shifted radically that year, but prog bands were different, too. Most notably, Garden Shed is filled to the brim with the Mellotron and Hammond organ sound. This would've sounded out-of-touch even for 1971! Let the lesson be learned, obscurity is what you get for sounding behind-the-times!\n\nBut we've entered the 21st Century, you see, so none of this matters. No one considers 1977 to be anymore out-of-date than 1969, and so people are free to appreciate Garden Shed in its full glory. The one thing that's unique about Garden Shed is that thing that was so out-of-touch: The raw Mellotron and Hammond organ are awesome things to behold, sometimes. If you agree with that statement, then you're an egghead, and you owe it to yourself to listen to Garden Shed at some point before death. (In fact, if you visit their Website, http://www.gardenshedmusic.com/, you'll read all about how much they love their classic keyboards.)\n\nOne thing I'd say England did better than Yes, probably the only thing, was harmonies. Well, maybe not *better* but often crazier. There's some pretty wild chord progressions in here, particularly in ï¿½Three Piece Suite.ï¿½ At first listen, I thought their chords would get so weird that I thought they were awkward. But after the third or fourth listen, I got more and more used to them and began to love them. The final third of ï¿½Three Piece Suiteï¿½ also features what's perhaps the album's most memorable bit: A catchy pop-rocker featuring a lead singer with the most outrageous, falsetto vocals imaginable. The melody would have sold me on it anyway, but the Tiny-Tim-like vocals put it over the top. There are also two other brief sections that feature cartoony voices, but they more of an ensemble of Muppet characters. The middle of ï¿½Midnight Madnessï¿½ and a smaller but more outrageous bit in ï¿½Paraffinalea.ï¿½ Both times, it's hilarious.\n\nï¿½Paraffinaleaï¿½ sounds like a kiddie's song anyway thanks to the silly fantasy lyrics and an especially cute vocal melody. It's also a solid composition, bringing in energetic Mellotron diversions in between verses. That's also one of the album's shorter songs, clocking in at four minutes. ï¿½Midnight Madnessï¿½ is seven minutes and thus a more traditional prog outing. One distinctive thing about that song, in particular, is its opening sequence. It's a synthesizer-only intro, only using the purest kinds of synthesizers. It's quite simple but mesmerizing! And then, the Mellotrons start to fade in, which recalls early Genesis in particular. Anyway, that's a great intro. Naturally, the song itself is in a weird time signature, but the vocal melody is catchy! Things start to get shaky in the final third when they start doing all these elaborate crescendos and the album's bugetary restrictions becomes completely apparent. The cymbals are too loud, and that Hammond organ seems to come in at the wrong times... But, really, that's not such a big deal.\n\nEasily the weakest parts of Garden Shed are when they're being neither cartoony nor pretentious. (That's a weird thing for me to say...) ï¿½All Aloneï¿½ is a truly boring piano ballad with a forgettable melody, but it's only two minutes long so it's nothing to dwell over. ï¿½Yellowï¿½ is a more extended song using mostly acoustic guitars and pure Mellotrons. The sound of it is undoubtedly nice, as it's good to sit back and soak up. But the melody is boring, and I miss some of that unbridled creativity present in the other songs. ï¿½Poisoned Youthï¿½ is a pretentious prog-track, but it's a bit of a let-down. It's rather sluggish and slow-moving, and without all those weird touches that made ï¿½Midnight Madnessï¿½ and ï¿½Three Piece Suiteï¿½ such a treat. It's competently written and more ï¿½serious,ï¿½ but it's 16 minutes long and I yawn through much of it. Hm.\n\nThus, Garden Shed is hardly in the same league as Selling England By the Pound or Fragile or, really, any big-time progressive rock classic, but that should come to no surprise. There's really not even a single track in here that could even be considered a masterpiece. The highest rating I could bear to award any of these tracks was an A-. They all had their ups and downs. On the other hand, three of these tracks deserved that A-, and so I really enjoyed listening to this.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nGarden Shed\n\nMelissa Etheridge: Melissa Etheridge (1988)\n\nAlbum Score: 5\n\nEverybody loves Melissa Etheridge. She's one of our most beloved contemporary singer-songwriters. She's also one of the predominent Hollywood forces in left-wing politics. (OK, so I guess Republicans don't love Melissa Etheridge, but they're worse because they like Toby Keith.) She has an extremely powerful voice that's especially suited for her brand of loud and \"expressionate\" alternative-rock. She sings with as much verve and passion as the bowel movement she's trying to achieve on the album cover.\n\nDespite all that, Melissa Etheridge is soooooo boring. Give her credit for that wailing voice of hers, but she doesn't put it to good use. At least in this debut, her songwriting and creative talents are completely worthless. I sit through this album and wait for her to do something interesting, but I'm afraid my efforts were in vein. What a freaking frustrating album! There's nothing in here that can even constitute a highlight. It's all either mediocre or bad.\n\nThis is particularly bad news since I can't think of too many albums that are mildly respectable that can get a score less than a 6.0. I mean, there's Kiss' and Michael Bolton, but they suck on purpose. Etheridge seems to genuinely want to be a singer-songwriter, but she has zero ideas.\n\nI like a few of the songs that she would do in the '90s, but she honestly comes off as one of those singer-songwriters who's more interested in making money and being a public lesbian than actually being a musician. Etheridge and her record company would venemously disagree with that of course, and then they'll go cash in the latest royalty check and make plans for remodelling that $5 million mansion.\n\nIt's true that Etheridge has her legion of fans, and I fully expect to get spirited e-mails from a few of them. Etheridge likes her fans, too, because they pay ungodly amounts of money to go to her concerts! (Not that I was actually looking into going to a Melissa Etheridge concert. I can sleep at home!! I looked up the ticket prices, though, and I've never made that much in a week!)\n\nAnyway, there's absolutely nothing in this album. Who knows why this went multi-platinum. I guess people also buy Twinkies. You'd think she'd at least be able to come up with one memorable hit here, but I guess that would mean actually making an effort!\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nMelissa Etheridge\n\nThe Flaming Lips: Clouds Taste Metallic (1995)\n\nAlbum Score: 13\n\nSo, you think clouds taste metallic? Pardon me if I'm wrong, but I think you were tasting the inside of the airplane... You can't really have a good idea about what clouds taste like if you're sitting in coach... There's always the stereotypes, but I seriously thought people from Oklahoma were smarter than that.\n\nActually, they got that title from something a Tool member told them. It's generally a bad idea to discuss anything with a member of Tool, because their suckiness is apt to rub off on you... But apparently Flaming Lips had a suckiness deflector shield, because Clouds Taste Metallic is such an awesome album that it defies all of my earlier or later proclamations that cluttery noise-rock can never be enjoyable. This album is noisy and it's so much fun that I'm going to get up from this chair right now and do a little dance in the middle of the room. .......... Um, you're going to have to trust me that I actually did one. I felt stupid, but I did do it. I closed my blinds.\n\nAnyway, what's so great about Clouds Taste Metallic isn't exclusively its fancy arrangements or lead singer Wayne Coyne's smooth Sinatra-like vocals... It's the actual songwriting. That's right, these guys don't just goof around with ugly distortion and mind-numbing soundscapes... They have real melodic talent, and they know how to use it! Especially the first half of this album is loaded with plenty of scrumptious tunes. Naturally, The Flaming Lips are more well-known for their ear for arrangements, which of course they do superbly throughout this disc.\n\nAt the moment, I'm a lot more familiar with their more mature and sophisticated 1999 album The Soft Bulletin, and I'm sure there are others out there like me. So, I should mention that Clouds Taste Metallic was a different sort of Flaming Lips when they didn't use so much keyboards. It's a guitar-oriented album, as all of their previous albums had been. This is said to have been the end of an era for this band, because it was the last album with guitarist Ronald Jones who was apparently the main force behind the fuzz-guitar. But even if you don't like the guitar that much, don't let that stop you from giving this album a try. There might be lotsa guitar and lotsa distortion, but all of it is glorious.\n\nLet's start discussing some of the songs. Right off the bat, I'll mention that there's nothing particularly special about the opening number ï¿½The Abandoned Hospital Ship.ï¿½ It wallows in a sort of noodly lull and never truly gets memorable although the melody is fine. It isn't until the second track, ï¿½Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus With Needles,ï¿½ until things start to get truly fascinating. The pure, unbridled energy there is so easy to get caught up in, and that melody is so catchy that it's wonderful! All those little cracks and breaks in the speakers actually gives the whole thing an edgy sort of texture instead of sounding completely annoying like R.E.M.'s Monster or Neil Young's Weld.\n\nFor some reason, the only song of this album I knew really well before reviewing this album is ï¿½This Here Giraffe,ï¿½ and it's great of course. A nice thing about it, in particular, is that it begins boldly, but the instrumentation subtly gets weirder as it progresses. Somewhere in the middle, a weird flute noises surfaces, and other points you can distinctly hear a xylophone. I'm only scratching the surface; there's so much going on with the instrumentation that it would take quite a lot to actually sort it out. If The Flaming Lips didn't have the ear for arrangements, a song like that could have easily become cluttered, but instead all these factors amazingly work together.\n\nJust to prove that they're not entirely weird ï¿½Brainvilleï¿½ is relatively normal, beginning as an acoustic folk song before progressing into a more lighthearted chorus. ï¿½Evil Will Prevailï¿½ is probably even more normal and folky. Sometimes these sorts of songs can get boring, but the melody is fantastic, which is always the trumping factor. ï¿½Bad Daysï¿½ is an excellent closer that manages to have that ultra-distorted fuzz guitar that they were so fond of and combine it with some gorgeous ï¿½oohï¿½ vocals to create a surprisingly beautiful experience.\n\nIt's hard to pick a favorite song in the album, but ï¿½Placebo Headwoundï¿½ is as close as any. There are enough musical ideas in that four minutes for three songs at least. It starts out as a spaced-out folk-rocker, but at one point turns into a bouncier pop song. The melody is especially sweet and likable throughout, and that distorted guitar noodling around is somehow really cool. I'm also a particular fan of ï¿½Christmas at the Zoo,ï¿½ and that's not because the lyrics sort of remind me of Twelve Monkeys. No, that's possibly the catchiest melody of the whole disc, and the instrumentation is as compelling as anything else here. The fuzz guitar is used in a rhythmic fashion to great effect, and the subtle addition of tubular bells and jingle bells in the background gives it a nice Christmas flavor. But the lyrics have as much to do with Christmas as Twelve Monkeys. Well, Twelve Monkeys took place during Christmas, too...\n\nIn a nutshell, this album is a pure classic. I don't like it as much as The Soft Bulletin, but I like that album *a lot* and I also like this album *a lot*. As a matter of fact, I'll like anything *a lot* as long as the melodies are fresh and the arrangements are enticing. Not a great deal of bands have that ability, but The Flaming Lips obviously do. On that note, Tool still sucks.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nClouds Taste Metallic\n\nA Flock of Seagulls: A Flock of Seagulls (1982)\n\nAlbum Score: 9\n\nSo, this album has the hit single \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" on it. But is it actually notable for anything else? That's up to argument as anything, I suppose, but ... well, they don't consider A Flock of Seagulls a one-hit wonder for nothing! Unfortunately, this is just another example of a rock band with just one good hit in them and nothing else.\n\nThis hit made them household names (also, their haircuts), but I do feel sorry for everyone who rushed to the record store and bought their eponymous album hoping for even more hits. The other tracks that are worth noting really don't come close to measuring up. It's also most unfortunate that its greatest shortcomings lie in their melodies. Apart from the hit track, it's bland melody after bland melody! Yeesh!!!!\n\nNow is a good time to mention that I am a considerable fan of \"Standing in the Doorway.\" If they weren't trying to do an Oingo Boingo impression with that, then they sure fooled me! They completely nailed the creepy mood and the melody is even above average for this album. Unfortunately, the melody *is* pretty weak, which is ultimately why we'd never confuse this for something composed by Danny Elfman.\n\nMany of the other tracks work well in a similarly orchestral fashion. I do like the atmospheres (or 'synthscapes' as they're known) they develop here. Some of them are so weird that it's difficult for me to dismiss the song despite the melodic shortcomings. Some tracks are developed better than others, but this album is mostly an atmospheric success story. If that's all you care about (coupled with this album's general sci-fi lyrical themes), then this might be a recommended album for you. But, for the love of god, don't expect anything other than the hit track to linger in that mind of yours after the album finishes playing!\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nA Flock of Seagulls\n\nJohn Foxx: Metamatic (1980)\n\nAlbum Score: 12\n\nLet's talk about the massive elephant in the room about John Foxx and his debut album: His sound is virtually exact to Gary Numan's. I mean, I wasn't even five seconds into the first song when that thought popped into my brain. That song happens to be the minimalist synth-pop piece ï¿½Plazaï¿½ in which the melody is sung-spoken, the instrumentation is starkly plain, and the stylish lyrics are about things pertaining to modern life. But was John Foxx merely a follower? Or was he one of the main propellers of this style of music?\n\nIf you talk to Gary Numan, he'd tell you John Foxx was one of his inspirations as the lead singer of Ultravox. Ultravox, you say? Naturally, most people know that band as the outfit led by Midge Ure who had created such radio staples as ï¿½Viennaï¿½ and ï¿½Dancing With Tears in My Eyes.ï¿½ However, Foxx had been at the helm of that band in the late '70s when they gave disillusioned Roxy Music fans some much needed refuge. But with that said, Foxx's work with Ultravox didn't sound much like Metamatic at all.\n\nSo, really, the question of who came first is kind of fuzzy. However, it is documented that Foxx had been debuting some of this stuff while he was still on tour with Ultravox in the late '70s before The Pleasure Principle was even developed. In fact an ex-Ultravox member even ended up joining Numan to create that album. That's still not enough information to help me draw a conclusion, so I'll be left to assume that the two acts were developing the same sort of sound simultaneously. Besides, didn't they all get this idea from Kraftwerk, anyway? However, what was especially unfortunate for Foxx was not only that Numan released his landmark album months earlier, but the two have very similar singing voices. So it's probably no wonder so many music fans of the time thought Foxx as some sort of Numan copycat. But even if that were true, should we care too deeply about it? Artists ought to be able to sound like one another all they please; after all, this synth-pop stuff was cutting edge at the time. Let's give their music a chance to stand on its own two feet.\n\nWell, I like The Pleasure Principle a whole lot better than this. But if you like that album, too, be sure to give this one a whirl as well, because I'm positive you'll like it. My favorite moment of this album is probably ï¿½A New Kind of Man,ï¿½ a song with an involved drum machine rhythm while Foxx speak-sings the lyrics in a manner that only could have been stylish in the early '80s. What I like most about it, though, is that whoosy synthesizer I hear noodling around in the background, that twinkly synthesizer that's occasionally becomes part of that detached groove, and that loud and blaring synthesizer that comes in between stanzas.\n\nï¿½Underpassï¿½ is a pretty cool song that's characterized by more quirky synthesizer choices as well as a synthesizer groove that sounds like it belongs in an '80s movie soundtrack, like Beverly Hills Cop II. (You know, pretty much anyone who wrote a synthesizer soundtrack in the '80s owes these pioneers in the pop-music field everything, right?) ï¿½Touch and Goï¿½ is the closing song, and it's a fitful one. Interestingly Ultravox also recorded this song in their first album with Midge Ure as ï¿½Mr. X.ï¿½ For my money, this one's a lot better since it's faster paced and uses more pleasant-sounding, herky jerky synthesizers. (I don't know why, but Midge Ure mutters through Ultravox's version as if he accidentally traveled into the future and listened to some Pulp albums.) Another song I have to mention is ï¿½Metal Beat,ï¿½ which gives me a pretty goofy image in my mind about two robots doing a tango. I can't ever think ill of a song that prompts me to picture that.\n\nThere are six bonus tracks included here, which I'd say is a pretty great bonus! As a whole they're not as good as the songs in the actual album, and many of them are instrumentals. However, there is one pretty excellent pop song in there called ï¿½Miles Away,ï¿½ which the only thing in this collection that comes closest to actually *rocking*. Also, the instrumental ï¿½Mr. Noï¿½ is pretty fantastic, and one I wouldn't recommend missing. Generally, I prefer hearing Foxx sing with his songs, but in that case, I don't want anything to distract me from that HUGE SYNTHESIZER that comes at me like some sort of mountain.\n\nI gave this a 12, but it was a weak one. What Foxx did throughout this album, he did with style, and I like nearly everything. But what's holding me back from letting that 12 wave proudly in the wind is that I can't say there's really a single moment in here that makes me want to return to it. I like the overall experience of listening to this and I'll probably listen to it again, but I wish there was something about this that would make me go more googly eyed.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nMetamatic\n\nPhilip Glass: 1000 Airplanes on the Roof (1988)\n\nAlbum Score: 12\n\n1000 Airplanes on the Roof might be the best place to start with Philip Glass if you are a rock fan. The reason for that is it's a synthesizer-heavy release, and he hired Linda Ronstadt to sing the vocals. That said, this is definitely not a rock album, and Ronstadt only sings \"aaah\" as if her voice was a synthesizer instrument. This album is almost campy like a '50s B-grade sci-fi flick ... and it's something you can become obsessively engulfed in if you're the right sort of (weird) person.\n\nPhilip Glass is a definitely love-him-or-hate-him kind of guy. Me? I love him, and I'm going to score his albums as such. I recommended this album to rock fans interested in getting into Glass, but also note that this album isn't close to his masterpiece ... It's a fair place for a \"warm up\" though! It's also smack dab in the middle of his minimalism period and his cinematic period ... so you're sort of getting a sample of both of his worlds! However, rock fans who like David Bowie might rather check out Glass' takes on Low (1992) and Heroes (1996). Those are fabulous! Although those tend to have less to do with the sound of his early period.\n\nPhilip Glass known for \"popularizing\" the style of classical music called \"minimalism.\" His grand statement in the genre came in the late '70s with Einstein on the Beach. That album almost like listening to a motor engine running --- it's extremely repetitive (emphasis on the *extremely*) and utterly hypnotizing. You'll either be engrossed, or you'll go crazy. I suppose some critics of the style dislike it because composing in it might be considered lazy ... But if you dare listen to that previously mentioned work, you'll note that his textures are so complex and wild that it's far from lazy.\n\nFor reasons I'm assuming had to do with exhaustion, Glass started to write more accessible music using minimalism as a launching pad. 1000 Airplanes on the Roof is quite accessible. Appealing more to the nerd in me, this is a science fiction opera (though the alien, Linda Ronstadt, doesn't know any words apparently).\n\nIt sounds pretty wild and exotic to me, which is an accomplishment that you can consider amazing since there doesn't seem to be a whole lot to the songwriting. Although any wannabe composers trying to sit down and write something like this are going to quickly learn that making a successful minimal song is a lot harder than you think. Glass was interested in seeing what kind of textures he could create, and what sort of moods they would generate. I find the style of music interesting. Surely, it's a different type of music and one that many people aren't used to .... Skeptics might be put off by the idea of the genre, but they should at least give 1000 Airplanes a listen, because by all accounts it's minimalism-lite.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\n1000 Airplanes on the Roof\n\nPatty Griffin: Living With Ghosts (1996)\n\nAlbum Score: 11\n\nI know me a place on the Internet where the name Patty Griffin is treated like a four-letter word. But let's not talk about that. Let's talk about her. The first thing to mention is that Patty Griffin is a woman. The second thing to mention is that Patty Griffin is a singer-songwriter. The third thing to mention is that Patty Griffin only plays with an acoustic guitar and her singing voice.\n\nI now shall talk with normal sentences. (Sort of.) I read the history of this album on allmusic.com, and it only confirms my suspicions that the mid-90s were the age of the female singer-songwriter. (Sarah McLachlan! Tori Amos! Natalie Merchant! Shawn Colvin! ... That one shaved-head chick who had something or other against the pope!) According to that site, this album was recorded as a demo. But the record company liked it so much that they decided to just release it as-is. They said they liked the ï¿½raw talent.ï¿½ It was only by happy circumstance that they didn't also have to shell out money for things like session musicians and fancy recording equipment. ...EASY PAYOLA!!!!\n\nHere's the thing: The record company executives actually had a point: there is a lot of raw talent in this demo. Just because record company executives are usually big fat tubs of lard laced with urine who don't want to pay money for orchestration, it doesn't mean that they don't occasionally recognize a good thing when they hear it. I mean, it's as rare as going to the woods of Arkansas and spotting an ivory-billed woodpecker, but it's been rumored to happen. On occasion.\n\nThe biggest drawback, of course, of creating a strummy-acoustic-guitar-and-singing album is that all these songs will start to sound the same. Maybe there are acts out there who managed to bypass that trap, but I haven't run into any so far in my illustrious music reviewing career. It's not a major surprise, but it serves as a pretty fair warning to people who aren't particularly into this sort of folk music. ...Some might say that the main appeal to this album lies in the lyrics. But I don't find them to be anything special. I suppose something like ï¿½I can chew like a cannibal / I can yell like a cat / I've even had you believin' that I really, really like it like that / But there was never a moment, not a moment / ... / You ever got within a hundred million miles of my soul ï¿½ are interesting, but they don't particularly mean anything to me.\n\nGriffin has an excellent, engaging singing voice. Although, she has this rather off-putting tendency to start singing REALLY loudly in the middle of these songs. It's as though she knew what she was singing was rather dull, so she decided to start WAILING to keep us from nodding off. Well, it works! I also like the way she strums that acoustic guitar of hers. Sometimes it's gentle, other times it's violent. Really, she covers the entire range between gentle and violent. I suppose some of these songs *might* have been spiced up a little bit if they added things like bass guitars or violins. In fact, I'm sure of it. But the more we get to concentrate on her singing and acoustic guitar playing, the better. (And no, I'm not being sarcastic there! I promise!!! I shutter to think of the billion ways a slide guitar could have ruined these songs!)\n\nThe songwriting leaves something to be desired sometimes. That's probably my biggest complaint about this album. That's where orchestration would have made a difference, I think. She could have used other instruments to create atmospheres, harmonies, and textures to her great advantage. But nah. Most of these songs do make good listens, even if they're bare and samey. ï¿½Mad Missionï¿½ in particular has a soaring chorus. I'm also find myself enchanted with the country-western ballad ï¿½Time Will Do the Talking.ï¿½ ...Those are the only two songs I particularly care to highlight in this main review body.\n\nBut I like Patty Griffin. She's good. She's talented. She's thoughtful. She's intelligent. She's literate. Occasionally she comes out with a good melody. But I don't like her as much as The Griffin, the psychedelic-pop band from the '60s. I also don't like her as much as Gryphon, the prog-rock band from the '70s. But what can I say? I'm a dorky, dorky man. I will never be hip. I have ancestors from England, Norway, and Germany. I am going bald. I'm good at mathematics. I get on the Internet and write music reviews that dabble as much in my personal life as the music I'm allegedly writing about. I am pretty much hopeless. But Patty Griffin is cool. Everybody likes her. She's sold 169,000 copies of this album. I haven't even been to the toilet that many times.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nLiving With Ghosts\n\nGuided By Voices: Bee Thousand (1994)\n\nAlbum Score: 11\n\nWhen I tell you that Bee Thousand by Guided By Voice is something else, I mean that it's *something else*. This band has adopted a ï¿½cut and runï¿½ policy when it comes to songmanship, and I'll tell you that it takes a lot of getting used to. In fact, it takes so much getting used to that I never even got used to it. I gave it a shot, but it just wasn't happening. So, I'm sorry. Whenever they come up with a good riff or a melody (which is frequent), they let the idea die approximately three minutes before I want it to. This is one reason why I found listening to Bee Thousand frustrating. The other reason has to do with the second half, but I'll get to that later.\n\nI know this band is supposed to have artistic integrity, and they wanted to be original and everything, but this was obviously too much for me. I'm also aware that there's been a pretty heavy following surrounding this, so my views might stir up some controversy. I feel sort of guilty for not liking it, but I shouldn't. Why would I have a Website if I can't freely express my views? And now that I have a potentially controversial opinion, then it'll get all the more exciting. So. I don't see the big appeal of Bee Thousand. Call me an old geezer if you want, but it's better to develop your songs.\n\nThe thing is, there's some really fabulous stuff in here. I mean, there are more good melodies and riffs in here than you could shake a stick at. ï¿½Buzzards and Dreadful Crowsï¿½ has a really catchy vocal hook! The instrumentation is even good in that sloppy, uncouth way. Obviously, this band wanted to be the rock 'n' roll equivalents of a cool guy who doesn't shower in the morning, and they did that well. It's just a shame they seemed to lack confidence and had ADD. ï¿½Tractor Rape Chainï¿½ is barely more than three minutes long, which is epic in these parts, but that one also has a compelling melody. Compelling melodies are cool.\n\nMost of these songs can be described as ï¿½sloppy '90s fuzzy guitar rockersï¿½ or ï¿½acoustic and sloppy folky numbersï¿½ which means I don't have much to describe. But there are a few oddities mixed in here. ï¿½Hot Freaks,ï¿½ with a menacing '60s garage rock riff (that's oddly passively played) and an Iggy-Pop-like lead vocal, is a really memorable throwback to the old times. It's so good that I'm especially disappointed they didn't let it go past two minutes. ï¿½Echos Myronï¿½ is reminiscent of '60s sunshine-pop, and it's an excellent one thanks to their decidedly above average melody writing skills! It approaches the three-minute mark, so that's a proper length, but I've got to wonder how well it would have sounded if they got rid of those goofy, cheap guitars. (Man, I'm going to get a lot of flack for this review... I don't know much about this band, but I have a feeling that I'm deriding exactly what the fans are celebrating.)\n\nAll of my complaining aside, the album is pretty smooth sailing all throughout the first half of the album. Most of those songs were compelling enough to be awarded an A- or higher in the track reviews. You see, even if I'm upset about some of these running lengths and lazy instrumentation, a great melody will always save the day.\n\nThings get a lot worse in the last half where I start to get happier that the songs are short. I want them to end sooner! It's hardly abysmal down there, but the melodic ideas are generally less compelling and the instrumentation is even sloppier. There are a few moments where it seemed especially like they were scraping the bottom of the barrel, which gives me the idea that maybe they weren't as good at being McCartney-esque melody wasters like they wanted to be. ï¿½A Big Fan of the Pigpenï¿½ is barely even listenable. Geez, if singing obnoxiously out-of-tune whilst picking at an acoustic guitar is your idea of a good time, I'm obviously missing out on something. There's this incessant squeaky sound coming out of my speakers in ï¿½Demons Are Real.ï¿½ That was probably designed to drive me nuts! But anyway, those songs were at least crazy and I couldn't bear to completely hate them.\n\nOn the plus side, ï¿½Her Psychology Todayï¿½ is a really nutty riff rocker that I found to be fun, and ï¿½I Am a Scientistï¿½ is one of those songs that has a great melody and would have made a very nice five-minute song! The melody is so good that I don't even care a member of The Shaggs came in with an awkward guitar part! ...The Shaggs...... OK, maybe that's going too far.\n\nIn the end, I think Bee Thousand is a good album with a hearty handful of amazing melodies, but I find it to be too much of a frustrating listen for me to get enthusiastic about it. An 11 seems like a score I'm comfortable with. A 10 is way to low and a 12 would be way too high. However, feel free to raise it to a 12 if sloppy instrumentation appeals to you and you tend to get bored when songs go beyond two minutes. I'm going to go back to my ABBA albums now.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nBee Thousand\n\nHall & Oates: Private Eyes (1981)\n\nAlbum Score: 10\n\nSomeone on a message board was discussing the merits of Hall & Oates, and he recommended Private Eyes to me. Generally speaking, I'm pleasantly happy with this release although it's certainly not going to make a dent in my Top 100 albums list. I doubt it would even threaten my Top 250. Why? Well, because it's so freaking bland.\n\nThat's not to say that blandness can't be good. At least, for the love of furry woodland creatures, this isn't cheesy. They weren't pandering to the fads of 1981 --- there's no synth-pop, disco beats or grimey synthscapes. (There are, however, some disco grooves, but not to a bad effect.) This is your straight, ordinary pop album with a minimum amount of production.\n\nI do compliment the production although that does manage to contribute to the blandness that I've been complaining about. No matter how much I like complimenting their arrangements for what they didn't do (which is probably against some rhetoric law somewhere), that doesn't forgive the fact that the arrangements weren't exactly inspiring.\n\nDespite those thoughts, the arrangements aren't actually the significant contributor to this album's downfall. It's the melodies. Simply put, a great melody is what pop albums need. Sure, you can make a good song without a catchy melody, but that's the *one* thing that can guarantee a great pop song. Unfortunately, Hall & Oates fall considerably short. Much of their melodies are instantly forgettable. Some of them are fine and mildly catchy, but as I'm sitting here writing this, I have a tough time recalling any of them.\n\nNonetheless, this is a perfectly pleasant album, and I mildly recommend it to pop fans. If you can find it used for a cheap price, it's probably worth it depending on how much money you earn and if you already own the 4,000 more recommendable albums currently on this planet. It was a huge seller in the 1980s, and I think the consumers were given a perfectly nice product. Thanks to the limited production, it doesn't sound badly dated. So, there you have it. Now, drink up!\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nPrivate Eyes\n\nLobby Loyde: Obsecration (1976)\n\nAlbum Score: 12\n\nHard-rock meets prog-rock? ...Has such a thing even been attempted before? Frank Zappa, maybe? Oh, but I bet Frank Zappa never tried to make his guitar sound like a didgeridoo. That's what Lobby Loyde does in a song called ï¿½A Rumble With Seven Parts and Lap Dissolve,ï¿½ which is one of the most unusual heavy blues songs I've ever heard. It's based on a very usual blues riff, but they completely drench it with a sea of electric guitars. I wonder how many guitarists there were in the studio? Or was it just Loyde overdubbing himself a bunch of times? There's a saxophonist, too, and he plays a very juicy sax! He pops up in all these songs, thank goodness. Anyway, in the track reviews, I likened that song to sitting in the middle of a large crowd and listening to people's conversations... You can make out an individual's words if you want to, but you'd never be able to hear what everybody's saying. The whole song is kind of the musical equivalent of a dull murmur.\n\nThe opening song, ï¿½Obsecration,ï¿½ is more than 17 minutes long, and I never once get tired of it. Most of it is a pretty heavy rocking song with crunchy guitars playing very catchy riffs... There aren't very many vocal melodies in this album, but Loyde sings a fun, bluesy melody at the beginning of it and then more soaringly at the end. ...Naturally, being more than 17 minutes long, the music delves into very lengthy guitar passages, and they're all compelling. At one point, I even hear him play that controversial Phantom of the Opera riff. (Roger Waters must've not been in Australia when this was released. Otherwise Lobby Loyde would've gotten sued.)\n\nNot all of these songs are insanely long: ï¿½Rock And Roll Sunsetï¿½ is a two-minute-long Jerry Lee Lewis style piano rocker. It does pick up a lot of energy, and I sort of wish they fleshed it out to a full five minute song. For the 47-second album closer ï¿½Congratulateonies,ï¿½ they create a surprisingly dark riff that just comes in and fades out. ...I really don't understand what was preventing them from fleshing that one out, because it also might have been pretty cool five-minute song. There's also an eight-minute-long blues rocker called ï¿½Going to Louisiannaï¿½ (sic) that's a lot of fun to listen. It's far more normal than the other blues-rockers on this disc, which is a mild relief to me... at least it shows they could be normal if they wanted to be...\n\nThe second longest song here is the 14-minute ï¿½Dream Tide.ï¿½ It's mostly acoustic and seemingly meant to be more atmospheric than rockin'... It's quite a nice song to listen to while you're doing something else, such as browsing the web, but it doesn't demand my undivided attention like many of the other songs. ...Eh, you can probably call it ï¿½boringï¿½ if you want, but it does have its sweeping moments.\n\nThe closest thing this album has to a more or less straight prog exercise is the final song in the bonus tracks, ï¿½Fist of Is.ï¿½ Of course like everything else in the album, it's the guitars that take the center stage. The only keyboards I hear is a rumbly organ (which is present through most of these songs). ...But seriously, who ever heard of a prog tune in 1976 not to have any Mellotrons or synthesizers? Nevertheless, just like any respectable prog song should, it gradually shifts its tones and textures, and they always seem to come up with new musical themes that keep things interesting. Of course it's a far cry from matching the majesty of a classic Genesis song, but ï¿½ well, that's Genesis. For an obscure band from Australia, these guys are really good. It is highly respectable prog, to say the least.\n\nAnother song in the bonus tracks I have to mention is ï¿½Too Poor To Die,ï¿½ which kind of freaked me out when I wrote the track review early this morning. It starts out with a surprisingly catchy heavy metal riff before turning into a chaotic bit of hard-rock mayhem where there's a strange woman who is yelling and hissing through it, and Lobby Loyde is singing in a terrified, guttural manner. (If there was a voice like that hissing and yelling while I was trying to sing a hard-rock song, then I'd sing in a paranoid manner like that, too.) Also contributing to the mayhem is a saxophone screeching in the background, and the main lead guitars are heavily distorted... It's such an odd song. Did I like it? Of course I did!!\n\nAnyway, there's more to read in the bonus tracks if you want to. Most of these bonus tracks were taken from an EP, so it's basically an extra half-album that comes with the usual album for your purchase. ...Although this is a fairly expensive album to get, so it's not like it's for free or anything. But if you have the money and you want to hear what hard-rock combined with prog-rock might sound like, then your purchase will be well worth it.\n\nWhen I first put this album on, I thought it sounded a lot like that Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs album I reviewed some time ago called More Arse Than Class. In fact, Lobby Loyde had worked with Billy Thorpe in the past, so there is a connection after all. ...Unfortunately, both figures died in 2007, less than two months away from each other. Perhaps they were also spiritually connected? I guess early 2007 wasn't a good time for the Australian rock 'n' roll scene.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nObsecration\n\nBarry Manilow: Barry Manilow II (1974)\n\nAlbum Score: 8\n\nAt least I can say that this album starts out like it's going to take over China. \"I Want to Be Somebody's Baby\" is incredibly enjoyable and upbeat. It's has Manilow's '70s Vegas vibe and with a slightly strange, off-kilter feeling about it. It's quite an interesting song. He follows that up with a stellar song \"Early Morning Strangers,\" a conventional soft-rock number but enough interesting ideas strewn throughout to keep it interesting. And of course \"Mandy\" follows after that, which I'm sure everybody has heard. Even people who hate Barry Manilow seem to like that song ... although he didn't write that song.\n\nThe following three songs are entirely tolerable although it seems clear that it's dropped off considerably in quality. \"Two Of Us\" is a ballad that never takes off when it should --- but at least it's pretty. The following two tracks are enjoyable though they're not too striking in my opinion.\n\nAfter that, there's the strangely out-of-place \"Avenue C,\" which sounds like a '50s commercial jingle. This worked on his more pointedly diverse previous album, but here it seems to stick out like a sore thumb. Despite that, I actually enjoy the song --- but it ruins the general feel of the album that Manilow seemed to be shooting for.\n\nWell, at any rate, I'd take \"Avenue C\" on the boring ballads that follow it any day of the week. \"My Baby Loves Me,\" \"Sandra\" and \"Home Again\" consists of the Axis of Evil even though \"Home Again\" is slightly less eviler than the others. All three of them are hopelessly corny ballads without great melodies. They are what preventing me from having good, overall words to say about this release.\n\nIt's been correctly pointed out that this is where Manilow decides what direction he wanted to take his career. This is also much more focused on cheesy ballads and Vegas-oriented pop music than his previous album, Manilow I! Well, this album loses some of the needed diversity though the switch. Simply put, this album is pretty boring to sit through... apart from the three opening tracks, that is.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nBarry Manilow II\n\nOlder (1996)\n\nAlbum Score: 8\n\nThere is George Michael... lurking in the shadows of an empty closet... with nothing to do but impersonate David Blaine...\n\nThis was his first album he had released in six years. Why he waited so long to release one while he was still at the height of his popularity was explained by Wikipedia contributors as having something to do with legal problems with his record company. I didn't care enough about it to read further into the paragraph.\n\nThe Wikipedia writers also described the lead hit single off this album, ï¿½Jesus to a Child,ï¿½ as melancholic. I suppose they could have been using that term generically to describe its slow and downbeat tone, but when I describe a song as melancholic, it would have to give me a lump in my throat when I listen to it. ï¿½Tomorrow on the Runwayï¿½ by The Innocence Mission is a perfect example of that. All ï¿½Jesus to a Childï¿½ ever does to my throat is give it the predilection to yawn. ...And before you all accuse me of not knowing my facts, yes I did read far enough into that Wikipedia entry to learn that Michael was singing about some dead guy that he had been secretly in love with. I do sympathize with people who love other people who are dead now and want to sing about them. I'm not heartless.\n\nHe is an awfully whispery singer, which could be the reason that people have been giving him so many passion props. I also love the sound of his voice, which is cool, mellow and smoother than clay. Unfortunately, his tear-jerky lyrics ring like something I expect to find out of Hallmark cards or during the opening titles of a Lifetime Original Movie. (ï¿½Sadness in my eyes / No one guessed and no one tried / You smiled at me like Jesus to a child / Loveless and cold / With your last breath you saved my soul / You smiled at me like Jesus to a child / And what I have learned from all these tears / I've waited for you all these years / Then just when it began he took your love awayï¿½) For sure, I've heard much worse than this. But I want lyrics that incite thought and imagery. All these lyrics do is make me think of a postcard that a Mormon gave me once.\n\nWith that said, ï¿½Jesus to a Childï¿½ isn't a terrible song. The melody is decent. George Michael's vocal performance is lovely. ...I really don't know why he needed to keep playing it for seven minutes, particularly since nothing significant about it ever changes after its first minute. I also find the follow-up song, ï¿½Fastloveï¿½ to be fitfully entertaining. The melody and atmosphere doesn't do much for me, but it has a pleasant light-groove to it. If all else fails, give us something we can tap our foot to.\n\nThe problem with this album is pretty much everything past that point. After we've listened to the last notes of ï¿½Fastlove,ï¿½ we've pretty much exhausted all the fast songs this album has to offer. Nearly everything else is a whispery slow song, most of which are effectively indistinguishable from ï¿½Jesus to a Child.ï¿½ Boring! An important exception to this, and what happens to be my favorite song of this album, is the slow song ï¿½To Be Forgiven.ï¿½ I think the melody flows more nicely, and I find that bongo-heavy groove to be quite appealing. The atmosphere is rather haunting in spots there, thanks mostly to a flautist who is occasionally allowed to play some rather unusual scales. The flautist is also there for ï¿½The Strangest Thing.ï¿½ Even though its ridiculously monotonous drum pattern ends up getting the better of me on that one, if I'm able to tune it out, I'm left to enjoy some immensely lovely flute lines.\n\nIn short, this is a boring album. While George Michael manages to write a few decent things here and there, the fact remains that there are far too many slow songs in this album. And even the slow songs that I generally enjoy overstay their welcome by at least two minutes each. I like that there are a few moments here that can legitimately be described as haunting, but they are few and far between. As a whole, the instrumentation sounds like canned elevator music. While this isn't the worst album I've ever listened to, by a long shot, it's mediocre. If that assessment puts me in the minority of music fans, then I must be one of most exciting people on the planet.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nOlder\n\nMinutemen: Double Nickels on the Dime (1984)\n\nAlbum Score: 13\n\nThe sheer number of songs that are present on Double Nickels on the Dime is enough to blow your mind: Forty-three! Although, you might have 47 or 44 tracks depending on what edition you bought. Nevertheless that's a lot of songs for an eighty-minute album. That makes the average song length a little bit less than two minutes. The styles they come up with are sometimes random and staggering; the primary focus of the album is punk-rock and funk-rock, but I also detected some country-western, new wave, folk, pop, garage and avant-garde. Some of these songs sound like they had been planned extensively, and others seem improvised. You might think listening to such an album would be hard to take; believe me, I had that fear of it before I heard it. But, I'd say there's a good chance you'll love this album. It is widely considered one of the finest punk-rock albums of all time, and there's good reason for that.\n\nThe reason, of course, is because there is some freaking excellent stuff on here. You can probably understand that writing all 43 of the track reviews was very cumbersome task and it took a very long time, but there were so many staggeringly good songs that I enjoyed the process as much as I could. Ten of them received a pure A+ rating, eleven received an A rating, and nine received an A- rating! Also, I couldn't see any reason to score anything less than a B. So everything is good. (Hey, a song like the confused ï¿½ Please Don't Be Gentle With Meï¿½ might not be *good*, so to speak, but at least it had the good sense to pull out after only 46 seconds.) The only track that I don't like much at all is called ï¿½Three Car Jam,ï¿½ but that's almost by default since that's not really a *song* as much as it's a 38-second sound-byte of car engines starting.\n\nThe secret to Minutemen's success has more to do with their instrumental abilities than anything else. D. Boon might not have been much of a lead singer, but he could play his electric guitar like a kung-fu master. He could be pleasant and minimalist (ï¿½It's Expected I'm Goneï¿½), and he could play like he was trapped in a sped-up tape-deck (ï¿½The Politics of Timeï¿½). He was as comfortable with sloppy fuzz-guitar (ï¿½Nothing Indeedï¿½) as he was comfortable with blues (ï¿½It's Expected I'm Goneï¿½). He frequently tried out an ultra-slick funk-pop (ï¿½Theatre is the Life For Youï¿½), textural acoustical folk (ï¿½Cohesionï¿½), and even mystical, atmospheric noodles (ï¿½Do You Want New Wave or Do You Want the Truthï¿½). Indeed, Boon was quite an amazing fellow! Tragically, he would die in a car crash a year after this album was released. But of course, Boon wasn't the only member of this band; Mike Watt is an amazing bass player, which I frequently pointed out all throughout the track reviews, and George Hurley always seems to come up with tasty fills!\n\nMaybe the other track I don't care about is ï¿½Don't Look Now,ï¿½ but that's just because it's a live recording and the sound quality is atrocious. Even though this album is basically a smï¿½rgï¿½sbord of ideas, that song still seems to be out of place. Other than that, I'm willing to accept everything else no matter how ridiculous it sounds. I mentioned country-western before, which might have been met with a few gasps. Yes, country-western pops up in one song called ï¿½Corona.ï¿½ Surely, it's too fast-paced and creative to have ever made it big in the trailer parks, but it's crazy enough to be a big hit with me! The weirdest song on the bunch is really difficult to tell, but I'll have to go with ï¿½You Need the Glory,ï¿½ which is some sort of manic space-jazz. The band plays the weirdest, spaciest texture they could come up with while Boon does the most ridiculous scat-singing I've ever heard. Hilarious. ...Oh, and if you haven't noticed already, some of these song titles are very humorous. Get a load of these: ï¿½The Roar of the Masses Could Be Farts,ï¿½ ï¿½Political Song For Michael Jackson to Sing,ï¿½ ï¿½Jesus and Tequila.ï¿½ Those are great songs, too. They all got an A+.\n\nWhat's perhaps the most amazing thing about the album is not just that it has 43 songs on it, but most of them are actually well-developed. There are very few songs here that consists of simply one riff or one idea throughout its entire running length. Sometimes there's a chorus, sometimes there's another riff, or there could be a jazzy interlude. There's usually an introduction of some sort, and there are very few fade-outs. So, I rarely felt like any of these songs were too short. That's rather the opposite reaction I had to Guided By Voices' Bee Thousand, which was probably inspired by this album, but it didn't quite generate this remarkable vibe. So, in the end, Double Nickels on the Dime is a highly recommendable album, and it can also be easily enjoyed since most of them have either a hooky melody, hooky riff or both. The prospect of sitting through 43-tracks in 80 minutes probably doesn't appeal to everyone. It didn't appeal to me at first. But this is definitely worth at least one listen.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nDouble Nickels on the Dime\n\nThe Monkees: The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees (1968)\n\nAlbum Score: 11\n\nI don't want to say that Michael Nesmith is a John Lennon or anything, but this guy is freaking great! He doesn't do anything fundamentally different from many other songwriters of this era --- 1968 was a pretty strange year for music and the peak of psychedelia. But Nesmith takes these ideas and doesn't reduce them to the common denominator. He sounds fresh and vibrant! He takes on The Byrds' country-rock, jangly ideas for all they were worth on \"Auntie's Municipal Court\" and a wild hodge podge of ideas in \"Tapioca Tundra.\" He also writes a wholly enjoyable old-timey jazz pop tune \"Magnolia Simms\" as well as *ahem* Pink Floyd in \"Writing Wrongs.\" These are some of the best songs on the album --- pretty good for a manufactured band, I'd say! It's a shame Christina Aguilera can't reach this level of creativity with a 20-foot pole.\n\nNot to say that The Birds, The Bees and The Monkees is a great work of art, but --- it's an interesting pop album. Naturally, the melodies are the principal reason to give this a listen. Of course, Nesmith's melodies are lovely. Probably the most famous melody is \"Daydream Believer\" from an outside songwriter --- what a great chorus! Also, Boyce and Hart contribute their answer to The Magical Mystery Tour \"P. O. Box 9847.\" That track is a blast!\n\nI like Davey Jones' contributions as well. \"Dream World\" is an enjoyable pop number that also has something slightly off about it. His \"The Poster\" isn't as highly recommendable, but it's pretty good considering it's one of the album's weaker tracks. Oddly, his sunshine-pop song \"I'm Gonna Try\" in the bonus tracks is a real gem if you like that genre. Certainly they could have replaced the too-simplistic and generic \"We Were Made For Each Other\" (from outside songwriters) with that one in the regular album. Oh well... We still get to hear it at any rate.\n\nThis is just a good album. It's notably weaker than the predecessor Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, LTD, but possibly stranger. Well, that's definitely worth something! Thumbs up.\n\nRead the track reviews:\n\nThe Birds, The Bees & The Monkees\n\nThe Monkees: Head (1968)\n\nAlbum Score: 12\n\nGeez, this is some piece of work, and it's faaaaaaar from what you'd expect if you only know The Monkees for being those manufactured sunshine boys who were responsible for \"I'm a Believer\" and \"Theme from The Monkees.\" Even if you were paying attention to their excellent and artistically inclined 1967 and 1968 albums, you would never have expected something like this.\n\nThey're not so much taking hints from The Beatles any longer, but --- *gasp* --- Frank Zappa!!! This is an assembly of soundbytes to create a sort of extended avant-garde sound collage! Now don't let your imagination get too out of han"
