        "text": "Hey there,\n\nTo contribute to this topic I'd like to describe a genre I recently found, even though it's already more than 10 years old one as a phenomenon.\n\nIt goes about the genre called freak folk/folktronica/New Weird America. This is a subgenre of psychedelic and rock music which developed through the 00s. A favorite artist of mine is Devendra Banhart.\n\nspotify:track:4qkXVBPiuuF0mO1nApv9uK:small\n\nGreat example of the New Weird America sound is also Sufjan Stevens. His music explores themes like religion and spirituality and includes multiple instruments that he plays himself.\n\nspotify:track:6Rt6KwuF7I8ZkdZG2G0bYr:small\n\nCheers!\n\n*At Simooooooooooo*\n\nI loved this song you had on one of your playlists.\n\nspotify:track:7rhryng8NGv5rVCi6Qf2g5:small\n\nI guess here is m\n\nspotify:track:3o3Al0yzJ96J8h4QC6AMvy:small\n\nA mix of Jazz, Blues, Soul, R&B, (could be considered pop back in the day due it being popular music back in those days) Not sure if it is a random music genre. I think Ivan wrote a reply that is more true to original post.\n\nGreat idea, @angelicoluigi!\n\nOne genre of music that I often enjoy listening to is space rock. According to Wikipedia, it is “characterized by loose and lengthy song structures centered around instrumental textures that typically produce a hypnotic, otherworldly sound,” and “may feature distorted or reverberation-laden guitars, minimal drumming, languid vocals, synthesizers and lyrical themes of outer space and science fiction.” I’d say that most of the songs that I enjoy listening to that are labeled as “space rock” on last.fm represent these qualities fairly accurately.\n\nHere are some of my favorite tracks from my space rock playlist on Spotify:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2iGSLqquNEBGnsWj8vE7p2?si=86qsKAAIQ2yv7IWqy0AdPw\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/6m87ByFdRmhSKLvFS1jfGQ?si=PANlKabISYap0cleXvZmBg\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/7b6dpDFxj5hvjHVGqFhk97?si=lw2US8jgQuSo-G0qBp3BoA\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2ytXq1bTu0ewU7hB7GngpK?si=q5eTuZ3fRCS51_QT5fDzUw\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/1Sa0vhUyMRxGcH5sZ9aoO9?si=_GWjP2nVSHWjpllIW_ynIw\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2Id3nzKkfLspZGLIhvUVmN?si=W2OfpdA7QCimyvAQHPD1kQ\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/1zizFNq9BnZfhlBS75PaIr?si=o0sfRHbCRgaS3UYilLztYg\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/1t5rEvsVk0InxV61cwfAAP?si=KdPBO-4oRnWHp9e6b6Hwgg\n\nCheers!\n\nAdamDamSpotify Star\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nNote: I'm not a Spotify employee.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what it is but spotify said my third most-listened-to genre this year was \"progressive post-hardcore,\" the two bands i know tagged with that on last.fm are\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/4GW16Ro3oi6hAAIgOPTs4L?si=ZXr10MpsQESFra1kba-4ig\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/1lHWHBeiWUSM2SOYyPhYtw?si=x5ueYNmpR-23tntJ4BcfFw\n\n\"Extreme death metal\" - incorrect\n\n\"Experimental\" - the only one that fits\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2JCROlcp1xOfovuJ6VnO8J?si=mua4VsgSSqCX4VJFiWqCig"
