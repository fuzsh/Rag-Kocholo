        "text": "Lieutenant double-yefreitor Harrier \"Harry\" Du Bois is the sole player-controlled protagonist in Disco Elysium.\n\nBackground[ | ]\n\nLIMBIC SYSTEM – It was *him*. *He* is the infernal engine. He never stops. He only gets worse.\n\nHarrier Du Bois was born in ‘07, the last year of the Commune of Revachol, before the Coalition's attack, at a time when the Antecentennial Revolution was still going strong. He was born on the ground floor of Revachol's Old Military Hospital in The Pox during a snowstorm.[16][21] As a child, he suffered a bout of partial infantile paralysis caused by polio, and though he would for the most part physically recover from this condition, it gave him a permanent twinge in his jaw that affects pronunciation of certain words.[22]\n\nIn his adolescence, Harry was a member of a street-gang comprised of eight delinquents from Faubourg and North Jamrock calling themselves The Fifteenth Indotribe. Of all the former members, Harry is the only one who still lives.\n\nHarry's twenties coincided with \"the New\", a time of excess and opulence trigged by an economic upswing in both the Coalition of Nations and Revachol, and leading to the birth of a new music genre, disco, of which Harry himself became a fan. He became especially fond of the Revacholian Disco superstar Guillaume Le Million, whose stage persona and mannerisms he would try to emulate, leading to him adopting The Expression.[23]\n\nPrior to joining the RCM Harry was a high school gym teacher[24] in Grand Couron.[25] He met Dora Ingerlund, his future fiancée, while the two waited at a bus stop.[26] She inspired him to join the Revachol Citizens Militia at the age of 26. Over his 18 total years of service[27] Harry solved 216 cases[28] with a total of 3 confirmed kills,[29] an extremely low number for a member of Precinct 41.[30] His impressive ratio of solved cases placed him above 90 percent of officers in the entire RCM,[31] and he reached the rank of lieutenant along with two additional offered promotions, which he declined, instead being granted the title of lieutenant double-yefreitor[32] and retaining his position as head of the Major Crimes Unit in Precinct 41's C-Wing.[33] Despite his statistics, Harry's intense caseload[34][8] is implied to have only been made possible through the liberal use of stimulants[35][36] and other drugs, namely alcohol,[37] which led to instability and unpredictable behaviour while on the job. During a recent case, titled \"THE UNSOLVABLE CASE\", Harry had a drunken outburst where he rendered a man unable to walk after beating him with his ledger,[38] and some time prior to this he both missed a shot aimed at a fleeing suspect, who he hit in the pelvis, and physically held a woman in his apartment against her will. He is also generally known, feared[39] and even suspected to be one of La Puta Madre's peones by the public.[10] Harry's erratic behaviour drove off many former members of Precinct 41, including Guillaume Bevy,[40] but he was not disciplined due to his otherwise exceptional work,[38][41] and was even offered a promotion (which he declined) during this period.[42]\n\nApproximately six years[43] before the events of Disco Elysium, Dora left Harry and moved to Mirova.[44]\n\nSome time in the past, Harry purchased the horrific necktie,[45] which he gradually started to project a hyperactive and self-destructive personality onto, compelling him to dress in increasingly \"disco\" clothes,[46] and forget his problems through drinking and substance abuse.[47] Jean confirms that Harry has hallucinated his tie talking to him prior to his amnesia.[48]\n\nDirectly preceding the in-game events, Harry and the Major Crimes Unit were called to Martinaise to investigate a report of a hanging. When they arrived, Harry drove off the rest of the unit, screaming at them to \"fuck off\" because they were \"cramping [his] style. He was the \"Detective God.\" The rest of his tirade were variations on \"Fuck everything. All will burn. Detect or die!\".[49] He then went on a several-day suicidal bender across the district. He harassed the patrons at the Whirling-in-Rags, waving his gun in their faces and making graphic suicide jokes.[50] He trashed his room and broke the Whirling's taxidermy skua, finally driving the waitress Sylvie Malaìika to resign on the spot just to escape him.[51] He sold his gun to Bird's Nest Roy,[52] wrecked his Coupris 40,[53] and on the final night before he lost his memory, he could be heard in his room at the Whirling screaming \"I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS KIND OF ANIMAL ANYMORE\"[54] while listening to The Smallest Church in Saint-Saens on loop.[55]\n\nThe definite cause of Harry's amnesia is unknown, though he theorizes that it may be a side effect of pale exposure stemming from the two-millimeter hole in the church.[56] Joyce Messier believes that Harry must have been affected with a severe case of encephalopathy caused by his binge-drinking,[57] and Jean believes it's all an act,[58] however, Kim and Trant Heidelstam do not believe this to be the case, and Judit Minot confirms that Harry has had previous amnesiac blackouts in the past.[59] Upon failing a red Shivers skill check in the church, Harry appears to suffer a seizure, during which he experiences deja vu,[60] and then blacks out for thirty minutes.[61] After waking up, Harry tells Kim that he believes it may be related to his memory loss, and Kim agrees that it seems likely.[62]\n\nAppearance[ | ]\n\nHarry sports a greasy,[63][64] unkempt mullet and mutton chops[65] by default -- which he may choose to shave off after gaining access to the shack in the fishing village on Day 3+. His nose is red and bulbous, and beneath his facial hair, his face is swollen due to his copious consumption of alcohol.[66][67][68] Harry's jaw is crooked from contracting polio as a child,[22] and he has a dimple on his chin.[69][70] Should Harry choose to take on the task to turn back the wheels of time as part of the fascist political vision quest, he will appear slightly more put-together, with slicked back hair and (if he has not shaved) neater facial hair.\n\nHarry is described as being \"sturdy\"[71] in contrast with Kim. Notes from art director Aleksander Rostov describe Harry as having a \"kinda flabby chest but strong arms\" and \"long thin legs & bulky torso\" on his concept art.\n\nThe back of his right hand is scarred,[72] and both are covered with cuts and gashes from fighting. Harry's fingertips are also heavily discoloured from smoking.[73]\n\nThough he is able to pick up or purchase a variety of clothing, his default attire consists of a green suede blazer adorned with RCM watermarks across the back and the right sleeve, golden brown, flare-cut trousers, white satin shirt, and a horrific necktie.\n\nTrivia[ | ]\n\nPrior to the events of the game, Harry was shot at four times, and hit twice.[74] His RCM Patrol Cloak is stated to have three bullet holes, meaning that he was likely wearing it when this happened, and that while the third shot was close enough to go through the cloak, it did not enter his body.\n\nAs part of RCM training, every officer has to pick a civil specialization; Harry chose building safety regulation.[75] Whilst answering a call alone for a domestic disturbance he found a tenement building on the verge of collapse and organized an evacuation of all residents.[76] However, the building never fell, and he is disturbed by the idea that people still live there despite the fact that it could collapse any day.[77]\n\nAs a child, Harry had an interest in being a poet, and studying entroponetics.[78] Attempting to present a theory about the 2mm hole in the church for Soona reveals that Harry retained his interest in the pale as an adult, and previously theorized with friends about its origin point.[79]\n\nHarry framed his patrol uniform and hung it on his apartment wall.[80]\n\nAn Endurance check indicates that Harry has a poor diet, described as \"greasy meals scarfed down between shifts\", which, combined with his alcohol intake, has left him with bad gut health.[81]\n\nThe \"Yefreitor\" portion of Harry's rank is likely taken from the real-world Soviet military rank Yefreytor (Ефрейтор, from the German Gefreiter), which was the highest enlisted rank in the Soviet armed forces.\n\nGallery[ | ]\n\nLogician archetype\n\nBrute archetype\n\nSensitive archetype\n\nWhat awaits below?\n\nStarting portrait\n\nShaved portrait\n\nUnshaved, no expression\n\nShaved, no expression\n\nAbsolutely huge fascist\n\nAbsolutely huge, shaven fascist"
