        "text": "Have your say on these MetroTalk topics and more in the comments.\n\nThe poor families of those children killed and injured in the Southport knife attack mean zero to these thugs.\n\nHow many of those vile individuals who have decided to riot are gainfully employed? And I am horrified to see mothers with babies in prams joining in or observing.\n\nThe violence and damage to homes and businesses will not bring back those three little girls. Shame on those rioting – as if they give a damn about anyone but themselves. AH, Leeds\n\nWe need to stay united in the face of racist fascists\n\nI totally agree with M Reader (MetroTalk, Fri) that in no way was this ‘mindless’ violence. It was organised and encouraged by fascists and racists.\n\nThis racist violence deliberately targets Muslims and immigrants, while threatening and abusing anyone who disagrees with their hatred and bigotry.\n\nWe are a vibrant multicultural society and all the better for it.\n\nDon’t let the fascists divide us – we all need to stay united. Stephen Hack, South London\n\nBroken brexit promises and the ‘full force of the law’\n\nBrexiteers were promised a better life in a new world outside the EU. But it isn’t. The same politicians now blame immigration, leading to the disaffected trying to burn down hotels housing asylum seekers. We need accountability and truth back in politics. Neil Dance, Birmingham\n\nKeir Starmer has warned rioters that they will feel the ‘full force of the law’. I wonder what that will mean.\n\nJust Stop Oil campaigners have rightly been imprisoned for two years. Will these morons get more than that? With prisons already overcrowded, I doubt it.\n\nRishi Sunak’s government promised to bring back national service for 18-year-olds. Perhaps the sentence for these thugs should be three years of national service. David, Shropshire\n\nIf a shortage of prison places makes it difficult for rioters to be locked up, may I suggest sending them to Rwanda? Valerie, London\n\nA quick footnote to all the brave protesters who went out abusing and assaulting police officers, looting shops, torching libraries and setting fire to cars. It’s all very well wearing baseball caps, balaclavas, bandanas and hoodies to hide your identity while you lay waste to our streets and wreck our communities, but don’t forget about the DNA you’ll all be leaving from dragging your knuckles along the pavement. Julian Self, Wolverton\n\nI don’t know why they call them the ‘far right’ because they’re inevitably wrong. Anyone suspected of taking part in the Southport riots should be made to take an IQ test and have the results printed in their local paper. Roger Watts, Walsall\n\nThe violence by the far-right thugs up and down the country since the tragic deaths of those three girls is a disgrace and has no place in this country. These morons have nothing to do with the events in Southport last week.\n\nIt is time to stop dilly-dallying with these miserable excuses for human beings and give the police powers to use water cannon and tear gas to disperse the rioters. Mike Morfey, Streatham Vale\n\nThe evil racist scum who have brought terror to the streets are no different from the Nazi brown-shirt thugs who terrorised Germany’s Jewish population in the 1930s.\n\nAnd those right-wing politicians who attempted to justify such cowardly acts of thuggery should themselves be charged with inciting violence.\n\nWorld War II would never have happened if ordinary, decent Germans had not closed their eyes to what was happening in their country.\n\nWe must not allow history to repeat itself here. It’s time to let the Army loose on the vermin! Bob Readman, Sevenoaks\n\n‘Thanks, Metro, for being so fair’\n\nMuch of Britain’s media publishes supposition and conjecture, rather than what is actually going on in the world, and tries to influence people’s thinking.\n\nMetro has no editorial, it is unbiased, it reports facts and it allows its readers to draw their own conclusions. You treat us as intelligent individuals rather than idiots whose opinions must be shaped for us.\n\nThank you, Metro. Please keep up the good work. Brian, Dartford\n\nMORE : The best way to stop seagulls from stealing your food revealed\n\nMORE : Girl, 6, denied a passport because she’s named after a Game of Thrones character\n\nMORE : Banksy unveils mystery new artwork in London"
