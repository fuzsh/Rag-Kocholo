        "text": "I saw the documentary a couple of weeks ago, it totally changed my perception of the group.\n\nI am in the UK, and remember the single being promoted in '81/'82 was \"Automatic\", which is pretty downbeat and at odds with the picture disc that was being promoted. After that I recall seeing a clip of \"Vacation\" on one of the occasional US chart rundowns that would appear on \"Top Of The Pops\", then even later Fun Boy Three were mentioning them a lot in interviews when promoting their second album and \"Our Lips Are Sealed\". I don't know why, but there just wasn't enough exposure in the UK to warrant more people buying into them. I never knew they were on \"Whistle Test\" and \"The Tube\" but they were (clips are on YouTube).\n\nBelinda was of course hugely popular in the UK, and has done a lot of media here which is where I think the Go-Go's as a band missed out. I think Belinda had a foot-in-the-door in the UK as a known singer, but it was the material that clicked with the UK audience at the time.\n\nKathy Valentine is an amazing bass player, she is so tight playing with Gina but also highly melodic on the Go-Go's material I've seen online.\n\nI've found this thread kind of fascinating, in part because of how many different kinds of perspectives it brings up. I've noticed that most of the folks (including me) who found the original question kind of puzzling have been Americans, which makes me wonder whether there might be some fundamental differences in the musical contexts at the time between the UK and the US. Like several other US posters, my initial thought on reading the question (\"Were they marketed as pop or as rock?\") was along the lines of \"Well, they were both, just like most of the popular acts at the time.\" This makes me wonder whether that just wasn't the case in the UK in the early eighties, and there was more of a clear-cut division between the genres there.\n\nIn the US, for teenagers like me just getting into music in the early '80s via MTV, there wasn't much of a distinction between rock and pop--most of what they played could have been (and often was) called \"pop rock,\" and an hour's broadcast in 1982 or so would likely have included Pat Benatar, Talk Talk, John Cougar, Toni Basil, Kim Wilde, Ultravox, Asia, and the Go-Go's. Top 40 radio was pretty much the same as MTV at the time, and even rock radio (based on WMMS in Cleveland) was not dramatically different from top 40 radio (it probably wouldn't have played Haircut 100, but the Go-Go's were probably fair game). So, to many Americans, at least, the obvious answer is that like many bands at the time, they were played on both pop and rock radio (though it's easier for me to imagine rock stations that would have ignored them than pop stations).\n\nIt's interesting, because I think nowadays in the US, there is probably a FAR more clear distinction between pop (with a strong dance/electropop/hip-hop/r&b influece) and rock in the mainstream media. In the early '80s, though, many of the biggest acts could be considered both, and there was a lot of overlap between pop and rock stations. But I'm curious about the UK. Was A Flock of Seagulls considered pop or rock? How about Men at Work, or Roxy Music during the Manifesto and Flesh and Blood eras?"
