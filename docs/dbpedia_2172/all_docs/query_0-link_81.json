        "text": "by Chris Fuller‚Ä¶\n\nSeagulls is a four-piece, mid- tempo, gravelly pop punk band from the bustling metropolis that is Atlanta, GA. Formed in 2012 and fueled by cheap beer and questionable cylindrically-shaped gas station cuisine, they traipse through dive bars and divier basements throughout the southeast playing anthemic punk screeds meant for pounding tallboys and pumping fists. They‚Äôve released 2 self-recorded EPs- ‚ÄòAll the World‚Äôs Wars‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Royal We‚Äô (via Autumn and Colour) ‚Äì and are currently hard at work writing for their first full length.\n\nCheck out tracks from their recent album, ‚Äòthe Royal We‚Äô..\n\nThe Royal We by Seagulls\n\nBeAtlanta ‚Äì Who are the members of Seagulls and what do you play?\n\nScottie (Scott Lobster) Holzwart ‚Äì Drums\n\nBilly Duncan ‚Äì Lead Guitar\n\nDom DiCecco ‚Äì Guitar/vox\n\nSteve (Steve-dad) (Steve-dave) Johnson ‚Äì Bass/vox\n\nB ‚Äì What does the name Seagulls mean?\n\nSteve- I‚Äôm going to let Billy take this one. I was pretty open to names so long as they were easy to remember and spell.\n\nBilly- It‚Äôs from the book ‚ÄúJonathan Livingston Seagull‚Äù.\n\nB ‚Äì What kind of music would you describe Seagulls as playing?\n\nSteve- gruff, melodic pop punk.\n\nBilly- punk rock, pop punk, melodic hardcore, orgcore.. take your pick.\n\nB ‚Äì What bands influenced you to write?\n\nSteve- I steal most everything from Iron Chic, Nothington, Red City Radio, and Dillinger Four. Songs are based around 4 or 5 chords and then add a guitar and vocal melody over them. Throw in occasional harmonies and bam- that‚Äôs one in the can.\n\nBilly- Hard question to answer.. Right off the top, Hot Water Music, The Cure, Jawbreaker, Smashing Pumpkins, and a bunch of 80‚Äôs shit.\n\nDom- Dillinger Four\n\nScott- Blink182, Yellowcard, Rise Against, and most recently The Wonder Years.\n\nB ‚Äì Do you have any pre-show rituals?\n\nSteve- nothing out of the ordinary. Grab a couple drinks, tune, play. Drink some more.\n\nBilly- Lots of Red Bull. Listening to Lamb of God in the van.\n\nDom- Pooping (very important), chugging energy drinks\n\nScott- Some warm-ups to get my hands moving and stretching.\n\nB ‚Äì What other bands have you been in?\n\nSteve- In Alabama I formed a band called August Spies that is still going strong and is like a more country version of Seagulls. In Chicago I was in a melodic hardcore punk band called Fat Sally.\n\nBilly- In ATL, Ricer.\n\nDom- None worth mentioning\n\nScott- A pop-punk band with some of my old friends. New Sound Accomplice. A few other smaller ones.\n\nB ‚Äì Where have you played recently, where do you like to play in Atlanta?\n\nSteve- WonderRoot is pretty much our jam by choice. I do a decent amount of booking for small, but great, touring bands that are coming through and the small production costs at WonderRoot allow us to keep the costs down and attendance high.\n\nBilly- We LOVE playing Wonderroot. Pretty much any DIY spot where you can bring your own beer. But now it‚Äôs summer and WR doesn‚Äôt have A/C.. so, we are trying to branch out.\n\nDom- Wonderroot is always a good time (shout out to Chopper Dave Sherman), 529 is the best sounding venue in ATL, Drunken Unicorn is a close 2nd. Both are also great places to play.\n\nScott- Most recently Wonderroot. I haven‚Äôt really played enough places to give a good answer.\n\nB ‚Äì Do you have any CD‚Äôs or records out?\n\nSteve- We officially have 2 digital EPs out- ‚ÄòThe Royal We‚Äô (through Autumn + Colour Records) and ‚ÄòAll the World‚Äôs Wars‚Äô. Both are self recorded. Both are free on our bandcamp page (http://seagullsatl.bandcamp.com). Both are available just about everywhere online.\n\nBilly- Only digital releases, at the moment. ‚ÄúThe Royal We‚Äù just came out on Autumn and Colour and our first EP, ‚ÄúAll The World‚Äôs Wars‚Äù, is available for free on our bandcamp page. (seagullsatl.bandcamp.com)\n\nScott- /\\ What they said.\n\nB ‚Äì If you could play anywhere(not a venue), where would you really want to play?\n\nSteve- I‚Äôm from Chicago, so right now my goal is to get a tour booked up there to go play a show with the guys I played with in high school. We also had friends in Europe suggest we go over there and play, which sounds awesome but financially impractical.\n\nBilly- THE FEST in Gainesville, FL. Maybe next year üôÅ\n\nDom- Inside the sarcophagus in Chernobyl\n\nScott- Does Gillette Stadium count? Somewhere that‚Äôs not a venue‚Ä¶. An aircraft carrier.\n\nWhat inspires the lyrics?\n\nSteve- Life. Generally I try to keep them positive as I don‚Äôt do well with bands/people constantly bitching about their life and not doing anything to change it. Sometimes things suck, but there‚Äôs always light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBilly ‚Äì Take it away, Steve..\n\nB ‚Äì What kind of equipment do you use?\n\nSteve ‚Äì My go to right now is a 2000 Fender pbass through an Ampeg SVT-2 pro out of an Ampeg 410hlf heritage cab. The most important part of the whole shebang is a tuner.\n\nBilly- OOOOoooo, I love talking gear! Current setup: Mesa Boogie .50 cal head with a Marshall 1960 cab and a Fender Mustang with a JB Humbucker. We have too many amps/cabs laying around the practice space. Dom and I are always experimenting with different tones.\n\nDom- Gibson Les Paul Classic, Marshall JCM800, Orange 4√ó12.\n\nScott- A gretsch catalina club kit. Pearl 14‚Äù Ian Paice custom snare. Mix and match set of cymbals and hardware.I switch between evans and remo heads. Vater 2B sticks.\n\nB ‚Äì What is Seagulls next step in the Atlanta music scene?\n\nSteve- Write good songs with our new drummer, record more, and stay relevant.\n\nBilly- As a band, our main goal is getting a physical release out. Aside from that, Steve and I are working on the second Jabronifest and with the Blood Drunk Records dudes for Bummer Summer. Steve is usually busy booking shows at WR.\n\nDom- Hopefully not in a pile of dog shit\n\nScott- Writing, recording, and shows.\n\nB ‚Äì Anything you want to say to the fans?\n\nBilly- Hey, Rick. Hope you are doing well.\n\nDom- Sorry.\n\nReview of ‚Äòthe Royal We‚Äô from Scene Point Blank:\n\n‚ÄòThe opening track , ‚ÄúThe Implication,‚Äù is the perfect indication for what you can expect from the rest of the EP. It‚Äôs loud and boisterous. One of the better pop-punk songs I‚Äôve heard this year so far. The rest of the EP doesn‚Äôt stray from the formula. ‚ÄúDarryl Strawberry Fields Forever‚Äù and ‚ÄúClose One‚Äù are rife with gang vocals and catchy melodies.‚Äô\n\nFrom Rock Freaks:\n\n‚Äòthink gravelly vocals, shout-along choruses, and infectious melodies that gain a great deal of character from the roared, edgy delivery of their vocalist Steve-Dave Johnson. It‚Äôs a sound that exhibits honesty and passion throughout, which is also why the band probably doesn‚Äôt give a shit that their sound is also very similar to the likes of Nothington, Bathurst and Nightlights.‚Äô\n\nFor more on Seagulls, check out their official site HERE, their FaceBook page HERE and their BandCamp HERE‚Ä¶\n\nchrisfuller"
