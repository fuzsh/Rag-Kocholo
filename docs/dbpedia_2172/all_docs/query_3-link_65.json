For their helpful suggestions concerning relevant bibliography, repertory, and conceptual details, I would like to thank Karol Berger, Daniel Chiarilli, James Currie, Lawrence Earp, Kai Fikentscher, Christopher Gibbs, Lorena Guillen, Martha Hyde, Michael Martin, Peter Schmelz, Charles Smith, Peter Otto, and Albin Zak. Caryl Emerson, Christopher J . Long, Harold Rosenbaum, and Jayson Rodovsky each shared specific expertise on matters of language, linguistics, or Yiddish song. M y thanks also to William Rosar for his generosity as an interlocutor and as a repository of details related to the early years of sound cinema. Some of the material in this book was developed while teaching seminars at the University at Buffalo and as a visitor at the Eastman School of Music, and my work has profited from discussions with graduate students in both those contexts. I am grateful to the music librarians at both institutions for their assistance and cooperation, especially John Bewley, Rick MacRae, Nancy Nuzzo, and Gerry Szymanski. For the provision of illustrative material, I am grateful to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery; also to Arnold Berlin (www.stafford shire.org). Special thanks to Trevor C. Bjorklund who, during a very busy phase in his own life, volunteered to prepare the musical examples, a task he carried out with expertise, efficiency, and good humor. ix\n\nX\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI thank the anonymous readers for the University of California Press for their many helpful comments. Special thanks to Richard Taruskin, the most formidable reader I know, for his detailed review of the manuscript and for the enlivening conversations that followed. His insights and suggestions were invaluable in making this book significantly better than it would have been otherwise. I am further indebted to him and to Elaine Sisman for their many years of service as colleagues, friends, and cheerleaders. My work has benefited from their unwavering encouragement and especially from the models provided by their distinguished and inspiring scholarship. For their hard work, congeniality, and expertise I thank also my production editor at the University of California Press, Jacqueline Volin, and copy editor Julie Brand. I bear full responsibility for any stylistic or conceptual infelicities that remain. I am especially grateful to Mary Francis, who has shepherded this project since its inception with wisdom, generosity, and patience. Finally, I have to thank Robert W. Marion, MD, for having unknowingly (to either of us) planted the seeds of this study in our childhood by a remark about Procol Harum's \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" that I have always remembered. Suggesting with breathless enthusiasm (and thinly veiled impatience), \"Michael, even you will like this song,\" he may have initiated my contemplation of those processes of appreciation and communication explored in the pages that follow.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPrompted by the \"crisis\" of devaluation and delegitimation of (mainly) European literate art music over the course of the previous generation, Julian Johnson fired a question into the apparent cultural void with his 200Z monograph Who Needs Classical Music?1 If there is an answer implicit in the following study, it is that classical music is and will likely continue to be fundamental to everyone who has confronted or been confronted by it, even or perhaps especially when it has taken the form of a reconfigured fragment. Since the crisis to which Johnson's book responds appears to be bound at least as much to institutions as to sounds, and is linked more to received modes of framing, evaluation, and analysis than to other varieties of musical perception, mourning the supposed decline of the classics strikes me as maudlin. For Johnson, classical music (including twentiethcentury modernism) constitutes a language—a word that turns up with some regularity in his text—that differs fundamentally from the plurality of musical languages he grudgingly welcomes but ultimately dismisses. His insistent, if understated, taxonomy of language is built upon a discursive foundation he has grounded in the elements of music most germane to his evaluative arguments, elements such as musical form and harmony. (Thus his enthusiasm for the aesthetically bracing challenges of musical dissonance.) Focusing on music's nuts and bolts, and specifically those easily demonstrated and enumerated by reference to printed musical scores (however much all of this hardware may transport us when presented in performance), Johnson argues for the discouraging \"simplicity\" of a great\n\ni\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\ndeal of twentieth-century popular song, along with other types of mainstream music.2 I agree (as most everyone will) that it is not easy to talk about what music does without recourse to a vocabulary linked to our understanding of language, of how we use it and why we use it at all. In the pages that follow I will refer at times to the academic sciences of language, but any borrowed concepts are not rallied to support the promulgation of structural models or analytical systems. They are selected instead for their relevance to concretizing the human need for particular modes of expression and are dependent upon nothing more technical than a kind of situational linguistics. Johnson's position regarding the special qualities that inhere in the literate art-music tradition will be clear to anyone reading his work; his arguments have little to do with the substance of mine, and their usefulness as a foil will not extend much beyond this introduction. But in situating the music I treat in the pages that follow, one of Johnson's formulations is particularly relevant. Referring to Simon Frith's work on the sociological implications of musical valuation, and to Frith's reporting of a mode of dismissive criticism often employed by \"mass\" audiences in assigning the adjective stupid to music that consumers sense \"demeans us through our involvement, however unwilling, in the collusive act of listening,\" Johnson appropriates their same tone. His position, hardly unique, is based, again, on a language analogy: for music to have value it should possess coherence, continuity, and challenging originality, rather along the lines of a nicely composed essay. With an eye toward provocation, Johnson expresses his own perspective on Muzak and its degenerate kin, the whole clan of sounds regularly served up by radio or in clubs, on television, in film, and as an accompaniment to video games: \"Much of the music that surrounds us acts as a kind of aural tranquilizer. So-called elevator music is not confined to elevators: music that expunges any unfamiliar element, any hint of complexity or self-development saturates the private and communal spaces of modern life. This music is inane, stupid, and empty in the same way that repetitive and undeveloped writing is stupid, full of clichés and non sequiturs, attempting to pass off empty and worn-out phrases as the vehicles of genuine thought and emotion.\" 3 This book addresses what Johnson characterized as the hollow and predictable fakes. The musical and textual clichés, fragments, non sequiturs, and undeveloped iterations of twentieth-century media, specifically those that are related to the noise of \"genuine\" art and its consumers, form the core of this study. It is largely devoted—by Johnson's\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ndefinition—to stupid music, a construction that brands the conventionality of his musical aesthetic and that I appropriate therefore with some seriousness of purpose. My intent is to bring a methodologically flexible—that is, a \"generalist\"—perspective to bear upon music that has often been represented even by its adherents and its devoted analysts as something essentially distinct from that which lay at the heart of academic musical discourse prior to the last decades of the twentieth century. With the advent of historical and critical studies of popular musics and film music, it has seemed that even as items formerly residing at the artistic periphery (within the discursive and aesthetic constructions of the old academy) were being moved toward the foreground, this repositioning demanded mastery of specific methodological and critical strategies. Particularly when approaching rock and pop, scholars have regularly turned to academically sanctioned paths of enriched sociological contextualization (by which I mean disciplinarily defined methodologies), as if to underscore such music's privileged ties to the century's material culture—in the ethnographic sense—which concert hall music did not enjoy.4 This has encouraged, in some cases at least, the abdication of historical perspective for descriptive culturology.5 While the musics associated with Hollywood cinema and with mainstream rock and pop that serve as the focus for my discussions have been on the musicological table for some time, scholars have not encouraged conversation among works originating within different media (or different genres within the same medium). Nor has there been much call for the integration of historical, critical, and intellectual apparatuses regularly brought to the historiography and criticism of concert hall music. Even Nicholas Cook's broad and innovative Analysing Musical Multimedia usually addresses a single topic related to a single work, medium, or genre in each chapter essay.6 And while in recent years practitioners of film-music criticism have repeatedly addressed the so-called use of popular music in film scores (also so-called in many such cases), these analyses usually amount to narrative glosses. And so I attempt in this study to bring a wide range of items closer to a single conversational and methodological center as it continues to be imagined by many scholars working in the ever more ghettoized realm of European musical museums with longer histories. In drawing together musical material from film, rock, and the concert hall, I have tried to acknowledge but not rely upon the idiolects and approaches linked only to methodological, terminological, or repertorial ghettos of more recent design.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe embarrassment academics daily confront when we halfheartedly recite categories of \"art\" and \"popular\" that we know are meaningless or wrong, and the extent to which we still regularly frame our own language in air, scare, or typographical quotes, suggests that if we could comfortably recategorize the objects of our discourse we would likely do so. Replacing old chestnuts is no less problematic. Many of our systematic markers of classification, including even those derived from vocabularies of recent vintage such as \"hegemonic\" and \"counter-hegemonic,\" demark the rest of what in other respects might be legitimate and fluent expositions (demark in the Deleuzian sense, since they crash into our otherwise nuanced conversations as clumsily as Hitchcock's seagull into Tippi Hedrin's forehead). 7 1 tend to ignore most such distinctions except in those cases where they are decisively called for by the object under consideration, hoping to expose and emphasize the links between items formerly stored in different cabinets. In many cases the links are forged by musical gesture, in others they are suggested by broader cultural readings. Direct relationships between Andrei Tarkovsky and Procol Harum, T. S. Eliot and Michael Jackson, or Bugs Bunny and Freddie Mercury, might be trivial or even nonexistent; the webs in which they have been mutually implicated are not, however, and these transcend directional associations of influence, imitation, or referentiality. While my text is bookended by Dante and the Sony PlayStation, respectively, there is no continuous chronological trajectory to its organization, and some individuals and musical works will be examined from more than one perspective. So, for example, musical motives associated with the composers Richard Addinsell and Bernard Herrmann are considered within a particular frame in chapter i , where their resurrection as rap samples is shown both to link and to differentiate their presence in late twentieth-century recorded music in revealing ways. Each \"original,\" however, will return later in the book, reconsidered against the backdrop of some broader contexts for its creation and reception by different audiences in other generations. Even though this study considers musical or multimedia works that were widely circulated by the machinery of twentieth-century commerce, my choice of \"media\" rather than \"mass media\" in the title derives from my sense that the massness of mass media—the feature that has rendered media products artistically, economically, politically, and sociologically suspect—is largely an academic digression. In fact, the consumption of mass media even prior to the digital age, as far back as the period of music-store listening booths and pre-surround-sound the-\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\naters, or even the makeshift viewing environments of earliest cinema I describe in chapter 6, made room for new forms of individual apprehension unfettered by social mannerisms and public graces. This grand shift in musical reception was at least as significant as the new tendency to meddle with the supposed integrity of classical music's authentic content and mode of presentation; and while driven perhaps by the availability of options linked to commerce, it was not configured by commerce at the level of the individual human experience. For the most part this phenomenon was historically unimaginable except in unusual cases linked to practices of musica secreta or reservata such as that associated with the solitary keyboard players of the eighteenth century recalled in chapter 5. Processes of reception provide one thread that may be usefully traced through the webs of historical linkage associated with the repertory of (stupid) music considered here. Although my title flaunts the term \"classic,\" this book is concerned primarily with a collective, not quite definable, yet inescapably powerful \"vernacular imagination.\" Vernacular here is intended simply in the sense of something commonly shared or understood by a community. Since my emphasis throughout this book will be on items that are drawn from among the most commercially successful and widely consumed products of twentieth-century musical media, that community must be taken to consist of what from a sociological perspective is likely a problematically broad, amorphous, undifferentiated demographic: American and in a few cases European media audiences of the last century. What I think of as the \"imaginative\" classic is generated from within the space of an artist's imaginary and reflects a creative or re-creative process typically related to a slate of priorities (aesthetic, ethical, sensual) that intersects with a prioritized sense of the past. Calling upon a concept based in the memory arts of the European Middle Ages, I would suggest that the imaginative classic also denotes a particular collection of boxes associated with the imagination's reliance upon memory and the essential function of imaginative memory as both a filter and a repository.8 Thus my attention turns to Mnemosyne, maternal guardian of memory, in the book's conclusion. These tracks and processes are significant. The imaginative path taken by an auditor to judge that an item—however fragmentary and in Johnson's terms insufficient with respect to the syntactical or grammatical proprieties of \"language\" as the stuff of forms—marks an intersection with the classic is as relevant as the classic's reinvention by that item's creator. This classic, then, embraces historical and contemporary products as\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nwell as states and operations of mind, in the latter instance providing a taxonomic umbrella for a particular mode or trail of reception. By the activities of evaluating objects to distinguish the classic from the merely vintage and, for historical works produced in the fifteenth through the nineteenth centuries, critiquing in retrospect the means by which such evaluations were recorded, the attention of scholars is typically diverted from the process of the classic's imagining and the forms taken by its imaginative promulgation. I examine many items in this book from perspectives of both creation and reception. If any single theoretical or disciplinary position informs my approach to the diverse materials explored in this study, it is an intention to practice and perhaps extend the potential of a kind of musicology of the whole that Richard Middleton called for from a rather different perspective more than a decade ago, an optimistic proposal that for the most part has remained unrealized within the arena of specialized musicological discourse concerning the musical media of the twentieth century. 9 Chapters i and 2 examine the ways in which the musical classic, so labeled, has been heard and understood as an object of reception in a variety of contexts. I mean hearing the classic literally: by what means does the classic announce itself as an aural presence or a force in operation outside its own time and context, within a mediated environment, perceived and comprehended by unscreened or unprepared audiences? Drawing upon notions of \"register\" as understood within the domain of historical systems of poetics and rhetoric, and more recently in the arena of sociolinguistic discourse that gave this expressive practice its musical name, I suggest a conceptual frame for the creative and receptive processes associated with hybrid music. Tracing a single gesture through multiple registrations in chapter 2. underscores how, unlike taxonomies of genre or audience, registers function within living systems of expressive discourse. These are often oral (and aural), but even when literate they tend to be powered by the implicative presence of aural markers. Chapter 3 extends the registral function of the musical classic in a particular rhetorical direction and considers the role of media (not only musical media but all in which music has resonance, including mass-market literature) in promoting and embodying vernacular or domestic systems of ethics, political and spiritual. In this and other cases the recourse to classical gestures within a conventional system of ethical rhetoric is linked to the expressive practices of economic, ethnic, aesthetic, or social outsiders. Taken to particular extremes of affectation and representation, they may eventually intersect\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nwith the traditional aesthetic null sets of kitsch or camp, often associated with creative artists—some of them encountered in this book—who were Jewish (like Al Jolson and M a x Steiner), gay (like Jimmy Somerville and Freddie Mercury) or both (like Allen Ginsberg). Such labels are linked to perspectives that are more sociological (that is, bound up with the definition of groups) than artistic or musical. 10 Even in discussing these zones of cultural activity, I have tried to maintain the focus on specific intersections of musical and visible gesture positioned within culturally and chronologically broad categories of expression. I have tried to analyze even these categories not as touchstones for social theory but as regions within a general musical history of commercial media and artistic production. Chapter 4 introduces the second part of the book and attempts to open up the acoustic, topographical, and temporal spaces of the auditory imagination addressed in the remaining chapters. Throughout these, I address the potential relevance of historical aesthetics and cultural practice to the creation and reception of twentieth-century musical media. M y point here is not to suggest that twentieth-century media merely reiterate or revisit aspects of these environments. I am more intrigued by the possibility that such cultural analogies might offer unexpectedly relevant frames for our own imaginatively critical hearing of mass-market works that are usually assigned to more predictable categories. The emphasis throughout is on \"cinematic\" listening, a process of simultaneous audiation and envisioning; this concept extends beyond film to the soundscapes of classical and vernacular musics and especially to their hybrids. In my discussion of acoustical nostalgia in chapter 5 , 1 suggest— with the help of visual-art analogies—that by extending our understanding of music's expressive capacity to aural features beyond those of its fundamental elements (like pitch, harmony, timbre), media items of apparently insignificant aesthetic value often take on a sense of remarkable depth (in both literal and evaluative understandings of that word). I consider music's implicit visual dimensions and its occupation of conceptual space within more literally cinematic contexts in chapter 6. There, and again in chapter 7 , 1 return to matters of gesture and the expressive function of musical registers described in the first part of the book; the emphasis here, though, is on the ways in which aural gestures can trigger the construction or recall of particular image registers and the reverse. In essence, the position on the musical classic in the twentieth century set forth in these pages is not far removed from that of Wilhelm Hein-\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nrich Riehl's assessment of folk music in the century before: \"Folk songs are not once-and-for-all finished things, but are in a constant state of becoming. . . . Our ancient folk melodies are not dead 'reliques,' history lives and breathes in them.\" 1 1 Radical as it may seem to replace \"folk songs\" with \"classical compositions\" in the face of Johnson and other treasurers of the notated canon, the move, as I argue in the first chapter, would in fact reflect the flavor of most thoughtful expositions on the nature of the classic since such a thing was first put into words. As for the \"beautiful monsters,\" even though the phrase in my title is borrowed from a journalist's comment on Procol Harum's song \"A Whiter Shade of Pale,\" discussed in the second part of the book, these extraordinary yet strangely familiar creatures begin to materialize much sooner. Cinematic projections—realized or imagined—of musical utterance, musical hearing, and musical reception, they lurk throughout the conceptual spaces described in this book.\n\nCHAPTER\n\nI\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular W h a t we call the c o m m o n tongue is that which we acquire without any rule, by imitating our nurses. Dante Alighieri, On\n\nEloquence\n\nin the Vernacular (De vulgari eloquentia)\n\nAt the beginning of the fourteenth century Dante proposed—radically, for his time—that not only classical Latin but vernacular languages as well might serve as agents for eloquent and even elevated poetic expression. Even if his case was strategic, since he intended to promote his native Tuscan idiolect as the most \"literary\" among the many forms taken by what we now call Italian, his methodology foreshadowed in a general way the enterprise of modern sociolinguistics. In his unfinished treatise on the eloquent vernacular, the medieval poet attempted to describe broadly and systematically how language is acquired, and how it strikes the ear. Suggesting that some languages and their verbal forms and gestures could provide models for meaningful imitation or refashioning outside their original ethnic and cultural environments, he argued that the expressive features of a language resided in its sound, and might even be grasped without command of its grammar, a \"second\" and less essential form of language. His observations constituted a watershed of cultural practice: vernacular literature would soon take off, not only in Italy but in France and England, where poets like Machaut and Chaucer were ready to embrace Dante's modernist perspective. Dante's sense of how language works is especially relevant to musical media repertories of the twentieth century (including some of the monster hits of rock and pop), in which concert hall music, as it was popularly imagined and characterized by those whose experience lay primarily outside the walls of \"classical\" music venues, played a significant i i\n\n12\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nexpressive role even though its musical grammar did not. How have so many musical works in our own time indulged in reference and citation without compromising vernacular intelligibility and, most important, expressive immediacy? Modern academic readers are familiar with notions of cultural register, a term that appears often in discussions of such hybrids, usually alongside the scalar modifiers \"high\" and \"low.\" I would like to bring this commonplace into sharper focus, by invoking register less as a general indicator of cultural location than in a more specific sense familiar to scholars of medieval poetics who have linked the sensory aspects of cultural products to the expressive value of the registers (i.e., collections) in which they are understood to be located.1 In the case of poetry, the bearer of register will be words, of course. 2 Their sensory apparatus can include a range of qualitative and quantitative elements such as phonemes, number of syllables, and resonance with other words; this understanding might be amplified to include, in the case of song, the acoustical components of musical settings. Register, particularly in its expressive function as outlined below, is related to the broader fields of acculturated styles and genres in which it functions as a signal and marker and thus may be (and, especially in literary criticism, has been) expanded beyond the measurements of a simple scale to a system of classification based on words, syntax, form, and sounds; it often serves in place of more general notions of, for example, tenor, tone, and style. Indeed, once they have been sufficiently registered (or registrated) as normative practice, sounds in general may be expressive in this sense with no textual linkage. I see some potential in an expanded approach to the implications (especially for reception) of defining registered objects, borrowing from the sociolinguistic models wherein the concept was first cultivated some additional critical tools related both to register variation and to register formation. Late twentieth-century linguistic criticism, which thus far has been confined primarily to literary studies, provides a model for such an approach. 3 But I would suggest that even if the current terminology and the taxonomies of register theory belong to the field of mid-twentieth-century sociolinguistics, hearing register—whatever we might call it—as a concretization of shared cultural values, categories, and word relations is hardly limited to the twentieth century; neither is the tendency to frame this phenomenon within a theoretical or scientific matrix.\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\nLISTENING\n\n13\n\nBACK\n\nAs a theorized listening practice, the origins of the concept lie in the cultivation and simultaneous intellectual framing of an expressive vernacular literature centuries ago, as reflected especially by Dante's treatise. Such early approaches to sound and syntax still bear implications for analysis and criticism of vernacular cultural products in the twenty-first century. In this instance I am using vernacular only in its most neutral sense, as a thing that is standard or shared, ordinary or everyday, intending no implications of naturalness or ethnological circumscription, pace Dante, whose project included the characterization of languages according to geographical and ethnographic groups based upon each group's way of expressing the simple affirmative \"yes\" (si, oc, oil). Scholars of medieval poetics often preface register with the modifier expressive, thus pointing to the lexical and syntactic arsenal of gambits and gestures that define and encode particular styles or genres and their expected performance, reception, and audience.4 While characteristic word types contribute to the establishment of expressive register in the works under consideration in this book, I extend the literary understanding here, embracing additional phenomenal levels such as vocal and instrumental timbre, harmonic and melodic structures, and, in the case of multimedia, visual images. Expressive registers reflect \"the extreme formalization of tradition.\" 5 They are collections that contain the established landmarks of convention. The idea of poetic register embraces an inherent verticall y : one speaks, for instance, of the high expressive register of the medieval canso versus the low expressive register of the pastorela. Crucially, these poetic (or rhetorical) registers were constructed from sound types; oratory and lyric, whether or not fitted with a musical setting, were for hearing more than reading.6 As \"texts,\" poems were, and still are in some cases, stand-ins for the real thing. This is worth recalling as we set out to \"read\"—as so many late twentieth-century academic titles characterized it—modern musical media. Medieval markers of register include, at the high end, convoluted syntax and abstract or exotic polysyllabic nouns; at the low end, one encounters simple syntax, concrete and mundane nouns, nonsense syllables, and childish words. Dante, who already in the early fourteenth century dealt extensively with the classification and status of words according to their phonemic structure, cited as cases of lowest aesthetic weight the simple infantile bilabials (humanity's Mr-words): for him, the Italian mamma and babbo.7 These resonate, it might be noted, with the low-register bilabials of English-language rock, rhythm and blues, and\n\n14\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\ncountry musics, particularly the conventional expressive vocatives \"mama,\" \"babe,\" and \"baby.\" 8 High register, in contrast, evoked more unusual and even disorienting aural and linguistic strategies.9 The effusive polysyllabism of later psychedelic and progressive rock represented, among other things, a shift in the generic operations of register within rock's communicative systems.10 Rock's expressive registers were under construction from its earliest mass-market phases. A less than classic effort, at least according to the current canon, \"Surfin' Bird,\" by the determinedly low-register 1960s ensemble the Trashmen, took these phonemic strategies to their extreme, essentially ventriloquizing Dante's linguistic position almost seven centuries later. Instructing listeners through the lyrics that \"bird is a word,\" \"Surfin' Bird\" demonstrates the power of the smallest phonemes to invoke register and to capture and hone the ear of pop consumers as the song proceeds to effectively disassemble the components of its own language into nonverbal timbral abstractions. The Trashmen's bilabial fantasy reached as high as the no. 6 position on the Billboard charts in January 1964. Featuring a repetitive (\"bird . . . bird . . . bird\") and eventually stuttering vocal (\"pa-pa-pa-pa-pa . . . ,\" \"mau-mau-mau . . .\") that, it might be argued, presages more recent percussive effects in rap and hip-hop, the song's strategy derived from similar nonsense syllable insets that characterized the earlier California surf music of the influential Jan and Dean. While many of these gestures were no doubt meant to invoke for surfcrazed listeners the phonemes particular to native Hawaiian, it is relevant that Jan and Dean's first trip to the Billboard Top Ten was in 1959, with a love song bearing no coastal references, but full of the same form of bilabial vocalizing on Dante's markers of low register, m and b. The song was titled, appropriately, \"Baby Talk.\" 1 1 Early rock was associated (dangerously, for some) with low-order sexuality and linked to relatively explicit and apparently nonchoreographed, asocial (i.e., infantile) types of dance and bodily motion. From this perspective, Jan and Dean's alliterative and self-consciously infantile vocalizations were intended as sexual incantations that might register beyond any lyrical context. Their theoretical position with respect to the power of rock phonemes was clarified in another hit wherein the duo answered, for the edification of their adolescent male peers, their own musical question, \"Who Put the Bomp in the Bomp-ba-bomp-ba-bomp?\" with \"We were those guys /I hope you realize/we made your baby fall in love with you,\" underscoring the relationship between low-register language formants and the imaginative\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n15\n\nrealm of informal sexual relations. Akin to the nonsense exclamations that mark the registral collections of medieval pastoral—a genre that often deals with the unritualized \"love of peasants\" (as Andreas Capellanus described it in his twelfth-century treatise on courtly love, De amore)—surf music's expressive vocal register was hardly as new as it may have seemed. Poeticians had borrowed register as something approaching a \"scientific\" tool for analysis from the disciplinary arsenal of the sociolinguisticians, and I call upon that model at times but by no means systematically or exclusively throughout this book. The study of register variation in sociolinguistics proceeds from the assumption that \"a communication situation that recurs regularly in a society (in terms of participants, setting, communicative functions, and so forth) will tend over time to develop identifying markers of language structure and language use, different from the language of other communication situations.\" 12 One could imagine a dialect-word forming an item within some special expressive register, but registers are distinct from dialect in general. According to the theory posited in sociolinguistics, \"In dialects we say the same thing in different ways while in registers we say different things in different ways.\" 1 3 Constituents of registers, including special terms and formulas, provide communicative shorthand in some cases; in others, they might serve as markers or signals of the register or might create rapport between conversational participants. For music, to the extent that it may be said to communicate (as in fact it must do in some instances, for example in film scoring), aural collections based on gesture-type, texture, timbre, and more must be added to the phonetic content of texts, if present. Although the concept of language specific to situational context well predates the introduction of the term, register appears to have been coined in the mid-twentieth century by T. B. W. Reid, who already had in mind a wide application, linked to genre and style in writing: \"Among the most generally applicable registers are those of familiar intercourse, of administration (in the widest sense), of religion or ceremonial, and of literature (with various subdivisions).\" 14 There was, in this early phase, a suggestion of verticality with respect to register distinctions. Reid cited J. R. Firth's work of the late 1940s and early 1950s; Firth had referred to situation-appropriate \"levels of diction.\" When he elaborated register theory in the 1960s, M. A. K. Halliday seized upon the musical analogy inherent in the term, further emphasizing its scalar aspect: \"All speakers have at their disposal a continuous scale of patterns and items, from\n\nlé\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nwhich they select for each situation type the appropriate stock of available harmonies in the appropriate key. They speak, in other words, many registers.\"15 More recent linguistic criticism has largely abandoned the vertical-scale metaphor in its understanding of the way registers function in language, particularly in literature, but some vertical scales of distinction are so deeply inscribed in the Western view of literary products that their impact must be acknowledged. Indeed, word register as a function of genre registers implying literary status or rank was already the theoretical frame for Aristotle's Poetics and was transmitted in medieval doctrines of poetry, notably those of John of Garland's thirteenth-century Parisiana poetria (which, following the Virgilian categories established in the Eclogues, Georgics, and Aeneid, speaks of \"words cognate to the subject\"), along with Dante's later De vulgari eloquentia. Rock's conventional registers were occasionally distorted by the introduction of materials—or, \"objects\"—appropriated from a \"higher\" expressive register, typically one associated with the concert hall (in the case of music) or the \"literary\" (in the case of lyrics). These shifts in the tectonic norms of song appear, from the perspective of a two-node scale, to represent a process of \"inversion,\" a simple juxtaposition or substitution involving the high and the low, and for much of the late twentieth century, theorizing inversion was a significant and popular intellectual undertaking. Musicology is familiar with Barthes's theories of inversion and renversement and with Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the \"carnivalesque.\" lé Seemingly hybrid works might also be theorized as \"camp\" objects that seek refuge in the \"hopelessly, and thus safely, dated\" elements of certain period styles, but camp is usually associated more with social typing and group definitions than with analysis of dynamic processes in music and text. 17 In practice, these processes of juxtaposition are various and highly differentiated through expressive nuance; to describe them requires more than an all-inclusive tag. PLAYING WITH\n\nREGISTER\n\nOpening gambits generally provide the locus for the encoding of pop \"genre,\" often through a nonvocal introduction or \"hook\" that triggers in the listener what Leonard Meyer—referring to other musical styles— called the \"internalized probability system.\"18 Significantly, in some cases songs that play with register assert their noncompliance with pop genre codes right off the bat. By not adhering to this standard, these works break the implied contract between song and audience before it\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n17\n\nhas even been signed. 19 This might be effected through suggested or outright borrowings of concert hall music to introduce a song. For instance, characteristic girl-group register is deflected at the opening of the Toys' 1965 \"A Lover's Concerto\" (discussed in chapter 7) by concertizing, pianistic gestures. A more extreme case is Barry Manilow's 1975 hit \"Could It Be Magic,\" which begins with a full performance of Chopin's C-Minor Prelude, which Manilow will use as the basis for a harmonic contrafact structure.20 While Manilow's songs often call attention to his own musicianship, the Chopin citation is not primarily a reference to concert hall practice. In the song's refrain Manilow draws not upon the supposed elevation of the classical-piano register collection from which it is taken but upon what he hears as a vocative quality inherent in the rhetoric of the prelude. Forcing the listener into a specific analysis of Chopin's expressive register he clearly hears as embodied in the work's inflexible rhythmic patterning, Manilow lends orality to an explicitly Svengalian imperative suggested by the music, one strangely at odds with the saccharine romance of the song's verses. The effect is rendered especially vivid by the ultimate abandonment of verse material in the second half of the song in favor of constant reiteration of the refrain's core words (\"come, come, come . . . now, now, now\"), layered upon a harmonically manipulated fragment of the prelude that serves as a quasi-cinematic underscore. Each successive utterance is marked by the typical Manilow bump-up in dynamics and orchestration, but it functions as more than a nightclub gimmick here, for it turns the text into a screenplay that must be realized in the listener's imagination. Structurally, the multimedia impression (dramatic monologue, implicit visual, repetitive yet incrementally expressive musical background) is virtually identical to those of \"real\" cinema, for example the famous threefold farewell embrace scored by Max Steiner for the airport scene of the Bette Davis vehicle Now Voyager (1942), a classic of conventional Hollywood scoring. In the end, the song's coda— a replay of the last bit of the Chopin original—forces the listener to reinterpret the prelude as a vehicle of cinematic potential. In another 1975 Manilow effort, \"I Write the Songs,\" there is no classical-style musical content, but the text borrows from the discourse of oratory and rhetoric, specifically in the song's prosopopoeic climax, \"I am music,\" no more overblown perhaps (in terms of twentieth-century media bombast) than Francesco Landini's identical ploy in the fourteenth-century madrigal \"Musica son,\" today inscribed in the musicological academy's registers as a work of high art and technical prowess.\n\ni8\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nIn some cases musical citations of classical music in rock borrow from the text registers of essay rather than narrative or dramaturgy, and these can be rather clever (appropriate to the essayist's enterprise), featuring provocative text/music play often buried beneath the surface. Rather than emphasizing musical alterity, these essays often underscore the universality of music's expressive registers. Two reinterpretations of the slow movement of Beethoven's Pathétique sonata, Billy Joel's \"This Night\" (1983) and Kiss's \"Great Expectations\" (1976), intersect with Manilow's music-centric perspective in calling attention within the song to musical traditions outside pop genres. Kiss's number opens with a rock orchestration of Beethoven's theme. The text, addressed in part to an imagined female fan, frames the topic as music (in the abstract) by the deliberately reflexive phrase \"our music\" and describes the arousing sight of the guitarist's fingers in motion. In brief, \"Great Expectations\" reconsiders—in rather amusing fashion—the dynamics of all staged musical virtuosity and concert performance. Joel's treatment of the same Beethoven material is even more literal than that of \"Great Expectations,\" although he withholds the melodic quotation until the refrain. But the song is shot through with wordplay linking Beethoven's nineteenth-century practice to that of the selfdescribed \"piano man\" Joel and to the expressive registers of historical doo-wop ballads that the song references. Indeed, the love lyrics at times seem to suggest the solo pianist's relationship with the keyboard; distortions of musical time and imaginative space are effected through the utterance of words that possess meaningful implications outside the conventional subject matter of the song. These include \"ready for romance\" (code word for nineteenth-century repertoire), \"only a slow dance\" (the slow movement, outside the context of the full sonata), and the notion of an expressive historical musical continuum delivered at the end of the Beethovenian refrain music (\"this night can last forever\"). Joel sets up the first citation of the theme when his doo-wop rocker persona admits at the end of the verse that he can no longer \"remember the rules,\" launching the song into a different registral collection from which the melody and harmony of the refrain are borrowed to create an effectively expressive hybrid.\n\nB I R D : W O R D OR S I G N ?\n\nStudies of mass-market media that have been informed by language models draw primarily upon the field of semiotics, often relying on a\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n19\n\npared-down subset of its essential elements, or an unsystematic mix of terms related to imprecise notions of meaning and its indicators. Philip Tagg's analyses regularly spotlight small musical units, often in multimedia contexts, of precisely the sort I use to generate some of the discussions in this book. His characterization of such units as musemes reflects the post-Barthian semiotic framework for his systematic perspective. Tagg's language, accordingly, relies to no small extent on matters related to \"units of meaning,\" connotative codes, \"the indexical quality of much musical discourse.\"21 And meaning is often, in his analyses, essentially \"ideological.\" For Tia DeNora, Tagg's musemes are signs denoting \"emotional significance.\"22 Barthes and Lévi-Strauss provide the background for Royal S. Brown's concept of the mytheme in film music, a term, discussed in his Overtones and Undertones: Reading Film Music, that invokes not merely meaning (in its latter Barthian part) but the broad text belonging to a culture (in its primary, Lévi-Straussian root). 23 Scholars involved above all in film-music criticism continue to privilege music's role as a bearer of \"meaning,\" a formulation that has survived for several decades.24 I would argue that film music, like other vernaculars, is an especially expressive mode of discourse, and— adopting the position of literary register theory—that language-based modes of contemporary critique that neglect the operation of registers inappropriately homogenize their subjects.25 Brown's discussion reveals the tendency in the last two decades of the twentieth century to think of film as a particular sort of textual entity, and the business of film-music scholarship as one linked to explication of music's role in (and as) the text. That position (with appropriately Barthian punctuation) is rendered apparent in Brown's first chapter title: Narrative/Film/Music.26 Our widespread acceptance today of film's implicit narrativity, and thus of all \"-emes\" as constituents of textual systems, may be credited above all to the enormous influence of Claudia Gorbman on this corner of musicological practice. Her Unheard Melodies not only encouraged the application of \"meaning\" to the hearing of filmmusic \"texts\" but placed meaning within a specifically narrative and more precisely narratological context at a time when narratology was upon the minds of many scholars interested in musicodramatic forms. Had it not been for Gorbman, and her highly accomplished application of Gérard Genette's theories of narrative to film sound, would so many writers still relish exploring the tensions and ambiguities related to the presence of \"diegetic\" and \"nondiegetic\" music in a single multimedia work? 27 Genette's systematic narratological perspective on texts—on dialogue\n\n20\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nversus reportage, on narrative voice—remains, via Gorbman, a guide to the overhearing of the off- and on-screen conversations, mechanical music, voice-overs, sound effects, and orchestrations that make up film's complex soundscape, everything that contributes to, in Rick Altman's intelligent coinage, the filmic mise-en-bande.28 There is nothing wrong, of course, with using diegetic and nondiegetic as pretty, slightly more nuanced substitutes for the old \"source\" versus \"background\" music distinction. Once implicated in the landscape of a theoretical discourse of film music, however, they limit the range of potential approaches to multimedia objects. The point may be illustrated by comparison with the discourse of film in general. Shots are fundamental to the language of film visuals; low- and high-angle shots especially can transmit understandings to the audience that are unavailable to the characters in the so-called narrative. These cannot \"see\" the perspectivally skewed images any more than they can \"hear\" the nondiegetic (i.e., background) musical content. Yet few will find it useful or appropriate to found much film analysis upon the division of the visual track into diegetic versus nondiegetic components. Understanding film music as a parallel narrative tracking a novelistic text seems to be based mainly on the popularity in the last quarter of the twentieth century of the notion that all music narrates (or might narrate), a position that is hardly central to most understandings of cinema's image track. Our shyness as scholars or our difficulties as viewers in approaching films abstractly is by no means attributable entirely to the narratologists. Early twentieth-century kinotheks (libraries of \"silent\" movie film music), like that of Erdmann discussed below, attached meaning to film accompaniments (an early musical hermeneutics). This meaning was thought of as tracking a film's dramaturgical structure. We have substituted for that stage-based perspective a more novelistic one. Consider, for example, two analyses of the meaningful aspects of Steiner's 1942 score for Now, Voyager. At the time of the film's release it was reviewed in terms that suggest not merely its classic elements but their relationship to the dramatic trajectory of the film: \"Once again Max Steiner assists mood and dramatic intent by giving this picture a symphonic musical background of impressive strength. The love poem filtering through the superb action is a symphonic tone poem of great beauty, stressing a great spiritual quality. The ratio between dialogue and music and action is well defined at all times, yet music is an important dramatic element, eloquently supporting description, emotion, action, mood and pace. The work is heavily orchestrated in keeping with the\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n21\n\nweight of the story, varying in range to contrast with the production structure.\" 2 9 T h e reviewer—clearly a Steiner a p o l o g i s t — h e a r d the music dramaturgically, although he does invoke the term \" s t o r y \" in a general rather than linear sense. In her annotated leitmotivic catalog of the film, K a t e Daubney seems to hear pretty much the same thing but reveals the influence of G o r b m a n ' s model for the apprehension of musical meaning: From the opening of the film, with its bold orchestral statement, to the quotation of popular hits of the day, the score for Now, Voyager relishes the power of music to be expressive. Steiner has seized the opportunity to create a score which, though largely non-diegetic, emphasizes our experience of the characters from points of view both within and outside the narrative space. Where the diegetic choices for the cruise ship cocktail bar, the party, the cafe near Cascade and the Vale mansion evoke quite particular atmospheres and contexts for the action, the non-diegetic score seems to traverse and transcend the narrative boundaries that can make a post-production score seem objective and wise after the event.30 We might, though, approach Steiner's music and its expressive operations by w a y of its particular registers. This would place much of the score, I would argue, in that of the \"Puccinian-operatic.\" 3 1 1 will address this characterization in its specifics in the next chapter, but simply put, the orchestral background score is—despite the on- and off-screen intrusions of Chaikovsky's Sixth Symphony—unambiguously vocal in its expressive gestures, and these gestures embody a form of musical expression that in the nineteenth century was mimetically linked to certain forms of conversational expressive gesture (particularly with respect to dynamic range and the phrasal caesuras that imitate natural, high-emotion respiratory events). M y point is to suggest not a wholesale replacement for the language of conventional film-music criticism (journalistic or academic) but only that a slightly different approach to scoring \" l a n g u a g e \" might supplement our currently rather narrow and inflexible range of discursive options. In assigning meaning to a musical bit, writers tend to emphasize the significance of the link to an object's original associated text (literary, musical, social). Steiner's Puccinianism, conventionally addressed, would more likely be taken exclusively as miming Puccini rather than as a mimetic realization in music of the expressive potential of most Western languages, something that any attentive Western listener might hear in Puccini's music. Missing in these analytical positions is much accommodation for the scale of expressive performance involved in the real iteration of such musicolinguistic \" s i g n s . \" 3 2\n\n2.2.\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nEven before Dante, Occitan poetics—and Occitan was the first language for \"composed\" vernacular song in the West, the one Dante looked to as his model for the new Italian—emphasized that each vernacular genre demanded a particular mode of expressive performance, a special vocal and perhaps gestural demeanor. These prescriptions offer a glimpse into the expressive component of registral collections. They are part of a continuum of practice that survives in twentieth-century vernacular lyric genres. Emotive and motive elements appropriate to establishing expressive register in a blues performance differ from the laidback, expressively flat vocalizations that characterize and regístrate most surf song. However impressive the chronological gulf between the premodern and modern repertorial nodes I am citing, more impressive are their points of conceptual intersection: lyrics composed with an eye toward live and—within certain registral limits—individually flexible performances and geared toward reception based on aurality rather than an inscribed text. In film music the score's performers are physically absent but their expressive gestures resound. One advantage of defining registers, especially for something like film music, which is usually historicized as a single continuous strand, is that doing so provides conceptual spaces in which signifiers or markers are understood to be alive and in flux. Register theory invites diachronic exploration of \"the life of signs.\" Beyond this, by locating conventions in registral systems that may be shuffled in any number of ways to create meaningful loci of intersection (as in a linguistic topography constituted of movable Venn diagrammatic circles, with each circle representing a register), we may expose and account for differences in implication that have been attached by vernacular listeners to objects that look or sound nearly identical. I would hardly argue for a \"system\" of registers, a sociolinguistic grid against which all vernacular cultural products may be placed and interpreted or through which we might arrive at understandings somehow imbued with the scientific spirit of sociolinguisticians. I have introduced the subject primarily to foreground the importance of acoustical-phonological formants in musical communication, and to underscore the potentially transitory aspects of the conventional meanings attached to the signs that make up living systems of discourse. Strategies for cultural critique that emerged in the last third of the twentieth century located critical interest primarily in moments of rupture, or in structural relations of inversion or reversal. As I have suggested, these descend in many cases from the principles of structural linguistics and semiotics, and they must necessarily direct their focus\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n23\n\ntoward the original or intentional content of the constituent parts of cultural objects, with such content offering meaningful positions on criticalrelational maps. Register, while it may be silently implicated in such analyses, is taken as a function of a \"dead\" language (or a multiplicity of dead languages), in which word values (or image values or sound values) and cultural content are fixed. Postmodern bricolage or pastiche is often read against such values, which are normally located on a vertical scale in standard evaluative systems. If register is primarily a vernacular shorthand, the deciphering of which proceeds from a shared cultural or linguistic understanding, then it must be considered at least as much, perhaps more, a feature of the act of reception as one of authorship, intention, or performance. By focusing on this fluid aspect of register, and by locating its field of operation within standard cultural discourse, we can largely avoid invoking the cumbersome bipolar signifiers that demark and deaden the meaningful or live-ly critique of mixed-register, pastiche, or middlebrow works and genres.33 Bipolarity has been a particularly dominant aspect of conversation and criticism regarding mass-market, mass-media productions; its constructions may be academic, journalistic, or anecdotal and may include, in addition to high versus low, the old music-appreciation standard art versus popular, along with new markers and their associated positions. Steven Feld's catalog adds, \"'inside' versus 'outside,' 'elite' versus 'vernacular,' . . . 'progressive' versus 'mainstream,' and 'hegemonic' versus 'counterhegemonic.'\" 34 Since standard language is in a process of constant transformation, locating all registers in the zone of common practice, or at least close enough to it so that intersections can be charted, permits readings that take into account the diachronic dimension of register formation, along with the potential for reregistrations, like those considered in chapter 2. 35 T H E P A R T Y OF T H E F I R S T PART\n\nFilm music—particularly for mass-market studio productions—is a mass-media discursive arena in which shorthand communication is key. Music for movies must communicate something to justify its eternally tenuous position in the eyes or ears of both the producers and consumers of film; it must accomplish this quickly, even instantaneously. In film, the range—subjective and objective—of communications is broad; mainstream filmic discourse is primarily novelistic, albeit abbreviated and telegraphic. With respect to the score, this leaves much of the burden of the\n\n2\n\n4\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nact of musical communication to the audience, who must decipher the language of the composer. How, then, does music that either reproduces or imitates the sounds of the Western concert hall canon communicate to a noninitiated listener? First, I would emphasize that by drawing upon registered elements that were collected or deposited in the arsenal of vernacular listening over time, film music, and by extension all \"cinematic\" musics, are ultimately heard in the vernacular.36 Few American filmgoers, for example, would be able extemporaneously to quote the text of an entire legal contract, but almost all recognize the registral connotations of the phrase \"the party of the first part.\" Had that phrase not found its way into the register of \"legalese\" in common practice, the vaudevillian set piece enacted by Groucho and Chico Marx in A Night at the Opera as they argue over the percentages due the agent in an artistrepresentation contract would be neither funny nor brilliant. Musical parameters that lend themselves to registration are those that are most easily transformed on the fly into visual images (i.e., contour and trajectory) or those most easily sensed as significant in a linguistic sense. If my own language here and above appears to teeter dangerously close to the brink of declaring, more naively than the author cited in my introduction, that music might constitute a language, this is hardly my intention. We might better say that language, in its components, is very much like music. Some acts of nonanalytical or nonstructural hearing, though certainly not all, correlate with the interpretative acts of linguistic hearing.37 Timbre and attack are the primary acoustical correlates to the phonemes of the poetician. Dynamics and isolated pitch values need no translation; they work the same way in speech as in music, at least for the cinematic listener.38 Often, it seems, even a \"noncompetent\" listener can hear unfamiliar music in precisely the way it was intended, or in the same way—with respect to its communicative, if not its technical, elements—as a trained musician.39 Reuven Tsur suggests that there is a physiological basis for the human capacity literally to feel the textural or volumic implications of timbre.40 Tsur's emphasis on the phonological dimension of poetics, and his notion that musical tone color is experientially correlative with aspects of the letter sounds of spoken texts, suggests that these factors may participate in the registration of phonological and acoustical content in the reception of music with or without text. These are precisely the elements that, by their immediacy of perception and their potential applicability to a range of registers simultaneously, point to a weakness in the assignment of \"meaning\" to the traditional film score. Timbre or tone color, for example, is such a powerful\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n2-5\n\nsignal in acoustical communication that it may outweigh other musical nuances and lead not to misreadings but, more to the point, to false registrations based on recalled experience. An example is provided by Frank Nugent's review in the New York Times (February 1 7 , 1940) of Lewis Milestone's film version of Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. Nugent mentions Aaron Copland's score just once: \"We noted but one flaw in Mr. Milestone's direction: his refusal to hush the off-screen musicians when Candy's old dog was being taken outside to be shot. A metronome, anything, would have been better than modified 'Hearts and Flowers.'\" Both Copland and his friend Paul Bowles responded in the next issue of Modern Music.41 Enumerating the \"three important ways in which music helps a picture\" (intensifying emotional impact of a scene, continuity, and \"neutral\" backgrounding of dialogue), Copland characterized the first as \"no more than the Hearts and Flowers tradition, but still, perfectly legitimate.\"42 Bowles was more direct. Suggesting that the critic \"objected to the idea of using music at all to foster emotion for such a patently sentimental episode,\" he pointed out that \"it is quite obvious, even to the layman, if he listens to Copland's score, that there is not the slightest musical connection between the blatancy of that old tune and the sensitive music for this scene.\"43 Nugent's review applauds the authenticity of Steinbeck's vision and its realization in the film: \"As in 'The Grapes of Wrath,'\" he wrote, \"we have the feeling of seeing another third, or thirtieth, of the nation, not merely a troupe of play-actors living in a world of make-believe.\" He perhaps felt that the particularly harsh realism of this particular scene, rather than its sentimental flavor, was, in an already heavily realist diegetic environment, overly mitigated by the presence of a music cue. In any case, what he heard was the legato string subject, as well as the egregiously filmic sound engineering applied to the dynamic level of the background score (instantaneous and unnatural fades) to accommodate the few, halting moments of conversation in the bunkhouse. To make matters worse, the scene ends with an equally conventional \"expressive\" increase in dynamic level, a musicodramaturgical stinger employed once there is no chance of its interfering with dialogue or other diegetic sounds. What he missed, though, was not only the unusual intervallic and rhythmic features of the string material but, more important, the affective (\"poignant,\" according to Bowles) interruptions by the solo, monotone flute. Copland's flute marks, like an involuntary intake of breath (neither a sentimental sob nor a melodramatic gasp), the temporal units of that excruciating delay during which we, breathless listeners, await the horrid\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\n26\n\nbut inevitable sound of the diegetic gunshot. It aurally embodies in a temporally collapsed span the inexpressible and immeasurable aloneness of Candy who, as soon as the dog has been led outside, finds himself for the first time without the companion through whom his own existence was defined and signified. Yet the sound of a flute, for the nonspecialist listener, is simply not, as an aural object, textural or tactile enough to compensate for the connotations of the conventional orchestral \"presence\" and its registral implications, which are those not literally of \"Hearts and Flowers\" but of the lyric, symphonic expression, grounded in late nineteenth-century concert repertoire, of high, and most often romantic, emotional utterance. CLASSIC'S\n\nREGISTERS\n\nWithin the nested matrices of vernacular registers, then, in which some are more inclusive, and some more specialized, we might position a register bearing the label \"classic.\" \"Classic register,\" while it may include any number of items literally borrowed from concert hall musics, is not a Bartlett's for musicians. Classic register, as I conceive of it, is specifically a region within normative cultural discourse. I will employ this construction without attempting to provide it with a simple definition—for it is too broad and in too constant a state of live flux to admit fixing. In vernacular contexts, the terms or objects of the classic collection will tend to be registrated as such on the basis of mnemosynic or metonymic apprehension, or both. This is to say that a speaker (I am pressing the linguistic model here; I mean, of course, a song or a film sound track) drawing upon this register will trigger a recognition response that tends to proceed from the listener's experience (memory) on one hand, or from an intuition that beyond what has been heard, its phenomenal portion, lies a greater whole, with \"greater\" intended in the dimensional rather than the evaluative sense. Among those \"musicolinguistic\" possibilities embraced by the classic register is a special register, that of \"the classic\" per se. In mass-market musical discourse, \"the classic,\" or \"the register of the classic,\" possesses a special flavor; it is often associated with the invocation of death and the dead on the one hand, and reanimation on the other.44 By this I refer not merely to a condition of pastness, of being dead, but to the state of being monumentally dead, or in a monumental state of being dead, emphasizing monumentality to call attention to the architectural implications of invoking the register. Such architectures may be meta-\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n27\n\nphorical (i.e., formal) or actual (i.e., plastic or sculptural). Monumentally in this sense plays a part in some of the territory I shall explore later in this book. Emphasizing the notion of a register of the classic, as well as the generality of the classic register, frees both from any enforced participation in the Western cultural tradition of the classic, which typically has stressed the deathless aspects of the aesthetic objects so identified, although this by no means excludes that tradition from inclusion in vernacular communication structures. Some of the classics of the twentieth century have been elevated, to whatever ends, by critical or, more often, commercial forces that have sought to locate them outside the streams of societal or artistic flux (\"classic rock,\" \"a classic car\"). That positioning is crucial. The classic in any case will be framed and discrete. It may be borrowed, with its outsidedness intact, for vernacular use. An analogy from standard language would be the situation in which, locked in a face-to-face stalemate with a pedestrian walking from the direction in which one is heading, an English speaker recites, \"Après vous Alphonse.\" Items situated in \"the classic register\" of the vernacular, by contrast, have been integrated and absorbed, as in the construction \"... du jour,\" which will be encountered in a range of written or spoken circumstances, invoking any number of intersecting vernacular registers, including \"turnpike diner-menu register,\" \"authentic bistro chalkboard register,\" or \"academic in-joke register,\" each of which contains special, register-specific features, while sharing this linguistic formula in common as part of the register collection. As I have suggested, the typical implications of wearing the brand of the classic are those of longevity, incorruptibility, or universal value. Sainte-Beuve held such a view of Virgil in the middle of the nineteenth century, in an essay whose title is cited at the beginning of many subsequent discussions of the question (\"Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?\"), in which forum he opened the term up for the first time (although Dante had hinted at something similar centuries before in his De vulgari eloquentia), allowing that the word \"classic\" might embrace literature of any epoch, if so judged by men who have reached the stage of \"maturity\": \"It is at this age that the word classic takes on its true meaning and defines itself for every man of taste by the irresistible predilection of his choice . . . whether it be Horace or someone very different, whatever favorite author gives us back our own thoughts ripened and enriched, we shall then seek from one of those fine old spirits an unfailing intercourse, a friendship that never declines and cannot fail us.\" 45 T. S. Eliot's 1944\n\n28\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nessay, bearing the same title, begins with Sainte-Beuve (and Frank Kermode's The Classic with both).46 Sainte-Beuve's flexibility, as well as his having chosen a metaphor related to alimentary consumption (specifically, the improvement and appreciation over time of fine potables like brandy and cognac), would eventually permit the word to encompass such pantry items as Classic Coke and Johnson's Saran Wrap Classic, those \"fine old spirits\" singled out among mounds of competitors and multiflavored or multicolored variations. The latter, interestingly, was abandoned shortly after its introduction at the turn of the millennium when—with technologically linked Y 2 K anxieties momentarily stilled—the product was renamed Saran Wrap Original, in keeping with its traditional position as a technoutopian alternative to its nonclinging ancestor, Reynolds's Cut-Rite Wax Paper. Wax paper, most appropriately, turned to the classic tag in the early years of the twenty-first century in a different sense, one we encounter in other popular media constructions. Recognizing that its target audience fit Sainte-Beuve's circumscription of the category as one appropriate to the realm of the \"mature,\" the new design played upon the product's capacity to trigger in that group a sentimental, perhaps morbidly Romantic reminiscence of generations past and passed, emblazoning their new box with the nonsensical heading \" A Kitchen Classic for Over 75 Years.\" Thus, it seems wax paper was classic from birth, a view Eliot held regarding his own poetry. Sainte-Beuve maintained, as did Eliot, the position of Virgil at the top of the heap. And so, when Eliot describes the classic as possessing elements of commonality, comprehensiveness, maturity, and universality, he draws that model from his understanding of Virgil, simultaneously laying the groundwork for reception of his own work. 47 Regardless of the name Eliot gave it, Virgil's \"common language\" is elite, not vernacular. The classic, that is, the \"absolute\" (in contradistinction to the \"relative\") classic, as Eliot put it, remains, as I have suggested of items in the register of the classic, outside the practice of vernacular language and experience. One may aspire to it, and one may invoke it, but one may not act upon it. Eliot's imperialist absolutism on this issue was no doubt the object of Groucho Marx's jibe in a letter of 1963, written during a period of correspondence between the two men that eventually led to dinner at Eliot's home in London in 1964. Groucho, who was somewhat familiar with literary criticism as well as literature, wrote: \"I have just finished my latest opus, 'Memoirs of a Mangy Lover.' Most of it is autobiographical and very little of it is fiction. I doubt whether it will live\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n29\n\nthrough the ages, but if you are in a sexy mood the night you read it, it may stimulate you.\" 48 Yet Eliot did acknowledge the possibility for intuitive reception of something outside the realm of one's personal experience, something bearing aesthetic weight and absolute value, although the direct communicative power he had in mind was not necessarily that attached to the classic. It does approach, however, my concept of the metonymic apprehension of the classic register in musical products by listeners who are not necessarily familiar with its referential aspects through personal experience. Addressing the British-Norwegian Institute in 1943, Eliot described having found \"sometimes that a piece of poetry, which I could not translate, containing many words unfamiliar to me, and sentences which I could not construe, conveyed something immediate and vivid, which was unique, different from anything in English—something which I could not put into words and yet felt that I understood. And on learning that language better I found that this impression was not an illusion, not something which I had imagined to be in the poetry, but something that was really there.\"49 Eliot's experience of unfamiliar poetry (Norwegian or otherwise) was, it would seem, a response to register as it resides in phonological, rather than significative, content. There is no need to rehearse the extent to which fragments of concert hall and opera house music—\"real\" classics—constituted much of the treasury of film-music vocabulary in the days of the kinothek pastiche scores attached to silent movies in the first decades of the twentieth century. 50 But less has been said, from a theoretical perspective, regarding the reception end of the multimedia equation in these \"primitive\" citation-patchwork scores. A tentative step, however naive by today's standards, was undertaken in an extraordinary two-volume Allgemeines Handbuch der Film-Musik, produced in 1927 by Hans Erdmann, with the assistance of the film-music composer Giuseppe Becce, which offered students of the subject a theoretical framework for the enterprise that emphasized the hermeneutic elements of film-music practice.51 Erdmann engaged with the film-music problem head on, insisting that the increasing demand for film music on a daily basis required the establishment of a hermeneutic foundation for the practice. He achieved this by way of a registral edifice of monumental proportion, rather in the spirit of Friedrich Ludwig's musicological monster the Repertorium.52 Erdmann's first volume is devoted to his wide-ranging and learned general essay, and to instructions for use of the second, Thematisches Skalenregister, a library of musical examples surrounded by elaborate\n\n3°\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nsystematic notes and symbols. Presented in regular type with Friedrich Ludwigian small-font glosses running concurrently along the outer edges of every page, the approach—users are told—is based on a sort of \"musikalische 'Hermeneutik'\" that puts into words the principles of musical expression fundamental to the practice of film accompaniment. The musikwissenschaftlickes format of the book notwithstanding (indeed, the copy I consulted contained an autograph inscription from the author to Otto Kinkeldey), Erdmann warned that his was not a precise or complete \"scientific system.\" 53 Clearly, though, it was an attempt to systematize for the sake of professional pedagogy the communicative act between composer and audience, based on a hermeneutic system of register variation. Musical excerpts in the second volume are taxonomically classified according to subjective qualities (passionate, melancholy, religious, etc.), dramaturgical function (music for dramatic climaxes, low points, etc.), musical elements (mainly expressive markings familiar to most keyboard players, such as lyrisch, ruhig, ruhig beivegt, etc.), and markers not unlike those of early linguistic register theory (e.g., music appropriate to a religious setting, a scene of royalty, etc.); most of these elements are indicated by a graphical system of letters and geometric shapes, the tome's most charming, and bizarre, feature. Critiques of Erdmann's creative model (essentially a scholastic summa of existing practice) were, and continue to be, inspired by the tenuous status of two canons, one of which was undergoing a process of Osirislike dismemberment and another that was being generated from the parts of the first. The classics, so named, had been subjected to the hatchet jobs of theater musician-recomposers, while the film score was aspiring to a location among the genre fields constituting the classic domain. Louis Silvers, in the kinothek-style score for The Jazz Singer plays with Chaikovsky in the classic register, operating within the standard hermeneutic system of 1920s movie music, and commits, the critics would maintain, an aesthetic violation. Max Steiner's invocation of Chaikovsky in the register of the classic in Now, Voyager (the citation is introduced by an on-screen orchestra in a concert hall) was something else: an inset within Steiner's continuous, \"original\" film score. At either end of this musical Osiris myth lay the integrated body of the canonized art work, framed by the doctrines of high-art genre, most especially those linked to creative, rather than receptive, authority.54\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n31\n\nT H E M U S I C A L H U M A N I S M OF M I C H A E L J A C K S O N\n\nWhen in the second century Aulus Gellius propounded the notion of the classic, his selective approach was no less slapdash than that of the modern executives hawking \"classic\" paper products. The classic was from its inception a grab-bag miscellany of items whose value was (perhaps) literary and linked to specific linguistic turns but also judged by its value to move a reader in an ethical direction, in other words toward a life well lived. Ethical resonance in the apprehension of the classic will be considered further in another chapter. For now I would emphasize that the classic's origins lie in the notion of citational pastiche, precisely the aspect of quotation \"outside the hall\" or—recalling Julian Johnson's implicit criteria—outside the grammatical, formal aspects of the systematic whole of a work. Gellius's classic possessed the features that now move musical and social critics to target especially vernacular music's aesthetic insignificance, inauthenticity, and commodified or culturally retrogressive posturing. As Leofranc Holford-Strevens put it, \"who are we to throw stones\" at Gellius or his enterprise? Gellius gathered bits of material he deemed appropriate for his Noctes Atticae (Attic Nights), a haute-bourgeois florilegium that was—in the words of another scholar— a \"Reader's Digest of antiquity.\" 55 Gellius's classicus was sewn together from fragments meant to inspire, through an abundance of worthy sententiae (the quotational stuff that came to enliven much of later medieval rhetoric), new confrontations with the past and the sound of its messages, sometimes flavored by atypical words or syntactical forms. Gellius did more than define a new sense of the word; he laid the foundation for what would be known as \"humanistic\" study, and he understood, before Sainte-Beuve or Eliot, that exposure to the right fragments might render a citizen \"better.\" If the classic has been defined in no small way by hinting at some inherently ethical quality, the question will arise at each invocation: whose classic and whose ethics? Contemplation of the eternal scope of the issue is enriched by remarks recorded in Julie Shaw's now notorious 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson. In pointing out the amusements of his Neverland estate to interviewer Martin Bashir, Jackson described the music he programs for his carousel, explaining that he preferred the ride to be accompanied by \"classical music\" and citing by way of exempla several familiar standards, including \"Childhood,\" \"Smile,\" and, in his words, \"'People' by Barbra Streisand.\" As an act of hearing classic implications this might seem even more inscrutable than Eliot's appreciation of Norwegian poetry. All of\n\n32\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nJackson's selections are movie theme songs and thus drawn from the twentieth-century's main repository of classic bits, but they are hardly of the kind patched together in early kinothek practice. The first, his own song from Free Willy z, suggests an aesthetic position close to Eliot's in a creative sense: the notion that a classic aesthetics might be defined by the practice of one's own work. \"Smile\" is the song David Raksin elaborated upon Charles Chaplin's tune for Modern Times, and Jule Styne's \"People\" is from Funny Girl. In the concert hall of the conventional musical museum, the classical style—that of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven—was, according to Charles Rosen, marked especially by a group integrity, and so Jackson's elevation of the repertoire for his merry-go-round lies perhaps not so far away from E. T. A. Hoffmann's evaluation of the conventional triumvirate (even if he called Mozart and Haydn \"romantics\") cited by Rosen in the opening paragraphs of The Classical Style.56 For Jackson's classical repertoire, that integrity, it seems, lies first in the sermonistic or aphoristic elements of a song, particularly as expressed in its lyrics (in terms medieval rhetoric would borrow from Gellius's notion of the classic, its moral sententiae). In this, his position is fundamentally Gellian: he hears song as an expression of an ethical position, however rudimentary. Moreover, all three of his merry-go-round tunes share a certain acoustical profile in their standard realizations. Jackson's remarks suggest that being classical is largely a matter of reception, but even here his \"classical\" music shares certain aural markers of register we have encountered before. A close analysis of \"Childhood\" and \"People\" reveals that Jackson has reiterated many significant gestures (melodic, harmonic, lyric) in his own song for Free Willy 2, not the least of which is the high registral placement—in the ordinary musical sense of \"register\"—of the word \"people.\" But more significant for register in the linguistic sense is the acoustical environment produced by Jackson's choice of vocal timbre (as close to Streisand as any male singer is likely to get) and the arrangement that relies on symphonic strings supplemented by a concertizing piano, eschewing big concerto-style chords (a register marker found throughout hybrid vernacular musics), however, in favor of a lyrical expressiveness characteristic of concerto slow movements. Streisand's performances of \"People\" were also usually embedded in a wash of strings, and the original Broadway score in fact intertwines with that a discreetly concertizing piano. If Jackson's own performance of \"Smile\" (included with his \"Childhood\") on the HIStory album is less conventionally classical in its acoustical wash, this is mitigated by the fact that the song's regis-\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n33\n\nter was securely established long before, when it was appropriated by Liberace as a signature tune. When Liberace performed the Chaplin number on his television show in 1 9 5 6 , his classical-style pianistic virtuosity was supplemented by the sudden appearance halfway through the song of a strolling violinist (his brother, George), thus filling out, in abbreviated form, the timbral environment expected in \"concerto register.\" The song's lyrics, of course, are aphoristic and didactic; a classical utterance that Gellius himself might have recognized. Visually, Liberace's performance provides a remarkable snapshot of media's claim to transmission of the classic and its related registers, marking the song as a literal classic while underscoring the freshness of its mediated presentation: the pianist's trademark candelabra is fitted with safe and efficient electric bulbs while behind him rests the blank, expectant screen of a television upon which sits an Emmy award, testifying to Liberace's rank as a new kind of laureate. \"Smile\" was sufficiently registrated through decades of media awareness and televisual reiteration that Jackson could take liberties with his arrangement without fear of sacrificing the song's access to the expressive register of the classic.\n\nR A P P I N G UP R E G I S T E R\n\nEmbedded musical entities may signal the classic register regardless of their original intention or context (i.e., they needn't be literally classical in the conventional sense) so long as the material operates within or projects the communicative parameters of the register, as witnessed by Jackson's position and by Frank Nugent's \"Romantic\" hearing of Copland mentioned earlier. Since the advent of digital sampling, subversion and shuffling of registral expectations has metamorphosed into one of the fundamental creative options in vernacular music genres. Choice of material and its expressive registers can be manipulated with increasing flexibility and acoustical effectiveness. Some examples drawn from a particular corner of the \" n e w \" museum of late twentieth-century historical reception—the field of rap and hiphop sampling—reveal two strands of \"rapport-response\" situations such registrations may initiate. 57 For rap musicians, sampling involves a relationship with the source that is intentionally \"meaningful\" and often respectful: most practitioners of digital sampling are serious \"collectors.\" In any case, the spectrum of potential relationships between original and borrowed sound is extensive. 58 From a wide range of possibilities, two\n\n34\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\nhelp to illuminate an important distinction between the classic register, generaliter dictum (i.e., in the general sense as medieval word theory might have it) and the register of the classic, specialiter dictum (in the specific sense). \"What's My Name,\" by D M X , and \"Gimme Some More,\" by Busta Rhymes, both successful products that circulated just prior to the turn of the twenty-first century, commence with introductory samples that \"classicize\" the sound environment and emphasize their own remoteness from the sound world of the main rap. This is mainly accomplished through the presentation of registrated timbres. In fact, for \"noncompetent\" listeners (those who do not \"recall\" the original source of the sample), acoustical color provides the only registral marker. In each case the introductory sample will reappear as part of the number's long-term form. They follow dramatically different functional paths, though, each revealing the operational dynamics of a new cultural product, in which the nature of the sample's registration as intended and presumably received prefigures the shape and reception of the rap as a whole. Neither sample originated as what might be termed, in general parlance, a piece of classical music, but the first considered here, Richard Addinsell's Warsaw Concerto, is a sort of liminal classic residing since its introduction in the mid-1940s on the borderline between the popular imagination and \"authentic\" concert hall consumption. The second is borrowed from one of the most lauded Hollywood film scores, Bernard Herrmann's music for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. In rap, the opening sample often serves a psychological and aesthetic goal parallel to that of title music in the cinema. Sometimes characterized as \"mythic\" or \"spectacular\" (i.e., linked to the historical tradition of \"spectacle\"), film title music does (or at least did, prior to the subversion of opening title conventions in the last decades of the twentieth century) provide the accommodative imaginary space in which a viewerauditor recalculates the relationship between \"real\" sensory input and the interior envisioning required for successful reception of a filmic environment.59 Raps are, for the most part, intentionally cinematic.60 Indeed, a cinematic aspect, in which music promotes novelistic constructions in the listening imagination through reference to multiple registers, became the norm for popular music forms beginning in the second half of the 1960s, prior to which time pop and rock songs ordinarily projected a single register and a unitary affect. Introductory samples can invoke the same registers as film scores; some are even, as I've indicated, borrowed from the film-music repertory. While the mainly original portion of the work—the rap and its accompaniment—is, musically speak-\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n35\n\ning, mainly about movement and beat, the listener's body is held at bay in the kind of sample-intro construction encountered in these w o r k s , akin to the straitjacket of a concert hall seat, until the drum-kick and the bass slip in. 6 1 In this, rap rehearses an experience that might have been savored by European listeners to\n\nfifteenth-century\n\npolyphonic structures in w h i c h\n\nthe familiar, grounded, and grounding material of a tenor cantus firmus w a s characteristically withheld f r o m the listener's ear for an indefinite period of two-voice \" f r e e \" compositional fantasy, during w h i c h expectations and envisionings were the only psychological and aesthetic possibilities. A m o n g these anticipations is that of the m o m e n t w h e n the tenor drops, to lend a palpable weight to the soundscape. Prior to the bass drop in rap, the sample is essentially \" b a c k g r o u n d \" music with no foreground (remember M a n i l o w ' s introductory performance of the C h o p i n prelude). Yet it possesses the impetus, the potential, to lay a foundation for and set in motion the envisioned diegetic w o r l d against w h i c h the text and rhythms of the rap will be projected. Such samples can, at this point, only be registered in an absolute context, outside the range of the still unencountered w o r k \"itself.\" \" W h a t ' s M y N a m e \" confronts the listener immediately w i t h an excised bit of piano music implicitly framed by aural quotation marks. In popular media of the mid- to late twentieth century, the manifestation of nonintegrated piano sound w a s often associated w i t h the registers of the heroic or the demonic. Its first utterance here is disfigured by an editing \" c u t \" that effects a double amputation. D M X ' s source, the first bars of the Warsaw Concerto,\n\nw a s firmly fixed in the register of the heroic at\n\nthe time of its composition, but especially because of its decontextualized status in the song and in the realm of rap effects in general it takes on the darker aspects of a \"severed hand,\" a horror-genre topos encountered more than once in this b o o k . 6 2 T h e piano's timbre seems unnaturally sharp and dry against the background of the dark, smooth outlines of the bass sounds w h e n they enter, further emphasizing its resonance in a dimension outside that of the real or the mundane. 6 3 O n e of the most enduring fetishes shared by artistic and anthropological cultural practice, the severed-hand topos w a s fully inscribed in aesthetic literary products by the nineteenth century (e.g., in w o r k s of E. T . A . H o f f m a n n and Gérard de Nerval) and in H o l l y w o o d by the mid-193os (e.g., Mad Love and later The Beast with Five\n\nFingers).64\n\nD M X ' s musical soundscapes, according to Rolling Stone magazine, were imbued with precisely such an atmosphere. T h e y are described, through\n\n36\n\nRegistering the Classic\n\na chain of timbral-sensory analogies, as \"skeletal, drawing on the brittle sounds of dance-hall reggae, the pulse of old-school hip-hop and ominous keyboard swells that resemble horror-movie scores.\"65 DMX's musical poetics here are clear: by selecting from the register of the classic an item that bears resonances in its own and other repertoires that are both oratorical and annunciatory (i.e., the standard big-chord piano concerto opening), he capitalizes upon its high expressive value potential. This stands in marked difference to other forms of \"theosophical\" rap that represent death in homelier or more sentimental fashion.66 In \"What's My Name\" a kind of prophesying is set in motion by the piano's voice, conjured, whether from the grave or the realm of the divine, and authorized by precisely the aspect of \"classic\" technique, in this case the pianistic \"power chord\" that, two generations before, allowed the film Dangerous Moonlight to sell the short, one-movement work as both an act of musical heroism and a spécial aesthetic object: a concerto. The \"imaginary\" power of the chords, in registering Addinsell's work and others like it, cannot be underestimated, and I explore this power further in chapter 7. One would be hard-pressed to distinguish the melodic substance of the opening material of Addinsell's composition and the main theme, composed by Bronislau Kaper for Victor Saville's film Green Dolphin Street (1947), were it not for the invocation of concerto register as understood by mainstream consumers in the piano chord flourish of the former. 67 No surprise that Kaper would turn to that model for Saville's adventure. Kaper was a pianist himself, born in Warsaw. Conservatory-trained in Berlin, he left Nazi Germany for Paris in the early 1930s. A1 Tinney's performance of \"Green Dolphin Street,\" a melody that has become a jazz standard, exploits the aural confusion between the two works. Tinney begins the song not with the \"Green Dolphin Street\" tune but with the first section of the Addinsell.68 As the rap proceeds, the opening chord (repeated three times by the piano soloist in Addinsell's original) is here thrice reiterated jerkily and artificially through cuts and short loops, producing a new rhythm that will serve as the background for the rapper's recitation of his name, \"D-M-X,\" and the title command/interrogative \"What's—My—Name.\" Architecturally the piano sounds serve as columnar supports for the monumental temple of dark prophecy on which D M X raps, while within this implicit mise-en-scène Addinsell's chord remains stiff and unnatural, a reanimated Frankenstein monster, a sonic Karloff analogue. D M X plays the role of the charismatic, an agent of divine revelation, supported by the sample. Addinsell's aesthetic (abstractly \"beautiful\") chord, prior to the launch-\n\nThe Expressive Vernacular\n\n37\n\ning of DMX's rap, is a \"monster\" in its literal and original connotation: a divine, if terrifying, omen that points the way. The scriptural elements of the album on which the song appears,. . . And Then There Was X, elaborate upon scriptural originary mythography, starting with the title paraphrase of Genesis. The cover art features a giant papyrus fragment in the form of the letter X (the chi of Christomythic orthography). Upon it is inscribed a fragmentary text that includes references to the Nativity (\"a star\") and the Crucifixion (\"if it takes for me to suffer for my brother\"), along with a prayer of thanksgiving. Self-sacrifice (for the sake of one's \"brethren\"), in its aspects of spirituality and violent carnality, is central to the thematic content of the collection, as it was— perhaps coincidentally—to Addinsell's inspiration for the wartime \"concerto,\" and D M X positions himself as both priest and prophet with respect to its message; he is an interpreter and a vessel. His acoustical assembling of effects that conjure sensations of terror, sacrifice, and ethical positioning is representative, however—whatever DMX's personal faith—of the musical melodramatist. The track projects to listeners a sort of ethical drama that, as Peter Brooks has argued, is fundamental to the melodramatic gestural mode of authors operating outside a social environment grounded in common acceptance of a single \"true Sacred.\"69 René Girard has stressed the fundamental importance of sanctioned acts of sacrifice, in antiquity, in Old Testament narrative, and in more recent third-world cultures, as a balance to societal violence: \"In a universe where the slightest dispute can lead to disaster—just as a slight cut can prove fatal to a hemophiliac—the rites of sacrifice serve to polarize the community's aggressive impulses and redirect them toward victims that may be actual or figurative, animate or inanimate, but that are always incapable of propagating further violence.\"70 The form taken by the \"Dead Sea Scrolls\" chi of the cover art on the D M X recording sends the consumer a signal of this thematic element by applying to the visual register of the scriptural a violent inflection. Resembling crossed daggers that take the shape of scissors or shears, the image of the chi mitigates the born-again aspects of the rapper's poetry (in particular, the prayer recited on track 16 of the CD), and maintains the mythography of urban chaos, real or imagined, that has been consistently re-created in rap music imagery. Similarly Addinsell's borrowed chord is momentarily reregistrated in the domain of the urban rap vernacular at"
