Still, in the record stores of old, in descriptions of radio-station formats (on-air and Internet), and at various streaming audio and download sites today, we have seen and continue to see music categorized by genre. Indeed, some genre boundaries are at least somewhat artificial, and it is true that some artists and some pieces of music transcend boundaries. But categorizing music by genre is a convenient way of keeping track of the thousands upon thousands of musical works available for listeners’ enjoyment; it’s analogous to the difference between having all your documents on your computer’s home screen versus organizing them into folders. So, Greenwood’s Exploring Musical Genres series is a genre- and performance group–based collection of books and e-books. The publications in this series will provide listeners with background information on the genre; critical analysis of important examples of musical pieces, artists, and events from the genre; discussion of must-hear music from the genre; analysis of the genre’s impact on the popular culture of its time and on later popular-culture trends; and analysis of the enduring legacy of the genre today and its impact on later musicians and their songs, instrumental works, and recordings. Each volume will also contain a bibliography of references for further reading. We view the volumes in the Exploring Musical Genres series as a go-to resource for serious music fans, the more casual listener, and everyone in between. The authors in the series are scholars, who probe into the details of the genre and its practitioners: the singers, instrumentalists,\n\nxii Series Foreword\n\ncomposers, and lyricists of the pieces of music that we love. Although the authors’ scholarship brings a high degree of insight and perceptive analysis to the reader’s understanding of the various musical genres, the authors approach their subjects with the idea of appealing to the lay reader, the music nonspecialist. As a result, the authors may provide critical analysis using some high-level scholarly tools; however, they avoid any unnecessary and unexplained jargon or technical terms or concepts. These are scholarly volumes written for the enjoyment of virtually any music fan. Every volume has its length parameters, and an author cannot include every piece of music from within a particular genre. Part of the challenge, but also part of the fun, is that readers might agree with some of the choices of “must-hear music” and disagree with others. So while your favorite example of, say, grunge music might not be included, the author’s choices might help you to open up your ears to new, exciting, and ultimately intriguing possibilities. By and large, these studies focus on music from the sound-recording era: roughly the 20th century through the present. American guitarist, composer, and singer-songwriter Frank Zappa once wrote: On a record, the overall timbre of the piece (determined by equalization of individual parts and their proportions in the mix) tells you, in a subtle way, WHAT the song is about. The orchestration provides important information about what the composition IS and, in some instances, assumes a greater importance than the composition itself. (Zappa with Occhiogrosso 1989, 188; italics and capitalization from the original) The gist of Zappa’s argument is that everything that the listener expe­ riences (to use Zappa’s system of emphasizing words)—including the arrangement, recording mix and balance, lyrics, melodies, harmonies, instrumentation, and so on—makes up a musical composition. To put it another way, during the sound-recording era, and especially after the middle of the 20th century, we have tended to understand the idea of a piece of music—particularly in the realm of popular music—as being the same as the most definitive recording of that piece of music. And this is where Zappa’s emphasis on the arrangement and recording’s production comes into play. As a result, a writer delving into, say, new wave rock will examine and analyze the B-52’s’ version of “Rock Lobster” and not just the words, melodies, and chords that any band could sing and play and still label the result “Rock Lobster.” To use Zappa’s graphic way\n\nSeries Foreword xiii\n\nof highlighting particular words, the B-52’s’ recording IS the piece. Although they have expressed it in other ways, other writers such as Theodore Gracyk (1996, 18) and Albin J. Zak III (2001) concur with Zappa’s equating of the piece with the studio recording of the piece. In the case of musical genres not as susceptible to being tied to a particular recording—generally because of the fact that they are genres often experienced live, such as classical music or Broadway musicals— the authors will still make recommendations of particular recordings (we don’t all have ready access to a live performance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Symphony No. 40 any time we’d like to experience the piece), but they will focus their analyses on the more general, the noteson-the-page, the expected general aural experience that one is likely to find in any good performance or recorded version. Maybe you think that all you really want to do is just listen to the music. Won’t reading about a genre decrease your enjoyment of it? My hope is that you’ll find that reading this book opens up new possibilities for understanding your favorite musical genre and that by knowing a little more about it, you’ll be able to listen with proverbial new ears and gain even more pleasure from your listening experience. Yes, the authors in the series will bring you biographical detail, the history of the genres, and critical analysis on various musical works that they consider to be the best, the most representative, and the most influential pieces in the genre. However, ultimately, the goal is to enhance the listening experience. That, by the way, is why these volumes have an exclamation mark in their titles. So please enjoy both reading and listening! —James E. Perone, Series Editor REFERENCES Gracyk, Theodore. 1996. Rhythm and Noise: An Aesthetics of Rock. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.

The punk movement is not just confined to music either; it includes the written word and visual art. All are designed to overturn the model of art in which the general public appreciates work made by a talented few. Punk blurs the lines between artist and fan by encouraging anyone who has something to say to pick up an instrument, write, or create art and bypass the corporate gatekeepers to share that work with like-minded people. Because punk rejects corporate aesthetics that homogenize art so that it can be marketed to the lowest common denominator of consumers, it “was always intended to sound rough, unrefined, and under-produced” (Langerholc 2017). As a consequence, “most punk bands use the most basic instrumentation, with many punk bands only consisting of three members” (Langerholc 2017). Punk culture is “nihilistic, pessimistic, anti-authoritarian and anarchic in its civil and political message; provocative, Dada-esque and theatrical in its artistic expression; and hedonistic, experimental and egalitarian in its social values” (White 2012). Punk promotes these ideas through its characteristic sound: the instrumentation is usually stripped down to guitar, bass, and drums; “songs are often played at a very fast tempo and include a great deal of emphasis on beats 2 and 4”; and “drumbeats are largely very simple and unadorned, except for the occasional super-fast fill” (Langerholc 2017). The songs are short, getting directly to the point, and “vocals are often shouted in a confrontational manner” (Langerholc 2017). Lyrical considerations often include politics, drug and substance abuse, general musings on life and the absurdities thereof, and sexuality,\n\nxvi Preface\n\nas opposed to romantic love. Many songs are written with the intent to shock, so punk is rife with profanities that often make the songs unsuitable for broadcast radio. Punk rock began in 1976–1977 in London, New York, and France, and was influenced by the anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian Situationist International collective as well as by the beatniks, Dadaism, surrealism, and the avant-garde movement. Punk’s aim to shock “is an established part of avant-garde aesthetics” (Laing 2015, 96). Bad Religion front man Greg Graffin summed up punk as “the personal expression of uniqueness that comes from the experiences of growing up in touch with our human ability to reason and ask questions.” It is “a movement that serves to refute social attitudes that have been perpetuated through willful igno­ rance of human nature,” “a process of questioning and commitment to understanding that results in self-progress,” and “a belief that this world is what we make of it” and that “truth comes from our understanding of the way things are, not from the blind adherence to prescriptions about the way things should be” (qtd. in Hiebert 2010). One way that punk refuted the status quo was by looking to “roots” music for inspiration. This roots music consisted of reggae, blues, and early rock and roll that predated the Beatles, which were the opposite of the progressive rock, pop rock, and disco that was a fixture of the 1970s popular music scene. Too, punk aesthetics “made ugliness beautiful” (Malcolm McLaren qtd. in Hiebert 2010). Ripped clothing held together with safety pins, smeared makeup, and brightly colored mohawks were both shocking to the general public of the 1970s as well as the antithesis of glamour. The casual and even outrageous punk look showed that punks were unconcerned about fitting into mainstream society to become part of the workforce or make themselves attractive. Jon Savage, the author of one of the most definitive books about punk, England’s Dreaming, explains that “punk’s self-starter-D.I.Y. impulse was its most important consequence” (qtd. in Shea 2016). Without this impulse, punks would have never been able to share their relentlessly uncommercial music and ideas with the world. Punk’s DIY attitude is what led punks to seize the means of production to start their own record labels to distribute their music, book their own concert tours, and communicate directly with fans as well as to create xeroxed zines and guerilla art. It is this DIY ethos that makes punk still relevant today, as new generations of musicians, artists, and fans are encouraged by other punks who have shared their work via informal and anti-corporate networks.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nBackground and History\n\nP\n\nunk rock is a musical genre that simultaneously emerged in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France in the mid-1970s, at a time “when youth in numerous Western industrialized countries strug­ gled with feelings of alienation from the social, economic, and political forces around them” (Dunn 2011, 28–29). Punk was born of the “frustration with what many urban youths saw as the ineffectiveness of hippie-style liberalism” (St. John 2004). Punk’s intellectual origins can be traced to France, “in the countercultural manifestos that appeared during and soon after the events of May 1968 in Paris,” when student protests against capitalism, consumerism, traditional institutions, and American imperialism set off a general strike that even caused then president Charles de Gaulle to flee to Germany (Greene 2017, 123). Major figures of British punk, such as Malcolm McLaren, Tony Wilson, and Bernard Rhodes, were avid readers of the works of the Situationist International that inspired the May 68 protesters, “such as those by Guy Debord (author of The Society of the Spectacle), whose thoughts on personal freedom, the individual, and consumer society were a major political and social influence on the British punk scene” (Savage 1992, 27–32). The first punk festival was held, illegally, in the small French town of Mont-de-Marsan in 1976. Festival organizer Marc Zermati chose the remote location for the small festival to fly under the radar of French officials, who in the aftermath of the May 68 civil unrest had banned music festivals because they were places for young people to gather and perhaps plot to overthrow the government. Ironically, punk did not take off in France the way it did in the United Kingdom and the United States, in part because it was unable to spark outrage among the old guard. However, punk’s French influences could\n\n2 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nbe seen in the emerging London and New York punk scenes. Punk’s “theme of ‘no future’ was taken directly from the disenchantment and agitation of French youth in May 68,” while its iconoclasm and the questions that it “posed as to the very essence of art (and anti-art) can be traced back to the French surrealists such as André Breton and the Dadaists of the early twentieth century” (Greene 2017, 123). In New York, key punk figures “were influenced by French literary and artistic figures, some of whom had their origins further back in time, but had been embraced by the French student counterculture of May ’68” (Greene 2017, 123). Patti Smith, the godmother of punk, “was an avid reader of both nineteenth-century Symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud and the more contemporary Jean Genet and used the works of both writers in her performances. Thomas Miller, better known as Tom Verlaine of the band Television, took the last name as an homage to Paul Verlaine, another French Symbolist poet, while the dandified look cultivated by Richard Hell owed a lot to the artistic bohemia of nineteenth-century fin de siècle Paris” (Greene 2017, 123). Both Smith and Hell “were involved in close relationships with the French multimedia artist Lizzy Mercier Descloux who was living and working in New York during the mid1970s” (Goldman 2019; Hell 2013). Both French and British punks “tended to view established social conventions” and institutions “as hypocritical obfuscations obscuring the brutality of real life,” and “the original British punk scene both reflected and mocked the disintegration of British society in the late 1970s” (Dunn 2011, 28). Unemployment was high in the United Kingdom of the 1970s, and there was little class mobility. Also, the United Kingdom never experienced the postwar prosperity of the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, and some British cities still had rubble from buildings that had been bombed out during the war. American punks were not terribly different from their British and French counterparts. American society had also been changing since World War II. The civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, second-wave feminism, and the Stonewall riots challenged American institutions that subordinated nonwhites, women, and gays and lesbians and sent young men to die in Korea and Vietnam. Meanwhile, runaway inflation in the 1970s made the cost of living so expensive that families started to need two adult breadwinners. American youth were also fed up with hippie-style liberalism, which they saw as ineffective in bringing about any meaningful social change, and like their British counterparts, they felt alienated from the world, as consumer capitalism had appropriated authentic connections between people and repackaged them as mass culture.\n\nBackground and History 3\n\nPunk has been described as a genre that reclaimed what rock and roll was supposed to be about, such as listeners having serious emotional connections to their favorite artists and bands. The earliest punks grew up “with bands like the Beatles, the Who, and the Rolling Stones,” who “fostered the now nearly antiquated idea that rock & roll was an intrinsic part of a young person’s soul, an engine of social change and not just a consumer commodity” (Azerrad 2001, 7). That connection has been diluted “by pop’s lowest common denominator approach”—where the music that is produced appeals to the broadest possible audience—as well as “impersonal stadium concerts and the unreality of MTV” (Azerrad 2001, 10). In 1976, two-thirds of the British record market was shared between six major transnational companies, and these companies had major overseas branches as well with licensing arrangements which would ensure access to every market of significance in the Western and Third Worlds. (Laing 2015, 9) Big corporate music created “the classic transnational sound of the 1970s” exemplified by “the Swedish group Abba” (Laing 2015, 10). Another product of big corporate music was progressive rock, a genre that “emphasized the primacy of recorded music over live performance” and “equated musical excellence with a meticulous (and time-­ consuming, hence expensive) attention to detail in, and maximum use of the technical resources of the recording studio” (Laing 2015, 12). Punks looked to early rock and roll as well as the more contemporary pub rock scene for inspiration to create music that countered the alienation they experienced. Pubs were “one type of location in the mid-1970s where something like ‘grass roots’ might be discovered” with pub rock bands (Laing 2015, 16). Pub rock bands went “against the grain of contemporary rock” by looking to the past for inspiration in playing live music in small venues where audiences were more than passive consumers of music along the arena rock model. “Pub rock bands played music from, or inspired by, the golden age of rhythm and blues and rock ’n’ roll” (Laing 2015, 17). The first punk bands used the dynamic performances of pub bands as a model to make music that disrupted the corporate music model of fans as passive consumers of music. Punk transformed audiences into “agents of cultural production” (Dunn 2011, 28–29). This transformation was brought about by artists who made music that was relentlessly anti-commercial by conventional measures, by developing alternatives to the big corporate music business, and by questioning\n\n4 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nthe rock star model of artist as extraordinary genius who is distant from the common people who constitute his or her fans. Punk rock songs and band names were the antithesis of mainstream music as well as pub rock. Pub rock was a reaction against progressive rock and the transnational sound, with its return to the basics of rock and roll and emphasis on live performances. However, both mainstream and pub rock songs stuck to “the well-established themes of love, dance,” and “hard luck” (Laing 2015, 39). Because the word punk had previously been used to describe categories of people considered to be “rotten” and “worthless” in the eyes of mainstream society, punk bands looked “for qualities, objects, and activities” that were “despicable or disgusting and used them as band names as well as subject matter for their songs” (Laing 2015, 63). Punk band names included colloquial references to genitals or sex (e.g., Sex Pistols, Shonen Knife (boy knife), the Slits, the Muffs, Pussy Riot, Hole, Butthole Surfers, the Circle Jerks, Dicks); bodily functions or purification (e.g., Red Aunts, the Breeders, the Cramps, Germs, Rancid, the Hives, Garbage); drugs, alcohol, and dangerous substances (e.g., Strung Out, Everclear, My Chemical Romance, Agent Orange, Green Day); or outsiders, monsters, and death (e.g., Misfits, Pennywise, Leatherface, Dead Boys, Death). Musicians also took stage names that suggested they were despicable or disgusting, including Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols and Mojo Nixon, or that emphasized the artificial, such as Poly Styrene of the X-Ray Spex. Songs also followed this model: for example, the Dead Kennedys’ “Too Drunk to F[—]” and “Nazi Punks F[—] Off”; L7’s “Shitlist”; Bad Religion’s “Infected”; Pansy Division’s “Homo Christmas”; Jim Carroll’s “People Who Died”; Against Me!’s “Unprotected Sex with Multiple Partners”; Dream Wife’s “F[—] You Up,” which they abbreviated to “FUU”; the Cramps’ “Strychnine”; Pennywise’s “F[—] Authority”; Hole’s “Teenage Whore”; the Circle Jerks’ “World Up My Ass”; and the Ramones’ “I Wanna Be Sedated,” to name a few. Punk songs deconstructed and disrupted the paradigm of cis-het romantic love that is the subject of so many pop songs with lyrics of sexuality, “where the sexual is given precedence over the sentimental,” and describe “lust, obsession, or disgust” as well as lyrics about nonheterosexual love (Laing 2015, 40). The Buzzcocks’ “Ever Fallen in Love,” written by lead singer Pete Shelley, who was bisexual, used gender-neutral pronouns to thwart attempts to make the song exclusively about heterosexual love. Other Buzzcocks songs that were about sex rather than love include “Orgasm Addict” and “What Do I Get?” Other songs attacked revered institutions such as the monarchy and organized religion (e.g.,\n\nBackground and History 5\n\nthe Sex Pistols’ “God Save the Queen,” Bad Religion’s “American Jesus”) or any kind of government (e.g., the Sex Pistols’ “Anarchy in the UK,” the Dead Kennedys’ “California Über Alles”), that remembered fallen revolutionaries (e.g., the Clash’s “Spanish Bombs,” which is about the soldiers who fought against fascism in Spain), or that called out racism, sexism, homophobia, or capitalism and consumerism, such as the Clash’s “Guns of Brixton,” about the 1981 riots in that city in response to the police’s harassment of Black youth; L7’s “Pretend We’re Dead,” about the cost of ignoring judicial assaults on women’s reproductive freedom; Pansy Division’s “That’s So Gay,” which calls out people who use this phrase; and Bad Religion’s “21st Century Digital Boy,” about a kid who “doesn’t know how to live” but “has a lot of toys.” The language used in many of these songs “drew on discourses which not only had been previously absent from popular song, but which had been excluded from the mainstream media discourse of society as a whole,” such as the areas of pornography and obscenity (Laing 2015, 95). “Since one of punk rock’s avowed aims was disruption,” most songs were not “in the playlists for the mainstream daytime programming,” and any that got airplay at all were “relegated to the various ‘specialist’ rock programmes in the evenings or on weekends” (Laing 2015, 48). In the 1970s, radio’s distancing of itself from punk rock “was reinforced by the ‘moral panic’ surrounding the music, its exponents and their audiences following the Bill Grundy incident in December of 1976” (Laing 2015, 48) in the United Kingdom, when Sid Vicious swore at the Today show host on live television during a peak viewing time. Punk is subversive of existing hierarchal power structures both through overtly political music (e.g., the Clash, Bikini Kill, Pussy Riot, the Raincoats, Bad Religion, War on Women, the Slits, L7, X-Ray Spex) and through songs that challenge the nature of art and reality. For example, punk covers of others’ work either repurpose existing music by performing it with irony (see the entire oeuvre of the super group Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies, who punkify very nonpunk songs, as well as Sid Vicious’s version of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way”) or without (such as Shonen Knife’s covers of the Ramones’ music—the Japanese band so admires the New York City punk outfit that they have also been known as Osaka Ramones). As well, punks combine and repurpose other musical traditions and genres, such as the Celtic punk bands the Pogues, Flogging Molly, and the Dropkick Murphys, who play punk versions of older Irish music; gypsy and klezmer punk bands, who use Eastern European musical traditions as the foundation of their work; and the Angry Snowmen, who only play punk covers of Christmas music. The\n\n6 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nsimplicity of most punk songs also encourages audiences to sing along with the band, which spreads infectious joy. Another way that punk was different from previous musical genres and trends was that it showed people how to seize the “resources for agency and political expression” (Dunn 2011, 29). Punk’s DIY ethos led to the development of alternative models of the music business, proving that “you could make a better connection with your audience without” a “big corporation to fund you, or even verify that you were any good” (Azerrad 2001, 10). Punks formed their own independent labels to promote their music without having to “heed the imperative of the hit parade” (Laing 2015, 19). Punk owed a debt to pub rock for this innovation; pub rock bands produced “their own discs, to be sold primarily at their own live performances” (Laing 2015, 20). However, the record labels of the punk era “were clearly distinguished from those earlier independents by their numbers, their size and their geographical locations. A catalogue of small labels published by ZigZag magazine in 1978 listed 120 companies with a repertoire of punk material, mostly with just a handful of titles and nearly all based outside London” (Laing 2015, 27). Moreover, “many of these labels were the vinyl equivalent to the fanzines which multiplied in the wake of Sniffin’ Glue” (Laing 2015, 27). “By dispensing with the need for expensive productions, promotional staff and the other overheads of the chart-oriented companies,” small record labels “could work to ‘break-even’ figures which could be as low as 2,000 copies for a single” (Laing 2015, 19). The California hardcore band Minutemen described their alternative model of promoting their own music as “jamming econo” (Azerrad 2001, 11). But jamming econo was more than just promoting your own music on a shoestring budget. Jamming econo allowed people to take charge of their own existence by changing their buying and working habits so that they were “beholden only to [themselves] and the values and people [they] respected” (Azerrad 2001, 11). As the Minutemen said in their song “History Lesson Part 2,” “our band could be your life.” “Because punk also challenged the rock star model of the artist,” punks weren’t “consumers of the mass media,” but instead, “agents of cultural production” (Dunn 2011, 28–29). Punk was formed in opposition to arena rock, which contrasted the superstars with their banks of technology on stage against the audience who had nothing but expensively acquired ticket stubs. “One effect of the earliest punk bands was to turn listeners into players” (Laing 2015, 103). Folk punk musician Billy Bragg tweeted that “the best think about punk was that anyone could get up and sing” (Bragg 2018). Bragg’s statement shows how\n\nBackground and History 7\n\npunk democratized art, in that the artist is someone who has something to say rather than someone who is extraordinarily talented. Because “punk meant an attitude towards musical performance which emphasized directness and repetition (to use more than three chords was self-­ indulgence) at the expense of technical virtuosity,” artists did not have to be professional musicians to be in a band (Laing 2015, 22). In fact, many punks learned as they went along. For example, the members of the Runaways and Bikini Kill developed their musicianship as they developed their bands. Punk audiences became active participants at shows both via conventional means, such as dancing, and unconventional ones, such as gobbing, or spitting, on each other. “Dancing had been one way of being active for an audience, and punk fans surging to the front of an auditorium to pogo responded in the same way as teds jiving in the aisles of the 1950s” (Laing 2015, 104). As well, punk bands encouraged participation at their shows through “provocation and goading” audience members, particularly through gobbing on them. Gobbing “was one ritual indulged in by both musician and audience: they spat at, and often on, each other” as a perverse gesture of intimacy (Laing 2015, 107). Because the punk movement transformed how fans interacted with the music they loved, from the start, it was bigger than just music. The punk movement encouraged other types of artistic production as well. Punks self-published zines via mimeograph and Xerox machines and distributed them at shows, clubs, and record stores to communicate with like-minded people. Punk rock was the first musical genre to spawn fanzines in any significant numbers. The occasional surveys in the orthodox music press suggested that during 1977–78 there may have been over 50 appearing in all parts of Britain. As well as initiating the trend, [the zine] Sniffin’ Glue played a pivotal role in establishing punk’s self-image. . . . the cover of Sniffin’ Glue 1 announced itself to be “for punks.” It was the first time the audience rather than the music had been defined that way. (Laing 2015, 25) Other punks created, accidentally or on purpose, their own fashion aesthetic: some punks wore safety pins in their clothing as a practical way to mend rips, and others wore fetish wear to shock bourgeois sensibilities or dyed their hair colors not found in nature as a way of demonstrating that they had no future in a world that offered only dead-end menial jobs that paid starvation wages—why bother looking presentable\n\n8 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nfor a potential employer and committing to forty hours of soulless labor every week when you could just as easily squat in abandoned buildings and find (or shoplift) what you needed to live? Others, like designer Vivienne Westwood, created clothing that was a bricolage of clashing colors and styles. The “organizing principles” of this look “were those of binding and tearing. Far away from the flowing, loose clothes of the hippie era, nearly everything male and literally everything female was tight, holding in the body. At one level punk was joining a trend of the 1970s to bring ‘above ground’ the imagery of the machinery of ‘bondage’ and sadomasochism” (Laing 2015, 118). Fashion theorist Dick Hebdige characterized the punk look as what punk fashion designer Vivienne Westwood “called ‘confrontation dressing’ . . . [where] the rupture between ‘natural’ and constructed context was clearly visible. . . . The perverse and the abnormal were valued intrinsically . . . and placed on the street where they retained their forbidden connotations” (Hebdige 1979, 107–108). Female performers and fans challenged orthodox rock practice in the male-dominated music business in three ways. They could dress like one of the guys, such as Gaye Advert (of the Adverts), who “opted for the leather jacket, wet-look trousers, and dog-collar style shared with male musicians” (Laing 2015, 115). Some wore an eclectic mix of clothing made from unlikely materials (such as Poly Styrene’s dress made from a black tablecloth, which she topped with a battle helmet and wore with kitten heels) and used garish “cartoon” colors, such as fluorescent colors, that “cut against the colour coding for ‘sexy’ women performers” (Laing 2015, 115), or they confronted the idea of women as sex objects by wearing fetish wear, fishnets, see-through tops, miniskirts, stilettos with exaggerated heels, garter belts, and corsets. Punk visual artists, such as Banksy, make and share their work in public spaces without permission, or they set up spaces themselves, such as Reko Muse, the feminist art gallery that Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill created when her and a friend’s photographs were taken down from an exhibit at Evergreen State University, where they were attending art school. Most punks are left-leaning. Bands such as Pussy Riot, the Clash, Bikini Kill, Crass, Fugazi, Dropkick Murphys, Green Day, Death, L7, Against Me!, Pansy Division, the Slits, Gogol Bordello, and Bad Religion use their music to advocate for laborers and immigrants and against imperialism, fascism, racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. Some band members are registered Democrats (e.g., Dropkick Murphys, Green Day), while others are affiliated with the Green or Libertarian parties (e.g., Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys). “Fat Mike” Burkett of\n\nBackground and History 9\n\nNOFX founded PunkVoter in the wake of the 2000 presidential election, whose winner had to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court; the Clash headed the Rock against Racism events in London; L7 started the Rock for Choice series of concerts and were named Feminists of the Year by the Feminist Majority; and members of Pussy Riot spent two years in jail for their musical activism against Vladimir Putin’s repressive regime. A small number of punk bands are politically conservative or even reactionary, such as Nazi and white supremacist punks. Johnny Ramone was a staunch Republican, which was a point of contention between him and his bandmates, particularly Joey Ramone. When the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, Johnny said from the podium, “God bless President Bush, and God bless America.” As well, “in late-1970s Britain, as the Clash were fronting Rock Against Racism, Oi! bands such as Skrewdriver were backing the National Front” (Lynskey 2004, “Meet the Pro-Bush Punks”). Today, punk is over forty years old. Many Year Zero bands have had their major works reissued by their labels in honor of their tenth, twentieth, thirtieth, and fortieth anniversaries. Several of these bands are also still touring and even making new music. But most importantly, punk is not dead. The Year Zero bands inspired new generations of punks, who have in turn inspired their own new generations of punks. The Raincoats, for example, inspired Kathleen Hanna and Toby Vail of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill. In 2019, Vail and Hanna reunited with their old bandmates and played to sold-out shows in New York and Los Angeles, where their old fans came to their concerts with their children, who had grown up hearing Bikini Kill’s music and could sing along. There are even children’s books about punk rock, such as Eric Morse and Anny Yi’s beautifully illustrated What Is Punk? and Jarrett J. Krosoczka’s Punk Farm books, about a group of barnyard animals who form a band and go on tour. Much of the punk aesthetic has also gone mainstream in the United States and Europe. When punks first started piercing themselves with safety pins and dying their hair with bold, unnatural colors and styling it in dramatic hairdos, like mohawks, they were so counterculture and shocking that they often could not find work until they changed their appearance. That is much different than how bright hair colors, piercing, and tattoos are perceived today, as those body modifications are entirely mainstream. Even doctors and lawyers are coloring their hair and getting tattoos. Punk’s longevity is due to how this genre continues to be relevant today. Punk has emboldened people to think of themselves as artists,\n\n10 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nand the internet has facilitated the ability to share songs and videos with like-minded people. Today, anyone with a cell phone can shoot a ­professional-looking video and record and edit sound with even the most basic computer. New punks also continue the genre’s tradition of political activism. The riot grrrl band L7 started the Rock for Choice series of concerts. More recently, War on Women’s second studio album, Capture the Flag, comes with a reading list of material about American imperialism and warmongering and how women’s reproductive rights are being taken away. Fat Mike, of the hardcore band NOFX, started PunkVoter in 2002 to get young people registered to vote to lay the groundwork for regime change after George W. Bush sent American troops to war in Iraq after 9/11 based on faulty intelligence that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected with al-Qaeda. X played the first Farm Aid benefit concert in 1985. And Black Flag reunited in 2013 to play a benefit concert for cats. Of course, because punk is over forty years old, much of it has now been commercially successful. Green Day, the Offspring, Against Me!, and Bad Religion, for example, were derided as sellouts for their commercial success in a 2015 article in Noisey (Ozzi), while older punk bands, such as the Ramones and the Raincoats, have developed wider followings long after their heydays as new generations of fans discover their music. Music sharing sites and streaming platforms such as Spotify, iTunes, and Pandora make it easier for fans to access the music of older bands who were never chart-topping artists. Corporate conglomerates have also cashed in on punk by acquiring logos, names, and trademarks, which they repackage and sell to people who want to be edgy. For example, the retail chain Hot Topic, which specializes in marketing what they brand as “counterculture” clothing, sells “vintage” Ramone T-shirts to tweens and teens. Terminal C in Newark’s Liberty International Airport sports CBGB LAB (Lounge and Bar) where travelers can drink a $20 craft beer and have a bowl of what must be Hilly Kristal’s original (and terrible) recipe chili while listening to a low-volume soundtrack of acts that played at the famous Bowery punk club. CBGB LAB is certainly cleaner than CGBG ever was—the facility’s walls are covered in graffiti wallpaper instead of actual graffiti. This was Noisey’s Eugenia Williamson’s experience when she visited CBGB in 2016, as well as mine in 2019—the chili was so bad that I had to send it back. Or, if you prefer, you can have a $16 hamburger in Black Flag’s old practice space (Koester 2013). Punk festivals such as Warped Tour, Riot Fest, and Lollapalooza are also big business. The Warped Tour, for example, an annual event with\n\nBackground and History 11\n\nfree admission, lasted for twenty-five years. The tour shut down in 2018 when the festival’s primary sponsor, Vans, pulled out in 2018 (Giordano 2018). The multiday punk and alternative rock Riot Fest has been held in Chicago every year since 2005. The traveling festival Lollapalooza was started in 1991 by the band Jane’s Addiction. It continued until 1997 and was later revived in 2003. Since 2005, Lollapalooza has been taking place in Chicago’s Grant Park. Satellite Lollapalooza festivals have also been held in Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, and France since 2011. Punk’s longevity has transformed the meaning of the word punk. When Marc Zermeti first coined the word back in 1976, it was most often used to describe young people who are hoodlums or ruffians. Today, the term applies to things that are aggressively unconventional. Punk has endured and remained relevant throughout the years because it offers people an alternative to the homogenizing effects of global capitalism.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nMust-Hear Music\n\nAGAINST ME! TRANSGENDER DYSPHORIA BLUES Against Me! is best known for its anarchist and activist music, such as “Turn Those Clapping Hands into Angry Balled Fists,” “I Was a Teenage Anarchist,” and the anti-war “White People for Peace.” It is also known because frontwoman Laura Jane Grace (née Thomas James Gabel) came out as transgender woman in a 2012 Rolling Stone interview, “Tom Gabel of Against Me! Comes Out as Transgender.” Grace started Against Me! in 1997 in Gainesville, Florida. The band’s name references Grace’s difficult adolescence, when she was bullied in high school because she was one of the few punk kids and felt that the whole world was against her (AOL Originals 2014). Grace found solace in “anarchist punk rock and activist punk rock” because of its strongly feminist, anti-racist, and anti-homo- and transphobic stance (Gross 2017). The band’s h ­ighest-charting album to date, Transgender Dysphoria Blues, was released in 2014, two years after Grace’s coming-out Rolling Stone interview. Before her announcement, “Against Me! was a wellliked, top-of-the-middle-tier punk band that survived a brief flirtation with major-label stardom” (Caramanica 2014), and their music “only addressed gender issues in passing” (Thompson 2014). Today, “Grace is now almost certainly the highest-profile musician to transition, and her new album is part manifesto, part open letter to fans, her wife, and her bandmates” (Stewart 2014). Although punk has always been a genre that challenges gender norms, Transgender Dysphoria Blues was unprecedented in how it narrated the difficulties of being transgender. Reviewer Petra Davis describes Transgender Dysphoria Blues as “a tough listen” because Grace openly describes her experiences before and during transition, which included\n\n14 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\ndaily threats of “rejection, humiliation, and violence” from people who felt threatened by the existence of trans people (2014). However, not everything on Transgender Dysphoria Blues is autobiographical: some songs recount the desperate experiences of other trans people, who selfharm, self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, and even resort to suicide to cope both with being rejected and brutalized by others and feeling that their bodies contradict their gender identities. Jon Caramanica remarks that the most shocking thing about Transgender Dysphoria Blues is not its content “but its polish. In places, it recalls far more anemically minded punk bands like the Gaslight Anthem, or even Green Day” (2014). The album’s first track, the anthem “True Trans Soul Rebel,” indicates that Gender Dysphoria Blues is “a coming out record, first and foremost” (Thompson 2014). The song sums up what it is to be trans in a world where those who do not conform to binary gender roles are shunned, discriminated against, and even killed; they are “yet to be born” as their true selves, “but already dead.” It describes the emotional turmoil experienced by trans people because they do not conform to binary gender roles, while offering the possibility that “it gets better” through its positioning on the album. In a 2014 interview, Grace remarked, “You become more brave about presenting femme” as you transition, “but you’re still closeted, so you have nowhere to go” (Edwards 2014). “Unconditional Love,” “Drinking with the Jocks,” “Osama bin Laden as Crucified Christ,” and “Paralytic States” detail the multiple levels of violence experienced by trans people. The trans woman who is drinking with the jocks wishes that she “were just like them” in their ability to be comfortable with their own gender identities. “Drinking with the Jocks” emphasizes the performative nature of gender: the speaker is “winging my dick in my hands” and “laughing at the faggots,” that is, any man that is perceived to have strayed from this narrow masculine paradigm. For the singer, fitting in with the boys is a type of self-inflicted violence in how she had to assume an identity that is repugnant to her sense of herself. “Unconditional Love,” “Osama bin Laden as Crucified Christ,” and “Paralytic States” chronicle the self-loathing that is the result of societal messages that people who do not conform to binary gender norms should not exist. “Even if your love was unconditional, it still wouldn’t be enough to save me,” the singer declares in “Unconditional Love” to describe her alienation. “Osama bin Laden as the Crucified Christ” compares the violence against transgender people who will not conform to others expectations about their gender to the violence experienced by others due to their beliefs, including Christ, bin Laden, and Benito Mussolini and his\n\nMust-Hear Music 15\n\ngirlfriend, Clara Petacci, who are referred to in the chorus: “You’re gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters / Hang like Clara with her skull caved in.” The comparisons to Mussolini and bin Laden are imperfect similes though, as neither are sympathetic figures. The transgender sex worker in “Paralytic States” commits the ultimate violence against herself when she cuts her wrists in a hotel bathroom, where she bleeds out, suffering the fate of many trans people, who are nearly ten times more likely to commit suicide than the general population—­approximately 41 percent compared to 4.6 percent of the overall population in the United States (Haas et al. 2014). Other songs are vignettes of life after Grace came out to the world as trans. In “FUCKMYLIFE666,” Grace recounts her fears about the stability of her relationship with her wife, to whom she was married when she was Tom Gabel. “Black Me Out” explains Grace’s strategy for dealing with those who will never accept that she is trans—she cuts these people out of her life. It is a fitting final track to the album, a coda to “True Trans Soul Rebel.” In forswearing people who will never accept her, Grace is claiming her right to be herself. “Dead Friend” and “Two Coffins” are the two songs on Transgender Dysphoria Blues that are not about trans people. “Dead Friend” remembers Grace’s friend Pope (John Paul Allison), who committed suicide when he was ­twenty-six, and “Two Coffins,” written for Grace’s daughter, contemplates the impermanence of life. Transgender Dysphoria Blues was critically acclaimed as a groundbreaking album. It was ranked 109th on NPR’s list of “The 150 Greatest Albums Made by Women” and described by reviewer Sarah Handel as “a milestone moment of a trans woman declaring her identity and articulating the highs and lows of her story” (2017). Transgender Dysphoria Blues made the lists of top albums of 2014 compiled by major music publications, including Rolling Stone’s “50 Best Albums of 2014” (15th), SPIN’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2014” (38th), TIME’s “Top 10 Best Albums of 2014” (4th), PopMatters’ “The Best Albums of 2014” (6th), Noisey’s “Top 25 Albums of 2014” (2nd), Consequence of Sound’s “Top 50 Albums of 2014” (6th), and “American Songwriter’s Top 50 Albums of 2014” (20th). ALICE BAG: ALICE BAG Alice Bag (Alicia Armendariz) has been a notable figure of the Los Angeles punk scene since the 1977, when punk first came to her hometown. She was a founding member of the Latinx punk band the Bags\n\n16 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\n(1977–1980), which played the same venues as the Germs and the Runaways, and the band appears in Penelope Spheeris’s documentary of the Los Angeles punk scene, The Decline of Western Civilization. Unlike the Germs, however, the Bags did not catch the interest of a record label who would record and distribute an album of their work to create a tangible artifact and solidify their reputation. During their brief time together, the Bags released only one single (though their collected works are now available on the 2003 album All Bagged Up). So it has taken nearly forty years for Bag to release a debut album. Alice Bag is a feminist analysis of the present day from the perspective of an older, queer woman of color. Because the early Los Angeles punk scene was initially welcoming to women and people of color, Bag was inspired to form her own band with Patricia Rainone (later Pat Bag), who she met at an audition for a band that was to be manager Kim Fowley’s next project after the Runaways fired him as their manager. Alice and Pat instead formed their own band, the Bags, taking the group’s name and their noms de guerre from a gimmick they used during early performances, where they went on stage with brown grocery bags over their heads. Alice and Pat soon abandoned that practice after Darby Crash, the Germs’ front man, ran up on stage and ripped the bags from their heads, but they kept the names. Alice (vocals) and Pat (bass) were joined by Craig Lee and Rob Ritter on guitar and Terry Graham on drums for their first gig at the Masque (Los Angeles) in 1977. The Bags’ “live shows soon became legendary. The concerts were riotous affairs including altercations with celebrities” (“The Bags” 2007), and the band appears in punk documentary The Decline of Western Civilization. However, they are billed in Decline as the Alice Bag Band, as Pat Bag (Patricia Rainone) had left the band before this performance, taking the original band name that she had trademarked with her. But before Decline was released, the Bags had, in part, broken up because the Los Angeles punk scene was quickly being taken over by white suburban men who made the environment very unwelcoming for women and people of color. After the Bags disbanded, Bag “took a break from performing,” but she was “always creating” (Agacki 2018). Bag and some of her friends formed the band Stay at Home Bomb, “a play on ’50s housewife mom clichés” (Agacki 2018), and she has written three books to date. Bag’s debut album, Alice Bag (2016), is her most powerful work so far, “an amalgamation of stories and sounds from its creator’s life” (Moreland 2016) that takes on a wide range of subjects, including domestic violence, GMOs, immigration, rape culture, lookism, homophobia, and the education-industrial complex. Bags describes her musical style\n\nMust-Hear Music 17\n\nas “punkchera,” a combination of punk and the ranchera music that she grew up with (“Alice Bag” 2020). The album’s first track, “Little Hypocrite,” is a solid piece of rock that encourages the listener to “stop pretending,” advice that applies to the other subjects in her songs, who are not so much pretending to be good but instead deeply programmed to behave in ways that are not in their own interests. “He’s So Sorry” mimics the musical style of girl groups from the 1960s (e.g., the Shirelles), including a sing-along chorus punctuated by castanets and a Phil Spector–like wall of sound. However, the subject of “He’s So Sorry” is not a brokenhearted woman struggling to forgive her lover’s perfidy, but a woman in an abusive relationship who is trapped by her dangerous ideas about romantic love as much as she is by her partner’s violence. Bag’s lyrics, sung in this girl group style, underscore how the conventions of heteronormative romance normalize the abuser’s behavior just as he hits her: “Why do you push him away? / You know you want him to stay.” The final scene video for “He’s So Sorry” drives home what happens to women if they cannot get away from abusive partners—Bag and her bandmates croon the last chorus at the woman’s grave after her lover has murdered her. The ballad “Suburban Home” also examines how the conventions of heteronormative romance trap women in an “us where I used to be.” In “No Means No,” a date rapist has the meaning of this phrase explained to him by the female judge who rejects his pleas for leniency. Bag advises the younger subject of “Modern Day Virgin Sacrifice” to “look beyond the mirror” and “recognize [her] perfection.” “Programmed” is derived from Bag’s experiences as a student and a teacher, whose understanding of pedagogy is informed by theorist Paolo Freire, who views modern educational practices as suppressing critical thinking skills in favor of blind obedience to authority. Bag refuses her schooling, which taught to “color in the lines” and “spit back all their lies.” The farmer in “Poisoned Seed” would rather “be up to his [neck] in weeds” rather than “water the poisoned seed,” GMO crops that are genetically modified to resist broad-spectrum herbicides that are sprayed on the field to kill out competing plants. Using these seeds encourages agricultural practices that poison the ecosystem in which they are grown by killing off biodiversity. In “The Touch I Crave,” Bag responds to a homophobic critic who tells her that she is sinning when she does “what feels right.” “Inesperado Adiós” (“Unexpected Goodbye”) reflects the cruelty of the United States’ current immigration policies. The song is based on Bag’s experience helping a student’s family get his father out of an immigration detention center (Moreland 2016). Bag’s choice to sing “Inesperado\n\n18 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nAdiós” in Spanish reflects that there are some situations that cannot be effectively translated: American whites have not experienced the horror of coming home one day to find a family member has been picked up by immigration officials to be deported. Bag continues to record, tour, and write today. Her follow-up album, Blueprint (2018), has an impressive list of guest backup vocalists, including Spanish singer Martin Sorrondeguy of the queercore groups Los Crudos and Limp Wrist, Mexican American musician Lysa Flores, and Chilean American singer and poet Francisca Valenzuela on “Turn It Up” and Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and Allison Wolfe of Bratmobile on “77,” the number of cents that women earn in comparison to their male peers. However, Blueprint primarily consists of “upbeat rock and ambling ballads,” although “77” and “Turn It Up” stand out as punk songs (“Alice Bag” 2020). Kathleen Hanna and Allison Wolfe appear with Bag in the video for “77,” which they perform as a parody of the 1980 movie 9 to 5, a comedy about female clerical staff being mistreated by their sexist boss. Setting the video in 1980 serves to remind viewers that the wage gap is not just a thing of the past. Bag also opened for Bikini Kill on their 2019 reunion tour. She has published an autobiography (Violence Girl: East L.A. Rage to Hollywood Stage, a Chicana Punk Story, 2011) and a memoir of her experiences in Nicaragua after the Sandinista revolution (Pipe Bomb for the Soul, 2015). BAD BRAINS: I AGAINST I Bad Brains is one of the inventors of hardcore punk. Bad Brains was formed in 1979 by guitarist Dr. Know (Gary Miller), vocalist H. R. (Paul D. Hudson), bassist Daryl Jenifer, and drummer Earl Hudson, H. R.’s brother. One of the few all-Black punk acts (in 1979 and today), the Washington, DC, band did not exhibit the “snotty strain of white male anger and discontent” of their peers (Aron 2018). Rather, Bad Brains’ music, as described by Jenifer, is “the thinking man’s punk” because it encourages “peace and love and positive mental attitude,” a tenet of Rastafarianism that helps believers achieve happiness through becoming closer to Jah (Kirby 2015). Bad Brains combines metal, punk, funk, and reggae to create music that is so “inherently complex” that it demands its audience’s attention (Pickard 2016). The complex rhythms were derived from the band members’ experience as the jazz-fusion combo Mind Power (1976–1979). The band members switched from playing jazz to punk after Jenifer introduced his bandmates to the music of the Dickies, Dead Boys, and\n\nMust-Hear Music 19\n\nthe Sex Pistols (Kirby 2015); they were impressed with the “atypical progressions and feral movements” (Pickard 2016). Mind Power became Bad Brains in honor of the Ramones’ song “Bad Brain.” The 1986 album I Against I has been described as “the band’s first fully mature work” because of how it combines the group’s diverse influences (Anderson n.d., “Bad Brains”). I Against I is a Rastafarian Pilgrim’s Progress in how its songs ask and answer the questions of a spiritual pilgrim. The album’s title track is a blistering condemnation of violence against other humans, a theme the band returns to in “Hired Gun,” which is about a gangster who will never know peace because he is eternally on the run from the law. “House of Suffering” asks and answers the question, “How can there be a god when the world is full of suffering?”: Jah’s love is “inside the hearts of your own children.” The House of Suffering is a human-made creation that humans can transcend with the realization that grace is stronger than doom. The newly enlightened subject of “House of Suffering” considers how he can use Positive Mental Attitude to enlighten others in “Re-Ignition.” This project is expanded in “Let Me Help,” which enjoins the listener to “rejuvenate more integrity. Universal all live as one” so to edify others. The love song “Sacred Love” exalts spiritual unions over physical ones: because “our love” is “sacred,” the speaker tells his beloved to not “lust off [his] body” or “come to [him] as a whore” so that Jah will bless them the next day. I Against I appropriately concludes with a track that reminds listeners of the fate that awaits those who fail to “choose a divine light,” “Return to Heaven.” Although Bad Brains’ music expresses the Rastafarian belief in peace and love, the band’s reputation for attracting rowdy fans to their shows soon got them shut out of DC-area clubs by owners who did not want their venues destroyed (an experience they recount in the song “Banned in DC”). As a result, Bad Brains relocated to New York City to find gigs, and they performed several times at CBGB. But in New York and on the road, the band continued to attract raucous crowds wherever they went. Musician Dave Harbour recalls a 1985 Bad Brains’ performance in in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The audience was filled with skinheads and fraternity boys whose moshing and fighting became indistinguishable once Bad Brains took the stage. After trying to eject some of the troublemakers from the venue, security “quickly realized they were outnumbered and left” (Harbour 2018). Bad Brains’ career has been interrupted several times by members’ personnel problems. H. R. was arrested on a marijuana charge while the band was in the middle of recording I Against I, so his vocals on “Sacred\n\n20 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nLove” were recorded from jail. The band was also kept apart by artistic differences. On occasion, H. R. refused to play at scheduled concerts and attend practice sessions when he and his brother Earl wanted to play reggae but Dr. Know and Jenifer wanted to play hard rock. Between 2015 and 2016, Dr. Know was on life support after a heart attack and organ failure, and H. R. suffered from debilitating headaches. However, both have recovered sufficiently to play a few gigs, including a short fortieth anniversary set at Chicago’s Riot Fest in 2017. Bad Brains has been eligible for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since 2007, and they were nominated in 2017. However, the selection committee ultimately decided that Yes, Electric Light Orchestra, and Pearl Jam were more worthy of induction, to the chagrin of the band’s fans. Bad Brains is the subject of the documentary Bad Brains: A Band in DC (2012), and the documentary Finding Joseph I is based on Howie Abrams and James Lathos’s oral history of H. R.’s life. BAD RELIGION: STRANGER THAN FICTION The hardcore punk band Bad Religion is best known for its fast-paced three-part harmonies and songs that cover subjects such as racism, human rights, contemporary politics, science, and the media. Greg Graffin (vocals), Brett Gurewitz (guitar), Jay Bentley (bass), and Jay Ziskrout (drums) formed Bad Religion in 1980 while they were in high school. Although the band still records and tours today, Graffin has been the only constant member. Bad Religion’s name and cross-buster symbol represent its founders’ antipathy toward any type of dogmatic thinking, including religious fundamentalism, blind patriotism, and consumerism. Stranger than Fiction, Bad Religion’s eighth studio album (1994), exemplifies the band’s iconoclasm and desire for spiritual and intellectual sustenance in a plastic world. Most of the songs on Stranger than Fiction are bleak portraits of modern life. The young subject of their best-known song, “21st Century Digital Boy,” does not know how to go about living but has no shortage of toys provided by his parents as compensation for their emotional neglect of their child. “Incomplete” continues in this vein: the young subject is “the butt of the worst joke in history” and has no direction in life. “Television” is a “gentle and understanding” big brother, the boy’s “connection to the world outside” that assures him that things will be okay. The video for “21st Century Digital Boy” blends the themes of all three of these songs: an infant sits in thrall to the blue glow of a huge television, and the band occasionally breaks through the static on screen\n\nMust-Hear Music 21\n\nto communicate with him. Romantic love is just another version of codependency in “Infected,” where the speaker is “afflicted” while his partner is “addicted.” “Leave Mine to Me” and “The Handshake” scorn convention and conformity because they are the master’s tools to control the masses. The existential “Leave Mine to Me” retorts that “you create your own reality” to those who would judge the speaker for his unwillingness to conform to religious and social dogma. “The Handshake” questions a gesture that represents civility and respect in our culture as nothing substantive; participants in this ritual merely hide their “restrained passion, mistrust, and bigotry” to enable the continuation of a world where “there’s no harmony just class and race.” “Individual” and “Inner Logic” deconstruct the mechanics of power that have hijacked our free will. Individuals “can’t choose anymore” because they “command exception and accept dichotomy” (“Individual”), the tools that are used by governments to sort and control their populations, as described by philosopher Michel Foucault. The “automatons with business suits clinging to black boxes” (“Inner Logic”) who have been conditioned to ignore their own inner logic are typical examples of the individual who only has the illusion of free will. However, the world described in “Stranger than Fiction” is the most terrible of all. As the world explodes into an apocalyptic calamity, “the windows are watching” while “the streets all conspire and the lamppost can’t stop crying.” Ultimately, the narrator pans life as the worst tome he has ever read. Yet the songs on Stranger than Fiction are not without hope for humanity. The sarcastic tone of “Incomplete,” “Better Off Dead,” and “21st Century Digital Boy” indicate that their jaded subjects have a limited perspective on the world that makes it difficult for them to see a way out of their current predicament. The speaker of “Better Off Dead” offers a sarcastic apology to a jaded listener who is disappointed in a world that is not always entertaining or convenient: “The next time I create the universe I’ll make sure we communicate at length” to ensure that this subject is not burned by the sun or disappointed by the moon. The speakers of “Hooray for Me,” “Slumber,” and “Tiny Voices” have more mature existential perspectives. While the speaker of “Hooray for Me” may be “unrespectable, never sensible, maybe incredible,” and “so damned irascible,” he does what he likes and invites the listener to imagine small amounts of time wherein you do not have to do anything that does not suit you. The speaker of “Slumber” reassures a young listener that his life is “historically meaningful and spans a significant time”; what matters most are the consequences of his actions. Our inner logic\n\n22 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nthat the automatons with black boxes are so good at ignoring resurfaces in “Tiny Voices,” the “screams of forgotten victims and the cries of innocence,” along with a plea to be recognized and given recompense that lives on in the unconscious mind to remind us of our humanity. Stranger than Fiction yielded four singles, including a rerecorded version of “21st Century Digital Boy” (originally released on Against the Grain, 1990) and “Infected,” which were in heavy rotation on MTV and radio. Today, “Incomplete,” “The Handshake,” “Stranger than Fiction,” and “21st Century Digital Boy” “remain some of the best-loved songs in the band’s extensive catalog.” (Weingarten et al. 2017). Stranger than Fiction is the only Bad Religion album to go Gold in the United States, and it appears at No. 18 on Rolling Stone’s “List of 50 Greatest PopPunk Albums.” To date, Bad Religion has released sixteen studio albums and several compilations, including one Christmas album (Christmas Songs 2013), and is still releasing new music and touring today. Their original fans now attend shows along with their children. Bad Religion’s most recent album, Age of Unreason (2019), addresses the political climate in the age of Trump. The 2018 single “The Kids Are Alt-Right” and its accompanying video contrast today’s alt-right youth with the children of the 1960s who protested racism, the war in Vietnam, and sexism instead of whining about their perceived loss of white male privilege. The song’s title references the Who’s 1965 anthem “The Kids Are Alright” (Blabbermouth.net 2018). BIKINI KILL: PUSSY WHIPPED Bikini Kill is a feminist punk band from Olympia, Washington. The band is known for its hardcore feminist lyrics and activism. Their body of work is relatively small: only three studio albums and two compilations. However, some of their singles were produced by punk luminaries such as Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat and Fugazi and Joan Jett. Bikini Kill played an integral role in starting the underground feminist punk riot grrrl movement: their song “Rebel Girl” is the unofficial riot grrrl anthem. Founded in 1990 by Kathleen Hanna (front woman and songwriter), Tobi Vail (drums), Billy Karren (guitar), and Kathi Wilcox (bass), Bikini Kill quickly developed a reputation for creating women-centric environments at their shows with their “girls to the front” policy. They asked that men in the audience move to the sides to allow women in the coveted space at the front of the stage. Some men still make it uncomfortable for women to attend punk shows by aggressively moshing in the\n\nMust-Hear Music 23\n\naudience and even groping women who are at the front of the stage, where they can interact with the band. Hanna has been described as “one of America’s greatest living rock performers,” with a singing style similar to the X-Ray Spex’s Poly Styrene (Frere-Jones 2012). Bikini Kill was indirectly founded on the advice of Kathy Acker, author of the cult classic novel Blood and Guts in High School. Hanna met Acker at a writers’ workshop in 1990 while she was an art student at Evergreen State University and doing spoken word performances. Acker advised the young Hanna to instead start a band to communicate her ideas because “nobody goes to spoken word, nobody likes spoken word,” and “there’s more of a community for musicians than for writers” (Marcus 2014, 47). The band’s name is a reference to the 1967 B-film The Million Eyes of Sumuru, in which an evil woman attempts to achieve world dominance with her army of brainwashed, bikini-clad women that she dispatches to kill her enemies. Vale said that she liked the phrase “bikini kill” because it “encapsulated the nexus of sexiness and violence” (Marcus 2014, 47). Bikini Kill’s songs are about “issues central to Riot Grrrl such as rape, domestic abuse, women’s health, sexuality . . . and female empowerment” (Dunn 2011, 35). “Rebel Girl,” the band’s best-known song, celebrates women’s relationships with one another as empowering. Like many Bikini Kill songs, “Rebel Girl” works by subverting audience expectations of genre. The song’s opening lines prepare listeners for what would seem to be a catty takedown of “that girl” who “thinks she’s the queen of the neighborhood” because she “holds her head up so high.” But the next lines of “Rebel Girl” do not slut shame this woman for falling outside the boundaries of normative femininity. Instead, the singer wants to be the Rebel Girl’s “best friend” because she admires her attitude. Devin Faraci describes the lyric “that girl she thinks she’s the queen of the neighborhood / I’ve got news for you. She is!” as “one of the most exciting, immediate and electrifying declarations of sisterhood” ever, “a battle cry for togetherness and friendship” (2013). But the singer’s feelings for the Rebel Girl are deeper than those in most women’s same-sex friendships. The line that discusses tasting the revolution in the girl’s kiss implies that perhaps the singer and the Rebel Girl are lovers. But that oversimplification of their relationship is destroyed by the singer’s response to imaginary others who say that the Rebel Girl is a lesbian. Hanna responds with an affirmation, completing the sentence in the next line when she says that the girl is her best friend. In the song’s final lines, where Hanna declares that she loves the Rebel Girl as she would a sibling, she is defying societal pressures\n\n24 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nthat undermine women’s bonds with one another. The Rebel Girl is that strong girlfriend that every woman should have because her example inspires other women to hold their heads up high and be there for each other. Although “Rebel Girl” was never a top-selling single, it came in at No. 27 on Rolling Stone’s list of “Most Excellent Songs of Every Year since 1967.” “Rebel Girl” was released as an EP, on the LP Pussy Whipped, and a single in 1993 and was produced by Joan Jett, who is featured on guitar and backing vocals. It is also musically and thematically representative of Bikini Kill’s body of work. Other songs on Pussy Whipped similarly challenge patriarchy and promote sisterhood among women: “Blood One” and “Tell Me So” explore how language is used to subordinate women. “Your alphabet is spelled with my blood,” screams Hanna in “Blood One,” defying language that is used to shape reality and control women. In “Tell Me So,” she instructs a man who is looking at her to “take out a piece of paper” and “write everything down” so that he can read it back and possibly hurt her. In “Sugar,” she refuses to “play girl to your boy” anymore and mimic her partners’ fantasies until he takes care of her sexual needs, and she rejects a man’s pressure to have sex with him in “Star Bellied Boy.” “Alien She” contrasts the singer with the woman that she is expected to be: the alien she who is her “Siamese twin” wants her “to put the pretty, pretty red lipstick on.” “Lil Red” reimagines Little Red Riding Hood as a woman who can protect herself instead of being a victim. She has “ruby red lips, the better to suck you dry,” and “long red nails, the better to scratch out your eyes.” During Bikini Kill’s eight-year career (1990–1997), harassment occurred at their shows by men who resented their feminism and their “girls to the front” policy. These hecklers shouted obscenities and threw bottles and even chains at the band as a way of enforcing their masculine privilege (Brockes 2014). Hanna was known for answering back midshow to hecklers and would even “wade into the audience and physically remove” them from the venue if they were too disruptive (Brockes 2014). The band left Olympia for Washington, DC, in 1992 to find a base of operations that was more receptive of their art. Kathi Wilcox described DC in the 1990s as having “activist-friendly punk scene” with audiences that “understood the band perfectly” (Richards 2012). DC’s environment was a marked contrast to other places, where they played to audiences “that had never heard rock songs about rape, domestic violence, empowerment and equality” (Richards 2012). When Bikini Kill toured\n\nMust-Hear Music 25\n\noutside of DC, however, they were increasingly harassed by anti-feminist men in the audience. The mainstream media contributed to this escalation by painting Hanna as a two-dimensional character, falsely labeling her as a victim of sexual abuse or recounting that she had worked as a stripper to discredit the band’s feminist message, so the band had to issue a media blackout in 1993 (O’Falt 2013). Hanna recounts that “people hated us—and it was really, really hard to be in that band” (Burbank 2015). Nevertheless, Bikini Kill persisted in performing because they “wanted to make sure other girls found out about feminism” and how it was relevant to their lives (Brockes 2014). Eventually, the band members became too burned out to perform: “Fiercely committed to punk’s do-it-yourself ethos, the band became a cipher with no support system. No manager. No booking agent. Not even a roadie” (Richards 2012). They also had to remove hecklers because the venues they played had little or no security to do the job for them. Bikini Kill officially disbanded in 1997. Hanna went on to start the female electronic punk band Le Tigre and, later, Julie Ruin, a band that Wilcox also joined. Even though Bikini Kill disbanded, the number of fans continued to grow. Documentaries about the band, such as It Changed My Life (1993) and The Punk Singer (2013), about Hanna as a musician and activist, cemented Bikini Kill’s reputation as an influential punk band. “Summoned back to life by the boiling heat of today’s political moment” (Rupert 2019), Bikini Kill reunited in 2019 to play several sold-out all ages shows in Los Angeles and New York City and Riot Fest in Chicago, where fans brought their children, who had grown up singing the lyrics to the anthems “Rebel Girl” and “Double Dare Ya” (Alexander 2009). BLACK FLAG: DAMAGED The California punk band Black Flag was “America’s first hardcore band” (Robbins 2018), and they contributed “significantly to the development of this genre in the 1980s” (Kholi 2015). They also “played an essential role in the development and popularization of American punk” (Robbins 2018) and were one of several hardcore bands to play math rock, a type of music that is “is so uneven and rhythmically complex, that it feels mathematical in nature” (Schnipper 2017). Black Flag’s sound is “a ferocious, edgy, and ironic amalgam of underground aesthetics and gut-pounding metal” (Erlewine n.d., “Black Flag”), which they were playing approximately fifteen years before “the fusion of punk and metal became popular” (Erlewine n.d., “Black Flag”).\n\n26 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nFounded in 1977 by guitarist and songwriter Greg Ginn, Black Flag was quickly widely regarded as the hardest-working band in punk due to their daily practice schedule and ceaseless touring to every area of the United States. The touring in particular helped Black Flag quickly build up an underground fan base, many of whom started their own bands after Black Flag showed them how to use a “DIY system of networking [with] likeminded bands” to “travel the country and promote music without booking agents or big time record labels” (Shaw 2014). Black Flag went through numerous personnel changes, as so many members were unwilling to adhere to Ginn’s strict practice schedules or unable to devote the time to touring across the country, though Ginn stayed with the band until their breakup in 1986. Henry Rollins, the band’s most famous vocalist, helped shape Black Flag’s hardcore sound: his “furious bellow and barely contained ferocity was the missing piece the band needed to become great” (Dougan n.d.). Rollins joined Black Flag spontaneously during a 1981 New York performance, when he jumped from the audience to the stage to sing with the band: he remained as their lead singer until 1985 (Erlewine n.d., “Black Flag”). Like Washington, DC’s Bad Brains, Black Flag found themselves blacklisted by clubs in their hometown (Los Angeles) because their fans had a reputation for trashing venues. Damaged (1981), Black Flag’s first studio album, is the best example of them as a hardcore punk band. Under Ginn’s leadership, Black Flag’s music quickly evolved on subsequent albums from hardcore to something else entirely, causing fans to complain that each successive album was a new thing entirely. Although Damaged did not receive a warm critical reception at the time of its release, it is now considered one of the definitive recordings of punk rock. Damaged was named twenty-fifth on Pitchfork’s “Top 100 Albums of the 1980s” (Carr 2002). Pitchfork’s Matthew Schnipper reflected that was an anomaly when it emerged in 1981 because “Damaged was such a leap forward for punk, the only point of reference was miles behind” (2017). But today, “thirty-five years on, Damaged still sounds absolutely berserk” (Schnipper 2017). Ginn’s songs that he wrote for Damaged “while suffused with the usual punk conceits (alienation, boredom, disenfranchisement), were capable of making one laugh out loud, especially the protoslacker satire ‘TV Party.’ Extremely controversial when it was released, Damaged endured the slings and arrows of outrageous criticism (some reacted as though this record alone would cause the fall of America’s youth) to become and remain an important document of its time” (Dougan n.d.). Damaged’s first track, “Rise Above,” is an anthem about haters of every variety: “jealous cowards [who] try to control” and distort what\n\nMust-Hear Music 27\n\nthe singer and his cohort have to say, while laughing at them behind their backs, unable to stop them. In “Police Story,” the Los Angeles Police Department takes “the rights away from all the kids” who are “fighting a war that [they] can’t win.” Damaged’s title refers to everyone who is harmed by this world, a place that seems inherently bad, as it is represented in “Padded Cell”: a “paradise fraud” filled with “straightjacket minds in line to be old.” The sufferer of “Depression,” who is going “boil over inside today,” does not believe those who tell him that “things are going to get better”; the occupant of “Room 13” needs “to hang on” and begs someone else to keep him alive because he feels incapable of saving himself. The speakers of “What I See,”“Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie,”“Damaged I,” and “Damaged II” are paralyzed by a more generalized existential angst that is communicated through Rollins’s primal scream-cum-vocals as well as the discordant throbbing noise that accompanies him. The speaker of “Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie” stands “here like a loaded gun waiting to go off”; yet, whatever he is asking for will not be sufficient to prevent him from ending up dead. The subject of “What I See” simultaneously wants “to live” while wishing he wouldn’t because he needs to connect with his emotions, but he turns his “mind off” because feeling is too painful. The subject of “Damaged II” is so emotionally numb that he does not “even wanna see.” The album’s last track, “Damaged I,” is autobiographical: Rollins sings, “My name is Henry and you’re here with me now,” reiterating the emotional pain on most of Damaged’s tracks. Other songs on Damaged describe subjects who self-medicate with alcohol (“Thirsty and Miserable,” “Six Pack,” and “No More”), television in “TV Party,” or self-harm in “Life of Pain.” “Spray Paint” is the most upbeat track on the album: it is a thirty-four-second song about the joys of free speech via vandalism. Damaged almost never saw the light of day due to a dispute with the band’s then label, Unicorn Records, a subsidiary of MCA. When Black Flag delivered their recording to Unicorn, the label refused to release the album because of its violent and profane (at the time) lyrics. But Ginn was undeterred and did an end run around Unicorn, releasing Damaged on his own label, SST records, to critical acclaim. Unicorn sued the band and SST to prevent them from using the name “Black Flag” and the band’s trademark four black bars logo, which was Unicorn’s intellectual property according to the band’s recording contract. Black Flag would not regain the use of their logo or their name until Unicorn went bankrupt in 1983 and the rights reverted back to them. In the interim, Black Flag continued to tour and release more work via SST records, but their compilation album Everything Went Black had to be released under the\n\n28 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nnames of the individual band members instead of “Black Flag” due to Unicorn’s injunction. After Damaged, Black Flag’s sound evolved from hardcore to something so “heavily experimental, incorporating elements of jazz, blues, metal, math rock,” that fans became angry because each successive album was “a new thing entirely” (Schnipper 2017). After six studio albums, several live albums, compilations, EPs and innumerable tours, Ginn decided to disband Black Flag and focus on promoting other bands on his SST label. But that was not the last of Black Flag. They reunited in 2003 and again in 2013 for benefit shows for cats, one of Ginn’s favorite causes (Nichols 2003). BLONDIE: PLASTIC LETTERS Those who only know Blondie from their third studio album, Parallel Lines, more than likely do not think of them as a punk band. The singles from this album are better classified as New Wave, pop, or anything else that is not punk rock. “Sunday Girl” is a sweet and sad pop song, while “Heart of Glass,” also known as the disco song, is as far from punk as a band can get. “Picture This,” “I’m Gonna Love You Too,” “Hanging on the Telephone,” and “One Way or Another” have a punk-pop feel, but producer Mike Chapman gave Parallel Lines a commercial, overproduced sound that is the antithesis of punk. Too, all of Blondie’s music draws on multiple genres, including 1960s pop, glam rock, rockabilly, blues, and New Wave, and is not as openly angry and defiant as that of their 1970s punk cohorts, such as the Sex Pistols or the Clash. Further, Blondie does not look like a punk band, whose members typically dress in ripped T-shirts and jeans or fetish wear that identifies them as wholly anti-establishment. Front woman Deborah Harry looks like a modern-day pinup girl, with her full lips and trademark blonde hair that gives the band its name, and her male bandmates, with their black leather jackets and retro haircuts, look more like updated versions of juvenile delinquents, a style that became extremely fashionable in the early 1980s. Blondie regularly performed at the New York club CBGB, the epicenter of the emergent punk rock scene of 1970s and 1980s New York, hosting acts that included the Ramones, Television, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Harry was the unofficial pinup girl of John Hillstrom’s Punk Magazine, appearing in cartoon form in every issue. Blondie was the American counterpart of the British band Siouxsie and the Banshees, another early punk band with a female lead.\n\nMust-Hear Music 29\n\nGraffiti artist Shepard Fairey’s mural of Blondie at 316 Bowery in New York City, directly across from from the location of legendary club CBGB. Fairey, whose first art show was at CBGB in 1998, created the mural as a tribute to the club and one of its legendary performers. (Bigapplestock/Dreamstime.com)\n\nBlondie’s music is punk (as well as New Wave, 1960s pop, and glam rock, among others) in how Harry’s performance of the songs subverts the conventions of gender and genre and destabilizes bourgeois sensibilities. So, for example, what seems to be a sweet pop love song (such as “Denis” or “Sunday Girl” from Parallel Lines) seethes with the emotions that are unsung by Harry but implied by her blonde sex kitten appearance and husky femininity, which communicate something more dangerous below the surface. The nameless nice girls who are the subjects of “Sunday Girl” and “Denis” cannot openly acknowledge their sexuality or only do so in the most innocent way to remain within their narrow gender role. “Sunday Girl” can only be patient rather than take direct action, because if she goes out with the guy she really likes, her parents will be upset. Yet, being a nice girl has a painful price for “Sunday Girl,” whose guy is seen hanging out with another girl after “Sunday Girl” has turned him down for a date too many times.\n\n30 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nIn “Denis,” the protagonist can only rhapsodize about her beloved’s “eyes so blue” as a stand in for whatever else she might like about him. “Denis” is a cover of the 1963 single “Denise” by Randy and the Rainbows, in which a male singer blandly croons about his love for a girl in a straightforward pop song way. However, the singer’s sex is important in both versions. In “Denise,” the male singer’s intentions might range from innocent teenage love to those of a cad because a man is not unsexed by any expressions of heterosexual desire. In Blondie’s cover of the original, the meaning is altered by a female singer. As love culminating in marriage is still thought of as the crowning achievement of stereotypical womanhood, the stakes are higher, and the female singer’s love for “Denis” is the perceived as the natural trajectory of a woman’s life. When Harry performed “Sunday Girl” on Top of the Pops (1978) and “Denis” in the band’s video, she danced and dressed in a way that thwarted attempts to objectify her. The X-Ray Spex’s Poly Styrene appeared on stage with braces on her teeth and a black garbage bag as a dress so she would not be perceived as a sex symbol. Harry, on the other hand, was conventionally glamorous, with her red lipstick and blonde hair, but she refused to perform as a stereotypical sex object. She did not so much dance during these performances but instead moved her hips and snapped her fingers in time to the rhythm. Lest anyone confuse her with the “Sunday Girl” that she sang about on Top of the Pops, Harry wore a suit and tie. For the band’s video of “Denis,” Harry dressed in a striped one-piece swimsuit similar to the one worn by the original Barbie, but she draped an oversized jacket over her right shoulder as a way of stopping any attempts to objectify her. She also disrupted objectification by looking directly at the camera rather than at a point outside of the frame, which broke the illusion of control. Plastic Letters is a better representation of Blondie as a punk band than the better-known Parallel Lines because more of its songs have a harder edge. Plastic Letters did not enjoy the commercial success of Parallel Lines, and it was panned by critics because they really did not know how to classify Blondie’s music. Kit Rachalis, writing for Rolling Stone in 1982, complained that Plastic Letters was “a B grade production” whose songs were garish and predictable, yet the reviewer seems to be genuinely confused about how Blondie fits into any musical genre, let alone punk. Rachalis was particularly annoyed by what she described as Blondie’s celebration of seediness in “titles that scream headlines,” such as “Bermuda Triangle Blues (Flight 45),” “Youth Nabbed as Sniper,” and “Contact in Red Square” (Rachalis 1982).\n\nMust-Hear Music 31\n\nWhat Rachalis failed to appreciate is that Blondie’s “celebration of seediness” is an important component of punk. The desperate teen subject of “Youth Nabbed as Sniper” is not so different from the people in the Clash’s “Police and Thieves” or “I Fought the Law”: all feel that they are trapped by circumstances that can only be overcome through violence. That is the case in “Detroit 442,” one of Blondie’s punkier songs, in which the protagonist can only find freedom from the “concrete factory” where she works “on the plant assembly line” by cruising the streets of Detroit with Jimmy O (possibly Detroit-native Iggy Pop, whose real name is James Osterberg). “Detroit 442” is characterized by Clem Burk’s hard drumming as well as James Destri’s use of bass notes on the piano, giving the song a restless and angry feel. An unlucky wealthy tourist disappears into the ocean in “Bermuda Triangle Blues (Flight 45).” The Bermuda Triangle is a mythical place over the Atlantic that supposedly sucks planes from the sky into a whirling vortex. It is an implacable natural force as powerful as the social and political forces that shape human lives. “Contact in Red Square” and “Cautious Lip” conjure up noir detective fiction, except the women in these songs defy the noir feminine stereotype of dizzy dames that need to be slapped, kissed, or rescued. Instead, the women in these songs are strong and dangerous women. The Soviet spy who is the subject of “Contact in Red Square” is a femme fatale on a mission from the Kremlin, while the speaker of “Cautious Lip” is biding her time until the person behind the cautious lip is vulnerable due to his overconfidence. The subject of “I Didn’t Have the Nerve to Say No” will die before she lets someone who caught her in a vulnerable moment control her. The title character of the bouncy rockabilly song “Kidnapper” is about to discover that ransoming the thirteen-year-old girl that he has seduced and abducted was a bad idea. The girl “bitches like a brat,” and the kidnapper is very likely to end up dead or in jail instead of rich. Harry takes on a femme fatale persona in other tracks. The female subjects of “No Imagination” and “Love at the Pier” objectify men and toss them away after they have served their purposes. The speaker is not even able to be intimate with her imaginary partner, a stranger whose “tanned oily body” looks sinful, because when he takes a dip in the ocean to cool off, she walks away as she “saw [him] yelling.” Because it is too hot outside, she leaves instead of finding a lifeguard to rescue him from drowning. Plastic Letters is significant for Blondie because it was their first original release on Chrysalis Records, and it popularized the band in Europe while they were still mostly a cult favorite in the United States. The\n\n32 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nalbum shows a broad mix of styles, and most of the songs are three minutes or shorter. Plastic Letters shows the band’s growth since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1976, and it placed them on the U.S. and U.K. charts for the first time. The album sold enough copies in the United Kingdom to be certified Platinum. BUZZCOCKS: SINGLES GOING STEADY The Buzzcocks were one of the earliest queercore groups, playing songs that were “bisexual” (Reynolds 2018), like the band’s front man, Pete Shelley (Peter McNeish). Similar to other early British punk outfits, the future members of the Buzzcocks, Shelley and Howard Devoto (Howard Trafford), decided to form a band in 1975 after seeing a Sex Pistols show. Shelley and Devoto hit upon the band’s name “from the chance conjunction of words in a magazine headline about the buzz-worthy TV show Rock Follies, a rock-biz satire featuring a tough-girl singer who cheekily addressed everyone as ‘cock’” (Reynolds 2018). A year later, the Buzzcocks would tour with the Sex Pistols as their opening band and release their first EP, Spiral Scratch. However, the Buzzcocks were not “a carbon copy of the music of Johnny Rotten.” Although they “played with the same frantic amphetamine energy as [their] early punk cohorts,” front man Shelley “belted out anthems of frustrated love and romance” (Swenson 2018) rather than anarchy or geopolitics. Their music was “anchored in catchy melodies that were directly influenced by the Beatles,” and Shelley’s “highpitched voice was a direct contrast to Joe Strummer’s bark or Rotten’s acid screech” (Swenson 2018). Buzzcocks’ guitarist, Steve Diggle, reflected how Shelley’s songwriting “expanded what punk ‘could be and what it could mean’” (Reynolds 2018) to influence later bands, such as Hüsker Dü, who brought “a sensitivity to American hardcore that hadn’t been present prior,” and created “a template that every C-86 and indie pop band that followed would owe a debt to” (McMahon 2018, “Pete Shelley”). When Devoto left the Buzzcocks before they became famous, Shelley became the band’s front man and chief songwriter. Shelley was an unusual front man due to his “sheer ordinariness” (Reynolds 2018). When Shelley was seen “in the glitzy TV context of Top of the Pops” with “his open-neck button-shirts and slightly shaggy hair, he looked like neither a punk nor a pop star, but more like an office clerk on his lunch break. And he sang like one too” (Reynolds 2018). It is commonly believed that Shelley took his stage name from the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley: however, Tony Wilson, the founder\n\nMust-Hear Music 33\n\nof Factory Records, explains that Shelley’s stage name had its origins in what his parents planned on naming him if he had been a girl (McMahon 2018). “That invocation of the she that he might have been connects to a genuine innovation that Shelley introduced to rock, and that reflected his fluid sexuality: the deliberate use of gender non-specific pronouns in love songs,” a rhetorical trope that “would hugely influence later lyricists like Morrissey” (Reynolds 2018). The band’s third album, Singles Going Steady (1979), “would go down as [the Buzzcocks’] definitive statement” (Swenson 2018); today it is ranked No. 6 on Rolling Stone’s “List of 50 Greatest Pop-Punk Albums” (Weingarten) and No. 16 on Pitchfork’s “Best Albums of the 1970s” list (Plagenhoef 2004). Originally released in 1979, Singles Going Steady collects the band’s singles that were unaffiliated with any of their prior albums. The album’s first track, “Orgasm Addict” (1977), was their debut single, but it did not chart due to its frank references to masturbation and bisexuality, which got it banned from the airwaves by the BBC. Although the BBC’s censorship of “Orgasm Addict” gave it credibility among punks, Shelley would later state that it was the only one of his compositions that he would “listen to and . . . shudder” (McMahon 2018, “Buzzcocks”) with embarrassment. Three tracks on Singles Going Steady illustrate how Shelley reinvented modern romance in his songs: “all the old kinds of romance are selfdestructive because they don’t take account of realities” (Reynolds 2018), Shelley explained in a 1978 interview in NME. Shelley’s reinvention of modern romance “was a radical mundanity, using pained humor to sketch scenarios of humiliation, inadequacy and shortfall, coupled with melody that promised resolution or transcendence” (Reynolds 2018). The band’s second single, “What Do I Get?,” describes a state of “perpetual unfulfillment”: the answer to the question stated in the title is “sleepless nights in an empty bed.” The speaker of “I Don’t Mind” is a “pathetic clown” who will “keep hangin’ around.” And the aim of “You Say You Don’t Love Me” “is clarity achieved through a kind of positive disillusionment, serene acceptance of things as they are” (Reynolds 2018). “Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve)” continues the theme of unrequited love and is a fan favorite as well as the Buzzcocks’ biggest U.K. chart hit. Originally released on Love Bites, “Ever Fallen in Love” is a “bisexual punk anthem” inspired by a man with whom Shelley lived for seven years, although Shelley’s “use of gender-neutral pronouns meant the song really could be about anyone” (McMahon 2018, “Buzzcocks”). “Ever Fallen in Love” topped NME’s Songs of the Year list in 1978 and was later named by that publication as one of the Buzzcocks’ ten best\n\n34 Listen to Punk Rock!\n\nsongs. It has been covered by bands as diverse as Fine Young Cannibals (whose 1986 single charted higher in the United Kingdom than the Buzzcocks’ version), the Canadian punk bands Pup, and the emo band Thursday (McMahon 2018, “Pete Shelley”) as well as by Roger Daltrey (The Who), David Gilmour (Pink Floyd), Elton John, Robert Plant (Led Zeppelin), and the Futureheads, who recorded the song together for a charity tribute to the late disc jockey John Peel. After Shelley’s sudden death from a heart attack in December 2018, fans circulated a petition on Change.org to get people to download “Ever Fallen in Love” to make it No. 1 once again (Reilly 2018). Other singles collected on Singles Going Steady include “Love You More,” “Promises,” “Everybody’s Happy Nowadays,” and “Harmony in My Head.” “Love You More” and “Promises” deconstruct the clichés of erotic love. The speaker of “Love You More” is doomed from the beginning because he is “in love again.” The speaker in “Promises” goes from saying “loving you is easy” to “loving you is not easy.” The subject of “Everybody’s Happy Nowadays” distances himself from the masses named in the title because he has become “tired of being upset, always wanting something I never could get.” “Harmony in My Head” is one of the few songs sung by guitarist Steve Diggle, whose rough"
