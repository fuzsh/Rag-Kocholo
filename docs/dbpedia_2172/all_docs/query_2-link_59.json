The basis of the festival is to present “mini galleries” in the form of linear wall space or floor space in the Koch Gallery in which artists present a collection of their work. The festival welcomes both new and experienced artists with a wide breadth of work. The medium used for by the artist is as unique as the artist themselves. This year there is glass art, paintings, jewelry, metal works, mixed media, print, upcycle art, sculpture, and pottery.\n\nSAF’s schedule is slightly different than the gallery’s regular monthly rotation. It consists of three (3) ‘rounds’ during the 9-week period. A round consists of multiple solo and/or group exhibitions.\n\nShow openings are July 5, July 26, and August 16 (5pm – 8pm) and run for three (3) weeks, after which another round is installed.

Our music is acoustic and electric, a sound full of sparseness...and a warm weave of lyric and rhythm.”\n\nPete Welch, Co-Director of Vashon Events noted, “If you’re not there for this one, you’re really going to miss out.

This symbiotic relationship means that as much as you shape art, art shapes you in return.\n\nCreativity doesn't have to be confined to a canvas or a stage; it can permeate every aspect of your daily life. Being creative each day means finding beauty in the mundane and expressing yourself in everything you do. Whether it's the way you dress, the meals you cook, or the solutions you devise at work, there is an opportunity to infuse creativity into your routine. Every day offers a new chance to create something unique and meaningful.\n\nBy understanding that you are art and art is you, cultivating creativity in your daily life, and recognizing that we are all artists, you can unlock a deeper, more meaningful connection to yourself and the world around you.\n\nhttps://bit.ly/ArtBecomesYou2024\n\nGallery Hours: Wed - Sunday 12-5pm (and also during VCA performance hall events).\n\nView Event →\n\nVashon Summer Nights\n\nVashon Summer Nights blends some of the best nights of the year on Vashon.

Stupid Bike Night is organized by some pretty cool cats that include some of Vashon’s most clever contraption-makers, performers and party people. You know who they are.\n\nTown Center promises to be lined with spectators at dusk, waiting to welcome the stupid bikes along their loop winding through town and up and down Vashon Highway.\n\nThe parade of bicycles features dozens of riders tooling through town on outlandish forms of tricked-out, lit-up, pedal-powered means of transportation — including a flame-throwing bicycle equipped with a working bar and grill, flower and foliage-festooned bikes and trikes, and chariots pulled along by giant wooden unicorns and circus horses.\n\nYou'll see wild, colorful costumes of the riders: disco attire, space suits, neon wigs, gladiator garb, Amish country clothing, giant baby clothes, glow lights and glitter. Some of the bikes even haul musicians, creating a cacophonous ensemble that is more “Mad Max Fury Road” meets Dr. Seuss than an actual band. No one seems to be even trying to play the same song, with drummers, electric guitarists and horn players independently banging, blowing and blaring their music. It's the Vashon way folks.\n\nOh yeah, did we mention that ANYONE can participate?

He holds the title of Professor Emeritus at both Seattle University and the University of Wyoming. Dr. Hubbell’s interest in authoritarianism began during his high school years in apartheid South Africa. As a Fulbright Scholar and academic, he has studied authoritarianism extensively in the United States and has also conducted research, taught, and consulted in numerous countries, including Russia, China, Taiwan, Cambodia, Indonesia, South Africa, Sierra Leone, North Macedonia, Lithuania, and Dominica.\n\nTalk #1: \"Why don’t I know about Eugene Debs?\" outlines the foundational concepts of authoritarianism and traces its development in American history, from the Federalist Papers to the Constitution’s efforts to limit presidential power, and how the scope of the presidency expanded during the 20th century.\n\nTalk #2: “When the Shoe Fits” examines the defining traits of authoritarian leaders and how these characteristics show up in the current American political landscape.\n\nTalk #3: “The Apostles” focuses on enablers of authoritarianism, including key individuals, the Republican Party, the Supreme Court, and the Electoral College, and how these entities have supported or facilitated authoritarian tendencies.\n\nTalk #4: “The Great and Powerful Oz” explores the structural and psychological factors that attract people to leaders like Donald Trump and touches on Project 2025 and its implications.\n\nTalk #5: “All In” In the final session, a panel of politically engaged citizens will analyze the 2024 presidential and down-ballot elections. This discussion will consider the broader implications of these elections in the context of rising authoritarianism.\n\nAuthoritarianism Rising talks are offered free with preregistration. We welcome donations to offset expenses.\n\nView Event →\n\nNew Volunteer Recruitment Session\n\nNew Volunteer Recruitment Session\n\nVashon Heritage Museum\n\n10105 Bank Road SW, Vashon\n\nSaturday, September 21st\n\n10:00 a.m.\n\nInterested in volunteering at the Island's historical museum?

The community wholeheartedly embraced the giant trash Troll on his Pt. Robinson Park throne, and now we have Oscar’s story.\n\nDrawing on his own quirky imagination and a plethora of Scandinavian folklore, playwright Bryan Willis wrote a fanciful play about how Oscar got to be Vashon’s Bird King. Vashon Repertory Theatre’s (VRT) Charlotte Tiencken was charmed by Willis’ script, and she convinced VHS’s Andy James to direct it. And now -- from August 23 to 25 -- VRT will stage Oscar’s Journey, The Fall and Rise of the Bird King outdoors in VCA’s Heron Meadow.\n\nIn this delightful production, some of Vashon’s finest performers -- young and not so -- will tell the bizarre story of Oscar’s origins from baby troll to his regal status among the trees at Pt. Robinson Park. As soon as director Andy James dubbed the play ‘deeply stupid,’ Island actors flocked to auditions. With each actor playing multiple parts, the cast includes Brian Palermo, Steven Sterne, Michael Wishkoski, Holly Johnson, Kaycie Alanis, Maya Krah, and Kenny Alton. They are joined by youth actors Leo Watson as Oscar, Indigo Alton, Lily Feveyear, and Utisah Durahim as Ingrid.\n\nCostumer Jennifer Matthews was drawn to the play from as far away as Tennessee and Island newcomer Brooke Osment will construct the set from found materials, in keeping with Dambo’s Earth-friendly approach to constructing his 139 outsize trash trolls placed in 19 states across the U.S.\n\nThe play is interactive and kid friendly with plenty of humor for adults and a gentle message for all. Oscar’s Journey, The Fall and Rise of the Bird King will be punctuated with original, joyful music created and performed by Vashon’s own Kat Eggleston, accompanied by Mark Graham.\n\nPerformances are Friday, August 23—6:30pm, Saturday, August 24—4pm + 6:30pm, and Sunday, August 25—4pm. Admission is Pay What You Will with a suggested donation of $20.\n\nThe play is just one hour long, and audience members are asked to bring their own chairs or blankets as well as their own non-alcoholic beverages.\n\nFor more information, go to www.vashonrepertorytheatre.org\n\nView Event →\n\nCHEAP SCENERY & DUMDUMS\n\nCHEAP SCENERY\n\nDUMDUMS\n\nPunk Rock at the Vashon Sugar Shack\n\nSaturday, August 24th\n\n7:30pm\n\nCheap Scenery plays classic punk from your youth.\n\nDumdums play kick ass originals from your future.\n\nView Event →\n\nVittoria Donda\n\nVittoria Donda\n\nSnapdragon\n\nSaturday, August 24th\n\n7:00pm\n\nView Event →\n\nVashon HouseHold \"Raise the Roof\" Summer Concert & Fundraiser\n\nVashon HouseHold \"Raise the Roof\" Summer Concert & Fundraiser\n\nFeaturing Saint Ophelia\n\nSaturday August 24th at 5:30pm\n\nDig Deep Gardens\n\n19028 Vashon Highway SW\n\nLet's \"Raise the Roof\" together in support of affordable housing on Vashon Island!

The weather today is wet and cold and there's just too much at risk with thousands of dollars’ worth of sound equipment on the line. Even a slight chance of rain causes us to be extremely cautious. And let's face it, sitting on wet grass for two hours in 60-degree weather is not very comfortable.\n\nThe address for Vashon Center for the Arts is 19600 Vashon Hwy SW, Vashon, WA 98070.\n\nThis is still a FREE concert with a wonderful Motown band. Doors at VCA will be at 6:00pm, locals Rob Hotchkiss & Dianne Krouse will open the show at 7:00pm and then The Jewel Tones will take the stage at 7:30pm. VCA holds about 300 people, so it will be first come, first serve in terms of seating. Unfortunately, others will be turned away once the room is full.\n\nSadly, Iyad's Syrian Grill will not be there tonight, but the Concession stand will be open this evening at VCA.\n\nWe understand how disappointing this can be for some - believe me, we are disappointed that we can't have this in the Park tonight, but there's so much to do to prepare for the show..we had to make a decision early on. Vashon Center for the Arts is a beautiful venue and we are so fortunate that they are letting us move the show there. A huge thank you to Jesse, Allison and the VCA staff.

Foster adds, “Miyazaki’s movies have strong, well written, female leads and strong environmental messages.

Concerts will be held every Thursday night in August from 7:00pm - 9:00pm.\n\nConcerts in the Park is a family friendly series of events that bring the community together to enjoy free outdoor music concerts. Taking place at Ober Park, which is located between the Vashon Public Library and the Vashon Park District, the park features grassy berms that make perfect amphitheater seating. You are invited to bring a blanket or lawn chair to enjoy the music.\n\nSound equipment and lighting will be provided by Laird Gonter of Bandstand Music Inc, and Martin Feveyear of Feveyear Master/Mix will be dialing in the sound. Enjoy live music performing against one of Vashon's most beautiful outdoor backdrops and bring the family. There's plenty of grass and natural berms to spread out those picnic blankets and enjoy some wonderful music on a warm summer night.\n\nHowever, your blanket or chair may not get much use because each concert features a different music genre that will keep you dancing. Each concert presents something new to experience!\n\nThird up in the concert series on August 15th is Adrian and Meredith! Rogue-folk music duo and band “Adrian and Meredith” have always marched to the beat of their own drum, unapologetic in the art they create. Since joining forces in 2015, they have put their own spin on Americana music, embodying the spirit of the human story through influences of punk, folk, polka, and swing. Their lively concerts inspire audiences to dance, clap, and stomp along.\n\nIn 2023, Adrian and Meredith toured over 100 shows across the USA, Canada, and Europe. They supported acts such as Steve'n'Seagulls, Shawn James, Jimbo Mathus, and Th'Legendary Shackshakers. They also performed at festivals like Blissfest, Wheatland Festival, and 30A Songwriters Festival. Additionally, they played prestigious venues including Performing Art Centers and Levitt Shell Pavilions nationwide. Now, six years after their debut, Adrian and Meredith are taking their fearless, blistering, Balkan-tinged Americana sound to new heights - a raucous yet intimate variety show. The new record draws in listeners with the duo's warmth, intensity and candidness - imparting an easy sense of joy and kinship in turbulent times.\n\n2024 promises more touring, music, and revelry as this duo continues marching to their own rhythm. They plan to release a series of new songs recorded at Dial Back Records in Oxford, MS with members of bands like Squirrel Nut Zippers, Punch Brothers, Mighty Poplar, and with Jimbo Mathus.\n\nTheir band has been described as “elements of klezmer, power pop, ska, New Orleans swing and a touch of blues rock just for good measure...with enthusiasm and oodles of charm...includes romantic joys and dramas, the vagaries of getting old and the theft of a keishka. Have fun with this one! (Paste Magazine)\"\n\nCome see what No Depression aptly calls “A barn-burner of Roots Rock Perfection!” https://adrianandmeredith.com/\n\nOpening for the Adrian & Meredith will be Vashon locals Shawn & Colette Jones. Colette Jones is a singer, songwriter, and musician from Washington State, formerly based in Nashville, TN.\n\nA lifelong daydreamer, she grew up enveloped in songs and stories. Her musical journey has taken her from playing power chords in a punk band to Travis Picking folk songs and singing old country ballads. She found her footing in Americana music, through which she could combine her interests in storytelling and performance. Since then she's had the pleasure of collaborating with many wonderful musicians on a variety of projects, as well as foraying into the world of musical theater.\n\nDuring a transformative tenure in Nashville, Colette polished up her catalog of original songs, and with the help of some of Music City's finest, etched them into two full-length studio albums. Her debut, Deluge, intertwines classic country and Americana sounds, while infused with an ethereal and bluegrass drive. The tracks unfold as tales of love and loss, addiction, heartache, and an overarching theme of “searching for a way home,” as Colette sings in the opening lines of the first track, \"Unfound.\" The album skillfully walks the line between blues-rock on tracks like \"Secret Life,\" and a rebellious “outlaw country” spirit as showcased on tracks such as \"Fever Dream\" and \"Train Song.\" The follow up, TBA, builds on these themes, with honky-tonk and cosmic country influences. The first track, “How’s That Workin’ For Ya Now” is available to stream on bandcamp.\n\nColette is a passionate conduit of roots music, Americana, classic country, and all that in between. She has studied ethnomusicology and folklife both academically and as a hobbyist, and through her research and love of this music, strives to bring authenticity and honesty to the stories she sings, honoring the diverse ancestors and history of country music as it is brought into a new era.\n\nStream Deluge wherever you listen to music.
