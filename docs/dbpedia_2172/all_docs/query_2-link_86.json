        "text": "I guess that post didn't actually say what I intended at all. Perhaps I should have said that is was a different eclectic explosion of bands!\n\nI have a lot of records by American bands contemporary with the likes of The Clash, XTC, Elvis Costello et al and they are great, but the very nature of the music scenes at the time meant that it it did not necessarily translate across the ocean and that applies in both directions. There were a lot of social and political overtones in the UK punk scene which would mean very little in America and I am sure vice versa. There was tremendously original music from both sides of the pond, so apologies if any offense was perceived. It was not my intention at all.\n\nThere is a five CD set of primarily UK (although it does include American bands too) punk/new wave music that appeared in 1999, entitled '1, 2, 3, 4 Punk and New Wave 1079 - 1079' that perhaps gives an overview of the period and goes some way to setting some parameters as they were some distance from the time but close enough for memories to be relatively clear. There is an extensive booklet included with the box that includes an interesting essay by Pete Gardiner that discusses the period. I have not re-read the whole of it yet but here are a few lines that detail his view of 'New Wave' which I think matches the general opinion of it as a term from the period:\n\n\"The 'new wave' was the inevitable watering down of punk, a more acceptable face for the record companies and media to present to the public. Nevertheless, this secondary push was also responsible for a glut of innovative music and great live bands and allowed many acts to be assimilated into the mainstream.\"\n\nYou have to remember that at the time, punk rock was seen as public enemy number one in the UK with the Sex Pistols being held up up as every parent's worse nightmare, corrupting the youth of the country, and that they were banned from playing extensively by local authorities across the country. In reality punk was just exciting rock 'n' roll music for a new generation of kids looking for something new and that was 'their' music. New Wave represented a way to make the music more acceptable to a wider audience. In reality it was just a label to make some people's lives easier and enable record companies to make money without upsetting what would have in a previous generation been 'the suits'.\n\nHere is the track listing for the set referred to above:\n\n1.
