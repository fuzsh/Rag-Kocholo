        "text": "1.\n\nIn the Beginning 01:08\n\nThey thought they'd steal the election / we fucking caught them red handed / instead of just a slap on the wrist / we fucking cut their hands off. // They cried in mortal terror / all their evil hadn't prepared them / for a populace sick of their shit / whose patience had ran out. // In the beginning / we could have seen it as an honest mistake / but over time / we saw your hate.\n\n2.\n\nFour Long Years 02:40\n\nFour long years we've been waiting / four long years our friends were scared / four long years of seeing true colors fly / four long years expelling family / four long years sorting through lies / four long years and it's finally our time. // Can you believe the shit they fed us? / Can you believe we ate it up? / Can you believe how long they got away with it? / It's some rich fucks wanting power at anyone's expense / and their uppins will be coming soon enough. // The hypocrites, the sycophants, the willfully ignorant / you've dug a grave for yourselves. / The charlatans, the born agains, snake handling lunatics / by our hands you'll meet your god. // Arrogant motherfucker / thought he'd weasel out of it’ll / be on the business end first. / Cut off both his thumbs and tongue / then death by a thousand cuts / as his disciples watch in awe.\n\n3.\n\nThe Least of Us 02:36\n\nWe kept our cool for a day or two as we figured out what to do / our bloodthirst stayed with calm and reason. / Out of the planning stage we made haste, the goober state first in line, / we won't stop 'til we find everyone complicit. // \"Bring them the world they brought on the least of us?\" / \"Bring them the world they brought on the least of us.\" // You heard someone heard from someone who heard that we'd been considering mercy / Well that someone - they heard wrong. / Dude, the irony isn't lost on me - that was your justification forever - Your god can't save you now. // For every time you were in a place to speak up, but instead followed your flock / For every life destroyed from your neglect, marred by your shitty book: / Today begins the reclamation. By any means we'll salt your earth. / You may ask, \"Why do I deserve this?\" Well, your god was a dick first. // They let you breathe and ignore. / They let you pray and ignore. / They let you judge and ignore. / They let you lick the boot of anyone invoking their name. // Let’s see how well they float. / Let’s see how well they fly.\n\n4.\n\nBrand New World 02:14\n\nIt's a hell of a time to repent when you're on the chopping block. / Thin metal quickly descends and then the lights go off. / Every shit move that you made and witnessed plays back in a moment of time, / for every platitude you'd rotely say you missed the plank in your own eye. // Heads roll sweetly to their end, blood hosed off and down the drain. // If your faith causes you to be shit it's not just your faith's fault. / There's a shitty person hiding inside and they need to be cut off. // There's a reason for the culling: / what was up must come crashing down. / Notwithstanding consequences - we're trying out a brand new world. // We take it all on ourselves- judge, jury, executions / One by one you meet your fate- it's not pretty but it gets done. / Our hubris ensures our progress and trust in what we're told / for the sake of time, fuck checks and balances- we're way too right to fail. // Ignore your own intense malaise- this time end justifies the means. // Surely nothing bad can happen. / In the end we'll leave no stone unturned. / It's no small bit genocidal- we're trying out a brand new world.\n\n5.\n\nWe're somewhere between the start and the end of it all. / If you thought things were bad just wait for what's in store. / First we came for the christians, next: corrupt politicians, then we burn the whole thing down. // It'll get way way worse before it gets better / no telling how worse way worse is. / With any sense we would've stopped long ago, / but we're too fucking proud to take the loss. // You didn't ask for this- you were brought up to believe it. / I didn't ask for it either. / This just the consequence of stupid thought experiments and seeing them to their end. // If we tell ourselves that we're right enough times - we’ll start to believe it. / We're starting to believe it.\n\n6.\n\nMogul Down 01:51\n\nAll's now quiet in the west wing / there's signs of struggle everywhere: / fingernails ripped off in the carpet, / scuff marks from feet kicking at walls. / We're all gathered at the south lawn / to make sure we don't miss a thing. / Evil fucker gets what he earned / along with his whole family. // They raised concerns but I really don't care, do u? // In our haste to pass down judgement / we \"forgot\" to hone the blades. / It's not enough to know they're dead / we want to hear pained, gargled screams. / Circle up, face them inward, / put them on their fucking knees. / For their crimes against humanity we’ll fucking hack them down like trees. // They begged as they watched / their kin fall one by one / sans dignity / we showed no sympathy. / I really don't care, / you really don't care, / we really don't care, / I really don't care, do u?\n\n7.\n\nThe Gooder News 03:14\n\nBodies strewn across the landscape / heads on pikes for all to see / \"Here's our sacrifice, our attempt to save the world from itself.\" / Our smug faces read arrogance, / our giddy shrieks betray bloodlust. / There's a lesson here, but it's something we forgot // We feign that this was our intent: / To gain a ruined earth already spent. / Eye plucked out and cast away / too little too late. // Commence finger pointing for every unheeded warning. / We're not the first ones with bright ideas. / We had a feeling that we didn't go far enough / while there's still humans breathing. / So close and yet so far. // There's no hope, here comes extinction. / We'll dance into oblivion. / It sure was fun while it lasted, / but I'm pretty stoked it's done.\n\n8.\n\nThere's a billboard taking up the whole horizon / and cement as far as I can see. / There's black clouds in the sky blocking all the sunlight / there's only poison left to breathe. // In the end we'll all get what we deserve. // My skin is melting off from the acid rain and salt water is all that's left to drink. / Every thing I ever loved died before me excruciatingly. // Til every mall turns back to forest / and every church rots to the ground, / every eyesore falls to ruin / and a plague takes us all out- // In the end we'll all get what we deserve. //\n\n9.\n\nA Brief Respite 00:44\n\n10.\n\nAntediluvian 02:34\n\nIf you can kick and scream this loud I can easily stay the course / keep doing what I do best and wait for something constructive / Somewhere along the way you christened yourself a deity / and I can't say I'm surprised it's working out so far. // You take a backseat to anyone that'll take the front, ride the coattails until you feel like getting off, take the easiest route you can call your own. // A thousand reasons to stay a stick in the mud- why move when you’re cozy, safe, and cool? / If you stick your neck out your head’ll probably get cut off. Sink and sleep forever in the same old song // You wanna think no one has been here before? Try all you want but you can't ignore tales flying in from every direction. / It seems the more of yourself you give the more you wind up disappointed so apathy reigns motherfucking supreme. //\n\n11.\n\nDe Fournier Pilote 01:28\n\nIt's probably nothing but I'm dwelling all the same, / to me this kind of shit means everything. / Anxious days and restless nights spent miffed as hell though I paid lip service to forgiveness. // You let it slide, say you're alright, you're not like that all the time / you know full well that deep inside you're lying / and you're not quite strong enough to keep it up / and it takes everything you have to let it go // Lights switched off, keys in hand, with one foot out of the door / I'm still clutching my resignation. / Maybe somehow it deserves another shot / with all the sweat and tears I invested.\n\n12.\n\nHELLHOLEBOOB 02:35\n\nThe streets are cracked outside my yard / broken by the steel there lays / the grass so green. / Just like me / so unhealthy so unclean / so I’ll waste away in this hell. // Come over to our busted house it’s closer. / You hear the rats in the walls / and ditch your best friends now I’m sober... half the time. // Every friend I know / every second of this song / it’s rotting from the inside out. / Just like this old torn up house- / just like the candy taste in our mouths- / it’s just like heaven but we’ll face south.\n\n13.\n\nLaughing 03:01\n\n14.\n\nSet Up to Fail 02:32\n\nI can barely get to sleep at night- / not so subtle regrets go racing through my mind. / I know all the cards that I left on the table yesterday. // I'm grasping at any old excuse, (like i'm gonna) / I've got every shitty alibi (admit it's my fault) / for every crime committed, for every act of cruelty // We're set up to fail / we can't help but thinking we're invincible / when the odds are stacked against us, we find the worst way out. / We're set up to fail - / even our greatest feats are correlational / try as we might, at anything, our luck will soon run out. // We had time to talk shit / and to prove ourselves; / Time to talk big - fuck anyone else; / Time to ride high - straight to hell (straight to hell). // I’m slowly wasting away in place. (Always thought I'd) / Never making progress, never slowing down. (never slow down) / I'm turning into nothing- like a candle burning at both ends.\n\n15."
