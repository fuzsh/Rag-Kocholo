        "text": "Here are some thoughts on this year’s Rock’s Roll Hall of Fame inductees. Just so, you know my tastes tend to veer to what used to be called or is called alt or Indy rock.\n\nThe late 80s and early 90s were a grand period of revival for rock music (and it is not just because of Nirvana) and it is gratifying that that several so-called alt rock bands from this era were nominated. It is interesting that all three (Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and Soundgarden) were covered by Johnny Cash. In addition to these three the future might see Rage against the Machine, Jane’s Addiction, The Replacements and the Smiths (these first four were nominated before) being rewarded.\n\nIn addition, there is a chance that some other bands from that era such as Mudhoney, Hole, Sonic Youth, Oasis, Blur, Flaming Lips, and Smashing Pumpkins. Bikini Kill/Le Tigre, Pavement and Garbage will get their just rewards.\n\nOverall, all this is a good list and no high selling but completely lackluster or forgettable bands like Foreigner, Triumph (Blech) Motley Crue or REO Speedwagon were nominated\n\nEvery year the hall nominates 15 or 16 mostly deserving performers and bands and usually some of the weakest but most popular ones get in. In recent years, the nominee quality level dropped significantly as the hall emphasizes sale more overall musical significance. Musical dunderheads such as Chicago, Bon Jovi, Def Leopard, Journey and Kiss got in, so at least 20 members of the blandest, lamest bands rock have to offer will get to vote. That cannot be good.\n\nI have written the most about T Rex and The MC5 because they are the two bands this year that I think are the worthiest of getting in as well as the most overdue. Here are my opinions on the nominated acts,\n\nPat Benatar-She had a rebellious image, a cool attitude and for a while, she embodied a tough rock chick image. However, her songs, which were often co-written with her husband, Dennis (with some exceptions like Hell Is for Children), are rather formulaic and shallow. Many of her lyrics have female empowerment themes but Hit Me with Your Best Shot also has at darker S and M implications. More 80s MTV icons need to get in but is she really all that much more interesting or important than the Go Gos, Cyndie Lauper, Culture Club, Euthymics, Billy Idol or the Pet Shop Boys? I do not think so, and I would argue that Lauper’s has much better vocal range. I would certainly take Benatar over (cringe) Duran Duran or Flock of Seagulls. However, while in my eyes she is much less essential than Chrissie Hynde is Joan Jett, X Ray Spex or The Raincoats but she is still at least worthy of consideration. Her four Grammies and 30 million on record sales cannot hurt.\n\nDepeche Mode- Very entertaining and intelligent synth pop band/hit machine that did quite a few great numbers (such as Dark Celebration, Enjoy the Silence and Personal Jesus, which was covered with great success by the late Johnny Cash). People are People (along with Lady Gaga’s Born this Way) became one of the most significant gay pride anthems. Also they had a much longer shelf life (at least in an America) than their contemporaries like Human league, OMD, Tears for Fears. Heaven 17, and Thomas Dolby. They have wide critical acclaim, huge album sales, and lasting popularity (they are still a popular, working touring band.) Sure they just aren’t as nearly as innovative as Joy Division or New Order, but those bands did not sell 100 million albums like Depeche. To a certain part of the population (probably arty college students in the early 90s) they are the coolest band on the planet. Incidentally the lead singer, Gore said this about their name, “It means hurried fashion or fashion dispatch.” Dave Vavian was one of the lead singer’s biggest influences so why isn’t The Damned in?\n\nThe Doobie Brothers- The band is composed of top notch studio musicians (including some quasi Steely Dan members) with at least a dozen classic songs in their repertoire and I am surprised they never got in (I find them infinitely superior to Kiss or the dreaded Journey). The lyrics are occasionally dumb and clichéd, and Michael McDonald’s vocals annoy me. But The Doobie Brothers Are Alright with Me. Nice, economical guitar work too.\n\nWhitney Houston-She has a terrific voice and great vocal chops. Her early stuff is funky and danceable, but she basically ended up doing a type of MOR soul. But also she sold truckloads of albums probably more than most of the other inductees combined (at last count 170 million). She has had a great influence on popular culture but not so much rock culture. But in genre terms she is also the farthest thing from rock n’roll on the list and I would argue she should not get in before Rufus and Chaka Khan (or solo Khan), Diana Ross. War, solo Tina Turner or Labelle. I have no big problem with her or her work but remember the danger here is that is she gets in she might pave the way for real horrors like Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey.\n\nJudas Priest- I am showing my genre bias here but I do not usually listen to pure, undiluted metal, but this band is definitely a foundational, integral band in their genre. They do a devastatingly powerful cover of Fleetwood Mac’s Green Maharishi with a Two Prong Crown plus they helped popularize biker S and M apparel in pop music. They deserve to be in more than any other pure metal band but I prefer quasi or hybrid metal bands like Soundgarden and Motorhead. They are overdue so let us see what happens. They do not get much radio play but they have a devoted following and many bands cite them as influences. Their 50 million in album sales is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nKraftwerk-Perhaps the most original and innovative and avant garde band on this list, but I do not listen to them as much as some of the others. When Bowie and Iggy came back from Germany after meeting them they brought back the German influence and spread it all over Europe and America. Thanks to them we have Gary Numan, Klaus Nomi, Devo, tons of hip hop and Afrika Bambatta’s Planet Earth. The rock hall might not appreciate the fact they rarely sound remotely human. I do not see them getting in now but maybe in in the future if Depeche Mode breaks the electronic glass ceiling.\n\nDave Matthews Band-I like a few of their songs but they always came off as a second tier Eddie Vedder clone fronting a just ok jam band with some African music influences (but not enough to make them as interesting as Vampire Weekend let alone the real stuff like Fela Kuti or King Sunny Ade.) Matthews’ solo folk set at Farm Aid was completely underwhelming, and it was among the least impressive sets I saw at that night (John Mellencamp, Willie and Neil Young all blew him away). DMB plays mediocre low ambition post grunge/ quasi Indy rock for unimaginative yuppie college students who think that are Indy but don’t want to listen to anything too radically different. Also like Adele their many albums lack any evidence of progression or evolution. To me they will always be primarily be known as the environmentalist group most likely to throw sewage and feces on people. Also Jimmy Fallon does an infuriatingly terrible impersonation of the Matthews that is even worse than the real thing. I also strongly dislike all the performers they influenced like John Mayer, Jason Mraz, and OAR. Along with Korn, STP, Linkin Park and Limp Biscuit they are one of the main reasons I frequently turned off the radio in the late 90s. You might need to drink excessively or get stoned while playing frizzbee at a giant festival to fully appreciate them. People compare them to the Grateful Dead but the Dead had far better guitar work. I say pass, Next?\n\nThe MC5- They masterfully combined Who like hard rock aggression with free jazz (right out of Albert Ayler or Sun Ra) instrumentation paving the way for both what would become punk and heavy metal. Their intentional use of noise and their barely controlled chaotic live sets also paved the way for New York no wave. Their concerts were legendary (they even played the 1968 Democratic Convention during the riot) and some thought they were like orgies of noise than traditional music shows. There was no Jeff Beck or Jimmy Page in the band but they more than made up in raw power what they lacked in virtuosity. Fred “Sonic” Smith (with later played with his wife Patti) and Wayne Kramer were two guitar gods and the band’s two engines of destruction. it is rumored that on one day they even upstaged Cream (who were one of the best bands of their day.) Their essential story (including the banning and multiple arrests) is almost as interesting as the band’s music. The heavily influenced The Stooges and grunge movement (Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine each do versions of Kick Out the James. ) See my interview with their former manager and political guru who spent many years in jail for dubious drug charges (this inspired both John Lennon and Allen Ginsberg to do protest pieces in his honor. See my interview with him here. The most subversive and deserving band on the list.\n\nMotorhead-I do not particularly seek out heavy metal but this band needs to get in sooner or later. No one represents rock and roll attitude more than Lemmy. They combined much of the velocity and lyrical content of punk with the look, with the sound and loudness of metal which came to be called speed metal. Their tribute to the Ramomes is a classic and who could argue with Ace of Spades? They sold 15 million albums worldwide but unlike Metallica they never quite penetrated mainstream America enough to see really big amounts. Come to think of it why isn’t Hawkwind nominated?\n\nNotorious BIG- Christopher George Latore Wallace is a great storyteller and he is not just a gangsta rapper; some of his songs show surprising sensitivity and a sentimental side. If any solo rap performer from the 80s or 90s gets in it will probably be him (I think LL Cool J’s ship has sailed). I would like to see him get in but still would rather have Ice-T and Wu Tang Clan get the honor first and the mighty Outkast would be my next pick. Despite Biggie’s undeniable smooth MC skills, he has very little great material compared to the rest. He only produced two studio LPs during his lifetime and two came out after his death. But his impact and influence is undeniable. He has sold over 27 million albums in the USA alone.\n\nNine Inch Nails-I saw them twice (both in the 90s and 2000s and they blew me away each time.) Not in the strictest terms a band (but then again neither is Steely Dan) since whoever tours with Trent Reznor (who is also a great film soundtrack writer) is an honorary Nine Inch Nail. They were recently covered by Miley Cyrus of all people who also played a lead role on Black Mirror. They also made some of the most disturbingly creative videos ever including Closer which was banned on MTV. If Marilyn Manson had less flash and more talent, he would be Trent Reznor.\n\nRufus with Chaka Khan-I loved loved loved their performances on Soul Train and seeing them sing is even better than listening to them on record (the same is true of Ike and Tina Turner Review). The costumes and look of the band is visually arresting and in her prime Chaka was almost cool and she represented the 70s almost as well as Pam Grier. They do not have as much great material as some other performers on this list (unless you count Chaka’s solo work which I am not) but they actually improved on Stevie Wonder and they get points for being from Chicago. So I say yes yes yes, but the hall will probably vote no no no. Reportedly they sold 70 million or so albums.\n\nTodd Rundren- He emerged from the garage band Nazz (Open your Eyes) which was featured on the classic Nuggets, and became one of the only great studio wizards (he was a wizard and a true star) to rival Eno. He produced Patti Smith group and the punk before punk New York Dolls, and helped Grand Funk get out their greatest song. His music is somewhat schizophrenic but always provocative and compelling. He had the look of a gender bending glam rocker and his work can be divided into Beatlesque pop rock and more experimental fare. Maybe his more than mere backup band Utopia should also get in. He also has attracted a Zappa like cult of weirdos that adore him (I mean that in a good way (my old buddy Barry Twichell, the record shop owner adored him as much as Tom Waits and Zappa.)\n\nSoundgarden- They wrote Rusty Cage which helped resurrect Johnny Cash’s career. The Jesus Christ Pose song and video, which was banned from MTV, caused a huge controversy and attracted both punks and metal kids (it also inspired commentary on Beevis and Butthead). The Chris Cornell solo tracks and Soundgarden songs on the Singles soundtrack (which I still play) along with Cornell’s work on Temple of the Dog (a musical project that eventually became Pearl Jam) helped usher in the grunge/alternative rock era. They probably miscalculated by breaking up too early. They brought psychedelic and Beatles influences into heavy metal. Head On is a psych rock metal masterpiece. Their use of nontraditional tuning was completely innovative. Their Superunknown album sold 9 million copies and spawned several hits. They were the first Seattle grunge band to be on a major label, and some think that they defined grunge better than anyone else. I would place Soundgarden just slightly below .Pearl Jam and Radiohead. One of the greatest bands of the 90s. In addition, a very good live band and Kim Thayill is a fine, exciting guitarist. Music seemed to get immediately worst when they broke up the first time and this effectively ended the grunge era. I have been compulsively listening to their last two 90s era for years. Also they sure beat the hell out of later hard rock/ post grunge swill like Stone Temple Pilots, Likin Park, Korn and most of what came after them (I do like Tool.) For those keeping tack they won 2 of their 8 Grammy nominations, and a big statue of singer, Chris Cornell (who tragically hung himself a few years ago) was recently unveiled at Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture. Probably only one 90s alternative act will get in this time but it would be very hard for me to choose between this band and Nine Inch Nails. Unfortunately, they never completely got out of the shadow of Nirvana and Pearl Jam. If they get in this year can Alice in Chains and Mudhoney be far behind? Where is Pavement and Sonic Youth on the list? They are equally if not more important.\n\nThin Lizzy-Before and during much of the late 70s punk era this band helped provided a lively working class alternative to the faceless corporate rock of Foreigner, REO Speedwagon and Journey. Bass player Phil Lynott had an extraordinary voice and was a more than credible bass player, and he did some nice side work with Johnny Thunders and Steve Jones (check out So Alone it is a masterpiece). Unfortunately, even though they produced quite a bit of decent work, the band and Phil are mostly known for in the States for just two songs off of the same album (they suffer from Steppenwolf syndrome) in the US which does not exactly improve their chances.\n\nT Rex-The only reason they are not already in is anti-Brit chauvinism. They are immensely important and multitudes of artists and half of the post punk artists emulated them. If I could kick out Queen or Kiss today and replace them with T Rex, I would do so. Their fashion sense and Bolin’s effeminate vocal style which was a great antidote to the early 70s hypermascuinity of Robert Plant and Paul Rogers. Also lead singer Marc Bolan ((and some Warhol people) has a greater claim to being the father of glam rock. He needs to get in yesterday.\n\nMarc Bolan’s band started out; as acoustic folkies with mystical lyrics called Tyrannosaurus Rex, but the later T Rex version were perfect electric pop rock hit makers. No one ever has more out of the same three Chuck Berry chords. Their 1971 album Electric Warrior was the biggest selling album that year in the UK and at the time, it outsold Led Zepplin IV, Sticky Fingers and Who’s Next. Although the band lasted from 1967 to 77, their glory period lasted from 1970-74. After that, they ran out of ideas but they also did a fine final comeback record in 1976 called Dandy in the Afterlife, which seemed to foreshadow the leader, Marc Bolan’s death a year later. Some of the bands that did T Rex covers include Fratelli (Solid Gold Action), Get it On (Ministry and Power Station), 20th Century Boy (Def Leppard), Life’s a Gas (Teenage Fanclub), Buick McKane (Danzig, The Melvins and Guns N Roses), Ride a Wild Swan (Louis XIV), Cosmic Dancer (Morrissey and Bowie), and Jeepster (Red Hot Chilli Peppers). In addition, Oasis, the Black Keys, and Joan Osbourne, Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers and many others, have sampled T Rex Songs. T.Rex had sold 16 million records in less than a year and a half – around four per cent of all singles sold in the UK during that period were theirs."
