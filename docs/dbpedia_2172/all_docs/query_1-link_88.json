        "text": "When I head David Hasselhoff (or The Hoff) was putting out a new album of cover songs, I told myself that I have to listen to this for the train wreck that it is going to be. I mean The Hoff has never been popular in the States for his vocal talent and yet, I was intrigued.\n\nDavid has put together an eclectic list of covers and the most interesting part is the line-up of musicians he was able to get to assist with these covers. Let’s look at the cover songs and those individuals who helped out.\n\nTrack List:\n\nOpen Your Eyes (Feat. James Williamson of The Stooges) – Lords of the New Church Cover\n\nHead On (Feat. Elliot Easton of The Cars) – The Jesus & Mary Chain Cover\n\nI Melt With You (Feat. Steve Stevens) – Modern English Cover\n\nLips Like Sugar (Feat. A Flock of Seagulls) – Echo & The Bunnymen Cover\n\nHeroes (Feat. Composer Tyler Bates) – David Bowie Cover\n\nHere I Go Again (Feat. Tracii Guns) – Whitesnake Cover\n\nJump in My Car (Feat. Todd Rundgren) – Ted Murley Gang Cover\n\nRhinestone Cowboy (Feat. Charlie Daniels) – Glen Campbell Cover\n\nIf You Could Read My Mind (Feat. Ava Cherry) – Gordon Lightfoot Cover\n\nSugar Sugar (Feat. Steve Cropper) – The Archies Cover\n\nMit 66 Jahren (Feat. Patrick Moraz of Yes and the Moody Blues) – Udo Jurgens Cover\n\nSweet Caroline (Feat. Ministry’s Al Jourgensen) – Neil Diamond Cover\n\nThat’s Life – Frank Sinatra Cover\n\nContinue reading “David Hasselhoff – ‘Open Your Eyes’ – Album Review” →\n\nWelcome to July and the first Friday of releases. I have to admit, there isn’t any of these I am excited about so might be skipping this week. I am guess that it this is the week of our Independence here in the States that not many bands wanted to release anything and get lost in everyone’s vacation time period. Hopefully there is something for you. I will post videos for each so you can have something to got through. Here is hoping next week is better.\n\nKissin’ Dynamite – Ecstasy – (Metal Blade Records)\n\nVixen – Live Fire – (Rat Pak Records)\n\nContinue reading “Friday New Releases – July 6th” →\n\nThe 80’s was a great time in music for me. It was the time I started really getting obsessed about with it. There were so many great songs, thanks to the dawn of MTV, during this time. They exposed us to so many more bands that our radio stations were not playing.\n\nThere are good songs, great songs, rock songs, dance songs, pop songs and some songs that are just too damn cool. This list is what I felt were the really cool songs of the decade. Cool could be the subject matter or the overall sound of the song and of course it is very subjective. I wasn’t very cool back in the day so my definition of cool might not equal yours. Come to think of it…I am not cool now. Oh well, I hope you enjoy the playlist.\n\nRed Rider – “Lunatic Fringe”\n\nContinue reading “#TBT – The Coolest Songs of the 80’s – Playlist” →"
