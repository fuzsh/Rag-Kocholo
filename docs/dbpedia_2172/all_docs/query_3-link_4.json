        "text": "As A Flock of Seagulls announce their first new recorded material since 1984, what better excuse to run through an A-Z of bands featuring birds in their names?\n\nA Albatross Nepal’s premier rock band (this is going to be harder than we thought)\n\nB The Blackbirds German one-hit wonders from 1968. When we say one hit, that may be a shocking exaggeration\n\nC The Black Crowes Brotherly fall-outs have meant the band have splintered into warring factions\n\nD Dove Ever-decreasing returns commercially but fans still bay for a reformation\n\nE Eagles We were going to go for something witty to do with eggs but we thought better of it\n\nF The Falcons Regularly rotating R&B band who counted Wilson Pickett and Eddie Floyd among their numbers at differing times\n\nG Goose Belgian electro. This is definitely not barrel-scraping\n\nH Hawkwind Still going strong, primarily as they’re all but pickled\n\nI Ibis Italian proggers from 1973. Briefly reformed in 2007\n\nJ Jayhawks Early definers of the alt-country rock scene\n\nK Kite Swedish synth noodlers\n\nL Lark South African avant garde electronica band\n\nM Tequila Mockingbyrd Aussie punning rock n roll trio\n\nN Nightingale More prog! This time from the heavier end of the spectrum\n\nO Blind Owl Band Rootsy soft rockers from out-of-town New York\n\nP Pigeonhed The lack of an “a” is deliberate. Accidentally had a hit after being featured in The Sopranos\n\nQ The Damn Quails Shouldn’t it be “damned”?\n\nR Satellite Ravens Arizona psychedelic swaggercore\n\nS George Swan One man Canadian whirlwind of fish and Deep Purple-esque rock\n\nT Wild Turkey A Jethro Tull splinter group with passing nods to Gentle Giant and Maddy Prior\n\nU Upland Sandpipers U is a very difficult letter\n\nV Them Crooked Vultures Sadly short-lived supgroup featuring Dave Grohl, Josh Homme and John Paul Jones\n\nW The Wrens Not as twee as they sound but nevertheless resolutely indie schmindie\n\nY Yellow-eyed Penguin Cafe Orchestra Apologies\n\nZ Well, you find one!"
