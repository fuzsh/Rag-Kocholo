I’ve been a fan since …\n\nThe Appleseed Cast, The Fleeting Light of Impermanence\n\nEven back when they were Yet Another Band with Melodic Guitars and Shy-Boy Vocals on an Emo Diaries comp (that’s where I first heard ’em, at least, literally 20 freaking …\n\nThe Wheel Workers, post-truth\n\nIt hasn’t even been a full decade since the first time I heard The Wheel Workers — which was then less a “band” and more just frontman/songwriter Steven Higginbotham yelling …\n\nWe Were Promised Jetpacks, The More I Sleep The Less I Dream\n\nIt’s bizarre to even type it, but it’s been longer than I’d realized since I last heard anything from one of my favorite bands, Edinburgh’s We Were Promised Jetpacks. …\n\nThe Ex-Optimists, Drowned in Moonlight\n\nHey, Ex-Optimists crew; look, we need to talk. I mean, I love y’all — you know I do — but it’s starting to creep me out having you rummage …\n\nAndrew W.K., You’re Not Alone\n\nAndrew W.K. has always been an enigma, at least to me; truthfully, it’s part of his charm. Is he serious about his whole “Party Hard” shtick? How can …\n\nMatt Costa, Santa Rosa Fangs\n\nI may have underestimated Matt Costa. No, scratch that — going by Santa Rosa Fangs, I definitely underestimated Matt Costa. I’ve only seen him live once, back in …\n\nRuiners, Typecast\n\nOnce upon a time, there was an awesome, promising young indie-rock band called Ruiners; they released a handful of songs, one of which, “One,” lived in my head for about …\n\nLive in Pictures: Styx/Tesla\n\nWe’re stepping forwards a bit in time for this installment of Live in Pictures, with pics from photographer Marshall Forse Walker of the relatively-recent show at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell …\n\nLive: POND/Fascinator\n\nThe backstage door opened, and a young woman wearing sunglasses peeked out. I thought to myself, “Perhaps the show is about to begin.” She wore a saxophone around …\n\nJody Seabody & The Whirls, Hawksamillion\n\nThe first time I saw this band play, they were, well, pretty damn different from what they are now. See, if you’d asked me back then what Jody Seabody …\n\nLive: The Suffers/The Tontons\n\nI know it’s been years in reality, but it seems like yesterday that we were treated to The Suffers and The Tontons on the same night together at the Houston …\n\nThe Wiggins, WATERWORLD EP\n\nWhen I first listened to WATERWORLD, the newest EP from The Wiggins, aka Jon Read, a surprising thing happened. I was in the car, driving my 8-year-old around, and …\n\nLive in Pictures: Julien Baker/Half Waif/Adam Torres\n\nBack again with the Live in Pictures series we’ve been doing, this time with photographer Marshall Forse Walker’s photos from the reportedly-excellet Julien Baker show…\n\nThe Suffers, Everything Here\n\nThe first time I listened to The Suffers’ new album, Everything Here, I was sitting on a desert island in the Caribbean; no, seriously, that’s what happens when you’ve got …\n\nLive: Caroline Rose/Cardioid\n\nI’ve been eagerly waiting to see Caroline Rose live again since first seeing her at Stubb’s in March during SXSW. The act was by far my favorite takeaway from …\n\nLive in Pictures: ZAO/Eyeagainst/SLEEPERDRONE\n\nAnd here we go once more, with Marshall Forse Walker’s pics from back in December when ZAO, Eyeagainst, and SLEEPERDRONE hit the now-shuttered Walter’s…\n\nRebirth In The Springtime: Checking Out In Bloom Fest 2018, Day One\n\nHello, SCR friends!
