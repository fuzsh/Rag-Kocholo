        "text": "Heavy Metal - Tool\n\nDeath metal - Nile\n\nSynth-Pop - Depeche Mode\n\nCountry - Junior Brown\n\nHard Rock - Led Zeppelin (is that a fair genre for them?)\n\nRock and Roll - Beatles\n\nJoy Division is the best of their genre. Whatever you want to call it. I believe some newage douchebags call it Post-Punk. So that.\n\nI'd say that Led Zeppelin is more Blues-Rock than hard rock, although they are known for being able to work in many genres. But no matter what genre anyone wants to place them in, they are one of the greatest bands to ever play.\n\nBut as for Hard Rock, I'd say Van Halen is the best at that genre, although you're bound to get many different opinions for each genre.\n\nArent genres in general pointless and redundant? My mp3 collection is broken into 4 categories and that's only because I've got like 500+ albums in there and it's hard to find specific stuff without decently sorting it out.\n\nHip-hop/R&B/Hip-hop related stuff, Rock/Rock related music, Trance/trance-like music, and Jazz/Chillout/Classical/Slow Stuff\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nPop- None. Pop sucks.\n\nFrom this thread:\n\nhttps://www.gtplanet.net/forum/showthread.php?t=44944\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nIs Good Charolette considered Pop? I heard some consider them pop, but I don't. How does one classify \"pop.\" What makes a band a \"Pop\" band?\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nAm I the only one who likes a few Good Charolette songs?\n\nEveryone likes a little pop, it's everywhere.\n\nMetal - Black Sabbath\n\nPyschedelic Rock - Pink Floyd\n\nProgressive Metal - Tool\n\nIndustrial - Nine Inch Nails\n\nNu-Metal - Deftones\n\nDeath Metal - In Flames\n\nHard Rock - Soil\n\nI'm sure Led Zeppelin fits in here somewhere, but I don't know what to categorize them under...\n\nemad\n\nMetal - Symphony X\n\nSymphony X are Power Metal. All those symphonic metal like Symphony X, Stratovarius, etc are power metal.\n\nI was really hooked on rage against the machine for a while a long time after they broke up so I really dont know anything bout them. I heard somewhere that they might have been fake and that they didnt really support wat they wrote. Is this true? Id like to know\n\nthanx\n\nIndustrial - Ministry\n\nHeavy Metal - Pantera\n\nDeath Metal - In Flames\n\nProgressive Metal - Rammstein\n\nRock - Smashing Pumpkins\n\nHard Rock - Too many to mention\n\nBlues Rock - Led Zeppelin\n\nTrance - Chicane\n\nTechno - Aphex Twin Other notables include: Crystal method, and Orbital\n\nHouse - Fatboy Slim Other notables include: Bassment Jaxx, Daft Punk, and Fluke\n\nTrip Hop - Dj Shadow Other notables include: Junkie XL, Massive Attack, and Theivery Corp.\n\nDrum N' Bass - Photek Other notables include: Amon Tobin\n\nHardcore Techno - Prodigy Notables such as: Squarepusher, Curve, Humble Brothers.\n\nOld School Rap - Naughty by Nature\n\nRap - uhm.... don't really like rap. Beastie Boys are ok I guess *shrugs* Oh wait I like Mos Def but he's kinda Hip Hop.\n\nVideo Game music - Daiki Kasho, Hitoshi Sakimoto or Nobuo Uematsu\n\nClassical - Mike Oldfield is cool..... oh wait! Sergei Rachmaninoff\n\nCountry - Country sucks ass.... Kenny Rogers is ok for Xmas music though.. meh.\n\nNew Age - uhm..... no one Vangelis is pretty cool though.\n\nPop - ermhh... can't think of any right now\n\nSoft Rock - Coldplay\n\nJimmy Enslashay\n\nTheres too many genres, I propose sorting them into this:\n\nPop:\n\nLove Music:\n\nRap:\n\nR'n'B:\n\nCountry:\n\nClassical:\n\nPunk:\n\nMetal:\n\nRock:\n\nRock'n'Roll:\n\nBlues:\n\nJazz:\n\nEthnic:\n\nTechno/Trance/etc:\n\nPop Rock:\n\nCopy that and put some bands/singers into those categories.\n\nOf course there are heaps of genres. Most of them are derived from people who don't know what to classify a band as, so they make up some crazy genre...\n\nJimmy Enslashay\n\nHeavy Metal - Slayer\n\nDeath Metal - Deicide currently for me, but best ever maybe Morbid Angel or Cannibal Corpse.\n\nI agree with Jimmy Enslashay with Slayer as the best in Heavy Metal, the others would be (Butthead: He said wood)\n\nPop: Michael Jackson\n\nLove Music: Cutting Crew\n\nRap: Tupac (Not my favorite, is the only rap band I know of, since my brother listens to him)\n\nR'n'B: ?\n\nCountry: ?\n\nClassical: ?\n\nPunk: Rancid\n\nMetal: Slayer\n\nRock: Motley Crue\n\nRock'n'Roll: Elvis Presley\n\nBlues: ?\n\nJazz: Xavier Cugat\n\nEthnic: ?\n\nTechno/Trance/etc: ?\n\nPop Rock: Gary Numan(?) (NOt sure what Pop Rock is)\n\nThe ones with: ? means I don't know what the genre is.\n\nFunk Rock - Red Hot Chili Peppers [my fav band]\n\nAlternative Pop Rock - Ben Folds (Five)\n\nAcid Jazz Funk Pop Dance - Jamiroquai\n\nCeltic Alternative Rock - Cranberries\n\nJazz Funk - Tower Of Power\n\nComedy Alternative Rock - Tenacious D, Shirehorses [too close]\n\nRap Metal - Linkin Park\n\nBreak Beat - 4 Hero [top group, check it out]\n\nUrban Crossover - Beverley Knight\n\nPop Punk - Green Day\n\nBut you can go on all day, because at the end of the day each band has it's own genre. The only genre that you really can pigeon hole is pop, because so much of it gets churned out.\n\nLed zep ..put them in whatever catagory you please. mettalica ..metal.. guns 'n roses in the sex drugs and rock till you drop then disapear catagory. alice in chains for the \"why did we name us that\" ? catagory ..honorable mention tool and Anthrax.\n\nThe doors in wtf is he saying ? wtf does it mean ? catagory.Red hot Chilli peppers in the dance naked with socks on the pepper catagory. Pink floyd in the \" wow look at the pretty colors\" catagory and the GRATEFULL DEAD for the \" how the hell did they ever make so much cash\" ? catagory along with honorable mention for the best performance while stoned and the wtf is he saying ? and the most drugs swallowed at a sitting without death or live embalment catagorys.\n\nI just realised I posted a list to go by, and I didn't use it myself. Here goes:\n\nPop: God no....\n\nLove Music: Even worse....\n\nRap: Bone Thugs 'n' Harmony (I hate rap with a passion, but these guys are fast and alot of my friends like 'em so it's a mention for my friends I spose)\n\nR'n'B: Ugh...\n\nCountry: Country music ruins Australia's image, so I'm not gonna post that....\n\nClassical: Mozart? Beethoven?? meh...\n\nPunk: My enemy, least favourite genre.....I'll kill it off one day...Lol.\n\nMetal: Slayer; Deicide.\n\nRock: AC/DC\n\nRock'n'Roll: Santana\n\nBlues: Blues Brothers...it's all I really know...\n\nJazz: Bernard Hemmerman (Created the \"Taxi Driver Theme\", and I love that movie)\n\nEthnic: Deodato (Hispanic Jazz, listen to Espantoso in Vice City)\n\nTechno/Trance/etc: Oh hell no....\n\nPop Rock: Van Halen (Yes, Pop Rock, it's my opinion and I'm sticking by it)\n\nJimmy Enslashay\n\nI just realised I posted a list to go by, and I didn't use it myself.
