        "text": "There's an industry web site http://www.triplearadio.com which has news of US stations and lists of suggested songs for play listing.\n\nThey include stations like KCRW and WFPK in the category, both favourites of mine. KCRW tends to be focused more on newer music and artists who are connected to the LA music scene, with some good late night (i.e. breakfast time here) specialist shows. WFPK is good for rock, blues, vintage roots music and jazz - a format that doesn't exist here.\n\nFor me the most important aspect of the format is that those stations don't assume the audience just wants to hear singles. They choose the songs that sound good on their own merit, not because they're being \"released\" as a single.\n\nThe thing with AAA is that it's different things to different people. The US AAAs have varying sounds, from MVY to Chicago's WXRT, to Los Angeles' classic rock-leaning The Sound, to the public stations like KEXP, KCMP and WFUV.\n\nArguably 6 Music is AAA (leaning more towards alternative) and the Original stations, too. Closest we probably had to this format is The Coast, which would later become Jack South Coast.\n\nAn interesting thread. I think there is a gap in Britain. If I worked hard enough on it, I could probably produce a reasonably coherent link between (a) Muscle Shoals, West Coast, Classic Singer/Songwriter and (b) Acoustic Mainstream Indie 80s/90s/00s. I'd also want to throw in a fair bit of rock and roll, country, cool jazz, African,\n\nLatin, 60s Euro curiosity, psychedelia, blues and the 2000s folk roots revival. Soulful, melodic, quirky, breezy.\n\nFew hard edges but gutsy. Lots of movement but calming. Unpredictable yet complimentary and reassuring.\n\nAn interesting thread.

Unpredictable yet complimentary and reassuring.\n\nthat sounds like an interesting mix ,it sounds like you would love to set up your own station!\n\nIt would be good to have a UK based AAA station (of the type that avoids hard rock and rap music) even if was internet only, they would be more aware of the UK and Irish music scene and provide tour dates etc. ( like 6 music does).\n\nApart from the excellent music played (and with large playlists) the presenters on the stations such as WUMB and MVY radio are people who like what they play and pass on information about the artists.\n\n--- Ugh I hope not!!!\n\nWell although not totally an AAA station because of our high sports/speech content, Eklipse Sports Radio's actual music format is as damn close to AAA as we can get, Possibly a little towards the classic AOR - Mike and Mechanics, Allman Brothers etc, but since we ditched heavy rock such as Korn it seems to be settling down quite nicely.\n\nAvailable now on all good DAB sets across Central Scotland and online!\n\nhttp://www.eklipsesportsradio.co.uk/listen.php\n\nwhen on holiday in west Wales I came across an excellent show on RTE radio 1:\n\nJohn Creeden 8 to 10pm Mon to Fri http://www.rte.ie/radio1/john-creedon/\n\nI am sure Irish posters to this forum are well aware of him.\n\nI would class this show as AAA (adult album alternative)\n\nheres a playlist from Monday evening:\n\nSubstitute\n\nThe Who\n\nWhats Going On\n\nTaste\n\nLove Like This\n\nKodaline\n\nWay Back When\n\nKodaline\n\nTake The Star Out Of The Window\n\nJohn Prine\n\nSam Stone\n\nJohn Prine\n\nLove's Been Good To Me\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nSunday Morning Coming Down\n\nKris Kristofferson\n\nAll Along The Watchtower\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nAll Gone Away\n\nThe Style Council\n\nCruel To Be Kind\n\nNick Lowe\n\nFamily Affair\n\nSly And The Family Stone\n\nLow Rider\n\nWar\n\nI Like It Like That\n\nPucho And His Latin Soul Brothers\n\nBack To Black\n\nAmy Winehouse\n\nOur Day Will Come\n\nAmy Winehouse\n\nRun On For A Long Time\n\nBlind Boys Of Alabama\n\nI Love King Selassie\n\nBlack Uhuru\n\nGone Forever\n\nMick Flannery\n\nStuff That Works\n\nGuy Clark\n\nI Met Up With The King\n\nFirst Aid Kit\n\nAnd A Bang On The Ear\n\nThe Waterboys\n\nA great mix of music and a very knowledgable presenter.\n\nAnd the good thing about RTE Radio 1 is that it available across the UK on Sky and Virgin TV.\n\nSo programs can be easily recorded to listen when you like."
