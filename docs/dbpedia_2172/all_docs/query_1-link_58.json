It’s a rock’n’roll/beat band which play lot of fantastic cover songs. Some you know by heart and some you might not have heard at all. Like The Beatles in Hamburg was one of the ideas flying around when they were forming the group.\n\nThe Good Times at myspace\n\nPetty Crimes\n\nPetty Crimes is a new band led by Damn Seagulls frontman Lauri Eloranta. Petty Crimes’ garage rock is a lot rougher than you might expect if you’ve gotten used to Damn Seagulls’ almost stadium friendly sound but it does sound equally brilliant. Actually this might even sound better to the hardcore indie geeks. I love ’em both.\n\nPetty Crimes at myspace\n\nFlavour Of The Month Summer Edition Vol 2.\n\nBoth of these bands will play at FOTM Summer edition at Pikku-Torre, Turku on thursday 29th of july. Yours truly will be part of the DJ Team. It should be a blast. See you there. It’s during the Down By The Laituri festival.\n\nFlavour Of The Month Summer Edition Vol. 2\n\nPETTY CRIMES\n\nTHE GOOD TIMES\n\n+ FOTM DJ’s\n\nPikku-Torre, Yliopistonkatu 30, Turku\n\nto 29.7.2010, klo 21-03\n\nVAPAA PÄÄSY\n\n— More (old) news to come pretty soon —"
