        "text": "Subwoofer For Bass-Heads\n\nPros: The Kiwi Ears Singolo try to carve a distinctive niche for themselves among so many similar IEMS.\n\n- Voluminous and powerful bass, thanks to the good innovation of the KARS.\n\n- Soft but well extended and natural treble.\n\n- Pleasant and musical tuning from the midrange onwards.\n\n- Very good comfort and ergonomics.\n\n- They arouse a mixed feeling, sometimes they seem quite good, sometimes not so good.\n\nCons: They need some break-in, power and volume to \"wake up\" the midrange and high frequencies.\n\n- Technically average.\n\n- Sound somewhat compressed in layers.\n\n- Specialised profile, not for all tastes.\n\n- Very sparing in accessories for the price.\n\nIntroduction\n\nKiwi Ears are a small international group of engineers with the sole aim of producing the best sounding audio solutions for musicians and audiophiles. They focus on developing the latest driver technology innovations with refined tuning strategies that reveal all the nuances of music and performance. This time, they have collaborated with Crinacle, one of the world's most reputable audio critics, to create the new Kiwi Ears Singolo. The Singolo is a custom 11mm dynamic driver IEM featuring the revolutionary Kiwi Acoustic Resonance System (KARS). KARS is a discrete bandpass filter that manipulates the airflow to the driver, regulating the low-frequency output. This patented innovation features an elaborate labyrinth-like network of tubes that has been designed based on numerous scientific and physical models to perfectly calculate the right resonance point for the Singolo transducer. The KARS makes a tight subwoofer shelf possible, something that was previously impossible in a single-transducer IEM. Unlike traditional crossover filters that use multiple transducers with RC (resistor-capacitor) networks, KARS uses Helmholtz resonance to regulate their tuning. The airflow to a dynamic transducer regulates how much the diaphragm can respond, but also requires additional calculations of flow rate, direction and volume. The KARS allows precise regulation of this airflow to manipulate the sound as desired. While capacitors and resistors provide a calculated medium for crossover solutions, they also add unwanted artefacts to the sound in the form of distortion, especially when using cheap SMD components. With KARS, the sound you hear comes directly from the transducer itself, resulting in a pure, higher resolution audio experience without the encumbrance of passive electrical components. KARS is 3D printed to an accuracy of 1.0 micron. The Singolo incorporates a custom Japanese liquid crystal polymer (LCP) diaphragm driver. This 11mm dynamic transducer has been custom created for the KARS, with unique front and rear acoustic chamber profiles. The Singolo is tuned according to Crinacle's tonal signature. It is a synthesis of all the best tuning profiles found in the world's most successful headphones over the years. With an 8 dB sub-bass boost, the bass is incredibly punchy and powerful, but cuts off impeccably at 300 Hz. This allows for a neutral midrange that articulates the natural sound of vocals and instruments without any artificial distortion. The treble follows the perfect compensatory curvature of the pinna, with a clean peak at 3 kHz and a natural roll-off into the upper treble.\n\nAfter all that talk, let's see how the Crinacle Kiwi Ears Singolo really perform.\n\nSpecifications\n\nModel: Kiwi Ears x Crinacle Singolo.\n\nDriver: 11mm custom dynamic driver + KIWI Acoustic Resonance System (KARS).\n\nFrequency response: 20Hz- 20kHz.\n\nSensitivity: 108dBSPL/mW.\n\nImpedance: 32Ω.\n\nCapsule material: Resin.\n\nCable length: 1.2 meters.\n\nConnection interface: 0.78mm.\n\nPlug type: 3.5mm SE.\n\nMouthpiece inner diameter: 4mm.\n\nSuitable ear tip size: 4-4.5mm.\n\nPRICE: $79.00 USD.\n\nPackaging\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Singolo comes in a medium-sized box with a mix of blue and black background. Its dimensions are 146x122x38mm. On the main side you can see, at the top, the logo of the brand and also the Crinacle logo. In the centre there is a real photo of the capsules on gold ink brushstrokes. At the bottom is the model name and a short description of the model, all in white ink. On the back, at the top left, are the logos of all the certifications held by the product. To the right is the brand logo in large print. In the centre, the model name and description are repeated. At the bottom are the brand name, e-mail address, web address and distributors. Removing the cardboard cover reveals a black box with a silver brand logo in the centre. After opening the lid you can see the IEMS with the cable inside a black foam mould. Underneath is a black cardboard lid with the brand logo in silver. Under that cardboard is the rest of the cable and accessories. In a nutshell:\n\nThe Kiwi Ears Singolo x Crinacle.\n\nA silver-plated single-strand cable coated with clear PVC.\n\nThree pairs of black tips sizes SxMxL.\n\nThree pairs of white tips sizes SxMxL.\n\nOne instruction manual.\n\nAnd nothing else. For a set costing around $80, there is no storage bag or pouch. The cable is just average, with a tendency to stiffness, although I like the curved design of the plug sleeve, as well as the 2Pin 0.78mm connectors, and the cylindrical metal cover installed on all these parts. The tip set is standard, completing a limited accessory set for the price.\n\nConstruction and Design\n\nThe capsules of the Kiwi Ears Singolo are made of resin. They do not have a semi-custom shape, but a classic one, with a triangular outer shape with rounded corners and a smooth, but continuously curved inner side. The outer face is blue on a fluid micro glitter base that varies in shades of blue to white, with almost pinkish tones in between. In the centre is the brand logo in silver. The capsules are relatively thick compared to the small-medium size of the set. The inner face is completely transparent, emphasising the visibility of the internal construction and those ducts that make up the KARS. You can see a duct that connects the driver output face to the base of the driver and then that labyrinth-like duct that connects a plate above the base to the output at the edge of the capsule. Enlarging the photo you can see the steps of the KARS made with 1 micron precision. The driver is relatively large, 11mm, coated in metal, while on the side near the apex you can read the name of the brand written on that cylinder. The inner side is very rounded and the transparency allows you to see the driver diaphragm at the base of the mouthpiece. The mouthpiece is metallic, with a minor diameter of 5.3mm and a crown of approximately 6.55mm. The total length is around 4mm and they are protected by a multi-perforated metal grille. Finally, the 2Pin 0.78mm connection interface is fully integrated into the rim of the capsules and is gold-plated.\n\nThe cable is a simple transparent strand whose conductor looks like silver-plated copper. It is somewhat stiff although not very thick, which is classic when it comes to this translucent PVC coating. All connector sleeves are curved and made of a whitish plastic. They are small parts with a cylindrical metal cover. The gold-plated 3.5mm SE plug is located near the cable outlet. On the 2 Pin 0.78mm connection interface it is at the base of the two gold-plated pins. The pin is at 90 degrees while the sleeve of the 2Pin connectors does not reach that many degrees, although it is clearly curved. The splitter is a smooth metal cylinder and the pin is a translucent plastic piece with a double through-hole. It is effective enough to hold the adjustment.\n\nAs you can read in the introduction, Kiwi Ears seems to have gone all out on the interior design of the capsule, with the patented KARS replacing any electronic crossover filter. In the end, it looks like a simple labyrinthine duct that has been seen in other IEMS. Otherwise, the capsule's exterior design is pleasing, very rounded, with generous nozzles in diameter although somewhat short. The cable, given the price and the scarcity of accessories, could be better. There is no choice of balanced plug.\n\nAdjustment and Ergonomics\n\nThe size of the capsules is small-medium, somewhat thick. Their weight is very light. All this, together with a very rounded shape, fits very well in the pinna. The problem comes with the diameter of the mouthpieces and their length. Their projection is very good, as is their inclination. But the thickness can be a bit big for some ear canals. Not for mine, whose diameter is quite large. Using my large tips filled with a lot of foam, I get that classic occlusive and long-lasting surface insertion. The good shape of the capsules limits rotation and the isolation, using my homemade tips, is very good. However, it is clear that the use of these specific tips, together with the diameter of the mouthpieces, can lead to some fatigue over the hours, despite the large size of my ear canals. Nevertheless, the ergonomics are more than remarkable and quite durable.\n\nSound\n\nProfile\n\nThe profile of the Singolo is somewhat peculiar, oscillating between a V-U, with that excitement in the sub-bass and midrange. However, the highs are quite nuanced and, perhaps, that is the crux of the matter. Thanks to the KARS, the bass is the star of the show. Designed to sound like a subwoofer, the Singolo's bass is big, voluminous and wide, even if it has a distinct drop-off as it enters the low-midrange. The first half of the midrange feels a little sunken and the midrange stays there until a gentle rise up to 4kHz. From that point on, there is an abrupt drop and the treble softens up a lot. It is not a dark profile, but rather a more nuanced and softened profile in brightness, sounding a bit dry and sparse, a bit forced.\n\nFinally, the Kiwi Ears Singolo are somewhat difficult to move.\n\nBass\n\nWithout a doubt, the bass of the Kiwi Ears Singolo is big and voluminous. The low end is certainly intrusive and permeates the entire soundstage. It's a bass with range, medium speed, that lingers in the room. It is relatively agile, but its strength and effect is felt in the air and in volume, it stays in the head and is not so quick to collect itself. This makes the spin more impressive, but the hit is effective, well-drawn and very punchy. It is not a dry hit, but juicy, but relatively well defined. It has a good dose of texture, plenty of bounce and power, both physical and sensory. And that shows in the very low frequency pure tone test. The low end is quite sensory with an audible undulating part. But, that sensory point possesses a good degree of power that comes to stun, like a dull kick. You can clearly perceive the power in the sub-bass and its sensory power. As the frequencies increase, this energy becomes more audible, but remains shattering and vast. Are the Singolo IEMS for bass heads? From their overwhelming behaviour in the sub-bass, I would say yes. That mix of sensory and physical power, coupled with the volume it generates, makes me think it can be included in this category.\n\nFinally, in the test of dirty bass, unfiltered bases, complex and mixed bass lines, the Singolo's proved remarkably adept. Despite the grandeur of their bass, it is true that their intonation stops at the point where the midranges begin. From 20Hz to 250Hz there is a 10dB drop designed to deactivate the bass in the midrange. Does it succeed? It's tricky, but it works up to a point. On the plus side, the Singolo's are able to execute complex passages with a good level of definition, without clumping and without sounding drowned out or muddy. Admittedly, there is a lot of rumble and it is not one of the fastest basses to recover. But there is some ability to follow the lines, as long as they are not too fast. But, it is also true that the lines can get stuck together due to their own power and the volume they occupy in the atmosphere. This makes it not the cleanest when it comes to reproducing fast bass lines or layers. But, so much power is not easy to make disappear.\n\nMids\n\nThe brand itself says that \"the bass is impeccably cut at 300Hz. This allows for a neutral midrange that articulates the natural sound of vocals and instruments without any artificial distortion.\" The truth is that the first half of the midrange feels relatively sunken, more so, if the music has bass. In electronic music with vocals it is clear that the power of the bass affects the ambience and tends to crowd out the vocals. For a male range that already feels medium-distance, with a lean body, a somewhat dry sonority due to limited harmonics, the Singolo would not be the best choice if you want to enjoy it. When the bass is not very present, there is a tendency to want to turn up the volume to bring these male voices closer, because their sonority, although somewhat sparse, is felt in an analogue but muffled way. This implies a release of full sibilance, but leaves them with an unjuicy, mostly dry, dark-leaning body. On the other hand, the female voices don't stretch towards brightness either, despite the emancipation of the pinna gain. It is true that they are favoured, but they remain on a plane that is not entirely protagonist. Feminine sibilance can become subtly visible in those songs prone to it. But it's a thick, rounded, nuanced sheen, never penetrating, and brief.\n\nIn the rest of the instrumentation, this dull, dry, nuanced quality persists. In my opinion, the natural sound is more vivid and also more sparkling, without being annoying, of course. However, the Singolo's are too secure in this respect, as well as being somewhat distant. Do they sound good? As I say, there is a tendency to turn up the volume to enhance the fullness of the midrange and, as long as the bass doesn't appear, they can come across as fuller and more balanced. At that point, more enjoyable midranges appear, slightly soft, dark, yet musical. But that does not detract from the imbalance in the bass.\n\nTreble\n\nTo describe the high end, I refer again to the manufacturer's notes: \"The treble follows the perfect compensatory curvature of the pinna, with a clean peak at 3 kHz and a natural decay towards the upper treble\". Are the treble natural? Perhaps I could say they are naturally smooth. It is true that I have been commenting that the sound is muffled, dry and nuanced, that the harmonics are not felt very much. However, if we talk about pure treble, it is true that it is there and expressed in a more natural way than I had thought. With that initial peak at 4kHz and a steep drop of another 10dB, the treble is stretched into the air zone by means of a controlled undulation. The result is a high end that doesn't have a lot of energy, but is more homogeneous and realistic than expected, sounding smoothly natural and analogue. It is also descriptive and extensive enough to provide a good level of information. The downside is that the treble also feels a bit off from the midrange, hence the harmonic hollowness in the central range. In addition, their low energy also means that more power is needed to perceive them individually. The effect on the rest of the music is that their presence is relatively average.\n\nSoundstage, Separation\n\nThe scene is predominantly frontal, a clear sense of volume at the bottom giving it a good level of depth. However, it is not too wide. There is a correct lateral sensation and not too much headroom. The feeling is of a more compact and unified sound, where the separation is not very obvious, nor is the layering or stratification. Beyond the volume and space occupied by the bass, the midranges feel homogenous and fairly cohesive, something that keeps the sound from being too technical or possessing too much resolution. If the songs have enough treble, the ensemble responds in a more airy way. Otherwise, the feeling of dryness, sparse and relatively dark sound, will detract from the detail. With corresponding power, detail can come to the fore and the sound becomes cleaner. But, even in that scenario, the detail is somewhat coarse and not very well defined, declaring a medium resolution and a rather average technical behaviour. It is clear that the Singolo are more musical and fun in their bass section, than technical.\n\nThe image is just OK and not very remarkable in this department either.\n\nComparisons\n\nTKZK Ouranos\n\nThe TKZK Ouranos struck me as IEMS that were in the middle of the tuning of the late 2022 and early 2023 TinHiFi's (T2 DLC 2022, T4 Plus, C2 and C3). They were the softest in treble and with a bass in the middle. Personally, I have to say that I liked them a lot. Their ergonomics are a notch above the Singolo, due to their semi-custom shape. The cable is almost on a par, although the Ouranos is stiffer. In terms of accessories, both are very sparse, but the Ouranos come with a small cloth bag. The current price of the Ouranos is $55 compared to $79 for the Singolo.\n\nWhat can you see from the comparison of the two frequency responses? You could almost say that the Ouranos are a Singolo with a softened subwoofer. Their curve is more balanced and rounder, with slightly more irregular treble. Subtly more sensitive, the Ouranos' profile seems more homogeneous, balanced and fuller. There is some similarity in the way the bass of the two IEMS performs, neither is too fast and the power control found in the Ouranos gave it a certain amount of joy and vigour. In the Singolo this character is clearly enhanced and it does feel like a more exaggerated Ouranos in the sub-bass, but also less compact and staying more in the room. The LFOs work quite well on both IEMSs, executing the pure tones very well, but with that familiar sensory and physical superiority of the Singolo. But so much power is difficult to dissipate and with a texture that is also complex to smooth out.\n\nThe midrange is more disconnected from the bass on the Ouranos, but they have that nice, musical warmth, which gives it more body, a more physical part and more presence. The first half of the midrange is closer in the Ouranos and male voices appreciate it. In the Singolo there is a point of sinking in that first half of the midrange, which unbalances the central range, leaving a certain gap. At that point, the Ouranos seem more natural and with better timbre. They are relatively equally dark. That they are thinner in that first half gives a point of clarity to the Singolo, less warmth in exchange for being leaner and thinner. That warmth of the Ouranos is also transmitted to the midrange and the female voices also feel fuller and rounder. I think the midranges, despite the dark and warmth of the Ouranos, are better than on the Singolo. However, the highs of the Singolo are better achieved than in the Ouranos. They don't sound the same, despite the similarity. I find the high end of the Ouranos a bit more strident, while the Singolo's treble reproduction is more homogeneous, even coherent. In the Ouranos I feel a certain disconnection in some points, while the Singolo show a more balanced behaviour throughout the range.\n\nOn a technical level the Ouranos dare to hint at the micro level. Despite the darkness and its softness, there is more space between layers and a richer background can be glimpsed. In it, certain details can be noticed. Those same details are more buried in the Singolo's because they sound flatter and tighter. That level of layering gives the Ouranos more of a sense of depth throughout the range. Therefore, I think there is a point more resolution and detail, even though the Singolo's seem more defined because they are thinner.\n\nThe scene is more voluminous in the Singolo, but I find the presentation of the Ouranos to be more spacious, with that better layering. Their better balance between bands means that, by giving them more power, there is no imbalance and you can see the size of their scene and better laterality.\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery brand seeks to innovate and in this regard, I find Kiwi Ears' work in creating the KARS commendable. It is clear that their bass is distinctive, creating IEMS that combine a power for bass heads, along with a tuning that tries to be smooth and natural. Thanks to the KARS, the Singolo's bass comes close to the behaviour of a subwoofer. But that very power makes them a specialised IEMS, which distinguishes them from an all-terrain IEMS. Kiwi Ears may have sought to create IEMS for bass heads, but without sacrificing a certain degree of naturalness and realism. In this sense, it succeeds in the treble. However, the clear intention to disconnect the bass from the midrange makes the first half of the middle range relatively hollow. On the other hand, it is more musical and smooth than technical. And in the price range in which it moves there is a lot of competition with very good resolving abilities. But I think the Kiwi Ears Singolo need not compete with them, but with that other IEMS range for bass heads that lacks that more audiophile level. The Singolo's niche is in that area, not in the wide range of IEMS based, more or less, on the Harman curve. And that is where they excel and should be taken into account.\n\nSources Used During the Analysis\n\nHidizs S8 Pro Robin.\n\nEPZ TP50.\n\nBurson Audio Playmate 2.\n\nAune X8 XVIII Magic DAC + EarMen ST-Amp.\n\nLinsoul Audio Store, offered me this model, in exchange for writing an honest review.

Currently I am 27 years old and more in awe of sheer power of music by the day. I have always been moved by music just that slight bit more than average, I'd say. My spending started with a roughly 200€ Bose bluetooth speaker back in my first grade of highschool. What an extraterrestrial thing that was in early 2010s. And it keeps on playing to this day – a true testament of quality. Also sounded fantastic back then, nowadays … yeah, not so much. Lots of BT speakers, TWS, car audio speakers, IEMs, etc., later bring me to this day when I truly consider myself an audiophile. What brings me the most joy beside listening to music is singing, so I am currently participating in a choir and challenging myself with solo vocal covers (check the links in my signature to hear my projects). Unsure where all this leads, but the journey itself is marvelous and life is nothing but a journey.\n\nHow The Review is Structured\n\nI will start off by mentioning the packaging and accessories, then place the showcased IEM in my special trademarked graph accompanied with other similarly priced IEMs I own and know well. Then I continue by giving it a score on certain qualities to help reach the final star score. Those that are seriously considering a single dynamic driver that is very affordable, please read the song examples below too to get as much of a feel on what one could expect. I really try my best to cover a wide variety to paint the sonic picture of the set for as many of you as possible.\n\nI will mention some songs of varied genres and try to convey what one can expect from the Kiwi Ears Singolo. As sources I have been using my FiiO BTR7 on high gain and Venture Electronics RA2B-FE + Prime DAC. Certainly no lack of power and quite a different taste on both. Listening was done at a volume ranging between 80-90dB. I am using stock cable to keep it original in that regard and Divinus Velvet medium-sized eartips. I always review with fresh ears – no other IEM gets any ear-time while I am desperately collecting my thoughts regarding the reviewed item.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this unit free of charge via Linsoul in exchange for a review. I am in no way incentivized to speak highly of this set. Should this review tip you over the edge and you decide on this IEM as your next purchase, I welcome you to check it out here: https://www.linsoul.com/products/kiwi-ears-x-crinacle-singolo\n\nPackaging & Accessories\n\nPackaging and accessories really won't tip anyone over the edge in their decision to purchase the Singolo. Having the cable already connected is a nice little touch to save you those awfully long seconds from unpacking to hearing the thing you purchased. Tips selection is very sparse and I honestly did not feel like trying them at all and went straight to the Divinus Velvet. Hearing all the bad experiences with how these fit I was skeptical. Lo and behold, they fit me absolutely wonderfully. It is a very shallow fit, but bass does not suffer, nor do I get any nasty treble peaks, but more on that in my song examples.\n\nLet's Get Going!\n\nGraph & Scores\n\nThis trademarked graph I came up with does not come with a thick user manual. All you need to know is that sets further left are warmer than sets further right, and sets higher up are better technically than sets lower down. Those little yellow lines on both axis represent where sets with average technicalities and neutral overall balance lay. I have also added three other single DD representatives - the Venture Electronics SIE, Simgot EA500 LM, and EPZ Q5 to help form a better perception of how the Singolo fares in comparison.\n\nHere are my scores on the Singolo in individual categories. All three subcategories of each of the frequency spectrums can be rated 1-5. Keep in mind that I am scoring regardless of the price, so cheaper sets getting a 3 in any given subcategory is already good going. I had to approach this in a simplistic manner so to keep it easy to understand and compare sets. Since this is my third single DD I have reviewed, we are starting to get a good picture of how the scores are turning out.\n\n7 Song Examples For the Curious\n\nSong #1:\n\nFirst minute of this song offers a quick sample to test piano, bass, trombone, and sax timbre as well as female vocals and the perception of stage.\n\nCreep by Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox feat. Haley Reinhart\n\nSong starts with a calming female vocal with lots of breathiness. On the Singolo vocally nothing stands out as a sore thumb, nor does it wow with highly articulated and deeply detailed presentation. Sibilance region is nicely adjusted so to still have that truthful bite that certain letters or combinations of letters carry. Often this 6-7kHz region backs off too much and while it does avoid sibilance it also messes timbrally with whichever instrument that extends up higher or has its overtones extending into that region. Well judged on the Singolo. Her voice is a bit smokier and not as rich as I know she can be on other sets which I would ultimately prefer, but that is just as much a matter of preference as 'correctness'. I would hazard a guess that is down to the rather quick drop-off right after the pinna gain peak. Going into »what the hell am I doing here« the open »heeeeere« can be too aggressive and rather uncomfrotable on some sets, but not so on Singolo. While it isn't as nuanced as it could be, it does not sound off in any serious way. Arrangement consists of various instruments, of which every single one requires timbral accuracy to maintain your attention. Singolo is very decent in this regard. What I find subpar however, is note weight through the mids and treble. Bass does not have the same issue and is a satisfying listen for both the bass and drums in this piece. Sincerity of bass is very good for this price category – it does sound decently rounded and does not affect low mids in any negative way despite decent extension in both subbass rumble and midbass attack. But more about bass on some other songs. Mids are where the set needs to shine to really bring this song the justice it deserves. The magic of mids is slightly lacking, but overall nicely judged in quantity, especially pinna instantly seemed to me to be done in a tasteful manner – graph sort of agrees in that it shows a very lengthy extension all the way from 900 to 3500Hz where it reaches a +9dB rise. Treble lacks in smoothness and any microscopic detail won't really be displayed here. Not too welcome in this tune with two brass instruments which should counter the strongly presented bass section. It feels a bit single-pointed just as the graph would seem to suggest as well – a large drop-off after 8kHz and a singular sharp peak at ~15kHz. This sort of treble tuning will be totally personal on whether your ears like it or feel awfully offended by it. A combination of hearing health, ear canal shape, fitment, and eartips all contribute to how this peak works out for an individual. Either way, expect to miss a good deal of details up top. Overall I have to say this song left me just a bit too cold for a very good score, so a 4.5/10 it is.\n\nSong #2:\n\nAngelic male vocal slowly transforming into a sharp male vocal and the usual rock accompaniment. Allows to better understand different sets' capability of perceived emotion, layering, timbre, etc.\n\nCastaway Angels by Leprous\n\nGuitar leads the way. I am very specific with guitars and love their breadth of ability to awaken a wide variety of emotions. Individual guitar plucks are not as storytelling as I would like, but it is timbrally right on. The slight lack of those sweet overtones is down to the slower pinna if I were to point at the culprit. Background hum that invokes a creepy atmosphere is easy to follow but a bit single-pointed. His vocal joins in a quiet and tranquil way to leave lots of space to develop afterwards. Male vocals are judged very well and the previously annoying smokiness I mentioned in the previous song's thoughts is not an issue here. Positioning of vocals is decently forward which allows for this sense of the vocalist being the leader while all instrumentation has sufficient space around him. In the wilder and more crowded spots of this song it becomes a tiny bit messy, but never sharp or overzealous. Here we do feel just a bit limited in the pace of the driver and the fact it is a solo performer with no BAs to take some weight off of its shoulders. Microdetail is not really a thing, but I cannot hold this against it. Overall tuning balance is of much greater importance. I would be reaching for another set for this song, however it is not a case of having to skip it, and hence a 6/10.\n\nSong #3:\n\nWhat a gorgeous tune to listen to … while testing bass texture, layering, soundstage characteristics, and restlessly dissecting each performer's work, like us audiophiles do. Tenor sax, trumpet, drums, piano, and bass all have something to say.\n\nCheck Point Charlie by David Chesky\n\nSuch a well produced jazz masterpiece with huge soundscape and very separated instrumentation that should never be in each other's way. It requires a great stage width especially, I feel. Singolo is very impressive in that regard, easily fooling my brain to ompletely dislocate the sound from the actual earpiece where it's born, obviously. Both left and right extremes do sound on the absolute extremities of head width and well beyond in certain instances – piano which plays on the far left side throughout the piece seems to be 5m away from me. Depth is not as well presented, but the generous width is what rectifies that to an extent. Individual instruments – bass, drums, piano, tenor sax, and trumpet are themselves, meaning no awful timbral incorrectness was found during my listen. Now, if I were to nitpick, and that's what us audiophiles are masters of, piano's note roundness and weight is not as sincere as I would ultimately like for it to sound even more real. Trumpet and sax have their sharper edges slightly rounded off too, so to not sound too piercing – carefully and intelligently approaching upper mid to low treble area while tuning is a good way of cutting harshness when tech at hand simply cannot reproduce the absolute clarity and note definition. I could honestly recommend Singolo to those who are this sort of jazz aficionados, it's a score of 8/10.\n\nSong #4:\n\nIf this does not bring me close to tears on the set, the set is doing something wrong either in guitars, female vocals, or overall sonic balance.\n\nAll About You by Sophie Zelmani\n\nBack to a deeply emotional guitar intro. Singolo is very nearly right on mark, alas it misses a bit of microdetail to really get my goosebumps going. Lower guitar notes are full and gorgeously rounded and cannot really be faulted. Those also wonderfully support her vocal which comes in with authority in that it is much more pronounced than the guitar both in positioning and volume. She has a story to tell and Singolo makes me listen, however soon thereafter I get pulled back to enjoying the well presented low end without any bloat and vocals are slightly put aside. This tune ought to bring us grown men close to tears or at the very least make our mind wander in trying to think who in our lives could be singing something as powerful to us at any point. Singolo does not possess the ultimate in capturing listener's attention to the fullest, thus a score that reflects the good presentation which falls short in emotion – 6/10.\n\nSong #5:\n\nUpbeat pop rhythms with plenty going on.\n\nThe thrill is gone. by RAYE\n\nCareful high mids are a must in order not to overpower the lows which carry the rhythm and allow the treble to do the dance. Bass is very nicely driving the whole song along and I honestly don't feel like much is missing. It could, of course, be a bit more textured, but I cannot hold that against the Singolo at the price point. Main vocalist is well placed while I could ask for just a tad more drive or precision of all first note impacts just to make her story even more believable. Treble is nicely judged in quantity, however it is easily Singolo's least impressive part. Lacking in transient speed and that ethereal sweetness that better (and usually more expensive) single DDs, let alone BAs or ESTs, can deliver. I am thinking about something like the IE600 here and plenty others I'm sure, but I prefer to mention sets I have heard myself. The fact that it is well tuned in the upper frequencies is of much greater importance in this instance. This song often makes me want to listen to it again even after finishing putting my thoughts onto the keyboard, but in this case it just did not impress me enough. Still, a good score due to not finding anything bothersome, 7/10.\n\nSong #6:\n\nOh, welcome crazy bass lines, please make yourselves comfortable along with tasteful drops and story-telling male vocals about an ill-intentioned lady.\n\nLove is a B*tch by Two Feet\n\nThe width I have already praised before is very welcome in the intro of this tune as well, since it features a rainy cloud moving around in circles – forming two circles to be exact. The rain itself is lacking in the aforementioned detail retrieval to really get a sense of all those droplets hitting the ground, but that is secondary. His vocal and the bass drop are differently presented where his vocal is of this silky breathy quality whereas bass spares no heft and comes swinging all guns blazing. Low end extension is very well done thanks to the length of that tiny but effective tube, I would dare say. Male vocal is definitely nicer to my ears than female vocal on the Singolo – the slower pinna gain and quicker drop after pinna peak does not affect male vocals as much. Treble is again a bit of a weakness that lowers my overall score, but this song captures Singolo's character nicely overall, so I can bestow upon it a 8.5/10.\n\nSong #7:\n\nDefinitely a competitor for best song title. It also gets the juices flowing and makes it impossible not to tap your feet. Or nod your head. Or both.\n\nGod is in the Soundwaves by Armin Van Buuren, Xoro, Yola Recoba\n\nLots of spacial cues right from the beginning which are handled well by Singolo as far as width is your first dimension you care about. Those clapping sounds are just a little veiled and not the most nuanced due to our slow pinna gain I would imagine. Her vocal is highly post-produced and feels that way on the Singolo which is good. Going into the drop bass has no trouble punching and rumbling and I think everyone but the most faithful bassheads will be happy here. Overall, this song is done well but suffers from one-dimensional soulless treble to really get me grooving. 7.5/10.\n\nThis concludes my song examples and hopefully you found some information that proves useful to your decision-making in the everlasting dilemma of To Buy or Not To Buy.\n\nTo Sum Up The Kiwi Ears Singolo\n\nSingolo is the single DD for those that are on the search for a nicely balanced sub-100€ IEM which delivers a satisfying bass upon which other frequencies can dance. It is a nicely cohesive sounding pair which is usually a single DD strength. Male vocals are just a bit more correct than female vocals. Mid and treble detail are average, but no annoying peaks or dips mean a very nice casual listen. I would advise those with preference for natural, smooth and layered treble to audition before buying if possible. Same goes for the ones with shorter nozzles as their nemesis.\n\nThanks for reading and stay wonderful.\n\nPros: Has an interesting low-end like Cindy Crawford\n\nFull-range 11mm LCP Diaphragm delivers smoothness and full-range accountability\n\nProbably one of the safest, yet still interesting tunes, which still holds character\n\nSmooth treble without any harsh sparkles\n\nNice forward Pinna Gain which offers imaging and adequate separation\n\nRelaxed attitude allowing for all day or night listening\n\nCohesive and correct timbre and reverberations\n\nA smooth style of pace resulting in musicality over technicalities\n\nNot the most vivid character, yet offering honest sincerity in tone and realism\n\nCons: A smooth style pace resulting in musicality over technicalities\n\nIEM nozzles slightly too short, which can be rectified by longer ear-tips\n\nEar-tips not of functional quality, neither wide-bore white or wide-bore black\n\nNot the biggest stage dispertion\n\nThe Kiwi ears Singolo\n\nRedcarmoose Labs April 17th, 2024\n\nA clean tune\n\nWhat does that mean? It simply means it is an IEM which has been tuned free from nonsense. A stature belonging to both even and correctness……..maybe even completeness. As such this sounds easy, but like riding a bike for the first time, a zig can result in a zag and you can fall-over. As such Kiwi ears has collaborated with the luminary known as Crinacle in order to utilize his tuning ideas and expertise. The results, while not perfect, are a NOOB’s dream. Yep, this Singolo does quite a few things right. This idea of correctness has some leeway in composition, yet this even tailored tune walks a specific line…….where others may fail by not adding enough bass, or thinking they are correct by making a smooth treble, yet still missing something? The masses take and the resulting group opinions can start to become a waterfall of sorts. Yep, everyone has a computer nowadays and they utilize it to voice their take on a specific IEM………where the proof comes out in the wash, so to speak.\n\nKiwi ears:\n\nI have reviewed a number of Kiwi ear IEMs as of late. My only real off-tune was the Kiwi ears Forteza.\n\nhttps://www.head-fi.org/showcase/kiwi-ears-forteza.26755/reviews#review-32736\n\nSadly (and this isn’t just my take) the Forteza was tuned to have this wild arraignment of two 10mm DDs and 1BA. In which one DD was lows, one DD was mids and a single BA for the highs. This in fact looks good on paper, yet the end tuning results were a mess, with that single BA shooting out inside the mix to proclaim this wild forwardness and brash steeliness. Released around the first of the year, it was in-fact my very last Kiwi ears review, gaining all of 3 out of 5 stars.\n\nFor as much as the Kiwi ears Forteza does wrong, the Singolo does it right. Yep, and you may think this is all subjective, that maybe it’s just me? Well, keep in mind Hybrids are my favorite methodology to make IEMs………and I absolutely loved the Kiwi ears Quintet. Really though you have to hand it to Kiwi ears for thinking out of the box. Yep, they are renowned for never making the same IEM twice, except for the Orchestra and Orchestra Lite. Yet this Singolo is remarkable, simply due to homing in on the cohesiveness of a single DD, and being in many ways the opposite of the Kiwi ears Quintet. Where the Quintet was four different methodologies of drives. And it kind-a did sound complicated like it had a 10mm DD, 2 BAs, 1 Planar and 1 Piezoelectric running…..because it did. Yet they somehow balanced the whole adventure. To me the Quintet is one of the very best values out there, becoming a high-detail-monster, all for the admission price of only $219.00.\n\nhttps://www.head-fi.org/showcase/kiwiears-quintet.26582/reviews#review-31155\n\nAnd finally I must talk about the Melody. This was Kiwi ear's idea of what a Planar should be. Again another incredible IEM. I mean in many ways you could purchase the Singolo, the Quintet and the Kiwi ears Melody and have a lot of bases covered. Meaning each IEM is well tuned yet has its very own intrinsic sound personality due to driver types. Where each IEM is special, and has personality, yet at the same time offers a slightly different way to experience your music.........while each still being correct.\n\nJust to get this out there, of all the planar IEMs I’ve tried, the Melody goes in the top 4 ever. This being my 218th review, I have heard my fair share of gear, yet the Singolo was still a welcome surprise. In fact at this point I am slightly jaded, where I see I’m getting another collaboration and in the price-point the Singolo lands and I say, well OK.\n\nYet Crinacle is my favorite collaborator……….it is just you really start to wonder if you have been there already, and done that already. Well, I can say the Singolo was a welcome surprise. More mature than the Zero 2, and more complete than the Zero MK1, better bass (and more note weight) than the 7Hz x Crinacle: Salnotes Dioko. What can I say? Truly this Kiwi ears Singolo is one IEM that even Crinacle has ended-up topping himself.\n\nThis is the best I have heard from Crinacle!\n\n$79.00\n\nhttps://www.linsoul.com/products/kiwi-ears-x-crinacle-singolo\n\nNow you’re probably wondering how it is different from a few IEMs out there, and I will get to comparisons. But first I’m going to talk about ear-tips.\n\nEar-tips:\n\nThe Singolo is one of the most ear-tip dependent IEMs I have ever heard. And I decided early on to not try and figure out why, because the why is irrelevant, it is what it is…….so lets learn about ear-tips.\n\nLeft to right:\n\nTop row: The silicone long wide bores, and the TANGZU Divinus Velvet silicone\n\nSecond row: My favorite silicone purple wide-bore ear-tips, then the Singolo wide bores\n\nMy ear-tip generalizations:\n\nSo if you are like me you have long standing (ear-tip) preferences from years of experience. You see, part of this IEM game is to learn about yourself, and which components work-out to provide the very best results.\n\nLearning:\n\nIn doing so, you still must try and keep an open mind, as new brands of ear-tips are always emerging. But to simplify stuff here, I have a favorite set of ear-tips. In the pictures they are the ones with purple centers. As such they are very shallow-donut, getting the nozzle-end close to your ear-drum, yet also holding the nozzle end near the edge, so that the dispersion of sonics gets the widest stage, never adding too much bass to mess with the pace. I have used these tips for close to 70 different IEMs in use through-out my reviews. Though they are not perfect. As getting the IEM so close physically to the ear, can have issues with the outside of the ear pushing back, creating a lack of air-tight fitment. I also kind a feel due to the outer length being short, it in itself can at times shorten the amount of outer surface area (material contact) with your ear tissue, which in turn can limit fit freedom of movement while an air-tight fitment is still achieved.\n\n2nd most used:\n\nThat is where the wide-bore silicone (longer) ear-tips come in handy. They will have a longer length which will make-up for any shortness of the nozzle. So the results are having the IEM sit farther out from your ear, yet still correct as the length is correct and positioning is perfect, with most shorter nozzle IEMs. Thus you don’t hear the outside fighting with the IEM in position to lose air-tight fitment. This was the ear-tip used almost exclusively with the Kiwi ears Singolo.\n\nTANGZU Divinus Velvet silicone ear tips:\n\nIt must be stated that in many ways the Divinus Velvet is special. Contrary to what you may guess, one test is to try the ear-tips with no music playing first. This way you can judge the ambient outside noise coming in around the tip-placement. The Divinus have a strange way of making the treble airy, and the best way to compare is obviously changing mid-song with your standard favorite ear-tips. What can I say, much of this has to do with what kind of bedsheets you’re used to. Get a new style of material and it may take a while before your mind lets you perceive the realities in store. But if you note the Divinus Velvet's back portion sound tube opening, it is the smallest circumference in the group. See the small circle? This actually expends out along the nozzle wall to become of a regular size.\n\nWhile not quite as long as the (above) silicone long wide-bore, they have a nice sound and are my second most used ear-tips with the Singolo. Second most used as they don’t have the mid-length girth like my preferred wide-bore longer tips do, so they feel slightly less secure. As it turns-out (always) the middle structure and pressure pushing outward is key to liking ear-tips and gaining fitment. If the tip in question (regardless of personal size) doesn’t exert quite enough back-pressure from side-wall material and make-up, the resulting air-tight fitment can be marginal…….as (the problem) found with both pairs of included ear-tips.\n\nIncluded tips:\n\nLaughably the included tips showed their wall-thinness in the pictures, unexpectedly. This is the reality of how they are. Upon first opening the Singolo box, it was refreshing to find two sets of wide-bore ear-tips, yet with further usage, it was determined the build quality was just not substantial enough. I mean sure they will work for the NOOB, only there is a chance that even that owner can substitute the included tip for a different wide-bore.\n\nLeft to right:\n\nTop row: The silicone long wide bores, and the TANGZU Divinus Velvet silicone\n\nSecond row: My favorite silicone purple wide-bore ear-tips, then the Singolo wide bores\n\nThe affecting components:\n\nEar-tips, cable choices, DAP character choices and EQ all go to dial-in the desired tone. Obviously IEM DIP-switches also add to the change of tone when included with a design.\n\nAs such these concepts are on-going and present repeatable results for the enthusiast. The concept of stage resulting from a wider nozzle (ear-tip) end. The bass curtailment is found with a wider nozzle ear-tip, or the opposite………..of deeper bass response with a narrower stage found from narrow opening bore ear-tip. The cable choices, while often questioned by half of Head-fi, also go to add their distinct personalities of bass pace, or stage displacement. The make-up and design construction of cables can change the stage perception and even imaging, which just by its nature can be accented by the ear-tips.\n\nSuch changes start obviously with the source file, of it being an older recording, or new, with new stage broadening effects and resolution. But along with the file we find amplifier technology (which can just be their innate properties) bringing the tonality and stage into different proportions. As such…….my reviews of ear-tips become only my singular experience, along with amplification and cables, bringing about a style of synergy in the end, that combined with individual ear-canal anatomy and neurological preferences, becomes of only a suggestion at best. Yet there is Head-fi. Yep, a place where many subjective ideas become quantified into a style of objective reality by many people singularly finding parallel ideas to take place. That is one important reason Head-Fi is hear, to share success stories.\n\nIEM Comparisons:\n\nHere I do side-by-sides to locate the quality differences between a few similarly priced IEMs.\n\nLeft to right\n\nTop row: Kiwi ears Singolo, TANGZU FUDU\n\nBottom row: The 7Hz SONUS and the SIMGOT EA500 LM Edition\n\nThe test subjects:\n\n1) Kiwi ears Singolo: 1DD-11mm LCP: $79.00 (comes in black or blue) 4 grams each:\n\n2) TANGZU FUDU: 1 DD-10mm x 2BA: $89.00 4 grams each:\n\n3) The 7Hz SONUS: 1DD-11.3mm x 1BA: $59.99 (choice of black, red or grey) 5 grams each:\n\n4) Simgot EA500 LM Edition: 1DD-10mm Lithium Magnesium: $89.99 11 grams each:\n\nBefore I get started, to reiterate themes from a prior comparison, the FUDU was the odd-man-out.......being it needed an audiophile DAP or Dongle to come alive, yet other than that, each of these four choices was cream-of-the-crop as far as sound per dollar goes………being roughly the same price, each is special at what they offer in comparison to the crowded marketplace.\n\nAnd really before we even get started (it must be said) that a choice of any of the four would be a win for the purchaser. People may question why I chose these three to compare to todays Singolo........... and the answer to that is they came out recently, and go to show the state of the art of under $100.00 IEM construction.\n\nIn fact while at times I will choose a more expensive IEM to try and highlight deficiencies in a product, none of that nonsense is needed here. The Kiwi ears Singolo is a perfect example of how to tune an IEM for broad likability. Yes, the Singolo has its own character, yet that character is likable, especially something to come to if you have been burned by too much treble heat or too much lumbering bass tones.........ruining pace. In fact the Singolo is a style of honesty and during these side-by-sides went one step farther to remind me of the sophisticated, and together, yet soft (polite) inviting tune that was the hallmark of the Zero MK1 and Zero MK2. I will do my very best to differentiate between the four. Using the Sony WM1A, SIMGOT LC7 cable in 4.4mm, and the longer wide-bore ear-tips to reduce any dissimilarities from how they are driven.\n\nThe FUDU:\n\nStarting with the FUDU, this is why there is nothing else like doing these side-besides to try and ascertain a style of reality. Right off the FUDU seems easier to drive? That may end up trouble for the Singolo later in the review as typically the FUDU is hard to drive to maximum qualities. Still the FUDU contrasts are of splendor and offer bigger differences between the treble and bass. In fact the FUDU bass is clearer and of more substantial texture…….simply holding that Hybrid separation, especially in contrast to the actual BAs in FUDU action. While sure, I can go forward and say the Singolo is more coherent, that trait means very little at this point in time. I need to do more IEM changes to now concentrate on stage differences. Really the FUDU stage is bigger holding more detail and what comes with that is possible off-timbre, but to tell you the truth at this point I really don’t hear any……making the FUDU simply the better IEM, holding those extra details that comes with owning extra drivers and the separation that comes forth. I mean, sure the FUDU is famous for this style of bass, in that it is big, detailed to a point and separated…….we maybe (some of us) could have already guessed this…..but the difficulty in driving factor of the Singolo……that was a surprise, I will test it with a phone later in this review. In ending this comparison I can’t help but include the extended nozzle length which the FUDU holds, going deeper and more inline with a regular fit, with a larger selection of ear-tips. I mean I feel bad to use the word sleepy for the Singolo, but that is the very best descriptor when comparing the FUDU to it? Later in the music section we will learn of the Singolo’s good points, yet in this trial, the FUDU comes out ahead.\n\nThe 7Hz SONUS:\n\nHere is the very definition of doing a lot with a little. I’m a little scared at this point with how our first test went? While the Singolo bass is pretty much even with the SONUS, it is holding longer fall-off and even more note weight up the line. As such the BA the SONUS sports is holding more separation into lesser perceived reverberations, though standing out in the mix, opposed to the singularity presented by the Singolo.\n\nHere it is learned both the SONUS and Singolo have lesser bass thrusters than the FUDU, making them like closer brothers.\n\nI mean it is almost not fair...........the levels of textures put out by the FUDU in action? Where once again another IEM besides the Singolo is also feeling bigger and better in relation to nozzle length. Where literally everything is closer to home with the Singolo. The vocals are not dislocated into any extra relief inside the stage. While sure there may be a hint of off-timbre that becomes the natural outcome with BA use, I can’t help but hear the tones finding more vividness and contrast when born?\n\nWhile maybe they lack the realness of the Singolo, they are better heard and become slightly more audiophile. Sorry, I regularly like Hybrids the best, anyway…….for these exact reasons found.\n\nSingolo IEM tested by Crinacle himself\n\nSimgot EA500 LM Edition:\n\nWell, this should be a fun one, as now we are back to a DD, in this fiasco. Well the total first thing noted (maybe as expected) is the bass with the EA is lots like the FUDU.\n\nYet the vocals now are more pushed-out than the Singolo finding a place somewhere between our BA performers, while not quite as vivid as the 7Hz SONUS or FUDU, holding a more natural timbre………of course you knew that was coming.\n\nSo the question is which is better, the EA at $10.99 more or the Singolo?\n\nThe most different thing the EA does, besides bass, is it adds a 5kHz peak, which the Singolo does alternatively instead offering a smooth large scale rise from 3 to 4Khz.\n\nWhere in reality this Singolo slope starts even at 1kHz then smoothly travels up peaking at 3kHz to 4kHz before continuing further into 6kHz. When you combine the Singolo upper mids with the 68dB bass then you can see this easy going nature.\n\nWhere the EA is also there is more mid-bass found at 200Hz being 63dB where the Singolo is at 60 dB. Though I feel the most difference comes from the heard at 5kHz with the EA making a noted 72dB peak.\n\nAs such the extra energy from the EA500 LM takes notice and helps delineate aspects found in that critical part of the treble. Where these differences besides technicalities, go to make each IEM response very different. The EA 500 is more vivid and contrasty, the Singolo coming off more relaxed and tame.\n\nWhat this does (combined with the 2.8 kHz peak) it goes to push EA vocals forward giving an almost style of BA separation and contrast to the EA sound.\n\nWhat the results of all this mean to you my reader is that the Singolo can be found to be more relaxed and maybe even more cohesive in comparison to the EA500 LM.\n\nThe Singolo listen ends less fatiguing, and simply allows higher volume levels. Yes the stage is slightly less filled out with the Singolo, holding fewer levels of itemization.\n\nYet also somehow I was brought into my memories of the two 7Hz Zero’s both MK1 and MK2, going and showcasing a softer, smoother even organic display of Singolo character.\n\nAll this to the point I heard the EA500 LM taking on an overall metallic stance, that while proving better in overall technicalities (by far) those technicalities were flashy and almost to a point garish.\n\nWhere the Singolo simply was set back, and offered a humble yet even more true rendition of the tones, leaving the sparkles and fanfare to the showboat EA500 LM to do all the time.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSingolo and EA500 LM conclusion:\n\nWow, I really didn’t expect this style of altercation. Where sure the EA500 LM is basking in making stuff both more real-life and synthetic both at the same time. Real-life due to simply better imaging and faster transients, yet pushed into existence, where the Singolo was more true to timbre, yet offering a slower and more lazy, yet real rendition of tones. The Singolo was the more mature, older and wiser player, the EA the most brash and hostile provoker of the trebles. As such the treble EA peaks delineate a very different atmosphere, where it is the bar at closing when they have tuned-on every light in the house………..where the Singolo is those few moments after total closing when they energy of the night has died down……..and it is time to go home.\n\n$79.00\n\nhttps://www.linsoul.com/products/kiwi-ears-x-crinacle-singolo\n\nKiwi ears Singolo:\n\nDriver: 11mm dynamic driver\n\nFrequency response range: 20Hz-20KHz\n\nImpedance: 32 ohms\n\nCable Interface: 3.5mm\n\nPlug Type: Detachable 0.78mm 2Pin\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI would like to thank Kareena from Linsoul for the love and the Kiwi ears Singolo review sample.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThese are one person's ideas and concepts, your results may vary.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThe Kiwi ears Singolo has been had burn-in for 168 hours.\n\nLinsoul website: https://www.linsoul.com/\n\nLinsoul Aliexpress Store: https://ddaudio.aliexpress.com/store/2894006\n\nLinsoul USA Amazon Store link: https://www.amazon.com/s?i=merchant-items&me=A267P2DT104U3C\n\nEquipment Used:\n\nSony WM1Z Walkman DAP MrWalkman Firmware 4.4mm and 3.5mm\n\nSony WM1A Walkman DAP MrWalkman Firmware 4.4mm and 3.5mm\n\nSamsung Phone 3.5mm\n\nHiBy R3 II 3.5mm/4.4mm output and 3.1 USB Type-C output\n\nGO bar Dongle 4.4mm/3.5mm\n\nWait, you really want to read some more?\n\nOK.\n\nConstruction:\n\nWhat is KARS?\n\nKiwi Acoustic Resonance System. Basically it's a venting system which allows air into and out of the Singolo also at the same time adding resonances just like the round hole in an acoustic guitar.\n\nAs such the 3D printed body utilizes an exact chamber of convoluted tubing which is both connected to the outside and after a number of turns is also connected to the driver membrane area, so that there is no driver flex due to pressure build-up when attached to your ear. The nozzle ends are a metal alloy construction with a lip that holds ear-tips well. I get the impression after studying the Singolo that there is actually a separate chamber which takes up the whole underside of the faceplate. This has not been listed, but the top of the driver sound-tube enters the underside of the faceplate which is hollow. The top of the driver additionally has a sound tube which is a nozzle tube for the IEM sound to travel out of into the nozzle tip. So as of this year we are actually seeing many IEMs which make use of a part resin and resonance chamber combined pressure relief tubing. If you look you can see the start of the KARS system tubing originating from the underside of the driver which is open also to this resonance chamber. As such, what is different from IEMs in the past is very little air-space.\n\nAs this is 80% a solid IEM in construction. As such there are good and bad ramifications to an invention, being that in case of a fall, the entire shell can crack with nothing left to repair. The good part is better control of tolerances and more finite control over construction, with less human handywork, being the Singolo is almost entirely 3D printed. In fact what this bass tuning does is offer a smooth and slightly non-paced result. The bass attacks have a rumble, yet inside of that rumble there is a slow swagger of personality, which is not exactly perfect, but lovable. I like to call it a birthmark.\n\nWhere my best analogy for this style of bass is Cindy Crawford, that I for all-time will designate this bass as Cindy Crawford bass. Why? It is far from perfect, yet it is its lack of technicalities, which give it a sense of originality. Sure maybe the KARS system is performing this sonic act? Maybe it’s simply the 11mm driver size?\n\nWhatever it is, it is the slight lack of strict detail………….is what we get………..yet full-on musicality are the results here. There is a lumbering of sorts………a twist, which is not holding an edge, it is of a softer and more polite demeanor. This KARS bass tone walks the pace through, and takes it homebound in moving swaying style……….becoming one-of-a-kind in bass tone.\n\nCable:\n\nWhile there are no exact specifications as to the cable make-up, the included cable is nice, and a departure from what style of cable that have typically been included with Kiwi ears IEMs. This is noted by the L shaped plug, the 0.78mm 2Pins and the creation of their almost 7Hz design? Actually really strange to find, like 7Hz got in and switched cables on us?\n\nWeighing in at 11 grams the cable is not only ergonomic, it is light-weight. Seemingly going wherever you want, I can almost not imagine a better out and about cable to go with a Dongle or phone output? I hope to see more of this style of cable from other manufacturers in the future, as it is just nice. Note the small L and R demarcations prevalent.\n\nStandard phone use:\n\nOne of the biggest changes in IEM design since 2016 has been the basic attitude towards finding bass from a regular phone. I say this because really that has been a contrast to where many IEMs from the 2016 era always had the possibility of sounding thin and sterile from a phone. Well not anymore, and while probably the greatest feature in phone use IS the fact that we can tap into that KARS system bass response. With standard phone use the Singolo doesn’t have that drivability issue of the FUDU in the bass department. Nope, and while yes, the Singolo is hard to drive, we encounter such rebelliousness with having to max out our phone volume, yet are greeted with little or no distortion and a fluid big stage.\n\nI can totally see folks getting the Singolo and being smitten with regular phone use. Second to the bass, it is the lovely midrange separation and textured imaging that make phone use a win-win. Now my testing method here wasn’t just to grab a phone, but I did a cable test with a full-fledged DAP before moving the 3.5mm over to the phone to gain contrast in results.\n\nHiBy R3 II use:\n\nWith a blacker background we find enhanced imaging and increased stage from regular phone use. In fact the cost of the HiBy is way less than a regular phone nowadays, which makes it a no-brainer purchase here.\n\nThe size, and battery life, and simple user interface…………. combined with a Swiss-army knife of options make the R3 II a must have if you ask me. The M signature response of the HiBy simply explodes the Singolo into musicality………I’m sorry but if you could see me moving my head to this sway and groove, you would understand.\n\nNowadays the price of equipment is secondary……...in contrast to exactly what you end-up choosing. Meaning its not how much you spend (to a point) it is just how much musicality you luck into with a new purchase.\n\nSo much of our little hobby has grown in sound quality for a value price, when the price of everything else in the world has skyrocketed. Just give me my Singolo and the HiBy R3 II and leave me alone……….I’m listening here. Oh, I almost forgot the SIMGOT LC7 is another add that fully actualizes the Singolo......adding a thickness simply from more wires in action. A medium budget cable which has perfect ear-hooks just like the included cable, though what it does besides more wires is has a modular plug enabling the 4.4mm output of the HiBy R3 II!\n\nThe HiBy R3 II with the GO bar Dongle:\n\nWhile the battery drain of the GO bar is not a treat you want to use for super long listening times. The results of playback due to HiBy 3.1 TypeC USB means you have access to laptop and GO bar power level output results while out on the road. When you get to your location, simply ditch the HiBy and simply plug the GO bar into a laptop for (the identical) next level audiophile experience. Yep, this takes the cake with simply more (GO bar) constructed imaging and a slightly smoother style, a more sophisticated level of playback, only second to my WM1A or WM1Z. And if you're wondering if the Singolo scales up, yes it does. I could go on…….but this is not a review of the GO bar.\n\nMusic:\n\nAll music tests were done with the (4.4mm plug option) LC7 cable, the Sony WM1A with MrWalkman’s firmware, and the slightly longer wide-bore silicone ear-tips.\n\nGhost\n\nPhantomime\n\nPhantom Of The Opera (Iron Maiden cover)\n\n48 kHz - 24 bit\n\nHere is a song that is well recorded and showcases pace, timbre and stage. I was never a fan of the original song, but this version shows an ample amount of excitement. The opening showcases both guitar and a bass track which mirrors. While sure the guitar finds itself composed of multiple tracks into formation on the far right and stage left, the bass is dialed into where it should be, right in the center. Probably the most important start off is at 00:00 where there is a bass accent fully formed and clear, holding none of any style of lumbering or lack of pace. In fact the very first thing we key into is just how natural and real sounding our bass guitar work played out. Just the fact that the bass is more compressed here at the start and the wide guitar reverberations take precedence. I mean you want that click-clack of the bass to become centered as the tones are in center focus here. At 00:26 we realize that whoever covers this song it will always be Maiden sounding at the core……as that is who wrote it.\n\nAt 00:35 there is the introduction of balance, I mean a balance of so many separated and delineated entities taking each section of the stage as its own. In fact just the clarity found here is both a testament to the Singolo’s ability and the recording quality. But dealing with forward chord statements…….power chord statements no less………we are reassured as to the upper midrange tuning finding a welcome home, while still not critically blasting those tones into finite forwardness…….they are our friends……..we have made total peace with the power chords...........both in tone and placement into the stage. At 00:38 we hear the backing chorus basically doing a regular additive, adding dimension and polish.\n\nAt 01:03 the main vocals arrive. Tobias Forge has introduced us to an exquisite use of a cover, that while still sounding like Maiden, there seems to be extra creative room for Tobias Forge to make the song his very own. Basically to me a song that is (still questionably) better than the original. Here we find the Progressive Rock elements that were always in the background of NWOHM........only concentrated on in this Phantom OF The Opera Maiden song. Yep, this could be considered Progressive Rock, still walking that line with the added power chords of Metal………perfect. At 01:28 the Hammond B3 keys go into action to almost Jon Lord-ify the number. I mean what would this song be if they left the Deep Purple vibe out? Nothing……….that is where it would sit. Only at this point, just like the backing chorus, the B3 sounding organ is an embellishment and doesn’t come near taking center stage. At 01:54 we arrive at delight taking in the fast studio pan effect (reverb) put onto Tobias’s vocals. And to reiterate on that reverb, the reverbs here, especially with the guitar are natural and nice, holding a realism with fall-off and note weight, better than any Hybrids with BA noise makers, ever thought of doing. The notes of reverberation are simply longer and drawn-out to their conclusion. That is the Singolo in a nut-shell………provocative reverbs. That and believe it or not correctness both of tone and pace.\n\nAt 02:58 an epic lead takes place…….and we are given it all, nothing left out, at least in excitement of emotion anyway. Then more layers of guitar lead…..this is Tobias making a song for the concerts he plays………to keep the vibe of Metal alive and be true to it. And at 03:20 we somehow come face to face with the use of a Wah Pedal. Probably the pedal was in effect throughout, but has now identified itself as its very own instrument for the playing. Yep, seemingly walking out-front and taking control of the song. It is in these virtuoso instances that we find the soul of the moment, swept far away from our daily lives into the world of Rock.\n\nAt 04:05 we are greeted with a bass note, and actually this instance shows us the bass personality at hand, that while clean and correct, the bass is not in any way overboard, too much or too little. It is humble, yet correct and at this point (even polite)………..I realize I am at terms with the Singolo sound in total.\n\nFinally we are (starting to be) brought to a style of climax, a climax inside a song that sounds almost like a climax all the way though. Just like the start of the song, there are the same instruments. There is a specific use of repeating themes which brings about a familiarity, yet at this point we are in the middle of a style of wind-up……..yep. The pace of the song seems to be brought into a speedier pace. It’s at 04:44 when all the listeners are now in sync, yep everyone knows the song, even if it was the first time they heard it. Eye contact is made with your partner and air-guitars take creation. You know that imaginary string instrument that somehow shows-up out of no-where.\n\nEveryone rides onward into the power of the power chord, with slight smiles just in the corner of their mouth. This is, and will always (forever) be known as Rocking Out. At 05:02 the lead starts again, and because everyone knows it, the fingers go into action, playing each note….imaginary of course. Though at 05:20 a surprise happens……yep the leads are so good we are spellbound to listen…….they get respect and no more tomfoolery takes place. We stop as the real guitars are in the room……they require concentration……..and honor. At 05:29 another guitar approaches from the right…….a second guitar lead to join in……now they are tag teaming one, then another, then another……….it doesn’t ever get better than this. Finally, finally at 06:24 they are in unison, and filling the stage. Still we are not even finished, it is that over-the-top Progressive Rock Over-The-Top-ness. The excessiveness that too much is never too much…..ever.\n\nHans Zimmer\n\nInception OST\n\nOld Souls\n\n44.1 kHz - 16 bit\n\nThere is delicateness to the beginning piano notes, that at 00:23 they hold an ambiance of reverb and the Singolo nails it. At 00:54 the bass drop occurs. That while even at this exact price point I have heard a bigger stage, more contrast by other IEMs produce a feeling of detail and get the next level of emotional involvement. Yet that is not the goal of the Singolo performance…….no here we are partaking of a purer performance, holding note-weight and timbre……reverberations and fall-offs. Maybe the name of this is organic? Yet there is an honesty which is un-arguable and consistent where it could be said that more stage gets you more immersion, and I will agree…….except this style of playback is also emotional, but not due to overall size, but more sincerity of life? Like if you needed exact background music while at work and didn’t need the flash, but still wanted a purity when that set of chords went and grabbed your thoughts. You in-fact would not question them, not the timbre, not the decays abound, nor the treble would ever creep into your workspace. Because we all know of the music genres that are distracting, that emit an energy that is too much for concentration to occur. Yet with the Ghost song we found enough detail and correctness, a finite pace that rocked-us-out. Yet here is the same, only the song chose the pace, one of a sleepier and romantic idea of a song. And that is two examples of both sides of the coin, a coin that is illustrating the profound easygoing yet well-rounded demeanor the Singolo can’t help but parley 100% of the time.\n\nPackage:\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Singolo walks that line, a line of both moderation and poise, of sophistication and temperament…….to become many different sounds by a changing of tips, yet all the ear-tips sound correct, only changing bass effectiveness and stage, midrange imaging and treble placement. Of course the widest and more shallow spread the stage out the farthest, yet the physicality of the nozzle didn’t allow me such freedom in use. So I chose the longer wide-bore silicones……and life went on. I mean this tuning is so (in a way) careful and soft. Soft due to the upper midrange Pinna Gain always being controlled. Even if you have heard as many IEMs as I, there is a place where you shake your head at just how careful this line is that they walked. That while impressive with bass, this still could be considered a vocal IEM, especially for those out there that are sensitive to forward vocals. And while sure, there are better technical IEMs for the same price, the technicalities take a back seat and are replaced by realism, not from wide-spread imaging but by correctness of tuning, that and timbre and ample reverberations. As such the Singolo plays great off a phone, that while maxed out in phone volume, we still have great bass sculpturing and that slightly bouncy roll and sway that makes the KARS system something we will hear again implemented. That for the NOOB the Singolo is really the ticket, as long as you can still find fitment with aftermarket ear-tips. And for the seasoned veteran in this game of acquisitions, the Kiwi ears Singolo brings an unstoppable character that is neither boring or too garish. To me, I kept getting déjà vu reminding me of the 7Hz Zero MK1 and even more MK2. And if you have read even a few of my reviews here, I hold those IEMs at the top of how to tune an IEM. It is through this midrange imaging that they stole my heart, and the Singolo is continuing that specific legacy into the future."
