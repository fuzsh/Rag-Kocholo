        "text": "Memes are currently playing a formative role in the externalising of cultural memory, acting as replicators of social, scientific and other knowledge and as core elements of Web 2.0 culture with its focus on creating and sharing user-generated content in a collaborative, globalizing context. More than other network phenomena memes may help us explain how the internet is structured, showing the extent to which its surface chaos is in reality a highly organized system of practices of dispersion and diffusion. Recent work has made clear that it is possible to employ the meme as a prism for understanding certain tendencies within social networking without embracing the whole set of implications ascribed to this new 'genre' over the years. On the whole, however, critics and scholars have rather neglected the semiotic dimension of meme communication, focussing on complexities of aesthetic form only where necessary and largely ignoring the instabilities of meaning-production in the process of remixing visual and written meme 'messages'. Categories such as \"form\", \"content\" or \"stance\" (L. Shifman) fail to convincingly explain how memes work as formulas of media contents, importing as they do a single authorial intelligence responsible for having processed all content individually and thus over-emphasizing the power of human agency. This project argues that it needs a solid understanding of semiotics to understand memes and the series of patterns they help shape and diffuse. As they are mostly dependent on embarrassing moments of visual capture, they cannot insist on having a primarily informational or even symbolical meaning. In fact, they are predicated on a signifying accident (or \"third meaning\", as Roland Barthes would have argued) any reader may take up and develop into a new and justifiable meaning. Evolving from a situationally bounded generating process, memes are also exemplars of a level of meaning-production Julia Kristeva has adequately termed \"signifiance\". Their innovation in terms of aesthetic form lies in their productive violence and their underscoring of the limits of socially useful discourse, pointing as they do to the semiotic and unconscious processes that exceed the subject and its rationalising processes."
