        "text": "These posters were issued to celebrate the publication of the deluxe edition of Robert Lebel's monograph on Duchamp and catalogue raisonné of his oeuvre, Sur Marcel Duchamp and for the occasion of the the related exhibition (5-30 May 1959) at La Hune bookstore in Paris.\n\nThe title Marcel dechiravit incorporates the invented word 'dechiravit', a contraction of the French verb déchirer (to tear) and the adverb vite (quick). It alludes to the process Duchamp employed to create Self-Portrait in Profile - for each version the artist tore from a sheet of colored paper his profile portrait using a metal template outlining his profile. It is also a word play on the method of classical artists who signed their graphic work 'delineavit et sculpsit.' (who 'drew and carved' the work)"
