        "text": "This is my MA dissertation completed at the University of Essex in 2003. When I begun researching just after Easter of that year, I was still unsure whether I was an art historian or not. My undergraduate studies was within Fine Art and I thought that doing an MA in Art Theory and Art History would help develop my diminishing art practice. The experience of writing the dissertation helped me decide that I was more art historian than artist. I share it here out of nostalgia (I'm writing these lines pretty much twenty years after the research begun!) and because some people might find it useful or interesting. Essentially, the dissertation is a close examination of Marcel Duchamp's Fountain, arguing that this a temporally extended work (definitively unfinished, one might say) in which notions of authorship, dating, even its own status as a readymade are continuously undone and displaced. Hardly anyone saw Duchamp's readymade in 1917 and everybody since has only seen it at a remove. Indeed, the replicas seen in various museums are sculptural reproductions made to resemble the lost readymade exactly based on a photograph. In a way, this dissertation seeks to justify those replicas against the negative reception they (and Duchamp, too) garnered in the 1960s amongst artists you might imagine to be sympathetic towards Duchamp's practice."
