        "text": "Is the work a derivative work? How can you tell?\n\nWhile a work is protected by copyright, only the owner of the copyright in that work has the right to create, or to authorize someone else to create, a new version of that work. But what about public domain works? Arenât they free for the taking? Yes ... but even when a work is in the public domain, a new work thatâs based on it may be protected by copyright.\n\nHow? Letâs see.\n\nA derivative work is a new version of an already existing work\n\nLetâs start with a definition. A âderivative workâ is based on (or derived from) one or more already existing works. Itâs a new version of the work, basically. Derivative works include things like translations, musical arrangements, dramatizations, fictionalizations, art reproductions, and condensations. (If you want the statutory definition, see 17 USC Â§ 101.)\n\nMaybe some examples would help?\n\nAll of these would be copyrightable derivative works (just to give you an idea), as long as they were original works of authorship:\n\nA screenplay based on a novel (an adaptation)\n\nA translation into of an English language novel into Russian\n\nA translation of a work into a new medium, such as a written work into an audio book\n\nA recording of a song remixed with an already existing song\n\nA book of maps based on public domain maps, and including some new maps\n\nA lithograph based on a painting\n\nA biography of someone that contains their journal entries and letters\n\nAn arrangement of words and music based on a piece by Bach\n\nA new musical arrangement based on a traditional folk song\n\nA computer program that revises or modifies the source code of an already existing program, or translates it into another computer language\n\nA pictorial version (graphic novel; comic book) of a public domain novel\n\nA fictionalization of a factual work, such as a novel based on a historic account of a battle\n\nAn abridgement (a shortened or condensed version) of a novel\n\nA drawing based on a photograph\n\nA sculpture based on a photograph\n\nThe derivative work must borrow from the prior work\n\nTo qualify as a derivative work, the derivative must use a substantial amount of the prior workâs expression. How much? Enough so that the average person would conclude that it had been based on or adapted from the prior work. Itâs a common sense thing. (Which means itâs great fodder for argument ... you know, that thing lawyers love to do.)\n\nMerely borrowing the ideas expressed by the prior work (creating a work âinspired byâ it) would not create a derivative work. Ideas are not copyrightable. A work is not derivative unless it has been substantially copied from a prior workâs expression. See Litchfield v. Spielberg, 736 F.2d 1352, 1357 (9th Cir. 1984).\n\nHereâs a famous (some would say infamous) example ...\n\nPhoto by Art Rogers\n\nSculpture by Jeff Koons\n\nArtist Jeff Koons bought a note card displaying Art Rogersâ photo of a group of puppies with their owners, tore the copyright notice off the card, and hired an Italian foundry to make four sculptures based on the photograph. Rogers sued, and the court decided that Koonsâ sculpture was an infringing derivative work rather than a parodic fair use.\n\nWhy? Because the similarity was so close that the average person would recognize the copying. So ... the sculpture was found to infringe Rogersâ copyright. Because the court found the works to be so similar (they call it âsubstantial similarityâ) the small changes Koons made didnât save him from infringement.\n\nKoonsâ additions, such as flowers in the coupleâs hair, and the puppiesâ blue coats, did not change the fact that the sculptures were overwhelmingly similar to the protected expression of the original work. See Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301 (2d Cir 1992).\n\nThe differences canât be trivial\n\nTo be eligible for copyright, a derivative work must be different enough from the original to be considered a ânew workâ or must contain a substantial amount of new material. Making minor changes, or adding little of substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new version for copyright purposes. So ... adding or deleting punctuation wonât cut it; neither will spelling changes or correcting typos. The new material must be original and copyrightable in itself. Titles, short phrases, and format, for example, are not copyrightable.\n\nSo, to take an example from the web ... simply reproducing a public domain text in digital form would not create a derivative work. But adding links to new material, or adding sound or images to the work to enhance it likely would create a derivative work.\n\nWhat gets the copyright in a derivative work?\n\nThe copyright in a derivative work covers only the additions, changes, or other new material appearing for the first time in the work. It does not extend to any preexisting material. That means the copyright in a derivative work based on public domain material does not restore the copyright of the public domain material. And it doesnât prevent anyone else from using the same public domain work for another derivative work.\n\nIf itâs a derivative work ...\n\nOkay, letâs wrap this up. If the already existing work is in the public domain ... then only the new material thatâs been added to it is entitled to copyright protection. The original work remains in the public domain. Just remember that the new material added by the derivative author is not in the public domain.\n\nSo what should you do if you want to use the work? The quick answer is ...\n\nUse only those portions of the derivative work that are from the original public domain work. It wonât always possible to do this. For example, you couldnât use any part of a copyrighted English translation of Virgilâs Aeneid, even though the Aeneid is in the public domain, because the entire translation would be protected by copyright. In that case youâd need to look for a translation whose copyright had expired. (Like the 1909 Harvard Classics translation by John Dryden.)\n\nIf youâre using a derivative work, watch out for these ...\n\nWhen youâre dealing with derivative works based on public domain material, pay particular attention to:\n\nNotes, illustrations, introductions, and the like. The added (new) material will most likely be copyrighted. Sometimes the workâs copyright notice will make clear exactly what the derivative author is claiming copyright for ... but not always.\n\nCoding of online copies of public domain works. The Copyright Office has stated that digitizing an already existing work doesnât create a copyrightable derivative work. Digitized versions are copies, and their copyright status depends on that of the preexisting work. See 53 Federal Register 189 (Sept. 29, 1988). But the format of a web page and the code used to create it are copyrightable ... so be careful not to copy them.\n\nNote: To my knowledge there hasnât yet been a court decision on copying digitized public domain texts. But a federal court has held that âslavish copiesâ of public domain paintings are not copyrightable as original works of authorship. See Bridgeman Art Library, Ltd. v. Corel Corp., 25 F.Supp. 2d 421 (S.D. N.Y. 1999), which you can read here. For a work to be copyrightable it must be original, and originality consists of independent creation and a minimum degree of creativity.\n\nBe careful with âdefinitiveâ editions, especially when they include previously unpublished material. Hereâs an example: The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition (Martin Gardner ed., 1999), which was described in Library Journal as follows:\n\nClarkson Potter published The Annotated Alice in 1960, and Gardner published the sequel More Annotated Alice in 1990. Here, Gardner combines and expands both to produce The Definitive Edition. This presents the full texts of Aliceâs Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, and âThe Wasp in a Wig,â a âsuppressedâ chapter of Looking-Glass. Each of these texts is accompanied by a lengthy marginal commentary that identifies historical and literary references and allusions, explains Carrollâs logical and mathematical puzzles, and interprets colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions.\n\nThomas L. Cooksey, Armstrong State Coll., Savannah, GA\n\nCopyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\nThe bookâs copyright notice indicates that copyright is claimed in the entire edition, even though Lewis Carrollâs works are in the public domain in the US. Youâll find this is often the case with scholarly works.\n\nCarroll died in 1898, but this book was published in 1999. As for the âsuppressedâ chapter of Looking-Glass â the galley proofs turned up at Sothebyâs auction house in 1974. (Itâs an episode where Alice meets a foul-tempered wasp, by the way.) The proofs had been bought at a sale of Carrollâs personal belongings in 1898 and had never been published. And hereâs where it gets interesting ...\n\nBecause this newly found unpublished work was created before January 1, 1978, and published before December 31, 2002, it will be protected by copyright through December 31, 2047. (Who said copyright law wasnât fun?)\n\nFinally (whew!), the editorâs selection and arrangement of Carrollâs works might be copyrightable themselves ... which brings us to our next topic, compilations."
