        "text": "MY INITIAL INSPIRATION\n\nMary Swanzy’s, ‘Propellers’ (1942), was my initial inspiration for this essay when I visited the ‘Lines of Vision Exhibition’. She used colour to evoke movement, moving from Cubism to Orphism. She was inspired to portray new technology.\n\nMarcel Duchamp used muted ochres of browns and yellow to portray movement in his mechanised ‘Nude Descending a Staircase, No.2’ (1912), but this painting was not recognised as a Cubist painting, or futuristic for that matter.\n\nBoth Swanzy and Duchamp lived through times of war, mechanisation, technology, photography and cinema which all impacted on their artistic endeavours and was reflected in their work. There were no boundaries put in front of these artists as to what they painted, that was their choice. However, there were styles of painting to which artists had to conform, or their work was not recognized or accepted. These artists pushed boundaries and wanted to create and expand their work, and communicate through the medium of their art; this progression of their art was influenced by mechanisation and technology.\n\nMary Swanzy (1882-1978) – ‘Propeller’s 1942; Oil on canvas – Orphism Style\n\nExhibited in The National Art Gallery of Ireland; hanging beside Colum McCann’s piece of literature;\n\n“…..The women piled into the factory…….the propeller’s were sent off to their men, the women remained behind in the factory, creating the thing that might one day fly; a secret longing for colour.”\n\nMARCHEL DUCHAMP\n\nDuchamp painted his ‘Nude Descending a Staircase No.2’ in 1912 to illustrate a poem written by Jules Laforgue.\n\n‘Nu Descendant Un Escalier – Numero 2’ – 1912.\n\nOil on canvas – Cubist Style. Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968)\n\nDUCHAMP & TECHNOLOGY\n\nDuchamp, was born in France but became a Naturalised American. The ‘Nude’ is exhibited in The Philadelphia Museum of Art, in the Louise & Walter Arensberg Collection.\n\nDuchamp asked Constantin Brancusi, during a visit to the Paris Aviation Show of 1919;\n\n‘Painting’s washed Up. Who’ll do better than that propeller? Tell me, can you do that?’\n\nDuchamp’s title to this painting is printed in capitals, ‘NU DESCENDANT UN ESCALIER’, and uses the French masculine form for the word Nude, creating an ambiguity, as to whether this nude is male or female; it is a mechanized human figure;\n\nThe ‘Nude’ represented no object but instead was “an abstraction of movement”. (Seigel, J.1997;pg.129).\n\n‘The machine is idolized as a tool and symbol of progress, and technological progress is equated with reductivist, streamlined art.’ (Esche,C. & Bradley,W.2007.pg.231).\n\nJohn Berger’s classic text entitled ‘Ways of Seeing’ (published in 1972), states;\n\n‘the Nude is both the surveyor and the surveyed; Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. Thus Beauty becomes competitive.’\n\nDuchamp made his ‘Nude’ unaware, by representing her head as a line. Now the Nude cannot look at the painter and through this anonymity there is objectivity. This impartial view of painting appealed to Duchamp and created an ambiguous vision. Duchamp’s ‘Nude’ was rejected by the Salon des Independants for both its title and Duchamp’s portrayal of the female nude. The following year at the New York Armory Show, it created a stir and established Duchamp’s reputation. By WWI, Duchamp rejected all ‘retinal art which was intended only to please the eye’. He wanted to evoke, to challenge and get participation from the viewer, creating an intellectual discourse, using semiotics which led him to further investigate new technologies, photography and film.\n\nThe ‘Nude’ was a significant point in Duchamp’s career and also in the history of American Art. Duchamp did not want to replicate the ‘Nude’ but instead moved forward to his ‘Readymades’ which Alfred Stieglitz photographed; the ‘Fountain 1917’ which was Stieglitz piece of photographic art.\n\nDUCHAMP, THE FUTURISTS & MAREY’S CHRONO-PHOTOGRAPHS\n\nDuchamp was adamant that there was no connection between the ‘Nude Descending a Staircase’ and futuristic painting by Balla (Dog with 20 Legs);in which a trotting dachshund’s legs are depicted as a blur of multiple images and captures repetition of the parts of movement, i.e. the lead, the dachshund’s legs and tail, the owners feet.\n\nGiacomo Balla, (1871-1958), a founding member of the Futurist Movement.\n\n‘Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash.1912’ (www.bittleston.com).Oil on Canvas.\n\nIn his interview with James Johnson Sweeney (JJS) entitled ‘The Great Trouble with Art In This Country’ (BBCTV 1966), Duchamp explains;\n\n‘my idea was to choose an object that wouldn’t attract me by its beauty or by its ugliness; to find a point of indifference in my looking at it. (1.20/3.16). I felt more like a Cubist that a futurist; I saw futurists in January 1912 when I saw the Balla with ‘The dog of 20 legs’. (9.49/9.56). Attracted by the problem of motion in painting, took me out of Cubism and led to the Nude; keeping only abstract lines of position and successive action of descending. (7.59/9.56).\n\nDuchamp and Balla were influenced by chrono-photography by Muybridge and Marey.\n\n‘MODERNISM’ AND ‘POSTMODERNISM’\n\n‘Nude Descending a Staircase No.2′ (1912) is a key painting of Modernism and Duchamp found the United States open to new ideas. (Sinfield, A.1997.pgs211&212). He was willing to push boundaries, perhaps at the expense of being rejected on one side (Europe) and infamous on the other (USA). Duchamp pushed boundaries in the modernist era, which resulted in Greenberg’s postmodernism declaration;\n\n‘that Conceptual art, as well as other “avant-gardist” movements that derived from Duchamp, “fascinating because of its desperation.” (artnews.com).\n\nWalter Benjamin (1936) states that with technology and mechanical reproduction, their culmination brought about ‘a shattering of tradition’.\n\n‘Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element; its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.’ (The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. pg.3).\n\nHowever, with all new technology, a new humanity emerges, and in this Century there is a new a new record of this postmodern society and the historical context will be harder to authenticate.\n\nWords, titles, and names on Duchamp’s works ‘add colour to the object’ (Duve, de T. 1991.pg.99) rather than using colourful pallettes (like the Orphists).\n\nDuchamp emerged out of cubism to a new hieroglyphic language with a brand new future ahead; the painter would become the semiotician (signs and symbols) of a future culture. (Duve, de T.1984;pg.142).\n\nMalevich and Mondrian understood that craft and the abandonment of craft are the same thing; and that continuous, successive, abandonments of craft made up the history of modernism. Artists were not starting from scratch but rather continuing to experiment whilst abandoning or even de-constructing tradition.\n\n‘What was abandoned was already dead, assassinated not by the painters but by historical, social, economic, technological conditions that, since the rise of industrialization, had made painting an impossible craft’. (Duve, de T.1984. pg.155).\n\nThis Nude’s avant-garde demeanor of decomposition and depiction of movement was to further coincide with the birth of cinema and chromo-photography and redefined space and time.\n\nDISCOVERING MYBRIDGE AND MAREY\n\nIn 1911, Duchamp discovered Marey’s chrono-photograph’s. In an interview with Katherine Kuh, Marcel Duchamp spoke about his ‘Nude Descending a Staircase’ and and the photographic motion studies of Muybridge and Marey (1830-1904);\n\n‘In 1912 … the idea of describing the movement of a nude coming downstairs while still retaining static…. particularly interested me…I had seen chrono-photographs of…horse galloping (stroboscopic photography) gave me the idea for the Nude. It doesn’t mean that I copied these photographs. The Futurists were also interested in somewhat the same idea, though I was never a Futurist. And of course the motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing then too.’\n\nDuchamp wanted to show a 3D image in motion and Eadweard Muybridges series of photographic images were reproductions of the same image but milliseconds apart.\n\nMuybridge’s series of a horse in motion using multiple-exposure technique in photography was a method Duchamp replicated in his painting of his ‘Nude’. Muybridge invented a zoopraixiscope, an early movie projector. In 1872, he was hired by a race horse owner, to prove scientifically what the human eye could not detect; the action of the galloping and trotting race horses showing that all four feet are off the ground during these movements; most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot on the ground.\n\nMuybridge’s ‘The Horse in Motion’,1878. (www.americanhistory.si.edu/Muybridge).\n\nMuybridge’s ‘Woman Walking Downstairs’, 1887.\n\nÉtienne-Jules Marey ‘Man Walking’, 1890-91.(www.wiki.Marey)\n\n‘Muybridge’s legacy is also evident in the later development of motion pictures.’ His influence on our visual culture has been profound.\n\n(www.americanhistory.si.edu/Muybridge).\n\n“Muybridge’s influence has forever changed our understanding and interpretation of the world, and can be found in many diverse fields, from Marcel Duchamp’s painting ‘Nude Descending a Staircase’ and countless works by Francis Bacon, to the blockbuster film The Matrix and Philip Glass’s opera The Photographer.” (www.tate.org.uk)\n\nCINEMA\n\nFrom the end of WW1 until the 1920’s, Duchamp moved from 2D to 3D, i.e. The Bicycle Wheel 1913, and worked with Andre Breton, Man Ray, Marc Allegret, Stieglitz and others through photography, music and some experimental cinema, i.e. Anémic Cinéma 1926, using his ‘Rotoreliefs’ (optics and motion). http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/rotoreliefs/flash/1/\n\nDuchamp explored movement in painting, using ambiguous linguistics. The appeal of cinematography was that film was an ensemble event; using semiotic chains, chains of meaning by way of denotation and connotation, exactly what Duchamp was trying to achieve. Language expands with technology and film is multi-modal. Cinema is linked to photography, cinematography is writing in movement and photography is writing in light. (James Armstrong 19Feb2015 Lecture). Film and cinema appealed to Duchamp as film wanted audience participation. ‘Film is what you can’t imagine’ (Denotative & Connotative Meaning).\n\nHINGED MIRROR\n\nThis photograph of Marcel Duchamp was taken with a hinged mirror, on June 21st 1912 (Beatrice Woods diary). It was a souvenir of a trip to a photo-booth with his friends, Beatrice Woods and Picabia, at the Broadway Photo Shop at 1591 Broadway, where they stopped on their way to Coney Island. You sit before a setup hinged mirror and are photographed by an attendant using a photo postcard machine. In 1910, the Chicago Ferrotype Company and the Day Dark Speciality Company were marketing cameras as Photo Postcard Machines. These machines functioned as a camera and laboratory, developing black and white photographs within 10 minutes.\n\nThere is a dialect here in this photo using semiotics. A photo of a real person in real time, and the copies/mirrored image in virtual space – an apparition or mirage. New technology allowed reproducibility, allowing for more abstract images, and manipulation of a moment in time.\n\nMarcel Duchamp (Hinged Mirror)1912. (www.JamesMcManus2208.pdf.pgs.125-137) & (Kuenzil, E & Naumann,F.M. 1989.pg.155)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nArt and Technology cannot be separated; from very early times, technology has helped with creation, even when Newgrange was created, technology was employed for advancement and decoration. Duchamp continuously experimented with all technology available to him at that time.\n\nArt alludes to the 3D world through its 2D images and Picasso in his ‘Les Demoiselles d’Avignon’ (1907), using monochrome browns and neutral colours, heralded the start of Cubism which had a short history, finishing with WWI. All new technology inspired art, artists and the avant-garde, and continues to inspire.\n\nNow in Postmodernism, culture over-rides style. We should recognize that there is now a mixture (‘cross-fertilsation’) of various cultural art traditions; we have pushed the boundaries, with ‘style’ previously confining the artist. Roland Barthes’ system of semiotics deciphers these new cultural ways of expression.\n\nAbstract art is not an image of truth but these artists have foresight, and perhaps even insight into another world, so who are we to question. Marcel Duchamp put into practice Kant’s theories about ‘Fine Art And Genius’.\n\n‘art can be tasteful (that is, agree with aesthetic judgment) and yet be ‘soulless’ – lacking that certain something that would make it more than just an artificial version of a beautiful natural object. What provides soul in fine art is an aesthetic idea. It is the talent of genius to generate aesthetic ideas.’ (Kant-Theory of Aesthetics).\n\nTechnology gives rise to new aesthetic ideas, and as President Higgins said (prior to being President) to a gathering of young people; ‘Passive Culture versus Active Culture’. It is all progress.\n\nPhotograph taken by Denise Kelly outside Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin 3/2015.Julian Opie (b.London 1958).\n\n‘Suzanne walking in leather skirt 2006.
