        "text": "Basic Information\n\nComplete the “Limitation of Claim” section to limit the scope of your copyright claim if the work submitted for registration contains an appreciable amount of unclaimable material.\n\nUnclaimable material includes the following types of material:\n\nmaterial that was previously published,\n\nmaterial that was previously registered,\n\nmaterial that is in the public domain, and/or\n\nmaterial that is owned by an individual or legal entity other than the claimant who is named in the application.\n\nDerivative works almost always contain unclaimable material because, by definition, they are based on, or incorporate, material that has been previously published, previously registered, is in the public domain, or owned by a third party. Likewise, compilations, including collective works, usually contain unclaimable material because they are often comprised of material that has been previously published, previously registered, is in the public domain, or owned by a third party.\n\nA “derivative work” is a work that is based on or incorporates one or more preexisting works. Examples of derivative works include translations, fictionalizations, abridgments, musical arrangements, screenplays based on preexisting novels, reproductions of paintings, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. Derivative works also include works consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, or other modifications, if these changes, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship. The right to make a derivative work (or new version) is one of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner. The copyright law does not protect any part of a work that contains previously copyrighted material if that material has been used unlawfully.\n\nA “compilation” is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.\n\nA registration for a derivative work only extends to the new material that has been added to that work. A registration for a compilation, including a collective work, only extends to the new original selection, coordination, or arrangement included in that work.\n\nMaterial Excluded\n\nCheck the appropriate box(es) under “Material Excluded” to describe and exclude any unclaimable material contained in the work submitted for registration, such as:\n\nMaterial that was previously published,\n\nMaterial that was previously registered,\n\nMaterial that is in the public domain, and/or\n\nMaterial that is owned by an individual or legal entity other than the claimant who is named in the application.\n\nIf the terms provided in the checkboxes do not fully describe the material to be excluded you may provide a more specific or detailed description in the field marked “Other.” (See the examples below for more information on completing the Material Excluded and New Material Included sections).\n\nPrevious Registration\n\nComplete this space if this work or another version of it has been previously registered.\n\nIf the Copyright Office has issued a certificate of registration, give the previous registration number and year in the space provided. If the Copyright Office has issued multiple registrations, give this information for the two most recent registrations. If an application has been submitted to the Copyright Office, but the Office has not yet issued a certificate of registration, state “pending” in the space for the registration number.\n\nDO NOT give preregistration information in this space (such as a number beginning with the letters PRE). Preregistration information should be given in the Publication/Completion area of the application.\n\nNew Material Included\n\nCheck the appropriate box(es) under “New Material Included” to describe all of the new material contained in the work that is owned by the copyright claimant. If the terms provided in the checkboxes do not fully describe the new material that is owned by the copyright claimant you may provide a more specific or detailed description in the field marked “Other.”\n\nPlease note that the descriptions provided in the “New Material Included” field should be identical to the descriptions provided in the “Author Created” field. The application also should name all of the author(s) who created the new material described in this section and in the “Author Created” section. (See the examples below for more information on completing the Material Excluded and New Material Included sections).\n\nExamples of Material Excluded and Material Included Statements\n\nLiterary\n\nVisual Arts\n\nSound Recordings\n\nPerforming Arts\n\nMotion Pictures"
