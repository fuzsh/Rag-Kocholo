DRAMA\n\n7. Drama Defined The word drama comes from the Greek meaning “to act, do or perform”, and it is in the several subtle and diverse meanings of “to perform” that drama can be said to have begun. Drama is one of the major forms of literature. As a literary form, it is designed for the theater because characters are assigned a role and they act out their roles as the action is enacted on stage. It is difficult to separate drama from performance because during the stage performance of a play, drama brings life experiences realistically to the audience. Drama is therefore presented in dialogue.\n\n8. Drama is an imitation of life. It is different from other forms of literature because of its unique characteristics. It is read, but basically, it is composed to be performed, so the ultimate aim of dramatic composition is for it to be presented on stage before an audience. This implies that it is a medium of communication. It has a message to communicate to the audience. It uses actors to convey this message. Drama mirrors the life, customs, manner and general living habits of the people.\n\n9. “A play is a just and lively image of human nature, representing its passions and humors and the changes of fortune to which it is subject for the delight and instruction of mankind”. - John Dryden\n\n10. “Drama is a composition in verse or prose intended to portray life or character or tell a story usually involving conflicts and emotions through action and dialogue and typically designed for theatrical performance”. - Webster’s English Dictionary\n\n11. “Drama is a composition in verse or prose and verse, adapted to be acted on the stage, in which a story is related by means of dialogue and action and is represented with accompanying gesture, costume and scenery as in real life”. - Shorter Oxford Dictionary\n\n12. “Drama is a composition designed for performance in the theatre, in which actors take the roles of the characters, perform the indicated action and utter the written dialogue”. - A Glossary of Literary Terms by M. H. Abrams\n\n13. Intertextuality Defined Intertextuality is the interconnection between similar or related works of literature that reflect and influence a reader’s interpretation of the text. It is a literary device that creates an interrelationship between texts and generates related understanding in separate works. The term “Intertextuality” was developed in 1966 by the French semiotician Julia Kristeva. She created the term from the Latin word “intertexto” which means to intermingle while weaving.\n\n14. Kristeva developed the term in order to synthesize Ferdinand de Saussure’s semiotics – the study of how signs derive their meaning within the structure of a text; and Mikhail Bakhtin’s dialogism – theory which suggests a continual dialogue with other works of literature and other authors, and his examination of the multiple meanings in each text (especially novels) and in each word (heteroglossia).\n\n15. Kristeva argued that all works of literature being produced contemporarily are intertextual with the works that came before it. As she stated, “Any text is constructed of a mosaic of quotations; any text is the absorption and transformation of another.”\n\n16. Point to Ponder: What is the implication of Kristeva’s theory? These references are made to influence the reader and add layers of depth to a text, based on the readers’ prior knowledge and understanding.\n\n17. The function and effectiveness of intertextuality can often depend quite a bit on the reader’s prior knowledge and understanding before reading the secondary text. Parodies and allusions depend on the reader knowing what is being parodied or alluded to.\n\n18. In a nutshell, intertextuality is a literary discourse strategy utilized by writers in novels, poetry, theater and even in non-written texts (such as performances and digital media). Examples of intertextuality are an author's borrowing and transformation of a prior text, and a reader's referencing of one text in reading another.\n\n19. INTERTEXTUALITY FIGURES\n\n20. 1. Allusion is a figure of speech, in which an object or circumstance from unrelated context is referred to covertly or indirectly. If the allusion is explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied), it is usually termed a reference. Examples of Allusion - He was lying so obviously, you could almost see his nose growing. - Jack and Rose are star-crossed lovers. - It’s hard being an adult. I wish I were a child forever. - Kimi (in Kimi Dora): “Why, am I my sister’s keeper?”\n\n21. 2. Quotation is the repetition of one expression as part of another one, particularly when the quoted expression is well-known or explicitly attributed by citation to its original source, and it is indicated by quotation marks.\n\n22. 3. A calque or loan translation is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word or root-for-root translation. When used as a verb, to “calque” means to borrow a word or phrase from another language while translating its components, so as to create a new lexeme in the target language. Examples of calque: 1. “flea market” – is a loan translation of the French marche aux puces (market with fleas) Danish loppemarked Dutch vlooienmarkt Finnish kirpputori German Flohmarkt Hungarian bolhapiac Italian mercato delle pulci 2. skyscraper Czech mrakodrap (cloud-scraper) Danish skyskraber (cloud-scraper) Dutch wolkenkrabber (cloud-scratcher) French gratte-ciel (scrapes sky) German wolkenkratzer (cloud scraper)\n\n23. 3. The computer mouse was named in English for its resemblance to the animal. Many other languages have extended their own native word for “mouse” to include the sense of the “computer mouse”. Spanish raton Swahili kipanya Turkish fare Danish mus Dutch muis Portuguese rato\n\n24. 4. Plagiarism is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense, punishable due to prejudicial causes such as copyright infringement. In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word “plagiarus” (kidnapper) to denote stealing someone else’s work was pioneered by the Roman poet Martial, who complained that another poet had “kidnapped his verses”. Plagiary, a derivative of plagiarus, was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist Ben Jonson during the Jacobean Era to describe someone guilty of literary theft.\n\n25. 5. Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text.\n\n26. 6. A parody (also called spoof or lampoon) is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original work – its subject, author, style, or some other target- by means of satiric or ironic imitation. Denis Diderot’s Encyclopedie distinguishes between the parody and the burlesque. “A good parody is a fine amusement, capable of amusing and instructing the most sensible and polished minds; the burlesque is a miserable buffoonery which can only please the populace.\n\n27. 7. Unlike parody, pastiche celebrates rather than mocks, the work it imitates. The word pastiche is a French cognate of the Italian noun pasticcio, which is a pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients. 8. Appropriation is a reworking or re-imagination of a well- known text, to change or extend its meaning. For example, Marcel Duchamp’s artwork, L.H.O.O.Q. is an appropriation of Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. Duchamp took an image of the painting and drew a moustache on it.\n\n28. 9. Adaptation. A film, TV, drama or stage play is based on a written work. For example, J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter has a film adaptation.\n\n29. Steps in Identifying and Analyzing Intertextuality 1. Read the passage to identify any clear intertextual references to literature, music, art, film or another text type.\n\n30. 2. Research or use your own knowledge of the text you have identified and find any themes or messages that can be linked to your current text.\n\n31. 3. Determine the significance of using the reference. - How does it compliment the author’s intended message? - Does it deepen your current understanding and perspective of the text? 4. Discuss your insights.\n\n33. What Is a One-Act Play? A one-act play is usually between 10-40 pages long, and is often called a “tenner” because of the short length. Writing one-acts can be an excellent way for new playwrights to learn the basics of story and character construction. While there are no set rules for how to write a one-act play, some basic guidelines may help clear away any confusing format or content problems.\n\n34. Traditional plays, and often one-act plays, sometimes conform to the unities of drama as discussed by the philosopher Aristotle. These guidelines suggest that a play should take place with a unity of location, time and action. In other words, one-act plays should have: - one location, - be set over a period of no more than one day, - and have one central plot.\n\n35. These unities are somewhat more helpful in writing one-acts, as the 10-40 minute running time will not leave a lot of room for set changes or subplots. A one-act play usually will have four or fewer characters that are developed in varying degrees. Depending on the story you are trying to tell, there may be one or more main characters.\n\n36. In some short plays, the roles are balanced equally; in others, some roles may only have a few lines. Even though your play is short, you should have a clear idea of who your characters are, what they want, and how they will try to get what they want.\n\n37. The most important element to any play is conflict. This does not necessarily mean fighting or arguing. A man being sad about throwing away his baby blanket is in conflict with himself. Equally, two people trying to decide what couch to buy is also a conflict. Conflicts are essential to give a scene and a play life.\n\n38. Because a one-act play is so short, most experts recommend you avoid extensive exposition. If the play is about Mary and John arguing in a restaurant, the audience does not need to know where they were born, how many siblings they have or any information extraneous to the play. It does not mean that the playwright cannot know these things, but you can waste valuable time giving explanations or background about things that do not affect the immediate outcome of the scene or situation.\n\n39. Avoid using a narrator. You may wish to read examples of one-act plays to understand how they are written and what can be done with them. If you like classical literature, Moliere and Anton Chekov both wrote extensive collections of one- acts. David Ives is considered by many theater critics to be the greatest modern mind when it comes to one-act comedies. For drama, you may wish to look at the work of Horton Foote or David Henry Hwang.\n\n40. Rules of Thumb One-Act plays should: 1) be set in a single location 2) be set over a period of no more than one day 3) have one central plot 4) have four or fewer characters 5) have conflict that is resolved by the end\n\n41. 6) develop characters primarily through dialogue 7) not rely on the use of a narrator (instead, dramatize everything) 8) be a complete, compact drama, with a beginning, middle and end 9) follow the standard format of a short story - opening situation - rising action, which develops the conflict - conflict - climax (the turning point) - falling action - resolution (the conflict is resolved)\n\n42. Story Development – Ten Tips 1. Create a world that's true to real life or fantastical or that mixes the mundane with the magical. But whatever set of rules you create for that world, make sure you follow them. 2. Write a conflict that builds as the play progresses. As you structure the conflict, think in terms of your play having a beginning, a middle and an end.\n\n43. 3. Write characters that want something (which puts them in conflict with other characters) and try to get what they want at every moment. 4. Make sure that each character has something at stake, a consequence if he doesn't get what he wants. 5. Create a \"ticking clock\" that puts the characters under pressure to get what they want right away.\n\n44. 6. Make sure there is a good reason, an \"event,\" for your play. It's not enough for two characters to sit around and talk for a while and then leave. There needs to be some important reason why we're watching them now, at this particular moment.\n\n45. 7. Write dialogue that illuminates your characters and advances the plot at the same time. 8. Make each character speak in a distinctive voice. If you have trouble with that, try imagining a specific actor you know - even if it's someone who will never play the part - in the role.\n\n46. 9. Do not have a character tell us something she can show us instead. For example, it's much more effective to hide under the bed than to say \"I'm afraid.\" 10. Give each character a \"moment,\" something that justifies the character's existence in your play and that makes him attractive for an actor to play."
