        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe concept of “derivative works” is a cornerstone of intellectual property law, especially when it comes to public domain content. With the Fables comic series now in the public domain, many creators, including those in the Print on Demand (POD) industry, may be interested in creating derivative works based on this series. But what exactly are derivative works, and how do they interact with copyright law? Let’s delve into the details.\n\nWhat Are Derivative Works?\n\nDerivative works are new, original products that include aspects of a pre-existing, copyrighted work. For example, a novel based on a short story, a painting based on a photograph, or a remix of a song are all considered derivative works.\n\nDerivative Works and Public Domain\n\nWhen a work is in the public domain, it means that it is free for use by anyone for any purpose. This freedom generally extends to the creation of derivative works. In the context of the Fables series, this means that creators can freely use the characters, settings, and other elements of the series to create new, original works.\n\nCopyrighting Derivative Works\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting: while the original work (in this case, the Fables series) is in the public domain and therefore not subject to copyright, the new derivative work can be copyrighted. This is because the derivative work is considered a new, original creation, even though it incorporates elements from a public domain work.\n\nExample: Unique Design Featuring Fables Characters\n\nLet’s say you’re a POD business owner and you create a unique T-shirt design featuring characters from the Fables series. While the characters themselves are in the public domain and free to use, your specific design is a new, original work. Therefore, you can copyright this design, giving you exclusive rights to produce and sell T-shirts with that particular design.\n\nLegal Implications\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease note that the information provided in this article is intended for informational and educational purposes only. I am not a legal professional, and this content should not be construed as legal advice. Laws and regulations related to intellectual property and public domain can be complex and subject to change. Therefore, it’s crucial to exercise due diligence and consult with qualified legal counsel for personalized advice before taking any actions based on the information provided here. Failure to do so could result in legal complications or liabilities. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nProtection Scope\n\nThe copyright on a derivative work only extends to the new elements you’ve added or changed. It does not extend to the elements from the public domain work. In our T-shirt example, this means you can’t prevent others from using the Fables characters; you can only prevent them from using your specific design.\n\nInfringement Risks\n\nIf someone else creates a design that is substantially similar to your copyrighted design, you may have grounds for a copyright infringement claim. However, the claim would only be valid for the elements that are original to your design, not for the use of Fables characters.\n\nCommercial Use\n\nSince the derivative work is copyrighted, you have the exclusive right to use, distribute, and sell it. This includes using it in a POD business.\n\nThe concept of derivative works offers a fascinating avenue for creativity, especially when it comes to public domain works like the Fables series. While the public domain status allows for a wide range of creative freedom, the ability to copyright derivative works provides a layer of protection for new, original creations. Understanding this balance is crucial for anyone looking to explore the rich tapestry of public domain works in their own creative endeavors."
