        "text": "1. Understanding Intertextuality as a Technique of Drama\n\n2. Intertextuality Defined Intertextuality is the interconnection between similar or related works of literature that reflect and influence a reader’s interpretation of the text. It is a literary device that creates an interrelationship between texts and generates related understanding in separate works. The term “Intertextuality” was developed in 1966 by the French semiotician Julia Kristeva. She created the term from the Latin word “intertexto” which means to intermingle while weaving.\n\n3. Plagiarism is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense, punishable due to prejudicial causes such as copyright infringement. In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word “plagiarus” (kidnapper) to denote stealing someone else’s work was pioneered by the Roman poet Martial, who complained that another poet had “kidnapped his verses”. Plagiary, a derivative of plagiarus, was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist Ben Jonson during the Jacobean Era to describe someone guilty of literary theft.\n\n4. INTERTEXTUAL FIGURES include: 1. Allusion is a figure of speech, in which an object or circumstance from unrelated context is referred to covertly or indirectly. If the allusion is explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied), it is usually termed a reference. 2. Is a reference to another text more like an inspiration.\n\n6. TYPES OF ALLUSION  1. Literary Allusion  2. Biblical Allusion  3. Historical Allusion  4. Cultural Allusion\n\n7. 2. Quotation is the repetition of one expression as part of another one, particularly when the quoted expression is well-known or explicitly attributed by citation to its original source, and it is indicated by quotation marks.\n\n9. 3. A calque or loan translation is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word or root-for-root translation. When used as a verb, to “calque” means to borrow a word or phrase from another language while translating its components, so as to create a new lexeme in the target language.\n\n11. 5. Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source language text by means of an equivalent target-language text.\n\n14. 6. A parody (also called spoof or lampoon) is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an original work – its subject, author, style, or some other target- by means of satiric or ironic imitation.\n\n16. 7. Unlike parody, pastiche celebrates rather than mocks, the work it imitates. The word pastiche is a French cognate of the Italian noun pasticcio, which is a pie filling mixed from diverse ingredients.\n\n20. 8. Appropriation is a reworking or re-imagination of a well-known text, to change or extend its meaning. For example, Marcel Duchamp’s artwork, L.H.O.O.Q. is an appropriation of Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. Duchamp took an image of the painting and drew a moustache on it. The adaptation or reuse of a certain work to other style of text makes an exiting text to a new different form or context.\n\n22. 9. Adaptation. A film, TV, drama or stage play is based on a written work. For example, J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter has a film adaptation.\n\n24. Steps in Identifying and Analyzing Intertextuality 1. Read the passage to identify any clear intertextual references to literature, music, art, film or another text type. 2. Research or use your own knowledge of the text you have identified and find any themes or messages that can be linked to your current text.\n\n25. Steps in Identifying and Analyzing Intertextuality 3. Determine the significance of using the reference. - How does it compliment the author’s intended message? - Does it deepen your current understanding and perspective of the text? 4. Discuss your insights.\n\n26. An archetype [ar-ki-tayp] is a character, event, situation or theme that resembles another. Thus, by definition, an archetype is essentially intertextual. For example, Superman is an archetype of Hercules. Both possess superhuman strength, and both have a weakness.\n\n29. Direction: Identify the character or story being referred to by the following archetypes in the table below. The first one is done for you. Write your answer in the column on the right. An item can have more than one answer."
