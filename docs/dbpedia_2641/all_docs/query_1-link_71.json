        "text": "Author: Bert Jansen\n\nFollowing on from the replicas of the readymades, Marcel Duchamp and gallerist Arturo Schwarz came up with the idea of making Duchamp’s key work Le Grand Verre (1915-23) accessible to a wider public, too, by repeating a series of etchings in a limited edition. In 1964 and 1965 Duchamp made etchings of seven separate passages from Le Grand Verre and an etching of the work as a whole. There is also one etching, The Large Glass Completed, in which the passages in red were added from the notes that were not included in 1923, when Duchamp signed the work as unfinished.[1] In addition to the nine etchings, 144 notes were included in facsimile, which referred to the planning and production of the work, together with an English translation. These notes were previously published in La boîte verte and La boîte blanche. The whole was published in 1967 as loose-leaf illustrations in Schwarz’s book titled The Large Glass and Related Works (Vol. I) in an edition of 150. The book and the etchings are contained in an acrylic glass slip-case with a colour reproduction of Le Grand Verre.\n\nThe individual etchings illustrate the narrative of Le Grand Verre. The story can clearly be deduced from the notes, although those containing a cryptic use of language and associative references do call for a degree of imagination on the reader’s part. In the middle of the domain of the bachelors there is a ‘chocolate grinder’ in which three millstones rotate behind one another. Beside it a water wheel drives a ‘glider’, which like the monotonous lives of the bachelors, according to Duchamp, goes back and forth to the rhythm of the litany: beer drinking, lazy living, masturbating etc. The bachelors consist of hollow shapes that look like mannequins, a ‘cemetery of uniforms and liveries’ as Duchamp also called them.\n\nThe bride appears to be built from engine parts and internal organs derived from the Cubist paintings he made in Munich in 1912. She gives orders to the bachelors from the Milky Way by way of ‘draft pistons’. Thereupon the bachelors start to exude ‘the illuminating gas’ which crystallises in ‘capillary tubes’ and ‘sieves’ into ‘spangles of frosty gas’. After acceleration in a ‘toboggan’, they splash upwards and by way of ‘Oculist Witnesses and ‘the Handler of Gravity’ cross the horizon into the bride’s domain, ‘the Milky Way’, where they hit their objective as ‘shots’.[2]"
