        "text": "In Copyright law, a “derivative work” is a new piece of artwork that is based on artwork created and copyrighted by someone else. So if you take a design that I have created, change some details, publish your version on the internet under your own name without my permission or license - this is WRONG. This is a form of plagiarism and copyright infringement.\n\n***UPDATE 8/2/2016***\n\nThe infringing images below have all been removed from their source. I have heard from the designer who has now deleted all the images that were submitted to stock image/photo sites. I am leaving this blog post up for educational purposes; and so that buyers and sellers can stay informed about stolen designs and counterfeit products.\n\n———————————————————————————\n\nEXAMPLE 1: This designer traced my Boston Terriers designs and made changes to ears, eyes, and color markings and uploaded them to Shutterstock.\n\nWhat happens next is that these “stock images” (illegal copies of my art) are then licensed to other sellers (eg, on Etsy) who resell them to the public in the form of posters, t-shirts, and other merchandise. These sellers may think they are getting legit images direct from the source (the artist) but they are not.\n\nEXAMPLE 2: Phone case company below licensed the same images from EXAMPLE 1 /Shutterstock. The phone case seller has since removed the product from their site. I don’t know how much money the “lazy designer”, Shutterstock, and the phone case seller made from this artwork. It took 3-4 weeks to deal with this problem and I didn’t make a cent.\n\n100% LEGITIMATE Boston Terriers phone case can be purchased at www.casetify.com/lilichin\n\nEXAMPLE 3: Bootleg dog breed t-shirts. Sometimes these designs appear on Sunfrog T-shirts, and other print-on-demand online stores that feature dog breed designs. I have been in frequent communication with Sunfrog Tshirts Legal Dept - their staff are on the lookout for copies of my artwork and they are quick to take them down off the site. It is a neverending game of whack-a-mole.\n\n100% LEGITIMATE dog breed t-shirts by me can be purchased from www.doggietops.com\n\nEXAMPLE 4: This Corgi phone case sold by PacSun. Their copy consists of Corgi images traced from my originals. They changed some color details. They were also charging a lower price than the legitimate Corgi phone case that I am selling. My attorney contacted PacSun and they agreed to removed this bootleg product from their website. If you see this phone case in PacSun stores, please let me know.\n\n100% LEGITIMATE Corgis phone case can be purchased at www.casetify.com/lilichin\n\nEXAMPLE 5: Sometimes the stolen artwork is almost identical to the original. How many times have these Westie and Newfoundland dog designs been sold on someone else’s product? How much money has been made?\n\nEXAMPLE 6: A clothing company in Brazil paid for these stolen images in EXAMPLE 5, added extra design elements and text, and were selling t-shirts and pouches, without knowing that they were licensing stolen derivative works. I am in communication with this company right now to investigate the source of these images. *REMOVED*\n\nEXAMPLE 7: These dog breed posters were found on Etsy. I submitted a DMCA takedown notice to Etsy Legal and had them removed. The seller said she had never seen my work before. My attorney believes the seller had licensed the images from a stock image company, not aware that they were copies.\n\n100% legitimate prints (single dog breeds too) can be purchased from my ETSY SHOP.\n\nEXAMPLE 8: THIS IS THE LAZY ASS INFRINGER right here.\n\nThese are the same images licensed to the Etsy seller in EXAMPLE 7. This “designer” has created 162 dog breed icons which are all copies of my dog breeds (192 dogs).\n\nThis thief took my concept “Dogs of the World”, which I spent months researching and designing. They copied the heads, even used the same markings, attached them to different bodies. There are some designs of obscure dog breeds here that they would not have been able to acquire from anywhere else because I was the first artist to draw them. In. This. Style.\n\nEXAMPLE 9: Same images from EXAMPLES 7 and 8 - same thief posting under a different name on Dreamstime.com (Romania). My originals on the left; derivative works on the right.\n\nThese same dog breed copies were also found on Shutterstock and iStockPhoto by Getty Images (see the list below) and I am waiting to hear back from their legal departments. I don’t get paid a cent while these images are being licensed out to the public.\n\nFor the artist/copyright owner (me), it is a major time-consuming pain in the ass every time I learn about my work being stolen. I only find out about copyright infringement because people who know my work email me with links. I sometimes wish I didn’t know this was happening. And once I know, it’s hard for me to do nothing about it.\n\nIt takes a lot of time to track down the persons responsible for these derivative works, and to contact defensive sellers to prove that the artwork is mine, and to have infringing items removed. I certainly don’t have the time to go searching for copies, or even to email back and forth with these companies, or with my attorney, submitting DMCA takedown notices, etc.\n\nSTOCK IMAGE SITES don’t take any responsibility for stolen images except to make money from them, and to remove them when copyright infringement is proven.\n\nIt appears that stock image sites consider themselves a “service provider”; they do not take responsibility for infringement by the people who submit art to their catalogs, they do not give out contact details of their members (due to privacy laws); and they do not inform their licensees when images are deleted for copyright infringement. Licensees of stolen images continue to sell product. The original artist does not get paid; and sometimes does not even know that this is happening.\n\nSOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE HERE.\n\nBUYERS: If you see my dog breed designs on products, these are legitimate if I am promoting these products myself. My name and website would be associated with these products. You can always email me to check.\n\nSELLERS or DESIGNERS: If you have licensed rights to dog breed clip art, and if what you paid for looks like any of the examples of derivative works I posted here, please help by doing the right thing. Please let me know, and please contact the website where you licensed the images from and report fraudulent content. You can link them to this blog post. Please stop using these images.\n\nSo far, I have seen infringing copies of my designs on these licensing sites, uploaded by someone claiming to be the copyright owner:\n\nFreepik *REMOVED*\n\nistockphoto *REMOVED*\n\nistock by Getty Images *REMOVED*\n\nShutterstock *REMOVED*\n\nDreamstime *REMOVED*\n\nAdobe Fotolia *REMOVED*\n\nGraphic River/ Envato Market *REMOVED*\n\nIf you see these images anywhere else, please let me know.\n\nUpdate 8/13/2016\n\nI have contacted Teechip about this mug. My original Husky design is HERE: http://www.doggietops.com/collections/siberian-husky/products/husky-unisex-t-shirt\n\nThank you for your support!\n\n- Lili"
