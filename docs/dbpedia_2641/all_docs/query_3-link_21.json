        "text": "Permission.\n\nLegally only the copyright owner has the right to authorise adaptations and reproductions of their work - this includes the making of a derivative work.\n\nThe copyright owner is generally the creator of the original work, or it may be someone the creator has given copyright to (i.e. next of kin).\n\nUnless you are the copyright owner of the original work, you will probably need the permission of the copyright owner before making a derivative work.\n\nCan I claim that my copy is fair use/fair dealing, or de minimis?\n\nUnless your activities are explicitly allowed under law, there is no solid legal footing for such a claim.\n\nFair use is a complex area and by its very nature tends to be quite subjective. When a case goes to court a judge will typically make a decision based on a number of factors including the purpose of the use, the nature of the work, the significance of the copied content and the potential impact to the owner's income and reputation. It's important to understand that while the judge may have guidelines and past cases to refer to, there are no simple rules and the outcome can be hard to predict. There have also been cases where a judge has ruled that a use was allowed only to have the decision reversed after appeal; a notable example of the was Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films.\n\nCopyright notices\n\nCopyright notices are generally helpful by stating to others the copyright status of the work and attributing ownership. In the case of derivative works it is often suitable (and can also be helpful) for the derivative work to show a copyright notice for the original material as well as for the new work.\n\nFor example:\n\nCopyright © 2019 John Smith, (adapted from 'original work'; copyright © 2012 Joe Bloggs)."
