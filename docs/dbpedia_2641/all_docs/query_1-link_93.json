        "text": "The case of Elsa Plotz\n\n« Une réplique, appropriée par Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968), d’un original présenté à la Société des artistes indépendants de New York en avril 1917. » Could this be Fountain’s new museum label?\n\n« Raconte ce détail à la famille : les indépendants sont ouverts ici avec gros succès. Une de mes amies sous un pseudonyme masculin, Richard Mutt, avait envoyé une pissotière en porcelaine comme sculpture. Ce n’était pas du tout indécent, aucune raison pour la refuser. Le comité a décidé de refuser d’exposer cette chose. J’ai donné ma démission et c’est un potin qui aura sa valeur dans New York. J’avais envie de faire une exposition spéciale des refusés aux Indépendants. Mais ce serait un pléonasme ! Et la pissotière aurait été « lonely ». à bientôt affect. Marcel » — Duchamp’s letter to her sister Suzanne Duchamp (April 11, 1917).\n\nHow come that “the most influential piece of modern art”, a public men’s urinal signed R. Mutt, apparently sent by some Richard Mutt to the great inaugural show of modern art in America, opened in New York City on the evening of April 10 of 1917, has been rejected and disappeared before any chance of being exposed to any public audience?\n\nFountain’s authorship is a mystery, probably a calculated one by Marcel Duchamp himself. No one knows for sure. Writers and scholars claim, since 2002, that the famous virtual artwork was a ‘readymade’ by Elsa Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven, attributed to Duchamp by André Breton in 1935. Duchamp finally assumed the Fountain’s authorship in 1950, thirty-three years after its submission to the “First Annual Exhibition of The Society of Independent Artists in 1917.\n\nThe so-called Fountain is a non-existent artwork — a virtual entity and a purely conceptual object that has defined contemporary art for almost a century.\n\nDuchamp’s commercial replicas of a similar urinal under the title “Fountain” are indeed copies, iterations, of the original ‘object’ sent to the New York exhibition by someone under the pseudonymous R. Mutt. Above all, the Fountain is the title of a printed picture from a photographic composite image by Alfred Stieglitz specially made for the avantgarde magazine issue n.2 of The Blind Eye (May 1917). So what we have from the year of the exhibition is an image printed on a magazine of an art object (a ‘readymade’) and a title: Fountain. This title and the corresponding picture of the lost thing is the ‘ekphrasis’ of one of the most robust paradigms of twenty-century art. Who made this object? Who found (or ordered) this ‘readymade’? As dictated by André Breton in 1935, eighteen years after the obscure event of its presentation and disappearance, was Marcel Duchamp. But no, or at least not him alone. Alfred Stieglitz did a composite picture of the rejected men’s urinal for The Blind Man — a Dada publication conceived by Duchamp, Henry-Pierre Roché and Beatrice Wood, who became its publisher. Last but not least, R. Mutt’s signature on the top-right border of the urinal suggests that it was Elsa Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven who signed the artwork and, most probably, the one who ordered and sent the ‘sculpture’ to the great exhibition of the Independents (1). Eight years after her death (1927), Fountain became the most famous readymade.\n\nIf this is true, multiple shadows would permanently taint Duchamp’s originality.\n\nA compilation of the most relevant writings proving and disproving Duchamp’s authorship of the Fountain follows, plus a link to Elsa Plotz’s poetry anthology.\n\nThis post derives from a recent discussion with my friend and artist Natalia de Mello, whom I vividly thank.\n\n1—The Rs in Elsa’s handwriting don’t fit R. Mutt’s signature.\n\nA C-P\n\nBrussels, Mon 5, Jun 2023.\n\nElsa Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven (born Else Hildegard Plötz; (12 July 1874 – 14 December 1927) was a German-born avant-garde visual artist and poet, who was active in Greenwich Village, New York, from 1913 to 1923, where her radical self-displays came to embody a living Dada. She was considered one of the most controversial and radical women artists of the era — Wikipedia.\n\nSeeing in the dark\n\nBelow is a compilation of relevant texts published on the controversial relationship between Elsa Plotz and Marcel Duchamp.\n\n(2002)\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“Limbswishing Dada in New York Baroness Elsa’s Gender Performance”\n\nIrene Gammel\n\nWith me posing [is] art—aggressive—virile—extraordinary—invigorating—antestereotyped—no wonder blockheads by nature degeneration dislike it—feel peeved—it underscores unreceptiveness like jazz does.\n\nThe Baroness to Peggy Guggenheim, 1927\n\nFelix Paul Greve […] hat intellektuellen Ehrgeiz—Aber er will ‘Originalitat’—von der ist er strikter Antipod. Ich bin das—was er nicht ist. So musste er mich hassen—lassen.\n\nThe Baroness, “Seelisch-chemischebetrachtung”1\n\nCelebrating her posing as virile and aggressive art in the first epigraph, the Data artist Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, nee Plotz (1874-1927) summed up her remarkable life and work just months before her mysterious death in Paris. Known as the Baroness amongst the international avant-garde in New York and Paris of the teens and twenties, the German-born performance artist, model, sculptor, and poet was a party to the general rejection of sexual Victorianism, launched with the 1913 International Exhibition of Modern Art, the so-called Armory Show, in Manhattan. Before coming to New York, the Baroness had undergone a picaresque apprenticeship amongst the Kunstgeiuerbler avant-garde in Munich and Berlin from around 1896 to 1911, before following her long-time spouse Felix Paul Greve (aka F.P. Grove) on a quixotic immigration adventure to Kentucky. After Grove’s desertion, she made her way to New York and promptly married the impe-cunious (but sexually satisfying) Baron Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven. Soon a tided war widow (the Baron was incarcerated by the French in 1914 and committed suicide in 1919), the Baroness claimed her new spiritual home amidst an energetic and international group of vanguard artists– many of them exiles from Europe. From 1913 on, she threw herself with abandon into New York’s experimental ferment, quickly becoming the movement’s most radical and controversial exponent.2\n\n(…)\n\nCanadian Review of Comparative Literature/Revue Canadienne de Littérature Comparée CRCL JANUARY-MARCH 2002 MARS-JUIN\n\n0319-051X/2002/29.1/1 © Canadian Comparative Literature Association\n\nhttps://journals.library.ualberta.ca/crcl/index.php/crcl/issue/view/671\n\n¶¶¶\n\nThe Mama of Dada\n\nBy Holland Cotter\n\nNYT, May 19, 2002\n\nThe Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (1874-1927) — known to her amused, admiring, often quailing friends simply as the Baroness — was a public event, a proto-Happening. She painted her shaved head red. She wore a tomato-can bra, a bustle with a taillight and a bird cage around her neck with live canaries inside. The streets of New York were her theater. Dada was the name of her act.\n\nMany people who watched her clanking imperiously through Greenwich Village in the years just after World War I probably took her for only another New York nut job; until recently, history has done that too. But she was also an artist, a poet, a voluble fixture of the cultural avant-garde and a guerrilla fighter in sexual politics. This is how she comes across in Irene Gammel’s ‘‘Baroness Elsa,’’ the first full account of the Baroness’s life. It attempts, on the whole persuasively, to position her as a catalytic figure in the American art of her day and in the evolution of certain more contemporary forms — junk art, performance art, body art.\n\n…\n\nElsa came into her own as part of the New York Dada scene. Her sexual fieldwork continued, with many successes and a few notable disappointments. She developed a crush on Marcel Duchamp, who responded with passive evasion. (‘‘Marcel, Marcel, I love you like hell, Marcel’’ was her cri de coeur.)\n\n(…)\n\nShe started to make art: painted portraits, witty, delicate sculptures of found materials and assemblage-style costumes. Her beyond-the-fringe daring was a power of example for her male colleagues — the wannabe Dadaist Ezra Pound spoke approvingly of her ‘‘principle of nonacquiescence’’ — and may have produced collaborative results. Ms. Gammel presents strong evidence that the Baroness supplied Duchamp with the urinal from which his groundbreaking ‘‘Fountain’’ was made, and provided the prototype for his cross-dressed Rrose Selavy.\n\n¶¶¶\n\nBaroness Elsa\n\nGender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity-A Cultural Biography\n\nIrene Gammel\n\nMIT Press, 2002\n\nThe first biography of the enigmatic dadaist known as the Baroness–Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.\n\nElsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (1874-1927) is considered by many to be the first American dadaist as well as the mother of dada. An innovator in poetic form and an early creator of junk sculpture, the Baroness was best known for her sexually charged, often controversial performances. Some thought her merely crazed, others thought her a genius. The editor Margaret Anderson called her perhaps the only figure of our generation who deserves the epithet extraordinary. Yet despite her great notoriety and influence, until recently her story and work have been little known outside the circle of modernist scholars.\n\nIn Baroness Elsa , Irene Gammel traces the extraordinary life and work of this daring woman, viewing her in the context of female dada and the historical battles fought by women in the early twentieth century. Striding through the streets of Berlin, Munich, New York, and Paris wearing such adornments as a tomato-soup can bra, teaspoon earrings, and black lipstick, the Baroness erased the boundaries between life and art, between the everyday and the outrageous, between the creative and the dangerous. Her art objects were precursors to dada objects of the teens and twenties, her sound and visual poetry were far more daring than those of the male modernists of her time, and her performances prefigured feminist body art and performance art by nearly half a century.\n\nhttps://www.standaardboekhandel.be/p/baroness-elsa-9780262572156?utm_source=pocket_saves\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“My Heart Belongs To Dada”\n\nBy René Steinke\n\nAug. 18, 2002\n\nThe New York Times Magazine\n\n(…)\n\nShe had a tall, lithe frame, ‘‘very Gothic,’’ and ‘‘a wonderful gait,’’ according to the photographer Berenice Abbott. Her fierce, strange beauty and her predilection for taking off her clothes made her a favorite model for artists like Robert Henri, William Glackens and Man Ray. But even before coming to New York, as she spent her youth chasing an ambition to become a ‘‘real free true lady artist,’’ the Baroness played the part of model and muse. As a young runaway in Berlin, she posed as a living statue at the Wintergarten Theater, in a kind of live pornography show disguised as edifying classical art.\n\n(…)\n\nIf Duchamp was right about the Baroness being the future, her time may now have arrived. The Francis M. Naumann Fine Art gallery recently devoted an exhibition to her, and a new biography (‘‘Baroness Elsa,’’ by Irene Gammel) finally establishes her rightful place as the first American performance artist. Now that it is practically impossible not to wear mass-produced clothing, encouraging women to hire stylists to make themselves look different, there is enormous appeal in the Baroness’s surreal ensembles.\n\n(…)\n\nThe opposite of the passive model, the Baroness was Duchamp’s ‘‘Nude Descending a Staircase’’ come to life and strolling out the door. In 1921, she starred in a film made by Duchamp and Man Ray, titled ‘‘Elsa, Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven, Shaving Her Pubic Hair.’’ In the two frames that remain (Man Ray accidentally destroyed the film during development), she appears to be dancing, spectacularly naked, after the barber has done his work.\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“Baroness Elsa and the Aesthetics of Empathy A Mystery and a Speculation”\n\nRichard Cavell\n\nOn April 1st, 1921, the Socieété Anonyme of New York, which was the first American society devoted to the presentation of modern art, held a session on Dada which was immortalized in a drawing by Richard Boix (figure 5). In this draining we find a number of key figures within New York Dada, including Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp, all of whom are clearly identified by name. In the centre of the image, however, there is a figure resting on a pillar identified only as “La Femme,” and it is around this figure that a mystery has grown up (figure 6). The New York Dada scholar Francis Naumann has suggested an identification with a sculpture by Archipenko (figure 7), while admitting that “no specific sculpture by Archipenko—nor, for that matter, any other artist from this period—exhibits the unusual details that can be found in this illustrator’s flight of fancy” (“New York Dada” 14). Identifying the figure with Eve through the icon of the apple, Naumann notes contrariwise that from the “string attached to the woman’s elbow (or is it a beaklike extension of her nose?) a cup dangles freely in space, a detail that makes the sculpture look less like the depiction of a woman and more like an organ-grinder’s monkey ‘gone Dada’” (14). In the mystery of this figure Naumann sees the very reason why “people keep asking ‘what is Dada?’”\n\nIn the decade from 1986, when Rudolf Kuenzli published New York Dada, to 1996, when Francis Naumann issued “Making Mischief: Dada Invades New York”, the figure of Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven has moved from the peripheries of New York Dada to occupy a central position, as the reproduction of her 1920 Portrait of Marcel Duchamp on the cover of Naumann’s book tellingly indicates (figure i). The reasons for this shift are many: one has to do with the increasing recognition of the historical importance of women in Dada (as in the anthology of articles recently edited by Naomi Sawelson-Gorse). Closely connected to this avenue of approach is that of feminist theory, which, by critiquing the notion of Dada as an exclusively masculinist activity, has opened up a space for important figures such as Elsa to emerge from obscurity. Another avenue along which Elsa studies have developed is that of sexuality: Elsa’s memoirs, published by Paul Hjartarson and Douglas Spettigue under the title Baroness Elsa, remain among the most breathtakingly frank documents of this period, and we are now beginning to understand that sexuality was absolutely central to Elsa’s art, be it her poetry, her prose or the artefacts she created. Finally, the growing interest in and research on Elsa’s German partner, Felix Paul Greve, has been accompanied by the realisation that their work constitutes much more of an intellectual 1\n\n(…)\n\nCanadian Review of Comparative Literature/Revue Canadienne de Littérature Comparée CRCL JANUARY-MARCH 2002 MARS-JUIN\n\n0319-051X/2002/29.1/1 © Canadian Comparative Literature Association\n\nhttps://journals.library.ualberta.ca/crcl/index.php/crcl/issue/view/671\n\n(2004)\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“Work of art that inspired a movement … a urinal”\n\nCharlotte Higgins, arts correspondent\n\nThe Guardian, Thu 2 Dec 2004 12.12 GMT\n\nA humble porcelain urinal – reclining on its side, and marked with a false signature – has been named the world’s most influential piece of modern art, knocking Picasso and Matisse from their traditional positions of supremacy.\n\nMarcel Duchamp’s Fountain, created in 1917, has been interpreted in innumerable different ways, including as a reference to the female sexual parts.\n\nHowever, what is clear is the direct link between Duchamp’s “readymade”, as the artist called it, and the conceptual art that dominates today – Tracey Emin’s Bed being a prime example.\n\nAccording to art expert Simon Wilson, “the Duchampian notion that art can be made of anything has finally taken off. And not only about formal qualities, but about the ‘edginess’ of using a urinal and thus challenging bourgeois art.”\n\nThe Duchamp came out top in a survey of 500 artists, curators, critics and dealers commissioned by the sponsor of the Turner prize, Gordon’s. Different categories of respondents chose markedly different works, with artists in particular plumping overwhelmingly for Fountain.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/dec/02/arts.artsnews1\n\n[2008]\n\n¶¶¶\n\nIn Transition: Selected Poems [1923-1927]\n\nby the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven\n\nhttps://digital.lib.umd.edu/transition/index.html\n\n[2011]\n\n¶¶¶\n\nBody Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa Von Freytag-Loringhoven\n\nby Elsa Von Freytag-Loringhoven\n\nMit Press (2011)\n\nThe first major collection of poetry written in English by the flabbergasting and flamboyant Baroness Elsa, “the first American Dada.”As a neurasthenic, kleptomaniac, man-chasing proto-punk poet and artist, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven left in her wake a ripple that is becoming a rip–one hundred years after she exploded onto the New York art scene. As an agent provocateur within New York’s modernist revolution, “the first American Dada” not only dressed and behaved with purposeful outrageousness, but she set an example that went well beyond the eccentric divas of the twenty-first century, including her conceptual descendant, Lady Gaga.Her delirious verse flabbergasted New Yorkers as much as her flamboyant persona. As a poet, she was profane and playfully obscene, imagining a farting God, and transforming her contemporary Marcel Duchamp into M’ars (my arse). With its ragged edges and atonal rhythms, her poetry echoes the noise of the metropolis itself. Her love poetry muses graphically on ejaculation, orgasm, and oral sex. When she tired of existing words, she created new ones: “phalluspistol,” “spinsterlollipop,” “kissambushed.” The Baroness’s rebellious, highly sexed howls prefigured the Beats; her intensity and psychological complexity anticipates the poetic utterances of Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath.Published more than a century after her arrival in New York, Body Sweats is the first major collection of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven’s poems in English. The Baroness’s biographer Irene Gammel and coeditor Suzanne Zelazo have assembled 150 poems, most of them never before published. Many of the poems are themselves art objects, decorated in red and green ink, adorned with sketches and diagrams, presented with the same visceral immediacy they had when they were composed.\n\n(2013)\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“The Hits of Lady Dada : Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven”\n\nBy Ben Robinson\n\nYuck ‘n Yum Winter 2013\n\nWhether in art, politics, love or warfare, history is said to be written by the victors. The importance of Marcel Duchamp’s 1917 Fountain is surely beyond any doubt, having changed the entire art historical narrative irrevocably. In 2004, to no-one’s great surprise, it was voted the most influential artwork of the 20th century by 500 selected art world professionals. This article is not about to argue any different. But what if Fountain, that most influential artwork, was maybe the idea of someone else entirely, someone whose place in art history was largely forgotten and has only recently come to light?\n\nIn a 1917 letter from Duchamp to his sister Suzanne, he informed her that his submission to the Society of Independent Artists was in fact conceived by a friend:\n\n“One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture; since there was nothing indecent about it, there was no reason to reject it.”\n\nSo could this mysterious friend have been Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, and who was she anyway?\n\nThe Baroness was born in 1874 in Pomerania, Germany, and spent much of her early life as an actress and vaudeville performer. She had numerous affairs with artists in Berlin, Munich and Italy, studied art in Dachau, and married an architect in Berlin in 1901. This marriage became a ménage à trois with the poet and translator Felix Paul Greve, and in 1910 she emigrated to America with him. On moving to New York in 1913 she married the German Baron Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven, got a job in a cigarette factory, and fell in with the city’s nascent Dada scene. Baron von Loringhoven hurried back to Germany at the outbreak of war, where he shot himself – an act which his wife characterised as the “bravest of his life”.\n\nFreytag-Loringhoven cut an eccentric figure on the New York streets with her shaved head, black lipstick and riotous outfits of found-object ensembles, among them a tomato-can bra, a birdcage hat with live canary, and postage stamps pasted to her cheeks. She modeled for artists including Man Ray, and appeared in a short film by Ray and Duchamp titled The Baroness Shaves Her Pubic Hair. She wrote poetry that was published in the Little Review and inspired Ezra Pound, who wrote in his Cantos that the Baroness lived by a “principle of non-acquiescence.” While pursuing a thorough dismantling of the boundaries between art and everyday life, she created artworks whose existence has survived through many years of obscurity. The irreligious Dada object God is a 10½ inches high cast iron plumbing trap turned upside down and mounted on a wooden mitre box, a 1917 readymade that’s contemporaneous with Fountain and is now exhibited alongside it in the Arensberg Collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nAfter her flowering with New York Dada, Freytag-Loringhoven was cut adrift when many of her fellow artists and poets returned home to Europe after the war. By the time she’d inherited enough money to travel to Paris in 1926, she was in declining health and dismayed by the many rejections of her English-language poetry in her resolutely Francophone new home. A disastrous stay in post-war Berlin came to nothing, though a return to Paris the following year seemed to promise some improved mental stability. However. she was to die alone of gas suffocation in her flat, either by suicide or fatal accident. She is buried at Paris’s Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nThe Baroness’s place in history might have been condemned to a mere footnote but for a sudden resurgence of interest in this unique Dada trailblazer. In 2003, Irene Gammel’s Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity told her extraordinary story in the context of feminist body art and performance art, while Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven was listed by The New York Times as one of the notable art books of 2011. Even her unique and inflammatory fashions have appeared on the catwalks: for spring 2009, Maison Martin Margiela paraded models wearing a collection made entirely of refuse, and in winter 2009 Agatha Ruiz de la Prada took Elsa’s signature birdcage as the design cue for a skirt. The Baroness’s life and work had always defied specific categories, and she foresees junk art, performance art, body art, collage, found sculptures and assemblage by decades. It’s been a long time coming, but Baroness Elsa can finally claim a kind of victory.\n\nhttps://www.yucknyum.org/zine/winter-2013/5/\n\n¶¶¶\n\nElsa von Freytag-Loringhoven\n\n1874 — Świnoujście, Pologne | 1927 — Paris, France\n\nSculptrice et poétesse états-unienne.\n\nÀ 18 ans, Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven quitte sa famille pour s’installer à Berlin. Après deux mariages ratés, avec l’architecte August Endell en 1901, et avec l’écrivain Felix Paul Greve en 1907, elle s’installe à New York, où elle rencontre le baron Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven, avec qui elle se marie en 1913. Dans les années 1920, elle devient alors célèbre à Greenwich Village pour ses accoutrements extravagants faits de vêtements artistiques farfelus (corbeille à papier ou seau à charbon en guise de chapeau) et ses comportements excentriques. Pour survivre, elle pose comme modèle pour différents artistes : Theresa Bernstein, George Biddle. Elle commence à faire ses premiers collages et assemblages, le plus souvent à partir d’objets trouvés (comme dans son portrait de Marcel Duchamp, photographié par Charles Sheeler). Elle aime fréquenter les salons avec le crâne rasé, en particulier chez les Arensberg, centre de l’avant-garde artistique et intellectuelle américaine. Nouvelle égérie du mouvement dada de New York, elle est surnommée Dada Baroness. Elle joue dans un film coréalisé par Marcel Duchamp et Man Ray intitulé La Baronne rase ses poils pubiens.\n\nEn 1915, elle réalise, avec Morton Schamberg, la sculpture God, formée par un tuyau de plomb sur un morceau de bois, que beaucoup considèrent comme l’expression parfaite du dadaïsme de New York. Dès 1917, elle publie de nombreux poèmes dans les revues littéraires avant-gardistes, Broom, The Liberator et The Little Review qui la consacre « première dada américaine ». Incapable de survivre à New York sans revenus fixes, elle retourne en Allemagne en 1923. En proie à des pulsions suicidaires, elle fait plusieurs séjours dans des hôpitaux psychiatriques. Elle meurt intoxiquée par le gaz dans son appartement parisien. Son autobiographie Baroness Elsa est parue en 1992, réalisée à partir de son manuscrit autobiographique et d’extraits de lettres.\n\nBéatrix Pernelle\n\nExtrait du Dictionnaire universel des créatrices\n\n© 2013 Des femmes – Antoinette Fouque\n\nElsa von Freytag-Loringhoven\n\n(2014)\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“How Duchamp stole the Urinal”\n\nNovember 4, 2014 | By SRB\n\nScottish Review of Books\n\nCalvin Tomkins met Marcel Duchamp in 1959 when he wrote an article about him for Newsweek. They were friends until the artist’s death in 1968. The Museum of Modern Art has just published a new and revised edition of Tomkins’ now standard 1996 biography of Duchamp. Ann Temkin, Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA, praises Tomkins in her introduction for unfailingly bringing ‘a splendid lightness of touch to the weight of his careful and thorough research.’\n\nLightness is crucial to Tomkins’ assessment of Duchamp. He criticises those who take Duchamp too seriously. ‘Approach his work with a light heart’, Tomkins recommends, ‘and the rewards are everywhere in sight.’ This affable attitude, which demonstrated a warm friendship, has led Tomkins to brush aside all the recent research that undermines Duchamp’s own account of his life, which Tomkins used as the basis of his biography.\n\nThe startling fact has now emerged that Duchamp stole his most famous work, the urinal, from a female artist, robbed it of its original meaning, and turned it into something it was never intended to be: a piss take against the whole of art. This revelation undermines the whole argument of Tomkins’ book, discredits his ‘careful and thorough research’ and changes the history of art.\n\nWhen the mood took him, Duchamp could be honest about his dishonesty. In an interview for Vogue in 1962, he told William Seitz ‘I insist every word I am telling you now is stupid and wrong.’ Research has now revealed that Duchamp’s account of his life is a hall of smoke and mirrors. But, extraordinarily, there is a ‘smoking gun’ in all this subterfuge, and Duchamp is holding the incriminating weapon himself.\n\nOn April 11, 1917, just two days after the directors of the Society of Independent Artists had rejected a urinal as a submission for their exhibition, Duchamp wrote to his sister telling her that ‘One of my female friends under a masculine pseudonym, Richard Mutt, sent in a porcelain urinal as a sculpture’. This letter did not enter the public domain until 1983. It contradicts Duchamp’s own later account of this seminal incident.\n\nIn The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp (1979) Arturo Schwarz reports that Duchamp claimed that he and his friends Walter Arensberg and Joseph Stella went shopping on Fifth Avenue, ‘after a spirited conversation at lunch’, and bought a urinal from the J. L. Mott Iron Works. Duchamp then took it back to his studio, signed it R. MUTT, and submitted it to the Independents exhibition, calling it Fountain.\n\nThe board of the Society of Independents, of which Duchamp and Arensberg were members, had decided that they would hang every work of art submitted. Duchamp wasn’t present when the urinal, a late entry, was considered. Arensberg argued that it was art because an artist had chosen it. Mere choice, he claimed, could be transposed to an object and turn it into a work of art. The board, however, voted to reject the item on the grounds that it wasn’t art. Arensberg, and then Duchamp, resigned in protest.\n\nThe submission and rejection of Duchamp’s urinal is now regarded as one of the key, early turning points in the history of modern art, on a par with the revolutions of Fauvism and Cubism, De Stijl and Der Blaue Reiter. Fountain is always cited as the source of Conceptualism, the modern art movement that America, rather than Europe, gave the world. In Conceptual Art the idea behind the work is more important than its visual appearance or any aesthetic considerations.\n\nMany leading Duchamp scholars, in particularly William Camfield, Rhonda Roland Shearer and Glyn Thompson, in research published between 1996 and 2008, have discovered that this account of the urinal’s submission is simply not true. Duchamp and his friends couldn’t have bought the urinal from the J. L. Mott Ironworks because they didn’t sell that particular model. And the urinal was submitted untitled. Thompson argues convincingly that it was Alfred Stieglitz who named it Fountain when he photographed the rejected entry later.\n\nThe public outrage has also been hugely exaggerated. Since the urinal was never exhibited, no one saw it. Arensberg tried to generate publicity through his modest magazine, Blind Man 2, but there was little interest. Guillaume Apollinaire referred to the incident in the Mercure de France fifteen months later but he dismissed it as a pale American imitation of the famous blague known as the Boronali Affair of 1910 in which some abstract paintings which fooled the critics were later shown to have been made by a donkey’s tail. Japes against modern art were common by this time. They’d begun much earlier in Paris, when in 1883 Alphonse Allais exhibited a sheet of white paper in a frame and called it Anaemic Young Girls at their First Communion in the Snow.\n\nTomkins ignores all these discoveries in his new edition. He argues that Duchamp wanted (for reasons he doesn’t explain) to keep his involvement in the ‘affair’ of the urinal secret. This was why he pretended in his letter to his sister that a ‘female friend’ had submitted the object. But this explanation makes no sense because his sister, a Red Cross nurse in Paris, had no contacts with the New York media and, anyway, Duchamp’s letter would have taken weeks to arrive in war-torn Europe, long after public interest in the incident had fizzled out. The most obvious explanation is that Duchamp in his letter was telling the truth. But if he was, who then was this ‘female friend’?\n\nThe great new addition to the story of Duchamp, besides all the excellent, forensic work by Duchamp scholars, is the research of Irene Gammel. Her enthralling, moving and beautifully paced biography, Baroness Elsa, published in 2002, not only throws a spotlight, for the first time, on a highly influential creative figure in the maelstrom of art at the turn of the century, but radically changes our perception of Duchamp.\n\nBaroness Elsa was born plain Else Plotz in Swinemunde, Germany, in 1874. Her father was a builder and local councilor who philandered freely, beat her mother and, Elsa believed, inflicted her with syphilis. In her poem, Coachrider (c 1924), Elsa wrote:\n\nLook at Papa – Killer!\n\nHe beams – lovably – virile – despotic by blood – I adore – abhor him –\n\nElsa’s mother, Ida, forbidden to play her beloved piano by her husband, retreated into religion and romantic fiction. She insisted that her two daughters pray before they went to sleep. ‘Like going for a pee before bed,’ their atheist father laughed back. Ida attempted suicide and later died in an institution in 1893. As Elsa put it, she ‘left me her heritage … to fight.’\n\nElsa’s genius was to find new ways to break out of the social straightjacket that bound women in the 19th Century. She turned her life into a theatrical performance in which she could fight her mother’s battles openly, in public, in the street, whenever and wherever she wanted to, not when any man told her she could. Djuna Barnes, a friend late in Elsa’s life, wrote ‘People were afraid of her because she was undismayed about the facts of life – any of them – all of them.’\n\nGammel unravels the complex threads of Elsa’s marriages, first to the Jugendstil architect August Endell, and then to Felix Paul Greve (later Frederick Philip Grove), the translator of Oscar Wilde, who with Elsa’s helped, faked his own suicide in 1909 to escape his creditors. This event brought her to America a year later.\n\nHer third marriage, in 1913, was to Leopold Karl Friedrich Baron von Freytag- Loringhoven, the impoverished son of a German aristocrat who had, like Felix Greve, fled Europe to escape debts. Soon after the marriage, Leopold vanished with Elsa’s paltry savings. However, he left her with a title and an entrée into the most exclusive artistic circles in New York. The Armory Show had just transformed New York, making it modern and cosmopolitan. The Baroness was soon a habituée of the Arensberg circle, where Duchamp himself held court.\n\nDuchamp’s relationship with Elsa came at a crucial time in both of their lives and merited re-examination in Tomkins’ new edition. But the Baroness is given the same half paragraph as before, once more entertainingly dismissed as a woman ‘unhampered by sanity’. Though Tomkins acknowledges her innovative use of found objects – she sewed ‘flattened tin cans, and other strange talismans’ on to her dress – he doesn’t take her interest in them seriously. Found objects could be works of art for men; for women they were merely decorative fetishes.\n\nThe Baroness and Duchamp had studios in the same Lincoln Arcade Building, on 1947 Broadway in1916. According to Elsa, they enjoyed many midnight rendezvous. Elsa’s nickname for Duchamp was m’ars. She loved puns. M’ars was a word play on my arse and Mars, the god of war. She called herself ‘m’ars teutonic’, a female god of war, with, of course, a magnificent German posterior.\n\nThe American painter, Louis Bouché, recounted a remarkable incident. He’d bought Elsa a newspaper clipping showing Duchamp’s painting Nude Descending a Staircase. He described the scene: ‘she was all joy, took the clipping and gave herself a rub down with it, missing no part of her anatomy’, while reciting her own poem ‘Marcel, Marcel, I Love You like Hell, Marcel.’\n\nTomkins just quotes the line but leaves out the context, giving the impression that Elsa was, like many women, besotted with his hero. But, as Gammel correctly observes, Elsa’s ‘engagement with Duchamp was astutely critical.’ The rub down was cleansing as well as erotic; she presumably used the newsprint not just to arouse herself but also to wipe her ‘ars teutonic’.\n\nNude Descending a Staircase was the painting that had made Duchamp famous in America when it was exhibited at the Armory Show in 1913. Its notoriety had been predictable. Nudes didn’t move, and certainly didn’t come downstairs. The implications were scandalous: nudes in the living room, whatever next!\n\nThe year before, the Salon des Indépendants in Paris had rejected the picture not because it was too radical as a work of art but because its title was too provocative. They didn’t want any fuss in the press; they were, by then, trying to establish Cubism as a serious art form. They asked Duchamp to remove the title, but he refused.\n\nThe understandable row in the American media, as it happened, proved to be remarkably good-humoured. The American Art News offered a ten-dollar prize for the best poem about the picture, and awarded it to a ditty that ended: ‘You’ve tried to fashion her of broken bits,/ And you’ve worked yourself into seventeen fits;/ The reason you’ve failed to tell you I can,/ It isn’t a lady but only a man.’\n\nThere remains a deep ambiguousness about Duchamp’s sexuality. This was most obviously manifested in his female persona, Rrose Selavy, who appeared intermittently from 1920 to 1941, wearing furs and make up. But it also appeared in his art. His female nudes are masculine and mechanical. It was this coldness in Duchamp that Elsa caught in the portrait she painted of him on celluloid. It is now lost but was remembered by the artist George Biddle: she depicted him as an electric light bulb spitting icicles.\n\nThis contrasts with Elsa’s own bracing and embracing personality. She inspired all who came into contact with her, from Frank Wedekind to Ezra Pound, Djuna Barnes and Ernest Hemingway. The photographer Berenice Abbott said ‘The Baroness was like Jesus Christ and Shakespeare all rolled into one… perhaps she was the most influential person to me in my early life.’ Elsa became famous in literary circles from 1918 to 1921 when The Little Review presented her poetry side by side with excerpts from James Joyce’s Ulysses.\n\nVisual art was vitally important to Elsa, but hardly any survives. George Biddle described a visit to her studio in October 1917: ‘odd bits of ironware, automobile tiles… ash cans, every conceivable horror, which to her tortured yet highly sensitive perception, became objects of formal beauty… it had to me quite as much authenticity as, for instance, Brancusi’s studio in Paris.’\n\nIrene Gammel, with immaculate scholarly precision, draws together the threads of the circumstantial evidence surrounding the submission of the urinal to the Independents exhibition in 1917 and comes to the conclusion that Duchamp’s mysterious ‘female friend’ was the Baroness. As Elsa’s, the urinal becomes meaningful. Gammel relates it to several incidents in her life, including her father’s comment that saying one’s prayers was the same as taking a piss before bed. The urinal sent to the Independents exhibition, which was essentially a gentleman’s club, was another sally in her mother’s war against her abusive husband. But it was a much richer image than that.\n\nThe urinal, amazingly, was one of a pair, one of the very few sculptures by Elsa to survive. This was a U-bend plumbing trap turned upside down and mounted on a carpenter’s mitre block (therefore framing it, by punning implication, in religion). It looked like a metal ‘g’ and Elsa called it God.\n\nGod in one of Elsa’s poems is described as being ‘densely slow – He has eternity backing him’. If god is everywhere, as many believers maintain, he has to be in the most despised corners – in a U-bend to catch blocking waste that could have once been plumbed into a urinal.\n\nElsa’s sculpture God, however, could also be a portrait of Duchamp. She wrote ‘m’ars [Duchamp] came to this country – protected – by fame – to use his plumbing features – mechanical comforts – He merely amused himself. But I am m’ars tuetonic… I have not yet attained his heights. I have to fight.’ If God is Duchamp, a bent pipe, then the urinal could be a self-portrait. Laid on its back, it takes the form of a womb cradled in a pelvic girdle that could have received Duchamp’s sperm.\n\nAmerica’s declaration of war on Elsa’s beloved Germany on Good Friday 6th April 1917 could have been the trigger that made the spontaneous Elsa submit the urinal, as a late entry, to the Independents exhibition in New York. It would normally have taken three hours to send by train from Philadelphia, where she was living at that time, but the Easter weekend meant that the urinal didn’t arrive at the Independents until Monday, 12 days after submissions had closed.\n\nElsa didn’t title the urinal but signed it R. Mutt in a script close to the one she sometimes used for her poems, but which is unrelated to Duchamp’s handwriting. R. Mutt, Gammel explains, is a pun on Urmutter, the German Earth Mother whom Elsa’s symbolist friends had adulated in Munich in 1900. R. Mutt could also have been a pun on armut, meaning poverty, Elsa’s own material poverty and the poverty of American culture, which she frequently railed against. And Elsa’s favourite expletive was shitmutt. Everything fitted. The urinal was Elsa’s declaration of war against war, praise for her motherland, and her challenge to the privileged, aloof, sexually ambivalent Duchamp.\n\nThe only evidence that survives of the original urinal is the photograph Alfred Stieglitz took of it for Arensberg’s Blind Man 2 magazine. He lit it carefully so that the shadow within the urinal forms the profile of a pristine white, veiled Madonna – Elsa’s and his own German motherland is being fired at. Even more pointedly, as Glyn Thompson has pointed out, Stieglitz chose to photograph the urinal against the American Modernist Marsden Hartley’s painting Warriors, which was not hanging in his gallery at the time but had to be taken out of the storeroom. Warriors was Hartley’s hymn to the German military manhood. Stieglitz, an American German Jew, by photographing them together, identified the urinal with pro-German feeling as America went to war. Stieglitz did not take photographs casually. This suggests that he knew who had submitted the urinal and what it meant.\n\nGammel, bamboozled as so many have been by the towering status of Duchamp, does not go so far as to suggest that the urinal was solely Elsa’s, but meekly proposes that she ‘was involved in the conception’ of it. The implication is that Duchamp took the final step and made the actual submission to the exhibition. But it was in fact submitted from the address of Louise Norton, the wife of the poet Allen Norton, who knew Elsa well. Duchamp’s name wasn’t linked to the urinal until 1935, when André Breton tried to recruit him into the ranks of the Surrealists.\n\nAny lingering doubt that the urinal could be in whole or even in part by Duchamp has been removed by Glyn Thompson’s examination of what Duchamp was actually doing at that time. Duchamp stopped painting after 1912 and became a follower of the wealthy, indulgent, chess-playing writer Raymond Roussel who built absurd verbal fantasies on words that happened to sound alike but had different meanings.\n\nBy 1917 Duchamp wasn’t interested in provoking a debate about art; he was trying to do without visual art. His Readymades made use of ordinary, found objects that had no aesthetic value. They were elaborate, private rebuses, to be read, in a Rousselian way, not seen. None of them were exhibited in galleries because they weren’t works of art. The fact that Duchamp called Elsa’s urinal a ‘sculpture’ in his letter to his sister proves that the urinal couldn’t have been his. Sculpture by then was anathema to him.\n\nDuchamp, on his own admission, didn’t do the urinal. That is proven. Why then did he claim later that it was his? He was, in part, taking his revenge on art. Both his elder brothers, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp Villon, were successful artists, whereas he was not. Envy and self-loathing seep out of many of his unguarded utterances: ‘why should artists’ egos be allowed to overflow and poison the atmosphere?’ he said in 1963. ‘Can’t you just smell the stench in the air?’\n\nHe also appropriated the urinal for practical reasons: he had so little of his own to show. When he eventually gave up trying to be a chess champion in 1933 (his serious ambition till then) it dawned on him that he could build an artistic career by repackaging his early notoriety in America. The problem he faced was that few of his early paintings survived and his Readymades were not visual art, and most of them, anyway, no longer existed, having been allowed to slip back into the visual anonymity from which they had come. Nevertheless, he managed, especially after gaining American citizenship in 1955, to turn himself into one of the grandfathers of modern art, as great as Picasso, Matisse and Mondrian, even though the ‘iconic masterpiece’ he built his reputation on was stolen property.\n\nTomkins’ upholding of the Duchamp myth has to be considered in the light of MoMA’s support in republishing his ‘updated’ book. The art world as a whole sustains the orthodox view that the urinal is by Duchamp. Countless curatorial and academic reputations and the whole school of Conceptual Art have been founded on this attribution. And national pride is at stake: the urinal was America’s contribution to the founding of Modernism. The date 1917 adds authority, for the urinal is contemporary with Dada and Surrealism.\n\nAdded to that is the money. Millions of pounds have been invested in the copies Duchamp commissioned of Elsa’s urinal (there are thought to be 14 of these though the number is disputed), the majority of which are now in public galleries around the world from Paris to Tokyo, London to San Francisco, Ottawa to Jerusalem. It is a sad reflection of our culture that artists can become billionaires by creating collectable objects, whereas poets, even if they make as great a contribution to society, rarely earn more than pennies. Elsa died destitute; she was frequently arrested for shoplifting. In prison she learnt how to make pets of rats.\n\nDuchamp’s urinals need to be relabeled Elsa’s. This could have a profound impact on the future of art. Duchamp’s pinched urinal is nasty, empty and spiteful. His belated explanation of ‘R. Mutt’ as a reference to the J.L. Mott Iron Works (where no-one could have bought this particular urinal) and to the popular newspaper comic strip\n\nMutt and Jeff is a meaningless obfuscation. Elsa’s original urinal is fulsome, loving and furious. Its form is disquietingly beautiful and its punning signature painfully profound.\n\nThat one object can mean two such different things is the chief drawback of Conceptualism. What you see in a found object is not totally orchestrated by the artist, as it is, say, when you look at a Goya, a Matisse or a Michelangelo. Conceptual art is dressed, in part, by the viewer’s own thoughts.\n\nDuchamp made this point in a lecture he gave in Houston in 1957: ‘The creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator… adds his contribution.’ And then he added, ‘This becomes even more obvious when posterity rehabilitates forgotten artists.’ He was describing what he himself was doing at that time: faking his own reputation by stealing Elsa’s work and changing what it meant. Conceptual art started then, when he began to build this lie, not earlier, as the orthodox view maintains, in 1917.\n\nEgalitarians in art, Tomkins among them, have argued that participation is liberating for the public because it enables them to contribute to the artistic process. This might be true of minor manifestations of art, like country dancing, but not many feel the need to add their pennyworth to a creation by Rembrandt, Shakespeare or Beethoven.\n\nSpectator contributions are, moreover, subject to deception and self-deception. The naked Emperor was dressed not only in the minds of his beholders but also in his own. Conceptual Art carries such wishful thinking to extremes: it argues that anything can be art if an artist says it is, and that no one has the right to say that something isn’t art nor that someone isn’t an artist. Conceptualism strips art of aesthetic judgment, which is essential to all creative expression. This politically correct philosophy of ‘anything goes’ has to led to the art world being awash with the detritus of found objects, tracks left by would-be shaman, while the disciplined skill of visual creativity, above all the arts of painting and sculpture, have been marginalised.\n\nWhen Duchamp stole Elsa’s urinal and robbed it of its meaning he was attacking the whole of visual art. Tomkins repeatedly quotes Duchamp as saying that he wanted to put art ‘once again at the service of the mind.’ Since the time of Courbet, Duchamp argued, art had become exclusively ‘retinal,’ in that its appeal was primarily to the eye. This is nonsensical. The retina can’t see. The mind sees. All art is a mental perception, and, in that way, conceptual. To imply, as Duchamp so often did, that the marks of Van Gogh, Picasso, and, later, Pollock were mindless gestures hid his secret loathing of visual art itself.\n\nElsa’s urinal is the opposite; it is a glorious celebration of visual art. It declares that even the most unlikely, despised object can become, in the hands of an artist, a beautiful, resonant work of art. Elsa’s urinal wasn’t an idea ‘chosen’ by the mind; it was ‘seen’ in an inspired moment of revelation. As such, it re-affirms the primacy of sight in visual art. It deserves to rank alongside Dali’s Lobster Telephone, Picasso’s Head of a Bull made of a bicycle saddle and handlebars and Niki de St Phalle’s target, I Shot Daddy (to which it is similar in feeling).\n\nThe back cover of this new edition of Tomkins’ biography is emblazoned with a quote from the critic Richard Dorment: ‘What Tomkins makes us see more clearly than ever before is that Duchamp set art free. By making it more intelligent, he made it more interesting and also more fun. What he did cannot be undone.’ It has to be because he didn’t do it. What he did do has led future generations into making increasingly tedious, repetitious piss-takes of art. Duchamp’s theft is a canker in the heart of visual creativity.\n\nDuchamp – A Biography by Calvin Tompkins. New and Revised Edition.

But the art world as a whole—museums, academia and the market—has persistently refused to acknowledge this fact. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York is the latest eminent body to bury its head in the sand. It has just published a new edition of Calvin Tomkins’s 1996 life of Duchamp, updated by its author. Ann Temkin, MoMA’s chief curator of painting and sculpture, praises Tomkins in her introduction for his “thorough research”. But Tomkins avoids addressing the implications of the question marks over the origins of the work that Duchamp himself raised in 1917.\n\nThe public has a right to believe what it reads on a museum label. The Moderna Museet, Stockholm, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, the National Gallery of Canada, the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto, Indiana University Art Museum, Bloomington, the Centre Pompidou, Paris and the Israel Museum should all re-label their copies of Fountain as “a replica, appropriated by Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968), of an original by Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (1874-1927)”.\n\nThe extraordinary fact that has emerged from the painstaking ­studies of William Camfield, Kirk Varnedoe and Hector Obalk is that Duchamp could not have done what he said he did late in life. Irene Gammel and Glyn Thompson have revealed the truth of his much earlier private account that he did not submit the urinal to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition in New York in 1917. Nevertheless, Duchamp’s late, fictional story is still taught in every class and recited in every book.\n\n[Follow the link below to read the entire article — A C-P]\n\nhttps://www.theartnewspaper.com/2014/11/01/did-marcel-duchamp-steal-elsas-urinal?utm_source=pocket_saves\n\n(2017)\n\n¶¶¶\n\nEnduring Ornament\n\nElsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, 1913\n\nReed Enger, “Enduring Ornament,” in Obelisk Art History,\n\nPublished August 03, 2017; last modified October 14, 2022\n\nThe year is 1913 and Elsa Endell, kaleidoscopic performance artist and poet is on her way to New York’s city hall for her third marriage, this time to a German Baron named Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven.

A year later, Elsa’s close friend Marcel Duchamp showcased Bottle Rack, a found object he claimed as a new category of art, the ‘readymade.’\n\nhttp://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/elsa-von-freytag-loringhoven/enduring-ornament/.\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“Les nouvelles fables de Fountain 1917-2017”\n\nMichaël La Chance\n\nEn avril 1917, une pièce de céramique est déposée au Grand Central Palace, sur Lexington Avenue, afin d’être exposée au salon de la Société des artistes indépendants de New York. Cet urinoir est enregistré sous le nom de R. Mutt. Malgré les principes de base de la Société, dont l’absence de sélection, quelques membres du comité directeur contestent son statut d’œuvre et l’objet n’est pas exposé le soir du vernissage. On apprend plus tard que R. Mutt serait un pseudo dont le prénom est Richard, que l’œuvre est inti- tulée Fountain, que l’adresse du mystérieux R. Mutt est celle de Louise Norton, une femme de lettres qui dirige Rogue, une revue d’avant-garde. Malgré ce dernier indice, il ne fait pas de doute pour la plupart des gens que l’auteur de cette provocation est nul autre que Marcel Duchamp, l’enfant terrible de la scène de l’art. Pourtant, il faudra attendre plusieurs années avant que celui-ci revendique Fountain et se décide à en produire des copies, l’original ayant disparu quelques jours après le scandale.\n\nEn effet, au début des années cinquante, des galeristes se présenteront à la porte de Duchamp avec des urinoirs qu’ils lui demandent de signer. C’est que l’urinoir renversé de 1917, malgré sa disparition, ou plutôt parce qu’il a disparu, est l’une des œuvres les plus controversées du XXe siècle. Cent ans plus tard, il importe de revenir sur les « fables » de Fountain, sur la diversité des hypothèses et des scénarios qui entourent l’auteur (ou les auteur.e.s) de l’œuvre ainsi que sur les circonstances de sa création.\n\n(…)\n\n[Follow the link to read this important article — AC-P]\n\nRef.: La Chance, M.

Mutt” to an exhibition in New York on April 9, 1917 — and rejected because Mutt was not a member of the exhibiting society — this ‘submission’ would be misconstrued as demonstrating that art could be anything that an artist said it was, resulting in the colonization by “conceptual art” of galleries from Memphis, Egypt, to Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nThis allegedly radical gesture — one that overturned traditional art making — was then misattributed 18 years later to one Marcel Duchamp (1883-1968), but no evidence existed then or now to suggest or confirm that Duchamp had, in fact, been responsible.\n\nIn 1982, contemporary evidence from Duchamp’s own hand unexpectedly surfaced and disqualified him. This letter, sent to his sister in Paris, stated plainly that not he but a female friend had sent the urinal to exhibition.\n\nBut, secure in the delusion the letter that could expose him had apparently disappeared, in 1966 Duchamp would claim that he had obtained the urinal from the J. L. Mott Iron Works at Fifth Avenue and 17th Street in Manhattan — which would have been impossible, for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, the Mott catalogue from April 1917 didn’t include the rejected urinal, photographed by Alfred Stieglitz in 1917, and from 1908 all J. L. Mott publicity reiterated that all the plumbing fixtures that it sold it manufactured itself — and this one it didn’t.\n\nSecond, vitreous porcelain urinals could be obtained from a manufacturer only by plumbing supply houses, which sold to contractors and master plumbers — not avant-garde artists.\n\nThird, the seven floors of the J. L. Mott building at 118-120 Fifth Avenue (see Figure 2) that were accessible to the public consisted entirely of showrooms from which, as with automobiles, no direct retail purchases could be made, since their exclusive function then, as now, was to display — and many showroom fixtures were under pressure.\n\nAnd, finally, the urinal in question had actually been made by the Trenton Potteries Company (TPCo) of Trenton, New Jersey, and manufactured in its particular size between 1915 and 1920, but in a smaller size range from 1892 to 1922. This was the Vitreous China Flat-back Lipped “Bedfordshire” No. 2 (See Figure 3) — by 1917, “Bedfordshire” urinals had for decades been made in three almost universally standard sizes.\n\nAs the master plumbers of America will be aware, the “Bedfordshire” was the most basic, simplest and cheapest of wall-hung earthenware urinals, the first examples made on and of American soil — copies of English imports — being manufactured by Thomas Maddock in Trenton in 1873 (see Figure 4).\n\nThere was, in fact, a “Bedfordshire” model in the Mott inventory (of seven urinals) in 1917 (see Figure 5), but it cannot be confused with the TPCo example since the two clearly differed in critical details.\n\nFirst, the unique combination and style of perforated ventilator and integral strainer of the Trenton Potteries’ “Bedfordshire” cannot be mistaken for that of the Mott, nor of any other design or make of urinal. And second, the Mott model incorporated a patent overflow that the Trenton Potteries model clearly lacked.\n\nWhile the system whereby urinals were manufactured, marketed and distributed in the U.S. in the period running up to and beyond World War 1 invalidated Duchamp’s claim, it simultaneously made it easy for his female friend to stroll into any of the scores of high-street plumbers’ shops in Philadelphia — where she resided and from where the rejected urinal would be sent to New York — and pick up a urinal cheaply, for the article in question had suffered a fault in its burning that rendered it useless to a plumber.\n\nThis is revealed if an actual example of the urinal (see Figure 7) is compared with another photograph taken of the same article in the summer of 1918, showing it hanging from the ceiling of Duchamp’s studio.\n\nBut the fault can only be identified by those who know what they’re looking at, which means that to unravel this conundrum you need to consult Joe the Plumber, who can tell you that the fault had occurred at the dynamic fulcrum of the pattern where the perforated ventilator and the integral strainer meet at the seam joining the back of the urinal to the bowl — rather than a Duchamp ‘expert,’ who can’t.\n\nMutt’s urinal’s actual author was not exactly a “nobody,” though. On the run from the NYPD for shoplifting, cross-dressing quick-change artist Baroness Elsa Von Freytag-Loringhoven had fled to Philadelphia from New York in January 1917. Astonishingly, the daughter-in-law of the German Kaiser’s Chief of Staff lived precariously on the fringes of the art world, scratching a living as a model, shoplifter and possibly prostitute.\n\nBut because she was a woman, she would be written out of the boys’ club of modern art. And since she died in 1927 in relative obscurity (see Figure 8), she wasn’t around in 1935 when her urinal was misattributed by Andre Breton to Duchamp.\n\nBreton failed to cite any evidence in support of his claim. No surprise there, because none exists.\n\nhttps://www.pmmag.com/articles/101751-the-urinal-that-precipitated-modern-art\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“The iconic Fountain (1917) is not created by Marcel Duchamp”\n\nDoor Theo Paijmans | june, 2018\n\nIn 1917, when the United States was about to enter the First World War and women in the United Kingdom had just earned their right to vote, a different matter occupied the sentiments of the small, modernist art scene in New York. It had organised an exhibit where anyone could show his or her art against a small fee, but someone had sent in a urinal for display. This was against even the most avant-garde taste of the organisers of the exhibit. The urinal, sent in anonymously, without title and only signed with the enigmatic ‘R. Mutt’, quickly vanished from view. Only one photo of the urinal remains.\n\nBUT THEN THINGS TOOK A TURN\n\nIn 1982 a letter written by Duchamp came to light. Dated 11 April 1917, it was written just a few days after that fateful exhibit. It contains one sentence that should have sent shockwaves through the world of modern art: it reveals the true creator behind Fountain – but it was not Duchamp. Instead he wrote that a female friend using a male alias had sent it in for the New York exhibition. Suddenly a few other things began to make sense. Over time Duchamp had told two different stories of how he had created Fountain, but both turned out to be untrue. An art historian who knew Duchamp admitted that he had never asked him about Fountain, he had published a standard-work on Fountain nevertheless. The place from where Fountain was sent raised more questions. That place was Philadelphia, but Duchamp had been living in New York.\n\nFEMALE FRIEND\n\nWho was living in Philadelphia? Who was this ‘female friend’ that had sent the urinal using a pseudonym that Duchamp mentions? That woman was, as Duchamp wrote, the future. Art history knows her as Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. She was a brilliant pioneering New York dada artist, and Duchamp knew her well. This glaring truth has been known for some time in the art world, but each time it has to be acknowledged, it is met with indifference and silence.\n\nThis article addresses the true authorship of Fountain from the perspective of the latest evidence, collected by several experts. The opinions they voice offer their latest insights. Their accumulation of evidence strengthens the case to its final conclusion. To attribute Fountain to a woman and not a man has obvious, far-reaching consequences: the history of modern art has to be rewritten. Modern art did not start with a patriarch, but with a matriarch. What power structure in the world of modern art prohibits this truth to become more widely known and generally accepted? Ultimately this is one of the larger questions looming behind the authorship of Fountain. It sheds light on the place and role of the female artist in the world of modern art.\n\nFORGOTTEN AND IGNORED\n\nWhy did Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven never claim Fountain as her work? She never had the chance. While she lived the urinal was thrown out, became lost and quickly forgotten. She died in 1927, eight years before Bréton attributed Fountain to Duchamp for the first time. Decades after her death Duchamp began to commission the first replica of Fountain. While he rose to superstardom, she ended as a footnote in the history of modern art. Her artist career is exemplary for what has happened to countless other female artists who were ignored, marginalized and ostracized from the canon.\n\nIn this larger frame, the true story about who really created Fountain’s is one poignant example out of many. It is time for art history to be rewritten – and that time is now.\n\n‘ONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS’\n\nWhen Andre Bréton attributes the work to Duchamp in 1935, he remains silent. In the 1960s, Duchamp puts stories into the world that are supposed to confirm that it was his work – stories that are easy to unmask, as it turns out. In the 1980s, a letter from Marcel Duchamp from 1917, in the same month that the exhibition took place, surfaces. In this letter he writes to his sister Suzanne that one of his girlfriends has submitted a urinal for the exhibition. However, this letter does little for the recognition of the real maker. Duchamp has already become the father of conceptual art. He is too big to fail , thanks to ‘his’ masterpiece Fountain in 1917. There are exactly seventeen replicas of Fountainin circulation – in the collections of, among others, Tate Modern in London, The Philadelphia Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto – all commissioned by Duchamp. None of the replicas mention the name of the real maker: Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.\n\nFINALLY\n\nThe debate is not over yet. There are pros and cons. But, leaving Fountain ‘s authorship aside, it is remarkable that so many people have been able to become acquainted with the genius artist Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. As Joyce Roodnat described so beautifully in the NRC last week:\n\nI’m following the debate on the issue. I notice how holy Duchamp is and I think: don’t worry so much. Fountain exists, that’s the main thing. What touches me more is that I only now know about the influential German artist who shook up the New York avant-garde between 1913 and 1923, using her body as an instrument and her life as a work of art in progress. I buy her biography (by Irene Gammel, 2003) and enjoy myself blankly. What a wonderful woman. Pure dada. How is it possible that she is so little known? Why all those exhibitions about Marcel Duchamp and not about her?\n\nLong live Elsa! And all those other great artists that we will discover.\n\n(2019)\n\n¶¶¶\n\n“A woman in the men’s room: when will the art world recognise the real artist behind Duchamp’s Fountain?”\n\nSiri Hustvedt\n\nThe Guardian, Fri 29 Mar 2019 13.00 GMT\n\nLast modified on Wed 3 Apr 2019 15.11 BST\n\nEvidence suggests the famous urinal Fountain, attributed to Marcel Duchamp, was actually created by Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. Why haven’t we heard of her, asks Siri Hustvedt\n\nThe story goes like this: Marcel Duchamp, brilliant inventor of the “ready-made” and “anti-retinal art”, submitted Fountain, a urinal signed R Mutt, to the American Society of Independent Artists in 1917. The piece was rejected. Duchamp, a member of the board, resigned. Alfred Stieglitz photographed it. The thing vanished, but conceptual art was born. In 2004 it was voted the most influential modern artwork of all time.\n\nBut what if the person behind the urinal was not Duchamp, but the German-born poet and artist Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (1874-1927)? She appears in my most recent novel, Memories of the Future, as an insurrectionist inspiration for my narrator. One reviewer of the novel described the baroness as “a marginal figure in art history who was a raucous ‘proto-punk’ poet from whom Duchamp allegedly stole the concept for his urinal”. It is true that she was part of the Dada movement, published in the Little Review with Ezra Pound, Djuna Barnes, TS Eliot, Mina Loy and James Joyce and has been marginalised in art history, but the case made in my book, derived from scholarly sources enumerated in the acknowledgements, is not that Duchamp “allegedly stole the concept for his urinal” from Von Freytag-Loringhoven, but rather that she was the one who found the object, inscribed it with the name R Mutt, and that this “seminal” artwork rightly belongs to her.\n\nIn the novel, I quote a 1917 letter Duchamp wrote to his sister, Susanne. I took the translation directly from Irene Gammel’s excellent biography of Von Freytag-Loringhoven, Baroness Elsa: “One of my female friends who had adopted the masculine pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture.” I got it wrong. Glyn Thompson, an art scholar and indefatigable champion of the baroness as the brain behind the urinal, pointed out to me that Duchamp wrote “avait envoyé” not “m’a envoyé” – “sent in”, not “sent me”. R Mutt was identified as an artist living in Philadelphia, which is where she was living at the time. In 1935 André Breton attributed the urinal to Duchamp, but it wasn’t until 1950, long after the baroness had died and four years after Stieglitz’s death, that Duchamp began to take credit for the piece and authorise replicas.\n\nDuchamp said he had purchased the urinal from JL Mott Ironworks Company, adapting Mutt from Mott, but the company did not manufacture the model in the photograph, so his story cannot be true. Von Freytag-Loringhoven loved dogs. She paraded her mutts on the sidewalks of Greenwich Village. She collected pipes and spouts and drains. She relished scatological jokes and made frequent references to plumbing in her poems: “Iron – my soul – cast iron!” “Marcel Dushit”. She poked fun at William Carlos Williams by calling him WC. She created God, a plumbing trap as artwork, once attributed to Morton Schamberg, now to both of them. Gammel notes in her book that R Mutt sounds like Armut, the word for poverty in German, and when the name is reversed it reads Mutter – mother. The baroness’s devout mother died of uterine cancer. She was convinced her mother died because her tyrannical father failed to treat his venereal disease. (The uterine character of the upside-down urinal has long been noted.) And the handwriting on the urinal matches the handwriting Von Freytag-Loringhoven used for her poems.\n\nAll this and more appears in Gammel’s biography. All this and more reappears in my novel. All the evidence has been painstakingly reiterated in numerous articles and, as part of the Edinburgh festival fringe, Glyn Thompson and Julian Spalding, a former director of Glasgow Museums, mounted the 2015 exhibition A Lady’s Not a Gent’s, which presented the factual and circumstantial evidence for reattribution of the urinal to Von Freytag-Loringhoven.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/29/marcel-duchamp-fountain-women-art-history\n\n¶¶¶\n\nAtlas Press\n\n“Marcel Duchamp was not a thief”\n\nThis is the first of three pages on this site devoted to the accusation by Professor Irene Gammel, and then by Julian Spalding and Glyn Thompson, that the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven was involved in the creation of “Fountain” by Marcel Duchamp — indeed, according to Spalding and Thompson, that he actually stole it from her.\n\nFollowing letters from Dawn Ades in The Guardian and from Alastair Brotchie in The Times Literary Supplement, objecting to repetitions of this unproved allegation, we decided to join forces to refute it factually. By chance, it was around this time that we discovered that Bradley Bailey had found important new information that he was about to publish in The Burlington Magazine (161, October 2019). The same issue therefore included our detailed summary of the factual evidence to date (and this version of it has been updated to include Bailey’s discoveries) and it was hoped that this text would launch a debate between all protagonists based around facts rather than suppositions.\n\nThis summary remains the most detailed survey of the facts, along with critiques of the alternative accounts based on these facts.\n\nHere are the complete contents of the pages that follow:\n\nPAGE 1: MARCEL DUCHAMP WAS NOT A THIEF https://atlaspress.co.uk/marcel-duchamp-was-not-a-thief/\n\nTexts 1.

This article is being updated (our thanks for corrections from Francis Naumann) in order to make it the definitive account of this affair. The reader will see, as the correspondence unfolds, that neither Irene Gammel, Julian Spalding and Glyn Thompson, nor David Lee, editor of The Jackdaw (who expressed his agreement with Spalding and Thompson when he published them), have responded to any of the specific points in this account that dispute their versions.\n\nIn November 2014 The Art Newspaper published an article by Julian Spalding and Glyn Thompson, ‘Did Marcel Duchamp steal Elsa’s urinal?’1 Their contention, and that of Irene Gammel, the biographer of the artist and poet Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, is that the Baroness was responsible for submitting the famous Fountain, an upturned urinal signed ‘R. Mutt’, to the Society of Independent Artists (SIA) exhibition in New York in April 1917.\n\nThe idea of Duchamp as an ‘art-thief’ has become something of an internet meme – accepted as true, without anyone ever bothering to check the evidence. Refuting it then becomes a matter of proving a negative, which is much harder to do. We are well aware that facts and evidence can be rather less amusing than speculation and conspiracy theories, but there is a truth to be revealed here that relates to the integrity of one of the most important artists of the last century, and an artwork frequently judged the most important of the last 100 years. This truth has been carefully obscured by a blizzard of irrelevant research by Spalding and Thompson, the intention of which appears to have been to conceal the fact that no serious evidence whatsoever has been presented that links the Baroness to Fountain. Moreover, Bradley Bailey’s article in The Burlington Magazine published evidence that finally put paid to their speculative contentions. These contentions nonetheless need to be dealt with, and following Bailey’s article we wanted to summarise the facts of this affair.\n\nThere are three versions of the events that gave rise to this ‘sculpture’: firstly, the generally accepted account, based on what Duchamp himself said, and accounts by eye-witnesses, the perpetrators and contemporary publications; secondly, Gammel’s speculations in her biography of the Baroness; and thirdly, Spalding’s and Thompson’s account, which attempts to claim Fountain for the Baroness while avoiding the inaccuracies in Gammel’s version.\n\nAccording to Duchamp’s biographer,2 the idea for the urinal was due to a last-minute impulse. Following a lunch together, and just before the SIA exhibition was about to open, Duchamp, accompanied by Walter Arensberg and Joseph Stella, bought a urinal at a store, and he either took it to his studio or directly to the exhibition venue, signed it ‘R. Mutt’ and attached a submission label bearing the address of Louise Norton. It was then submitted for exhibition, but never was exhibited. Instead it was taken to Alfred Stieglitz’s studio so he could photograph it.3 Duchamp used the inevitable scandal (which would have occurred whether the exhibit was accepted or not) and Stieglitz’s photograph to explain the rationale behind readymades in the magazine The Blindman, again anonymously, through an article by his friend Beatrice Wood.4 Thus two of Duchamp’s female friends collaborated in this affair: Norton and Wood.\n\nGammel’s version is that the Baroness may have sent the urinal to Duchamp, who put it in for the exhibition. He then used the scandal to explain readymades. She casts doubt on Duchamp’s authorship of Fountain on the basis of a letter from Duchamp to his sister Suzanne, dated 11th April 1917. The relevant part of Duchamp’s letter reads:\n\nTell the family this snippet: the Independents opened here with enormous success. A female friend of mine, using a male pseudonym, Richard Mutt, submitted a porcelain urinal as a sculpture. It wasn’t at all indecent. No reason to refuse it. The committee decided to refuse to exhibit this thing. I handed in my resignation and it’ll be a juicy piece of gossip in New York.5\n\nGammel translated this letter so that the pivotal sentence reads: ‘One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture’.6 Gammel then tentatively identified the ‘female friend’ as the Baroness, based solely on the fact that, according to a journalist, Mutt lived in Philadelphia (see note 23 for the text), as did the Baroness. Gammel suggests that the Baroness may have sent the urinal to Duchamp, and that it therefore might have been ‘a collaboration’.7\n\nGammel’s interpretation is mistaken. The letter actually says that Fountain was submitted to the SIA in the category of sculpture, and not sent to Duchamp personally. No one knows why the journalist gave the artist’s home as Philadelphia,8 and his article is unreliable as a source, because even though it is very short it contains several other blatant errors or inventions.9 There is, furthermore, a version of Alfred Stieglitz’s photograph of Fountain (Fig.2) in which the submission label is visible and the artist’s address is clearly legible. The address is not that of the Baroness but of Louise Norton. Gammel relegated this important information to an endnote.10 The writing on the label is not Louise’s,11 but Duchamp could have asked anyone to fill it in using Norton’s address, or could have done it himself and disguised his handwriting.12 Finally, Norton’s involvement was further confirmed when it was discovered that the phone number for contacting Mutt given to the critic Henry McBride by Charles Demuth, was hers.13 Gammel does not mention this fact at all.\n\nWhile Spalding and Thompson acknowledge that their version is based upon Gammel’s research,14 they need a different story in order to avoid its shortcomings, namely her ignoring the evident part played by Norton, and her incorrect translation of the letter. So they speculate that the Baroness (then famously close to destitution) buys the urinal in Philadelphia, presumably signs it (while disguising her handwriting, even though her handwriting would be unknown to anyone involved), and then has it sent to Norton, who adds the label and submits it. Duchamp then ‘steals’ it and uses it to explain readymades. Thus the whole of their case depends on the Baroness and Norton knowing each other, and they baldly state that Norton ‘knew Elsa well’.15 No source is given for this statement, and Bailey has revealed in his article that, according to Norton’s own words, she did not know the Baroness. The Spalding and Thompson version cannot, therefore, be correct.\n\nSpalding’s and Thompson’s evidence for their version is the letter to Suzanne; the Philadelphia connection; and the assertion that Duchamp’s account of how he bought the urinal is incorrect (based on Thompson’s research intended to prove that the firm of Mott did not make this model of urinal, etc.).\n\nThe evidence against it is as follows: Spalding and Thompson repeatedly use the letter as evidence that Duchamp ‘lied’ about the origins of Fountain. In fact, Duchamp told his sister exactly what friends in the New York art scene who were not in on the hoax were allowed to know. Stieglitz repeated precisely the same story in a letter to Georgia O’Keefe, and the previously mentioned letter from Demuth to MacBride does essentially the same.16 Spalding and Thompson criticise Duchamp’s biographer’s interpretation of the letter to Suzanne:17 ‘Tomkins [. . .] argues that Duchamp wanted (for reasons he doesn’t explain) to keep his involvement in the “affair” of the urinal secret. This was why he pretended in his letter to his sister that a “female friend” had submitted the object. But this explanation makes no sense because his sister, a Red Cross nurse in Paris, had no contacts with the New York media’.18\n\nHowever, Tomkins is correct and Spalding and Thompson are wrong. There is no mystery as to why Duchamp needed to keep his identity secret. He was on the board of directors of the SIA exhibition and head of the hanging committee, and if he had submitted the urinal under his own name then some way would have been found to defuse the situation, and avoid the scandal he was intent upon, as he explained in an interview in 1966.19 As for the assertion that the artist (rather than ‘the nurse’) Suzanne Duchamp was not in touch with the New York art scene (rather more important than the “media” in this context), her partner in Paris was Jean Crotti, soon to be her husband, who in 1916 had shared a studio with Duchamp in New York. Crotti had lived there for several years, and had been a habitué of the Arensberg salon. He was on amiable terms with many of those involved with the exhibition, as well as with members of the wider international avant-garde.\n\nSpalding and Thompson have disputed Duchamp’s reason for secrecy, but not explained the Baroness’s.20 Why would she have gone to all this trouble to submit this ‘sculpture’ under an assumed name? (Suggestions please?) Spalding and Thompson also speculate that R. Mutt should be read as ‘armut’, the German for poverty, or “urmutter”,21 earth mother, and that this explains the work’s meaning when attributed to the Baroness: it was ‘Elsa’s declaration of war against a man’s war – an extraordinary visual assault on all that men stood for’.22 This is an amusing game, and we can all come up with possible meanings for artworks, but to be taken seriously they need to be based on something, perhaps a convincing similarity to the author’s other works or on documentary evidence. This is absent here, and it seems especially unlikely because for nearly everything else that the Baroness wrote or made in the USA, she used English (for obvious reasons).\n\nThere are a number of other objections to this scenario. According to the label, “Richard Mutt” (not R. Mutt) submitted an exhibit called ‘Fountain’, and not ‘Urinal’ as Spalding and Thompson suppose (note 11). Had it been exhibited, visitors would have assumed that ‘R. Mutt’ was the artist’s signature (because it was), and nothing would have indicated that the key to the work’s meaning was not to be found in its title, which would be the usual practice, but in the artist’s name. Even that knowledge would have been insufficent: the viewer had to know that it must be read as a German homonym. However, no clues were given (Mutt is not even a German name), so this supposed meaning of the work would have been completely opaque to viewers at the exhibition: a rather ineffective ‘declaration of war’! Furthermore, this supposedly “feminist” artwork, “an assault on all that men stood for”, was submitted under a man’s name, which further muddies the waters, and the work would, presumably, have had its actual title of Fountain, since this is visible on the submission label — a title that appears to us unrelated to the intentions invented for it by Spalding and Thompson. Absurdity upon absurdity, and none of it adds up.\n\nThe extreme unreliability of the original journalist’s reference to Philadelphia has already been pointed out, even by Spalding and Thompson,23 yet (so far as we can see) their identification of the Baroness as the ‘female friend’ is based solely on this source, which furthermore refers to “Mutt” and not to the Baroness. Thompson devotes interminable pages to proving that the firm of Mott did not make this model of urinal, and so on. This is all irrelevant if no connection between Fountain and the Baroness can be made, but it is still worth noting that Thompson’s arguments are almost entirely based upon a Mott catalogue dated 1908,24 and so cannot prove anything about events that happened in 1917.\n\nFinally, Spalding and Thompson repeatedly allude to the fact that neither Norton nor the Baroness were members of the SIA and therefore they were not eligible to submit anything, let alone after the submission deadline.25 These strictures did not apply to Duchamp, who was actually supervising the hanging of the exhibition. But we do not understand why Spalding and Thompson think this information supports, rather than refutes, their case?\n\nSuch was the state of this debate until recently. No connection had been established between Fountain and the Baroness. On the contrary, many facts suggested that it was extremely unlikely that she had anything to do with it, not the least of them being that she herself never claimed the work as her own, at the time, nor in the years afterwards, in private or in print. She did not even object to the second issue of The Blindman, which was dedicated to Fountain, to which she was not invited to contribute and which, of course, does not mention her name. Why such extraordinary restraint? Likewise, none of the many people involved ever mentioned her name in connection with this affair at the time, nor in any of their subsequent interviews or numerous memoirs.26\n\nIn his genuinely brilliant research published in The Burlington Magazine, Bailey has revealed two crucial facts which confirm the generally accepted version of events. First, the Baroness could not have sent Fountain to Louise Norton: Bailey cites an unpublished interview of March 1978 with Norton and Beatrice Wood in which both say that they neither met nor knew of the Baroness at the time, although subsequently they vaguely heard of her.27 Their exact words were as follows:\n\nBW: Who was that creature that I was told Marcel liked [. . .] the Baroness or something? Did you know about her?\n\nLN: I don’t know.\n\nBW: I never met her. She is supposed to be very eccentric and dressed in a very strange way.\n\nLN: I never met her, no.\n\nBW: You remember hearing about her?\n\nLN: Vaguely, you see, it rings a bell that’s never rung before.\n\nThus the Baroness cannot have been the ‘female friend’ of Duchamp’s letter; it can only have been Norton, just as common sense indicated all along.28\n\nSecondly, Norton, in the unpublished draft of an article written in 1972 that discussed the SIA exhibition, wrote of Duchamp that:\n\nMarcel was more serious in one of his jests than I realised at the time. Co-Founder and member of the Sty. of Independent Artists he helped organise the Independents Show of 1917. There was to be no jury. Any painter’s work would be exhibited on payment of a six dollar fee. To test the bona fides of the hanging committee he sent in a porcelain urinal which he titled, Fountain by R. Mutt. The committee promptly threw it out and Marcel very angry promptly resigned.\n\nWith this statement, ‘the female friend’, Louise Norton, confirmed Duchamp’s authorship of this work of art. Furthermore, she states that Duchamp himself ‘sent in’ the urinal, which confirmed Duchamp’s version: there was never any need for it to go to Norton’s house, and only in Spalding’s and Thompson’s version of events does Norton herself send it from there.\n\nThis statement of Louise Norton’s needs putting in context. Almost the only undisputed fact in this affair is that Norton’s address was on the submission label attached to Fountain: this fact is agreed by Gammel, by Spalding and Thompson and by those who accept Duchamp’s account. Gammel consigned it to a footnote, Spalding and Thompson acknowledge it and assert that Norton submitted the urinal for the Baroness, in the accepted account it was either Duchamp or Norton who ‘submitted’ the urinal, but it seems from what she says here that she simply allowed Duchamp to use her address. Whatever the case, Louise Norton is the only person whose pivotal role is acknowledged in all three versions of these events, and because of this role she had to know what actually happened. And she wrote that Duchamp ‘sent in a porcelain urinal which he titled, Fountain by R. Mutt’. A statement of total clarity, which on its own refutes the versions proposed by Gammel, Spalding and Thompson. It is a great shame this statement was not published when Gammel wrote her biography of the Baroness, because then this whole controversy could never have arisen.\n\nDespite Gammel’s welcome aim of restoring agency to women artists and poets, it is unfortunate that she chose to champion the Baroness rather than the other women in the New York avant-garde who were actually involved in the 1917 Fountain incident, and who are no less forgotten by history: Louise Norton and Beatrice Wood. Contrary to Gammel’s approach, Spalding and Thompson have been belligerently abusive from the start. So we repeat what we wrote at the beginning of this letter: there is no evidence of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven being involved in any way whatsoever with Fountain. Unless they can provide evidence on this specific point, we suggest that the honourable course of action on their part would be to admit they were mistaken and to apologise for their accusations, which have turned out to be unfounded.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 J.

Roché (S. Stauffer: ‘Marcel Duchamp’, Die Schriften, 1, 1981, p.280). These two versions can be easily reconciled if the article was the result of conversations between these three that were summarised by Wood, as implied by the entry in her diary for 7 April 1917: “Discussion about Richard Mutt’s exhibit[ion]. Read Roche my articles. We work at Marcel’s” (Archives of American Art, Beatrice Wood Papers). The editorial does not specifically use the word “readymade” but does explain Duchamp’s ideas behind this concept. The connection between the urinal and readymades was first specifically made by Picabia in 391, VIII (February 1919), p.8, although Spalding and Thompson repeatedly assert that this connection was first made by André Breton in 1935 (e.g. at http://www.openculture.com).\n\n5 F.

Gammel: Baroness Elsa, Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity, Cambridge MA and London 2002, p.224. Gammel incorrectly states that Fountain was displayed at the SIA exhibition, and makes various other conjectures that are rebutted in D. Ades: ‘Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain”: a continuing controversy’, Journal of the London Institute of ’Pataphysics 14/15 (2018), pp.109–11.\n\n7 Gammel, op. cit. (note 6), p.225. However, Spalding and Thompson consistently exaggerate Gammel’s position, and in their correspondence with Nicholas Serota they write that she had concluded that the evidence that Fountain should be attributed to the Baroness was ‘overwhelming’, Thompson, op. cit. (note 2), p.4. She neither wrote this nor implied it.\n\n8 It is likely that he or his informant was being ironic, in the manner of W.C. Fields. Philadelphia, due to its Mormon and Quaker roots, was considered to be notoriously dull, and thus the last place one would expect to find anything ‘avant-garde’. Within the Arensberg circle, Boston and Pennsylvania were thought of as opposites (see Mina Loy’s compilation of overheard conversation there in The Blindman 2, p.15, and see note 16 below). Even according to Harper’s Magazine, at that time, ‘The one thing unforgivable in Philadelphia is to be new, to be different from what has been’ (quoted in R.F. Weighley et al.: Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, New York and London 1983, p.535, cited in https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/History_of_Philadelphia, accessed 12th November 2019).\n\n9 Cited in J. Spalding and G. Thompson: ‘Who did it? Not Duchamp!’, The Jackdaw (hereafter Jackdaw 2015), 4th September 2015, http://www.thejackdaw.co.uk/ wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Duchamp­Fountain-II1.pdf, p.22. See also note 22.\n\n10 Gammel, op.cit. (note 6), p.446, note 53.\n\n11 Jackdaw 2015, p.6. Concerning this label, Spalding and Thompson, who assert that the true title of this work by the Baroness should be ‘Urinal’ (op.cit. p.16), repeatedly state (op.cit. pps.6, 7, 23 and elsewhere) that it does not bear the title Fountain, and that this title was only given to the sculpture afterwards by Duchamp or Stieglitz. This is vital to Spalding and Thompson’s account, due to the importance given, in the editorial by Barbara Wood in The Blindman 2, to the act of re-naming the object, so as to give it a new conceptual context. Thus if the object was not re-named, it could not be by Duchamp. Recent scans of the photograph, however, allow one to read the last 5 letters of the word “Fountain” on the first line of the label (for example in Stefan Banz: Marcel Duchamp: Richard Mutt’s Fountain, Les Presses du Réel, 2019, p.43).\n\n12 He was eminently capable of this, as shown by his work Cheque Tzanck (1919; Israel Museum, Jerusalem).\n\n13 Camfield, op.cit. (note 2), p.30, and Jackdaw 2015, p.6.\n\n14 Jackdaw 2015, p.17.\n\n15 Spalding and Thompson, op. cit. (note 1), an assertion repeated in Jackdaw 2015, p.11.\n\n16 In Jackdaw 2015, p.7, Spalding and Thompson assume (without giving any evidence) that it was Duchamp who told Stieglitz this story, which would in fact strengthen the case that this was what he told everyone not directly involved, including his sister. Alternatively, Stieglitz might have been “in” on the affair and so was simply repeating the “story” to O’Keefe. It is also interesting that the article by McBride, following the letter from Demuth, mentions the Philadelphia connection. Demuth, a lifelong Pennsylvanian, was therefore involved with press relations on this matter and so may be the original source of this witticism.\n\n17 Tomkins, op. cit. (note 2), p.181.\n\n18 [editorial]: ‘How Duchamp stole the urinal’, Scottish Review of Books, 4th November 2014, available at https:// http://www.scottishreviewofbooks. org/2014/11/how-duchamp-stole-the­urinal/, accessed 12th November 2019. This is a longer version of Spalding and Thompson, op. cit. (note 1).\n\n19 See Camfield, op. cit. (note 2), p.22.\n\n20 Jackdaw 2015, p.11. So far as we are aware. In Spalding and Thompson’s version of events, it was the Baroness, in Philadelphia, who signed this object (op.cit. p.6), and she would have had to go to a great deal of trouble in order to do so. Why then would she have signed it using an unidentifiable hand (that avoids her characteristic rounded ‘M’)? Whereas Duchamp had a reason to disguise his handwriting, the Baroness did not, because even if she had wanted to remain anonymous, for unexplained reasons, no one would have recognised her handwriting.\n\n21 Ibid., p.27.\n\n22 Spalding and Thompson, op. cit. (note 1). Elsewhere they devote many pages to speculative interpretations of ‘Elsa’s’ urinal.\n\n23 Spalding and Thompson admit this unreliability in Jackdaw 2015, p.22, specifically in relation to the claim that the artist was from Philadelphia. They write: “Whilst the journalist’s report contained some inaccuracies they were not sufficient to discredit the veracity of other details confirmed by other secondary sources at the time, such as Beatrice Wood’s diary.” This convenient opinion is not at all supported by Beatrice Wood’s diary (online at Archives of American Art, Beatrice Wood papers), which does not mention either Philadelphia or the journalist, and the only “details” in her very brief diary entries are those cited in note 4, none of which help confirm significant “details” of the exhibition in a way that confirms this journalist’s reliability. This is a remarkably vague sentence, all in all, we are told that some unspecified details are verified by some unspecified sources, and this is supposed to reassure us of the reliability of a journalist who makes several blatant errors and has obviously been strung along by one of Duchamp’s associates (there never was a work by him called Tulip Hysteria Co-ordinating!). The “secondary sources”, being unidentified, cannot be checked, and the one which can be, does not refer to the matter in question. Thus Spalding and Thompson, having admitted the journalist’s account is not dependable, then appear to validate it, but when their evidence is checked it is found to be either irrelevant or cannot be checked. Since this is the only tenuous link between the Baroness and Fountain that Spalding and Thompson have discovered, the fact that they fail to show that its source is reliable is important! But not only is it unreliable, it is not even a serious account of the exhibition. We give it here in full (from the New York Herald, 11 April 1917, section 2, p.6):\n\nMr. Mutt Thought He Could Exhibit Almost Anything, but the Society Thought Differen"
