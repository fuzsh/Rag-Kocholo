        "text": "Like anything else that can be copyrighted, artwork is protected by copyright when the art is affixed in a tangible form (such as a painting, sculpture, or drawing). You have to register your copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office if you want to be able to take infringers to court and be awarded damages.\n\nArtwork is copyrightable if it meets the following criteria:\n\nIt must be your original work: it must originate with you and show some minimal amount of creativity.\n\nIt must be fixed in a tangible object, such as paper, a canvas, or a digital medium. It cannot merely be an idea for a work of art.\n\nArtwork does not need to have artistic merit to receive copyright protection.\n\nIf artwork is contained in a “useful article,” the artistic elements of the article can receive copyright protection, but the utilitarian aspects may not. For example, if you design a lamp with a sculpture in its base, the sculpture can be copyrighted, but the utilitarian aspects of the lamp cannot.\n\nIf you buy a piece of artwork, you will own the art, but you will not own the copyright to it unless the artist has specifically transferred the copyright to you.\n\nWhen does copyright protection begin?\n\nYou have a copyright in your artwork as soon as it has been created and fixed in a tangible object. It does not need to be registered with the copyright office or have a copyright notice attached to receive copyright protection. A copyright lasts for the life of the artist, plus 70 years after the artist’s death.\n\nRights conferred by copyright\n\nThe owner of the copyright in a piece of artwork has the exclusive right to make copies, to sell or distribute copies, to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted artwork, and to publicly display the artwork.\n\nTypes of artwork that can be copyrighted\n\nMany types of artwork are entitled to copyright protection, including:\n\nArtwork that is applied to fabric, T-shirts, or other clothing\n\nDecals and stickers\n\nCartoons and comic strips\n\nCollages\n\nDrawings, paintings, and murals\n\nGreeting cards, postcards, and stationery\n\nJewelry designs\n\nPatterns and kits for sewing, knitting, crochet, and needlework\n\nOriginal prints and posters\n\nSculpture\n\nWhy should you register your copyright?\n\nYou don’t have to register your copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office to receive copyright protection. However, registration has several important advantages:\n\nRegistration establishes a record of your copyright ownership.\n\nYou must register before you can sue someone for copyright infringement.\n\nIf you register your copyright within three months of publication or before an infringement occurs, you are entitled to statutory damages and your legal fees in a copyright infringement lawsuit. Statutory damages allow you to recover money without proving the monetary value of your loss or the infringer’s profits.\n\nIf you register your copyright, you can also register with the U.S. Customs Service to receive protection against imports of infringing copies.\n\nCopyright registration procedures and deposit requirements\n\nThe U.S. Copyright Office requires you to submit three things to register a copyright:"
