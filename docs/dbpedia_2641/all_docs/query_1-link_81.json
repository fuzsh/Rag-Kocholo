        "text": "As more information surfaces to verify a love affair between Marcel Duchamp and Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, the author adduces further evidence in support of his biographical readings of both the \"Large Glass\" and \"Etant donnes.\"\n\nI will never forget my first viewing of the Etant donnes, which took place in the fall of 1969, a few months after it had been placed on public view in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. I was an undergraduate art student at the time, completing a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in painting, but I had developed a keen interest in Duchamp and his work while still in high school. Over the years, I had kept up with much of the literature on the artist, and I fancied myself a minor specialist in his work. I had carefully pored over Arturo Schwarz's catalogue raisonne when it first appeared in 1968, and had been to see the works by Duchamp in the museum, so I knew my way around the galleries.\n\nAt a certain point, I noticed an opening in the wall at the end of a gallery, a feature I did not recall having seen before. I entered the room with some trepidation. It was dimly lit, and a carpet that covered the floor (in contrast to the bare floors of the surrounding galleries) gave me the impression that I was entering a space that was private, a room reserved, perhaps, for museum staff or trustees. But as my eyes adjusted, I saw an old wooden door with bricks around it and, almost immediately, observed two brightly lit holes in its center. I approached with caution, leaned forward, looked into the two holes, and the shock was immediate.\n\nI suppose my first sensation was some sort of physical reaction to seeing such an unexpected view of a nude female body. I can't imagine now that, even for a moment, I thought the figure was an actual human being--real flesh and blood--who somehow happened to be mysteriously sprawled in this bizarre position. Once I realized that it was artifice, my mind raced to think of who the artist might be. At first, I considered the possibility that it was the work of a superrealist sculptor, someone who cast body parts in resin and painted them, as I had done experimentally with friends in college (it would still be a few years before I saw the clothed, lifelike figures of Duane Hanson, or the deftly painted nudes of John de Andrea).\n\nI walked over to a label on the wall of the gallery, and saw that the tableau had an elaborate title in French, with an English translation provided below: Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas. At the top of the label, however, there was no artist's name, which meant either that the museum forgot to provide one (unlikely), or--and this really began to concern me now--that like everything else in the gallery, it was by Duchamp.\n\nAt first, I was hesitant to jump to such a rash conclusion. The implications were more than I was ready to accept, so I walked out of the room and questioned a guard. He assured me that the work was by Duchamp, whereupon I walked back into the room, approached the door and again peered into the two holes.\n\nA flood of additional questions rushed through my mind. What exactly was this thing supposed to mean? How did it relate to the work by Duchamp that I already knew? Certainly the trilogy of erotic objects--Female Fig Leaf (1950), Objet-Dard (1951) and Wedge of Chastity (1954), which I had seen reproduced in the Schwarz catalogue--had some bearing on this work. But at the time, I had no real interest in such an analytical approach. That would all change when my life's desire to become a famous artist ended a few years later, upon receipt of an M.F.A. degree in painting (for me, a terminal degree in every respect).\n\nThe study of art history in a Ph.D. program took up the better part of the next 15 years. Though I did what was necessary to fulfill the requirements for that degree, nearly every paper that I wrote was fueled by my interest in Duchamp, as were the books and articles that followed. In all of those writings, however--except in a rather superficial, summary fashion--I managed to avoid any direct discussion of the Etant donnes. That is, until now. And even here, I do not intend to present a scholarly analysis of the work itself, but rather a more personal view of its history, along with an account of just what it was that occurred in Duchamp's life that caused this particular work to come into being, and how I came to discover some of the materials that made this information available to me.\n\nIn 1993--25 years after my first viewing of the Etant donnes--I wrote a long review of the last great Duchamp retrospective, held at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, an article that appeared in these pages.(1) The title selected for my essay (which was added by the magazine's editors) was \"The Bachelor's Quest.\" As a brief summary below the title accurately stated, I intended to \"reveal some hitherto unpublished biographical facts\" about the artist and to present \"some speculations about the relationship between Duchamp's private life and the sexual themes of his work.\" Not only had I been eager to review the exhibition, but I wanted to seize the opportunity to present some crucial information about the artist that was missing from the otherwise comprehensive chronological survey presented in the catalogue, the so-called \"Ephemerides\" compiled by Jennifer Gough-Cooper and Jacques Caumont.(2) The facts I wished to reveal were two: (1) that Duchamp had fathered a child in 1911, which I linked to the making of the most intricate and ambitious work of his early career, The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (or the Large Glass); and (2) that he subsequently carried on a secret love affair with the Brazilian sculptor Maria Martins, which I linked to the making of the most elaborate and involved work of his later life, the Etant donnes.\n\nWhen the manuscript for my review was ready for publication, I sent a copy to Duchamp's widow, Alexina Duchamp, known to friends as Teeny. If she objected to anything I had written, my assumption was that she would write and let me know. In a characteristically Duchampian fashion, she never replied, expressing neither her approval nor disapproval. Nevertheless, when the article appeared, I was chastised by a number of Duchamp scholars for my indiscretions. I was even accused of having written about Duchamp's sex life, which could not have been further from the truth. At the time, the only fact I knew about his \"sex life\" was something that I omitted from my article, and that was a comment made by the ceramist Beatrice Wood (a longtime friend and erstwhile lover of Duchamp) when I once mustered the courage to ask her how he was in bed. She responded with a tribute that, in my opinion, would be the envy of any sensitive and caring man. \"All I can remember,\" she said, \"is that Marcel was as gentle in bed as he was out of it.\"(3)\n\nOn a trip to France a few years later, I visited Teeny at her home in Villiers-sous-Grez, near Paris, where, as on many previous occasions, we engaged in a friendly game of chess (she was a very strong opponent). While playing, I took the opportunity to ask if she minded the fact that I had written about Maria Martins. She responded: \"I don't care what you write about Marcel, if it concerns events in his life before I became part of it.\"\n\nWhen I presented my article for publication, I made only one request of the magazine's editors: that they consider reproducing Duchamp's Paysage fautif (Wayward or Faulty Landscape) on the cover, a work from 1946 that Duchamp mounted into the lid of a Valise (his ingenious portable museum) and gave to Martins in 1946.(4) The existence of this work had been revealed only a few years earlier when it was included in an exhibition devoted to Fountain (Duchamp's famous urinal) organized by William Camfield for the Menil Foundation in Houston.(5) Although the work was reproduced in the catalogue for that exhibition, its medium was still unknown. On a day when the museum was closed, the work was brought by the curators to an FBI laboratory located (conveniently) across the street from the museum; forensic analysis determined that it was made entirely with seminal fluid. This intriguing information was published for the first time in Ecke Bonk's important and definitive book, Marcel Duchamp: The Box in a Valise, which was released only a few months after the catalogue of the Menil exhibition appeared.(6) Since Paysage fautif was such a profoundly intimate artifact, which Duchamp gave as a private gift to Martins, my interest in the nature of his relationship with her was naturally piqued. In the end, for whatever reason, the editors did not think this particular image was a candidate for the cover, but I was grateful that it was reproduced full page and in color within the article itself.\n\nAfter Teeny's death in 1995, I made an effort to find out more about the two events in Duchamp's private life that I had written about. An earlier attempt to establish contact with his daughter had been stopped in its tracks by Caumont and Gough-Cooper, who were the first Duchamp scholars to discover the existence of this illegitimate child, today a veteran painter still living and working in Paris.(7) I am not providing her name now (although it is known to many Duchamp scholars); as I can well understand, she does not want to be remembered solely as the daughter of Marcel Duchamp. The letter I sent to her was returned to me by Caumont, saying that any questions I might have for her should be directed to him. With this filtration system--which, apparently, met with her approval (since she forwarded my letter to him)--I decided that I should not bother her again.\n\nMy preoccupation with Maria Martins was quite another matter. At first, however, given the flak I had received for my Palazzo Grassi article, I announced (to anyone who followed my scholarly activities) that I had abandoned my interest in Martins and her relationship with Duchamp. But the truth was that I simply could not get the pair out of my mind. Soon a professional activity in which I had become increasingly engaged--the organization of exhibitions, both for museums and galleries--led me once again to the subject of Martins. In 1997, I proposed a showing of her Surrealist sculpture at the Andre Emmerich Gallery, which had been recently taken over by Sotheby's.(8) When the gallery responded positively, I immediately made plans to travel to Brazil to find out as much as I could about the artist and her work for a catalogue to accompany the exhibition. Several years earlier, when I was preparing the Palazzo Grassi article, I had established contact with one of the two surviving daughters of Martins, Nora Lobo, who was living in Sao Paulo. I knew that Duchamp had given her mother a deluxe example of the Valise--one with an original work of art mounted into its cover (Paysage fautif); I also knew that this Valise was by then in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Toyama, Japan. I asked Mrs. Lobo if she knew whether or not Duchamp had also given her mother a copy of the so-called Green Box, a multiple which contains his notes for the Large Glass, and, if so, whether it was a regular or deluxe example, the latter of which would have contained an original note.(9) At the time, personal events in Mrs. Lobo's life prevented her from providing an immediate response, but a few years later, she responded in the affirmative--she did indeed have a Green Box. Since the box is filled with quite accurate facsimiles, however, she was unable to determine if it contained anything \"original.\"\n\nIn the winter of 1997-98, I visited Nora Lobo at her home in Sao Paulo, and after a brief exchange, she asked if I wanted to see the Green Box which I had inquired about. Naturally, I was quite anxious to see it, since I assumed it contained an original note. It was clear from the condition of its exterior that the box had not been accorded any special value by her mother; the metal \"M\" on the cover was missing a small piece, and the \"D\" on the verso was loose and beginning to become detached. But when I opened the box, everything appeared intact. I explained to Mrs. Lobo that an original note was supposed to be enclosed in every deluxe box, usually attached to its facsimile by means of a paper clip. From my experience in having examined other deluxe examples of the Green Box, I learned that even if these two elements had become detached, a telltale mark of the paper clip was usually still visible. I was turning each page carefully, hoping to discover the original, when, about halfway through the pile, I came upon a copy of The Blind Man, the second issue of a Dada magazine that, in 1917, Duchamp edited with Beatrice Wood and Henri-Pierre Roche (more than anything else, this particular issue was dedicated to defending the artistic status of Fountain).\n\n\"What is this doing in here?\" I asked Mrs. Lobo. \"This isn't supposed to be here.\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" she replied. \"You're the Duchamp expert, not me.\"\n\nIf this was the original item Duchamp had placed in the box, I was willing to accept it, although I must confess to having been somewhat disappointed. Naturally, I was hoping to find something as important as Paysage fautif, and this was just an ordinary magazine--a rare one, admittedly, but already well known in the general literature on Duchamp and Dada. Nevertheless, I still wondered what it was doing in the box. Was a copy simply lying about, which Duchamp casually picked up and placed in this particular example of the box? Knowing that nothing in this artist's work was ever left entirely to chance (except, of course, those works deliberately fabricated by chance means), I embarked upon a few quick speculations. Since I knew Duchamp's love affair with Martins was conducted in secrecy, could it be that The Blind Man was an intentional reference to Carlos Martins, the husband of Maria, who was \"blind\" to her affair? Or, an even more provocative possibility, could it have been a more self-referential gesture? Was Duchamp so blinded by his love for Maria, that, in this particular case, he saw himself as \"the blind man?\"\n\nI let that question drop as I pushed on in my search, slowly and carefully turning each piece of paper, my disappointment gradually increasing until--as I approached the bottom of the pile--something unexpected came into view: a large, rather thick piece of white drawing paper that was folded in half but bore on one side a handwritten inscription in sharp black ink:\n\npour Maria, enfin arrivee. Marcel Duchamp Paris 1946.\n\nWhen I considered how this inscription should be translated, I began: \"For Maria, finally arrived,\" by which I understood that the box had finally arrived. Nora Lobo, who speaks French fluently and at one time worked as a professional translator, interrupted.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" she said, \"arrivee\" must refer to Maria, not the box. It means `For Maria, [who has] finally arrived.'\"(10)\n\nAt first, I pondered, \"Arrived from where? Since it was inscribed \"Paris,\" had she just come from New York? Maybe, but when I opened the sheet of paper, I understood immediately what Duchamp had intended: there in my hands was a large preliminary drawing for the Large Glass, to which were attached by clear adhesive tape two notes: one in the lower-left corner that was four pages in length, and another at the top that read simply: \"Les couleurs, c'est bon a etre collectionne.\"\n\nThe person who had finally arrived, was, of course, Maria, Duchamp's \"mariee,\" the Bride of the Large Glass, the mythic woman of his dreams, who had, for her entire existence, been pursued by a suite of bachelors, of which, of course, Duchamp--who was 59 years old in 1946--was himself still one. After many years, his bride had finally arrived--that is to say, arrived in his life.\n\nAs I stood examining the drawing, Mrs. Lobo remarked: \"Why Mr. Naumann, you're shaking.\" To which I responded, \"You're damn right I am. This is the single most important work by Duchamp that I've ever held in my hands.\"\n\nIndeed, although another sketch for the Large Glass does exist, as I have argued elsewhere, I believe that it was traced from this one, which would make this drawing the only surviving preliminary sketch for the Large Glass.(11) Moreover, we must recall that when Duchamp gave this particular Green Box to Martins, the edition had been available for 12 years, having appeared in Paris in 1934. But the note that he attached to the lower-left corner--which concerns itself with the sexual mechanics of the Large Glass--was not included in the earlier publication. So at the time he gave it to Martins, it was completely unknown. Its contents would remain a secret that Duchamp guarded to the end of his life. Even when additional notes were published by the Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery in 1967--some of which pertain to the Large Glass--a draft of this particular note, which remained in Duchamp's possession, was intentionally withheld from publication.(12)\n\nMight Duchamp have considered the contents of this note too obscure, something that would mislead potential interpreters of the Large Glass? It was, after all, a note that he could easily omit from the publication, since it dealt with aspects of how the work \"functioned,\" elements that were never rendered visible within the glass itself. But I suspect there is a more likely explanation. He probably found the contents of this note too explicitly sexual for publication yet, at the same time, perfectly suitable for a woman with whom he had already shared the most intimate of intimacies. Whatever his reasons, since Duchamp clearly declined the opportunity to make the contents of this note public (and, as I have pointed out, he had two separate opportunities to do so in his lifetime), what exactly is it in this note--it is reasonable to ask--that he deemed so private, so personal?\n\nIt would be a couple of years before I had the opportunity to decipher the note's contents carefully. It was probably written in 1913--that is to say, some 30 years before Duchamp met Martins--when, at age 26, he was compiling notes for the creation of the most ambitious work of his early career, The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even. The note is actually a transcription of information worked out in seven separate earlier notes, documents that were in Duchamp's possession at the time of his death and published posthumously by his stepson, Paul Matisse.(13)\n\nThe seven earlier notes were executed on five separate pieces of paper (two having been written on the recto and verso of the same sheet), and all deal with various aspects of the liquefaction of Illuminating Gas, that vaporous substance that took on the shape of the Bachelors and solidified (as Duchamp says) \"through the phenomenon of stretching in the unit of length\" as it entered the \"capillary tubes,\" nine lines clearly visible on the surface of the glass emanating from the heads of each Bachelor. The elaborate process that follows--which was eventually abandoned for a more simplified system--deals with what happens to the solidified gas after this point, as it travels through what Duchamp calls (at the very beginning of the later four-page note) \"tubes of erotic concentration\" in the \"die of eros.\"\n\nTo get an idea of what Duchamp might have found so intimate about this note--which Linda Henderson, author of the most thorough study of the Large Glass and its scientific sources, recently described as nothing short of \"a coded love letter\"(14)--we need only analyze its contents. The scientific terms that Duchamp uses--as well as the diagrams that accompany them--are a thinly disguised anatomy lesson, but in this case, one for a mechanized bachelor, who, nonetheless--like his human counterpart--is equipped with internal organs and tubes designed to transport erotic liquids through his body. The Bachelors, Duchamp writes, \"respond to all of the questions of love with a sparking brutality,\" their \"inaccessible request\" responded to only by a mirror that reflects \"back to them their own complexity, deluding them fairly onanistically.\" Since they cannot attain immediate satisfaction from the Bride (the liquefaction process is doubtless a metaphor for the production of semen), they must seek at least temporary relief from their sexual frustrations without any assistance from her.\n\nAs if in an effort to reinforce the theme of frustration, Duchamp describes the Bachelors as being tortured like Tantalus, the King of Lydia in Greek mythology. Tantalus not only murdered his son, but, according to some versions of the myth, was guilty of revealing the secrets of the gods to mankind. His punishment was to stand forever up to his neck in a pool of water which receded from him whenever he tried to drink. Above his head hung branches bearing fruit that blew aside whenever he tried to grasp them. He was thus tantalized by their proximity as he suffered eternal hunger and thirst.\n\nOn the last page of this note, Duchamp visualizes three mechanical devices that facilitate the liquefaction process: a triturator, a condenser and a churn. Of the three elements, the triturator--which, traditionally, is a mechanism used to pulverize a solid in order to enhance its solution in a liquid--is the most erotically charged. To my eyes, it resembles a diagram of the male reproductive organs, and, more specifically, one that traces the flow of semen from the testes to the penis, here represented metaphorically by an inverted bottle, from which emerges an arrow labeled \"vers liquefacteur\"--which can be translated as \"toward condenser.\" The condenser is, basically, a filter, which at this point Duchamp describes as being triangular in shape and consisting of separate sheets punctured with holes that become increasingly smaller in size. In order to draw the liquid through the condenser, Duchamp devises a baratte, or churn, which rotates and creates suction, thereby helping to draw the liquid through the filter.\n\nAlthough Duchamp later insisted that the Large Glass was not autobiographical, he was himself a bachelor at the time of its creation, and like the Bachelors of the Large Glass, he simply could not attain some of the objects of desire in his life (not least among them the woman--already married--who bore him a child two years before this note was written). When he gave this note to Martins 30 years later, a similar situation may well have presented itself. By then, Martins had probably made it clear to Duchamp that she could never marry him. Not only was he unable to make her a permanent part of his life (she was unwilling to abandon her husband and children), but, worse, he would never be able to possess her emotionally.\n\nIn 1946--the year that Duchamp gave Martins her deluxe Green Box and Valise--their love affair must have been in its most intense phase. They had probably met three or four years earlier, at various gatherings in New York of the European Surrealists, many of whom spent the war years in America. Andre Breton later recalled having seen Martins's work for the first time at the Valentine Gallery in the spring of 1943, and since that exhibition was shared with Mondrian--whom Duchamp knew--we can be relatively safe in assuming that both Duchamp and Martins attended the opening.(15) Indeed, it was from this show that Martins purchased Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie, which, upon the close of the exhibition, she donated to the Museum of Modern Art. Her affair with Duchamp continued in secrecy until 1950, when she returned permanently to Brazil.\n\nTo this day, Martins is remembered by her daughters as a classic femme fatale, a woman who did whatever she needed to get men to fall in love with her, while never falling in love herself. That way, she could exercise control over the relationship, a position she would protect at any cost (she reportedly became extremely jealous if these men demonstrated the slightest degree of affection for another woman).(16) To get an idea of the kind of relationship that may have existed between Duchamp and Martins, we can examine a poem that she wrote on a scrap of paper in the mid-1940s, a document which I also discovered during my trip to Brazil (in the home of another Martins relative). This poem, which was written in French, may not have been intended for Duchamp, but given the date, it could have been; in any case, it provides an indication of how she felt about someone she was intensely involved with.\n\nEven long after my death Long after your death I want to torture you. I want the thought of me to coil around your body like a serpent of fire without burning you. I want to see you lost, asphyxiated, wander in the murky haze woven by my desires. For you, I want long sleepless nights filled by the roaring tom-tom of storms Far away, invisible, unknown. Then, I want the nostalgia of my presence to paralyze you.(17)\n\nAn equally powerful message about male-female relationships is given visual form in a sculpture that Martins made in the mid-1940s. The sculpture consists of two figures facing one another, the one on the left male, and the one on the right female. Although the female figure's arms underwent several alterations as the sculpture progressed through a series of separate castings, the heads remained comparatively unchanged; whereas the male looks something like a jellyfish propelling away from the female, the female more nearly resembles the closing petals of a Venus's-flytrap. The sculpture is titled Impossible, suggesting further that the conjunction of these two figures--either physically or emotionally--is ill-fated.\n\nExactly what Duchamp thought about this particular work is unknown. On visits to her New York studio--located on the fifth floor of a building on Park Avenue at 58th Street--he would have seen a version of Impossible, as well as examples of other sculptures that she was working on at the time. In a photo of Martins in her studio, viewers will notice that mounted on the wall directly behind her head appears a framed photograph of Duchamp. Based on the works visible in this photograph (Impossible is near the window), we can establish that it was taken just before her fourth (and last) exhibition at the Valentine Gallery in New York, which was held in the spring of 1946; many of the works that appear in this image were included in that show.(18)\n\nEven though her 1946 exhibition at the Valentine Gallery was called \"New Sculptures,\" Martins showed a number of earlier works, including two that are remarkable for certain affinities with the Etant donnes (which, it is worth noting, Duchamp conceived in the same year as Martins's show). The first sculpture, Don't Forget I Come from the Tropics, dates from 1942; the second, Glebe-Ailes (Earthly Wings), dates from 1944. Both are depictions of headless, nude female figures lying on their back, their arms raised upward. Sexual identity is revealed only in the form of breasts; the backs of both figures are slightly arched, as if to suggest that they are writhing in pain. Five flamelike projections emerge from the belly of one, while a full-grown male head with wings emerges from the other.\n\nIt may have been coincidental, but when Duchamp made his first sketch of the Etant donnes, the female figure was depicted lying on her back, her identity intentionally withheld from the viewer, since her features are not visible within the image. However, the central focus of this sketch is not on the woman's abdomen, but rather on the vagina, the place from which life emerges. In this respect, in his sketch Duchamp indirectly refers to the birth process that seems to be taking place in Martins's two sculptures, as well as, perhaps, the point of origin for the pain they are depicted as expressing.\n\nOf course, what I am suggesting here is something that few have ventured to consider a possibility in analyzing the late work of Marcel Duchamp: that he might have been influenced by the work of another artist.(19)\n\nAfter I had carefully examined the Green Box at the home of Nora Lobo in Sao Paulo, she asked if I wanted to see a photograph of the Etant donnes that I had asked her about in correspondence. In all the excitement, I had completely forgotten about this item, but about a year earlier, I had written to Mrs. Lobo and asked if she could tell me more about an intriguing photograph that had appeared--fleetingly--in a television documentary titled \"The Secret of Marcel Duchamp,\" devoted to the subject of Duchamp's relationship with Martins, made in 1997 by Chris Granlund of the BBC. When I saw this image, I immediately wrote to the BBC asking for a copy print and, with Mrs. Lobo's permission, I published it in a review that I also wrote for this magazine of Arturo Schwarz's revised catalogue raisonne.(20)\n\nIn my description of this photograph, I speculated that it records the image of a plaster cast of the nude female figure used in the making of the Etant donnes, namely, Maria Martins. To date, there is no hard evidence to prove that her body was actually cast by Duchamp. However, since the final work is realized on a human scale, it would seem logical that he used this more expedient process, if not for the entire body, at least for select details. I stated that the photograph must have been taken shortly after Duchamp began work on this project in 1946, but before he started experimenting with the process of applying leather over the plaster form. I also pointed out how the left arm differed from the final form of the Etant donnes, for it is fully extended, and clenched in its hand appears some sort of small cylindrical form. I suggested that the hand in this plaster was probably the model for Duchamp's Reflection a main, a drawing that he made in 1948 and mounted into the lid of yet another deluxe Valise that he gave to friends living in Switzerland.(21)\n\nIf we examine Reflection a main, we will see that held firmly in a woman's hand is an actual looking glass facing away from her, meaning that anyone who looks at the image sees his or her reflection. Although I have yet to see this stated in any of the literature on the Etant donnes, this work suggests that at one point Duchamp might have considered the possibility of placing a mirror in the hand of the figure in his full-scale tableau. I know that some may disagree with this reasoning, since he had already determined that the title of his work would be Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas, and we could rightly ask, if he used a mirror-rather than a gas lantern, as he did in the final tableau--then where had he planned to represent the \"illuminating gas?\" One possible answer is that he might have intended to depict it in some other form, either as a gas lantern mounted elsewhere in the environment, or simply as light coming from a source not visible to the viewer but its reflection (by means of the mirror) very much in evidence. The reason a mirror makes sense in this context is because--as Duchamp wrote in the note he gave to Martins--the Bachelors respond to all questions of love with a mirror that reflects \"back to them their own complexity, deluding them fairly onanistically.\"\n\nThough I had published a copy print of this Etant donnes photograph in my review, I had never seen the original, and one thing in particular struck me when Mrs. Lobo showed it to me. The plaster figure appeared so lifelike that, at first, I thought it was an actual body cast (later I would learn that it was a sculpture Duchamp had based on an earlier plastiline model).(22)\n\nMrs. Lobo also showed me a group of about 30 letters which Duchamp had written to her mother. I was allowed to read them and take some notes, but she did not permit me to make photocopies, for she believes the information they contain is still too personal and private for publication. Even a quick read, however, made it clear that Duchamp had fallen desperately in love with her mother. Among other things, the letters contain periodic reports on the making of the Etant donnes, which Duchamp refers to throughout as \"our\" sculpture, almost implying that it exists as a product of artistic collaboration. Perhaps fearing that his letters might be discovered, he refers to the work in a coded language that only Maria could understand: once he called it \"ma femme au chat ouvert\" [my woman with open pussy], and another time as \"N.D. des desires\" [our lady of desires].(23)\n\nTo me, the greatest surprise was to discover that the correspondence continued to the end of Duchamp's life, long after their affair was over and Martins had returned with her family to Brazil. But the tone of the later letters is formal and detached. By the fall of 1951, Duchamp had begun a more fulfilling and enduring relationship with Teeny, whom he married in 1954. From this point onward, when Marcel and Maria corresponded, it was not with the intention of rekindling the fires of their former romance, but rather a simple exchange between two old friends to relay information on their separate artistic activities.\n\nEven though Duchamp's affair with Martins was over, work on the Etant donnes continued, slowly and methodically, and always in secrecy, in the privacy of his 14th Street studio. Duchamp showed the work to his wife, who reportedly found the subject distasteful--even though she helped him with its assembly, served as a model for the figure's left arm (which was cast from hers), and later helped him gather twigs and dried foliage from the countryside for the background. Over the years, cryptic items that could later be recognized as spin-offs from this elaborate assemblage appeared: the three small erotic objects emerged in the early 1950s, but when they were exhibited, no one understood how they related to anything he had done, since nothing was known about the Etant donnes. Although Duchamp incorporated images that related to this project into the lids of his Valises, he gave these works as gifts to people who were either in on his secret, as in the case of Martins, or to individuals who would have been too discreet to question their origin or meaning, as in the example he gave to friends in Switzerland.\n\nIt is for this reason that I was quite excited a few months ago to have received a call from the Italian-American painter Enrico Donati, saying that in 1952 he had been given a leather Valise by Duchamp that contained an original drawing. I knew that Donati, who had helped Duchamp to paint and attach 1,000 foam-rubber falsies to the cover of a Surrealist exhibition catalogue in 1947, had gotten to know Duchamp fairly well. I also knew that, with his wife, Claire, Donati had participated in several excursions to visit friends outside New York with Duchamp and Martins.(24) Was it possible that the drawing he described related to the Etant donnes? I couldn't get to his studio fast enough.\n\nThe Valise did indeed contain an original drawing.(25) On a scrap of paper Duchamp made a detailed drawing of the underside of a human foot. I believe Martins posed for this drawing, and I believe it represents an alternate point of view that he had considered for the figure in the Etant donnes. I am fairly certain that a number of Duchamp scholars will disagree with my identification of this image, for my evidence that Martins served as its model is entirely circumstantial. There are those who will insist that it compares more convincingly with Duchamp's Torture-morte (1959, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris), a painted plaster cast of a foot to which Duchamp attached actual flies. But the drawing in the Donati Valise is dated 1946--that crucial year in Duchamp's relationship with Martins--a year before he made what is customarily identified as his first sketch for the Etant donnes, but the very year when he presented her with deluxe examples of his Valise and Green Box. Moreover, when Duchamp inscribed this Valise for Donati and his wife, he wrote \"voici une boite-temoin de notre amitie et de mon affection,\" making it clear that the Donatis were among the few of his friends who knew Martins, and, therefore, bore witness to his affair with her.(26)\n\nIf I am correct and this drawing does indeed depict Martins's foot, then it means that, initially, Duchamp may very well have considered an even more dramatic view, from a lower vantage point, of his \"woman with open pussy.\" To those familiar with Italian painting of the 15th century, the underside of a human foot may call to mind Mantegna's radically foreshortened body of the Dead Christ, with the soles of his bare feet directly facing the viewer (Brera, Milan), a strikingly sacrilegious comparison that is not likely something Duchamp intended. A more appropriate similarity of viewpoint can be established with Courbet's Origin of the World (Musee d'Orsay, Paris), a provocative, close-up crotch view of a woman's naked torso, or to a drawing Durer made of a recumbent woman to illustrate a device that can be used to achieve accurate foreshortening, comparisons that have already been made by a number of other art historians.(27)\n\nAt the very least, this drawing may shed light on the way the Etant donnes evolved over time. At first, Duchamp may have wanted to render the figure in relief, as is evidenced by another study for the work, one that he also gave to Martins and which is now in the collection of the Moderna Museet, Stockholm. Eventually the viewer's position was lowered--not to the point of showing the feet in dramatic foreshortening, as suggested by the drawing in the Donati Valise, but enough that viewers are forced to confront the intimate details of the figure's anatomy in a way that Duchamp clearly anticipated many would find disturbing.\n\nThe discovery of this drawing made me realize that ever since I had seen the Etant donnes for the first time some 30 years earlier, it had continued to reveal its secrets in periodic installments--fragments of information that Duchamp cleverly hid, but knew would be discovered and eventually revealed to the public (like the work itself) in the years after his death. The Valises served as ideal hiding places for these clues, for their contents were not likely to be closely examined until long after his death (which is precisely what occurred). Just as Duchamp described his Bride as \"a delay in glass,\" these secrets were carefully planted like artistic time capsules, to be unearthed and deciphered much later when he would no longer be around to explain their significance.\n\nMarcel and Maria met for the last time on March 10, 1966, when he was 77 years old and she 72 (although whenever she was questioned about her age, Maria claimed to be about 10 years younger, an exaggeration her youthful features allowed her to maintain throughout her life). On a trip to New York, Maria stayed at the home of Elba Sette Camara, wife of a Brazilian delegate to the United Nations. To mark the occasion, a tea was organized in Maria's honor, to which Marcel was invited, as were a number of old friends that Maria knew from her years in New York (including Alfred Barr, Jr., and James Johnson Sweeney of MOMA). According to a report filed by a Brazilian journalist who was also present, the group talked about the paintings that hung on the walls of the delegate's home, but nothing is known about any private conversation that might have taken place between Marcel and Maria. So far as we can tell, Marcel arrived at the party alone, and may very well have taken the opportunity to reminisce with Maria over old times. But there is no reason to imagine that their exchange differed in any significant way from the friendly and respectful tone reflected in their last letters.(28)\n\nIn the decade before his death, Duchamp became known primarily for his introduction of the readymade, \"a work of art,\" as he later explained it, \"without an artist to make it.\"(29) But the rigorous philosophical discourse engendered by the readymade, which underlies our understanding and acceptance of the readymade's profound esthetic implications, is a factor which Duchamp ingeniously combined with his view of eroticism, providing a unique twist to the celebrated mind/body equation. \"I want to grasp things with the mind,\" he told a young art history strident in the mid-1950s, \"the way the penis is grasped by the vagina.\"(30) Rarely would Duchamp be so blunt and forthcoming when referring to the sexual themes that permeate his work. He stated that, for him, eroticism was a subject worthy of being isolated and applied--like an artistic style--in the making of a work of art.\n\nIn an interview with the French writer Pierre Cabanne--which took place in Paris during the summer of 1966 (just a few months after Duchamp's last meeting with Martins)--Duchamp was asked to comment upon his fascination with eroticism. \"I believe in eroticism a lot,\" he explained, \"because it's truly a rather widespread thing throughout the world, a thing that everyone understands.\"(31) He admitted that eroticism had been part of his work for many years, but that he kept it intentionally hidden from public view. Although he goes on to say that these qualities were \"not disguised out of shame,\" he never tells us exactly why they were suppressed. He kept his response intentionally guarded and vague, knowing that it would still be some time before the Etant donnes was made public.\n\nWithin a few years, we would all know his secret.\n\nPortions of this article are derived from my paper, \"Marcel and Maria: Mind and Body Unite,\" presented as part of the symposium \"Contextualizing Marcel Duchamp,\" moderated by Molly Nesbit, Phyllis Wattis Distinguished Lecture Series, held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, April 30, 2000.\n\n(1.)

Of course, since the word arrivee is feminine, Duchamp could have been referring to la boite, but in order to come to such a conclusion, we would have to assume Maria had been waiting to receive one. This may have been the case, but it does not preclude Duchamp also referring to Maria, for such a double entendre would certainly have been in keeping with his penchant for wordplay. In the latter case, he might have meant that she had just arrived in Paris, where he had been for a few months (he arrived on May 9, 1946, she toward the end of June), but I believe his message was meant to carry a more profound meaning.\n\n(11.)

The original manuscript was written on a single sheet of paper and was found in a boxed portfolio of engravings published by the Valentine Gallery in New York in 1946 (collection Katia Mindlin Leite Barbosa, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). This poem was published in translation in Francis M.

This does not mean that Martins could not have been influenced by Duchamp, which I believe was the case a few years later when she made one of the most powerful sculptures of her entire career: Huitieme Voile (Eighth Veil), 1949, a larger-than-life nude female figure, seated on a flat surface with her legs spread wide apart. Whereas the central torso is depicted with absolute precision, the figure's hands and feet are grotesquely distorted, as is the head. The piece relates to a work that Martins made a decade earlier, Salome (1939), which depicts the biblical character famous for her Dance of the Seven Veils, one of which is shown casually draped over her right thigh. No equivalent visual protection is given to the figure in Eighth Veil--nor, of course, is any provided for the figure in the Etant donnas. Although Salome no longer survives, a photograph was made and is preserved in a scrapbook Martins kept of her work from this period, which is in the collection of her daughter, Anna Maria Martins Turner, in Philadelphia. (For a reproduction, see Naumann, Maria Martins, p. 11.)\n\n(20.)

Duchamp gave this Valise to Henri and Helene Hoppenot. Hoppenot was a diplomat who, in the 1940s, served as French Ambassador to Switzerland. In the fall of 1946--the same year Duchamp gave Maria the deluxe Valise containing his Paysage fautif and only a few weeks after he had given her the deluxe Green Box in Paris, Duchamp visited the Hoppenots at their home in Bern, along with his longtime American friend, Mary Reynolds, who was a good friend of the Hoppenots. It was on this trip that Duchamp discovered in a nearby village the waterfall that would appear in the background of the Etant donnes.\n\n(22.) When Duchamp sent this photograph to Martins, he explained that he wanted to keep \"this unique attempt at direct sculpture\" [cette epreuve unique de sculpture directe] for her, because, \"as is already apparent on the photo\" that he is sending [car comme la photo le montre deja], \"it no longer has anything to do with the plastiline model\" that he had \"cast 6 months ago\" [elle n'a plus rien a fair avec le module en plastiline que j'ai fait mouler il y a 6 mois en plus].\n\nIt was in examining the photograph that I began to consider a question that--to my knowledge--had never been asked in the literature on the Etant donnas: why was the figure rendered without pubic hair? A careful examination of the plaster figure provides a tentative answer: to facilitate the casting process. Whereas body hair can be cast, the results are usually imperfect; the process usually necessitates covering the hair with a coat of Vaseline, or some other greasy substance, to prevent the plaster from adhering and becoming difficult to remove. It may have been Duchamp's intention to cast the body fully shaved and add artificial hair later (just as he did for the head of the figure), thereby more closely matching the impression given in his earlier sketch. But when he saw the final results, he may have decided that he liked the effect, and that it contributed to the shock he sought to produce in viewers seeing the work for the first time.\n\n(23.) These letters are still in the possession of Nora Lobo, and their publication has been strictly prohibited (see Francis M. Naumann, \"Introduction,\" Affectionately, Marcel, Ghent, Ludion, 2000, p. 9. The two quotations given here were published in Tomkins, Duchamp, p. 366.\n\n(24.) The Donatis' friendship with Duchamp and Martins is documented in a number of photographs taken during the mid-1940s; see, for example, those reproduced in Theodore F. Wolff, Enrico Donati: Surrealism and Beyond, New York, Hudson Hills, 1996, pp. 152-53.\n\n(25.) Donati's was not technically a deluxe Valise, since it was not among the first 20 in the Roman-numeral edition (see note 4 above). Nevertheless, it did contain a unique, original work.\n\n(26.) It could be argued that Duchamp was identifying the box as a witness to his friendship with Donati and his wife, as the remaining words in the inscription acknowledge, but I believe that because of the original drawing that he mounted into its lid, Duchamp also had in mind his love affair with Martins, which the Donatis were among the few to witness.\n\n(27.) See, for example, Jean Clair, \"Marcel Duchamp et la tradition des perspecteurs,\" in Clair, ed., Marcel Duchamp, Musee National d'Art Moderne, Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou, Paris, 1977, abecedaire, vol. III, p. 159; Clair, \"Sexe et topologie,\" p. 55; and Dalia Judovitz, \"Rendezvous with Marcel Duchamp: Given,\" in Francis M. Naumann and Rudolf E. Kuenzli, eds., Marcel Duchamp: Artist of the Century, Cambridge, MIT Press, 1990, pp. 190-91).\n\nThe relationship between Courbet's painting and Duchamp's tableau has been observed by many authors, not only those writing about Duchamp, but also those writing about Courbet (see, for example, Linda Nochlin's entry on this work in Sarah Faunce and Nochlin, Courbet Reconsidered, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 1988, p. 178). Whereas Duchamp would have had little opportunity to see Courbet's Origin of the World (after the Second World War the painting hung in the private study of Jacques Lacan's country house outside of Paris), most authors speculate that Duchamp may at least have seen photographs of it. We know for certain, however, that on a trip to the U.S. in 1933, Duchamp visited the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pa. (see Cooper and Caumont, \"Ephemerides,\" entry for 12/3/33), where he would have seen Courbet's Woman with White Stockings (1861), which depicts a woman in an outdoor setting putting on her stockings while she subtly reveals her naked lower anatomy to the viewer. In 1968, Duchamp produced an etching based on this image (see Arturo Schwarz, The Complete Works of Marcel Duchamp, New York, Delano Greenidge Editions, third revised and expanded edition, 1997, cat. no. 653, pp. 884-85).\n\n(28.) \"Duchamp e Heitor Coutinho,\" Correio da Manha [Rio de Janeiro], Mar. 10, 1966 (clipping preserved in the Artists' Files, Museum of Modern Art, Sao Paulo). An artist who was also present at the tea later reported the scene: Duchamp \"shows up, and just sits there, talking about things one talks about at tea. No one spoke of art, or about things which I imagined he might be interested in, not even Maria Martins.\" (Wesley Duke Lee, \"Duchamp,\" in Wesley Duke Lee, Sao Paulo, Instituto Brasileiro de Arte e Cultura, 1992, 2nd ed., pp. 12-14; this reference was drawn to my attention and translated for me by Oswaldo Costa).\n\n(29.) Quoted in Francis Roberts, \"I Propose to Strain the Laws of Physics,\"Art News, December 1968, p. 47.\n\n(30.) The statement was made in September 1956 to Lawrence D. Steefel, Jr., who was writing his dissertation on the Large Glass for Princeton University (see Steefel, The Position of Duchamp's Glass in the Development of His Art, New York, Garland, 1977, p. 312).\n\n(31.) The 1966 interview was published a year later; Pierre Cabanne, Entretiens avec Marcel Duchamp, Paris, Pierre Belfond, 1967. An English edition appeared three years later: Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp, trans. by Ron Padgett, New York, Viking Press, 1971, from which the present quotation is derived (see pp. 88-89).\n\n\"Marcel Duchamp on Display, \"featuring the Donati Valise and documentation of Duchamp's exhibition designs, can currently be seen at Zabriskie Gallery, New York [Mar. 22-May 5].\n\nAuthor: Francis M.
