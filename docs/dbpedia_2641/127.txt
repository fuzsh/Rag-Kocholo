In 1919 Marcel Duchamp created the Dadamasterwork and icon of 20th-century art when he drew a moustache and beard on a colour reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. He gave his creation the irreverent title L.H.O.O.Q., which, when spoken quickly,sounds like the French for ‘she has a hot ass’. During the course of Duchamp’s career he would re-visit this work several times and make copies or alterations. On this occasion it is seen on a playing card mounted on the preview dinner invitation for the exhibition entitled: Not Seen and/or Less Seen by Marcel Duchamp / Rrose Selavy organised by the Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery on 19 January 1965. Here, Duchamp has come full circle, shaving (rasée) his initial 1919 conception and leaving Mona Lisa as she was. One of about 100 copies, this invitation is addressed to Mr & Mrs Brian O’Doherty.
