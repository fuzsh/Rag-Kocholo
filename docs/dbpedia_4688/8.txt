The Kennington Bioscope is a regular cinema event featuring live accompaniment to silent films that takes place at the Cinema Museum.

The main feature is The Mating Call (1928), directed by James Cruze, produced by Howard Hughes and starring Thomas Meighan, Evelyn Brent and Renée Adorée. Long thought lost, the film was re-discovered in the archives of Howard Hughes memorabilia by curators at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and restored and re-released in 2006. Kevin Brownlow will be presenting this film, and curating the shorts programme before the feature.

Based on the novel by Rex Beach, The Mating Call is a 1928 pre-Code drama film about a First World War hero (Meighan) who returns home to find his marriage has been annulled and his wife (Brent) has remarried. The film reflects many of the societal issues that affected men and women following the end of the war.

A programme of silent shorts precedes the main film. Anyone interested in silent film should visit the website for more info.
