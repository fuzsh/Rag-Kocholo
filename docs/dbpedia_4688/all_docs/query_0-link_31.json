        "text": "Vienna-born, New York-raised Josef von Sternberg directed some of the most influential, stylish dramas ever to come out of Hollywood. Though best known for his star-making collaborations with Marlene Dietrich, von Sternberg began his career during the final years of the silent era, dazzling audiences and critics with his film's dark visions and innovative cinematography. The titles in this collection, made on the cusp of the sound age, are three of von Sternberg's greatest works, gritty evocations of gangster life (Underworld), the Russian Revolution (The Last Command), and working-class desperation (The Docks of New York) made into shadowy movie spectacle. Criterion is proud to present these long unavailable classics of American cinema, each with two musical scores.-Container\n\nAccompanying booklet to the collection, 3 silent classics by Josef von Sternberg, featuring essays by Geoffrey O'Brien, Anton Kaes, and Luc Sante. Includes notes on the scores by the composers, Ben Hecht's original story for Underworld, and an excerpt from von Sternberg's autobiography, Fun in A Chinese Laundry, on actor Emil Jannings."
