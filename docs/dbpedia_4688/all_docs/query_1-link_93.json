Historian David Pierce has concluded that only 26% of American silent features survive in complete form. Both TCM and the Academy Museum are dedicated to showcasing the films of this important period in filmmaking history as part of our cultural heritage. Taking place on Sundays at 2pm, Silent Sundays will showcase iconic movies from the silent era as well as forgotten gems and international classics.\n\nProgrammed by Bernardo Rondeau.\n\nNotes by Dorota Lech, K.J. Relth-Miller, and Robert Reneau."
