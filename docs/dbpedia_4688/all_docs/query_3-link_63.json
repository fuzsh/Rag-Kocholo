        "text": "In another time, the poster for\n\n\"The Legend of Tarzan\"\n\nwould have advertised\n\nAction! Drama! Romance!\n\nas its abundant exclamation-worthy elements. Although the real posters prominently feature a shirtless Alexander Skarsgard and CGI gorillas, I found the film pleasantly old-fashioned as long as I squinted a bit, blurring the profligate modern special effects and focusing on its retro tone and intent, its desire to deliver a pulpy adventure free of angst, apocalyptic hooey, superheroes or Ninja Turtles.\n\nFrankly, the current cinematic climate isn't quite right for such a throwback adventure, although Warner Bros. surely yanked the Lord of the Jungle out of mothballs hoping he'd inspire a new, lucrative series. I have my doubts. The cynic in me says today's audiences enthralled by serialized big-screen comic books and mega-franchises will scoff at Tarzan and his ability to mimic bird calls and summon wildebeest. But that same cynic was charmed by this new film, which offers more vine-swinging action and nasty hippo threats than we've seen at the movies in decades.\n\nSkarsgard plays Tarzan with a strong, silent charisma. He's kind of a stiff, but at least there's no pressure for him to crack wise at regular intervals. The film acquaints us to this extraordinary man not in the jungle, but in London, as Lord John Clayton, sipping tea with fellow aristocrats, albeit those of a more verbally vigorous persuasion. They want him to don his Tarzan cap and return to the colonialized Congo, where he'd investigate the unrest between African natives and European settlers. Accompanying him would be an American diplomat, George Washington Williams, a wily Civil War vet who's a deadeye shot with a rifle; he's played by Samuel L. Jackson, who's introduced loudly cracking walnuts, which seems about right.\n\nFILM REVIEW\n\n'The Legend of Tarzan'\n\n3 stars (out of 4)\n\nMPAA rating: PG-13 for sequences of action and violence, some sensuality and brief rude dialogue\n\nCast: Alexander Skarsgard, Margot Robbie, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson\n\nDirector: David Yates\n\nRun time: 109 minutes\n\nClayton/Tarzan is initially resistant, but eventually relents. He's uncomfortable in the Western world - he appears to be one pectoral flex away from bursting out of his double-breasted suit. Inevitably, Tarzan will gradually shed bits of clothing as the narrative progresses, therefore cutting a dashing figure, Skarsgard's upper body chiseled beyond all reason, the product of the Raised by Apes Diet and Workout Regime. If it weren't the 1880s, he'd be selling books and fitness videos on late-night infomercials.\n\nHis wife, Jane (Margot Robbie), wishes to join him on the trip - she, too, came of age in Africa, where her father taught English to friendly tribes (I assume that was part of a not-so-politically correct missionary and/or imperialist excursion, but never mind; it isn't addressed). He doesn't want to expose her to danger, and they verbally quarrel. They will eventually make up, and make out, barefoot, up in a tree, where they're obviously more at home than inside their dimly lit castle, an anti-jungle colored in cold gray and blue hues.\n\nDirector David Yates, alum of four \"Harry Potter\" features, lends some art to the proceedings, even though you'll never, ever take them too seriously. His mostly computer-generated Africa is a beautiful place where the savannah is golden, and the sunlight is golden, and Tarzan's lion pals are golden, and the flashbacks are a bit bleary and, yes, golden. Tarzan's origin story is a perfunctory element - arguably necessary for an audience perhaps unfamiliar with a character long out of the mainstream spotlight - but not the focus, dropped into the narrative here and there. It sticks with creator Edgar Rice Burroughs' story in which a human boy is raised in the wild by an adoptive gorilla mama, and eventually meets and falls in love with sweet, lovely Jane.\n\nYet the manner in which this version of Tarzan intrusively sniffs his future wife's various nooks upon first encountering her strikes me as a 21st-century enhancement. The scene is a hoot, as is another in which Tarzan lures Jane to bed with a series of animal mating calls. (Hey, whatever floats your boat, folks.) Their romance is a key element of the film, and hokey as it is, it goes down easy. Robbie provides color and moxie to the film - as does Jackson, who provides some similarly breezy comic relief - while Skarsgard smolders. Both are increasingly dampened as their dangerous adventure reaches the third act, and the only thing prettier than a distressed-but-not-dispirited Robbie is a shirtless and intense Skarsgard, his shoulder-length hair flowing majestically as he leaps from limb to limb.\n\nUpping the stakes is Christoph Waltz as the villain Leon Rom, who wields his rosary beads as a lasso-like weapon. Gotta love that irony. Like all 19th-century Caucasian capitalist powermongering jerks in Africa, he's pursuing diamonds and slaves. Rom brokers a deal to deliver Tarzan to Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who harbors an old grudge against our hero. In the grand tradition of tales such as this, Rom kidnaps Jane to lure in her hubby with the iconic feral howl. And in the grand tradition of many a Christoph Waltz role, he plays to evil type, his haughty civility unsettling beneath a smile as trustworthy as a politician's promise. But Jane refuses to play the old-school damsel, spitting in Rom's face and insulting his mustache. Harsh!\n\nThere's no arguing \"The Legend of Tarzan\" is a cornball enterprise, but oddly agreeable, especially in the context of any resistance to contemporary cinema trends. Sure, Skarsgard's Tarzan is puckered and wooden, the performance sometimes a pose looking for a soft spot to land. But the character is refreshing because he's not a powerful mutant or a Transformer or a dirty grandpa. The character rubs shoulders with elephants, leaps fearlessly off cliffs and fights like an ape. He's refreshingly regressive, and the film is propulsive and diverting. Add Fun! to that poster, and color me bemused."
