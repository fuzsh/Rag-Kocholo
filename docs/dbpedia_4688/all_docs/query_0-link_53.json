No other logo announces so vociferously the magic appearing on the silver screen. Established in ¡924, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios produced quality films on the cutting edge of technological progress, and produced them in great numbers. Louis B. Mayer liked to boast that his innovative film plant “had more stars than the heavens”— and the number of hits was at least equal to the number of stars. This book, however, tells the lesserknown story of an earlier film plant, the Balboa Amusement Producing Company. Instead of the roaring lion, Balboa’s logo portrayed the mute head of Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa, the discoverer of the Pacific Ocean. History has too often overlooked both silent and talking heads, especially those lost to the rapidly changing competition in movieland. The purpose of this book is to a›ord long-over-\n\ndue recognition to Balboa Studios, a film plant that eventually lost its lead to equally daring sailors of fortune in neighboring Los Angeles. “The winner take all” outcome typifies how unfairly renown may be bestowed to supposedly accredited contributors. For example, the prototype of modern film plants, Star Film, allowed its creator, Georges Méliès, to raise motion pictures to an art form by way of his technical innovations, production, and distribution planning, along with his marketing and magical skills; yet Méliès died, like too many pioneers, penniless and forgotten in the streets. Pathé Frères replaced Star Film as the premier film business across the globe until the Great War, eventually making Star Film’s prototype seem meaningless in comparison. Balboa Films is not only a story of the pioneering, glamorous, and risk-taking film plant in Long Beach, California. It is mostly about the unsung heroes — founders, artists, 1\n\n2\n\nPROLOGUE\n\ntechnicians, and businessmen who made the plant for five glorious years the most productive independent studio in the world, before there was even an establishment called Hollywood. Balboa Films also examines the innovations of the cameramen, directors, and writers at the studio. It provides an overdue explanation of Balboa’s significance and the reasons for its untimely demise. Finally, it explores the reasons why Long Beach seemed to take so little pride in the site before the movie studios closed their stages permanently in ¡923 and were demolished in ¡925 for subdivisions of the parcels. From the beginning, Long Beach o›ered an ideal setting for the movie industry. Enjoying a sunny seaside climate, the city was already a theatre town with a steady pool of talented actors, directors, and technicians. Along the Pike, there were eight film houses and two stock company theatres. As early as ¡908, Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle had been singing in Long Beach, and he even got married on stage that same year at the successful Byde a Whyle Theatre, an adjunct to the elegant and gigantic Hotel Virginia. Moreover, Long Beach enjoyed the busy commerce of its port and railway systems that made the city the fastest growing municipality in the United States of America. In ¡9¡0, Long Beach claimed only ¡7,000 inhabitants, but by ¡920 the city had grown to 56,000. Balboa Studios had become Long Beach’s biggest employer and biggest tourist attraction by ¡9¡7. From ¡9¡0 through ¡9¡3, at least two other film companies had preceded Balboa Studios in Long Beach, at the very same site. These companies changed hands many times from ¡9¡8 to ¡925. Overlooked by historians and ignored in the very town where so many quality movies were made between ¡9¡3 and ¡9¡8, Balboa Studios shone as a jewel of the silent era. Today, film bu›s the world over recognize the mighty roar of the MGM lion. MGM made history, and its contributions are properly documented and remembered. In contrast, the roar of Balboa was never heard. A studio that should have made history remains silent, like the movies produced there. Of the countless\n\nquality films produced at Balboa, the few that remain have been turning to dust as the result of nitrate decomposition and neglect. Unlike MGM’s well-preserved productions, Balboa’s films have nearly all been erased from our collective memory. Why? Movies at Balboa were also made big and done well. Like MGM, Balboa was productive and extravagant, boasting luminaries like Jackie Saunders, Ruth Roland, Henry King, Lewis Cody, and William Desmond Taylor, the latter acclaimed as a multitalented director, actor, and writer. Baby Marie Osborne and many other silent stars and directors also began their illustrious and successful careers at Balboa. Since Balboa has yet to break its silence, many historians are still unaware that it existed. At one time, however, Balboa bore considerable prestige in movieland, even though it was situated in a sometimes hostile climate where certain citizens scorned the very industry that had spurred Long Beach’s growth. There were concerns about “those types,” some of whom were consuming drugs and alcohol in a dry and righteous town. People were sometimes uncomfortable with the sight of actresses sporting skimpy gowns and bathing suits, lounging around with too much playtime and money to spare. Yes, there were drug and sex scandals in early movieland, before some drugs were even illegal. William Desmond Taylor, who was vehemently opposed to the use of drugs in movieland, may even have been killed by the hitman of a drug ring, several of which infiltrated the early movie industry. Taylor’s murder in ¡922 remains to this day a mystery; there may have been a cover-up to protect the industry from further scandal during times of bad publicity in the early ¡920s. Like MGM, Balboa made remarkable innovations in studio management and film development, including new methods for shooting night scenes and new techniques for color tinting. The studio often set industry standards regarding quality props and wardrobe, including their maintenance, storage, and care. In fact, Balboa was so highly e‡cient that its productivity nearly glutted the movie market, with as many as ¡0 movie companies\n\nPrologue shooting simultaneously at the studios. Balboa Studios comprised 20 buildings on 8 acres downtown, with ¡¡ additional acres for outdoor shooting in Signal Hill, a separate township enclosed within the city of Long Beach. To accommodate this high productivity, an elaborate and unique film distribution system at Balboa evolved with multiple companies, Fox and Pathé among them; at any one time there were as many as five distributors. Balboa’s motto might very well have been that of Louis B. Mayer: “Make it big, make it right.” The story of Balboa chronicles not only part of the untold story of movieland but also that of the city of Long Beach. Above all, if motion pictures represent the greatest chroniclers and storytellers of our century, movies help mark our development as a people on the move. We who love movies are all indebted to our predecessors in cinema. Movies can instruct, amuse, and keep us spellbound. Though they are fragile in their chemical composition, these “living pictures” have the power to transport us across spatio-temporal barriers and beyond the usual dimensions of the performing arts on stage. As an art form, the magic lantern projects a wonderfully mnemonic quality, casting remembrances against the screen for all to explore at the same time, bringing us in the hall to view them\n\n3\n\ntogether, though we might never agree on what we saw in those same pictures. Unfortunately, the much celebrated art of cinema has endured severe casualties. Preservation statistics are dismal: 80 percent of all silent movies in the world have disappeared because of nitrate decomposition or neglect, while 40 percent of all movies produced prior to ¡952 have also vanished forever, never to be restored. Should we care? What do we owe our predecessors anyway? Why should we remember Balboa? Actually, we owe it to our predecessors and ourselves to recognize the continuity of early filmmakers’ influence in our lives today. Balboa Films recognizes the historical importance of movie pioneers in Long Beach and their influence in the world, then and now. We need to mark the points in the past that help explain our present and possibly our future. Our knowledge of predecessors helps us understand our own progress and where we stand today. Balboa Studios produced countless quality pictures for five extraordinarily successful years, for moviegoers around the world. Long before MGM’s lion ever stepped onto the stage and became king, Balboa roared — and soared. To tell this story in the tradition of our predecessors, let’s begin by proclaiming loud and clear: “Lights, camera, action!”\n\nReel 1 ¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years When someone refers to the movie capital of the world, Hollywood immediately comes to mind, but this unrivaled Mecca did not yet exist when the first studio came to Long Beach in ¡9¡0. At that time the idea of producing films in the Far West was still a novelty. In ¡9¡0, when the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company built the first movie studio in Long Beach, it was also the first studio west of Chicago. New York was the film center of the United States. Europe ruled vast empires around the world, and European capitals called the shots with the power and prestige of their currencies, armies, navies, and industries. In particular, Europe’s enormous commercial successes represented for many people the very standards of modernity and fashion itself during the heady years of Europe’s belle époque, before the calamity of the Great War. Until the First World War erupted in ¡9¡4, Europe, and specifically France, reigned as the movie capital of the world, providing state-of-the-art equipment and techniques, along with worldclass methods of productivity, distribution, and marketing. The European empires that were riding so high earlier this century have since dissolved or evolved into new entities, and the center of\n\ntechnological, military, and commercial power has established itself firmly in the North American continent. Admirers of American knowhow and e‡ciency might easily overlook the predecessors abroad who contributed along the way to the achievements made in the United States. Undeniably, the American film industry is the most developed commercially in the world. Hollywood deserves its fame and glory, but predecessors, abroad and at home, did influence Hollywood. Some of these contributors are well documented and remembered, while others have never been su‡ciently recorded. While most of Hollywood’s superior studios are chronicled and well known, the place of Balboa Studios in movieland’s hall of fame lacks documentation and, consequently, recognition. Balboa’s contributions need to be examined and explained. On the other hand, French contributions at the beginning of early cinema have been well documented and remain undeniable facts to film historians. Nonetheless, even these French contributions become hidden in the shadows of Hollywood’s towering achievements. The French contributions to world-class cinema during the early days of the film industry, when Hollywood was not yet top-dog, might serve as an example of 5\n\n6\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nhow innovative predecessors are too often overlooked. Prior to the First World War, the emergence of movie palaces, special e›ects, feature films, and the development of genres in the United States followed the European prototypes. For instance, the first movie palace in the world, the Omnia, which was built by Pathé, opened in Paris, December ¡5, ¡906. It was followed five years later by the gigantic Gaumont Palace, which opened in Paris, November 30, ¡9¡¡. This theatre had been a former hippodrome and even a roller-skating center before Gaumont transformed it into the largest movie theatre in the world, with a seating capacity of 3,400. The first animated movie in the world, Fantasmagorie by Emile Cohl, was shown at the Théâtre du Gymnase in Paris, August ¡7, ¡908. Moreover, the novelty of the major feature was born in Italy in ¡9¡2 with Quo Vadis by Enrico Guazzoni. The Europeans were the original pacesetters in developing the Seventh Art into respectable and decidedly artistic entertainment, seriously investing time and e›ort into all kinds of technical problems, filming, and distribution logistics, and all phases of marketing. Thanks to Ferdinand Zecca, who joined Pathé Frères in ¡900, the French film industry launched standards that were to be assimilated around the world, including by the studios of California. Zecca is credited with having perfected the chase scene and influencing Sennett’s Keystone Kops, while France’s very original Max Linder created a comic character from whom Charlie Chaplin adapted certain body movements and expressions reflected in the creation of his Little Tramp. It was also France’s serial Nick Carter by Victorin Jasset that introduced the episodic crime stories in the silent era. Afterwards, Gaumont Pictures perfected this serial genre with its big smash hits Fantômas (¡9¡3–¡9¡4) and Les Vampires (¡9¡5–¡9¡6). Moreover, between ¡899 and ¡9¡3 Georges Méliès had produced more than 400 movies with his company called Star Film. Although Méliès used neither long shots nor close-ups, world cinema will always be indebted to him because he did originate significant camera tricks, including the dissolve,\n\nfade-out, superimposition, double exposure, stop motion, and slow motion. His company was also the first to produce a newsreel, a genre further advanced by the year ¡908 by both Pathé (Pathé journal) and Gaumont (Actualités Gaumont). At the very beginning of France’s cinematography preeminence, the new art was inaugurated in March ¡895 by Louis Lumière with his La Sortie des usines Lumière. On March ¡9, ¡895, the first showing in Lyon, France, failed because of mechanical problems. Three days later in Paris on March 22, ¡895, the film was successfully viewed by 200 persons. History marks, however, the date of the Lumière Brothers’ inauguration as December 28, ¡895, the day when they commercially screened their amazing cinématographe, from which were coined the words cinematography, cinematographer, cinema, and other derived terms denoting this new photographic art. Edison soon followed with an improved projection process shown to the public on April 23, ¡896. In fact, Edison had earlier commissioned an assistant, William Dickson, to devise a motion picture camera that was patented in ¡893, but Edison’s camera, the Kinetograph, was immovable, weighing more than ¡,000 pounds, and consequently was not so attractive to the earliest cinematographers. Edison’s first motion picture camera operated well enough as an inert heavyweight but did not allow for projection of what it photographed. In contrast, the Lumière Brothers’ camera weighed less than 20 pounds and was a hand-cranked invention that served both as a camera for filming and as a projector for showing the movies. The versatility and ease of operation of the Lumière invention explains why it became the preferred instrument used to establish many international cinemas, including the Russian, the Australian, and the Japanese movie industries. The Lumière Brothers also introduced with their method of projecting pictures the first bigscreen viewing, and the crowd-filled movie theatre as we know it today was born. By ¡897, Georges Méliès in France had an impressive list of original procedures that reflect the seriousness and the dedication with\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years which he engineered his craft: the first worldclass film plant, the first use of in-studio photos for publicity, the first movie star (himself ), the first chain of permanent viewing halls a‡liated with his Star Film productions. Nonetheless, early cinema in France was never all rosy. In March ¡902, Georges Méliès presented to exhibitors in Paris his Le Voyage dans la Lune, adapted from the literary works of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. The film became such a coveted success with the public that countless pirated copies were reproduced in the United States and around the world. Not a penny of this global box-o‡ce hit went into Méliès’ pockets. From this negative experience, Méliès, Pathé, and Gaumont learned to protect themselves in the future by creating American and foreign agencies to take advantage of the copyright protection laws in major countries. For even greater protection against piracy, the French studios even began to employ their company logos in the décor and the scenes of their films; Star Film used the star, Pathé used its rooster, and Gaumont employed its logo, daisies. Along with Star Film, Gaumont Pictures (founded in ¡895) and Pathé Frères (founded in ¡896) continued to advance France’s lead in production, distribution, and innovations in world cinema until the Great War. France, not Hollywood, was the original movie capital of the world. Gaumont opened foreign o‡ces and acquired theatre chains. With the financial support of some of France’s largest corporations, Charles Pathé bought the Lumière patents in ¡902, commissioning the creation of an improved camera. Until the end of the First World War in ¡9¡8, 60 percent of all film companies in the world used the Pathé camera for their productions. Pathé’s world-class operation included the assembly-line manufacturing of Pathé’s own film stock, along with its everexpanding production capacity. Like Gaumont Pictures, Pathé Frères began opening agencies abroad, becoming a formidable, international concern: Spain (¡906), Russia (¡907), Italy (¡908), England (¡909), and the United States (¡9¡0). Between ¡905 and ¡9¡4, with Méliès, Gaumont, and Pathé in the lead, French studios\n\n7\n\nwere the largest in the world, dominating world movie production, exhibition, and sales. Most of France’s cinematography successes were absolutely reputable and original, while Pathé’s predominance might best be described as a curious mix of cunning, guts, corporate spying and downright trickery. Comparable perhaps to a Gallic version of Horatio Alger, Charles Pathé began as a shoeless boy of a butcher family, su›ering poor health, but he became one of the twentieth century’s greatest capitalists. While France was still building the Panama Canal, young Charles had gone to South America seeking adventure and a fresh start, only to flee suddenly from the jungle because of the yellow fever epidemic. Always the undaunted sailor of fortune, when Charles returned to France, he began selling Edison phonographs. Soon he was engaged in contraband, selling counterfeit Kinetoscopes from England. As Alan Williams explains in Republic of Images (p. 42), during his smuggling days Charles worked very hard and did very well. Then he met Henri Joseph Joly, who suggested he quit the black market and that the two of them invest their e›orts in the manufacturing and sale of their own “original” film products. It is uncertain whether they obtained the Lumière Brothers’ patent, but Charles Pathé’s redesigned instrument also had the dual capacity to serve as both a camera and a projector. Joly did not remain in the picture, however, and some claim that Pathé stole the prototype before dumping Joly. After receiving a family inheritance, Charles and three of his brothers formed a new enterprise at the end of ¡896, calling it the Société Pathé Frères. Eventually the new enterprise would be simply called Pathé Frères, but not before two of the four brothers dropped out during a lawsuit against them for nondelivery of goods (Williams, p. 43). Charles and Emile maintained the company and worked harder than ever, with rewarding results. Eventually Pathé Frères revolutionized the marketing of movie production by initiating the idea of renting copies, which were previously and routinely sold to exhibitors. This allowed filmmakers to own their products indefinitely while cashing in on\n\n8\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nthe exhibitors’ rental fees. This practice started by Pathé Frères continues today. Thanks to Pathé Frères, the movie industry was set on a profitable and e‡cient course. Without a doubt, Charles and Emile Pathé were among early cinema’s most daring entrepreneurs, but they were clearly not the last. At the same time, in the United States, similar patterns were developing in the movie business with consolidations of industry-wide monopolies, with ownership and control based on stringent patent rights involving the production, distribution, and exhibition of films. Edison and the East Coast dominated the North American film industry’s production and system of film exchange. Film exchanges were the middlemen of the industry, acting as brokers between the producers and the exhibitors, providing films from the producers and leasing them to the exhibitors. According to Gri‡th and Mayer’s The Movies (p. 20) by ¡907 the film exchanges were amassing more revenue than the legitimate theatre and vaudeville combined. Thomas Alva Edison disdained the movies as a poor man’s entertainment, but he could smell the cash. Instead of suing all his competitors for violation of his patents, Edison invited his greatest competitors to form an invincible trust, calling it the Motion Picture Patents Company. In ¡909 ten partners emerged to announce that they and they alone had the exclusive right and license to produce motion pictures, a right backed by the patent laws of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Gri‡th and Mayers, p. 20). The trust comprised the leading American and French film companies at the time: Biograph, Essanay, Kalem, Kleine, Lubin, Selig, and Vitagraph in the United States and Méliès and Pathé Frères in France. Along with its exclusive right to produce movies, the trust also went after the independent film exchanges by creating the General Film Company. The trust informed the independent exchanges that they had to let the General Film Company take them over because the patent rights also involved the distribution and exhibition of film products. The trust did not fear the antitrust laws of the Sherman Act\n\nbecause its monopoly was based on patent protection. This takeover plan was not well received by the independents, and two in particular stand out for resisting the pressure to yield to the coercive ultimatum of the trust: Sell your exchange now or be forced to sell it to the trust. Two independent film exchanges resisted from the start the trust’s ultimatum, one headed by William Fox and the other by Carl Laemmle. In the long run, the trust’s ultimatum backfired. Following the bold example of Fox and Laemmle, the independents took the industry into their own hands despite the trust and succeeded in flourishing not only as independent exchanges but also as independent producers of films. While William Fox at first simply ignored the trust’s ultimatum, Carl Laemmle from the beginning openly criticized in letters and newspaper articles the trust’s manipulations of the movie market. When the trust cut o› supplies of movies to Laemmle, he became an independent movie producer, forming the Independent Motion-Picture Company (IMP), in defiance of the trust’s threats. The move toward more and more independent exchanges and movie producers actually guaranteed better quality films for the public because the independents took more care to provide quality movies for a growing and competitive market. The trust eventually succumbed to the forces of the open market created by the defiant independents, and it was already powerless to impose its special privileges before it was abolished by judicial decision in ¡9¡5. Once again the Americans fought for a free market on their own turf, struggling against the imposition of seigniorial fees without representation in another war of independence for the sake of free enterprise and the Seventh Art. At the height of this war, an historical occasion brought film distributors, exhibitors, and producers to the Hotel McAlpin in New York on August 29, ¡9¡4, to incorporate a new alliance called the National Independent Motion Picture Board of Trade that legally challenged Edison’s Motion Picture Patents Company, popularly called the “trust.” It was the intention of these assembled independent producers and exhibitors and producers to become as\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years powerful as Edison’s “trust” but with a higher purpose, opposing the trust’s special privileges and unfair trade practices. Motion Picture News published the intentions of the newly incorporated group, citing the high aims they o›ered in their “declaration of independence” in an article entitled “Independent Board of Trade Organized”: To foster trade and commerce and the interests of those engaged either as manufacturers, distributors and exhibitors of motion pictures, to reform abuses relative thereto, to secure freedom from unjust or harmful exactions, to eliminate unfair competition and restraint of trade, and combinations in restraint of trade, to obtain legislation necessary to correct certain present harmful conditions to the motion picture business, and to regulate trade and commerce in that business so that the same shall be free, open, unrestrained and fair to all; to di›use accurate and reliable information as to the standing of manufacturers, distributors and exhibitors, and other matters to procure uniformity and certainty in the customs and usages of trade and commerce, to obtain a standardization of machines, films, appliances and appurtenances to the said business, to settle and arbitrate di›erences between and among its members, and to promote a marked enlarged and friendly intercourse between and among the members thereof. (Press Clippings, vol. ¡, p. 7¡)\n\nWilliam Fox led the group and called the meeting in which the assembled parties represented almost $75,000 of capital. It was a defiant show of force against Edison’s trust. H. M. Horkheimer was among the hundred people attending that day; he was one of the five vice presidents nominated, and he also was chosen to be one of the directors of the National Independent Motion Picture Board of Trade. The president of the new alliance was William Fox, whose legal counsel, Gustavus A. Rogers, directed the legal battle against Edison’s trust. The executive committee of the new board consisted of its newly elected o‡cers and directors. The o‡cers were as follows:\n\n9\n\nWilliam Fox, representing the William Fox Amusement Co., President H. J. Sawyer, representing Sawyer, Inc., Vice President J. M. Shear, representing Solax Co., Vice President H. M. Horkheimer, representing Balboa Feature Films, Vice President B. K. Bimberg, representing Schuyler Amusement Co., Vice President S. Schwalbe, representing Electric Theatre Supply Co., Vice President Winfield R. Sheehan, representing Box O‡ce Amusements Co., Treasurer Jesse L. Goldberg, representing Life Photo Film Corp., Secretary Walter Sammis, Executive Secretary The directors were William Fox, L. J. Selznick, A. H. Sawyer, H. M. Horkheimer, and Louis Rosenbluh; four others were to be named later. During this period, the Horkheimers and William Fox continued to have close associations regarding film production and distribution, both in New York and in Long Beach. For example, Charles Mortimer Peck, who was connected with William Fox’s Box O‡ce Attraction publicity department, took up the duties of assistant general manager of the Balboa Amusement Producing Company at Long Beach, and the Horkheimers intended to maintain an o‡ce in New York on a permanent basis, probably because H. M. was an o‡cer and director in the newly formed National Independent Motion Picture Board of Trade. However, in an article dated November ¡4, ¡9¡4, entitled “Peck Assistant Manager for Balboa,” Motion Picture News implies, that there was a more extensive relationship between the parties. Fox and the Horkheimers shared several levels of production, distribution, and management: “It is understood that H. M. and E. D. Horkheimer, owners of the [Balboa Amusement Producing] company, will in the near future open an o‡ce in New York City and one partner will be there all of the time, and both a part of the time; thus the management of their producing company on the West\n\n10\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nThe Lasky Barn, in Hollywood, was converted, December ¡9¡3, into the original studio of “Hollywood.” Today the building houses the Hollywood Heritage Museum.\n\ncoast will be looked after in their absence by Mr. Peck” (Press Clippings, vol. ¡, p. ¡25).\n\nLights, Camera, Action — Long Beach Long Beach has the historical distinction of being the home of the very first film plant in the United States to have its headquarters west of Chicago. The first studio in Long Beach, and the first film plant to originate in California, was called the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company and was founded in ¡9¡0. In January ¡9¡3, Edison, with his movie headquarters in the Bronx, New York, also targeted Long Beach for one of his western outposts. He leased the studio already in place, renaming it the Edison Motion Picture Company. By coincidence, in December of that same year, Cecil B. DeMille, who was heading west from New York, left Flagsta›, Arizona, since he was unable to film there because of inclement weather, and he took his film crew further west\n\nto California. DeMille ended up at an unassuming barn in Hollywood and telegraphed his partners in New York, Jesse Lasky and Samuel Goldwyn, to ask if they would approve his renting the barn for $75 per month. His partners warily replied: “Authorize you to rent barn, but on month-to-month basis. Don’t make any long commitment. Regards, Jesse and Sam” (Callard, p. 29). At the time, Hollywood was simply the location of a barn, not the emblem par excellence for the movie industry. In a short time, more and more moviemakers would make the move to California. Not only could the independent producers escape to some degree the stranglehold of the trust back East, but who could deny the good climate and diverse scenery in Southern California? In January ¡9¡3, J. Searle Dawley of the Edison Motion Picture Company had arrived in Long Beach with his stock players and technicians and resided in the elegant Hotel Virginia. A few months later Balboa Amusement Producing Company established itself as the third film plant in Long Beach, again at the very same\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years\n\n11\n\nBalboa’s facility began as the first movie studio to originate in California: the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company in Long Beach, incorporated October ¡9¡0. Also the site of the Edison western outpost, beginning production in January ¡9¡3 (courtesy of Marc Wanamaker).\n\nsite. It would not be the last film plant in Long Beach, but all of them would close by ¡923. By ¡9¡5 the North American film center was rapidly gravitating toward the West; that year 50 percent of all U.S. films were being produced in California. In fact, by ¡9¡5 the film industry had become the fifth largest industry in the United States. Within a few years, the studios of Los Angeles County, including those in Long Beach, would transform Southern California into the film capital of the world. During the Great War in Europe, the Far West was recapturing the lead in this expanding industry, not only in the United States, but as the movie production center of the world. During the European calamity, before there was even an establishment called Hollywood, Balboa launched itself for five glorious years, ¡9¡3– ¡9¡8, as the home of the largest glass studio in the industry and one of the most productive plants in the history of world cinema. Balboa Studios in Long Beach, along with its neighboring pioneers in Los Angeles, helped make\n\nSouthern California the movie capital of the world, with Balboa contributing to California’s lead in the industry by producing countless quality films such as St. Elmo, Little Mary Sunshine, Who Pays? and The Awakening. Hollywood still reigns today as movieland’s supreme emblem of movie magic, while Balboa Studios in Long Beach, though having made it big-time and having contributed to Southern California’s supremacy in the film industry, vanished almost completely from the moviegoers’ collective memory. While movie history was being made in Long Beach, Balboa Studios o›ered some of the industry’s most ambitious triumphs, before the studios fell into near oblivion during the exploding growth and change of the movie industry in Los Angeles County. Today in Long Beach, Balboa’s traces and undeniable legacy can still be claimed, making possible eventual recognition of Balboa Studios’ significant contributions to California’s movie history and Long Beach’s rightful place in movieland’s hall of fame.\n\n12\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nOn March 3, ¡9¡4, H. M. Horkheimer, head of Balboa Studios, explained in the Daily Telegram why Long Beach was the ideal location for making feature films: almost perpetual sunshine, proximity to ships and docks at San Pedro, proximity to mountains and seashores, aid of local people, and ocean breezes that kept the air free of haze (Press Clippings, vol. ¡). Today many people still recognize Long Beach as an ideal location for films, not knowing that it was once a moviemaking center. Several modern films have used the city either as a major or minor location. The Press Telegram, September ¡9, ¡995, announced that the Association of Film Commissioners International Conference was being held in Long Beach. Ironically, overlooking Long Beach’s littleknown movie history, the association’s president, Leigh Von Der Esch, noted, “Your community is getting a reputation for being film friendly.” Scott Dewees, a Long Beach alumni and winner of the professional of the year award, also remarked, “It’s an area that hasn’t been overshot. It’s friendly. It is very diverse in its looks.” Like Horkheimer, Von Der Esch and Dewees expressed similar compliments about Long Beach as an ideal location for films. The Press Telegram article cites some of the recent blockbusters shot in Long Beach: Spy Hard, Leslie Nielsen’s spoof on action-adventure films; Nixon, Oliver Stone’s look at the life of President Richard Nixon, with Anthony Hopkins in the title role; Air Time, wherein Michael Jordan made his film début; Batman Forever; Speed; and Stargate, just to mention a few. Fortunately, Long Beach still maintains its movie heritage, though most people remain totally in the dark about its glorious moviemaking past.\n\nEarly Studios in California In its December ¡0, ¡9¡0, issue, Variety exclaimed: “Chicago is the only city west of the Alleghenies with the exception of one plant at Los Angeles where the motion picture is manufactured.” Was there really only one “California” studio in Los Angeles County at the end\n\nof ¡9¡0? Yes and no. There were at least six studios established by that time in California, but only one, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company, was not an outpost of a company located in either New York or Chicago. The following list gives, more or less in chronological order, the first six studios in Southern California, all but one of them with headquarters back East. Some of the following descriptions give specific months and years when the studios were established in California, while the time period when other film companies relocated in California cannot be precisely determined. In any case, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company was among the first six film plants operating in California at the end of ¡9¡0, and it was the fourth studio erected in Los Angeles County. Nonetheless, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company has the marked distinction of being the very first film plant originating in California, with its headquarters in Long Beach, rather than in Chicago or New York. New York Motion Picture Company First established in New York and organized by Adam Kessel, Jr., this was one of the first independent motion picture companies in the United States. This company’s California outpost was started in the fall of ¡909 under the management of producer Fred Balshofer (Slide, p. 244). Selig Polyscope Company Selig, one of the earliest film companies in the world, was founded in Chicago by William N. Selig on April 9, ¡896. In ¡909–¡9¡0, Selig built the earliest permanent studio in California, in Edendale, on Allesandro Street; it was managed by James L. McGee (Encyclopedia of Movie Studios). Biograph Company Biograph was one of the earliest film companies in the world; it was founded in ¡895 by\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years Henry Norton Marvin in New York. Two studios were established in Los Angeles at separate time periods, the first of these operating from January to April ¡9¡0 at Grand Avenue and Washington Street, the second operating from ¡9¡¡ to ¡9¡5 at Georgia Street and Girard Street (Slide, p. 40). Essanay Film Manufacturing Company This company was incorporated in Chicago, February 5, ¡907, by George K. Spoor and G. M. Anderson. On September 8, ¡909, G. M. Anderson left Chicago and headed west. He stopped at Denver, El Paso, and Santa Barbara before settling in Niles, California, near Oakland, in ¡909. According to Marc Wanamaker, Essanay took over the Majestic Studio in East L.A. in ¡9¡5. It was located at 65¡ Fairview Avenue in Boyle Heights, then called Brooklyn Heights. California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company This film studio is the only one on the list that originated in California, and that fact may account for the name of the company, which was incorporated on October ¡5, ¡9¡0, at the corner of Sixth Street and Alamitos Avenue in Long Beach. It was managed by five directors: C. H. Lovell, M. C. Lovell, H. R. Davis, M. F. Brooks, and T. L. Howland. Kalem Company, Incorporated This film company was founded in Chicago in early ¡907 by George Kleine, Samuel Long, and Frank Marion. A Kalem studio was later established in California at Verdugo Canyon, Glendale, on December ¡¡, ¡9¡0, by director Kenean Buell, along with William Wright (Slide, p. ¡82). Of all the locations in California for a film plant, one might ask “Why Long Beach?” Actually, this seaside resort was a perfect choice. Long Beach had been known as a theatre town,\n\n13\n\nwith many actors and technicians at its doorstep. Legitimate theatre and vaudeville prospered in Long Beach before the studios and silver screens were erected. Theatrical talent was abundant, with companies like the Keith and Orpheum Circuit, and many early film actors started out as comedians or vaudevillians. In ¡908, for example, “Fatty” Roscoe Arbuckle, who later returned to live and work in Long Beach, had been doing summer stock in Long Beach, receiving $50 a week as a singer and comedian. That summer Arbuckle performed at the fashionable Pike amusement area of Long Beach at the Byde A Whyle Theatre, one of the most elegant structures owned by the equally majestic Hotel Virginia. During Arbuckle’s theatre tour in Long Beach, he met and fell in love with a young dancer, Minta Durfee. In his article, “Long Beach Story: The Balboa Amusements Producing Company” (p. 22), Chris Callard reports that Arbuckle proposed marriage to the dancer while strolling along the Pine Avenue Pier. Arbuckle must have possessed many fond memories associated with Long Beach. According to Callard, when Arbuckle’s marriage proposal to Durfee was made public, the theatre manager made special arrangements to have the wedding performed on stage. On August 5, ¡908, after doing two shows before a full house, Roscoe and Minta were married by the Long Beach mayor himself. Callard notes that Roscoe and Minta received many signs of genuine kindness from the people of Long Beach, the newlyweds being flooded with wedding gifts from citizens they didn’t even know. The gifts were even displayed in the windows of Long Beach’s downtown Bu›um department store. It is understandable that Arbuckle loved Long Beach and returned there to make movies and to build himself a home. Before the movies ever came to town, Roscoe Arbuckle’s much celebrated wedding reflected Long Beach’s heartfelt goodwill toward talented and likable artists. Not only were the inhabitants of Long Beach most welcoming to theatrical companies, but the climate and terrain of Southern California also drew crowds, along with Long\n\n14\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nThe elegant Hotel Virginia, at Ocean Boulevard and Magnolia Avenue, on the blu› overlooking the beach. The Pike amusement zone appears to the left.\n\nHotel Virginia — grand stairway.\n\nBeach’s expanding commerce. In fact, Long Beach in ¡9¡3 was hailed as the fastest growing municipality in the United States. Everywhere one looks in Long Beach, even today, one can find scenery of all types, with the ocean, port, and beaches just a few steps away, mountains\n\nin reach within two hours by car, the city limits being equally close to both rocky deserts and alpine woods, with rivers and marshlands intersecting the city, left and right, with Santa Catalina Island just o› the coast of Long Beach. What more could a filmmaker want than a city\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years\n\n15\n\nHotel Virginia — main lobby\n\nfull of theatrical talent, a welcoming populace, and an ideal location? In the early days, film studios were already valued as commercial industries and were often called plants or manufacturing companies. Occasionally these film manufacturing sites were even called factories. The first film plant in Long Beach and the first American studio to originate west of Chicago was called the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company. In October ¡9¡0, the Long Beach Chamber of Commerce was informed of the interest of certain businessmen — C. H. Lovell and M. C. Lovell from Los Angeles; and H. R. Davis, M. F. Brooks, and T. L. Howland from Long Beach — to establish a motion picture plant in the city. In their initial proposal, these entrepreneurs intended to spend $¡,500 for a developing house and other edifices necessary for the film studio, with a total output between $¡5,000 and $20,000, a considerable\n\ninvestment at the time. Among this group of investors, Howland, who was motivated by his business ties with the Bijou Theatre in Long Beach, was particularly interested in the film plant’s lucrative potential. Howland lamented the insu‡cient number of films released by both Edison’s trust and the independent filmmakers. He complained that there simply weren’t enough films available to exhibitors, not only in Long Beach but across the nation. In the Long Beach Press, Howland explained that the new film industry in Long Beach would stimulate the local economy and also satisfy the ever-growing national demand for more movies: All the films will be branded, “Made in Long Beach.” There are now only from twenty-three to twenty-seven independent new pictures released weekly and they are distributed among 5,000 show houses. The trust releases about as many pictures. Long\n\n16\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nBeach uses about twenty-seven films a week, which makes it necessary to show some old films at times. The demand is much greater than the supply. (Oct. 20, ¡9¡0, ¡:4)\n\nThe new company was incorporated on October ¡5, ¡9¡0, and the five directors, M. F. Brooks, T. L. Howland, H. R. Davis, C. H. Lovell, and M. C. Lovell, rushed and pushed the establishment of this enterprise together faster than any other company in Long Beach. Everyone involved seemed convinced of the boon these motion picture headquarters would o›er the expanding economy of Long Beach. Among the seven elaborate purposes outlined in the Articles of Incorporation of the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company, the second purpose states: The purpose[s] for which said Corporation is formed and framed are as follows: To engage in and carry on the business of manufacturing moving or motion pictures. To engage in the art and manufacture and sale of photographic motion picture films for the purposes of advertising, instruction, amusement, and such other profitable uses and purposes, as the Board of directors may direct.\n\nThe directors’ bold ambitions seem to have had no limits, matching in power and scope nothing short of a precursor of the amusement parks launched by Walt Disney, a sort of EPCOT Center in Long Beach: To conduct amusement enterprises in all the branches pertaining thereto and thereof ; consisting of summer gardens, parks, hotels, dance halls, bathing beaches, roof gardens, theaters, nickelodeons, and to run steamboats and other boats for excursion and other purposes; to operate any plays, operas, songs, musical or dramatical performances and other things relating thereto which may be used for amusements of persons in public and private places, and to conduct amusement enterprises of all kinds; to buy, purchase, lease, option, or otherwise acquire, own,\n\nexchange, sell or otherwise dispose of, mortgage and deal in real estate, lands, or buildings for the erection and establishment of theaters, halls, o‡ces, stores and ware-houses, with suitable plants, engines and machinery for the furtherance of the businesses named herein; to construct, carry out, maintain, improve, manage, work, control or superintend any private mills, factories, ware-houses and other works and conveniences, which may seem directly or indirectly conducive to the objects of the Company, and to contribute to, subsidize or otherwise aid, or take part in such operations.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce secretary, Mr. Camp, was instructed to meet with the five directors of the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company to look over available locations for the new studio. Motion picture expert V. L. Duhem from Oakland had already been scouting out the region for the new plant. He had reported to his associates that Long Beach would be an ideal location for manufacturing the newfangled productions, sometimes called “moving pictures.” Of the many locations considered, Duhem believed that the land occupied by the Electric Manufacturing Company on the corner of Sixth Street and Alamitos Avenue in Long Beach, as well as several locations around Signal Hill, would be ideal for motion picture productions. One tract of land had already been considered, but that deal fell through. The scouts had been eyeing property near Zaferia Junction that belonged to the Pacific Electric Company, but another buyer, the Southern Pacific Company, beat the movie crowd to the draw, so the search went on. Local men a‡liated with the company, M. F. Books, P. L. Howland, and H. R. Davis, were looking for two to three acres to allow ample space for all the necessary paraphernalia used to film action scenes, to construct all types of scenery, and to erect building fronts. No stone was left unturned during the search, with several locations taken into consideration. Howland would eventually become the president of the California Motion Picture\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years Manufacturing Company and would work with the Chamber of Commerce, leasing the studios to various production companies, including the Edison Motion Picture Company, Famous Players Company, and Pilot Films Company, until the Horkheimer purchase of the site in ¡9¡3. At one point, the newly formed California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company was planning to take over the former Buckle factory building on East Fourth Street, east of Alamitos Avenue. During the company’s relentless search, P. L. Howland was quoted in the Daily Telegram: “We are going out with Mr. Camp of the Chamber of Commerce tomorrow, and are pretty sure we can find something to suit us. We need at least two or three acres, the more the better, because some of the scenes will require much action and quite a lot of ground. The company will go pretty strong on comedy pictures, which seems to be what the public mind craves more than any other” (Oct. 20, ¡9¡0, 8:6). This historical moment for the early film industry in Southern California looked very promising for the ambitious city of Long Beach. The decision was finally made to build the studio at the intersection of Sixth Street and Alamitos Avenue. The Long Beach Daily Telegram dated January 27, ¡9¡¡, ran this headline: “California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company Begins Active Operations.” At an initial expense of $20,000, the new manufacturing company would spare no cost for the di›erent departments or for the equipment needed to produce high-class motion picture films. The film plant was set up to lease its facilities to movie producers, with a projected weekly payroll of at least $300. For the value of the dollar at that time, these sums were considerable outlays. As a point of reference, the average annual income at the time would have been around $¡,000. Fortunately, Duhem, the general manager, was a practical man with important experience in this expensive and burgeoning industry that was full of exciting novelties in cinematography. He took it under his own direction to buy the best European lenses, Pathé cameras, and other necessary materials to assure the best quality films.\n\n17\n\nActors had been secured and other company workers would be selected as soon as competent people could be found. Only the best people would be employed to promote the highest quality film production capacity. In Long Beach, the stage was being carefully prepared to lure film companies from the East and to promote increased productivity of the motion pictures that were so much in demand in the growing entertainment market. According to Claudine Burnett, head of literature and history at the Long Beach Public Library, Long Beach’s enthusiastic involvement with movies began at the turn of the century. In Burnett’s account titled “Long Beach Motion Picture Industry: ¡9¡¡–¡923,” she reports that the first motion picture was shown on June 22, ¡900, in the old Tabernacle, at the northeast corner of Third Street and Locust Avenue. It was an Edison picture with a combat scene and marine scenes. The Tabernacle was an historical building that had been erected in the ¡880s by the Chautauqua Assembly of Long Beach. In ¡900 the Tabernacle was the only theatre in Long Beach, a small town then having a population of 2,252 inhabitants. For a small town, the Tabernacle could serve and did serve many functions at the same time — theatre, lecture hall, and church. In ¡907, La Petite Theatre at 236 Pine Avenue became the first establishment especially built as a movie house. Burnett states that patrons could see a movie at La Petite for ten cents and view Edison’s latest productions: The Bell-Ringer’s Daughter, The Flexible Man, and The Fairy of the Spring. The program was changed Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. Burnett states that the manager of La Petite, Mr. Erwin, attempted to have only the most recent films, but despite his e›orts to make La Petite a great success, his enterprise failed to make enough profit, and the theatre closed in ¡908. Claudine Burnett further recounts that in ¡902 the arrival of the Pacific Electric Railway and the building of the amusement zone called the Pike not only put Long Beach on the map but made the city’s population explode. From ¡900 to ¡9¡0, the population of Long Beach\n\n18\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nThe Pike, Long Beach’s amusement zone, circa ¡9¡0 (courtesy of Long Beach Public Library).\n\ngrew a whopping 69¡ percent as the city became a major entertainment and seaside resort center (Burnett, p. 2). The Pike was a perfect draw for the motion picture industry and was the location where the first motion picture plant originating in California would be formed. In ¡90¡ a retired railroad magnate from Arizona, Charles R. Drake, conceived the idea of an amusement area in Long Beach. It was Drake who arranged for the Pacific Electric rail line to come into Long Beach to bring in the people to visit his new amusement center. Why was the area called the “Pike”? According to Claudine Burnett, the name was suggested by one of the attractions at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of ¡904, where there was a “Ten Million Dollar Pike.” One of the definitions of the term pike is a narrow and pointed piece of land. Thus the name was appropriate for the narrow strip of private concessions and amusement rides at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, as well as the similar arrangement for the entertainment center in Long Beach. With the new amusement center in place, theatre managers at the Pike in Long Beach\n\ntook advantage of the opportunities a›orded by the new movie industry. After the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company had established itself in Long Beach, a convention of motion picture producers and distributors convened inside the halls of the Chamber of Commerce of Long Beach. F. Du Ree, the manager of the Bijou Theatre, declared to a reporter from the Long Beach Press: “This is the most important gathering of the men engaged in this business that has ever been held in the southwest.” Du Ree continued his boast, “It is the first o‡cial gathering of those engaged in the moving picture business that has ever been held in this part of the country.” This convention provides one more example of the earliest stirrings of the motion picture industry in Southern California, again in the commercially expanding city of Long Beach. As Burnett also explains, there were many important issues open to discussion at this historic conference, especially the possible enactment of laws to protect the production and distribution of motion pictures. Coming from all parts of Southern California and Arizona, over 200 people attended the conference. The\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years\n\n19\n\nThe Pike looking east toward the Pine Street Pier (courtesy of Long Beach Public Library).\n\nprogram started with a tour of the Pike, after which everyone sat down to discuss and exchange ideas. At the same time, the gathering served as a trade show, displaying the latest theatre chairs, curtains, machines, and moving picture supplies. Since the people attending the convention were particularly concerned about making the new film industry respectable, they promoted the making of films that would encourage respectability through temperance and the highest moral conduct by avoiding any scenes of murder, saloon brawls, and drunken behavior. This policy reflected, of course, the politically correct temperance movement of the day. By ¡9¡¡ the Pike was a thriving, active, and state-of-the art amusement park, the Coney Island of the Pacific. The Pike included a playground, day nursery, a carousel, a rollerskating rink, a miniature railway, and a monstrously large Ferris wheel. Along with all the\n\nother sources of entertainment, the Pike also provided year-round vaudeville programs. The stage was set for a bustling theatre and cinema center for Long Beach, not to mention for all of Los Angeles County. Long Beach was clearly a bold contender in Southern California’s motion picture industry because the city was already a world-class entertainment center and seaside resort. Following the historical founding of the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company in Long Beach in ¡9¡0, there would be other film plants settling in the foothills of Los Angeles County, such as Universal Studios and Paramount in ¡9¡2. For the U.S. movie industry, the march had begun that would shift the center of the film industry from the East to the West. There was a new kind of rush for the gold in Californy, and the studio trains were packing to make the long haul, their banners flapping “California or bust!” Universal and\n\n20\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nParamount gained lasting fame and glory, but the film industry in Long Beach remains to this date almost forgotten, even though it was one of the very first and most successful prospectors in early movieland. In April ¡9¡¡, U.S. marshals seized all the cameras and equipment at the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company’s o‡ces in Los Angeles in accordance with the rights of the Motion Picture Patent Company, Edison’s trust, to prevent the illegal use of such equipment by independent producers. This interruption did not prevent the company from going ahead with its ambitious plans; that month it filmed its first comedy in Long Beach. In fact, that same April, seven months before the Gaumont Palace, with its enormous seating capacity of 3,400, opened its doors to the Parisian public, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company had begun its own ambitious building on the Pike, laying the foundation of a modern, up-to-date motion picture theatre, to provide the first of a series of public viewing halls connected with the film producers at the Long Beach studio. Excavation and construction began directly north of the Unique Theatre and west of the Bernice Apartments on April ¡3, ¡9¡¡. With a sta› of eight persons permanently employed and several part-time workers, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company was planning on the continued growth of all the town’s businesses, with particular attention, of course, directed toward the exciting potential of the new film industry. The company would show all its own movies and import others. On May ¡3, ¡9¡¡, the new California Motion Picture Company’s theatre at the Pike opened its doors without a roof, showing its first comedy, On Matrimonial Seas. The company wanted to meet its own deadline, though there had been construction delays. Therefore the first shows were at night, when no roof would be needed to keep out daylight. There was no dragging of feet in Long Beach while putting the new movie plant in order. An article dated April ¡3, ¡9¡¡, does not reveal the identity of a certain mysterious Easterner, “the best picture-making artist,” who\n\nwould be in charge of movie production in Long Beach. The article does claim that the mystery man would bring with him a large troupe of actors from back East to produce photoplays. Unfortunately, none of these early professional artists coming to Long Beach are identified. If the mystery man worked for Edison films, then it must have been someone other than J. Searle Dawley, who arrived in Long Beach two years later, in January ¡9¡3. Nonetheless, with a seating capacity of 800, the new movie theatre would be proudly showing productions filmed in Long Beach, providing the public the first views of Long Beach as the setting and background for the photoplays performed by actors who would soon be making their homes and spending their cash in this developing movie town. The California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company had pulled out all the stops. The company had already received a large consignment of raw film stock that was being perforated in the company’s laboratories, with another large order on the way. To entice movie producers to come to town, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company o›ered to pay the rent for the ground they occupied in the amount of $¡8,000. These early entrepreneurs spent big money because they had big dreams and wanted to see industries of all sorts expand in Long Beach. Besides housing the movie theatre, the new construction would also provide seven storage rooms facing the fashionable and busy Pike, each one to be leased on an annual basis. The forward-looking manufacturing company hoped to attract a film producer from the East, where the American film capital was located at the time. The Long Beach businessmen tried to make the film plant in California appear as attractive as possible by having a string of theatres extending up and down the California coastline as far north as the Oregon border as part of the package in Long Beach, so that film producers could exhibit their productions with the already established convenience of these a‡liated theatres. What more could any film company want — a city bending over backwards to be business-friendly, a complete movie outfit\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years furnished and raring to go, not to mention a seaside resort, beautiful weather, and plenty of sunshine? Even today many citizens in Long Beach have watched motion pictures being shot around town. The crew sets up lights as makeup artists powder the faces of the stars and the commanding director shouts instructions to the crew. A Panavision platinum sits on a dolly and tracks the shot with the cameraman riding this Rolls-Royce of cameras. Sync cables connect the camera to the sound system, and soundmen adjust booms mounted with microphones attached to the cables. These days hundreds of people comprise motion picture crews, and millions of dollars are spent for a single production. By contrast, when the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company first invited movie companies to film at its studios, motion pictures were less technologically complex, and had no sound; cameramen used a 20-pound, hand-cranked camera. Most of the time the filmmakers had to use natural outdoor lighting enhanced with di›users when photographing a scene. Armies of men and women work in the crews of today, but only a handful of people made these early silent pictures, at a fraction of the millions spent now. One of the first shoots for the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company concerned what we might call an infomercial about the city of Long Beach, which was to be shown in the East to help draw reputable movie companies to Long Beach’s new movie facilities. Made with the cooperation of the Long Beach Chamber of Commerce, spearheaded by secretary Camp, this promotional film was to be sent all over the country. Its scenario was the work of one Harry Wilhelm, a ¡9-year-old author from Signal Hill. This first Long Beach production was accomplished in the blink of an eye at a pace unimaginable today, when a movie on the average takes a year to shoot. In a modern-day film, during a ¡2-hour shooting, only one minute of those ¡2 hours can be counted in the finished product. At any rate, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company’s first movie\n\n21\n\nwas nothing more than a calculated advertisement, showing the city’s best features, to entice film companies to make the long haul from the East to Long Beach, where they could establish a permanent film base. It was early morning on January 6, ¡9¡¡, when the first movie production in Long Beach began to roll. The cast was to consist of the Long Beach Fire Department, though along the way the production attracted a lot of extras (kids on bikes, crowds in the streets, people visible in windows, and a Mr. J. J. Mottell — “among the first to witness the shooting,” said the papers). The fire department went through a series of stunts. The cameras rolled, showing the setting o› of an alarm, followed by a scene of the fire department headquarters at Third Street and Pacific Avenue, where the alarm was answered in a hurry. Various autos and other fire equipment came rushing out from the building. Next the cameraman took his place at the southeast corner of Pine Avenue and Ocean Boulevard, where the police tried to hold the excited crowd of onlookers back, out of the camera’s view. Tearing down Pine Avenue, the fire engine sounded its mighty whistle and gongs, attracting the typical “fire crowd.” The scenario for this a›air might well have read something like this: Sets—Exterior Only Fire alarm Entrance of Fire Department Headquarters Corner of Third and Pacific Departmental vehicles and equipment Run down Pine Avenue Run down First Street Run down East Ocean Boulevard at the foot of Locust Run from Pine proceeding east toward American (Long Beach Boulevard today)\n\nFADE IN ¡\n\nEXT.

This promotional film even required a second take because the driver of the truck took o› before the cameraman was ready. As is still true today, people tried to get in the picture by following the camera while it was shooting a scene. The boys on their bicycles tried to become the first extras in this film,\n\nand by not being careful, they almost caused accidents. The company decided not to use professional actors for this production; instead amateurs were hired and taught how to perform. The company hired eight to ten persons to act for its promotional movies. The day following this shoot, o‡cials of the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company announced that this promotional footage would be shown in mid–January at the Bijou Theatre at the Pike. It was to be viewed only by city o‡cials, firemen, and newsmen behind closed doors. This spectacular run would not be shown to the general public. The film had been sent to San Francisco to be developed. When the film was shipped back to Long Beach, it was returned with a complete developing machine to be used in Long Beach for developing future films. Howland stated that the promo film came out perfectly. Most of the scenarios for the company’s promotional films would come from private authors. Several were written by the aforementioned Harry Wilhelm. Displaying much talent, Wilhelm had already written several scenarios for the Independent Moving Picture Company (Imp), the Bison Company, and many others. With the approval of city o‡cials, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company began filming in earnest February ¡5, ¡9¡¡. These promotional films would be shown after March ¡, ¡9¡¡, but none of these initial films would be exhibited first by the local Long Beach theatres. Before the local theatres would show them publicly, those films had to be sold directly to the exchanges, which would then rent them to the national theatre chains for general distribution. Long Beach theatres would have to wait their turn. Consequently, inquiries began pouring in from leading exchanges around the world. An exchange in London wanted to secure rights for distribution of future productions from the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company in England and throughout Europe. Requests came in daily to Howland, president of the company. Stock footage was already being shot to be spliced into future films.\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years The second promo film was entitled Winter Sports in Southern California. This film was not what the film crew had intended to shoot when they went south on location. While out to get film of the Mexican Revolution, the crew decided to take a detour through a more peaceful San Diego where two thousand feet of film were shot. What was the event that had drawn them away from Mexico? A yacht race in San Diego provided excellent diversion, showing two yachts, the Azota and the Gretchen, doing stunts and coming close to a collision. The filmmakers in San Diego also displayed their aerial ladder against the side of the new U.S. Grant Hotel to show how quickly they could get set up to take other views of the harbor. In praise of Long Beach’s growing number of high-quality films, Howland boasted, “They are the equal of any ever put out by any company and that already they have several o›ers for these films” (Daily Telegram, Mar. ¡4, ¡9¡¡, 5:7). These films would be shown at the Bijou Theatre on the Pike on March ¡5 and ¡6, ¡9¡¡. The first film was described as proudly displaying the U.S. submarine Pike maneuvering in the harbor, as she trims the waves, shows her dive, and then comes out of a totally submerged position. Also seen was a torpedo with the warhead on alert for immediate use. In addition to these promo films, the California Motion Picture Company began filming on April 27, ¡9¡¡, its first photoplay, On Matrimonial Seas, which premiered at the Pike in Long Beach on May ¡3, ¡9¡¡. The cast included Hampton Del Ruth, Mrs. Blakeney, Roy Patchin, Miss Elora, Miss Sanchez, and Miss McLean. This was to be the first movie filmed on Ocean Boulevard, the Pike, and the beach to appear in the new theatre built on the Pike for the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Co. On April 27, ¡9¡¡, in an article titled “Good Films Are Taken,” the Daily Telegram stated that there had been a big crowd of spectators and “followers” on location and that many Long Beach people would see themselves in the movie. Company president Howland encouraged the public to be at the beach scenes while the principal actors were bathing. Inter-\n\n23\n\nestingly enough, Hampton Del Ruth, who starred in this early film, would return in the ¡920s to start his own film company at the former Balboa site. These three films are the only examples of the earliest productions at Long Beach for which documentation has been found. These films and any others made at the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company have probably faced the same fate as most nitrate films made in the silent era, dissolving, alas, into dust. The full story of this company is not known. These unanswered questions just add more mystery to the story of silent film companies located in Long Beach. The local press did note, however, the existence of another motion picture company in Long Beach at the time: the International Moving Picture Company, founded on May 23, ¡9¡¡. The company was a joint U.S. and Japanese venture, with films made in both countries. Organized with a capital of $¡5,000, this international company was headed by Ichiro Asai, a Japanese citizen who lived in Long Beach and worked for John Bowers. After Bowers was shot to death in a lover’s triangle, the newspapers never made any other mention of Asai’s company. Along with the increased film production in Long Beach, there was also an increase in the number of movie theatres. Comfort and luxury became serious concerns in erecting these movie houses. For example, in June ¡9¡2 the Long Beach Press reported that workmen were busy remodeling and redecorating the old Arrowhead Theatre, to be renamed “Joyland,” the “Homeland of the Silent Actors.” At this renovated theatre there would be loges at the rear of the audience that would be equipped with movable and individual chairs, and have a total seating capacity of ¡00 persons. There would also be a special box for private parties in one corner, and the newspaper emphasized that the moving picture machine would be operated from a fireproof cabinet. A couple of months later, on August 3, ¡9¡2, yet another movie house was erected at the Pike; it was called the American Theatre. In this new theatre, a player piano had been installed, and as advertisement for the theatre,\n\n24\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nan enormous electric rendering of the American flag was placed on the front of the building. As Claudine Burnett explains, on account of the great success of the American Theatre, the proprietors of the theatre, Helen and A. C. Frist, decided to build the most elaborate theatre at the time ever constructed in Long Beach. On December 25, ¡9¡2, the Fairyland Theatre opened its doors. This latest addition to Long Beach’s extravagant movie houses prided itself on its rich medieval terra cotta designs. Besides showing movies, the Fairyland Theatre would also serve as a performing arts center for live entertainment. Claudine Burnett recounts how this growing market for entertainment in Long Beach resulted in some of the businessmen at the Pike trying to control all revenues generated by the movie industry. In fact, the theatre owners at the Pike mustered enough clout in Long Beach to obtain a city ordinance forbidding commercial films to be shown anywhere in the city except in the amusement zone called the Pike. Just as Fox and Laemmle had broken Edison’s trust, however, the Los Angeles amusement magnate W. H. Clune broke the Pike’s movie privilege in Long Beach when he decided to show his film of the life of Christ at the Municipal Auditorium instead of following the city ordinance that required him to show films at the Pike. Before the businessmen with their ordinance could stop Clune, he had already advertised his film, From Manger to Cross, explaining that it would be shown at the auditorium. Of course, the theatre owners at the Pike protested, but Clune outwitted them. To win over city o‡cials, Clune announced that he would build a modern, reinforced, concrete theatre to seat a minimum of ¡,800 spectators on a site he owned at the Pike. This announcement very much pleased the city fathers. In planning his counterattack, Clune also knew the Achilles’ heel of the theatre owners —fire inspections. In addition to the bribe o›ered to city o‡cials, Clune also made a threat against the theatre owners once he had gained the favor of the city o‡cials. Clune had convinced the city to prepare fire inspections of all the movie houses in the amusement zone at the Pike.\n\nAlthough the theatre owners at the Pike had the law on their side, Clune had tricked them. Fearful of the findings of the fire inspections, the theatre owners agreed to relax the city ordinance and let Clune’s film run at the municipal auditorium.\n\nThe Edison Outpost In ¡9¡3, Long Beach was the “fastest growing city in the United States,” according to government statistics. Long Beach also prided itself on having one of the nation’s premier amusement zones. When he moved his productions westward in January ¡9¡3, Edison logically chose Long Beach as a base for his productions. According to the Daily Telegram, by March ¡9¡3 the Edison Motion Picture Company had a weekly expenditure of $3,000 to $4,000. Edison Studios in Long Beach employed 40 to 60 actors and mechanics, headed by J. Searle Dawley, one of the most reputed managers in the movie industry. The same article in the Daily Telegram calls J. Searle Dawley “one of the most thorough and artistic stage managers in the business” (Mar. 22, ¡9¡3, 2:¡). His assistant stage director, James Gordon, was an actor of note. The regular members of the company included Laura Sawyer, Jessie McAllister, Betty Harte, Sidney Ayres, Anna Dodge, Ben F. Wilson, Charles Sutton, Richard Allen, Gordon Sackville, Cy Palmer, Dick La Reno, Duane Wager, and James Gordon. One of the earliest of these productions, starring Laura Sawyer and James Gordon, was based on the Ramona story, an historical romance about early California entitled The Old Monk’s Tale. It is also interesting to note that Harold Lloyd’s first movie involved the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company and was filmed in San Diego. That movie was called The Jewels of the Madonna; Harold Lloyd performed as an extra, being paid $3 to dress up as a Yaqui Indian and carrying a tray of food to white men. In ¡9¡0 the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company was the first movie studio originating west of Chicago, but by ¡9¡3\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years\n\n25\n\narticle — as a barn that Cecil B. DeMille began renting ¡¡ months after Edison came to Long Beach. DeMille had arrived in Los Angeles sometime in December ¡9¡3, paying $75 a month to “rent” Hollywood (Callard, p. 29). Before DeMille came to rent the barn in Hollywood, Edison’s company transformed Long Beach’s barnlike structure into “the most complete motion-picture workshop on the coast and the only one of the 27 operating west of Chicago, with one exception, that is equipped with an indoor studio” (Mar. 22, ¡9¡3, 2:¡). This increased productivity in Long Beach benefited the city. The same article explains that the films became more elaborate and included a variety of stories. They depicted all sorts of historical eras, necessitating vast arrays of costumes, large numbers of horses and automobiles, and endless lists of props, “like schedule K of the tari›.” These items were being fabricated or purchased in Long Beach, thus stimulating the local economy. The actors too resided in Long Beach and spent their money in the rapidly expanding movie town. With the added security of annual contracts, House Peters.\n\nthere were already 27 film plants in operation west of Chicago. The studios were beginning to mushroom in Southern California, with Long Beach among the first and the most thriving of the locations. The previously cited article in the Daily Telegram recounts how production at the Edison studio in Long Beach was carried on relentlessly, seven days a week, “dealing with society life, scenes from early California days, events supposed to occur on [the] great northwest border, and stories of sea life.” Evidently, the Edison company had much expanded the former California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company’s facilities, transforming the studio into one of the most complete film plants, one of the rare ones that included an indoor studio. The same article states that prior to Edison’s productions in Long Beach, the Long Beach studio was nothing more than a barn. That’s also how Hollywood got started nearly a year later, according to Chris Callard’s\n\nBen Wilson.\n\n26\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nsome of the actors enjoyed top billing and international renown. Dawley, who liked to produce films with large casts, would also choose young men and women of Long Beach, however, amateurs doing work for which they could not find better pay in any other line of trade. This hiring practice also benefited the local population. In addition, Edison’s films honored the city by premiering the productions in Long Beach before sending them to New York. Not only was Long Beach producing Edison films, but the city was also the fashionable place where movie fans could see some of the newest releases before anyone else in the country. For example, one of the last movies produced by Edison in Long Beach, The Dances of the Ages, premiered at the American Theatre. The film was considered quite original for its special e›ects, “the most spectacular ever turned out at the local studio.” The Long Beach newspaper called it “poignant” and “delightfully” executed (Daily Telegram, Apr. ¡2, ¡9¡3). In April ¡9¡3, according to the Daily Telegram, the Famous Players Film Company also leased the Long Beach studios from Mr. Howland, the president of the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company. The same year Edison was leaving Long Beach, the Famous Players Film Company would be producing pictures including famous stage actors. In those early days of cinema, most legitimate stage actors considered the movies beneath them. It was a Hungarian emigrant, however, who helped change this attitude in the United States. Adolph Zukor, another Horatio Alger, like Charles Pathé before him, had worked his way up the ranks from floor sweeper to movie tycoon. Along his way to fame and fortune, Zukor had purchased the American rights of a four-reel French movie, La Reine Elizabeth, with Sarah Bernhardt in the leading role of the English monarch. Inspired by the movie’s success, Zukor established the Famous Players Film Company in partnership with Daniel Frohman. The box-o‡ce success of La Reine Elizabeth had given Zukor the idea of matching famous plays with famous players, hence the name of the new company. The Famous Players Film Company may\n\nalso have used the Long Beach studio for staging the picture plays in which many of its famous actors appeared. The first famous player to appear in Long Beach was supposed to have been John Drew (Daily Telegram, Apr. ¡2, ¡9¡3, p. ¡). However, according to Daniel Blum’s A Pictorial History of the Silent Screen (p. 27), John Drew is among the important stage stars of the period who never performed in films, afraid perhaps that such condescension would damage an otherwise respectable career on stage. Blum cites the following actors and actresses as those who refused to do films: Maude Adams, David Warfield, Julia Marlowe, Mary Mannering, Henry Miller, Eleanor Robson, Rose Stahl, and John Drew. On the other hand, Blum explains that several successful stage stars did become hits in the movies, in fact, bigger stars of the screen than of the stage, including Douglas Fairbanks, Marie Dressler, John and Lionel Barrymore, Marguerite Clark, George Arliss, Nazimova, Elsie Ferguson, Pauline Frederick, and Victor Moore. To add to the jumble and expansion going on at the Long Beach studio, the Balboa Amusement Producing Company purchased the plant in April ¡9¡3, about the same date the Daily Telegram announced that the Famous Players Film Company was leasing the site to make movies. One can imagine that these production companies sometimes shared the same facilities during this period of multiple leasings and takeovers. According to film historian Marc Wanamaker, Fred Mace, a Keystone comedian and director, had left Keystone in April ¡9¡3 to run for mayor of Los Angeles and had also purchased an interest in the Balboa Amusement Producing Company in Long Beach. Fred Mace would make comedies for Balboa, but at the time, the new Balboa company was not filming in Long Beach. According to Marc Wanamaker’s timeline for Balboa, the company had leased a tract of land adjoining the Revier studio and laboratory at Vine Street and Selma Avenue in Hollywood. This was a temporary lease, but in April ¡9¡3, Balboa was not yet filming in Long Beach. Fred Mace and his comedy company had begun work at the Revier studio. They would make\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years split reel comedies there and at the Thanhouser/Imp lot at 65¡ Fairview Avenue in East Los Angeles. Hollywood had not yet been defined, and obviously this sharing of facilities seemed to be a rather common occurrence among film companies of Los Angeles County. Therefore, in the spring of ¡9¡3, Edison would be preparing to leave the Long Beach studio, Famous Players would be filming there, and by May ¡9¡3, Fred Mace’s comedy company would be making films for Balboa, probably in Los Angeles, with some shooting in Signal Hill and at the Pike, on location in the Long Beach area. Nonetheless, by the end of ¡9¡3, Balboa would have made approximately fifty movies at its new studios in Long Beach, but only a few are identified. The few films listed below by Famous Players Film Company and Pilot Films Corporation were most probably produced in Long Beach, among other productions by various film companies shooting there in ¡9¡3: Chelsea 7750.

New evidence might prove other companies and stars worked at Long Beach during these early years. For example, Josephine Woodman, born in November ¡9¡2, has provided a photo of herself in an early Edison movie filmed in Long Beach when she appeared as a four-month-old in a Western entitled Bill’s Sweetheart. In the photo, little Josephine, wrapped in a blanket, is being held in the arms of Sydney Ayres, encircled by a crew of cowboys and one lonely cow. There is even some question whether Mary Pickford might have done work at Long Beach during this same time period. At about this time, the famous silent star left Biograph to do stage work for David Belasco once more, while also doing some films for Famous Players. Might she have also worked in Long Beach for Famous Players, then leasing the Long Beach studio? Interestingly enough, Mary Pickford was among those who attended Balboa’s Christmas gala on December 24, ¡9¡3, but this may be coincidence and may merely reflect the establishment of Long Beach as an entertainment and film production center among the numerous studios burgeoning then in Los Angeles County. Mary Pickford’s attendance at the Christmas gala at the Hotel Virginia does,\n\n28\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\nBill’s Sweetheart (Edison) ¡9¡3: Baby, Josephine Woodman, née Munger, in the arms of Sydney Ayres. The other actors are not identified (courtesy of Mrs. Josephine Woodman).\n\nhowever, raise some speculation about her possible involvement with filmmaking in Long Beach. By January ¡9¡3, Southern California was teeming with film plants; there were already forty companies in operation in Los Angeles County, with more on the way. Among the film companies and troupes in Los Angeles County, there were thirty-one companies that represented the Edison trust — Selig (four troupes), Pathé, Vitagraph, Kalem (two outfits), Essanay (two companies), Edison, Biograph, Mutual Film Company, Kay-Bee, Broncho, Keystone (two troupes), American (two companies), Thanhouser, Majestic, Film Supply Company, and Universal [Nestor (three outfits), Powers (two companies), Rex (two troupes), and Bison (two companies)]. Among the nine independent producers in California by January ¡9¡3, one could count Kinemacolor (three outfits), the Eagon (four companies), the Monopol Feature Film Company, and the Amex (American-Mexican) Company. It is not clear which of these forty companies and\n\ntroupes in Los Angeles County during this period besides Edison, Famous Players, and Biograph might have leased the established and well-equipped studio in Long Beach. One should not overlook the fact that Los Angeles County constituted the shared turf of these companies, and Long Beach had already established itself as a viable and important movie center in ¡9¡0 with the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company. There was confusion then as there is now about the parameters of Southern California’s movieland, later to be called Hollywood. Within these mobile boundaries, on February 23, ¡9¡4, the Daily Telegram of Long Beach announced that Carl Laemmle’s Universal Film Manufacturing Company, described in the article as the largest motion picture producing organization in the world, was preparing to move from its ranch site at Universal City near Los Angeles. With studios located in New York, New Jersey, and California, the Universal Company would make its new home a permanent center for the movie industry. Carl Laemmle, whose\n\n¡893–¡9¡3: The Early Years Imp Company was doing well, had founded the Universal Film Manufacturing Company on June 8, ¡9¡2. Capitalized at $2,000,000, Laemmle’s company had become the chief competitor of the Edison trust, though the Universal conglomerate was not quite two years old in February ¡9¡4 and had been started on little real cash. The removal of the studio from Los Angeles to Long Beach never occurred, but according to the Daily Telegram (Feb. 23, ¡9¡4, ¡:4), eager city fathers of Long Beach attempted every possible enticement to encourage Universal to make Long Beach its home and Long Beach waited impatiently for the bigwigs from the studio to visit Long Beach’s facilities and environs: “Local boosters for the project point out that Long Beach could o›er more than is asked in this line having hills, valleys, the mountains, the ocean, the harbor, industrial enterprises for the staging of factory scenes and many other natural resources necessary for the staging of the movies.” Secretary R. L. Bisby was expecting Universal to make the move, the visit having been delayed, most unfortunately, because of severe rain and flooding that made travel di‡cult between Los Angeles and Long Beach. Universal’s removal from Los Angeles to Long Beach was thought to be inevitable because of the expiring lease on the huge plant near Hollywood, a lease unlikely to be renewed because of the astronomical hike in fees. The new plant in Long Beach would have required a property from 600 to ¡,200 acres, along with ample areas to build stages and studios. I. Bernstein, general manager of the California studios for Universal, was handling the negotiations for Carl Laemmle, president of Universal. At the time of these negotiations, the Universal organization included the following members: Imp, Rex, Bison, Nestor, Gold Seal, Victor, Eclair, Crystal, Frontier, Powers, Joker, Animated, and Universal Ike. If this historical negotiation had succeeded, then the movie world of Southern California would have shifted from Los Angeles to Long Beach. In early ¡9¡3, Universal spent approximately $20,000 a week in Los Angeles, an annual business expenditure of $¡,000,000. Universal employed 500 people,\n\n29\n\nnot including scores of extras for the larger productions. If Universal had made the move, Long Beach would have become Hollywood by the Sea. Other auxiliary companies that normally furnish the various supplies for the movie industry would have sprung up in Long Beach with the number of jobs and tradesmen skyrocketing and payrolls soaring. The studio did not make the move, however, and it is possible that the proposed removal of the studio to Long Beach was merely a ploy to lower the lease at Universal City. Moreover, it has not yet been determined whether Universal ever made an inspection trip to Long Beach. Could it be that Long Beach failed to become the movie capital of the world only because of one bad season of winter rains? Fate is a fickle schemer. In the land of perpetual sunshine, during the winter of ¡9¡3–¡9¡4 too much rain fell on the seaside resort, which was the fastest-growing municipality in the United States and a growing entertainment and cinema center. That fateful winter season, torrential rivers overflowed, dashing the hopes of the ambitious city fathers, and the movie industry over the next decade would firmly anchor itself in the neighboring city of the angels. Nonetheless, in ¡9¡3, Long Beach remained a healthy contender among the movie plants of Los Angeles County. That year two daring and venturesome brothers would bolster the movie preeminence of Long Beach, creating for five glorious years, ¡9¡3–¡9¡8, the world’s most productive film plant, the Balboa Amusement Producing Company. In ¡9¡3, California was emerging as the film production center of the world, thanks in great part to the Balboa Studios in Long Beach. Herbert Morris Horkheimer and Elwood David Horkheimer, two brothers in Long Beach, helped make Los Angeles County the movie capital of the world. Before there was an establishment called Hollywood, Balboa was to become king of the silver screen, producing as much as 20,000 feet of negative film a week, with as many as ¡0 film companies working simultaneously, three shifts a day. At a breathtaking pace, the Horkheimer Brothers made it big-time, but they have yet to be honored for\n\n30\n\nBALBOA FILMS\n\ntheir many contributions to the cinematography arts and sciences. Fortunately, at the time of writing this book, this neglect is about to end because the Horkheimers’ accomplishments are in the process of being commemorated with the support and the involvement of various Long Beach citizens, historical and heritage societies, and fans of the arts. In due time, Balboa and the Horkheimers will find once again their proper place in movieland’s hall of fame. Claudine Burnett has written most eloquently about the “meteoric” sensation of the early movie industry in Long Beach in one of her yet unpublished manuscripts entitled “Long Beach Motion Picture Industry: ¡9¡¡–¡923”: A rare celestial spectacle occurred over the skies of Long Beach on May 23, ¡9¡0 — the appearance of Halley’s Comet and a total eclipse of the moon. Portents could be read into such an occurrence, if one was superstitious. Ancients viewed the erratic behavior of comets against the harmonious order of the heavens with awe. Combining a total eclipse of the moon with the appearance of a comet could signify that something significant was about to occur. Coincidentally, perhaps, the same year did bring something significant to Long Beach. It brought the birth of a new industry — that of motion pictures. It was an industry that was to have a prolonged e›ect on the city, as well as the world.
