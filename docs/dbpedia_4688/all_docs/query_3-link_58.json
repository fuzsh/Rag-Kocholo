These changes allow the eye to focus on objects at different distances.\n\nacetabulum\n\nAt the hip joint, the hollow on the pelvic girdle into which the head of the femur fits.\n\nacid rain\n\nRainfall that is unnaturally acidic owing to atmospheric pollution.\n\nacoustic nerve\n\nSee vestibulocochlear nerve.\n\nadaptation\n\nA genetically controlled trait that increases an individual’s fitness relative to that of other individuals. All kinds of traits—from subtle aspects of internal physiology to complicated avian behaviors—are potentially adaptations.\n\nadaptive\n\nDescribes a trait that better promotes an individual’s fitness than does some alternative form of that characteristic.\n\nadaptive (or acquired) immunity\n\nThe components of the immune system that become tailored to respond to previously encountered pathogens, usually involving antibodies that recognize and attack specific antigens on those pathogens.\n\nadaptive management\n\nA type of ecosystem management (see separate entry) in which managers continue to learn more about the ecosystem as they proceed, and continually modify their management techniques to incorporate the new information.\n\nadaptive radiation\n\nThe evolution, from a common ancestor, of a variety of different species adapted to different niches; the species usually have different morphologies and behaviors.\n\nadaptive value\n\nThe contribution of a trait to an individual’s ability to survive and reproduce.\n\nadherent cup nest\n\nA cup nest made of mud or saliva that relies on chemical forces to hold it to a vertical surface; built by many swifts, including the Edible-nest Swiftlets of Southeast Asia, whose nests are used in the Asian delicacy bird’s-nest soup.\n\nadoption\n\nIn avian biology, the peaceful acquisition of a lone chick or chicks by a pair of adults other than the biological parents.\n\nadrenal glands\n\nSmall yellow or orange endocrine glands at the cranial end of each kidney; they produce a variety of hormones (including adrenaline, steroids, and the sex hormones) that are involved with circulation, digestion, and reproduction.\n\nadvertising displays\n\nDisplays performed by one sex (usually the male) to attract a mate of the opposite sex; also called mate attraction displays.\n\naerodynamic power\n\nFor birds, the total power required to match the various forms of drag and thereby maintain flight.\n\naerodynamic valve\n\nA vortex-like movement of air within the air tubes of each avian lung, at the junction between the mesobronchus and the first secondary bronchus; it prevents the backflow of air into the mesobronchus by forcing the incoming air along the mesobronchus and into the posterior air sacs.\n\nAfrican barbets\n\nA family (Lybiidae, 42 species) of small, colorful, stocky African birds with large, sometimes serrated, beaks; they dig their nest cavities in trees, earthen banks, or termite nests.\n\nAfrotropical region\n\nZoogeographic region including Madagascar, southern Arabia, and all of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Sometimes called the Ethiopian Region.\n\nafterfeather\n\nA small feather that grows from the lower shaft of a contour feather and resembles the main feather but in miniature.\n\nage structure\n\nThe relative proportions of individuals of different ages—usually noted for a given population.\n\nage-specific fecundity\n\nThe average birth rate for females in a particular age group in a population.\n\nage-specific survival rate\n\nThe proportion of individuals in a particular age group in a population that survive a particular interval of time—usually a year.\n\nair sacs\n\nThin-walled, transparent sacs extending from the mesobronchi or the lungs to different regions of the body; they act as bellows to bring air into the body and store it until expiration. They are found only in birds.\n\nair speed\n\nA flying individual’s speed relative to the air through which it is moving. It does not include being carried along or slowed down by the wind, so it may or may not reflect a bird’s speed relative to the ground.\n\nairfoil\n\nAny structure designed to help lift or control a flying object by using the air currents through which it moves. A typical airfoil, such as the wing of a bird or airplane, is rounded on top and curved inward below.\n\nalbino\n\nAn individual that lacks the pigment melanin all over its body. An individual that lacks all types of pigments is called a complete albino.\n\nalbumen\n\nEgg white; albumen is composed primarily of water and protein.\n\nalimentary canal\n\nThe tube for the passage, digestion, and absorption of food; in most birds, it includes the esophagus, crop, two-part stomach, small intestine, ceca, and the large intestine. It is also called the gastrointestinal tract, digestive tract, or the gut.\n\nallantois\n\nIn avian biology, the extra-embryonic membrane inside the egg that forms a sac into which the developing embryo shunts all metabolic wastes that cannot evaporate through the shell, such as uric acid crystals.\n\nAllee effect\n\nThe response, shown in some species when population density falls below some threshold level, by which reproductive behavior and/or social structure become disrupted in various ways. In some circumstances, this effect may cause species to be unusually prone to extinction.\n\nalleles\n\nAlternate forms of genes. Most animals have two alleles for each trait\n\nallometric scaling\n\nChanges in the magnitude of a trait that are related to, but not directly proportional to, changes in magnitude of related traits.\n\nallopatric\n\nPopulations that occur in separate regions with no geographic overlap.\n\nallopreening\n\nMutual preening during which two birds preen each other, usually around the head and neck. In many species allopreening not only keeps the plumage clean and orderly, but also helps to establish social bonds between individuals.\n\nalpha diversity\n\nThe count of the number of species present in a single habitat or location.\n\nalpine tundra\n\nEcosystem found above the tree line on mountains; it consists of rugged, well-drained terrain interspersed with meadows with low-growing vegetation and a profusion of summer-blooming wildflowers. Very few birds breed in this harsh environment.\n\nalternate plumage\n\nIn the Humphrey-Parkes system of nomenclature, alternate plumage is the plumage worn by an adult bird during the breeding season, and is produced by a partial molt before breeding. In the traditional system, this plumage was known as the nuptial plumage or the breeding plumage. If a bird does not molt before breeding, it continues to wear its basic plumage during breeding.\n\naltitudinal migration\n\nSeasonal migration up or down mountain slopes.\n\naltricial\n\nDescribes young birds that hatch undeveloped and in many cases naked or with sparse down; such helpless young require complete parental care.\n\nalula\n\nA group of two to six feathers projecting from the phalanx of the bird’s first finger (its thumb) at the bend of the wing. It reduces turbulence by allowing fine control of airflow over the wing.\n\nAmerican Ornithologists’ Union (AOU)\n\nThe largest organization of professional ornithologists in North America; it publishes the research journal The Auk and the Check-list of North American Birds (commonly called the AOU Check-list; see separate entry).\n\namino acids\n\nA class of organic compounds that are the chief components of proteins\n\namnion\n\nIn avian biology, the extra-embryonic membrane inside the egg that becomes filled with fluid and surrounds the developing embryo, allowing it to move and stay moist, and preventing its various growing parts from sticking to or blocking one another.\n\nampulla\n\nA membranous chamber at the base of each of the three semicircular ducts in the inner ear; it contains sensory hair cells embedded in a gelatinous material and surrounded by endolymph, and it senses changes in the animal’s speed or direction in a particular plane of space. Information from all three ampullae, one in each plane of space, is combined by the brain to determine the animal’s motion and thus to aid balance.\n\nangle of attack\n\nIn a flying bird, the angle between the main surface of the wing and the oncoming airstream.\n\nanisodactyl feet\n\nFoot arrangement in which the hallux points backward and the other three toes point forward. Found in most passerines.\n\nannual survival rate\n\nSee survival rate.\n\nant-acacias\n\nVarious species of tropical and subtropical trees in the genus Acacia that harbor ants inside their hollow thorns. The ants receive shelter and extra nutrition from special substances produced by the trees exclusively for the ants, and in turn keep away insects, mammals, and other herbivores that might feed on the trees by attacking them. The ants also prevent other vegetation from growing nearby by biting off shoots as they emerge from the ground.\n\nAntarctic Convergence\n\nRegion of the oceans between about 50 and 60 degrees south latitude, where cold, north-flowing currents meet warmer, south-flowing currents, resulting in large-scale upwelling of nutrient-rich water. The nutrients support abundant plankton, which attract a great diversity and abundance of seabirds.\n\nantbirds\n\nA Neotropical suboscine family (Thamnophilidae, 197 species) of small, insectivorous, forest birds; some species specialize in the technique of following columns of army ants to prey on the insects and other arthropods stirred up by the numerous moving ants.\n\nantebrachium\n\nThe middle portion of the forelimb, consisting of the radius and ulna. The secondary feathers attach to the ulna.\n\nanterior\n\nToward the front of an organism, using the earth as a frame of reference. With birds, technically used only within the eye and inner ear. But in practice, often used interchangeably with the term cranial.\n\nanterior air sacs\n\nGeneral term referring to the air sacs nearest the bird’s front end—the cervical, clavicular, and anterior thoracic air sacs.\n\nanterior chamber\n\nSpace within the eye between the iris and the cornea; it is filled with aqueous fluid, which nourishes the eye and removes wastes.\n\nanterior lobe of the pituitary gland\n\nPortion of the pituitary gland that receives instructions from the nervous system in the form of neurohormones from the hypothalamus. As a result, the anterior lobe secretes various hormones into the blood that may act directly on organs or on other endocrine glands (such as the gonads, adrenals, and thyroids); because of this central controlling role in the endocrine system, the anterior lobe is nicknamed “the master gland.”\n\nAnthropocene\n\nThe current geological age, marked by human activity having become a dominant influence on the earth’s climate and environments.\n\nantibody\n\nA blood protein able to attach to an infectious pathogen, thereby guiding other components of the adaptive immune system to attack that pathogen.\n\nanting, active\n\nPicking up an ant or other chemically potent object, such as a millipede, and deliberately rubbing it in the feathers—presumably to deter ectoparasites.\n\nanting, passive\n\nPositioning oneself among a swarm of ants, permitting them to run all over the body and to move in and out among the feathers, presumably to deter ectoparasites.\n\nantiphonal\n\nSinging interaction in which two individuals alternate their contributions. Often used to describe duets between a male and female bird.\n\nantorbital fenestra\n\nAn opening on each side of the skull in front of the eye socket; found in all archosaurs.\n\nantpittas\n\nTogether with antthrushes, antpittas form the suboscine family Formicariidae (60 species). They are small, drab Neotropical birds with loud, ringing songs; many haunt the rain forest floor and may follow army ant swarms.\n\nantthrushes\n\nTogether with antpittas, antthrushes form the suboscine family Formicariidae (60 species). They are small, drab Neotropical birds with loud, ringing songs; many haunt the rain forest floor and may follow army ant swarms.\n\naorta\n\nThe main artery exiting the heart; its branches distribute oxygenated blood to all parts of the body.\n\naortic arch\n\nThe curve of the aorta, just after it exits the left ventricle of the heart. In birds, the aorta curves to the bird’s right as it passes dorsal to the heart and toward the backbone, but in mammals, the aorta curves to the left.\n\nAOU\n\nSee American Ornithologists’ Union.\n\nAOU Check-list\n\nBird checklist produced by the Committee on Classification and Nomenclature of the American Ornithologists’ Union; it contains common and scientific names of all birds that occur in North America north of Mexico, or near North American coasts, including Hawaii, and is the generally accepted reference for common names of North American birds.\n\naponeuroses\n\nShiny, broad sheets of connective tissue that bind muscle fibers together to form muscles.\n\naposematic\n\nHaving bright, bold colors and patterns (often reds and oranges) that advertise to potential predators that an individual is bad tasting or poisonous. A few species that are perfectly palatable also have evolved these warning colors and patterns. The strategy of sporting aposematic coloration is called aposematism.\n\naposematic coloration\n\nOften known as “warning colors,” conspicuous patterns or colors that signal to potential predators that an organism is potentially toxic or dangerous.\n\nappeasement displays\n\nDisplays given to decrease the aggression of another individual; they usually consist of stereotyped postures that de-emphasize the performer’s weapons or size and expose vulnerable parts of its body. For example, a submissive bird may point its beak down or away, fold its wings, lower or turn away its head, point its tail down, or adopt some combination of these postures.\n\nappendicular skeleton\n\nPortion of the skeleton consisting of the sternum (breast bone), the pectoral girdle including the front limbs (wings), and the pelvic girdle including the hind limbs (legs).\n\napteria (singular, apterium)\n\nRegions of bare or less-feathered skin between the feather tracts of birds.\n\naquatic birds\n\nAll birds with webbed feet that commonly swim, including the Anatidae; also, all deep-water waders belonging to the order Ciconiiformes, such as herons and storks. Also called water birds.\n\naqueous fluid\n\nA cell-free fluid, similar in structure to blood plasma; it fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye (between the lens and the cornea), providing nourishment and waste removal.\n\narachnoid\n\nThe middle of the three vascularized membranes, called meninges, surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The meninges provide sustenance and waste removal for the cells of the brain and spinal cord, which are not served by the circulatory system.\n\narboreal\n\nLiving in trees.\n\narboreal theory (of the origin of avian flight)\n\nTheory suggesting that flight originated in small, arboreal (tree-dwelling), reptile-like birds that jumped or glided among tree branches. Proponents suggest that feathers first evolved to keep the animals warmer in the cooler arboreal environment, and then were used to extend jumps or glides. First proposed in 1880 by O. C. Marsh. Also called the trees-down theory.\n\nArchaeopteryx\n\nA feathered reptile from 150-million-year-old Jurassic limestone deposits. Because it had a mosaic of bird and reptile characteristics, its relationship to modern birds and other reptiles has been highly controversial since its discovery in the early 1860s.\n\narchosaurs\n\nAll reptiles in the Archosauromorpha, the large group of diapsid reptiles that includes all thecodonts and their descendants (including birds and crocodiles), but does not include lizards, snakes, or turtles. All archosaurs have an opening on each side of the skull, in front of the eye socket, called the antorbital fenestra.\n\narctic tundra\n\nEcosystem found around the world in a belt extending north from the limit of trees; it consists of swampy flatland covered with low-growing vegetation, interrupted by countless shallow lakes. Very few birds live in the arctic tundra year round, but many migrants breed there, taking advantage of the long hours of daylight and numerous spring insects for feeding their young.\n\narctic tundra/coniferous forest ecotone\n\nTransitional zone between the arctic tundra and coniferous forest ecosystems, sometimes called the northern timberline. It consists of fingers of open, stunted spruce forest extending north between fingers of low, shrubby tundra extending south.\n\narea sensitivity\n\nRefers to bird species that are found only in habitat patches larger than some critical size.\n\narea-sensitive species\n\nSpecies for which probability of occurrence in a habitat type increases with the size of the habitat patch, hence are usually missing from the smallest patches.\n\narmy ants\n\nA subfamily of primarily tropical ants that are highly social and nomadic\n\narterioles\n\nSmall blood vessels branching from arteries. They carry blood from the arteries to the capillaries.\n\nartery\n\nA vessel conducting blood away from the heart. All arteries except the pulmonary artery carry oxygen-rich blood.\n\narticular bone\n\nBone on the upper surface of each side of the lower jaw of many vertebrates, near the caudal end; in birds, it links with the quadrate bone of the upper jaw, forming the joint between the jaws.\n\nartificial selection\n\nThe evolutionary process analogous to natural selection that results when humans are the selective agent that determines which individuals are allowed to reproduce; often this occurs when humans selectively breed individuals for desirable traits.\n\narytenoid cartilages\n\nTwo cartilages of the larynx; they stiffen and hold the shape of the fleshy folds surrounding the glottis—the opening of the larynx.\n\nAsian barbets\n\nA family (Megalaimidae, 26 species) of chunky birds slightly smaller than a Belted Kingfisher, with thick bills and gaudy, clashing colors. They are endemic to the Oriental zoogeographic region.\n\nAsities\n\nMembers (with false sunbirds) of the family Philepittidae, endemic to Madagascar. These two species of suboscine passerines feed on fruits.\n\naspect ratio\n\nThe ratio of an object’s length to its width. It is used to refer to the shape of a bird’s wing.\n\nassembly rules\n\nThe hypothesis that competition among species creates possible and impossible combinations of particular species within biological communities.\n\nasynchronous hatching\n\nPattern of hatching in which the eggs of a single clutch hatch over a period of several days, resulting in a brood of young of different ages. This pattern occurs when incubation begins at the time the first egg is laid. Because eggs are laid one per day, at one- to two-day intervals, the embryos of the earliest-laid eggs have already started to develop by the time the later eggs are laid, and they hatch sooner.\n\natlas\n\nThe first cervical vertebra; in birds, it articulates with the single occipital condyle on the base of the skull. (Mammals have two occipital condyles.)\n\natria (singular, atrium)\n\nThe two thin-walled, anterior chambers of the heart; they receive blood returning to the heart from the lungs (left atrium) or body (right atrium).\n\natrioventricular valve\n\nThe valve between each atrium and its corresponding ventricle; it prevents the backflow of blood into the atrium as the ventricle contracts.\n\natrophy\n\nTo shrivel or die back; may be pathological or part of the normal course of development.\n\nattentive periods\n\nIn avian biology, periods spent on the nest during incubation.\n\nauditory nerve\n\nSee vestibulocochlear nerve.\n\nauditory tube\n\nAir-filled tube leading from the middle ear to the throat; it helps to equalize the air pressure on the two sides of the eardrum. In birds, the right and left tubes join and enter the caudal roof of the mouth through just one opening. In mammals, the right and left tubes enter the mouth separately. Also called eustachian tube.\n\nauricular feathers\n\nA patch of feathers covering the external ear opening. Their open texture protects the ear from debris and wind noise, yet helps to channel sounds into the ear.\n\naustral migration\n\nRefers to seasonal migration in the southern hemisphere, in which birds typically move north in Fall and south in Spring.\n\nAustralasian region\n\nOne of the major zoogeographic regions of the world, stretching from a line termed “Wallace’s Line” east of the islands of Timor and Sulawesi in Indonesia, southwest to New Zealand, and including New Guinea, Australia, Hawaii, and other islands of the mid-Pacific Ocean. Sometimes called the Australian region.\n\nAustralasian robins\n\nA family (Eopsaltriidae, 44 species) of songbirds endemic to the Australasian region. Reminiscent of both New and Old World robins in coloration, they actually are more like flycatchers, although they usually snatch food from the ground.\n\nautonomic nervous system\n\nA set of nerves considered as a group because of their similar functions. Acting primarily unconsciously, they innervate the smooth muscle of the viscera, glands, and blood vessels, thus controlling the automatic function of the internal organs. They are under direct chemical control from substances circulating in the blood.\n\navifauna\n\nThe set of bird species living in a region.\n\naxial skeleton\n\nThe portion of the skeleton consisting of the skull, hyoid apparatus, and the vertebral column of the neck, trunk, and tail.\n\naxillaries\n\nA cluster of feathers in the bird’s “armpit”; they are recognizably longer than those lining the wing.\n\naxis\n\nThe second cervical vertebra.\n\naxon\n\nThe cable-like, impulse-conducting, main axis of a neuron.\n\nB\n\nB cells\n\nSpecial white blood cells found in the lymphatic tissues; they are important in the immune response because they produce antibodies. B cells are produced by the cloacal bursa and are also important in understanding the development of AIDS in humans.\n\nbabblers\n\nA diverse family (Timaliidae, 267 species) of gregarious, insectivorous birds, many of which have complex social systems and breed cooperatively. They are found in the Afrotropical, Oriental, and Australasian regions.\n\nback\n\nIn birds, the dorsal side of the body, between the neck and the rump.\n\nbarbicels (or hooklets)\n\nTiny hooks on the barbules that allow them to attach to adjacent barbules, thereby forming the flat surface of a feather vane.\n\nbarbs\n\nThe parallel branches extending from each side of the rachis of the feather shaft; collectively they form the vanes.\n\nbarbules\n\nBranchlets coming off both sides of the barbs of a feather, at right angles to the barbs and in the same plane. Adjacent barbules hook together, holding the vane intact.\n\nbasal archosaurs\n\nSee thecodonts.\n\nbasal metabolism (metabolic rate)\n\nThe number of calories an organism uses when completely at rest, which indicates the amount of energy needed to maintain minimal body functions.\n\nbasic plumage\n\nIn the Humphrey-Parkes system of nomenclature, the plumage worn by an adult bird for the longest time each year; it usually is produced by a complete molt. In the traditional system, this plumage was known as the nonbreeding or winter plumage. If a bird does not molt before breeding, it continues to wear its basic plumage during breeding.\n\nbasilar papilla\n\nThe lower membrane of the cochlear duct in the inner ear of birds; it is coated with a layer of sensory hair cells. Sound waves set the basilar papilla into motion, causing the hair cells to push against the tectorial membrane, triggering nerve impulses in the hair cells that are sent to the brain in the process of sound perception. In mammals, the corresponding structure is called the “basilar membrane.”\n\nBBS\n\nSee Breeding Bird Survey.\n\nbeak\n\nA bird’s upper and lower jaws, including the external covering; also called the bill.\n\nbee-eaters\n\nAn Old World family (Meropidae, 26 species) of brightly colored birds with long, slender beaks.They catch stinging insects in a manner similar to that of flycatchers, and then beat them to remove the stingers before eating them.\n\nbehavioral isolation\n\nA form of reproductive isolation involving incompatibilities in behavior that prevent the interbreeding of two populations. These can include behaviors involved in recognizing members of the same species, specialized courtship displays, or any other behaviors necessary for successful mating.\n\nbelly\n\nIn birds, part of the lower (ventral) surface of the body between the breast and the vent.\n\nbend of the wing\n\nThe prominent angle at the wrist, where the bird’s wing bends noticeably.\n\nbenefits of philopatry hypotheses\n\nA set of possible explanations for why certain individual birds might forego their own breeding in a particular breeding season and act as helpers at the nest of other breeding pairs (usually their parents or other close relatives); the benefits of philopatry hypotheses focus on the possible benefits to young adults of remaining with their parents. Examples of these hypotheses include (1) the survival of young adults may be improved when they remain in a group, (2) by helping, young adults may improve the survival of close relatives (and thus increase their own indirect fitness), and (3) by staying with their parents, young adults may increase their own chance of acquiring a superior territory, either by monitoring vacancies in neighboring sites or by inheriting their natal territory.\n\nBergmann’s rule\n\nRule describing the pattern of body sizes found within most bird and mammal species, in that individuals living in colder regions tend to be larger than those living in warmer areas.\n\nBernoulli’s law\n\nPhysical law stating that static and dynamic pressure must always add up to a constant. Because the airflow over a moving airfoil (such as a bird’s wing) is faster above than below, the dynamic pressure is higher and thus the static pressure is lower. Because the static pressure below the wing is higher than that above, lift is created and the bird can remain aloft.\n\nbeta diversity\n\nThe accumulation of species that results as a sampled area includes greater number of habitats, each with some species found only in that habitat.\n\nbiconical\n\nDescribes an egg that is slightly longer than subelliptical; also called fusiform or long subelliptical.\n\nbile\n\nSubstance produced by the liver that emulsifies fats to facilitate their digestion. In birds with no gall bladder, bile is released directly into the small intestine through the hepatoenteric ducts; in birds with a gall bladder (and mammals), bile is stored in the gall bladder and released through the bile ducts.\n\nbill\n\nA bird’s upper and lower jaws, including the external covering; also called the beak.\n\nbill tip organ\n\nAn aggregation of sensory cells at the tip of both the upper and lower beak, best developed in ducks, geese, sandpipers, and snipe; it is thought to sense tactile stimuli during feeding.\n\nbill-wiping\n\nA maintenance behavior in which a bird swipes its bill sideways on tree branches, the ground, or other surfaces, especially after eating messy foods such as oily insects or suet.\n\nbinocular vision\n\nA type of vision that produces three-dimensional images, in contrast to monocular vision, which produces flat images. Binocular vision results when the eyes are positioned toward the front of the head, so that objects are detected by both eyes simultaneously.\n\nbinomial name\n\nA naming system in biology in which each species is assigned a unique name consisting of two parts, the name of the genus and the name of the species, as in the scientific name of the House Sparrow, Passer domesticus.\n\nbinomial nomenclature\n\nThe currently accepted system of naming organisms, devised by Linnaeus, in which each species is designated by two words\n\nbioaccumulation\n\nThe increase in the concentration of toxic or other foreign substances in organisms’ bodies as a result of taking up the substances from the environment (through plant roots, or in ingested food or water) at a rate higher than that at which they are excreted from the body. Many toxic substances that do not occur naturally, such as DDT and PCBs, are readily deposited in body tissues but excreted at very slow rates, because organisms have not evolved mechanisms to metabolize them effectively.\n\nbioconcentration\n\nThe step-wise increase, found at each higher level of the food chain, in the concentration of certain chemicals in the bodies of organisms. Chemicals that usually bioconcentrate in the food chain are those toxins, such as DDT, that tend to accumulate (see bioaccumulation) in organisms because they are taken up from the environment faster than they are excreted.

Broadbills use their wide, flat, colorful bills to snatch up large insects.\n\nbroad-front migration\n\nA pattern in which the migrating individuals of a species are spread across a wide area rather than concentrated into narrower flyways.\n\nbronchi (singular, bronchus)\n\nThe two major air tubes branching off the lower end of the trachea; one goes into each lung.\n\nbrood parasite\n\nA bird that lays eggs in the nests of other species, leaving the resulting young to be raised entirely by the host parents. Some species parasitize others only occasionally; others, called obligate brood parasites, never build their own nests, and lay all their eggs in other species’ nests.\n\nbrood parasitism\n\nAny situation in which a female bird lays its eggs in the nest of another individual of the same or different species.\n\nbrood patch\n\nA patch of skin on the breast and belly of birds that has lost feathers and become swollen through both the retention of large amounts of water in the tissues and the expansion of blood vessels feeding the skin. It develops a few days before egg laying in most individual birds (either male or female) that incubate their eggs by sitting on them, and increases the efficiency of heat transfer to the eggs. One large patch or several smaller ones may develop, depending on the species.\n\nbrood reduction\n\nPractice carried out by some parent birds whose young hatch asynchronously and thus vary in size, in which the parents first feed the most vigorously begging offspring until it can swallow no more, and then move on to another. Thus, in years with low food supplies only the largest and strongest young will survive, but in years with abundant food smaller young will survive as well. Brood reduction ensures that at least some young will survive in years when food is scarce.\n\nbrooding\n\nSitting on hatched young, or sheltering them under the wings, primarily to keep them warm, but also to protect them from sun, rain, or predators.

In dense forests, the canopy receives most of the sunlight and thus has the greatest productivity. The tallest trees that stick above the main canopy, somewhat like “lollipops,” are not considered part of the canopy; they are called the emergent layer.\n\ncapillaries\n\nThe smallest blood vessels. Within all body tissues except the epidermis and those in the central nervous system, capillaries form networks called capillary beds, which connect the arterioles and venules. The thin walls of the capillaries allow materials to be exchanged between the blood and the body cells—the body cells absorb oxygen from the blood, and the blood takes up wastes from the body cells.\n\ncapillary bed\n\nSee capillaries.\n\ncardiac muscle\n\nA special type of smooth muscle that forms the bulk of the heart.

The central foveae provide sharp monocular views of the areas to the sides of the bird.\n\ncentral nervous system (CNS)\n\nThe brain and spinal cord.\n\ncentrum\n\nThe main body, or central axis, of a vertebra; the anterior end of the centrum connects to the preceding vertebra, and the posterior end connects to the following vertebra.\n\ncere\n\nA leathery band of skin covering the base of the bill, into which the nostrils open; presumably the cere protects the nostrils. Present only in certain birds, such as hawks, pigeons, and some parrots.\n\ncerebellum\n\nA large, deeply folded structure on the dorsal surface of the hindbrain, attached to the brain stem by two pairs of stout neural tracts; it controls muscular coordination and plays an important role in balance, posture, and proprioception. The cerebellum of birds is particularly large, due to the demands of flight.\n\ncerebral hemispheres\n\nThe two large, smooth lobes on the dorsal anterior region of the forebrain; together they form the cerebrum, which coordinates and controls complex behaviors, including memory and learning. In mammals, these lobes have folds and grooves.\n\ncerebrum\n\nSee cerebral hemispheres.\n\ncervical air sacs\n\nA pair of air sacs—one sac on each side of the body—located in the neck region of birds; one sac usually extends from each lung, but sometimes a series of cervical sacs are located along the neck, as in geese.\n\ncervical enlargement\n\nA swelling along the spinal cord at the level of the wings, associated with the brachial plexus.\n\ncervical vertebrae\n\nThe vertebrae of the neck region; birds have uniquely shaped centrum ends of their cervical vertebrae (see heterocoelous centrum ends).\n\nchalazae\n\nIn avian biology, the gelatinous, usually milky white, stringy coils of albumen (egg white) that surround and protect the egg yolk, and are visible at either end of the yolk as twisted cords. The chalazae attach to the far ends of the eggshell and form a suspension system for the yolk that allows it to rotate throughout embryonic development.\n\nchannelization\n\nThe process by which humans deepen and straighten natural streams, converting them into water-filled ditches. Theoretically channelization controls flooding along the stream, but it destroys the stream ecosystem and often increases flooding downstream.\n\nchaparral\n\nNorth American ecosystem found on the low hillsides of southwestern California; it consists of dense stands of broad-leaved evergreen shrubs, dominated by chamise and manzanita.

The CAM is richly invested with blood capillaries, and together with the pores in the eggshell, it allows the embryo to carry out gas exchange as it receives oxygen from outside the egg and expels carbon dioxide.\n\nchorion\n\nIn avian biology, the extra-embryonic membrane inside the egg that surrounds the entire avian embryo and the other three extra-embryonic membranes (the allantois, amnion, and yolk sac). It is homologous (evolutionarily related) to the mammalian membrane, also called the chorion, which forms much of the placenta in most mammals.\n\nchoroid\n\nThe middle layer of the three main layers of the eye; it lies just inside the sclera. It is pigmented and forms the iris and ciliary processes.\n\nChristmas Bird Count (CBC)\n\nA count of the wintering birds of North America conducted each year since 1900 and coordinated by the National Audubon Society. Observers count as many individual birds as possible within one of the circular count areas 15 miles (24 km) in diameter that are scattered across North America and beyond. Observers record their time spent and distance covered, so the numbers of birds seen can be adjusted for observer effort. The data can be used to track winter bird distribution and abundance, as well as long-term population trends.\n\nchromosomes\n\nLong strands of DNA found in the nuclei of most cells. Each section of the chromosome (a specific sequence of nucleotides) that codes for a specific protein is called a gene.\n\nciliary muscles\n\nMuscles that, in birds, attach to the ciliary processes, which attach to the lens of the eye. When the ciliary muscles contract, they move the ciliary processes, which squeeze the lens and make it become more round. In mammals, ciliary muscle contraction relaxes the lens, allowing it to become round by elastic rebound.\n\nciliary processes\n\nStructures of the choroid of the eye that attach to the lens and hold it in place. Ciliary muscles move the ciliary processes, which in turn move the lens, changing its shape. Only in birds do the processes attach directly to the lens.\n\ncircadian rhythms\n\nDaily cycles of behavioral and physiological events exhibited by organisms; they are regulated by an internal biological clock and persist even when organisms are kept under constant environmental conditions. Examples include daily patterns of activity, body temperature, or nectar production.\n\ncircannual rhythms\n\nCycles of behavior, growth, or other physiological activities that occur on approximately a yearly basis; like circadian rhythms, they are regulated by an internal biological clock and persist even when organisms are kept under constant environmental conditions.

Communities also can be defined as containing only certain types of species in one location, such as a forest bird community or a stream insect community.\n\ncompetitive exclusion principal\n\nRule stating that no two species can occupy exactly the same ecological niche in a community; if they did, then eventually one would outcompete the other and cause it to go extinct.\n\ncomplete albino\n\nAn individual lacking all types of pigments in the plumage, eyes, and skin.\n\ncomplete molt\n\nA type of molt in which the entire feather coat is replaced.\n\nconchae\n\nTwo thin, scroll-like structures (one median, one anterior) extending from the lateral wall of each nasal cavity; they are covered with a mucus-secreting membrane that contains the nerve endings of the olfactory nerves, which sense odors. The mucus traps dust, and blood vessels in the membrane warm the inhaled air.\n\ncones\n\nOne of the two kinds of light-sensitive cells lining the retina of the eye; they are responsible for visual acuity (due to their tight packing) and for sensing color information (via four or five pigments and specialized oil droplets in birds), but are not very sensitive to low light levels. When light energy stimulates a cone cell, it sends a nerve impulse to the brain via the optic tract.\n\nconical\n\nSee pyriform.\n\nconiferous forest\n\nEcosystem of colder parts of the temperate zone, where there is sufficient moisture to support a forest; cone-bearing trees, especially spruce and fir, dominate the vegetation.

In birds, if the helpers assist with incubation or care of nestlings, they are called “helpers at the nest” (see separate entry).\n\ncooperative foraging\n\nA technique in which a group of individuals work together to obtain prey. For example, American White Pelicans may swim in a line or semicircle and beat their wings to drive schools of fish into shallow water. Other pelicans, cormorants, and mergansers, among others, forage cooperatively some of the time. Also called social foraging.\n\ncopulation-solicitation display\n\nA stereotyped posture adopted by female birds that indicates their readiness to copulate.\n\ncoracoids\n\nStrong, stout, paired bones of a bird’s pectoral girdle; they are not present in mammals. During flight the coracoids function as a powerful brace holding the shoulder joint, and thus the wing, away from the body while the pectoral muscles pull on the wing in the opposite direction.\n\ncorcoracids\n\nThe two members of the passerine (oscine) family Corcoracidae—the blackbird-like White-winged Chough and the smaller, seed-eating Apostlebird. These large, Australian cooperative breeders range over agricultural fields in huge flocks when not breeding.\n\ncore area\n\nThe portion of a large, continuous habitat, such as a forest, that is far from the edges and thus is suitable to host species that would be adversely affected if forced to live near the edges.\n\ncornea\n\nThe transparent anterior surface of the sclera; it allows light to enter the eye.\n\ncoronary arteries\n\nArteries (usually two) arising from the first part of the aorta; they carry blood that nourishes and supplies oxygen to the heart muscle itself.\n\ncoronary veins\n\nVeins that carry deoxygenated blood and wastes from the muscle tissue forming the heart back into the right atrium of the heart.\n\ncorpuscles\n\nAn alternate name for blood cells.\n\ncorridors\n\nIn conservation biology, long, narrow areas of wildlife habitat that connect larger areas, thus allowing individuals to move between the larger areas.\n\ncountercurrent exchange system\n\nA system in which two fluids (liquids or gases) flow adjacent to one another, but in opposite directions, while heat energy or materials move passively from one to the other, from higher to lower temperature or from higher to lower concentration. An example is the countercurrent heat-exchange system located in the legs of many gulls and waterfowl\n\ncountercurrent heat exchange\n\nIn birds, the direct exchange of heat between warm outgoing blood (such as that travelling to the feet in arteries) to adjacent returning cold blood (such as that returning from the feet in veins) that helps retain heat within the body.\n\ncountershading\n\nA type of coloration in which an organism is darker on top than below; countershading provides camouflage by reducing the contrast between the top and shadowed underside of an organism so that it appears less three-dimensional.\n\ncountersinging\n\nInteraction in which two birds sing back and forth to each other, alternating their songs.\n\ncoursers\n\nTogether with pratincoles, form the family Glareolidae (17 species). These slender, plover-like ground nesters live in open areas in tropical parts of the Old World, and sometimes cool their eggs or young by partially burying them in sand or by bringing water to the nest in their breast feathers.\n\ncourting nests\n\nNests, usually unlined, produced by male Winter Wrens and some male Marsh Wrens to attract females. A male may build a number of courting nests on his territory. In Marsh Wrens, females may add a lining and lay eggs in the courting nest of their chosen mate.\n\ncourtship displays\n\nDisplays performed for the opposite sex to acquire a mate of the same species, maintain a pair bond, and/or stimulate and synchronize breeding behavior.\n\ncourtship feeding\n\nA behavior in which one member of a pair (usually the male) presents his potential partner with food during courtship or before mating. The food item is sometimes termed a “nuptial gift” and this behavior is an important part of pair bonding in some bird species.\n\ncoverts\n\nThe smaller feathers that partly overlie the flight feathers of the wing and tail at their bases, like evenly spaced shingles on a roof. For more information, see specific types.\n\ncowbirds\n\nSix species of dark, slender, medium-sized birds that forage on seeds and insects; they are members of the New World family Icteridae (blackbirds and New World orioles). All species except the Bay-winged Cowbird are obligate brood parasites\n\ncracticids\n\nMembers of a distinctive family (Cracticidae, 10 species) of songbirds endemic to Australasia. They have stout, straight beaks; loud, melodic calls; and a generalist, crow-like diet of small vertebrates, eggs, insects, and fruits. Cracticids include butcherbirds, currawongs, and the Australasian Magpie.\n\ncranial\n\nToward the head. In practice, may be used interchangeably with anterior (but see separate entry).\n\ncranial kinesis\n\nThe ability of the bird’s upper jaw (upper beak) to move upward at the same time that the lower jaw (lower beak) is depressed, an action permitted by the highly flexible craniofacial hinge.\n\ncranial nerves\n\nTwelve sets of paired nerves, each with a specific function, serving the head, neck, and thorax region. Most exit from the medulla oblongata of the brain.\n\ncranial vena cavae\n\nTwo large veins (right and left) that gather deoxygenated blood from large veins coming from the wings, head, and neck and deliver it to the right atrium of the heart.\n\ncraniofacial hinge\n\nFlexible joint where the upper beak connects to the rest of the skull. Also called the nasal-frontal hinge.\n\ncranium\n\nThe part of the skull enclosing the brain; the braincase.\n\ncreche\n\nAn assemblage of the still-dependent young of two or more (usually many) breeding females, attended by one or more adults. Bird species whose young form creches include some pelicans, flamingos, geese, penguins, parrots, jays, and terns; creches of King Penguins and Emperor Penguins may contain several thousand young. Creche formation allows some birds (notably penguins) to conserve energy. It also may decrease predation on the young, and may free parents to spend time foraging in distant areas, thereby allowing them to bring more food back for the young and to prepare themselves for the next breeding.\n\ncrepuscular\n\nActive at dawn and dusk.\n\ncrest\n\nTuft of feathers on the peak of the head that either stick up or can be raised.\n\ncricoid cartilages\n\nTwo major cartilages that make up the sides and floor of the larynx. Also called the laryngeal cartilages.\n\ncrop\n\nA dilation of the lower esophagus that stores food; it is found in many birds that eat dry seeds or fruit containing seeds.\n\ncrop milk\n\nMilk-like substance produced by pigeons and doves; it is composed of fluid-filled cells sloughed from the lining of the crop and is regurgitated to feed to nestlings. Crop milk is high in lipids and vitamins A and B, and has a greater protein and fat content than human or cow milk. Also called pigeon’s milk.\n\ncross-fostering\n\nIn avian conservation, the practice of using surrogate parents (sometimes of a different species) to raise the young of the species being conserved.\n\ncross-fostering experiments\n\nStudies in which young of one species are placed with host “parents” of another species, who then rear their “adopted” young.\n\ncrown\n\nThe top of the head.\n\ncrown group\n\nA special type of monophyletic group (i.e., clade) that includes all organisms descended from the last common ancestor of all living members of a larger clade.\n\nCRP\n\nSee Conservation Reserve Program.\n\ncrus\n\nThe lower leg; in birds, supported by the tibiotarsus bone.\n\ncrypsis\n\nPatterning or coloration that allows a bird to remain concealed by blending in to its environment.\n\ncuckoo\n\nGeneral term for birds in the large family Cuculidae. The nearly 50 species of Old World cuckoos are in subfamily Cuculinae, and are all obligate brood parasites. The familiar two-note chime of the cuckoo-clock mimics the song of one of these species—the Common Cuckoo of Eurasia. In the New World, cuckoos are in two subfamilies, Coccyzinae, whose members, all nonparasitic, are termed “New World Cuckoos” and include the Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Black-billed Cuckoo, and Mangrove Cuckoo of North America; and Neomorphinae (the neomorphine cuckoos), whose members are all Neotropical and include three species that are obligate brood parasites.\n\nCuckoo-Roller\n\nA crow-sized, arboreal bird with a stout, broad bill; it is the only member of its family (Leptosomatidae) and is found only in Madagascar.\n\ncuckoo-shrikes\n\nA diverse group of arboreal songbirds, many of which have a shrike-like bill and are slender and (in some cases) barred like cuckoos; however, they are related to neither group. Together with minivets and trillers, they make up the family Campephagidae, found in the warmer parts of the Old World.\n\ncup nest\n\nA nest in the shape of a cup, usually constructed of mud, or small twigs and dried grass, with a depression in the center to hold the eggs; built by the majority of bird species.\n\ncursorial\n\nAdapted for running.\n\ncursorial theory (of the origin of avian flight)\n\nA theory suggesting that the ancestors of birds evolved to fly by first running along the ground, and then by jumping and leaping, which was augmented by the evolution of wings and feathers, which eventually led to full flight. First proposed by Samuel Williston in 1879. Also called the “Ground-Up Theory.”\n\ncytoplasm\n\nThe contents of a cell outside the nucleus but within the cell membrane.\n\nD\n\ndabbling\n\nA foraging technique in which a bird moves the beak rapidly on the surface of shallow water to pick up small aquatic animals and plant materials; it is used by “dabbling ducks” and a few other species.\n\ndabbling ducks\n\nDucks (such as Mallards, teal, wigeon, and pintails) that feed by dabbling on the water’s surface, in contrast to diving ducks, which dive under water to search for plant material or aquatic organisms. Dabbling ducks also may tip “bottom up” and reach down under the water to obtain submerged food. Also called puddle ducks.\n\ndark meat\n\nSee red fibers.\n\nDarwin’s Finches\n\nSee Galapagos Finches.\n\ndawn chorus\n\nThe great amount of bird song heard around dawn. At this time the largest number of bird species are singing, and they sing more frequently, and often more energetically and with more variety than at other times of the day. Why birds sing most at dawn, and in different ways than they sing during the day, is not known.\n\ndawn song\n\nBird song usually given only during the early morning hours; it differs from a species’ normal daytime song.\n\nDDE\n\nA stable, persistent, toxic organic compound (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene) formed in the body by the metabolism of the organic pesticide DDT (see separate entry). DDE accumulates in fatty tissues and is excreted very slowly, and when concentrations become high it can cause death or other toxic effects such as reproductive failure resulting from eggshell thinning (due to the disruption of calcium metabolism). Thin eggshells severely decreased reproductive success in North American raptors in the 1950s and 1960s, causing populations of most raptor species to plummet.\n\nDDT\n\nAn organic pesticide (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) used commonly in the United States from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s to control Mexican boll weevils, gypsy moths, mosquitoes, and other insect pests. DDT is highly persistent in the environment and is taken in by organisms and converted to DDE, a toxic compound that accumulates in fatty tissues and is excreted very slowly. DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, but is still used in other countries, including Argentina, Belize, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Mexico. See DDE for more information.\n\ndeath rate\n\nThe number of individuals in a species or population that die in a given period of time; also called the mortality rate.\n\ndeciduous\n\nDescribing trees or shrubs that lose their leaves during part of the year. They generally drop their leaves during the drier season (which in the temperate zone is winter) to conserve moisture, which might otherwise be lost through evaporation.\n\ndecomposers\n\nLevel in a food chain or web that consists of organisms (such as earthworms, fungi, and bacteria) that eat dead organisms and waste products, breaking them down into basic nutrients (such as oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and returning them to the soil for plants to use.\n\ndecurved\n\nCurved downward. Used to describe beaks such as that of the White Ibis.\n\ndeferent ducts\n\nHighly convoluted tubes (also called vasa deferentia) that carry sperm from the testes to (in birds) the cloaca; in birds, the lower portion of each is enlarged to form a temporary storage receptacle for sperm.\n\ndefinitive plumages\n\nAny of the plumages of a fully mature bird; they may change seasonally, but do not change from year to year as the bird ages. Some species, such as gulls, large raptors, and pelagic seabirds, take several years to reach their definitive plumage.\n\ndeflective coloration\n\nConspicuous markings found on otherwise cryptically colored organisms; on birds, these markings show only in flight or when they are flashed. They may have antipredator or social functions.\n\ndelayed plumage maturation\n\nA situation found in some species, in which one sex remains in subadult plumage longer than the other sex.\n\ndemography\n\nThe statistical study of the size and composition of populations, either at one time or as these factors change over space and time.\n\ndendrites\n\nRootlet-like extensions from the cell body of a neuron; they usually receive nerve impulses across a synapse from other nerve cells, but may transmit them as well.\n\ndens\n\nThe upwardly projecting knob or peg of the axis (second cervical vertebra); it fits into a hole in the ventral surface of the atlas (first cervical vertebra).\n\ndensity\n\nSee population density.\n\ndensity compensation\n\nAn extreme form of density inflation in which the total number of individual birds in a setting with low species diversity (such as an island) equals the number of individuals in an analogous setting with high bird species diversity (such as a nearby continent); for this to occur, one or more species must be extremely abundant in the low diversity habitat.\n\ndensity inflation\n\nA pattern in which a species increases in abundance in locations where competitor species are not found.\n\ndensity-dependent diversification\n\nThe somewhat controversial concept of a feedback loop in which speciation within a group slows down over time as the number of species increases, since the presence of existing species blocks opportunities for new species to arise.\n\ndensity-dependent factor\n\nA factor that regulates population density in such a way that the magnitude of its effect is determined by the population density. For example, population density is decreased by disease, which has a greater and greater effect as population density increases and thus rates of disease transmission go up. Other density-dependent factors include predation, parasite levels, and competition for resources.\n\ndensity-independent factor\n\nA factor that affects population density in such a way that the magnitude of its effect does not depend on the population density. Examples include severe weather, natural disasters, and the failure of food supplies.\n\ndentary\n\nIn birds, the bone forming each side of the lower beak.\n\ndeoxygenated blood\n\nBlood whose red blood cells carry very little oxygen. Also called oxygen-poor blood, it is found in all veins except the pulmonary vein.\n\ndepolarizing material\n\nA substance that can be used to take a polarized light beam and vibrate it in all directions, creating waves of all orientations, to form an unpolarized beam.\n\ndermal papilla\n\nThe portion of a feather papilla formed from dermal tissue; blood vessels extend from the dermal papilla into the developing feather, providing nourishment. This core of tissue remains in a feather follicle throughout a bird’s life, ready to aid each round of feather development after a feather is lost.\n\ndermis\n\nThe inner layer of the skin; it lies just beneath the epidermis and contains blood vessels, muscles, and nerves.\n\ndescending aorta\n\nThe continuation of the aorta (after it exits the heart and curves) down through the body and toward the tail.\n\ndeterminate layers\n\nBird species that will not lay additional (replacement) eggs if one or more are removed from a clutch during laying. Most determinate layers will lay a new clutch if the entire clutch is destroyed, however. For comparison, see indeterminate layers.\n\ndeterministic\n\nIn biology, describes events whose occurrence and/or outcomes are inevitable, based on a certain set of starting conditions. For comparison, see stochastic.\n\ndialect\n\nA geographic cluster of similar vocalizations (bird song, human speech, or the sounds of other animals) that is a consequence of those vocalizations being learned. Dialects may exist over very small or very large areas, depending on the details of dispersal and learning.\n\ndiapsid\n\nDescribes a condition in which the skull has two openings on each side in the temporal region, posterior to the eye socket. Diapsid skulls have this arrangement, and diapsid reptiles are those reptiles that have diapsid skulls—including thecodonts and their descendants (including birds and crocodiles), snakes, and lizards. Turtles are the only living group of reptiles that are not diapsids.\n\ndifferential exploitation\n\nA situation in which direct interactions among two or more individuals that seek the same resources are avoided because the individuals use the resources in slightly different ways or use slightly different resources. Differential exploitation may result from the evolution of either morphological or behavioral differences among individuals.\n\ndilution effect\n\nThe idea that ecological communities with higher species diversity are more resistant to the spread of pathogens, since there are usually fewer individuals of each particular host species in a high diversity community.\n\ndilution effect hypothesis\n\nThe idea that colonial breeding may benefit individuals because their large numbers can overwhelm the consumption capacity of local predators.\n\ndinosaur theory (of bird evolution)\n\nThe theory that birds evolved from theropods such as Compsognathus approximately 150 million years ago (proposed by Thomas Huxley in 1868) or from Dromaeosaurs such as Deinonychus approximately 110 to 120 million years ago (proposed by John Ostrom in 1973).\n\ndiopter adjustment ring\n\nThe ring on binoculars, usually on one of the eyepieces but sometimes on the hinge post, that allows the eyepieces to be focused independently to make up for the differences in visual acuity between an individual’s two eyes.\n\ndip angle\n\nThe angle at which the magnetic field lines around the earth contact the earth. The dip angle is 0 degrees at the magnetic equator, and approaches 90 degrees near the magnetic poles.\n\ndirect benefits hypothesis\n\nOne possible explanation for why females of some species choose the males with the most elaborate ornaments (such as ornate plumage) to copulate with. The explanation applies primarily to females choosing nonpaternal sexual partners, either (1) males for extrapair copulations, or (2) mates in species in which males do not provide parental care or other resources for their offspring (such as territories with food or nesting sites). The direct benefits hypothesis suggests that females may choose the most ornamented males because they are least likely to infect the females with mites, a disease, or some other affliction. Thus the female gains reproductive advantages because her health is not diminished by her mate choice.\n\ndirect fitness\n\nAn individual’s direct fitness is the portion of its genes that is transferred into the next generation (and beyond) through the production of its own offspring. This contrasts with indirect fitness, which is the portion transferred as a result of an individual’s blood relatives producing offspring.\n\ndisjunct range\n\nA range of a species or population that is not continuous, but rather is divided into geographically separate areas.\n\ndispersal\n\nThe movement of an individual bird from one breeding site to another.\n\ndisplacement activities\n\nBehaviors or actions that seem irrelevant or inappropriate to the current situation. For example, a Herring Gull may stop to preen in the middle of a territorial conflict. Ethologists hypothesize that displacement activities occur because of conflicting motivations or indecision. Some displacement activities have become exaggerated and ritualized into displays.\n\ndisruptive coloration\n\nA type of cryptic coloration with patches, streaks, or other bold patterns of color that break up the shape of the organism, catching the eye and distracting the observer from recognizing the whole organism.\n\ndistal\n\nAway from the center of the body (fingers are distal to the elbow) or from the origin of the structure (the tip of a feather is distal to its base—where it is attached).\n\ndistraction displays\n\nDisplays in which a bird or other animal feigns injury or in some other way creates a highly noticeable fuss or disturbance, in order to shift attention away from the bird’s young. For example, Killdeer give a broken-wing distraction display by dragging and flapping one wing and uttering distress calls, while slowly fluttering along the ground away from young.\n\ndiurnal\n\nActive during daylight.\n\ndivergent evolution\n\nA type of evolution in which different populations of the same species become increasingly distinct from one another over many generations (due to exposure to different ecological factors), eventually diverging into two or more new species.\n\ndiversity gradient\n\nA consistent change in species richness along some environmental gradient.\n\ndiving ducks\n\nDucks (such as Canvasbacks, Redheads, scaup, and goldeneyes) that feed by diving under the water’s surface to obtain aquatic plants or animals, in contrast to dabbling ducks, which remain at the water’s surface.\n\ndivorce\n\nOccurs when members of a socially mated pair of birds become no longer pair-bonded, often to re-pair with different individuals.\n\nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)\n\nThe genetic material of all cellular organisms and some viruses, forming the chromosomes of these organisms. A molecule of DNA consists of two long strands of nucleotides, held together by bonds between nitrogenous bases on the two strands, with the whole structure twisted to form a double helix. The sequence of the nucleotides is the “genetic code,” which contains the instructions for making proteins, which in turn determine the characteristics of an organism.\n\nDNA fingerprinting\n\nA technique by which the nucleotide sequences of selected portions of the DNA of individuals of the same species are analyzed and compared to determine how closely related the individuals are likely to be. Used in criminology to determine if the DNA of clues such as hair or semen match the DNA of a suspected criminal; also used in biological research to determine the relatedness among individuals whose family histories are not known—sometimes to avoid the breeding of closely related individuals of endangered species.\n\nDNA sequence\n\nThe precise order of the nucleotides in a region of the DNA molecule.\n\nDNA-DNA hybridization\n\nAn early technique used to determine the degree of similarity (in nucleotide sequence) between two different samples of DNA. It was used to compare the DNA of two different species, to estimate how closely related they are and to hypothesize their evolutionary relationships. Replaced by genome sequencing.\n\ndomed nest\n\nA cup nest with an overhead dome that helps conceal the eggs and nestlings.\n\ndominance hierarchy\n\nA ranking system of social status among members of a group; often established and maintained through displays and various aggressive-submissive behaviors, including, on occasion, physical combat. Many dominance hierarchies are linear—A dominates B, B dominates C, and C dominates D—but other arrangements exist.\n\ndorsal\n\nToward the back (the vertebral column) of an organism.\n\ndouble-clutching\n\nA technique in which biologists remove one or several eggs from the nests of indeterminate layers and rear those eggs in the lab while the birds lay replacement eggs and rear the resulting young in the wild. Used by conservationists to increase the population size in declining species such as California Condors and Peregrine Falcons.\n\ndown feathers\n\nSoft, fluffy feathers, typically lacking a rachis. Because the barbules lack hooks, the barbs do not cling together, so they trap more air and thus provide extra insulation. Some adult birds have body downs under their contour feathers, and young birds have natal down before molting into their juvenal plumage.\n\ndrafting\n\nDriving closely behind another vehicle and being pulled forward by air currents moving back over the top of the first vehicle and swirling down and forward, as well as by air currents swirling up and forward from below the first vehicle. Used by race car drivers or cars following trucks on a highway; the energetic advantages are similar to those experienced by a bird flying close to and straight behind another bird, as in a straight-line formation.\n\ndrag\n\nA force on a moving object that opposes the direction of travel of the object through a fluid (such as air). Induced drag comes from accelerating air to produce lift; pressure and friction drag are due to air colliding with and moving past the object.\n\ndromornithids\n\nA group of giant, flightless birds that lived in Australia beginning in the Tertiary period, but that became extinct about 10,000 years ago during the Ice Age. They are thought to be neognathous birds most closely related to the Anseriformes (ducks, geese, and swans).\n\ndrumming\n\nNonvocal sounds produced by woodpeckers banging on dead trees or other resonant objects with their beaks; most sound like short, emphatic drum rolls, and are given by both sexes to proclaim territory and attract mates.\n\nduet\n\nSinging performance by two individuals. Avian duets usually are given by a paired male and female who may sing in synchrony, overlap one another, or alternate their songs, depending on the species. Most duetting species are tropical, and include some parrots, woodpeckers, antbirds, flycatchers, shrikes, and wrens.\n\ndump laying\n\nLaying an egg or eggs in the nest of a conspecific (or sometimes, a similar species). Females that dump lay usually also build their own nests and incubate their own eggs. Wood Ducks, Hooded Mergansers, and some other cavity-nesting waterfowl commonly dump lay, sometimes resulting in large numbers of eggs in one nest. Also called dump nesting or egg dumping.\n\nduodenum\n\nThe U-shaped first loop of the small intestine, running from the stomach to the jejunum.\n\ndura\n\nThe outermost, toughest, and most fibrous vascularized membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Along with the other meninges, it provides sustenance and waste removal for the cells of the brain and spinal cord, which are not served by the circulatory system.\n\ndust-bathing\n\nDriving fine particles through the feathers by rolling the body, fluffing the feathers, and wiping the head and bill in a dusty area or by picking up dust and throwing it over the body, after which dust is shaken or preened out; important for feather maintenance and removal of ectoparasites.\n\ndynamic pressure\n\nThe pressure of a flowing fluid, or of movement through a fluid such as air or water. You feel dynamic pressure when wind blows against your face.\n\ndynamic soaring\n\nA type of flight in which birds use the gradient in wind speed that exists over the surface of the ocean to travel for long distances without spending much of their own energy. The bird glides down the gradient at an angle, the turns and rises abruptly into the wind, using its momentum to gain height quickly. It then turns and glides down again, crossing the waves in large zig-zags. Dynamic soaring is used most by albatrosses and other large pelagic birds.\n\nE\n\neardrum\n\nSee tympanic membrane.\n\neastern montane forest\n\nNorth American coniferous forest ecosystem dominated by spruce and fir trees and found below alpine tundra but on the higher summits, ridges, and slopes of the Appalachians from northern New England south through Georgia and Alabama; it hosts relatively few birds.\n\neclipse plumage\n\nThe set of dull-colored feathers worn briefly after the breeding season by some adult birds, such as ducks. In eclipse plumage, male ducks look like females, which do not change much in appearance. Eclipse plumage is acquired by a complete molt after the breeding season, and is soon replaced through a partial molt that produces the brighter colors of the breeding plumage.\n\necological (or environmental) niche modeling\n\nA method for predicting the overall distribution of a species based on the environmental conditions at points where the species is known to occur.\n\necological constraints hypotheses\n\nA set of hypotheses that each give an explanation for why certain individual birds might forego their own breeding in a particular breeding season, instead acting as helpers at the nest of other breeding pairs (usually their parents or other close relatives). The ecological constraints hypotheses focus on the possible costs to young birds of dispersing from their natal territory; examples include (1) few vacant territories of good quality may be available, (2) few suitable breeding partners may be available, and (3) the birds may have little chance of reproducing successfully until they gain “parenting” experience.\n\necological isolating mechanisms\n\nStructural, physiological, or behavioral adaptations that have evolved in species that have very similar niches, and that allow the species to divide up the resources in various ways (such as using slightly different resources or foraging in different parts of the habitat), and thus to coexist. For example, certain wood-warbler species can coexist in spruce forests of northeastern North America even though they all eat similar small insects, because they forage in different parts of trees.\n\necological niche\n\nThe set of biotic and abiotic conditions that allow a species to occur; sometimes also used in the sense of the role of an organism within its ecosystem or environment.\n\necological release\n\nA situation in which the absence of competitors allows a species to occupy an expanded niche compared to locations in which the competitors are present.\n\necological release\n\nAn expansion of the niche of certain populations of a species, such that a greater breadth of resources such as habitat and food are used, in areas where interspecific competition is lower, as on islands. (In these situations, the niche is “released.”)\n\necological speciation\n\nThe evolution of reproductive isolation between populations as a result of divergent natural selection in their different locations or environments.\n\necological succession\n\nThe process by which one association of plants and animals is replaced by another, then that one is replaced by another, and so on until the climax community for that area is reached. The types of communities, and the order in which each succeeds the previous one, is fairly predictable for a given habitat and geographical region. Primary succession begins on a substrate, such as rock, sand, or lava, that has never before supported a community. The process by which a lake gradually fills in to form a bog community is also considered a form of primary succession. Secondary succession begins with bare soil or an existing community.\n\necology\n\nThe study of the relationships between organisms and their environment.\n\necoregional planning\n\nCareful, biologically driven planning at the level of ecoregions, with the ultimate goal of preserving the species and ecosystem processes (for example, fire and pollination) that occur within each ecoregion. Ecoregional planning involves geographically delineating ecoregions; cataloging the ecosystems within each ecoregion; identifying and mapping the most important species, communities, and habitats; determining potential threats to species and sites; and then prioritizing species, communities, and the key habitats as to which require the most urgent conservation action. Ecoregional planners then set conservation goals, outline plans, and monitor the results.\n\necoregions\n\nRegions of the world that are biologically distinct in terms of climate conditions, topography, soil types, and plant communities; also called physiographic regions.\n\necosystem\n\nBoth the living and nonliving components of a particular area (including the physical surroundings), as well as the ecological processes that bind them all together (such as decomposition, soil erosion, and water and nutrient cycling). Ecosystems may be small (for example, the ecosystem of a rotting log) or large (a deciduous forest ecosystem).\n\necosystem management\n\nUnderstanding and maintaining entire ecosystems (see separate entry), instead of focusing on particular species or habitat types. The holistic management of habitats and landscapes for the simultaneous purposes of biodiversity conservation and human use.\n\necosystem services\n\nThe collection of beneficial effects of ecosystems that provide substantial and ongoing economic value to human societies.\n\necotone\n\nA zone of transition between two ecosystems, such as the oak savanna ecotone between the eastern deciduous forests and prairie grasslands of North America. Ecotones host a greater number of species than either adjacent ecosystem, because some species in each of the two adjacent ecosystems frequent the transition zone, and because some species prefer the greater variety of resources found at habitat edges and thus live specifically in those areas.\n\nectoparasites\n\nParasites, such as flies, ticks, fleas, lice, and mites, inhabiting the exterior of a host’s body.\n\nectothermic\n\nDescribes organisms that must rely on sources of heat outside their own bodies to keep warm; also called cold-blooded.\n\nedge effect\n\nThe tendency for areas near the edge of a habitat patch to differ from areas near the center in a number of different ways. For example, areas where two habitats meet fairly abruptly (such as a forest/field boundary) often host a higher number of species than do either of the two adjacent habitats. Other ways in which the edge of a habitat patch may differ from the center include changes in microclimate, such as amount of sunlight or humidity; increased habitat disturbances, such as fire and wind damage; and higher numbers of introduced plants or animals (because these species generally invade from the edge). Forest birds breeding near edges may experience higher rates of predation and/or brood parasitism than birds breeding near the center, because predators such as raccoons, squirrels, and Blue Jays and parasites such as Brown-headed Cowbirds are more common near edges.\n\negg\n\nThe ovum; the female reproductive cell sometimes called the egg cell, both before and just after it is fertilized by a sperm cell.\n\negg tooth\n\nA short, pointed, calcareous structure on the tip of the upper beak (and sometimes the lower beak as well) that develops in bird embryos shortly before hatching; the embryo rubs and pounds the egg tooth against the inner wall of the eggshell to break it open and hatch. The egg tooth sloughs off or is resorbed by the growing chick within a few days after hatching.\n\nelectrolytes\n\nDissolved inorganic salts that carry either positive or negative charges.\n\nelectrophoresis\n\nA method of separating large, charged molecules of different lengths or charges (DNA fragments or proteins treated to carry a charge) by their rate of movement through a thin slab of gel in an electric field.\n\nelephantbirds\n\nA family (Aepyornithidae) of huge, flightless ratites that lived on the island of Madagascar beginning 10 to 20 million years ago, but were exterminated about 2,000 years ago by human activity. The tallest stood about 10 feet (3 m) and weighed about half a ton.\n\nelevational zonation\n\nA pattern in which related bird species replace one other at different bands of elevation along a mountain slope.\n\nelliptical wings\n\nShort, broad wings having a low aspect ratio; they allow great maneuverability, but do not promote efficient or rapid flight. Elliptical wings are common in birds that live in forests, woodlands, or shrubby areas, such as crows, grouse, quail, and most songbirds.\n\nemarginate tail\n\nTail shape in which the rectrices become slightly longer from the inside out. Also called notched.\n\nembryo\n\nA developing young animal that is still inside its egg or mother; in some animals, especially mammals, refers only to the earlier developmental stages.\n\nemigration\n\nThe movement of individuals out of a population.\n\nEmu\n\nA large, flightless ratite of Australia; it is the only member of its family (Dromiceidae) and is the second largest living bird, next to the Ostrich.\n\nenantiornithine birds\n\nSee opposite birds.\n\nEndangered Species Act (ESA)\n\nFederal law passed in the United States in 1973 that commits the government to take action to prevent the extinction of native species and to protect their habitat. It also establishes a procedure to develop a list of threatened and endangered species, identify their critical habitat, and develop and carry out Recovery Plans.\n\nendemic\n\nFound only in a particular region; describes a species or other taxo"
