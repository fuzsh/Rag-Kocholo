        "text": "ROBERT GUÉDIGUIAN'S new film ''The Town Is Quiet'' (''La Ville est Tranquille'') was inspired by a memory of Marseille.\n\n''There is a hill in Marseille with a basilica that overlooks the whole town,'' Mr. Guédiguian said recently, speaking in French at his production office here. ''In the evening, standing there, with the city slowly becoming more quiet, it's easy to imagine that people are peacefully going home. But I've always been haunted by the thought that underneath that apparent tranquillity lurk things that are dangerous and frightening, that could in a moment catch fire. I wanted to talk, in this film, of all the things that make me afraid.''\n\nIn the devastating tapestry that Mr. Guédiguian creates in ''The Town Is Quiet'' -- his 10th film, opening in New York on Friday -- his native Marseille, an unquiet, rough-and-tumble seaport on the French Mediterranean coast, becomes a symbol of a far more universal urban unrest.\n\nMichèle (played by the actress Ariane Ascaride, Mr. Guédiguian's wife) unloads fish on the docks at night so that by day she can take care of her unemployed husband, her drug-addicted daughter and her baby granddaughter. Michèle has two unlikely allies: a sinister bartender (Gérard Meylan) and a taxi driver (Jean-Pierre Darroussin), who is a disillusioned former union man. Meanwhile, in a high-rise building not far from Michèle's, a young, black ex-convict (Alexandre Ogou) preaches peace to his angry friends. But his voice becomes increasingly drowned out by the racist propaganda of the far-right party, the National Front.\n\nFor Mr. Guédiguian (pronounced gay-dee-GYAHN), such social ills stem from a common root. ''Most of these characters, no matter what their milieu, have no real concept of the world,'' he said. ''They go step by step, struggling, without thinking of the big picture. They have lost their sense of direction and their beliefs. But how can one live without some plan, some sort of hope for the future?''\n\nMr. Guédiguian asks these questions but doesn't pretend to have answers. One of the most politically engaged filmmakers working in France today, he is a former Communist who still maintains a strong, if troubled, idealism. Not that his vision is always grim. The film that made his reputation in 1997 was the surprise hit ''Marius and Jeannette,'' a mature love story that is as sunny as ''The Town Is Quiet'' is dark.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
