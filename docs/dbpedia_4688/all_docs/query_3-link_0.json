        "text": "What was the greatest challenge in making Jazz?\n\nJazz is open and free. And yet, jazz itself adheres to some pretty important rules. In some ways, people are playing within that, which is much like democracy. We're given freedom, but we know that freedom has to occur within certain bounds and constraints, not just of the law, but of other people's freedoms, and their desires to express it. So jazz becomes a mirror that way.\n\nFor filmmakers, it's particularly hard, because you never want to say, \"this is jazz, this is not jazz.\" And we struggle to embrace a musical form that is almost unembraceable. At the same time, if you don't stop and say, \"this is our music, this is where it came from, these are the changes it went through,\" we would have shirked our responsibility.\n\nThere was something about jazz that reminded me of something bigger and larger, more than myself, more than who we are. Jazz was the Holy Ghost. You thought you were in the presence of something that could transform, could transcend the mundane and the ordinary of our lives, and really point in the direction of harmony, not just between people and races and sexes, but between just the normal stuff of everyday life.\n\nThomas Jefferson created a fault line when he said, \"All men are created equal,\" yet he owned more than 200 human beings, had set in motion for worse, but also for better, the American experience. Because out of that peculiar experience that African-Americans have had, of being un-free in a free land, has come the possibility to teach the rest of us a true battle cry of freedom. That was the anthem of the Civil War. Jazz is our battle cry of freedom.\n\nWhat makes jazz uniquely American?\n\nAt the beginning of my baseball film, writer Gerald Earley said that when they study our American civilization, 2000 years from now, we'll only be known for three things; the Constitution, baseball and jazz music. I think what he was saying was that the genius of America is improvisation. Just look at the Constitution. It's four pieces of paper, written at the end of the 18th century, that's able to adjudicate the most complicated problems of this our 21st century.\n\nBaseball is a very simple children's stick and ball game, but with infinite chess-like combinations. And jazz is this music, founded by African-Americans, those who have had the experience of being un-free in this supposedly free land, and what did they create? The only art form that Americans have ever invented, and that is this jazz music, out of which, nearly every other form of music that we enjoy today owes itself. Rap, hip hop, R&B, soul, rock all have their ancestry in jazz music.\n\nI can't imagine not being curious about jazz, if you're curious about our country. It's the soundtrack of America.\n\nHow does jazz mirror the African-American experience?\n\nDuke Ellington said that Negro America is creative America, that it was a happy day when the first unhappy slave landed on its shores. We normally put African-American history into the coldest and shortest month, February, as if somehow African-American history is at the fringes of American history, when in fact, it's clear that it's at the center of American history. That's the kind of paradox that we as Americans have to deal with all the time. Our greatness has come from standing in the midst of ambiguity and tolerating it. And there have been no greater teachers of how to do that, we're talking about forbearance, than people like Jackie Robinson, people like Frederick Douglas, people like Duke Ellington.\n\nAnd that forbearance teaches all of us, and we become in the debt of those who are not quick to judge, but look for some mitigating wisdom that can ease the pain of human existence, even in this, the greatest country on earth.\n\nHow does jazz differ from other music?\n\nIf you can think what a revolution jazz was, up until that point, if you looked at the page, and it was John Phillips Sousa, and it went \"dah dah dah, dah dah dah, dah dah dah.\" That's what you played.\n\nBut in jazz you can go \"epp dat at dat at,\" and \"dee dee dee.\" You can make it up the way you want to do it. And it's no less arduous. It's no less rigorous. It's no less demanding of an art form. But what it says is that the genius of America has been to trust the individual. It's just the utter symbol of freedom in it. And this is not freedom without responsibility. This is freedom coordinated with other people.\n\nI just can't play whatever I feel like. I have to listen to what you're saying. I have to listen to what the other person is saying, and work it all together. And that's democracy at its heart.\n\nWhat does jazz mean to you and how does that get translated in the film?\n\nThe first thing we recognized is how controversial it was, how powerful it was emotionally for the people who play it and write about it all the time. We listened to them, and sort of sampled and selected and got a big, rolling machine of a film. It's about two world wars, and a depression, about race, always race, about sex. I mean, this is the music that men and women speak to each other with. It's the mating call, the ritual of courtship.\n\nAnd it's also about drug abuse and its terrible cost, and extraordinary creativity. Naturally, it's going to be filled with lots of controversy. It's going to touch on lots of social issues. And at the heart, it's going to be about joy, about communication, about this language that is so much more precise than my moving my mouth right now.\n\nWe tend to have a hard time talking about music, and somehow we think it's the failing of the music. It's not. It's the failing of the words. Music is itself a much more exquisite, much more precise form of communication. We human beings are just often a little bit too slow to get it completely. But, we made this film for a broad national audience. We didn't make it to please the jazz critics. We made it to please a broad national audience, because this is our birthright. This is who we are. This is the celestial music of America. And I want a little old lady in Dubuque to tap her toes to all of this stuff. And I think we've done it.\n\nHow do you highlight the music itself in your film?\n\nWe have in our ten episodes, nearly 19 hours film, 497 separate pieces of music. We've got 2,000 archival film footage bits and more than that in still pictures, most of it rare and never before seen, 75 interviews. But at the heart of it is this music. From the very beginnings as Ragtime and the other music in New Orleans began to transform into this music we call jazz, through all its changes and all its mutations and permutations, up to the present moment.\n\nOne of the last scenes is visiting a high school, where the kids are playing jazz. And you look into the eyes of these enthusiastic kids and see the future of our music. As a filmmaker, it posed the most difficult challenge, because most of the time, music is background, the amplification of the emotion that's in a scene. Here, we had to move that to the foreground, and it had to work in many different ways.\n\nSometimes we stop and just play a whole tune, by itself. Other times we're talking about a specific tune, but talking in and among it, in the pauses, where we think we can get away with some chatter. Other times, we're speaking about a kind of music, and you're hearing it in the background.\n\nHow did you begin researching this topic?\n\nWe went to lots of jazz clubs on this. You have to, to understand how this music is made. We keep forgetting that jazz has gotten some sort of, I think, completely erroneous reputation as being this difficult music that you can't get into and most people don't listen to it. But if you go around the world, jazz is a symbol of freedom. Jazz is one of the greatest exports we have. Jazz tells the rest of the world not only who we are, but who they might be, if they get hip, if they can swing, if they can really understand what the notion of freedom is.\n\nSo for us, in order to make the film, we had to go to these jazz clubs and stay up 'till 3 AM and see this amazing thing. I mean, we're talking about men and women who can do something that the rest of us can only dream of, which is create art on the spot. It's unbelievable.\n\nHow did you decide on the structure of the film?\n\nA sculptor brings in a huge block of stone to the studio and starts to hammer away. And in the beginning you have an idea of what you want to do. Every chip that you knock off, you have to honor. Because once you get to that final shape, if you're not aware that the negative space, that rubble on the floor, is equally important to what you have there, then you've missed the point.\n\nSo the filmmaker's task, the filmmaker's part, is to try to figure out a structure that is this communicating gift to the audience, and at the same time, honor the terrible triage that takes place from having lost all the other things you can't put in. Where do you begin? How do you stop? These are all the questions, and 10 episodes in 19 hours, people think there hasn't been stopping.\n\nBut each episode is carefully crafted. Within it, each of the 15 or so chapters is carefully crafted. Each scene within that is carefully crafted, so as to keep your attention, and not let your interest move away. So over the 10 episodes, we think we've developed this epic story of America, through the story of jazz. But that involves a great deal of choices, literally millions and millions of choices, that more often that not, leave scenes as good as are in the film, on that cutting room floor, on the rubble in the sculptor's studio. Not because they're not good, but because as the shape emerges, as the shape arises, sacrifices have to be made. It's just like, why do you choose to play that note and not this note?\n\nIt's a mystery. You look back on it, and can finally say, this is just a snapshot of where I was, when I made this, who I was, doing the best I can.\n\nWhat moments stand out in your mind while making this film?\n\nThere's a moment when Wynton [Marsalis] suddenly becomes the entire Count Basie orchestra, patting his foot, scatting the sounds of different instruments, talking about the beats, and you're looking at one man band, literally making this music come alive with his infectious good humor and love of the music.\n\nWhat the biggest surprise you discovered while making Jazz?\n\nI think the surprise that was better than anything else was getting to know Louis Armstrong. At the beginning of the project, I knew him as a man with a big smile, and a handkerchief, a transformer of popular songs like Hello Dolly and What a Wonderful World. But I didn't have any idea coming into this that he's the most important person in music in the 20th century. And that's been the great gift of working on this project, getting to know this extraordinary man. He's the most important person in music in the 20th century, not just jazz. He is to music what Einstein is to physics, and what the Wright Brothers are to travel.\n\nAnd on top of it, he has a heart as big as anyone I've ever met. The film has ten episodes, probably 150 separate chapters, and 15 of them are about Armstrong, the most important person in jazz.\n\nWhat makes him so extraordinary?\n\nHe transformed the way everyone played an instrument. It's hard to imagine now that so much of our music is based on his discoveries. What he did was utterly new, no one had ever played like he did.\n\nHe essentially invented swinging, playing before and behind the note. And completely transformed the way everyone sang. Frank Sinatra, Mildred Bailey, Tony Martin, Billie Holliday, the Pops, all these people would tell you Louis Armstrong is their mentor.\n\nGetting to know Louis Armstrong also has altered my own anxiety about mortality, because I know that if I behave myself and I'm a good person, then I have a chance to hear Louis Armstrong blow Gabriel out of the clouds someday.\n\nIs Jazz your best film?\n\nJazz has been the hardest film I've ever worked on, and therefore in many ways, the most satisfying. I've been asked all through my professional life, \"what's my best film?\" And up until this moment, I've always said that I consider them all the same, and in essence, that's true.\n\nBut there's something very special about how Jazz came together, with the many challenges of trying to make the music the star of our film and to cover such a diverse topic as the 20th century.\n\nDo you consider yourself an optimist?\n\nI think in order to do a film like Jazz, or Civil War or Baseball, you have to be an optimist at heart. You have to stay with it. This is about process. If you had come into the editing room two years ago and looked at it, you would have gone, \"oh my goodness, this is never going to work.\" And we just worked, day by day, and we just sort of put on the layers, and something accrues almost like the layers on a pearl, you can't quite identify, but they're there.\n\nAnd then at the end, you have something that is durable and that you hope will speak to many people. And there's something intensely satisfying as opposed to having a daily deadline where you turn something out quick, you may not get it completely right. Here we have an opportunity to get it completely right, and to work on something with our hands and with our minds, but most importantly, with our hearts, until we get it right.\n\nHow many people does it take to make a film like Jazz?\n\nI've been making films for more than 25 years, and for more than 25 years, we've tried to make this not a careerist activity, but more like a family business. And so, we have worked with the same number of people. Lynn Novick has been a co-producer for many, many years with me, and she and I have actually made a film together as co-creators, Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nWe use the same editors, the same cinematographers. We've got an intern program which has grown up two or three generations of film editors in the course of the last 20 years, people who were unpaid interns from little colleges are now big editors on their own in New York City and Los Angeles.\n\nAnd there's a great sense of satisfaction. We don't do this business without collaboration. I'm in some ways more like the conductor who comes up and has the sort of the easy task, in a way, of orchestrating the extraordinary talents of many people who in their combined efforts, make what we call a film by Ken Burns.\n\nWould you consider yourself an expert on jazz after making this film?\n\nI'm not an expert in anything. I'm certainly not a historian. I'm an amateur historian. What I am is a filmmaker, and I'm curious about the way my country ticks. I'm interested in the mechanics of it, the very simple question, \"who are we?\"\n\nAnd the Civil War can tell you something, as Shelby Foote said in that film. It's the defining moment. Baseball can tell you something. It's a way to understand what we became after that defining moment of the Civil War.\n\nJazz is this wonderful portrait of not only the 20th century, but of our redemptive future possibilities. In Jazz, we see the ultimate of the democratic idea. Different races, different styles, different souls, all negotiating their agendas together. When jazz works, it's a kind of model, if you will, almost in physics, a kind of quantum model, of what democracy is about.\n\nWhy do you think jazz has lasted so long?\n\nJazz suffers from all of the ills that everything else suffers from in our lives, the fads, the low points, the times when music goes off and has other favorite things. But there's something so resilient in jazz. If I had to reduce the theme of the entire 19 hours to one idea, it's affirmation in the face of adversity.\n\nAnd you can take that on any level. You can take on a social and racial political level. But you could also take it on a musical level, that in order to come to myself, who I am in any given moment, requires a huge overcoming of inertia, there's so much friction created. But in making that effort, we have such a possibility to provide something that's transcendent. You can listen to the music of the jazz greats, and it will change your life. It will rearrange your molecules in that moment, just the way all great art can do.\n\nThis is our art, what Americans do the best. \"Art is the transfer of an emotion from one person to another,\" Tolstoy said, I think. But it's also this possibility to remind us of what we might become, and the rearrangement of the found world in front of us, the artist says, it could be like this. And in this new way of looking, we have the possibility to be illuminated.\n\nHow much did you know about jazz before starting this project?\n\nI've learned a lot of surprising things about jazz, because when I began the film, I was not by any means a jazz expert. And for Ken as well, I know we both feel that starting a project without knowing that much about it, most of the fun of the project and the process is just learning about the subject.\n\nSo, virtually everything that came about was new to me. I love the music, and I had a bunch of records, and I had been to hear a lot of music live, but my knowledge of the history of the music really started about 1955 and came forward.\n\nSo I really didn't know much at all about what happened before that. And there have just been so many discoveries in this process. It's hard to pick out one or two, but I suppose the music of Louis Armstrong and the genius of Louis Armstrong was a discovery and a find that I will have for my whole life.\n\nSo that was stunning, truly stunning. I really had no idea. I was just blown away, blown away by his genius and by the emotional power of his music.\n\nWhere did you do most of your research about jazz?\n\nJazz is everywhere. Most of the shooting was not done on location. Most of the shooting was done with old photographs and archival situations. We went to New Orleans, of course, did a lot of research there, and did some filming on location as well. We went to Kansas City, which is a font of jazz, and did some interviews there. We really went to places where there are people who had been involved in the music.\n\nWe spent quite a bit of time in Los Angeles, where we interviewed Artie Shaw and Charlie Haden, Herbie Hancock, drummer Stan Levey, Frances Davis (former wife of Miles Davis) and — there's a bunch of musicians here — Benny Carter. So, we've been a lot of places, but it wasn't really like theCivil War, where you went to a battlefield, because so much of what the history of jazz, it's not in those places as much anymore. The people are there, but there's not locations really to film, in the same kind of way.\n\nSo, but we did get ... we get to meet extraordinary people along the way, people who are willing to open their homes and their lives to us, and share their experiences. Wherever we go, that's been quite a privilege.\n\nWhat was your main role in making this film as compared with Ken Burn's?\n\nOn every project it shifts a bit, depending how big of a staff we have, and actually, in this project, there were many people besides me and Ken who were involved in making the film. There are other producers, associate producers, our writer Geoff Ward, our terrific narrator, Keith David and our great staff of editors. A lot of people have contributed a great deal. Part of what I've done on this film, is from the very beginning, helped to shape the structure of what the film was going to be about, and helped to define the questions that we're going to try to answer. But Ken is the director - and it is his creative vision of what the film will be that drives everything that we all do to help him realize that vision.\n\nI do a lot of the background research at the beginning, and work with Ken as we try to grasp what the important questions are that we want to ask — what is jazz, why is jazz important, what should we be looking for, what stories should we be focusing on. We are trying to make sense out of really an enormously large and diverse collection of material, and deciding how to structure and focus it so it comes out to be a compelling narrative. Together with some of the other producers - paticularly Peter Miller and Davis Lacy, I helped create funding proposals that helped to raise the funds necessary to make the film.\n\nSo I've worked closely with Ken in the editing room. I've done a lot of the research, and done a lot of the interviews as well. And that involves figuring out who to interview, talking to them, deciding what questions to ask, then asking the questions while we are filming the interview, looking at the material and picking out the moments that work, and trying to put them into the film. I've also supervised the post-production, along with Paul Barnes, our supervising film editor.\n\nThis film is so thorough, how did you know what avenues to explore for your background research?\n\nA lot of people always ask us, how did you find Buck O'Neil in Baseball, or how did you find dancer Norma Miller in our Jazz series, and the fact is, these people are actually not that hard to find, I can't really take any great credit. Once you delve into a subject, there are experts in the field that we can draw on. if everybody tells us, you've got to interview Artie Shaw, that's pretty much of a good indication. Word of mouth, books that have been written sometimes are helpful, oral histories, and finding out someone's alive who played with Charlie Parker, say, for example. And maybe he's not a famous musician, but he happened to be with Charlie Parker at a really key period, and he hasn't touched the drums in 30 years, but through word of mouth and through just snooping around, someone mentions him, and we call him up, and he sounds great. We go out there, find him, and Stan Levey turned out to be one of our best interviews. So, it's a little bit of luck, and a little bit of just kind of common sense, actually.\n\nWynton Marsalis helped us an enormous amount, and he's not only a musician and a teacher and a composer, he's also a student of the history of the music. And he has spent the last 20 years of his life learning about it. So, if we said to him, who are the 30 people we should interview, he gave us a list, and we went to many of those people, especially when his suggestions were corroborated by other scholars. We put together a panel of some of the most respected jazz experts around (many of whom do not agree with each other about all kinds of things so we had a great diversity of opinion) - and all of them helped us determine who to interview, which stories to tell, which pieces of music to include, which artists to focus on, and where to find archival material and historical sources.\n\nWhat was the time frame for compiling this depth of information?\n\nWell, that's the thing, we have the luxury of not having to compress all of our interviews into a two week period. So the interviewing process went on over a two year period, or even a three year period.\n\nAnd actually late in the game, we decided we needed to talk to more musicians who had played with Duke Ellington. Because we had interviewed a few, and needed some more. So, I just went down a list of living Ellington alumni and talked to a number of them on the phone, and picked out a few that seemed like they would be able and willing to do it, and two people that we interviewed, Monsignor John Sanders (who played trombone for Ellington) and singer Joya Sherrill, ended up in the film, and are great. They helped us understand who Ellington was, and how he made such extraordinary music, and what it was like to work with him. Their contributions were invaluable and they were added at the very last possible minute. Only six months before the film was done.\n\nBecause of the expansive history of the subject material, did you ever feel that you just couldn't include it all?\n\nYeah, ... someone told me they met someone who knew everybody and had great stories, and I just said, please, don't tell me. I don't want to know. It's too horrible. I could just blow my brains out that we didn't talk to them. And part of the problem is knowing that there's really an infinite number of choices that you have to make. And you have to eventually say, we can keep on interviewing for the next five years, and there will still be people that we won't have talked to, that we should have.\n\nSo, at a certain point we just say look, we have enough material to make a good film. And even though there are other people out there who have great stories to tell, we simply have to say, that we have a limited budget and time, and we have to take what we've got, and make that work. And that's actually a good discipline to have. Because otherwise, you could just go on forever without having the gun to your head that says, now it's time to finish this movie.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge in making this film?\n\nYou know, every project has its challenges. This was the hardest thing I've worked on, I would say, because I felt enormous responsibility to get it right. Not that we don't always feel that, but in a biography of a single person, it's pretty straightforward. They're born, they live, they do this, this, this, they die. So you kind of have a structure pretty much built in. You might do some flashbacks, or whatever, start at the end, and go back to the beginning. But the structure is pretty much built in, in a biography.\n\nAnd in this case, there really ... we knew we were going to do a chronological story, but other than that, it was open season. And there are 50 intersecting parallel stories that you can be touching on at any given time. It is an incredibly, overwhelmingly complex and sophisticated story and we had an infinite number of choices to make, decisions to face.\n\nSo, for example, let's say you are covering 1928, what are you going to tell about what happened in 1928? There's five really interesting stories that you could tell about that time. Having to make those choices, and wanting to feel that in the end, in the aggregate of all those choices you would make throughout the whole process, you would be telling the stories that should be told, and telling them coherently, and well...\n\nIt was an awesome responsibility, and pretty terrifying, I have to say, because I felt that it was such an important subject, and so little understood, that we really had an obligation to get it right. And there wasn't ... no one else was going to get the chance to do it again for a long time. And so, it was a little intimidating, I have to say. The saving grace was that the music was there. And whenever we didn't know what to do, we just worked with what the music was telling us. And it seemed to sort of pull us through.\n\nHow important was keeping a neutral point of view in relating jazz's history?\n\nWe knew going in that the world of jazz is a very factionalized and sort of riven with conflict, with many different groups of people who disagree violently and are fighting over a very small pie. And it's gotten very bitter and unpleasant over the last 15, 20 years.\n\nAnd we knew that we were just jumping into the middle of that. And we just decided to forge ahead with the knowledge that we don't have an agenda. We don't have a preconceived notion of what the film should be. We let the story speak to us because in the larger sense, we're trying to reach the general audience, people who don't already know anything about jazz. The general audience is not interested in these internecine battles among jazz critics about who is legitimate, who is overrated and stuff like that.\n\nAnd I think we have made a film that is exciting, compelling, hugely entertaining and fun to watch, and a great introduction to the music.\n\nWe also were always aware of the fact that we don't expect our audience to have musical training so we wanted to make sure that we instructed people about the music, and taught them how to listen, but never got too technical so that someone who wasn't musically trained wouldn't be able to follow what we were saying. And that was actually relatively easy, because I'm not musically trained. So I found myself as a pretty good litmus test as far as how musically technical we could be. When we were able to explain something that even I could understand, I figured that we would reach people.\n\nHowever, we didn't want to shortchange the depth, sophistication and complexity of the music. And to appreciate it, you kind of have to understand some of the complexity, so we wanted to incorporate that, but not go so deep into it, that we would lose our general audience.\n\nHow did you decide what pieces of music were going to be included?\n\nWe have 497 different pieces of music in the film, different compositions, different recordings. So, that's a lot of music. And we had to make a lot of choices. If we're doing a Count Basie section, what are going to be the quintessential songs that you have to hear? Which tunes will illustrate the musical points we are making?\n\nKen might say he likes Tickle Toe. I like One O'Clock Jump. The editor of the scene might really think it has to be Jumpin' at the Woodside. In general, we would give our editors a range of choices, and let them play with the music and see what worked with the pictures, and the mood they were trying to set, which soloists we were going to be talking about, what innovations the piece would have to showcase. So a lot of choices got made in the editing room. But in a lot of cases we made selections based on information in the film itself. In an interview, the critic Margo Jefferson talked about talking about Billie Holliday, and that when she hears Billie Holliday sing A Fine Romance, she can hear in the sound of her voice that she was so ebullient and carefree in that period of here life. So of course, we had to play A Fine Romance.\n\nBut that's probably only about 10% of the music in the film. And the rest were choices that we had to make. In addition, we had a new process for us, which was dealing with the fact that the music is not merely a background element in the film. This is the story that we're telling. So in this case, the music had to be front and center, some of the time.\n\nIn fact, when we first put the film together in the roughest stage, and were watching it, we had cut it as we always do, with pictures and the narration or the voice-over or the first person voice and the music in the background. And when an interviewee talked about what it was like to hear Louis Armstrong play Stardust, but we had not left any time for the music to be heard without someone talking. So in the edit room, we began to insist that the film \"stop talking,\" whenever it needed to. So we could hear the solo that we're talking about. And so, we learned through the process when to, as we say, open up, just have no one talk, and let the music play. And not always for an extended period, but maybe just enough to get the feeling of what we're saying, and also to have a give and take, you know, trading between the talking and the music.\n\nDid you encounter gaps in the history of jazz due to lost recordings?\n\nThere are no lost recordings that I know of that we couldn't find. But there were rare recordings that were hard to track down, air checks from bands that haven't been put on records, or an out of print record that some guy had in a collection, you know. There definitely are obscure pieces of music that we had to track down. We were able to get a lot of material from the Institute for Jazz Studies at Rutgers University, which is a wonderful jazz resource. Dan Morgenstern, the Director of the Institute, was an enormous help to us.\n\nAnd they have a collection of 78s, and material on tape. And we just said, you know, we need to find an example of early blues. What have you got? And they would give us 10 choices. The first jazz record was made in 1917. Our first episode begins in 1830. And we have music throughout, and it ends with the first jazz record. But you're hearing music throughout that episode.\n\nSo, from the very first day of editing we knew, well, what are we going to be listening to? Obviously there's no records from that period, but we can't not hear anything, because we're talking about music. So we used a combination of recordings that were done a bit later than 1917, but still sound pretty early —early delta blues, work songs, spirituals, ragtime, marching bands, opera, and all the other kinds of music that contributed to the development of jazz. We also felt we had to try to give the audience some idea of what it might have sounded like to hear Buddy Bolden, who was probably the first jazz musician and who never made any records.\n\nSo we had Wynton Marsalis and his band — many of whom are from New Orleans — do some interpretations or recreations of early jazz for us. And we're not saying that's exactly what Buddy Bolden sounded like, but we know these are the songs he played, this is the kind of instrumentation that he had. And we'll just, you know, at least give a feeling for what it might have been.\n\nAlso, if we were talking about a particular artist's biography, let's say for example, Louis Armstrong. He's born in New Orleans, we talk about his childhood, growing up, you know, playing, first learning how to play, getting jobs, liking jazz. What are we going to listen to? He hadn't made any records at that point in his life. But we felt that we had to hear Louis Armstrong play. So we took records from later in his life, to hear while we learn about him as a child, and growing up. Because the spirit that's in the music, we felt was more important than being chronologically literally accurate to that moment. And for most of our artists that we do extensive biographies of, we're taking later recordings, and using them in their early childhood.\n\nThey say that jazz has to be heard live. How much of current jazz performances influenced your research?\n\nLuckily for me, I get paid to go out to jazz clubs and listen to music for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes we were scouting locations, and of course, we had to go and check them out. Sometimes we were scouting for young artists that we were going to focus on, so I've heard most of the current crop of up-and-coming, and established younger musicians play, which has been a wonderful privilege.\n\nIt's true, jazz has to be heard live. Records are great. I love records. And if you're in your car, if you're at home and can't be out, it's a wonderful second best. But there is nothing like hearing a live performance. There is absolutely nothing like the excitement of seeing someone play, and knowing and hearing the melody, and then they go off and do something else, playing something that has never been played before, creating art on the spot.\n\nI'm not a musician, but I can tell that they're creating something right there, for me. And watching them interact with the other musicians, and the dynamism on bandstand and the audience reaction, that's been one of the joys of the project, to have carte blanche. I wish I had more free time, didn't have young children, I could go out every night. But I did get to go out quite a lot.\n\nSo, honestly, have you had enough of jazz at this point?\n\nEveryone always asks didn't you get sick of the subject? Gee, six years, that was so long, you know, aren't you sick of jazz? Do you ever want to hear another jazz record? And I suppose for some subjects, it's possible that you might feel bored or frustrated after that much time spent. But jazz is really endlessly rewarding, and the more that you hear, and the more that you understand of it, the more rewarding it is, and the more satisfying it is.\n\nSo, I actually wish I had more time to spend on the project, and to learn more, frankly. Because learning what I have learned so far, has also made me aware of all the things I still don't know. It's a very deep subject that will really never grow old for me, and I think it's also, more than anything, it's an adult music. It's really not a music ... I mean, teenagers have loved it in the past, and young kids still love it today, but it's an adult sensibility.\n\nIt's something that, as you get older, I think can be even more satisfying, because of the emotional depth of the music. So, as you go through life experiences, and you live through things, you can appreciate what the musicians are saying, in a different kind of way than you can a Rolling Stones song or a Talking Heads song. I don't really play many of my rock and roll albums any more — I listen almost exclusively to jazz. I guess I'd just say I look forward to growing old with the music.\n\nWhat was it like working with Ken Burns on this extended project?\n\nI love working with Ken — he is so smart, so focused, so intense, and so dedicated that he sets the bar pretty high for the rest of us and it is always a challenge to try to keep up. We do have a lot of pressure even though the projects last many years, because there's always the next deadline that you have to get to. But there's also this sense that I've learned in working with Ken, which is very inspiring, which is, he understands this very unique process. He knows that if you just put one foot in front of the other, and make decisions and move forward, you will finish the film.\n\nAnd that may sound silly, but with something this vast, even just to begin is terrifying. Where do you start? And, you know, it's sort of like writing the first word of that term paper. How do you begin? And if you just say, we have to start at the beginning, and work our way through to the end, and then go back and look it over and make it better and keep on going that way, and if you just keep working at it and don't get discouraged, it seems to work out in the end.\n\nEventually, you will get the point where the film is truly done, and you know it's done — there is nothing you want to change or add or subtract. I always look forward to the end of the project, because it has been so long, and I feel the responsibility and the pressure, and you know, I'm looking forward to knowing that it's done. And then the day it's done, I always feel like I just want to cry. I just can't bear the idea that it's over, because it's been this focus of your life for so long, that the fact that it's over is heartbreaking.\n\nI have two children who are five and eight. And I have watched them grow up and appreciate jazz, because it's around our life all the time. They know who Louis Armstrong is. They know who Duke Ellington is. And Charlie Parker, and Miles Davis, and Billie Holiday. They hear this music in our house. They've been to concerts. They've heard music played live. And I can look forward to them growing into it as well, and seeing what it can mean to them. They'll still like pop music, and hip hop and everything else, I'm sure.\n\nBut I know that it will be something that they will carry through, for their lives too, which is, it's a great thing to see. And I'm thankful for the project having made that happen for them too, because a lot of kids their age, really have no idea, unfortunately, what this music is all about. And it's kind of a gift that the project has given to me, that I am passing onto them."
