        "text": "RIN TIN TIN (1918-1932) – Here at Balladeer’s Blog, I’m even fonder of dogs than I am of silent movies, so this post will combine the two topics. Sadly, most silent films have become so little remembered that few people even realize that there actually WAS a real Rin Tin Tin, adopted by American soldiers during World War One.\n\nAmid battles in September of 1918, Corporal Lee Duncan of the 135th Aero Squadron was doing recon work on a bombed-out area near Flirey, France. One of the buildings had been a breeding kennel for German Shepherds trained for Kaiser Wilhelm’s troops. The only animals still alive were a starving mother with five nursing puppies who were so young their eyes had not even opened yet.\n\nDuncan adopted the six German Shepherds and took them back to his unit. His superiors permitted the mother to be given to an officer, one each of the puppies to three enlisted men and the final two – a boy and a girl – were adopted by Lee Duncan himself and named Rin Tin Tin and Nanette.

Balladeer’s Blog is squeezing in another seasonal post before then.\n\nTHE SPY (1914) – This four-reel movie was based on the 1821 novel of the same name by THE James Fenimore Cooper. The story is set largely at a home in Scarsdale, New York as American Rebel families share feuds, intrigues and romances with British Loyalists.\n\nEverybody is keeping a secret or two and which characters are spies and which are really what they say they are remains uncertain until the very end. Cooper based the man who emerges as the central American spy on the real-life Enoch Crosby, a friend of John Jay.\n\nEven in this June of 1914 release, George Washington’s reputation for running his own spy networks was well and truly in force in popular culture and the wily general even shows up in disguise a few times. Things work out well for the Americans, but the deep-cover double agent hero doesn’t get credit until after his tragic death.\n\nA large battle set-piece at a bridge was impressive for 1914 and was praised by Moving Picture World and Variety that year. Herbert Rawlinson and Edna Maison starred. Continue reading →\n\nL’INFERNO (1911) – This 71-minute movie was an adaptation of Dante’s epic poem Inferno, one-third of his Divine Comedy along with Purgatorio and Paradiso. It was also Italy’s first feature-length film, beating Cabiria to theaters by three years.\n\nThree directors collaborated on this production – Francesco Bertolini, Giuseppe de Liguoro and Adolfo Padovan. Obviously, L’Inferno is a very condensed version of Dante’s work but the special effects are impressive for the time period.\n\nEven if I wasn’t a silent film geek aspects of this movie would have stood out to me. First, it was made in Italy toward the end of the Belle Epoch, lending it a certain poignance as the global conflict was approaching an oblivious world.\n\nSecond, L’Inferno has a certain grandeur from being filmed in Italy itself, the home of Dante Alighieri and his guide through Hell, Virgil. And third, nearly all of the footage set in the realm of the damned was filmed amid extinct and semi-extinct volcanoes in Italy, adding immeasurably to the infernal atmosphere. Continue reading →\n\nHere are the silent films of the iconic and world-famous actress Sarah Bernhardt. This revered stage thespian was born in 1844 and died in 1923. She was practically royalty when she deigned to appear in a few silent films.\n\nLE DUEL D’HAMLET (1900) – In this roughly 2-minute short, the 56-year-old Bernhardt gave cinema a gender-flipped Hamlet as she fenced with Pierre Magnier as Laertes in the climactic duel.\n\n“The Divine Sarah” as she came to be called, was spryer and more athletic than women half her age. This brief moment of history was the first time ANY scene from Hamlet had been presented on film.\n\nTOSCA (1908, 1912) – Bernhardt portrayed Floria Tosca in this adaptation of the Puccini opera. (Yes, it’s a silent movie version of an opera.) The entire story was condensed into just 40 minutes and Sarah was so appalled with the production that she insisted that it not be released and, in fact, wanted it destroyed!\n\nLuckily for cinema history, it was merely shelved for 4 years and wound up getting released to cash in on the success that Sarah’s silent movie about Queen Elizabeth the First was enjoying in 1912. Continue reading →\n\nHAPPY EASTER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! The good response to my blog post about one of the silent films depicting Jesus Christ and the Crucifixion has prompted me to provide the following list of more such silent movies – both shorts and feature films.\n\nHere they are in no particular order:\n\nCHRISTUS (1916) – Directed by Giulio Cesare Antamoro, this is a fascinating look at Jesus, from the Angel visiting Mary through his Resurrection and subsequent visit with his Apostles. Christus runs 88 minutes and features some inventive variations on Biblical tableaux. The Star of Bethlehem is depicted as a comet; when Mary finds young Jesus preaching to his teachers His shadow appears as a cross; and Judas gets three visions of the Devil – first urging him on to betray Jesus, then taunting him when he regrets that betrayal, and finally welcoming him into Hell, which opens up under Judas’ swinging corpse. Continue reading →\n\nDICK TURPIN (1925) – Western star Tom Mix took a break from his Wild West movies by starring in this highly romanticized film about the real-life English thief and highway robber Dick Turpin. John G. Blystone directed the movie for Fox Film Corporation. Tom swapped his six-guns and rifles for a sword and pistols in this flick.\n\nThe story in this 70-minute movie starts out in the mid-1730s. In this version of events Dick Turpin is already well-known for committing masked highway robbery against the carriage trade of well-to-do passengers. Among his men is burly Tom King, played by Alan Hale after his 1922 turn as Little John to Douglas Fairbanks’ Robin Hood.\n\nThe main villain of the film is Lord Churlton (Philo McCullough), who not only resents having been robbed by Turpin, but abuses his power and influence by menacingly trying to force Lady Alice Brookfield (Kathleen Myers) to marry him.\n\nOut and about without his mask on one day, Dick spots a rival gang of highway robbers attacking the carriage of said Alice. Smitten with our heroine’s beauty, Turpin comes to the rescue, single-handedly driving off the bandits and flirting with the young lady. Continue reading →\n\nReactions to Balladeer’s Blog’s reviews of silent movies have been positive enough that I’d like to offer a quick take on a few multi-part documentary series on the subject. Both were from British Film Historian Kevin Brownlow, who did a better job of depicting the Age of Silent Movies than any Americans ever did.\n\nBrownlow secured interviews with as many survivors of the era as possible, given their VERY advanced age. These are only a few of Brownlow’s documentaries, he also did a series on European Silent Films as well, plus several restored versions of silent classics. I plan to cover more of those in the future.\n\nBUSTER KEATON: A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW (1987)\n\nPART ONE – From Vaudeville to Movies: Brownlow and his colleagues scoured the best available footage remaining from Buster Keaton’s silent comedies. (For newbies to silent film history I’ll mention that countless movies from that period are lost forever due to decomposition prior to efforts to preserve them.)\n\nExcellent selections of still photos are also featured, along with brief excerpts of interviews with stars, directors and others who worked with Keaton decades earlier.\n\nThis opening installment sets the pattern – the emphasis is on footage of Buster’s silent comedy classics accompanying the narration. Keaton’s career as a child performer in vaudeville is covered, followed by his drift into silent comedy shorts, at first backing up his mentor and longtime friend Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle.\n\nBuster’s genius shone through and he was soon heading up his own unit writing and directing his comedy shorts and later features. In addition, the Great Stone Face did his own stunts, thus suffering many injuries over the years.

I love the film myself but rather than write the 9,899,974th glowing review of the 1927 original I will instead take a look at the 1984 re-issue, produced by Giorgio Moroder, who also did soundtracks for movies like Scarface, Midnight Express, and later Top Gun.\n\nThat reissue of Metropolis edited the film down to its essential story elements, giving it an 83 minute run time, compared to the 2-and 1/2-hour length of the original movie. Many critics were disgruntled about this, because let’s face it – film critics are almost never “gruntled.”\n\nRather than have the usual classical or similar music play as accompaniment to a silent movie, composer Giorgio Moroder wrote a rock and pop music score to attract a generation of filmgoers who might otherwise have never sat through a silent movie in their lives. Freddie Mercury, Pat Benatar, Adam Ant and Billy Squier were among those performing Moroder’s score.\n\nPompous film critics, as short-sighted as ever, blasted the entire venture as an affront to Fritz Lang’s original production and otherwise lost their minds over it. In my view, Moroder should be praised for his efforts.\n\nNot only 1984 audiences but all subsequent generations of viewers which were drawn to silent movies in general thanks to airings of Metropolis (1984) may never have brought the new blood and passion to the early cinematic artform if not for Moroder.\n\nThis 1984 project led to neophytes sampling other silent masterpieces like The Phantom of the Opera, Orphans of the Storm, The Mark of Zorro and many others. Continue reading →\n\nTHE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1925) – Lon Chaney Senior’s makeup and performance as the title character were envelope-pushing for 1925 audiences. To me this is the ULTIMATE silent horror film. It may sound odd, but in my opinion this movie is the very best cinematic adaptation of the Gaston Leroux novel.\n\nNearly every frame of this masterpiece is like a painting and it’s a rare viewer who can take their eyes off the screen at all as the movie plays. Lon Chaney’s iconic portrayal of Erik, the hideously deformed Phantom of the Paris Opera House, is magnificent in every way. Continue reading →"
