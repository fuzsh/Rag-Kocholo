        "text": "It’s spring, and love is in the air, or at least the desire to reproduce for the survival of the species. Squirrels are among the many species that seek out mates in the spring months. As the weather warms up, they become much more active. You may begin to see more of them digging in the dirt and scampering around the trees than you did all winter.\n\nYou also may hear them more, but this isn’t just because they’re happy for the warmer temperatures! If you hear them in your attic, it’s time to contact the experts in humane wildlife prevention Kitchener. When squirrels chatter, they are communicating. Sending out a mating call is just one of the reasons they may be making so much noise.\n\nSquirrels Chatter a Warning\n\nHave you ever walked under a tree in your front yard and heard a frantic and insistent chattering from up above, only to look up and discover a squirrel is staring down at you, making an awful lot of noise? One of the most prominent reasons you’ll hear squirrels making noise is to sound an alarm. When a squirrel senses danger, it uses its voice to let other squirrels know that there is a threat in the area. The chattering also tells the predator that it’s been detected. Sometimes, you are the one who is the threat!\n\nSome Squirrels Trill in Defense\n\nThere are some species of squirrels, such as grey squirrels, who have no trouble living communally. Their territories overlap and they often feed together. Other species are very territorial. Territorial species, such as the red squirrel, use their voices to defend their turf. When another individual gets too close, these squirrels make a sound that may be mistaken for a rattlesnake. If you hear this trill from a squirrel, it usually means that there are other squirrels nearby that are competing for the same territory.\n\nFeuding Squirrels Trill and Chatter\n\nOn occasion, you may hear a combination of sounds coming from the trees above. When territorial squirrels simply trill, they are establishing their dominance in their territory and sending out a warning to others to stay away. If a competitor dares to cross the line, then the two individuals start feuding, and you’ll hear a combination of alarm chattering and trilling. The chattering here serves less as an alarm and more as a form of dispute.\n\nMale Squirrels Chatter in Courtship\n\nIn the spring, male squirrels are especially noisy as they seek out mates. Male sense when a female is ready to mate. He will flick his tail to try to get her to notice him. If she comes close enough, the male then chases the female. While the male is chasing the female, he makes a lot of noise, and it sounds a lot like the chattering of an alarm call. The way to tell the difference is that you’ll also see one squirrel chasing another during this time, a behaviour they don’t engage in when a predator is present!\n\nDuring mating season, even normally communal squirrels become territorial when a female is around. Once a male has a potential partner in his sights, he defends her and his territory against other males. If another male comes around and attempts to move in on his prospects, he will use his voice to threaten the competition, but he may also attempt to chase the other off. Between the courting and the feuding, spring can be a noisy time of year for squirrels.\n\nHumane Squirrel Removal"
