        "text": "“Call to locate your mate and your nest but beware of alerting nearby predators.”\n\nMating Call is an ability present in Spore. The ability is exclusively granted by mouth parts. Mating Call allows the user to perform their species' mating call that results in a response, the player can then follow that response to mate and enter either the Cell Creator or Creature Creator (depending on stage).\n\nAppearances[]\n\nCell Stage[]\n\nThe Mating Call becomes available in Cell Stage after obtaining 14 or more DNA points. When the player's cell performs a mating call, their cell must follow the \"response\", which appears randomly by sides. When the player's cell swims over the targeted cell (who appears with floating hearts around them), the player will enter the Cell Creator.\n\nCreature Stage[]\n\nThe Mating Call can be used to locate the player's nest and to attract a mating partner to mate with. Potential partners will respond to your call by making the same mating call, and their disposition icon will change to a pink \"swooning\" emoticon, indicating that the player can mate with them by clicking on them. After the animation of laying an egg, the player will enter the Creature Creator. Using the Mating Call near the nest of a hostile species will attract their attention.\n\nGalactic Adventures[]\n\nIn adventures, Mating Call has no purpose but can be used anyway.\n\nNotes[]\n\nThe Mating Call can be used to escape certain death, as interacting with the mate and entering the cutscene will make the player immune to damage and end any combat.\n\nIn the Creature Stage, using the Mating Call at your nest when there are no nestmates around will spawn a mating partner.\n\nMuch like with singing and talking, a creature's mating call will vary depending on the mouth(s) they have."
