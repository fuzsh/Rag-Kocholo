        "meta_description": "Criterion Collection Edition #468\n\nThe mesmerizing, utterly unclassifiable science films of Jean Painlevé (1902–89) have to be seen to be believed: delightful, surrealist-influenced dream works that are also serious science. The French filmmaker-scientist-inventor had a decades-spanning career in which he created hundreds of short films on subjects ranging from astronomy to pigeons to, most famously, such marine-life marvels as the sea horse and the sea urchin. This definitive collection brings together the best of these, and also includes the French television series “Jean Painlevé Through His Films.”",
