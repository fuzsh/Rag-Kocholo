        "text": "LOS ANGELES — A new Library of Congress study, released yesterday, reveals disquieting facts about the nation’s early film heritage.\n\nOf the almost 11,000 silent features produced and distributed in the United States from 1912 to 1929, the report says, only 3,311 are known to exist — and fewer than half, or 1,575, in their original 35 mm format.\n\nThe others are partly lost, or they survive only in foreign versions or lower-quality formats such as 28 mm or 16 mm.\n\nPrevious studies have documented how many silent features were produced in the United States during the period.\n\nYet the new Library of Congress report — “The Survival of American Silent Feature Films: 1912-1929,” commissioned by the National Film Preservation Board — is said to offer the first definitive study pinpointing the number of surviving films and their location in archives worldwide or private collections.\n\nSilent films have been lost for many reasons: the deterioration of highly volatile nitrate stock, fire, negligence, the destruction of prints and negatives.\n\nAmong the films gone are London After Midnight (1927), directed by Tod Browning; the 1926 version of The Great Gatsby, starring Warner Baxter; and all four Clara Bow features produced in 1928.\n\nLost silent films, though, are still being discovered.\n\nTheir First Misunderstanding (1911), a Mary Pickford short, was recently found in an old barn and preserved by the Library of Congress.\n\nAnd, as announced in 2010, 75 American silent films, including the lost John Ford work Upstream (1927), were discovered at the New Zealand Film Archive and repatriated to the major archives — the Library of Congress, the Academy Film Archive, the UCLA Film & Television Archive, the George Eastman House and the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nOf the 3,311 movies that have survived in any form, the study notes, 886 were found in other countries — 24 percent of which have been repatriated.\n\nThe Czech Republic has the largest collection of silent American films outside the United States.\n\nThe study was written by archivist and historian David Pierce, who has created a database of information on archival, commercial and private holdings that, according to the study, will support the repatriation of lost American films.\n\nThe survey is one of several congressionally mandated studies of the heritage of films and recorded sound.\n\n“Unfortunately, there is so much that’s already been lost,” said Steve Leggett, program coordinator for the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress.\n\n“But this study identifies some that are around. You really just don’t know sometimes until you get over to these (international) archives. There may be other stuff unidentified because it’s in a different language, or they put American films aside because they focus on their own countries’ output. So, hopefully, there are some more gems.”\n\nThe study, he said, gives a “snapshot of what the current situation is — just to get a list of what titles we think survive and where they are. We are not going to be able to afford to get all of them but to prioritize some of the titles you might want to get.”\n\nOscar-winning director Martin Scorsese, who has helped preserve countless movies through the Film Foundation, described the report as invaluable “because the artistry of the silent film is essential to our culture.”\n\n“The research presented in this report,” he said in a statement, “serves as a road map to finding silent films we once thought were gone forever and encourages creative partnerships between archives and the film industry to save silent cinema.”"
