        "text": "While some wild creatures, such as swans, mate for life, there is no monogamy or vow of fidelity among whitetail deer. Deer don’t have families in the traditional sense, and they are not raised by their fathers, as depicted in the Disney movie, Bambi. An episode of Maury Povich would be more like it. Whitetail deer are not faithful, they don’t mate for life or even go steady (date exclusively) and bucks do not tend to their young.\n\nWhen the main rut kicks in, bucks have two things on their mind — “sexy time” and staying alive. Eating isn't a priority, neither is sleeping. A buck may grab an acorn or two while courting a doe and waiting for her to come into heat, put her tail to one side and stand for him, but the focus is on procreation. The rut is only in the fall, so they get as much “sugar” as they can because they’ll be shut-off for another year.\n\nThe way it works is that most does come into their estrous cycle around the middle of November, which is the rut, or mating, season. This is the time when bucks are out trolling for — and meeting — receptive does. They usually won't be feeding and bedding in the core of their home ranges, as they do most of the year, since the lure of hot does can take bucks miles from their usual lairs. Research, using collared deer and telemetry, has shown that many bucks go on “excursions” during the rut, traveling far and wide to find does needing to be bred. As my grandmother would’ve put it, “they’re off on a toot.”\n\nWhen a buck finds a receptive doe, he'll stay with her and breed her several times during the 24-36 hours that she’s in estrous. The rut can be an exciting time to hunt because big bucks, which are largely nocturnal, can be on the move during daylight hours in search of does, thereby increasing opportunities to see them. However, it also can be frustrating because bucks will simply disappear into thick cover when they’re with a doe. Also, if you located a nice buck prior to the season, he’s probably not anywhere near where you’re used to seeing him.\n\nAfter a buck is done breeding a doe, he'll be on the move again, seeking another one, giving hunters an additional opportunity to see him during daylight hours. In mid- December, the does that didn't get bred during the main rut come into heat again and bucks will be looking to breed them. The rut takes its toll on bucks because eating and sleeping comes second to breeding, and they can lose about 25 percent of their body weight by the end of mating season. Some old bucks are so run down after the rut that they may not recover and will die, or they can be too weak to outrun a pack of hungry coyotes, especially if there’s early deep snow. Outside of the rut, bucks are mostly secretive, solitary animals or they hang out in bachelor groups with other bucks.\n\nWhitetail bucks don't form harems of breeding does and protect them the way a dominant bull elk does. With elk, only the strongest, most dominant bulls have the esteemed privilege of a harem with breeding rights to all the cows. With whitetails, a buck finds a hot doe, loves her and leaves her, then looks for another. While a buck is tending a doe, there are other bucks breeding the other receptive does in the area. Two bucks that find a receptive doe at the same time may fight over her, but one male doesn’t dominate a harem of females. If all the mature bucks in an area are tending does, and a doe is in heat with no suitor, a lesser buck, or even a young, year-and-a half old buck may get to breed with her. Inbreeding also occurs among whitetail deer, where bucks sometimes mate with their mother, sister or daughters.\n\nWhile bucks are unfaithful, sometimes incestuous lotharios, research has shown that some does also don't honor their vow of fidelity and can bed down with more than one buck that comes down her trail. Does, on average, give birth to a set of twins each year and according to a report by the Quality Deer Management Association (QDMA), DNA tests (on captive deer) have shown that one in four sets of twins has two fathers.\n\nThe QDMA offers several explanations for cases of multiple paternity, the most plausible being that a buck breeding a receptive doe (repeatedly) gets displaced or run off by a larger, older or more aggressive buck while the doe is still receptive. The larger, older and more aggressive buck then breeds the doe and she can have fawns sired by each of the bucks.\n\nSo, fawns are always born out of wedlock, making them “bastards” in the literal, but archaic sense of the word, or as I like to call them, “love fawns.” These love fawns know who their mothers are but never know who their fathers are. The does know who their kids are but some of the shameless jezebels that had multiple sexual partners in the same day don’t always know who the father — or fathers — are, at least not without a DNA test. The fathers are deadbeat sperm-donor dads who never know who their kids are, they don’t help raise them, nor do they bring food to the does or pay child support, so don’t believe the Bambi movie. Who’s your daddy? Maury, the envelope please?\n\nAs an aside, it's been said that love-sick bucks throw all caution to the wind during the rut and that hunting them is like shooting fish in a barrel, but just because you may catch one crossing an open field in broad daylight while he's sniffing around for another sexual conquest, doesn't mean he's stupid. Their survival instincts are still razor sharp and they'll notice every twitch you make, hear you sniffle and smell your coffee breath — from 100 yards away.\n\nHunters use all kinds of masking scents to try and get rid of their human scent, so the deer can't smell them, but I don’t think they work. Skunk pee is an old remedy used to help mask human scent but research has shown that deer's olfactory glands are so advanced that they can detect our human scent through the strong odors, like skunk stink. In other words, you may think you smell like a skunk to a deer, but you really smell like a hunter who drank coffee that got sprayed by a skunk.\n\nDoe pee is the most popular buck attractor scent, and it’s very strong smelling, but again, based on research, you should be doing everything possible to be free of human or foreign scents that could alert deer to your presence. They’ll be able to smell you through the strongest Eau de Doe. Think of it this way — bathroom air freshener. Does it really eliminate odors? No. Our olfactory glands are crude compared to a deer’s, but when we walk into a bathroom that’s just been used and sprayed with Glade, our noses tell us it smells like somebody crapped under a pine tree. True? True.\n\nMarc Folco is the outdoor writer for The Standard-Times. Contact him at openseason1988@aol.com or through OpenSeasonSpecialties.com"
