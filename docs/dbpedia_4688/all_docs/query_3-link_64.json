        "text": "Do the challenges and pleasures of reading appeal to you? Do you want to master the craft of interpreting and analyzing texts? The English major prepares students for any field that values critical thinking, clear and effective writing, research skills, and the ability to interpret and analyze textual data. From medieval epics to twenty-first-century films, graphic novels, and sound poetry, our courses cast a wide net in order to expand and deepen our understanding of what counts as “English literature.”\n\nMajor Requirements\n\nAs an English major, you will spend time learning about different forms of literature before shifting to a focus on historical periods and contexts. The flexibility of the major accommodates individual interests, and you may focus on critical histories and methods, major authors, ethnic and multicultural literatures or the relation of literature to complementary disciplines such as environmental studies or film criticism. You may also choose a course of study emphasizing teaching, creative writing or general literature."
