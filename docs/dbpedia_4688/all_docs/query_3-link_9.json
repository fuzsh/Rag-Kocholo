        "text": "Jim Belushi is set to co-star opposite Taran Killam in Showtime’s half-hour comedy pilot Mating (working title), from Jason Katims and Stu Zicherman.\n\nWritten and executive produced by Zicherman, Mating centers on Jay, a recently divorced guy (Killam) who married young and now finds himself completely unprepared for the brave new, frank and fluid world of dating and hooking up. Belushi will play Paul, Jay’s (Killam) father and business partner.\n\nThe project is an “annual anthology” as each season will focus on a different protagonist’s journey through modern dating and relationships. True Jack Prods.’ Katims and Michelle Lee executive produce with Zicherman for Showtime and Universal TV. Craig Johnson (The Skeleton Twins) executive produces and will direct the pilot.\n\nBelushi’s recent TV credits include HBO’s Show Me a Hero and roles on the upcoming Good Girls Revolt on Amazon, and David Lynch’s Twin Peaks sequel on Showtime. Belushi also is starting production on the new Woody Allen movie along with Kate Winslet and will film that simultaneously with Mating. He’s repped by ICM Partners and Brillstein."
