        "text": "Los Angeles, CA — IMDbPro and ReFrame, an initiative of Sundance Institute and WIF (formerly known as Women In Film, Los Angeles), announced that 77 of the 200 most popular scripted series of the 2023-24 season have been awarded the ReFrame Stamp for gender-balanced hiring (full list below). The 77 awardees represent 38.5% of the 200 most popular scripted series, which is a decrease of 8.5% from last year and 20% from the peak in 2020-21. The Stamp acknowledges gender-balanced hiring and demonstrates the potential for every production—regardless of subject matter or the gender of its creator or lead talent—to achieve gender equity.\n\nThe ReFrame TV Stamp, launched in 2018, is awarded to scripted series that hire women or people of other underrepresented genders (including those who are trans, nonbinary or gender nonconforming) in at least 50% of key roles including: showrunner, writers, directors, executive and line producers, leads, co-leads, and department heads. Additional points are awarded to productions that hire women of color in these positions, and to those with overall gender parity in their crews. View full criteria here.\n\nReFrame founders, Keri Putnam and Cathy Schulman, responded to this year’s data, “ReFrame is thrilled to congratulate the 77 series that achieved equity in their hiring this year. However, 38.5% of series reaching this benchmark falls far short of the 100% fair hiring standard we should all aspire to. The ReFrame Stamp’s criteria of gender balanced hiring should be the goal of all productions.” They continued, “Positive trends in mitigating bias often flatline or roll-back after a period of progress. It’s a testament to the efforts of many across the field that there are nearly twice as many Stamped series this year as when we began in 2018, but the drop of 20% over the last four years indicates a troubling trend. If this pace of reduction continues, all the progress made in diversifying the talent shaping media in the U.S. will be erased in two years.”\n\nCEO of WIF and ReFrame Council Member Kirsten Schaffer added, “The contraction in the business resulted in 204 fewer episodes across the Top 200 series than in prior years analyzed. This should impact writers and directors equally, with lost jobs split evenly between men and women but this year’s findings suggest that women are disproportionately impacted and demands further study.” ReFrame Council Member and Founding Senior Director of Artist Programs at Sundance Institute Michelle Satter concluded, “The value of a pipeline of support for underrepresented storytellers on both sides of the camera cannot be understated. Renewed attention to inclusion, collaboration and transparency are needed for our field to be equitable.”\n\nKey findings of the full ReFrame Report on Gender and Hiring in TV, released today and determined by ReFrame’s extensive analysis of IMDbPro data, include:\n\nLead cast surpassed the 50% mark last year with 54% of lead roles being portrayed by women or gender diverse performers; this year representation dropped to 41% (13% decrease).\n\nPilot writing and directing jobs and their many financial benefits remain primarily in men’s hands and pockets. There is a consistent average gap of nearly 12% for directors and 14% for writers year-over-year in hiring for pilot episodes versus episodes overall. Of the 102 pilot episodes in this year’s list, 26 (25.5%) were directed by women, including one trans woman, and 33 (32.4%) were written by women.\n\nAll 13 series in the top 200 that are showrun by women of color obtained the ReFrame Stamp. Though any project can achieve the Stamp through gender-balanced hiring in key positions, there is still an overwhelming correlation between showrunner identity and overall equity. Nearly 60% of Stamped series are showrun by women, compared to 32.5% of series overall.\n\nThis year’s gains were for line producers, directors of photography, composers and intimacy coordinators. With the exception of intimacy coordinators (where qualifying candidates hold 49% of positions), even with this year’s increases, women and gender-diverse people hold fewer than 20% of positions in these other important roles.\n\nOf the 77 series receiving the Stamp, 59 (76.6%) were released on streaming services, 9 (11.7%) on cable and 9 (11.7%) on networks.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the majority of Emmy Nominees for Outstanding Comedy Series received the Stamp. Five of the eight (Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks, Reservation Dogs and What We Do in the Shadows) met the gender-balanced production criteria as well as three of the eight nominated series in the Outstanding Drama category (Fallout, The Morning Show and Mr. and Mrs. Smith) and three of the five Limited or Anthology Series (Baby Reindeer, Lessons in Chemistry, True Detective: Night Country).\n\nThe ReFrame Report includes a company report card which further breaks out the streaming, network and cable shows captured in the Top 200 to determine the percentage of series from each distributor that met ReFrame Stamp criteria. With the exception of Amazon MGM Studios (which had 60.9% of their series this year meet ReFrame Stamp criteria), every distributor reflects a lower percentage of gender-balanced series than in 2020-21 (the first year this data was collected).\n\nThe ReFrame Report also highlights actionable resources that empower studios and distributors to find historically excluded cast and crew to hire and collaborate with. The ReFrame ReSource includes more than 100 tools, best practices and insights highlighting the work of countless advocacy experts and organizations. Decision-makers can discover and hire inclusively with IMDbPro and its advanced search feature, which is available to all IMDbPro Premium members. Professionals can find cast and crew based on self-identified demographic information, including gender/gender identity and race/ethnicity. IMDbPro members with a claimed name page can self-identify this information, which is intended to support talent, particularly from under-represented communities, looking to be discovered and advance their careers.\n\nTo determine the 2023-24 Stamp recipients, ReFrame examined IMDbPro data on the 200 most popular narrative television and streaming shows with a full season of episodes released during the Emmys eligibility period of June 1, 2023 – May 31, 2024. See the full list here. Each show was considered for the list based on its top-performing four weeks during the eligibility period on the IMDbPro proprietary ranking of titles, factoring in the removal of sports, news, non-fiction and reality programs. IMDbPro rankings are based on the actual page views of the more than 250 million monthly visitors to IMDb worldwide. IMDb is the world’s most popular and authoritative source for information on movies, TV shows and celebrities, and its vast and authoritative database features more than 500 hundred million searchable data items.\n\nReFrame encourages all productions to implement equitable hiring practices and apply to earn the ReFrame Stamp year-round. Through an open application process, numerous television and streaming productions outside of the Top 200 earned the Stamp in 2023-24, including The Ms. Pat Show: Season 3 (BET+), SKYMED: Season 2 (CBS), The Other Black Girl: Season 1 (Hulu) and Station 19: Season 7 (ABC). The list of all 2023-24 Stamped shows is available below, on ReFrame’s website and at IMDb.com/ReFrame.\n\nAbout ReFrame\n\nFounded and led by Sundance Institute and WIF (formerly known as Women In Film, Los Angeles), ReFrame is an initiative that employs a unique strategy: a peer-to-peer approach, in which ReFrame Ambassadors engage with senior industry decision-makers at over 50 Partner Companies to implement ReFrame systemic change programs. The initiative’s goals are to provide research, support, and a practical framework that can be used by Partner companies to mitigate bias during the creative decision-making and hiring process, celebrate successes, and measure progress toward a more gender-representative industry on all levels.\n\nThe ReFrame Council, which leads the strategic direction of the organization with ReFrame Program Director Erica Fishman, includes the initiative’s founding members: WIF CEO Kirsten Schaffer, Producer and Former Sundance Institute CEO Keri Putnam, and Oscar-winning producer, WIF President Emerita and founder of Welle Entertainment Cathy Schulman, alongside Channing Dungey (Chairman, Warner Bros. Television Group), Franklin Leonard (Founder, The Black List), Rena Ronson (Head of UTA Independent Film Group), and Michelle Satter (Founding Senior Director, Artist Programs, Sundance Institute).\n\nReFrame is made possible by support from Netflix’s Creative Equity Fund, IMDbPro, The David and Lura Lovell Foundation, WME, Adobe and the Women at Sundance Leadership Council.\n\nAbout IMDb\n\nIMDb is the world’s most popular and authoritative source for information on movies, TV shows and celebrities.
