The film also stars Harvey Keitel and features Mira Sorvino. Lulu on the Bridge is the story of a jazz saxophonist (Keitel) whose life is forever changed when he is hit by a stray bullet.\n\nDafoe will be returning to the stage once shooting is completed in The Wooster Group's House/Lights (based on Gertrude Stein's Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights), going to NY in late January. Dafoe is a founding member of the experimental theatre company and recently starred in their version of O'Neill's The Hairy Ape."
