        "text": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge (born July 14, 1985, London, England) is an English writer, producer, and actress whose work in television and film—including Fleabag (2016−19), Killing Eve (2018−22), Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), and No Time to Die (2021)—has established her as a comedic and dramatic powerhouse, both behind the scenes and starring in featured roles.\n\nWaller-Bridge’s parents, Teresa and Michael Waller-Bridge, raised her and her two siblings (a younger brother and an elder sister) in the Ealing area of London. They divorced when she was a teenager. She attended boarding school for a year at age 11, but she did not enjoy her experience there. She then enrolled at St. Augustine’s Priory, an independent Roman Catholic school for girls in Ealing. In secondary school, she found that she enjoyed the social aspects of school more than she did academics. She starred in plays and frequently made her classmates laugh.\n\nAt age 17 Waller-Bridge began studying drama at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). She spent several years waiting for opportunities onstage, and when she finally received them, she grew frustrated with the insignificant character roles assigned to her. She longed to portray characters with a greater sense of agency. One influential director at RADA, Ché Walker, encouraged her to channel her anger into her acting career: “Ché told me, ‘You’ve got rage. Don’t shy away from rage; rage is a gift,’ ” she recalled in a 2017 interview. In 2006 she graduated from RADA, but finding work as an actress proved difficult, which was one reason why she turned to writing.\n\nA pivotal moment in Waller-Bridge’s career came in 2007 when she met Vicky Jones, the director of a play starring Phoebe’s then-boyfriend. The two became friends and launched DryWrite, a theatre company that recruited playwrights to provoke audiences with short experimental productions to be performed in a small pub room. Some of the works commissioned by Waller-Bridge and Jones were later performed in theatres around London. Waller-Bridge wrote plays of her own, and some of the characters that she created for them later appeared in her television series. In the meantime, she landed roles for several movies and television series, including The Café (2011−13), Albert Knobbs (2011), and The Iron Lady (2011).\n\nIn 2012 a friend dared Waller-Bridge to write and perform a 10-minute comedy piece, which prompted her to create and perform as a new character: a sardonic grief-stricken woman. She adapted the piece into a one-woman show, which she performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2013. There, a BBC comedy editor watched her show, which won the festival’s Fringe First Award. BBC and Amazon eventually agreed to produce the one-woman show as a television series, which became Fleabag (2016−19).\n\nIn 2016 Waller-Bridge’s first television series aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom: Crashing. In the show, which she created and wrote, Waller-Bridge played Lulu, a ukulele-playing woman who comically disrupts a small community of adults living in an abandoned hospital. That same year Fleabag debuted on BBC Three. She wrote the script and starred in the show, whose name was derived from one of her childhood nicknames. It features the titular 20-something woman navigating grief, sexual adventures, and family tension in London. Fleabag’s sly sense of humour juxtaposes with the show’s melancholy themes. The success of the first season led to the creation of another season, which aired on BBC One in 2019, once again written by and starring Waller-Bridge. The second season, which tells the story of Fleabag falling in love with a Catholic priest, was critically acclaimed and won Waller-Bridge three Emmy Awards. In 2019 Waller-Bridge wrote and performed in a new solo show, also called Fleabag, that had runs in New York City and London’s West End.\n\nWaller-Bridge created and helped write the BBC America series Killing Eve (2018−22), which she adapted from Codename Villanelle, a collection of novellas by British author Luke Jennings. Starring Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh, Killing Eve follows an assassin and a security operative who become obsessed with each other in a cat-and-mouse chase around the world. Waller-Bridge also played Laurel in Run (2020), a romantic comedy and thriller television series created for HBO by Jones. Waller-Bridge was also reportedly chosen in 2023 to adapt the Tomb Raider video game franchise into a television series for Amazon."
