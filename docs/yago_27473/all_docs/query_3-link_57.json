        "text": "BRADEN AFTERGOOD, producer (“Samaritan”)\n\n“The Rock” — Michael Bay at the height of his powers. The perfect chemistry between Cage and Connery. Hans Zimmer’s propulsive score. Michael Biehn taking things REALLY seriously. This feels like the moment where the dam broke — where every shot suddenly became active and epic and it didn’t matter if it was a missile firing at San Francisco or two guys having a conversation. “The Rock” is a ride, perfectly executed and incredibly satisfying. Action cinema at its best.\n\n“L.A. Story” — Chuck Klosterman writes about the ’90s actually starting in 1991, and “L.A.” Story is a movie that perfectly encapsulates the weird and whimsical period of transition before grunge took hold. From a decade of excess into a decade of ripped jeans and nihilism, this film is in the middle of a pop-culture fade-in. It’s beautiful and magical and it celebrates life, love and Los Angeles with the perfect amount of gloss; Every viewing makes me want to sit outside and have brunch in the middle of an Earthquake with a twist of lemon.\n\n“Being John Malkovich” — There’s one scene in particular that sums up why I love this movie. Craig gets on the elevator for the first time and the woman next to him says “7 and a half, right? I’ll take ya through it.” And then we see the crowbar lying by the door, and the door has a million dents as though jamming a crowbar into it is the most natural thing in the world. The filmmakers have gone out of their way to take this exceedingly absurd idea and make it feel mundane; we shouldn’t even question it. In this way, the high concept never feels like it’s getting in the way of the fundamentally human story — the movie is ‘Malkovich Malkovich’ but it’s also about being satisfied with what you have and who you are.\n\n“Dead Man” — “Dead Man” is quintessentially ’90s cool — Vaguely nostalgic for the 1970’s but still steeped in that grungy post-cold war ambivalence. This movie is beautiful and haunting and irreverent and somehow still shrugs its shoulders and says “whatever….who cares?” If you haven’t watched the behind-the-scenes footage of Neil Young’s scoring session, do yourself a favor.\n\n“True Romance” — “Fanboy as hero” would grow to become a ubiquitous offering throughout the 90’s, and it could be argued that this movie kicked off the trend. This is the perfect marriage of the Tarantino homage-to-the-classics pastiche with the uber-commercial vision of Tony Scott. The result is arthouse film masquerading as popcorn, without a single ounce of fat. When’s a guy supposed to get up and use the restroom if every scene is more magnetic than the last? I like you, Clarence; always have, always will.\n\n“Fargo” — I’m not going to say anything about “Fargo” that hasn’t already been said, but I will flag what I think is most significant: I have no idea what genre it is. A comedy? A drama? A thriller? It somehow executes all of those tones and each one is pitch-perfect.\n\n“Pulp Fiction” — Filmmakers find inspiration everywhere they look, but this was the first film where inspiration felt like it was coming squarely from within the aisles of the video store. Suddenly a movie geek was taking all his geeky favorites and packaging them into something that felt mainstream and commercial. I downloaded the script off a janky BBS when I was in middle school and promptly memorized the whole thing. Yes, I had lots of free time on my hands.\n\n“Dazed and Confused” — Are you in high school? Are you bored? Do you just want to drive around and find a good time and maybe there’s a tiny bit of existential dread as you contemplate the future? Well guess what….you are not alone. At their best, films make you feel like you’re a part of something larger; they make you realize that your experiences are shared. For me, Dazed and Confused defines this power — nostalgia for another time while also acknowledging that those people weren’t any different than you.\n\n“Point Break” — “Point Break” is what happens when you take your movie seriously, no matter how ridiculous the story. Surfing bank robbers? Sure, sounds like a cheesy gimmick-movie trying to cash in on the Lollapalooza crowd. But instead, Kathryn Bigelow somehow does the impossible – present a world, ridicule it, then make you want to be a part of it. The result is seductive; epic and beautiful and perfectly celebrating its time and place. Mark Isham’s score and Donald Peterman’s cinematography further elevate this into a full-blown masterpiece. Even the final needle drop — Ratt’s “Nobody Rides for Free”…somehow feels awesome and contemporary and right at home in a post-Nevermind world.\n\n“Jurassic Park” — This must have been what it felt like to watch Oz go from black-and-white to color. A masterclass in technique – every frame of this movie somehow feels more real than anything put out in the 20 years since its release. A seamless combination of real places, practical effects and judicious vfx enhancement; the peak of the mountain before we plunged into CGI plasticity.\n\nANNIE HAMILTON, writer-performer (“Mack & Rita”)\n\n1. “Stepmom”\n\nI watch this movie — three, four times a year? — I don’t know. It’s deservedly numero uno. It makes me cackle and it makes me weep. I used to watch the scene where Jena Malone asks her mom, Susan Sarandon, if she’s dying (while they’re QUILTING cus it’s the NINETIES) in audition waiting rooms back in Los Angeles, so I’d be able to feel something, anything. It didn’t matter if I was going out for a sitcom or for General Hospital, Stepmom is the perfect way to be reminded of the glory and pain of having a family and of being alive.\n\n2. “Monster in a Box”\n\nFor an hour-and-a-half Spalding Gray is mostly seated, but he’s basically dancing. It’s so well written that it comes off like free association. His performance is so desperate and so easy at the same time. I watched this a lot while I was writing my last show for Cherry Lane and it really inspired me.\n\n3. “My Sex Life…Or How I Got Into an Argument”\n\nAn ex-boyfriend showed me this movie and it made me fall in love with him. Desplechin is one of my favorite directors — “My Golden Days” and “A Christmas Tale” are big for me — and “My Sex Life” was my introduction to his work. Probably the best movie title I know of, too. Also Marion Cotillard makes a cameo and it rocks.\n\n4. “Postcards from the Edge”\n\nI’m tied here between “Postcards” and “The Birdcage.” Mike Nichols!!!!!! Mike Nichols! I watched “Postcards,” “Birdcage,” and “Working Girl” (not the 90s sorry) on repeat the first 3 months of quarantine. That’s all I could stomach. Everything else made me jealous or bored. These movies are instant cures for purposelessness. They repair your self-esteem.\n\n5.) “Private Parts”\n\nHoward Stern is just the best and Private Parts is HOWARDS STORY! The musty offices, the greasy hair and crumpled outfits – the aesthetic is startlingly visceral. I can smell everything. I like watching it on dates, too. It’s a good date movie.\n\n6. “Husbands and Wives”\n\nI debated putting this on here cus I didn’t want to upset anyone, and I don’t think you should give Woody Allen your money, but this is my favorite of his movies by far. It’s the first movie that made me think about how a movie is filmed. The way the camera literally corners the characters in the way they’re being cornered emotionally. Watch it when you have a therapy session coming up, not immediately after therapy.\n\n7. “The Talented Mr. Ripley”\n\nMy socialite freshman roommate who I tried desperately to fit in with came home one night and told me I reminded her of Matt Damon in Mr. Ripley. I hadn’t seen the movie so I lied, just like she wanted me to, and thanked her for her compliment. Years later I saw it. She wasn’t wrong. I think I’ve changed since then cus I can actually watch it now without closing one eye.\n\n8. “The Basketball Diaries”\n\nI really, really wanted to leave this out of my list. I really, really wanted to. But I watched this every. single. night. from 14-17 years old?! I had a poster of it that I kept UNDERNEATH my bed because I didn’t want my mom to get the wrong idea about me. Lorraine Bracco gives an amazing performance. Obviously Leo knocks it out of the park. The male camaraderie! The utter anguish! The city living! Jim Carroll! I love it.\n\n9. “The Age of Innocence”\n\nSince no one ever asks me about my favorite movies, I just have to say that Raging Bull is my fave Scorsese. Okay. We watched The Age of Innocence in our History of NY class in High School, and it is one of the only things I remember learning about in school. I walked outta class that day and bought fake fur earmuffs on 42nd Street and then booked it to Fifth Avenue. Every NYC high school should play this for the kids.\n\n10. “Before Sunrise”\n\nGreat flick but “Before Sunset” is the best one. I’m sorta cheating, sorry. “Before Sunset” is the ONLY movie where I actually needed to see the characters kiss. I was tweaking out, man. Tweaking for the kiss to come! But you have to see “Before Sunrise” first in order to really tweak out like that. If you’re American you also just have to see these movies before you travel. Going up to strangers on the Eurostar is one of the most exciting things a person can do. Or the Metro North. It’s not the same, but it works.\n\nDAVID LOWERY, writer-director (“The Green Knight”)\n\nThis is an impossible list: The ’90s carried me from the ages of nine to 19 and are therefore rife with not only truly great movies but landmarks in my own development as a cinephile and person. No decade feels longer and more all-encompassing to me and trying to pare it down to ten films is nonsense. So here I go. I am on principle excluding movies from 1999, which was basically a decade unto itself, and for the remaining nine years trying to find a balance between cultural value and nostalgia. I have already failed.\n\nIn alphabetical order:\n\n“Bram Stoker’s Dracula”\n\nI kept flip-flopping this title with Disney’s “Beauty & The Beast.” Both are masterpieces of craft, both involve gothic castles and wilting flowers, and in 1992, I was definitely listening exclusively to the soundtracks to both of these films on cassette tape. “Beauty & The Beast” is revolutionary and looks to the future, Coppola reaches into the past, both are incredible, but there’s only one I still watch almost every year.\n\n“Boogie Nights”\n\nThis could just have easily been “Magnolia,” were it not for my 1999 rule, but “Boogie Nights” is the cinematic equivalent of rose-colored star-shaped glasses. It is full of terrible things we remember warmly and can’t wait to revisit. The declarative nature of its filmmaking just gets better and better with age. A perfect movie.\n\n“Buffalo ’66”\n\nLet this title represent your own does-it-still-hold-up ’90s Sundance title of choice! This one is mine.\n\n“Crash”\n\nI think this was my first NC-17 movie? I was not old enough to see it when it opened, and also not mature enough to appreciate it when I rented it on VHS. I just revisited it for the first time since the ’90s and was surprised to discover that it is not only one of the very best films of the ’90s, but it might be one of the best movies ever made. I think I might write a book about it.\n\n“Fargo”\n\nI think about the Mike Yanagita scene at least once a week, and the last scene with the Gundersons in bed even more often than that. Another perfect movie!\n\n“He Got Game”\n\nThis was a movie I watched repeatedly during my early tenure as a projectionist and then lost track of. Revisiting it during the lockdown, I wondered how it could be so forgotten: I think this might be Spike Lee’s best movie of the ’90s, second best movie overall, and probably the most aggressively poetic he’s ever been. The final moments of outright magical realism had an unexpectedly outsize influence on this Peter Pan movie I’m making.\n\n“Mars Attacks!”\n\nI needed to put a ’90s blockbuster on this list, and weighed all the best of them, from Speed to “The Fugitive” (the first movie I ever bought on VHS!) to “The Rock” to “Face/Off” to “Starship Troopers” — but ultimately, this spot had to go to Tim Burton’s unloved but brilliant masterpiece of misanthropy that, from its concept to its cast to its budget, could only have been made in the late ’90s. No one in any decade will ever make another movie like this one.\n\n“Naked”\n\n“Secrets & Lies: and “Naked” demarcate 90s Mike Leigh’s for me. I remember being very intrigued by the newsprint ads for “Naked” in the Sunday paper, tiny and grimy and tucked away beneath “Schindler’s List” (which should also be on this list!). A few years later, my mom and I went to see “Secrets & Lies: in the theater but we got lost en route to the mall (because back then Mike Leigh movies played at the mall). I finally saw both films on DVD in 2007. One is full of warmth and empathy, the other spit and poison. Having just rewatched both of them, I’m going with the latter.\n\n“The Piano”\n\nThis movie’s release coincided with my brief obsession with the Oscars, so by the time I finally saw it, I knew it was a big deal, knew the music, knew that Anna Pacquin did cartwheels on the beach. Eventually my local library got a copy of it and I checked it out and swooned. I was just starting to get into goth culture; this movie expanded my concept of what Gothic could be. A lot of my taste in storytelling can be traced to that final shot.\n\n“Pulp Fiction”\n\nI debated whether or not it was rote to put “Pulp Fiction” on this list instead of, say, an Almodovar or Kieslowski or Heat (another perfect movie) my beloved “Meet Joe Black,” but then remembered that this list isn’t fair in the first place, and “Pulp Fiction” is the definitive ’90s movie, so here it is, encompassing all that Tarantino brought to the decade, including “True Romance,” “Natural Born Killers” and that classic Siskel & Ebert episode. A classmate and I performed the climactic diner scene in our 9th grade theater class and the script is so undeniable that our drama teacher let us keep the swear words in. I already regret giving this movie a spot.\n\n“Romeo + Juliet”\n\nI saw this movie six times in the cinema in the span of about a month. Four Baz Lurman epics later and it is still ahead of its time. On a cultural level, maybe this spot should go to “Titanic,” which packaged a similar sentiment in a more streamlined package (and is also a masterpiece that is one of the best movies of the ’90s and should definitely be on this list). On a personal level, it could have gone to “Edward Scissorhands,” which made baby me feel seen in the same way this movie did. But that movie is timeless and this list is all about a moment in time, and I can’t think about 1996 without hearing “Number One Crush” in my head.\n\n“Satantango”\n\nThe most momentous black-and-white art film that I actually saw in the 90s proper was Jim Jarmusch’s “Dead Man,” which I watched on VHS with my dad, and has since become one of my favorite movies of all time. But so has “Satantango,” which I saw a decade later and which deserves a spot on this list on account of the sheer weight of its 35mm print alone. That said print is now not the only way in which to endure this epic is conservationally comforting but also a little bit sad. I only ever want to see this movie in the theater, once every ten years or so, with intermissions imposed by the sheer amount of celluloid running through the projector.\n\nELI ROTH, actor, writer-director (“Borderlands”)\n\nThe 90s\n\nby Eli Roth\n\nIn the fall of 1990, I was a freshman at NYU film school, living more an Andrew Bergman film than Ingmar, and I was hungry for anything weird. And suddenly, the ’90s happened. The Coen Brothers. Tarantino. Jeunet and Caro. P.T.A. It felt like what was happening in the ’70s, with the rise of the Miramax and the rebirth of New Line Cinema and I was watching it unfold in real time with all the other aspiring filmmakers in my class.\n\nSo here are the films that blew my mind and showed me new possibilities of what you can do as a filmmaker. I’m gonna leave out a lot of film I love (“Goodfellas,” “Terminator 2,” “Boyz N The Hood,” “The Crying Game,” “Jurassic Park,” “Forrest Gump,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Scream,” “Sling Blade,” “Starship Troopers,” “The Sixth Sense”) because they’ve been written about a lot, and I want this to be under 10,000 words, as well as throw in a few films people might have overlooked.\n\nIn chronological order.\n\n1. “Cinema Paradiso”\n\nOkay, I’m already cheating because this film played European film festivals in 1989, but it wasn’t released in the U.S. until February 1990, and in a time when streamers didn’t exist, as far as I’m concerned, for me that makes it a ’90s movie. This was the last film I saw before leaving for N.Y.U. film school. I remember “The Freshman” also came out that summer, a comedy about Matthew Broderick starting as a freshman at N.Y.U. film school, and although I enjoyed it, that film didn’t resonate with me the way “Cinema Paradiso” did. Tornatore’s masterpiece encapsulated everything I loved not just about movies, but about loving movies. I watched the scene of the director screening all the censored kisses and broke down in tears. The heartbreak of devoting yourself to cinema at the cost of the love of your life — it was too much for me at 18. Was that going to be me? (I secretly hoped so.) I listened to the soundtrack so much I wore out the cassette tape. I noticed that the film bore the logo of a new distribution company — Miramax. Their only other movie I could recall was “The Outside Chance of Maximilian Glick” which looked a little schmaltzy to me, even as a Jewish kid. Who knew, maybe this company was going to be something…\n\n2. “Barton Fink”\n\n“Devil on the Canvas, take Charlie!” “I will destroy you!” Not since “Eraserhead” have hotel room radiators been so absorbing and hypnotic. I really liked “Miller’s Crossing,” but this movie changed what I thought movies were supposed to be and I still quote it to this day.\n\n3. “Delicatessen”\n\nI remember going to see this because it said “Terry Gilliam Presents.” I had never seen anything like it. Perfect in every way, especially the casting. Something just felt different in how movies were being made.\n\n4. “Ruben and Ed”\n\nCrispin Glover screaming “I’m the King of the Echo People!” Crispin Glover proudly bragging “My cat can eat a whole watermelon!” Howard Hessman as a pyramid scheme salesman trying to help Crispin Glover find the perfect spot to bury his frozen dead cat. Need I say more? Just… trust. Just watch it.\n\n5. “Man Bites Dog”\n\nWhat a tragic loss that Rémy Belvaux died age 39. I was lucky enough to see this on an invite to the New York Film Festival, and hung out with the filmmakers after. I was twenty years old, I thought they were the coolest. A brilliant, brutal, hilarious film that was so sick and so funny at the same time it really made an indelible impression on me.\n\n6. “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me”\n\nI remember this film being reviled at the time it was released, and now it’s regarded as one of the greatest films of the decade and of Lynch’s incredible career. Wildly creative, beautifully rendered, it moves at its own pace in its own world and doesn’t try to please anyone. I love it. I helped dig up the original elements to transfer it on DVD and found a lot of the lost scenes. I still write to Badalamenti’s hypnotic score.\n\n7. “Reservoir Dogs”\n\nI was lucky enough to see this in the theater without knowing anything about it. It absolutely blew my mind: violence was back. I was a Resident Assistant in my dorm at NYU and was in charge of decorating the floor. I decorated the entire floor as an homage to Tarantino, and Lawrence Bender’s sister Karen was a friend and lived on my floor. Lawrence happened to be in town shooting “Fresh” across the street and came by and saw it and was completely amazed there was already a Tarantino Superfan. My student film was called “Restaurant Dogs.” I told Quentin I was the original Tarantino ripoff. By “Pulp Fiction” everyone was copying him. I was the first! Years later I got to run my 16mm print of “Restaurant Dogs” at Quentin’s cinema The New Beverly. Life is pretty cool sometimes.\n\n7A. “Bad Lieutenant”\n\nI mean… what a year for movies 1992 was. I love Abel Ferrara, I could list so many of his films as my favorites of the 90s but this one just blew me away. Keitel is absolutely unhinged, written by “Ms. 45” herself Zoe Lund. “Bad Lieutenant” and “Reservoir Dogs” in the same year? And the baseball subplot on the radio — it was genius. I can’t leave it off the list it’s too good.\n\n8. “Menace II Society”\n\nI remember this film being billed as a reaction to “Boyz N the Hood.” There was a real danger to this movie — stories of people were being shot in the cinemas. It blew me away.\n\n8. “Mute Witness”\n\nI saw in the theaters, and for the first 45 minutes I was completely exhilarated. Here was an original, no holds barred cat-and-mouse slasher film with a fantastic premise of the mute make up artist who accidentally walks in on a snuff film after hours and can’t call for help. As brilliant as the first 45 minutes were is as messy as the second half is where the film can’t sustain its premise and falls apart. But I still watch that first half as a masterclass in horror film tension and suspense.\n\n9. “Kids”\n\nThis was the new cinema. I lived right there in Washington Square Park where they filmed so much of it, it felt so real. A terrifying wake up call for people, to me something changed in terms of who was now allowed to make movies. You could write a film at 19 years old? What?\n\n10. I can’t believe I’m at 10 already! Okay I’m going to cheat more.\n\n“Friday”\n\nStill holds up as one of the funniest movies ever made. Masterpiece. People say “Bye Felicia” not even knowing it’s from this film.\n\n10A. “Trainspotting”\n\nWhen was the last time you left the theater and people were bouncing around the streets singing the music for the film? For me that was “Trainspotting.” Felt like something changed after that movies, this was the new cool.\n\n10B. “Scream”\n\nI lied. I want to write about “Scream.” I remember July 4th, 1995, age 22, giving my agent the first draft of “Cabin Fever” and he handed me back a script called “Scary Movie” written by Kevin Williamson and said “This script just sold to Miramax for $500,000.” I read it on the bus ride home from NYC to Newton, Mass, thinking “Oh…this is what a real script reads like….” At the end of the ride I was too depressed to get off. I just thought man, I’ll never write anything this good. Great writers can either inspire you or be so great they make you feel like quitting.\n\n11. “Boogie Nights”\n\nThis film subverted my expectations on every level. I thought it would be a fun throwback film about 70s porn, not one of the greatest dramas I had ever seen. It’s one of those movies that now feels too short when I watch it. I wish it went on forever so I could just live with those characters in that world.\n\n12. “The Big Lebowski”\n\nOkay I’m breaking my rule about movies that were discussed to death, but man, this movie… it just ties the article together. And at the time it wasn’t a hit – people were talking about how the movie didn’t make any money and wasn’t as good as the other Coen brothers other films. And then there were those of us who saw it and went and bought bowling balls and had the name WALTER engraved on them and bowled at the same bowling alley (now closed) on Hollywood boulevard where they filmed — recreating the Lebowski scenes week after week after week. Guess which group I was in.\n\n13. The Blair Witch Project”\n\nI got a VHS tape from my friend Kevin Foxe who told me “This movie I’m a producer on just got into Sundance. I know you’re into horror, check it out.” I watched it in my apartment alone, then slept with the lights on. That hadn’t happened since I was a kid.\n\n14. “American Movie”\n\nI still quote it to this day. All-time favorite. I related to this movie so much. Borchardt is a poet and Mike Shank is his muse.\n\nWILEY WIGGINS, actor (“Dazed and Confused”)\n\nI have a terrible time with lists. I hate quantifying art. When I think about movies especially, I think about what was going on when I saw them, who I was with, how they related to what was happening at the time, not ranking them against one another. Picking 10 movies from a decade where I was watching a lot of movies was hard, especially since I didn’t give myself a very clear criteria — movies that I saw multiple times when they played, movies that stayed with me, movies that have held up over time.\n\nThere are a lot of big, great omissions here that were maybe too popular, and then plenty of movies that need more eyeballs but are a tough argument for placement on a top 10, and what stayed is in no order. Also — so many movies I wanted to include that I realized came out in 2000 or 1989 (“In the Mood for Love”! “Parents”!). There were also incredibly memorable moments and performances in 90’s films that couldn’t fit here (Samantha Morton dancing to “Sweet Pea” in “Jesus’ Son” should be its own whole list). I’m a wreck now, thanks. With all that hand-wringing behind me, here’s 10 of my keepers from a decade I’m stuck being associated with, by virtue of a weird summer job I had when I was 15.\n\n“Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me”\n\nI don’t remember at what point in my first viewing of this incredible, tone-spanning film that people started leaving the theater, but one-by-one the “cherry pie and coffee” fans of the television show walked out — scared, confused and disgusted. I think it’s the strongest in a decade of career-bests for Lynch, which includes the underrated “Straight Story” and “Wild at Heart.” I’m glad that people seem to have finally caught up with this film, derided by critics on its release. Sheryl Lee and Ray Wise are unstoppable here, especially considering how difficult the material is. Also, Moira Kelly is the better of the two Donnas, fight me.\n\n“Careful”\n\nI’ve loved Guy Maddin since seeing “Tales from the Gimli Hospital” on VHS. His first color feature, “Careful,” is surreal and expressionistic, loaded with pathos and unfathomably weird and Canadian.\n\n“Naked”\n\n“Naked” is an unforgettable collision of actors at the height of their abilities working with difficult characters in punishing situations. I hadn’t expected to have quite so much sexual violence on this list, but it’d be impossible for me not to include this unsettling and unflinching achievement by Mike Leigh.\n\n“Barton Fink”\n\nLike Lynch, the Coen Brothers had an incredibly strong decade with “Miller’s Crossing,” “Hudsucker Proxy,” “Fargo,” and “The Big Lebowski” (that was still in the ’90’s?). “Barton Fink” is somehow still my favorite, simultaneously funny and horrifying and mad, following a caricatures of Clifford Odets and William Faulkner as they slum in Hollywood, losing their footing and their minds in the process.\n\n“Princess Mononoke”\n\nBeyond being one of the most beautiful animated films of all time, Miyazaki’s “Princess Mononoke” sets itself apart from so many fantasy stories in its absolute refusal of black-and-white moralizing, and in the way that it defuses and de-escalates its conflict into a sort of homeostasis rather than a righteous hero destroying an unrepentant villain. It was really difficult to pick between this and “Porco Rosso,” which I also love, but “Princess Mononoke” dominated my imagination when it came out, and “Porco Rosso” came out of its shadow only later for me, so I went with “Mononoke.”\n\n“The City of Lost Children”\n\n’90s science fiction in retrospect feels incredibly homogenous to me, all so much bank gothic typefaced soggy rave flyers. “The City of Lost Children” felt fresh, displaced in time (excellent costuming by Gaultier, who seemed to be costuming every science fiction movie around the time, but carefully helped make the mood here).\n\n“Chungking Express”\n\nFresh, expressionistic, beautifully shot, loaded with trademark longing and charm. Like many of the movies on this list I remember seeing it in the Dobie theater in Austin multiple times, caught up in its moody pleasures.\n\n“Beau Travail”\n\nPhysical, musical, haunting and extremely French. An incredible interaction of landscape and bodies in time.\n\n“Slacker”\n\nBefore I had any relationship with Rick Linklater, I’d already seen this movie several times during its run at Austin’s Dobie theater. It was a vertiginous feeling to see the streets and environments I was living in suddenly become cinema, become the main character of a movie, crawling with a variety of people that movies at the time seemed to shun.\n\n“Tetsuo the Iron Man”\n\nThis was an impulse pick. Is Tetsuo a “better” movie than “Ed Wood” or “Silence of the Lambs?” No? Is it a muscular spasm of expressionistic junkpunk madness that kind of bookmarks the 90’s for me? Yes!"
