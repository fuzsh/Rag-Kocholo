She is of Italian descent on her father's side.[4]\n\nShe was raised in Tenafly, New Jersey,[5] where she wrote and acted in backyard plays with her childhood friend Hope Davis, and in theater productions at Dwight-Englewood School.[6] As a child, she was strongly influenced to pursue social causes by her mother, who participated in the March on Washington.[7] Sorvino excelled in high school and was accepted into Harvard University. She studied for one year as an exchange student with CIEE in Nanjing, China, where she studied Mandarin Chinese.[8] In 1989, she graduated from Harvard magna cum laude with a degree in East Asian studies.[9] She also helped found the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, one of Harvard's co-ed a cappella groups, in 1985.[10]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nSorvino's first major screen appearance was in the teen television series Swans Crossing, where she appeared in six episodes.[7] When the 1993 film Amongst Friends entered preproduction, she was hired as third assistant director, then promoted to casting director, then to assistant producer, and finally offered a lead role. The positive reviews she received[11][12] led to more acting opportunities.\n\nAfter supporting roles in Robert Redford's Quiz Show and Whit Stillman's Barcelona, she was cast in Woody Allen's Mighty Aphrodite (1995). Her portrayal of a happy-go-lucky prostitute made her a star, winning her an Academy Award[13] and Golden Globe[14] for Best Supporting Actress. Although the film brought her international recognition, she described its shooting as extremely stressful: \"I was absolutely neurotic doing Mighty Aphrodite,\" she recalled. \"Every night brought a new nervous breakdown. I'd cry and talk to God, I was so nervous. Then the next day, I'd show up and do my scenes.\"[7]\n\nHer other credits include Romy and Michele's High School Reunion with Lisa Kudrow, At First Sight with Val Kilmer, and Spike Lee's Summer of Sam. She portrayed Marilyn Monroe for the 1996 HBO film Norma Jean & Marilyn, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe;[14] and had the lead role in Guillermo del Toro's horror film Mimic.

They have four children: two daughters and two sons. They have also starred in films together such as Indiscretion and Mothers and Daughters.[29][1][30][31]\n\nIn honor of Sorvino's role as Susan Tyler, an entomologist who investigated deadly insect mutations in the film Mimic, a compound that is excreted as a defense mechanism by the sunburst diving beetle was named mirasorvone by the entomologist Thomas Eisner who discovered it.[32][33]\n\nIn September 2014, Sorvino gave a wide-ranging interview on The Nerdist Podcast, where she discussed her education, living in China, and her varied interests.[34] She is a Christian[35][36] and resides with her family in Los Angeles, California.[37]\n\nIn 2017, Sorvino came out publicly about the sexual harassment she endured from producer Harvey Weinstein[38] and believes her career was damaged after she rebuffed Weinstein's advances.[39][40] According to Peter Jackson, Weinstein blocked Sorvino and Ashley Judd, another of his alleged victims, from being considered for parts in The Lord of the Rings films.[41] In 2019 she also made public that she was a date rape victim.[42][43][44]\n\nActivism\n\n[edit]\n\nSorvino has been affiliated with Amnesty International since 2004.[45] In 2006 she was honored with their Artist of Conscience Award, given to those who have made longstanding philanthropic and humanist efforts.
