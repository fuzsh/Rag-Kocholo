        "text": "Paul Auster, the Big Apple-based novelist behind such celebrated books as The New York Trilogy and The Book of Illusions, has died of lung cancer. He was 77.\n\nThe New Jersey-born writer was known for a string of acclaimed works over the past four decades.\n\n“We are very sad to hear of the death of Booker Prize shortlistee Paul Auster, whose work touched readers and influenced writers all over the world, and whose generosity was felt in just as many quarters,” the Booker Prizes posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe literary body shortlisted his book “4 3 2 1” for its award in 2017.\n\nThe author of more than 30 books, including “The New York Trilogy,” “The Book of Illusions,” and “Moon Palace,” told Reuters in 2011 he liked to write by hand in notebooks and then produce the finished copy on a typewriter rather than a computer.\n\n“I feel more alive when I’m working,” he said.\n\n“I am convinced that writing is a kind of illness. Who would want to spend his life sitting in a room, putting words on paper? It’s a strange occupation. You got to have a great taste for solitude.”\n\nAuster’s works have often received the Hollywood treatment.\n\nHis novel The Music of Chance was made into a film starring James Spader in 1993.\n\nAuster’s screenplays include “Smoke,” starring Harvey Keitel, and “Lulu on the Bridge” with Keitel and Mira Sorvino.\n\nAuster also directed three films himself, including Blue in the Face — a follow-up to “Smoke” — and Lulu on the Bridge.\n\nAuster was plagued by family tragedy in recent years as his granddaughter Ruby died in November 2021 after ingesting heroin and fentanyl while in the care of his son Daniel.\n\nDaniel Auster was arrested and charged with manslaughter in Ruby’s death in April 2022, but died of a drug overdose days after he was bailed out of Rikers Island.\n\nWith Post wires"
