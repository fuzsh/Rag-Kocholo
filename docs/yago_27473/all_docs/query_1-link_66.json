        "text": "Kids These Days\n\nHaley needs a little motherly advice from Claire as she considers her future with Dylan and her career. Meanwhile, Jay and Camâs less than politically correct coaching style earns them a class on sensitivity from Manny and Phil; and Mitch runs into Philâs nemesis, Gil, at an unlikely place.\n\nThe Escape\n\nHaley meets Arvinâs parents but when things donât go as planned, fate leads to an unexpected reunion with all of her ex-boyfriends. Meanwhile, the family seizes on a nursing home visit with Jayâs mean sister, Becky, to settle old scores. But as Jay, Claire and Mitchell compete for her time, Phil, Cam and Gloria end up getting trapped in the homeâs basement with no way out.\n\nFrozen\n\nWhen Dr. Cate Milton (guest star Mira Sorvino), a psychiatrist trapped at the South Pole and the research station's only doctor, becomes ill in the middle of her assignment, she and Dr. House are thrust into a long-distance relationship of sorts. Unable to get Cate out or any additional medical supplies to the South Pole station, House and his team must resort to treating her via webcam. House and his team walk the doctor through a series of makeshift and painful diagnostic tests she must perform on herself. Cate pushes back at House's every recommendation, and is unwilling to risk valuable station medical supplies until he can provide valid proof for his diagnoses each step of the way. While House and his team helplessly watch her condition worsen, House's usually icy demeanor surprisingly softens as he searches for ways to save her life. Meanwhile, House does some detective work of his own and is surprised to learn who Wilson has been dating."
