        "text": "The Big House, Pt. 2\n\nWhen the warden (guest star Toby Huss) asks Jake to investigate Romeroâs (guest star Lou Diamond Phillips) drug smuggling operation, Jake and Caleb (guest star Tim Meadows) find themselves caught between the loyalty Jake has sworn to both of them. Meanwhile, Amy is offered a deal by a local mobster who claims he can prove that Hawkins (guest star Gina Gershon) is guilty, but Holt and the rest of the gang think they have a safer plan.\n\nAmerican Duos\n\nWhen the latest incarnation of American Idol rip-off shows sets up shop at the Arlington Theatre, the requisite cruel British judge (Tim Curry) finds himself in a panic after a series of near-miss attempts on his life. Police protection has been barely sufficient and now he's taking matters into his own hands to ward off his inevitable attacker, hiring Santa Barbara's most reliable psychic detective to protect him.\n\nAn Ear for an Ear\n\nAfter one of New York's most sought-after plastic surgeons is found dead, Elsbeth has her eye on the victim's former boss, Dr. Vanessa Holmes, who she believes has motives that are more than skin-deep.\n\nYour Honor\n\nCaptain Holtâs mom (guest star L. Scott Caldwell) seeks support from the precinct after her house is robbed. Meanwhile, Terry, Rosa and Boyle remodel the breakroom and Amy teaches Gina how to change her own car tire."
