        "text": "Paul Auster (born February 3, 1947, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.—died April 30, 2024, Brooklyn, New York) was an American novelist, essayist, translator, screenwriter, and poet whose complex novels, several of which are mysteries, are often concerned with the search for identity and personal meaning.\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia University (M.A., 1970), Auster moved to France, where he began translating the works of French writers and publishing his own work in American journals. He gained renown for a series of experimental detective stories published collectively as The New York Trilogy (1987). It comprises City of Glass (1985), about a crime novelist who becomes entangled in a mystery that causes him to assume various identities; Ghosts (1986), about a private eye known as Blue who is investigating a man named Black for a client named White; and The Locked Room (1986), the story of an author who, while researching the life of a missing writer for a biography, gradually assumes the identity of that writer.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPoetry: First Lines\n\nOther books that feature protagonists who are obsessed with chronicling someone else’s life are the novels Moon Palace (1989) and Leviathan (1992). The Invention of Solitude (1982) is both a memoir about the death of his father and a meditation on the act of writing. Auster also penned several verse volumes including Unearth (1974) and Wall Writing (1976) as well as the essay collections White Spaces (1980) and The Art of Hunger (1982).\n\nFurther novels included The Music of Chance (1990) and Mr. Vertigo (1994). The Book of Illusions (2002) traces a writer’s immersion in the oeuvre of an obscure silent film star as he copes with his grief at the deaths of his wife and children in a plane crash. Travels in the Scriptorium (2007) centres on an unidentified man as he attempts to discern his own identity and how he came to be in the room where he sits—all the while receiving a series of characters from earlier works by Auster. Man in the Dark (2008) chronicles an aged and miserable literary critic’s sleepless night, during which a dystopian alternate reality unfolds in his mind, while Sunset Park (2010) concerns the travails of a group of young artists illegally inhabiting an abandoned building in Brooklyn.\n\nBecause much of Auster’s fiction explores ideas of the self—and often features the author in variously explicit and veiled incarnations—critics frequently speculated on the extent to which he employed elements of autobiography. The biography of the protagonist of Invisible (2009), for example, closely resembles Auster’s own, but the high drama of the plot—which delves into murder and incest—is clearly fictional. Though expressly nonfiction, the pointedly unstudied and fragmentary Winter Journal (2012) was written in the second person and comprised self-reflective meditations interspersed with enumerations of Auster’s experiences, preferences, and travels. A companion volume, Report from the Interior (2013), arrayed a similarly eclectic selection of anecdotes alongside deeper analyses of some of his cinematic influences and a selection of letters exchanged with his ex-wife, writer Lydia Davis. Auster’s first novel in seven years, 4 3 2 1, was published in 2017. The book offers four variations of each chapter, so that its main character, Archie Ferguson, experiences four alternate lives. The nonfiction works Talking to Strangers: Selected Essays, Prefaces, and Other Writings, 1967–2017 and Groundwork: Autobiographical Writings, 1979–2012 appeared in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Auster later published the biography Burning Boy: The Life and Work of Stephen Crane (2021)."
