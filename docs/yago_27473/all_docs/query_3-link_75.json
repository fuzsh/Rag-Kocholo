        "text": "The trick to any good sitcom is to come up with a believable enough reason for a small number of characters to spend a lot of time together – ideally in a situation that has got enough mileage for some built-in comic potential; say an office, a bar or a run-down hotel …\n\nIf you saw the opening episode last week, you’ll know that the setup for Crashing (Channel 4) is a pretty modern riff on the flat-share option. The gang are “property guardians” – young professionals who are spread out in a disused hospital, living in big, empty rooms and keeping the building safe in exchange for cheap rent and a strict set of rules. “You’re not allowed to have parties, cook meals, to have sex, light candles or smoke – it’s a riot,” deadpanned nihilistic French painter Melody, chain-smoking her way through the opener.\n\nThey are legal squatters, a generation-rent Friends for austerity Britain. There are no niggling questions about how these twentysomethings can afford designer flats and a lifestyle above their means: the shelves are falling off the walls, medical equipment litters their makeshift bedrooms, the ground outside is a demolition site and, in this second episode, Kate narrowly avoids electrocution from a light while in the bath.\n\nLike Scrotal Recall (a funny and sweet sitcom cursed with one of the worst titles in recent years), Crashing also mines the When Harry Met Sally conundrum for its narrative drive. Can straight men and women be friends without jumping into bed with each other? Lulu (played with goofy charm by the show’s creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge) has stumbled back into the life of childhood best friend Anthony (Damien Molony), a chef in a pretentious no-cutlery restaurant – a “contemporary reinterpretation of the traditional north African hand-to-mouth dining etiquette” called We Don’t Give a Fork. He’s engaged to Kate (Louise Ford), a woman so uptight she spends that “relaxing” bath trying to blow out as many candles as she can (stick to the rules).\n\nKate goes out of her way to prove just how relaxed she is about Lulu moving in: she gets Lulu a job as a receptionist in her events planning office (and spends the rest of the episode planning how to get her sacked).\n\nElsewhere, the supremely confident Sam (Jonathan Bailey) cons Fred (Amit Shah) into bunking off work with him, only to “stumble” across his family scattering his dad’s ashes in a duck pond, while older divorcee Colin (Adrian Scarborough) gets talked into moving in to the hospital by Melody (“I think you would like being painted, I will be generous with your penis”). It’s these tonal flips between frank and filthy, sad and weird that give Crashing enough of an edge to make it feel fresh; that and lines such as: “I think my tampon just came out a bit.”\n\nMore comedy as Tracey Ullman’s Show (BBC1) continued. She hammed it up as the Duchess of Cornwall, all wellies and dressing gown, grumpily agreeing to babysit Prince George (“I’m not bloody Yoda! Who calls me Yoda?”); Dame Judi Dench unleashed a five-star mission of destruction, while milking her status as a national treasure (“I’d hardly spend my mornings blocking toilets in five-star hotels in London just because I could get away with it,” she bluffs when a toilet attendant calls her on it); while Angela Merkel broke out of her uptight diplomacy rountine by jazz-scatting her way through an official reception (“Eins, zwei, drei, vier, get me an Uber over here”). Ullman is at her best in these lighter celeb sketches, but on much sketchier ground in scenes such as the Midlands couple who arrive home from holiday, discover an illegal immigrant clinging on under their motorhome and take him in to teach him about life in Britain (“Do you think he’d like to watch Eggheads?”)."
