At Metrograph's screening of a 35mm print on loan from MoMA, attended by Tim Squyres, who is also Ang Lee's incredibly longtime editor (Gemini Man; Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk; Life Of Pi; Taking Woodstock; Hulk; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Lust, Caution; Ride With The Devil; The Ice Storm; Sense And Sensibility; The Wedding Banquet; Eat Drink Man Woman; Pushing Hands, and Gideon Raff's upcoming The Red Sea Diving Resort), Paul Auster in a conversation with Jake Perlin said that originally he was hoping Wim Wenders would direct his Lulu On The Bridge screenplay with Juliette Binoche on-board to star.

After he co-directed Smoke and Blue In The Face with Wayne Wang, Auster actually did not want to make another film. But the fates conspired.

Paul Auster: I didn't want to make another film. I wanted to get back to writing books. So I said, maybe I could turn it into a novel and I tried but it was meant to be a film. You have to see all of this somehow. The fact is, I was dithering with it and tinkering with it, and then my good friend Wim Wenders, who gets a credit here, he said he had been working with Juliette Binoche, talking for years about a project to do Lulu, somehow. A new version of [Frank Wedekind's] Lulu.

He said for years they couldn't figure out how to do it. And he said: "Paul will figure it out." And actually I was in Berlin, Smoke has won the German Best Foreign Film award. And we were having dinner, and I said: "Well, I do have this thing to get out of my head. And maybe Lulu could be integrated into it." And I started working on the script for Wim. It was going to be his and hers. And they were both in.

And then, first she won the Academy Award [Best Actress in a Supporting Role in The English Patient] and got all crazy about what she wanted to do next. And then Wim had other conflicts, commitments. And he said: "You know, I think you should direct it yourself." So I said "Yeah, I probably should." I kind of stumbled into it that way â€¦ There's a whole heart of the film that got cut out. There were four or five scenes of Lulu [the film within the film directed by Vanessa Redgrave as Catherine Moore] in the movie.

Combining a game played by Celia Burns (Mira Sorvino) and Izzy Maurer (Harvey Keitel) in Lulu on the Bridge, with the titles of two of the three movie posters prominently displayed during a scene, I asked the following question:
