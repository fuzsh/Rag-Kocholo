        "text": "The Magic Mike star hails from the Heart of Dixie! He was born in Cullman, Alabama, but his family moved to Mississippi when he was six.\n\nTatum's newest project is The Lost City of D. He plays a romance cover model who goes on a book tour with the less-than-excited novelist (Sandra Bullock). The two are subsequently caught up in a kidnapping attempt that lands them in the middle of the jungle.\n\nShe may have won an Oscar for her role in La La Land but Scottsdale was Stone's first home.\n\nStone's new Disney villain origin story, Cruella, has amassed more than $180 million at the box office. A sequel is already in development.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor/director is a Hot Springs native who made his way to Los Angeles in the '80s.\n\nSince 2016, Thornton has starred in Goliath on Amazon Prime Video, in which he plays a down-and-out lawyer seeking redemption. He won a Golden Globe for Best Actor - Television Series Drama for the role.\n\nMany celebrities hail from California, but this makeup mogul is a born and bred Golden State gal.\n\nNot only is her famous family practically royalty in Los Angeles (and, well, everywhere), Jenner still lives in her hometown of Calabasas.\n\nThe Centennial State is where this Last Man Standing star got his start.\n\nThe comedian and actor was born in Denver, but there's a reason he's so associated with Michigan -- he moved to the Mitten State in his early teens.\n\nThe \"Thank U, Next\" singer is originally from the Sunshine State, living in Boca Raton before moving west to pursue her career.\n\nGrande's most recent album, Positions, was a critical and commercial. She has been the most-followed woman on Instagram since 2019.\n\nThough he was raised in Norwalk, Iowa, the Aquaman and Game of Thrones actor was born in Honolulu.\n\nMomoa has a starring role in the highly anticipated Denis Villeneuve film Dune, which is scheduled to be released on Oct. 22, 2021.\n\nBefore you knew him from Breaking Bad, BoJack Horseman and The Path, the Emmy-winning actor spent his formulative years in Emmett.\n\nPaul recently starred in the third season of the award-winning HBO show Westworld. The show has been renewed for a fourth season, but it's unknown if his character will return.\n\nThe larger-than-life rapper was three when he moved to Chicago.
