        "text": "New York is one of the most recognizable and famous cities on the planet. Many people, for example, mistakenly think that this particular city is the capital of the United States! Probably every person who watched Hollywood films, the actions of which take place in this city, wanted to visit New York. The metropolis on the east coast of the United States has a vast territory, the geography of which is unique and interesting to study among both travelers and locals.\n\nNew York is divided not into districts, but into boroughs - administrative units, which are actually separate cities that became part of the agglomeration on a voluntary basis. Boroughs have great autonomy and their own history. The agglomeration of New York consists of 5 boroughs: the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn.\n\nBrooklyn\n\nBrooklyn is a well-known area among people, since it is here that the largest community of immigrants from the former Soviet republics in the country is located. Up to half a million Slavs live in New York, and most of them live in the Brighton Beach area.\n\nBrooklyn is inhabited by about 2.5 million urban dwellers, half of whom are African-American peoples and immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries. Many of the hospitals and hospitals operating in the borough are open and funded by the Jewish community, which is also numerous in Brooklyn. The multicultural nature of Brooklyn makes this part of New York the most populous in the city and the second most popular among visitors.\n\nAt the time of its inception, Brooklyn was a settlement of Dutch colonists and bore a similar, but different name - Broukelen. In the middle of the century before last, the area became the most important country, and now it is considered the industrial center of New York. The future borough became part of the agglomeration in 1898, merging with Manhattan.\n\nBrooklyn is a place where the pace of life is not as high as in the rest of the city. Boro has an impressive list of attractions worth visiting:\n\nEspanad Embankment;\n\nGreenwood Cemetery;\n\nBrooklyn Heights district;\n\nProspect Park;\n\nConey Island.\n\nQueens\n\nThe part of New York, which is the birthplace of Spider-Man, has become a sleeping area of the city, so there are not so many interesting locations here. Queens is chosen by travelers as a place to rent accommodation, because the prices here are much lower than in other areas of the city.\n\nQueens is the largest borough of New York by area and the second largest after Brooklyn in terms of population - it is inhabited by about 2.3 million people. 10% of the population of the multinational area is occupied by immigrants from China, there are also many Spaniards, Irish and Italians. In Queens, there is an area called Astoria - this is the largest Greek community in the country and the world.\n\nThe main attraction of the area is the large stadium City Field, where the local famous baseball team \"Mets\" often hosts matches.\n\nManhattan\n\nThe Borough of New York, located on the island of the same name, is the most popular destination in the city, and possibly in the country. The place is considered the financial, historical and cultural center of the city, and it is here that the famous skyscrapers that we have seen in hundreds of films are built. In addition to Manhattan, there are almost no high-rise buildings in New York - their absolute majority are concentrated here.\n\nUntil European colonists came to the territory of the city, Manhattan was inhabited by indigenous Indians and called the island Mannahatt - the place of many hills. The island was bought by the natives for just a few dollars and a couple of jewelry, and Manhattan began to be inhabited by the Dutch.\n\nDespite its huge popularity, Manhattan is the smallest borough of New York - its area is only 59 square kilometers. This territory is home to 1.5 million people - the island is the leader in population density among all areas.\n\nThe island is clearly divided into 5 districts, and Manhattan is the most convenient place in the city, because here it is easiest to get to the desired location. Each of the administrative districts of the island has its own attractions, which made this borough a legendary place.\n\nOn the southern part of Manhattan is downtown - the financial and political center of the city. It is in Downtown that the local Stock Exchange is located, as well as Wall Street - the location from the legendary film with Leonardo DiCaprio. Downtown is also home to large diasporas of Italians and Chinese â€“ Chinatown and Little Italy. The most famous buildings in the city are located in areas called Uptown and Midtown - the upper and central parts of the island. It is here that the most visited buildings of New York are located - the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the UN Headquarters, the New World Trade Center. Also in Midtown is Times Square , a square that almost every person in the world knows.\n\nWashington Heights and Harlem are areas that are not distinguished by prosperity and often serve as filming locations for action movies and films about criminals. At the end of the last century, local gangs staged shootouts here, and even now criminal gangs are hiding in Harlem and Washington Heights. It is not recommended to enter Harlem at night, as there is a high probability of leaving there robbed or beaten. Harlem is inhabited mainly by African Americans, and light-skinned tourists there are rare.\n\nStaten Island\n\nA large borough is inhabited by very few people - about 480 thousand people. The area is located at a distance from the rest of the city, so Staten Island has a second, unofficial name - Forgotten Island.\n\nStaten Island is the safest place in the city, so more and more New York citizens are thinking about moving here, because here, in addition to safety, a quiet and measured pace of life, which is not in Manhattan. Citizens buy housing here, and go to work in New Jersey or work from home.\n\nBronx\n\nThe Bronx is located north of the rest of the borough of the city and is the only one located on the mainland of the country. Now about 1.5 million people live on 109 square meters. km, but once the only person who inhabited the area was a farmer Jonas Bronx. He rented out these lands, and over time, people began to come to this place. The area is recognized as the most environmentally friendly in the city, there are many parks and squares.\n\nThe Bronx is the birthplace of rap and breakdancing, however, tourists come to this part of the city to look at the local zoo, which is the largest in New York and one of the largest in the United States. The local stadium regularly hosts baseball games, where the legendary Team New York Yankees - the favorite sports club of the Bronx residents - performs."
