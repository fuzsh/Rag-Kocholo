        "text": "This story was originally published in 2016 and has been updated.\n\nThe Garden State’s 21 counties are not created equal when it comes to producing celebrities. While Essex County is a literal fame factory, other areas have hardly any household names to claim. Here are our choices for the biggest name from each of the state’s 21 counties, along with a list of runners-up.\n\nNote: We only considered celebrities who are still alive, and who spent most of their formative years here.\n\nAtlantic County: Benjamin Burnley\n\nBenjamin Burnley, founder and lead singer for Breaking Benjamin (“The Diary of Jane,” “Give Me a Sign”) straddles two counties, having been born in Atlantic City but having spent some of his childhood in Ocean City. We’ll credit him to Atlantic County — though he recently returned to Ocean City with his wife and son to raise his son at the Jersey Shore.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nSuzette Charles, replaced Vanessa Williams as Miss America 1984, was born and raised in Mays Landing.\n\nTori Ann Gisondi, played Molly the orphan in 1982 film ‘Annie,’ was born and raised in Egg Harbor Township.\n\nBergen County: John Travolta\n\nWith the largest county population in the state, it’s not surprising that Bergen has produced its share of celebrities. Actor John Travolta was born and raised in Englewood and attended Dwight Morrow High School until dropping out as a 17-year-old junior and moving to New York, where he landed a role in the movie musical “Grease.”\n\nRunners-up:\n\nNFL Coach Bill Parcells, born in Englewood, attended River Dell High School, and moved to Upper Saddle River after retirement.\n\nSinger/actress Lea Michele moved to Tenafly at age 4, and graduated from Tenafly High School.\n\nSinger Nick Jonas, raised in Wyckoff, was discovered at 8 while singing in a barber shop.\n\nBurlington County: Carl Lewis\n\nOlympian Carl Lewis, who won a total of nine gold medals in four Olympics, was born in Birmingham, Alabama, but was raised in Willingboro, where he began his track career. Given the relative lack of celebs from the county, he far outpaces the competition.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nOlympic soccer champion Carli Lloyd was born and raised in Delran.\n\nActress Calista Flockhart was raised in Medford.\n\nCamden County: Kelly Ripa\n\nShe first showed up on daytime TV as a young Goth punk on “All My Children.” Now she hosts one of the most popular and Emmy-award winning morning talk shows on air. Ripa was born and raised in Stratford, where she graduated from Eastern Regional High School in Voorhees, and attended Camden County College.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens quarterback and Super Bowl champion (and current Jets backup quarterback?) Joe Flacco was born and raised in Audubon, and graduated from Audubon High School.\n\nMitch Albom, author of “The Five People You Meet in Heaven,” was born in Passaic but his family later moved to Oaklyn, where he grew up.\n\nCape May County: Stedman Graham\n\nWhile many people — regular Joes and celebrities — visit the southernmost point of New Jersey, not many who were born there have made it to stardom. So Stedman Graham, better known as “Oprah’s boyfriend,” takes the top spot in Cape May. Born and raised in the Whitesboro section of Middle Township, Graham graduated from Middle Township High School.\n\nRunner-up:\n\nWriter Gay Talese was born and raised in Ocean City, graduated from Ocean City High School, and wrote for Ocean City Sentinel-Ledger.\n\nCumberland County: Mike Trout\n\nLos Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout — or the Millville Meteor, as he is called now — isn’t just widely considered the best player in baseball. Many say he’ll end his Hall of Fame career in the discussion for the greatest player of all time. Trout, an eight-time All-Star, was born and raised in Millville and graduated from Millville Senior High School. Trout was named American League Rookie of the Year in 2012, and MVP in 2014, 2016 and 2019.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nPotter and boutique owner Jonathan Adler grew up in Bridgeton, and now owns 28 home decor and accessories stores worldwide.\n\nWawa president and CEO Chris Gheysens, was born and raised in Vineland, currently lives in Moorestown, and spends his summers in Sea Isle City.\n\nEssex County: Shaquille O’Neal\n\nEssex is a hotbed of fame, and while choosing a “most famous” was tough, we had to go with basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal. Born in Newark, O’Neal credits the Boys and Girls Club of America in his hometown for keeping him off the streets, and giving him a place to learn how to play basketball while growing up.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nSongstress Dionne Warwick was born and raised in East Orange, and began singing gospel at Hope Church in Newark.\n\nQueen Latifah was born in Newark, raised in East Orange, attended Catholic high school in Newark, and lived for a time in Colts Neck.\n\nSinger Frankie Valli was born in Newark, and had his life story turned into the Broadway musical “Jersey Boys.”\n\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin, who was one of the first to walk on the moon, graduated from Montclair High School.\n\nActor Joe Pesci, born in Newark, was raised in Belleville, graduated form Belleville High School, and owns a home in Lavallette.\n\nActress Anne Hathaway was raised in Millburn, attended Millburn High School, and was once nominated for Paper Mill Playhouse’s Rising Star award.\n\nLifestyle expert Martha Stewart was born in Jersey City, but moved to Nutley at 3, and graduated from Nutley High School.\n\nGloucester County: Patti Smith\n\nSome celebrities, such as singer Patti Smith, weren’t born in the Garden State, but got here as soon as they could. Smith was born in Chicago, Illinois, but later moved to Pitman, and then Deptford, where she graduated from Deptford High School in 1964. In 1967, she moved to Manhattan and has since released 11 studio albums, as well as two award-winning memoirs.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nFormer NFL offensive tackle Bryant McKinnie was born in Woodbury and played at Woodbury High School before being named First Team All-American twice at Miami and then winning a Super Bowl with the Baltimore Ravens in 2013.\n\nHudson County: Nathan Lane\n\nHudson has quite a few familiar faces, but Nathan Lane, actor of stage and screen, takes the top spot for celebs in this county. Lane was born in Jersey City where he attended Catholic schools. He is most well-known for his role in “The Producers,” and as the voice of Timon in Disney’s “The Lion King.”\n\nRunners-up:\n\nHoward Stern’s “Wack Pack” personality Lester “Beetlejuice” Green was born in Jersey City, and got his nickname while living in the Marion Garden projects there.\n\nActor Joe “Joey Pants” Pantoliano was born and raised in Hoboken.\n\nThe Bayonne Bleeder, former heavyweight boxer Chuck Wepner, was born and still lives in Bayonne.\n\nHunterdon County: Vera Farmiga\n\nHunterdon County’s list of celebrity residents is quite short — one person in length, as a matter of fact. But that person is actress Vera Farmiga, a very successful actress who has become known for her role in “The Conjuring” horror films. She was born in Clifton and raised in a Ukrainian-American community in Irvington. At 12, she moved to Whitehouse Station, but she attended St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Catholic School in Newark. She graduated from Hunterdon Central Regional High School in 1991.\n\nMercer County: Jon Stewart\n\nMercer County’s celebrity population isn’t huge, but comedian Jon Stewart makes up for a lack of stars. He was born in New York City but raised in Lawrenceville, where he attended Lawrence High School. He attempted college but dropped out and returned to Jersey, where he held odd jobs including bartending at the legendary City Gardens in Trenton. Stewart and his wife live in Middletown, where they operate an animal sanctuary.\n\nRunner-up:\n\nMusician Trey Anastasio, vocalist and guitarist for Phish, moved to Princeton at 3, and attended public school there before transferring to Princeton Day School in fifth grade.\n\nMiddlesex County: Jon Bon Jovi\n\nOur three celebrities from Middlesex are all big names, but clearly Jon Bon Jovi is the face of New Jersey — at least for the ‘80s generation. Born John Francis Bongiovi in Perth Amboy, he attended St. Joseph High School in Metuchen and Sayreville War Memorial High School in Parlin. He and his wife currently live in Middletown.\n\nRunners up:\n\nActress Susan Sarandon was raised in Edison and graduated from Edison High School. She was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nMagician David Copperfield was born in Metuchen and graduated from Metuchen High School. As a child, he attended Camp Harmony in Warren, where he discovered his talent for magic.\n\nMonmouth County: Bruce Springsteen\n\nEven though the competition was tight, musician Bruce Springsteen takes the top spot in Monmouth. Born in Long Branch and raised in Freehold, Springsteen graduated from Freehold Borough High School and later attended Ocean County College before dropping out and focusing on his musical career. He and his family currently live on a horse farm in Colts Neck.\n\nRunners up:\n\nActor Danny DeVito was born in Neptune Township and was raised in Asbury Park, although he attended Oratory Preparatory School in Summit.\n\nFilmmaker Kevin Smith, born and raised in Red Bank, still lives in Jersey and owns “Jay and Silent Bob’s Secret Stash” comic store in Red Bank.\n\nActor Jack Nicholson grew up in Neptune City, moved to Spring Lake, and graduated from Manasquan High School.\n\nMorris County: Jane Krakowski\n\nOur top choice for Morris is Jane Krakowski, an actress famous for her role in “30 Rock” and her work on Broadway. Krakowski was born and raised in Parsippany-Troy Hills. She attended Rutgers University in New Brunswick before making her break into television on the soap opera “Search for Tomorrow.”\n\nRunner-up:\n\nAuthor and public speaker Fran Lebowitz was born and raised in Morristown.\n\nOcean County: Kirsten Dunst\n\nNo matter what role this Jersey Shore native takes on, we’ll always remember actress Kirsten Dunst as the feisty cheerleader in “Bring It On.” Dunst was born in Point Pleasant and lived in Brick Township until she was 11 years old. She was attending Ranney School when her parents separated, and she moved to Los Angeles with her mother.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nActress Piper Perabo was raised in Toms River and graduated from Toms River High School North.\n\nPassaic County: Joe Piscopo\n\nBorn in Passaic, Piscopo grew up in North Caldwell, where he attended West Essex High School. He’s best known for his work on “Saturday Night Live,” where he coined the catchphrase “You from Jersey? What exit?” as the character Paulie Herman from Piscataway. He now lives in Lebanon Township.\n\nRunners up:\n\nHip hop singer Fetty Wap, from Paterson, was one of the biggest names in rap in 2015 with hits like “Trap Queen” and “679.”\n\nFormer New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz was born in Paterson and graduated from Paterson Catholic High School.\n\nOur most (in)famous Real Housewife, Teresa Giudice, was born in Paterson and currently lives in Montville Township.\n\nSports announcer Dick Vitale was born in Passaic, although his family eventually moved to Bergen County and he graduated from East Rutherford High School.\n\nSalem County: Bruce Willis\n\nSalem County may be the smallest county in population, but it can claim one of our most famous names: Bruce Willis. The actor was born in Germany while his father was stationed there with the military, but moved to Penns Grove when he was 2 and graduated from Penns Grove High School in 1973. He worked as a security guard at PSE&G and enrolled at Montclair State University, where he decided he wanted to become an actor.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nIce hockey player Johnny Gaudreau, born and raised in Oldmans Township, attended Gloucester Catholic High School in Gloucester City.\n\nComedian Ritch Shydner was born and raised in Pennsville, and graduated from Pennsville Memorial High School.\n\nSomerset County: Meryl Streep\n\nOscar-winning actress Meryl Streep is far and away the most famous from this county. Although born in Summit, Streep was raised in Bernardsville. She was chosen to sing in a school recital at age 12 and began taking opera lessons, but realized singing wasn’t her thing. Ironically, neither was acting until she appeared in the play, “Miss Julie” at Vassar College in 1969.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nEditor-in-chief of Forbes magazine Steve Forbes was born in Morristown and grew up in Far Hills where he attended the prestigious Far Hills Country Day School.\n\nSussex County: Janeane Garofalo\n\nWith not quite 150,000 people, Sussex County has but one famous native — actress/comedian Janeane Garofalo. Garofalo was born in Newton, although her family eventually moved to Madison. She began her career as a stand-up comedian and rose to fame on “Saturday Night Live” and in movies like “Reality Bites.”\n\nUnion County: Judy Blume\n\nOne of the most revered children’s authors of the last century, Judy Blume was born and raised in Elizabeth, graduated from Battin High School, and later lived in Plainfield and Scotch Plains. For 50 years now, countless youths have enjoyed her most famous titles “Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret,” “Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing” and “Superfudge,” among many others.\n\nRunner up:\n\nComedian Artie Lange was born in Livingston, but grew up in Union Township.\n\nWarren County: Jason Voorhees\n\nBeing the third smallest county in the state and after losing musician Lou Reed in 2013, Warren County doesn’t have much celebrity representation. But let us not forget the legend of serial killer Jason Voorhees emerged from a certain lake at Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco in Hardwick Township in the horror series “Friday the 13th.”"
