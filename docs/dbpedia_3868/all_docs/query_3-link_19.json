        "text": "New York City is one of the world’s all-time biggest hot spots, full of towering buildings and thousands of different people. NYC is home to some of the top business leaders, leading entrepreneurs, and several A-list celebrities, some of which claim the city as a second home away from cities like Los Angeles or Miami. Celebrity sightings are not uncommon on any given day while touring the Financial District or Central Park.\n\nHere are a few of the biggest celebrities who call NYC home.\n\n1- Robert De Niro\n\nRoberto De Niro rose to fame for his collaborations with filmmaker Martin Scorsese. He has won various awards, including two Academy Awards.\n\nDe Niro is a native New Yorker (he was born in Manhattan). In 2006, he purchased a house in Central Park West located in the Lincoln Square area of Manhattan. In 2014, he purchased a pre-war apartment at Morton Street in the West Village. He also owns a large estate in Hudson Valley.\n\n2- Al Pacino\n\nAl Pacino stunned the world as Michael Corleone in The Godfather trilogy. His other famous work is Scent of a Woman (1992), and Scarface (1983). Pacino calls Central Park Place home.\n\n3- Peter Dinklage\n\nGame of Thrones might be over, but fans the world over recognize Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. Dinklage has lived in New York for several years. He lived in Williamsburg before relocating to an elegant apartment in Upstate New York.
