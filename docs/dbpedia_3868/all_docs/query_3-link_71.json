        "text": "Check out some of the celebrities who call Long Island home.\n\nLONG ISLAND, NY â€” More than 3 million live on Long Island. Over the years, many in the population have become more than a face in the large crowd, they became famous.\n\nIn this edition of Before They Were Famous, we'll look at some of the well-known actors who were born or were raised in Nassau or Suffolk counties.\n\nThe Baldwins: Alec Baldwin is the most famous of the siblings and the only born in Amityville, but the family moved to Massapequa, where brothers Daniel, Billy and Stephen came into the world.\n\nLorraine Bracco: Famed for \"The Sopranos,\" as Dr. Melfi, and before that her Oscar-nominated performance as Ray Liotta's wife in \"Goodfellas,\" Bracco is from Brooklyn but grew up in Westbury. She's a graduate of Hicksville High School.\n\nEdward Burns: Perhaps best known for his role in \"Saving Private Ryan,\" Burns was born in Woodside, Queens, but raised in Valley Stream. He attended Chaminade High School before being transferred to Hewlett High School.\n\nSteve Buscemi: From \"Boardwalk Empire\" to \"The Sopranos,\" Buscemi graduated from Valley Stream High School.\n\nBilly Crystal: His career dates back a half-century from stand-up to movies and the Academy Awards hosting, but Crystal is a native of Long Beach, graduating from the high school and going to Nassau Community College. Even though he's been a West Coast guy for years, Crystal didn't forget his roots when he donated $1 million to help rebuild Long Beach's boardwalk after Superstorm Sandy a decade ago.\n\nEdie Falco: There is a theme here, as another star of \"The Sopranos\" is from Long Island. The multiple-Emmy award winner for her role as Carmela Soprano is a Northport High School graduate.\n\n(Information provided by longisland.com)\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
