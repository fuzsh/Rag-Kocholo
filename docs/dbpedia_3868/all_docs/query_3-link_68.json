        "text": "Who are the best athletes to ever go pro in North Dakota?\n\nOkay, before you tell me how wrong I am...I know this is a very subjective list. For example, I'm a big hockey guy. Probably the guy who deserves to be on this list, he has more points than any other North Dakotan who played in the NHL and didn't even make my cut. His name is Paul Gaustad from Fargo, who had over 200 points in the NHL. To be honest, I've never heard of him, so therefore, he did not make my list.\n\nThe criteria I used to compile \"The Most Famous Athletes To Go Pro In North Dakota\" are the following.\n\nFirst, they had to spend the majority of their youth growing up in North Dakota. Not necessarily born in North Dakota. Second, they needed some longevity in the pros. Not just a cup of coffee kind of player. Lastly, it helped if they made an impact playing sports in North Dakota either in high school or college.\n\nI also tried to get a mixture of the four major pro sports, NFL, MLB, NBA & NHL. I even included our most famous boxer from North Dakota, who went pro and had a tremendous career.\n\nAs I was researching the four major sports, I was very surprised that Bismarck has only had one person make it to the show (MLB) (Jay Flaa). As somebody who played youth, legion & amateur baseball in North Dakota, (Grand Forks) I played against some very good Bismarck teams. If there is anybody else you can think of from Bismarck who has made it to the majors please let me know.\n\nFargo has the most MLB players with 4. Grand Forks is next with 3. Bismarck has however produced NFL & NHL talent.\n\nSo, without further ado here's my top 13 list. Enjoy, and let me know who you think I left out and should've made it.\n\nThe Most Famous Athletes To Go Pro In North Dakota"
