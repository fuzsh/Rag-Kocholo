        "text": "About the Bridge\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nPrevious Contracts\n\nUpcoming Contracts\n\nAbout the Bridge\n\nThe iconic Brooklyn Bridge connects Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights. Known for its stone arches, the Brooklyn Bridge supports six lanes of vehicles (no trucks) and a shared pedestrian and bicycle path. As of 2018, an average of over 116,000 vehicles, 30,000 pedestrians and 3,000 cyclists travel over the Brooklyn Bridge each day.\n\nBridge Facts\n\nTotal length of bridge and approaches: 6,016 feet\n\nMain span: 1,595.5 feet\n\nClearance at center: 135 feet\n\nHistory\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge was designed by John A. Roebling. Construction began in 1869 and was completed in 1883. At the time, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world. The Brooklyn Bridge connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River.\n\nBecause of the elevation of the span above the East River and the relatively low-lying shores, the rest of the bridge, sloping down to ground level, extends quite far inland on both sides of the river.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1954, a comprehensive reconstruction took place. The inner and outer trusses were strengthened, new horizontal stays were installed between the four main cables, the railroad and trolley tracks were removed, the roadways were widened from two lanes to three lanes, and new approach ramps were constructed. Additional approach ramps to the FDR Drive were opened to traffic in 1969.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972. The bridge and multiple Manhattan and Brooklyn lots comprising the approaches were designated as NYC Landmarks in 1967. In recent decades, the structure has been refurbished to handle the traffic demands during its second century.\n\nIn September 2021, a two-way protected bike lane opened along the Brooklyn Bridge, repurposing one lane of vehicular traffic to accommodate the rise of cycling in NYC.\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nRehabilitation of Towers and Approach Arches\n\nDuring Contract 7, NYC DOT will improve the load carrying capacity of the arch blocks and strengthen the masonry towers while focusing on repairs of the historic brick and granite components. The contract began in September 2019 and will continue until 2023.\n\nProject Scope:\n\nStrengthen masonry towers\n\nRehabilitate arch blocks and foundations\n\nReplace brick infill walls\n\nRehabilitate basement floors\n\nRepoint and reset granite stones\n\nImprove lighting at the towers\n\nImpacts:\n\nOccasional lane closures will take place to inspect and repair bridge components\n\nThe bridge promenade will be open at all times, although portions of the walkway may be narrowed at times\n\nLimited vehicular lane and sidewalk closures\n\nConstruction Project Contact:\n\nPlease contact Anita Navalurkar, the Brooklyn Bridge Community Liaison, with questions about the Brooklyn Bridge Rehabilitation project at 347-647-0876 or brooklynbridgeoutreach@gmail.com.\n\nPrevious Contracts\n\nContract 5D (1998-2000): Brooklyn Bridge Emergency Re-Decking Contract, $37M\n\nContract 5 (2007-2009): Brooklyn Bridge Travelers Replacement, $45M\n\nContract 6 (2010-2017): Rehabilitation of Approaches and Ramp Super Structure, Painting of the Whole Bridge, $650M\n\nContract 6A (2017-2019): Rehabilitation of Stone Masonry Walls at Bridge Approaches and Ramps, Sandy Related, $18M\n\nUpcoming Contracts\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge is continuously maintained in a State of Good Repair through capital projects and routine, in-house repairs to improve its components as they withstand weather conditions and vehicular traffic."
