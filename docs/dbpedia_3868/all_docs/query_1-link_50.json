This document provides a summary of the history and culture of the Thracians from prehistoric times through Classical antiquity. It describes how the Thracians emerged as a distinct people in southeastern Europe by 1500 BC, developing skills in metalworking, particularly with gold. They were known for their martial culture and horsemanship. From the 6th century BC onward, Thracians frequently served as mercenaries in Greek armies due to their skills as light infantry and cavalry. Thracian culture gradually became influenced by neighboring Greek cities, though they retained their tribal organization. By the 5th century BC, some Thracian kings had consolidated power over large territories and interacted directly with major Greek powers",
