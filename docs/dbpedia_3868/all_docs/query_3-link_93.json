        "text": "Today, the National Archives and Records Administration released the individual census records for the 1950 Census.\n\nFor the first time, we can glimpse personal details about life in post-World War II America and the beginning of the economic, housing and demographic boom that followed.\n\nWe can also peek into the lives of some of the famous Americans born during this time and who first appeared in census records in 1950.\n\nRichard Pierce Havens was born January 21, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, which in 1950 had a population of 2,738,175. He was of Native American (Blackfoot) and British West Indies descent. He began performing in doo-wop and gospel groups before finding his niche in a combination of folk, soul and rhythm and blues music. He was the opening act of the 1969 Woodstock Festival and continued to play almost until his death April 22, 2013.\n\nRobert Norman Ross was born October 29, 1942, in Daytona Beach, Florida (population 30,167 in 1950) but was raised in nearby Orlando. After serving 20 years in the U.S. Air Force, Bob retired as a master sergeant. He studied painting and began filming his show The Joy of Painting, which ran from 1983-1994. His gentle, relaxed manner and confidence that anyone could learn to paint continues to inspire amateur artists long after his death July 4, 1995.\n\nEdward Ryon Makuahanai Aikau was born May 5, 1946, in Kahului, the then-territory of Hawaii, which had a population of 6,294 in 1950. He was a champion surfer who helped popularize the sport. He was the first lifeguard hired by the city of Honolulu and is credited with saving the lives of more than 500 swimmers on its treacherous North Shore. Aikau died when March 17, 1978, while paddling to shore on his surfboard seeking help for his crew after their voyage canoe capsized following the ancient Polynesian migration route. His willingness to battle even the most dangerous waves gave rise to the cry, “Eddie Would Go,” still the unofficial motto of surfers everywhere. The annual Eddie Big Wave Invitational celebrates big wave surfers from around the world.\n\nFlorence Glenda Ballard was born June 30, 1943, in Detroit, Michigan, which was one of the top 10 largest U.S. cities in 1950 with a population of 1,849,568 at its peak. She was a founding member of the Motown group The Supremes and sang on 10 of their number-one hits before leaving the group in 1967. Twelve years after her death February 22, 1976, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nRichard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor, Jr., was born December 1, 1940, in Peoria, Illinois (population 111,856 in 1950). He was raised in a violent, unconventional household, an experience he would later channel into his comedy when he became a stand-up comedian and actor. He rose to prominence in the 1960s and eventually moved into screenwriting and acting. He is widely considered one of the most-groundbreaking and influential stand-up comedians of all time. In 1986, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis but continued to perform until his death January 9, 2005.\n\nWilma Glodean Rudolph was born June 23, 1940, in Saint Bethlehem, an unincorporated community in the city limits of Clarksville, Tennessee, which in 1950 had a population of 16,246. Stricken with polio, Rudolph wore a leg brace until she was 12 years old. But that didn’t stop her from becoming a basketball and track star in high school. She would go on to become a premier sprinter and international celebrity after winning a bronze medal in the 1956 Olympics and three gold medals in the 1960 Olympics, becoming the first American woman to win three gold medals in a single Olympics. She was the fastest woman in the world in the 1960s and held three world records. She then became a teacher and worked in her community until her death November 12, 1994.\n\nBorn Conrado Morales November 22, 1941, In New York City, (1950 population 7,891,957). He started his career as a dancer before co-writing the hit musical A Chorus Line, which became the longest- running show on Broadway. Dante based the character of Paul on himself. He won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama, a Tony Award, and a Drama Desk Award for the popular production. The show was still playing on Broadway when Dante died May 21, 1991."
