        "text": "Broadway shows are practically synonymous with New York City, and the word Broadway is often used as shorthand for theater itself. Visiting the Great White Way means attending one of 41 large theaters concentrated in the vicinity of Times Square, most of which seat more than 1,000 people.\n\nThe most popular Broadway shows tend to be musicals, from long-running favorites like The Lion King and Hamilton to more recent hits like Hadestown and Moulin Rouge!—but new plays and revivals also represent an important part of the Broadway experience. There’s a wide variety of Broadway shows out there, as our complete A–Z listing attests.\n\nOur list of NYC’s 50 best restaurants offers a catalogue of all the places we wish we were at right now. They don’t have to be the newest or the most famous (though some are), just places that we want to return to again and again, and that we think that you will, too.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNew York City is full of free outdoor art that you don't even have to go to a museum to see. Sculptures, murals and photographs can be found in its parks, sidewalks and on its buildings! Locations such as the High Line, Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum Of Art, Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn, Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens and other NYC locales all have a wide variety of pieces awaiting you, from massive sculptures to eye-popping murals and graffiti.\n\nWe rounded up the best outdoor art you can go see right now.\n\nFor several years, anybody who has walked, run, or biked along the Hudson River trail in Hell’s Kitchen has had to squeeze past barriers and a shrouded fence. At last, the barriers are starting to come down as the park at Pier 97 progresses.\n\nThough it's not complete yet, parts of the park are now open for visitors. The Pier 97 park, located across from West 57th Street, has been a long time coming. Empty since its reconstruction in 2013, renderings were unveiled in 2019, with plans to open the park in 2022. Obviously, that didn’t happen, but signs at the site say it should fully open soon.\n\nThe park currently features a blue turf field, a shaded pergola area with benches, and loungers with skyline views.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNew York's summertime smells tend to get a bad rap: hot garbage, sweat, vape smoke and other olfactory offenses. But there's one place in the city where you can go this summer to breathe in the delightful herbal aroma of lavender.\n\nCatch a ferry to Governors Island where you'll find the NYC Lavender Field in all its purple glory. The field is free to visit and definitely worth adding to your summer in NYC bucket list.\n\nUnsurprisingly given the city's landscape, the NYC Lavender Field is the only lavender field in the city. When you visit, you'll get a chance to stroll along gravel paths through dozens of lavender bushes. More than 500 plants erupt in an ombre wave of color—royal purple, pastel gray, brilliant grape and bluish silver. Every single one is gorgeous.\n\nEnjoy another summer of fun in the sun! New York City beaches are now open for swimming and sunbathing. From the popular Jacob Riis Park Beach to The Bronx’s only public beach, we've got a detailed round-up of where to soak up the sun this summer.\n\nAdvertising\n\nSometimes you’ll feel very tall, sometimes very small, and sometimes in awe of it all at this new New York Botanical Garden exhibit that celebrates the magic of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. With a variety of botanical and artistic exhibitions throughout the Bronx garden’s 250 acres, “Wonderland: Curious Nature” encourages visitors to get “curiouser and curiouser” around every turn.\n\nSee a massive white (well, actually green) rabbit made entirely of plants; explore an enchanting English garden with delightfully weird flora; climb through a rabbit hole; hang out in a house made of mycelium bricks; and much more at this sprawling exhibition. Wonderland: Curious Nature is now open through October 27, 2024, and will evolve with each season.\n\nThough it's now more than 150 years since the first publication of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the delightful story with its heroic protagonist feels just as fresh as ever—especially at New York Botanical Garden with its enchanting scientific and artistic twist on the story.\n\nWhen Vivian Maier died in 2009 at the age of 83, a short obituary in the Chicago Tribune identified her as a \"photographer extraordinaire\" but left it at that. Her photographs had never reached the mainstream; in fact, much of her work remained undeveloped.\n\nBy chance, artist John Maloof stumbled up on a box of her negatives at an auction house and eventually realized there was something special about them. He shared the images with photographers and gallerists, and eventually Vivian Maier's work started getting the attention it deserved. At last, Maier is now considered one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century, and you can see her evidence of that in \"Unseen Work,\" an incredible new show at Fotografiska in the Flatiron District through September 29.\n\nThe Fotografiska show is the first major retrospective of Maier’s work in the U.S., and it’s packed with 230 photographs and video clips that explore the late artist’s extraordinary talent. The images range from the early 1950s to the late 1990s, documenting post-war America and the facade of the American dream.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIt’s hard to imagine anything else at the site of the iconic Rockefeller Center. But 200 years ago, long before the famed skyscraper was built, this land was home to a lush greenspace called Elgin Gardens—it was America’s first botanical garden.\n\nA new immersive art experience will now explore that beautiful history in Rockefeller Center. HERO, which opened inside Rockefeller Center late last year near the ice rink, has debuted \"BLOOM: The Secret Wonders of New York’s Forgotten Eden.\" See it now through the summer.\n\nAt the all-ages exhibit, expect to walk through eight interactive experiences that promise to engage your senses with a captivating soundscape, changing scentscapes, interactive digital components, and light and video installations.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn the resonant words of A$AP Rocky, \"The nails, the kilts, the pretty-boy swag, the pearls—I think it's just being comfortable. I just express myself with fashion, and what's fly is fly.\" What's fly is \"Ice Cold: An Exhibition of Hip-Hop Jewelry\" at the American Museum of Natural History, a new show that features dozens of incredible necklaces, rings, watches, chains, and more worn by some of the biggest names in music.\n\nA few highlights include T-Pain's Big Ass Chain necklace, Ghostface Killah's eagle arm band, Nicki Minaj's Barbie pendant, Beyoncé's nail rings, Cardi B's nipple covers, and Slick Rick's crown. While the pieces are a sight to behold up-close, the exhibit carries a much deeper meaning, especially as New York City wraps up its 50 years of hip-hop celebrations.\n\nSee the exhibit now at the American Museum of Natural History with general admission, which is pay-as-you-wish for New Yorkers. Find it in the Mignone Halls of Gems and Minerals on the first floor.\n\nThe glitz and glamour and hedonism and heartbreak of Moulin Rouge are coming to the Museum of Broadway for a special exhibit celebrating the 10-time Tony Award-winning Best Musical.\n\nThe new exhibit, created exclusively for The Museum of Broadway, invites fans to step into the glamorous underworld of Belle Époque Paris. “Moulin Rouge! The Musical: Spectacular, Spectacular” runs through September 8, 2024; it’s included with museum admission.\n\nExpect to see dazzling costumes while learning how costumers transformed sketches and swatches into eye-catching gowns and bodices fit for the Sparkling Diamond herself. You'll also see set installations—and even get a chance to sit on Satine’s luxe chaise lounge. Before you go, leave your personal mark on a heart-themed wall.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“We choose to go to the Moon,” President John F. Kennedy’s voice booms through speakers welcoming visitors to the massive new Space Race-themed exhibit at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. With archival speeches, historic documents, and incredible space equipment, the exhibit whisks visitors back to the 1960s, an era when humanity first ventured into the unknown.\n\n\"Apollo: When We Went to the Moon\" is now open at the Intrepid Museum (that's the gigantic aircraft carrier in Hell's Kitchen along the Hudson River) through September 2. At 9,000 square feet, it's the largest temporary exhibit in the museum's history. Tickets are inlcluded with museum admission.\n\nBalloon Story, a \"balloon wonderland,\" has taken over the Park Avenue Armory with a whopping 600,000 inflatables set up across different exhibit rooms. More than anything, the artistry involved in crafting monuments out of balloons will leave you amazed.\n\nOn display through August 24 (tickets are available right here), Balloon Story offers patrons interactive activations—a balloon maze, for example, and a jungle ball pit—but it's the actual recreations of iconic landmarks and figures that are the highlight of the production: you'll find yourself staring at each one wondering, how, exactly, they were built.\n\nThe show is split into sections that range in theme but not in scope: the subjects are different but they are all built using “environmentally friendly” natural rubber.\n\nAdvertising\n\nFor more than 30 years, the Tenement Museum shared stories about the people who once lived in the building it now owns. But that meant that some groups—particularly Black New Yorkers—were excluded, as there's no record of a Black family living in the apartment building at 97 Orchard Street.\n\nNow, with an aim to explore the full breadth of immigrant and migrant experiences, the Lower East Side museum is highlighting the stories of a Black family for the first time with a new tour titled \"A Union of Hope: 1869.\" The exhibition tells the story of the Moore family who lived in Soho during and after the Civil War. Reserve tickets here for $30/person.\n\nIt's been eight years since former President Barack Obama designated the Stonewall Inn and the surrounding area a national monument, making it the country's first national park to honor the LGBTQ community.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of having no official visitor center attached to it, Pride Live and the National Park Service announced that after several years of construction, Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center has finally opening its doors.\n\nThe visitor center will be located at 51 Christopher Street, which is attached to The Stonewall Inn bar and encompass 2,100 feet of space.\n\nAdvertising\n\nFrom amazing costumes to Broadway history to fun photo opps, this long-awaited new museum is a must-see for theater buffs.\n\nYou can expect the new museum to highlight over 500 individual productions from the 1700s all the way to the present.\n\nAmong the standout offerings will also be a special exhibit dubbed \"The Making of a Broadway Show,\" which honors the on- and off-stage community that helps bring plays and musicals to life multiple times a week.\n\nDigital art and poetry combine for a dive into Afrocentricity and Afrofuturism at this new immersive exhibit in Chelsea. \"Aṣẹ: Afro Frequencies\" is now open at ARTECHOUSE and runs all summer.\n\nThe digital art exhibition promises a \"vibrant reflection upon the past, present, and future of the Black experience.\" It's told through the perspective of London-based Afro-surrealist digital artist Vince Fraser alongside evocative poetry by ursula rucker.\n\nBoth artists worked to honor the legacy, struggles, and complexities of the Black experience in their work. Even the exhibition's title, \"Aṣẹ\" stems from a powerful mantra, affirmation, and philosophical belief held by the Yoruba people of West Africa, meaning \"so will it be.\" (By the way, that's pronounced as AH-shay.)\n\nAdvertising\n\nFor more than a century, the Statue of Liberty has offered inspiration as a beacon of freedom, equality, and democracy. And for just as long, she has also served as an inspiration for tattoo artists.\n\nA new exhibit at City Reliquary, a jewel box of a museum in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood, features vintage State of Liberty tattoos. As the first show devoted to Lady Liberty ink, it also traces tattooing history in NYC since the 1800s. \"Liberty the Tattooed Lady: The Great Bartholdi Statue as Depicted in Tattooing\" is now open through January 12, 2025.\n\nThe exhibition spotlights antique flash, vintage photographs, drawings, and other ephemera that show how Lady Liberty has been a popular subject in tattooing for as long as she’s stood in New York Harbor. You'll even get to see vintage tattoo art that's never been on display before.\n\nSure, New York attractions are known across the globe, but what about the lesser-known, secret NYC spots? Thanks to us, you don’t have to do much digging. This is a classified list of buzzy speakeasies in NYC. Cheers!\n\nAdvertising\n\nA grove of citrus trees growing in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District would be unusual enough. But a grove of live citrus trees growing inside a Meatpacking District museum is even more surprising.\n\nAstonishingly, 18 citrus trees are now in bloom inside the Whitney Museum of American Art, and you can walk through the grove on the museum’s eighth floor through January 1, 2025. The exhibition, “Survival Piece #5: Portable Orchard,” was conceived in 1972 by Helen Mayer Harrison and Newton Harrison. This groundbreaking eco-art project is on view at a museum for the first time since its debut more than 50 years ago.\n\nOcean noise, chemical pollution, climate change and sea level rise are words that often appear in the news. But these important concepts can be hard to make sense of—or to understand at all.\n\nThat's where artist Jenny Kendler comes in. Her new exhibit, Other of Pearl, confronts these pressing environmental issues in ways that feel more accessible with stirring whale songs, incredible pearl sculptures, a crystalline whale eye cast with human tears, and more. You can see these powerful works for free on Wednesdays-Sundays from 10am-5pm now through October on Governors Island.\n\nSeven intimate, delicate works are displayed in the cavernous, subterranean magazine of historic Fort Jay, a star-shaped fortification built on Governors Island between 1775 and 1776.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThere’s only one constant in New York City: Change. A new exhibit at the New-York Historical Society explores the rapid development of the city and what’s been left behind.\n\nThe exhibit, titled Lost New York, transports viewers to a time when pigs roamed the streets, shopping was a radical act, and New Yorkers used to brave polluted waters for a swim. The exhibition also documents long-gone landmarks like the original Penn Station, Met Opera House, Chinese Theater, and Croton Reservoir. See it at the Upper West Side museum now through September 29.\n\nTake your movie-going experience to the next level this summer at Rooftop Cinema Club. The experience offers a chance to watch a movie on a Midtown rooftop with vegan popcorn, classic theater candy, and craft cocktails.\n\nThe cinema is located high above Midtown's streets on the Skylawn rooftop of the Embassy Suites Hotel on West 37th Street where the skyline serves as an incredible backdrop. Don't worry about background noise, though: You'll get your own set of wireless headphones that block out street noise, and you can adjust the volume as needed.

On the outdoor deck, see how the perspective changes as you look through the clear glass versus the colorful panels.

The late artist Max Neuhaus's installation called \"Times Square\" sounds like the echo of a bell ringing. It's hard to place this droning tone among all the other noises there, especially because the sound emanates from a typical grate right beneath your feet.\n\nHere's the backstory — and the intel on how to find it.\n\nImagine waking up to the sound of gently swaying trees and chirping birds, sun peeking into your window which looks out across a canopy of golden leaves.

No one is more tapped into this trend than the Chop Suey Club, a Chinese-owned store in Downtown Manhattan that just opened its own mahjong room in the store’s lower level on Hester Street.\n\nThe vibey room, which includes two tables and an option to play with an instructor, seats two parties at a time, and every booking will include a copy of a mahjong for beginners pamphlet written and designed by the creative mind behind the Chop Suey Club, Ruoyi Jiang.\n\nWhether you want to play with friends or simply want to learn how to play, there’s something for you.

Sure, the famous wax museum is a tourist magnet, but New Yorkers have also come to appreciate the art form, welcoming new celebrity clay figures joining the roster of 200-or-so sculptures always on display at the museum.\n\nA mere walk through the giant space at 234 West 42nd Street by Seventh Avenue is sure to catch you off guard: the wax figures are, to put it simply, life-like, almost identical to their human counterparts.\n\nFor the first time ever, Madame Tussauds is offering museum-goers the chance to take a peek at the process: the museum is now leading behind-the-scenes tours twice a day on Mondays through Fridays."
