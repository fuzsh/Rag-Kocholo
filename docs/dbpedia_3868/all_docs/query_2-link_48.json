        "text": "New York has to be one of the most famous cities in the world. Often referred to as the â€˜Big Appleâ€™, this New York is known for its exclusive shops, flashy Broadway performances, and high-flying business tycoons, and itâ€™s a city that has long captivated people from all over the world.\n\nBut, aside from the flashing lights, itâ€™s also home to the beloved Statue of Liberty, a symbol of freedom and hope, and Central Park, one of the tidiest and best-kept parks in the world.\n\nSo, clearly, New York is more than just a place for the big shots. So, letâ€™s take a closer look at what has made New York one of the most famous cities in the world.\n\nStatue of Liberty\n\nItâ€™s hard to conjure up an image of New York City and not picture the iconic turquoise monument known around the globe as the Statue of Liberty. Constructed in 1886, the statue was a gift to America from the people of France as a symbol of friendship between the two countries.\n\nThe monument represents freedom above all else, and a broken chain lies at the feet of the muse in recognition of the abolition of slavery in the United States, and the date of the United States Declaration of Independence is engraved in the tablet held in the femaleâ€™s left hand.\n\nHer right hand is held high above her head and carries a torch, which many attribute to America having â€˜found the lightâ€™ and leaving the dark days of slavery behind. Strategically positioned to welcome immigrants as they approached the shores of America, this is probably one of the worldâ€™s most famous statues.\n\nSome boat tours simply let you ogle at the statue from the water, and these trips are the next cheapest option, but most trips let you wander around Liberty Island itself, which means that you can get up close and personal with the monument.\n\nThere are more luxurious options which range from luxury yacht tours, to romantic dinner cruises, to helicopter tours. No matter which option you go for, this really ought to be a must-see on anyoneâ€™s New York checklist.\n\nCentral Park\n\nCentral Park really is an oasis of natural beauty within the concrete jungle formally known as Manhattan, and itâ€™s loved by locals & visitors alike. It is probably the most famous park in the entire world, most likely because itâ€™s the most filmed location in the world. Trust us, if you get the chance to visit this spectacular park in person, rather than on a screen, you should definitely take it.\n\nWhether youâ€™re a nature lover, exercise enthusiast, or just into picnics, thereâ€™s something for everyone in this green haven. In fact, the park has been so successful that it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963 and a New York City scenic landmark in 1974 â€“ itâ€™s no wonder that it receives almost 40 million visitors a year.\n\nEmpire State Building\n\nThe Empire State Building opened in 1931 and has since become symbolic of New Yorkâ€™s skyline. At the time of its opening, it was the largest building in the world, and from below you canâ€™t help but feel humbled by this imposing structure â€“ in fact, itâ€™s so large it even has its own zip code.\n\nIf thatâ€™s not enough for you, you can take a trip up the building itself and visit one of its two observation platforms. One, located on the 86th floor, is open-aired, while the top deck, located on the 102nd floor, is sealed â€“ we arenâ€™t sure which is the more daring choice.\n\nThe lines can get pretty long, and although there are some queue-jump tickets available, itâ€™s totally worth the wait for the views from the top â€“ you can see all the way to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Massachusetts when the conditions are kind to you.\n\nRockefeller Center and Top of the Rock Observation Deck\n\nNo trip to New York is complete without a visit to the Rockefeller Center, one of the cityâ€™s best-known landmarks. This impressive Art Deco complex is home to various buildings, including high-end shops, fancy restaurants, and suave cocktail bars.\n\nOn top of that, â€˜The Rinkâ€™ offers a truly memorable ice skating experience right at the foot of the building â€“ admire the unique architecture of the Rockefeller Center as you twirl around a rink illuminated by fairy lights (during the winter months only).\n\nYou can even hire spaces within the center for very special occasions â€“ locations include the Rainbow Room (which even Presidents have visited), The Gallery, and a Private Dining Room.\n\nPlus, if youâ€™re really taken with the center, you can even hire it for a wedding that youâ€™ll never forget. Our favorite spot, however, has to be the Top of the Rock Observation Deck, which is spread out over the 67th, 69th, and 70th floors. The 360-degree views really are incredible, and there are various tours and tickets available (some even include a cheeky queue jump).\n\nWall Street\n\nNew York is certainly famous for Wall Street and it certainly invokes strong emotions in people from all walks of life. This 8-block-long street situated in Manhattanâ€™s Financial District is where some of the worldâ€™s most important stock exchanges occur.\n\nDuring Americaâ€™s â€˜roaring twentiesâ€™, Wall Street made many people millionaires overnight, yet it all came tumbling down when the US stock market crashed hard in 1929, leading to the infamous Great Depression.\n\nMuch of this is depicted in the fairly recent Wolf of Wall Street film, as well as various other films, that have contributed to the fame of the area over the years. Although thereâ€™s not much going on for tourists on the street itself, you canâ€™t help but think of all the highs and lows that have occurred in the area as you pass through it.\n\nFriends\n\nThis US sitcom was a huge success in the 90s, and it developed a seemingly endless fanbase as the show continued for ten seasons. Although lots of the show was actually filmed in LA, it was set in New York and featured sights such as Central Park in various episodes.\n\nThe â€˜Friends Apartmentâ€™, located at 90 Bedford Street, still receives a lot of attention, despite the show ending back in 2004.\n\nSadly, there is no Central Perk coffee shop underneath the apartment (this was actually a set in LA), but nonetheless, Friends remains one of the things that New York is best known for and youâ€™ll frequently see fans gazing up at the apartment (or hanging around its fire escape).\n\n9/11\n\nThe 9/11 tragedy of 2001 was one that shook the world. Suicidal hijackers took control of two planes and crashed them into the two towers of the World Trade Center, the tallest building in the world at the time. The incident received global attention and is now sadly rooted in the history of New York.\n\nIn honor of those who lost their lives in the incident, including the courageous souls who died trying to help others, the 9/11 Memorial and Museum has been constructed. The museum is informative and explores not only the events that happened but also the long-term effects of the attack.\n\nBroadway\n\nThe thrill of a broadway performance is never better than in New Yorkâ€™s Theater District. All the best shows can be viewed here, and itâ€™s regarded as the center of US theater.\n\nBe warned that tickets can cost a bomb, depending on which of the 40 theaters you visit, and most need to be purchased way in advance. Check out the website to see whatâ€™s on while youâ€™re there.\n\nFifth Avenue\n\nFifth Avenue, with its swathes of designer stores, is New Yorkâ€™s most famous shopping street and is often referred to as Millionaireâ€™s Row. While you donâ€™t exactly have to be a millionaire to shop there, it certainly helps, especially if you want to go on any kind of spree.\n\nBig names youâ€™ll see include Versace, D&G, Armani, Prada, and so many more. If youâ€™re strapped for cash, donâ€™t despair though, there are some standard high-street stores around too, such as H&M, Zara, and Apple.\n\nCertain magic fills the air of Fifth Avenue around Christmas time when all the stores whip out their festive displays. If you can, we definitely recommend visiting during this season. Shop tilâ€™ you drop then hit up one of the nearby coffee shops for a gingerbread latte â€“ you canâ€™t help but feel like a kid at Christmas.\n\nTimes Square\n\nWhen the headquarters of the New York Times moved to a new area in 1904, the area took on a new, now famous, name â€“ Times Square. This flashy area is packed with voracious billboards and pedestrians â€“ in fact, it receives up to 460,000 pedestrians a day. Located close to Broadway, this busy junction has been termed the â€˜Center of the Universeâ€™.\n\nIf you happen to be in New York on New Yearâ€™s Eve, head here for the ball drop â€“ a literal ball descends down the top of One Times Square to mark the new year. The streets will be even busier than usual and, combined with a backdrop of fireworks, it makes for a thriving atmosphere.\n\nBagels\n\nBagels are a staple part of New Yorkerâ€™s diets. These delicious doughy creations are thought to have made it to America through Jewish immigrants in the 19th century. Since then, tonnes of bakeries have sprouted up as the snacks have grown exponentially in popularity â€“ thereâ€™s even a National Bagel Day in the US on the 9th of February!\n\nCompetition between bagel stores is fierce, and everyone has their own personal favorite, but this list is a good place to start if youâ€™re wondering where to go to pick up a classic New York bagel.\n\nBrooklyn Bridge\n\nBrooklyn Bridge is an impressive feat of engineering and forms a link between Brooklyn and Manhattan in New York. At the time of its construction (which was completed in 1883), this suspension bridge was the first to use steel for cable wire, making it a real groundbreaker, and it has since been designated as a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThis iconic bridge can be viewed from the river, with many of the ferries passing close by. Or, alternatively, you can find some land-based spots with great views, such as Pebble Beach in Brooklyn. But if you really want to admire this bridge in its full glory, you should take a trip down the Brooklyn Bridge Pedestrian Walkway (and Bicycle Lane).\n\nAs you stroll along the wooden planks, you can appreciate how hard this bridge must have been to build back in the day, and youâ€™ll get great views of the river, Manhattan, and even the Statue of Liberty. If youâ€™re a selfie lover, take care when taking photos on the bridge, as thereâ€™s heavy traffic and cyclists and pedestrians have been known to collide from time to time!\n\nSumming Up\n\nThere you have it â€“ New Yorkâ€™s most famous features. With its bright lights, impressive buildings, and popular public spaces, itâ€™s easy to see why this city is one of the best known in the world. It offers fantastic shopping, restaurants halfway up some of the tallest restaurants in the world, and sunset cruises that let you soak up the sun and some of the worldâ€™s most iconic landmarks at the same time.\n\nAlthough these activities might set you back a bit, there are tonnes of things to do in New York City without breaking the bank â€“ stroll along Brooklyn Bridge and take in the scenery, take a picnic in Central Park and while away an afternoon, and pick yourself up one of the tastiest bagels youâ€™ll ever experience for less than five bucks."
