        "text": "Meriem Derradji couldn’t help but feel a twinge of betrayal when she discovered that one of her favorite actresses on “Euphoria” was not the self-made up-and-comer she thought her to be.\n\n“She seemed like a regular girl,” said Ms. Derradji, 24, who works in technical support in Montreal. Except for one thing: Her parents, Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow, are Hollywood stalwarts.\n\nIn other words, Maude Apatow is a “nepotism baby.”\n\nFor centuries, children born into rich, famous and otherwise powerful families have had a leg up in life, inheriting monarchies, business empires, wealth and star power. In some cases they’ve surpassed their parents’ status. This is what most parents wish for their children. It’s also often how power works, especially in Hollywood.\n\nNow, a new generation is finding out that their favorite celebrities, talented as they may be, have benefited from a system that is not strictly meritocratic.\n\nThe phrase “nepotism baby” (or the diminutive “nepo baby”) has pervaded social media in earnest expressions of surprise (“just found out…”), envy (“pls god why couldn’t i have been a nepotism baby”) and even admiration (some favorites include Ms. Apatow, Zoë Kravitz and Dakota Johnson). Others are already talking about the next generation of nepotism babies, including the unborn child of Rihanna and ASAP Rocky (“a galactic nepotism legend already,” as one person put it)."
