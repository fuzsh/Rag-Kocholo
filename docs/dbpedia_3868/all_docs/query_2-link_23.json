        "text": "Mention New York and its iconic skyline pops into most people’s minds. You may think that the only place to visit is the iconic New York City, but there are plenty of places throughout the state to enjoy. What is New York known for? The state is a mosaic of nature and best-explored multiple times to appreciate it fully. From the Statue of Liberty and Times Square to Central Park and the Empire State Building, here’s what New York is famous for.\n\nWhat Is New York Known For?\n\n1- The Statue Of Liberty\n\nSculpted by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi who wanted to encompass the power of beauty and freedom, this statue still exudes that feeling.\n\nDesigned by Gustave Eiffel, the statue was gifted to the United States by France in 1886 to mark the relationships between the two countries and the the centennial of American independence.\n\nIt was placed on what is now known as Liberty Island, and was meant for new immigrants arriving towards Ellis Island (for immigration processing).\n\nImmigrants would come from all parts of the world and this would be a symbol to remind them that they had made it, freedom and liberty were waiting for them, and more importantly they were home.\n\nIt was built back in 1886 but still holds relevance to this day.\n\nIt has been used by various activists to protest for freedom, as well as being a continued symbol to combat oppression and help refugees feel welcome.\n\nYou can take a boat ride to Liberty Island for the day to admire this copper statue and climb it for spectacular views of New York City itself.\n\nKeep in mind that you want to plan this in advance as there are a limited number of ferry tickets and times available.\n\nFor history buffs there’s a statue of liberty museum that goes into more detail about this beautiful sculpture and what it has meant to represent to people who arrived to the island from afar.\n\n2- Times Square\n\nAt the turn of the century, Times Square started to become the epicenter of Broadway theatre, as well as numerous hotels.\n\nIt is well connected by the subway transportation system, with many trains running through Times Square.\n\nAs the years went on, Times Square started to dazzle with new marketing billboards that were electric, instead of static options.\n\nThey were also replacing all the gaslit signs with neon gas and all the various colour options that came with it.\n\nEventually its popularity allowed it to get the moniker as the “Crossroads of the World” and it started becoming more than just the theatre district, but a popular destination for anyone visiting New York City.\n\nIt’s embrace of innovation led it to also becoming a popular place for movie theatres, variety shows and even music halls as well, being a true hub for the Jazz musical movement.\n\nCelebrating New Year’s Eve at Times Square is an experience to remember.\n\n3- Central Park\n\nThe origins of this nearly 850 acres of green space lies in the fact that it was meant to be a place for everyone to enjoy, regardless of their social status.\n\nCentral Park is a significant example of modern-day urban planning, and many parks are now included in a similar way in future urban planning projects as a way to bring that level of equality.\n\nThe brains behind this were architects Calvert Vaux and Frederick Olmstead.\n\nIt’s been a hotbed of activism and events, as well as a shelter for soldiers during the Civil War.\n\nIt also is quite a popular artistic spot that is featured in many movies and TV shows that tend to center around New York City in general.\n\nToday it the spot New Yorkers and visitors not only to get a reprieve from the chaos of the city but to soak up the New York vibe.\n\nRecommended tour: Central Park Pedicab Guided Tours\n\n4- Some Of The World’s Best Museums\n\nNew York is home to some of the most world-renowned museums throughout the globe and you could spend weeks, if not months, exploring all the various options.\n\nMuseums represent New York as a true conglomeration of culture, history and everything in between.\n\nThere are some museums that are there to cater to the importance of history, such as the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nYet other museums are focused on both history and art through various cultures, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThere are even areas and forums that showcase the future of art and culture, such as the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nThese are just a sample of the overall tapestry of available museums.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art is at 1000 5th Ave, New York, NY 10028, USA\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History is at 200 Central Park West, New York, NY 10024, USA\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art is at 11 W 53rd St, New York, NY 10019, USA\n\n5- The High Line\n\nThe High Line was a unique elevated train system that was specifically designed for freight trains.\n\nIt was built in the early 1930s and was elevated to prevent danger at a street-level crossing.\n\nIt was in service for nearly five decades before it was shut down in the early 1980s.\n\nYet instead of being demolished the local community pushed lobbied for something meaningful to be done with it and in 1999 it was finally approved be turned into a park.\n\nIt’s a fantastic urban oasis that provides a safe and wonderful walkway to urbanites, surrounding people by lush greenery and wildflowers.\n\nIt allows anyone using it to get away from the chaos of what’s below and has lured public art installations, exhibits and performance spaces.\n\nIt has also motivated other similar projects throughout the world, showing we can repurpose industrial areas into something for the local community.\n\nRecommended tour: High Line and Chelsea Small Group Tour\n\n6- The Empire State Building\n\nAt 102 stories tall, this building is the personification of resilience and innovation at a time where it was needed the most.\n\nIt’s a physical reminder showcasing what can happen with the dedication of the human spirit.\n\nIt was designed in an Art Deco style and was completed in one year and 45 days, which itself was a record.\n\nIt came in under budget and ahead of schedule as well.\n\nThe lobby itself is also in an Art Deco style and is dazzling to those who venture inside it.\n\nAt the time of its construction it was the tallest building in the world and held on to that record until the world trade center was built.\n\nIt was meant to be a stopping point for airships when they were in vogue, and is an iconic image for films and shows based in New York City.\n\nOf course none are more famous than when King Kong himself took to the skyscraper for his final scenes.\n\nThe Empire State Building is at 20 W 34th St., New York, NY 10001, USA. Skip the lines and book your tickets here.\n\n7- Long Island\n\nEast of New York City, away from the Urban Sprawl, is Long Island, a section that couldn’t be more different than the city itself.\n\nLong Island was farmland that the rich and famous turned into their luxury playground.\n\nWhile there are still some places that are still simple suburbs, there are other parts that are constantly featured as some of the wealthiest places on earth.\n\nIt is home to numerous world class vineyards, as well as sandy long beaches, and has been an escape for those living in New York, as the summer would approach.\n\nThose who could afford it would spend the entire summers there.\n\nNone are more famous than The Hamptons, which are at the eastern most part of the island and home to mansions and lavish estates.\n\nIt’s also been inspiration to numerous books and shows, including The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nRecommended tour: New York in One Day Guided Sightseeing Tour\n\n8- The Cloisters\n\nHead back in time in this Medieval setup that’s overlooking the Hudson River and where you won’t hear any honking noise, or really, much of any kind of noise in this area.\n\nThat’s one of the main reasons its such a popular destination for both locals and tourists alike.\n\nThe Cloisters is a blend of five monasteries that have been reconstructed and reconnected to create this unique village-like experience.\n\nIt’s the perfect blend of peacefulness and history, making it a must see place on your visit to the area.\n\nThere’s manuscripts in gold, as well as some wonderful pieces crafted by master goldsmiths from the past.\n\nThere’s also a slew of murals that are beyond ancient that are right next to tapestries that weave history through them.\n\nIt was commissioned by John D.
