Unfortunately, none of them are easily accessible in Kindle/electronic formats.\n\nAuthor Page/Biblio:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Lionel Casson/e/B000APFZ28/\n\nAs to question about ancient ships, what part of 'antiquity' are you looking for info? Bodrum wreck you allude to in your post is good thousand years before triremes. Things changed a lot between Late Bronze Age and then, to say nothing of Roman Empire times half a millennia after the triremes 'epoch.'\n\nI'm not really found on a specific period, but more on ships that were used for wine and olive oil transportation. I could only find reference to Olkas/Olkades used by the Greeks, and Rabelos used in Portugal.\n\nNot really interested in warships, but really merchant ships."
