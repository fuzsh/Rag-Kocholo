        "text": "01 of 21\n\nNew York-Style Pizza\n\nYou can't think of New York food without one thing coming to mind: pizza! The first pizzeria in the country, Lombardi's, was opened in Manhattan's Little Italy in 1905. It's been a Big Apple staple ever since.\n\nNew York-style pizza, a culinary contribution from Italian immigrants, is a variation of Neapolitan-style pizza. It's famous for its thin, hand-tossed crust that's topped with a thin layer of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Since it's thin and pliable, New York pizza is often sold in large slices that can be easily folded.\n\nSome people believe that the crust gets its signature texture and flavor from minerals found in NYC's tap water.\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nNew York-Style Pizza\n\nNew York Italian Pizza Dough\n\nBrick Oven Pizza (Brooklyn-Style)\n\n10 Recipes for Wow-Worthy Pizza at Home\n\n02 of 21\n\nGrandma Pizza\n\nGrandma pizza can be traced back to Italian-American grandmothers living in Long Island in the 1970s.\n\nThe Sicilian-style pie is has a thin crust and it's cooked in a square pan. It's cooked in a rectangular pan coated with olive oil, topped with mozzarella cheese, and finished with a layer of tomato sauce.\n\nSince it was created by home cooks, Grandma pizza is traditionally made without a pizza oven. It's cut into square pieces for serving.\n\nLearn more: What Is Grandma Pizza and Where Does It Get Its Name?\n\nTry this recipe: Grandma Pizza\n\n03 of 21\n\nBuffalo Wings\n\nThere are several unverified origin stories for Buffalo wings, but most can be traced back to the Bellissimo family at Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe chicken wings — which can be fried, baked, or grilled — are usually separated into drums and flats. The flapper (or pointer) is often discarded, but sometimes it's left attached to the flat.\n\nTraditional Buffalo wings are tossed in a buttery, cayenne pepper-based sauce that ranges in spiciness from mild to hot. They're often served with celery and blue cheese or ranch dressing, as these additions provide a cooling effect.\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nRestaurant-Style Buffalo Wings\n\nBaked Buffalo Wings\n\nGrilled Buffalo Wings\n\n16 Spicy Wing Recipes You Won't Be Able to Resist\n\n04 of 21\n\nNew York-Style Cheesecake\n\nThere's nothing more rich, decadent, or intensely satisfying than a slice of New York cheesecake. What sets this style apart? In NYC, heavy cream or sour cream is added to the filling to create a denser and smoother texture.\n\nNew York-style cheesecake usually features a graham cracker crust and is baked in a springform pan.\n\nFor a bit of extra oomph, top the elegant dessert with fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nChantal's New York Cheesecake\n\nClassic New York-Style Cheesecake\n\nNew York-Style Cheesecake\n\nOur 20 Best Cheesecake Recipes of All Time\n\n05 of 21\n\nPretzels\n\nOne of the many things that makes New York City great? The delicious street food on every corner.\n\nSoft-baked pretzels made their way to New Amsterdam (a settlement on the Southern tip of Manhattan Island) via Dutch immigrants in the early 1800s. The salty snack has been a street food staple ever since.\n\nIt's easier than you think to make the knotted, savory snack at home. Top them with sea salt and serve with mustard for an authentic New York experience.\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nButtery Soft Pretzels\n\nSoft Homemade Pretzels\n\nSoft Pretzels With Queso Dip\n\n06 of 21\n\nLobster Rolls\n\nLobster rolls, lobster meat served on a grilled hot dog-style bun, is a Northeastern staple. Lobster fishing is common on Long Island, so it makes perfect sense that the satisfying sandwiches are frequently found on Long Islander restaurant menus.\n\nSave money by making authentic lobster rolls in the comfort of your own home! Pair the satisfying sandwiches with homemade potato chips or French fries.\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nLobster Rolls\n\nPoor Man's New England Lobster Rolls\n\nEast Coast-Inspired Lobster Rolls\n\n07 of 21\n\nManhattan Clam Chowder\n\nManhattan clam chowder is tomato-based and contains no milk or cream, which sets it apart from its white New England counterpart.\n\nAlso unlike other versions, Manhattan clam chowder usually contains vegetables and starts with a mirepoix (an aromatic cooking base of carrots, celery, and onions).\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nManhattan-Style Clam Chowder\n\nQuick Manhattan Clam Chowder\n\nZesty Manhattan Clam Chowder\n\n08 of 21\n\nBlack and White Cookies\n\nBlack and white cookies have a soft, fluffy, cake-like base that's flat or slightly domed at the top. Descended from half moon cookies, another popular New York treat, black and whites are topped with royal icing or fondant in contrasting flavors (usually vanilla and chocolate).\n\nFood historians trace the cookie's history to a Bavarian bakery in Manhattan in 1902. By the 1940s, it had become extremely popular in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods in NYC.\n\nTry this recipe: Black and White Cookies\n\n09 of 21\n\nPastrami On Rye\n\nPastrami on rye, one of the most popular sandwiches of all time, was actually born from a favor for a friend: Lithuanian immigrant Sussman Volk allowed his friend, a Romanian immigrant, to use the icebox in his butcher shop in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. In exchange, the Romanian immigrant gave Volk his recipe for pastrami.\n\nWhen Volk opened one of the first delicatessens in New York City in 1888, he served the meat on rye bread. The sandwich, sometimes called \"New York's signature sandwich,\" remains a staple in Jewish delis today. It's usually topped with spicy brown mustard and served with a pickle on the side.\n\nTry this recipe: Easy Homemade Pastrami\n\n21 Classic Deli Sandwiches You Can Make at Home\n\n10 of 21\n\nChicken Riggies\n\nChicken riggies — a hearty pasta dish of rigatoni and hot cherry peppers cooked in a creamy tomato sauce — is an Italian menu staple in the Utica-Rome region of upstate New York.\n\nThe exact origins of chicken riggies are unclear (and hotly disputed among restauranteurs in the area), but we know two things for certain: The spicy dish started popping up on menus in the late '70s or early '80s and it remains a local tradition today.\n\nTry this recipe: Chicken Riggies\n\n11 of 21\n\nBagels With Lox\n\nSeparately, bagels and lox are not New York creations. Lox originated in 19th-century Scandinavia and bagels date back to 17th-century Poland. It was in New York, however, that people started pairing the two ingredients with cream cheese (or schmear).\n\nJewish bakeries developed the combination as a reaction to the popularity of eggs Benedict. The open-faced breakfast sandwich isn't kosher, as it contains pork and it mixes meat and dairy.\n\nBagels and lox was (and is!) a deliciously satisfying substitute.\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nHomemade Lox\n\nBoiled Bagels\n\n12 of 21\n\nEggs Benedict\n\nThough it sounds like a French dish, eggs Benedict (two halves of an English muffin topped with Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and Hollandaise) is a New York creation through and through.\n\nAccording to legend, eggs Benedict was invented in the 1890s when retired Wall Street stock broker Lemuel Benedict wandered into the Waldorf Hotel in search of a hangover cure. He ordered \"buttered toast, poached eggs, crisp bacon, and a hooker of Hollandaise.\" The chef liked the concoction so much, he put it on the menu. Delmonico's in Manhattan also claims ownership eggs Benedict — Charles Ranhofer, a Delmonico's chef, published a recipe for \"Eggs à la Benedick\" in 1894.\n\nGet the recipes:\n\nEggs Benedict\n\nHoneymoon Eggs Benedict\n\nQuick and Easy Eggs Benedict\n\nOur 12 Best Takes on Eggs Benedict\n\n13 of 21\n\nLobster Newberg\n\nLobster Newberg (or Newburgh or Newburg) is comprised of lobster, butter, cognac, cream, sherry, eggs, and a hint of cayenne pepper. It's yet another legendary dish that was conceived at Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City.\n\nThere was allegedly a squabble about exactly who created the seafood-based recipe (originally called Lobster à la Wenberg), which caused Charles Delmonico to remove it from the menu. The dish was so popular, though, customers continued to request it. When it returned to the menu, the dish was called Lobster à la Newberg (an anagram of its original name).\n\nTry this recipe: Lobster Newberg\n\n14 of 21\n\nGeneral Tso's Chicken\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that General Tso's chicken (a deep-fried dish that's frequently found on Chinese menus in the U.S.) wasn't actually born in China. In fact, the sweet and spicy chicken was invented in the good ol' U.S. of A.\n\nA chef named Peng Chang-kuei, who opened one of the first Hunanese restaurants in the country, actually created it in the '50s in New York City. He sweetened a traditional Hunanese dish up a bit for the American palate and named it after a respected Chinese statesman and military leader of the late Qing dynasty.\n\nFun fact: Henry Kissinger was a regular customer at Chang-kuei's restaurant, Uncle Peng's Hunan Yuan.\n\nTry this recipe: General Tso's Chicken\n\n15 of 21\n\nGarbage Plate\n\nGarbage Plate, which Health.com named \"the fattiest food in the state of New York,\" is a delicious meal with a not-so-tasty title.\n\nThe dish originated at a restaurant called Nick Tahou Hots in Rochester. So what does it entail? A bed home fries, baked beans, and macaroni and cheese is topped with hot dogs, meat sauce, chopped onions, spicy mustard, ketchup, and hot sauce.\n\nTry this recipe: Garbage Plate Sauce\n\n16 of 21\n\nBeef on Weck\n\nBeef on weck, a German-American sandwich with Buffalo roots, consists of thin-sliced rare roast beef on a kummelweck roll (which is like a kaiser roll topped with kosher salt and caraway seeds) served with au jus and horseradish.\n\nThe dish was invented sometime in mid-1800s New York. Legend has it that an upstate restauranteur promoted the salty sandwich in an attempt to encourage his customers to purchase more drinks.\n\nTry this recipe: Chef John's Beef on Weck Sandwiches\n\n17 of 21\n\nManhattan Cocktail\n\nThe Manhattan cocktail's origins can be traced back to New York City during the Gilded Age. It's made with whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters. The concoction is stirred, strained into a cocktail glass, and garnished with a maraschino cherry and sometimes a lemon twist.\n\nThough the Manhattan is traditionally made with American rye whiskey, Canadian whisky became a popular alternative during Prohibition.\n\nTry this recipe: Manhattan Cocktail\n\n18 of 21\n\nThousand Island Dressing\n\nThe Thousand Islands region, located along the St. Lawrence River on the Canada-U.S. border in upstate New York, is home to one of the most popular salad dressings in the country.\n\nThousand Island dressing is a mayonnaise-based concoction that can contain olive oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, cream, paprika, vinegar, chili sauce, ketchup, and/or hot sauce.\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nAuthentic Thousand Island Dressing\n\nQuick Thousand Island Dressing\n\nBaba's Thousand Island Dressing\n\n19 of 21\n\nUtica Greens\n\nUtica greens — sautéed escarole, hot peppers, chicken stock, cheese, breadcrumbs, and prosciutto — first appeared on Chesterfield Restaurant's menu in the late '80s. The Utica-born appetizer enjoys widespread popularity, from coast to coast, these days.\n\nThe Italian-American dish is traditionally served before meals, but it can be made hearty enough to work as an entree.\n\nTry this recipe: Utica Greens and Beans\n\n20 of 21\n\nWaldorf Salad\n\nYou probably won't be surprised to learn that the Waldorf salad is named for the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in NYC. The fruit and nut dish (comprised of mayo-bound apples, grapes, walnuts, and celery served on a bed of lettuce) can be served as an appetizer or as a light meal.\n\nThe Waldorf salad is one of many famous dishes created by Chef Oscar Tschirky in the 1890s. The original recipe called for just fruit and mayonnaise, but the walnuts add welcome crunch.\n\nTry these recipes:\n\nChef John's Waldorf Salad\n\nSimple Waldorf Salad\n\nAutumn Waldorf Salad"
