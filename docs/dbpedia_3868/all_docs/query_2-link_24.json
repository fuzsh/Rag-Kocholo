        "text": "Last Updated on 16th March 2024\n\nThis post about what is New York known for contains affiliate links.\n\nWith a population of almost 9 million people, New York City is one of the most famous cities in the world.\n\nIt’s also the largest city in New York state and it’s home to notable skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building, One World Trade and the Rockefeller Center, plus other iconic landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty, Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nNYC is also a hub for famous people, with many of the world’s most famous celebrities either being born or currently living in one of the boroughs of New York City.\n\nKnown as “The City That Never Sleeps”, “The Big Apple” and “The Melting Pot”, New York has many affectionate nicknames for those who adore the city and those who desire to visit one of the greatest cities in the world.\n\nIn the post below, I’ve put together a list of 40 things that New York is known for worldwide and the things that make it one of the most famous cities on Earth!\n\nTop tours, sights and attractions in NYC\n\nSummit One Vanderbilt Observation Deck\n\nStatue of Liberty and Ellis Island Cruise\n\nEdge Observation Deck\n\nManhattan Island Helicopter Tour\n\n9/11 Memorial and Museum Tour\n\nTop of the Rock Observation Deck\n\nBig Bus Hop-On Hop-Off Tour\n\nBroadway Show\n\nEmpire State Building Observation Deck\n\nOne World Observatory\n\nRead more: NYC Pass Comparison – Which New York City Pass Is Best?\n\nWhat is New York known for?\n\nNYC is known for the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, the classic NY slice of pizza, the New York bagel, an epic city skyline, and an electric atmosphere and endless vibrant energy!\n\nHere are 40 more things that New York is famous and known for!\n\n1. The Empire State Building – what is New York City known for?\n\nArguably one of the most famous buildings in the world, the Empire State Building is a true icon in New York City.\n\nSitting proudly in the heart of Manhattan, the building also gives NYC one of its nicknames, “the Empire State”.\n\nAt a whopping 1,454ft (443.2 m) tall, it was once the tallest building in the world, and even though it’s no longer even the tallest building in New York, the Empire State is still a beacon for the city. Home to two observation decks, one on the 86th floor and one on the 102nd floor, the Empire State Building offers spectacular sweeping views of Manhattan and beyond.\n\nRead more: 111 Best Things To Do In New York City – Ultimate NYC Travel Guide\n\n2. The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree\n\nAnother iconic landmark for the city of New York, the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree has been a symbol of the holidays for more than eight decades.\n\nLocated outside the Rockefeller Center building, the tree is known to have reached towering heights of 100ft tall over the years, and it’s always decorated with hundreds of thousands of lights. In previous years it’s also boasted a giant Swarovski Star, complete with 3 million Swarovski crystals across 70 triangular spikes.\n\nUnderneath the Christmas Tree, you’ll find the Rockefeller Center ice skating rink that’s known to be one of the most romantic locations in New York during the festive season.\n\nA visit to the Rockefeller Center should also include a visit to the Top of the Rock observation deck. From its central location in midtown Manhattan, it offers 360° views across the city, with an exceptionally excellent vantage point of the Empire State Building to one side and Central Park to the other.\n\nRead more: Where To Find The Best Christmas Trees In NYC\n\n3. Pizza\n\nNYC is famous for many types of food, with a classic New York slice of pizza being one of the city’s most iconic things you can eat.\n\nWhile it’s not quite as authentic as Italian pizza, the New York slice is famous all over the world and in pizza joints such as Joe’s and Bleecker Street, you can get a slice for as little as $2.\n\nCheck out my list of the best pizza slices in New York City (Manhattan)\n\n4. Statue of Liberty – what is New York know for?\n\nGifted by France to America in 1886, the Statue of Liberty is one of the most famous landmarks in New York and in the whole of the USA in general.\n\nRenowned for being an emblem of hope and prosperity, the Statue of Liberty also symbolises freedom and democracy for those who immigrated to the United States via Ellis Island between 1886 and 1924.\n\nYou can take a tour around Liberty Island and the Statue itself and it’s also worth visiting Ellis Island to learn more about the immigration movement in the early 1900s. Alternatively, you can enjoy breathtaking views of the Statue of Liberty, the New Jersey skyline and the whole of Lower Manhattan via the free Staten Island ferry.\n\nRead more: 10 Best Ways To See The Statue Of Liberty\n\n5. Central Park\n\nPerhaps one of the most famous parks in the world, Manhattan’s Central Park is an urban oasis right in the heart of the city.\n\nKnown for its beautiful lake, The Mall, Strawberry Fields, Bow Bridge, Loeb Boathouse and more, Central Park is a haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city that is beloved by locals and tourists from all over the world.\n\nRead more: 22 Best Photo Spots In Central Park\n\n6. Times Square\n\nYou’re not likely to find a more touristy attraction in New York City, but Times Square is one of NYC’s most famous spots for a reason. Here you’ll find giant billboards with constantly illuminated screens, ticket sellers for various Broadway shows, the New Year’s Eve ball drop and people dressed up as well-known characters all trying to make money.\n\nIt’s a hectic place that’s either loved or hated by tourists, but its eclectic atmosphere makes it one of the most renowned places in NY.\n\nRead more: 7 Days In New York Itinerary – Ultimate 7-Day NYC Itinerary\n\n7. Bagels – what is New York famous for?\n\nAnother one of New York’s best-known foods is the iconic NY bagel. These scrumptious doughy treats are a staple of many New Yorkers’ diets and they’re thought to have been introduced to America by Jewish immigrants over 100 years ago.\n\nYou’ll find hundreds of bagel specialists throughout the city, with some of the most famous bagel stores being Tompkin’s Square Bagels, Russ & Daughters, Absolute Bagels and Ess-a-Bagel.\n\n8. Grand Central Terminal\n\nGrand Central Terminal is not only famous in New York, it’s known all over the world thanks to its grand facade, even more elegant interior and the fact that over 250,000 passengers commute through its halls every single day.\n\nThe original Grand Central Depot was first built in 1871 but the station that we all know and love today officially opened to the public in 1913. Grand Central Terminal has withstood a lot of difficulty over the years and it was very nearly demolished in 1968 to make way for a proposed 55-storey tower above it, but it was saved by Jackie Kennedy Onassis in 1978 when it was declared a national historic landmark.\n\nRead more: 7 Best Ways To Get To Manhattan From JFK Airport\n\n9. The Brooklyn Bridge\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883 and at the time of its inception, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world.\n\nToday, it’s one of the most famous landmarks in New York City and has been a “side character” in many hit movies and TV shows over the years. Walking the full length of the bridge will take between 20 minutes and one hour, depending on how many times you stop to admire the surrounding skyline views of both Manhattan and Brooklyn.\n\nRead more: NYC In A Day – One Day In New York Itinerary For First-Time Visitors\n\n10. Fifth Avenue\n\nFifth Avenue is one of NYC’s most famous shopping districts, especially between the Rockefeller Center on East 50th Street and 59th Street on the corner of Central Park, but it actually runs all the way from Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, all the way along Central Park to Marcus Garvey Park on East 120th Street in Harlem.\n\nIt’s famous for playing host to huge department stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and boasts the Empire State Building address, the Guggenheim Museum and The Plaza Hotel.\n\nDuring the holidays, many of the stores along Fifth Avenue decorate their window displays in the most beautiful and lavish festive decorations and Saks Fifth Avenue’s Holiday Light Show is one of the best things to see at Christmas in NYC.\n\nRead more: Where To Stay In NYC For First-Timers\n\n11. Pastrami – what is New York known for?\n\nPastrami on rye is one of the most famous foods in NYC and is a New York deli classic that can be found in many diners all over the city.\n\nKatz’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side is arguably the most famous joint in New York City, renowned for its iconic (and enormous) pastrami sandwich. The sandwich will set you back approximately $25, so it’s not exactly a cheap grab-and-go snack in the city, but Katz’s has been operating at their iconic institution since 1888 and claim to be New York’s oldest deli.\n\nI personally didn’t enjoy the dining experience at Katz’s as their infamous “no frills service” didn’t sit too well with me, but it’s hard to deny that the pastrami sandwich is anything short of delicious, so if you don’t mind grouchy service and sky-high prices, add it to your list of places to eat in NYC.\n\nRead more: 50+ Best Places To Eat In New York City – Ultimate NYC Food And Drink Guide\n\n12. The Subway\n\nNew York’s subway system opened to the public in 1904, and today, more than 4.5 million passengers ride the 36 lines across its 472 stations daily.\n\nThe NYC subway isn’t synonymous with cleanliness or sophistication, but it is known for its efficiency and very few New Yorkers could live without it. A single subway ride costs just $2.75 so aside from walking, it’s one of the cheapest ways to get around the city.\n\n13. Broadway – what is NYC famous for?\n\nBroadway technically runs all the way from the intersection of Bowling Green at the very bottom of Manhattan all the way into Yonkers, but the main part of Broadway that’s famous in New York runs from Union Square to Columbus Circle.\n\nThe Broadway that you’ll have likely heard of and the one that makes New York’s theatre district so famous is the one that houses many of the city’s live performances and theatrical shows. Running through Times Square, there are dozens of theatres both on and off Broadway that showcase the best shows in New York.\n\nSome of the most popular Broadway shows in New York include The Lion King, Wicked, The Phantom of the Opera, Chicago and Les Misérables.\n\n14. 9/11\n\nThe tragedy of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 not only deeply affected the city and residents of New York, but the entire world as a whole and today the One World Trade Center, also known as the Freedom Tower, stands as a symbol of hope and unity adjacent to where the Twin Towers once stood.\n\nThe National September 11 Memorial & Museum is also one of the city’s most visited attractions and it depicts the story of those tragic events over 20 years ago. No visit to New York is complete without paying your respects in the memorial pools where the foundations of the Twin Towers once stood, and if you want to learn more about that fateful day, the museum is also a must-visit.\n\nRead more: 4 Days In New York Itinerary – How To See NYC In 4 Days\n\n15. Hot dogs\n\nNew York might not seem as synonymous with street food as the likes of Bangkok or Istanbul, for example, but there’s much more street food in NY than you’d expect and the famous hot dog stand is just one of the best street food vendors in the city.\n\nNathan’s Famous Hotdogs are one of the most notable hot dog vendors in New York, dating all the way back to 1916 and featuring as an institution on Coney Island where you could buy a hot dog for just a nickel at their inception.\n\nNowadays, there are hundreds of vendors all over the city claiming to offer the best hot dog in New York, but you’ll just have to try them all to decide which one should take the official number one spot!\n\n16. Friends – what is New York known for?\n\nI remember finding out as a teenager that Friends was never actually filmed in New York City at all, and instead, it was all filmed and produced in a studio in Hollywood.\n\nHowever, this world-renowned TV show is notably set in the city of New York and while none of the cast likely ever stepped foot in NYC to actually film an episode (though they will have most definitely visited the city since!), it’s hard to deny the many references to New York featured throughout the 10 seasons.\n\nThe exterior shot of Monica’s apartment can be found in Greenwich Village at the intersection of Bedford Street and Grove Street, but that’s about the extent of real-life filming locations in the city.\n\n17. Yellow taxis\n\nThe New York subway is the locals’ favourite way to get around the city, but the infamous yellow taxi cabs are also an incredibly notable mode of transport in NYC.\n\nOn every street you go down in New York, you’ll likely see at least one yellow taxi and while hailing a cab might not be as dramatic as it’s portrayed to be in the movies, it’s still a popular way of getting around the city.\n\n18. Wall Street\n\nWall Street is a symbol of the financial wealth and prosperity of the city of New York. Home to the New York Stock Exchange, the statue of the “Fearless Girl” and the Charging Bull statue, Wall Street and the Financial District as a whole is one of the most important areas of Manhattan.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, Wall Street created overnight millionaires, yet it all came crashing down again after the 1929 Wall Street Crash. Today, Wall Street doesn’t hold quite as much significance to the world’s stock market as it once did, but it’s still one of the things that NY is most known for.\n\n19. Seinfeld – what is New York City known for?\n\nSimilarly to Friends, the hit ’90s TV show created by and starring Jerry Seinfeld was also never filmed in New York City, yet it remains one of the city’s most iconic shows of all time.\n\nThe exterior shot of Jerry’s apartment and Monk’s Cafe (actually Tom’s Restaurant in real life) were both filmed in New York, but apart from that, most scenes throughout the show were filmed in studios in Los Angeles.\n\n20. Macy’s Parade\n\nThe annual Thanksgiving Day Macy’s Parade has been an integral part of the yearly celebrations since 1924 and every year, dozens of elaborate giant floats, enormous balloons and various other sources of entertainment take to the street on Thanksgiving to put on a show for the whole of North America.\n\nMacy’s itself is somewhat of a shopping institution in New York City, but its annual parade makes it famous all over the world for its over-the-top, eccentric celebrations.\n\n21. Basketball (MSG)\n\nMadison Square Garden is one of the most well-known arenas in the world, famous for hosting many sporting events, remarkable concerts and all kinds of theatre, comedy and art shows.\n\nHome to the New York Knicks basketball team and The Rangers ice hockey team, “The Garden” as it’s affectionately referred to, is one of the most sought-after arenas and venues in the world.\n\nTickets to watch the Knicks play can cost upwards of $200 and sometimes as much as $1000 for amazing seats and even at these prices, they usually sell out in record time.\n\nIf you want to watch a game at MSG but can’t bear to pay those astronomical prices, you can watch a college basketball game for as little as $20.\n\n22. New York Cheesecake – what is New York famous for?\n\nNew York cheesecake is much heavier and richer than traditional cheesecakes, as it’s made with a much higher ratio of cream cheese, giving it that iconic rich and luxurious taste.\n\nYou’ll find individual slices of cheesecake being sold in bakeries and delicatessens all over the city, as well as whole cheesecakes available to buy, sometimes for upwards of $50!\n\n23. The Met\n\nNew York is home to many famous museums, including The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the American Museum of Natural History, but The Metropolitan Museum of Art is arguably one of the most iconic and classic museums in the city.\n\nIts exterior also gained popularity in the hit TV show Gossip Girl after several of the show’s protagonists used the Met Steps as their daily meeting point.\n\nInside, the museum plays host to many exhibitions and collections, including African Art, Egyptian Art, Greek and Roman Art and so much more.\n\nRead more: Best Museums In New York City\n\n24. Sex and the City\n\nAnother famous TV show that was not only based in NYC but actually filmed there too! Sex and the City is one of New York’s most iconic shows from the late nineties to the early noughties and gave the city its reputation for love, sex, dating and relationships.\n\nYou can spy the exterior of Carrie’s apartment on Perry Street in Greenwich Village, as well as places such as Bryant Park, Magnolia Bakery and Columbus Circle (to name a few) where several famous scenes were filmed throughout the series.\n\n25. The Big Apple – what is New York known for?\n\nNew York has many nicknames, including “The Big Apple” which actually has nothing to do with the sweet fruit at all.\n\nThis nickname originates from the 1920s when a sports writer named John Fitz Gerald started writing a column about horse racing and he coined the term after hearing visitors to the city calling it “The Big Apple” in reference to the substantial prizes that could be won at the tracks.\n\nDespite first being used to describe the city in the 1920s, the term wasn’t widely used until the 1970s, yet today it’s one of the most affectionate ways to describe the world-famous city.\n\n26. The City That Never Sleeps\n\nAs well as “The Big Apple”, New York is also often referred to as “The City That Never Sleeps”. While this was once a joke nickname given to the city due to its seemingly neverending noise and chaos, a study by a UK mattress site revealed that NYC is one of the most sleep-deprived cities in the world, with the average New Yorker getting only six hours of shut-eye a night.\n\nDespite this somewhat depressing fact, this nickname shows just how busy NYC really is and whether you love it or hate it, you can’t deny that New York City is one of the most iconic and famous cities in the world.\n\nRead more: 40 Best Things To Do In NYC At Night\n\n27. Niagara Falls\n\nWhile New York City isn’t exactly known for Niagara Falls, the state of New York is as it’s situated on the border between the USA and Canada. Bridal Veil Falls and The American Falls are within the state borders of New York/US, whereas Horseshoe Falls are on the Canadian side.\n\nBonus things NY is known and famous for\n\nThe New York Mets\n\nRadio City Music Hall\n\nThe New York Public Library\n\nThe New York Times\n\nUnited Nations Headquarters\n\nFamous people from New York – what is NYC known for?\n\nAs well as all the famous skyscrapers, iconic landmarks and renowned food, here are some of the most famous people from NYC!\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJerry Seinfeld\n\nScarlett Johansson\n\n50 Cent\n\nRobert Downey Jr\n\nAdam Sandler\n\nAnne Hathaway\n\nRobert De Niro\n\nJay Z\n\nFranklin Roosevelt\n\nRelated posts:\n\n111 Best Things To Do In New York City – Ultimate NYC Travel Guide\n\n25 Best Totally Free Things To Do In New York City\n\n40+ Best Things To Do At Christmas In NYC\n\n50+ Best Places To Eat In New York City\n\n25 Best Winter Date Ideas In NYC\n\nOne Month In New York – Cost Of Living In NYC For A Month\n\n10 Best Holiday Christmas Markets In NYC\n\nPin for later – what is New York known for?"
