        "text": "Once upon a time Agatha Christie said, \"It is ridiculous to set a detective story in New York City. New York City is itself a detective story.\" That said, we're here to tell you where you should be dining, drinking and, yes, even sleeping in the city that never does.\n\nSure NYC has a plethora of tourist hotspots, from Times Square and Central Park to the Statue Of Liberty and Empire State Building, but there's a hell of a lot more to it than that. From quirky diners in Brooklyn and Michelin-star restaurants in Grand Central Station, New York is a place well worth exploring.\n\nWith that in mind, we're here to show you where the GQ team go when in the Big Apple. And when we say the city never sleeps, we mean it – it's just as lively at 3am as it is at 9am when Saks launches its winter sale.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nScarpetta\n\nNew York may be rammed with upscale Italian restaurants, but few are as fantastic as Scarpetta, a stalwart of the scene that relocated to its current Nomad site a couple of years back, with a great underground bar – The Seville – ideal for after-dinner drinks (plus a new outpost in London by the name of Sette). The vibe, for one, is wonderfully fun, with large, chatty groups that pile into the sleek leather banquettes to worship at the altar of handmade pasta. It’s pasta, after all, that this place is really about. Think delicate duck and foie gras ravioli; golden tagliolini twirls piled high with lobster; unctuous braised oxtail with cavatelli – a dainty little shell shape designed to soak up the meaty juices – and ricotta. It’s all stunning, however sometimes simplicity is best. Scarpetta’s spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce is famous and for thoroughly good reason: few things in life are as enjoyable as a comforting, familiar dish, executed to exquisite perfection. If you choose to navigate the menu in the proper Italian way – and trust us, you should – then pasta is followed by meat and fish, promising delicacies from black cod to wagyu strip. Opt for the velvet-soft veal tenderloin served with gnocchi (because there’s no such thing as too much pasta) or the halibut with baby fennel. Finally, if you can bare it, do try and squeeze in the Espresso Budino instead of your usual coffee. It comes with salted caramel, hazelnut gelato and chocolate biscotti. Need we say more? scarpettarestaurants.com\n\nFouquet's\n\nLocated at the Hotel Barrière Fouquet's New York, Fouquet's is the place to head to in the city. It's based in the trendy Tribeca, and the restaurant has the same red-and-black colour palette, the same elegant and cosy atmosphere as its famous namesake on the Champs Élysées, where the people of Paris who know what’s good have been dining since 1899. There's a terrace, where you can dine Parisian style, or the luxurious main dining room that'll have you feeling like you're in the fifth arrondissement.\n\nThe quintessential Parisian brasserie is overseen by Chef Pierre Gagnaire and inside you'll be treated to the very best endive salad, escargots, Dover Sole meunière, lobster fricassée and, of course, French onion soup.\n\nhotelsbarriere.com\n\nCafe Clover\n\nAs a health-focussed hotspot in the heart of the West Village, Cafe Clover is peak “New York”, serving up on-trend American dishes made from locally sourced organic ingredients to millennial Manhattanites. For the more evangelical eater, there’s a host of plant-based goodness (the golden coconut broth is, genuinely, an elixir of life, particularly if you’ve been enjoying West Village’s buzzing bar scene the night before), but ethically raised meat and wild-sourced fish feature heavily on the menu too. Packed into a sesame bun and loaded with spicy aioli, mature cheddar and deliciously crispy onions, the burger, it must be said, is really very good. As is the pasta with lamb ragu. Oh, and the seed-crusted salmon, which GQ suggests you wash down with an Illegal Spice cocktail, made from joven mezcal, ancho verde, jalapeño and lime (or, for the teetotal, a kombucha). Then there’s the desserts: make like a real American and order the s’mores. The space? The big, bright, airy room has a thoroughly pleasant brasserie vibe, but, if the weather permits, you’d be mad not to bag a space on the terrace, nestled right out the front on a charming, tree-lined street. cafeclovernyc.com\n\nCasino NYC\n\nIf you are looking to be taken back to the glamour of the 70s then look no further than Casino NYC. Designed by Camilla Deterre, the 70 seated dining room behind the entrance is a feast for the eyes with burnt red flooding the rooms from walls to floor and seating. The drama of the room is softened by the range of Pistillino lamps that add a sexy mood and create beautiful light patterns across the walls.\n\nDecor to one side, CASINOS menu is something to be admired: from fresh pastas to crispy meats the food is simple but expertly made and curated. A stand out dish has to be the treviso salad. Blood orange adds zesty bite to this colourful salad complete with pine nuts, olives and squash. A special mention has to be made for the shot glasses, single-flower vases from the 70s - so chic! casino.info\n\nAltro Paradiso\n\nSituated in the heart of SOHO, Altro Paradiso has been serving Italian food since 2016. What makes Altro Paradiso such a hit with locals and tourists alike is its modern take on italian cuisine and the mediterranean aesthetic.\n\nThe restaurant itself is spacious with an authentic feel; large glass windows allow natural light to flood into the restaurant which gives an aura of calmness in the manicness of New York just outside. A firm favourite has to be the all-day arancini balls - crispy, delicious and gooey, it's the recipe everyone wants to steal. A top tip is to visit here during the summer, they place tables on their patio which brings a whole new meaning to eating alfresco. altroparadiso.com\n\nCorner Bar\n\nCorner Bar has a little bit of everything under one roof. Inspired by bistros from around the world, this cosy and intimate restaurant is the perfect place to head after a busy day exploring the city. If you are after a quick breakfast, a spot of lunch or a romantic dinner, the menu offers a vast range of classic dishes expertly cooked and prepared by chef Ignacio Mattos. When in New York trying a burger is essential, and the Corner Bar Burger is a must: American cheese, gherkin, onion, beef patty in between a bun, simple honest goodness that cant go wrong. cornerbarnyc.com\n\nDumbo House\n\nSummer in New York can be stifling, but cooled beneath the spectacular shade of Brooklyn's 133-foot suspension bridge on Dumbo House's two-tired rooftop, with a Soho Mule in hand, you'll have the season in the palm of your hand. Arguably one of the best-looking of the Soho Houses across the globe, Dumbo House fits snugly within its ecosystem: the blue interiors are the exact same shade as the neighbouring Manhattan Bridge, while its walls are peppered with drawings from local Brooklyn artists and a brightly coloured poolside taco bar nods to the area's Latino heritage. It's just as good in winter, too, with no shortage of indoor areas and floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over the Hudson. For sustenance before the hefty crossing over to Williamsburg for late-night cocktails at Westlight, load up on the House's murderously good mac 'n' cheese, before giving into all things hipster (sigh) with the turmeric lamb ribs sweetened with walnut. And don't leave before sunset – the view is worth the membership alone. dumbohouse.com\n\nLe Bernardin\n\nLe Bernardin is hands down one of New York's best kept secrets, despite its extremely convenient location. Situated just yards away from Times Square, it is a nugget of luxury. Le Bernardin in New York opened in 1986, after the Parisian outpost had much success. With fish sitting at the heart of the menu, Le Bernardin earned four stars from the New York Times three months after its opening (it is the only restaurant to have never dropped a star in any review). It is now a three-star Michelin restaurant with what can only be described as one of the most exquisite menus west of the Atlantic Ocean. The menu consists of dishes such as caviar tartare and grilled walu and seared wagyu, but our top tip is to go for the chef's tasting menu if you really want to make the most of your visit. le-bernardin.com\n\nAgern\n\nAgern is a Danish restaurant in a slightly unusual location. Sitting inside the walls of Grand Central Station it's under the same ownership as Copenhagen's famous restaurant Noma. Icelandic head chef Gunnar Gíslason and his team prepare food using the finest ingredients from New York State and you can get everything from tender venison to succulent and fresh lobster. Again what we recommend you do is visit in the evening and embark on the tasting menu (and if you're feeling frivolous definitely add the wine pairing option to your evening). agernrestaurant.com\n\nAtrium Dumbo\n\nIf you've been to New York and haven't been to Dumbo, then we thoroughly recommend doing so. The location of Soho House's latest outpost in the city that never sleeps, you won't be disappointed by Brooklyn's neighbour. With cobbled streets with a certain New England feel about them, there's something for everyone (and a photo op at every street corner thanks to the low-rise buildings and spectacular views on Manhattan). The menu down at Atrium is made up of locally sourced, seasonal ingredients that are prepared with a focused simplicity and elegance prepared by partner and Maitre Cuisinier De France Laurent Kalkotour. The food is fresh, filling and just what you want, whether you go for brunch, lunch or dinner. atriumdumbo.com\n\nCote\n\nHead straight to Cote for the ultimate Korean barbecue experience. This place is all about the meat and heat but don't underestimate this Flatiron joint, you'll only find high end steakhouse quality meat here. The restaurant doesn't look bad either. Fancy Japanese-built grills, marble tables and raw concrete floors make for the perfect New York hang out. They also do a pretty mean cocktail (GQ's favourite was the Cote Old Fashioned!) cotenyc.com\n\nEstela\n\nIf you find yourself in Downtown Manhattan, then you need to visit Estela. With one of the most unique menus we've come across, you're in for a good time (and good feeding). It takes familiar ideas such as tartare, ricotta dumplings, burrata on toast, fried rice and steak, and presents them in new, satisfying ways. Ignacio Mattos, owner and chef of the restaurant, really puts the fun and energy into cooking. Our top pick on the menu? The lunchtime treat that is burrata with salsa verde and charred bread – the salsa verde was good enough to drink. estelanyc.com\n\nLegacy Records\n\nYou've probably heard of the restaurants Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones. Well, Legacy Records is the next venture from the team behind them and it's just as good as its sister outposts. Located at 517 W. 38th Street (that's just a few minutes walk from newly built skyscraper-central Hudson Yard), Legacy Records is home to an 85-seat restaurant with two private dining rooms, Easy Victor Cafe and Ada's Place, and a wine and cocktail bar. The menu is best conquered when food is shared (that way you get to try a hell of a lot more). For us there were two standout dishes on the menu: the wood-roasted octopus and honey-lacquered duck. Do not even think about leaving without having tried both. legacyrecordsrestaurant.com\n\nLegasea\n\nIf you're after a restaurant that is fun and offers a seriously fuss-free menu, then this is your best bet. Legasea is located at the Moxy in Times Square and is the perfect pre-theatre spot for a bite to eat. The seafood-centric brasserie is perfect for those with a taste for the delights of the sea and you can feast upon the likes of wild black sea bass, diver sea scallops and yellowtail sashimi. Don't worry if you're a meat-lover, as there's plenty for you too. legaseany.com\n\nHanoi House\n\nFor Asian cuisine like no other, head to Hanoi House. That's not a suggestion; that's an order. Situated close to Little Italy, this small restaurant does the best Vietnamese food that we have ever tried. The menu is an exploration of tastes and the menu features everything from spicy octopus to charred filet mignon with roasted bone marrow. Seriously good and not at break-the-bank prices. hanoihousenyc.com\n\nGinny's Supper Club, Harlem\n\nThis basement addition to Red Rooster (famous for its comfort food and fried chicken from celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson) is renowned for its Sunday Gospel Brunch. Arrive from ten am to gorge on an unlimited buffet spread for $45 a person, which includes creamy pasta, cornbread, waffles, cakes and, of course, mountains of succulent, crispy fried chicken with just the right amount of chew. Nab a table facing the front of the stage area, where you’ll have the best view of the gospel groups and solo artists that take it in turns to belt out joyous renditions of well-known gospel anthems, with powerful voices that shake the roof, as well as uplifting speeches on unity, happiness and love. It may sound cheesy, but it’s what we need in 2018 and performed with such authenticity. Prepare yourselves to be given the mic as the singers sometimes pass through the room and if it’s your birthday, you’ll be called up to the stage for a special “birthday dance”. ginnyssupperclub.com\n\nWhere to drink\n\nCrosby Street Hotel\n\nA step away from the hustle and bustle of Soho, and just around the corner from Bloomingdales and Balthazar, is this peaceful, light-flooded bar attached to Kit Kemp's super-stylish five-star Firmdale hotel. The vibe may be upscale (Blake Lively and Daniel Craig are regulars) but the tongue-in-cheek decor does away with any snootiness: antique telephones hang on the wall, while quirky dog sculptures and a giant wooden dodo totem bringing intrigue to every corner. Outside, with views onto the Lafayette Garden, a charming cobble-stoned terrace scattered with tiny Moroccan silver cafe tables and full of hanging flower baskets, is a refuge for doe-eyed couples chasing after-work romance. Drinks match up to the design and GQ swears by the Smokey Old Fashioned: Laphroaig Quarter Cask, Antica Formula, Pedro Ximénez, salted maple and Angostura bitters. firmdalehotels.com\n\nWestlight, The William Vale\n\nThis Brooklyn-based hotel might look rather imposing and industrial from the outside, with its giant structure jostling the skyline from enormous stilts, but inside the Westlight bar, with its charming, low-hanging spherical lamps and soft yellow furnishings on the top floor, is full of warmth and character. And, of course, its sparkling views from the floor-to-ceiling windows are legendary. The host, Matthew, strolls around the room introducing himself to guests and will even show you up to the roof for stupendous views across the city if you ask nicely and it’s not too windy. A short but sweet list of cocktails includes a Fall Pimm’s Cup, an unusual and wintery mix of Pimm’s, Scotch, honey, figs, lemon and sage, served long. Accompany your drinks with a moreish bowl of coconut fried cashews, before heading out to explore Brooklyn’s buzzing nightlife. thewilliamvale.com\n\nThe Aviary NYC, Mandarin Oriental\n\nOn the 35th floor of the majestic Mandarin Oriental hotel flanking Central Park, the Aviary NYC bar – opened last year – has some of the best views in Uptown New York, as well as one of the city’s most innovative cocktail concepts. From famed Chicago chef Grant Achatz comes a three- or five-course cocktail menu paired with off-menu snacks ($110 per person), which aims to offer guests the quality and attention they might expect of a Michelin-starred restaurant. A menu of three cocktail lists mimics the sense of occasion you revel in when enjoying a three-course menu, with each drink starting light and finishing creamy. Begin with a gentle take on the Kir Royale, before launching into a boozy In The Rocks and finishing off with a creamy, pudding-like Carrot Cake Ramos, which tastes just like a liquid carrot cake. The food begins with a course nothing short of spectacular: a tower of crispy salt and vinegar pork skin at least three-feet high, which sits as precariously as the Leaning Tower Of Pisa, threatening to topple as soon as you tug off a corner. Trust us, you won’t need a dinner reservation after this. aviarynyc.com\n\nDead Rabbit\n\nHaving just recovered from a significant fire, Dead Rabbit, dubbed the best bar in the world, might be expected to be rough around the edges. But this speakeasy-style bar is as thriving as ever. Two experienced and unobtrusive bartenders man the upstairs bar, preferring to let you make your own mind up about the drinks without boring you to death about their “creative vision” (London, take note) and without even juggling a cocktail shaker to show off (again, London...) Sit at the bar so you can watch the mixology and spend the first five minutes reading the carefully written comic book (volume four, issue six) about Dead Rabbit’s heroic conquests, which influences each of the three cocktail lists. From the first, GQ tried the Dawn Control, a refreshing, lightly sparkling long drink with gin, bergamot, green chilli, lemongrass, thai, absinthe, basil, lemon, pineapple and tonic, paired with a couple of oysters. From the last chapter, we highly recommend the sweet and fortifying Red Alert, with scotch, rhubarb amaro, lychee, bitter aperitif, Peychaud’s bitters and cherry and feel your limbs turn heavy as the bar’s motown and blues playlist ramps up for the evening. deadrabbitnyc.com\n\nWhat to do\n\nNew York Media Boat Trip\n\nSightseeing in New York requires a great deal of walking, so why not spend an afternoon out on the Hudson in a private charter, ticking off more legendary spots than you could otherwise have hoped to over the course of an entire trip? New York Media Boat is named so because, before being a tourist service, its fleet was equipped to serve photojournalists (and their kit). Its powerful rib boats were designed for use by US Navy Seals – expect dipping, diving and whoop-inducing speed, all from the confines of an exceptionally safe vessel (we guarantee that, even on the tightest turn, not even a water bottle will fall out). It all feels very James Bond. Over the course of several hours, your guide will take you from one end of the island to the other, with stops under the Brooklyn Bridge, Ellis Island, the Williamsburg Bridge and, of course, the Statue Of Liberty. It really is an extraordinary experience, whizzing past all of downtown in a matter or minutes, taking in sites from One World Trade Centre (near the New York Media Boat dock) all the way to Harlem. Expect plenty of Insta-worth moments (maritime photographers still use this company) as well as fascinating commentary from your guide, including, if you’re lucky, a look at East 57th, the only street in Manhattan that gives you an unobscured view from the Eastside all the way to the Westside. You don’t have to book out the whole boat, but we heartily encourage you do so, especially if you’re celebrating something special. nymediaboat.com\n\nNYonair\n\nIf you're after a once-in-a-lifetime experience that is, well, pretty unbeatable, then we can't recommend New York On Air enough. Being the only helicopter company in NYC to have a licence to fly over Manhattan, you won't be disappointed by what is on offer. Fancy hanging out of a helicopter hundreds of feet above the Freedom Tower? Well, you can. What's more, you can completely customise your ride, meaning if you want to get some stellar photographs of the Empire State Building, you will. newyorkonair.com\n\nWhere to stay\n\nAs regulars to New York City, the GQ team is quite well-versed in when is good to stay, which areas to stay in and what hotels have the best beds. With that in mind, check out our guide to the best hotels in New York that you need to visit right now.\n\nWhere to spa\n\nAire Ancient Baths\n\nYou’ll be hard-pressed to find a more peaceful escape amidst New York’s chaotic energy than the Aire Baths downtown in Tribeca. A candlelit collection of pools occupy a dark and intimate basement, housed in a former textile factory built in 1883, and guests follow a 90-minute bathing circuit, beginning with a salt scrub before a dip in the salt bath, followed by the jacuzzi, the bath at room temperature, cold plunge pools and an almost unbearably hot bath. A steam room and lounge area for mint tea allow time for momentary pit-stops from the water and soothing jazz and classical music induces a trance-like state if you float for long enough. Reservations are hard to come by as Aire keeps the number of guests following the circuit at a minimum to avoid overcrowding. In the changing rooms, expect five-star service from cheerful staff, who will even spin-dry your bathing suit while you shower. beaire.com\n\nNow read\n\nWhat to do in Philadelphia: 12 restaurants, five bars, no cheesesteaks\n\nBarbados holiday guide: The best restaurants, bars and hotels\n\nGQ City Guide: Miami"
