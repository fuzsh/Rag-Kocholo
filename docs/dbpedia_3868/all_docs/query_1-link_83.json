Renowned classicist Lionel Casson takes us on a lively tour, from the royal libraries of the most ancient Near East, through the private and public libraries of Greece and Rome, down to the first Christian monastic libraries. To the founders of the first public libraries of the Greek world goes the credit for creating the prototype of today's library buildings and the science of organizing books in them.\"--BOOK JACKET.\n\nType\n\nBooks\n\nPhysical description\n\nxii, 177 p. : ill., maps ; 22 cm\n\nSmithsonian Libraries\n\nTopic\n\nLibraries--History\n\nRecord ID\n\nsiris_sil_960606\n\nMetadata Usage (text)\n\nCC0"
