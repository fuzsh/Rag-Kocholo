        "text": "TV, news and social media might have you wondering, 'how safe is NYC for tourists?' But we're here to put your mind at ease: the truth is that New York City is one of the safest big cities in the world.\n\nVisitors are constantly under the protection of the city's vigilant police force. Having said this, that doesn't mean that you don't need to be cautious to stay safe. If you're visiting New York and you're wondering if New York City is safe, do some research to prepare yourself for your trip.\n\nFamiliarizing yourself with the city's hazards, and being pragmatic, and prepared is all you need to ensure peace of mind.\n\nHow safe is NYC for tourists?\n\nThe crime rate is relatively low in New York City. When crimes occur they usually don't take place in tourist-heavy areas around Manhattan. For example, most sightseers are unlikely to visit Harlem, the Bronx, or other boroughs where crimes are most likely to occur.\n\nThat being said, there are a few things a tourist in New York City should be wary of.\n\nIs Central Park safe at night?\n\nAs any local will tell you, it's never a good idea to go through Central Park at night. While Central Park is an iconic tourist attraction during the day, it is technically supposed to be closed late at night and in the early hours of the morning.\n\nThe vast majority of cases of crime and violence in the park occur at night. It may seem tempting to take a stroll in Central Park after dark, but it's safer to wait for the sun to come up. Generally speaking, you want to stay away from areas of the city when they are empty and deserted.\n\nIs the Financial District safe?\n\nMany commercial areas of the city like the Financial District tend to become deserted after business hours. The fewer people there are in an area, the less safe it's likely to be in a big city.\n\nIs the New York subway safe?\n\nIt's especially important to be vigilant on the subway in New York, and avoid taking the train late at night if possible. If you're riding the subway, try to stay in cars where there are many people rather than choosing a vacant car. Being in an empty train car isn't a safe option for tourists, particularly if you look lost (or are actually lost) or are new to the city.\n\nProbably the biggest threat in New York is pickpocketing. Protect yourself by wearing a wallet on the inside of your clothing and staying away from panhandlers.\n\n❗Try to look like a local. When you're dressing for sightseeing, try to take note of what the locals are wearing and emulate that if you can. If there's a thief or pickpocket around, they're going to target those who seem unfamiliar with their surroundings. Don't openly wander around with your head buried in a map - familiarize yourself with NYC's grid system, and plan your movements over breakfast or brunch. Soon you won't need a map to travel.\n\n❗Keep your valuables well hidden. To avoid pickpockets, always make sure that your valuables are hidden. Be discreet when you're using your smartphone or a digital camera. Showcasing any valuable possessions regularly could prove to be dangerous and make you a prime target for mugging.\n\n❗Travel in groups when you're unfamiliar with an area. If you're not familiar with the city and you're vacationing in a group, try not to go off by yourself. Being alone and obviously from out of the area could make you a target if you have the misfortune of finding yourself around the wrong people. There are plenty of tours available with The New York Pass®\n\n❗Research destinations before you go. The more research you do, the better able you'll be to find what you're looking for. The nyctourism.com website is a great place to start for researching essential information to help you feel like a local before you get there.\n\n❗Ask police officers for help. During your stay in New York City, you're probably going to see many of the ubiquitous NYPD cars and officers. You can expect New York City police officers to be very helpful when it comes to providing directions, and addressing any concerns you have about safety or dangerous situations.\n\n❗Take extra precautions in touristy places like Times Square. Never leave your valuables unattended - and don't put your purse on the floor or hang it off the back of your chair while dining.\n\nRemember, asking if NYC is safe doesn't matter if you disregard all precautions, so just because NYC is considered one of the safest cities in the world to travel to, you still need to be careful in any city that is considered safe to visit."
