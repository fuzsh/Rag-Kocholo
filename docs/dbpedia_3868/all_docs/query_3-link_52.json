        "text": "Oh yeah it's no surprise that Texas LOVES Whataburger. But we're not the only ones; some of the biggest celebrities have shown a huge love for the orange W. Here are some celebrities that have a love for Whataburger.\n\nMatthew McConaughey\n\nIn 2019, at a San Angelo Whataburger, the Dazed & Confused star was not only seen ordering food from Whataburger, but the people working the drive-thru even managed to get Matthew to say the famous catchphrase from that movie. I wonder if he says this before he digs in?\n\nSelena\n\nYes the Queen of Tejano Music has shared her love for Whataburger before; during the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, Selena won the Female Entertainer of the Year & Female Artist of the Year. And how was she gonna celebrate? \"Free Whataburgers for everybody!\" We miss you Selena.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nAnother Selena that loves Whataburger is Selena Gomez; on of her most known Twitter posts regarding Whataburger came in 2014, FROM the official Whataburger Twitter page, where they said that they will always be there for the pop star. It also turns out that her favorite thing on the menu is the #13 with a side of gravy, according to the Dallas News.\n\nPatrick Mahomes\n\nYes the Super Bowl winning quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs is a HUGE fan of Whataburger; the Tyler, Texas native even brought a little taste of home to Kansas City by BRINGING a Whataburger franchise to KC. He's also gone on record to say it's his favorite burger place.\n\nB.J. Novak\n\nYou might know him as Ryan Howard from The Office, but he's been known to appreciate Whataburger too. In his film, Vengeance (which he filmed & directed), he included a scene that pretty much sums up how every Texan feels when Whataburger is brought up. I'm sure he feels this way too; why else would he have a scene dedicated to Whataburger?\n\nMick Jagger\n\nIt turns out the Rolling Stones lead singer loves burgers, Whataburger included. Although he has also said that there are multiple spots around Texas that he loves to visit; you can see that list right here.\n\nYou never know which celebrity you'll find at Whataburger, so it's best to keep an eye out for any familiar faces the next time you go."
