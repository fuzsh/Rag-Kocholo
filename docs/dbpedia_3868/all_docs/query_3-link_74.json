        "text": "Defenseman Art Coulter played nearly 500 NHL games for the Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers during an exemplary career. An athlete of exceptional strength and endurance, he was fiercely devoted to the concept of teamwork.\n\nThe native of Winnipeg, Manitoba began making a name for himself in his hometown with the senior Pilgrims. He gained two and a half years of professional experience with the Philadelphia Arrows of the Can-Am League. He excelled at both ends of the ice and demonstrated a willingness to mix it up with the opposition by leading the league in penalty minutes in 1930-31.\n\nAfter playing the last 13 games of the regular season and two playoff matches for Chicago in 1931-32, Coulter became a regular the next year. His physical play and ability to handle the puck made Coulter a perfect defense partner for burly Taffy Abel. The solid duo played a key role on the Hawks' inaugural Stanley Cup win in 1934.\n\nCoulter was placed on the NHL second all-star team in 1935 but found himself traded to the Rangers for Earl Seibert midway through the next season. His solid defensive play and competitive zeal pleased the New York management and fans. Prior to the 1937-38 season, Coulter succeeded Bill Cook as captain and was selected to the second all-star team three straight years beginning in 1938. In 1939 he took part in the Babe Siebert Memorial Game and the next year he helped the Blueshirts win their third Stanley Cup. Coulter set a career high with 19 points the following season and was one of the most popular players on Manhattan.\n\nThe veteran defender joined the Canadian Armed Forces during World War II and spent two seasons with the Coast Guard Cutters when they played out of the Eastern League. Coulter was one of the top attractions in the league and was placed on the first all-star team in 1943. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1974.\n\nChristian Rudolph Ebsen, Jr.\n\nBorn 1908\n\nActor, comedian and dancer Buddy Ebsen is best known for his role as Jed Clampett on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" and detective Barnaby Jones. Ebsen a well-known dancer from a vaudeville, appeared in several early films, including one with Shirley Temple. He was originally cast as the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz. Unfortunately the aluminum dust used in the make-up got into his system. Ebsen had to drop out of shooting in order recuperate. When he returned he found out that he had been replaced with actor Jack Haley. In a contract dispute with MGM Ebsen found that he had time on his hands so he started sailing.\n\nLT Buddy Ebsen, USCGR\n\n[190513-G-G0000-3002]\n\nIn 1941 he decided to apply for a Navy commission but was turned down even though he was spending time teaching seamanship to Naval Reserve OCS candidates. Ebsen applied for a commission in the Coast Guard. He was accepted and commissioned a Lieutenant (jg) in the Coast Guard. He served on the Navy frigate USS Pocatello, a weather ship that served on Station Able. He was honorably discharged a Lieutenant in 1946. Ebsen went on to various bit parts in movies, but his career really took off when Walt Disney hired him to play George Russel, Davey Crockett’s (Fess Parker), partner.\n\nBuddy Ebsen crossed the bar on 6 July 2003.\n\nCesar Julio Romero, Jr., was born on 15 February 1907 in New York City to Cuban-American parents. He was the godson of Jose Marti, a leader of the Cuban revolution. Romero attended schools in New York and Connecticut and planned on a career in banking. A chance meeting with Lisbeth Higgins started Romero on a professional dancing career--as her partner--that took him from the hotel showrooms of Manhattan to the Broadway stage and eventually, Hollywood. In 1934 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios tapped the young man for the role of a gigolo in \"The Thin Man.\" Romero later played Warner Baxter's sidekick in \"The Return of the Cisco Kid,\" eventually moving into a starring role. He was signed by Twentieth Century-Fox in 1937.\n\nCesar Romero\n\n[190513-G-G0000-2005]\n\nIn October, 1942, he voluntarily enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard and saw service in the Pacific Theatre. He reported aboard the Coast Guard-manned assault transport U.S.S. Cavalier (APA-37) in November, 1943 and saw action at Tinian and Saipan. According to a press release from the period:\n\nRomero preferred to be one of the crew and asked for no special privileges, which he did not receive. His shipmates admired him for this and for his exceptionally hard work. Romero was considered to be one of the best winch operators, swinging 18,000 lb. barges from their deck cradles over the side of the transport during invasions or while loading cargo. Among other duties he was first powderman on the forward five-inch gun. When an occasion permitted recreation, Romero helped put on a variety show for the crew. Later in the war he assisted in Bond rallies.\n\nCesar Romero\n\n[190513-G-G0000-3011]\n\nHe made the rank of Chief Boatswain's Mate before receiving his honorable discharge at the end of the war. He then returned to Hollywood. He was best remembered by contemporary audiences for his portrayal of The Joker on the 1960s television show \"Batman.\" He passed away on 2 January 1994 at the age of 86.\n\nElizabeth Smith Friedman, Coast Guard Cryptanalyst, born in 1892, was one of the most remarkable women to ever work for the U.S. Government. The National Security Agency described her as: \"wife, mother, writer, Shakespeare enthusiast, cryptanalyst, and pioneer in U.S. cryptology.\" (1) While not a member of the Coast Guard per se, Mrs. Friedman was the Treasury Department's cryptanalyst, hired in 1924, who assisted the various departments of the Treasury with code breaking. Her work with the Coast Guard began soon after the passage of the Volstead Act. Liquor smugglers frequently made use of radios to coordinate their activities and began to encode their messages. Ms. Friedman was then detailed to the Coast Guard and so began a remarkable career with the nation's oldest sea service breaking these illicit codes. She was quite successful and is credited with \"breaking\" the code of over 12,000 different encoded radio messages.\n\nShe was also a star government witness at a number of smugglers' trials, including the famous I'm Alone case. In 1938 she \"cracked\" the code used by an opium smuggling ring operating out of Canada. In this instance she assisted the Canadian government. A newspaper article noted:\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Smith Friedman, Coast Guard cryptanalyst, returned to Washington with the story of how the solution of Chinese code broke up a Canadian opium smuggling ring. Mrs. Friedman, who was lent by the U.S. Government to the Canadian Government, was a key witness at a trial in which five Vancouver, B.C., Chinese were convicted of trading guns and ammunition for opium. Her job was to turn such messages as 'Uuooa masan aguso gukuu juuia ety' into the order list of Wat Sang. She declined for professional reasons, however, to say how this was done, although she admitted the message was a code of Chinese words and that she does not know Chinese. After she solved the code, a Chinese interpreter helped translate the message. Mrs. Friedman has been the cryptanalyst since 1924 and handles deciphering work for all agencies of the Treasury. During prohibition days, she sometimes had hundreds rum runners' code messages to solve. (2)\n\nHer husband was also a famous cryptanalyst, William Friedman.\n\nSources\n\n1) U.S. National Security Agency's website.\n\n2) \"Cracks Chino Code,\" Coast Guard Magazine Vol. 10 (August, 1938), p. 60.\n\nNetminder Frank \"Mr. Zero\" Brimsek was one of the greatest players ever to hail from the United States. In a decade of NHL service, the accurately nicknamed Mr. Zero registered 80 shutouts and won 252 regular-season games. He led all netminders in shutouts, goals-against average and wins twice each, and he backstopped Boston to Stanley Cup wins in 1939 and 1941.\n\nThe Minnesota native starred with his hometown Eveleth Rangers in 1934-35, then joined the formidable Pittsburgh Yellowjackets of the USAHA later that same year. Steeltown agreed with Brimsek as he recorded 14 wins in 16 matches. The next season he, and the entire team, switched to the pro ranks in the Eastern Hockey League. The promising youngster registered a league-high 20 wins and 8 shutouts during the 1935-36 schedule. At the conclusion of the season he was placed on the EHL First All-Star Team and was presented the George L. Davis Jr. Trophy for allowing the fewest goals.\n\nNext it was off to the Providence Reds where he led the AHL with 48 games played and a 1.75 goals-against mark. His unlimited potential convinced the Boston Bruins to sign him to replace their aging incumbent, Tiny Thompson. During his rookie season Brimsek showed no sign of buckling under the pressure of replacing an NHL legend. In one of the greatest first-year performances ever, he was in goal for 33 Boston wins and topped the league with 10 shutouts and a 1.56 goals-against mark. In addition, he posted two shutout streaks of more than 200 minutes each. During the playoffs he recorded eight wins in 12 games as Boston won its second Stanley Cup. Brimsek's heroics between the pipes were confirmed when he was awarded the Calder Trophy.\n\nBrimsek was a classic standup goalie whose confidence on the ice threw off many a shooter. On breakaways and penalty shots he would often lean back calmly against his net as the foe approached. But he was not a passive figure while guarding his cage - Brimsek used his custom-made heavy stick to knock the puck off opposition sticks or to take the feet out from under someone who took too many liberties around his goal.\n\nIn 1941 his stellar goalkeeping contributed to the Bruins' second Stanley Cup in three years. That year he won his first of two Vezina trophies and was selected to the NHL First All-Star Team. The 1941-42 season arguably spoke the loudest for Brimsek's importance to the Bruins. After the famous Kraut Line of Milt Schmidt, Bobby Bauer and Woody Dumart enlisted in the Canadian Armed Forces, Mr. Zero almost single-handedly guided his club to a spot in the playoffs. In 1943 the Second World War interrupted Brimsek's career, and he joined the Coast Guard. He played on the Coast Guard \"Cutters\" hockey team and then served aboard a Coast Guard supply ship in the Pacific until the end of the war.\n\nBrimsek returned to the Bruins in 1945-46. Considering the layoff, he did well to earn selection to the NHL Second All-Star Team. He played three more years with Boston, but the team was not as strong as it had been before the war. Brimsek's netminding heroics kept the Bruins in many games during this period, and in 1948 he finished second to the Rangers' Buddy O'Connor in the Hart Trophy voting.\n\nIn September 1949 the Bruins sold Brimsek to the Chicago Black Hawks. He played all 70 games in the expanded NHL schedule behind a weak squad. He finally retired after the team failed to qualify for the post-season. Although he did not go out on a high note, his superb record over the years was not forgotten. Brimsek registered nine 20-win seasons and logged over 31,000 minutes of ice time.\n\nIn 1966 he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and, fittingly, \"Mr. Zero\" was also one of the first players elected to the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, located in his hometown of Eveleth, Minnesota.\n\nOn October 1925 then Major Patton received the Silver Lifesaving Medal. The inscription on the rear of the medal states:\n\n\"To George S. Patton, Jr. for bravely rescuing three boys from drowning on 3 February 1926.\"\n\nAt the time of the rescue Patton was on 3 months of leave in Salem, Massachusetts. He had just graduated from Advanced Cavalry School in FT Riley, Kansas. He was on leave prior to his reporting to the General Service School in FT Leavenworth.\n\nThe citation reads:\n\nMajor Patton and his wife, sailing over the harbor of Salem, Massachusetts, August 21, 1923, when a squall blew up. Being unable to weather around and return home they continued on across the harbor, after which they heard cries of distress astern. Still being unable to go about, Major Patton maneuvered his boat so as to drift toward three boys observed clinging to a capsized dory from which the mast and sails had been unshipped and floating around making the approach very awkward. One boy called that his companion could not swim, whereupon Major Patton reached out an oar, taking the boys, one by one over the stern into his boat, which then had practically no freeboard. Nevertheless, he managed to reach the lee of the land and dropped the boys safely on a pier, about one and on-half miles distant.\n\nHamilton Cochran was born on 9 September 1898 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father Joseph, a clergyman, sought to give his son a good education and sent him to Swarthmore Preparatory School. In April 1917, after the United States declared war on Germany, Hamilton, at only eighteen, left school within a week and enlisted in the United States Coast Guard.\n\nAfter three months of training in New London, Connecticut at the Coast Guard Academy, located in Fort Trumball, the Service assigned him to the USCGC Algonquin. This Coast Guard cutter was one of six warships that the Coast Guard sent to fight in Europe. On 25 September, the Algonquin steamed from Boston, towing a minesweeper to Halifax and then sailed for Gibraltar, arriving there on 16 October.\n\nDuring the war, the Algonquin convoyed merchant ships between the English Channel ports and Gibraltar. Hamilton spent fifteen months on this duty. The Algonquin participated in twenty-one convoys without losing a single ship. The Algonquin returned to New London in February 1919. During Cochran's twenty-three months in the Coast Guard, he visited twenty-eight different ports and returned to the states a seasoned tar.\n\nService to his country had a huge impact on the young man. Within months after stepping off the Algonquin he wrote a couple of documents that related to his wartime service. One was entitled \"Hunting the Hun with the Coast Guard.\" Restless for knowledge Cochran entered the University of Michigan that fall, after only three years of study, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism.\n\nAfter college, Cochran could not shake the sea from his veins and sailed on the Red Star and Munson lines in passenger and freight vessels. For seven years he worked for Ronald Press as a salesman and from 1930 until 1932 he served as a vice president of the Diamond Wax Paper Company in Rochester, New York.\n\nIn 1932, his life took a turn that would foster his writing for the rest of his life. He accepted a job as the Commissioner of Public Welfare for the government of the Virgin Islands, St. Thomas. While in the islands he became fascinated by the history of area and particularly the tales of pirates. Here he was able to gather much of the material he would use for his first and many of his later books.\n\nIn 1937, he wrote his first book entitled: These are the Virgin Islands. It is a historic synthesis of the rich history of the islands. It narrates some of the islands' unique maritime tales and relates the events and the people, which make up the region's rich lore. Between 1935 and 1943, Cochran worked for Standard Oil Company as an advertising executive. During these years his writing career flourished. In 1941 he wrote his first novel entitled Buccaneer Islands. It was written for young readers and was published by Thomas Nelson. Later came Windward Passage (Bobbs-Merrill, 1942) and Captain Ebony (Bobbs-Merrill, 1943). In writing these books he utilized material he collected while he had worked in the Virgin Islands. In 1944 he landed a job with Curtis Publishing Company as the automotive marketing manager for the Saturday Evening Post. Three years later he published his fourth novel Rogue's Holiday, published by Bobbs-Merrill.\n\nDuring World War II, at the age of forty-four, feeling that his country needed him, he again joined the Coast Guard. He served as a temporary reservist in Flotilla 605. From April to November 1943, Cochran worked several days each month for the Coast Guard.\n\nBy the late 1940s he had traveled extensively throughout the Western Hemisphere. During his life he logged more than 100,000 miles at sea. In 1958, Cochran wrote his most well known book Blockade Runners of the Confederacy, published by Bobbs-Merrill. For decades this book has served as a general resource for everyone who is interested in reading about the Civil War blockade. In 1960, Curtis Publishing Company made Cochran the director of advertising. Two years later he began work for Stanley Publishing Company as a vice president. Cochran retired in 1964 devoting his time to writing and volunteer work with the Philadelphia Maritime Museum.\n\nCochran also contributed poems to three anthologies and wrote articles for the Saturday Evening Post, Esquire, and other magazines. In 1976, a year before he died, his final book, Pirate Wench: The Voyages and Adventures of Ann O'Shea was published by R. Hale. In all, he wrote thirteen books during his lifetime.\n\nWilliam Harrison Dempsey\n\nBorn June 24, 1895 - Died May 31, 1983\n\nJack Dempsey first started boxing professionally in 1914. He first started boxing under the name of \"Kid Blacky\" and later boxed under the name of the \"Manassa Mauler\" after his home town of Manassa, Colorado. Throughout the 1920’s and 1930’s he was extremely popular and is probably one of the most popular boxing champions of all times. He knocked out Jess Willard in 1919 to win the heavyweight boxing title. He lost the heavyweight boxing titles in 1926 to Gene Tunney. He lost again in his second fight with Gene Tunney because of a long count. He knocked Tunney down in the seventh round but because he did not go to a neutral corner immediately the referee delayed the count. Tunney got up at the count of nine and went on to win the bout on a decision. He retired from boxing afterwards.\n\nJack Dempsey\n\n[190513-G-G0000-2001]\n\nDuring World War II Dempsey joined New York State National Guard and was given a commission as a first lieutenant. He resigned that commission to accept a commission as a lieutenant in the Coast Guard Reserve. He reported for active duty on 12 June 1942 at Coast Guard Training Station, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York, where he was assigned as \"Director of Physical Education.\" He also made many personal appearances at fights, camps, hospitals and War Bond drives. He was promoted to lieutenant commander (temporary) in December 1942 and commander (temporary) in March of 1944. In 1944 he was assigned to the transport USS Wakefield. In 1945 he was on the attack transport USS Arthur Middleton for the invasion of Okinawa. In July of 1945 he assigned to the Commander, 11th Naval District for assignment to Military Morale Duty. He was released from active duty in September 1945.\n\nJack Dempsey\n\n[190513-G-G0000-3001]\n\nHe was given an honorable discharge from the Coast Guard Reserve in 1952.\n\n1917-2000\n\nJacob Armstead Lawrence was born on 17 September 1917 in Atlantic City, NJ. After spending part of his youth in both Philadelphia and Easton, PA, his mother moved the family to Harlem. His arrival coincided with the great \"Harlem Renaissance\" of the 1920s and early 1930s. This area was the center of a vibrant artistic community that was greatly influenced by the emergence of African-American social consciousness. It was his experiences during this time that shaped both his development and his future work as an artist.\n\nJacob Lawrence, later in his career.\n\n[190513-G-G0000-2003]\n\nShowing an interest in art, particularly the works of the Italian Renaissance painters, Lawrence received encouragement from his fellow artists in the community. He received his early training at the Harlem Art Workshops sponsored by the New Deal’s Works Progress Administration (WPA) and he produced some of his first significant works while a member of the WPA Federal Art Project. Between 1937 and 1940 he painted a series of \"multi-part narratives\" of prominent figures in black history including Toussaint L’Ouverture, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Tubman. This was followed by his renowned series entitled \"The Migration of the American Negro\" which depicted the post-World War I movement of Southern blacks in search of employment to the North. The Downtown Gallery first exhibited the series in November 1941 and Lawrence became nationally renown. Later the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Phillips Collection in Washington jointly purchased the series after Fortune published a number of the images. Around this time Lawrence also married his wife of 59 years, fellow artist Gwendolyn Knight.\n\nIn October 1943 Lawrence was drafted into the Coast Guard, then part of the Navy. As the armed services were still segregated, he, along with all African-American recruits, was automatically limited to the steward’s mate rate. After his basic training at Curtis Bay, MD he was assigned to the Ponce de Leon Hotel (commandeered by the Coast Guard) in St. Augustine, FL. Despite his rate, Lawrence was urged to continue his artistic endeavors by his commanding officer, CAPT J.S. Rosenthal. He was later transferred to USCGC Sea Cloud, the first integrated ship in the naval services. The ship’s skipper, LCDR (later CAPT) Carlton Skinner, knew of Lawrence’s prominence as an artist and helped him obtain a Public Relations Specialist (PR3) rate. As such, Lawrence documented life on board Sea Cloud. His series on the Coast Guard was displayed at New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 1944. Later transferred to USS General W.P. Richardson, he served as one of the service’s first combat artists. With the war’s end, he received an honorable discharge in December 1945. In his relatively short time in the service (26 months), Lawrence had created more than fifty works of art. Most of these works, however, were lost in the post-war demobilization. Though all that remained were some black and white photographs, the evocative quality of these paintings were still clearly visible.\n\n\"Control Panel\" by Jacob Lawrence\n\n[190513-G-G0000-9001]\n\nWith his discharge from the service, Lawrence continued his career as an artist. In 1946 he received a Guggenheim Post-Service Fellowship. With this award he produced his \"War\" series which depicted the emotional responses to the war. Throughout the remainder of his life, Lawrence continued to produce prodigiously. He was, for example, commissioned to paint murals for the Munich Olympic Games in 1972 and the Bicentennial in 1976, as well as covers for Time. He also joined the faculty of the University of Washington in Seattle. He died, after a long illness, at his home in Seattle on 19 June 2000. With his numerous paintings chronicling the African-American experience in spare, yet evocative fashion, Jacob Lawrence secured his stature as one of the most prominent American artists of the 20th century.\n\n\"Landing Craft\" by Jacob Lawrence\n\n[190513-G-G0000-9002]\n\nThe name John Mariucci was synonymous with the growth of amateur and professional hockey in Minnesota for over 40 years. He was a player, coach, administrator, and promoter who was a major reason why the game spread faster in the Gopher state than anywhere else in the United States.\n\nThe native of Eveleth, Minnesota was a standout in hockey and football as a boy. He later excelled in both sports at the University of Minnesota. In 1940 he was named an all-American on the varsity hockey team while helping the gridiron squad win the NCAA national championship.\n\nAfter graduating from college Mariucci played five NHL seasons with the Chicago Black Hawks. He was a solid defensive forward and combative team leader who served as captain twice. Mariucci didn't back down from any opponent and waged many a fierce battle with rugged \"Black Jack\" Stewart of the Detroit Red Wings. When his NHL days ended, Mariucci suited up for the St. Louis Flyers of the American Hockey League and the Minneapolis Millers of the United States Hockey League. During World War II Mariucci served in the United States Coast Guard. He also continued to play hockey as defenseman on the service's team, the Coast Guard Cutters, from 1942 to 1944.\n\nAs admirable a player as he was, Mariucci's true calling was as a coach and nurturer of talent. He took over as coach of the University of Minnesota hockey team and immediately declined to recruit players from Canada. An important part of this emphasis on home grown talent was a challenge sent out by Mariucci to high schools throughout the state to start their own programs and develop interest in their respective communities. Between 1952 and 1980 the number of high school teams grew from a handful to more than 150.\n\nMariucci produced several all-Americans at the university and expanded his own horizons by getting involved with international hockey. He coached the US Olympic team to the silver medal at the 1956 Cortina games.

He played in a number of prominent Big Bands, including those led by Charlie Spivak, and Claude Thornhill. In 1939 he joined the Coast Guard. Assigned to play in military shows, he showed his forte to show producer Max Liebman, by his ability to make other musicians laugh. Liebman took him out of the orchestra and cast him as a comedian, jump-starting his career upon release from the Coast Guard in 1945.\n\nCaesar made his television debut in a variety show named \"Admiral Broadway Review’ and later renamed \"Your Show of Shows\", costarring comedian Imogene Coca.\n\nThe Coast Guard recently presented Mr. Caesar with a public service award during a celebration of his 80th birthday. The citation read as follows:\n\n\"The Commandant of the United Stated Coast Guard takes great pleasure in wishing a joyous 80th birthday to Coast Guard veteran Sid Caesar and presenting to him this Coast Guard Certificate of Appreciation, in recognition of his public support of the Coast Guard, most notably in the early days of his career as an actor, musician and comedian and more recently as public spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard. Mr. Caesar joined the Coast Guard in 1939, after studying saxophone at the Julliard School of Music and playing in a number of prominent big bands. In the Coast Guard, he was assigned to play in military revues and shows, such as \"Tars and Spars,\" but he showed a natural penchant for comedy by entertaining other band members with his improvised routines, prompting show producer Max Liebman to move him from the orchestra and cast him as a stand-up comedian to entertain troops, jump-starting his career upon his release from the Coast Guard in 1945. After leaving the Coast Guard, Mr. Caesar went on to perform his \"war routine\" in both the stage and movie versions of the revue, and continued under Liebman's guidance after the war, in theatrical performances in the Catskills and Florida, but he never forgot the service that launched his career. Mr. Caesar's performance distinguished the Coast Guard as an honorable and valuable service. Friends and acquaintances say he always kept the Coast Guard close to his heart, especially its hardworking enlisted members. Each and every time the Coast Guard asked Mr. Caesar for a favor, he came through for us, whether it was speaking before the Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association or recording audio public service announcements for Coast Guard recruiting campaigns. His respect, admiration and fondness for our service shines bright. Mr. Caesar's years of generosity, concern and dedication to the Coast Guard family are deeply appreciated and are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Coast Guard and public service.\"\n\nBorn May 8, 1920\n\nSloan Wilson, author of \"The Man In The Grey Flannel Suit\", one of the most influential novels about Madison Avenue advertising and life in \"suburbia\" during the 1950’s, was born in Norwalk, Connecticut.
