        "text": "Transcript\n\nNew York, the Big Apple. The city which Liberty calls home. The first thing one notices on arrival in New York are all the cars. Honking wildly, the famous yellow cabs plough their way through the long urban canyons. And where there are a lot of cars, you'll find a lot of people. Eight million people of all nationalities, cultures and religion are crowded here together. New York is a city that pulsates to the throb of its own heartbeat - the city that never sleeps. The New York cityscape is characterized by many famous skyscrapers. The Chrysler Building, the Rockefeller Center - these views are so breathtaking they don't even get old for New Yorkers.\n\nNew York is the epitome of hustle and bustle. Clad in sharp suits, Wall Street business people rush from meeting to meeting. China Town is another, if entirely different, hive of activity. It is home to the largest Chinese community outside Asia, and it is fascinating to observe this authentic piece of China in the middle of the American metropolis.\n\nCentral Park is the surrogate back garden for many New Yorkers, a place where they can meet friends, celebrate or just enjoy their free time. At weekends particularly, the four-kilometer park is full of joggers, but those in search of more relaxing ways to pass the time can also find what they're looking for here. And since the park lies at the heart of Manhattan, between 12 and two you can witness many a banker taking a well-earned lunch break.\n\nArt and culture are a huge part of city life. There is always something new to discover, not only in the garishly illuminated Times Square. New York is also famous for its many parades. Sometimes even the main traffic arteries are closed to make way for the marches. Many of the communities and cultures here hold annual parades. When the sun goes down and the lights go up, the city's paparazzi, an intrinsic part of New York life, creep from their hidey holes as the beautiful people of the Big Apple put themselves on display to great effect. Extreme, fascinating, extraordinary. When will you sink your teeth into the Big Apple?"
