        "text": "The people who passed through Ellis added richness and texture to the American story. They found jobs, started businesses, raised families, and made countless contributions to communities all across the country. And some of them became very well known.\n\nEllis Island passenger logs brim with names like Einstein, Houdini, and Hitchcock. They paint a picture of the passions that shaped the 20th century and show us where the roots of American literature, art, and science originated.\n\nAlong with records of immigration, there are entries for native-born passengers like Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Roosevelt. Returning home from trips abroad, you can imagine how their experience sailing through New York Harbor past the Statue of Liberty informed their future presidencies. There are also names of famous visitors like opera star Enrico Caruso, artist Frida Kahlo, and writer W.B. Yeats.\n\nThese records are part of our history and our heritage. As you look for your own family connection, take a moment to explore the travels of these and other luminaries and consider the role their journeys played in our culture and society."
