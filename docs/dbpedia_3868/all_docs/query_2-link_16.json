        "text": "New York is known for its endless entertainment options, iconic skyscrapers, and bustling atmosphere. It is home to some of America’s most recognizable landmarks, such as the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, and Times Square. One of New York’s defining features is its diversity – it has become a melting pot of different cultures, languages, religions and beliefs.\n\nWithout a doubt, the state of New York is most famous for New York City, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. And in this article, you’ll find out 30 things New York is famous for!\n\nWhat Is New York Known For?\n\n1. Being Called The Big Apple\n\nOne of New York City’s most famous nicknames is “The Big Apple,” which started in the 1920s and came about thanks to sports journalist John J. Fitzgerald who wrote a column for a local newspaper about the many horse races in and around New York, in one column he referred to the amazing prizes which could be won as “the big apple.” And so the nickname for the city began to stick.\n\nThen, the jazz musicians in the 1930s started referring to New York City as “The Big Apple,” and so New York’s fate was eventually sealed!\n\n2. Broadway Shows\n\nNo visit to New York is complete without seeing a Broadway musical. These shows are some of the most sought-out attractions in the city. Matter of fact, starting from 2009, over $1 billion dollars worth of tickets are sold every year!\n\nBroadway Street is, in fact, several miles long, but the Theater District refers to the area between 42nd and 53rd, including Times Square. This area is home to no less than 40 large theaters, each one seating approximately 500 people.\n\nSome of the most famous theaters on Broadway include Richard Rodgers, the Music Box, the Lyric, and the Gershwin Theatre. And each theater hosts an ever-changing selection of musicals and plays.\n\nThe Lion King is the highest-grossing Broadway show of all time. Since its opening night in 1997, the musical based on the Disney movie of the same name has earned over $1.5 billion in ticket sales! Other popular broadway shows include The Phantom of the Opera, Chicago, Cats, Wicked, and Les Miserables.\n\n3. 9/11 Terrorist Attacks\n\nSadly, New York is known for being the site of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. On September 11th, 2001, two planes struck the “Twin Towers”, which were two of the tallest buildings in the world. The attack destroyed the entire World Trade Center Complex, which was home to 7 buildings.\n\nWhen the first plane hit 1 World Trade Center around 8:45 am, hundreds were killed, and hundreds more became trapped on higher floors. Initially, the crash was believed to be a freak accident, but 18 minutes later, when the second plane hit, it was widely recognized as a terrorist attack. The hijackers were part of al Qaeda, and the attack was reportedly financed by Osama bin Laden.\n\nNowadays, visitors can learn more about the event at the 9/11 Memorial Museum. Don’t miss out on the 9/11 Memorial Pools that stood where the original Twin Towers once stood, they are some of the most instagrammable places in NYC.\n\n4. NYC Subways\n\nIn the city that never sleeps, the New York City subway never stops running. Yes, this giant transit system which transports over 6 million passengers daily, runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week!\n\nWould you believe there are 472 subway stations and 22 lines in the New York subway system?! The city’s subway system began operation in 1904, and the first line ran from City Hall to Grand Central Depot.\n\nThe New York City subway is the quickest and cheapest way to get around the city, that is, providing you know what line to take to get to your destination – it can get pretty confusing! It’s typically much faster than hopping in an Uber or taxi because, of course, the subway does not have to deal with New York’s notorious traffic.\n\nBut perhaps what the subway in NYC is notorious for is its sanitation condition. It is frequent for stations to have rats, homeless people, and the smell of urine.\n\n5. Concrete Jungle\n\nAnother popular nickname for New York City is “Concrete Jungle”, a name that possibly came from The Jungle, a novel written by Upton Sinclair in which he introduced the phrase “asphalt jungle.” Over the years, this was changed to “concrete jungle,” although the origins of the term are unclear.\n\n“Concrete” likely replaced “asphalt” in the phrase because New York City, specifically Manhattan, is an island made of concrete – much of the concrete is visible in the buildings but even more lies beneath the city’s surface in the subfloors of apartments, offices, and stores!\n\nIn native New Yorker Jay-Z’s smash hit “Empire State of Mind” he referred to New York as a “concrete jungle where dreams are made.” There is no mistaking that anymore!\n\n6. Cultural Diversity\n\nNew York is a melting pot of culture. Matter of fact, in the five boroughs of New York City, over different 200 languages are spoken! This seems like a huge number, but when you consider that each of New York’s neighborhoods is home to a unique and diverse population, it’s easier to understand why so many languages exist in a relatively small space!\n\nThe city is accepting of everyone, and what’s great is that immigrants are encouraged to hang onto their old culture while partaking in the New York City way of life. Local New Yorkers have a collective understanding of how important it is to keep the traditions of their homeland!\n\nPass through any neighborhood in New York, and you will likely see country flags hanging from the porches, be it Puerto Rican, Mexican, Nigerian, or Jamaican!\n\nWhen you are visiting New York, make sure you spend some time visiting each unique ethnic neighborhood. From Chinatown and Koreatown to Little Italy and Little Guyana, there is plenty of cultural diversity in NYC waiting to be discovered.\n\n7. Being A Popular Filming Location\n\nThanks to NYC’s iconic landmarks, the city has become one of the most popular backdrops for some of the most famous movies in Hollywood. From blockbuster movies such as The Avengers to classics such as King Kong, there are numerous films set in New York.\n\nSome of the most common filming locations in NYC are Central Park, New York Public Library, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n8. As the First Capital of the United States\n\nYou may not know this, but New York is historically known for being the first capital of the United States in 1789 under the constitution. During that time, the Congress and Supreme Court were also situated in NYC. Matter of fact, the first president of America, George Washington, was inaugurated in Federal Hall in New York.\n\nBut its status as the capital was short-lived as many congressmen believed the city to be too busy to serve as the capital. And after a few years of debate, congress met for the final time at Federal Hall in 1790 before transferring the title of capital of Philadelphia and, finally, Washington D.C.\n\n9. Yellow Cabs\n\nWhen you visit New York City, you’re likely going to ride in a yellow cab at some point – these brightly colored taxis are hard-to-miss and, over the years have become synonymous with the city.\n\nThe history of the famed yellow cab goes back over 120 years when taxis were introduced to New York in 1897 by the Electric Vehicle Company. However, after a couple of years, a fire at their base destroyed over 300 cabs, so horse-drawn carriages were re-introduced to the city’s roads.\n\nBut the fares for these carriages were very high, so an entrepreneur named Harry N. Allen decided to start New York Taxicab Company in 1907, and he imported 65 cars from France and painted them yellow! And that’s the short history of New York City’s yellow cab!\n\n10.
