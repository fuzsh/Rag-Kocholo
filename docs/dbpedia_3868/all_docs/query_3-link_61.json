        "text": "Editor's note: This story was originally published in 2018.\n\nA savvy tech investor who noticed \"Spotify.\" A cult leader turned mass murderer. Not one but two Tarzans. The National Rifle Association's very first boss.\n\nAll were from the small towns of Indiana.\n\nAnd so were a lot of other unusual and/or notable people. Here are 48 of them, listed in no particular order.\n\nWe defined \"small town\" as a place having fewer than 17,504 residents. By drawing the line there, we could include the rocker John Mellencamp, which seemed only right because it was he who wrote the hit song, \"Small Town,\" and he's from Seymour, population: 17,503.\n\nSteve McQueen, actor\n\nBorn: Beech Grove, pop. 14,192\n\nSteve McQueen (1930-1980) was a film star who, on the \"cool\" scale , possibly would outrank even James Dean (Fairmount, pop: 2,954). \"No actor since, not even Daniel Craig as James Bond, has done more than echo his catlike grace and genuine aura of danger,\" said an otherwise damning 2011 report in the DailyMail.com. In 2017 McQueen was the subject of a movie called \"Steve McQueen: American Icon,\" about the actor's late-in-life conversion to Christianity.\n\nMore from the archives: That time Indiana teens ratted out dirty ‘Louie Louie’ lyrics, and the FBI got involved\n\nJim Jones, cult leader\n\nBorn: Crete, pop: unincorporated\n\nJim Jones (1931-1978) was a charismatic cult leader who got his start as a preacher in Indianapolis. In the early 1960s he championed civil rights and racial integration and founded a church called the Peoples Temple. He later led his followers to California and finally to the South American nation of Guyana. In the fall of 1978, with American authorities beginning to investigate abuse allegations against him, he ordered his some 900 followers to drink poison. They did, and they died. Jones died of a gunshot wound to the head believed to have been self-inflicted.\n\nFlorence Henderson, 'Brady Bunch' actress\n\nBorn: Dale,pop: 1,593\n\nFlorence Henderson (1934-2016) was best known as the mom on the 1970s sitcom, \"The Brady Bunch,\" about a blended family. It was never clear if Carol Brady was divorced or a widower. She mock-cleared that up in a 2015 interview by saying: \"I killed my husband.\" In Indianapolis, Henderson was best known for her performances, nearly annually since the 1990s, of \"God Bless America\" during pre-Indy 500 ceremonies at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nJimmy Hoffa, labor union leader\n\nBorn: Brazil,pop: 7,912\n\nJames \"Jimmy\" Hoffa (1913 - nobody knows) was the 20th century's most renowned labor leader (Jack Nicholson played him in a 1992 biopic).

On July 30, 1975, he called his wife from a pay phone outside a Detroit restaurant to tell her the mobsters he was supposed to meet had stood him up. He was never heard from again. His body was never found.\n\nChuck Taylor, shoemaker\n\nBorn: Azalia, pop: unincorporated\n\nCharles Hollis \"Chuck\" Taylor (1901-1969) was an early 20th-century basketball player who went to work for Converse Rubber Shoe Co. as a shoe salesman/basketball consultant.

The new design was a success, and Converse showed its appreciation by adding Taylor's signature to the canvas uppers.\n\nJames Dean, actor\n\nBorn: Fairmount, pop. 2,954\n\nJames Dean (1931-1955) was an actor who remains a worldwide symbol of cool and youthful angst even though he was in just three movies and even though he has been dead since 1955.

In 1961 he became the second American in space. The widely acclaimed 1983 movie \"The Right Stuff\" paints Grissom as a goat responsible for the sinking of his Mercury spacecraft upon touchdown in the sea, but a 2016 book, \"Calculated Risk: The Supersonic Life and Times of Gus Grissom\" (Purdue University Press), exonerates him.
