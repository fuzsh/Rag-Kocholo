        "text": "Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City, geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the western end of Long Island.\n\nQueens is one of the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world, as residents often closely identify with their neighborhood rather than with the borough or city. The borough is a patchwork of dozens of unique neighborhoods, each with its own distinct identity.\n\nMain Industries: Queens has the second-largest and most diversified economy of all the five boroughs of New York City, with evenly spread jobs across the health care, retail trade, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and film and television production sectors.\n\nSmall businesses act as an important part of the borough's economic vitality with two thirds of all business employing between one to four people. Queens is home to two of the three major NYC area airports, JFK International and LaGuardia. Attractions include Flushing Meadows Park—home to the New York Mets baseball team and the US Open tennis tournament—Kaufman Astoria Studios, Silvercup Studios, and Aqueduct Racetrack.\n\nLand: Queens is on the far west section of geographic Long Island and includes a few smaller islands, most of which are in Jamaica Bay. The Rockaway Peninsula, the most southernly part of all of Long Island, sits between Jamaica Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, featuring the most prominent public beaches in Queens.\n\nEducation: Queens has a variety of higher educational institutions such as, St. John's University, Queens College in the CUNY system, LaGuardia Community College in the CUNY system, York College in the CUNY system, and the Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology, among others."
