        "text": "New York City has many nicknames, but its most popular one is \"The Big Apple.\"\n\nSome other nicknames NYC has are \"The City That Never Sleeps,\" \"Empire City,\" \"Gotham\" and \"The City So Nice They Named It Twice.\"\n\nNow what exactly does \"The Big Apple\" mean, and how did it come about?\n\nThe nickname \"The Big Apple\" originated in the 1920s, referring to the prizes -- known as \"big apples\" – awarded at numerous racing courses in and around New York City, according to the New York Public Library.\n\nHowever, it wasn't formally adopted as the city's nickname until the 1970s, following a successful advertising campaign aimed at attracting tourists.\n\nAccording to American etymologist Barry Popik, ad executive Bill Phillips devised a campaign centered around the idea that \"you have to be a little crazy to live in New York.\" These ads were printed on subways, buses and newspapers with the NYC skyline shown on an apple.\n\nWhat was NYC called before \"The Big Apple\"?\n\nBefore the city was called \"The Big Apple\" – and even before it was called New York City – the area was known as \"New Amsterdam.\"\n\nIt was named after Holland's largest city by Dutch settlers in 1624.\n\nNew Amsterdam was the capital of New Netherland, where the Dutch were very involved with the fur trade.\n\nTake a look at the map of \"New Amsterdam\" back in 1664:\n\nIn 1664, the English took over New Amsterdam and renamed it New York after the Duke of York.\n\nHow did NYC become \"The Big Apple\"?\n\n\"The Big Apple\" was popularized by a sportswriter for the New York Morning Telegraph, John J. Fitz Gerald, in the 1920s, according to the NYPL. In his column, he wrote that the NYC horse racing circuit was \"the big apples\" of competitive racing in the United States.\n\nStill, he didn't come up with the term. While on assignment in New Orleans, Fitz Gerald overheard African American stablehands refer to New York City racecourses as \"The Big Apple.\"\n\nFitz Gerald loved the term so much that he named his racing column \"Around The Big Apple.\"\n\nWhile Fitz Gerald's articles had a comparatively smaller audience, the notion of the \"big apple\" symbolizing the epitome of the most coveted rewards and achievements gained popularity nationwide.\n\nIn recognition of Fitz Gerald, the corner of 54th and Broadway (where Fitz Gerald lived for 30 years), was renamed \"Big Apple Corner\" in 1997, according to Popik.\n\nEntering the \"Jazz Age\"\n\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s, the nickname gained recognition outside the Northeast, as jazz musicians in New York City began affectionately referring to the metropolis as the \"Big Apple\" in their musical compositions, according to Popik's research.\n\nIn 1934 in Harlem, a nightclub called \"Big Apple\" opened at the northwest corner of West 135th Street and Seventh Avenue.\n\nThen in 1937, a \"Big Apple\" dance craze swept Harlem and the rest of the nation off their feet, making the \"Big Apple\" nickname rise in popularity.\n\nA prevailing saying in show business emphasized that while there might be many apples on the tree, there was only one Big Apple, underscoring New York City's status as the premier venue for jazz performances.\n\n\"The Big Apple\" campaign\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, New York City gained a reputation as a dark and perilous place. To boost tourism in 1971, the city initiated a campaign led by Charles Gillett, president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, according to the New York Times.\n\nBeing a jazz enthusiast, Gillett aimed to revive the city's former glory by officially adopting the moniker \"Big Apple\" for New York City.\n\nThe campaign, with help from Phillips, showcased red apples to attract visitors, intending to present a vibrant and cheerful image in contrast to the prevailing perception of the city as plagued by crime and poverty.\n\nThe promotion of the \"Big Apple\" through T-shirts, pins and stickers gained popularity quickly, with the help of celebrities such as New York Knicks legend Dave DeBusschere, the Times reported.\n\nConsequently, the city enthusiastically invited tourists to \"take a bite out of the Big Apple.\"\n\n\"The Big Apple\" nickname used today\n\nIn 1997, the Big Apple Circus was founded.\n\nThe New York Mets have a \"Home Run Apple\" that rises every time a player hits a home run."
