Hi,

I was searching on boats being used in antique history by merchant (more specifically for wine and olive oil transportation).

I came across the Olkades, which seems to be also called Olkas.

1- I would like to know if Olkas and Olkades are interchangeable names for the same boat type.

2- I would be interested in knowing more boat types used by merchants in antique history.

thanks,

For antique maritime information, the best general info is from the late Lionel Casson:

Obit here:

Lionel Casson, Who Wrote of Ancient Maritime History, Dies at 94 - The New York Times

His maritime books such as The Ancient Mariners are probably best popular reference. Unfortunately, none of them are easily accessible in Kindle/electronic formats.

As to question about ancient ships, what part of 'antiquity' are you looking for info? Bodrum wreck you allude to in your post is good thousand years before triremes. Things changed a lot between Late Bronze Age and then, to say nothing of Roman Empire times half a millennia after the triremes 'epoch.'

I'm not really found on a specific period, but more on ships that were used for wine and olive oil transportation. I could only find reference to Olkas/Olkades used by the Greeks, and Rabelos used in Portugal.

Not really interested in warships, but really merchant ships.
