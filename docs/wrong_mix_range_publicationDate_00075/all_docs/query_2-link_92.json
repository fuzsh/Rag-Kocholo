Any sentence punctuation goes after the closing parenthesis.\n\nAccording to Brown (2019), \"Direct quote\" (p. 1021).\n\nBrown (2019) found that \"Direct quote\" (p. 1021).\n\n[Some other introduction] \"Direct quote\" (Brown, 2019, p. 1021).\n\nIf you're directly quoting more than 40 words, use a blockquote. Block quotes don't need quotation marks. Instead, indent the text 1/2\" as a visual cue that you are citing. The in-text citation in parentheses goes after the punctuation of the quote.\n\nShavers (2007) study found the following:\n\nWhile research studies have established that socioeconomic status influences disease incidence, severity and access to healthcare, there has been relatively less study of the specific manner in which low SES influences receipt of quality care and consequent morbidity and mortality among patients with similar disease characteristics, particularly among those who have gained access to the healthcare system.
