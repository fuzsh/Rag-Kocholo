(Does exactly what it says on the tin.. people who mine crystal by singing at it. It's a pretty interesting universe. Often some kind of political drama going down wherever the singers are, when they venture offworld.) 978-0345327864 Anne McCaffrey ship who sang Dracomax 978-0345334312 Anne McCaffrey tower and the Hive Dracomax 978-0441007202 Anne McCaffrey Petaybee series SBN 978-0345387790 Ayn Rand charlie_grumbles the anti Le Guin, I guess. She has caused a lot of trouble in the world, actually. Selfishness as a virtue. Sort of the anti-Christ kind of thing. Brandon Sanderson Earthling on Mars I haven't read Mistborn, but have heard good things about it; I'm in the middle of reading Warbreaker (since that one is available to download for free on his website) and it's good. (I would have finished it by now, but was interrupted by a certain webcomic that was posted back in March.) \" Brian Aldiss The Helliconia Series charlie_grumbles Not entirely unrelated to some things said here (OTT) already. 978-1617567636 C J Cherry The Chanur series Angua 978-0886779306 C J Cherryh Foreigner series CasCat 978-0756402518 C J Cherryh charlie_grumbles Nearly anything by C. J. Cherryh. She does both fantasy and scifi, but doesn't herself think there is a difference. Her TrueName is Cherry, but her publisher made her change it, thinking no one would take her seriously. Take her seriously. I found Gate of Iverel (Morgaine Series) to be wonderful. C J Cherryh Foreigner series Prosthetic_Lips C J Cherryh's Foreigner series was a mixed bag for me -- the action was ok, but the intrigue / backstabbing / posturing was way more interesting than it has been in other books that tried to add \"\"court intrigue. 978-0756402518 C J Cherryh ttscp Anything by Cherryh C. S. Forester Captain Horatio Hornblower. charlie_grumbles One of my favorite series as a kid. Hornblower rises through the ranks during the Napoleonic wars. 978-0316289320 C.S. Friedman Coldfire Trilogy Valarya 978-0756403140 C.S. Friedman Magister Trilogy Valarya 978-0756404635 Chris Bunch and Allan Cole The Sten Chronicles charlie_grumbles Military scify and a lot of fun. They will also help you work on perfecting your brogue. The Sten Chronicles are a series of eight military science fiction novels by Chris Bunch and Allan Cole published from 1982 to 1993. 978-1841490076 Connie Willis To Say Nothing of the Dog b2bomberkrh 978-0553575385 Dan Simmons Hyperion charlie_grumbles 978-0553283686 Daniel O'Malley The Rook Arky I liked it very much and it has that sci-fi fantasy crossover feel that Pern does (although with more humour) 978-0316098809 David Brin Startide Rising b2bomberkrh (there isn't much by him that I wouldn't recommend) 978-0553274189 David Eddings The Belgariad Ebonite my favorite book series of all time. Fantasy series about a young boy growing up on a farm who discovers he and his aunt are actually a lot more important to the world than he thought. The books have a kind of \"\"Lord of the Rings\"\" feel to them in the sense where a group of people (of multiple \"\"D&D classes\"\") gradually assembles along the way to saving the world - but the books are lighter in tone and an easier read than LOTR. There are also 3-4 additional books (like LOTR's \"\"Silmarillion\"\") that tell additional background history when you're done. 978-0345456328 David Eddings The Malloreon Ebonite 978-0345483867 David Gerrold and Larry Niven Flying Sorcerers BlueCrab http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flying_Sorcerers 0-345-02331-5 David Weber Safehold series Eternal Density Robot copy of long dead space Marine fights to drag the last remaining human colony out of a religous barbarism that has forced stagnation at rennaisance level or lower technology. I've read the first two Safehold books so far (well, listened to the audiobooks) and I enjoyed them a lot. Really interesting genre cross! (I also very much like Weber's Honorverse in general) 978-0765353979 Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide charlie_grumbles 978-0330443616 Douglas R. Hofstadter Le Ton beau de Marot Angelastic 978-0465086450 Douglas R. Hofstadter G√∂del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid ChronosDragon 978-0465026562 Frank Herbert Dune charlie_grumbles Dune (first couple of volumes anyway) by Herbert. When it gets boring, quit. It will get worse. For me it was an exponential fall-off. The first chapter better than the average of the first book. The first book better than anything that followed, etc. But it starts out HUGE. 978-0441172719 Fred Saberhagen Berserker Series charlie_grumbles pace opera against the AI killer ships out to destroy all life. Great stuff. 978-0671878849 Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez One Hundred Years of Solitude charlie_grumbles 978-0061120091 Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez Love in the Time of Cholera charlie_grumbles 978-0307389732 Garth Nix Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen cari.j.elliot Easy but engaging 978-0060734190 Gene Wolfe The Knight Wizard pair charlie_grumbles In either order, but both. I started with The Knight, which was the first to be published. 978-0765347015 Gene Wolfe The Torturer series charlie_grumbles 978-0671463984 Gene Wolfe The Long Sun charlie_grumbles 978-0312872915 Gene Wolfe the Short Sun series charlie_grumbles 978-0312872571 George Orwell 1984 charlie_grumbles I wrote a college paper once comparing these two. The original paper got an A. The follow up, an F. Go figure. I worked harder on the second, but lost insight. 978-0452262935 George R. R. Martin A song of Ice and Fire series Valarya (Game of Thrones) 978-0345529053 The Great Courses Understanding the Fundamentals of Music Angelastic It was actually the audio version of this course, which seems like the kind of thing you see advertised in Readers Digest that looks like a scam (and I suspect the list price is only there so people will think they're getting a good deal when it's on sale), but I found it quite useful at pulling my musical knowledge from kilometres below sea level to a shrinking island halfway to zero. The guy teaching the course is hilariously emphaticùÑá. I found that half the entertainment of the course was just this guy being so dramatic about everything, but also I learnt quite a lot of things. He doesn't actually mention group theory but by the time he got to the circle of fifths, I understood the words he was using to describe it, and I could see the connection easily. Gregory Benford Great Sky River f0rmicUla 978-0553273182 H. G. Wells Sciscitor Iain M Banks all of them Exodies I presume no one mentioned him because of course everyone's read them. Isaac Asimov Foundation charlie_grumbles Foundation, by Asimov, though it disappointed me. I actually had the opportunity to argue a bit of this with him once. Funny story. I didn't care for the ending of Foundation and Earth (I think it was) and told him why. His wife, who was sitting next to him, turned to him and said, \"\"I told you so!\"\". Made my day. 978-0553293357 Isaac Asimov The Robot Series charlie_grumbles Is AI really life? 978-0553382563 Isaac Asimov Foundation series Valarya 978-0553293357 J. K. Rowling Harry Potter charlie_grumbles 978-0439362139 J. R. R. Tolkien Lord of the Rings charlie_grumbles 978-0544003415 Jack Chalker the Soul Rider series NetWeasel I wanted to toss one recomendation into the mix -- the Soul Rider series by Jack Chalker. There is a HUGE spoiler involved, anyone who knows what it is, please don't tell.... I seem to prefer the stories that when the later revelations come out, you can read/view/listen to the story again with the new info, and it makes it a completely different story. 978-0345324450 Jasper Fforde Nursery Crimes series lmjb1964 Jasper Fforde The Thursday Next series lmjb1964 Jim Butcher The Dresden Files Dracomax Wizard PI takes on threats to Chicago, and eventually the world 978-0451457813 Joe Haldeman FullOfIt His books are mostly rather short and standalone, which is nice since you don't have to invest so much time. He's got nice ideas, and writes quality stuff. John McPhee The Control of Nature charlie_grumbles Rivers do move, sometimes quite far. For the past century or so, the US Army Corps of Engineers (large, partly civil organization) has been trying to prevent the Mississippi River from being captured by the Atchafalaya. HUGE project. If it fails, New Orleans will be left pretty dry along with all of its commerce. The Atchafalaya mouth is about 300 miles west of the current Mississippi delta. John McPhee wrote a story about it. In fact, add McPhee to the list of book/author recommendations. It is all non-fiction, but wonderful stuff, including the geology of large parts of the American West. http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1987/02/23/1987_02_23_039_TNY_CARDS_000347146 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchafalaya_River 978-0374522599 John Scalzi Old Men's War Sciscitor (and most sequels) 978-0765348272 John Scalzi Agent to The Stars Sciscitor 978-0765357007 John Scalzi The Androids Dream Sciscitor 978-0765348289 John Scalzi. Redshirts nerdsniped Fantastic parody/side-track or whatever you want to call it. 978-0765334794 Jonathan Allday Quantum Reality Angelastic 978-1584887034 Jorge Amado charlie_grumbles (historical stuff from Brazil) Jules Vernes Sciscitor Julian May Saga of Pliocene Exile charlie_grumbles Her Saga of Pliocene Exile (Saga of the Exiles in the UK) is very relevant here, of course. People present in 5my bc via one way time travel. 978-0345309891 Julian May Pliocene Exile Saga rvloon also others 978-0345309891 Justina Robson Natural History charlie_grumbles Funny too. 978-0553587418 Karl Schroeder FullOfIt SF unlike most other I've read. His Virga series combines low tech and ridiculously high tech. Katherine Mansfield short stories Exodies\n\nKatherine Mansfield's short stories. Extra chirping ordinary.||\n\nKim Stanley Robinson Mars series charlie_grumbles Mars series (Red, Green, Blue) I didn't read this. 978-0553560732 Kurt Vonnegut charlie_grumbles Anything by Kurt Vonnegut, though not all scifi. I knew his illustrator, in fact. Made most of his covers. Larry Niven Protector nerdsniped if you like Niven, and you haven't read Protector, read Protector. It's one of my favorites by him, and lesser-known I think. 978-0345353122 Larry Niven Ringworld charlie_grumbles Ringworld (Larry Niven) and its sequels (they fall off a bit as it goes on, though). Lots of other stuff by Niven. 978-0345333926 Larry Niven the Man-Kzin wars books charlie_grumbles Larry Niven has been mentioned, of course, but the Man-Kzin wars books are xenophobia at its best. 978-1451639001 Larry Niven Ringworld Prosthetic_Lips 978-0345333926 Larry Niven Integral Trees Prosthetic_Lips 978-0345320650 Leon Harkleroad The Math Behind the Music Angelastic 978-0521009355 Leonie Swann Glennkill Sciscitor 978-0767927055 Leonie Swann Garou Sciscitor 978-3442312245 Lois McMaster Bujold nerdsniped The Miles Vorkosigan stories are awesome sci-fi; start with The Warrior's Apprentice. Her fantasy series are amazing as well. Most similar to the Pern books might be the Sharing Knife series (start with Beguilement), though my favorites are the series that begins with The Curse of Chalion. (And add my vote to the Diskworld series; it is simply essential. The first few books in the series are a bit rough so you might want to start somewhere around Guards! Guards! if you're not a completist, or at least book 3 Equal Rites.) Lois McMaster Bujold rvloon Lois McMaster Bujold the Vorkosigan series Tatiana Start with Cordelia's Honor and go from there. They're already grouped in omnibus editions so you get 2 or 3 novels for the price of one. All of them are excellent stand-alone books, so you can read just one, or several, or all of them. I think there are 12 or 15 by now, aren't there (combined into about five omnibus editions)? These are often laugh out loud funny as well as full of action and interest. Very page-turnery.I thought the first two about the parents were the best of the bunch. They are together in one volume called \"\"Cordelia's Honor\"\". After that, the others are meant to go in any order at all, but I think the next ones to read would be \"\"Young Miles\"\" which has 3 novels combined, then \"\"Miles Errant\"\". Next \"\"Miles, Mystery and Mayhem\"\" and \"\"Miles, Mutants, and Microbes\"\" either one first, which also have 3 novels or novellas each. Then \"\"Miles in Love\"\" next. That contains one of the funniest novels I've ever read, \"\"A Civil Campaign\"\". Then after that it's just snapping up the leftovers that aren't yet combined into an omnibus volume yet. \"\"Memory\"\", \"\"Cryoburn\"\", and the latest which is called \"\"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\"\" starring not Miles but his cousin Ivan, who is taken more seriously in this one. Up to then he'd mostly been comic relief. This is from memory so I really ought to check it. Miles' stories are kind of fluffy and silly compared to his parents, I think, but the more I read Bujold the more I like her. 978-0671720872 Margaret Atwood charlie_grumbles Margaret Atwood has some chilling fantasy. Marion Zimmer Bradley charlie_grumbles Marion Zimmer Bradley has written a lot of fantasy (Darkover...) and some scifi. My wife likes it a lot. Naomi Novik novels of Temeraire ChronosDragon http://www.temeraire.org - it's a series set in an alternate-history Napoleonic wars where one of the main forces in addition to the navy and army is the draconic air force - it's a really interesting read, both from a fantasy perspective and a historical fiction perspective, I've really been enjoying it (the series isn't done - apparently there's two more books to come, one of which is out this...August, I believe). 978-0345513540 Neil Gaiman Neverwhere cari.j.elliot Just awesome 978-0060557812 Neil Gaiman charlie_grumbles Anything by Neil Gaiman Octavia Butler Fledgling Tatiana her take on vampires, and was meant to be the first of a series. Alas, she died before she could write more of them. 978-0446696166 Octavia Butler Patternist Series Tatiana The Patternist Series which is also in one book now. The first of these, Wild Seed, should win a Nobel Prize or something. It's that good. She's amazing. 978-0446676977 Octavia Butler Xenogenesis series Tatiana I love her Xenogenesis series which is published together in one book as \"\"Lilith's Brood\"\". It's wonderful and I've read it several times. 978-0446603775 Orson Scott Card Ender's Game charlie_grumbles Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card. Note that there is a boycott on Card's work due to some of his extremest statements about LGBT folk. Entirely too much of that going 'round. I prefer not to give him money, but your local library already has. His views don't show through much in these books. (I don't remember that they did at all, actually). Le Guin's views show through clearly, but they are better views. The reason I suggested the early stuff is that she gets a bit strident and less subtle as time goes on. The views are still good (in my view), but the books less interesting. 978-0812550702 Orson Scott Card Ender's Game Prosthetic_Lips 978-0812550702 Orson Scott Card the Ender's Game series taixzo 978-0812550702 Orson Scott Card Ender's Game Valarya 978-0812550702 Patricia Briggs The Mercy Thomson series Eternal Density Seatlle based mechanic deals with being part of the supernatural world 978-0441013814 Patrick Rothfuss A Wise Man's Fear b2bomberkrh The series isn't complete yet, but it's the best ongoing work of fantasy hands down, in my opinion. 978-0756407919 Patrick Rothfuss In the Name of the Wind b2bomberkrh 978-0756404741 Patrick Rothfuss The Kingkiller Chronicles Valarya (Name of the Wind) 978-0756404741 Peter F.

Hamilton The Neutronium Alchemist Sciscitor 978-0316021814 Peter F. Hamilton The Naked God Sciscitor 978-0446608978 Piers Anthony The Apprentice Adept Ebonite Fantasy/SF series about a man who discovers there are two worlds that occupy the same space - one based in science, one based in fantasy - and he alone can cross over between the two. In the \"\"science\"\" world, he is an insignificant worker who excels in playing a very interesting game; in the \"\"fantasy\"\" world, he is a very powerful wizard. 978-0345354914 Piers Anthony Xanth Prosthetic_Lips If you like humorous, pun-filled, relatively shallow: Piers Anthony's Xanth series. He's passed a trilogy of trilogies of trilogies (3 ^ 3), and still writing. He writes them in 3's, so when you get tired of the puns, stop reading (much like the recommendation of Frank Herbert's Dune -- I would say read 2 of that series, and see if you want to keep going). 978-0345347534 Raymond E. Feist SBN FullOfIt says: Fantasy about the world of Midkemia. Starts with Magician (also published as two separate books: \"Magician: Apprentice\" and \"Magician: Master\") and continues over lots and lots of books. Skip the ones based on the games. Also read Faerie Tale. Richard Morgan FullOfIt He writes mostly SF, but also some very hard-boiled (and innovative) fantasy. The worlds he creates in his Takeshi Kovacs novels is mindbogglingly detailed. Morgan literally (;)) covers his world with technological and other details making them ridiculously realistic. There's enough throwaway ideas in his books to fill a library. Almost. :) Roald Dahl Ace Robert A. Heinlein Prosthetic_Lips Robin Hobb Realm of the Elderlings Valarya (Farseer Trilogy) 978-0553573398 Roger Zelazny Amber series charlie_grumbles (fantasy) 978-0380809066 Russell Hoban Riddley Walker charlie_grumbles 978-0253212344 Sara Douglass the Axis series Ace Sara Douglass is another to check out. I quite liked the Axis series. There were some quite a few scenes that creeped me the chirp out though, so, be warned. (The Axis trilogy isn't so bad, but maybe I'm just saying that because the second trilogy is even worse.) 978-0765341303 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes Sciscitor 978-0553328257 Susan Cain Quiet ryaaan Delurking to recommend the book Quiet by Susan Cain. Went a long way to persuade me that there's nothing wrong with having an introverted temperament, that being introverted doesn't necessarily mean that you can't also still have confidence in yourself at the same time, and finally that there are often many positive traits that come bundled along with shyness. Recognising some of these traits in myself made me feel much more content with my introversion. It's also a helpful reminder (along with this thread) that there are millions more like us out there. Terry Dowling The Tom Rynosseros series charlie_grumbles Best read in order. They are hard to find, published in Australia. Lots of interleaving threads including AI, desert travel, alternate history... Marvelous. 978-0958658348 Terry Goodkind Legend of the Seeker Prosthetic_Lips\n\nTerry Goodkind wrote 7 books about \"\"Legend of the Seeker\"\" (there was even a TV adaptation that was so-so), kind of \"\"high fantasy\"\" stuff. The middle books gave me the feeling he didn't want the series to end, so he started bringing in other \"\"villains\"\" to continue things, but that is just my opinion.\n\nFullOfIt's opinion: The first couple of books in the Seeker series are ridiculously good, and his climaxes are always engaging, but in later books he channels Ayn Rand too much (with chapter-long speeches) and becomes... Full of it. ;)\n\n978-0812548051 Terry Pratchet Discworld cari.j.elliot Hilarious and usually quick 978-0062225672 Terry Pratchet Discworld charlie_grumbles 978-0062225672 Terry Pratchet Discworld books ttscp Also, although it is not a series, all the books are set in the same universe: the Discworld books by Prachett. 978-0062225672 Tim Etchell The Broken World Exodies The Broken World takes the form of a guide to an imaginary computer game, crossed with a slacker love story. Comical and unsettling, with a gripping narrative and a twisted-Internet linguistic spin, the book interweaves the everyday and the fantastical, the actual and the virtual to create a unique portrait of our lives ‚Äì lived both in the ‚Äòreal world‚Äô and in alternate contexts via the computer screen.Day in and day out, the book‚Äôs narrator is preoccupied with The Broken World ‚Äì an engrossing, genre-hopping and possibly addictive adventure that takes players from town to town as they fight zombies, agents, puzzles, robots and negotiate a veritable maze of puzzles and mysteries. As the walkthrough consumes more and more of the narrator‚Äôs time, his life is slowly coming apart at the seams: the pizza job is starting to get shaky, the best friend is acting weird and, the live-in girlfriend Tory ‚Äì who happens to pay more than half the rent ‚Äì is becoming increasingly restless. Meanwhile, deep in the alternate dimensions of The Broken World, in a landscape of deserts, sprawling cities, space stations and fragmented war zones, things are getting very, very strange indeed. I loved it. Timothy Zahn Conquerors trilogy Arky Book 1 comes across as an interesting \"\"first contact\"\" scenario between a \"\"United Federation of Planets\"\" type of humanity and a hostile alien race. Book 2 brilliantly switches POV to the aliens, one of the best bits of alien world-and-society building exercises I've ever read. Book 3? You'll just have to get there.... 978-0553568929 Timothy Zahn charlie_grumbles writes a lot of Star Wars stuff. Haven't read. Traci Harding Ancient Future Ace I love it for the time travel, but there are many reasons. It does get a bit completely insane in the third book, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 978-0732283742 Ursula K Le Guin The Earthsea Cycle charlie_grumbles Almost anything by Ursula K Le Guin. Especially those from before 2000. For a series: The Earthsea Cycle. Note that pub dates are misleading, since most of her work has been republished. 978-0547773742 Ursula K Le Guin Earthsea series joselynmay 978-0547773742 Ursula K Le Guin Annals of the Western Shore Tatiana The books are Gifts, Voices, Powers. Excellent, wonderful series that I can't say enough good things about. She's my favorite fantasy writer (after Tolkien, of course) because her stuff just feels so realistic. 978-0152051242 Ursula K Le Guin The Left Hand of Darkness Qalyar Regarding UKL, I agree that The Left Hand of Darkness is an important work, and it is definitely something that should be on the reading list of anyone with a passing interest in speculative fiction. Or feminism. Or, frankly, books. On the other hand, I've always struggled quite a bit with The Dispossessed. But my favorite of her works is a short story, even though I don't usually like short stories. \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\" -- if you haven't read it, take the Time and do so. Vernor Vinge Zones of Thought series charlie_grumbles (and others) 978-0812515282 Vernor Vinge A Fire upon the Deep charlie_grumbles 978-0812515282 Vernor Vinge nerdsniped Walter M.
