Even though you have not read the quoted source you must acknowledge the original source of the information, as well as the work in which it appears, in a parenthetical note.\n\nThe name, date and page reference of the work in which information originated should appear first, followed by 'cited' and then the name etc. of the work in which the information was found. Only the work you have read should appear in the reference list at the end of the work.\n\nExamples\n\nCiting unwritten sources quoted in another source\n\nWhen making reference to the spoken words of someone other than the author recorded in a text, cite the name of the person and the name of the author, date and page reference of the work in which the quote or reference appears."
