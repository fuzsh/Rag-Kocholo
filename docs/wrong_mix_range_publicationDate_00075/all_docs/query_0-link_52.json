        "text": "What I'm about to suggest will depend on such things as budget & the size of the library, of course, adrastriae.\n\nAs a starter, though, my advice is 180 degrees different to Danny's. Most libraries put Fantasy & SF together as one subsection - in fact, SF/Horror/Fantasy, because although they are often different, and as Danny says, not everyone likes all, most fans tend to like them. You could subdivide within that into separate shelves should you wish. But, confusingly, there are books that overlap genres: see Space Fantasy, for example, or HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, which combines Horror with SF.\n\nClassics: Depends on how far back you want to go. Frankenstein?\n\nTraditionally in SF the classics come from the 1930's/40's/50's. Try the so-called 'Big Three' - Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke. Ray Bradbury.\n\nFrom the 60's: Alfred Bester, (The Stars My Destination), Frank Herbert's Dune, New Wave authors.\n\nThese days, however, classics can come from anything up to the 1990's - Bear, Brin, LeGuin.\n\nLook at the Hugo & Nebula Award Winners, though there is debate over their importance these days.\n\nThis list might help. It is, however, mainly old books, and as the genre at the time would suggest, male-centred and WASP heavy.\n\nSuggest you look at the re-release of books based on movies/tv. They often generate interest.\n\nThe Yearly collections of short stories are quite a nice way in with what's going on at the moment. For example: https://www.amazon.com/Years-Best-Science-Fiction-Thirty-Third/dp/1250080843\n\nFor more recent books, look at the Awards lists as they appear. There are a lot of them, though! Year lists are often great. I would recommend the Locus Magazine lists as a start.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nIf you haven't already been doing so, the schools are going to be very helpful on this. They assign quite a bit of SF and fantasy in the curriculum and while students are given or buy a lot of the books, you're probably going to want to be stocked with what they need to do papers on.

A good example would be the Vorkosigan series by Bujold, which has won four Hugos. If a library decides to buy a book from such a series, there remains the difficult question of which book to buy. For us private readers, it is sensible to buy the omnibus editions rather than the originally published storis but I do not know if there are any problems in a library buying the omnibus editions. However, which omnibus editions? The two obvious choices are either Cordelia's Honor, which contains Shards of Honor and Barrayar, or Young Miles, which contains The Warrior's Apprentice, The Mountains of Mourning, and The Vor Game. The advantage of Cordelia's Honor is that those are the earliest stories in the time line as Cordelia is Miles’ mother whilst the advantage of Young Miles is that it introduces Miles, who is probably the main character of the series. Barrayar, The Mountains of Mourning, and The Vor Game all won Hugos, which is a further argument for those editions. It would clearly be a very bad idea to chose a book from the series such as Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen simply because it was the most recently published.\n\nA possibly more controversial idea is that it might not be a good idea to buy books which are freely available as epubs, even if they are only available to individuals rather than to libraries. I am not sure how many of the “classics of SF” are now freely available but a quick search for a book before buying might save some money.\n\nYou should really check out the lists by James Wallace Harris. He lists the defining classic science fiction books from the 50s to the 90s. He begins each article with a top ten of the decade and then a top ten year by year.\n\nJust search for James Wallace Harris The Defining Science Fiction Books of the 1950s, and so on...\n\nFor example, for the 60s his top ten (or top twelve, in this case) of the decade list is:\n\nSolaris by Stanislaw Lem (1961)\n\nStranger in a Strange Land by Robert A. Heinlein (1961)\n\nA Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess (1962)\n\nThe Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick (1962)\n\nA Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L’Engle (1963)\n\nDune by Frank Herbert (1965)\n\nFlowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes (1966)\n\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert A. Heinlein (1966)\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick (1968)\n\nStand on Zanzibar by John Brunner (1968)\n\nSlaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (1969)\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin (1969)\n\nThen he has lists by year, some discussion, and his list of personal favorites of the decade."
