        "text": "In general, resources are cited using the author, year of publication, title, source, and additional information depending on the resource type. If you cannot find something like a link, DOI number, volume number, etc. you may omit that information.\n\nSee below for examples for how to cite sources missing pieces of information.\n\nIf you are unsure how to format a citation, contact a librarian.\n\nIf a source does not have an author or editor, use the title as the first part of the citation.\n\nFor both the reference list and in-text citations, use italics for book titles.\n\nThe titles of articles, chapters, and web pages should be in regular font for the reference list but have quotation marks in the in-text citations. Longer titles can be shortened to just a few key words for an in-text citation.\n\nReference Page Format:\n\nTitle. (Year of publication). Format the remainder according to resource type.\n\nReference Page Example:\n\nFAQ. (2022). Camp Bow Wow. https://www.campbowwow.com/about-us/faqs/\n\nIn-text Citation Examples:\n\n...
