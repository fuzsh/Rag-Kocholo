This APA Citation Guide provides the general format for in-text citations and the reference page. For more information, please consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 7th ed.\n\nIn APA style, two citations are used to cite a source:\n\nA short citation used in the text (called the in-text citation).\n\nA full citation (called the reference) in the reference list at the end of a paper.\n\nThe in-text citation is a short citation that is placed next to the text being cited. The in-text citation lets the reader know that the information came from the cited source. The reference list entry provides complete details of a source and is shown at the end of a document.\n\nIn order to properly cite a source in APA style, you must have both citation types in your paper. Every in-text citation has a reference list entry. Every reference list entry has at least one (maybe more) corresponding in-text citation.\n\nIn-text citations\n\nThe basic elements needed for an in-text citation are the author’s surname and the publication year. Sometimes, page numbers are also included, especially when quotes are mentioned in the text. In-text citations are mentioned in the text in two ways: as a narrative citation or a parenthetical citation.\n\nNarrative\n\nNarrative citations are incorporated into the text and act as a part of the sentence. Usually, narrative citations use the author’s name in the text and the publication year is enclosed in parenthesis after the name. An example of a narrative citation for one author is given below:\n\nBarbarin (2013) examined socioemotional learning in African boys.\n\nParenthetical\n\nParenthetical citations add the author’s name and the publication year at the end of the sentence in parenthesis. An example of a parenthetical citation is given below:\n\nInhibition and working memory in young children were studied extensively (Aase, 2014).\n\nWhen are page numbers are included?\n\nPage numbers are referred to within in-text citations when quotes are used. Examples of both narrative citations and parenthetical citations are given below.\n\nNarrative:\n\nAhmed (2004, p. 44)\n\nAhmed (2004, pp. 53–56)\n\nParenthetical:\n\n(Ahmed, 2004, p. 44)\n\n(Ahmed, 2004, pp. 53–56)\n\nExamples of in-text citations\n\nHere are a few examples of in-text citations for a different number of authors:\n\nOne author\n\nUse the surname of the author in in-text citations. Use a comma before the publication year in parenthetical citations.\n\nNarrative:\n\nBucher (2018)\n\nParenthetical:\n\n(Bucher, 2018)\n\nTwo authors\n\nSeparate the author surnames with an “and” in narrative citations. Use an ampersand symbol (&) in parenthetical citations.\n\nNarrative:\n\nPopescu and Pennacchiotti (2010)\n\nParenthetical:\n\n(Popescu & Pennacchiotti, 2010)\n\nThree or more authors\n\nUse the first author surname name followed by et al.\n\nNarrative:\n\nvan Dijck et al. (2018)\n\nParenthetical:\n\n(van Dijck et al., 2018)\n\nGroup author\n\nTreat the group author similar to how you would treat author names.\n\nNarrative:\n\nAuger Collaboration (2003)\n\nParenthetical:\n\n(Auger Collaboration, 2018)\n\nNo author\n\nIf there is no author for the source, use the source title in place of the author’s name. In general, sources with no author appear as parenthetical citations.\n\nWhen you add such in-text citations, you will either italicize the text or place it in quotations. If the source title is italicized in the reference list entry, italicize the title in the in-text citation. If the title is not italicized, place it in quotation marks.\n\nParenthetical, book:\n\n(Nothing here, 1997)\n\nParenthetical, journal article:\n\n(“Examination of parrotfish impact on coral reefs,” 2018)\n\nReference list entries\n\nReference list entries are also called full citations. There are four main details that most reference list entries have:\n\nThe author field.\n\nThe publication year.\n\nThe title of the work (italicized or in “quotation marks”).\n\nThe source from where the reference can be obtained (e.g., URL, DOI, etc.).\n\nDepending on the source type, you will also need additional details like volume number, publication title, contributors, medium, etc.\n\nExamples of reference list entries\n\nBelow are a few examples of different types of reference entries along with their templates. The examples given are for one author. Note that “F” and “M” in the templates denote the first and the middle initials of an author’s name.\n\nBook\n\nThe title of the book is set in italics and sentence case.\n\nTemplate:\n\nAuthor Surname, F.

The journal title and the volume number are set in italics. If an article has a DOI it should always be included. Use “https://doi.org/” before the DOI.
