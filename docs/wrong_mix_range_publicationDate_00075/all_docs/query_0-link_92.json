        "text": "Free books (and other stuff)\n\nBooks! Free to a good home. Let me know if you want any of these.\n\nAlso a couple of Blu-rays, a couple of DVDs, some VHS tapes, and a bunch of games, toys, and other items. (At the end of this post.)\n\nThis list contains a total of about 390 items, as of February 11, 2024.\n\nAlmost all of the books here have spent at least a couple weeks in my Little Free Library, so don’t worry that you would be taking something away from someone else who might want it. These books fill an entire bookcase in my house, so you would be doing me a favor by taking them off my hands.\n\nI edit this page to remove items as they’re claimed and to add new items over time.\n\nIf you prefer, you can view this list as a spreadsheet, but that spreadsheet includes some unredacted NSFW words. It’s also not as nicely formatted as the text version on this page.\n\nProvenance and recommendations\n\nAbout 80% of these books were donated to my Little Free Library; some of the others were my father’s; some are books that Kam is giving away; some are books or other items that I no longer want, or that I have duplicates of.\n\nThe only ones that I can personally recommend (in the sense of saying that I like them) are the few that I’m only giving away because I have a duplicate. I haven’t read (and know nothing about) most of the books on this list; and of the ones that I have read or (more often) skimmed or glanced over in passing, I didn’t like most of them enough to keep them. (But you may love them! Different people have different tastes.)\n\nSo I’m sorry to say that I can’t give recommendations.\n\nBooks\n\nAlphabetical by author’s or editor’s last name (or by relevant magazine title). Separated into groups for ease of scanning.\n\nMMPB means “mass market paperback.” Sf means “speculative fiction”—which is to say, science fiction or fantasy.\n\nMost of the books on the list are in fair to good condition, but some have soot-damaged covers. If you want more info about anything here, just ask.\n\nLinks for speculative fiction books go to ISFDB. Links for other books mostly go to Goodreads or the Doghouse book database. In all cases, the links may not show the same edition or the same cover as the version of the book that I’m giving away.\n\nI’ve included my best guess about genre for on some of these books, but I could be wrong about those. If you’re looking for a particular topic or genre or type of book, like travel or dog or mystery or memoir or nonfiction, try searching in this page.\n\nNote: Some of the book titles listed here are marginally NSFW. I’ve rot-13ed those titles. Some of the content of some of the books is also NSFW, but I haven’t marked those books.\n\nA–B\n\nGabby Duran: Troll Control, by Elise Allen and Daryle Connors (Trade Paperback)\n\nGabby Duran series, #2.\n\nMG fantasy.\n\nFlowers in the Attic, by V.

(Texas Instruments)\n\nBelonged to my father.\n\nimage\n\nCamera, waterproof\n\nMay have had one or two photos taken already.

Not particularly high quality, and not a great solution for digitizing a significant number of photos.\n\nimage 1, image 2\n\nPhoto frame, digital (PanDigital)\n\nWorks fine, but not great resolution.\n\nimage 1, image 2\n\nPin: cat, light-up eyes (Noyce Joyce)\n\nUses a small battery.\n\nimage 1, image 2\n\nPin: VRML 97\n\nimage 1, image 2\n\nPlaying cards: Bicycle/Rider Back\n\nOrdinary 52-card deck, no jokers.

They used to work very well. Probably the batteries stopped taking a charge.\n\nimage\n\nSlide rule (Post)\n\nimage\n\nSmoke alarm (First Alert)\n\nimage\n\nSmoke alarm 2 (First Alert)\n\nimage\n\nSocks: LL Bean, medium\n\nI’ve worn these, but not many times.\n\nimage\n\nSpeaker, portable (JVC)\n\nPlugs into audio jack. 5\"x3\"x1\". Uses two AAA batteries. Not particularly loud, but useful in some situations. Plastic base folds over the front to act as a cover when not in use.\n\nimage 1, image 2\n\nSpeaker: iWoofer (Rain)\n\n~4.5\" diameter, not counting feet/antennae.\n\nimage\n\nSpeakers: car (AudioVox)\n\nimage\n\nSqueezable bee\n\n~3.5\" x 3\" x 2\".\n\nimage\n\nSticker: Foreverspin (Foreverspin)\n\nimage\n\nSticky(?) notes: dangerous to go alone\n\nimage 1, image 2\n\nStud sensor (Zircon)\n\nimage\n\nStylus: Apple Pencil (v1) (Apple)\n\nimage\n\nStylus: Pencil\n\nimage\n\nSurgical masks\n\nimage\n\nThermostat (v1?)
