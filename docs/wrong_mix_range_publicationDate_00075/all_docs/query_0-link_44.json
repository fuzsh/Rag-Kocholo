Today Mr. Beagle stopped by Fantasy Literature to discuss mythology, fantastical realism, and good dark beer.\n\nOne random commenter with a U.S. mailing address will win a signed copy of Summerlong!\n\nJana Nyman: Classic myths, along with their various heroes and gods, seem to be back in vogue right now.\n\nRead More\n\nJana Nyman | Peter S. Beagle | Author Interviews, Giveaway! | 21 comments |\n\nA Fine and Private Place by Peter S. Beagle\n\nPeter S. Beagle is a well-known author of many fantasy novels, including the classic The Last Unicorn. However, I don’t often hear mention of his debut novel, A Fine and Private Place (1960), written when he was only 19 years old. Given his age it’s a phenomenal achievement — the prose is polished, filled with pathos and humor, and the characters’ relationships are deftly described. And yet I couldn’t get into the story at all,\n\nRead More\n\nStuart Starosta´s rating: 3 | Peter S. Beagle | Audio, Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 6 comments |\n\nI See By My Outfit by Peter S. Beagle\n\nPublished in 1965, Peter S. Beagle’s I See By My Outfit is an American motorscooter travelogue. Beagle and his friend, Phil, ride from New York to St. Louis and then head west to San Francisco.\n\nI was often struck by how different the world was in the 1960s. In many ways, the absence of mass media and the Internet makes America seem smaller, like you truly could find people who would wonder about the mysteries of New York City.\n\nRead More\n\nRyan Skardal´s rating: 3.5 | Peter S.

Beagle’s classic The Last Unicorn (1968) turns fifty years old this year, and it’s remained in the public eye and continues to capture hearts like very few fantasies of its age. Like a fine tapestry, this gorgeous fairy tale weaves together unicorns and harpies, wizards and witches, dark-hearted kings and brave heroes. Its lyrical language is embellished with whimsical humor and given heft by bittersweet life lessons.\n\nA shy unicorn keeps to herself in her lilac wood,\n\nRead More\n\nTadiana Jones and Kat Hooper´s rating: 5 | Peter S.

Beagle‘s gorgeous, iconic fantasy The Last Unicorn, he unearthed this long-buried first version of that novel, written one memorable summer in 1962 when twenty-three year old Beagle was renting a cabin in the Berkshires with an artistic friend, Phil, and working on his writing craft. The Last Unicorn: The Lost Journey (2018) starts off nearly identical to the novel,\n\nRead More\n\nTadiana Jones´s rating: 3.5 | Peter S.

Beagle fans, with The Way Home (2023) offering up two novellas set in the same world as The Last Unicorn, and not one but two retrospective collections of stories: The Essential Peter S. Beagle: Volumes I and II. Even better, one of those two novellas is brand new and serves to show that Beagle remains one of our most elegant of fantasists.\n\nRead More\n\nBill Capossere´s rating: 5 | Peter S.

Beagle\n\nThe Innkeeper’s Songis a one-volume fantasy for mature readers that is by turns (or even simultaneously) lyrical and maddening. Lyrical because much of its language is, in contemporary fantasy, on par with only Patricia McKillip and Guy Gavriel Kay. Maddening because — despite the full-throttle beginning, intricately woven characters and a world made wondrous without a map or long descriptions but simply by names and prosaic brushstrokes — the promise of the beginning and middle absolutely fizzles to a all-but-incomprehensible anti-climax in which none of the characters’\n\nRead More\n\nRob Rhodes´s rating: 3 | Peter S.

Beagle\n\nWe Never Talk About My Brother, published by the small but estimable Tachyon Press, is a collection of ten of Peter S. Beagle’s recent stories. Eight were previously published from 2007 through 2009, demonstrating that Beagle has been as productive in his late 60s as he was at the age of 19, when he wrote A Fine and Private Place. Certainly his late work shows a mature intellect and imagination,\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna´s rating: 4.5 | Peter S.

Beagle read, but it certainly won’t be my last. I’ve just put his The Innkeeper’s Song on my TBR list.\n\nReturn is a slim novella (only 104 pages) which tells the story of Soukyan’s return to that place where he was raised and from which he’s been running for years.

Beagle will probably always be best known for The Last Unicorn, the 1968 fantasy novel many consider his masterpiece, but the author has assembled a long and impressive bibliography since this perennial classic, including several excellent short story collections. The most recent of these is Sleight of Hand, recently released by Tachyon. If all you know of Peter S. Beagle is The Last Unicorn,\n\nRead More\n\nStefan Raets´s rating: 4 | Peter S.

I tend to find problems with almost every urban fantasy book I’ve tried to read. When I got this book in the mail, I kind of rolled my eyes and shot it to the top of my “to be read” pile so I could get it over with fast. I didn’t expect to actually enjoy this book.

Beagle\n\nSummerlong is the latest stand-alone work by Peter S. Beagle, an author widely lauded and respected for his skillful turns of phrase, complicated characters, and his ability to credibly blend the fantastic into the mundane. In Summerlong, Beagle turns his gaze on Puget Sound and a small island off Seattle’s coast, an unremarkable little place which undergoes a transformation over the course of just a few months, changing the lives of its residents in profound and irrevocable ways.\n\nRead More\n\nJana Nyman´s rating: 4 | Peter S.

You’ve ascended the literary heights and amassed an adoring following who still expect you never to repeat, and even improve upon your previous genius with each new work.

In “Olfert Dapper’s Day,” Beagle demonstrates that there are still new tales to tell about unicorns if you’re a master of the short fantasy tale. Dr. Olfert Dapper was a seventeenth century conman who wrote books about the strange creatures to be found all over the world, even though he never left Holland – that is, the actual historical figure never left Holland.\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | C.S.

Anderson (Dec. 2016, free at Strange Horizons)\n\n“Das Steingeschöpf,” or the “Stone Creation (or Creature),” is set in Europe in 1928, where the aftermath of WWI mingles with foreshadowings of the Holocaust. A young German, Herr Hertzel, tells of his trip from Berlin to Bavaria, on his first assignment as a journeyman to repair a living,\n\nRead More\n\nTadiana Jones and Skye Walker | Alix E. Harrow, Peter S. Beagle | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 4 comments |\n\nToday’s SHORTS column features all of the 2018 Locus Award finalists for short fiction. The Locus Award winners will be announced by Connie Willis during Locus Award weekend, June 22 – June 24, 2018.\n\nNOVELLAS:\n\nIn Calabria by Peter S. Beagle (2017)\n\nClaudio, a middle-aged curmudgeonly farmer living in a remote area of the Italian countryside, has been a standoffish loner since his wife left him decades ago. He’s satisfied with his current lifestyle,\n\nRead More\n\nKat Hooper, Skye Walker, Taya Okerlund, Terry Weyna, Bill Capossere, Nathan Okerlund, Tadiana Jones and Katie Burton | Charlie Jane Anders, Elizabeth Hand, JY Yang, Kai Ashante Wilson, Karen Joy Fowler, Ken Liu, Michael Swanwick, Nancy Kress, Peter S.

Their annual collections of the Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror provided us, for 16 straight years, with the best short genre and slipstream fiction from all sources. Their anthologies have defined cutting edge fantasy.\n\nSalon Fantastique is more uneven than most of Datlow and Windling’s collections.\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna´s rating: 3.5 | Catherynne M. Valente, Christopher Barzak, Delia Sherman, Ellen Datlow, Gregory Maguire, Jeffrey Ford, Peter S. Beagle, Terri Windling | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nThe Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year Volume One edited by Jonathan Strahan\n\nMy first and foremost complaint — and this is really a quibble more than anything else — is that the title doesn’t tell you what year this anthology belongs to. Which isn’t really a problem if you bought it recently but in case you find in the bookstore bin several years down the line, it’s nice to know what era this collection represents (in case you don’t know the answer, the book was printed in 2007). With that out of the way,\n\nRead More\n\nCharles Tan (GUEST)´s rating: 4 | Connie Willis, Ian McDonald, Jeffrey Ford, Jonathan Strahan, Peter S. Beagle | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nThe Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year Volume Two edited by Jonathan Strahan\n\nThe Year’s Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year Volume Two is one of several anthologies that collects the best science fiction and fantasy of 2007. I’ve read many of the stories included, yet revisiting them actually made me appreciate them more rather than feel exhausted. One thing I noticed is that there’s a stronger science fiction balance in this anthology compared to the previous volume, although that might also be because the lines between science fiction and fantasy easily get blurry.\n\nRead More\n\nCharles Tan (GUEST)´s rating: 4 | Daniel Abraham, Jeffrey Ford, Jonathan Strahan, Neil Gaiman, Peter S. Beagle, Ted Chiang | Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nThe Very Best of Fantasy & Science Fiction: Sixtieth Anniversary Anthology by Gordon Van Gelder (ed.)\n\nThe Very Best of Fantasy & Science Fiction: Sixtieth Anniversary Anthology is an excellent collection of 23 stories picked from the treasure trove of short fiction that’s been published in the eponymous magazine over the past 60 years. Editor Gordon Van Gelder — also the editor of the magazine since 1997 — has done an admirable job, picking stories that illustrate the diversity of both the genre and the magazine.\n\nRead More\n\nStefan Raets´s rating: 4.5 | Harlan Ellison, Jeffrey Ford, John Kessel, Michael Swanwick, Neil Gaiman, Peter S. Beagle, Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Roger Zelazny, Stephen King, Ursula K. Le-Guin | Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nTroll’s Eye View: A Book of Villainous Tales edited by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling\n\nFairy tales were my first love when I was a child. My mother introduced me to the joys of stories with The Golden Book of Fairy Tales long before I learned how to read. My early reading included the first three volumes of The Junior Classics and Andrew Lang’s colorful fairy tale books. When Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling started editing anthologies of new takes on the old tales for adults with Snow White,\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna´s rating: 4 | Catherynne M.

Tolkien and Stephen Donaldson on one end and (for want of a better term) the magical realism of Gabriel García Marquez and Graham Joyce on the other, the twenty stories in the excellent Real Unreal: Best American Fantasy 3 fall, for the most part, close to or smack on the latter extreme of the scale.\n\nRead More\n\nStefan Raets´s rating: 4.5 | John Kessel, Kevin Brockmeier, Lisa Goldstein, Peter S. Beagle | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nWarriors edited by George R.R. Martin & Gardner Dozois\n\nFORMAT/INFO: Warriors is 736 pages long divided over twenty short stories and an Introduction by George R.R. Martin. Each short story is preceded by biographical information about the author and a short description of their contribution to the anthology. March 16, 2010 marks the North American Hardcover publication of Warriors via Tor.\n\nANALYSIS:\n\n“The King of Norway” by Cecelia Holland.\n\nRead More\n\nRobert Thompson and Greg Hersom´s rating: 4.5 | Carrie Vaughn, Cecelia Holland, David Weber, Diana Gabaldon, Gardner Dozois, George R.R.

Stirling, Tad Williams | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 7 comments |\n\nWings of Fire edited by Jonathan Strahan & Marianne S. Jablon\n\nI don’t like dragons.\n\nThis is probably not the first sentence you’d expect to find in a review of Wings of Fire, an anthology devoted exclusively to dragon stories, but I thought it best to get it out of the way right from the start.\n\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with dragons. They’re just terribly overused, one of those tired genre mainstays that people who typically don’t read a lot of fantasy will expect in a fantasy novel because they were practically unavoidable for a long time.\n\nRead More\n\nStefan Raets´s rating: 4 | Anne McCaffrey, C.J. Cherryh, Charles De_Lint, Elizabeth Bear, George R.R. Martin, Holly Black, James P.

Martin and Gardner Dozois have edited together. Like Warriors and Songs of the Dying Earth, Songs of Love and Death brings together some of the biggest names that SFF has to offer and they set these authors to work on a common theme.\n\nMartin and Dozois offer a cross-genre anthology that ranges from Robin Hobb’s epic fantasy “Blue Boots,” which tells the story of a romance between a young serving girl and a silver-tongued minstrel,\n\nRead More\n\nRyan Skardal and Kat Hooper | Carrie Vaughn, Diana Gabaldon, Gardner Dozois, George R.R. Martin, Jacqueline Carey, Jim Butcher, Linnea Sinclair, Lisa Tuttle, M.L.N. Hanover, Marjorie M. Liu, Mary Jo Putney, Melinda Snodgrass, Neil Gaiman, Peter S. Beagle, Robin Hobb, Tanith Lee, Yasmine Galenorn | Audio, Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 6 comments |\n\nThe Secret History of Fantasy edited by Peter S. Beagle\n\nThe basic premise of the SECRET HISTORY anthologies (there’s also a science fiction one, The Secret History of Science Fiction, which I haven’t read) is that there’s a type of writing that got missed or buried because other things were more popular, more commercial, or dodged the spec-fic labeling. Certainly that’s the thrust of Peter S. Beagle‘s introduction, and the two other non-fiction pieces by Ursula K. Le Guin and editor David G.\n\nRead More\n\nMike Reeves-McMillan´s rating: 4 | Francesca Lia Block, Gregory Maguire, Jeffrey Ford, Jonathan Lethem, Kij Johnson, Maureen McHugh, Michael Swanwick, Neil Gaiman, Patricia McKillip, Peter S. Beagle, Robert Holdstock, Stephen King, Susanna Clarke, Terry Bisson, Ursula K. Le-Guin | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 3 comments |\n\nThe New Voices of Fantasy edited by Peter Beagle\n\nThis collection of nineteen fantasy short works, edited by Peter Beagle, is definitely worthwhile if you like speculative short fiction. Many of them left an impact on me, and a few are true standouts. These stories are by relatively new authors in the speculative fiction genre and are all fantasy; otherwise there’s no discernable overarching theme.\n\nThese stories have almost all been published previously over the last seven years, and several of them are Hugo or Nebula winners or nominees.\n\nRead More\n\nTadiana Jones, Jana Nyman and Skye Walker´s rating: 4 | A.C.
