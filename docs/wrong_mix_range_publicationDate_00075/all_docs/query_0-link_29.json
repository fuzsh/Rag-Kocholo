        "text": "By 1980, science fiction was no longer the “niche” genre admired by “outcasts” and “dreamers”. With the success of films like Star Wars and Superman and the rise of Star Trek conventions, science fiction became mainstream. What also was once rare but now flourishing, was an abundance of women writers – many of whom were injecting more themes into their work: multiculturalism and homosexuality to name a few. Others were mixing their sci-fi with other genres: fantasy, romance and horror, while some attached themselves to the burgeoning cyberpunk genre and when cyberpunk evolved into steam and dieselpunk, women partook in those genres too.\n\nSome worried that the “mainstreaming” of science fiction would distance itself further and further from it’s scientific origins. Whether this is true or not, no one can deny the diverse female voices of this era. While some of these women started their writing careers in the ’70s writing short stories, their big breaks came in the ’80s and ’90s.\n\nAnd then some…\n\nMargaret Atwood\n\nThanks to Hulu’s successful adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s seminal 1985 dystopia, The Handmaid’s Tale, Atwood has been hailed by TIME as “a reluctant prophet” (Ha!). Her futuristic vision of a theocratic United States where women have been stripped of their rights is her most famous SF (though she claims it’s more “dystopian”) novel. Her other SF novel, Oryx and Crake (2003), is a peculiar post-apocalyptic novel.\n\nJoan D. Vinge\n\nAt one time married to fellow author Vernor Vinge, Joan won the Hugo for her 1980 novel, The Snow Queen, a planetary romance take on Hans Christian Anderson’s fairy tale of the same name. It was followed up by three sequels: World’s End (1984), The Summer Queen (1991) and Tangled Up in Blue (2000). Vinge has also written many movie tie-in novels from the Star Wars: Return of the Jedi Storybook (1983) to Cowboys and Aliens (2011).\n\nPat Cadigan\n\nBecause Cadigan’s work explores the relationship between the human mind and technology, she’s often associated with the cyberpunk movement. Her first novel, Mindplayers (1987), was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award. Her second novel, Synners (1991), was awarded the Arthur C. Clarke Award and is considered one of the seminal novels of the cyberpunk genre. Tea From An Empty Cup (1998) is a post-apocalyptic noir detective novel set in a country popular to cyberpunks – Japan.\n\nLisa Tuttle\n\nHer first novel, a planetary romance called Windhaven (1981), won the Locus Award. Her other novel, Lost Futures (1992) – a story about a woman thrust into several alternate histories – was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke and James Tiptree Jr. Awards. In 1982 Tuttle refused to accept the Nebula Award for her story, “The Bone Flute” because she objected to another author sending his story to the SFWA for consideration. Although this is normal now, at the time it was unheard of and Tuttle didn’t show up at the awards ceremony to receive her award. However someone else went in her place and accepted it for her.\n\nJoan Slonczewski\n\nOur next entry is not only an SF author but a microbiologist! Her work in the field of microscopic lifeforms has informed her work, which often deals with this very subject. Her most well known novel, A Door Into Ocean (1986), is about a group of pacifist women who inhabit a planet that’s all water. The Wall Around Eden (1989) is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth, where a restless young woman yearns to learn more about the aliens that have taken over her planet…\n\nShe also came up with the concept of mitochondrial singularity, the idea that humans are gradually becoming the “mitochondria of our own machines”.\n\nLois McMaster Bujold\n\nA multiple award winner, Bujold’s most well known works is the Vorkosigan Saga (1986 – present), which comprises of 16 military SF novels centered on the protagonist Miles Vorkosigan and his life in the Barrayaran Navy. More info on the series can be found here.\n\nConnie Willis\n\nHer short stories include “The Last of the Winnebagos”(1988) and “At the Rialto”(1989). “Even the Queen” (1992), a humorous take on menstruation, won the Hugo and Nebula. Her novels: Lincoln’s Dreams (1987) combines dreams, parapsychology and the Civil War and won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best SF novel. Doomsday Book (1992), winner of the Nebula and Hugo, is about time travel in fourteenth century England. To Say Nothing of the Dog (1997) is also about time travel, albeit of a more comic nature.\n\nLinda Nagata\n\nHailed from Hawaii, Nagata often writes in the Nanopunk subgenre (where nanotechnology is the dominant technological force in society) with the Nanotech Succession series (1995 – present). Her novella, Goddesses, was the first online publication to win a Nebula Award.\n\nPat Murphy\n\nWith Karen Joy Fowler, Murphy created the James Tiptree Jr. Award, an annual literary prize given to works of SF and Fantasy that explored the topic of gender. She won the Nebula Award for “Rachel in Love”, a 1987 novelette about a chimpanzee who possesses the memories of a teenage girl. Her 1989 post apocalyptic novel, The City, Not Long After, was inspired by her work at the San Francisco Exploratorium.\n\nShe is a member of The Brazen Hussies.\n\nKaren Joy Fowler\n\nAlthough she’s most famous for the non-SF best-selling novel, The Jane Austen Book Club, her career has mostly been in science fiction. Her first story, “Recalling Cinderella” was included in the anthology, L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Vol. 1 (1985). Her first novel, 1991’s Sarah Canary, takes place in the 19th century, where a group of people experience a “first contact”. Among the group is the titular heroine, an extraterrestrial. Her other short story, “Game Night at the Fox and Goose” (1989) discusses alternate history. As I stated above, she co-founded The James Tiptree Jr. Award.\n\nLisa Goldstein\n\nPart of the “Brazen Hussies” (see above), Goldstein is the first entry in our series to win the Sidewise Award, which recognizes work in the Alternate History subgenre, for her 2011 short story “Paradise is a Walled Garden”. In her 1990 story “Midnight News”, aliens choose an old woman to decide the fate of humanity.\n\nMary Gentle\n\nMore renowned for writing fantasy/Alternate History than sci-fi, Gentle’s most notable SF work (which learns more toward science fantasy) is the Orthe duology: Golden Witchbreed (1983) & Ancient Light (1987), in which a British envoy named Lynne de Lisle Christie visits the planet Orthe and learns about it’s inhabitants and their history.\n\nJayge Carr\n\nThe pen name of Margery Ruth Morgenstern Kruegey, her most well-known novel is Leviathan’s Deep (1979), in which humanoid female aliens from a matriarchal society meet a group of patriarchal Terrans. She contributed the story “The War of ’07” – where Hamilton’s assassin Aaron Burr becomes president of the United States – to the anthology Alternate Presidents (1992).\n\nRosaleen Love\n\nAn Australian writer who wrote the humorous 1986 alternate history story “Alexia and Graham Bell”, “Evolution Annie” (1991) and her 2006 award-winning kaiju story “Once Giants Roamed The Earth” (from the anthology Daikaiju! Giant Monster Tales). She is the recipient of the Chandler Award for “Outstanding Achievement in Australian Science Fiction”.\n\nShe has also written non-fiction books about the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nSheila Finch\n\nBritish-born author who coined the phrase “xenolinguist” with her 1986 book Triad. Her short story (also published in the same year) “Reichs-Peace” is about – you guessed it – Nazis winning WW2. Her 2005 novel, Birds, is a NASA murder mystery/alien cover-up. No, really.\n\nNancy Kress\n\nShe won the Hugo and Nebula Awards for her 1993 novella Beggars In Spain, which examines genetic engineering, cold fusion and Objectivism. Her 1991 story, “And Wild For To Hold” concerns a time traveling Anne Boleyn. Her 2008 novel, Dogs, is a cross between Stephen King’s Cujo and James Patterson’s Zoo.\n\nRebecca Ore\n\nMs. Ore has received praise for her talent in writing stories from the perspective of aliens – and making them believable in the process. One such example is her 1993 story “Farming in Virginia” and her Becoming Alien Trilogy. Another notable work is the peculiar 1991 novel, The Illegal Rebirth of Billy the Kid, in which a CIA specialist creates a clone of William Bonney.\n\nMaureen F. McHugh\n\nShe’s best known for her two most famous works, both award-winning: China Mountain Zhang (1992), which imagines a future where China rules the world, and the 1995 short story “The Lincoln Train”, an alternate history where former slave owners are sent into exile.\n\nToday, the idea of a woman SF author no longer bats an eye. Some of them have even crossed SF with fantasy or horror. Some of them have published their works in another language and country. Some of them have even become major celebrities. If I was to list every female SF author that ever lived, this series would go on forever and that would be exhausting. So if you’re bothered that your favorite author wasn’t listed here, check out this very extensive list from Worlds Without End. Some the entries may surprise you.\n\nHowever I have two more posts to make: one involving the women who’ve written Star Trek novels and the other involving women who’ve written for the Star Wars Expanded Universe.\n\nStay Tuned.\n\nAs the 1950s morphed into the 1960s, science fiction became more diverse to reflect the changes society was going through. This era, often referred to as “the New Wave”, is a little harder to describe, so I’m using excerpts from Pamela Sargent’s anthology, Women of Wonder: The Classic Years, to help me:\n\nDuring the ’60s, several science fiction writers experimented with both subject matter and style. For them, science fiction had become too predictable and hidebound, and was ripe for change. These writers and others, loosely grouped together under the somewhat misleading term “New Wave”, rejected the elements of pulp fiction and often viewed technology and the future with pessimism.\n\nThe magazine New Worlds in England and Damon Knight’s Orbit series of anthologies and Harlan Ellison’s groundbreaking anthology Dangerous Visions (1967) in the U.S. contained stories in which writers aimed at a more literary and iconoclastic approach to the genre. In this atmosphere of change, women who wrote science fiction were likely to find a more receptive audience even if their stories violated some of the traditional canons.\n\nDuring the 1970s, women in science fiction were no longer isolated examples or exceptions to the rule. There were more of them than ever. More women began to question the roles they played and the limitations on their lives, and science fiction, not surprisingly, reflected this development.\n\nWithin the field of science fiction, women writers were also coming to consider themselves a group. This is not to say that they shared the same views, were equally doctrinaire in their feminism, or were similar in their writing. But there was a growing sense that science fiction was a form in which the issues raised by feminism could be explored, in which writers could look beyond their own culture and create imaginative new possibilities.\n\nThese are some of the women writers who came to prominence in the ’60s and ’70s.\n\nKit Reed\n\nHer real name was Lillian Hyde Craig. The daughter of a schoolteacher and a US Naval officer, her first SF novel, Armed Camps (1969), possibly draws on her “navy brat” background, while her short story, “The Food Farm” (1966), concerns a teenage girl obsessed with food, technology and a pop star.\n\nMarion Zimmer Bradley\n\nWhile more known for her fantasy novel The Mists of Avalon, she’s also known for her Darkover series which chronicles the history of the inhabitants of the planet Cottman IV, commonly referred to as Darkover. Sadly, longtime fans were shocked when they learned that Bradley was sexually abusive to her children and was married to Walter Breen, a sexual predator who preyed on boys. You can read her daughter’s eye-opening account here.\n\nYou may be wondering why I included this monster in my list of SF “queens”. Well, remember, in herstory, there have been good queens, evil queens and queens in between. The purpose of history/herstory is to study and learn from the past. The purpose of this series is to not to promote these women as heroes or role models, but to learn about the contributions they’ve made to science fiction. As for Ms. Moira Greyland (Bradley’s daughter), I’m happy to say, she’s gotten much love and support from the SF fandom for coming forward. I hope she travels to as many SF conventions as possible to meet fans and tell her story, raise awareness about child abuse, and maybe become an SF author in her own right. If she does, I wish her the best.\n\nPauline Ashwell\n\nThe pen name of Pauline Whitby, this British author published her first story when she was only 14 years old (it was called “Invasion From Venus”). Although her first novel, Unwillingly to School, was published in 1958, its protagonist, a feisty young woman named Lysistrata “Lizzie” Lee, had her biggest adventure in its 1960 sequel, The Lost Kafoozalum, where she averts a nuclear holocaust.\n\nKate Wilhelm\n\nMarried to fellow SF pioneer Damon Knight, Wihelm’s best known work are the 1976 novels Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang (about a community of clones living in the Appalachians), The Clewiston Test (about the effect a scientific breakthrough has on a woman’s marriage), and The Infinity Box, a collection of short stories.\n\nRosel George Brown\n\nAmong her most notable works are Galactic Sybil Sue Blue (1966) and its sequel, The Waters of Centaurus, (1970) chronicling the adventures of a tough female cop and her teenage daughter. Her other novel, Earthblood, (1966) tells the story of a boy on a quest to discover his Terran heritage. Sadly in 1967, her life was cut short at the age of 41 when she died from lymphoma.\n\nPhyllis Gotlieb\n\nHer first and most famous novel, Sunburst, (1964) concerns the trials and tribulations of a group of ESP sensitive mutant children. The Sunburst Award is named for this book and is awarded annually to Canadian sci-fi authors.\n\nJoanna Russ\n\nRuss is often credited with being one of the first writers to directly address feminist themes in her work. “When It Changed” (1972), is about an all female society that has to face the eventual reality of male colonialism. The award-winning novel, The Female Man (1975) has four women from four different parallel worlds who meet and discuss the gender roles of their respective societies. Her 1977 novel, We Who Are About to Die, is a deconstruction of the Adam and Eve Plot.\n\nSonya Dorman Hess\n\nShe came to nationwide recognition with the inclusion of her short story “Go, Go, Go, Said the Bird” in the 1967’s Dangerous Visions Anthology. Her other short story “When I Was Miss Dow” looks into a shapeshifter’s relationship with a Terran colonist. In 1995 it was nominated for a Retrospective James Tiptree Jr. Award.\n\nFun fact: Hess bred akitas which is alluded to in “Miss Dow”.\n\nPamela Zoline\n\nThough more of an artist and editor than an SF writer, she took the concept of entropy and applied it to the everyday life of a housewife, in the style of multiple dictionary entries, in her 1967 story, “The Heat Death of the Universe”.\n\nAnne McCaffrey\n\nMcCaffrey is renowned for her worldbuilding. Her Dragonriders of Pern series (23 books in all!) depicts a world where dragons and their human riders share a telepathic link. Her 1961 story “The Ship Who Sang” set up the “Brain and Brawn Ship” series, where those who are physically disabled but mentally competent can donate their minds to run ships. Dinosaur Planet (1978) is just that, a planet full of dinosaurs – and pirates! What more could you want? Well, you could also read Decision At Doona (1967) where human colonists learn to coexist with the feline species of Doona. And last but not least, there’s stories (7 in all) about Acorna the unicorn girl (no she’s not a type of centaur, she’s a unicorn/human hybrid).\n\nUrsula K. LeGuin\n\nNo need for an introduction here. LeGuin shot to fame in 1968 and 1969 with her novels A Wizard of Earthsea and The Left Hand of Darkness, the latter novel famous for its exploration of androgyny, sexuality and gender roles. It’s always ranked as one of the greatest sci-fi works of all time. Her follow up books, The Dispossessed (1974) and The Word for World is Forrest (1976) have won Hugo and Nebula awards.\n\nJames Tiptree Jr.\n\nTiptree, on the right, pictured with her husband, Huntington Sheldon in 1946.\n\nI won’t lie: Tiptree is my favorite woman SF author. The idea that this author was able to fool everyone, from fans to the SF community into thinking that her work was written by a man is genius even to this day. Her real name was Alice Hastings Bradley Sheldon and her first SF story, “Birth of a Salesman” was published in 1968. She took the name “James Tiptree Jr.” because, in her words, “A male name seemed like good camouflage. I had the feeling that a man would slip by less observed. I’ve had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation.” It was also believed that Sheldon was trying to protect her professional reputation as an intelligence community official (Sheldon once worked for the CIA). While her work often addressed feminist themes, her stories were often told from the perspectives of male protagonists: “Houston, Houston, Do You Read?” (1976) follows a group of (male) astronauts who discover a future Earth where men have been wiped out. The (male) protagonist in “The Women Men Don’t See” doesn’t understand why the two women he’s protecting would rather leave with some aliens. “The Screwfly Solution” bounces back and forth between a scientist couple observing a femicide pandemic. All these works can be found in the anthology Her Smoke Rose Up Forever. You can also read more about Tiptree in Julie Phillips biography: James Tiptree Jr.: the Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon. The James Tiptree Jr. Award honoring works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore our understanding of gender, was named in her honor.\n\nC.J. Cherryh\n\nAfter she won the Hugo award for her short story “Cassandra” (1978), Cherryh (the “h” was added at the end because her agent thought it looked more science-fictiony) quit teaching to become a full-time writer and wrote a very intricate series of books that make up the Alliance/Union Universe, which consists of the novel Cyteen, the Faded Sun Trilogy, the Morgaine Cycle and Downbelow Station. Another series of note is the Finisterre Universe, a duology about the bonds human colonists and equine aliens on the planet Finisterre.\n\nFun fact: discovered in March 2001, Asteroid 77185 Cherryh is named in her honor.\n\nOctavia E. Butler\n\nDespite growing up at a time when racism was prevalent, Butler still led a colorful life. Here’s a segment from Wikipedia:\n\nFrom an early age, an almost paralyzing shyness made it difficult for Butler to socialize with other children. Her awkwardness, paired with a slight dyslexia that made schoolwork a torment, an easy target for bullies, and led her to believe that she was “ugly and stupid, clumsy, and socially hopeless”. As a result, she frequently passed the time reading at the Pasadena Central Library. She also wrote reams of pages in her “big pink notebook”. Hooked at first on fairy tales and horse stories, she quickly became interested in science fiction magazines, such as Amazing Stories, Galaxy Science Fiction, and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. She began reading stories by John Brunner, Zenna Henderson, and Theodore Sturgeon.\n\nAt the age of 10, Butler begged her mother to buy her a Remington typewriter, on which she “pecked [her] stories two fingered”. At 12, she watched the televised version of the film Devil Girl from Mars (1954) and concluded that she could write a better story. She drafted what would later become the basis for her Patternist novels. Happily ignorant of the obstacles that a black female writer could encounter, she became unsure of herself for the first time at the age of 13, when her well-intentioned aunt Hazel said: “Honey … Negroes can’t be writers.” But Butler persevered in her desire to publish a story, and even asked her junior high school science teacher, Mr. Pfaff, to type the first manuscript she submitted to a science fiction magazine.\n\nThe Patternist series depicts the transformation of humanity into three genetic groups: the dominant Patternists, humans who have been bred with heightened telepathic powers; their enemies the Clayarks, disease-mutated animal-like superhumans; and the Mutes, ordinary humans bonded to the Patternists. The first book, Patternmaster was published in 1976, the last book, Clay’s Ark was published in 1984. Her “pregnant man” story “Bloodchild” depicts a somewhat symbiotic relationship between a colony of humans and a race of aliens called the Tlic – who use the humans as hosts for their eggs. In 2006 and 2019 two scholarships were established in her memory as well as an asteroid (7052 Octaviabutler) and a mountain on the moon Charon (Butler Mons).\n\nSuzy McKee Charnas\n\nHer first two novels of The Holdfast Chronicles – Walk To The End of the World (1974) and Motherlines (1978) – depict two societies: one where men dominate women and another where women live free and independent of men. Motherlines caused controversy when Ballantine Books refused to publish it (despite publishing her first book) because there were no male characters in the book. It would go on to win the 1996 Retrospective James Tiptree Jr. Award. HA!\n\nNaomi Mitchison\n\nAlthough born in 1897 her first true SF novel wouldn’t get published until she was 65 years old. Memoirs of a Spacewoman (1962) is just that, a series of space “travelogues” depicting the biology and ecology of other planets as written by an astronaut telepath named Mary.\n\nAs the society rolled into the ’80s and ’90s science fiction would undergo some drastic changes. How did the women writers of this movement handle these changes and who were they? Stay tuned for part four.\n\nAlthough I’m part of the mad-at-Disney-for-discontinuing-the-Expanded-Universe fandom, one advantage I’ve had in recent years is that I finally have the chance to read every novel/short story collection/series in the 1978-2014 Star Wars Novel timeline. I even photocopied the timeline so that I could check off each book as I go along. It also helps that I have a copy of The Essential Reader’s Companion by Pablo Hidalgo for EU reference. So far I’ve enjoyed some titles. Others….eh….not so much. As I go through each book, I type down which ones I liked so this list is not your typical “best of EU” list. I also have to split my list at 20 per post because there are *takes deep breath* over 145 full length novels, more than 100 YA novels and over 170 short stories. *Phew!* Today we’ll look at novels that take place before the events of Heir to the Empire. If your mad that your favorite title isn’t listed – well, write your own list. Different strokes for different folks, right?\n\nHere I go.\n\nLost Tribe of the Sith: The Collected Stories (2012)\n\nJohn Jackson Miller\n\nFive thousand years ago. After a Jedi ambush, the Sith mining ship Omen lies wrecked on a remote, unknown planet. Its commander, Yaru Korsin, battles the bloodshed of a mutinous faction led by his own brother. Marooned and facing death, the Sith crew have no choice but to venture into their desolate surroundings. They face any number of brutal challenges—vicious predators, lethal plagues, tribal people who worship vengeful gods—and like true Sith warriors, counter them with the dark side of the Force.\n\nThe struggles are just beginning for the proud, uncompromising Sith, driven as they are to rule at all costs. They will vanquish the primitive natives, and they will find their way back to their true destiny as rulers of the galaxy. But as their legacy grows over thousands of years, the Sith ultimately find themselves tested by the most dangerous threat of all: the enemy within.\n\nOriginally an e-book series that chronicles the arrival of the so-called “Lost Tribe of the Sith” to the planet Kesh 5000 years before the Battle of Yavin (BBY) and the power struggles within the tribe. You may even find some of the sith characters – *gasp* – likeable!\n\nKnight Errant (2011)\n\nJohn Jackson Miller\n\nA thousand years before Luke Skywalker, a generation before Darth Bane, in a galaxy far, far away . . .\n\nThe Republic is in crisis. The Sith roam unchecked, vying with one another to dominate the galaxy. But one lone Jedi, Kerra Holt, is determined to take down the Dark Lords. Her enemies are strange and many: Lord Daiman, who imagines himself the creator of the universe; Lord Odion, who intends to be its destroyer; the curious siblings Quillan and Dromika; the enigmatic Arkadia. So many warring Sith weaving a patchwork of brutality—with only Kerra Holt to defend the innocents caught underfoot.\n\nSensing a sinister pattern in the chaos, Kerra embarks on a journey that will take her into fierce battles against even fiercer enemies. With one against so many, her only chance of success lies with forging alliances among those who serve her enemies—including a mysterious Sith spy and a clever mercenary general. But will they be her adversaries or her salvation?\n\nMaybe this is why I didn’t get all the adulation over Rey. You want to see a butt-kicking female lead in Star Wars? Kerra Holt did it first and did it better. A lone Jedi up against a squabbling Sith dynasty with no master and no fellow Jedi to help her. Kerra uses cunning, stealth and the Force to defend those who can’t defend themselves. Miller also reveals to us a galaxy split in half between Sith and Republic rule. That explains why the Jedi were so intent on participating in the Clone Wars.\n\nDarth Plagueis (2012)\n\nJames Luceno\n\nDarth Plagueis: Like all Sith Lords before him, he craves absolute power. But like no Sith Lord ever, he possesses the ultimate power—over life and death.\n\nDarth Sidious: In secret he masters the power of the dark side, while publicly climbing to the highest government office.\n\nOne desires to rule supreme; the other dreams of living forever. Together, they will destroy the Jedi and rule the galaxy. Unless merciless Sith tradition becomes their undoing. . . .\n\nA must-read novel for anyone who loves the prequel trilogy. It gives a backstory to the mysterious Darth Plagueis mentioned in ROTS. It explains why Naboo was chosen by the Trade Federation for the Blockade. It reveals how Sidious met Darth Maul. It gives us an early glimpse of Padme Amidala before she entered politics and much, much more.\n\nDarth Maul: Shadow Hunter (2001)\n\nMichael Reaves\n\nAfter years of waiting in the shadows, Darth Sidious is taking the first step in his master plan to bring the Republic to its knees. Key to his scheme are the Neimoidians of the Trade Federation. Then one of his Neimoidian contacts disappears, and Sidious does not need his Force-honed instincts to suspect betrayal. He orders his apprentice, Darth Maul, to hunt the traitor down.\n\nBut he is too late. The secret has already passed into the hands of information broker Lorn Pavan, which places him right at the top of Darth Maul’s hit list. Then, in the labyrinthine alleyways and sewers of Coruscant, Lorn crosses paths with Darsha Assant, a Jedi Padawan on a mission to earn her Knighthood. Now the future of the Republic depends on Darsha and Lorn. But how can an untried Jedi and an ordinary man, stranger to the powerful ways of the Force, hope to triumph over one of the deadliest killers in the galaxy?\n\nOur first glimpse into the mind of Darth Maul, how he operates and executes his assignments. We are also introduced to the uber-intelligent droid I-Five, who’ll later make an appearance in the Coruscant Nights duology.\n\nMaul: Lockdown (2014)\n\nJoe Schreiber\n\nIt’s kill or be killed in the space penitentiary that houses the galaxy’s worst criminals, where convicts face off in gladiatorial combat while an underworld gambling empire reaps the profits of the illicit blood sport. But the newest contender in this savage arena, as demonic to behold as he is deadly to challenge, is fighting for more than just survival. His do-or-die mission, for the dark masters he serves, is to capture the ultimate weapon: an object that will enable the Sith to conquer the galaxy.\n\nSith lords Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious are determined to possess the prize. And one of the power-hungry duo has his own treacherous plans for it. But first, their fearsome apprentice must take on a bloodthirsty prison warden, a cannibal gang, cutthroat crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and an unspeakable alien horror. No one else could brave such a gauntlet of death and live. But no one else is the dreaded dark-side disciple known as Darth Maul.\n\nForget those zombie books Schreiber wrote. This is his best SW work and its every bit as dark and eerie as his previous books. Darth Maul goes to prison. Need I say more?\n\nThe Approaching Storm (2002)\n\nAlan Dean Foster\n\nThe Republic is decaying, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who was elected to save the galaxy from collapsing under the forces of discontent. On the tiny but strategic planet of Ansion, a powerful faction is on the verge of joining the growing secessionist movement. At the Chancellor’s request, the Jedi Council sends two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, along with their Padawans Anakin Skywalker and Barriss Offee, to stabilize the planet’s population. To succeed, the Jedi will have to fulfill near-impossible tasks, befriend wary strangers, and influence two great armies, stalked all the while by an enemy sworn to see the negotiations collapse and the mission fail. . . .\n\nFoster’s 1st SW novel since Splinter of the Mind’s Eye. Just at the beginning of AOTC, Mace Windu quips that Anakin and Obi-Wan had just returned from a border dispute from Ansion. This book goes into more detail about what happened on Ansion. It’s also fun to see the different personalities that bounce off each other when Obi-Wan and Anakin are joined by Luminara Unduli and her apprentice Bariss Offee. Look forward to an exciting chapter when each jedi performs a specific talent for the natives.\n\nThe Clone Wars: Wild Space (2008)\n\nKaren Miller\n\nThe Clone Wars have exploded across the galaxy as Republic forces and Separatists struggle to gain the upper hand. But while the Jedi generals work tirelessly to defeat Count Dooku and his rebels, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine is hatching his own dark plans.\n\nThe Separatists have launched a sneak attack on Coruscant. Obi-Wan Kenobi, wounded in battle, insists that Anakin Skywalker and his rookie Padawan Ahsoka leave on a risky mission against General Grievous. But when Senator Bail Organa reveals explosive intelligence that could turn the tide of war in the Republic’s favor, the Jedi Master agrees to accompany him to an obscure planet on the Outer Rim to verify the facts. What Obi-Wan and Bail don’t realize is that they’re walking into a deadly trap concocted by Palpatine . . . and that escape may not be an option.\n\nSenator Bail Organa’s opportunity to be a hero. Now we know where Leia gets her courage from.\n\nThe Cestus Deception (2005)\n\nSteven Barnes\n\nOrd Cestus, a planet mostly barren and inhospitable to life, was first colonized as a prison world—until a handful of hardy pioneers discovered its rich ore deposits and managed to build up a successful droid-manufacturing industry. But when the Clone Wars erupted, bringing a Republic ban on the production of battle droids, Ord Cestus was threatened with imminent economic collapse.\n\nEnter the Confederacy of Independent Systems—the Separatists—with a life-saving offer to purchase a generous quantity of the planet’s most lucrative export: bio-droids. Possessed of tactical capabilities that rival the fighting abilities of even the most advanced Jedi, these sophisticated, techno-organic hybrid units would prove a most formidable weapon if ever deployed for military use. And now the Confederacy’s intention to invest in what amounts to an army of bio-droids has sent ripples of alarm through the highest echelons of the Republic government.\n\nDetermined to halt the bio-droid sale—but fearing a show of force will result in a political backlash—Supreme Chancellor Palpatine dispatches a team of envoys, led by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Their mission: persuade Ord Cestus’s government to abandon its dealings with the Confederacy . . . while secretly stirring up revolution among the planet’s struggling underclass. Diplomacy is paramount. But if all else fails, the Republic will not hesitate to launch a full-scale attack—and wipe out not only the means of bio-droid production, but countless lives as well, to demonstrate the consequences of disloyalty.\n\nFor Obi-Wan, the prospect of such wholesale slaughter only serves to fuel his growing suspicions about the sinister path the Republic seems to be taking. But the brash Jedi Master Kit Fisto and the detachment of clone soldiers assigned to the mission are ready and willing to do the Supreme Chancellor’s bidding. As the leaders of Ord Cestus refuse to capitulate and Palpatine rapidly loses patience, Obi-Wan’s hopes of a peaceful resolution are dwindling. Now, facing a crisis of conscience, Obi-Wan must find the wisdom and strength to prevent a bloodbath and safeguard the Republic— while abiding by the ancient code to which he has pledged his life.\n\nThe 1st SW novel to be written by a black author. Who never tweeted accusations of racism against Lucas. He also created an insectile character who – per biology – slowly changes from male to female – without confusing the reader.\n\nThe Medstar Duology (2004)\n\nMichael Reaves & Steve Perry\n\nIt’s M*A*S*H* meets Star Wars – but without the comedy of course. Aspiring healer Bariss Offee joins a medical unit on the planet Drongar to heal wounded soldiers during the Clone Wars. Comes in two volumes.\n\nYoda: Dark Rendezvous (2004)\n\nSean Stewart\n\nThe savage Clone Wars have forced the Republic to the edge of collapse. During the height of the battle, one Jedi Knight escapes the carnage to deliver a message to Yoda on Coruscant. It appears that Dooku wants peace and demands a rendezvous. Chances are slim that the treacherous Count is sincere but, with a million lives at stake, Yoda has no choice.\n\nThe meeting will take place on Djun, a planet steeped in evil. The challenge could not be more difficult. Can Yoda win back his once promising pupil from the dark side or will Count Dooku unleash his sinister forces against his former mentor? Either way, Yoda is sure of one thing: This battle will be one of the fiercest he’ll ever face.\n\nWant to know more about Yoda’s life in the Jedi Temple when he’s not sitting on the Council? Want to hear a philosophical debate between Yoda and his former apprentice? Read this book.\n\nKenobi (2013)\n\nJohn Jackson Miller\n\nTatooine—a harsh desert world where farmers toil in the heat of two suns while trying to protect themselves and their loved ones from the marauding Tusken Raiders. A backwater planet on the edge of civilized space. And an unlikely place to find a Jedi Master in hiding, or an orphaned infant boy on whose tiny shoulders rests the future of a galaxy.\n\nKnown to locals only as “Ben,” the bearded and robed offworlder is an enigmatic stranger who keeps to himself, shares nothing of his past, and goes to great pains to remain an outsider. But as tensions escalate between the farmers and a tribe of Sand People led by a ruthless war chief, Ben finds himself drawn into the fight, endangering the very mission that brought him to Tatooine.\n\nBen—Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, hero of the Clone Wars, traitor to the Empire, and protector of the galaxy’s last hope—can no more turn his back on evil than he can reject his Jedi training. And when blood is unjustly spilled, innocent lives threatened, and a ruthless opponent unmasked, Ben has no choice but to call on the wisdom of the Jedi—and the formidable power of the Force—in his never-ending fight for justice.\n\nOne of the few SW books that chronicles day-to-day life on Tatooine. Despite Luke’s protestations about the “backwater” planet, Tatooine sure has some interesting inhabitants.\n\nCoruscant Nights Trilogy (2008, 2009)\n\nMichael Reaves\n\nIf you’ve read Darth Maul-Shadow Hunter, you’re already familiar with Lorn Pavan and if your familiar with Lorn Pavan, you know that his son Jax was taken to the Jedi Temple as a baby. Now Jax Pavan is all grown up – but he’s one of the few jedi to survive Order 66 and now he’s working as a private eye in the slums of Coruscant. Too bad he has to constantly stay one step ahead of Darth Vader – who’ll stop at nothing to destroy one of “the last jedi”. The GFFA’s homage to hardboiled detective fiction.\n\nThe Han Solo Trilogy (1997, 1998)\n\nA.C. Crispin\n\nWho needs a Han Solo movie when you can save your money and buy A.C. Crispin’s tales of the early adventures of Star Wars‘ most beloved scoundrel from his days as a space pirate to his early involvement with the Rebel Alliance (before A New Hope, mind you).\n\nThe Force Unleashed (2009)\n\nSean Williams\n\nThe second non-movie, multi-media project Lucasfilm released to the public to bridge ROTS & ANH (eat your heart out Rogue One): it consisted of a video game, a comic book, a novel and lots of toys. I didn’t play the game but I read (and enjoyed) the book which is what I told a flea market vendor when I purchased a Maris Brood action figure from him.\n\nDark Disciple (2016)\n\nChristie Golden\n\nIn the war for control of the galaxy between the armies of the dark side and the Republic, former Jedi Master turned ruthless Sith Lord Count Dooku has grown ever more brutal in his tactics. Despite the powers of the Jedi and the military prowess of their clone army, the sheer number of fatalities is taking a terrible toll. And when Dooku orders the massacre of a flotilla of helpless refugees, the Jedi Council feels it has no choice but to take drastic action: targeting the man responsible for so many war atrocities, Count Dooku himself.\n\nBut the ever-elusive Dooku is dangerous prey for even the most skilled hunter. So the Council makes the bold decision to pair brash Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos with infamous one-time Sith acolyte Asajj Ventress. Though distrust for the cunning killer who once served at Dooku’s side still runs deep, Ventress’s hatred for her former master runs deeper. She’s more than willing to lend her copious talents as a bounty hunter—and assassin—to Vos’s quest.\n\nTogether, Ventress and Vos are the best hope for eliminating Dooku—as long as the emerging feelings between them don’t compromise their mission. But Ventress is determined to have her retribution and at last let go of her dark Sith past. Balancing the complicated emotions she feels for Vos with the fury of her warrior’s spirit, she resolves to claim victory on all fronts—a vow that will be mercilessly tested by her deadly enemy . . . and her own doubt.\n\nOK so this one isn’t a “Legends” book. It’s “canon” according to Disney. But let’s face it: like the EU, Disney gave The Clone Wars the short end of the stick. This novel is based on some episodes that never made it to the airwaves. That’s why I’m including it here. This is the only “new canon” book that’s worth a look. Plus there’s a touching forward by Katie Lucas about the positive impact Star Wars has played in her family’s life.\n\nHonor Among Thieves (2014)\n\nJames S.A. Corey\n\nWhen the mission is to extract a high-level rebel spy from the very heart of the Empire, Leia Organa knows the best man for the job is Han Solo—something the princess and the smuggler can finally agree on.\n\nBut when Han locates the brash rebel agent, Scarlet Hark, she’s determined to stay behind enemy lines. A pirate plans to sell a cache of stolen secrets that the Empire would destroy entire worlds to protect—including the planet where Leia is currently meeting with rebel sympathizers. Scarlet wants to track down the thief and steal the bounty herself, and Han has no choice but to go along if he’s to keep everyone involved from getting themselves killed. From teeming city streets to a lethal jungle to a trap-filled alien temple, Han, Chewbacca, Leia, and their daring new comrade confront one ambush, double cross, and firestorm after another as they try to keep crucial intel out of Imperial hands.\n\nBut even with the crack support of Luke Skywalker’s x-wing squadron, the Alliance heroes may be hopelessly outgunned in their final battle for the highest of stakes: the power to liberate the galaxy from tyranny or ensure the Empire’s reign of darkness forever.\n\nThe last Expanded Universe novel to be published with yet another memorable female character to add to a long list of awesome SW ladies.\n\nGalaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine (2004)\n\nVoronica Whitney-Robinson & Haden Blackman\n\nHidden in the Jedi ruins of Dantooine is a Holocron containing a list of high-level Rebel sympathizers. If that list were to fall into the hands of Darth Vader, the Rebel Alliance would lose its most valued support—and possibly the war itself.\n\nAs an Imperial bio-engineer who frequently visits other worlds, Dusque Mistflier is the perfect cover for a Rebel who needs to travel far and wide without arousing suspicion. And so she agrees to help Rebel spy Finn Darktrin in his quest to recover the crucial Holocron. Despite help from Han, Luke, and Leia, the mission is fraught with peril. And as their journey takes them into the fiery belly of the beast that is galactic civil war, Dusque and Finn will learn that the hardest part of all is figuring out whose side you’re on—and how far you’re willing to go to win. . . .\n\nA SW novel with another awesome female character who knows a lot about animals. And a character named Finn… who isn’t what he seems.\n\nShadows of the Empire (1996)\n\nSteve Perry\n\nA story set between TESB & ROTJ.\n\nOMG, this one is FAMOUS for being the first non-movie, multi-media project Lucasfilm released to the public: it had a novel for adults, a novel for kids, a video game, a trading card collection, an toy line, a comic series and a flippin‘ soundtrack composed by Joel McNeely – which is really good by the way. It also introduced three new interesting characters: cynical pilot Dash Rendar, assassin assistant Guri and so evil he’s sexy Prince Xizor, a Falleen who wins the respect of the non-human hating Emperor and draws the ire of Vader – no easy feat.\n\nThe Courtship of Princess Leia (1995)\n\nDave Wolverton\n\nSeeking rich, powerful allies to bring into the Rebel Alliance and a new home planet for the refugees of her native Alderaan, Princess Leia considers a proposal that could tip the balance of power against the evil Empire. The Hapes Consortium of 63 worlds is ruled by the Queen Mother, who wants Leia to marry her son, the dashing and wealthy Prince Isolder. Han Solo has always dreamed of marrying Leia himself, and now he makes a desperate last gamble to win her back. Soon he, Isolder, Luke Skywalker and Artoo will be at the center of an adventure leading to an awesome treasure, a group of Force-trained “witches,” and a showdown with an invincible foe.\n\nThe most female-centric SW novel: besides our titular princess and the aforementioned witches, we have a planet full of Force-sensitive “Amazons”. This is the second time we meet the Nightsisters in the GFFA (the 1st time was the 1985 made-for-TV movie Ewoks: The Battle for Endor) while the Singing Mountain Clan will produce future beloved EU character Tenel Ka.\n\nDoes it make me a bad fan to secretly wish Leia had ended up with Prince Isolder instead of Han?\n\nTatooine Ghost (2003)\n\nTroy Denning\n\nThe deaths of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine by no means spelled the end of the Empire. In the aftermath, the New Republic has faced a constant struggle to survive. Now a new threat looms: a masterpiece of Alderaanian art—lost after the planet’s destruction—has resurfaced on the black market. It conceals a vital secret—the code used to communicate with New Republic agents undercover within the Empire. Discovery by Imperial forces would spell disaster. The only option is recovery—and Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO have been dispatched to Tatooine to infiltrate the auction.\n\nWhen a dispute at the auction erupts into violence, the painting vanishes in the chaos. Han and Leia are thrust into a desperate race to reclaim it. As they battle against marauding TIE fighters, encroaching stormtroopers, and Tatooine’s savage Tusken Raiders, Leia’s emotional struggle over the specter of her infamous father culminates in the discovery of an extraordinary link to the past. And as long-buried secrets at last emerge, she faces a moment of reckoning that will forever alter her destiny . . . and that of the New Republic.\n\nShmi Skywalker and Kitster fans should love this one as it delves deeper into their lives after Anakin leaves Tatooine with Qui-Gonn, how Leia learns about her family history and how, once again, there’s never a dull moment on Tatooine.\n\nStay tuned for part 2."
