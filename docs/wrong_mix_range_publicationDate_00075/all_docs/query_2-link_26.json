        "text": "References are numbered in consecutive order in the text, tables, or figures.\n\nUse superscript arabic numerals to cite material, e.g., 1 The first reference used in a written document is listed as 1 in the reference list.\n\nWhere to place the superscript? The superscript number 1 is inserted into the document immediately next to the fact, concept, or quotation being cited. If citing more than one reference at the same point, separate the numbers with commas and no spaces between.\n\nThe Superscript number is inserted:\n\nImmediately next to the fact, idea or quotation being cited. Ex. This drug is used to treat hepatitis.1\n\nOutside periods and commas. Ex. Storing latex at high heat may cause degradation, 2,3-5,7 but it is difficult to keep materials cool in a desert environment.\n\nInside colons and semi-colons. Ex. Some physicians choose to store prescription pads in locked cabinets 8; others keep them in their coats at all times. 9\n\nWhen more than 2 references are cited at a given place in the manuscript, use hyphens to join the first and last numbers of a closed series; use commas without space to separate other parts of a multiple citation. Ex. As reported previously,1,4-7,19,24\n\nIf a reference is used multiple times in one paper, use the same number throughout.\n\nAt the end of the document, include a reference list with full citations to each item. Name it References. Order citations as they appear in your paper.\n\nUsing author's names in-text: You may use author names in your text, as long as these mentions are accompanied by numbered citations. Use last names only. For items with one or two authors, include both names. For items with 3 or more authors, include the first author's surname and then 'et al' or 'and colleagues'.\n\nEx. Smith and Jones2 reported on the questionnaire. Ex. Hammersmith et al3 reported on the survey.\n\nSecondary Citations:"
