        "text": "During the 1890’s, four transcontinental passenger trains a day passed through the Royal Gorge. The original route between Denver and Salt Lake went over Marshall Pass, through Gunnison, Montrose, and Grand Junction. Later, the main line was constructed over Tennessee Pass through Glenwood Springs and into Grand Junction. With the opening of the Moffat Tunnel in 1928, passengers could go either way to Salt Lake. If they chose the Royal Gorge route, they would leave early in the morning arriving at Grand Junction in time for their train to be combined with the overnight Prospector for the run into Salt Lake. Planes, with their faster schedules, automobiles, for the independent traveler, and buses, were the downfall of the Royal Gorge, as passengers took to other forms of transportation.\n\nThe last segment of this famous train was between Denver and Salida. April 1 was the crowning blow, when the U.S. Post Office Department cancelled the mail contract on this train, leaving the Rio Grande with empty head-end cars and coaches.\n\nThe handwriting was on the wall. Authority was soon forthcoming for discontinuance of the Royal Gorge trains No. 1 and No.2. On July 26, 1967, 56 passengers and 34 Head Start children boarded train No. 1 at Denver. The children, many having their first train ride, detrained at Littleton. Passengers boarded the train at every station along the way that day.\n\nArriving at Cañon City, 104 passengers got on the train for the ride through the Royal Gorge, getting off at Parkdale, the first stop beyond the hanging bridge. Over 300 passengers had ridden the train the day before it was to be discontinued. Arrival at Salida saw 171 passengers still on board. To many at the depot, the alighting mass brought back memories of days of long ago. For the final run of No.2 out of Salida, 120 persons found their seats in the three coaches.\n\nThe trip was uneventful except for the feeling of nostalgia that prevailed at a time like this. Each one on the train knew they were part of Rio Grande history, being made on the last trip through the Gorge from the west.\n\nColorado Governor, Roy Romer, told the UP that the state would not oppose the abandonment provided that the 12 miles from Canon City to Parkdale would be left intact. (At the time, Parkdale was just a 9,200 ft CTC controlled passing track on the railroad, there was no industrial or commercial activity. There were the foundations of a long, dismantled feldspar processing plant). Romer wanted the line through the Royal Gorge to be available as a means for tourists to see this magnificent natural gorge from the river level. To this end agreement was reached.\n\nThe state developed a bidding process that would hopefully result in the selection of a private operator that could construct a suitable passenger train operation through the gorge. Bidding solicitations were advertised and bid packages (at $500) sent to respondents. The operators of the Georgetown Loop Railroad (the Loop) did not ask for a bid package. This company became involved when Mr. Dan Quiet (one of the bidders) inquired about our joining his efforts to gain the right to operate a Train through the gorge. Mr. Quiet was also involved with two other men, Bill Fehr, and Mitch Albert, who intended to develop a rock quarry at the end of the 12 miles at Parkdale. There was a large gravel deposit there and they wanted to transport it by rail to markets.\n\nAn agreement was reached that a company called Royal Gorge Express (RGX): consisting of, 50% on one part, of Mr. Quiet and the Loop company as the passenger side of the company and, 50% the other part with Mr. Fehr and Mr. Albert as the freight haulers would submit a bid. These two entities would be Canon City & Royal Gorge Railroad and Rock & Rail respectively. Six bids were submitted, and RGX was selected for the right to purchase the 11.92 miles of the line (MP 160 to MP171.92), including the track, bridges and other improvements from the UP. On July 6, 1998 the line sale was finalized.\n\nThe success of RGX in being selected rests on its thorough, detailed presentation, and also with the Loop company being involved in any future train operation. The Georgetown Loop had been in operation for 25 years at that point and had a credible record of competence and experience in developing and operating a scenic railroad. As none of the other participants in RGX had any such credentials, the reputation of the Loop as a successful scenic railroad operator had to have had a significant effect in the State’s decision to select RGX as the company most likely to successfully operate the line. After 23 years of stable growth and safe train operation the State’s decision was well justified. The Royal Gorge train has become a significant attraction and has greatly benefited the economy of Canon City and Fremont County.\n\nRoyal Gorge History reaches the modern-day with The Royal Gorge Route Railroad being reestablished in the fall of 1998 and has become a premier destination attraction carrying more than 200,000 guests through the Royal Gorge each year. Our vision is to provide a quality experience, combining the spectacular scenery of the Royal Gorge, the nostalgia of 1950’s train travel, with unique dining options and exceptional service. The Royal Gorge Route has been instrumental in preserving this breathtaking canyon and ensuring a vital part of Colorado history will be passed along to the next generation.\n\nWhy do so many people ride the train? We are not a theme park or carnival experience. We do not offer thrill rides, but instead have grown as a major destination attraction through ensuring the Royal Gorge remains a special place and should be preserved much like any one of our National Parks. We believe riding the rails through the Royal Gorge and spotting Big Horn Sheep, Blue Heron, Bald Eagles, and enjoying the tumbling Arkansas River with your family or special someone is a very unique experience. The train provides the means to unwind, enjoy family time and Mother Nature up close."
