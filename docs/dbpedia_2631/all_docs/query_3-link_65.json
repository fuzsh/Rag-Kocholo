        "text": "The Oldest Church In The Continental United States\n\nWelcome to the San Miguel Chapel in Santa Fe, New Mexico. San Miguel Chapel is known in Santa Fe simply as “The Oldest Church”, and it is referenced in Wikipedia as the oldest church in the continental United States.\n\nThe chapel is located in the Barrio de Analco, a national historic district of Santa Fe. Oral history holds that the barrio was founded by a group of Mexican Indians from Tlaxcala. The adobe church was constructed under the direction of Franciscan friars to serve a small congregation of soldiers, laborers, and Indians who lived in the Barrio de Analco. It was partially destroyed during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. The present building dates from 1710, although it has undergone significant structural changes.\n\nFor a travel guide to the authentic Santa Fe, visit Santa Fe Selection.\n\nHistory of San Miguel Chapel\n\nSan Miguel Chapel is the oldest Catholic Church built in the United States part of whose original walls are still standing and which is still used regularly for religious services. It is the centerpiece of El Barrio de Analco National Register Historic District in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Adobe buildings like this chapel, historically, were not exclusively used for worship and ceremonies. Their size and location within the community allowed for a variety of gatherings.\n\nDuring the 400+ years, first under the rule of imperial Spain, then Mexico, and finally the USA, the Chapel, dedicated to Archangel Michael, has been many things to many people. It has served as a place of worship for diverse groups of Native Americans; an infirmary for Franciscan missionaries; a target for autocratic officials and exploited Pueblo groups; a military chapel; a unique venue for talks, concerts, celebrations and ceremonies; and a sanctified space for Sunday Mass in Latin and English. Today and into the future, this treasured, privately owned, but ever-fragile structure requires constant vigilance and expert use of traditional construction methods and culturally authentic materials.\n\nSan Miguel Chapel first appears in the surviving historical written record in 1628. Construction my have begun by 1610 according to oral history, simultaneous with, or prior to, the official founding of Santa Fe. According to archeologists, this Franciscan-designed house of worship rests upon an early Pueblo settlement from circa 800-1300 CE.\n\nThe Importance of Oral Tradition: Few question whether or not the San Miguel Chapel in Santa Fe is the oldest Church in The United Staes, but many do question just how old it is. It’s no easy task to sift historical fact from traditional belief. Oral history holds that San Miguel Chapel was built around 1610, and it has been rebuilt and restored several times over the past 400 years. Oral tradition, stories told throughout the generations by local families and communities, remains a binding fabric of identity and historic pride for local people.\n\nOfficial documentation stored in the Chapel was destroyed by fire during the revolt of 1680. However, many documents had previously been sent back to Mexico and Spain as reports to officials. Even today, documents naming San Miguel Chapel are being discovered all over the world, the latest one in London.\n\nWhat follows is a timeline of the chapel.\n\n1598\n\n00\n\n1598\n\nAccording to oral tradition, the Chapel was most likely constructed by the Tlaxcalan (Tas-cal’-en) Indians who came to New Mexico. In its early years the church served a small group of Tlaxcalan Indians, laborers, and Spanish soldiers. Indian groups from central New Spain (today’s Mexico), became allied to the Spanish since 1519 as participants in the 1521 settling of the Southwest US.\n\nNalco means “on the other side of the river”. The Palace of the Governors, dating back to 1610 as well, was built on the opposite northern side of the river creating the current city Plaza. As Spanish colonists quested for silver and souls, various catechized groups of Native peoples were sent forth from Mexico to serve as model - but segregated - settlers. Santa Fe’s Barrio de Analco is the northernmost of all of these.\n\n1610\n\n00\n\nSan Miguel Chapel Was Built\n\nBuilt between approximately 1610 and 1626, San Miguel Chapel in Santa Fe is considered by most to be the oldest church structure in the United States. The c.1610 rectangular footprint was typical of the first stage of Franciscan frontier churches. The original adobe walls and altar were built by Spanish-allied Tlaxcalan (Tas-cal-len) Indians from Mexico under the direction of Franciscan Padres.\n\n1640\n\n00\n\n1640\n\nThe Chapel was partially destroyed by Luis de Rojas, a provincial governor who feuded with church authorities. It was reconstructed as well.\n\n1680\n\n00\n\n1680 Revolt\n\nSan Miguel Chapel was damaged and the roof was burned during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Also known as Popé's Rebellion — the revolt was a coordinated attack including most Pueblo Indians that drove more than 2000 surviving Spanish settlers, officials and missionary friars south across the Mexican border to a 12 year exile near the Rio Grande crossing at El Paso. San Miguel Chapel was targeted because it was the designated chapel for Meso-American, Spanish and Mexican settlers. - Wikipedia\n\nWatch a PBS documentary on the Pueblo Revolt.\n\n1693\n\n00\n\n1693 Resettlement\n\nThe Spanish returned to Santa Fe, led by the Governor General Don Diego de Vargas who ordered the repair and restoration of the Chapel. San Miguel Chapel and Barrio de Analco became home to displaced former captives, raised to adulthood in Spanish-speaking households after being taken in combat against - or ransomed from - seasonally nomadic Northern American tribes. Pueblo communities and Spanish Settlers - returnees as well as new recruits - had no choice but to cooperate in mutual defense against mounted Apaches, Comanches, Navajos, and Utes. The Chapel sustained two major assaults during the 1600s, plus the persistent ravages of a harsh climate.\n\n1710\n\n00\n\nSan Miguel Chapel Was Rebuilt\n\nSan Miguel Chapel was rebuilt, including new roof, in 1710 following the Spanish reconquest and served for a time as a chapel for the Spanish soldiers. The c.1650 tapered sanctuary, expanded in 1710, is typical of the second, pre-Baroque prototype of Franciscan frontier churches. By the mid-1700s, Barrio de Analco’s blend of homes, workshops, and croplands kept a broad spectrum of residents, non-Native as well as Native: soldiers, artisans, tradesmen, farmers, laborers and leading citizens. By the late 1700s Santa Fe boasted four mixed barrios: San Miguel, San Francisco, Guadalupe, and Torréon.\n\n1798\n\n00\n\n1798\n\nThe mayor of Santa Fe helped fund major repairs and the construction of the beautiful alter screen.\n\n1812\n\n00\n\n1812\n\nMexico claimed independence from Spain.\n\n1848\n\n00\n\n1848\n\nA three-tiered bell tower is added.\n\n1856\n\n00\n\n1856\n\nThe 789 pound San Jose Bell is added to the bell tower. (On display in the Chapel today)\n\n1859\n\n00\n\n1859\n\nA decade after the US takeover of New Mexico and Upper California, Archbishop Lamy purchased the Chapel and adjacent land for the De LaSalle Christian Brothers who developed a school next to the Chapel. After brief use as a private oratory for the brothers, the Chapel hosted a century of daily masses for students - until the relocation of St Michael’s High School in 1968. National Register Historic District status, applied for that same year, was granted in 1975. The old school building still stands except for the third floor which burned in a fire. It is the largest all-adobe building in the state. It is owned by the NM State Government and is used for offices.\n\n1862\n\n00\n\n1862\n\nIn addition to much needed repairs, the Christian Brothers added a wooden floor covering the earthen floor, a Communion rail, and a large door at the entrance.\n\n1872\n\n00\n\nSan Jose Bell Legend - Bell Tower Falls in a Storm\n\nA strong, windy storm struck Santa Fe and brought down the bell tower along with the San Jose Bell, which is now on display inside the Chapel.\n\nThe legend of the first church bell goes back to Spain and its eight-century-long battle with the Moors. In the small hamlet of San Jose in Andalucia, the villagers prayed to St. Joseph for protection. They promised that if they were saved from the Moors they would honor him. With their prayers answered, a bell was cast as a tribute of appreciation. Through their unrelenting faith and prayers, they believed that each time the bell rang, the power of the Moors declined. Therefore, the Christians had gained victory each time the bell rang triumphantly. With the prayers of the people answered their enemy was finally expelled from Spain.\n\nThe legend goes on to say that during the 17th century, the bell was brought to Santa Fe by ship from southern Spain. It was transported by wagon up the Camino Real by Nicolas Ortiz Niño Ladron de Guevara. The bell was placed in a capilla (small chapel) he built for his family. After the Pueblo Revolt it was placed at San Miguel Chapel. In 1872 the bell was damaged by a storm and removed to the interior of the church for protection and preservation where it resides today.\n\nAnother story is that the bell was cast in New Mexico in 1853.\n\n1887\n\n00\n\nSan Miguel Chapel Rebuilt\n\nThe chapel was in serious need of repair. With no funds available, the Christian Brothers considered demolishing the structure. The local community came to the rescue and built the first of two stone buttresses onto the front of the building to shore up the crumbling adobe walls. The interior and exterior walls were plastered. A tar and gravel roof replaced the old mud roof. A new, smaller bell tower was added. Thus began the Chapel’s ongoing and ever-present community stewardship dedicated to the restoration and preservation of this cherished structure.\n\n1889\n\n00\n\n1889\n\nTwo additional buttresses were added on the north wall.\n\n1955\n\n00\n\n1955\n\nThe School of American Research was engaged by the Christian Brothers to execute an archeological dig under the chapel altar to better date the origin of the chapel. As a part of this effort, E. Boyd, a local painter and Spanish Colonial art curator completed a restoration of the altar screen retablo. The original dirt floor and sanctuary steps were uncovered and can be seen through the altar floor, through plexiglass floor panels just beyond the Communion rail. During this investigation, many human remains and pieces of pottery were found buried under the church floor.\n\n2008\n\n00\n\n2008\n\nSt Michael’s entered into collaborative relationship with Cornerstones Community Partnerships for the preservation of San Miguel Chapel. Cornerstones has provided the technical and grant expertise for a major preservation effort. Starting in 2010, the Portland cement stucco was removed, adobe was repaired and an adobe plaster finish coat was applied. In the spring of 2020, another external chapel wall was restored and preserved with adobe plastering and lime whitewash. You can see a video of this process here.\n\n2021\n\n00\n\nPreserving the Past for the Future\n\nSan Miguel Chapel is one of the best examples of preserved adobe architecture in Santa Fe. St Michael’s High School, which used san Miguel as its chapel from 1859 to 1967, is the proud owner and caretaker of this historic treasure.\n\nToday, this structure of sunbaked earthen bricks on stone continues to be a magnet for tourists and in-the-know locals. As San Miguel Chapel enters its fifth century, its continued survival depends on timely preservation, restoration and maintenance. With the volunteer labor and financial contributions generously given, San Miguel Chapel will continue to be preserved by the Santa Fe community, guests and visitors from throughout the United Sates and the world.\n\nSan Miguel Chapel exists today after 400 years because of the local, national and international community that has supported its preservation. You can join this community by making a donation to the chapel’s ongoing preservation efforts.\n\n2021 color chapel photos: L.

This trend-shifting piece is attributed, along with seven others, to the Laguna Santero – name unknown. Between 1801 and 1809 this anonymous craftsman created the exquisite altar setting as Laguna Pueblo’s San Jose de Gracia, and another for the imposing church at neighboring Pueblo San Esteban de Acoma.\n\nThe Statue of Archangel Michael: duly equipped with silver helmet and sword, but missing his emblematic scales of justice – dates no later that 1709, when it was carried throughout New Mexico to solicit donations for the Chapel’s 1710 reconstruction. The flanking New Mexican-made bultos (sculpted, painted, wooden saints) were donated by a 20th century patron, as were the hide-paintings on the side walls of the nave – portable visual aides for itinerant missionaries.\n\nAn inventory from 1776 lists “eight not very large oil paintings on canvas of saints” surrounding the statue; the current four may be part if that set. In the 1860s, when the chapel became an oratory for the French teaching order enlisted by Bishop Lamy, five layers of white paint concealed the colors of the retablo. For 70 years, the place of honor on their “neo-Gothic” altar was occupied by the Byzantine-style Our Lady Of Perpetual Help, blessed by Pope Leo XIIIi n 1887.\n\nAlso of note are the painted cross-shaped sword, reportedly the only survivor of a colonial era Stations of the Cross series and, in adjacent glass-fronted wooden case, a painted wooden crucifixion by noted northern New Mexico saunter Jose Rafeall Aragin (c.1790-1862). In 1995, the Christian Brothers decided to reassert the chapel’s Hispanic New Mexican origins, arranging for restoration of the retablo and associated art works. The tin sconces and set of 14 carved Stations of the Cross date from that effort.\n\nArtworks on the Altar Screen\n\n(From viewers’ left to right, bottom to top)\n\nBulto #1: unidentified saint, New Mexico, XIX\n\nBulto #2: Archangel Michael/San Miguel, New Spain, XVIII\n\nBulto #3: likely Saint Anthony/San Antonio.
