        "text": "North County’s laid-back beach cities and tranquil ruralstretches may seem like a world away from the glitz and glamour ofHollywood, but the stars do come out every once in a while.\n\nIsn’t that legendary musician Joe Walsh in the movie lobby in LaCosta? Did you hear actor Bill Murray was at an Italian restaurantin Escondido? And why is actress Geena Davis picking up her drycleaning in Solana Beach?\n\nFrom Self-Realization Fellowship founder Paramahansa Yoganandato home-grown rockers blink-182, the area has a long history offamous, and sometimes infamous, residents.\n\nUnlike in Hollywood, there is no map of the stars’ homes inNorth County, however, and separating rumor from fact can be achallenge. But it’s clear that many celebrities like what NorthCounty has to offer.\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor Richard Dreyfuss moved to Carlsbadfive years ago and has lived in Olivenhain since 2008. He said in arecent interview that he chose Southern California because of itsclimate, and San Diego County because of its environment.\n\n“I wanted to move back to California, and I didn’t want to livein L.A.,” Dreyfuss said. “We were living in London and I wasworking at Oxford, studying. The weather got to me.”\n\nAfter some quick online research, Dreyfuss said he and his wifevisited San Diego County, looked at three houses, and decided thatday to make North County their home.\n\n“This is the last remaining great climate in the country,” hesaid.\n\nAlthough Dreyfuss continues to make movies —- he was in”Piranha” and “Red” last year —- he said he considers himselfretired. Living in Olivenhain could be a challenge for an actoractively pursuing a Hollywood career, he acknowledged.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to do a series and live here,” he said. “Thatwould be too far.”\n\nDreyfuss said he gets recognized locally, but not to anuncomfortable extent.\n\n“I’ve always had what I call a medium celebrity,” he said. “Andalso, I’ve kind of outlived it. My season is gone, and I’m nolonger a movie star. Most of the time when parents come up and saysomething, they’re dragging kids who have no idea who the hell Iam, anyway.”\n\nBesides the weather, Dreyfuss said North County features greatused-book stores. He said he would like someday to work with localtheaters, such as the La Jolla Playhouse and the Old Globe atBalboa Park, as part of a consortium of theaters participating in aseries of plays about American history.\n\nStars on the horizon\n\nWhile Dreyfuss has made recent appearances at a Solana Beachschool and the Encinitas Library, most local celebrities keep amuch lower profile. The anonymity offered no doubt is part of thearea’s appeal, which can add to the challenge of sorting rumorsfrom fact.\n\nAnd it is probably why many requests for interviews for thisarticle went unanswered by publicists.\n\nEven a check of public records can’t confirm some rumors,because celebrities sometimes keep their names off propertyholdings by listing the owner as a trust.\n\nCathy Anderson, the chief executive officer of the San DiegoFilm Commission, a nonprofit group that promotes the county as alocation for movies and television, said she also has a hard timeconfirming rumors about local celebrities.\n\n“The problem is, they usually come here in hiding to get away,”she said.\n\nShe’s not surprised that celebrities live here.\n\n“It’s due to their proximity to work,” she said. “Some peopleonly have a part-time home here. It’s enough to get away fromtraffic and smog and all the negative stuff.”\n\nAnderson said she learns that some celebrities have lived in thearea only after they’ve listed their homes for sale, which is howshe discovered that singer Janet Jackson owned a house in RanchoSanta Fe. She also recalled hearing that Barbra Streisand onceowned a home in North County.\n\nAn online forum created a few years ago asked people to sharetheir personal celebrity sightings in San Diego. Among the entriesfrom 2008 was a claim that actress Geena Davis lives in RanchoSanta Fe and often uses a dry cleaners in Solana Beach.\n\nOther former residents of Rancho Santa Fe include Microsoftfounder Bill Gates. The late actor Victor Mature also lived inRancho Santa Fe. Fitness expert Judi Sheppard Missett andweight-loss business owner Jenny Craig live and run their companiesfrom coastal North County.\n\nActress Marion Ross of the popular ’70s TV sitcom “Happy Days”lives in Cardiff and actor Abe Vigoda of “Barney Miller” and “TheGodfather” is said to live in Rancho Bernardo.\n\nMany Murray sightings\n\nWhile they may like to keep a low profile, even celebrities haveto get out of the house to shop, play golf or show up for theoccasional court date.\n\nFormer Pauma Valley resident Bill Murray had his day in court inApril 2008 when he appeared in Vista for a hearing about a propertyeasement dispute.\n\nValley Center resident Charles Carr said he knows several peoplewho had “Murray encounters” a few years ago.\n\n“He would drive around town in his Rolls and he would show upall over town,” said Carr, a North County Times columnist.\n\n“I heard from several people that he’d say this was near enoughto Hollywood that he could drive there to do ‘Charlie’s Angels,’but then come back here because it’s like Shangri-La.”\n\nBut Murray, who has a reputation for being so private thatdirectors sometimes have had trouble tracking him down for movieoffers, was uncomfortable being recognized, Carr said.\n\n“He’d be at the local irrigation place buying sprinklers for hislawn,” Carr said. “And you could talk to Murray for as long as youwanted … about sprinklers, or what the weather was like,anything. But the minute you’d start to talk to him about BillMurray, he’d disappear like a puff of smoke.”\n\nMusicians find a home\n\nOne of the hottest pop punk bands of the 1990s and 2000s,blink-182, formed in Poway and its members still call North Countyhome. Poway singer Steve Vaus won a Grammy in the spoken-wordcategory last year for an album made under the name Bucky Howdy,and American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert is a Mt. Carmel HighSchool graduate.\n\nJack Tempchin may not be the most famous name in the county, butas the composer of the Eagles’ hits “Already Gone” and “Peaceful,Easy Feeling,” anybody who has owned a radio in the last 30 yearsknows his work.\n\nAn Encinitas resident since 1972, Tempchin said in recentinterviews that although he once lived in Los Angeles and stillowns a house there, his home is North County.\n\n“I’m not a surfer, but I like the ocean,” he said. “I don’t liketo go inland, frankly. The ocean affects the area within a coupleof miles. I don’t go shopping in Escondido. The ocean is likeyou’re on the edge of a great wilderness. It’s just like it alwayswas. There’s nature right there.”\n\nTempchin said there were not many opportunities for musicians inSan Diego County when he was starting out in the 1970s, so he andothers were drawn to L.A. for work.\n\n“You had to go there,” he said. “Really, I think it’s still likethat.”\n\nJason Mraz got his start singing in San Diego coffeehouses butmoved away before hitting it big. The two-time Grammy winner hasreturned to North County and owns an avocado farm nearFallbrook.\n\n“Ten years ago, I fell in love with the San Diego area and thefreedom one has to be active,” Mraz wrote in an e-mail. “I love tosurf. And when the conditions are right, I get out and do just thatin my spot. It sets the day up.\n\n“I am still able to spend a lot of time in NYC and LA andeverywhere else, so I really appreciate the balance I am able tohave between all the places I visit.”\n\nSinger songwriter Jewel Kilcher also got her start in NorthCounty, singing at Java Joe’s in Poway in the early 1990s. Knownprofessionally by her first name, Jewel went from living in her vanto a mansion in Rancho Santa Fe after her debut album soldmillions.\n\nSongwriter J.J. Cale rarely gives interviews and keeps a lowprofile at his Valley Center home, but the composer of “AfterMidnight” and “Cocaine” is not shy about letting people know wherehe lives.\n\nIn 2006, he even hinted at how to find him with his CD, “TheRoad to Escondido,” which he recorded with his friend EricClapton.\n\nRavi Shankar, perhaps the best-known sitar player outside India,has lived in Encinitas for years and reportedly played host toGeorge Harrison during an occasional visit from the lateex-Beatle.\n\nSinger Juice Newton, whose hits include “Angel in the Morning,””Queen of Hearts” and “The Sweetest Thing,” lives in Rancho SantaFe, and Patti Page, whose 1950 recording of “Tennessee Waltz” wasone of the biggest-selling singles of the 20th century, lives inDel Mar.\n\nOn the other end of the sonic spectrum, Megadeath guitarist DaveMustaine, a native of La Mesa, lives in Fallbrook.\n\nSome artists already are living in North County and never see areason for leaving.\n\nJanell Cannon, artist and author of a successful string ofchildren’s books that include “Stellaluna” and “Pinduli,” has livedin Carlsbad since she created her first successful characters whileworking for the Carlsbad library.\n\n“Winter temperatures average 50-65 degrees above zero and mostdays are sunny,” she said in explaining why she never moved.\n\nSan Marcos resident Greg Evans, creator of the popular teencomic strip “Luann,” said he used to keep an apartment in Burbankbecause of his frequent trips to Los Angeles to meet withtelevision executives interested in his characters, but he neverwanted to move.\n\n“San Marcos is home,” he said in a recent interview. “Whenever Igo to the L.A. area, I feel as though I need to rev up, acceleratethe pace, even though I’m usually bogged in traffic.\n\n“And the vastness of the place is un-embraceable. In San Marcos,there’s a sense of involvement, of inclusion. Living here ismanageable. You don’t feel like an insignificant speck of humanity.You feel like your presence really makes a difference in thecommunity, whether you’re a gardener, a cashier or just acartoonist.”\n\nA history of stars\n\nThe region has a long history of attracting notables from thefilm industry. Some even laid the groundwork for popularattractions and neighborhoods.\n\nBing Crosby, Pat O’Brien, Jimmy Durante and Oliver Hardy foundedthe Del Mar Racetrack, and actor Leo Carrillo’s former Carlsbadranch is now open to the public.\n\nDouglas Fairbanks and his then-wife Mary Pickford once plannedto develop an estate called Rancho Zorro near Rancho Santa Fe.Today, the area is called Fairbanks Ranch.\n\nLegendary film director Frank Capra owned a ranch in Fallbrookfrom 1932 to 1972, but Valley Center was the greater attraction formany others in the business. From the 1930s to the 1950s, some ofthe biggest names in Hollywood left their limos and mansions behindfor horses and ranch houses.\n\n“People have always asked us what brought these stars here, andI haven’t the foggiest idea how they even knew the place,” ValleyCenter historian Bob Lerner told the North County Times in2004.\n\nJohn Wayne, Gary Cooper, Fred Astaire, Randolph Scott, SteveReeves and the husband-and-wife team of June Allyson and DickPowell all lived for a time in Valley Center.\n\nThe community has so many celebrity connections that the ValleyCenter History Museum last year hosted an exhibit about formerresidents who had won Oscars.\n\nFormer residents spotlighted in the exhibit included FredAstaire, Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray, Gary Cooper,”Wuthering Heights” lead actress Merle Oberon, John Wayne, “BenHur” producer Sam Zimbalist, art director Gordon Wiles andchoreographer Ernie Flatt.\n\nValley Center also lured more than Hollywood stars. Britishnobleman Lord Summerville once called the valley home, Lerner said,bringing North County a touch of royalty when Edward VIII, thePrince of Wales, came to visit his fellow countryman.\n\nThe Golden Era stars are gone, but keen-eyed movie fans canstill catch a glimpse of Valley Center’s past because ofSummerville.\n\nThe nobleman’s ranch reportedly was used as a shooting locationfor the 1944 Errol Flynn movie “Uncertain Glory” and 20 years lateras one of the locations in “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.”\n\nStaff writer Jim Trageser contributed to this report.
