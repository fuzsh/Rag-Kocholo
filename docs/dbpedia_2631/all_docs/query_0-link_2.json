        "text": "German Argentines (in Spanish referred as germano argentinos) are made up of Argentines of German descent, as well as Germans who became Argentine citizens.\n\nPlease, note that ethnic Germans not only lived within the German borders of their time, but there were many communities of ethnic Germans living in other parts of Europe, especially before WWII. The German language and culture have traditionally been more important than the country of origin, as the basis of the ethnic and national consciousness of the Germans (Germany as a political entity was founded as late as 1871). Therefore, the political places from which these people or their ascendants emigrated to Argentina may vary. For example, Volga Germans arrived from the Russian Empire, most of Danube Swabians did it from the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today Hungary, Romania, etc.), etc. Likewise, there are multi-ethnic European states such as Switzerland, which has a German Swiss population with their own German language, while French and Italian-speaking citizens inhabit other regions of the country, retaining their differences even today. Austrians, on the other hand, were historically regarded as ethnic Germans and viewed themselves as such.[1][2][3] As can be seen, the large population of German ethnicity occupied an area of several present-day countries. Citizenship is the mere legal condition of belonging to one state or another, while nationality or ethnicity is related to anthropological and sociological aspects and thus has an extraterritorial character.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of some notable German Argentines. In it, German surnames abound. However, an amount several times this number is estimated for notable Argentines of partial German descent who do not have German surnames.\n\nAcademia\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcella Althaus-Reid (professor of contextual theology and writer)\n\nMaría Teresa A.
