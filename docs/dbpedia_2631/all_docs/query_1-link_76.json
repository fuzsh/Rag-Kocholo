        "text": "Liga Deportiva : Cevallos, Norberto Araujo, Calle, Campos,\n\nCalderon, Reasco, Urrutia, William Araujo, Manso, Luis Bolanos, Bieler.\n\nSubs: Dominguez, Ambrossi, Obregon, Delgado, Eder Vaca,\n\nDanny Vaca, Navia, Larrea, Chango, Viteri.\n\nMan Utd: Van der Sar, Rafael Da Silva, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Carrick, Anderson, Park, Tevez, Rooney.\n\nSubs: Kuszczak, Neville, Berbatov, Giggs, Nani, Scholes, Welbeck, O'Shea, Evans, Fletcher, Gibson, Amos.\n\nPreamble: Morning everyone. Here's everything I know about Manchester United's opponents today: they're from Equador, they're the Copa Libertadores Champions and Agustin Delgado, who Celtic and former Southampton manager Gordon Strachan famously rated as being less important than a pot of yoghurt, is on the bench for them.\n\nPre-match niceties: Some disturbingly phallic inflatable \"things\" make their way off the pitch and the teams prepare for action. Manchester United are in their usual home strip, while Liga De Quito play in black shirts, socks and shorts.\n\n1 min: Tip. Tap. Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez do the honours. Game on.\n\n2 min: Claudio Bieler gets an early yellow card for a body-check on Cristiano Ronaldo in the centre-circle. Cue: obligatory comment about naive Ecuadorian walking a discliplinary tight-rope etc and so on.\n\n3 min: How did he how did he how did he? An astonishing miss by Alejandro Manso. Liga De Quito won a free-kick about 40 yards out from the Manchester United goal, on the right hand side. With everyone expecting a cross to the far post, Luis Bolanos prodded the ball about 20 yards straight ahead of him towards the near one, where Alejandro Manso, with only Van Der Sar to beat, somehow contrived to put the ball wide.\n\n6 min: While I was typing up that Manso miss, Carlos Tevez went close for Manchester United. Some neat, short passing resulted in him being put through on goal, but Liga De Quito goalkeeper Jose Cevallos darted off his line and got down to smother the ball.\n\n9 min: A wonderful pass from Michael Carrick, who picks out Wayne Rooney with an inch-perfect 40-yard box to box pass. Rooney chests down the ball on the edge of the Liga De Quito penalty area and unleashes a volley. Cevallos parries.\n\n11 min: Ronaldo picks up the ball on the left hand side. Stepover, stepover, stepover ... followed by a low drilled pass across the edge of the six-yard box. Campos sticks it out for a corner, from which nothing comes.\n\n13 min: \"With regard to those who criticised you for not posting descriptions of the goals in the Gamba Osaka v Man Utd match quickly enough I'd like to say that I followed the semi-final on both the Guardian MBM and Man Utd Matchtracker and your postings for every goal appeared far more quickly (usually by several minutes) than matchtracker's,\" writes Charles S. Yeah, go me!\n\n15 min: From inside his own half, Michael Carrick sends another touchdown pass towards Rooney, who controls and shoots from 25 yards, stinging the palms of Cevallos. Another corner for Manchester United, from which nowt comes.\n\n16 min: More nimble-footed chicanary from Cristiano Ronaldo, who cuts inside on the edge of the Liga De Quito penalty area, before teeing up Carlos Tevez. The Argentinian scuffs a feeble shot harmlessly wide.\n\n18 min: A self-confessed pedant writes: \"Sorry, but the pedant in me just can't resist pointing out that United's usual home strip is red shirts, white shorts and black socks,\" writes Roland M. \"Which they will have changed to white so as not to clash with the all-in-black Ecuadorians. Hope this helps. Now I'm off to do something interesting with my life.\" Good luck with that, Roland.\n\n19 min: Ronaldo curls in a low cross for Carlos Tevez, whose shot from close range looks goal-bound until goalkeeper Jose Cevallas performs heroics to get down and parry the ball on to the upright. Liga De Quito are getting a pasting here.\n\n21 min: Wonderful pass from Anderson, who sends a 30 yard pass, complete with helpful backspin, into the path of Wayne Rooney. He beats the offside trap, Cevallos rushes off his line , the ball bounces on the edge of the penalty area and Rooney lifts it over keeper and crossbar, on to the roof of the net.\n\n24 min: Quito No7 Luis Bolanos tries a shot from distance, but pulls his low, diagonal drive across the face of goal and hopelessly wide. On Five, top pundit Stanley Victor Collymore is saying Liga De Quito have been too cautious and need to \"come out and be a bit more adventurous\".\n\n28 min: It's the question you've all been pondering and I can now give you a definitive answer: LDQ players Norberto and William Araujo are not - repeat not! - related.\n\n29 min: A low, long-range 25-yarder from Michael Carrick fizzes about two feet wide of the left upright. Cevallos ushers the ball wide.\n\n32 min: Free-kick for Manchester United, 35 yards out on the right hand side of the field. Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand plod up to the penalty area, only to see the Brazilian send his delivery high and wide. His delivery is soo poor he immediately raises a hand by way of apology.\n\n34 min: Great skill by Wayne Rooney, who beats his marker in midfield, plays a give-and-go to Carlos Tevez, gets the ball back and flicks it out right to Park Ji-sung. Through on goal but shooting from a narrow angle, the South Korean fires straight at the keeper, who parries the ball out for a corner. From the ensuing inswinger, Rio Ferdinand heads narrowly wide.\n\n37 min: Liga De Quito get a rare shot on goal, in so much as a shot that fizzes 20 yards over the crossbar can be considered \"on goal\". Their playmaker Alkejandro Manso - a classic No10, albeit with No21 on his back - picked up the ball just outside the centre-circle, galloped about 25 yards and tried his luck.\n\n40 min: Manchester United play the ball down the middle, Rooney picks it up in midfield and strokes it out to Carlos Tevez on the overlap. The Argentinian shoots and stings the palms of Cevallos in the Quito goal again. Moments later, a speculative Rooney effort forces him to make another smart save.\n\n42 min: The referee and Quito goalkeeper Cevallos are having a frank exchange of views over which side of the six-yard box the latter should take a goal-kick from. Has it come to this?\n\n44 min: Inside his own half, Anderson sends a raking 50-yard pass from right-to-left that drops beautifully for Park Ji-Sung in the Quito penalty area. He tries to lift it over the onrushing goalkeeper and into the net, but makes a dog's breakfast of his effort and sends it wide.\n\nHalf-time: The players from both teams trudge off after an opening half in which Manchester United slaughtered their Ecuadorian opponents 0-0. I'm off to make a much-needed cup of tea. I'll be back in 10 minutes.\n\nGary Naylor is alive and well: \"Just looked at your photo of Cristiano, read Liga de Quito in the headline and thought: 'Ah, he's admitted to a Spanish paper that he's quitting the Premier League'. But that headline will have to wait for six months I suppose,\" he writes. I hope the boy Naylor won't mind me saying this, but that's a poor effort. I can see what he was trying to do there but it didn't quite work.\n\nSecond half: \"It was a poor effort, but I've been watching cricket since 3.30am - so I've mitigation!\" writes Gary Naylor. I haven't been watching cricket, but I heard with great glee that top batsman Ian Bell scored a magnificent 1. I've an ongoing bet - for no money, just pride - with my cricket-writing colleague Lawrence Booth that Bell will finish his career with a career Test average of less than 45. As he's a great man for scoring 800s against the likes of Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, I'll probably lose, but it's certainly a rollercoaster ride. It's a tricky one for Booth, whose reputation is on the line. Being shown up as clueless by an Irish muck-savage who knows nothing about cricket would be a sorry legacy.\n\n48 min: Meanwhile back at the sport I'm actually supposed to be covering, Nemanja Vidic has been shown a straight red card for elbowing Claudio Bieler in the face as they attempted to extricate themselves from an on-the-floor tangle after contesting a 50-50 ball. It was something and nothing, more of a shrug than an assault, but the Argentinian made a meal of it and the referee had very little option but to give the Serb his marching orders.\n\n51 min: Manchester United deck-shuffling: Jonny Evans on, Carlos Tevez off.\n\n52 min: Rooney gallops down the left touchline with the ball at his feet. He sends in a cross for Park Ji-sung on the edge of the six-yard box, but Quito 'keeper Jose Cevallos cuts it out at the near post.\n\n55 min: Rooney picks up the ball on the left wing and plays a short pass to Ronaldo on the edge of the penalty area. He cuts inside, shoots and the ball takes a deflection off a defender before forcing Cevallos into action.\n\n57 min: \"Who are you for?\" asks Jacqueline Tordoir, clearly in no mood to beat around the bush. To be honest, I'm \"for\" a win for either team in 90 minutes, Jacqueline. I've lots to get done in order to clear the decks before heading home to my mammy in Ireland for Christmas tomorrow, so I could really do without extra time and penalties.\n\n57 min: Free-kick for Manchester United, straight in front of goal about 40 yards out. Cristiano Ronaldo stands over it, does his best pre-kick Jonny Wilkinson impression and strikes it. Much like Jonny Wilkinson would have done, he thumps it over the bar.\n\n61 min: A half-hearted penalty appeal from Park Ji-sung falls on deaf ears. \"Presumably Vidic will get a suspension for getting sent off for violent conduct, but in which competition?\" asks Sam Walton. \"I'm guessing it won't be the Champions League because it's Uefa-run, although it would be good if it were. if he's suspended for the next two games that he plays in a Fifa competition that's a bit toothless, as it's unlikely he'll play in the World Cup or another World Club Cup.\" I have no idea what suspension he'll have to serve or when, Sam. Anyone have any ideas?\n\n65 min: According to the lads on Five, Vidic will, at the very least, be suspended for the first leg of their Big Cup tie with Internazionale.\n\n66 min: The camera lingers on the visage of Quito goalkeeper Jose Cevallos, who looks like the Ecuadorian cousin of G2 features writer Partrick Barkham.\n\n70 min: Free-kick for Manchester United, wide on the left. Ronaldo drives it into the penalty area, Jairo Campos drives it back out. Anderson and - I think - Claudio Bieler have been shown yellow cards for mistimed lunges in recent minutes.\n\nGOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Liga De Quito (Rooney 72) Another raking pass from Carrick, who picks out Ronaldo on the edge of the penalty area. He plays the ball to Rooney on his left, who opens his body (not literally, that would be hideous) and sends a low diagonal drive across the face of goal and into the bottom right-hand corner. Ten-man Manchester United are a goal up. In the Quito goal, Norfolk-born (I think) Guardian features writer Patrick Barkham had no chance.\n\n76 min: The Quito manager takes out his shepherd's crook and hauls off central defender Renan Calle. Ecuadorian international Paul Ambrosi takes his place.\n\n78 min: United attack, with Park thundering down the left wing before picking out Rooney on the edge of the penalty area, just outside the D. He makes room for a shot, which is blocked.\n\n80 min: Oh it might fall here for ...\" exalts Five commentator, before it doesn't fall there for Claudio Bieler. Thank God. Up with extra time and penalties I will not put.\n\n82 min: Manchester United substitution: Pedro Lareo on, Nelcer Reasco off.\n\n83 min: Manchester United substitution ahoy! Gary Neville will replace Rafael Da Silva any minute now.\n\n84 min: United win a throw-in, make their substitution and attack down the left wing. Quito clear.\n\n86 min: \"Quick MU, get this one over - grab the cup and get a giant Toyota key for Rooney,\" writes Mario Rustan. \"Singapore v Vietnam match is already started. Singapore's No10, anyway, is a John Wilkinson. A bloke from Exeter.\"\n\n87 min: Quito attack with Alejandro Manso, their class act, rampaging through the middle. Patrice Evra puts a stop to his gallop. Manchester United substitution: Anderson off, Darren Fletcher on.\n\n87 min: Jairo Campos tries a shot from all of 50 yards. Wide as a ditch.\n\n89 min: Great shot from Claudiuo Bieler, who pulls the trigger from 25 yards and forces Edwin van der Sar to paw the ball out for a corner, from which Manchester United counter-attack and almost go two up courtesy of Cristiano Ronaldo. Cevallos beats him to a 50-50 ball on the edge of the Quito penalty area and saves.\n\n90+2 min: Peep! Peep! Peep! It's all over - Manchester United are the club champions of the world, having secured a victory that seems to be on a par with a Community Shield win, for all the delight being shown by their players. They look pleased with a job well done, but there's no passion or triumphalism on show at all. That said, some of the Quito players look gutted, not least their goalkeeper who's leaning against one of the uprights looking thoroughly fed up. He had a good game - only for him, Quito would have been hammered.\n\n90+3 min: I'm going to go out on a limb here and predict that Manchester United will be presented with a big trophy on the temporary stage that will almost certainly be erected in the centre-circle. Then there'll be anm explosion of ticker-tape, some celebratory jumping-up-and-down-on-the-spot, a rendition of \"champ-ee-own-ees\" and then back home to Blighty and Stoke City on Boxing Day. That's me done - thanks for your time and your emails. Merry Christmas everyone and a very happy and prosperous new year to you all."
