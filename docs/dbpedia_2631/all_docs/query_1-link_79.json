        "text": "Oh, it all sounded great…\n\nThree nights at a posh hotel and a plane ticket for just 400 bucks. Yep, one of those last minute travel deals online. Well, they meant well, I guess. Hey, it was Vegas, last minute, the Mandalay Bay Hotel, a nice spot right near the airport near everything.\n\nThat’s where it all went wrong.\n\nFirst off Las Vegas used to be a nonstop trip on several airlines. Southwest, U.S. Air, Frontier, United and others left almost every hour all day and into the evening. The flights lasted just under three hours, and on the way back with a tailwind, maybe 2 hours 15 minutes. Continue reading →\n\nHere is your Christmas gift Kansas City…\n\nChiefs coach Romeo Crennel retires next week after Denver beats us and general manager Scott Pioli is fired. Matt Cassel has been told goodbye already.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nAs one of the nation’s top pick experts again, this is my call on the Chiefs.\n\nSadly they may keep Brady Quinn as a back up. The team has enough problems and jobs to fill. Quinn’s so-so performance Sunday may earn him the Chiefs backup role. Continue reading →\n\nAs a reviewer and observer of the movie scene in general I hate it when someone tells me how disappointed they were with a new movie they just saw at their multiplex…\n\nThat shouldn’t happen.\n\nIt’s bad for the viewers who dropped 10 bucks on a ticket and were left with a bad taste in their mouths. And it reflects poorly on the industry in general.\n\nCase in point, Universal’s :”THIS IS 40″ starring Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann.\n\nDuring the past few days several people have expressed their dislike of the movie. They went to the theater expecting to see the rip-roaring sequel to Judd Apatow’s 2007 comedy hit KNOCKED UP.\n\nWhat they got instead was over two hours of mid-life crisis with more focus on dramatics than comedy.\n\nThey felt ripped off. Continue reading →\n\nAfter listening to all the opinions about how to stop the violence, I see one good answer…\n\nTo protect children at schools the only worthwhile answer so far is that we need to post armed guards at them period. It’s an expensive but strong deterrent to violence.\n\nThe crazy guys will think twice about walking onto a school property with armed guards all over the place. It will prevent many further attacks from happening at schools.\n\nNothing else I’ve heard seems to matter much, including stronger gun laws. Continue reading →\n\nI promise to give you the best bowl game picks…\n\nNot too many, right? My faves now are Vanderbilt and Alabama, both to cover and win. I’ll give you some more next week.\n\nThis week it’s march to the playoffs time and my top three teams in each league, as of today, are: NFC 1) San Francisco 2) Atlanta 3) Green Bay (dark horse,Seattle).\n\nAFC: 1) Houston 2) New England 3) Denver (darkhorse, nobody – neither the Colts or Bengals can make the Super Bowl).\n\nThis week’s picks coming up. Continue reading →\n\nLike it or not, it’s that time of year. The stockings have been hung by the chimney with care, some guy named Black Pete may or may not be coming to frighten your children to death, and everyone everywhere (except in unholy nations who do not believe in a Jesus-person rising from the dead) is eagerly anticipating the spoils of Christmas morn.\n\nUnfortunately, our economy is robustly in the shitter. This is an undeniable truth plagued by still-catastrophic unemployment numbers (we know, we know—it’s been widely reported that our numbers are “the best they’ve been in years!” but we also know the statistics these figures fail to incorporate), a lack of borrowing ability, Obamacare concerns, money markets paying 0.01% interest and the inevitable “Thelma and Louise convertible ride” toward the terrifying reality of a fiscal cliff crash.\n\nBut hey—Christmas waits for no man, regardless of socioeconomic status. Your kid needs a Tickle-Monster-Elmo, a refurbished Furby and a bike that will resolutely be stolen the moment they lock it up outside at the bike-rack of their unaccredited school.\n\nSo before you embarrass yourself by touching your cousin’s boob at your family Christmas engagement, get your shopping done in style… on Craigslist. For free.\n\nYou’re welcome in advance. Continue reading →\n\nDoes anybody today even remember who sang the song?\n\nYou know, “White Christmas.”\n\nOr does it even matter anymore unless you’re well over the age of 40? Probably not.\n\nWhat does seem to matter is that pretty much anybody and everybody – heathens even – are probably hoping for snow on Christmas Day this coming Tuesday.\n\nOr at least have some on the ground, right? Continue reading →\n\nChristmas is a magical time of year where, all over the world, regardless of age, race, sex, religion or socioeconomic status, people everywhere stop and recognize Santa Claus as their one true God.\n\nOne needn’t be Christian to appreciate the majesty of Christmas; Buddhists, Jews, Hindus and Mooslims far and wide recognize that in 33 AD, the world became a better place because Santa Claus rose from his cross and gave toys to crippled orphans living in the desert. And Philadelphia, I think.\n\nThe infallible truth that CHRIST-CLAUS IS SUPREME has built a cottage industry around the little holiday that initially began as a creative workshop idea of Walt Disney and Sam Walton; today, there are MILLIONS of ways to celebrate Christmas, from a simple, festive sweater to a sweaty make out session with someone who isn’t your wife in the chemical closet at an office-sanctioned “Winter-Festivities” party. Continue reading →\n\nPresident Obama feels he inherited a mess from the Founding Fathers…\n\nHe can’t fix what has happened during the last 236 years in four years.\n\nBut President Obummer sure spent more in four years than all the other presidents combined. Our dollar will be history in four years as world reserve currency. Continue reading →\n\nWe all know about KU’s great basketball program…\n\nWhat we don’t hear enough about is their fantastic drama department. Years ago it launched Missouri born actor Don Johnson to big time stardom.\n\nIn 1982 my agent, Harold Moskowitz called me and my crime partner Don Woodbeck in for a quick meeting. Both of us had moved to Hollywood and we had a deal on a movie about our lives called OUTLAWS. Basically two guys – us – posing as cops who weren’t but later became real lawmen. Nice. The media had jumped on it and we got lots of press in the LA Times, Today Show, Variety and so on.\n\nLittle did I know at the time that this would be the peak of that project for decades to come. Because now we were famous outlaw/lawmen – at least in LA and in the media. Continue reading →\n\nNewsweek gives a nod to KC Mayor Sly James on its year-end list of Top 5 “Most Innovative Mayors in the U.S.” He lobbied to get Google Fiber (after KCK) and has helped transform KC into a “Midwestern tech mecca.” Once again, our top story; Newsweek is still publishing magazines. For what, two more weeks?\n\n*******\n\nPolice are looking for someone who stole 41 Arrowhead Stadium parking signs that cost $1,000 each. So far the only people they’ve ruled out are Royals base runners.\n\n******* Continue reading →\n\nThey’re dropping like flies at the Kansas City Star…\n\nAs expected, Hunger Games victim Dawn Bormann is takings a layoff bullet, in deference to fellow reporter Karen Dillon, who, with seniority opted to remain at the newspaper. Bormann is telling co-workers that she’s looking forward to spending more time with her family.\n\nAlso last week, religion editor Helen Gray announced that she would retire, as did one of my favorite editors Bill Dalton (more on those later).\n\nThe latest: House + Home section editor Stacy Downs will join former Star editor Anne Spenner, the Vice Chancellor of Marketing and Communications at UMKC. Continue reading →\n\nWhen it comes to THE GUILT TRIP, Barbra Streisand as a mom takes Jewish Mother Stereotyping about as far as it can go in an adult targeted comedy…\n\nA little of that neurotic, over the top nagging and miserly attitude almost wore me out.\n\nSure Streisand delivered similarily as mother (Roz) Focker in those earlier family outings. But there she was surrounded by a heavy talent pool.\n\nHere she’s the nagging, widowed mom of down on his luck chemist/inventor son Seth Rogen who invites her along on his cross-country road trip. A business trip to pitch his newly invented cleaning product to the likes of Costco and K-Mart. Continue reading →\n\nSo here’s the thing about the KC Confidential Christmas Wilding…\n\nFor starters, it’s happening tomorrow – Wednesday, December 19th from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. – at the Conspiracy Room located inside the Uptown Theater.\n\nWell, OK, several things.\n\nFirst of all, what the hell is a “wilding?” From what I can tell, the word refers to marauding bands of youths that terrorize random people on the streets. So, hmm… I suppose that is somewhat accurate actually. I mean, Lefty, Glaze, and HC will be there. Continue reading →\n\nIn the aftermath of the Connecticut school shootings, the “solution” always goes back to the simplistic notion that banning guns will somehow prevent tragedies like this from happening…\n\nThis notion ignores the fact that someone who wants to commit violent acts will find a means of accessing a firearm. As was done in this case…\n\nThe mass murderer in this case, Mr. Lanza, was denied the ability to purchase a rifle from a Danbury, CT. gun shop- earlier that week, according to NBC News. So he simply went to “Plan B” and stole his mother’s guns.\n\nBut what if assault weapons were banned? Continue reading →\n\n“These tragedies must end,” said the President of the United States on his televised speech to the nation regarding the latest in a long, long, long line of school massacres….\n\nThe latest in Newton, Connecticut, left at least 26 dead, more than half young children. The horror! The killer, another young white male, out of his mind, who really knows why. There have been countless meaningless rampages like this one recently, from Columbine, the Batman theater shootings, mall shootings, other school shootings, work place shootings and even here in Kansas City at Ward Parkway. And don’t forget the political shootings, like Arizona and of course the bombings of government buildings. All by Americans.\n\nMaybe we’re more dangerous than the terrorists? Continue reading →"
