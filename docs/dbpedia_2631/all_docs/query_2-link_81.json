From there it is possible to cross the Paraná River using a raft service and boats that go to the city of Goya in Corrientes. The Port of Reconquista is located on the Riacho San Gerónimo, at km 949 of the Paraná River and 317 km north of the capital of Santa Fe. The wharf is 900 meters long, with a good depth, the access channel to the port has the advantage that the river current, from north to south, performs self-dredging naturally and permanently. The Port Area covers a width of 50 meters, with a paved interior street and an area of ​​4.2 ha to store products. It has four sheds dependent on the Administrative Entity of the Reconquista Port (Santa Fe Province). In addition, the port has oil tank silos with a crude vegetable oil storage capacity of 1,500 m³. The main activities of the port are associated with moving crude vegetable oil, expeller, pellets and oilseed grains to ports in the south of the province; sand and stones are also used for construction.\n\nView Details\n\nThe Port of Santa Fe is located in the heart of the Paraguay - Paraná Waterway (km. 584 of the Paraná River), being, upstream, the last overseas port suitable for operations with ocean vessels. Its strategic location makes it the right link to unite the transport nodes (land-river-oceanic), allowing the development of national and international cabotage and international maritime operations, for unitized, containerized, bulk, general cargo, etc. to and from its Hinterland made up of the Central, NOA and NEA Regions of the Argentine Republic. Likewise, its privileged position geographically outlines it as the obligatory center for cargo transfers to and from the countries located on the Waterway. The road network links the Port of Santa Fe with the regional economies that can use its docks as an alternative for exporting their products and importing their supplies. This port occupies a place that marks it as a converging node in the transport of cargo to and from the main areas of the Province and the Regions that make up its Hinterland, which has as its southern limit the axis city of Santa Fe - city of Córdoba. To the North, National Route 11 connects it with the city of Clorinda opposite Asunción in Paraguay; to the East, it is the terminal point of National Route 18 that crosses Entre Ríos; to the west, it is the starting point of National Route 19 - bi-oceanic - which, extending with 20, leads to Córdoba, San Juan, San Luis, Mendoza and Chile; towards the Northwest, through National Route No. 34, it links with Santiago del Estero and Tucumán, guaranteeing an extraordinary contribution of goods that can be transported by river, and inserting us as an obligatory port for transferring fluvial - oceanic cargo and becoming a preponderant factor for the natural exit of productions for export and the gateway for the import of its inputs, fully solving the complex transportation system in the country and in Mercosur.\n\nView Details\n\nPort of Villa Constitucion This commercial port for public use is located on the right bank of the Main Navigation Channel of the Paraná River. It starts at km. 365 of the Paraná River, in the section of the waterway suitable for the entry of overseas ships, developed on an arm of the water course and protected by an artificial dam. Communication between Villa Constitución and the Atlantic Ocean occurs through the navigation route made up of these sections: Paraná Inferior, Paraná de las Palma, Río de la Plata. Between Km. 360 and 365 of the Paraná River, on the left bank there is the area called \"Rada and Maneuvering Zone\", with an anchoring capacity for 5 overseas ships, without length limits, not presenting depth problems and allowing the possibility of an extension of the same, according to the topographical conditions of the place. Currently, this port is managed by the Administrative Entity of the Port of Villa Constitución and has two well-differentiated zones: the northern zone, also called overseas, and the southern or cabotage zone. In addition, it is also made up of a terminal elevator (Unit I) with an operable site, the Port Services dock (Unit II) with two docking fronts, the cabotage dock and the Acindar docks in Puerto Acevedo. Its main activities are oriented to shipments of grains and oilseeds, concentrating most of them in the dock of Unit II (elevator of Port Services) concessioned to the same company that operates the loading facilities of Unit I. Located 55 kilometres south of Rosario and 230 kilometres from Buenos, it becomes a strategic space for international trade and export development, since it is located in the centre of the Paraná - Paraguay Waterway, and in the heart of the industrial axis La Silver - Rosary.
