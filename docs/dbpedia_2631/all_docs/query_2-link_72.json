        "text": "Workers aligned with the Federation of Municipal Workers Unions of the Province of Santa Fe (Federacion de Sindicatos de Trabajadores Municipales de la Provincia de Santa Fe, FESTRAM) plan to strike in Santa Fe Province, May 13. The action is over a salary dispute. A related demonstration will occur at the Provincial Autonomous Institute of Social Work (Instituto Autarquico Provincial de Obra Social). The start time of the event is unclear.\n\nDisruptions to municipal services are likely throughout the province on May 13; however, the short duration of the action is likely to translate into a minimal overall disruption. Police may deploy to the protest site to manage the attendees. Significant disruptions are unlikely. Some localized road travel delays may occur."
