        "text": "Santa Fe, provincia (province) of lowland plains, northeastern Argentina. It is bounded to the east by the Paraná River. Much of the province lies within the northern reaches of the Pampa, but in the subtropical northeast it has marshes, tall savannas, and clusters of woodland, and the subtropical dry forests of the northwest consist largely of thorny shrubs and low trees. The city of Santa Fe, on the Paraná, is the provincial capital.\n\nThe province was settled in the late 16th century by Spaniards from Asunción, Paraguay, but it long remained a sparsely populated area exporting yerba maté (a tealike beverage). Into the early 19th century it repeatedly experienced malónes (violent Indian attacks) and epidemics. Not until the mid-1850s, when Rosario (in the southeast) was made the official port of the Argentine Confederation, did stable economic growth begin. Thereafter, Santa Fe developed as the centre of immigrant agricultural colonias (colonies) and commercial grain production."
