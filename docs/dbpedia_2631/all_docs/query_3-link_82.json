Museum Hill\n\nSanta Fe stands as a renowned hub for those who cherish museums, yet the presence of over a dozen museums throughout the city poses a challenge to see them all within just a day or two.

LORETTO CHAPEL\n\nA standout architectural masterpiece in Santa Fe is the Loretto Chapel, positioned just to the south of the Santa Fe Plaza. Legend has it that following nine days of prayers by the Sisters of Loretto for assistance in finishing their chapel, a mysterious individual arrived.\n\nThis person, using only basic tools and without any witnesses, constructed the renowned Miraculous Staircase and then vanished before the sisters had the chance to compensate or express their gratitude to him. Regardless of its mysterious beginnings, both the chapel and its staircase stand as stunning creations worthy of a visit.\n\nThis article was posted by Cheryl Fallstead"
