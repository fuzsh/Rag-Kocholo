        "text": "Summary\n\nSanta Fe is an inland city located 466 kilometers north of Buenos Aires. Santa Feâs annual population growth from 1995-2015 was 2.86% and its total population is currently 489,505 (World Bank, 2017; UN-HABITAT, 2016). The city is bordered by two rivers, making it flood prone and increasing the risk of vector-borne diseases such as dengue. Of the 115 informal neighborhoods in Santa Fe, 28 (24%) are on floodplains. Santa Fe also has security issues related to illicit activities. The cityâs government has prioritized resilience and is the first city in Argentina to develop a resilience plan. Santa Fe is a strategically important city because it serves as the areaâs social, cultural, economic, and political center for the surrounding agricultural region.\n\nGoals\n\nThis project aims to improve health outcomes by developing data for unmapped neighborhoods in the floodplain and analyzing existing infrastructure and gaps.\n\nLead Partner\n\nAtlas Smart Cities\n\nSupporting Partners"
