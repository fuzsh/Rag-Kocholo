        "text": "Bukhara is the capital of the Bukhara Province of Uzbekistan, acting as a beacon of cultural prominence, with its history reaching as far back as 6 BCE. Located on the Silk Road, the city has been exposed to thousands of years of cultural diffusion, with the results being shown in its magnificent design and beauty. Bukhara acts as a city museum. Its architectural structures serve as works of art in their own right, with over 140 architectural monuments to appreciate within the city. Home to many mosques and madrassas, the center of Bukhara has been named by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site due to its architectural and historical significance.\n\nSanta Fe and Bukhara signed a Sister Cities agreement that highlights the many rich traditions and customs native to their regions, along with an intrinsic beauty that lies in their historic preservation and architecture. The cities continue to explore cultural opportunities between their communities.\n\nUnesco World Heritage\n\nVisit Uzbekistan Travel\n\nSister Cities Committee members Gilbert Delgado and Carol Robertson Lopez, with artists from Bukhara\n\nHolguin is located in the eastern part of Cuba just south of Cayo Largo, making it a tourist destination of choice for its warm temperatures during the winter months. The birthplace of Cuban music, Holguin, was founded as San Isidoro de Holguín in 1542 in the province of Oriente. It is documented that Christopher Columbus landed in Holguin in 1492 and said it was \"the eyes of the most beautiful country that man has ever seen.\" The Holguin province's capital is home to multiple cultural centers, including the galleries Centro Provincial de Arte and Bayado, multiple museums, and the Marti Theatre. As the capital of the second most populated province in the country, a main attraction is a large crucifix on the hill of Loma de la Cruz. As visitors ascend its 465 steps, they can take in the beauty of the whole city.\n\nA Sister Cities Agreement between Santa Fe and Holguin acknowledges that both share many rich traditions and customs native to their regions and should promote cultural and educational exchanges between the communities.\n\nAuthentic Cuba Travel\n\nwww.holguincuba.net\n\nCodanza (Holguin, Cuba), Photo Credit Carl Moore\n\nIcheon City is a village located in the Gyeonggi Province of South Korea. With a history shrouded in a ceramic culture that began over 5000 years ago, over 300 ceramic studios are centered around Sugwang-ri and Saum-dong in Sindun-myeon. This region has played a pivotal role in the city's reputation as the mecca of ceramics in Korea.\n\nIcheon has been designated a \"Special Ceramic Industry Zone\" with an infrastructure developed for specific commercial and industrial enterprises. Home to the only ceramic-specialized high school in Korea, the city also houses the only ceramic institution in Korea, the Korea Institute of Ceramic Engineering and Technology (KICET). Craft education plays an important role in the community and is divided into two parts, a formal education, and a lifelong education. The World Ceramic Biennale, the Icheon International Sculpture Symposium, and the Icheon Ceramic Festival are all hosted in Icheon.\n\nSanta Fe and Icheon signed a Sister Cities Agreement on November 18, 2013. Both cities have been awarded UNESCO designations, giving them a rich foundation for a Sister Cities relationship focusing on educational and cultural exchanges.\n\nIcheon Unesco Creative City\n\nKorea Tourism Association\n\nFormer Mayor Pro Tem Rebecca Wurzburger, former Mayor David Coss, and Mayor Cho from Icheon\n\nLivingstone is located in the Southern Province of Zambia, bordering Zimbabwe. The city has become a natural destination for travelers from around the world through its proximity to the Zambezi River and Victoria Falls. Named after David Livingstone, the first European to explore the area, the Kololo tribe described it as 'Mosi-oa-Tunya' – 'The smoke that thunders.' In more modern terms, Victoria Falls is known as one of the world's seven natural wonders. While the town has preserved much of its colonial character, it is a typical African town with a busy charm.\n\nLivingstone's contemporary culture blends traditions from over 70 ethnically diverse people. More than 20 annual traditional ceremonies are performed throughout the year, providing valuable insight into the customs and culture passed down from generation to generation. Rich in scenery and heritage, Livingstone has become the tourist heart of Zambia.\n\nIn June 2012, a Sister Cities Agreement was signed between Santa Fe and Livingstone officials. The two cities agreed they share many rich traditions and customs native to their regions and the intrinsic beauty of their perspective landscapes. Their agreement explores cultural and educational exchanges between the two cities.\n\nLivingstone Tourism Association\n\nZambia Tourism\n\nMayor Coss and members of the City of Livingston Fire Department\n\nLocated in the southern part of Chihuahua, Mexico, with a population of over 101,000, Hidalgo del Parral was named after Miguel Hidalgo, who is considered the 'Father of the Country.' According to legend, Juan Rangel de Biezma picked up a rock on the Cerro la Prieta (La Prieta Hill), licked it, and proclaimed, “There is a mineral deposit here.” That deposit produced silver for 340 years and shaped Parral as a major mining settlement. Influenced by the historic presence of Spaniards, the city is recognized as one of the most European-fashioned cities in Mexico. Associated with several historical figures, Parral is most celebrated for its association with Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa, who was assassinated there on July 20, 1923.\n\nThe most popular event of the city is the annual staging of the Murder of Pancho Villa, along with the annual Cabalgata Villista, a long-distance horse ride of thousands entering the city on horseback. Recreation props are used to re-enact the historical event, as well as coordinate the Cabalgata Villista.\n\nIn 1984, a Sister Cities Agreement was signed between officials from Santa Fe and Parral, acknowledging their many cultural and historical ties with the goal of strengthening cultural and educational exchanges between the cities.\n\nPresidencia Municipal de Hidalgo del Parral\n\nHidalgo del Parral\n\nMexconnect\n\nCabalgata Villista\n\nSan Miguel del Allende is located in central Mexico in the far eastern part of Guanajuato. The total population is close to 140,000. A historical center, the city dates back to 1764, with many of its buildings dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. San Miguel de Allende is known for being the birthplace of Ignacio Allende, whose surname was added to the town's name in 1826.\n\nSince the 1950s, San Miguel de Allende has developed a reputation as an artist's haven, attracting professional and amateur painters, sculptors, and printmakers to the classes and workshops. In addition to two major art institutions, Instituto Allende and Bellas Artes, art venues are found throughout the city. The city's largest celebration is the Fiestas de San Miguel de Allende. Held each year on September 29th, the Fiestas are named after the town's patron saint, the Archangel Michael.\n\nSanta Fe and San Miguel de Allende formalized their relationship during a ceremony on October 24, 2013. The two cities share many similarities, historically and culturally, making them a natural fit for a Sister Cities relationship. The Sister Cities' relationship highlights economic, educational, and cultural exchanges.\n\nCity of San Miguel de Allende\n\nSan Miguel de Allende Office of Tourism\n\nFrom left to right: Ricardo A.

Known as the \"Cradle of Hispanity,\" Santa Fe was the site of the Reconquista's culmination. One can thank this city for the existence of New Mexico's Santa Fe, as it was the meeting site of Catholic kings and Columbus to arrange funding for his travels to the East Indies. Although much of the original architecture of the city was destroyed in an earthquake, a few remnants still exist, namely the three monumental gates surrounding the area named \"Loja, Granda and Savilla,\" The Church of Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación, which dates back to the 18th century, and The Hermitage of Cristo de la Salud which dates back to the 15th century.\n\nGranada, Spain\n\nThe capital of the province of Granada, the city has taken the same name and is one of the large urban centers of Spain with a great cultural history. The city sits at the confluence of four rivers, the Beiro, the Darro, the Genil, and the Monachil. A popular tourist destination, Granada is home to the Alhambra, a Moorish citadel and palace, named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984. The Alhambra exemplifies the last of Moorish dominion and influence within Spain and the penetration of Islamic art into European culture. As such, it is one of Spain's most visited historical sites.\n\nThe Palacio de Generalife, the summer palace and country estate of the Nasrid Emirs, is beside Granada. One of the oldest surviving Moorish gardens, the Jardin de la Sultana, is inside. Originally the Alhambra and the Generalife were connected by a walkway, although now a ravine lies between the two. Although these are the most famous attractions in Granada, the city is home to many wonderful museums, gardens, and works of architecture.\n\nSanta Fe de la Vega – Granada, Spain, was one of Santa Fe's first Sister Cities. The cities share many historical and cultural events and seek to strengthen their relationship through cultural, economic, and tourist-based exchanges.\n\nwww.andalucia.com\n\nTurismo de Granada\n\nLove Granada\n\nSanta Fe de la Vega, Spain and Santa Fe, New Mexico by Frederico Vigil\n\nSorrento is located in Campania, southern Italy, and overlooks the Bay of Naples. Rich in Greek and Phoenician history, the region was dominated by the Roman Empire until its collapse. At the start of the 18th century, Sorrento emerged as a popular tourist resort appreciated by visitors for its mild climate and flourishing countryside.\n\nSorrento is the birthplace of the poet Torquato Tasso, author of the Gerusalemme Liberata. Soviet writer Maxim Gorky lived in Sorrento in the 1920s. The town was also known as a favorite destination of famous Europeans such as Lord Byron, Keats, Goethe, Dickens, Wagner, Ibsen, and Nietzsche.\n\nThe City has remained a popular destination for its celebrations during the Christian Holy Week, with two main processions held on Good Friday: the Procession of Our Lady of Sorrows (or the \"Visit in the Sepulchers\"), organized by the Venerable Arciconfraternita of Saint Monica and, the Procession of the Crucified Christ, organized by the Venerable Arciconfraternita of the Death.\n\nA Sister Cities Agreement was signed between Santa Fe and Sorrento in 1996. They share many similarities, and their relationship is strengthened through cultural, economic, and tourist-based exchanges.\n\nSorrento Tourism\n\nSorrento Info\n\nDomenico Fiorentino painted the Hotel Tramontano, which has hosted many artists and writers over the centuries.

The city, known for its rich history and culture, is famous for the 17th-century Tsuyama castle, which was destroyed in 1874. The castle ruins, said to rival that of Himeji Castle in neighboring Hyogo Prefecture, remain one of Tsuyama's main tourist attractions along with Joto Street, a narrow street of old, traditional buildings that were once part of the pilgrimage route from Kyoto to Izumo, and Shurakuen Garden, Sakura Shrine, Yayoi Village.
