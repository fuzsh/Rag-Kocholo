        "text": "SANTA FE\n\nSanta Fé is an unassuming town just 11 kilometres west of Granada City with a population of approximately 14,000. While it may not at first appear to be the most remarkable destination in Andalusia compared to the many pretty villages, towns and cities, it played a key role in Spain’s history. Santa Fé began as the encampment set up by the Catholic Kings at the end of the 15 th century, when the siege of Granada commenced. In 1481, out of the army camp grew an imposing town of bricks and mortar within a record time of just 80 days. The structure of the town follows the form of a cross based around two roads that cross at the centre.\n\nBooking.com\n\nThe speed of the construction and the very name, Santa Fé (Fé referring to the Catholic faith), were both means used by the Christians to transmit to the Muslims the symbolic strength, faith and determination to win back Granada. The protective wall and moat added around the town provided security and was another defiant move to demonstrate their supremacy to the Arabs.\n\nThe sight of the massive powerhouse emerging out of the dust went a long way to convincing the besieged Moors that the Christians meant business and the surrender treaty was signed in January 1492. Another important historical event that took place in Santa Fé was the agreement reached between the Catholic Kings and Christopher Columbus to finance the great voyage to the East Indies.\n\nAlthough the municipality of Santa Fé still has an agricultural background, in more recent years it has become an important dormitory town for many people who work in Granada. Architecturally speaking, although none of the original towers and walls are there, an important reminder of the dramatic historic past still stand in the form of the three of the four famous walled gates which were erected around the original royal infantry town.\n\nPlaces of Interest\n\nThe Church of Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación dates back to the 18th century and is built in the neoclassic style. It is constructed on the site where the Catholic Kings built the original church, which was destroyed during an earthquake.\n\nThree of the four monumental gates that were built around the camp still stand open. They are named Loja, Granda and Sevilla. The fourth gate (which was named, Jaén) is no longer there. In the 18 th Century the three gates had to be more or less rebuilt and chapels were added on, which have important baroque style features. Francisco, the brother of the famous poet and playwright, Federico García Lorca, apparently once said “how many times on our way to and from Granada did we pass through those walled gates in our mule cart”. Indeed recent historical research has revealed that there was a marriage union between Lorca’s ancestors and the well-known family of Santa Fé. Lorca was born just a few kilometers away in the village of Fuente Vaqueros on the 5 th June 1898.\n\nThe Hermitage of Cristo de la Salud dates to the end of the 15 th Century and was built by Galician soldiers who fought in the battle of Granada.\n\nWhat is today the Town Hall and Tourist Office was once the public granary. It is worth taking a look at this neo-Mudejar building.\n\nFiestas\n\nSanta Fé also has strong connections with several Hispano American cities, due to the many cultural events tied up with the connection with the Discovery of America.\n\nLa Cruz de Mayo (May Cross) is a much celebrated festival in Santa Fé, when crosses are beautifully decorated with flowers and put on public display.\n\nSanta Catalina, is a fiesta celebrated on the 25 th November, when the people of Santa Fé go into the countryside in groups of friends and families and join together for a picnic lunch.\n\nWhere to Eat in Santa Fé\n\nThere are many excellent bars and restaurants in the town of Santa Fé, including the following:\n\nLa Baculilla: If you like meat, this is an excellent choice for grilled meats.
