        "text": "A member of Historic Hotels of America since 1991, La Fonda has been one of Santa Fe’s most recognizable icons for centuries. It also bears the distinction of being among the most historic holiday destinations in the entire United States, as early municipal records indicate that an inn operated on the site at the time of the city’s founding in 1607. (Interestingly, some additional sources seem to state that it may have opened in 1610.) Over the course of the next two centuries, travelers from across North America would visit La Fonda as they passed through Santa Fe along the El Camino Real de Tierra Adento. When Captain William Becknell forged the path that would become the “Santa Fe Trail” in 1821, he and his party stayed at the inn upon arriving at Santa Fe’s central plaza. But Captain Becknell would be just the first of many frontiersmen and trailblazers who would visit the inn over the next few decades. Soon after New Mexico became a U.S. territory in the wake of the Mexican-American War, several American transplants purchased the inn and changed its name to be the “United States Hotel.” But many Mexican residents referred to the building as the “La Fonda Americana.” Its gambling hall quickly emerged as its most attractive feature, which provided a source of amusement on the frontier. The inn thus became a haven for rough outlaws and gangsters. The Chief Justice of the Territorial Supreme Court, John P. Slough, was even shot to death inside the inn by Captain William Rynerson. Rynerson was a member of the territorial legislature who represented the people of Dona Ana County. He and his local political allies had found Judge Slough to be incredibly arrogant and attempted to remove him from office. Slough, in turn, insulted Rynerson’s character, enraging the captain. Rynerson then fired a bullet into Slough when the latter refused to apologize for his slander. Though Rynerson was tried, he was later acquitted.\n\nIn 1881, the original inn was subsequently sold to Dr. Robert Longwell and Abraham Staab. Staab took a leading role in operating the business, due to his experience as a successful merchant. (Staab would also build a brilliant mansion in downtown Santa Fe that would eventually become a resort called the “La Posada de Santa Fe.” This venue is another member of Historic Hotels of America.) Staab upgraded the building significantly, installing a series of retail shop spaces along the façade facing San Francisco Street. The inn unfortunately burned down in 1912, though, leaving the beloved local icon a charred wreck. Undeterred, the Santa Fe Builders Corporation began seeking ways in which to raise the appropriate finances to reconstruct the hotel. Yet, the inn’s fate remained quite uncertain for several years thereafter. Nevertheless, local business leaders came together and resolved to save the ailing structure. In 1920, the Santa Fe Builders Corporation finally raised enough capital to reconstruct the inn through the sale of some $200,000-worth of bonds. Architect Isaac Hamilton Rapp then designed the new building, using Spanish Colonial Revival-style architecture. Some have called Rapp as the “Creator of the Santa Fe Style,” as he was among the first to popularize the use of historical Spanish American design aesthetics in the nation. The inn subsequently reopened as the “La Fonda” few months later. But in 1926, The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway purchased the hotel and leased it to hotelier Fred Harvey and his renowned hospitality chain. The business then hired architect John Gaw Meem and designer Mary E.J. Colter to recreate the building as a luxurious “Harvey House.” Harvey House itself was a hotel chain noted for its high standards, fine dining, and a staff of exceptionally well-trained waitresses known as the “Harvey Girls.” When their work finally concluded, La Fonda stood as one of the most exceptional “Harvey House” in America.\n\nLa Fonda continued to operate under the care of the Fred Harvey Company until 1968, when Sam and Ethel Ballen purchased the building for a sum of one million dollars. By this point, the Fred Harvey Company had been absorbed by Amfac Inc., the precursor of today’s Xanterra Parks and Resorts. The Ballens invested heavily into saving the La Fonda, as the building had fallen into considerable disrepair. Their efforts to reverse the decay did much to save the building’s historical architecture and timeless elegance. But when Sam Ballen passed away in 2007, he left La Fonda in the hands of his descendants. The building had grown again to be quite dilapidated, as a host of structural problems had come to plague the structure. As such, Ballen’s heirs began looking for a new owner who could take over the ailing business. Jennifer Kimball gathered a group of investors and bought La Fonda from the Ballen family. Kimball herself was an attorney who had spent a quarter of a century working for the Ballens and had developed a close relationship with the family. But Kimball was determined to preserve the legacy of Sam and Ethel Ballen, sparing no expense to ensure that La Fonda was truly revitalized. The recent renovations took the better part of a decade to complete, with nearly every inch of the building completely restored. Jennifer Kimball herself worked closely withSanta Fe-based architect and interior designer Barbara Felix to resurrect La Fonda. The work that the two managed to accomplish was nothing short of spectacular. Thanks in large part to their diligence, the hotel’s brilliance radiated unlike ever before. La Fonda has since become one of the best destinations in downtown Santa Fe. It is currently close to a number of outstanding cultural attractions, including the Georgia O’Keefe Museum, the Santa Fe Plaza, and the historic Palace of the Governors. La Fonda is also a contributing structure within the renowned Santa Fe Historic District, which is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places."
