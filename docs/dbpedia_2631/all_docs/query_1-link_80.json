        "text": "A Look Back on my 2016 Wants and Wishes\n\nOn New Year's Eve, before we ring in the New Year, here's a look back at my 2016 wants and wishes and how each one turned out.\n\n1. Silverware - I'm not counting the Swope Park Rangers' Western Conference championship unfortunately (more on that later), so this wasn't a wish that was met this year by any of KC's four teams. Three of the four made the playoffs, but none of them were able to come home with a championship in 2016.\n\n2. Sorting KC address center back issues - This is an area that overall was probably addressed, but at the same time probably wasn't. Sporting KC was in the top half of the table in terms of fewest goals allowed, finishing sixth in that category allowing 41 goals. So on that stat alone it would seem that KC addressed their center back issues. But the issue for the center back situation was the inability to have a consistent starting pairing at center back whether it be form, injuries, or national team call ups, KC started five different players at center back in seven different combinations over the 34 game season. Nuno Coelho and Matt Besler started the season as the number one center back pairing and looked to be pretty good for KC in that situation, raising hopes for the season. Then Coelho got hurt in mid-May and made just one 90 minute appearance the entire rest of the season for KC, with his high salary Sporting passed on retaining the Portuguese center back. For a stretch in the middle of the season, Peter Vermes favorite pairing was Ike Opara and the returning Lawrence Olum as Besler was with the national team and struggling with his club form. Besler eventually won his spot back with Opara for a stretch before injuries brought down Opara again this season, although not long term like prior years). This allowed Kevin Ellis to step up and take the job next to Besler, which he didn't relinquish the rest of the season. The Besler/Ellis pairing KC through the end of the season and into the playoffs in 2016. Hopefully a more consistent pairing can work in 2017.\n\n3. Keep Krisztian Nemeth in Sporting blue - This one went out the window in late January as Sporting KC sold Nemeth to Al Gharafa SC in Qatar. Much has been made about how the move came about, whether Nemeth forced it, or whether KC did. KC reportedly went to Nemeth in good faith to offer him a new contract because of his performance in the 2015 season, but a deal couldn't be worked out. Nemeth (or his agent) posted a Facebook message saying that he wanted to stay but that the contract he was offered still wouldn't have made him one of the club's highest paid players. At the same times there were comments that Nemeth wanted to be released early to join the Hungarian team for camp ahead of the Euros. We never got the full story and likely never will, what we know for sure is that Nemeth left and his departure left a big hole in KC's right wing that the club never successfully filled in 2016.\n\n4. Sporting advance from their CCL group - Another one that didn't come true, Sporting got off to a poor start with their two road games, drawing 2-2 in Trinidad and then were taken apart 3-0 in Vancouver to put themselves firmly behind the eight ball. Needing a result at home against Vancouver to keep their faint hopes of advancing alive. Falling behind, clawing back to equalize, Sporting gave up a very late winner to Alphonso Davies to put the Whitecaps through. KC won their final group game, a meaningless encounter between Sporting and Central FC 3-1, playing a number of Swope Park Rangers.\n\n5. Jon Kempin and Erik Palmer-Brown both play 15 plus games - Almost, but not quite on this one, and certainly not in the way I expected with Palmer-Brown going on loan to Porto in 2016. Kempin started the season as the Rangers' starting goalkeeper, lost the job, won it back, then lost it again and never gained it back after an injury to Tim Melia forced him to be recalled from his loan. Combined between the Rangers and a couple of appearances for Sporting KC in the CCL, Kempin made 14 appearances in 2016, going 5-6-3 (5-4-3 for SPR, 0-2 for Sporting) and allowing 18 goals in those 14 games.\n\nPalmer-Brown made 17 league appearances across two seasons for Porto's reserve team in the Portuguese second division, becoming a regular at center back for the club in their run to the Portuguese second division championship in the 2015-2016 season. After recovering from an injury early in the 2016-2017 season, Palmer-Brown again took his place in the center of defense and even earned a call up to the first team.\n\n6. Swope Park Rangers have successful first season - I'd say a trip to the USL championship was a successful season, even if it didn't end in a trophy there was a lot of good that came out of the first season. For me, SPR's success had more to do with the players than the results on the field. SPR made a priority of getting a younger roster and really did, with only a handful of players over the age of 25 on the team. It also was able to shine the light on a number of players who could produce for Sporting KC in the years to come. From the likes of Tyler Pasher and Adrian Zendejas, who have both already signed with the first team to the likes of Amer Didic, Ualefi, and Nansel Selbol who all made appearances for the first team in the Champions League. Arguably the player I'm most excited about didn't even play for the first team though, Kevin Oliveira, tore his ACL near the midpoint of the season and missed out on the second half of the season. If he'd been healthy I have no doubts he'd have also appeared for Sporting KC this past season. Hopefully a swift return from his ACL tear will see him getting time with Sporting in 2017.\n\n7. US national team has a respectable performance in the Copa America Centenario - I'd classify a fourth place finish as respectable, at least from looking at it from the outside it certainly was. Advancing to the semifinals before losing to world power Argentina is certainly a good run. Arguments can be made about the USA's performance in that 4-0 loss to Argentina as well as the two losses to Colombia (2-0 in group play and 1-0 in third place game), and how they were some of the final moments of Jurgen Klinsmann's time in charge of the US team, but in the end even someone anti-Klinsmann like myself, has to admit fourth was respectable, especially given the draw.\n\n8. Missouri Comets get past Baltimore Blast - Unfortunately another Comets season ended with a loss to the Baltimore Blast. The Missouri (now Kansas City) Comets won the Central Division last year with a 17-3 record, four games ahead of second and third place Chicago and Milwaukee. After the Milwaukee Wave topped the Chicago Mustangs in a three game series, the Comets swept the Wave aside 2-0 winning 10-5 on the road and 8-2 at home to set up a match up with the Baltimore Blast for the fourth straight season. Unfortunately just like two of the previous three, the Blast topped the Comets, this time with a pair of overtime victories both by a 4-3 score line for the Blast.\n\n9. FCKC recover from losing four regulars - Unfortunately the Blues couldn't overcome the loss of so many important pieces. FC Kansas City even lost a fifth likely regular as the club acquired Sydney Leroux in January last year, from the Western New York Flash, to replace Amy Rodriguez, but later in January she too announced that she would miss the 2016 season as she was pregnant. They also lost midfielder, Jen Buczkowski, who retired five games into the season to return to school. The Blues finished outside the playoffs for the first time in their history, finishing in sixth place with 26 points, six points behind fourth place Western New York. In the absence of both Rodriguez and Leroux, Shea Groom stepped up, scoring eight of FCKC's 18 goals on the season to lead the Blues in scoring. The return of Desiree Scott helped to ease some of the defensive losses in the offseason, as the Blues' defense allowed the second fewest goals in the league in 2016. Unfortunately the loss of Rodriguez, Leroux, and Lauren Holiday couldn't be overcome on the offensive end.\n\nOverall, it wasn't a great year for my wants and wishes with only one, the Swope Park Rangers having a successful first season being my one real win out of all of them.\n\nDefensive Mistake Cost Comets in Loss to Tropics\n\nThe Kansas City Comets' defense has been extremely stout as of late at the Silverstein Eye Centers Arena, allowing just one goal in their last two games on their home field. Unfortunately that all changed as the Comets welcomed the expansion Florida Tropics to Kansas City tonight, the Comets defense fell to pieces with a number of poor giveaways leading to goals, including two short handed goals for the Tropics as the Comets fell 8-7 to the Tropics to fall to 5-4 on the season.\n\nThe Comets jumped out to an early lead with two goals in the first quarter thanks to Ramone Palmer just two minutes in as he fired home a shot after Guerrero Pino beat goalkeeper Piotr Sliwa to the ball knocking it off the wall into Palmer's path. Near the midpoint of the half the Comets doubled the lead as Lucas Rodriguez fired home a shot from a tight angle after a John Sosa restart. While the Comets had the lead, it was the Tropics that controlled the quarter, pressuring the Comets in their own end, and forcing the Comets defense to be busy.\n\nThe second quarter saw the Comets begin to pressure the Tropics more but couldn't add to their lead. Eventually the Comets got caught up as Ricardo Diegues beat Stephen Patterson to put the Tropics on the board just under nine minutes in. The Comets answered just over a minute later though as Ramone Palmer scored his second goal of the game, toe-poking a shot past Sliwa and into the net to make it 3-1. Before half time though the Tropics struck back again as Victor Parreiras found the back of the net with less than a minute left to put the Tropics within one heading into half time.\n\nThe third quarter things got out of hand for the Comets as Diegues tied the game just over three minutes in off a restart. The Tropics then took the lead close to the mid point of the period as Diegues finished off his hattrick as he jumped on a poor pass by Alain Matingou and scored to make it 4-3. The Comets tied the game about two minutes later on the power play as the Comets spread the field and eventually Rodriguez found Leo Gibson in the middle who one timed a shot into the corner to tie the game at 4-4. KC pushed to try to retake the lead and got caught on the counter as Freddy Moojen finished off the counter with his first goal of the game to put the Tropics up 5-4 after three quarters.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter the Comets found themselves on the power play after a tripping penalty, but got caught up field and another counter by the Tropics allowed Raphael Nascimento to easily beat Patterson to make it 6-4 after Sliwa quickly fed Parreiras, who fed Nascimento. Seconds later the Tropics looked liked they'd do it again short handed but called for too many men on the field. The Comets had just over 30 seconds with a two man advantage but couldn't find the net. As the first penalty expired, Anthony Arico raced out of the box and pressured Patterson in his own defensive third. Patterson lost the ball and Arico scored to make it 7-4 to the Tropics. With just over six minutes left the Comets got one goal back as Rodriguez scored on another power play for the Comets to cut the lead to 7-5. The Comets almost immediately went to the sixth attacker, inserting Sosa as the sixth attacker. But the Tropics again quickly countered off a Sliwa save as the Comets didn't get back, Arico fed Nascimento, who scored his second goal of the game to make it 8-5. The Comets got another opportunity on the power play after a boarding penalty and took advantage as Robert Palmer headed in a ball on the goal line with just over two minutes left to cut the lead to two goals at 8-6. The Comets continued to pressure and with 12 seconds left found a goal to cut the lead to one as Sosa scored from the top of the box to make it 8-7. With only 12 seconds left the Comets immediately went on the offensive off the kick off and had two efforts by Palmer and Brian Harris cleared off the line before the final horn blew.\n\nThe Comets won't get to dwell on the loss long though as they are off to St. Louis tomorrow for an afternoon game against the St. Louis Ambush to try to keep themselves ahead of the Milwaukee Wave in the Central division playoff race.\n\nSporting's Homegrown Player Loans\n\nTwo of Sporting KC's four homegrown players spent all or part of the year 2016 on loan in Europe, Erik Palmer-Brown and Daniel Salloi spent 2016 in Portugal and Hungary playing with club's there instead of with Sporting KC. With 2016 close to coming to an end let's take a look at both players' time in Europe.\n\nPalmer-Brown's loan to Porto in Portugal took place first, Sporting agreed to a loan move for Palmer-Brown during preseason for Sporting ahead of the 2016 MLS season. At the time he'd been expected to play a role for Sporting's USL side, the Swope Park Rangers in 2016, instead he got a move to Europe. It look Palmer-Brown about a month or so to get up to speed in Portugal, but once he did he became a regular starter for Porto B in the Portuguese second division. Palmer-Brown started 11 games for Porto B in the league as they won the Portuguese second division.\n\nPlamer-Brown missed the start of the 2016-2017 season for Porto B as he suffered a foot injury that kept him out of action until the middle of October. Upon his return though Palmer-Brown again took his place in the starting lineup for Porto B. He started six games for Porto B in their league season as well as playing in cup competitions.\n\nThe biggest news for Palmer-Brown in the second half of 2016 came when he was called up on multiple occasions to train with Porto's first team. Late in his loan Palmer-Brown even made the bench for Porto's first time in a Cup game between Porto and Belenenses. Unfortunately Palmer-Brown didn't get on the field, but it showed the faith that Porto has in him as a player. Porto had their last game of 2016 on Thursday, but a hamstring injury has kept Palmer-Brown out for the last couple weeks.\n\nThe question now becomes whether Palmer-Brown will make the move to Porto permanent. The club has obviously been impressed enough with Palmer-Brown's work if he's getting called up to work with the first team and as a consistent starter for their reserve side. From reading some fan reactions, the fans are impressed with Palmer-Brown and are wanting Porto to make the move permanent as well.\n\nIt he doesn't go though Palmer-Brown's time in KC may still be short as other clubs could come in with an offer. The other thing is that he's likely to feature a whole lot for KC in the first half of the season. If he returns Palmer-Brown is likely to miss a good portion of preseason as U20 World Cup qualifying takes place in February and early March and the assumption is that Palmer-Brown would be on the roster for that tournament. Then if the US finishes as one of the top four teams in qualifying, they'll qualify for this summer's World Cup in late May and early June in South Korea. So if Palmer-Brown does return, don't expect him to jump right into Sporting's starting 11 either.\n\nWith Salloi, his loan didn't take place until about half way through 2016. Originally Salloi had been the only other striker on the team along with Dom Dwyer and ended up dressing for Sporting's first few games of the 2016 season until Diego Rubio took that spot over. With Rubio in the 18 for Sporting, Salloi went on loan to the Swope Park Rangers for the beginning of the USL season. He played in 10 games for the Rangers, starting six of them and leading the team in goals with four before his loan. Salloi's loan reportedly was because of his hopes of getting back into the youth national team picture for his country by playing in the local league.\n\nOriginally when the loan was announced back in June, Salloi was on his way to Vasas, a traditional power in Hungary. When the league kicked off in mid-July though there was no sign of Salloi on the field or on the bench for Vasas in Hungary. A few days after the league started it was reported that Salloi's loan had been switched from Vasas to Gyirmot for the rest of 2016. Gyirmot, a recently promoted side from the Hungarian second division, is coached by Istvan Urbanyi, a former Sporting Kansas City academy coach from around the time Salloi would have been in the academy. The move in that regard made sense for Sporting and Salloi, and going to a newly promoted club had a better chance of better playing time for Salloi.\n\nUnfortunately the play hasn't gone Gyirmot's way all that much, they're currently rooted to the foot of the table in Hungary in 12th, seven points behind 11th place and seven points from safety right now, with by far the worst goal difference in the league at -23.\n\nSalloi for his part has appeared in 13 of Gyirmot's 19 games before the winter break, starting 12 of them. He's also leading the team in scoring with two goals, but the club has only scored eight goals in their 19 games, less than a goal every other game.\n\nThe Hungarian league is on break until February now, so Salloi's loan is effectively finished for the time being. With Rubio out for the first half of 2017 at least, Salloi is once again the only other striker on the roster other than Dwyer. Unlike Palmer-Brown, a permanent move to Hungary doesn't seem likely given Gyirmot's position in the table, it'd seem unlikely that they would want to pick up Salloi permanently with relegation back to the second division looking highly likely at this point.\n\nIf I had to make a guess on who is back and who isn't in 2017, I think Palmer-Brown is likely gone, whether it be to Porto, or another team that saw him play while he was with Porto, I think Palmer-Brown makes the move to Europe in January. As for Salloi, I could see his loan extended through the end of the Hungarian season if Gyirmot and Urbanyi really want it, but I could just as easily see Salloi in KC for preseason looking to push for time or back with the Rangers battling Mark Anthony Gonzalez and Kharlton Belmar.\n\nSporting Sign New TV Deal\n\nAfter spending the last three years showing games on KMCI-TV, Sporting Kansas City will have a new broadcast home in 2017. The KC Star is reporting that Sporting is on the verge of signing a multi-year partnership with Fox Sports Kansas City to broadcast non-national Sporting KC games.\n\nThe new deal will have it's pluses and minuses for the club and it's fans. On the plus side, Sporting will now be working with a station that specializes in broadcasting sports, and as part of the deal, SKC will have access to some of FSKC's on-air production elements, which should increase the level of the broadcast going forward. It will also allow SKC to have a more centralized regional TV deal as some of KC's games will be on Fox Sports Midwest, broadcasting to all of MO, parts of Iowa and Nebraska as well. Sporting will also be able to have all games available on the Fox Sports Go app, another benefit of the move. While Sporting will still produce their own shows, hopefully the club will take advantage of the on-air production elements and return to having their announcers travel to the away games. That's something the club got away from late in the 2016 season and the production value of the games dropped dramatically because Nate Bukaty, Andy Gruenebaum, and Jake Yadrich would be calling the game from a screen in a studio in Kansas City.\n\nThere are some initial draw backs that come to mind though regarding the switch. While FSKC is used to broadcasting sports, the primary tenant on the channel will be the Kansas City Royals, who will obviously get top billing over Sporting KC. When there is an overlap, Sporting games would be moved to FSKC Plus. This is something that will certainly cause some ire among Sporting fans who won't want to go searching to try to find FSKC Plus when the Royals are playing (For those that had never even heard of FSKC Plus like me, here's a handy link to look at to see if you have it.). At least the club won't be in a situation of having tap delayed games like New York City FC have had with YES.\n\nAnother draw back of the move, at least in some fans' eyes is the move from broadcast TV. The argument many are making is that there are a growing number of younger Sporting fans who are \"cord-cutters\" and don't have any cable television, which will keep them from being able to watch the games at home.\n\nThere are certainly both benefits of the move and legitimate concerns that fans are right to have heading into the season.\n\nSporting's broadcast home isn't the only thing changing either, the Star reported that Bukaty will be the only on-air personality returning for games in 2017. Both Gruenebaum and Yadrich will no longer be part of the broadcast team on air. Yadrich for me will be the biggest loss from the team simply because of the knowledge and information that he would share during the entire broadcast (pre-game, game, and post game). Sporting is still struggling in many fans eyes to properly replace Callum Williams on calls for games.\n\nHopefully this ends up being a really good move for KC all around, making them look more professional and win over new fans on a channel specifically for sports.\n\nComets Get First Road Win\n\nThe Kansas City Comets earned their first road win of the season on the third time of asking last night in Florida where the Comets took down the expansion Florida Tropics.\n\nThe Comets started the game with a very high press, keeping the Tropics pinned in their own end for much of the early going. KC was rewarded for the pressure with a goal off a set piece less than four minutes in as John Sosa laid the ball off the Leo Gibson who fired home from the corner of the box. The Comets continued the pressure but were unable to add to their lead until late in the quarter off another set piece. Off a corner Sosa played a ball through the middle of the box where Bryan Perez had made a run and just had to tap the ball into the net to put the Comets on top 2-0 as the quarter came to an end. The second quarter saw the Comets extend their lead to three goals six minutes in as Brian Harris raced down the wing to receive a pass, Harris' shot was saved but Ramone Palmer had continued his run to the top of the box where he fired the loose ball into the net to make it 3-0 to the Comets. Florida finally got themselves on the board in the final minute of the quarter on a counter attack as the Comets were searching to extend their lead. In a two on one situation Ricardo De Queiroz Diegues and Marco Rodriguez played a give and go to get Stephan Paterson to commit before Diegues finished to send the teams into the break with the Comets up 3-1.\n\nEarly in the third quarter the Tropics again cut into the lead, making it a single goal as Victor Rojas capitalized on a turnover by the Comets in their own end to make it 3-2. The Tropics continued to pressure trying to find an equalizer throughout the quarter. Late in the quarter though the Comets capitalized on a mistake by the Tropics defense to push their lead back to two goals as Perez jumped a pass by the Tropics goalkeeper. Racing in on goal, Perez fired a shot off the glass that went right to Stefan Stokic, who just had to tap the ball into the empty net to make it 4-2 heading into the final quarter.\n\nThe Comets were able to extend their lead to three goals less than four minutes into the fourth quarter as Gibson picked up a ball at midfield before playing it wide to Perez, who in turn fired the ball off the wall to Gibson at the top of the box. Gibson fired his shot on goal but it was blocked, Gibson reacted first to the rebound and slotted it home to put the Comets up 5-2. The three goal lead lasted less than two minutes before Diegues scored his second of the game off a beautiful back heel on a long ball into the box to make it 5-3. The Tropics pressed for another goal and after inserting the sixth attacker scored a fourth with just over three minutes left on a blast from long range by sixth attacker Victor Parreiras that hit off the underside of the cross bar and into the net. The Tropics continued pushing with the sixth attacker looking for an equalizer that they thought they had with just over a minute left after a shot and scramble in front of goal, but Paterson came away with it and the referees ruled it wasn't a goal. The Comets immediately countered and Stokic was brought down in the corner by Anthony Arico on a tackle born out of frustration for not getting the goal at the other end. A blue card was handed out and the Comets looked to see the game out. With the man advantage the Comets played keep away and eventually pulled the Tropics four defenders up field enough that Perez was sprung in behind the defense. He fed the ball into the middle for Gibson who got the Tropics goalkeeper to commit to him before sliding a pass back across goal for Perez who had set up at the far post to tap home to make it 6-4 to the Comets.\n\nWith the win KC move to 5-3 on the season and will host the same Tropics team on December 30th in their next game.\n\nA Look at the Failure that Was the First MLS Free Agent Signing\n\nDuring the most recent collective bargaining between the MLS players union and the league, one of the big points that the players were fighting for was free agency within the league as when players contracts expire the team they were with could make them a \"bona fide\" offer and retain their MLS rights. In the end, the players got some of what they wanted, they got a little bit of free agency, players that were 28 years or older and had at least eight years of experience in the league now earned themselves free agency when they were out of contract or had their options declined. Last offseason was the first time players were free agents within MLS as 27 players met the requirements for free agency within MLS.\n\nAlong with re-signing their lone free agent, Paulo Nagamura, Sporting Kansas City also became the first team to actually utilize MLS free agency, signing Justin Mapp from the Montreal Impact as the league's first free agent. Mapp was signed to be a depth piece on the wing and start some while Krisztian Nemeth was on international duty. With the addition later of Brad Davis, Sporting looked set on the wings for the season. Then came the Nemeth transfer which turned the wing position into what looked like a platoon between Davis and Mapp. Then Mapp got hurt, got hurt again, played a game, got hurt again, played a couple more games, then got hurt and missed the rest of the season leaving Kansas City in the position of having to play an aging Brad Davis more early on or rely on Connor Hallisey to try to help with the offense. Eventually KC got a career year from Jacob Peterson to sort of help fill the gap, but the string of all those events made the Mapp signing look worse and worse with each passing day and each passing game. Mapp finished the 2016 season making just six appearances for Kansas City, playing 43 minutes. How bad was Mapp's free agent signing for Kansas City? Here's a look at the 27 players that were free agents ahead of the 2016 season and how they ended up (all stats are their stats in league play only).\n\nGK Jon Busch (Chicago Fire) - Signed with NASL's Indy XI.\n\nGK Troy Perkins (Seattle Sounders) - Did not sign with anyone.\n\nGK Kyle Reynish (New York Red Bulls) - Re-signed with New York played 0 games.

Salary $250,000 base and guaranteed compensation.\n\nLooking at the performance of all the other free agents last year, Mapp's performance stands out, especially in comparison with his salary. Mapp ended up with the fifth highest salary of free agents in terms of base salary (behind Clark, Magee, Moor, and Nagamura) and the fourth highest in guaranteed compensation (in front of Nagamura). The salary combined with the performance by Mapp is one of the lead causes to the frustration with his performance (along with the circumstances I mentioned about regarding player movement), if Mapp had been making close to the amount that Conor Casey was making for Columbus last season, I doubt the complaining would be at the level it is among fans. Casey made less than half of what Mapp made ($105,000), so even though he actually made fewer appearances and played fewer minutes he doesn't seem to be looked at by Crew fans in the same sense as Mapp does here. Mapp's inability to even make the bench because of his string of injuries combined with his $224,070 base salary puts a sour taste in a lot of peoples' mouths. He made over $37,000 per appearance for Kansas City on the field and over $5,200 per minute played. The only players to play fewer minutes than Mapp did are the aforementioned Casey and two players that made no league appearances, Kyle Reynish and Nathan Sturgis and both of those players were making the senior roster minimum of $62,500, they were end of the bench players not expected to contribute much at all. So while there are players that have played fewer minutes than Mapp, no one comes close in terms of that combined with salary.\n\nIn fact, the only player that comes even a little close is his teammate, Nagamura. While I appreciate everything he has done for the club, Nagamura has been one of those players the last couple years where you look at the salary he's making, look at his contribution on the field and ask yourself if he should be making that much. Nagamura though is a little easier to justify when he does actually get on the field. The other thing working in Nagamura's favor is while he only played in nine games, he was available for more on the bench but was not subbed into the game, unlike Mapp.\n\nWhile Nagamura was a better contribution to the team than Mapp this season, KC still used almost $450,000 of cap space on a pair of players that made just 15 league appearances, started six games, played 569 minutes and contributed to a grand total of one goal for KC. The only team that spent more on free agents in 2016 in terms of cap space is the LA Galaxy who used just under $600,000 to sign two new players (Jeff Larentowicz and Mike Magee) and re-sign one (Alan Gordon), but even with that much money spent they at least got production from those three players as they made 75 appearances, 3,678 minutes played and contributed to 16 goals for the Galaxy. That's not good enough for Sporting KC, especially for a team that isn't going to draw in the big name players, or likely spend $7 million on a transfer fee for a player, KC has to get more out of those players in the upper-middle range of salaries on the team. The pair certainly aren't the only reason for KC's struggles in 2016, the club had a number of players in 2016 not play to their abilities or to their perceived value based on their salaries, but it certainly didn't help having that much cap space tied up in those two players. Mapp for his part is already the worst free agent signing in the young history of MLS having free agency amongst its clubs, and given his salary and performance on the field likely has to be considered one of the worst signings in KC Wizards/Sporting KC history."
