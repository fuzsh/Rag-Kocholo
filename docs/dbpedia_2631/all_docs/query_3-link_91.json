        "text": "Stars took it and so did politicians, athletes, the rich and the famous.\n\nFrom the late 1930s to the 1950s, before commercial flights became common, BNSF predecessor Santa Fe Railway’s the Super Chief was the primary mode of travel for stars and starlets. The Super Chief was the railroad’s premiere diesel-powered Pullman sleeping car train that ran daily from Chicago to Los Angeles.\n\n“There was a lot of celebrity activity over time that involved the Santa Fe with the film industry, beginning in the silent movie era,” said Mike Martin, former public affairs director for the railroad and rail enthusiast. “One reason is that West Coast terminals for the railroad were in California.”\n\nThe Super Chief was a hit with celebrities, thanks to its top-of the-line service. The designers made sure the interior was unique and charming; classic Native American patterns and colors, paintings and even murals adorned the passenger cars. Riders enjoyed the air-conditioned cars, private bedrooms and gourmet meals, among other amenities.\n\nThe “Travel Santa Fe All the Way” direct route took just under 40 hours. If riders were going all the way to New York City, they could choose between the New York Central Railroad’s 20th Century Limited or Pennsylvania Railroad's Broadway Limited between Chicago and Manhattan.\n\nThe passenger list for the Super Chief, also known as the “Train of the Stars,” included Charlie Chaplin, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, Judy Garland, Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, Bette Davis, Vincent Price, Margaret Truman and more.\n\nAnother luxury train that drew celebrities was the Empire Builder, which operated between Chicago and Seattle/Portland in both directions daily. It ran between the Pacific Northwest and St. Paul, Minn., on the Great Northern and on the Burlington Route between St. Paul and Chicago.\n\nIn addition to celebrities riding Santa Fe trains, movies, TV programs and commercials have been made about the railroad or were filmed on or near railroad property. In 1939, the western genre feature film Dodge City debuted in Dodge City, Kansas, along the original Santa Fe Transcon mainline. The town of 11,000 swelled to nearly 50,000 to greet the publicity passenger train Santa Fe ran from Los Angeles to Dodge City for the movie debut. A few years later, Judy Garland starred in the MGM film The Harvey Girls, a Hollywood adaptation of a Harvey hotel/restaurant operation set in the Southwest.\n\nMore recently, The Changeling, starring Angelina Jolie and directed by Clint Eastwood, featured several shots filmed at San Bernardino’s historic depot. To create the scenes, Universal Pictures contracted with BNSF to move eight vintage passenger cars, a steam engine, two diesel locomotives and a tank car. Other movies have been shot in the Pacific Northwest, considered the Hollywood of the north, such as The River Wild, Far and Away and more, including commercials for several automakers.\n\nLike everything on the railroad, these operations are well planned, with a focus on safety first. The film crews and stars are briefed on what they can and can’t do. The stars are mostly appreciative – and sometimes thank a lucky employee with a photo or autograph."
