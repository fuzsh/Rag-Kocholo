        "text": "Haunted Inns and Desert Dreams: The Seductive Charms of Santa Fe\n\nAmenities: Pool, spa, gym, restaurant, bars, café, biking, horseback riding\n\nAddress: 1297 Bishops Lodge Rd, Santa Fe, NM, 87501\n\nAlong the winding, juniper-lined paths of Ten Thousand Waves, nestled on the ski basin mountain, are fourteen Japanese Ryokan-inspired suites called the Houses of the Moon. Each is unique, with amenities ranging from private wildflower fields and sun-filled courtyards to personal hot tubs and art-making rooms. Guests are encouraged to wear kimono robes for the entirety of their stay—to the spa and tubs, around the tranquil grounds, and even for long, scenic lunches at Izanami.\n\nAmenities: Spa, private outdoor space, restaurant\n\nAddress: 21 Ten Thousand Waves Way, Santa Fe, NM 87501\n\nLa Posada is one of several allegedly haunted hotels in Santa Fe (La Fonda and St. Francis Hotel are two others). The resort and spa, dating from 1880 and located mere blocks from The Plaza, Santa Fe’s central square, offers lots of options—including casita-style two-bedroom suites that overlook the gardens—and a cozy, multi-room library bar.\n\nAmenities: Pool, spa, restaurant, bar, gym, library, yoga classes\n\nAddress: 330 E Palace Ave, Santa Fe, NM, 87501\n\nRosewood Inn of the Anasazi has 58 rooms filled with hand-crafted wooden and leather furnishings; most rooms also feature private patios and fireplaces. The hotel offers in-room massages and aromatherapy sessions and has a sidewalk patio—a rarity in Santa Fe—where you can have a margarita and recharge. The location is unbeatable.\n\nAmenities: Restaurant, bar, gym, wine cellar, library, bicycle rentals\n\nAddress: 113 Washington Avenue, Santa Fe, NM, 87501\n\nWhat to Do\n\nAbiquiu and Ghost Ranch are sixty-three miles north of Santa Fe—not too far, but it feels like a trip back in time. At Ghost Ranch, tour Georgia O’Keeffe’s home and studio—a private, meticulously preserved adobe that the artist purchased from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe in 1945—where O'Keeffe lived until 1984. This airy, modern architectural wonder contains a personal collection of artwork including O'Keeffe's own paintings and sculptures, as well as pieces by Alexander Girard, an iconic Eero Saarinen for Florence Knoll chair, and an Alexander Calder mobile. The black door depicted in many of O'Keeffe's works floats on a sun-seeped patch of adobe outside.\n\nAfter your tour, drive to Abiquiu Lake—in the winter it may be too cold to swim, of course, but the water gleams. Look to the left and you’ll see Pedernal: a forceful and distinctive mesa (essentially, a flat-topped mountain), where some of O'Keeffe's ashes are spread.\n\nDrive four hours south of Santa Fe to White Sands and behold an otherworldly landscape: bounds of white sand dunes where you can walk, meditate, camp, and witness pink sunrises and sunsets.\n\nThere’s a room with a dirt floor and a Holy Dirt well at the Santuario Chimayo in Chimayo, built in 1984, forty-five minutes from Santa Fe. The dirt, it’s believed, heals everything from heartbreak to cancer. You can buy small vessels in the gift shops to take dirt to your loved ones.\n\nSITE Santa Fe is the commanding contemporary art museum in Santa Fe, and they’re ever-elevating their program. This year they presented New Mexico resident Bruce Nauman’s first-ever local solo show, and the museum has recently shown works by illustrious artists including Louise Bourgeois, Matthew Barney, Maurizio Cattelan, Jeffrey Gibson, Felix González-Torres, Jim Hodges, Jenny Holzer, Roni Horn, Pierre Huyghe, Ellsworth Kelly, Ed Ruscha, and Ai Weiwei. Be sure to also visit the Vladem Contemporary Art Museum, a brand new facet of the New Mexico Museum of Art that sits just a few blocks from SITE. Their inaugural exhibition, which runs through the spring, features work by artists including Larry Bell, Nancy Holt, Yayoi Kusama, and New Mexico’s own Agnes Martin.\n\nStop into La Boca for eight-time James Beard Award nominee chef James Campbell Caruso’s modern Spanish small plates. The tiny space, warmed with terra cotta-toned glazed tiles and cherry wood chairs, is ideally suited to relaxed enjoyment. Order the hearty grilled artichokes with sunshine-yellow zest, jet-black mussels in salsa verde, flat iron steak, Jamon Iberico (from olive and acorn-fed black pigs), and a glass of Spanish wine from La Boca’s extensive list. It’s a perfect nook for date nights, dining solo at the bar, or sharing family style with a small group.\n\nTune Up is a snug, fuschia-walled neighborhood restaurant with a menu that includes El Salvadorian Pupusas, New Mexican Green Chile Stew, lamb tacos, and perfect Caesar salads. The counter holds jars of agua fresca and Mexican wedding cookies, while the coffee is refilled almost too quickly—making Tune Up Santa Fe’s quintessential lazy morning nook.\n\nThe menu at Geronimo will transport you back to the golden era of '90s minimalism. Wasabi Caesar salad is served in a neat, leaf-wrapped stack, while paper-thin Wagyu carpaccio is accompanied by snowy shavings of Parmesan. Other standouts include melt-in-your-mouth sesame ahi tartare, miso sea bass, and rack of lamb in a Merlot reduction. The margaritas are made with house-infused green chile tequila. Everything is as delicious as it is visually enchanting, and the warm ivory dining room exudes classic Santa Fe elegance.\n\nIzanami, The Michelin Starred, upscale Izakaya at Ten Thousand Waves, is set atop a snowy mountain on the way to the Santa Fe Ski Basin. Panoramic views of the mountains, year-round outdoor seating, tatami rooms, cascading lanterns, and a roaring waterfall entryway complement the menu, which is comprised of exquisite Japanese dishes. Almost everything at Izanami is locally sourced and organic, with a seasonal menu of brilliantly flavored dishes: Shoyu sesame miso wagyu beef ishiyaki cooked on hot stones at the table, flaky miso Chilean sea bass, roasted tamari yuzu butter Japanese mushrooms, and delicate petals of sashimi with shisho are a few of the standouts. Cups of sake are always poured until they overflow to symbolize kindness, celebration, and the enjoyment of life.\n\nJoseph's is the antidote to a cold night in Santa Fe. The dimly lit interior is petite, and the menu is concise but well-considered, with inventive dishes like Christmas (red and green) chile beef tenderloin stew and delicate hamachi sashimi accented by grapefruit, tamari, and wasabi. The local lamb green chile burger with sheep's cheese on a house-made English muffin is a must—many locals return once a week to order a burger and a glass of great red at the bar.\n\nThere are myriad places in Santa Fe to get an early bite before setting out for a hike or a day of visiting museums. Stop at Cafe Fina for local coffee, organic eggs, and crispy bacon with green, red, or Christmas chile, a breakfast burrito or morning soup (organic New Mexico chive-y lamb bone broth with egg) at Dolina, huevos Motuleños (Yucatan-style eggs with feta, peas, chile, and plantains) at Pasquals, or a paleo Golden Turmeric Wrap at the serene and completely gluten-free Sweetwater Harvest Kitchen. If you’re going on a day trip, stop at Bread Shop for picnic essentials: straight-from-the-oven sourdough, organic crudites from Ground Stone Farm, a tin of Fishwife rainbow trout, and imported cured meats.\n\nNearly everything Vinaigrette serves is grown on its farm just outside of Santa Fe, which can be tasted in the incredible flavors of the produce. The kale Caesar with marcona almonds and Parmesan will, likely, leave you dissatisfied with nearly every other salad in the world.\n\nWhere to Drink\n\nThe bars at Geronimo and The Compound—both of which are located on the gallery-lined Canyon Road in the Historic East Side—are elegant Santa Fe stalwarts that serve perfect cocktails.\n\nLos Poblanos, a romantic Albuquerque plot of lavender fields, farms, and an inn, recently opened an outpost in downtown Santa Fe. Its Bar Norte is a dark, cozy tasting room with garden-infused cocktails that highlight local ingredients like lavender from their fields, earthy sage, and rosemary. Attached to the bar is Farm Shop Norte, a one-stop store for gifts like midnight black and bone-colored Onora ceramics, lavender lotions and potions, bottles of their own garden-infused spirits, candles, and packets of floral seeds plucked from the Los Poblanos farm.\n\nCult Japanese brand VISVIM opened its first womenswear store in the U.S. here in 2017; directly across the street, you'll find Sazon, James Beard Award-winning Chef Fernando Olea’s Old Mexico restaurant. Sazon is best known for its molés—the main dining room even has a mural by Mexico City artist Federico Leon De La Vega that illustrates all of the ingredients found in Olea’s New Mexico Mole. Before dinner, grab a seat in the cozy wooden bar and order a Sazonrita with Mezcal, chilled cucumber, and red chile salt, or a Diego Rivera, with Mezcal, lichi, passion fruit, hydrating coconut water, and an edible orchid.\n\nSecreto, in The St. Francis Hotel, makes seasonal cocktails from mostly organic, local produce—order the Smoked Sage Margarita, and burning fresh sage will scent the bar.\n\nThe Dragon Room at Pink Adobe is an old-school Santa Fe favorite with a fireplace and fire pit, colorful walls, and bizarre, dragon-themed art.\n\nSanta Fe Spirits is a distillery with a tasting room on Santa Fe’s East Side. Handmade liquors are folded into perfectly made cocktails—martinis, gingery Scotch concoctions, and Manhattans.\n\nWhere to Spa\n\nTen Thousand Waves Japanese Spa is without contest the most incredible spa in Santa Fe. The grounds are tranquil and gracious, with private and (semi)-public hot tubs, a restaurant, and spa services that include hot stone massages, Shiatsu, and salt glow treatments.\n\nThe gym and Spa of the Five Graces are transporting. The sprawling adobe structure is detailed with intricate mosaics, exposed earth walls, imported statues, ornate ceiling panels, and talismans. Each treatment room boasts a roaring fireplace, fountain, or glowing skylight. Schedule an Augustinus Bader facial and a Himalayan Salt Stone massage.\n\nThe wellness program at Bishop’s Lodge casts a wide net. Treatments include acupuncture, sculpting lymphatic drainage facials, Qi Gong, and ayurvedic full body massages juiced with CBD.\n\nThe Rancho Encantado Four Seasons spa just outside town is a serene escape, replete with billowing white curtains on light plaster, orchids, and a Zen rock and sculpture garden. Their spa menu, with treatments like a Moisture Drench Facial and an adobe clay cocoon massage—is designed to complement the experience of the high desert. Encantado also has a yoga program, full gym, and EQUUS equestrian experience.\n\nWhere to Shop\n\nSanta Fe Vintage is accessible by appointment only. It’s well worth making a booking: The warehouse space, which sits on the outskirts of town, holds an incredible collection of vintage denim, distressed T-shirts, outerwear, and Western wear, not to mention swathes of indigo-dyed fabric. A treasure trove, in other words. If you derive pleasure from sifting through vintage, it’s not to be missed.\n\nDouble Take is a three-wing store: It has one wing for consignment “contemporary” clothing (which can be skipped over), one for Western wear (which, if you’re in the market for leather cowboy boots, suede jackets, and vintage denim, is pretty great) and one for designer and vintage pieces from the last few decades.\n\nDoodlet’s sells a thoughtful but chaotic selection of overpriced, precious trinkets: stickers, foil-wrapped candies, books on Santa Fe, miniatures, charms. It’s a perfect place to buy gifts for children, but you’ll likely end up wanting a few things for yourself as well.\n\nShiprock, located above the Plaza, showcases and sells a succinct, impressive selection of woven textiles, Zuni Fetishes, Native American pottery, and vintage sterling silver and turquoise jewelry. It’s expensive, but each piece is remarkable and the space feels like a gallery."
