You don’t have to face a bustle on the road and you don’t have to lose your time waiting.\n\n10 reasons not to move to santa fe\n\nWe have learned some positive facts about the city, but it is not enough to answer the question “Is Santa Fe a Good Place to live”? Whenever it comes to choosing a new place of residence, you should carefully scrutinize all the factors – good and bad sides as well. Let’s take a survey on the disadvantages of moving to Santa Fe. 10 reasons not to move to Santa Fe:\n\n1. Bureaucracy\n\nSanta Fe has many big issues with its government. People are not satisfied with many decisions made by local political leaders. The biggest problem is the bureaucracy. It shows itself on different levels and situations even though the fact often emphasized in the papers.\n\n2. You’re going to need some sun protection\n\nMore than 300 days per year people experience constant sunny weather. Sometimes it is warm and gentle, the other times – it’s just burning. For most of the year the second option is predominant over the first one. So, you have to remember about sunscreen in order to protect yourself from sun burning.\n\n3. The cost of living\n\nIf you consider the number of job possibilities and the salary you are going to have you will experience something like disappointment. Generally, the payment is not even comparable to the cost of living, unless you’re working in a very good industry – like web development or the other high technology job. The lack of high-paying job positions is a big disadvantage of Santa Fe.\n\n4. Hello, dust!\n\nIf you are planning on relocating to Santa Fe, get yourself prepared to a dust problem. It is a common thing for New Mexicans – now and then they have to deal with dust due to proximity to the desert. Windy weather pretty often brings with it plenty of dust.\n\n5. Insects\n\nNo wonder such a nature around the city is not just a wonderful landscape but also a home for hundreds of insects. Some of them could be dangerous and bring you a state of high fever. The presence of these insects creates a problem with outdoor activities in some areas in the evening time.\n\n6. The lack of nightlife\n\nThe nightlife in Santa Fe presented mostly by drinking places. You won’t find places to dance or to listen to music to in the night. For some of the newcomers, it is a problem – without vivid nightlife, any city loses part of the charm.\n\n7. Crime and drugs\n\nOne of the reasons not to move to the city and the murky part of Santa Fe reality is its high level of crimes and drug use. According to the crime report the city of Santa Fe is safer than only 9% of U.S. Cities. Property crimes are on top of the list. The level of crime is ranked on the scale of one hundred points. Santa Fe property crime is 65, which is very high. Santa Fe and New Mexico, in general, has a high level of mortality caused by drug overdose and alcohol use – the second in the United States.\n\n8. Older population\n\nIf you one of those people who like a slow way of living, you will be satisfied with the place. The general social dynamic in Santa Fe is not quick and vibrant due to the demographic situation – most of the residents are older people. It affects the city’s life to its core. Practically, it means you can’t find plenty of nighttime facilities and entertainments people used to in huge cities. The atmosphere in the city rather relaxed and tranquil.\n\n9. Tax reform\n\nIf you are moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico, you will face the whole pack of taxes – gross receipts taxes, income taxes and property taxes. Each of these has a rather alarming description. For example, in the case of income taxes, the bracket includes people who make more than 16 000 dollars per year. For both high and low-income residents, each of these taxes’ laws wasn’t good news.\n\n10. Tourist city\n\nIf you are considering moving to Santa Fe for a living, then it is worth bearing in mind that the city is a tourist destination and prices for many goods are much higher. Housing prices are high because of tourists, this slightly stoopid the development opportunities of local residents."
