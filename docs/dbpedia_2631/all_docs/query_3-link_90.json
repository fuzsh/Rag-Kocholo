        "text": "Small, sleepy Los Cerrillos was once a boom town, filled with miners seeking gold, silver and turquoise. The main street's historic buildings and wooden sidewalks provided a perfect set for The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca, a 1958 Walt Disney television series about a real-life Western hero. Three decades later, Young Guns, the 1988 Western about Billy the Kid and the Lincoln County War, was famously filmed in the area.\n\nMadrid, a coal-mining town deserted by the 1950s, is now full of colorful character, its main street lined with restaurants and shops in the buildings of yesteryear. Madrid's Wild West flavor appeals to movie makers, but so does its quirkiness. When David Bowie comes tripping down a scorched mountain in the 1976 sci-fi cult classic, The Man Who Fell to Earth, he's just outside of Madrid. The town played a starring role in the 2007 biker road comedy Wild Hogs, featuring John Travolta and Tim Allen. Maggie's Diner was built for the film on Madrid's main drag and left behind for the town's residents. Fittingly, Peter Fonda shows up to prevent a fight with a rival biker gang, a nod to his 1969 iconic biker movie, Easy Rider, also filmed in Madrid.\n\nOther productions filmed in Cerrillos and Madrid include:\n\nLongmire, Pilot, 2012\n\nBeer for My Horses, 2008\n\nThe Hi Lo Country, 1998\n\nOutrageous Fortune, 1987"
