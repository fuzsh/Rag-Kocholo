        "text": "I was honored to present a $20 million ceremonial check for the appropriation from the Texas Legislature to the City of Pharr for the expansion of the Pharr International Bridge. Working with House Transportation Committee Chairman Terry Canales, Senator Morgan LaMantia, and the members of the RGV legislative delegation, we were able to secure these funds which will not only drive our community forward but also boost trade and connectivity. Our ports of entry are gateways to the Texas economy, serving as economic engines for our communities and the country as a whole.\n\nThe Pharr International Bridge, with a total of $47 billion in trade in 2023, is a hub for commerce, particularly for produce as it is the #1 border crossing in the United States for fruits and vegetables. The planned expansion of the bridge, which includes building a twin bridge to double capacity, will allow for increased traffic flow and reduced congestion and wait times. This expansion is not only necessary for the continued success of the Pharr Bridge but also for the overall economic development and prosperity of the region.\n\nI appreciate the leadership, work, and advocacy of Pharr Mayor Ambrosio Hernandez during the past legislative session to secure funding not only for the Pharr Bridge but also $150 million for the IBTC project. I would also like to thank Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Robert Nichols, and Speaker Dade Phelan for their support of this appropriation. Also grateful to Governor Greg Abbott and Texas Transportation Commission Chairman J. Bruce Bugg, Jr., for their commitment and support of the Pharr Bridge and the IBTC project.\n\nEditor’s Note: The above guest column was penned by state Sen. Juan Hinojosa to celebrate the upcoming expansion of Pharr International Bridge.\n\nEditor’s Note: The City of Pharr recently hosted an event to thank Sen. Hinojosa, state Rep. Terry Canales, chairman of the House Committee on Transportation, and the entire Rio Grande Valley legislative delegation for securing $20 million to help with their bridge expansion project. “This significant investment will drive our community forward, boosting trade and connectivity,” the City said, in a posting on social media. “This infrastructure expansion will accommodate the increasing trade volumes and ensure efficient movement of goods from Mexico.”"
