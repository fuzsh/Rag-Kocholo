        "text": "Santa Fe, city, capital of Santa Fe provincia (province), northeastern Argentina. It lies on a channel of the Paraná River, at the mouth of the Salado River, opposite the city of Paraná.\n\nIt was founded in 1573 as Santa Fe de Vera Cruz at nearby Cayastá by Juan de Garay, lieutenant governor of Asunción, Paraguay. Moved to its present site in 1651, it was developed as a supporting river port for the Spanish settlement at Asunción, 615 miles (990 km) north on the Paraguay River. During the colonial era it was a missionary centre of the Jesuits, whose church in the city dates from 1660. Until the mid-19th century it marked the northern limit of provincial expansion and served as a strategic outpost against the Indians of the Gran Chaco region. A congress meeting there in 1853 produced the constitution that established the Argentine Republic."
