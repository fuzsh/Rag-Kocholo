        "text": "Al Franken, born on May 21, 1951, in New York City, rose to prominence as a comedian, writer, and political commentator before transitioning into politics. A graduate of Harvard University, Franken first gained fame as one of the original writers on the acclaimed television show Saturday Night Live, where he worked from its inception in 1975 until 1980, and again from 1985 to 1995. During his tenure at SNL, Franken won multiple Emmy Awards for his contribution to television writing, further cementing his status as a prominent figure in the entertainment industry. Franken's career took a significant turn in 2008 when he was elected as a United States Senator from Minnesota for the Democratic Party. His transition from comedy to politics was notable, as it demonstrated his ability to leverage his platform and influence to impact public policy. Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Franken was known for his progressive stance on issues such as healthcare, education, and climate change. His time in office was marked by his commitment to fighting for middle-class families, championing women's rights, and advocating for clean energy solutions. However, Franken's political career was not without controversy. In 2017, he resigned from the Senate following allegations of sexual misconduct. This event marked a significant setback in Franken's career, leading him to step out of the public eye. Despite this, Franken continues to contribute to societal discourse through various platforms, including hosting a weekly political podcast.\n\nAnjelica Huston, an American actress and director, was born on July 8, 1951, in Santa Monica, California.
