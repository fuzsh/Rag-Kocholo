        "text": "The U.S. Moves Against Sukarno\n\nMany people in Washington, especially in the CIA Plans Directorate, had long desired the “removal” of Sukarno as well as of the PKI.68 By 1961 key policy hard-liners, notably Guy Pauker, had also turned against Nasution.69 Nevertheless, despite last-minute memoranda from the outgoing Eisenhower administration which would have opposed “whatever regime” in Indonesia was “increasingly friendly toward the Sino-Soviet bloc,” the Kennedy administration stepped up aid to both Sukarno and the army.70\n\nHowever, Lyndon Johnson’s accession to the presidency was followed almost immediately by a shift to a more anti-Sukarno policy. This is clear from Johnson’s decision in December 1963 to withhold economic aid which (according to Ambassador Jones) Kennedy would have supplied “almost as a matter of routine.”71 This refusal suggests that the U.S. aggravation of Indonesia’s economic woes in 1963-65 was a matter of policy rather than inadvertence. Indeed, if the CIA’s overthrow of Allende is a relevant analogy, then one would expect someday to learn that the CIA, through currency speculations and other hostile acts, contributed actively to the radical destabilization of the Indonesian economy in the weeks just before the coup, when “the price of rice quadrupled between June 30 and October 1, and the black market price of the dollar skyrocketed, particularly in September.”72\n\nAs was the case in Chile, the gradual cutoff of all economic aid to Indonesia in the years 1962-65 was accompanied by a shift in military aid to friendly elements in the Indonesian Army: U.S. military aid amounted to $39.5 million in the four years 1962-65 (with a peak of $16.3 million in 1962) as opposed to $28.3 million for the thirteen years 1949-61.73\n\nAfter March 1964, when Sukarno told the U.S., “go to hell with your aid,” it became increasingly difficult to extract any aid from the U.S. congress: those persons not aware of what was developing found it hard to understand why the U.S. should help arm a country which was nationalizing U.S. economic interests, and using immense aid subsidies from the Soviet Union to confront the British in Malaysia.\n\nThus a public image was created that under Johnson “all United States aid to Indonesia was stopped,” a claim so buttressed by misleading documentation that competent scholars have repeated it.74 In fact, Congress had agreed to treat U.S. funding of the Indonesian military (unlike aid to any other country) as a covert matter, restricting congressional review of the president’s determinations on Indonesian aid to two Senate committees, and the House Speaker, who were concurrently involved in oversight of the CIA.75\n\nAmbassador Jones’ more candid account admits that “suspension” meant “the U.S. government undertook no new commitments of assistance, although it continued with ongoing programs…. By maintaining our modest assistance to [the Indonesian Army and the police brigade], we fortified them for a virtually inevitable showdown with the burgeoning PKI.”76\n\nOnly from recently released documents do we learn that new military aid was en route as late as July 1965, in the form of a secret contract to deliver two hundred Aero-Commanders to the Indonesian Army: these were light aircraft suitable for use in “civic action” or counterinsurgency operations, presumably by the Army Flying Corps whose senior officers were virtually all trained in the U.S.77 By this time, the publicly admitted U.S. aid was virtually limited to the completion of an army communications system and to “civic action” training. It was by using the army’s new communications system, rather than the civilian system in the hands of Sukarno loyalists, that Suharto on October 1, 1965 was able to implement his swift purge of Sukarno-Yani loyalists and leftists, while “civic action” officers formed the hard core of lower-level Gestapu officers in Central Java.78\n\nBefore turning to the more covert aspects of U.S. military aid to Indonesia in 1963-65, let us review the overall changes in U.S.-Indonesian relations. Economic aid was now in abeyance, and military aid tightly channeled so as to strengthen the army domestically. U.S. government funding had obviously shifted from the Indonesian state to one of its least loyal components.\n\nAs a result of agreements beginning with martial law in 1957, but accelerated by the U.S.-negotiated oil agreement of 1963, we see exactly the same shift in the flow of payments from U.S. oil companies. Instead of token royalties to the Sukarno government, the two big U.S. oil companies in Indonesia, Stanvac and Caltex, now made much larger payments to the army’s oil company, Permina, headed by an eventual political ally of Suharto, General Ibnu Sutowo; and to a second company, Pertamin, headed by the anti-PKI and pro-U.S. politician, Chaerul Saleh.79 After Suharto’s overthrow of Sukarno, Fortune wrote that “Sutowo’s still small company played a key part in bankrolling those crucial operations, and the army has never forgotten it.”80\n\nU.S. Support for the Suharto Faction Before Gestapu\n\nAmerican officials commenting on the role of U.S. aid in this period have taken credit for assisting the anti-Communist seizure of power, without ever hinting at any degree of conspiratorial responsibility in the planning of the bloodbath. The impression created is that U.S. officials remained aloof from the actual planning of events, and we can see from recently declassified cable traffic how carefully the U.S. government fostered this image of detachment from what was happening in Indonesia.81\n\nIn fact, however, the U.S. government was lying about its involvement. In Fiscal Year 1965, a period when The New York Times claimed “all United States aid to Indonesia was stopped,” the number of MAP (Military Assistance Program) personnel in Jakarta actually increased, beyond what had been projected, to an unprecedented high.82 According to figures released in 1966,83 from FY 1963 to FY 1965 the value of MAP deliveries fell from about fourteen million dollars to just over two million dollars. Despite this decline, the number of MAP military personnel remained almost unchanged, approximately thirty, while in FY 1965 civilian personnel (fifteen) were present for the first time. Whether or not one doubts that aid deliveries fell off as sharply as the figures would suggest, the MILTAG personnel figures indicate that their “civic action” program was being escalated, not decreased.84 We have seen that some months before Gestapu, a Suharto emissary with past CIA connections (Colonel Jan Walandouw) made contact with the U.S. government.\n\nFrom as early as May 1965, U.S. military suppliers with CIA connections (principally Lockheed) were negotiating equipment sales with payoffs to middlemen, in such a way as to generate payoffs to backers of the hitherto little-known leader of a new third faction in the army, Major-General Suharto — rather than to those backing Nasution or Yani, the titular leaders of the armed forces. Only in the last year has it been confirmed that secret funds administered by the U.S. Air Force (possibly on behalf of the CIA) were laundered as “commissions” on sales of Lockheed equipment and services, in order to make political payoffs to the military personnel of foreign countries.85\n\nA 1976 Senate investigation into these payoffs revealed, almost inadvertently, that in May 1965, over the legal objections of Lockheed’s counsel, Lockheed commissions in Indonesia had been redirected to a new contract and company set up by the firm’s long-time local agent or middleman.86 Its internal memos at the time show no reasons for the change, but in a later memo the economic counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta is reported as saying that there were “some political considerations behind it.”87 If this is true, it would suggest that in May 1965, five months before the coup, Lockheed had redirected its payoffs to a new political eminence, at the risk (as its assistant chief counsel pointed out) of being sued for default on its former contractual obligations.\n\nThe Indonesian middleman, August Munir Dasaad, was “known to have assisted Sukarno financially since the 1930’s.”88 In 1965, however, Dasaad was building connections with the Suharto forces, via a family relative, General Alamsjah, who had served briefly under Suharto in 1960, after Suharto completed his term at SESKOAD. Via the new contract, Lockheed, Dasaad and Alamsjah were apparently hitching their wagons to Suharto’s rising star:\n\nWhen the coup was made during which Suharto replaced Sukarno, Alamsjah, who controlled certain considerable funds, at once made these available to Suharto, which obviously earned him the gratitude of the new President. In due course he was appointed to a position of trust and confidence and today Alamsjah is, one might say, the second important man after the President.89\n\nThus in 1966 the U.S. Embassy advised Lockheed it should “continue to use” the Dasaad-Alamsjah-Suharto connection.90\n\nIn July 1965, at the alleged nadir of U.S.-Indonesian aid relations, Rockwell-Standard had a contractual agreement to deliver two hundred light aircraft (Aero-Commanders) to the Indonesian Army (not the Air Force) in the next two months.91 Once again the commission agent on the deal, Bob Hasan, was a political associate (and eventual business partner) of Suharto.92 More specifically, Suharto and Bob Hasan established two shipping companies to be operated by the Central Java army division, Diponegoro. This division, as has long been noticed, supplied the bulk of the personnel on both sides of the Gestapu coup drama — both those staging the coup attempt, and those putting it down. And one of the three leaders in the Central Java Gestapu movement was Lt. Col. Usman Sastrodibroto, chief of the Diponegoro Division’s “section dealing with extramilitary functions.”93\n\nThus of the two known U.S. military sales contracts from the eve of the Gestapu Putsch, both involved political payoffs to persons who emerged after Gestapu as close Suharto allies. The use of this traditional channel for CIA patronage suggests that the U.S. was not at arm’s length from the ugly political developments of 1965, despite the public indications, from both government spokesmen and the U.S. business press, that Indonesia was now virtually lost to communism and nothing could be done about it.\n\nThe actions of some U.S. corporations, moreover, made it clear that by early 1965 they expected a significant boost to the U.S. standing in Indonesia. For example, a recently declassified cable reveals that Freeport Sulphur had by April 1965 reached a preliminary “arrangement” with Indonesian officials for what would become a $500 million investment in West Papua copper. This gives the lie to the public claim that the company did not initiate negotiations with Indonesians (the inevitable Ibnu Sutowo) until February 1966.94 And in September 1965, shortly after World Oil reported that “indonesia’s gas and oil industry appeared to be slipping deeper into the political morass,”95 the president of a small oil company (Asamera) in a joint venture with Ibnu Sutowo’s Permina purchased $50,000 worth of shares in his own ostensibly-threatened company. Ironically this double purchase (on September 9 and September 21) was reported in the Wall Street Journal of September 30, 1965, the day of Gestapu.\n\nThe CIA’s “[One Word Deleted] Operation” in 1965\n\nLess than a year after Gestapu and the bloodbath, James Reston wrote appreciatively about them as\n\n“A Gleam of Light in Asia”:\n\nWashington is being careful not to claim any credit for this change in the sixth most populous and one of the richest nations in the world, but this does not mean that Washington had nothing to do with it. There was a great deal more contact between the anti-Communist forces in that country and at least one very high official in Washington before and during the Indonesian massacre than is generally realized.96\n\nAs for the CIA in 1965, we have the testimony of former CIA officer Ralph McGehee, curiously corroborated by the selective censorship of his former CIA employers:\n\nWhere the necessary circumstances or proofs are lacking to support U.S. intervention, the C.I.A. creates the appropriate situations or else invents them and disseminates its distortions worldwide via its media operations.\n\nA prominent example would be Chile…. Disturbed at the Chilean military’s unwillingness to take action against Allende, the C.I.A. forged a document purporting to reveal a leftist plot to murder Chilean military leaders. The discovery of this “plot” was headlined in the media and Allende was deposed and murdered.\n\nThere is a similarity between events that precipitated the overthrow of Allende and what happened in Indonesia in 1965. Estimates of the number of deaths that occurred as a result of the latter C.I.A. [one word deleted] operation run from one-half million to more than one million people.97\n\nMcGehee claims to have once seen, while reviewing CIA documents in Washington, a highly classified report on the agency’s role in provoking the destruction of the PKI after Gestapu. It seems appropriate to ask for congressional review and publication of any such report. If, as is alleged, it recommended such murderous techniques as a model for future operations, it would appear to document a major turning-point in the agency’s operation history: towards the systematic exploitation of the death squad operations which, absent during the Brazilian coup of 1964, made the Vietnam Phoenix counterinsurgency program notorious after 1967, and after 1968 spread from Guatemala to the rest of Latin America.98\n\nMcGehee’s claims of a CIA psychological warfare operation against Allende are corroborated by Tad Szulc:\n\nCIA agents in Santiago assisted Chilean military intelligence in drafting bogus Z-plan documents alleging that Allende and his supporters were planning to behead Chilean military commanders. These were issued by the junta to justify the coup.99\n\nIndeed the CIA deception operations against Allende appear to have gone even farther, terrifying both the left and the right with the fear of incipient slaughter by their enemies. Thus militant trade-unionists as well as conservative generals in Chile received small cards printed with the ominous words Djakarta se acerca (Jakarta is approaching).100\n\nThis is a model destabilization plan — to persuade all concerned that they no longer can hope to be protected by the status quo, and hence weaken the center, while inducing both right and left towards more violent provocation of each other. Such a plan appears to have been followed in Laos in 1959-61, where a CIA officer explained to a reporter that the aim “was to polarize Laos.”101 It appears to have been followed in Indonesia in 1965. Observers like Sundhaussen confirm that to understand the coup story of October 1965 we must look first of all at the “rumour market” which in 1965 … turned out the wildest stories.”102 On September 14, two weeks before the coup, the army was warned that there was a plot to assassinate army leaders four days later; a second such report was discussed at army headquarters on September 30.103 But a year earlier an alleged PKI document, which the PKI denounced as a forgery, had purported to describe a plan to overthrow “Nasutionists” through infiltration of the army. This “document,” which was reported in a Malaysian newspaper after being publicized by the pro-U.S. politician Chaerul Saleh104 in mid-December 1964, must have lent credence to Suharto’s call for an army unity meeting the next month.105\n\nThe army’s anxiety was increased by rumors, throughout 1965, that mainland China was smuggling arms to the PKI for an imminent revolt. Two weeks before Gestapu, a story to this effect also appeared in a Malaysian newspaper, citing Bangkok sources which relied in turn on Hong Kong sources.106 Such international untraceability is the stylistic hallmark of stories emanating in this period from what CIA insiders called their “mighty Wurlitzer,” the world-wide network of press “assets” through which the CIA, or sister agencies such as Britain’s MI-6, could plant unattributable disinformation.107 PKI demands for a popular militia or “fifth force,” and the training of PKI youth at Lubang Buaja, seemed much more sinister to the Indonesian army in the light of the Chinese arms stories.\n\nBut for months before the coup, the paranoia of the PKI had also been played on, by recurring reports that a CIA-backed “Council of Generals” was plotting to suppress the PKI. It was this mythical council, of course, that Untung announced as the target of his allegedly anti-CIA Gestapu coup. But such rumors did not just originate from anti-American sources; on the contrary, the first authoritative published reference to such a council was in a column of the Washington journalists Evans and Novak:\n\nAs far back as March, General Ibrahim Adjie, commander of the Siliwangi Division, had been quoted by two American journalists as saying of the Communists: “we knocked them out before [at Madiun]. We check them and check them again.” The same journalists claimed to have information that “…the Army has quietly established an advisory commission of five general officers to report to General Jani … and General Nasution … on PKI activities.”108\n\nMortimer sees the coincidence that five generals besides Yani were killed by Gestapu as possibly significant.\n\nBut we should also be struck by the revival in the United States of the image of Yani and Nasution as anti-PKI planners, long after the CIA and U.S. press stories had in fact written them off as unwilling to act against Sukarno.109 If the elimination by Gestapu of Suharto’s political competitors in the army was to be blamed on the left, then the scenario required just such a revival of the generals’ forgotten anti-Communist image in opposition to Sukarno. An anomalous unsigned August 1965 profile of Nasution in The New York Times, based on an 1963 interview but published only after a verbal attack by Nasution on British bases in Singapore, does just this: it claims (quite incongruously, given the context) that Nasution is “considered the strongest opponent of Communism in Indonesia”; and adds that Sukarno, backed by the PKI, “has been pursuing a campaign to neutralize the … army as an anti-Communist force.”110\n\nIn the same month of August 1965, fear of an imminent showdown between “the PKI and the Nasution group” was fomented in Indonesia by an underground pamphlet; this was distributed by the CIA’s long-time asset, the PSI, whose cadres were by now deeply involved:\n\nThe PKI is combat ready. The Nasution group hope the PKI will be the first to draw the trigger, but this the PKI will not do. The PKI will not allow itself to be provoked as in the Madiun Incident. In the end, however, there will be only two forces left: the PKI and the Nasution group. The middle will have no alternative but to choose and get protection from the stronger force.111\n\nOne could hardly hope to find a better epitome of the propaganda necessary for the CIA’s program of engineering paranoia.\n\nMcGehee’s article, after censorship by the CIA, focuses more narrowly on the CIA’s role in anti-PKI propaganda alone:\n\nThe Agency seized upon this opportunity [Suharto’s response to Gestapu] and set out to destroy the P.K.I…. [eight sentences deleted]…. Media fabrications played a key role in stirring up popular resentment against the P.K.I. Photographs of the bodies of the dead generals — badly decomposed — were featured in all the newspapers and on television. Stories accompanying the pictures falsely claimed that the generals had been castrated and their eyes gouged out by Communist women. This cynically manufactured campaign was designed to foment public anger against the Communists and set the stage for a massacre.112\n\nMcGehee might have added that the propaganda stories of torture by hysterical women with razor blades, which serious scholars dismiss as groundless, were revived in a more sophisticated version by a U.S. journalist, John Hughes, who is now the chief spokesman for the State Department.113\n\nSuharto’s forces, particularly Col. Sarwo Edhie of the RPKAD commandos, were overtly involved in the cynical exploitation of the victims’ bodies.114 But some aspects of the massive propaganda campaign appear to have been orchestrated by non-Indonesians. A case in point is the disputed editorial in support of Gestapu which appeared in the October 2 issue of the PKI newspaper Harian Rakjat. Professors Benedict Anderson and Ruth McVey, who have questioned the authenticity of this issue, have also ruled out the possibility that the newspaper was “an Army falsification,” on the grounds that the army’s “competence … at falsifying party documents has always been abysmally low.”115\n\nThe questions raised by Anderson and McVey have not yet been adequately answered. Why did the PKI show no support for the Gestapu coup while it was in progress, then rashly editorialize in support of Gestapu after it had been crushed? Why did the PKI, whose editorial gave support to Gestapu, fail to mobilize its followers to act on Gestapu’s behalf? Why did Suharto, by then in control of Jakarta, close down all newspapers except this one, and one other left-leaning newspaper which also served his propaganda ends?116 Why, in other words, did Suharto on October 2 allow the publication of only two Jakarta newspapers, two which were on the point of being closed down forever?\n\nAs was stated at the outset, it would be foolish to suggest that in 1965 the only violence came from the U.S. government, the Indonesian military, and their mutual contacts in British and Japanese intelligence. A longer paper could also discuss the provocative actions of the PKI, and of Sukarno himself, in this tragedy of social breakdown. Assuredly, from one point of view, no one was securely in control of events in this troubled period.117\n\nAnd yet for two reasons such a fashionably objective summation of events seems inappropriate. In the first place, as the CIA’s own study concedes, we are talking about “one of the ghastliest and most concentrated bloodlettings of current times,” one whose scale of violence seems out of all proportion to such well-publicized left-wing acts as the murder of an army lieutenant at the Bandar Betsy plantation in May 1965,118 And, in the second place, the scenario described by McGehee for 1965 can be seen as not merely responding to the provocations, paranoia, and sheer noise of events in that year, but as actively encouraging and channeling them.\n\nIt should be noted that former CIA Director William Colby has repeatedly denied that there was CIA or other U.S. involvement in the massacre of 1965. (In the absence of a special CIA Task Force, Colby, as head of the CIA’s Far Eastern Division from 1962-66, would normally have been responsible for the CIA’s operations in Indonesia.) Colby’s denial is however linked to the discredited story of a PKI plot to seize political power, a story that he revived in 1978:\n\nIndonesia exploded, with a bid for power by the largest Communist Party in the world outside the curtain, which killed the leadership of the army with Sukarno’s tacit approval and then was decimated in reprisal. CIA provided a steady flow of reports on the process in Indonesia, although it did not have any role in the course of events themselves.119\n\nIt is important to resolve the issue of U.S. involvement in this systematic murder operation, and particularly to learn more about the CIA account of this which McGehee claims to have seen. McGehee tells us: “The Agency was extremely proud of its successful [one word deleted] and recommended it as a model for future operations [one-half sentence deleted].”120 Ambassador Green reports of an interview with Nixon in 1967:\n\nThe Indonesian experience had been one of particular interest to [Nixon] because things had gone well in Indonesia.\n\nI think he was very interested in that whole experience as pointing to the way we [!] should handle our relationships on a wider basis in Southeast Asia generally, and maybe in the world.121\n\nSuch unchallenged assessments help explain the role of Indonesians in the Nixon-sponsored overthrow of Sihanouk in Cambodia in 1970, the use of the Jakarta scenario for the overthrow of Allende in Chile in 1973, and the U.S. sponsorship today of the death squad regimes in Central America.122\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, U.S.A., December 1984\n\n1. The difficulties of this analysis, based chiefly on the so-called “evidence” presented at the Mahmilub trials, will be obvious to anyone who has tried to reconcile the conflicting accounts of Gestapu in, e.g., the official Suharto account by Nugroho Notosusanto and Ismail Saleh, and the somewhat less fanciful CIA study of 1968, both referred to later. I shall draw only on those parts of the Mahmilub evidence which limit or discredit their anti-PKI thesis. For interpretation of the Mahmilub data, cf. especially Coen Holtzappel, “The 30 September Movement,” Journal of Contemporary Asia, IX, 2 (1979), pp. 216-40. The case for general skepticism is argued by Rex Mortimer, Indonesian Communism Under Sukarno (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1974), pp. 421-3; and more forcefully, by Julie Southwood and Patrick Flanagan, Indonesia: Law, Propaganda, and Terror (London: Zed Press, 1983), pp. 126-34.\n\n2. At his long-delayed trial in 1978, Gestapu plotter Latief confirmed earlier revelations that he had visited his old commander Suharto on the eve of the Gestapu kidnappings. He claimed that he raised with Suharto the existence of an alleged right-wing “Council of Generals” plotting to seize power, and informed him “of a movement which was intended to thwart the plan of the generals’ council for a coup d’etat” (Anon., “The Latief Case: Suharto’s Involvement Revealed,” Journal of Contemporary Asia, IX, 2 [1979], pp. 248-50). For a more comprehensive view of Suharto’s involvement in Gestapu, cf. especially W.F. Wertheim, “Whose Plot? New Light on the 1965 Events,” Journal of Contemporary Asia, IX, 2 (1979), pp. 197-215; Holtzappel, “The 30 September,” in contrast, points more particularly to intelligence officers close to the banned Murba party of Chaerul Saleh and Adam Malik: cf. fn. 104.\n\n3. The three phases are: (1) “Gestapu,” the induced left-wing “coup”; (2) “KAP-Gestapu,” or the anti-Gestapu “response,” massacring the PKI; (3) the progressive erosion of Sukarno’s remaining power. This paper will chiefly discuss Gestapu / KAP-Gestapu, the first two phases. To call the first phase by itself a “coup” is in my view an abuse of terminology: there is no real evidence that in this phase political power changed hands or that this was the intention.\n\n4.

In addition, one of the two Gestapu victims in Central Java (Colonel Katamso) was the only non-PKI official of rank to attend the PKI’s nineteenth anniversary celebration in Jogjakarta in May 1964: Mortimer, Indonesian Communism, p. 432. Ironically, the belated “discovery” of his corpse was used to trigger off the purge of his PKI contacts.\n\n7. Four of the six pro-Yani representatives in January were killed along with Yani on October 1. Of the five anti-Yani representatives in January, we shall see that at least three were prominent in “putting down” Gestapu and completing the elimination of the Yani-Sukarno loyalists (the three were Suharto, Basuki Rachmat, and Sudirman of SESKOAD, the Indonesian Army Staff and Command School): Crouch, The Army, p. 81n.\n\n8.

Crouch, The Army, p. 40; Brian May, The Indonesian Tragedy (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978), pp. 221-2.\n\n11. I shall assume for this condensed argument that Untung was the author, or at least approved, of the statements issued in his name. Scholars who see Untung as a dupe of Gestapu’s controllers note that Untung was nowhere near the radio station broadcasting in his name, and that he appears to have had little or no influence over the task force which occupied it (under Captain Suradi of the intelligence service of Colonel Latief’s Brigade): Holtzappel, pp. 218, 231-2, 236-7. I have no reason to contradict those careful analysts of Gestapu — such as Wertheim, “Whose Plot?” p. 212, and Holtzappel, “The 30 September,” p. 231 — who conclude that Untung personally was sincere, and manipulated by other dalangs such as Sjam.\n\n12.

Anderson and McVey concluded that Sukarno, Air Force Chief Omar Dhani, PKI Chairman Aidit (the three principal political targets of Suharto’s anti-Gestapu “response”) were rounded up by the Gestapu plotters in the middle of the night, and taken to Halim air force base, about one mile from the well at Lubang Buaja where the generals’ corpses were discovered. In 1966 they surmised that this was “to seal the conspirators’ control of the bases,” and to persuade Sukarno “to go along with” the conspirators’ plans (Benedict Anderson and Ruth McVey, A Preliminary Analysis of the October 1, 1965, Coup in Indonesia [Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1971], pp. 19-21). An alternative hypothesis of course is that Gestapu, by bringing these men together against their will, created the semblance of a PKI-air force-Sukarno conspiracy which would later be exploited by Suharto. Sukarno’s presence at Halim “was later to provide Sukarno’s critics with some of their handiest ammunition” (John Hughes, The End of Sukarno [London: Angus and Robertson, 1978], p. 54).\n\n17. CIA Study, p. 2; cf. p. 65: “At the height of the coup … the troops of the rebels [in Central Java] were estimated to have the strength of only one battalion; during the next two days, these forces gradually melted away.”\n\n18. Rudolf Mrazek, The United States and the Indonesian Military, 1945-1966 (Prague: Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, 1978), vol. II, p. 172. These battalions, comprising the bulk of the 3rd Paratroop Brigade, also supplied the bulk of the troops used to put down Gestapu in Jakarta. The subordination of these two factions in this supposed civil war to a single close command structure under Suharto is cited to explain how Suharto was able to restore order in the city without gunfire. Meanwhile out at the Halim air force base an alleged gun battle between the 454th (Green Beret) and RPKAD (Red Beret) paratroops went off “without the loss of a single man” (CIA Study, p. 60). In Central Java, also, power “changed hands silently and peacefully,” with “an astonishing lack of violence” (CIA Study, p. 66).\n\n19. Ibid., p. 60n; Arthur J. Dommen, “The Attempted Coup in Indonesia,” China Quarterly, January-March 1966, p. 147. The first “get-acquainted” meeting of the Gestapu plotters is placed in the Indonesian chronology of events from “sometimes before August 17, 1965”; cf. Nugroho Notosusanto and Ismail Saleh, The Coup Attempt of the “September 30 Movement” in Indonesia (Jakarta: [Pembimbing Masa, 1968], p. 13); in the CIA Study, this meeting is dated September 6 (p. 112). Neither account allows more than a few weeks to plot a coup in the world’s fifth most populous country.\n\n20. Mortimer, Indonesian Communism, p. 429.\n\n21. Of the six General Staff officers appointed along with Yani, three (Suprapto, D.I. Pandjaitan, and S. Parman) were murdered. Of the three survivors, two (Mursjid and Pranoto) were removed by Suharto in the next eight months. The last member of Yani’s staff, Djamin Gintings, was used by Suharto during the establishment of the New Order, and ignored thereafter.\n\n22.

As the head of the PKI’s secret Special Bureau, responsible only to Aidit, Sjam by his own testimony provided leadership to the “progressive officers” of Gestapu. The issue of PKI involvement in Gestapu thus rests on the question of whether Sjam was manipulating the Gestapu leadership on behalf of the PKI, or the PKI leadership on behalf of the army. There seems to be no disagreement that Sjam was (according to the CIA Study, p. 107) a longtime “double agent” and professed “informer for the Djakarta Military Command.” Wertheim (p. 203) notes that in the 1950s Sjam “was a cadre of the PSI,” and “had also been in touch with Lt. Col. Suharto, today’s President, who often came to stay in his house in Jogja.” This might help explain why in the 1970s, after having been sentenced to death, Sjam and his co-conspirator Supeno were reportedly “allowed out [of prison] from time to time and wrote reports for the army on the political situation” (May, The Indonesian, p. 114). Additionally, the “Sjam” who actually testified and was convicted, after being “captured” on March 9, 1967, was the third individual to be identified by the army as the “Sjam” of whom Untung had spoken: Declassified Documents Retrospective Collection (Washington, D.C.: Carrollton Press, 1976), 613C; Hughes, p. 25.\n\n32.

Few Americans have endorsed the conclusion of Wertheim that “the so-called communist revolt of Madiun … was probably more or less provoked by anti-communist elements”; yet Kahin has suggested that the events leading to Madiun “may have been symptomatic of a general and widespread government drive aimed at cutting down the military strength of the PKI” (W.F.

In the meantime, with Western help, free Asian political leaders — together with the military — must not only hold on and manage, but reform and advance while liquidating the enemy’s political and guerrilla armies.”\n\n44.

Published U.S. accounts of the Civic Mission / “civic action” programs describe them as devoted to “civic projects — rehabilitating canals, draining swampland to create new rice paddies, building bridges and roads, and so on (Roger Hilsman, To Move a Nation [Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1967], p. 377). But a memo to President Johnson from Secretary of State Rusk, on July 17, 1964, makes it clear that at that time the chief importance of MILTAG was for its contact with anti-Communist elements in the Indonesian Army and its Territorial Organization: “Our aid to Indonesia … we are satisfied … is not helping Indonesia militarily. It is however, permitting us to maintain some contact with key elements in Indonesia which are interested in and capable of resisting Communist takeover. We think this is of vital importance to the entire Free World” (Declassified Documents Quarterly Catalogue, 1982, 001786 [DOS Memo for President of July 17, 1964; italics in original]).\n\n47.

II, p. 139, citing interview of Nasution with George Kahin, July 8, 1963.\n\n50. Pauker, though modest in assessing his own political influence, does claim that a RAND paper he wrote on counterinsurgency and social justice, ignored by the U.S. military for whom it was intended, was influential in the development of his friend Suwarto’s Civic Mission doctrine.\n\n51.

Sundhaussen, The Road, pp. 178-9. The PSI of course was neither monolithic nor a simple instrument of U.S. policy. But the real point is that, in this 1963 incident as in others, we see conspiratorial activity relevant to the military takeover, involving PSI and other individuals who were at the focus of U.S. training programs, and who would play an important role in 1965.\n\n53. Sundhaussen, The Road, pp. 228-33: in January 1966 the “PSI activists” in Bandung “knew exactly what they were aiming at, which was nothing less than the overthrow of Sukarno. Moreover, they had the protection of much of the Siliwangi officer corps” Once again, I use Sundhaussen’s term “PSI-leaning” to denote a milieu, not to explain it. Sarwo Edhie was a long-time CIA contact, while Kemal Idris’ role in 1965 may owe much to his former PETA commander the Japanese intelligence officer Yanagawa. Cf. Masashi Nishihara, The Japanese and Sukarno’s Indonesia (Honolulu: University Press of Hawaii, 1976), pp. 138, 212.\n\n54. Sundhaussen, The Road, pp. 99-101. Lubis was also a leader in the November 1957 assassination attempt against Sukarno, and the 1958 rebellion.\n\n55. Ibid., 188; cf. p. 159n.\n\n56. Suharto’s “student” status does not of course mean that he was a mere pawn in the hands of those with whom he established contact at SESKOAD. For example, Suharto’s independence from the PSI and those close to them became quite evident in January 1974, when he and Ali Murtopo cracked down on those responsible for army-tolerated student riots reminiscent of the one in May 1963. Cf. Crouch, The Army, pp. 309-17.\n\n57. Sundhaussen, The Road, pp. 228, 241-43. In the same period SESKOAD was used for the political re-education of generals like Surjosumpeno, who, although anti-Communist, were guilty of loyalty to Sukarno (p. 238).\n\n58. Crouch, The Army, p. 80; at this time Suharto was already unhappy with Sukarno’s “rising pro-communist policy” (Roeder, The Smiling, p. 9).\n\n59. Crouch, The Army, p. 81; cf.

Through his intelligence group OPSUS (headed by Ali Murtopo) Suharto made contact with Malaysian leaders; in two accounts former PSI and PRRI / Permesta personnel in Malaysia played a role in setting up this sensitive political liaison: Crouch, The Army, p. 74; Nishihara, The Japanese, p. 149.\n\n62.

Edward Luttwak, Coup D’Etat: A Practical Handbook (London: Allen Lane / Penguin Press, 1968), p. 61: “though Communist-infiltrated army units were very powerful they were in the wrong place; while they sat in the Borneo jungles the anti-Communist paratroops and marines took over Jakarta, and the country.” What is most interesting in this informed account by Luttwak (who has worked for years with the CIA) is that “the anti-Communist paratroops” included not only the RPKAD but those who staged the Gestapu uprising in Jakarta, before putting it down.\n\n65. Nishihara, The Japanese, pp. 142, 149.\n\n66.Ibid., p. 202, cf. p. 207. The PRRI / Permesta veterans engaged in the OPSUS peace feelers, Daan Mogot and Willy Pesik, had with Jan Walandouw been part of a 1958 PRRI secret mission to Japan, a mission detailed in the inside account by former CIA officer Joseph B. Smith (Portrait of a Cold Warrior [New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 1976], p. 245), following which Walandouw flew on “to Taipeh, then Manila and New York.”\n\n67. Personal communication. If the account of Neville Maxwell (senior research officer at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, Oxford University) can be believed, then the planning of the Gestapu / anti-Gestapu scenario may well have begun in 1964 (Journal of Contemporary Asia, IX, 2 [1979], pp. 251-2; reprinted in Southwood and Flanagan, Indonesia: Law, p. 13): “A few years ago I was researching in Pakistan into the diplomatic background of the 1965 Indo-Pakistan conflict, and in foreign ministry papers to which I had been given access came across a letter to the then foreign minister, Mr. Bhutto, from one of his ambassadors in Europe … reporting a conversation with a Dutch intelligence officer with NATO. According to my note of that letter, the officer had remarked to the Pakistani diplomat that ‘Indonesia was going to fall into the Western lap like a rotten apple.’ Western intelligence agencies, he said, would organize a ‘premature communist coup … [which would be] foredoomed to fail, providing a legitimate and welcome opportunity to the army to crush the communists and make Soekarno a prisoner of the army’s goodwill.’ The ambassador’s report was dated December 1964.”\n\n68.

The lame-duck Eisenhower NSC memo would have committed the U.S. to oppose not just the PKI in Indonesia, but “a policy increasingly friendly toward the Sino-Soviet bloc on the part of whatever regime is in power.” “The size and importance of Indonesia,” it concluded, “dictate [!] a vigorous U.S. effort to prevent these contingencies”: Declassified Documents Quarterly Catalogue, 1982, 000592 (NSC 6023 of 19 December, 1960).

Before 1963 the existence as well as the amount of the MAP in Indonesia was withheld from the public; retroactively, figures were published. After 1962 the total deliveries of military aid declined dramatically, but were aimed more and more particularly at anti-PKI and anti-Sukarno plotters in the army; cf. fns. 46, 76 and 83.\n\n74.

A Senate amendment in 1964 to cut off all aid to Indonesia unconditionally was quietly killed in conference committee, on the misleading ground that the Foreign Assistance Act “requires the President to report fully and concurrently to both Houses of the Congress on any assistance furnished to Indonesia” (U.S. Cong., Senate, Report No. 88-1925, Foreign Assistance Act of 1964, p. 11). In fact the act’s requirement that the president report “to Congress” applied to eighteen other countries, but in the case of Indonesia he was to report to two Senate Committees and the speaker of the House: Foreign Assistance Act, Section 620(j).\n\n76.

As Hersh points out, Green Beret assassination teams that operated inside South Vietnam routinely dressed as Vietcong cadre while on missions. Thus the alleged U.S. plan of 1968, which was reportedly approved “shortly after Nixon’s inauguration … ‘at the highest level of government,'” called for an assassination of a moderate at the center by apparent leftists, as a pretext for a right-wing seizure of power. This raises an interesting question, albeit outlandish: did the earlier anti-Sukarno operation call for foreign elements to be infiltrated into the Gestapu forces murdering the generals? Holtzappel (“The 30 September,” p. 222) has suspected “the use of outsiders who are given suitable disguises to do a dirty job.” He points to trial witnesses from Untung’s battalion and the murder team who “declared under oath not to have known … their battalion commander.” Though these witnesses themselves would not have been foreigners, foreigners could have infiltrated more easily into their ranks than into a regular battalion.\n\nManaging Indonesia\n\n——————————————————————————–\n\n1. The Coup That Failed\n\nDuring the last months of 1965 the Indonesian nation was gripped in a great and tragic madness. It was one of those times in human affairs when the assumptions on which civic life depends are swept away in a flood of hate and violence. In the capital city of Jakarta the children of the elite took to the streets, and public buildings were sacked. In the countryside of Java and Bali, villagers attacked their neighbors with knives and machetes. The dead were too numerous to count; estimates ran into the hundreds of thousands. By the time the killing came to an end, the third largest Communist party in the world lay destroyed.\n\nIt is in the nature of such events that controversy should surround the central questions they present. 1\n\nMuch of the controversy has concerned the role the Communist party of Indonesia played in the violent coup attempt that set so many other bloody events in motion. Another controversial subject has been the extent to which Sukarno himself might have known in advance about the attempted coup by dissident army officers. Still other questions have concerned the role of Soeharto, the army general who succeeded to power in the aftermath of the killings, and the role of the Chinese and the Americans in the affair. Yet, by far the most disturbing question has been how so many people could die, not anonymously as in modern warfare, but at the hands of their neighbors.\n\nWholly satisfactory answers to these questions will probably continue to elude us. Too many participants are dead, too many survivors silent. The trauma remains one from which the society can hardly be said to have recovered.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to search out as best one can the true nature of what happened. For these violent events, and the perceptions of those who survived them, contain the origins of much of what followed.\n\nThe Immediate Background to the Coup\n\nThe story begins in Jakarta in August 1965. It was a time of great discord in Indonesia’s national government. President Sukarno seemed nominally supreme in his command of state affairs, but this was far from the actual case. He had presided over the banishment from public life of a growing number of nationally prominent personalities and their parties, until his government no longer represented a large portion of the nation’s elite. As his political base narrowed, his role was increasingly reduced to that of balancing the interests and ambitions of the two powerful groups that remained, the Communist party and the army. The party leaders and the army had been deeply divided over a number of issues for many years. Neither side doubted that some kind of showdown would eventually occur between them. At the time, however, both had reason to feel unprepared for such a test of strength.\n\nThe Communist Party of Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia, or PKI) had suffered a serious setback during the previous year. Breaking with its own long-term strategy of working in concert with other major groups in the national front, the party had struck out on its own in urging tenant farmers in Central and East Java to take “unilateral action” against their landlords, to make the land they tilled their own. But the campaign was disastrously ill conceived and considerable violence occurred; in the end the party’s rural forces were bested. Meanwhile, the party was progressing in its efforts to infiltrate the army officer corps, but the number of officers it could rely on in a physical showdown was small.\n\nThe leadership of the Indonesian National Army (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, or TNI) had meanwhile been shaken by evidence of significant disunity in its own senior ranks. A seminar that had been called earlier in the year to draw the army’s regional commanders together in a unified stand on matters of national policy had degenerated into polemics. It was the first such meeting since the regional rebellions of the late 1950s had been put down. In the political environment of 1965, army unity in ideological matters had become a high priority. According to participants, a significant minority of commanders held out in support of Sukarno’s increasingly leftist domestic and international priorities.\n\nIn the background lay Indonesia’s “confrontation” against neighboring Malaysia. The decision to “confront” the founding of Malaysia in late 1963 may well have been the result of happenstance as much as studied Indonesian intent. In any case, the time could not have been worse from the Indonesian point of view. The country was in the midst of a prolonged drought; rice production was down, and food was in short supply. In addition, the confrontation campaign disrupted Indonesia’s exports and this, in turn, reduced not only the country’s earnings of foreign exchange, but also the government’s revenues, the bulk of which came from taxes on foreign trade. Thus the government was increasingly obliged to finance its own operations by printing paper money. Inflation spiraled. Among the urban population, many of whom depended on civil servants’ incomes, the conditions of daily life became harsh indeed.\n\nThe campaign against Malaysia created serious problems for the Indonesian armed forces. The army was organized and trained for territorial defense; most of its units had no experience outside their native provinces. The air and naval arms necessary for invasion had proven hopelessly inadequate in the West Irian campaign. The army leadership also mistrusted both the air and naval services; they had been equipped and trained in recent years by the Russians, and their leaders were on good terms with the local Communist party leaders. Moreover, army intelligence had little knowledge of what awaited invading forces on their arrival on the Malayan peninsula; the first small units sent ashore on intelligence and sabotage missions had been quickly rounded up. But the balance of military forces on either side of the Straits of Malacca was not what weighed most heavily on the army commanders. Their main concern was the domestic political situation. From the outset they had to avoid the Communist party outflanking them on an issue of such strong nationalist appeal. As plans for the invasion of Malaysia advanced, they also had to avoid having their best and most loyal officers and their units removed from Java. The recent Communist party campaign in the countryside of Java left army commanders deeply concerned about their own rear defenses. From late 1964 on, Indonesian army intelligence officers were in secret communication with their opposite numbers in Kuala Lumpur, with a view to limiting the scale and costs of engagement. 2\n\nThe anti-Malaysia campaign presented the Communist party, on the other hand, with an opportunity to strengthen its standing with Sukarno and to isolate Indonesia still further from the Western powers. Sukarno was deeply committed personally to the anti-Malaysia policy but, after almost two years, little had happened beyond the war of propaganda; the army was obviously dragging its feet. By the beginning of 1965 the Communist party was pressing for a full role in the cabinet, and under the ground rules Sukarno himself had laid down, the party could not be denied indefinitely. In the early months of the year the party had further unnerved the generals by making two even more threatening proposals: (1) that the commanders of the armed forces, at every level, should be advised by a “troika” of political commissars, one of whom would represent the Communist party; and (2) that “workers and peasants” should be armed in a “fifth force” for the “safeguarding of the revolution.” By March 1965 Sukarno was receiving intelligence reports that some army commanders were making plans to overthrow him. In May he began to support the “troika” idea.\n\nThese developments thoroughly alarmed the army leadership, as well as many in the civilian elite. Lt. Gen. Achmad Yani, the army commander-in-chief, was now meeting regularly with a “brain trust” of his closest associates to discuss the army’s deteriorating political position. He protested the party proposals. He denied reports of an army plot against the president. But the party initiatives had placed him and his colleagues thoroughly on the defensive, and civilian friends wondered how long the army could stave off the PKI’s accession to formal power.\n\nAll this fed into the tension that was mounting in the background when, on August 3, Sukarno suddenly fell ill. The precise nature of his illness was never clear. He had had a long-term kidney condition and periodically sought treatment in Vienna. On this occasion, however, a team of Chinese doctors was flown in from Beijing, and Sukarno’s personal staff was totally mute about his condition. The impact this development had on both the party and army leaders is not difficult to imagine. Indeed, both were soon engaged in planning their moves should Sukarno suddenly die. Within a few days, Sukarno was said to be recovering; soon he was said to be preparing his annual address for Independence Day on August 17. But leaders of the party and the army were now receiving reports that the other was on the verge of a coup. By early September the Jakarta press was referring to rumors of a possible coup by either the army or the party. As things turned out, it was the army’s most senior officers who were caught unprepared.\n\nThe Coup and Its Aftermath\n\nIn the early hours of October 1 General Yani and five of his closest army associates, all general officers, were routed from their beds by units of the presidential security guard and told the president wished to see them immediately. Three resisted and were shot and killed on the spot; the other three were bundled into trucks and taken away, along with the bodies of the three dead. The most senior general of all, Abdul Haris Nasution, the celebrated former army commander and now Minister of Defense, also was sought at his home that night but escaped, although an aide was killed and Nasution’s young daughter mortally wounded. (Nasution had gone over a garden wall to the grounds of the Iraqi ambassador’s neighboring residence, but broke his leg in the fall and remained hidden there until well after dawn.)\n\nThe following morning Radio Indonesia announced that army units under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Untung, the commander of a battalion of the presidential guard, had forestalled a coup that was planned by a Council of Generals. The statement declared, inter alia: “Power-mad generals and officers who have neglected the lot of their men and who above the accumulated sufferings of their men have lived in luxury, led a gay life, insulted our women and wasted government funds, must be kicked out of the army and punished accordingly. The army is not for generals, but is the possession of all the soldiers of the army who are loyal to the ideals of the Revolution of August 1945.” 3 A later broadcast reported that a Revolutionary Council would be named as the “source of all authority in the Republic of Indonesia.” 4 President Sukarno was said to be safe, but his whereabouts were not disclosed.\n\nIn a matter of hours, amid continued uncertainty about where either Sukarno or the missing generals were, the uprising was brought under control by Major General Soeharto, commander of the Army Strategic Reserve, without a shot being fired. Sukarno was found to have gone to a nearby air base, as had D. N. Aidit, the leader of the Communist party. The army occupied the air base during the night of October 1, after Sukarno had been advised to leave and the Communist party chairman had fled. The bodies of all six missing generals were found a few days later in a well on the edge of the base. Nasution’s daughter died of her wounds soon thereafter. The violence of these deaths, coupled with the breach of Guided Democracy convention, infuriated the army leadership that remained and deeply shocked many of the civilian elite.\n\nMeanwhile, the leaders of several army units in Central Java declared their support for the Revolutionary Council. The mayors of several towns did the same. There were a few mass demonstrations of support by local communist organizations. Otherwise, the province remained in a state of suspended animation until mid-October, when a battalion of paratroopers arrived from Jakarta to bring the rebel units to heel. The arrival of this battalion seems to have spurred the local Left to action. Roadblocks were set up; telephone lines were cut. The paratroopers made a show of strength in one town after another, and by the end of the month the rebel army units agreed to follow orders and leave the province.\n\nBy this time, however, attacks were beginning on Communist party offices and on Chinese property in several cities of Central Java, anticommunist demonstrators had been fired on, and reports were circulating that religious and nationalist leaders had been killed. By early November, still able to control only a single town at a time, the paratroopers began arming youths from religious and nationalist organizations. The affair was soon thoroughly one-sided, and killings occurred on a massive scale.\n\nA short story written by Umar Kayyam in 1966 provides a fictional account, based on an eyewitness interview, of an army “sweep” through a rural communist stronghold:\n\nSuddenly people were running through the streets screaming that the army had taken the village of B. The army had moved in quickly and silently, passing through barricades the people had thought impenetrable, attacking without warning. What kind of force were they dealing with? Some kind of spirit? The army was everywhere.\n\nThe farmers, drilled by Hassan and their own leaders, fought relentlessly. They took up guns, Molotov cocktails, sharpened bamboo poles, any available weapon. The reactionary army was their enemy. It had come and it would kill them and rob them of their land unless they destroyed it first.\n\nBut one by one the villages of the Subdistrict fell. Resistance was soon crushed, and the outcome of the fighting was horrible. Insufficiently trained, the farmers resisted blindly and in a single day the whole (of) T. had fallen and was occupied by the army. The farmers in their frenzy set fire to their own homes and granaries. Those who didn’t surrender were cut down mercilessly. Corpses lay sprawled on the dikes of the rice fields, along the banks of the rivers, and on the footpaths throughout the countryside. One quarter of the inhabitants of the Subdistrict were dead and nearly half of the surviving men taken captive. 5\n\nIn East Java no army units declared support for the Revolutionary Council. The commander of the naval base at Surabaya did so, however, on October 1, and the following day the communist labor union began a previously announced program of taking over the state enterprises in the province. On October 13 the Islamic youth organization, Ansor, held rallies in several towns, which were followed by attacks on Communist party offices; at one such rally, eleven party supporters were hacked to death. On October 18 a clash between communist and Ansor youth left ninety-seven dead. In the next few days several thousand Communist party supporters were reported massacred. Army units seemed to have been directly involved in the killing by the end of October, but chiefly in the towns. In the villages religious leaders seemed to have been given their head. By mid-November killings had taken place throughout the province. 6\n\nIn Bali rumors were soon circulating about what was happening in Central and East Java. On November 11 a clash between communist and Nationalist Party youths left seven dead. By the first week of December the killing was widespread.\n\nFictional accounts tell of youths interrogating their friends and former teachers, even their family doctors. Brutal beatings took place. Groups were taken to a river bank and shot. Others were made to sit at the edge of their graves, and then shot. 7\n\nSatyagraha Hoerip, in “The Climax,” describes a district in which hundreds were killed in a three-week period. “Even those with only minimal connections [with the Communist party] had been killed. Others were given to the authorities, then taken back at night and taken out of town.” 8 The story’s narrator describes his efforts, eventually successful, to avoid killing his brother-in-law.\n\nIn each province, after several weeks of this mass butchery, local army leaders appeared to have decided that the violence had gone far enough. By late November military authorities in Central Java had prohibited unauthorized arrests and were warning against “excesses.” By the end of December those in East Java were doing the same. In Bali paratroopers had to be rushed from Central Java to bring the situation under control. But violence continued in all three provinces well into 1966.\n\nEqually fierce action was taken against Communist party members and supporters in several other parts of Indonesia. In Aceh, in the far north of Sumatra, the population was, as it is now, overwhelmingly Islamic, and Communist party followers were few in number, perhaps totaling only several thousand; attacks on them were sufficient for the military commander to announce in December that the province had been “entirely purged in a physical sense of PKI elements.” 9 In the adjoining province of North Sumatra, members of an army-supported labor union attacked members of the Communist party’s union, many of them migrants from Java working on state plantations; members of Muslim and Christian youth groups attacked other known Communist party followers in the vicinity of Siantar, again with the loss of several thousand lives. In West Java, where the Communist party was not particularly strong, the army might have forestalled wider killing by its quick arrest of more than ten thousand party activists; close to ten thousand others were estimated to have been killed there nevertheless. In these and other parts of Indonesia, however, the scale of violence did not approach that of the densely populated provinces of Central and East Java and Bali.\n\nWho Was Responsible?\n\nMuch later, men close to the army leadership of the time would deny that any central command ever authorized army units to carry out mass executions. They have argued that initially the army was not at all in control of the situation in much of Java. Some of the army’s most trusted commanders and their units had already been removed from Java and were in North Sumatra and West Kalimantan, committed to the campaign against Malaysia. The army has also claimed that it was in fact the army itself that eventually brought the killings to an end. Nevertheless, the army certainly played an active role in the deaths of countless numbers of people, not only through the paratroopers sent to Central Java under the command of Gen. Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, who made no attempt to disguise the role his men played, but also through the many civilian youths whom these and other units organized, armed, and transported. At no time did General Nasution, General Soeharto, or any other figure in the army leadership publicly condemn these actions of army units, or call publicly for an end to the violence. The army leadership knew more or less what was happening and, by its action and inaction, sanctioned it.\n\nYet, it is also true that much of the killing, with and without army involvement, was carried out by civilians. In Central Java these were principally members of the conservative wing of the National Party, the once-dominant party in the region, commanding the loyalties of the traditional elite down to the leaders of the villages. The Nationalists had seen their position steadily eroded as Communist party strength grew, challenging their heritage as the major party of the national revolution, the party of Sukarno, the rightful heir to the positions and perquisites of the former colonial regime. They also had witnessed a deep split in their party over whether to enter into an alliance with the Communist party or stand apart from it. The same was true in Bali. In East Java, on the other hand, the killing was done principally by followers of the Nahdatul Ulama, the region’s major Islamic party, led by its youth wing, Ansor.\n\nEvidence also indicates that some of the worst of the killing was centered in areas that had previously seen violence between Communists and anti-Communists. In September 1948, when the republican government was confronted by superior Dutch forces in Java, its own military and paramilitary units experienced great dissension. A group of procommunist officers took control of the town of Madiun, declared a revolutionary government, and touched off an ill-coordinated and poorly executed revolt. Communist party leaders, apparently caught unprepared, nevertheless gave the revolt their support. Loyal army units, among which the Siliwangi Division was most prominent, recaptured the town of Madiun in two weeks and put down the entire rebellion in two months. Armed rebel units, however, killed scores of civilians in the surrounding district in the course of the rebellion, and Islamic teachers and civil servants seemed to have been singled out for execution. In the aftermath a few party leaders fled, but most were captured and executed. Some thirty-five thousand of their armed followers were held under arrest for a time. Retribution also was exacted by the Muslim community in a wave of violent attacks on party followers in the Madiun area. 10\n\nAt the time of the attempted coup in 1965 conflict had been raging between the two groups for almost two years. The violence was touched off by a Communist party campaign in support of land reform, which inspired violent incidents across the whole of rural Central and East Java. What began with knifings and kidnappings escalated to group battles, with as many as two thousand on each side using clubs, knives, and machetes. According to one authority, it was the largest outbreak of violence in the recorded history of rural Java up to this time. 11\n\nThe Land Situation\n\nThe land situation in Java was indeed critical. Some 54 percent of rural households on Java owned less than half a hectare (or less than 1.1 acres); another 13 percent were landless. Although in certain localities a small rural elite held sizable portions of land, a large landlord class simply did not exist in Java. Rather, Java’s population growth had led to the progressive fragmentation of all landholdings. In addition, the increasing demand for land led to a constant increase in the value of land. Both these processes were driving an increasing number of poor farmers into daily wage labor, and obliging tenants and sharecroppers to accept less and less equitable terms in order to remain in farming.\n\nThe national government paid little attention to this problem until radical unionists in the late 1950s forcibly took over foreign-owned plantations. Up to this time land ownership had been regulated by an agrarian law promulgated by the Dutch colonial authorities in 1870. But a legal basis had to be provided for the expropriations in order to assure the security of plantation exports. So long as the plantations were legally the property of foreign owners, their products faced seizure by court order in foreign ports.\n\nNevertheless, the national political consensus was that a limit should be placed on the amount of land any one family could hold, and the surplus should be distributed to the landless. When Parliament passed the new land law in September 1960, it limited the amount of land any family might own or control through mortgages or leases. In the case of irrigated rice land in densely populated areas the limit was 8 hectares, or approximately 17.6 acres. The excess was to be registered with government officials who would then distribute it to landless peasants; owners were to be compensated over a period of years. The Department of Agrarian Affairs initially estimated that 1 million hectares would be available for distribution. By 1963, however, this had been scaled down to about one-third that amount. By the end of 1963 the government was reporting that only one-tenth of the latter figure, or some 35,000 hectares, had so far been distributed. Communist critics claimed the true figure was less than 20,000 hectares.\n\nWolf Ladejinsky, writing in early 1964 and using official data, concluded that not more than 6 percent of the four to five million sharecroppers on Java could possibly ever receive any land under the law. Few landlords with any sizable holdings were on this island, where two-thirds of Indonesia’s population lived, and some districts had no land to redistribute at all. A more important question, in Ladejinsky’s view, was the terms of tenancy. The law required that all agreements between landowners and tenants were to be in writing and registered with local authorities, but by 1964 this was honored chiefly in the breach; of several million probable agreements in all of Java and Bali, only twenty thousand had been recorded. 12 The law also required that landlord and tenant should each receive 50 percent of the crop, but the law failed to specify the sharing of expenses, such as the cost of fertilizers. Moreover, landlords frequently loaned money to their tenants for various purposes. Rural economic relations were far more complicated than the new agrarian law had taken into account. Ladejinsky concluded, in a private report to the government, that although the new law was on the books, “All else appears to be as of old.” 13\n\nThe Communists’ Rural Strategy\n\nAbout the time the new land law was enacted, the Communist party was beginning to work vigorously to build a rural base, particularly in Java. The party had obtained only 16.4 percent of the total vote in the national parliamentary elections of 1955. But 88.6 percent of its vote was in Java, and much of this support was believed to be concentrated among abangan peasants in Central and East Java. Abangan are largely peasants and lower-class townsmen in Java whose religious tradition consists of animistic, Hinduistic, and Islamic elements, with emphasis on the former two. 14 In the local elections of 1957 the Communist party supplanted the National Party as the leading party in Central Java. This was attributed, in part, to the party’s appearance as an energetic and effective champion of abangan values against the interests of the santri community. Santri are largely traders and richer peasants in Java whose religious tradition consists of “a careful and regular execution of the basic rituals of Islam.” 15\n\nParty leaders might well have seen a need for a new and stronger rural base. The mass base the party had developed by the late 1950s was largely made up of organized workers of firms and plantations formerly owned by the Dutch and other foreigners. In many cases, these workers had taken control of the enterprises that employed them in 1957, but they became increasingly vulnerable following the introduction of martial law later the same year. Army officers were put in charge of the enterprises, and some did not shrink from using force to establish their authority. Party leaders may also have been responding to critics within the party who were unhappy about the leadership’s accommodation to some of the authoritarian features of Sukarno’s Guided Democracy. In any event, party leaders decided to enlarge and tighten up their organization among the general rural population. In 1958 preparations were begun for a first National Peasants Conference to launch a concerted drive to organize the rural population.\n\nThe main feature of this drive was a “go down” movement, a campaign to encourage party cadres in cities and towns to go to the villages, become familiar with conditions there, and educate the peasants about the policies and programs of the party. The “go down” movement was needed because party cadres were mostly townsmen unaccustomed to the physical conditions of rural life, and reluctant to spend long periods in the villages. They also faced obstacles there from village authorities, the well-to-do, and traditionalist advocates of village harmony. In some villages, divided among hostile factions, party support tended to come from unemployed youth and other radicalized elements, but these were mostly illiterate, accustomed to showing deference to people of higher status, and unversed in the ways of modern organization. So it was decided to introduce organizers from outside the villages, and to put the authority and prestige of the party’s leadership behind the effort.\n\nThe National Peasants Conference of April 1959 resolved that the most important aspect of party work in the villages was to bridge the gap between urban party cadres and villagers through the “three togethers”–living together, eating together, and working together. The official position was that this would be a gradual process, both to educate the cadres and to win the peasants’ confidence. Nevertheless, the party chairman, D. N. Aidit, on the occasion of the Conference, authorized an attack on landlord interests and, on the party’s behalf, demanded that the traditional division of crops be changed from 60:40 in favor of landowners to the same ratio in favor of their tenants. 16\n\nThe Communists’ Rural Offensive\n\nThere the matter rested until December 1963. At that time, having given scant attention to the subject for several years, Aidit called on the party to undertake a “rural offensive” in support of land reform. The peasants, he said, had to take “unilateral action”–to “take the law into their own hands.” 17 This marked a radical break with the past: the long-term party strategy of maintaining a united front with other parties was put aside; for the first time the theme of a struggle between the haves and have-nots was introduced into the villages in a direct and organized way; and, finally, the established social and political allegiances and traditional values of social harmony and deference were challenged. 18\n\nThe timing of this initiative was well chosen; it so happened that in the last months of 1963 and the first months of 1964 parts of Java and Bali were experiencing the worst drought in living memory. Without any rain the irrigation channels stood dry, and rats infested the villages in search of food. Village stores of rice were ravaged; even trees around people’s homes were shorn of their leaves. Reuters reported in February 1964 that a million people were starving in Central Java. Antara, the official Indonesian news agency, reported that thousands were starving in Bali. D. N. Aidit himself was quoted as saying, “People are now eating virtually anything edible.” 19\n\nSerious conflicts were soon occurring in Central and East Java as a result of unilateral peasant action. By April 1964 the press was reporting serious outbreaks of violence over peasant actions throughout Central Java. By June the incidents had spread to East Java and were being reported daily in the Surabaya newspapers. The clashes were marked from the outset by knifings and kidnappings, and soon large-scale confrontations were taking place. Factions took to burning down the houses of hostile elements and destroying their crops in the field. Groups of between three hundred and four hundred, and even as many as two thousand, were reportedly involved in some incidents. In a number of places, police intervention led to serious loss of life.\n\nThese developments created considerable alarm among leaders of the National and Nahdatul Ulama parties. The Islamic party leaders were particularly incensed, because the Communist party appeared to be engaged in a broad offensive against Islamic interests. Many of the holders of sizable plots, especially in East Java, were santri family heads. Often the owners of extensive tracts of land were Islamic religious institutions. The Communist party had only recently tried to have Sukarno declare the leading Muslim student organization illegal. Islamic leaders, feeling increasingly threatened by the direction Guided Democracy was taking, viewed the attack on Muslim land rights as the last straw.\n\nThe uproar was muted in the controlled Jakarta press, and Sukarno sought at first to put the weight of his authority behind the land reform program. In July 1964 a special session of the Supreme Advisory Council resolved that implementation of the program should be speeded up. In August, in his annual Independence Day address, Sukarno criticized the slow pace of the program. But by early December Aidit was acknowledging that the party’s opponents were getting the better of his cadres. Then Chaerul Saleh of the Murba Party claimed he had documents showing that the Communist party planned a coup. On December 12, in an atmosphere of great tension, Sukarno called a meeting of the heads of the ten then-legal political parties. After thirteen hours the meeting ended in a unanimous call for a truce in interparty conflict. But the violence continued well into 1965.\n\nIn May 1965, at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist party, Aidit blamed the situation on party cadres who had acted impetuously and without regard to party guidelines. But it is difficult to avoid the opinion that he and the other party leaders had misjudged the situation. In breaking the line on their own long-term “national front” strategy, the party leaders had succeeded chiefly in isolating themselves from the other national groups in the Sukarno coalition. By attempting to instigate confrontation along class lines, the party leaders also had revealed the weakness of class-consciousness, as well as the enduring strength of traditional attachments to party and religion among the rural population.\n\nIn August and September 1965 reports in the local press of Central and East Java indicated a resurgence of conflicts in these provinces, particularly of incidents in which youth groups–attached to the Communist party, on the one hand, and the Nationalist Party and Nahdatul Ulama, on the other–engaged in violent attacks on each other.\n\nLonger-Term Contributions to the Violence\n\nSartono Kartodirdjo, who has documented the history of unrest in Indonesia’s rural society over several centuries, has argued that the events of 1965-66 were part of a long-established pattern of political competition that was at least as intense in the countryside as in the towns. Radical social movements arose with some regularity among the lower social strata, the oppressed, and the underprivileged. These movements did not, however, arise only from conditions of economic deprivation and oppression. A strong element of millenarianism also emerged in the late colonial period. “The severe threat to the Javanese sense of identity posed by an increasingly heavy foreign political and cultural hegemony produced a powerful reaction in peasant society, expressed in an intense longing for a restoration of an idealized traditional order.” 20 If the Communist party thus drew on utopian hopes that were important in Javanese culture from very early times, the reaction to the party’s intrusion from early 1964 on also had a basis in a powerful tradition.\n\nOf the intensity of relations between party politics and religion in rural Java, Clifford Geertz, writing in the late 1950s, had this to say:\n\nBecause the same symbols are used in both political and religious contexts, people often regard party struggle as involving not merely the usual ebb and flow of parliamentary maneuver, the necessary factional give-and-take of democratic government, but involving as well decisions on basic values and ultimates. Kampong (village) people in particular tend to see the open struggle for power explicitly institutionalized in the new republican forms of government as a struggle for the right to establish different brands of essentially religious principles as official: “If the abangans get in, the koranic teachers will be forbidden to hold classes”; “If the santris get in, we shall all have to pray five times a day.” The normal conflict involved in electoral striving for office is heightened by the idea that literally everything is at stake: the “If we win, it is our country” idea that the group which gains power has a right, as one man said, “to put his own foundation under the state.” Politics thus takes on a kind of sacralized bitterness. 21\n\nThe bloodshed in the countryside was further influenced by popular ideas of political history, learned by every Javanese peasant from the stories of the wayang . Benedict Anderson has argued that power has generally been regarded in traditional Javanese thought as highly concentrated–in the capital city, in the palace, and in the person of the ruler, “who personifies the unity of society.” 22 Sukarno had demonstrated this concern for unity time and again in his attempts to create by rhetorical invention–of which Nasakom , the union of nationalism, religion, and communism, was an example–symbols of a unity that did not exist in the society. The same concern was seen in the dogged refusal of the largely Javanese elite to recognize the claims of the “outer islands” for a larger measure of autonomy in the 1950s. In this tradition, in which a diffusion of power is seen as weakness, Anderson argued that as “Power begins to ebb away from the center, the reigning dynasty loses its claim to rule, and disorder appears.” 23 And “a ruler who has once permitted natural and social disorders to appear finds it particularly difficult to reconstitute his authority. Javanese would tend to believe that, if he still had the Power, the disorders would never have arisen.” 24\n\nThose Javanese who were taking their cues from what was occurring in the capital city in October 1965 were presented with ample evidence that anticommunism was in the ascendancy. The same government radio station that had carried the leaders’ announcements of the attempted coup, and thus encouraged the uprisings that followed for a short time in Central Java, was now reporting widening popular demonstrations, and army arrests, directed against the Communist party and its subsidiary organizations. Many of those involved in the demonstrations and arrests in Jakarta were thoroughly convinced that the Communist party had been behind the coup, and they were using the situation to wreak vengeance on the party and its people. They did so not only because of the deaths of the generals and the attempt to take control of the government, but also in return for all the intimidations they had suffered themselves at the hands of party activists in the past. Thus, reactions to the coup on the part of the capital’s elite provided a further sanction to the rural anticommunist pogrom.\n\nOne is left, then, with a partial answer to the principal question with which this discussion began. The deep divisions within Indonesian society, divisions of religion, economic interest, social class, and political party, appear to have been at the root of the violence. These divisions were exacerbated by the procommunist revolt of 1948, by the national and local elections of 1955 and 1957, and, most recently and deeply, by the campaign of the Communist party to change the traditional rules that governed the use of land. The failure of the attempted coup provided an impetus to anticommunists in the countryside to wreak vengeance on those who had been attacking and intimidating them for almost two years. Moreover, traditional political thinking that placed a high value on the direction of events in the capital city could only have provided further encouragement to anticommunists in the provinces. Finally, the army’s own actions contributed directly to the scale of the violence, and sanctioned the violence of others.\n\nSome Remaining Issues\n\nThe number of dead was never determined. Official and unofficial estimates ran from 78,500 to 500,000. Whatever the number, one has to assume that many others died as an indirect result of the violence and the breakdown of family and community relations. Prominent among these would have been such vulnerable groups as infants, children, and the elderly, especially those from the poorest families who must have been on the edge of survival in the drought years of 1963 and 1964. Routine registrations of births and deaths, which had been unreliable even in normal times, were useless for this period. Data from the census of 1961 were not sufficiently analyzed to provide a basis for later comparison. And when preparations for the 1971 census were being made, it was found that all the 1961 data had been thrown away. So reliable estimates of mortality for the districts in which the violence occurred could never be made.\n\nAmong other issues, the role of the Communist party in the attempted coup has been a matter of considerable controversy. The coup itself did not involve any known members of the party directly. That the party was involved in planning the coup–as much as that seemed"
