        "text": "Citation preview\n\nA HISTO RY OF MO DERN IND O NES IA , SECOND EDITION\n\nSince the Bali bombings of 2002 and the rise of political Islam, Indonesia has frequently occupied media headlines. Nevertheless, the history of the fourth-largest country on earth remains relatively unknown. Adrian Vickers’s book, first published in 2005, traces the history of an island country, comprising some 240 million people, from the colonial period through revolution and independence to the present. Framed around the life story of Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia’s most famous and controversial novelist and playwright, the book journeys through the social and cultural mores of Indonesian society, focusing on the experiences of ordinary people. In this new edition, the author brings the story up to date, revisiting his argument as to why Indonesia has yet to realize its potential as a democratic country. He also examines the rise of fundamentalist Islam, which has haunted Indonesia since the fall of Suharto. a d r i a n v i c k e r s is Professor of Southeast Asian Studies in the School of Languages and Cultures at the University of Sydney. He is the author of the acclaimed Bali: A Paradise Created (1989). In 2003 he curated the exhibition Crossing Boundaries, a major survey of modern Indonesian art, and he has also been involved in making documentary films, including Done Bali (1993).\n\nA HISTORY OF MODERN INDONESIA Second Edition\n\nADRIAN VICKERS The University of Sydney\n\ncambridge university press Cambridge, New York, Melbourne, Madrid, Cape Town, Singapore, S˜ao Paulo, Delhi, Mexico City Cambridge University Press 32 Avenue of the Americas, New York, ny 10013-2473, usa www.cambridge.org Information on this title: www.cambridge.org/9781107624450 c Adrian Vickers 2005, 2013 This publication is in copyright.

At times I have not listened as attentively as I might, and for that I ask forgiveness, sampunayang titiang yening wenten kirang langkung. Endnotes cannot do justice to my debt to all the people who have influenced me. Those who played the strongest role in shaping my understanding of Indonesia were my mentors and colleagues at the University of Sydney, in particular Peter Worsley and the late Boy Joseph, along with Jenny Alexander, Paul Alexander, Richard Chauvel, Linda Connor, Tony Day, Keith Foulcher, Rudy de Ionge, Helen Jarvis, Michael van Langenberg, Thea van Lennep, Jennifer Lindsay, Doug Miles, George Quinn, David Reeve, Kathy Robinson, Raechelle Rubinstein and Jon Soemarjono. Thanks particularly to Max Lane for his insights into Pramoedya’s thinking. In Bali the late A. A. Kompiang Gede and his family and the late Gusti Ngurah Bagus gave me a different view of Indonesian modernity, as did my friends in Kamasan and Batuan villages. In more recent years Sutjaja and Ari, Nyoman Darma Putra, the late Dr Djelantik, Putu Suasta, Ngurah Kariadi, Agus Waworunto, Jango Pramartha and Gus Surya helped me in many ways, as did particularly the Latitudes gang, Degung Santikarma, Lesley Dwyer, Gung Alit and Hani. In Jakarta the Appono family, Tatap Loebis, Chusnul Mariyah, Reni and Alex Winata; in Yogya Rumekso Setyadi and others at Syarikat; Irwan Abdullah, Abdul Haris, Bambang Purwanto, Syafri Sairin, and many others at Universitas Gadjah Mada showed me different sides of Indonesia; and I still remember fondly the hospitality of the late Umar Kayam.

Robert Cribb, Jan Elliott, Keith Foulcher, Bill Frederick, Indriati Kurniana, Elsbeth Locher-Scholten, Anton Lucas, Ari Poespodiharjo and Nyoman Wijaya all commented on chapters but bear no responsibility for my views or errors. Safrina Thristiawati provided me with crucial materials from the 1950s and 1960s and useful comments and advice. My thanks to the many reviewers of the first edition of this book, who helped me to moderate my tendency to hyperbole. Leo Haks kindly provided many of the illustrations. Photographs from the Leo Haks collection of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Asian photography, acquired in 2007, are reproduced with permission from the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra. Robert Cribb provided valuable advice on the maps for the second edition, and his Digital Atlas of Indonesian History (Copenhagen: NIAS Press, 2010) was a major source for their revisions. The home editorial team, Hazel, Emma and particularly Fran Moloney, have helped this book make sense. My parents first encouraged my interest in Indonesia in the early 1970s when they supported my first trips to Indonesia. Sadly, my mother did not live to see this book’s completion.\n\nA note on spelling, pronunciation and names\n\nIndonesian has gone through several spelling systems, and there is great inconsistency in the public use of these systems. For the sake of simplicity I have generally used the spelling system introduced in 1972, although Pramoedya preferred the Dutch-era ‘oe’ instead of ‘u’ in the spelling of his name; likewise Dr Djelantik preferred the pre-1972 ‘dj’ instead of ‘j’. Syllables in Indonesian words are generally pronounced with even weight; ‘a’ is pronounced like the English ‘u’ in ‘up’; ‘e’ is usually pronounced as in the English word ‘step’ or like ‘a’ in ‘day’; ‘i’ is pronounced as in ‘hid’; ‘u’ is pronounced like ‘o’ in ‘do’; ‘c’ is pronounced like the English ‘ch’; ‘sy’ is pronounced ‘sh’. Javanese is transcribed variably in the sources used; the ‘a’ is like the Danish ‘a’, and so is usually rendered as ‘o’, but inconsistently (e.g., ‘Ronggowarsito’). Although many Indonesians have adopted the use of family names or surnames, there is a great deal of variation in personal names in Indonesia. Some people have only one name, such as Suharto and Sukarno. Many names also incorporate titles, such as the Sumatran aristocratic title ‘Sutan’ in Sutan Syahrir’s name. It is quite common to change names at different stages in life, as when Suwardi Suryaningrat changed his name to Ki Hajar Dewantoro at the age of forty. Many people are known by abbreviated names for simplicity, as in the case of Abdurrahman Wahid, known as ‘Gus Dur’, which combines a Javanese familiar title, ‘Gus’ (short for Gusti but sometimes Agus or Bagus), and an abbreviation of his main name.\n\nxiii\n\nChronology\n\n1870 1873 1888 1890 1894 1898 1901 1903 1904 1907 1908 1911 1912 1914 1917 1918 1920 1925\n\nBeginning of a ‘Liberal Policy’ of deregulated exploitation of the Netherlands East Indies Beginning of the Aceh War Founding of the packet steamship line KPM World depression Lombok War General van Heutsz becomes chief-of-staff of the Aceh campaign Wilhelmina becomes queen of the Netherlands Ethical Policy proclaimed Aceh declared conquered Van Heutsz made governor general Raden Mas Tirto Adhi Suryo founds Civil Servants’ Association, Sarekat Priyayi Budi Utomo proclaimed first official nationalist movement Last Balinese rulers to resist Dutch rule wiped out in a battle to the death Founding by Tirto Adhi Suryo of the Islamic Traders’ League Islamic League (Sarekat Islam) becomes first mass-based nationalist party World War One; the Netherlands is a neutral country in the war East Indies trade with Europe cut off by the war Russian Revolution Death of Tirto Adhi Suryo Founding of the Communist Party of the Indies (PKI) Economic downturn Birth of Pramoedya Ananta Toer Sharp rise in world commodity prices brings prosperity to the Indies xv\n\nxvi 1929 1930 1940 1941 1942 1945\n\n1946\n\n1947 1948\n\n1949\n\n1950\n\n1955 1956 1957 1962–3\n\nChronology Great Depression Sukarno’s famous nationalist speech, ‘Indonesia Accuses’, given as defence in his political trial Germany invades the Netherlands 8 December (7 December in Hawaii), US naval base at Pearl Harbor bombed by Japanese Japan invades the Netherlands East Indies 15 August, Japan surrenders 17 August, Sukarno and Hatta proclaim Indonesia’s independence, signalling the beginning of the Indonesian Revolution 10 November, Battle of Surabaya Social revolutions, including Three Regions (Tiga Daerah) Revolt Republican capital established in Yogyakarta Federal states set up by Dutch in Outer Islands 25 March, Linggajati agreement, first ceasefire 20 July, First Police Action Abdication of Queen Wilhelmina 19 January, Renville Agreement, Van Mook line established between Republican and Dutch territories August, fall of Amir Syarifuddin government 18 September, Madiun Affair December, Second Police Action, fall of Yogyakarta to the Dutch, execution of Amir Syarifuddin by Republicans February, execution of Tan Malaka by Republican army 1 August, official ceasefire December, Dutch forced to take part in Round Table Agreement 27 December, Indonesia achieves full sovereignty Federal states dissolve and Indonesia becomes a unitary republic Korean War brings high prices for rubber and other Indonesian commodities First national elections PRRI–Permesta regional revolts State of war and siege declared, beginning of Guided Democracy Dutch enterprises nationalised Irian Jaya (West New Guinea) campaign\n\nChronology 1963–5 1965 1966 1969 1970 1971 1974 1975 1977 1982 1983 1984 1987 1989 1992 1994 1996 1997 1998 1999\n\n2001\n\nxvii\n\nConfrontation with Malaysia 30th September Movement ‘coup’ (Gestapu) leads to the death of 500,000 to 1 million people identified as Communists Sukarno hands over power to Suharto through the 11 March Letter of Command (Supersemar), beginning of the New Order regime ‘Act of Free Choice’ legitimises Indonesia’s control over Irian Jaya Death of Sukarno First New Order election 15 January upheavals (Malari) end the New Order’s ‘honeymoon’ period Pertamina Affair Invasion of East Timor National election ‘Normalisation’ of university campuses programme National election Mysterious Killings (Petrus) Tanjung Priok Affair involving killings of Muslims in Jakarta Clampdown on Islamic political leaders National election ‘Openness’ campaign announced Establishment of Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals’ Association (ICMI) National election Press bans end ‘Openness’ Death of Tien Suharto Attack on Megawati’s faction of the PDI Bre-X scandal (or Busang gold mine scandal) Asian financial crisis and drought National election 21 May, fall of Suharto, replaced by B.

It consists of 19,000 islands strung across the equator, some of these no more than sand spits, others, like Java and Sumatra, large and densely populated. Two of the world’s largest islands, Borneo and New Guinea, are partly within Indonesia: Kalimantan is the Indonesian name for its part of Borneo, while Indonesia’s half of New Guinea is now called Papua – formerly Irian Jaya. As a country joined by water, Indonesia covers an area as wide as Europe or the United States. There are more than 200 major cultural and language groups on the islands. Java is the most populous island, with over 130 million people packed together on its 132,000 square kilometres. Jakarta, the national capital with a population of 15 million, is located on the island of Java. Javanese culture dominates the other cultures of Indonesia, but the main language of the nation is a form of Malay called Bahasa Indonesia or Indonesian. Indonesia is generally featured in the world’s media for its political violence and involvement in international terrorism. It has been rated at the top of international corruption watch lists, and its president between 1967 and 1998, Suharto, was named the head of state who extorted the most personal wealth from his country. Such negative images do not do justice to the country. Indonesia is the world’s third-largest democracy. It may have the largest Islamic population in the world, with 90 per cent of the population identifying itself as Muslim, but estimates of the number of those who are members of violent groups indicate that no more than several hundred would be willing to engage in terrorist violence. Indonesia is not an Islamic state, but rather has a long history of religious tolerance. Before many parts converted to Islam in the fifteenth century, Hinduism and Buddhism were the majority religions, and there are still significant minorities who adhere to these faiths. Chinese temples can be found throughout the archipelago, as can Protestant and 1\n\n2\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nCatholic churches, and even synagogues. There are still many Indonesians who practise ancient forms of ancestor worship or animism, and these earlier spiritual beliefs pervade the observances of the larger religions. The many religions of Indonesia are part of the cultural richness of this diverse country. Indonesia’s famous shadow puppet theatre, the wayang, is an ancient art that combines Indian epic tales with indigenous mythology. Indonesia also developed some of the richest textile traditions in the world, the best known of which is batik, the art of wax-resist dyeing. Each part of Indonesia has its own wealth of music and theatre, visual arts, poetry and literature. This diversity and depth of Indonesian culture is a product of openness to new ideas and practices that have come to the islands via millennia of trade with India, China and the rest of the world, the same kind of openness that has embraced shopping malls, mobile phones and DVDs. In political terms, Indonesia has turned, slowly and hesitatingly, towards democracy, as shown by the mass demonstrations that brought Suharto down. After more than thirty years of military-dominated dictatorship, Indonesians have entered the twenty-first century with a desire to clean up government and make it representative of the people. Indonesia has had far fewer political assassinations than the United States or India – no president has ever been killed. It is safer to walk the streets of major Indonesian cities at night than to walk through some of the inner parts of Sydney or Los Angeles. Indonesia’s historical experience explains its diversity, and why it is a country of paradoxes. Although in earlier times there were kingdoms that embraced large parts of the Indonesian archipelago, Indonesia did not come into existence as a country until the middle of the twentieth century. The physical boundaries of Indonesia were established by the Netherlands when the Dutch took over the many islands and made them a single colony: the Netherlands East Indies. Some parts of Indonesia were ruled by the Dutch for 300 years, others for less than 30. Dutch rule explains many aspects of Indonesia, because it provided administrative and economic foundations for the modern state. Legal systems, labour relations, urban development and many other aspects of present-day Indonesia were stamped by the Dutch. Under the Dutch, Indonesians began to conceive of themselves as a nation. After the Japanese invaded Indonesia in 1942, that nascent nationalism evolved under the leadership of a small group of Indonesians into a struggle for independence: the Indonesian Revolution of 1945–9, led by Sukarno, Indonesia’s first president. When sovereignty was transferred from\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nDutch to Indonesian hands at the end of the Revolution, Indonesia became one of the new nations of the era of decolonisation. As a new nation it has struggled to balance the interests of different groups and maintain coherence against both the pressures of its own diversity and tensions created by international politics. The present state of Indonesia is as much a product of struggle and the use of force for political ends as it is the realisation of national identity. Telling the history of modern Indonesia is difficult because a country as huge and heterogeneous as this does not have a single narrative. Most historical accounts have been concerned with the activities of a small group of political leaders, those who created the nationalist movement under the Dutch, led the country to independence and have fought amongst themselves to control it ever since. There have been official histories, which play up nationalism and unity in ways that paper over the cracks in the national edifice. These are usually histories of state heroes and big events, and do not say much about the experiences of ordinary Indonesians. One of the few Indonesians with a coherent and developed vision of the nation’s history was the country’s most famous novelist, Pramoedya Ananta Toer. Of the 240 million individual stories that could be told about Indonesia, Pramoedya’s links the world of politics with everyday life. Pramoedya was born in a small town in Java during the colonial era. His father and mother gave him a strong sense of nationalism and its importance, and in his writings he wrestled with the problems of Indonesia’s national identity. Amongst those writings is a series of four novels about the formation of nationalism, This Earth of Mankind, and a series of semiautobiographical stories about growing up on Java and experiencing Dutch rule, the Japanese invasion and the Indonesian Revolution. The novels that make up This Earth of Mankind provide insights into how Dutch colonial society was riven by contradictions, especially between the desire to control Indonesians and the desire to bring them progress. In these books Pramoedya gives voice to the feeling that developed amongst Indonesians of becoming modern people, desiring emancipation and ultimately an independent nation. What Pramoedya’s writings show is that ideas of progress, the modern and the nation are contested by different social groups, mirroring the physical struggles of Indonesian history. This Earth of Mankind begins with the volume of the same name and portrays a naive young man, Minke. This character is based on the historical figure of Tirto Adhi Suryo, one of Indonesia’s first nationalists. In this novel Minke struggles to rebel against his aristocratic Javanese traditions\n\n4\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nand come to terms with the wonders of technology and enlightenment promised by the West. An important aspect of modernity brought out in Pramoedya’s writings is that tradition becomes a self-conscious process of identifying the older facets of identity and emphasising them. Pramoedya, like other nationalists of his generation, rejects what they call ‘feudalism’ in tradition, the emphasis on hierarchy that links birth to power. Pramoedya’s novel presents Minke’s growing awareness of living in a colonial culture of subjugation. Over this and the next two volumes, readers see through Minke’s eyes the processes by which the Dutch took over the islands of Indonesia and exploited them economically, and the developments through which Filipinos, Chinese and other Asians came to form their own sense of national identity. The important elements these novels identify are the growing gulf among different ethnic and class groups in Indonesian society and the ways this gulf is emphasised by the colonial state, as well as the awareness of a need for emancipation that grows out of the frustrations of colonialism, emancipation that includes the struggle of women for recognition. Pramoedya gives a detailed impression of urban life and its relations to colonial modernity, and in the last novel shows how Indonesians became their own torturers under the colonial system, as illustrated by the figure of an Indonesian spy for the Dutch who is responsible for the death of Minke. I examine these facets of the experience of colonial rule in the first three chapters of the present volume by focusing on Pramoedya’s identification with Tirto’s life. Pramoedya wrote his novels to convey how those of his parents’ generation grew to become nationalists. His father, a nationalist teacher, was born in the same year as the fictional Minke, and through Minke, Pramoedya examines his father’s frustrations as a nationalist left powerless by the efficiency of the Dutch suppression of indigenous politicians, a powerlessness that led him to gambling as an outlet for his stymied political desires. Pramoedya moved to the city and worked as a journalist during the Japanese period. He was gaoled by the Dutch for supporting Indonesia’s struggle for independence, then gaoled during the regime of President Sukarno for his outspoken support of Indonesia’s Chinese minority. He described life in Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, in a way that no other author has, by taking his readers into the backstreets and slums. As someone active in left-wing cultural politics, he was caught up in Indonesia’s major upheaval, the purge of Communists that began in 1965 and led to the killing of at least 500,000 people. It was this purge that brought Sukarno’s successor, Suharto, to power. Pramoedya was one of hundreds of thousands gaoled by Suharto’s military-led government in the aftermath of the purge,\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nand he spent fourteen years in prison, most of those in harsh conditions on the remote prison-island of Buru, in Eastern Indonesia. There, when eventually given paper by his gaolers, he wrote This Earth of Mankind. Returning to Jakarta in 1979, he spent almost twenty more years under house arrest, his books banned. When Suharto fell, Pramoedya was free to become a public commentator and to publish again. Other key prison writings by Pramoedya offer detailed insights into his personal experiences and the ways he incorporated them into his writings. His prison letters and articles, published as A Mute’s Soliloquy, give a moving impression of what it was like to live through the colonial period, the Japanese occupation of Indonesia and the Revolution. He tells how he used his personal experiences as the basis of his early fiction – accounts of life in the countryside and the city which convey the sense of a struggle for survival in the face of unbearable suffering. Pramoedya’s many novellas and short stories on the Revolution serve as more detailed guides to his formative experience of this struggle, and Chapters 4 and 5 of this book draw on them to connect the personal to the larger scheme of political and economic changes of these periods. Pramoedya’s writings echo his bitter life experiences, showing what so many millions of Indonesians went through as Indonesia turned from a parliamentary democracy to a semi-dictatorship under Sukarno and then to an authoritarian regime Suharto called his New Order. They evidence the cynicism that many Indonesians still feel about the promises of political leaders, beginning with the disillusionment that followed the Revolution of 1945–9 when it did not usher in the bright new world of prosperity that many people had hoped for. In his writings from the 1940s and 1950s Pramoedya conveyed the experience of daily life for people who live in grinding poverty at the whims of politicians. Fictional and non-fictional accounts merge in the clear realism of his prose. Chapters 5 and 6 trace this process up to the beginning of Pramoedya’s long imprisonment. The experiences of imprisonment form a counterpoint to the prosperity that Suharto brought about in the nation, changes discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. Pramoedya’s life and writings are a guide to understanding modern Indonesian history, an epic and highly serious vision of the story of Indonesia as a nationalist tragedy that began at the turn of the twentieth century and was betrayed by Suharto’s New Order. Any history writing involves leaving out most of ‘what happened’, and by selecting a series of themes about culture and society, Pramoedya’s writings provide an alternative historical agenda, one concerned with power and everyday experience. They\n\n6\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nare also writings that are jaundiced, partial and partisan, elevating nationalism to the centre of Indonesian life, arguing that nationalism should be rooted in the people and that it should be a modern nationalism, to which most aspects of traditional culture are irrelevant. In this they differ from the works of some of his contemporaries, for example the novelists Umar Kayam (1932–2002) and Father W. S. Mangunwijaya (1929–99). Kayam was an author, actor, film-maker and academic who explored tradition as the basis of modern Indonesian culture, and in particular used the so-called feudal traditions of Central Java to find elements of value for Indonesians as a new people. One of the great contradictions of Indonesia is its dependence on ancient characteristics – temples such as Borobudur or royal traditions – to define a distinctive modern national personality. Mangunwijaya, a Javanese Catholic priest, engineer and writer, combined the wayang shadow play with a James Joyce style of modernism to criticise the moral corruption and materialism of his country. Mangunwijaya wrote his novel Durga Umayi as a reply to This Earth of Mankind, depicting the country as the product of the tail end of colonial rule and of a struggle so full of contradiction that it is almost farcical. Mangunwijaya took on the ancient Javanese characterisation of the world as part of a mad age, where survival depends on coming to terms with contradiction. All three authors tend to play down the importance of Islam to Indonesia, despite Indonesia’s having the largest Muslim population of any country in the world. They viewed Islam as a religion of daily life, interwoven with the fabric of norms and social mores but resisted as a religion of state and nation at various levels, from the ecumenical formulations of the Constitution and national values to the practices of older forms of ancestor and spirit worship. This view made sense until the 1990s, when a surge of renewal increased the importance of displays of piety in daily life, resulting in what many Indonesians consider to be a Middle Eastern style of Islam. But a history of Muslim Indonesia would be a very different book from this one. All three authors give a Java-centred view of Indonesia, whereas the other half of the population has its own set of somewhat centrifugal perceptions of the nation. Java, however, as well as being the seat of government, has been the centre of social and political developments since the early twentieth century, as Chapter 3 shows. Writing a national history of Indonesia is difficult, because it is a nation still coming into being. The state of Indonesia was created first by the almost accidental set of colonial boundaries of the early twentieth century,\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nor at least this is the argument put forward by Pramoedya, since others claim that the state goes back to at least the thirteenth-century kingdom of Majapahit. The colonial state, based as it was in the Netherlands, did its best to deny Indonesians any sense of citizenship, let alone participation. This alienation has continued into the post-colonial period. The nation itself does not have a cohesive society, people still refer to their ethnicity as a primary point of self-description and successive leaders have done little to further the sense of a civic set of norms and institutions. Still, Pramoedya’s descriptions of life in the slums of Jakarta or in the prison camps on Buru are written in hope, a faith in humanity’s struggle for a better life and a sense of what Indonesia might mean. In his fiction he tries to move outside himself to illuminate the lives of ordinary people under tragic circumstances. While his writings were still banned, Indonesians and foreigners alike savoured them as forbidden fruit, as they were part of the continuing dissent against the Suharto regime, dissent that ultimately contributed to the disintegration of that rule. His works have also had an immense influence on the writing of foreign histories of Indonesia because they have provided an Indonesian perception of historical experience that is an alternative to the official view. Authors such as Benedict R. O’G. Anderson, whose cultural history has influenced the writing of this book, have shown how creative dialogue with Pramoedya and other Indonesian authors can help us to understand the myriad perceptions of Indonesian history. During the Suharto era the discipline of history was heavily repressed and starved of its basic resources – access to archives and critical debate. In the post-Suharto era there has been a flood of books and articles in Indonesia that challenge earlier accepted histories, although many of these have been little more than attempts to counter New Order propaganda. The republication of Pramoedya’s works has been one wave of this flood, contributing to a new kind of public debate which promises to revivify public history. The fall of Suharto had the paradoxical effect of allowing Pramoedya to return to being a major public intellectual, as he was in the 1950s and early 1960s, but at the same time creating new political agendas for Islam and ethnic struggle that were outside Pramoedya’s vision of Indonesia. The waters have still to settle. Indonesia is a place of tragedy and farce, of tradition and modernity. Umar Kayam’s emphasis on traditional roots for a new nation answered the need for depth in a country uneasy with the modern. He and Mangunwijaya were both much more in touch than Pramoedya with the spiritual and religious interpretations that most Indonesians employ to make sense of\n\n8\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nMap 1 The Netherlands East Indies, showing major islands and cities.\n\ntheir lives. The tragedy of Indonesian history is its continued pattern of exploitation, lives lost and opportunities squandered. The farce is the surreal nature of a disjointed nation, but mixed with this is an enduring optimism that has enabled Indonesians to salvage a sense of shared purpose from their existence in a state created under foreign rule.\n\nchapter 1\n\nOur colonial soil\n\nHaving spent myself the greatest and the best part of my life in the Dutch colonial service and having pawned my heart to the welfare of the Dutch East Indies and the people over there . . . Former Governor General Jonkheer Mr A. C. D. de Graeff 1\n\nBefore 1945 there was no Indonesia, but rather a collection of islands spread across the equator that the Dutch made into the Netherlands East Indies. In 1898 a new queen, Wilhelmina, ascended the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Wilhelmina’s tropical empire, known simply as the Indies, numbered more than 28 million subjects on the prime island of Java and some 7 million others on what were referred to as the Outer Islands, although not all of these as yet were under Dutch rule.2 Although she ruled for the rest of the colonial period, Wilhelmina never visited her colony. She never experienced the sudden monsoonal downpours, the green landscapes dominated by volcanoes or the spicy heat, but every year her birthday was celebrated there, with night markets and festive arches. What was it like for the Dutch, ruling that vast archipelago of Indonesia? The Dutch made up a special, upper social class of the Indies – soldiers, administrators, managers, teachers, pioneers. They lived linked to, and yet separate from, their native subjects. From 1900 to 1942 these colonial rulers worked to make the islands a single, prosperous colony, and for that they expected gratitude. In 1945, when the Pacific War ended and the Dutch attempted to reassert their control over the islands of Indonesia, they were genuinely shocked that some of the peoples of their islands would fight to the death to keep them out. There was a vast gap between Dutch perceptions of their rule and the views of their Indonesian subjects, but it is important to understand the Dutch views, because they have shaped modern Indonesia. 9\n\n10\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia conquering the indies\n\nTo create a modern colony Wilhelmina’s loyal subjects had to complete a takeover begun when their ancestors founded the port city of Batavia – now Jakarta–on the northwest coast of the island of Java in 1619. It was significant for Indonesia’s creation as an unplanned colony that it was founded on business, not Dutch national expansionism. These seventeenth-century Dutchmen set up this colony as investors in the world’s first great multinational company, the United East India Company. Batavia became the centre of its Asian trading network. Over the next 200 years, the Company acquired additional ports as trading bases and safeguarded its interests by gradually taking over surrounding territory. By 1800 the Company had been closed down, but the Dutch had achieved control over most of Java, parts of the larger island of Sumatra, the fabled eastern spice islands of Maluku (the Moluccas) and the hinterlands of various ports where they had established bases for themselves, such as Makasar on the island of Sulawesi (Celebes) and Kupang on the island of Timor. By the end of the nineteenth century, steamships and the new Suez Canal made for shorter journey times from Europe and new attitudes towards expansion. Tiny Holland, nostalgic for its seventeenth-century greatness as a world trading power, joined in the competition for empire that had overtaken the mentality of Europe. Despite claims that the Dutch government had no policy of aggression, only one of ‘reluctant imperialism’,3 from the 1870s onwards the Dutch fought a series of wars to enlarge and consolidate their possessions. The Dutch venture into full-blown empire-building began with the strong and independent Muslim Sultanate of Aceh. Aceh, on the vast and promising island of Sumatra, was known until recently as a centre of bitter conflict and rebellion. Its name also dripped blood in the nineteenth century. The French, British and Dutch were all trying to consolidate their holdings in Southeast Asia and were interested in the natural wealth that Aceh had to offer, particularly pepper and oil. In 1873 the Dutch invaded Aceh, little realising that it would take thirty years to complete the takeover. For a Dutch soldier watching the lush green shoreline as he sailed towards Aceh, it must have seemed as though the pending task was going to be very easy. Standing with him on the ship were troops from all over Europe whom the Dutch had signed up, men down on their luck or getting away from their pasts. In separate quarters on board were local soldiers from Java\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n11\n\nand from Ambon, in the spice islands of Maluku. The colonial army had the latest repeating rifles and heavy artillery, while the Acehnese merely had spears and knives. Despite the confidence of the Dutch invaders, the Acehnese almost won. Indies warfare was a nightmare. The Dutch were faced with resistance from local guerrilla fighters whom they could not distinguish from the rest of the Acehnese population. Acehnese guerrilla tactics involved setting traps, laying ambushes and launching surprise attacks near the barracks on soldiers who wandered off on their own. Every village harboured potential death. The ordinary European soldiers lived in fear and hatred, and they were reduced to levelling villages and killing women and children in an attempt to undermine an invisible enemy. The generals running the campaign were heavily criticised by the Dutch public – the war was going on too long, was costing too much, and stories leaked out about the execution of prisoners and innocent civilians alike. Forced labour, torture and sadism were commonplace Dutch tactics. One set of photographs from the war showed colonial troops, dressed in black, standing amid villages where the Acehnese corpses formed a tightly packed, bloody carpet on the ground, interrupted by a single surviving child, crying. Dutch political cartoonists picked up this theme, commenting on the blind and immoral adherence to the colonial policy of successive political leaders (Figure 1.1). The Dutch government hid behind official denials and the fog of war propaganda. A victory in the battle for public support came in 1894. On Lombok, the island to the east of Bali, reports emerged that Lombok’s Hindu Balinese rulers were oppressing the local Muslim Sasak people. Sasak leaders appealed to the Dutch for help. The Dutch army moved in and, with relative ease, killed or captured most of the Balinese rulers, allowing the campaign to be presented to the public as a success. Lombok showed politicians and critics that there would be no repeat of the debacle that had seen the Dutch nearly defeated in Aceh. The resulting enthusiasm for conflict was echoed in one of the soldiers’ songs: And to Lombok off we go And we are bored with peace So we’ll shoot with powder and lead Those Balinesers dead.\n\nHowever, the long-term results were not so good for the Sasaks. The Dutch forced the exportation of their rice, while taxing them heavily. After a few\n\n12\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nFigure 1.1 ‘East Indies Blind’.

Courtesy Leo Haks.\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n13\n\ndecades of Dutch rule, Lombok went from being a wealthy rice bowl to an impoverished and semi-desert island.4 The warrior General J. B. van Heutsz (1851–1924) finally solved the problem of Aceh. During a frustrating tour of duty there he met Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje (1857–1936), an academic who made a career of studying Islam. As his first major colonial assignment Snouck, a man who radiated presence and authority, was charged with obtaining inside information on the activities of Muslims from the Indies who lived in the Middle East or travelled there to undertake the pilgrimage to Mecca. When his investigations revealed that Aceh was becoming an international rallying point for Muslims opposed to European colonialism, Snouck’s response was to try to understand the social basis of Acehnese resistance. He discovered that the religious leaders played the key role in heading the Acehnese struggle and that there was a growing tension between these Muslim heads and the traditional Acehnese aristocracy. Snouck correctly advised the Dutch government to capitalise on this divergence by doing more to win over the Acehnese nobles. Appointed chief-of-staff in Aceh in 1898, van Heutsz followed Snouck’s advice: ‘When one wishes to rule a country, to have one’s will respected there, then one must establish oneself in that country.’5 In this approach, respect was won by separating the Acehnese resistance fighters from their bases in the countryside and by strengthening the authority of the Acehnese rulers. At the suggestion of an Acehnese aristocrat, van Heutsz adopted some of the guerrilla tactics of the enemy by creating highly mobile units in the Dutch army. He combined their use with the superior firepower of the new repeating carbines until he had created a deadly scorched earth policy that saw 10,000 Acehnese flee to Malaya. As a result, the resistance lost its local supplies and support, and van Heutsz was made governor of an Aceh declared pacified in 1903. To give the appearance of peace, the European troops were kept to a minimal level of 12,000, but continuing popular resistance meant that 23,000 Indonesian soldiers, mainly from Java, Ambon and Manado in Sulawesi, over half of the entire colonial army, had to be in Aceh. The total cost of the war was f 400 million (US$160 million, equivalent to more than US$10 billion in present-day terms), 37,000 troops killed on the Dutch side and 60,000–70,000 Acehnese lives lost. General van Heutsz’s success in Aceh made him a popular hero of expansion, and his supporters were able to silence the voices of doubt and criticism in the Dutch parliament and newspapers. Van Heutsz’s achievement was further recognised in 1904 by his elevation as Wilhelmina’s governor general in the Indies. Monuments were later erected to him in Aceh, Batavia\n\n14\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nand Amsterdam in the 1920s and 1930s, and a boulevard in Batavia was named after him. Politicians and military leaders were able to claim they had a moral duty to free common people from oppression or backwardness. They said they had to punish or modernise independent indigenous rulers who practised slavery, ruled unjustly and did not respect international law. So the colonial army rolled through sultanates and small kingdoms in Sumatra, Maluku, Borneo, the Southeast Islands and Sulawesi between 1901 and 1910. Some rulers, such as the sultans of Tidore (Maluku), Pontianak (Kalimantan) and Palembang (Sumatra), wisely asked for Dutch protection from independent neighbours to avoid military conquest. By doing this they could negotiate better rights and conditions when they came within the colonial system. Two expeditions were sent to conquer the rulers of South Bali. When one of the South Balinese kings let his subjects claim the contents of a ship under Dutch jurisdiction wrecked on his shores, the Dutch argued that international shipping rights had not been protected and consequently launched an invasion in 1906. The justification for a second action in 1908 was that Bali had become a major centre of opium smuggling. In both cases the results were appallingly spectacular. Rather than surrender their independence, the Balinese kings, queens, princes, princesses and their followers armed themselves with swords and spears to face the Dutch forces. Dressed in ceremonial white, they marched into a barrage of Dutch bullets and cannons where death was bloody, brutal and certain. More than 1,300 members of the ruling class and their servants died during these invasions, which the Balinese still speak about today. By 1909 the Dutch had established an integrated territory. Many areas of the Indies were placed initially under military rule, which often amounted to establishing what one contemporary critic called dictatorships.6 The final tidying up of the map occurred in the 1920s when the Dutch took full control over part of the island of New Guinea against the threat of expanding Australian interests. administering the empire Local lords who survived the takeovers served well as the vehicles for a policy known as indirect rule. Under this system, the Dutch saw themselves as preserving tradition by providing a layer of wise administrators above the natural native leaders of the people. Traditional rulers became regents; the indigenous aristocracy became an indigenous civil service. They were placed under the hierarchy of Dutch officials: residents, assistant residents\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n15\n\nand district officers. This indirect rule would not disturb the traditional life of the peasantry, and besides, it was cheap, since the Dutch did not have to re-create a state from the bottom up. In 1900 Queen Wilhelmina needed only 250 European and 1,500 indigenous civil servants, and of course her army, to rule 35 million colonial subjects. Snouck Hurgronje’s earlier successes as a colonial adviser on native affairs meant that he was able to influence the administration. He and his followers saw expert knowledge as the best way of providing ‘vigorous but righteous colonial government’.7 Snouck supported the development of Dutch bureaucrats expert in language, culture and local law, who, like him, would have special insights into the cultural motivations of local populations. After he left the Indies he went back to Leiden University, the colonial training centre, where he himself had been educated. Now, as a professor, he could lead the way in training his successors. In the system Snouck supported, civil servants had to pass examinations, and fewer were promoted on the basis of family connections. Efficiency based on merit would make government run like a machine for the purpose of social engineering. Whereas colonial officials had once come exclusively from the aristocracy, by the early twentieth century they were increasingly from the upper bourgeoisie, and eventually from the middle and even working classes. During van Heutsz’s period as governor general the first female colonial civil servant, Laura Ellinger, took her examination, although she never achieved high rank. The bureaucrats took their duty very seriously. They wanted to act on behalf of the peoples of the Indies, to protect them from the worst effects of modern life but, in contradictory fashion, to develop the Indies at the same time into a modern state.8 ‘Peace and order’ was the stated aim of the administration, but it was an order obsessed with files and memos. Even Dutch observers thought this bureaucratic attitude extreme. One critic was the Netherlands’ major novelist at the turn of the century, the flamboyant Louis Couperus (1863– 1923). In his novel of colonial life, The Hidden Force, he used a fictional civil servant to satirise the fussy bureaucracy of the colonial period, while at the same time unconsciously highlighting the concepts of race that underpinned colonialism: ‘The Secretary, Onno Eldersma, was a busy man. The daily mail brought an average of two hundred letters and documents to the residency office.’ Eldersma ‘worked morning, noon, and night. He allowed himself no siesta. He took a hurried lunch at four o’clock and then rested a little.’ This fastidious obsessive could not delegate, since he felt that Europeans were better suited to this work than natives: ‘he needed all his blood, all his muscles, all his nerves, for his work.’ Whether it was\n\n16\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nworth the effort or not, men like Eldersma left impressive sets of statistics that have aided historians in their efforts to understand the Indies. As they professionalised themselves, Dutch officials moved to an uneasy relationship with the indigenous regents. In Dutch accounts the latter were strange and corrupt, but fascinating, despots. The ambivalent relationship between Dutch and indigenous rulers was a legacy of the nineteenth century, when Dutch administrators felt that they should adopt local customs such as large entourages of servants, including the potent symbol of a goldpainted ceremonial umbrella of office. Governor General van Heutsz had attempted reform in 1904 by banning the Dutch from using emblems like the umbrellas, but until the 1940s Dutch high officials encouraged regents to hold elaborate rituals, at the centre of which both parties to government would sit, with their wives and servants, on gold-painted chairs as their subjects turned out to make obeisance.9 ethical progress Queen Wilhelmina reigned in a time of new attitudes, of which a disposition towards bureaucracy was one. Aged only eighteen when made queen, she inherited a realm that was in poor economic shape. Her coronation came at the end of what had been the greatest economic depression in the modern world. In the late 1880s and early 1890s the commodity prices on which the colony had previously depended had collapsed. Wilhelmina sought advice from her parliamentarians in The Hague on how to manage the colony for the greatest good of all her subjects. Throughout the nineteenth century a colonial surplus had been extracted each year as a payment into the Dutch treasury. Thanks in part to this payment, the Netherlands had modernised and built a thriving bourgeois society. Prior to the depression the Liberal Party had been the dominant voice in policy-making and politics in the Netherlands. Believing in the free market above all else, it instituted policies to expand the plantations in the Indies, not only causing an increase in agricultural production for export, but also focusing the colony’s economy on the Netherlands. Liberals had promised that, as the economy expanded, the life of the natives would improve because local opportunities would increase as prosperity trickled down. The economic depression exposed this as an illusion. It became apparent to journalists and civil servants on the ground that the majority of the population of the Indies was as badly off under liberalism as under the regulated economy that had preceded it. While a few Dutch profited, tens of thousands of colonial subjects starved.\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n17\n\nThe worst results of the policy were clearest on the Outer Islands, the islands outside of Java, Madura and Bali, where frontier plantations of tobacco and rubber pushed back the jungle. Coolies from China, India and later Java, who were imported by the tens of thousands to work these plantations, were controlled by regular floggings and a regime that resulted in high death rates. Dutch who attempted to document abuses usually found themselves discredited and demoted when plantation company executives back home complained to friends in parliament, who in turn complained to their friends administering the Indies. Negative reports were buried in archives.10 One campaigner against the inequities of the colonial system was Piet Brooshooft (1845–1921), a plump, crusading journalist with a walrus moustache. From the time of his arrival in the Indies he began to write about the moral duty of the Dutch to give the Indies what the Indies was due. Brooshooft, encouraged by a small group of socialists and concerned middle-class Dutch in the colonies, campaigned against the colonial surplus as an unjust imposition on the Indies. In his view the ‘childlike’ peoples of the Indies needed assistance, not oppression. As editor of the largest and liveliest of the Dutch-language Indies newspapers, The Locomotive, Brooshooft published works by Snouck Hurgronje about how to understand the natives and sent reporters out to all parts of the colony to dig into local developments. In the twenty-first century it is hard to remember how important newspapers were, but as the main medium of communication, they were the voice of the Indies, particularly in the absence of any bodies that allowed for political representation in the colony, or of the colony in the Dutch parliament. Brooshooft drew attention to the uncomfortable issues of colonialism, particularly what was euphemistically called ‘declining Native welfare’ – the grinding poverty, crop failure, famine and epidemics evident in 1900.11 People of like mind gathered to Brooshooft because of the impact of his writings. They included lawyers and supportive politicians who were able to get the queen’s ear. They used Brooshooft’s campaign to promote the notion that the Netherlands owed the peoples of the Indies a ‘debt of honour’. Bad conscience was translated into a noble policy of improving their lives. The young Queen Wilhelmina, under advice from her prime minister of the Christian Anti-Revolutionary Party, proclaimed the new policy for the new century when in 1901 she formally inaugurated a benevolent ‘Ethical Policy’, intended to bring progress and prosperity to the natives, including the provision of education and other opportunities.\n\n18\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nBecause this aim was so vague, the Policy could be interpreted in different ways: as a beacon of economic progress, with which the liberals could identify; as a means of improving the welfare of the peasantry, which socialists advocated; as a force for Christianity, to please religious parties; or as a set of general guidelines to ease the local people into the modern world. Whatever form ‘progress’ took, the basis of the colony was still profit: ‘The Liberals entered “Love for the Javanese” in their published accounts, but did not let it touch their pockets; and when the Ethical [Policy] leaders hauled down the Jolly Roger and hoisted the Cross, they did not change the sailing orders.’12 The Ethical Policy period actually depended on the concurrent military takeover, because only when the Indies were a single entity could the Policy’s stated aim of modernisation be achieved. That is why, ironically, Governor General van Heutsz was one of the Policy’s strongest supporters. Under the rule of this ‘unifier of the Indies’, railways were expanded over Java and Sumatra, ancient monuments such as the temple of Borobudur were restored and educational opportunities were expanded with great vigour. A type of progress did occur under the Ethical Policy as the economy improved. Commodity prices recovered from the depression and resumed their upward climb, leading to substantial capital investment in the colony. The old standards of Indies trade had been sugar, tin, copra and the coffee Americans identified with Java. In the early decades of the twentieth century these were joined by rubber, tobacco, tea and oil as the principal exports of the Indies. Big multinationals came onto the scene: the British Billiton Tin Company moved into mining, Standard Oil from the US was attracted to oil-rich areas such as Aceh, while Royal Dutch Shell was established as a joint venture. The plantations of the Outer Islands, especially the former Sultanate of Deli, part of the East Coast of Sumatra Residency, required a tough approach. Planters were an alienated foreign legion from all over Europe. These people, often escaping dubious pasts, endured the malarial conditions of the ‘burning forest . . . the vibrating sky above the motionless smoke’ and the smell of the rubber processing factory – ‘like rotten eggs combined with Lysol’ – in the hope of one day returning home with vast wealth. Some did, considering that during the boom time for rubber around 1925, supervisors earned bonuses of f 140,000 (US$56,000, equivalent to millions of dollars in present-day terms) per year. They saw themselves as hard-working, although the job consisted mainly of walking around giving orders to coolies, a monotonous existence broken by the excesses of weekly drinking bouts, creating the masculine camaraderie of\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n19\n\nFigure 1.2 One guilder: Dutch colonial banknote with a depiction of Borobudur temple statues.\n\na football club. Dutch, German, English, French and others built grand fantasy houses for themselves in attempts to create an imposing style of life.13 As one management manual of the time observed, industrial knowledge was not the major qualification for running a tobacco plantation: ‘A man . . . might know everything on how to cultivate tobacco and care for it, but he will be useless in Deli if he does not know how to exact obedience.’ These Europeans lived in an atmosphere of constant menace, regarding the coolie workers as less than human and liable to run amok. The threat of violence would be met by violence, and these labourers, perceived simultaneously as lazy and treacherous, would be forced to carry out their arduous work. A typical incident was cited by Dutch authorities in support of a request for state-sanctioned force to be used in the area. An assistant, ‘Heer O., when making his way at 5 in the morning to his work, encountered a group of coolies who assumed an unwilling posture.’ Workers were expected to show subservience, but instead ‘[w]hile he was speaking to the men and giving them orders, he suddenly was dealt a hard blow with the shaft of a hoe, whereupon he fell into a ditch.’ Luckily he was armed, ‘and he shot his fierce opponent smack dead. Instead of being deterred, the rest of the band\n\n20\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nassumed such a threatening stance that the assaulted assistant was forced to make use of his weapon again with the result that a second assailant lost his life and a third was seriously wounded.’ The rest fled. Workers and managers were caught up in this cycle of antagonism and violence. A manager had to be able to manipulate the coolie foremen through a combination of economic incentives and claims to represent legal authority in order to avoid such rebellion. Distance from the natives was allimportant, even for Europeans lower in the hierarchy: ‘The European employees . . . seldom spoke to them in anything other than a snarl in bad Malay, which is said to be necessary for their prestige!’ Maintaining white status also meant that local people saw only what was an ideal white society – poor whites, let alone the disabled, should be invisible in the colony and were usually repatriated.14 The Dutch population in the Indies saw a rise in its general standard of living between 1902 and 1913. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War One, and initially Dutch investors at home and in the colony did well supplying raw materials to both sides. However, when the Germans employed submarines to attack shipping in 1917, trade between the Indies and Europe was cut off. Those Dutch businessmen who were able to hold on became rich after the Great War from speculating against internationally inflated prices for the kinds of raw materials the Indies supplied. Despite an economic downturn in the early 1920s, a partnership was developing between Dutch political and business leaders to inject cash into the Indies. The partnership was instrumental in making the Indies a single economic unit. Supporting the unification of the colonial economy was the new shipping line, the KPM, or Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij, founded in 1888. In this instance, government and industry worked together to push other shipping lines out of the Indies, although they were not entirely successful. Still, the KPM served to integrate a whole range of economic activities under Dutch domination, by setting up a network of ports that was centred on Tanjung Priok, Batavia’s new harbour. Islands that had previously been linked to Singapore or the Malay Peninsula now focused their economic activities on Java. Thus, through the KPM the centre of political power became the centre of the colony’s economy. When Batavia became Jakarta in 1950 that central role was passed over to independent Indonesia.15 Even with sharp fluctuations, the growth rate of the colonial era averaged 2 per cent per annum between 1901 and 1929, and although plantations\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n21\n\ntook a leading role in this expansion, manufacturing, construction, transport, wholesale and retail trade and the government sector all increased rapidly. By 1929 capital investment had grown to US$1,600 million (over $50 billion in present-day terms). The government provided infrastructure for business such as the laying of 7,425 kilometres of rail and tram tracks by 1930. In turn business invested heavily in the latest technology, for example installing 6,472 boilers in plantation factories in 1930. Although they were dependent on the British for big capital, politicians did everything they could to encourage Dutch-owned or jointly owned business, so that, for example, the majority of the colony’s US$76 million worth of petroleum exports in 1930 belonged to Royal Dutch Shell. The sign of the success of government and business was that in 1929 the value of exports was in excess of US$433 million. At the peak of its trade in the 1930s, the Indies produced 37 per cent of world rubber, dominated the smaller trade in pepper (exporting 86 per cent of the spice) and was a significant player in markets such as sugar and copra. The Great Depression that transpired at the end of 1929 was a major setback to business, and many of those who had profited earlier went bankrupt. The Dutch government had done almost nothing to encourage the development of the colony’s economic independence and provided only minimal protection for local manufacturing through the introduction of tariffs in 1933. Dutch politicians were not interested in allowing the Indies to stand on its own feet. Profits went to big business rather than being invested in the colony. Between 1935 and 1939 – even after the impact of the Great Depression – the Indies still provided 14 to 17 per cent of the Netherlands’ national income.16 Because Dutch politicians did not want to lose control, the Indies remained an appendage of the Netherlands throughout the colonial period. However, government advisers from Snouck onwards argued that there should be greater autonomy for the colony and won a concession to autonomy in the form of a policy of decentralisation, initiated in 1903. But this resulted in separation in appearance only. Decentralisation led to increased local authority through the establishment of city and regency councils. In 1918 a People’s Council was set up for the whole colony, a progressive move compared with the policies of other colonial regimes. This body had been a long time in planning, but its establishment was hastened by the growth of Communism in both the Netherlands and the Indies. However, the potential for establishing democracy through these institutions was undermined by a combination\n\n22\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nof Dutch fascination with indigenous aristocracy and an unwillingness to give up real power. Setting up the regency councils strengthened the aristocracy. In Bali, as in a number of other areas, heads of royal families previously exiled because they had stood up to Dutch invasions were now reinstated and made regents who served as heads of councils in each of the island’s former kingdoms. In the slightly more democratic city councils, suffrage was severely limited. Dutch positions were guaranteed, and the highest ones (such as that of mayor) were always appointments, as was the case in the Netherlands itself. The prerequisites for franchise on city councils were literacy and a tax payment of more than f 300 per annum (US$120). While a Dutch resident earned what was considered a modest sum by the standards of his equivalents in other colonial systems – f 13,500 per annum (US$5,400) – the highest-paid coolies would have needed to work day and night for a year to earn f 300 in total, let alone pay tax on it. More than 80 per cent of the taxpayers of Java and Madura earned less than this. In theory the vote was given to women after a long struggle, but as a result of official stalling they never actually got to exercise that right, mainly because they did not pay tax. However, they were allowed to stand for office, and in the 1930s four Javanese women were members of municipal councils, mainly by direct appointment. Government policies placed great emphasis on education as the path to native progress, at the same time trying to keep the native population from assuming too great a role in the colony. Colonial adviser Snouck Hurgronje expounded the view that ‘our rule will have to justify itself on the basis of lifting the natives up to a higher level of civilization in line with their innate capacities.’ This was the basis of Snouck’s policy of ‘association’, since it was association with Europeans that would ‘lift up’ the natives. Snouck’s test of the theory was to see if an elite of educated natives could absorb Western knowledge to the point where it improved their ‘inner character’. If this occurred, they could be elevated to ‘help’ govern the Indies, a view that was controversial amongst colonials who refused to believe there could be equality between rulers and ruled. In pursuing his theory, Snouck became the patron of a carefully selected group of Sumatran and Javanese aristocrats, collaborators who could be paraded as examples of success in colonial policy.17 For some Dutch advocates, educational expansion was an opportunity to open up the Outer Islands to missionary activities. It was a way of\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n23\n\nbringing people the Light without the government making major investments in building schools and providing teachers, instead providing only subsidies, as it did to church schools in the Netherlands. So areas with existing Christian populations, such as Ambon (Maluku), Manado (North Sulawesi) and Flores, were joined by new mission fields in the Toraja highlands of Central Sulawesi, the Batak highlands of Sumatra and West New Guinea. The missionaries, arriving in remote mountain regions after weeks of arduous trekking, needed the strongest of faiths to persevere. They had to spend years learning the local languages and were continually worried that their converts might slip back into local spiritualism or animism. While religious politicians were all in favour of expanding missionary activities, rationalist planners, including Snouck, saw such moves as an unhelpful provocation to Islam. The planners succeeded in curbing the missions and banning them entirely from some areas. Some Dutch took to heart Snouck’s views on improving the natives. Socialist and Communist teachers helped the peoples of the Indies by bringing them notions of freedom and equality. A group of these teachers set up an Indies Party and spread the idea that the natives should do more than just help rule. These radicals called for an Indies ruled by a coalition of Dutch born in the Indies, those of mixed descent and, most shockingly, natives. A teacher of German in a Surabaya high school inspired one young native man to read Karl Marx and introduced the student to politicians who treated their native friends as equals. This was an important lesson that the student, Sukarno, was to carry into his career as political leader and Indonesia’s first president. When identified, subversive teachers were expelled from the colony.18 In 1927 a reform of the People’s Council saw the number of elected members (thirty-eight) outweigh appointments (twenty-two), and by 1929 thirty of the sixty members were natives, mainly from the aristocracy. The number of native seats mattered little, however, since this body never had real legislative power. The Council’s only gesture towards voicing the desire for an independent Indies was a mild petition to the queen requesting a conference to discuss self-government. This resulted in a furious exchange of letters among Dutch officials. The governor general at the time was embarrassed, and his recommendation to the minister for the colonies was a masterpiece of bureaucratic stonewalling that dismissed the petition as unconstitutional and undesirable.19 Dutch contemporaries, such as the acerbic novelist Louis Couperus, knew that at the heart of administration was an attitude meant to impress\n\n24\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nother Westerners: ‘The European . . . rules arrogantly . . . amidst all the intricate machinery of his authority . . . [which] he slips into gear with the certainty of clockwork, controlling its every movement.’ This was a system of rule that appeared as ‘a masterpiece, a world created’.20 Part of the creation of this ‘masterpiece’ had been the establishment in 1916 of a body to spy on the population, the Political Intelligence Service (PID). PID spies were recruited from all levels of indigenous society, since the pay was good, and there were many opportunities to prove one’s loyalty and avenge one’s enemies. The reports that PID members compiled emphasised the strength of Communists and other subversives, mostly in order to justify continued employment. The secret police magnified government paranoia that the natives were getting too much education without showing due appreciation of Dutch benevolence.21 Peace and order often meant arbitrary rule amounting to dictatorial power. On PID advice, the governor general and those immediately below him could gaol or exile to remote islands those deemed to be a political threat, without having to provide detailed justification. The PID’s major effect was to undermine local trust in government, so that its spy networks corrupted social relationships. The almost simultaneous establishment of the People’s Council with its opposite, a secretive security body, is an indication of the impossible contradictions that tore the Ethical Policy to shreds. public welfare The social results of the Ethical Policy and decentralisation were best seen in the new neat public space of cities. In the first three decades of the twentieth century, the Department of Public Works sponsored the construction of major public buildings and introduced city planning, embodied in the work of the Indies’ leading architect and town planner, Thomas Karsten (1884–1945). He developed predecessors’ ideas of incorporating indigenous elements – the spirit of the Indies – into a rational European structure. On arrival in the Indies in 1914, Karsten started working in Java’s third major city, Semarang. He was later involved in urban extension and rebuilding in almost every city in Sumatra and Java. For leading Dutch citizens he designed solidly monumental two-storey houses, the roofs of which were in the high-pitched colonial style; for royalty he designed new pavilions that were simultaneously modern European and traditional Javanese; to organise the small traders of the central Javanese cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta he planned public market buildings; for major firms he created\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n25\n\nsplendid headquarters; and for the new suburbs in Batavia he produced master plans, including those for the central square of the city. Still, in 1930 the cities were for Europeans. The majority of natives (over 90 per cent) lived in the country, while the majority of Europeans (over 75 per cent) lived in the cities.22 The basis of Karsten’s cities was order, and bringing hygiene to native quarters was an important part of that. Besides expertise in language, law and culture, the Dutch promoted new kinds of knowledge of medicine and public health. In the nineteenth century there had been a government preoccupation with venereal disease amongst soldiers. By the twentieth century concern about sexual health was extended to the general population, which meant government officials spent much of their time attempting to monitor prostitutes. In the nineteenth century Dutch officials had also been concerned about smallpox, and large-scale vaccination programmes were well under way by the 1850s. This concern was extended to examining the sources of other diseases, especially plague, which arrived in Sumatra in 1905 and Java around 1910. Dysentery remained a major killer during the Dutch period, and it was not until the advent of antibiotics in the second half of the twentieth century that many of the intestinal diseases could be brought under control. Public health programmes, promoting clean water and better living conditions, were the only means of controlling many diseases. By the 1930s, public health was being taught in the Indies by people such as J. H. de Haas. Dr de Haas was a pioneer of infant nutrition and a radical socialist who, distressed by infant mortality rates of up to 300 per 1,000, tried to ensure basic nutrition. He supervised programmes in which condensed and evaporated milk, as well as sour milk, were dispensed to mothers, and he and his colleagues introduced the innovation of soya milk as an alternative source of vitamins. Malaria remained a problem for Dutch and natives alike, although quinine brought a major breakthrough in the battle against it. Programmes to clean up native housing areas were aimed at getting rid of the breeding grounds for mosquitoes in order to reduce malaria and dengue fever. Other programmes also attempted to get rid of the rats that were major disease carriers, but with little success – rats that would outweigh cats are still a familiar sight in Indonesian cities. Government efforts to get involved in all aspects of daily life for the good health of the natives were not that successful. The native sections of the cities remained wild areas resistant to official campaigns.\n\n26\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nDe Haas was unusual in the health bureaucracy, which saw its aims as researching health issues and making policy, not actually treating the sick. Health expenditure was never more than 5 per cent of the budget for the Indies, sometimes as low as 2.5 per cent, half of what was spent on education, one-fifth to one-ninth of what was spent on the military.23 maintaining dutch society When Wilhelmina became queen, only 76,000 Europeans were living in the Indies. Policing and policy could do only so much in enabling a small foreign group to rule over a massive population. The colonial rulers needed to be able to keep social groups apart, keep them from conceiving of a common interest and make the European presence seem somehow natural. The main mechanism by which the Dutch achieved this was the institutionalisation of concepts of race that were common throughout all colonial societies at the time. These ideas produced a version of what would later be referred to in South Africa as apartheid. Colonial race-based societies are hierarchical – whiteness puts you at the top. In the Netherlands East Indies this was never straightforward, however, since the boundaries and definition of who was white were contested. As colonial authorities attempted to legislate boundaries, contradictions became apparent. In particular there was a split between the groups Dutch referred to respectively as ‘stayers’ and ‘pures’. ‘Stayers’ were the successors of the original employees of the United East India Company. Company colonialism created a culture in the Indies quite different from that of the constrained Protestant society of the Netherlands. The Company’s legacy produced sarong- and sandal-wearing Dutchmen who ate rice, spoke a version of Malay and took local women as concubines. Their twentieth-century successors were often born in the Indies and strove to create something that tied them to the place. They wanted to live in an Indies society that was a ‘higher synthesis between east and west’. One of them, Rob Nieuwenhuys, looking back, expressed it this way: ‘Culturally I am a European . . . but emotionally many parts of my person lie in Indonesia.’ Being brought up by a Javanese maid and living in the colony during the formative years of his life made the Indies part of his character (Figure 1.3).24 The stayers were cosmopolitan. They imported English, French and German magazines from neighbouring colonies rather than Dutch magazines from the Netherlands. Their language was smattered with indigenous words, mostly for communication with servants or workers – nasi goreng\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n27\n\nFigure 1.3 Dutch cartoonist Menno: a Dutchman in the East, newly arrived and thirty years later.

Writers contributed to the sense of an Indies society of stayers with its own distinctive cultural identity and established new local publications on everything from tourism to literature. Artists’ organisations – Art Circles – were established by stayers in all the major cities of the colony. Painters from these circles depicted an Indies of palm trees and peasants in paddy fields, a peaceful green world.25 The distinctive cultural identity of stayers was passed on through subsequent generations. For many Dutch the Indies meant family mementos such as batik textiles or wayang puppet figures, or even ‘buffalo horns, a wild panther hide’ hanging on their walls back home. Looking back at the end of the twentieth century, the Netherlands’ leading novelist, Hella Haasse, herself one of those who lived in the Indies, evokes the colonial emotional pull in her semi-factual book Lords of the Tea. For her main character, the founder of tea estates in Sunda (West Java), ‘Java was a constant in the life of his family. His parents had themselves previously\n\n28\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nresided there for two years, since in the passage of two decades many relatives had gone before them.’ From trips with his grandfather he acquired an interest in ‘colonists’: ‘They looked up to the viewer in the Netherlands from photographs in prominently displayed albums, posed against the background of a veranda with white pillars, or of avenues surrounded by exotic trees.’26 These distant family members were constantly recalled at gatherings, their long letters home creating a desire for the warm tropical promise of the Indies far away from the cold, wintry Netherlands. By the end of the nineteenth century the second group of Dutch, the ‘pures’, had grown in number to become the dominant group. They usually had little or no emotional attachment to the Indies, and were there just to make money and go home as soon as possible. As Europeans started to assert imperial ambitions, their sense of being European increased. Cartoonists produced satirical images of the stayer as fat, gin-sodden and self-important. If the Dutch became ‘too Indies’ they were in danger of ‘disappearing into the kampung [native quarter]’ – the term for going native. Dutchmen’s whiteness started to solidify. Many who grew up in the cities of the early-twentieth-century Indies remember having very little indigenous contact; those who were ‘too Indies’ received lesser wages. Pures started to keep stayers out, as one woman recalled of her stayer father in Sumatra. Even though he was on a Dutch soccer team, when playing away he had to sleep in downmarket hotels apart from his teammates. Whiteness even had to be worn, in the form of the white colonial suit (sometimes complete with pith helmet), an import from neighbouring British colonies. In colonial images the Dutch civil servant or plantation manager in his glaring white outfit stands out above the crouching coolies or peasants.27 The push for separateness was a consequence of the fact that many Dutch leaders considered Snouck’s association policy to have failed, since rather than producing pro-Dutch intellectuals, it produced Indonesian nationalists. Thus the advocates of ‘whiteness’ become more actively political. A Fatherland Club was established by pures in 1929 as a way of ensuring that patriotism was centred on the Netherlands. Its ideology was fostered by conservative elements at home and in the colonies, and by the late 1930s had merged into a form of National Socialism – the Netherlands had proportionally one of the largest Nazi parties in Europe. In 1935 the head of the Dutch National Socialist (Nazi) Party visited the Indies and was twice received by the governor general. J. B. van Heutsz, Jr, son of the great governor general, was the highest-ranking Dutch officer in the armed wing of the Nazi Party, the Waffen-SS.28\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n29\n\nInstitutionally, separateness was most apparent in law, as with other colonial systems. Law was a matter of race, race a matter of separate law, separate taxation and separate ways of being treated by state authorities. European law overrode all other forms. Native law was religious or traditional law. Chinese and others not classified as Native (known generally as Foreign Orientals) occupied an intermediate position. This did not mean that the Chinese were well regarded – Dutch accounts portray them as sneaky and inscrutable. Proposals made in the early twentieth century to give Chinese the same status as Europeans were strongly resisted on all sides. Those called Indos (Eurasians) could be reclassified, living some parts of their lives as Dutch and other parts as Native. Their status depended mainly on whether their fathers recognised them in law. The government operated on the principle that ‘racial consciousness is the lifeblood of colonial society’. Most aspects of life were racially distinguished, from train tickets to toilets, with a strong convergence of racial and class differences.29 Men dominated the public image of the Indies; women occupied difficult positions on the fault lines of Dutch–Indonesian relations. More and more white women arrived in the colony once transport became quicker – by 1930 approximately 113,000 of the 240,000 Europeans were women. They had to manage complicated households, maintain as European a lifestyle as possible and be symbols of their husbands’ status. This was never going to be easy. Ice chests struggled to keep the beer cold, and the cheese and butter from going off. On arrival women found that they already had servants, at the minimum a houseboy (who could be a man older than the new lady of the house), gardener, cook and, for the children, a nursemaid-cumhousemaid. A woman had to have a seamstress, who unlike the others did not live in the Dutch compound. A driver and a washerwoman made up the set of servants, and the size of one’s household indicated one’s status in the Dutch pecking order. To be poor was to have only one servant. Houseboys and drivers were dressed in special livery selected by the lady of the house.30 To teach colonial hierarchy, ladies’ manuals for the Indies, books of etiquette, were produced in the early twentieth century. The Colonial School for Girls and Women, teaching domestic science and other practical things, was set up in The Hague in 1920. In 1930 the Association for Housewives in the Indies was established in Batavia and then expanded to teach indigenous servants how to prepare proper European food. The Dutch were getting sick of eating the array of local dishes served up at the feasts called ‘rice table’.31\n\n30\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nThe arrival of Dutch women increased anxiety about the proximity of Dutch men and Indonesian women, since men had come to regard servants as sexual property. The reverse situation – liaisons between Dutch women and native men – were regarded as scandalous, even when the men involved were princes, as happened on a number of occasions. By the Great Depression, Dutch social patterns had become dominated by enclaves. The stayers expressed pangs of regret, but the pures were keen to take advantage of new ways of organising their lives. Dutch modernity, in the forms of electricity, piped water and sewerage, enabled the building of estates designed by top architects, as in the case of the Comal sugar estate near Java’s north coast, designed by the famous Karsten. The Comal estate included a major symbol of separation, a ‘hygienic’ whites-only swimming pool. Its lawns and herbaceous borders and special clubhouse were all set away from the native quarters. The clubhouse was the ultimate ‘pure’ institution, the acme of clubs being the Harmonie in Batavia. Dutch social activities, such as jazz dancing and tennis at the club, did not include natives.32 Even after the Great Depression, many Europeans in the Indies could still maintain a luxurious lifestyle. Besides the soldiers, civil servants, businessmen and planters, the idyll of the Indies attracted those in search of an artistic lifestyle: painters, photographers, beachcombers. The cooler hill stations of Java, such as Garut, were principal destinations. The lifestyles of those days were beautifully captured by the growing number of professional photographers who have left a splendid record of ideal life as seen through Dutch eyes. Their work was already material for colonial nostalgia before colonialism ended. A network of hotels grew up, Batavia’s Hotel des Indies premier among them, along with a new tourism industry. The novelist Louis Couperus was one of those who enjoyed the colonial lifestyle of the Indies. He might have given a jaundiced view of the Indies in his novel The Hidden Force, but when commissioned to write a travel book encouraging tourists from the Netherlands, Europe and America to experience the Indies, Couperus was lavish in his praise for the cool hill stations, the delights of the ancient Borobudur and Prambanan temples of Central Java and new opportunities to view the temples and rituals on the island of Bali. end of the idyll The idea that colonial life was some kind of Eden was undermined at the end of Dutch rule. As war loomed late in 1938, the Dutch attempted\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n31\n\nto assert their moral supremacy in the Indies. The rawest example of the sexual exploitation that had been an undercurrent of Dutch rule was an aggressive sex industry that had flourished by selling teenagers and young boys. Suddenly it became the subject of police raids and intense public scrutiny. In 1938 and 1939, a total of 223 men from all over the Indies, European, Eurasians, Chinese and Indonesians, were prosecuted for having sex with boys below the age of consent. At least seventy were convicted; two committed suicide. The sexual partners of many of those convicted were often between sixteen and twenty, but some cases involved children as young as nine. Artists, school principals, district officers, linguists, journalists and retired planters all found themselves subject to the same colonial law, and in the same gaols, but the heaviest penalties, up to three years’ imprisonment, went to Indonesians, Chinese and an Armenian, despite the fact that the majority of those convicted were Dutch.33 The paedophilia scandal was forgotten as World War Two cut off contact between colony and home country, and there was a brief period of enforced autonomy. In 1942 the Dutch government surrendered to the advancing Japanese with a rapidity that shocked its subjects. For most of the Dutch who lived under Japanese rule, the main memory is one of privation and suffering in internment camps, women and children in places like Ambarawa on Java, men on the Burma Railway. The architect Thomas Karsten and the nutritionist J. H. de Haas were imprisoned together at Cimalin concentration camp near Bandung, where Karsten died in 1945. Some of those Dutch who survived the war later moved to Australia rather than go back to the Netherlands. Those who chose to remain in the Indies at the end of the war faced a hostile reception from Indonesian nationalists who wanted independence. Typical of the reversal of roles experienced by the Dutch was a miserable encounter of one former prisoner of war, forced to let her one-time gardener sexually molest her in return for a supply of rice for her children, payback for his life of subservience. Those who chose to stay in the colony now lived in fear of rape and murder by Indonesian freedom fighters.34 In 1948, her jubilee year, Queen Wilhelmina abdicated in favour of her daughter, Juliana, just over a year before Indonesia gained its full independence. A small number of Dutch became Indonesian citizens, but most of those who stayed beyond the period of the Revolution and Indonesian independence were eventually expelled when the new Republic of Indonesia nationalised Dutch assets in 1957 and 1958. Such experiences made the time before 1939 seem doubly golden in Dutch memories.\n\n32\n\nA History of Modern Indonesia\n\nThe conflicts brought out by World War Two were symptomatic of the deep unease within colonialism. The Dutch felt disquiet about how to rule and how to relate to those whom they ruled. The image of control was always an illusion, but one to which the Dutch held strongly. The wartime prime minister of the Netherlands, looking back on the colonial period, saw it in the patronising terms shared by so many colonialists, as a period in which natives happily paid tribute to the Dutch, who in turn devoted themselves selflessly to native welfare: ‘The Netherlands Indies was a Free State, an evolutionary product of history, attached by indissoluble political and economic bonds to the Netherlands. Whites and coloured lived in harmony beneath a cloak which sheltered all, to the most humble.’ This devotion to native welfare was what enabled former Governor General de Graeff to say that he had ‘pawned his heart’ to the natives of the Indies. However, Louis Couperus, in his great novel of the Indies, saw the project of colonialism as an exercise in futility: The mysticism of concrete things on that island of mystery called Java. . . . Outwardly, a docile colony with a subject race. . . . But, down in its soul, it had never been conquered, though smiling in proud contemptuous resignation and bowing submissively beneath its fate . . . it lived in freedom its own mysterious life, hidden from Western eyes, however these might seek to fathom the secret . . . deep within itself divinely certain of its own views and so far removed from all its rulers’ ideals of civilization that no fraternization between master and servant will ever take place, because the difference that ferments in soul and blood remains insuperable.35\n\nDespite the way the Dutch had created the institutional and economic bases on which a state could be built, the Indies was still a colonial extension of the Netherlands. It was not an entity that was entirely known, let alone completely governed, by the Dutch. Attempts to create an ‘Indies’ society were always going to founder against the need to be separate in order to rule. Couperus showed that some Dutch realised there was something rotten underpinning colonial rule. To understand how those who would become Indonesians viewed that rule, we have to turn to their experiences of modern life in the early part of the twentieth century. Pramoedya Ananta Toer, looking back on the colonial era in which he was born, attempted to understand the effect of Dutch attitudes on his fellow Indonesians. When he wrote the series of novels This Earth of Mankind, he used the model of one young Javanese man, Raden Tirto Adhi Suryo, to explore the lure of the modern world that Western rule promised, as well as the contradictions between these attractions of modernity and the deep\n\nOur colonial soil\n\n33\n\ndiscrimination and suffering that resulted from colonialism. Pramoedya must also have been thinking about the experiences of his father, who was born just before Wilhelmina ascended the Dutch throne, and used his father’s experiences of life in the little Javanese town of Blora, the same town from which Tirto came, to reflect on the wider colonial picture.\n\nchapter 2\n\nCultures of the countryside\n\nBlora, in the teak forests of northern Central Java, is an undistinguished country town located in a regency of the same name. It lies on the Lusi River and, besides teak, is known for its limestone cliffs. The dusty streets are lined with mainly typical Javanese houses, small wooden dwellings with a welcoming veranda leading on to a front room, where there are chairs ready to receive visitors. Generations in Blora have studied the Koran and other holy works of Islam, woven striped cloth, performed puppet theatre, danced, grown rice or gone off to the sugar mills to find work. The Dutch did not leave much there, a post office – later destroyed in the war – a pillar commemorating forty years of Queen Wilhelmina’s rule and the railway. Yet despite its ordinariness Blora has had more than its share of fame and upheaval. In 1925 writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer was born there and, before him, Raden Mas Tirto Adhi Suryo (1880–1918), an aristocrat who was to become the father of Indonesia’s modern press, founder of the nationalist movement and hero of Pramoedya’s novels describing colonial society. In Blora Regency is the grave of Indonesia’s foremost feminist, Raden Ajeng Kartini, another member of the aristocracy. Blora exemplifies the cultural and social diversity found throughout the islands of Indonesia. In this one town were local lords and commoners, strict and liberal Muslims, peasants who adhered to local spiritualism, farmers fixed to their land and labourers forced by poverty to travel thousands of kilometres to find work. Just as there was a massive gulf between the Dutch and those they called natives, so Dutch rule magnified the differences among future Indonesians. the struggle of the aristocracy The aristocrats who made up the thin upper social layer of places like Blora were members of family networks that covered the whole island of Java 34\n\nCultures of the countryside\n\n35\n\nMap 2 Java, showing major cities by size.\n\nand its small neighbour, Madura. They had equivalents – rajas, sultans or chiefs – in each of the islands of the archipelago. Tirto Adhi Suryo was connected to those networks through his grandfather, one of the regents of Blora. While Tirto developed his nationalist sentiments from ideals of nobility espoused by the traditional aristocracy, he was unusual because he rejected aristocratic hierarchy. Most Javanese regents and their relatives imitated the elaborate ceremonial life of their relatives in the palaces of Central Java – the four courts of the cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. The members of Blora’s nobility, like the other Javanese aristocrats, regarded themselves as younger brothers and sisters of the royal families of the two cities.1 When Wilhelmina came to the Dutch throne, one of the Central Javanese rulers was Hamengkubuwono VII (‘He Who Holds the World in His Lap’), sultan of Yogyakarta, regulator of religion, born in 1839. In 1898 he had reigned for twenty-one years. Every morning a troop of servants came to bathe him and then carried the water out to distribute to the populace as holy water that could cure illnesses and bring good fortune. Everywhere he went he was escorted by a troop of bodyguards who were also trained dancers. His status was shown by the size of the retinue that\n\n36\n\nA History of Mod"
