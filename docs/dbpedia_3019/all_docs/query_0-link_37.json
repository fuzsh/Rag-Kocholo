        "text": "This was a presentation I gave at the one-day Conference on 'Indonesia sebagai Ruang Imajinasi [Imagining Indonesia]' at Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, on 7 November 2018. The paper was subsequently published in the conference proceedings - Indonesia sebagai Ruang Imajinasi. Ed.Ary Budhiyanto dkk. (Malang: Program Studi Antropologi, Fakultas Ilmu Pengetahuan Budaya, Universitas Brawijaya, 2018), pp.1-7. There is also a PowerPoint presentation which will help to bring this paper alive visually. The main theme I was asked to address by the conference organisers related to concepts of political space in 19th century Java (in particular during the era of Diponegoro [1785-1855] and the Java War [1825-30]) and the subsequent emergence of the concept of Indonesia through the publications of George Windsor Earl (1813-1865) and his younger contemporary, James Richardson Logan (1819-1869), founder of the Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia (Singapore, 1847-63). I also looked at the period of the early 20th century Indonesian nationalist movement or pergerakan nasional (1908-1942).\n\nMore than two decades after the end of the authoritarian era in 1998, what has actually changed in Indonesia's transitional trajectory into a fully consolidated democracy? The perennial issue of how its journey has been hobbled by the grip of the old nexus of political and business elites has sparked lively debates in academia. To date, Indonesianists have differed sharply in their views on Indonesia's achievements after more than twenty years of reform. Some experts have highlighted the dark face of a reform hijacked by the old nefarious political forces, while others provide a more optimistic picture of the achievements since the Reformasi era. It is against this backdrop that Jemma Purdey, Antje Missbach, and Dave McRae provide us with analyses that are much more comprehensive and nuanced on the trajectory of Indonesian democracy."
