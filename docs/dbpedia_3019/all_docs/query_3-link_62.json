This document provides a summary of changes in the Indonesian military elite between September 1993 and September 1995. It finds that this period saw significant turnover, with 94 transfers in the first nine months of 1995 alone. This change is linked to the replacement of the Army Chief of Staff in February 1995 and the rise of a new generation of officers. The summary examines trends in the military elite's ethnic backgrounds, specializations, graduating classes, ages, and timing of transfers over this period. It finds that Javaese officers still dominate, intelligence and special forces backgrounds remain common, and Classes 6 and 7 now control most key posts. The changes reflect efforts by the President and military leader to install their allies following political struggles in the preceding years.",
