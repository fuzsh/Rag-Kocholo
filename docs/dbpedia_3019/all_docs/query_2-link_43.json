However, although most observers generally consider civilian control over the military as a given reality in post-democratization Asia, recent political events indicate that new democracies are not quite free from armed forces’ political domination. The Thai military has recently staged a coup and removed the civilian leadership, while the notorious military junta in Myanmar has shown startling resilience to pressure from the international community. Less noticeably, Philippine politics have suffered from constant rumors and actual attempts of coups, while the Indonesian armed forces still enjoy political clout in the post-democratization period. Even relatively successful democratizers such as South Korea and Taiwan have struggled with depoliticizing praetorian soldiers during and after democratization. Despite different sociopolitical settings, armed forces in most Asian countries have played crucial roles in every stage of their political development—from state-building in the postWorld War II era to the period of democratic consolidation. Contemporary Asia features a variety of civil–military relations,1 ranging from (1) decades-long democratic control of the military in Japan, (2) recent democratizers with relatively stable civilian control of the armed forces in South Korea and Taiwan, (3) democratizers with weak and unstable control over the top brass in the Philippines and Indonesia, (4) control of the military by a one-party authoritarian state in China, Vietnam, and North Korea, and all the way to (5) the military’s political domination in Thailand and Myanmar. Except for Japan, most other East and Southeast Asian countries have experienced some type of military involvement in politics, either via a coup d’état and military dictatorship or junior partner of authoritarian civilian leadership. In these countries, the military as an institution has played significant roles in every stage of political development and decay, from the early state-building in the postwar period up to\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 1\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:22 PM\n\n2\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nthe current post-democratization era. One of the most crucial indicators of democratic consolidation in these countries is newly elected civilian leaders’ ability to claim constitutional authority over the armed forces and military officers’ political neutrality. This book conducts a comparative analysis of the armed forces’ political roles in four Asian countries: South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This book addresses important questions about the military’s political role in Asian contexts from the early years of the republics (1940s– 1950s) to contemporary post-democratization settings: What determines the armed forces’ political influence and how does it affect overall political development? How do democratically elected leaders depoliticize the armed forces and establish firm civilian control over them? Finally, what is the most desirable model of civilian oversight of the military in post-democratization Asian politics? These questions have attracted much scholarly attention in other regions, such as Southern Europe,2 Latin America,3 and post-communist Eastern Europe,4 and research on civil–military dynamics in these regions is already voluminous. Yet despite their prominent roles for decades, studies on Asian militaries have not produced theoretically rigorous and empirically rich products, as most have been confined to single case studies with little theoretical advancement.5 Previous work on Asian militaries suffers from a lack of rigorous factual analysis with multiple cross-country comparisons. Even multiple case works have been a mere collection of individual countries by different authors and, thus, are devoid of systemic comparison.6 Therefore, this book intends to take the study of Asian military’s political role one step further through a comparative analysis of four Asian countries: two countries in East Asia (i.e., South Korea and Taiwan) and two in Southeast Asia (i.e., the Philippines and Indonesia). Throughout the comparative analysis, the discussion focuses on how domestic and international security threats shape the military’s organizational character, doctrine, and domestic political roles at different stages of political development, suggesting that the presence of significant security threats increases the military’s overall power and role in domestic politics while a low level of threats hinders its intervention in politics. Each of the chapters in this book shows that high threats in either the domestic or international arena—or both—bring about the expansion of the armed forces’ organization and role expansion, creating favorable conditions for army officers to expand their political influence. At the same time, civilian leaders are tempted to mobilize top brass in the military into civilian politics because, when security threats are high, they have to rely on increasingly coercive means to secure both state security and regime security.\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 2\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:22 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n3\n\nConsequently, high security threats as a structural cause shape overall domestic political patterns in specific ways—namely, the weakening of democratic norms and practices and the outgrowth of authoritarian and oppressive state apparatus maintained by the support of the armed forces. By the same token, changes in security environments provide major domestic political actors with opportunities to reevaluate the military’s expansive political roles. The absence of imminent security threats strengthens the voice of pro-democracy groups vis-à-vis the authoritarian regime and the military, which explains why countries with benign security conditions experience more stable and thorough democratic regime transition with the military’s complete withdrawal from politics. The presence of high threats provides the military with political clout and hinders stable democratic transition. Given the condition of security threats as a primary structural cause, dynamic interactions of major domestic actors—civilian leadership, the military, and civil society—sculpt more complex and nuanced aspects of civil–military relations, ranging from the military’s political domination to subordination to civilian leadership. In general, the presence of a strong civilian leadership prevents the military from dominating politics. A cohesive and unified army results in the professionalization and depoliticization of military officers, while a factionalized military becomes highly politicized and prone to intervening in civilian politics. Finally, strong and ideologically moderate civil society groups strengthen democratic norms and practices and work against the military’s political intervention. The theory section of this chapter will discuss specific theoretical reasoning why this is the case.\n\nComparing Four Asian Countries This book carries out a structured-focused analysis of four Asian cases from their state-building period in the 1940s–1950s through contemporary postdemocratization politics. The method of structured-focused analysis has the advantage of sorting out, from numerous causal variables, key factors that have major influence on the dependent variable. At the same time, the structured-focused analysis makes it possible to apply the same set of research questions, variables, and measurements to the four cases under study. This method allows for the rigorous empirical testing of the presented theory.7 Paths of political developments in the four countries show interesting similarities and differences throughout different historical stages. Initially, the four countries embarked on the task of establishing sovereign statehood\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 3\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:22 PM\n\n4\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nat the end of World War II. During the process, they had to cope with severe internal and external security threats with the onset of Cold War confrontations and the expansion of communism throughout the Asian continent. Furthermore, the four countries reveal startling similarities in terms of the rise and fall of the military’s political roles. They all fought external and/or internal wars until they attained formal independence in the 1940s, during which the armed forces played roles as influential as their civilian counterparts. The countries also witnessed the armed forces’ rise as politically influential bodies in the 1960s–1970s. Finally, they moved on to democratization and the military’s depoliticization in the 1980s and 1990s (with Indonesia’s democratization coming a little later, in 1998). In sum, the four countries’ political developments reveal striking similarities throughout the second half of the twentieth century. In addition to the similarities in terms of the military’s political influence at different stages of political development, each case also demonstrates several noticeable distinctions at different historical stages. First, in terms of the security threats, South Korea and Taiwan mobilized enormous numbers of military forces to deal with both internal and external threats, while the Philippines and Indonesia had a relatively small number of military personnel during the state-building period (1940s–1950s). In the former cases, security challenges came from both domestic and international arenas whereas the latter cases dealt primarily with violence at home and insurgency movements. Second, South Korea (in 1961) and Indonesia (in 1965) experienced military coups and the installation of military dictatorial regimes. In contrast, the armed forces in Taiwan and the Philippines did not go through military dictatorship, but the top brass nevertheless participated in civilian political affairs under the guidance of authoritarian rulers. Third, the four countries pursued different paths of democratic regime transition. South Korea and Taiwan were successful democratizers, maintaining stable civilian control of the military, whereas democratization in the other two countries suffered from highly unstable regime transitions and politicized officers were unwilling to relinquish their political prerogatives. All in all, such similarities and differences present interesting questions. Exploring these civil–military interactions should deepen our understanding of political development and decay as well as the military’s role in this process. Throughout the comparative analyses of the four countries, explicit questions will be addressed. First, how did the armed forces in the four Asian countries come to acquire the ability to become dominant organizations and how did they evolve into highly politicized institutions? What factors\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 4\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n5\n\ncontributed to the military’s organizational and role expansion during the early years of the state-building? Certainly not every military had the capacity to overwhelm a civilian administration from the beginning; rather, many countries that achieved sovereign statehood had a small, poorly organized army in the early years of nation-building but later witnessed a vast increase in the manpower and organizational strength under specific circumstances. What brought about this dramatic change in many Asian militaries? The first empirical analysis of the book details the processes in which small and politically neutral armies turned into principal institutions that could overpower other sectors in societies. Second, once the armed forces rose to become predominant organizations that possessed the capacity to overwhelm civilian politics, why did some militaries overthrow civilian governments via coups d’état and establish military dictatorial rules while other militaries subordinated themselves under the guidance of authoritarian civilian leadership? To be more specific, what made officers in South Korea and Indonesia stage coups and install military dictatorships in the 1960s while the top brass in Taiwan and the Philippines remained under civilian authoritarian guidance during the same period? Although the military’s political influence was prevalent throughout the 1960s and 1970s across the four cases, notable differences also existed in the ways in which the army officers intervened in politics and authoritarian leaders exerted control mechanisms over the officers. The second part of the empirical work in this volume addresses the crescendo of the military’s political power via different routes. Third, what explains different modes of the military’s disengagement from politics during the democratic regime transitions of each of the four countries? Specifically, what factors encouraged or motivated the Korean and Taiwanese armies to willingly withdraw from politics and come under the firm control by newly elected democratic leaders without significant military repercussion? Conversely, politicized army officers in the Philippines and Indonesia were unwilling to withdraw from politics, thereby making the democratization highly unstable and incomplete. What determined army officers’ political orientation and behavior during democratization and how does this factor shape the post-democratization domestic politics? The third part of the empirical analysis in this book details the militaries’ political roles during democratization. The final set of questions deals with civil–military dynamics in the postdemocratization era. What are the major obstacles and opportunities each state faces in institutionalizing civilian authority over the military? How will\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 5\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\n6\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nthe armed forces’ influence shape the road to democratic consolidation? What will represent the most desirable model of civil–military relations in post-democratization Asian societies?\n\nConceptualizing the Military’s Political Influence The military’s role in domestic politics can take the form of numerous dimensions within civil–military interactions, ranging from the military’s political domination to its subordination to the civilian leadership. The classical and most widely used scheme has been the study of military coup d’état, military dictatorship, and the praetorian state. However, as numerous scholars have already pointed out, coup/no-coup scheme is too simple and narrow to encompass a wider spectrum and more nuanced aspects of whole civil–military dynamics. Zoltan Barany notes that “the armed forces’ political activism can take much more nuanced forms than coups d’état or the lack thereof and ought to be viewed as taking place along a continuum of multiple factors such as scale, means, and organizational prerogatives.”8 A more recent and widely accepted dimension of the military’s political influence involves examining civilian leaders’ abilities to impose their will on their armed servants9 ; its core indicator is “who prevails when civilian and military preferences diverge.”10 Civilian control over the armed forces is stable when the latter willingly follow civilian leaders’ orders—especially in foreign and security policy areas. However, although it is sufficiently broad, this scheme does not provide a specific classification of the entire spectrum of civil–military relations as the scheme is also dichotomous. Furthermore, the scheme has very limited utilities when applied to cases in which army officers remove civilian leadership and replace it with a military dictatorial regime. A more useful classification should have both sufficient width of spectrum from military domination to civilian rule and more specific and measurable categories of civil–military interactions within the entire spectrum. Some scholars have identified specific indicators of the military’s influence in political and policy areas. For example, Timothy Colton enumerates four policy domains of military officers’ preferences (internal, institutional, intermediate, and societal) and four methods of exercising their influence (official prerogative, expert advice, political bargaining, and force).11 However, a more widely used scheme has been Alfred Stepan’s conception of “military prerogatives” in 11 different political-policy areas, categorizing the military’s influence from low to high.12 First and foremost, the military’s political influence should be treated as a continuum between two extremes: from army officers’ political domination\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 6\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n7\n\nto their total subordination to civilian leadership. More specifically, it should cover a wide range of civil–military dynamics, from military coup and dictatorship, to a less significant but still important institutional role under authoritarian guidance, to an indirect but significant informal influence with a veto power in important political decisions, all the way to total subordination under democratic civilian leadership. By elaborating upon several scholars’ classification schemes for the civil–military spectrum,13 this book classifies the wide spectrum of civil–military dynamics into four distinct categories: control, participation, influence, and subordination. Control signifies the military’s political domination while subordination denotes civilian domination; participation and influence are located between the other two to denote more subtle and nuanced aspects of civil–military dynamics (see Figure 1.1). More specifically, control refers to a situation in which army officers stage a coup d’état, overthrow civilian leadership, and establish military dictatorship. Control also includes cases whereby military officers execute what Finer termed “quasi-civilianization,” in which coup leaders retire from the military and run for (in)direct/(non)competitive elections.14 The cases of South Korea (in 1961 and 1979) and Indonesia (in 1965) are illustrative examples of this category. Meanwhile, subordination signifies a situation in which the armed forces are a politically neutral institution controlled by a democratically elected civilian leadership, which is the case in postdemocratization South Korea and Taiwan. The military’s subordination to civilian leadership is possible when the democratically elected civilian leaders exercise institutional—not personal—control over the armed forces in important political and policy issues.15 Participation and influence are located between these two extremes. The armed forces may cross beyond their traditional role of defending the country against external threats and play an active and explicit political role as a junior partner or a guardian of authoritarian leadership, especially within administrative and law-enforcing areas (i.e., participation). Alternatively, army officers may stay outside the civilian political arena publicly, but exert significant informal influence over\n\nMilitary Domination\n\nControl\n\nParticipation\n\nCivilian Domination\n\nInfluence\n\nSubordination\n\nFigure 1.1 Spectrum of the Military’s Political Influence\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 7\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\n8\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nimportant political decision-making behind the scene (i.e., influence). Participation includes officers’ involvement in politics in the Philippines (1970s–1980s) and Taiwan (1950s–1980s) whereas influence signifies civil– military dynamics in contemporary post-democratization Indonesia and the Philippines. In measuring the armed forces’ domestic political influence, this book relies on two major dimensions of the military’s functions: “scope” and “jurisdiction.”16 Scope refers to the extent to which active or retired officers occupy important positions in the executive and legislative branches of the government. Jurisdiction refers to the military’s decision-making powers in important political and security issues. The military’s political influence is prevalent when its political presence is wide-ranging and when it possesses broad decision-making authority over not only the military and security areas, but also areas normally recognized as the civilian area of concern. Meanwhile, the military’s political influence is inconsequential when limited within its own institutional matters (i.e., protecting the country from outside predators). Multiple factors serve as specific indicators of the scope and jurisdiction, including (1) the number of active or retired military officers in key governmental positions (especially executive and legislative branches); (2) civilian leaders’ decision-making authority in important government policies, especially in foreign and security affairs; (3) the military’s compliance with civilian leaders’ decisions on key security policy implementations, including military deployment; and (4) the armed forces’ self-definition of primary missions, whether externally or internally oriented and whether securityrelated missions or nonsecurity/nonmilitary missions. Furthermore, civilian control of the military involves not only an objective control mechanism by the executive head, but also supervision and scrutiny by the legislative body. Therefore, oversight of the legislative branch in important security and military-related policy-making is also a critical indicator of democratic control of the military.17\n\nSecurity Threats and the Military: A Theoretical Argument Much of the existing literature on civil–military relations has focused on the problem of praetorianism, coup d’état, and military dictatorial rule in developing areas. Moreover, when dealing with the problem of armed forces’ intervention in politics, scholars tend to rely on narrowly conceived institutionalist perspectives.18 This institutionalist body of literature can be grouped into three major theoretical clusters emanating from the 1960s and 1970s\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 8\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n9\n\nliterature: the “developmental” approach, the “military-centric” approach, and the “synthetic” approach.19 These different strands examine military factors (personal ambitions, factional struggles, organizational character, corporate interests),20 civilian factors (civilian leadership failure and sociopolitical crisis),21 or both (concurrence of “disposition” and “opportunity,” or “push factors” and “pull factors”) to explain army officers’ involvement in politics.22 Despite notable differences in their theoretical arguments, each of the institutionalist perspectives shares one theoretical premise in common: explaining the military’s political influence as a function of domestic political dynamics without seriously considering broader contexts of security threats. This point is more prominent in the study of Asian militaries than of any other region as Asian military specialists have focused on Huntington’s notion of subjective and objective civilian control.23 Such an omission is problematic because the military is first and foremost a security institution that directly responds to domestic and international security challenges. Consequently, changes in security conditions should also bring about changes in the military’s organizational character, doctrine, and domestic political roles. Yet institutionalist theories of civil– military relations simply assume as given the presence of well-organized military forces that can easily overwhelm civilian political power whenever they are willing. This dominant idea is well expressed in what Peter Feaver called the “civil–military problematique,” which is a simple paradox: “the very institution created to protect the polity is given sufficient power to become a threat to the polity.”24 In other words, institutional theories begin from an assumption that any society has strong and well-organized armed forces, which raises the problem of the military’s political domination when certain domestic conditions are met. However, historically speaking, not all military organizations have been strong enough to dominate society from the early years of state-building. South Korea and the Philippines, for instance, used to have very small militaries in the 1940s, but subsequently experienced vast organizational and role expansion through the experiences of internal and external security challenges, including interstate war and domestic insurgency movements. Thus, in many developing countries, a predominant military institution should not be assumed as a given, but one that expands in size and strength under the condition of high security threats. In this respect, Michael Desch’s approach to the military’s political roles in changing security environments provides a fresh approach to the topic.25 Desch encapsulates long-established arguments about security threats and civil–military relations, suggesting that a state with low internal and high external threats has the most desirable civilian control over the military.\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 9\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\n10\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nAccording to Desch, when external threats are high, civilian leadership may become more experienced and knowledgeable about security issues. Moreover, high security threats will bring about a “rally around the flag” effect among the general public so that civilian leadership becomes stronger. Conversely, he predicts that a state with high internal and low external threats will have the weakest civilian control of the armed forces. In this situation, civilian leadership will be weak, divided, and inexperienced in national security affairs—a structural condition that can easily lead to military intervention in politics as the armed forces focus on internal security and nonmilitary missions.26 Alfred Stepan concurs with Desch, presenting a similar argument in his discussion of the military’s “new professionalism,” in which army officers consider the internal security role to be their primary mission.27 The major concern for both Stepan and Desch is the presence of internal security threats and their influence on the military’s role expansion into nonmilitary areas. However, the aforementioned causal mechanism—especially high external/low internal threats and firm civilian control—is not convincing enough and thus requires additional critical assessment. One should be critical about Desch’s causal mechanism for several reasons. The first direct outcome of the presence of high external threats is the expansion of the military organization. When a state faces outside threats, the military consumes a large portion of its domestic resources at the expense of other sectors, making the armed forces the best organized and trained group in society. As Harold Lasswell points out, continuing external threats and war conditions create “garrison states” in which militaries specialized in violence become the most powerful groups in society.28 Furthermore, high threats are detrimental to democratic norms and practices, as initially democratically elected civilian leaders rely on more coercive tactics to govern society. In turn, people are willing to suffer under a Leviathan-like oppressive regime when their survival is in grave danger. Consequently, high security threats bring about an expansion of a coercive military organization, more authoritarian civilian leadership, and an invitation of army officers to join the political realm by civilian leaders for state and regime security. On the contrary, an absence of serious security threats empowers civil society and pro-democracy groups vis-à-vis the authoritarian regime and politicized military, thereby putting the authoritarian regime into a defensive position. In sum, this causal logic is at odds with Desch’s arguments, suggesting that high threats lead to the presence of a politically influential military whereas low threats lead to a politically inconsequential army.\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 10\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n11\n\nSecurity Threats and the Military This section develops a structural theory of civil–military relations that has a two-stage causal argument. First, security threats as a structural cause shape political opportunities, incentives, and relative power positions of major domestic actors—namely, civilian leadership, the military, and civil society. Second, dynamic interactions among the domestic actors serve as structural modifiers that determine a more specific and nuanced aspect of civil–military dynamics (see Figure 1.2). The primary independent variable in this book is security threats, which can be either external or internal in origin and either high or low in severity. However, the term security threats is highly elusive and difficult to measure as it consists of not only a tangible threatening actor (both state and nonstate actors in both domestic and international arenas), but also civilian leaders’ or high-ranking officers’ perceptions of a threat. At the same time, civilian leaders or the top brass in the military can manipulate or exaggerate the threat perception for their domestic political purposes. Therefore, to measure security threats, the discussion herein examines individual countries’ historical records of international war, small-scale conflicts, and domestic insurgents and guerrilla warfare. Furthermore, the investigation examines more specific historical contexts and the qualitative severity of security threats that each state faced. The perception of key political actors—whether civilian or military leaders—is also considered. However, the empirical chapters of this book will focus more on the factual information about the existence of threats in both domestic and international arenas. High security threats, either in the domestic or international arena, may generate a structural condition for the military to be politically influential whereas low threats work against its political influence. As Samuel Finer has suggested, internal or external war conditions are “among the circumstances that may provide the military with opportunities for intervention”29 and\n\nSecurity Threats\n\n(Independent)\n\nMilitary Organization Civilian Leadership Civil Society (Intervening)\n\nMilitary’s Political Influence\n\n(Dependent)\n\nFigure 1.2 Summary of Causal Connections\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 11\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\n12\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\ndominance of domestic politics because the military is first and foremost a security institution that exists primarily “to protect the interest of one political group against the predation of others.”30 As the armed forces are a security institution created to protect the country from external attack, mounting security challenges will inevitably bring about the military’s organizational and role expansion. More specifically, high security threats produce politically influential militaries for several reasons. The first immediate effect of severe threats is the expansion of the military organization. As previously mentioned, existing literature on civil–military relations simply assumes the presence of a military institution that has the organizational capacity to overwhelm civilian politics. However, historical experiences suggest that not all newborn countries possessed strong armed forces that could dominate society from the beginning of the state-building process. Rather, most of these states witnessed the vast expansion of military organizations in the face of extreme threat conditions and the experience of war—or at least the constant threat of war and domestic insurgency. Thus, the presence of predominant army organizations cannot be a given condition for all societies, but rather an outcome subsequently shaped by security environments in the context of Cold War confrontations. In addition to organizational expansion, high threats—especially the experience of interstate conflict or domestic counterinsurgencies—sculpt army officers’ political beliefs that the military is the only institution that truly represents and defends the interest of the people. Such a belief is reinforced when civilian leadership fails to provide political order or undergoes factional-partisan infighting. The political voice of the military’s top brass is strongest in countries in which the armed forces are deeply engaged in the state-building process. The political role of the Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia (ABRI; Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces) clearly illustrates this point. The ABRI developed into a strong organization during the independence war with Dutch forces (1945–1949) and assumed key administrative roles because the civilian government was barely functioning. The ABRI’s role during state-building led the army leadership to declare the dwifungsi (dual function) doctrine in the 1960s, which codified the military’s role not only in defense and security areas, but also in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government as an equal partner of civilian leadership.31 Furthermore, high security threats give civilian leaders structural incentives and opportunities to become more authoritarian and take coercive measures to rule society. Deteriorating national security conditions also\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 12\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n13\n\nserve as a threat to the regime security of civilian leadership. In this condition, civilian leaders consider the armed forces to be the most attractive strategic partner in securing both regime security and state security. Civilian leaders find it easier to mobilize officers into politics in order to expand their political power when society faces severe threats, whether domestically or internationally. This is particularly conceivable as the military’s popularity among the general public rises when it is engaged in armed conflicts with either domestic insurgencies or foreign aggressors. Therefore, the direct outcome of rising security threats is installation of authoritarian regime and politicization of the military at the civilian leaders’ invitation. Finally, in this situation, civil society’s influence in domestic politics becomes inconsequential. As previously discussed, one of the most prominent outcomes of unfavorable security conditions is the expansion and strengthening of the state apparatus that monopolizes the means of physical violence. High threats shift the power balance to favor the state apparatus over civil society. Worse yet, active or sometimes physically violent civil movements can aggravate domestic security conditions further, thereby providing authoritarian leaders with justification to bring the armed forces into the domestic politics in order to restore order. This vicious cycle of interaction is highly probable because civil society groups often adopt radical and physically violent tactics in response to civilian leaders’ oppressive rule. Thus, domestic disturbances with violent interactions between the government and civil society provide the military with the opportunity and justification to intervene and install a military dictatorial regime. On the other hand, the decline of security threats provides structural circumstances for a state to reevaluate the military’s role in politics and security policymaking. More specifically, a low level of external and internal security threats creates few structural imperatives and incentives for military officers to intervene in politics. In addition, any civilian leader’s attempt to mobilize the army into politics under these circumstances would be extremely difficult to justify and would generally face harsh resistance from domestic audiences. Meanwhile, the power balance between the state and society favors the civil society when no serious security challenge exists. Furthermore, civil society groups’ pressure against authoritarian civilian leadership continues to be more influential. In sum, high security threats in both domestic and international arenas cause the military to be a politically influential organization whereas low threats render politicized army officers less influential, leading to a stronger civilian control of the military. Security threats’ influence on three major domestic actors is summarized in Figure 1.3.\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 13\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\n14\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nHigh\n\nStrong military presence in politics Authoritarian civilian leadership Extension of coercive state apparatus\n\nLow\n\nWeak military presence in politics Pressure against authoritarian rule Active pro-democracy movements\n\nSecurity Threats\n\nFigure 1.3 Security Threats and Major Domestic Actors\n\nStructural Modifiers Although the previous discussion illustrates a generalized pattern of the rise and fall of the military’s political influence, it does not account for specific manifestations of its political engagement and withdrawal. That is to say, these structural conditions themselves cannot explain or predict different types of military involvement in politics—namely, subordination, influence, participation, or domination. For a structural theory to have explanatory power, other domestic variables as structural modifiers should also be considered. More specifically, three intervening variables at the domestic level—namely, the strength of civilian leadership, military cohesiveness, and civil society—explain the different modes of military involvement in and withdrawal from politics. Dynamic interactions among the major political actors shape specific manifestations of the military’s political role in different stages of political development. The first intervening variable at the domestic level is the strength of civilian leadership. The pattern of civilian leadership is the most crucial intervening variable, determining the ways in which the military both becomes involved in and withdraws from civilian politics. The structural condition of high threats renders the military the most effectively organized and trained organ in society, and civilian leaders mobilize officers into politics to deal with both state and regime security. Once army officers enter the political arena via civilian leaders’ mobilization, it is the strength of civilian leadership that determines the modes of the military’s engagement in politics. In other words, the military is likely to stage a coup d’état and dominate politics if civilian leadership loses its legitimacy or fails to maintain domestic security and political order. Given the presence of politically active officers, the existence of crisis situations or a power-vacuum in the ruling circle makes a military coup highly probable. On the other hand, politicized officers will remain under civilian guidance if civilian leaders exert strong leadership.\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 14\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n15\n\nThe strength of civilian leadership also accompanies different modes of the military’s withdrawal from politics during democratization. The process of military withdrawal is highly unstable and incomplete when newly elected civilian leaders suffer from weak and divided leadership, fail to maintain political and security order, or simply lack support from pro-democracy groups in civil society. When civilian leadership is divided, weak, or perceived as illegitimate, military officers are unwilling to withdraw from politics and instead try to exert significant political influence—even after formally disengaging from politics. On the other hand, unified and strong civilian leadership that garners support from civil society encourages the military’s complete disengagement from politics, resulting in more stable and complete democratization as well as the military’s depoliticization. The second intervening variable is the military’s organizational cohesiveness through which structural influences are modified. A unified and cohesive army is conducive to stable civilian control and promotes military professionalism and its institutional autonomy.32 Civilian leaders find it easier to monitor and control the armed forces when the military retains organizational unity with an effective hierarchical command structure.33 However, a factionalized military creates two primary problems for civilian leaders: monitoring/sanctioning problems and factional groups’ aspiration for political hegemony.34 In a factionalized army, officers’ allegiance is directed not toward their civilian masters, but toward their own factional leaders. Furthermore, interorganizational/interservice struggles, hometown/school loyalties, and interethnic rivalries can all create competitions within the military and promote its political intervention.35 Consequently, civilian leaders find it hard to control army officers when army leadership is engaged in such factional competition. The final intervening variable is the strength of civil society. Generally speaking, a strong and vibrant civil society functions as a deterrent to a military role in domestic politics. However, civil society may encourage a stronger presence of the military in politics, depending on the security threats and the strategy and ideology that civil society groups adopt. In times of high threats, the existence of a strong civil society itself may invite the armed forces into politics, especially when civil groups advocate for a radical ideology or adopt a strategy of physical violence, engendering sociopolitical chaos. Meanwhile, in times of low threats, civil society deters the military’s political engagement when the former is ideologically moderate and adopts a nonviolent strategy for democratic reforms. At the same time, it is vital for newly elected civilian leaders during democratization to align with—and garner support from—pro-democracy civil groups.\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 15\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\n16\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nExpected Outcomes As presented, the structural theory has a two-stage causal connection. In the first stage, security threats determine the military’s relative influence in domestic politics, as noted in Table 1.1. Civilian control is strongest and the military’s political influence is minimal under the structural condition of low internal and external threats (Q4). Meanwhile, high internal and external threats bring about the worst civilian control of the military (Q1). To a lesser extent, a high level of security threats either in the domestic or international arena also stimulates a stronger political influence of the military (Q2 and Q3). These expected outcomes are exactly opposite of Michael Desch’s hypotheses. Although security threats in the domestic and international arenas determine the military’s relative influence in domestic politics, the dynamic interactions among major domestic actors—namely, civilian leadership, the military, and civil society—are responsible for more detailed and nuanced manifestations of the military’s domestic political role. A combination of strong civilian leadership (backed by strong civil society) and unified military organization leads to firm civilian control of the military. However, weak civilian leadership combined with a factionalized military breeds a potential coup d’état and a military domination of politics, especially when society faces grave security threats. The same domestic condition can lead to weak civilian control of the military, but a low probability of a military coup when threats are low.\n\nTable 1.1 Security Threats and the Military’s Political Influence High External Threats\n\nLow External Threats\n\nHigh Internal Threats\n\nWorst Civilian Control (Q1)\n\nHigh Military Influence (Q2)\n\nLow Internal Threats\n\nHigh Military Influence (Q3)\n\nFirm Civilian Control (Q4)\n\nA Roadmap to This Volume The organization of this book is unique in that it differs from other edited volumes on Asian civil–military relations that simply catalog individual cases in different chapters. Each chapter of this volume is organized to compare all four cases at four different historical junctures, from the state-building\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 16\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n17\n\nthrough current post-democratization era. In this way, this book carries out a more rigorous comparative analysis across the countries under study. The following chapters consist of a comparative analysis of four countries at four historical stages of civil–military relations. The four empirical chapters represent four distinct historical stages in terms of the military’s political (dis)engagement: (1) the armed forces’ role during the state-building period (1940s–1950s); (2) dynamics of the military’s intervention in politics (1960s–1970s); (3) democratization and depoliticization of the armed forces (1980s–1990s); and (4) the building of democratic armies in postdemocratization political settings (current). Chapter Two explores how domestic and international security challenges during the state-building period shaped the armed forces’ organizational structures and doctrines. All of the cases, apart from the Philippines, were forced to deal with overwhelming security challenges in light of the Cold War’s military and ideological confrontations in the early years of statebuilding. For example, South Korea fought the Korean War (1950–1953) and faced subsequent North Korean threats. The Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC, or Taiwan) lost its civil war (1945–1949) with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and, after moving to Taiwan, faced even more daunting threats from the mainland Communists. Indonesia fought independence war with Dutch forces (1945–1949) and subsequently struggled with constant threats of national disintegration due to Islamist groups’ rebellions throughout the archipelago. In all three cases, the first direct outcome of the security challenges was the expansion of the military organization. And these emergent democratic regimes did not last long as they degenerated into authoritarianism. In this process, authoritarian civilian leaders mobilized the armed forces into the civilian political arena to strengthen both national security and regime security. Meanwhile, the Philippines enjoyed favorable security environments during the state-building years, largely due to its geographic isolation from the Asian continent as well as an American security commitment. Until Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, the Filipino political system was one of the most democratic among Asian countries, and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) remained small in size, politically neutral, and under civilian control. Chapter Three explains how, once invited into politics by authoritarian leaders, the armed forces intervened in politics—either via coup d’état and military dictatorship (domination) or as the junior partner of authoritarian civilian leadership (participation) during the 1960s and 1970s. This chapter explicates how dynamic interactions among major domestic actors (i.e., civilian leadership, the military, and civil society) produced different modes\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 17\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\n18\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nof military intervention in politics. The politically active officers staged coups and dominated the political arena when three major conditions concurred in South Korea and Indonesia: extremely high security threats, failed civilian leadership, and factionalized armed forces. Meanwhile, Taiwanese and Filipino officers did not stage coups; rather, they participated in politics under civilian guidance when they had strong civilian leadership and unified military institutions. Empirical evidence from this chapter demonstrates that the strength of civilian leadership is the most important factor for preventing military coup d’état. Furthermore, military organizations that suffer from factional struggles breed officers’ political ambitions whereas unified armies promote military professionalism and do not attempt to dominate the civilian political arena. Chapter Four focuses on the dynamics of the military’s withdrawal from politics during democratization (1980s–1990s). This chapter illustrates how changing security threats in the 1980s reshaped the relative power positions and political incentives of major domestic political actors (i.e., civilian leadership, the military, and civil society) to determine democratization and the army’s depoliticization processes. Decreasing security threats as a structural cause initially enabled domestic political actors to reevaluate the armed forces’ political roles, precipitating democratization movements such as those in South Korea and Taiwan. In these two cases, a combination of strong civilian leadership and unified armed forces brought stable and far-reaching democratization. However, the other two cases under study suffered from mounting domestic security challenges—namely, communist revolts and Muslim separatist movements in the Philippines as well as Muslim independence movements and communal violence in Indonesia. Worsening internal security conditions provided the armed forces with justification for their political influence, thereby making democratization and the military’s depoliticization highly unstable and incomplete. In addition, two domestic factors—a weak/divided civilian leadership and factionalized armies— made military officers unwilling to withdraw from politics even after democratization. Chapter Five illustrates civil–military dynamics in four cases in the post-democratization era. This chapter explains how South Korea and Taiwan have been more successful in establishing firm civilian control of the military and consolidating democracy than Indonesia and the Philippines. In the latter two cases, continuing domestic security challenges have posed barriers to establishing democratic control of the military. This chapter also illustrates that reorganizing the armed forces into a unified and cohesive institution is vital for making the armed forces professional and politically\n\nJWoo_01_Final.indd 18\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:23 PM\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND THE MILITARY IN EAST ASIA\n\n19\n\nneutral. Finally, this chapter considers how the armed forces’ political influence in these Asian countries will shape the road to democratic consolidation in the near future. The conclusion brings together analytical findings from the four empirical chapters to provide support for and elaboration upon the theoretical arguments. The empirical findings demonstrate that a predominant body of institutionalist literature has limited theoretical utility in explaining the entire spectrum of civil–military interactions, from the military’s political domination to stable civilian control. In addition, the empirical evidence effectively invalidates the conventional wisdom purporting to claim that high threats produce stable civilian control of the military. Instead, this book concludes that high threats bring about the expansion of the military organization, an increasingly authoritarian civilian leadership, and the politicization of the armed forces. Based on these theoretical insights and empirical evidence, the book concludes with relevant empirical and policy implications for the future of civil–military relations in these Asian countries.\n\nNotes 1 For a recent comprehensive overview of civil–military relations in Asian context, see Muthiah Alagappa, ed., Coercion and Governance: The Declining Political Role of the Military in Asia (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001). 2 Hans Born, et al., Civil–Military Relations in Europe: Learning from Crisis and Institutional Change (New York: Routledge, 2009); Jurgen Kuhlmann and Jean Callaghan, eds, Military and Society in 21st Century Europe: A Comparative Analysis (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 2001); Thanos Veremis, The Military in Greek Politics (London: Hurst & Company, 1997); Guillermo O’Donnell, Philippe C.

Firm civilian control over the military is also possible in nondemocratic regimes. Authoritarian leaders’ control, however, is possible only by politicizing the top brass in the military. Huntington’s notion of “subjective control” clearly characterizes civilian control over the military in an authoritarian political setting. In subjective control, civilian leadership controls army officers by politicizing them. Samuel P.

Both during and after the war, all four countries that this book compares—namely, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia—experienced some type of war and conflict, as evidenced by Korea’s independence war with Japan and the Korean War, civil war on the Chinese mainland, the Philippines’ war with Japan, and Indonesia’s independence war with the Dutch colonial forces. These newborn nations further became the focal points of military and ideological confrontations throughout the Cold War years. Such security challenges during state-building years had tremendous impacts on the nature of the power of civilian political leaders and the military’s organizational and doctrinal characters. This chapter explores how domestic and international security threats encroached upon the nature of civil–military relations during the state-building period in the four Asian nations. The structural theory of civil–military relations detailed in the previous chapter suggested that internal and external threats affect the military’s relative influence vis-à-vis other sectors in the domestic political space. Security threats influence both the armed forces and civilian leadership. Specifically, the presence of high threats brings about the expansion of the military organization to the detriment of other domestic sectors, as a large portion of domestic resources are allocated to the armed forces. In the civilian political segment, high threats result in the centralization of political power within one or a small number of political leaders—usually the head of the executive branch. Meanwhile, civilian leaders reverse democratic norms and practices to become authoritarian rulers who take coercive measures to safeguard both the regime’s security and the state’s security. When security threats are high, political leaders find it expedient to mobilize the top brass in the army into civilian politics for their political purposes. Thus, the apparent outcome of the presence of high threats is the military’s organizational and role expansion, authoritarian civilian leadership, and army officers’ influence in civilian politics. This chapter explores how security threats during the early years of state-building led to the expansion of the military organization and its role\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 23\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:12 PM\n\n24\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nexpansion in four Asian countries. These four countries faced mounting security challenges with the onset of the Cold War, although the origin and nature of the security threats differed from country to country. For example, South Korea and Taiwan suffered from severe threats both domestically and internationally due to the presence of the communist regimes in North Korea and mainland China, respectively. Meanwhile, Indonesia faced difficulties in establishing a centralized sovereign statehood due to sociopolitical cleavages along religious, ethnic, and geographic constellations. Only the Philippines benefited from favorable security environments during the time of independence up until the late 1960s, when Maoist communist insurgencies and Muslim separatist movements surged, posing threats to the central government. All in all, variations in the nature and origin of security threats resulted in somewhat different patterns of political development across the four cases. This chapter is composed of four major sections. The following section examines the security threats and the rise of the Korean army as a politically powerful institution in South Korea from the late 1940s to the late 1950s, when the first civilian president, Rhee Syngman, was forced to step down. The second section explores the role of the armed forces of the Republic of China on Taiwan (hereafter, Taiwan) during the civil war on the mainland and after the retreat to Formosa Island in 1949. The third section discusses political roles of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) as it grew from a politically neutral institution in the 1940s and 1950s to a highly politicized body under the Marcos presidency in the late 1960s and 1970s. Finally, the fourth section examines Indonesian armed forces’ political roles from the years of the independence war in the 1940s through Sukarno’s Guided Democracy in the late 1950s.\n\nI. State-Building and the Army in South Korea Liberation of Korea The conclusion of the Pacific War in 1945 resulted in the liberation of the Korean peninsula from 35 years of Japanese colonial rule. However, the newly independent territory soon became a focal point in a worldwide military and ideological confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in East Asia. The two superpowers divided the Korean peninsula for temporary military occupation along the 38th parallel. On September 12, 1945, the U.S. armed forces established the Army Military Government in the southern part of the peninsula to rule the territory until the newly elected South Korean government took over political authority. Ultimately, the\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 24\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:12 PM\n\nSTATEBUILDING AND ARMYBUILDING\n\n25\n\nallegedly temporary occupation by the two superpowers resulted in the establishment of two permanent sovereign entities in Korea. General elections for the National Assembly in 1948 founded the Republic of Korea (ROK) (hereafter, South Korea) in the southern part,1 while the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) (hereafter, North Korea) was declared in September of the same year.2 In South Korea, the National Assembly elected the first president, Rhee Syngman, one of the prominent leaders of the independence movements during the Japanese occupation period. President Rhee represented the conservative elements in society and was the United States’ favorite due to his position of staunch anticommunism. South Korea’s defense force was created during the American occupation period (1945–1948). During this time, the U.S. military opened the first military training school, offering courses in English language and basic military skills to help facilitate the operations of the military government in Korea. This Military English Language Institute was subsequently replaced by the South Korean National Defense Officers Training Academy in 1946, which in turn was reorganized into the Korean Military Academy in 1948.3 Through this army-building process in South Korea, the United States significantly impacted the country’s military organization, training, and overall political orientation. The Korean armed forces were small in size— approximately 50,000 men—in the first year of the Republic. Moreover, military officers were not openly involved in politics, but remained politically neutral, as the Constitution prohibited active military personnel from assuming the post of the prime minister or a minister in the government. However, the Korean army soon witnessed an unprecedented organizational expansion through the end of the Korean War in 1953. Security Challenges and the Korean Army The state-building period involved severe security threats for South Korea, both internally and externally. Only two months after the South Korean government was established, North Korean guerrilla forces and antigovernment insurgents adhering to communist ideology began to infiltrate into South Korea’s territory, organizing and supporting pro-communist guerrillas and impoverished citizenry to engage in violent uprisings in major cities as well as peasants in the rural areas in the context of socioeconomic chaos.4 One such incident occurred in October 1948, when a South Korean constabulary regiment, indoctrinated by communist ideology, revolted against the government and occupied the cities of Yosu, Sunchon, and several towns located in the southwestern part of the Korean peninsula. Although the Korean army put down the insurrection, hundreds of guerrilla forces\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 25\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:12 PM\n\n26\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nescaped into the mountains to continue the guerrilla war. One month after the incident, another revolt by a constabulary force took place in Daegu City, in southeastern Korea. Although military units quickly suppressed these insurrections by the Korean constabulary forces, the incidents revealed that guerrilla forces were already posing serious threats to the newborn government in South Korea. These guerrilla incidents forced the Rhee Syngman government to adopt strong anticommunist schemes. Immediately after these insurrections, the National Assembly acted swiftly to pass the National Security Law. Article 1 of this law called for defending “the national security and interests” from the enemy of the state, which the law defined as “any association, groups, or organizations” that plotted against the state.5 The law was initially applied against the South Korean Labor Party and other pro-communist groups; however, the Rhee regime later used it to suppress any political opposition activities, including opposition political leaders, religious organizations, labor unions, student movements, and newspapers. In sum, domestic security threats that emerged from the beginning of the republic enabled the democratically elected Rhee government to become increasingly authoritarian and take coercive measures to govern the country. In addition to the threats from the domestic insurgency movements, changes in external security environments gave rise to even more challenges to the newborn country, stemming from the expansion of communism throughout East Asia. In mainland China, Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang (KMT) government lost the civil war with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. Victorious Mao Tse-tung and the CCP proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on the mainland, which created grave concerns for the Rhee government. To make matters worse, the United States National Security Council decided to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea as early as April 1948. By June 1949, the United States had almost completely pulled its armed forces from South Korea, leaving only the Provisional Military Advisory Group to the Republic of Korea, with approximately 500 personnel.6 The withdrawal of the American military forces, coupled with Chinese communization, served to deteriorate South Korea’s security environment significantly. Yet it was the Korean War that brought significant changes to the political topography in general as well as specific organizational and doctrinal characteristics of the armed forces and their domestic political roles. As early as 1949, both Koreas were launching military attacks and counterattacks along the borders. While the military confrontations were swelling, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson gave a speech that signified the United States’ defense perimeter in Asia.7 The containment line excluded South Korea\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 26\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:12 PM\n\nSTATEBUILDING AND ARMYBUILDING\n\n27\n\nand Taiwan. As a result, after Acheson’s defensive perimeter speech, Joseph Stalin gave permission to North Korean leader Kim Il-sung to attack South Korea. With the approval from both Stalin and Mao and with all American forces already withdrawn from South Korea, North Korean forces embarked on a massive attack upon South Korea on June 25, 1950. Although the South Korean armed forces already numbered slightly more than 100,000 at the outbreak of the war, they were so poorly trained and equipped that North Korean forces occupied Seoul—the capital city—within just three days of the initiation of the war. Korean society made tremendous sacrifices during the war, which resulted in the deaths of three million people—roughly 10 percent of the total population of the two Koreas.8 The Korean War ended with no clear victor, but rather an agreement of armistice, formally concluded between the United Nations Command (UNC) and the communists on July 27, 1953. Although the armistice agreement did bring a precarious peace to the peninsula, it also continued to aggravate the military and ideological confrontation between the two Koreas. The first direct outcome of the Korean War was the expansion of the military organization and its political roles.9 The war resulted in a massive expansion of military institutions in South Korea. During the state-building period of 1948, the South Korean defense forces numbered approximately 50,000 men. Even at the beginning of the war in 1950, this number amounted to a little more than 100,000 of poorly equipped and trained forces.10 However, the war forced the country to move toward total mobilization of domestic resources for military buildup. At the conclusion of the war, South Korea had armed forces amounting to 700,000 of heavily armed and trained personnel. Consequently, the South Korean army had developed into the best-organized and funded state institution, consuming over a half of total governmental expenditures throughout the 1950s.11 During this military buildup process, the United States became the army’s most crucial supporter and builder. Immediately after the armistice agreement was signed on October 1, 1953, South Korea and the United States signed a Mutual Defense Treaty, culminating in American military assistance totaling nearly $6 billion from 1950 to 1979—the equivalent of almost 80 percent of South Korean defense spending and 10 percent of the country’s gross national product (GNP) during this period.12 President Rhee Syngman and the Military In addition to the organizational expansion of the armed forces, three years of war left the democratically elected President Rhee as an almost\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 27\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:12 PM\n\n28\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nomnipotent figure in postwar Korean politics. During the war, Rhee strengthened his political position and centralized political power by revising the constitution and terrorizing opposition political forces. Through such efforts, the president mobilized the military for his political ambitions. The war and continuing threats from North Korea fostered the preoccupation of military officers as well as the general public with a strong conservative and anticommunist ideology. In centralizing its political power, the Rhee regime actively exploited the communist threat from North Korea and anticommunist ideology, satisfying two important political purposes. First, in domestic politics, the threat perception and antagonism against communist North Korea bred a “rally around the flag” effect that unified the general public and the military under the Rhee leadership, which served to justify the centralization of political power in his hands. Due to continuing threats from North Korea, South Korean society showed little antipathy to Rhee’s increasingly authoritarian rule. Second, in international political realms, Rhee’s staunch anticommunist position helped ensure continuous American military and economic support throughout his rule. The United States needed a prominent and symbolic political leader who had experience in leading the independence war against Japanese colonial forces and therefore had a high regard among the general public. At the same time, the leader was supposed to have a strong anticommunist ideology in order to support the American grand strategy in East Asia. Rhee satisfied all these qualifications, thereby enabling him to gain continued support from the United States even when he became an authoritarian leader in South Korea. The first momentum of strengthening Rhee’s political power came during the 1952 presidential election, when the Rhee government attempted to revise the 1948 Constitution so that the president was elected through popular referendum, not by the National Assembly vote. Rhee wanted to revise the Constitution to include a popular election for two reasons. First, he did not have a broad support base within the National Assembly—even within his own political party. Second, he had developed a hostile relationship with the National Assembly from the beginning of the government formation in 1948 due to differences in the form of government. Most legislators favored a cabinet political system, whereas Rhee pursued a strong presidential system. Given this hostile relationship, Rhee was certain to fail in the presidential election. When the bill for constitutional amendment was proposed, it was overwhelmingly rejected in the National Assembly vote, as expected. Rhee subsequently pressured the National Assembly by organizing the general public into anti-National Assembly demonstrations\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 28\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:12 PM\n\nSTATEBUILDING AND ARMYBUILDING\n\n29\n\nand adopting various other tactics of physical terror to intimidate the opposition Assemblymen. The Rhee government turned to more heavy-handed tactics against the opposition Assemblymen after the president failed to amend the constitution in his initial attempts. On May 15, 1952, Rhee declared martial law in the Busan area, the temporary capital during the war, claiming that communist guerrillas had penetrated the area and threatened to overthrow the government. He used the military police to arrest 50 Assemblymen for allegedly receiving political bribes from the communist groups. With the military forces and the police encircling the National Assembly building, Rhee successfully forced the National Assembly to pass the constitutional amendment for popular presidential election. Following a new constitution and electoral systems, Rhee was elected as president for the second time in the August 1952 presidential election, winning about five million votes (74 percent of the total votes). He kept hold of his presidency by using the military to suppress opposition political leaders, going so far as to move two army divisions to the Busan area even during a time of war. Worse yet, the constitutional amendment set a precedent for subsequent political leaders to revise the constitution based on their political expediency. The forced constitutional amendment in 1952 created tensions between the president and the top brass in the army, as a number of high-ranking officers opposed mobilizing the armed forces for the president’s political ambitions. Leadership in the Korean army was divided over the issue of active military officers’ political participation. One group of officers led by General Lee Jong-chan wanted the armed forces to maintain strict political neutrality. They opposed the politicization of the officer corps and the president’s use of them. Another group of officers that included Park Jung-hee yearned for deeper political involvement to overthrow the corrupt civilian government and establish a more efficient military dictatorial regime. Despite the differences between the two groups of the officer corps, these officers shared an important commonality: They began to openly express their own political attitudes. The growing political activism among younger officers eventually manifested as a coup d’état in 1961 when the civilian leadership lost political control.13 As the president witnessed military officers’ growing political activism and influence, Rhee felt he needed to build a mechanism to control them. In doing so, he relied on two strategies: his personal charisma and his political skill in manipulating factional struggles in the military. Rhee earned respect from both the general public and the military for his leadership of the independence movement during the Japanese rule. Indeed, he spent\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 29\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:12 PM\n\n30\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\n30 years in exile in the United States and became the first president of the Korean Provisional Government while in exile. He was the only man with enough personal charisma to control high-ranking officers. Rhee further strengthened his authority over the military by circulating key positions within the army to secure his personal control over the highest-ranking officers. He removed uncooperative officers from the army leadership, such as Generals Lee Jong-chan and Choi Kyong-rok, who opposed Rhee’s mobilization of the armed forces for his political ambition. Moreover, Rhee created a new military police unit within the Department of Defense in order to oversee not only the entire armed forces, but also civilian politicians.14 Throughout the 1950s, all the key positions within the military were determined by Rhee’s political expediency. Factional Struggles in the Armed Forces Most importantly, Rhee astutely exploited the factional struggles within the armed forces. Since the inception of the Republic, the South Korean army was organized into several distinctive groups according to their prior experiences under the Japanese rule—namely, either joining the Japanese Imperial Army or organizing the guerrilla forces for national independence. The first group was made up of Chinese-origin officers who fought the Japanese army for national independence on mainland China and Manchuria. These officers were organized either as part of the Chinese Nationalist army under Chiang’s KMT leadership or as independent guerrilla forces. The second group of officers included those of Japanese origin who joined the Japanese Imperial Army during the Pacific War. The third distinct group comprised Manchurian-origin officers who participated in the Manchurian Defense Force under Japanese influence. The final group included North Korean-origin officers who escaped from North Korea before and during the Korean War.15 In the earliest years of state-building, Rhee depended primarily on Chinese-origin officers, until they were overwhelmed by the Japanese- and Manchuria-origin soldiers. The Chinese faction had strong political ties with Kim Koo, a prominent political leader during the provisional government in China who had created and trained the Chinese-origin soldiers during the independence war against Japan. However, Kim Koo was assassinated during the early state-building period, and the Chinese faction subsequently lost its power base and influence in the Rhee government. The next factional group with which Rhee formed a political alliance was the officers with a Japanese military background. Rhee relied on the Japanese faction for two\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 30\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:13 PM\n\nSTATEBUILDING AND ARMYBUILDING\n\n31\n\nmain reasons: to have a better image of a well-trained and equipped Korean army and to counterbalance the once-dominant Chinese faction. The Japanese faction impacted Korean politics tremendously, primarily because the officer group brought the Japanese Imperial Army’s political activism during the Pacific War to Korean politics. The 1961 coup d’état was spearheaded by young army officers with a Japanese military background. The political crisis surrounding the 1952 constitutional amendment and ensuing martial law led Rhee to select the third military faction, the officers with Manchurian background. Along with the Japanese faction, the Manchurian officers brought values quite contrary to democracy and civilian supremacy over the military to Korean politics. Downfall of the Rhee Syngman Regime Rhee’s personal skill of controlling and mobilizing military officers for his political purposes had been so successful that he did not lose control over the military leadership until the very last moment of his presidency. However, his increasingly authoritarian and coercive political tactics as well as the mobilization of the armed forces for his political expediency resulted in two significant political outcomes. First, the Rhee government isolated itself from the general public. In addition to the constitutional amendment in 1952, Rhee proposed another amendment bill to the National Assembly in September 1954 that aimed to abolish the two-term restriction on presidential tenure for the first president of South Korea. This amendment would, in effect, enable the president to remain in office for life. The National Assembly passed the bill on November 29, 1954. Yet such undemocratic practices eventually eroded Rhee’s political support base in the general public. Furthermore, Rhee’s mobilization of army officers into civilian politics ultimately made them politically active and—worse yet—aggravated factional struggles among them. The Rhee government lost popular support largely because of its failure to ensure economic performance in addition to Rhee’s undemocratic political practices. Following the end of the war, the South Korean economy showed no indication of significant improvement, especially compared to its Northern counterpart. North Korea’s Kim Il-sung carried out two economic plans targeted to be accomplished by 1960. During the first Three-Year Plan (1954–1956), North Korea experienced a 220 percent increase in national income and 280 percent increase in gross industrial product. During the second Five-Year Plan period (1956–1960), national income in North Korea increased 210 percent and gross industrial product by 340 percent.16\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 31\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:13 PM\n\n32\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nAlthough it is difficult to accept North Korea’s economic indicators at face value, North Korea undeniably far surpassed South Korea in terms of economic performance and military buildup throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In contrast to its northern neighbor, the South Korean economy showed few signs of recovery. Even with significant economic and military assistance from the United States throughout the Rhee regime, South Korea lagged far behind primarily due to the lack of viable economic plans and rampant political corruption in the government and the ruling Liberal Party. South Korea’s GNP growth rate achieved 5.2 percent in 1954, 4.0 percent in 1955, and 0.3 percent in 1956 whereas inflation was 26.4 percent, 51 percent, and 42.9 percent for the same years. Rhee’s failure to implement a feasible economic recovery plan significantly weakened his political position among the general public, especially young officers in the military. To make matters worse, Rhee’s political base—the Liberal Party—split between hardliners and softliners during the late 1950s. The softliners in the ruling circle tried to recuperate the constitutional democracy and pursued more moderate measures in dealing with political opposition forces; meanwhile, the hardliners wanted to tighten political control and use more heavy-handed approaches to suppress the political opposition. However, the decisive factor that ousted Rhee from his presidency was the military’s decision not to follow his order to put down student demonstrations. By this time, the armed forces had already risen as the veto power group against the civilian leadership in South Korean politics. The next chapter discusses the political dynamics from the fall of the Rhee regime to subsequent political turmoil in the short-lived Second Republic under Chang Myon and the military coup d’état in May 1961.\n\nII. State-Building and the Army in Taiwan Losing the Civil War on the Mainland The Republic of China, the first modern government of mainland China, was established with the overthrow of the frail Qing Dynasty in 1912. However, the modern state-building process was not smooth as it had to deal with numerous domestic and international security challenges until it retreated to Formosa Island in 1949. Internally, the newborn republic was too weak to gain full control over its mainland territory, as influential warlords declared themselves to be emperors and ruled most of the provinces amidst the fall of the Dynasty. According to one estimate, more than 1,300 warlords existed and 140 regional military uprisings occurred during the\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 32\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:13 PM\n\nSTATEBUILDING AND ARMYBUILDING\n\n33\n\nearly decades of the nationalist republic.17 Furthermore, the nationalist KMT government had to fight Mao Tse-tung’s Communist revolt throughout the 1930s and 1940s. To make matters worse, the Japanese invasion of mainland China in 1937 in effect placed the country under total anarchy. While facing these security threats, the army of the Republic of China played a decisive role in the political and nation-building processes—not only on the mainland, but more so after the KMT’s retreat to Taiwan. Senior officers in the army became increasingly influential actors in domestic political, administrative, and economic areas as the country struggled with multiple threats during the modern state-building period. Since the inception of the modern republic, the KMT government had to fight multifront military confrontations. The KMT’s first task was to crush the flourishing provincial warlords in the 1920s and deter Japanese aggression in the 1930s and 1940s. However, the conclusion of World War II and Japan’s withdrawal from the mainland gave rise to an even more bitter battle with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on the mainland until the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949. When the KMT withdrew to Taiwan, nearly 600,000 soldiers and another 600,000 civilian refugees also moved to the island. The end of the civil war between the nationalist KMT and Mao’s CCP in 1949 did not resolve the internal battles between the two Chinese governments; rather, the battles became even more intense after two sovereign states were declared in Taipei and Beijing. The KMT in Taiwan had to struggle for its regime survival from constant internal and external threats. Internally, it had to deal with the uncooperative native Taiwanese, who did not welcome the mainlanders and the government, but rather preferred independence.18 The native Taiwanese perceived the arrival of Chiang’s KMT forces as another form of colonial rule by another external authority, just as Japan had ruled them for decades. The mainland Chinese, an ethnic minority, monopolized key positions in political, economic, and military areas while ethnic Taiwanese were systematically excluded from the ruling circle. Meanwhile, externally, the KMT had to cope with the increasing threats from the mainland’s PLA forces as the latter pledged to liberate the island and truly end the civil war. KMT in Taiwan When Japan was defeated in the Pacific War in 1945, Taiwan came under the KMT’s rule. Immediately after Japan retreated from the island, Chiang dispatched the KMT officials and the army to replace the Japanese occupation\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 33\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:13 PM\n\n34\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES AND MILITARY POLITICS IN EAST ASIA\n\nforces and establish the Chinese governmental authority. The KMT appointed General Chen Yi as the chief administrator of the Taiwan Provincial Executive Office; he simultaneously became Taiwan Garrison Commander.19 General Chen was entrusted with extensive powers over the areas of civil administration, judicial authority, and military command. The Chen administration showed little respect for the native Taiwanese or their living conditions, which had seriously deteriorated under Japanese rule. Although General Chen permitted the islanders to have provincial and local elections, he did not entrust the Taiwanese locals with any decision-making power over important political issues. Rather, the mainland Chinese—an ethnic minority—monopolized all the important posts in the government. The corrupt and incompetent Chen administration used heavily oppressive measures to control the islanders, which provoked violent demonstrations calling for self-government by the Taiwanese natives. On February 28, 1947, Taiwanese islanders revolted against Chen’s rule. A series of violent clashes between ethnic Taiwanese and the KMT authority occurred when General Chen decided to nationalize businesses on the island. The uprisings escalated into even more violent riots against the KMT armed forces. Chen declared martial law and brutally suppressed the demonstrations. According to one official figure, it is estimated that more than 60,000 ethnic Taiwanese participated and more than 6,000 were killed by the KMT forces in the uprisings.20 Chiang initially defended General Chen’s brutal repression, charging that the CCP forces and the Taiwanese natives trained by the Japanese army were behind the riots. However, shortly after the February 28th Uprising, General Chen stepped down as chief administrator, and civilian administrators replaced the position to placate the enraged Taiwanese. Yet the incident had crafted a deep schism between the native Taiwanese and the mainland Chinese that lasted for decades. The ethnic tension continued to become a major source of domestic instability as most of the key positions in the KMT party, government, and military continued to be monopolized by the ethnic mainlanders. For example, of 10 KMT Central Standing Committee (CSC) members, none was of Taiwanese origin throughout the 1950s and 1960s. There were only two Taiwanese out of 21 CSC memberships in 1970.21 The situation in the legislative bodies was similar to the executive branch, as both the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan—which had been originally elected in 1947 on the mainland—were monopolized by mainlanders.22 After 1949, elections for both bodies were temporarily brought to a halt since they were assumed to represent not just the island of Taiwan, but\n\nJWoo_02_Final.indd 34\n\n11/15/2010 1:41:13 PM\n\nSTATEBUILDING AND ARMYBUILDING\n\n35\n\nalso the entire territory of Chinese mainland. Indeed, Chiang and KMT elites never imagined that they would stay in Taiwan for long, but anticipated retaking the mainland territory by force in the near future by resuming the civil war. The monopoly of key positions by ethnic Chinese was also as conspicuous in the KMT military as in other governmental bodies. As Table 2.1 indicates, ethnic Taiwanese constituted the majority at the private soldier level, yet the Chinese mainlanders—an ethnic minority—were dominant at higher-ranking positions. Mainlanders’ monopoly of the leadership positions continued until the 1970s, when Chiang Ching-kuo assumed political leadership and embarked on the slow but steady Taiwanization of civilian politics and the military hierarchy. Some Taiwanese activists who opposed KMT rule went abroad to form organizations supporting Taiwan’s independence. However, their influence on the Taiwanese people was minimal due to the Chiang regime’s harsh punishment of any discussion related to the issue of Taiwan’s independence. One such example of punishments by the KMT was that of professor Peng Ming-min, a well-known political science professor at the National Taiwan University who advocated for Taiwanese independence. Peng was sentenced to eight years in prison, but was later"
