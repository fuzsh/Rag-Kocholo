        "text": "1. Agus Salim\n\nDied: 1954 A.D\n\nSlogan: The people's welfare is the highest law\n\nAgus Salim was born on 8 October 1884 in Koto Gadang, a village in North Sumatra. He was the eldest of nine children in a Batak Muslim family. He studied teaching at a school in Medan and then enrolled at a military academy in Bandung. He became a member of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, but following the Japanese invasion in 1942, he joined the Defenders of the Homeland, a Japanese-sponsored militia. After the proclamation of Indonesian independence in 1945, he enlisted in the fledgling Indonesian armed forces, and fought during the Indonesian National Revolution against the Dutch colonial forces. He rose to prominence as a charismatic and innovative leader, and in 1946, he was appointed commander of the Siliwangi Division, the guerrilla unit operating in West Java.
