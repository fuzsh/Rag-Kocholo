Very few countries have been able to overcome the perennial problem relating to the accountability of rulers as well as the control of the institutions of state coercion. In many countries, including a large number in Asia, the military has intruded on and dominated politics. The October I999 military coup in Pakistan; the actions of the Burmese and Chinese militaries in crushing prodemocracy protests in Rangoon and Beijing in Ig88 and Ig8g, respectively; and the continued military stranglehold on the Burmese state are manifestations of military intrusion upon and domination of politics in Asia. However, as demonstrated by developments in the Philippines (Ig86), South Korea (I987), Taiwan (I987), Bangladesh (Iggi), Thailand (I973, I992), and most recently in Indonesia (rgg8), the military has also been dislodged from the political helm. The relationship between the soldier and the state in Asia, as elsewhere, has undergone and continues to undergo change- more fundamentally in some countries than in others. In this study we investigate and explain key changes and continuities in civil-military relations in sixteen Asian countries and anticipate future trajectories. A key finding of the study is that from a long-term and regional perspective, the political power and influence of the military and its participation in governance, though still considerable in some countries, is on the decline. At the founding moments in fifteen of the sixteen countries investigated, civil-military interaction was characterized by military subordination to civilian authority. However, beginning in the mid-Igsos, the number of Asian countries under military domination increased, reaching a peak in the early rg8os. Since Ig86, civilian control of the military, especially democratic civilian control, has been on the rise. At the time of writing, only two countries (Burma and Pakistan) are under military rule, and the military is the central pillar of the totalitarian regime in North Korea. Although the number of countries under civilian rule has increased dramatically, the relationship between the state and soldier is XV\n\nXVI\n\nPREFACE\n\nnot a settled issue even in countries that have reasonably well established political systems. In countries that are undergoing democratic transition, civilian control of the military is far from established. Civil-military relations in these countries are still a contested domain that is being redefined only incrementally and often through struggle. Some setbacks and even reversals cannot be ruled out. From a long-term perspective, however, the scope and jurisdiction of the military in governance has decreased and will likely continue to do so, with a corresponding increase in civilian supremacy. A related finding is that civilian supremacy does not equal democratic civilian control. In the foreseeable future, civil-military interaction in Asia will continue to be characterized by multiple patterns. Subjective civilian control is likely to continue in Malaysia, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. The Leninist pattern is likely to persist in the People's Republic of China and Vietnam in the short to medium term but, along with the totalitarian pattern in North Korea, appears unsustainable. It is difficult to anticipate the civil-military trajectories in these latter countries except to state that with the increasing inability of the communist parties and supreme leaders to monopolize political power, the sy.mbiotic relationship between party, leader, state, and military is likely to become more diluted, with the state assuming greater control over the military. A military regime appears unlikely in either China or Vietnam. The Burmese military may be able to continue its stranglehold on the state through sheer force and terror, but it is unlikely that the Pakistani military can dominate the political helm indefinitely. Some form of power sharing that eventually paves the way for more durable civilian rule is likely though not inevitable. Though the Leninist and military rule patterns will persist for some time, democratic civilian control is emerging as the dominant mode of civil-military interaction in Asia. Japan and India, both of which have experienced uninterrupted democratic civilian control during the past five decades, are likely to continue in this pattern. Democratic civilian control is consolidating in Taiwan, South Korea, and to a lesser degree in the Philippines and Thailand. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, such control is still in an early stage and could suffer setbacks. Civilmilitary interactions in Malaysia, Singapore, and Sri Lanka, though of the subjective type, do exhibit som e features of democratic civilian control. For reasons explored in this study, the trends toward civilian control and the growing dominance of democratic civilian control appear to be durable. The key to understanding civil-military relations in Asia, as elsewhere, is the significance and role of coercion-the key asset of the military-in state and nation building and in the exercise of political authority. As the significance of coercion in these processes increases or decreases, so does the political power and influence of the military. Although the salience of coercion in the international consolidation of the state is important, ilie significance and role of coercion in domestic governance is the more crucial variable in explaining the relationship of the soldier to the state. The weight of coercion in securing the loyalty and obedience of citizens is directly linked to and is a reflection of the legitimacy of ilie nation-state, its political system, and its government. The relationship between the international deployment of the military and political legitimacy is not as clear cut. This said, the political power and influence of the military is greatest when coercion plays a crucial role in both domestic governance and in ensuring international security. The several propositions that have been advanced to explain developments in civil-milita1y relations- push-pull, institutional imbalance, military professionalism, corporate interest, con-\n\nPrifOce gruence of interests, and others-suffer certain shortcomings and at best can provide only a limited explanation. Our proposition that the power and influence of the military varies with the salience of coercion in governance has much greater power in explaining the full cycle of military politics. It also connects civil-military interaction to the larger processes associated with state and nation building, construction of legitimate political order, and change in the international system. The weight of coercion in governance is correlated with success or failure in the internal and international consolidation of the nation and state, the legitimacy of the political system and incumbent government, the level of economic development, and the institutional and resource capacity of the government to address the challenges confronting it through political, social, and economic measures. As nations and states become better consolidated, as institutions and procedures for the acquisition and exercise of state power become more widely accepted, and as the economy and state capacity develop, there will likely be a corresponding decline in the weight of coercion and in the power and influence of the military in governance. Much therefore hinges on the consolidation of nation and state, development of a legitimate political system and state capacity, economic development, and the material and normative structure of the international system. In Asia, as elsewhere, postcolonial and postrevolutionary governments faced enormous challenges in state and nation building as well as in constructing legitimate political systems. Although experiences varied, in many countries power and authority were not concentrated in the state, state institutions were unable to dominate the entire country, minorities resisted integration into national communities, political systems were challenged by groups espousing rival organizing ideologies, legitimacy of governments was contested by competing elite, and in several cases the new states were confronted with severe international threats to their very existence. Internal and international security were prime concerns of many Asian countries. In many cases, state coercion played a dominant role in most if not all these processes and resulted in military role expansion and a dramatic increase in the coercive, organizational, economic, and political power and influence of the military. Though Asian countries still continue to face major challenges- and in some cases the challenges have become more acute- during the past five decades or so, several have made substantial progress in the internal and international consolidation of nation and state and in the development of widely accepted systems and institutions for political domination. In these countries, the resort to coercion, especially the private, partisan, and repressive use of force in governance, has declined, and so has the political power and influence of the military. A large number of Asian countries, particularly those in East Asia and Southeast Asia, have also experienced high rates of economic growth for well over two decades. The highly successful export-led growth strategies of these countries integrated their national economies into the global capitalist economy, instituting new rules and procedures for the countries' management with spillover social and political effects. Sustained economic development in the capitalist mode made for a more complex economy that demanded sophisticated management that was well beyond what could be provided by the military. It also set in train the development of new domestic forces- an independent private sector, growth of middle and working classes, strong and vibrant civil societies-making for much more complex states and societies, with the latter demanding greater welfare, accountability, and participation in governance. Such development also strengthened other state institutions. The social and political mobilization\n\nxvu\n\nXVlll\n\nPREFACE\n\nengendered by sustained capitalist development tilted the distribution of power against the military and altered the norms and rules of governance. Simultaneously, and especially since the mid- to late rg8os, the international context altered decidedly in favor of democracy, human rights, and the market economy. International organizations and key external actors condemned military coups and ostracized military governments. Not only have these developments altered the normative structure and distribution of power in favor of civilian institutions, with a corresponding decline in the political influence of the military in several countries, they have also generated close domestic and international scrutiny of military institutions and their activities. The interplay of coercion, political legitimacy, and economic development in the context of a changing international system, we argue, explains long-term change and continuity in Asian civil-military relations. Our central argument borne out by the experiences of the past several decades suggests that enhancement of civilian supremacy requires strengthening the legitimacy, capacity, and roles of civilian institutions; sustained economic development; and reduction of the salience of coercion in governance. These hinge on forging agreement on the political identity of the nation-state and the system for political domination, success in economic growth and development, and development of appropriate political and socioeconomic policies and processes to address political and social problems. This does not imply that coercion is irrelevant for governance, only that its role should be limited and indirect and be viewed as the ultimate sanction, not the first recourse. Turning more explicitly to civil-military interaction, consolidation of civilian supremacy entails mobilization of superior political, ideational, moral, and economic power on the part of civilian authorities and the translation of such power into strong institutions to regulate matters pertaining to the military and its role in governance. By compelling political, bureaucratic, and military actors to interact in accordance with specified rules and procedures in the development of policy, institutions condition all actors to operate under a civilian framework and reduce (though not eliminate) the salience of brute power. The cross-cutting alliances and cleavages made possible by interaction through institutions also contribute to the development of understanding and respect for different perspectives, leading to moderation and compromise. These developments enhance the legitimacy of the civilian-dominant political system. As it becomes accustomed to operating in such a framework, the military in the long run internalizes the norm of civilian control. Further, institutional design-in terms of issues, jurisdiction, a nd actors- can affect policy outcome, which is the substance of civil-military relations. By being able to influence the substance of policy as well as the power and interests of competing actors, institutions can affect the civil-military balance in favor of civilian authority. The goal should be to limit the military role to external defense. When it is necessary to deploy the military in an internal security role, it must remain under the close oversight of civilian authorities who themselves must be legitimate and accountable. Ultimately, civilian leaders and officials must h ave the jurisdiction to define and control the role of the military in governance and manage the military as a state institution, although certain powers may be delegated to the military in the interest of operational and administrative efficiency. To be durable, the deepening and consolidation of civilian supremacy must span the domains of power, ideas, and interests and be reflected in institutions, policy outcomes, and sustained practice.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nCOVERING I6 COUNTRIES; INVOLVING I9 CONTRIBUTORS, 42 senior scholars, and 38 readers; and spanning more than three years, this project, like its predecessor, Asian Security Practice, has been a major undertaking and intellectually very demanding. The challenge was made more formidable by the absence of a widely accepted body of concepts, propositions, and theories in the subfield of civil-military relations as well as the paucity of theoretically informed studies of civil-military relations in Asia. The authors and I often found ourselves operating in relatively poorly mapped terrain, compelling us to cover much more new ground, both theoretically and empirically, than would be normal in this kind of enterprise. The challenges h ave certainly broadened and deepened our intellectual horizons, but the experience also has been humbling. Through interaction in two rigorous workshops, reading and rereading each other's papers, and continuous interchange through E-mail, the authors and I have learned a great deal from the project. We hope this book and the several policy papers that resulted from the project can make a modest contribution to the study and practice of civil-military relations in Asia and elsewhere. Also, we hope the reader will find the book as stimulating and rewarding as it has been for us to write it. In keeping with my goals of promoting theoretically informed study of Asia-Pacific politics and security and fostering the development of a new generation of scholars who can engage in more rigorous scholarship that straddles theory and area studies, I invited mostly younger scholars to contribute the country chapters and involved more established scholars- theorists and regional and country specialists- to review, discuss, and comment on their work. Also, in light of the considerable work that has been done on civil-military relations in South America, Southern and Eastern Europe, and Mrica, I invited experts on these regions to participate in the project. The authors and senior scholars drawn from South, Southeast, and East Asia, the United States, Australia, Latin America, and Europe met in two stimulating and productive workshops: first in October 1998 in Honolulu and then in Bangkok in April I999· From inception of the idea in late 1997 through the appearance of the book in print, the intellectual journey- described by the late Michel Oksenberg as a \"long march\"- has benefited enormously from interaction with and input from many scholars and practitioners. Felipe Aguero, Samina Ahmed, Suchit Bunbongkarn, Chu Shulong, Donald Crone, Harold Crouch, David Pion-Berlin, and Maj. Gen. Noboru Yamaguchi participated in both workshops.

Larry Diamond read and commented on the entire manuscript and provided many helpful suggestions. To these scholars I would like to express my deep appreciation and thanks. They made an enormous contribution to the project. It has been my privilegeprofessionally and personally- to interact with them. Cristina Eguizabal and Marin Strmecki, though they were not direct participants, provided strong support for the project. I would also like to thank the highly talented and hard-working contributors to this book. Their expert knowledge of the countries as well as of key issues in comparative politics greatly aided the intellectual refinement of the project as it progressed. Also, their willingness to ground their inquiry in a common framework and rework the chapters several times is admirable and has made for a more coherent book. Several contributors participated in open briefings on the subject for U.S. Congressional members and staff and for the Pentagon staff in February 2000.

From a personal perspective, the past two years have been among the busiest in my life. This project along with two others had to be managed at the same time as reorganizing, integrating, reorienting, recruiting for, and managing the Research Program at the East-West Center in my capacity as director of studies. Without the understanding, patience, and support of my wife, Kalyani, I could not have performed the numerous and rewarding, though at times onerous, duties as director of studies. My research would have suffered and this book would not exist. I would like to express my deepest appreciation to her as well as to my children Radha, Shanthi, and Padma. I would like to dedicate this book to Vikram, who has brought a new meaning and perspective to life.

The choice before us on October 12 [1999] was between saving the nation and the constitution. As the constitution is but part of the nation, I chose to save the nation .... This is not martial law, only another path toward democracy. The armed forces have no intention to stay in charge any longer than is absolutely necessary to pave the way for true democracy to flourish in Pakistan. - Chief Executive Gen. Pervaiz Musharaf The [Indonesian military] knows the whole society is changing [and] that [it] has to cha nge its attitude toward society. We have a strong military and we need it. .. . Some of our generals are good, some are bad, like in any other society. The problem is that we have to take a very gradual approach to [the military] . .. . I waited for the results of the National Commission on Human Rights investigation of alleged military violation of human rights in East Timor.. . . If [General Wiranto] is implicated, [I will say to him] it is better to save the institution, the Indonesian Armed Forces, so you have to resign. We must not act like we did in the past. Our soldiers went to Aceh and attacked the people. It must not happen again ... the people are not our enemy. We need a strong military to defend our country. But that does not mean we want to return to a military state. -President Abdurrahmand Wahid\n\nPakistan's army chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharaf ousted democratically elected prime minister Nawaz Shari£ Citing the crumbling economy, the diplomatic isolation of Pakistan and its loss of international credibility, the destruction of state institutions by civilian political leaders, cracks in the federation, and an alleged intrigue by Sharif to sow discord and dissension within the armed forces, Musharaf, promising good governance, proclaimed himself the chief executive of the country. H e instituted a system of government comprising the sitting president, a six-member National Security Council (NSC) headed by Musharaf himself and supported by a think tank, and a cabinet of ministers who will work under the guidance of the NSC, and he appointed provincial governors who will function through a small cabinet. Although Musharaf pledged to free the people of IN A LIGHTNING couP D'ETAT ON OcTOBER 1 2 , 1999,\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPakistan from the \"yoke of despotism\" and move Pakistan from \"sham democracy\" to \"true democracy,\" he refused to indicate how and when he will return power to an elected civilian government. However, following the May I2, 2000, ruling of the reconstituted supreme court that validated the October coup and gave him sweeping powers to amend the 1973 constitution, Musharaf has committed himself to the mandate of the court to carry out the necessary social and political reforms and announce a date for national elections go days before the expiry of the three~year period in October 2002. 1 There is no guarantee that national elections will be held by this date. About the same time that the military was taking control of the political helm in Pakistan, the Indonesian military (Tentera Nasional Indonesia [TNI])-which had been part of the political leadership for more than 30 years and which many observers at home and abroad depicted as a crucial player in the ongoing political transition in that country-was unexpectedly and rather deftly being dislodged from the corridors of power. 2 Following the lastminute withdrawal of sitting president B.J. Habibie from the presidential competition, in a dramatic development the People's Consultative Assembly elected Abdurrahmand Wahid, a moderate Muslim cleric, and Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of the first president, as the fourth president and vice-president of Indonesia, respectively. Successive unexpected developments, especially the formation of a \"national unity cabinet\" with representation from a wide range of political parties spanning almost the entire Indonesian political spectrum, dramatically undercut the military's political power and influence, which was already on the wane since the ouster of Suharto in May 1gg8. Instead of playing a kingmaker role, as widely anticipated in the run-up to the presidential election, the military, at least in the short term, has been sidelined under a democratically elected civilian leadership. General Wiranto, chief of the thitherto powerful TNI, had to pull out of the vice-presidential race, resign his TNI position, and accept a less powerful appointment as coordinating minister for political and security affairs in Wahid's national unity cabinet. (Four months later he would be forced to resign from this position for alleged involvement in the TNI's human rights violations in East Timor.) For the first time, a civilian was appointed defense minister, and the position of TNI commander went to a naval officer. Though highly dramatic, the developments in Pakistan and Indonesia are not unique to these countries. Throughout much of Asia, the military is still a crucial actor in domestic and international politics, playing key roles in state and nation building, in political domination, in maintaining internal order, and in ensuring international security. However, the political role of the military and more generally the patterns of civil-military relations in Asia span a wide spectrum, ranging from firm democratic civilian control of the military in japan and India through consolidation of such control in South Korea and Taiwan; transition to democratic civilian control in the Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Indonesia; subjective (ethnic and dominant party) civilian control of the military in Singapore, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka; communist party control of the military in China and Vietnam; totalitarian dictatorship control of the military in North Korea; and military domination of the state in Pakistan and Burma. Further, the relationship of the soldier to the state in Asia is not a settled issue. Substantive change is occurring in nearly every country. Though change has been more fundamental in Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, the basis and\n\nIntroduction content of civil-military relations in established democracies like Japan and India are also experiencing change. Change is also occurring in party-military relations in the Asian socialist states of China and Vietnam, and in the totalitarian regime in North Korea. In fact, because of the ongoing economic transitions in China and Vietnam and the likely political changes that may follow, civil-military relations in these countries may be in for more far-reaching change in the years ahead. Looking to the future, although the military in a number of countries continues to wield considerable political influence that may even increase, the long-term trend in Asia is toward a reduction in the political power and influence of the military and strengthening of civilian control, especially democratic civilian control of the military. Compared to the 1960s and 1970s, when seven or eight countries were under military rule or military-backed rule, at the time of writing there are only two or three (Burma, Pakistan, and perhaps North Korea). This number could increase, but a throwback to earlier periods appears highly unlikely. The states, societies, and economies in Asia are becoming more vibrant and complex, and the international context has altered decidedly in favor of democracy, capitalism, and human rights. The balance of power is increasingly tilted against the military. In any case, military intervention, as proven time and again, does not provide the solution to the many multifaceted and complex political and economic challenges confronting the Asian countries. In earlier times, an economic crisis like the one that occurred in 1997 would have been an opportunity for the military to intervene. This time, however, the South Korean and Thai militaries stood on the sidelines while civilian political leaders, bureaucrats, and technocrats managed the crisis. Even so, the reduction in the military's political role and consolidation of democratic civilian control of the military are likely to be gradual and complex and prone to violence and occasional setbacks. And, \"ultimately,\" there still will be substantial variations across Asia in the relationship of the soldier to the state. The continuing political salience of the military, the enormous diversity in state-soldier relations, and the trend in Asia toward democratic civilian control raise several important questions: Why do some militaries dominate the state or continue to exercise considerable political influence while others have abstained from or terminated their political roles? Why have militaries with a similar background (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, for example, and China and Taiwan) behaved so differently? Why have some militaries (South Korea and Taiwan) disengaged almost completely from politics while others (Pakistan and Burma) find it difficult to kick this habit? Can the communist parties in China and Vietnam continue to monopolize political power and maintain control over the military while liberalizing their economies? Such questions are explored in this comparative study of civil-military relations in Asia. PURPOSE AND PROPOSITIONS Seeking to illuminate the relationship between the soldier and the state in sixteen Asian countries, this study explores and explains ongoing changes and anticipates future trajectories in this relationship. Specifically, it investigates the following questions. 1.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the military and the other institutions of the state- particularly those that are the containers of political power?\n\n3\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHas this relationship changed over time? How and why? 3· What is the anticipated trajectory of civil-military relations in Asia? And, why? 2.\n\nCivil-military relations covers not only the relationship of the military to the state but also its relationship to the political and civil societies-and civil-military relations are influenced by state-society relations as well. But to keep the study manageable, we shall not deal with militarysociety and state-society relations except as they bear upon the relationship between the soldier and the state. Thus, although the \"civil\" component of the term \"civil-military\" normally refers to the state (minus the military), political society, and civil society/ it is used more narrowly in this study to refer to the nonmilitary apparatus of state- especially the political, administrative, and juridical institutions. In communist states, the term \"civil\" refers to the communist party and associated institutions. The army, navy, and air force (and the marine corps where applicable) form the core of the term \"military.\" It also includes police and paramilitary forces whose tasks are to maintain internal order and border security, as well as security and intelligence agencies. In all these civil and military institutions our concern is with the leadership, especially those individuals and groups who formulate and execute p olicy on issues relating to military-civilian interaction. The individuals may or may not hold the most senior positions in their organizations; the groups may be formal or informal. Further, although the focus of the study is on the relationship of the military as an institution to the other state institutions, it is investigated in the broader context of the connection between coercion (which includes but is not limited to force) and governance (which in this study includes nation and state building, the structure and process of political domination, the maintenance of internal order, and safeguarding the international security of the state). This approach is premised on the belief that the relationship of the soldier to the state is strongly influenced by the weight of coercion in governance. We believe that such a broad inquiry, which has not been common in the study of civil-military relations, will provide new insights and connect the subfield of civil-military relations to the larger issues in comparative politics. The study advances two sets of explanatory propositions. The first set is rooted in the fact that state coercion plays a key role in building national political communities, in the structure of political domination, in extending the reach of government, in maintaining law and order, and in preserving international security. As the primary (though not exclusive) repository of state coercion, the military is a key institution in governance. Participation in governance endows the military with power and influence, the magnitude of which varies with the importance or weight of coercion relative to norms, rules, law, and custom in the practice of governance. The argument here is that as state coercion becomes more prominent, especially in domestic politics, the size of the military as well as its scope and jurisdiction expands, usually to the detriment of other institutions of the state, tilting the distribution of power in favor of the military. The weight of coercion in governance in turn is influenced by two key factors: one is the domestic and international legitimacy of the nation-state and the political system, and the second is the level of economic development. Rooted in the interplay of coercion, legitimacy, and economic development, the first set comprises three interconnected propositions. r. The m ain proposition is that as the weight of coercion in governance rises (or declines), so does the political power and influence of the military. When the weight of coer-\n\nIntroduction cion in governance is low, civilian supremacy is likely to be the norm. Conversely, military or military-backed rule is highly likely when coercion is the mainstay of political domination. 2 . The weight of coercion in governance is inversely proportional to the legitimacy of the nation-state and political system and the capacity of the noncoercive institutions of the state to address the challenges confronting the country. If the nation-state and political system are widely accepted and the political, administrative, and legal institutions of the state are capable of addressing the problems confronting the country through political, economic, and social measures, then coercion will not figure prominently in governance and vice versa. g. The weight of coercion in governance declines with increasing levels of economic development. Sustained economic development in the capitalist mode makes for a complex economy (that is highly integrated into the global economy) as well as for a more complex state and society. The noncoercive institutions of the state, the capacity of which should increase with sustained economic development, assume greater prominence in the political and administrative management of the state. Coercion becomes less central to the managem ent of the challenges that confront the country. Together, the three propositions above can explain long-term changes in civil-military relations, but they are less useful (though not irrelevant) in explaining specific developments. Their primary function is in setting structural constraints. Explanation of specific developments must focus on the level of agency-institutions and personalities. This leads to the second set of propositions. Because an array of causal factors may be at work and their salience and mix may be case specific, the focus of the second set of propositions is on the intervening variables of beliefs, interests, and power of the key actors as well as the nature and strength of the political system. The concern is not the numerous (uncontrollable) factors but how they m ay affect the three intervening variables and with what consequence for civil-military relations. The three propositions that comprise the second set are enumerated below. 4· T he pattern and content of state-soldier relations are the outcome of the interaction of the interests, power, and beliefs of the civilian and military institutions mediated by the power and influence of civil society and the international community. 5· Where the political system is widely accepted, the principles and norms of that system will determine the pattern of civil-military relations. The specific content, however, will be an outcome of the interplay of the competing interests of the relevant key actors and the distribution of power am ong them. 6. In situations where the political system is contested sharply or is in transition, then the distribution of power becomes crucial. Explanations of specific developments in civilmilitary relations in this context must necessarily turn on the distribution of power among the key actors and their competing interests. As the configuration of power among the key state institutions as well as their beliefs and interests are affected by the state of civil society and the key external actors, they must also feature in the analysis of civil-military developments. These two sets of p rop ositions, fleshed out in greater detail in Chapter I , are particularly relevant to Asia, where most of the states are p ostcolonial and relatively recent in origin. State\n\n5\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncoercion figured prominently in the early years in the internal and international consolidation of these states as well as in political domination. The high salience of coercion increased the power and influence of the military in a large number of countries, leading in several cases to military intervention and domination of the state. Over time, with success in economic development and the development of noncoercive state institutions, as well as the construction of legitimate political systems for the acquisition and exercise of state power, the salience of coercion and by extension the power and influence of the military declined in some countries. In countries that failed in economic development and that have not had much success in developing a widely accepted political system, as well as in those that alienated or have been unable to integrate minority communities, coercion has continued to figure prominently in governance. In these countries, the power and influence of the military have remained unaltered or even increased. We explore and develop these themes fully in the concluding chapter of the book. Next, we discuss the nature of the civil-military problem in conceptual terms and its manifestation in the countries investigated in the study. THE NATURE OF THE CIVIL-MILITARY PROBLEM IN THE MODERN STATE Force is a critical feature of the modern state. Max Weber claimed that monopoly over the legitimate use of force was as essential a characteristic of the state as compulsory jurisdiction and continuous organization in a territory (Weber rg64: rs6). Though critical of Weber in several respects, including his backward generalization of the state, Anthony Giddens acknowledges territoriality and control over violence as key features of the state.\"1 Defining a state as a political organization \"whose rule is territorially ordered and which is able to mobilize the means of violence to sustain that rule,\" he posits that only in the modern state can the state apparatus lay successful claim to the monopoly of the means of violence (Giddens rg87: 20, 120). Centralized control over the means of violence is one of the four \"institutional clusterings\" that Giddens identifies with modernity. 5 Though force was a feature of the traditional state, it is the monopoly mechanism and centralized control that distinguish the modern state (Elias rgg8). Chronic threats to the monopoly of force do exist in certain contemporary states, but as noted by Giddens (rg8]: r2r), the modern state is nevertheless different from the traditional state in that \"armed groups or movements today are almost always oriented to the assumption of state p ower either by taking over an existing state's territory or by dividing up a territory and establishing a separate state.\" Monopoly of coercion has become an essential component of definitions of the modern state in the Weberian tradition, which is the dominant contemporary perspective on the state. 6 The quest for monopoly over coercion was a driving force in the formation of Western European nation-states. Charles Tilly (1975, rg85, rgg2) traces the origins of European states to \"the effort to monopolize the means of violence within a delimited territory adjacent to a power holder's base\" (rg8g: 172). His argument is that state m aking in Europe was shaped by the interaction of war making, resource extraction, and capital accumulation. To secure the benefits of power within a fixed or expanding territory, European rulers engaged in war with their competitors. War making required bureaucratic organization and the extraction of resources from subjects as well as the promotion of capital accumulation by those who could\n\nIntroduction finance the acquisition of war-making capability by the rulers. According to Tilly (rgg2: go-gr), the capital-intensive and coercion-intensive methods of resource extraction were less successful than the capitalized-coercion method; the latter had a decided advantage in warfare. Consequently, the national state- the product of the capitalized-coercion method-won out over other forms of state, including city-states, empires, and urban federations. Apart from its central role in the consolidation of European states, force featured prominently in political domination and the maintenance of internal order. Weber, however, makes clear that \"domination of men by men\" in the modern state rests on rational-legal authority\" on a belief in the 'legality' of patterns of normative rules and the right of those elevated to authority under such rules to issue commands\" (Weber 1964: 131, 328). Laws and custom are the primary means of regulating society in the modern state. The abstract availability of physical violence, howevet; is necessary to ensure their efficacy (Luhmann rg85: r6g). By ensuring that tllose who violate the socially accepted rules will be punished, physical force leads to clear outcomes, increases the security of expectations, and makes for greater regularity of social interaction. Force is thus the ultimate sanction and an integral part of state autllority. It is legitimate only when \"permitted by the state or prescribed by it\" (Weber rg64: 156). The use of force by other entities is illegal. In a similar vein, Giddens (rg87) notes that although force still plays a role in the internal administration of the modern state, force-related sanctions have become attenuated and indirect. He distinguishes between internally directed policing power to maintain law and order and externally directed military power to protect the state from outside aggression. Monopoly by the state removes force as a factor in domestic politics and shifts attention to the international domain, where force is still a legitimate means to achieve political ends. Notwithstanding this shift and the indirect role of force in political domination and the maintenance of internal order, force continues to be a central feature of the modern state. Claiming supreme jurisdiction and autonomy in decision making, governments seek monopoly over coercion within defined territorial boundaries. This quest gives rise to two interconnected problems. The first stems from the goal of concentrating force in the state and denying it to nonstate groups. Only a few states have been successful in this quest. In many countries, the quest for state monopoly of coercion has been challenged by groups that do not subscribe to the nation, state, and political system as presently constructed and who reserve the right to use force in pursuing their political ends. Not only may governments be subject to violent challenges in such situations, but a lack of monopoly over coercion may also undermine the effectiveness of their governance, including control over their own militaries. The inability of the state to monopolize force and the possession of the means of organized violence by nonstate groups pose a problem that is usually not labeled as a civil-military problem. However, it is a problem with consequence for civil-military relations. The state has to deal with a military organization over which it has no authority and that challenges the very existence and authority of tlle state. Further, the existence of nonstate organized violence intensifies the role of coercion in governance, complicating the relationship between the state and its military as well as between them and society. The second, more conventional civil-military problem relates to the control of the managers of violence. Having concentrated force in tlle state, the challenge then is to prevent the coercive institutions from dominating the state and society and to ensure that state coercion is\n\n7\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION used in the service of the public interest, not for private and partisan purposes. As the primary repository of the ultimate means of state violence, the military is a key institution of the state, comparable to the civilian bureaucracy and the judiciary. However, because of the brute force at their disposal, the institutions that manage state coercion-the military, paramilitary, police, and intelligence agencies-can become powerful actors with potential to trump the other institutions. They may seek to deploy the power at their disposal to curb liberty, impose their own will on the state and the community to be protected, or further their own corporate and individual interests. Preventing military domination of the state, promoting control by a civilian government that itself is legitimate and accountable to its citizens, limiting the deployment of state coercion for public purposes, defining the proper role and jurisdiction of the military, and regulating the military as an institution are among the key concerns that lie at the heart of the civil-military problem. The resolution of this problem and related issues requires the development of civilian supremacy or civilian control. Civilian supremacy is \"government control of the military,\" and the criteria for civilian control is \"the extent to which military leadership groups, and through them the armed forces as a whole, respond to the direction of the civilian leaders of the government\" (Huntington I956: 38o). Huntington identifies two types of civilian control: objective and subjective. In objective control, there is a clear divide between the government and the military, and the latter obeys the former not because it shares the social values and political ideologies of society but \"because it is its duty to obey.\" In subjective control, there is no clear divide between the government and military. The military embodies the values and ideologies in society, and it obeys the government because it agrees with it. The military's loyalty is not to any government in power but to a specific government or a specific type of government. Under subjective control, the divisions in society are reflected in the military. And, civilian control is usually associated with the maximization of the power of \"particular social classes, and particular constitutional forms\" (Huntington I956: 382). The nature of the civil-military problem and the issues to be addressed vary by political system. In the democratic system, the concern is to ensure a professional and apolitical military that acknowledges civilian authority and executes the orders of a democratically elected government. Though there may be variations, at base civilian authority is supreme in a democratic system. In a communist system, the concern is to indoctrinate and secure the political loyalty of the military and mobilize its support for the party and its goals. The goal is to ensure party supremacy over the military. Ensuring the loyalty of the military, maintaining tight control over it, and deploying it to serve the goals of the dictator are the concerns in a personal dictatorship, especially of the totalitarian type. Even a military regime is not free of the problem. Here the challenge is for the \"military as government\" to control and retain the loyalty of the \"military as an institution.\" 7 These are generic problems. Specific problems will vary by country and stage of development. In Western Europe and the United States, for the most part, states have monopoly on force, the role of force in domestic politics and governance has become indirect and attenuated, and the institutions that manage state coercion are under the control of legitimate governments. The militaries in these countries acknowledge civilian authority and act in the service of the state and society as directed by democratically elected governments primarily, if not exclusively, in the international security role. As observed by Michael Howard (1959), the civil-military problem in these countries \"is not over [political] power but priorities.\" It centers in large part on\n\nIntroduction interdepartmental contentions over matters of defense, including strategy, force posture, budget allocation, operational autonomy, and commitment of troops. Democratic civilian control of the military is the norm in these countries, although concerns·continue to be raised from time to time about the military's increasing influence, the rise of militarism, and the growing cultural divide between the military and society. 8 In South America, where military juntas were common, there has been a rise in democratic civilian rule since the late 1970s. Following the elections in Ecuador in 1979, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and other South American countries elected civilian leaders, including opposition figures to government. Most of the democratic transitions occurred under constitutional frameworks devised by the military-authoritarian rulers, but the latter were not able to control the pace of liberalization or the outcomes (Aguero 1997). However, the militaries still managed to retain certain prerogatives, and there are several major challenges to be overcome in establishing civilian supremacy and consolidating democracy in the South American countries. Nevertheless, civilian control of the military has been on the rise. In Brazil, for example, contrary to the expectation that the military would continue to be an extraordinarily powerful force in the post-transition era, elected politicians have been able to considerably narrow its sphere of influence (Hunter 1997). Recent developments, such as the ouster of the civilian government in Ecuador in january ~woo, the earlier election of former military officers to power in Bolivia, Venezuela, and Guatemala, and the Fujimori government's increasing reliance on the Peruvian military, however, have raised concerns about the resurgence of military political influence on that continent. These developments notwithstanding, the failure of the attempt to create a National Salvation junta in Ecuador suggests that a return to the earlier military junta era appears unlikely. In general, military attitudes toward politics in South American countries are more likely to be defensive to protect their institutional autonomy than to be proactive to destabilize civilian regimes (Pion-Berlin 1992). However, more subtle forms of military influence, such as backing for specific governments, are still in the cards. The situation in Asia is unlike that in Western Europe. In some ways, it is similar to that in South America, but the situation in Asia is much more diverse and complex. State coercion plays a crucial, direct, and visible role in Asian countries: in state and nation building, in political domination, in maintaining internal order, and in ensuring international security State formation in Asia is still in an early stage and differs sharply from the '\\\"est- in some ways, the process is the inverse _of that in Western Europe. Competition, elimination, monopolization, and development of centralized control are occurring but within internationally recognized political units whose boundaries, for the most part, have been fixed. With a few exceptions (Japan, Thailand, China, Nepal), contemporary Asian states have colonial origins, and their territorial boundaries were demarcated by colonial powers. Asian states entered into and exist in an international system that naturalizes the norms associated with the Westphalian state, and Asian leaders aspire to the normative ideal of the modern nation-state. They seek to build nations and states on the basis of the colonial units they inherited. And, to consolidate their positions as well as their constructions of state and national identity, they seek to eliminate rival ideas, leaders, and groups. Force plays a crucial role in their efforts to achieve internal consolidation. It has been deployed quite freely and on a massive scale in support of nation building-especially in relation to segments of minority communities that resist \"national\" integration. Force is a key\n\n9\n\nIO\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncomponent of the policies and strategies of Beijing vis-a-vis the Tibetans and Uighurs; Manila vis-a-vis the Moros; Bangkok vis-a-vis the Malay Muslims in southern Thailand; Jakarta visa-vis the East Timorese, West Papuans, and Acehnese; Yangon vis-a-vis the many minority nationalities in Burma; Dhaka vis-a-vis the Chittagong Hill tribal people; Colombo vis-a-vis the Tamils; and New Delhi vis-a-vis the Muslim Kashmiris and the Assamese, Naga, Mizoram, and Manipur peoples in northeastern India. Coercion plays a central role as well in the structure and process of political domination. Rulers in a number of Asian countries rely on coercion to maintain their position and secure compliance from their citizens and subjects. State coercion was a crucial pillar of the Syngman Rhee, Park Chung-hee, and Chun Doo-hwan governments in South Korea; Mao Zedong's rule in China; the Kuomintang (KMT)-led governments in Taiwan until rg87; the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines; and the military governments in Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. This is still the case in North Korea, Burma, and Pakistan and, in some respects, in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China as well. Even in countries like India, Malaysia, and Singapore, where political systems have become more firmly established, state coercion continues to be a critical feature that is not far removed from direct application. The tension and conflict arising from nation-state building and political legitimation projects~together with the ethnic, sectarian, caste, and class conflicts endemic in many of these societies~make the maintenance of law and order in Asian countries a formidable task requiring routine deployment of state coercion, sometimes on a massive scale. This is evidenced in the vast array of internal security legislation and the dramatic growth in paramilitary forces and security/intelligence agencies throughout Asia (Collier 1999). Force is also crucial in the international relations of Asian states. North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan confront acute political and military threats to their survival. India and Pakistan have an acute conflict over Kashmir that goes to the heart of the political identity of these two states. Many states including China, India, and J apan have territorial conflicts with neighboring states. And, too, there are deep-seated apprehensions and rivalries among most of the Asian states. The threat and use of military force play a central role in all these conflicts and rivalries. Regional cooperation is commanding increasing attention, but it is unlikely to become the mainstay of national security policy. Most Asian states rely on their own national military capabilities; a few (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan) rely on their allies as well. Because of the centrality of coercion in political domination (including regime security), in nation building, and for international security, governments in Asia, like their counterparts elsewhere, seek exclusive control over the means and use of coercion within their territorial boundaries and allocate a substantial percentage of state revenues to institutions that are the repositories of state coercion. This claim to monopoly of coercion is challenged in several countries~especially by minority communities that challenge the legitimacy of the nation-state and the political system as constructed. They too seek to acquire and deploy force in pursuit of their goals, which often run counter to those of the state. The Sri Lankan case where the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have the ability to engage the government forces in major battles is the most dramatic example. But many other nonstate groups, including several guerrilla groups in Kashmir and the northeastern states of India, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines, the Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) and the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM) in Indonesia, and the several minority insurgent forces\n\nIntroduction in Burma, also pose serious challenges to the authority of the state. The possession of organized violence by these nonstate groups and the challenge they pose to state authority expose the affected countries to the first type of civil-military problem. The second, conventional type of civil-military problem is even more widespread in Asia. The militaries in several Asian countries are not subordinate to civilian authority. They have entered the structure of political domination. In Burma, Pakistan, and North Korea (and until recently in Indonesia), the military dominates the political process and determines national goals and agenda. In the Philippines, Thailand, and Bangladesh, although the military has formally disengaged from politics, it continues to wield substantial informal influence in the political process. Even in countries like South Korea and Taiwan where military disengagement from politics is more complete, the militaries still seek to preserve institutional autonomy as well as a key role in the formulation (as opposed to limiting themselves to implementation) of security policy. The militaries in these and other countries still have substantial off-budget revenues through their extensive commercial interests and ventures. Some seek to legitimate their developmental role. Many also engage in illegal activities for personal and corporate profit. The specific nature of the civil-military problem varies by country. Injapan, the challenge is in determining how to move toward a more normal democratic pattern of civil-military relations. In India, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines, a key challenge is to prevent the abuse of state power and erosion of democratic rights at the local level when the military is deployed in the internal security role. In Taiwan, a remaining challenge relates to the need to shift the loyalty of the military from the KMT to the Taiwanese state and the incumbent government. Another challenge in Taiwan a nd also in South Korea and Thailand is to delineate the proper role of the military in security policymaking. The divestment of military-owned enterprises in all these countries is another major concern. In Indonesia and Bangladesh, the concern is to ensure civilian supremacy across a broad spectrum of issues and, even more urgently, to prevent a military coup. In China and to a lesser degree in Vietnam, the concern is with maintaining military loyalty and party supremacy over the military. Divesting the military from its business enterprises is also a major concern in China. The problem in Pakistan is multifaceted and centers on the military's overwhelming domination of state and society. In Burma, there is no civil-military problem in the conventional sense, but there is the concern of the military government to maintain control over the military institution, especially the field commanders. There is, of course, a larger civil-military problem rooted in the conflicting desire of the military to continue its dominant political position and that of a large segment of the population to move toward a democratic political system. The above list is not exhaustive, and the nature of the civil-military problem in each country is much more complex and multifaceted than depicted. The purpose here is to provide an indication of the salience and diverse nature of the civil-military problem in Asia. THE CHANGING NATURE OF CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS IN ASIA As demonstrated by developments during the past two decades in Pakistan, Indonesia, North Korea, Taiwan, South Korea, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and China, the relationship between and among the institutions that are the containers of state political power\n\nII\n\nI2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand those that manage state coercion are in the midst of substantive and in some cases fundamental change. Change is more pronounced in states undergoing political system transformation. In these countries, the redefinition of civil-military relations is in many ways a struggle among competing political and military elites over the scope, jurisdiction, and role of the military in the structure of political domination as well as the issue of civilian control over the military in other key arenas. Though less dramatic, civil-military relations are also undergoing change in the other countries, including established democracies such as India andJapan. As the chapters in this book make clear, the nature and intensity of the struggle and change vary from country to country and span a wide spectrum.\n\nChange in Democratic States The military establishments in Japan and India continue to submit to democratic civilian controL Political changes in these countries as well as changes in the missions and roles of the military, however, appear to be altering the basis for this subordination as well as the content, though not the pattern of their civil-military relations. In Japan, the changing domestic political landscape as well as the altered international security situation and the growing role of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in coping with natural disasters, in international peacekeeping, in the defense of Japan, and in providing international security in the Far East are contributing to the rehabilitation of the military, increasing its legitimacy, and possibly also raising its social and political standing, thus altering the purpose and basis for civilian control of the military. Eiichi Katahara (see Chapter 2) identifies three important changes in civil-military relations in Japan: from bureaucratic to political control of the SDF, the increasing stature and power of the SDF vis-a-vis other ministries and agencies, and popular acceptance of the SDF. Based on these changes, he argues that civil-military relations in Japan are moving from containment of the military to a more normal democratic pattern of civil-military relations. In the case of India, it is argued that weakening political institutions and the increased internal security role of the Indian armed forces are altering and possibly eroding the basis for civilian supremacy and that concordance or subjective civilian control rather than objective civilian control increasingly characterizes civil-military relations in India (Cohen rggoa; Ganguly rggra; Kukreja rggr; Schiff 1995). Sumit Ganguly (rggra) argued that repeated use of the army to quell communal violence would politicize it and erode the army's long-standing tradition of political neutrality. Sunil Dasgupta (see Chapter 3) argues that the military's growing internal security role has undermined democratic civilian control at the local level and increased the friction between the civilian bureaucracy and the military. As examples of civil-military friction he cites the dismissal of naval chief Admiral Bhagwat and the military's efforts to reject domination by the civilian bureaucracy. H e goes on to argue, however, that friction with the civilian bureaucracy and the growing internal security role are unlikely to undermine civilian control over the military at the national level, which is shifting from bureaucratic control to control by democratically elected political leaders. In his view, the growing \"militarization\" of the political, technical, and administrative leadership, which blurs the civil-military divide, poses the greater threat to substantive (as opposed to formal institutional) democratic civilian control of the military in India.\n\nIntroduction Consolidation qf Democratic Civilian Control Civil-military relations in South Korea and Taiwan have been fundamentally transformed from an authoritarian to a democratic pattern. The military in South Korea has almost completely disengaged from politics, and the prospect of a coup appears rather remote. The election of long-time opposition leader Kim Dae-jung as the first minority president in 1997 and the military's support for his sunshine policy, which it initially viewed as appeasement of North Korea, are indicative of the distance that has been traveled in a short time. President Kim Young-sam, the first elected civilian prime minister of South Korea, took a series of decisive measures that effectively discredited the military and reduced its power and prerogatives (Luckham 1996a: 220-22). These measures included the purge of a large number of the senior members of the powerful Hana faction; removal of more than twenty senior generals, including the chief of staff, for alleged corruption; and the prosecution of Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, former generals turned president, for their role in the suppression of the 1980 Kwangju \"prodemocracy\" uprising. The military promotion and assignment system has also been overhauled, although regional and school ties still continue to be a factor. The power and role of the various security and intelligence agencies, which now come under the control of civilians, have been seriously curtailed. Nevertheless, there are still a few issues-the strong influence of the military in making security policy, for example, and the institutions and procedures for civilian oversight of the military- that must be redefined and developed (Moon 1989) (see Chapter 4). The continuation of the North Korean threat and lack of civilian expertise explain in part the continued domination of the security policy arena by serving and retired generals. However, even here there has been substantial change. The making of security policy is no longer the exclusive turf of the military: It is now the responsibility of the National Security Council (NSC) chaired by the president. Half the NSC members are civilian ministers, and the other half are retired generals in ministerial appointments. Similarly, in Taiwan, democratic civilian control of the military has been strengthened since 1987. There has been a definite though still incomplete shift from Kuomintang (KMT) party control to control of the military by the democratically elected state executive and legislature (Chapter 5). Concurrently, the mission and role of the military have altered as well. The internal security role (which included protecting the KMT's political dominance) came to an end with the lifting of martial law in 1987 and the dissolution of Taiwan Garrison Command in 1992. The primary military role now is in external defense. Military penetration of state and society has decreased as well, and the military is also gradually disengaging from several key business enterprises, including that in mass media. Notwithstanding the advances made in democratic civilian control of the military, there are still a number of challenges, primarily in the areas of security policymaking and oversight of the military as an institution. The military has resisted the appointment of a civilian defense minister, and it has been reluctant to submit to legislative oversight on m atters like arms procurement. Nevertheless, as pointed out in Chapter 5, considerable progress has been made to increase the transparency and accountability of the military and its activities. The National Defense Law that came into force on January 29, 2000, should help further streamline and strengthen democratic civilian control of the military.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThere is still the concern as to whether the military would be subservient to a non-KMT government. The election and inauguration in May 2000 of President Chen Shui-bian of the proindependence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the pledge of allegiance of the military to the democratically elected president have ameliorated this concern but not eliminated it. Chen could not make major changes to the national security team. All senior national security positions-premier, secretary-general of the National Security Council, defense minister, and head of the National Security Agency-went to former military officers. Seeking to enhance confidence in his government and control the prounification military, Chen appointed Tang Fei, a retired general who had been chief of the general staff and defense minister in the Lee Teng-hui government, as premier. Though Chen was not pressured to make these appointments, the induction of former senior military officers underscores the privilege still enjoyed by the military establishment and the president's keenness to retain the loyalty of the military. In Taiwan, as in many other consolidating democracies, enhancement of democratic civilian control of the military has progressed in an incremental fashion. Continued consolidation, however, would require more institutional reform, further redefinition of the military mission and role, and development of civilian expertise to enable elected and bureaucratic civilian officials to exercise effective oversight over military institutions and activities.\n\nTransition to Democratic Civilian Control The military in the Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Indonesia has also disengaged from politics. However, in contrast to South Korea and Taiwan, military disengagement from politics in these countries is still incomplete and tentative. In the Philippines, the structure of civilian control of the state's coercive apparatus underwent dramatic change following the ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos in Ig86. The Aquino era was characterized by a spate of unsuccessful coups by politicized agents within the state coercive apparatus and by widespread militarization of society. In the latter part of the Aquino administration and the succeeding Ramos administration, a number of politicized officers entered electoral politics. This trend \"peaked and then subsided in tandem with the rise and fall of the Ramos administration\" (Chapter 6). The military as an institution became resubordinated to democratic institutions. Orlando Mercado, an anti-Marcos activist and environmentalist with no military background, was appointed defense minister by President joseph Estrada, and civilian-political considerations appear to dominate security policymaking. The Police Constabulary has been removed from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chain of command. Redesignated the Philippine National Police, it is now under the control of the Department of the Interior and Local Government. The national legislature has reinstituted the Commission on Appointments and other congressional committees to exercise oversight of the military and police forces. Concurrently, the AFP's role has been redefined. Though it still has the responsibility to fight the remnants of the Maoist and Muslim armed rebellions, its primary responsibility now is external defense. The Philippine military as an institution seemed to be firmly under the control of elected officials. Democratic civilian control of the military in the Philippines seemed to be more advanced than in the other countries investigated in the democratic transition category. This notion was quashed by the dramatic defection of the entire leadership of the Philippine arm ed forces to join the massive protest rally- dubbed People Power 11- of the\n\nIntroduction middle class, the radical left, and the poor that led to the ouster of President Estrada on January 20, 2001. Estrada, the populist ex- movie star and alienated vice-president of President Fidel R amos, was elected to the presidency in rgg8 with a huge majority. Beginning in mid-2000, his administration was beleaguered by allegations of corruption. Estrada himself was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of corruption. The Senate trial that began in December was brought to an abrupt halt on January r6, 20or, when the Senate refused to consider evidence that Estrada had amassed funds under a false name. This sparked a massive \"People Power\" rally that was joined by the leadership of the armed forces. Gen. Angelo Reyes, chief of the armed forces, declared to the protesters: \"On behalf of the r3o,ooo members of the Armed Forces, I would like to announce that we are withdrawing support from the president.\" 9 The Philippine military leadership, in collusion with retired generals such as former general and president Fidel Ramos, claims to have acted in a guardian role \"to protect the people and the state\" from Estrada, who the military alleged was ruining the country. The failure of the constitutional process to deal with the charges leveled against Estrada and the defection of the military leadership raise serious questions about the state of democracy and civilian control of the military in the Philippines. Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo-who was sworn in as president on January 20, much like Corazon Aquino was sworn in after the ouster of President Marcos in 1986-stands on shaky ground, with the competing forces that put her in office demanding payoffs. For example, to accommodate former president Ramos, Arroyo fired the national security advisor she had appointed only four days earlier and replaced him with Gen. Lisandro Abadia, who is a close ally of Ramos. This appointment sparked the resignation of Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who had been a close ally of Estrada and a member of his cabinet but subsequently defected. Mercado had initiated investigations against Abadia for improperly securing interest-free loans for two firms at which he was a board member. There is also an internal struggle within the military to determine the successor to General Reyes. Meanwhile, concerned with plots inside and outside the military to destabilize her government, Arroyo has been courting the military with tax exemptions, bigger budgets, and other benefits in an effort to consolidate military support for her fledgling and troubled administration. 10 Though expedient, the unconstitutional role played by the military in the ouster of Estrada and its subsequent muscle flexing are major setbacks for democracy and democratic civilian control of the military. However, a reversal of democratic rule is unlikely. There still is strong public opposition in the Philippines to any form of authoritarian rule in which the military can play a key role. The Thai, Bangladesh, and Indonesian militaries continue to retain formal or informal political influence and, in varying degree, seek to preserve institutional and professional autonomy, limit civilian involvement in security policymaking, and preserve their commercial interests. In Thailand, after the 1992 shooting of prodemocracy demonstrators and the showdown that led to the resignation of Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon (briefly the unelected prime minister), the military vowed not to launch another coup. It responded to the 1997 economic crisis not by launching a coup, as in earlier eras, but by facilitating the passage of a new constitution in September 1997 and helping to bring about a change in government in November of that year. It was reported that Gen. Chetta Thanajaro played a key role in the resignation of\n\nIS\n\nI6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPrime Minister (and former army chief) Chavalit Yongchaiyuth in favor of Chuan Leepkai, leader of the Democratic Party, and his respected economic team. The military is seeking new ways of influence. Though direct intervention will be opposed, there is considerable public support for \"behind the scene roles\" as in 1997. Also, retired generals are entering politics by contesting elections. More than 30 former senior military officers contested the January 6, 20or, election, and the new Thaksin Shintawara cabinet has a few ex-generals, including retired general and former prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyuth, who has been appointed defense minister. Democratic civilian control of the Thai military has been on the ascendan ce and, in contrast to earlier periods, this process has been considerably aided by the I997 economic crisis. For the first time, the post of defense minister was held by a civilian (Prime Minister Chuan Leepkai), and active duty officers and bureaucrats have been barred from holding cabinet positions. The Thai military has begun to submit to civilian (executive and parliamentary) scrutiny of promotions, budgets, and procurement. Its illegal cross-border trading activities have been substantially curtailed through the liberalization of trade with neighboring countries, and its off-budget revenues are coming under greater scrutiny. However, the military is far from giving up its institutional and professional autonomy, its influence in security policymaking, its developmental role, or its business interests. It is pertinent to observe here that although the Thai military facilitated the passage of the new constitution, it also lobbied hard to ensure that the new constitution authorized and legitimized its developmental role and excluded a specific clause that would have made coups illegal. It is quite possible that these and other reforms may be stalled under the Thaksin government. Defense Minister Chavalit had been previously opposed to what he termed \"civilian interference in military matters\" like arms procurement. Redefinition of the relationship of the military to the state, which began in I973 and became more marked after I992, as observed byJames Ockey (Chapter 7), h as been a struggle, punctuated by periodic contestation, including resorting to violence. In Bangladesh, the military has chosen to steer an apolitical course since the ouster of President (formerly general) H. M. Ershad in Iggo. The relationship of the soldier to the state, however, is still unsettled as civilian governments attempt to increase their control over the military and the latter seeks to ensure its corporate interests are protected. The deep cleavages in political society and the volatile nature of politics in Bangladesh, as well as the efforts of political parties to attract military support, provide the military with leverage and opportunity to reassert itself in politics as it did in the rgg6 incident. On the other hand, the development of civil society and changes in international norms constrain the Bangladesh military- giving rise to a situation in which the military is unlikely to intervene directly but exercises considerable influence informally. There is clear indication of increasing civilian control of the military: the position of defense minister is held by a civilian (the prime minister), the prime minister appoints the service chiefs, and civilians now control the intelligence agencies. However, civilian governments have had to adjust their policies as well to accommodate the institutional interests of the military and its policy demands- leading to a situation characterized by Amena Mohsin (Chapter 8) as \"uneasy accommodation.\" In the case of Indonesia, as noted earlier, the civil-military balance has tilted against the military, and state-soldier relations are in the midst of substantial change. President Wahid was\n\nIntroduction initially able to increase civilian control of the military well beyond most optimistic assessments through a series of measures, including rotation and appointment of reform-minded officers to key senior positions in the TNI, empha"
