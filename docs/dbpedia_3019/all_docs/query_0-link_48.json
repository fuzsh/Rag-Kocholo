The conference, and this volume, received generous financial and logistical support from a wide range of organisations, including the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS) at the ANU. The conference attracted speakers and representatives from numerous universities and research centres in Australia and overseas. We would like to thank a number of people for their contributions. The conference was organised by Bob Lowry of the Australian Defence Force Academy, who brought together a diverse and eminent group of scholars. Valuable support was provided by Karen Nulty, Liz Drysdale, Irish van der Hoek and Lynn Moir of the Indonesia Project in the Division of Economics, RSPAS, as well as by a small group of Indonesian and Australian students. Particular thanks are due to Dr Chris Manning, Head of the Indonesian Project, and the session coordinators, Bob El son, Robert Cribb and Howard Dick. This volume is published by the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), Singapore, in what is now a traditional arrangement. We greatly appreciate the involvement of ISEAS , especially its Managing Editor, Triena Ong, in the publication of the book. The manuscript was deftly and expertly prepared by Beth Thomson, and the index was compiled by Jean Kennedy. Finally, we appreciate the efforts of all contributors who drafted and revised their papers in order to meet a very demanding publishing deadline. In particular, we are grateful for the contribution of Emeritus Professor John Legge. He has written widely on Indonesian history and his thoughts presented here in this volume set the scene for the thoughtful perspectives on Indonesian political, economic and social history that follow.

Lloyd and Shannon L. Smith\n\nIt is indeed timely, given the wide-ranging changes and pressures in Indonesia in the last few years and the transition to a new century , that illumination is cast not merely on recent events but on seminal issues and episodes in Indonesia’s social, political and economic history. The task of this volume is therefore doubly difficult: charged with surveying the past, it must also provide an ‘update’ of recent events in the conventional sense. What it offers, then, is a study of selected aspects of the past. This incorporates analysis of political parties and parliament, the role of ideology , the Leftist movement, political leadership and women’ s status in Indonesian society , as well as trends in poverty, economic directions, visions of the future, survival of the empire, rebellions against and aspects of central control and definitions of the state and influences on its development. It is not a history of Indonesia, because such a task would require more scholars and more space than the confines of this volume permit, and because Indonesia is replete with much history awaiting ‘discovery’ and recording in areas that have so far eluded the gaze of scholars. The events of the last three or four years in Indonesia have sparked critical assessment and rethinking in all sectors by foreign and indigenous observers alike. The Philippines-style people’s power movement that helped throw Soeharto from of fice in May 1998 has since broken up into disparate and often disor ganised social and political movements and factions. The widespread expectation of the emergence of a new system of political stability accompanied by a vibrant civil society has been hamstrung by a plethora of factors. The June 1999 general election was Indonesia’ s first democratic parliamentary election since 1955 and provided a tremendous fillip to the aspirations of millions of disenfranchised citizens who wished to play a part in their nation’s destiny. However, the difficulties of implementing a democratic structure and adhering to a democratic ethos after a sustained and perva1\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:46 AM\n\n2\n\nPage 2\n\nGRAYSON J. LLOYD AND SHANNON L. SMITH\n\nsive period of authoritarianism have been reinforced overwhelmingly under the faltering administration of Abdurrahman Wahid (known affectionately as Gus Dur). Allegations of corruption and financial and legal impropriety have been levelled at this administration as the once ubiquitous ‘collusion, corruption and nepotism’ (KKN) chant has again infiltrated the political scene and exacerbated the machinations and personality politics of Indonesia’ s divided political elite. More fundamentally, there remain the problems of reforming the banking and legal systems, refining the operation of political parties, attracting foreign investment and maintaining national unity. The implementation of the decentralisation laws 22 and 25 promulgated in 1999 is a huge administrative and political responsibility. But problems persist on a number of fronts, including the task of dealing with the communal unrest in Maluku province, the escalating presence of radical Islam, the need to formulate ef fective human rights legislation and deal with abuses of the past, and the manner of handling the increasingly vociferous calls for independence in Papua and Aceh. While Aceh and Papua are distinct case studies, they are to some extent united in spirit by East Timor’s independence and by a history of brutal repression and exclusion, particularly under the New Order . The increased, indeed proactive, role of the People’s Representative Council (DPR) in the era after Soeharto has also contributed to the sustained scrutiny of the government and the executive. This is a positive move, because too often in the past the converse applied and the result was a ‘floating mass’ form of political participation where people only participated when they were told to do so. But it should not be forgotten that in this transitional phase, one of Indonesia’ s greatest challenges is to attain ef fective leadership however unrealistic (or deterministic) this may be. This leadership must be capable of engendering the confidence and the patience of a real constituency demanding overnight reformasi; and capable, too, of maintaining national unity for the term of its natural life against xenophobic nationalism and exponents of destabilisation. In its tumultuous journey in the post-Soeharto era, Indonesia has therefore been confronted with a pot-holed road of problems and issues often requiring immediate or, more challengingly, definitive resolution. However, to surmise that the vast array of problems placed before the Habibie reform cabinet and its successor, the cabinet of national unity of Abdurrahman Wahid, are amenable to easy resolution is grossly to misunderstand the nature of Indonesia and the complexity, paradox, infinite variety and capacity for ideological and intellectual contortion of its history . As the chapters in this volume indicate, there is little that Indonesia and the Indonesian people have not experienced in the past and, at the same time, there is much to confront that is new (in whatever context), or different, or simply a solution to problems and issues borne of the past.\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:46 AM\n\nPage 3\n\nTHOUGHTS ON INDONESIAN HISTORY\n\n3\n\nThe purpose of each of the chapters in this volume, although distinct in style and methodology, is manifest. Each has attempted to resurrect particular aspects of the past – certain events, images, protests, beliefs, correlations and practices all of which impact on perceptions of the present and expectations for the future. This volume therefore houses a myriad of themes. If there is a benang merah, one underlying current, then it is Indonesia’s struggle with the concept of being a truly inclusive nation, and its inability to invest real meaning in the slogan ‘Unity in Diversity’ (Bhinneka tunggal Ika). But this underlying current has a number of corollaries. The closest is Indonesia’s inability to fashion an acceptable sense of national identity that is consistent with principles which have emerged from its history of struggle. But other corollaries are easily distinguishable. These relate to the struggle for equality faced by women, minority ethnic groups and the economically disadvantaged, the distrust of plurality, the wholesomeness of community, the apparently paradoxical acceptance and rejection of change, and the propensity for political conservatism to emerge after periods of great social or political change and violence. Coterminous with these is the subjugation of class (the money and power accumulation of the ruling class excepted), the condemnation and adoration of ideological and cultural deviation, and a seemingly boundless capacity for renewal and revival. The Indonesian nation and people constitute such a large and inaccessible canvas that ‘W estern’-imposed constructs such as santri, priyayi, abangan or aliran, and others such as Feith’s ‘administrators’ and ‘solidarity-makers’, while useful tools, are rarely capable of revealing the whole story. This book is unique in the Indonesia Assessment series in that it is dedicated to studies of Indonesian history and thus presents a distinct blend of writing on contemporary events and historical issues. It also sets a precedent with the inclusion of a short concluding chapter . The chapters contained in this volume, apart from the economic and political updates of recent events in Part I, address various periods in Indonesia’ s history, many offering a comparison between different eras and current events. The seven chapters in Part II address a compelling range of issues seminal to political history . The contributions in Part III provide a survey of key issues in Indonesia’ s economic history. Those in Part IV address a diverse range of issues germane to social history. The political, economic and social history sections are each introduced by ‘Brief Reflections’ – written by Bob Elson, Howard Dick and Robert Cribb respectively – which have been included in the numbering of the chapters and highlight significant events, challenges, and key periods and issues in the respective fields. Part V, ‘Indonesia’s History Unfolding’, offers a brief reflection on the status and nature of Indonesian history and the historical process. After delivering the historian’ s caveat that ‘history will tell us that the\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:46 AM\n\nPage 4\n\n4\n\nGRAYSON J. LLOYD AND SHANNON L. SMITH\n\nfuture is likely to be unexpected’, John Legge proffers in Chapter 2 a nuanced study of key themes, periods and scholars in Indonesian history. He highlights the speed of change in events in Indonesia during the revolutionary period and the several decades that followed, the emergence of the landmark scholarship published by Kahin, Feith and others, and the mood shift from optimism to pessimism after the turbulence of the 1950s. He notes the sometimes ambiguous influence of Western terminology on the Indonesian political and cultural landscape and the obfuscation resulting from the meshing of indigenous and externally imposed constructs. He closes with a reflection on the ongoing tensions of the motto ‘Unity in Diversity’ emerging from Indonesia’s awkward transition to an artificial nationhood. Drawing attention to the continuation of patrimonial forms in the ‘modern’ Soeharto state, he also questions the subdued focus on violence in writing on Indonesian history against a more pervasive focus on (internationally acceptable) ideals of harmony and syncretism. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS In Chapter 3 Marcus Mietzner analyses a series of key issues troubling Indonesia under the administration of President Abdurrahman Wahid. His chapter focuses on institutional reform, separatism and local autonomy , the position of the military, legal reform, political parties and the political economy. He argues that the ability to deal with the complexity of these issues is contingent upon the strengthening of the country’ s political framework. One of the problems is what he terms the ‘collectively cultivated constituency cronyism’ manifested in the fight for control over economic assets between the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) and the National Mandate Party (PAN). The rampant political conflict among the elite has resulted in the neglect of crucial institutional, legal and military reform and the subordination of fundamental issues of constitutional reform, thus exacerbating institutionalised political instability . It is precisely this problem of institutionalised political disorder, he argues, which obstructs the process of economic recovery and threatens the possibilities of continued democratisation. Kelly Bird presents an economic overview of Indonesia’ s prospects in Chapter 4. His title notwithstanding, his prognosis on the whole appears rather optimistic. He points to the buoyancy given to the economic recovery of the last 12 months or so by the recovery in consumer spending and export growth, particularly the rise in non-oil manufacturing exports. But Bird also points to one problem Indonesia has experienced, at least since the events of May 1998: the need to restart investment to sustain medium-term economic\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:46 AM\n\nPage 5\n\nTHOUGHTS ON INDONESIAN HISTORY\n\n5\n\nrecovery. The nexus between political and economic problems is clear when one views not only the incomplete corporate debt restructuring process and the fragility of the banking sector , but also the uncertainty of the application of the rule of law and the tenuous political environment. POLITICAL HISTORY Bob Elson’s introduction to the political history section encapsulates some of the challenges for historians writing on Indonesia’ s political history. There is a significant need, he says, for historians to research Indonesian politics in all of its depth and infinite variety and with a seriousness of purpose so far lacking in the discipline. This disinterested application to the task of serious historians can produce fertile results and assist greatly in providing answers to a myriad of unanswered yet seminal questions in Indonesian history . Adrian Vickers argues in Chapter 6 that those who write about Indonesia’s history need to come to terms with the realities of Indonesia’s past in their representations of the present. He is interested in the varying and often contradictory ways in which the New Order has been portrayed.The New Order was a government of appearances, but was it ‘the state’dominating over society or was it Soeharto? The New Order state, he posits, was many things at the same time – it was a rentier or plunderer state; an asal bapak senang (ABS) state; a criminal state; a capitalist state; a military–bureaucratic state; and it was, in a sense, a reincarnation of the Dutch colonial state. In short, it was an aberra tion perpetuated by the Cold War, and it was surprising that it lasted as long as it did. Furthermore, ‘due to the longevity of its appearance of order and control under one man’, it stood out in the region against all comparisons, Myanmar excepted. And finally, he ar gues, it attempted to uniformalise Indonesia’s historical diversity, deny its heterogeneity and internal contradictions or unsavoury aspects, and present a sanitised version for international (and domestic) consumption. Angus McIntyre follows in Chapter 7 with an analysis of the middle way leadership concept. Indonesia’ s survival as a ‘voluntary association’, he posits, is contingent upon the type of leadership it receives. Strong leadership, characterised by moralism, divisiveness and political division, thrives in an authoritarian system. But in the post-Soeharto era the Indonesian people have endorsed a nascent democratic system for which adherence to middle way leadership, and its af finity with civic nationalism and inclusive politics, is required. The dangers for Indonesia’s future are evident in the events of the past. As McIntyre asserts, when the middle way partnership of Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta collapsed in 1956, Sukarno became more associated with certain ethnic and political groups within the nation rather than identifying\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:46 AM\n\n6\n\nPage 6\n\nGRAYSON J. LLOYD AND SHANNON L. SMITH\n\nwith the nation itself. In terms of learning from the middle way precedent, Abdurrahman Wahid’s beginning was not auspicious. One can simply hope that the lessons of Abdurrahman’s grab for political power can be absorbed and that his reputation for tolerance is rekindled in a structure of middle way leadership needed at this time of great national fragility . In his chapter surveying the function of parties and parliament in historical perspective, Greg Fealy draws several interesting conclusions. He ar gues that individual leaders, because of their almost cult status, dominate modern parties to a much greater extent today than was the case four decades ago. Ideological and policy disputes are less a part of party activities in the post-Soeharto era, whereas money in party politics and physical intimidation are much more a part. Moreover, the linkage between parties and a nation’s intellectual life was much stronger in the 1950s than today . The changes with respect to parliament are no less considerable, he asserts. This is because of at least three factors: the increased role of the DPR in relation to the executive in the postSoeharto era; the greater involvement of the DPR in presidential appointments; and the parliament’ s reassertion of its rights of interpellation of the executive. But, he suggests, some key questions remain, notably pertaining to legislative initiative and the representational capacity of MPs. Together with other factors, these are of prime concern to an electorate vastly more inter ested and involved in the political process since the downfall of Soeharto. In Chapter 9, the first of two papers in the volume dealing with aspects of political ideology, David Bourchier traces the evolution of political conservatism through phases of romantic traditionalism, corporatist anti-partyism and the New Order ’s ‘integralist developmentalism’. He addresses the issue of whether political conservatism may be about to enter a fourth phase, because so many figures who were products of the New Order political environment remain in place and are obstructing the process of reform. Such a phase would be likely to have much in common with those that have gone before it, with an emphasis on elite dominance militating against mass participation in politics, and an appeal to unity based on an idealisation of the communalistic and harmonistic elements of traditional Indonesian culture. Whether, or to what extent, this so-termed fourth phase is manifested will depend greatly on the ability of the Abdurrahman administration to free itself of New Order ideology and construct a more inclusive and heterogeneous concept of nationhood. The ethos of Goenawan Mohamad’ s chapter, ‘Remembering the Left’, is encapsulated in his opening vignette focusing on a courageous meeting in June 1996 of the Democratic People’s Party (PRD) where, under the threat of arrest, young PRD activists upheld their right to oppose the injustices of the Soeharto regime. In this chapter Goenawan explores the meaning and role of the Left in Indonesian political culture and society, particularly in the relative\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:46 AM\n\nPage 7\n\nTHOUGHTS ON INDONESIAN HISTORY\n\n7\n\nfreedom afforded in the post-Soeharto era. He notes how the Left became a statement of opposition for many who grew up during the New Order , often expressed in art and culture. He also indicates that the new Left, in many respects detached from the Left of the past, is a disillusioned ideological force and politically impotent. But the legacy of the massacres of communist supporters in 1965–66 still haunts Indonesian society , to such a degree that Abdurrahman Wahid’s suggestion to revoke the 1966 decision by the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR) outlawing the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the dissemination of Marxist–Leninist ideology was met with much rancorous opposition. However, the president’s efforts at political reconciliation reverberate with meaning beyond politics – they are representative of efforts to come to terms with Indonesia’ s sometimes bloody and unjust past. As Goenawan asserts, part of the problem with such a task is to develop a way of achieving reconciliation that is as inclusive of as many elements of society as possible. This will require moral leadership within the elite together with a willingness to distribute justice free from the exigencies of the present and the prejudices of the past. In Chapter 11, Atmadji Sumarkidjo addresses the relevance of the Indonesian military (TNI) at this important crossroads of reformasi and change. His study examines the machinations within the military leadership ( pimpinan TNI) during the New Order period, and President Soeharto’ s checkerboardlike manipulation of one individual and or ganisation against another in order to preserve his power. He argues that Soeharto became increasingly authoritarian during his time in power, ultimately interfering in TNI personnel issues and appointments to such an extent that the TNI was completely subordinated to his wishes and excluded from the reins of political power by the time he fell from office. In the post-Soeharto era, Atmadji argues, the TNI has struggled to play an effective role in Indonesian society and politics amidst increasing and widespread calls for reform and change, notably from within its own ranks. He concludes by touching on the need for the provision of an adequate budget for the TNI to help cut back on the historical military/business linkage, the importance of thorough-going doctrinal revision within the TNI, and the necessity for greater investment in high-calibre training for the new generation of officers. Richard Chauvel’s chapter on the changing dynamics of regional resistance argues, in part, that the Indonesian nation has struggled to retain its diversity and as a consequence its unity has suf fered. He highlights General Nasution’s efforts in the 1950s and early 1960s to establish unity and security throughout Indonesia against the background of widespread regionalist and secessionist campaigns, and focuses on the dynamics of the rebellions inAceh and Ambon in the 1950s. During the New Order the struggle for unity and security took on a more brutal aspect as the people of Aceh and Papua in par-\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:46 AM\n\nPage 8\n\n8\n\nGRAYSON J. LLOYD AND SHANNON L. SMITH\n\nticular became estranged from the Indonesian ‘family’. Underlying his ar gument is the assertion that while history, religion and ethnicity have been used by regional protagonists to enunciate their causes, changing cultural, economic and political norms also mould the form of resistance to the authority of Jakarta. The loss of East Timor has, he says, underlined the challenge for the administration of Abdurrahman Wahid: to fuse the democratic and nationalistic imperatives in order to maintain the integrity of Indonesia. ECONOMIC HISTORY In introducing the section, Howard Dick reflects on how the study of Indonesian economic history is finally coming of age. He argues that the New Order focused its attention on economic development for the future, to the detriment of learning from the economic failures of the Sukarno and Dutch colonial eras. As one of the keys to understanding the Indonesia of today is to consider history, Dick suggests that the economic policy-makers of today pay heed to the past. Thee Kian Wie in Chapter 14 examines the political economy cycle of the New Order, from the economic crisis of the mid-1960s through to the ‘miracle economy’ characterised by high economic growth and targeted restructuring of the mid-1980s and 1990s – an episode much lauded by the international community – and the eventual slide into a ‘melt-down economy’, leading to the political and social unrest that caused the downfall of President Soeharto. Thee highlights the New Order ’s positive economic achievements – rapid economic growth led to structural changes in terms of a shift of production from agriculture to manufacturing and services, and greater importance was placed on foreign trade – as well as the corresponding social benefits arising from higher standards of living. He also dwells on the negative aspects of economic development – including unequal income distribution, urban–rural and regional disparities, and the degradation and depletion of environmental resources. Thee argues that the New Order’s political legitimacy was based on its economic performance and ability to deliver rising standards of living for the people. But at the same time, the New Order was marked by restricted competition, monopolies, favoured treatment and KKN practices. It was these abuses, then, that undermined the New Order’s political legitimacy, leading to economic downturn and Soeharto’s eventual fall from power. Pierre van der Eng looks at the Indonesian economy from a long-term perspective in Chapter 15. He challenges the usual assumption that Indonesia was until recently a development failure by showing that its long-term growth performance has in fact been impressive, if uneven. By Western standards, and in the context of 20th centuryAsia, Indonesian economic growth has been\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 9\n\nTHOUGHTS ON INDONESIAN HISTORY\n\n9\n\nhigh. Van der Eng demonstrates that this economic growth was accompanied by significant improvements in standards of living, through all strata of Indonesian society. Howard Dick takes as his starting point the current interest in institutional development and the suggestion that economic development cannot be sustained by fragile political, economic and social institutions and systems. Dick outlines Indonesian economic and political development during the 20th century and attempts to provide an understanding of their patterns of interaction. He argues that one of the lessons of the Asian crisis is that economic development needs to be supported by institutional development; the question for Indonesia is whether its politicians have the political will and skill to foster that development. In Chapter 17, Wihana Kirana Jaya and Howard Dick offer a study of institutional reform in centre–region relations, of particular relevance given the moves towards decentralisation of central government functions since 1999. They assert that Indonesia has followed a zigzag pattern between decentralisation and centralisation since the colonial government’s Decentralisation Law in 1903. The sudden reversal of half a century of centralisation has witnessed a diminution in powers for the provinces and a restoration of certain powers and revenues to the local government level. Theoretically, the proposed political, administrative and fiscal decentralisation will bring government closer to the people. In practice, however , the new arrangements are likely to emphasise administrative rather than political reform, with the central government retaining ultimate decision-making power in national budget policy . Moreover, implementation of the process will be complicated by money politics, absence of the rule of law, the need for effective guidance by civil society and the other wide-ranging problems currently faced by Indonesia. SOCIAL HISTORY Robert Cribb’s ‘Brief Reflections on Indonesian Social History’ identifies three key axes germane to tracking the evolution of social history and changes in Indonesia. These are the axes of mobility and immobility , social rigidity and social flux, and isolation and cosmopolitanism. In the post-Soeharto era, he argues, the challenge for social historians is to understand how change is occurring and where it is leading Indonesia, and to deal with this change and associated factors within a more intellectually rigorous framework. Underlying M.C. Ricklefs’ novel topic, ‘Indonesian Visions of the Future’, is a complex historical survey . In brief, Ricklefs posits in Chapter 19 that ‘volatility is a legacy of Indonesian searches for a better future’. Such searches have been underpinned by a series of recurrent themes. These are,\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\n10\n\nPage 10\n\nGRAYSON J. LLOYD AND SHANNON L. SMITH\n\nnotably, the beliefs that the past was better than the present and that a better future will revive the benefits of an idealised past; that ways of realising a better future have provoked dispute, sometimes violent in nature; and that various leadership groups and individuals have consistently failed to deliver the promised better future. From such a legacy Indonesians have been imbued with a distrust of institutions and political leadership, and a willingness to experiment with vastly dif ferent forms of ideology and leadership. Furthermore, Indonesia’s history has been one of constant flux, with certain ideas and concepts – such as federalism, party politics, the Islamic state, the Leftist movement or the ideology of Pancasila – rising and falling and perhaps in some cases rising again according to their currency in the political and social milieu. Ricklefs concludes with the hope that the failures of Indonesia’ s past do not discredit the notion of Indonesia. In Chapter 20, Greg Barton presents a timely analysis of the role of Islam, both politically and socially , in Abdurrahman Wahid’s Indonesia. He ar gues that three things suggest at face value that Islam is operating as an anti-modern force stymieing the move to liberal democracy . The first is the ‘ santrification’ of Indonesian society , evident for some years. The second is the relevance of Islam in Indonesia’s political life as a force, or phalanx of forces, criticising the Gus Dur administration. The third is the extent of communal unrest and violence, which is a reminder of the significance of Islam. Barton points to the involvement of extremist ‘religious’ groups in what are as much political as religious or communal events in Maluku as indications of a worrying trend. He argues, however, that the Islamisation process need not challenge Indonesia’s moderatism and pluralism, and that santrification, for instance, has contributed not only to greater piety but also to greater tolerance. The progressive liberal ideas and emphasis on education of massive Islamic organisations such as the NU, previously headed by Abdurrahman Wahid, have reinforced this process. Radical Islamists, or those who would vote in a general election for an exclusively Islamic agenda, are overwhelmingly in the minority. Their threat is nonetheless real because, as Barton argues, their policies and the publicity they receive can be manipulated by competing factions within the Indonesian elite. The future is bright given the standing of National Awakening Party (PKB) traditionalists and liberal modernist santri, but violence can always emerge from narrow sectarianism. Philip Kitley argues in Chapter 21 that the development of the media in Indonesia has been marred by bans and repression. The New Order government tried to enforce control over the media through restrictive legislation and the corporatisation of professional journalists, as well as threats and acts of retribution against certain individuals or or ganisations who challenged the maintenance of national law and order , cultural values and (the New Order created) identity. In the mid-1980s, he says, the focus of the government’s use\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 11\n\nTHOUGHTS ON INDONESIAN HISTORY\n\n11\n\nof the media switched from motivating the people for development to an emphasis on the Pancasila media project with its focus on indigenous values. The government sought to erase the boundaries between itself and the people by speaking of the nation as a family and portraying those who espoused alternative discourses as challenging the idea of an inclusive Indonesian family to which all speakers belonged. Predictably, the ideological gap between media producers and the idealised role constructed for them by the state resulted in the failure of the government’ s program. Professional media exponents reserved the right to write against the dominant paradigm and were exposed through their work to alternative views and concepts.This exposure, and these ideas, gradually filtered through to the population at large. In conclusion, Kitley argues that freedom of the press needs to be understood as a right to be informed, to ask questions and to deal with dif ficult issues. Those in the media, and the public they serve, have the right to make their own choices and form their own opinions free from government manipulation. In Chapter 22 Susan Blackburn notes that aspects of gender inequality in Indonesia have most often been identified by or ganised, mostly urban-based, women whose actions have been determined by their degree of support and the tolerance of the state. Notably, however, women lacked meaningful parliamentary representation, and were not given leading positions in business and the bureaucracy. Traditionally women pointed to unequal status in education and marriage, and sometimes redress (or partial redress) was forthcoming. But as the 20th century progressed, new or ganisations led by younger women urged the redress of issues such as violence against women – in the home and elsewhere – as well as discrimination and inequality at work and in political representation. Blackburn also highlights the diversity of views among Indonesian women, particularly apparent in the growing reluctance of women outside Jakarta to allow those in Jakarta to represent their needs. She argues, in part, that the emphasis in Indonesia on unity and social harmony , particularly but not exclusively in the New Order period, has conditioned the way in which women express their needs. Because women have been socialised to care for others, she suggests, they have not readily identified their own rights. But the gaps in gender equality are manifest, and the hope in the era of reformasi, to the extent that it permeates socially and culturally and into relations between men and women, is that the needs of all women will be clearly recognised. In his chapter on the Indonesian ‘criminal’ state, Tim Lindsey argues that the origins of premanisme reside in the 1945 Constitution and the integralist state envisioned by its authors. He highlights the state-sponsored nature of the criminal elements operating under the authoritarian New Order and surveys the transition of these elements upon the collapse of the New Order structure. The administration of Abdurrahman Wahid, Lindsey posits, is challenged by\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\n12\n\nPage 12\n\nGRAYSON J. LLOYD AND SHANNON L. SMITH\n\nthe legacy from the New Order of exponents of state premanisme in the bureaucracy, military and other sectors. These same criminal elements, no longer backed by the state, have been forced to ‘go private’ in the post-Soeharto era. Abdurrahman has attempted to act against some of the preman but these efforts have so far proved inadequate. The preman are, however, increasingly susceptible to societal backlashes against criminality as they no longer enjoy state support. The basic question relates to control of the state apparatus, and whether a strengthened and functioning legal system – capable of preventing or punishing violence and corruption – can overcome premanisme, or whether society will deal with the preman on equal but extra-judicial terms. In Chapter 24, Robert Cribb canvasses the prospect of Indonesia shedding the burden of empire and discusses the resistance to this concept in elite circles where the emotional power of the ‘idea of Indonesia’is prevalent. The Indonesian experiment, he asserts, is contingent upon three factors: the potency of centrifugal forces in the outlying regions; the ability of the centre to accentuate the positive features of Indonesian unity; and the desire of the island of Java to remain a part of Indonesia. Pointing to the experience of empires in history, he notes that the more successful the process of the imposition of a broad imperial identity is, the less appealing the whole structure may become to the ‘dominant’ group – the Javanese in the Indonesian context. He dismisses the view that Java needs to remain a part of a united Indonesia for economic reasons or because it would disintegrate under the weight of ethnic divisions were it to separate from Indonesia. He concludes by pointing to the absence of Javanese restiveness and political assertiveness, and of the direct discrimination against other indigenous ethnic groups that was a marker of the collapse of the Ottoman, Mongol and many Western colonial empires. Given the current parlous economic and political climate, the failure of the decentralisation and democratisation processes could lead to a less powerful attachment to the idea of Indonesia, and the exploration of more radical solutions. The historical experience of the Indonesian nation has been rich, varied and frequently elusive of definitive explanation. But from all of this what lessons can be learned? At least two principles of immediate relevance may be distilled. The first is that the present climate, teeming with uncertainty and intrigue, is merely another challenge in a long series faced by the Indonesian nation and people. Second, time spent remembering and reflecting on history is indicative of a progressive society. It is unlikely such an exercise will provide an epiphany for Indonesia’ s leaders and intellectuals – scholars and thinkers have grappled, and are still grappling, with the sense and meaning of modern Indonesia – but it can highlight salient factors for consideration. Only those nations whose inhabitants have an awareness of what has gone before and are reconciled with its positive and negative aspects – the extraordinary\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 13\n\nTHOUGHTS ON INDONESIAN HISTORY\n\n13\n\nand the eminently for gettable – will be able to deal ef fectively with the demands of the present and some of the challenges likely to be faced in the future. Misrepresentation of this past – whether wilful, misguided or through ignorance – will almost certainly have a deleterious impact.\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 14\n\n2 THE CONTINGENT AND THE UNFORESEEN John Legge\n\nMy brief for this chapter is more than a little daunting, as I have been asked to consider what 100 years of Indonesian history might tell us about the future. No less! Both parts of that assignment pose problems. First of all, does history tell us anything about the future? Are there any lessons to be drawn? Marx, in the opening sentence of The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1926, p. 23), refers to Hegel’s view that history repeats itself – that ‘all great events and personalities in world history reappear in one fashion or another ’ – and he tacks on his own rider: ‘the first time as tragedy , the second as farce’. For my part I’m not sure that history can tell us anything about the future except that it is likely to be unexpected. Perhaps H.A.L. Fisher was right when he said, in the Preface to his History of Europe, that there was only one safe rule for historians – that they should recognise in the development of human destinies ‘the play of the contingent and the unforeseen’. When I was a student of history at the University of Melbourne we were taught to regard Fisher with a certain degree of contempt, as a historian who could not see patterns, regularities or process in the events of the past, only one event following another ‘as wave follows upon wave’. Sixty years later, and with an eye to Indonesian history, I am inclined to believe that Fisher may have had a point. Second, I am not at all certain what ‘100 years of Indonesian history’ is intended to convey. Is it the things that have happened in that 100 years? Or the things that have been said – and are still being said – about the things that have happened? The events of the past or the writings about the events of the past? Perhaps both. In the following pages, however , I will be trying to address the second of these rather than ‘history itself ’. At a quick glance, writings about Indonesian history and the shape of events themselves display a sharp break around the middle of the 20th century. Before World War II most historical work, predominantly Dutch, was concerned either with early history, and with the construction from fragmen14\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 15\n\nTHE CONTINGENT AND THE UNFORESEEN\n\n15\n\ntary archaeological, epigraphical and literary sources of a chronology of events, or with the presence of European powers from the 16th century , with the commercial activities of the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) and with the high imperialism of the late 19th century. The overall picture was of a past shaped mainly by external forces: India – the perception of the Indies as part of ‘greater India’ as Georges Coedès (1948) saw it in his study of what he called the ‘Hinduised States’ of Indochina and Indonesia – Islam and, of course, Europe. There were challenges to that view. J.C. van Leur in the 1930s rejected the idea that Indian influence came by way of colonisation and conquest and questioned the theory that it was the product of trading contacts. He described the early commerce of the archipelago as a peddling trade, not a capitalist trade, and argued that, as such, it could not have been the bearer of high culture. Indian and later Islamic influence he saw not as a matter of external imposition but of local initiative selectively borrowing external forms in support of local polities and constituting what he called, in a famous phrase, ‘a thin and flaking glaze’ leaving the main body of local cultures essentially intact. The so-called Hindu–Javanese period of Indonesian history, for example, he saw as a case of Indonesian polities absorbing those aspects of Indian culture which would help to sustain the emergence of centralised hierarchical authority. It was a court matter – a selecting of ideas, ritual and or ganisation, not a matter of general cultural diffusion.1 This was a very different emphasis from that of Coedès. 2 Similar judgments were made about the penetration of Islam from the 12th century onwards, and about the initial impact of Portuguese and Dutch commerce from the beginning of the 16th century. The VOC, in establishing trading stations, was seen as fitting in with existing patterns of local trade and as making merely a peripheral impact on the archipelago. Though its range and strength made it gradually the paramount power in the region, its relations with local rulers were seen as more like a system of international relations than a system of colonial overlordship, at least until the territorial expansion of the Dutch empire in the 19th and 20th centuries brought the diverse societies of the archipelago for the first time into an administrative unity . By the early 20th century the Indies had become clearly a Dutch possession and the focus of scholars was directed mainly to the character of Dutch rule and the changing emphases of Dutch policy , from the economic expansion of the Liberal phase to the self-conscious benevolence of the Ethical Policy. Such studies as J.S. Furnivall’ s Netherlands India were in no doubt that local initiative had been subordinated to foreign power. World War II, it could be said, broke the continuity of events and also of the way in which events were perceived. The Japanese sweep through Southeast Asia and the occupation of the colonial dependencies of Britain, France,\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\n16\n\nPage 16\n\nJOHN LEGGE\n\nthe Netherlands and the United States destroyed the apparatus of colonial rule and rendered impossible its simple restoration when the war was over . While the imperial powers in different ways attempted to reassert control over their former dependencies, they did so within the dynamics of a changed global situation. Emerging nationalisms, the formation of new states – India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya and Singapore – the drawn-out agony of the Vietnam war and the changing balances of power after the victory of the Communist Party in China in 1949 af fected not merely the study of these events as they evolved but also the way in which the earlier history of the region was examined. For Indonesia, for example, the significant developments of the first half of the 20th century – the development of new political and cultural movements such as Sarekat Islam, Pujangga Baru and Taman Siswa, the rise of the Communist Party (PKI) and the revolts of 1926–27, the formation of the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI) – assumed a new shape in the light of the outcome of the struggle for independence. The postwar period in fact saw a vast expansion of Southeast Asian studies in the West, as well as in the institutions of the new nations themselves. To a great extent this was policy-driven. The politics of Indonesia’s struggle for independence had profound implications for the future political stability of the region and, with the establishment of the Cold War setting, it was a matter of urgency for outside players to understand the nature of the changes taking place in the societies and polities of the area as a whole. Hence there evolved a focus on new political forces and on questions of modernisation and development, and these needed to be observed against the background of a longer past. And new nations, too, required new histories to sustain the assertion of new identities and the sublimation of old legacies. One characteristic of the development of Western studies in the 1950s and 1960s was the confidence of scholars as they approached the problems of the new Southeast Asia, seeing it as an exciting new field of study to be opened up. Some difficulties were recognised – problems of sources for early history, questions of bias in the highly char ged atmosphere of the day , dangers of Eurocentricity in the treatment of other societies and cultures. (V an Leur again, and his remark that ‘with the arrival of ships from western Europe, the point of view is turned a hundred and eighty degrees and from then on the Indies are observed from the deck of the ship, the ramparts of the fortress and the high gallery of the trading house’.) Nevertheless, while these problems were given a passing nod, there was a belief that, with care, the job could be done. A series of seminars mounted by D.G.E. Hall at the University of London in 1956–58 was a case in point. The scholars gathered there surveyed the problems of writing Southeast Asian history but, though cautious in the light of the difficulties, in the end they had no fundamental doubts about their craft (Hall 1961). And a few years later , in\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 17\n\nTHE CONTINGENT AND THE UNFORESEEN\n\n17\n\n1961, John Smail, in a famous paper , addressed the problem of Eurocentricity and the natural tendency to interpret developments in terms of local response to the external challenge. He introduced the idea of the autonomy of Southeast Asian history and ar gued that, notwithstanding the undoubted impact of full Dutch empire, local cultures remained resilient. Even such developments as the emer gence of a new Western-educated elite could be seen as part of a local evolution that could be studied successfully by foreign observers (Smail 1961). Along with the confidence went a sense of optimism about the future. It was a new world. The days of colonialism were over and liberal scholarship had high expectations that the new nations would provide stability and development in the future. For Indonesia one may take George McT. Kahin’s (1952) study of the revolution, one of the first wave of postwar scholarly works, as reflecting these characteristics. Kahin carried out fieldwork in Indonesia in 1948 and 1949 and was thus a close observer of the later stages of the struggle. He for ged close links with some of the leading figures of the republic and clearly sympathised with their aims. His general interpretation was straightforward. He set the struggle against the background of colonial rule. The general picture was of the pre-war emergence of nationalism as a natural product of the high imperialism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, shaped by changing emphases of Dutch policies and especially by the educational policies of the 20th century, which assisted the growth of a new Indonesian elite, educated but underemployed and ready to take advantage of the Japanese defeat of the Dutch. (Nationalism, in ef fect, is seen, before Ben Anderson had coined the term, as the imagining of a new community.) The end of the war thus found a nationalist leadership in place and ready to maintain a four -year-long resistance to the return of Dutch power . Enlightened, democratic in temper , its members gave ground for hopes for the future of the new republic. For Kahin the story had a tentatively happy ending. His closing sentence catches the mood: ‘Whatever the case, if in attempting to solve their great post-revolutionary problems the Indonesian people were able to demonstrate the same qualities they had shown in their struggle for political independence their chances of success appeared strong’ (Kahin 1952, p. 480). Herbert Feith’s Decline of Constitutional Democracy in Indonesia did for the 1950s what Kahin’ s Nationalism and Revolution had done for the late 1940s. Both remain the standard works covering two of the commonly perceived divisions of the history of the republic: the revolution, the period of constitutional democracy, Guided Democracy , the change of regime (1965–68) and the Soeharto presidency, leading to the next change of regime (Habibie to Gus Dur). But by 1962, the publication date of Feith’ s study, the optimism reflected in Kahin’s work had dimmed. As the century unrolled there were shifts in modes of interpretation of\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\n18\n\nPage 18\n\nJOHN LEGGE\n\nthese successive stages, and of the years leading up to them: changes in style, changing perceptions of what seemed an appropriate subject matter for study, changes in fashion about what would constitute a satisfactory explanation of events. The differences were in part due to changing angles of vision – later observers knew what had happened in the intervening years – in part to the preferences (values) of historians and in part to actual changes in the Indonesian situation (noting that, as the actual changes are seen and described by observers, there may be a difficulty in distinguishing between perception and reality). Kahin’s work and others that followed in the 1950s were lar gely political analyses, concerned with the identification of political forces, primarily within an Indonesian elite: political parties, the emergence of the Army as an extra-parliamentary force, the growth of the PKI, the dissidence of elements in Sumatra and Sulawesi. The changing balance of such forces over the 1950s had made the provisional constitution no longer in line with political realities. The return to the Constitution of 1945 and the introduction of the forms of Guided Democracy were explained in these terms. Historians, in approaching these events and while focusing primarily on what might be called the political level, were increasingly influenced by the methods and findings of the neighbouring social sciences. W.F. Wertheim (1965) and Harry Benda (1962) both ar gued that historians had to be social scientists themselves, and many historians found that conceptual formulations by political scientists, anthropologists, sociologists and others were useful in illuminating events at the political level in Indonesia. Feith’s characterisation of the Indonesian elite as divided between administrators and solidaritymakers and Sartono’s attempt to establish a taxonomy of movements of peasant unrest in Java were examples (Feith 1962; Sartono 1973). But of particular importance in reshaping perceptions of Indonesia’s social and political landscape were Clif ford Geertz’s series of conceptual analyses: agricultural involution and the idea of ‘shared poverty’ in a wet rice society, the cultural variants of priyayi, santri and abangan in Java, the idea of the ‘theatre State’, compounded of Islamic and Hindu–Buddhist elements, to characterise the cosmologically based, hierarchical order of Java and Bali, and the more general notion of aliran or cultural streams running vertically through the diverse societies of the archipelago (see, for example, Geertz 1960, 1963, 1965, 1968, 1980). Whether Geertz discovered these categories or invented them remains a matter of debate. Were they there to be observed or did he impose them on the Indonesian scene? Did the analysis depend on evidence or did it merely offer one way among others of looking at a complex society? The aliran concept is obviously far from precise but it seemed to make sense of the election results of 1955: Masyumi strength outside Java and in West Java, NU’s base in the santri of East and Central Java, and the appeal of the PNI and the PKI to the abangan of Java. But this was a very rough set\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 19\n\nTHE CONTINGENT AND THE UNFORESEEN\n\n19\n\nof correspondences, and how far they sprang from aliran attachments and how far they were a reflection of other causes it is perhaps impossible to say . The same may be true of Feith’ s identification of two broad political subcultures in Indonesia, described as Javanese–aristocratic and Islamic–entrepreneurial. In this way he attempted to bring together a diversity of geographical, ethnic and social divisions and to relate them to themes in Indonesian history: the contribution of Hindu–Buddhist civilisation in Java, the commercial experience of the archipelago over the centuries, the uneven penetration of Islam and differences within the Islamic community. Through concepts of this kind foreigners and Indonesians alike have struggled to make sense of the complexities and ambiguities of Indonesian political behaviour in the post-independence era and to find explanations not only for party allegiances but for such developments as the growth of separatist movements in the Outer Islands in the 1950s or the sharpening of political divisions in the 1960s. What is worth noticing in these analyses is that they reflect a shift in the categories of explanation. Whereas the initial concern of Western scholars, at least in the early years of the republic, was with political forces, intra-elite conflicts and changes in the domestic balances of power , there later appeared a tendency to seek explanations in aspects of Indonesia’s traditional social order. One of the elements of traditional order, at least as it was perceived by historians and others in the 1960s and 1970s, was the residue of Indian influence in Java and Bali as expressed in views about the nature of political authority . Drawing in part on an influential article by Robert Heine-Geldern in 1942, observers pointed to the hierarchical and centralised character of earlier Javanese kingdoms, embodying ideas of a divine kingship and of a parallelism of the universe and the terrestrial order , with the capital of the ruler seen as the magical centre of the realm and the ruler – the descendant or incarnation of a god – maintaining the unity and harmony of the kingdom, mirroring that of the cosmic order . The reality was never like that. The history of Javanese kingdoms was very much a matter of fairly continuous conflict. Pigeaud, in introducing his translation of the 14th century epic, the Nagarakertagama of the Kingdom of Majapahit, stressed the precarious nature of royal power and saw the ‘perennial division and reunion of the realm’ as an inherent part of the system (Pigeaud 1960, p.122). And the theoretical emphasis on harmony, centrality of authority and the indivisibility of the kingdom may well be seen as a response to that turbulent reality . Attention to this kind of cosmology is reflected not only in the work of historians engaged in the study of earlier kingdoms – Soemarsaid Moertono’s (1963) examination of Mataram from the 16th to the 19th century , for example, which discerns a blending of Islamic and earlier elements, or M.C. Ricklefs’ (1974) examination of the rule of Sultan Mangkubumi in Yogyakarta in\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\n20\n\nPage 20\n\nJOHN LEGGE\n\nthe latter part of the 18th century and of the inherent dif ficulty of conceiving of a continuing division of the realm – but also in that of observers of the 20th century scene both before and after the formation of the republic. Heather Sutherland (1979), in exploring the formation of the modern bureaucratic elite, pointed to the way in which traditional elements survived, first in the development of a colonial bureaucracy and then in the greatly altered circumstances of the post-revolutionary scene. The colonial service, the pangreh praja, she argued, should be seen simultaneously ‘as heirs to the local rulers of pre-colonial days and also as agents of the Netherlands government; they were neither exclusively the one nor the other , but both’ (p. 2). The roots of the service ‘reached back far into Java’ s history, into the political and social patterns of early indigenous states’ (p. 3). And even as the social origins of its membership changed and as a ‘new priyayi’ emerged in the 20th century , there were still continuities of values and practice to be observed, continuities even as the pamong praja (the postwar term for the territorial service) came increasingly to be staffed by military officers and to be subordinated to effective military rule (p. 159). Similarly, others have turned to traditional order to explain developments of the present and the recent past. Bernhard Dahm (1969) portrayed Sukarno as reflecting many of the traits of a traditional ruler. In his illuminating essay, ‘The Idea of Power in Javanese Culture’, Ben Anderson (1972a), while recognising the conceptual dif ficulty of discussing the implied political theory of another culture using such terms as ‘power ’ and ‘authority’ drawn from a Western analytical framework, proceeded to a systematic account of traditional Javanese political assumptions and noticed their continuing impact in modern Indonesia. He commented in particular on the tension between centre and periphery, and the president’ s claim to embody the unity of society . Nationalism itself was seen not as a political credo but as expressing a fundamental drive for solidarity and unity in the face of the disintegrating forces of colonial capitalism – ‘an attempt to reconquer a primordial one-ness’ (Anderson 1972a, pp. 22–4). Ruth McV ey (1965) found signs of the PKI’ s ability, during the early 1960s, to attract members of the Javanese peasantry through its manipulation of traditional perceptions. And Soedjatmoko (1967, p. 275) pointed to the cultural roots of modern political parties, which he saw not as associations formed to advance alternative programs but as ‘the political representatives of cultural solidarity groups which are tied together by primordial loyalties of great intensity’. As a broad generalisation, then, it might be said that between the late 1960s and early 1970s the focus of historians and political scientists was less on the rapidly changing balances of political pressure groups and more on what seemed to be the more permanent underpinnings of political action –\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 21\n\nTHE CONTINGENT AND THE UNFORESEEN\n\n21\n\nthose traditional features of Indonesian society that were stable and persistent. (Though it did not seem to be noticed at the time, it could be said that the new focus implied something of a retreat from the hitherto fashionable assertions of van Leur. If the traditional features of Indonesian society illuminated features of modern political behaviour, the external influences over the centuries must have been more than a thin and flaking glaze. And since the perceived tradition was to a considerable degree seen as stemming from the early kingdoms, it might appear that Coedès had after all had the better of the argument!) This shift may in part be a reflection of changing events in Indonesia. A focus on parties, pressure groups and political forces might have been appropriate enough for the events of the constitutional period of the 1950s, and a focus on traditional forms may have reflected the political style of Guided Democracy and the subsequent New Order, placing its emphasis on the nature of leadership and on the bases of authoritarian rule. Be that as it may, the shift had its own difficulties. The antithetical terms ‘tradition’ and ‘modernity’ are often used as though their meaning is clear . But ‘tradition’ implies a judgment made now about what was the case in the past, and in making such a judgment much depends on the perceptions of the modern observer. For Indonesia, Indian and Islamic influences are normally seen as absorbed into an older indigenous tradition. But what about the changes taking place after the establishment of a European presence? Has the emergence of the late 19th and early 20th century elite also been absorbed? In practice traditional and modern elements, however defined, are so intermixed that to oppose the two may be misleading. One may accept that the traditional/modern antithesis may sometimes serve a useful analytical purpose, but only for particular purposes and within the framework of a par ticular enquiry. And, of course, assertions about tradition and change are never neutral. They are loaded with values. These may be displayed in various ways. If aspects of the major developments of the 20th century can be seen as rooted in the past, the colonial era itself appears as merely an interlude like the other external pressures that went before, and the essential autonomy of Indonesian history is preserved. Again, to appeal to tradition as an explanation of much that is observed in the present, and to stress the inertia of tradition, may have the conservative effect of drawing the attention of observers away from elements of change. To focus, for example, on Geertz’s three variants in Javanese social order, or on ethnic divisions across the archipelago, may play down conflicts between emerging classes and in this way serve the interests of existing elites. Finally, was Soeharto to be seen during his long presidency as performing a modernising role or might he be seen instead as calling on\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\n22\n\nPage 22\n\nJOHN LEGGE\n\ntraditional motifs to sustain his authority? Perceptions of continuities or of discontinuities are alike constructions of the observer and may have dif ferent purposes to serve. Recognition of the values embedded in alternative approaches may have helped to undermine the confidence of the early postwar analysts. What is seen from a privileged vantage point in the present, what is taken for granted and what is selected for comment is necessarily shaped by interest, purpose and culture, and reflects fundamental assumptions about how the world is constituted. Is there any avenue of escape? Soedjatmoko, in 1965, spoke of the ‘polyinterpretability’ of historical reality , and discussed this from the angle of Indonesian historians considering Indonesia’ s own history . Their interest in the past was expected to serve the needs of the present by sustaining a sense of national identity . Did that mean that their work would necessarily display a conflict between their patriotism and their professional obligations? Soedjatmoko’s answer was that the apparent conflict could be overcome. Indonesian historians could not escape their participation in the society about them but must still be constrained by their professional discipline. For the outside observer , too, that is perhaps the best that could be expected, though so-called scientific historians may also unconsciously shape a picture of the past to serve the values of the present. Another approach to these uncertainties was that which was stimulated by developments in literary theory – by post-modernist and post-structuralist discourse. Much earlier, of course, C.C. Ber g had criticised N.J. Krom’ s use of classical texts to establish a history of Javanese kingdoms, ar guing that Krom’s sources were not historical in character (see, for example, Berg 1961). They had a different, magical, function to perform – the creation of an alternative reality, to provide a legitimate ancestry for a usurper, perhaps, or to sustain a subsequent world view . The later development of critical theory went far beyond that, concentrating not on supposed matters of fact but on the inner relationships of texts, on codes and symbols which could give insights not into events but only into the cultural conventions of the societies that produced the texts. The language was the language of image and myth, discourse, signs and symbols. This kind of analysis applied not only to texts in the literal sense – inscriptions, chronicles and so forth – but to texts by analogy – cultural traits, pat terns of behaviour , actions that reflected the sign system of those who performed them. One may think of James Siegel’s examination of Acehenese historical thinking or Anthony Day’s exploration of Javanese concepts of time, prophecy and change or Jane Drakard’ s study of royal authority in Minangkabau. The post-structuralist approach landed some scholars in the ultimate scepticism of a Derrida, ar guing that texts, whether written or acted, were self-\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 23\n\nTHE CONTINGENT AND THE UNFORESEEN\n\n23\n\nregarding, referring only to themselves and not to a reality outside themselves, that they had meaning only in their relationship with a reader and that there could therefore be no valid reading, only a continuing deconstruction of deconstructions and a constant deferring of judgment. The almost paralysing uncertainty inherent in this approach stood in sharp contrast to the confidence that had marked the earlier postwar onslaught on Southeast Asia. Indeed it tended to suggest that historical study was not, in the end, about an external world about which accurate statements might be made, but only about the perceptions of historians themselves. Others, however, have drawn on critical theory not to reject the validity of the historical enterprise but to strengthen it by stressing the attentiveness and sensitivity required in the examination of the sign systems of other cultures or by using alternative readings to revise earlier fashions of interpretation. Oliver Wolters (1982/1999) is one who has shifted the framework of historical inquiry by opening up reflexive, ethnographic approaches to the exploration of other societies and other times. In so doing he challenged the confidence of earlier scholars while adding new dimensions to the way the past may be studied. A different kind of example is provided by John Pemberton’ s (1994) study of the public ceremonies and domestic rituals of Java, which led him to a reversal of the fashion of appealing to tradition to explain current trends. In place of the idea of an underlying cultural order that might be invoked to explain the present, he suggested that perceptions of culture and tradition were, on the contrary, shaped by the needs of the present. The idea of ‘Java’, he argued, if not an invention, was at least a deliberate revival of traditional perceptions in the interests of a repressive regime. PROSPECTS After this scamper through some of the changing fashions of interpretation, and subject to the uncertainties that I have raised, can one hope with any confidence to characterise the shape of Indonesia’ s history over the century that is coming to an end, and from there to detect trends that extend into the future? Almost certainly not. However, I suppose I am committed to having a go. There seem to be some turning points and some natural divisions in the course of events, as I have already indicated. These might include, for example, the extending power and authority of colonial rule, accompanied by the emergence and development of a nationalist movement, albeit with a variety of elements, the cultural ferment of the 1930s, the Second World War and the Japanese occupation, the revolution, constitutional democracy , Guided Democracy, the fall of the first president and the bloody transition to the New Order – and the next regime change, beginning with Habibie and still unfold-\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\n24\n\nPage 24\n\nJOHN LEGGE\n\ning under his successor. But can we see where these stages are heading? The trouble about stages and turning points is that they are not objectively ‘there’ in the texture of events. They are there because we put them there. And we only perceive them as such long after , when we know what happened subsequently. Having said all that, I wouldn’t want to depart from the conventional perceptions of the pre-war development of Netherlands India, and one cannot escape the idea of the Japanese defeat of the Dutch, the occupation and the subsequent struggle for independence as constituting a cataclysmic division. But what of the subsequent history of the republic? Are there continuing themes – issues which remain, possibly in dif ferent forms, through the perceived stages of that history? One may, perhaps, point first of all to the tension expressed in the motto of the republic itself – usually translated as ‘Unity in Diversity’. On the one hand we have the emer gence in the first part of the century of a nationalist movement seeking to unite the archipelago and presented by Sukarno as overarching and disciplining other ideologies. On the other hand is the fact that the Dutch dependency of Netherlands India was a recent creation, and did not remove the continuing differences between, and within, regions – ethnic, linguistic, religious, cultural and economic dif ferences. This tension was acute in the early years of the republic and in different forms remains evident today. One component in that tension is the varying position and dif fering varieties of Islam within the archipelago, again a product of its longer history . Secondly, one can point to continuities in the way alternative political forms have presented themselves and how they have been debated. In the 1950s the forms of parliamentary democracy were simultaneously criticised and defended until the return to the 1945 Constitution and the transition to Guided Democracy in 1959, a move that was justified in part as representing a return to traditional forms and processes of Indonesian society . What happened between 1957 and 1959 was a political change of some magnitude, though probably less than a regime change. That term would appear more applicable to what happened between 1965 and 1968, though this still occurred within the framework of the 1945 Constitution. One can detect shifts in the course of the Soeharto period, as the earlier concern with reversing the excesses of the Sukarno period and the emphasis on economic development gave way to a streamlined authoritarianism, military dominance and the prevalence of corruption in various forms. The aggravated authoritarianism and conspicuous nepotism in turn evoked ideological reactions, the call for reformasi and democracy, reminiscent of earlier debates. Thirdly, one may notice the survival of patrimonial forms in the supposedly modern Soeharto state. (Whether this reflected underlying cultural patterns or, as Pemberton suggests, it was a deliberate appeal to a traditional\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\nPage 25\n\nTHE CONTINGENT AND THE UNFORESEEN\n\n25\n\norder, does not matter at this point.) The territorial bureaucracy was hijacked by the Army as Army officers came to occupy many of the levels of the territorial service from province to subdistrict. This control was further underpinned by the Army’s own provincial and subprovincial commands, paralleling the administrative structure of the state. The fall of Soeharto and accession of Habibie, for all its major policy shifts (including the opening of the door to a possible withdrawal from East Timor), might be seen as another transitional period leading to the elections and the 1999 session of the People’ s Consultative Assembly (MPR), events which at this distance might have a claim to be represented as a change of regime corresponding in magnitude to that of 1965–67. Is this a case of history repeating itself? And if the appalling events of 1966 make that regime change appear as tragedy, Gus Dur sometimes seems to be playing to the idea of repetition as farce. That irreverence aside, how far do these continuing themes persist in the new situation, perhaps in new forms? Clearly Indonesia’s regional tensions continue, reflecting the artificiality of the political unit created by the Dutch. In the 1950s the proposed solution to the problem of regional dissidence was the delegation of an increased degree of autonomy to descending levels of local government: province, kabupaten and ‘level 3’ (the village or groupings of villages). The problem, however, was that the powers that the centre was prepared to concede were insufficient to meet regional demands. The powers demanded were what might be called powers of national policy , which the centre had to retain if Indonesia was to stay a united state. Currency control was one area where exporting regions saw themselves as subsidising the island of Java but where power could not be shared. The question of regional autonomy has reemerged with a vengeance, but again autonomy legislation, though promising to delegate significant powers, appears to take it all back by reserving the areas of national policy. In the 1950s federalism was a dirty word in the backlash against Dutch ef forts to retain influence by creating a United States of Indonesia, a solution that was decisively rejected after the transfer of sovereignty. At century’s end one may wonder whether a federal type of solution might not be the only way of satisfying some regional demands. Aceh and West Papua would be the test cases. Whether this would enable the archipelago to hold together goes along with the question of whether, within the framework of the 1945 Constitution, a revived democratic practice can satisfy other domestic demands, or whether the available machinery of central administration, backed in some way by military power, within a captive Gus Dur or successor administration, will again reinforce the authoritarian tradition that has marked the trends of the past 40 years.\n\nAA/Part0\n\n13/3/01 11:47 AM\n\n26\n\nPage 26\n\nJOHN LEGGE\n\nFinally there is a further theme which must be mentioned. One cannot avoid noticing the presence from time to time of extraordinary violence in Indonesian affairs, a violence that appears to go beyond the requirements of the issues being fought over at any time: the ‘social revolution’ in east Sumatra in 1946, the killings of 1965–66, the violence attendant on the withdrawal from East Timor, both before and after the ballot, the present violence between Muslim and Christian in Ambon. Have observers of Indonesian history tended to play down these recurring episodes, choosing rather to emphasise ideas of harmony or of syncretism as the essential features of Indonesian society and outlook? I leave these and other questions for other writers. NOTES 1 2\n\nSee van Leur (1955). Van Leur’s analysis of early trading patterns received support later from O.W. Wolters, whose definitive study saw the expansion of commerce as an indigenous and not an Indian achievement (W olters 1967, p. 247).

Abdurrahman won the presidential race as a compromise candidate, with representatives from most political forces joining what soon was to be called the ‘cabinet of national unity’. The international community, after initial irritation caused by Megawati Sukarnoputri’ s failure to gain the presidency, pledged support for the new administration, hoping that Indonesia would return to political normality and ultimately achieve economic consolidation. Those observers who had closely followed events leading to Abdurrahman’s election were more pessimistic, however. Abdurrahman’s obsession with becoming Habibie’s successor forced him to alienate former allies and make false promises to previous enemies, and was a shaky platform from which the country had to embark on its historic journey of political reform. The highly heterogeneous composition of the cabinet and the unpredictability of its leader were unlikely to guarantee the political stability Indonesia needed to restructure its political framework. The facade of political harmony in late October 1999 disintegrated within a month. By then, the first minister had been sacked, with six more to follow before the formation of a new cabinet in August 2000. The challenges that the Abdurrahman administration faced were enormous. The project of fundamentally reforming the country’s political structure covered six main areas. First, the institutional framework of the political system had to be redefined and modernised. Since the 1950s, the state institutions had been manipulated by a succession of authoritarian regimes, using the ambiguity of the 1945 Constitution to legalise their grip on power.
