It is an intellectual journey that I have only just begun. The more I read about Indonesia and discover during my many visits, the more I realize the complexities inherent in a country rich in diversity and multifaceted in the myriad of interpretations that can be brought to bear on the important issues of the day. Mine is but one interpretation. Numerous individuals and institutions have provided assistance which directly or indirectly contributed to the completion of this book. My initial task is to thank two wonderful scholars, who are sadly no longer with us, the late Huynh Kim Khanh of Cornell University and Kernial Singh Sandhu, who was Director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies until his untimely demise in 1992. Both these scholars did the most to stimulate my interest in Southeast Asian Studies and start me off in the right direction. K.S. Sandhu had a vision for Southeast Asian research that he articulated to me in January 1992 before I left Singapore to begin my doctoral studies at the Australian National University. He had observed that while Southeast Asians tended to write prolifically on the countries of their origin, little cross-cultural research was undertaken within the region. He pondered whether it was due to a lack of inclination by Southeast Asians to comment on the internal affairs of each other’s countries, but emphasized that such an impediment should be overcome as cross-cultural research would add a unique dimension to Southeast Asian Studies. Next, he stressed to me that the development of local expertise on Indonesia was particularly critical as Indonesia was Singapore’s neighbour and Singaporean scholars should attempt to make their own inimitable contribution to Indonesian studies. This book, in its own modest way, aspires to fulfil that vision articulated to me all those years ago. I would be amiss if I failed to acknowledge the special debt of gratitude I owe to those who have contributed to my early intellectual development when I did degrees in History and Political Science at York University in Toronto, Canada. Robert W. Cox, Cynthia Dent, David B. Dewitt, Paul M. Evans, Gerald S. Jordan, Willard Piepenberg, Richard Stubbs (at McMaster\n\n00b RPI Prelim v-xvii\n\n13\n\n4/10/06, 7:30 PM\n\nxiv PREFACE\n\nUniversity) and Neal Wood made immense contributions to helping me lay a firm academic foundation that has served me well during my career. My initial acquisition of a good deal of knowledge on the technicalities of defence planning and policymaking was acquired while at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre (SDSC) at the Australian National University, a richly rewarding academic experience, though no less challenging, that complimented the highly theoretical international studies education I had received at York. In Canberra, at the SDSC, I was privileged to know Desmond Ball, Lezsek Buszynski, and Paul Dibb. More importantly, early knowledge on the intricacies of the TNI as a defence institution and its involvement in Indonesian politics and society was due in no small part to the numerous talks I had with Harold Crouch and Robert Lowry who as research advisors shared their knowledge with enthusiasm and generosity. The excellent collegial environment I enjoyed at the SDSC was due also to the friendship of Nicola Baker and Khoo How San. There are institutions and individuals in Singapore whose support has been significant and to whom I owe a debt of gratitude. The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) where the initial research and writing began in mid-2000 was a wonderful place to begin my academic career. I particularly thank Chan Heng Chee who gave me my first appointment and Chia Siow Yue who guided my early career and provided me a good appreciation of economics which allowed me to grasp better the salient issues of the Indonesian economic crisis in 1997. Just as important was the presence of a magnificent group of colleagues who were generous with their knowledge and friendship. I particularly want to thank Chandran Jeshurun, Patricia Lim, Surin Maisrikrod, Manuel Montes, Mya Than, Ng Chee Yuen, Kim Ong-Geiger, Sorpong Peou, Joseph L.H. Tan, Naimah Talib, Tin Maung Maung Than and Diana Wong. I have also been very fortunate that through their association with ISEAS I have been able to benefit from the wisdom of Donald E. Weatherbee, James Cotton and the late Michael Leifer all of whom exemplify the qualities of excellent scholarly role models. Lee Yeoh Lay, Ch’ng Kim See, Triena Ong and N. Nagarajan were marvellous in generously sharing their knowledge relating to the intricacies of administration, library management, publications and computing services so essential to the smooth running of an academic institution. As a young academic, I am thankful to them not only for their friendship but for imbibing me with an understanding that there is more to an academic institution than merely research, the knowledge of which I am certain will hold me in good stead for the future.\n\n00b RPI Prelim v-xvii\n\n14\n\n4/10/06, 7:30 PM\n\nPREFACE\n\nxv\n\nI would also like to record my thanks to S.R. Nathan, who as founding Director of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS), led by example and was never too busy to confer an encouraging word while always generous to share his vast knowledge with young academics like myself. His insights on regional trends and perspectives on the policy process in Singapore helped sharpen the objectivity of my research and he remains a continuous source of encouragement to me in my career. IDSS, where I finished the writing of the book, contributed towards funding two of my field trips to Indonesia. Another was done under the auspices as a consultant to the Singapore Trade Development Board. These field trips were undertaken during 2000–2002. In this regard I would like to record my appreciation to Barry Desker who was instrumental in my appointment as a consultant to the Trade Development Board and as Director of IDSS has always been willing to share his wide-ranging expertise on Indonesia. At IDSS, my greatest intellectual debt is to Alastair Iain Johnston of Harvard University, who as the S. Rajaratnam Distinguished Visiting Professor in 2003 took the time to comment on the draft of my introduction and made useful suggestions. Recounting his earlier experiences, he advised me to avoid using value-laden terms like strategic or security culture which had the propensity to confuse readers. Since it was really small “c” culture that I was really interested in, he suggested I use the term security ideology since it reflected clearly how culture and the politics of national security intersected in my own research. Hence, my use of the term realpolitik ideology to describe the micro processes by which this ideology of threat manifests itself in security policy and in the behaviour of security elites in Indonesia. Similarly, I would also like to thank Chong Ja Ian of Princeton University who provided useful comments on the Introduction at a critical juncture of the writing phase. At IDSS, I particularly want to thank Chong Yee Ming who provided superb library assistance and both Tng Eng Cheong and Calvin Wong for their advice on computer matters. Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to the wonderful friendships I have enjoyed with Indonesian scholars and practitioners who through their association with IDSS have shared with me and continue to share a multitude of perspectives on Indonesia, namely, Yuddy Chrisnandi, J. Soedradjad Djiwandono, Tatik S. Hafitz, Irman G. Lanti, Ryaas Rashid, Sukardi Rinakit, Rizal Sukma and Agus Widjojo. Of particular significance are the Indonesian students who participated in my “State and Politics in Modern Indonesia” course which is part of the IDSS Masters in Strategic Studies Programme. They shared many wonderful insights and their goodnatured criticisms helped nullify some of my typically orang asing\n\n00b RPI Prelim v-xvii\n\n15\n\n4/10/06, 7:30 PM\n\nxvi PREFACE\n\nmisperceptions of Indonesia, but more importantly, for their enduring friendship over the years. Despite the travails of reformasi, Indonesia’s younger generation fill me with hope that the country will once again emerge as a leading player in Asia-Pacific international relations. Many Indonesian institutions and individuals made possible and enriched my learning experience in Indonesia. Most significantly, I am deeply grateful to the Directors and Staff of CSIS, CPS-SSS, Habibie Center, LIPI, LPEM-FEUI, RIDEP Institute and numerous others from the NGO sector, academics, businesspeople, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats and military officers who I have enjoyed the privilege of meeting since my first visit to Indonesia in 1994. I was extremely gratified at the access I was granted particularly to high-level serving and retired military and defence officials. More surprising to me was the degree of openness and candour with which these officials were willing to discuss important matters of national policy. To them and the numerous Indonesians who contributed to the book which due to the nature of this topic must remain anonymous, I extend my heartfelt appreciation and thanks. I am also appreciative of the comments of the anonymous referees who provided important feedback to help me improve the quality of the manuscript. I would also like to acknowledge my gratitude to Triena Ong for her advice and thoughtful stewardship of the entire publication process from manuscript to book. I am indeed honoured to be given the privilege to publish my work with ISEAS. For moral support, I am grateful to my family especially my mother, Regina Sebastian and my parents-in-law, Lim Tei Tong and Mok Sock Khin who were extremely supportive in providing assistance to my wife and children during my long absences from Singapore while on fieldwork. I have been blessed with many good friends, but I specifically want to thank Joseph C. Quinn, A. Selvadurai and Derwin Pereira for their encouragement. Finally, the completion of this book is due in large measure to my wife Boon Ngee and my children Ryan and Emma, who shared with me the excitement, trials and tribulations all authors go through when writing a book, but significantly, for their efforts (by and large successful) to remind me that life does not revolve purely around research and writing. More importantly, I would like to thank the Omnipotent God who makes all things possible.\n\n00b RPI Prelim v-xvii\n\n16\n\n4/10/06, 7:30 PM\n\nNotes on the Spelling of Proper Names\n\nOver the years, a number of changes have been made in Indonesian spelling conventions. Early in the history of the Republic, it was decided to change the Dutch “oe” to “u” in official use. Subsequently further steps were taken to bring Indonesian and Malay conventions into line with each other, with Indonesian adopting the following forms: “c” replaces the former “tj”, “sy” replaces “sj”, “j” replaces “dj”, “y” replaces “j”. In the following pages the new conventions have been used for place names (Jakarta, not Djakarta, Aceh, not Atjeh, Surabaya, not Surabaja), but this is not so easy for the names of individuals who may have their preferences for the old or new spelling. For this reason, no attempt has been made to impose a consistent usage. The current rules have been followed where there is no other guide. However, where a person is known to have a preference for the old usage (Soedjatmoko) that has been respected. Again, the old spelling has been used for persons, now dead, who are better known in that form (Sjahrir rather than Syahrir). Sukarno rather than Soekarno follows the President’s declared wish even though he always signed himself Soekarno.\n\n00b RPI Prelim v-xvii\n\n17\n\n4/10/06, 7:30 PM\n\nGLOSSARY AND

The role of the military and the rationalization of its role through various security doctrines and strategies, though contested, remain the overarching ordering structure of the Indonesian state. These operational doctrines and the security structures that evolved out of them generated a sense of confidence in the custodial role played by security institutions, whose views on Indonesia became the lenses through which the world’s political and investment communities viewed the country. Much of the current disenchantment with Indonesia stems from the perception that stability can only be achieved if there is a return to the outmoded and imposing security structures of the Suharto era. The democratic transition began in earnest in 1999, remains messy and uncoordinated, with some laments in Indonesian society that “things were better under Suharto”. But while Indonesian culture, particularly Javanese culture, extols the virtues of stability, Indonesians would not substitute hard-won freedoms for policies that empower security institutions at the expense of human security. Such perspectives were evident in the acrimonious debates surrounding anti-terrorist legislation. Indonesians, while appreciative of the need for instruments to tackle terrorism, preferred to take incremental steps in devising laws with adequate safeguards to prevent the kind of human rights violations associated with the Suharto regime’s exploitation of Dutch colonial antisubversion laws.\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n1\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n2\n\nREALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\nThe core values for national security (see Chapter 1) and the security doctrines that supported the hegemony of the Suharto era state are under scrutiny as the country democratizes. Progress, while slow, is taking place and that the Indonesian people should be allowed the opportunity and scope to make a success of their democratic experiment. Indeed, while mindsets and rhetoric remain conservative, many of the structures of Indonesia’s national security state will likely become redundant over time. I hope that this book will aid readers, whether experienced Indonesiawatchers or those with a developing interest in the country, to formulate insights into the political–security nexus of change in Indonesia and, more importantly, that this change, while at times unpredictable, is by no means anarchic. Hence, this book attempts to address the issue of change in three ways. First, it analyses the development of the Indonesian national security state and the core values that it sustained. Second, it illustrates how doctrines developed to support the national security state were implemented and operationalized. Third, it explains the context of reform and how the reform agenda will inevitably result in the demise of the national security state. Much of the research on Indonesian military revolves around its role as a political force.1 Little emphasis is placed on the significant security doctrines that under-girded the military’s immense presence in politics.2 Even recent writing on the Indonesian military reflects a nearly three decade obsession over issues related to intra-military politics; the “custodial” role played by the military in Indonesia’s political transition; the nature of military disengagement from politics; and the ever-continual discourse pertaining to the movers and shakers in the military hierarchy.3 This preoccupation while understandable seemingly ignores the context whereby military power is exercised, namely, the security doctrines and the concomitant ideology that reinforces it. How was it possible for the military-dominated New Order state to maintain its hegemony for 32 years without real challenge from the Indonesian population? If the assumption has been that the military was the backbone of the state, then the answer should lie in a diagnostic assessment of the security doctrines that evolved during the Sukarno and Suharto eras. More importantly, what were the sources of these security doctrines? How were security doctrines legitimated? How were they employed for regime security? And what are the options for reforming Indonesia’s security doctrines so that military reform initiatives keep in step with the momentum generated by reformasi\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n2\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION 3\n\n(reformation) and democratization? These are questions to be answered in this study as the book attempts to understand the roots of Indonesian security ideology; what were the core values that underpinned this security ideology (Chapter 1); how security ideology manifested itself in operational doctrine and rationalized the application of military force (Chapters 2 to 4); and finally how military reform and changes to security ideology could consolidate Indonesia’s democratic transformation and improve the TNI’s military effectiveness as a modern defence force working within democratic structures (Chapter 5 and Conclusion). Throughout the post-independence era the themes “unity, security and stability” whether expressed through the medium of cultural discourse, or subliminally relayed through the wayang (shadow play), or articulated within official speeches, convey a sense that the greatest challenge for Indonesians is to maintain the unity and integrity of a vast archipelago. The “Unity of the Republic of Indonesia” is one of the five principles enshrined in the Pancasila4 state ideology, while “security and stability” are the doctrinal preconditions for national development. Following that logic, national development in turn provides “national resilience” against dissolution. These ideas, conveyed through a complex interplay of ideology and the politics of national security also find resonance in military norms. The first principle of the Soldier’s Oath or Sapta Marga, “We are citizens of the unitary Republic of Indonesia based on Pancasila”, mirrors Article 27; Paragraph 1 of the 1945 Constitution, which requires the military to defend the integrity of the Indonesian republic out of hati nurani (inner conscience).5 Put another way, ideological-political ideas have the power to shape national security policy. The major theme of this book is to demonstrate how agents of the Indonesian national security state jointly devised the ideological and national security doctrines that became the essential building block of the Suharto regime. Thirty years of Suharto’s rule had effectively ossified security doctrines and its rationalization along Javanese cultural lines. Change has been excruciatingly slow because the rump of the Suharto regime still exists, though divided into many competing political streams. Significantly for this study, the overarching structure of Javanese culture and norms reinforce the beliefs and value structure of the TNI, making it impervious to reform, particularly with respect to core security values (see Chapter 1). Nevertheless, Indonesia since the economic crisis of 1997 has a more open environment where greater accountability and\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n3\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n4\n\nREALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\ntransparency are the norm. The greater discipline being imposed on the economy through IMF conditionality; programmes funded by the UNDP to improve governance; and significantly, initiatives funded by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 6 linked to schemes propagating civilian democratic control of the military apparatus are all having an impact. Local NGO groups7 aspire to incrementally socialize the TNI into reshaping its national security perspectives but more importantly shaping its culture so that as an institution, it will keep pace with the spirit of reformasi in Indonesia and global norms. Will this marriage of local factors (the reformasi agenda) and external factors (global norms pushed by international actors, i.e. democratic accountability of the military) bring about the demise of the national security state in Indonesia? Or will factors drawn from Indonesia’s cultural past and recent history continue to shape security thinking? Throughout, I attempt to demonstrate that, while Suharto’s political success since consolidating power in the early 1970s was due to material factors such as an accumulation of the capacity for and disposition to use organized violence, as important were Suharto’s Javanese cultural perspectives which were meshed with Indonesian national security concerns and policies. The boundaries of Javanese culture and the politics of national security were not only permeable but were jointly constructed within an interdependent framework which nested within the context of Indonesia’s intra-state security dilemma8 and the Cold War. Ideals informing security doctrines were essentially causal: they prescribed not only how to develop security doctrines and plan for security but how to do so in an ideologically correct way. The term culture, in the context of this book, is not employed as a means to explain that Indonesians behave in a certain way because of their culture. Rather, culture is an important lens that offers us a way to interpret actions whose roots may lie elsewhere. In this regard, what is interesting is to investigate how security ideology is culturally determined and, by extension, how such ideologies are then utilized to shape the national security. The case for seeing Suharto’s perspectives on Javanese culture as the epitome of national security policy rest with his actual role in the construction of the national security state and his obvious sharing of views with the predominantly Javanese officers who formed his inner circle of advisors.9 The failure of the Indonesian military to resolve the many security problems in the country’s restive provinces could be attributed to the fact that national security policy was compromised by\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n4\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION 5\n\nits identification with the themes that resonated with Suharto’s broader cultural formation. The pivotal position of stabilitas (stability) and ketertiban (orderliness) as dominant symbols of Javanese10 culture arguably reached its zenith during the Suharto era. The legitimacy of the New Order state was founded on its role as the “restorer of order” (Van Langenberg 1990, p. 126). Such a perception accords with the manner in which “order” or specifically the “avoidance of disorder” is the ultimate obsession of all Javanese villagers. According to Javanese tradition, superior men always seek the safety of others out of their own goodwill or tumprape wong linuwih tansah ngudi keslametaning liyan, metu saka atine dhewe (Patty 2003, p. 25). Hence, any leader attempting to claim legitimacy has to demonstrate an ability to maintain tata-tentram, a Javanese concept that is better translated by the Dutch term, rust en orde (peace and order). For most Javanese the price for avoiding disorder is surrender to authority, or to conform to the needs of community life because continuity and stability are the higher good. New Order cultural discourse with its emphasis on stability and order had an ethnographic history tied to the concept of slamet.11 The Javanese according to Geertz define slamet with the phrase gak ana apa-apa or “nothing is going to happen (to anyone)\" (Geertz 1976, p. 14). MagnisSuseno (1997, p. 86) refers to slamet in the context of a “homogeneous space where individuals live and in which one’s well-being (slamet) is secured when everything is in harmony”. Thus, periods of disorder, namely, the Indonesian revolution of the 1940s, the tensions that accompanied the highly politicized decades of the 1950s, and the violence accompanying Suharto’s rise to power in the mid-1960s, would be anathema to slamet. In a sense, the need to establish a peaceful and secure Indonesia to shore up his legitimacy accounts for Suharto’s obsession with stability and order, which in turn accords with his Javanese worldview where “slametan represents a reassertion and reinforcement of the general cultural order and its power to hold back the forces of disorder” (Geertz 1976, p. 29). In light of the numerous tensions and security challenges faced by Indonesia since independence, slamet represented a “wished-for state” used by Suharto to underwrite a model security order with strong cultural undertones. In tandem with post-1965 “security”, a culture of slamet appeared to have been achieved with the term slamet routinely linked with other terminology associated with the maintenance of the state security apparatus. Within the discourse of slamet appeared,\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n5\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n6\n\nREALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\nfor instance, tata (order), tertib (orderly), and aman (safe, secure), with the word keamanan (a state of security) featured prominently in the names of various state security agencies. For example, the security institution that came to embody the state’s formidable security powers was called KOPKAMTIB or Komando Operasi Pemulihan Keamanan dan Kertertiban (Operations Command to Restore Order and Security). Organizations like KOPKAMTIB implicitly rationalized Suharto’s need to overcome all hindrances or rawe-rawe rantas malang putang that would undermine his legitimacy (Patty 2003, p. 104). Such a perspective was evident in the views of the late General H. Amirmachmud, then Chairman of the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR, Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat) when justifying the Petrus12 killings of the early 1980s. He stressed that “to secure the welfare of more than 146 million Indonesian inhabitants, it is preferable to sacrifice X hundreds of criminals … We are not only creating a state of law, but moving toward a state of law, a state of slamet, and a state of culture” (negara kebudayaan).13 In his biography, Suharto also gave his imprimatur to the killings (Suharto 1989, pp. 389–91) by virtue of the fact that those who “disturb the tranquility of others will be punished by the Lord because of their own deeds” or Sing sapa seneng ngrusak katentremaning liyan bakal dibendu dening Pangeran lan diwelehake dening tumindake dhewe (Patty 2003, p. 76). With a securitized14 perspective of slamet dominating New Order discourse, the traditional-cultural practice of slamet according to Pemberton became “purely tradisional culture free of political and historical implications, a culture dedicated to, as if by nature, its own celebration” (Pemberton 1994, p. 15). In this regard, the ancient bersih desa rituals where farmers give thanks for the bestowal of good fortune in the form of the size of the harvest became an important New Order ritual. Although such prosperity is still commonly glossed by the term slamet (a sense of well-being), here the special resonance of slamet in New Order discourse is made quite explicit, a state of security (keamanan) with all its associations of policed security. To the twin ends of success and security, thus, are dedicated rituals of a “traditional nature”, representations of a generalized “culture of the Indonesian people” (Pemberton 1994, p. 241). Within the broader context of Javanese culture, the polar opposite of slamet is rebut.15 Rebutan according to the Javanese refers to struggles\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n6\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION 7\n\namong rivals fighting over power-laden objects, or in the context of the Javanese historical chronicles, the king’s throne itself. Such acts of rebutan appear as disruptive events, incidents of conflict (konflik) ultimately intolerable and under the New Order mantra of order and stability.16 Although the controlled environment of the New Order meant that the regularity of rebutan was curtailed, however, the tendency to rebut lingered much to the dismay of security authorities. Pemberton concludes: Controversial issues, conflict, disorder, and so on, all of these are associated with the term rebutan within the guarded language of New Order politics. Since the late 1960s, the implicit threat of rebutan disruptions has been countered by constant reference to ‘order and concord, welfare and being, respect and deference,’ and all the other formulations of political stability couched in patently cultural terms. These are terms that would place rebutan outside the realm of possibility because such acts appear to undermine a distinction most essential to New Order rule: that between culture (kebudayaan) and politics (politik) (ibid., p. 258).\n\nAs a mainstay and reinforcer of “cultural order”, for example restrained individualism, controlled emotions and so forth, New Order-influenced slametan events epitomized by village-level bersih desa rituals held in Central Java set the tone and enframed major national events like the General Elections. New Order discourse has constantly portrayed the conduct of national politics during the Parliamentary Democracy era of the 1950s as a chaotic period in Indonesian history. For the sake of order and security, the national elections or “Festival of Democracy” (as it was called), was enframed during the Suharto era in a form of orderliness characteristic of the slametan rather than from the more precarious vantage of rebutan rivalry and contestation. The need to suppress the desire to rebut gained a quiet intensity among the security elite in the New Order era as the tension between slametan and rebutan became exaggerated within official discourse, associating the former with culture and the latter with politics. That no stark distinction existed in Javanese culture (precolonial or otherwise) between order versus disorder in which rebutan and slametan performed as cosmological polar opposites were immaterial to Suharto-era security planners. There are two explanations for this. First, Suharto, aware of Javanese philosophy, knew that if he as a ruler did not provide his people with security, from within their (the people’s) midst would emerge\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n7\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n8\n\nREALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\nothers who could challenge his legitimacy, as reflected in the saying penguwasa iku kudu gawe tentrem para kawulane, marga yen ora mengkono bias dadi kawula ngrebut negara. A ruler has to provide his people with security lest they seize power (ibid., p. 231). Second, the logical extension of such rationale required the all encompassing pursuit of security — slamet — ensuing that the possibility of rebutan struggles would be contained for the sake of stability (stabilitas) and the preservation of Suharto’s legitimacy. Arising from the troubled legacy of the mid-1960s and the conflict-ridden post-independence years, rebutan related to issues pertaining to SARA (an acronym covering Suku [ethnicity], Agama [religion], Ras [race], AntarGolongan [conflict among interest-based groups] needed to be separated from events of those years and recast in the extremely guarded terms of New Order appeals to maintain security at all costs — terms in which struggle of any sort suggests disaster. To achieve such stability, but more importantly, a condition of rasa (a sense of calm satisfaction and absence of tension), an elaborate series of security doctrines were promulgated along with a remarkable array of surveillance and coercive assets employed to secure the state during the Suharto era.17 In pre-colonial times, Indonesia was physically fragmented comprising of a number of smaller nations, each with its own mode of governance. Indonesian “national consciousness” was, according to Kahin, a product of Dutch colonial policy that welded the various ethnic and religious groups in the archipelago into one political unit.18 Although the majority of the population lives on the island of Java with the Javanese the biggest ethnic group, there is religious, cultural and ethnic diversity, and Indonesia’s leaders have adopted the national motto Bhineka Tunggal Eka (Unity in Diversity) and the state ideology Pancasila to promote the norms of consensus and harmony. Throughout the course of this study, references will be made to political– security concepts like Pancasila (the five basic principles of the Indonesian state) or for that matter its military-ideological extension — the Sapta Marga (the seven milestones of the Indonesian army). For Indonesians, symbols are important. What is empirically meant by such “concepts” (konsepsi) is generally marginalized when such words take the form of a “sacred” word. Such words are taken from Sanskrit and are not generally understood by the population. However, what these words are expected to convey is “that circumstances are essentially in order when they are placed into the right category, within the\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n8\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION 9\n\ncorrect conceptual framework” (Magnis-Suseno 1997, p. 94). Indonesians are often heard lamenting, with a smile: “It’s only a question of implementation!”. Unfortunately, despite the fact that policies are conceptualized coherently, implementation can be compromised through a tendency toward fatalism where one individual is expected to come up with a right formula to address a problem, thereby giving a particular event or problem “its place in the cosmic order and placing it into cosmic harmony” (ibid.). The task of implementation depends purely on the work of cosmic forces rather than the efforts of an individual. If the urgency to solve Indonesia’s myriad security problems are not apparent, a certain degree of understanding is required for the observer to comprehend Indonesia’s security dilemma within the context of its beliefs and norms. By no means do common people feel overwhelmed by their circumstances. To overcome such insecurity, Indonesians are apt to place their trust in those they feel can manipulate the cosmic forces that determine their lives. Therefore, it is not surprising for Indonesians to put their trust in individuals who are perceived as having great inner strength and are able to sustain their powers by concentration and meditation. Such people can “bring benefit to society, heal sickness, calculate propitious times, and determine favourable sites or places, and effect the fecundity of mothers and fields … These powers can also be used to further egoistic interests or to harm others” (ibid., pp. 94–95). Suharto filled this role perfectly and in the process was very successful in weaving a security ideology that revolved around Javanese norms that provided a sense of reassurance to a population weary after the tribulations of the Sukarno era. The twin norms of stability and development (stabilitas dan pembangunan) not only became Suharto’s ideology where development-with-security became the hallmark of the New Order but also a legitimizing tool as Suharto sought to replicate the qualities of a powerful Javanese king. According to Magnis-Suseno: ... from a powerful king, peace and prosperity streamed outwards across the breath of the land … no external opponent, nor internal unrest can disturb the peasants working in the paddy-fields because the power concentrated in the king is so great that all factors that could instigate unrest are rendered powerless, dried out as it were; their power to upset things have been sucked off into the king. Throughout the land, peace and justice reign and everyone can go about his business free from fear and from\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n9\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n10 REALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\nsurprises of any kind … Indications of the strength of rulers are therefore order and fertility in society and nature, thus when peace prevails, good harvests have been put away, everyone has enough to eat and clothes to wear and there is a general climate of satisfaction, a condition the Javanese call adil makmur (justice and prosperity). Such a society is said to realize the Javanese ideals of tata tentrem karta rahaja (order, peace, prosperity and happiness) (ibid., p. 103).\n\nSuch Javanese conceptions of authority, leadership and power characterized much of Suharto’s tenure. Power and authority were in the hands of a small group and their agencies, namely the President himself, the military and the state’s intelligence apparatus, The power of a Javanese king is total. To create an aura of keagung-binataraan,19 all obstructions had to be overcome and those responsible for such obstructions were severely punished. Here, again, the proverb, rawe-rawe rantas, malangmalang putung (Moedjanto 1986, p. 152; Patty 2003, p. 104) is instructive in explaining the ruthless methods employed by the security agencies in dealing with opposition movements. A Javanese king’s greatness and power is measured in material terms by the expanse of his kingdom; size of his army; his wealth, titles and fame; faithfulness of his regents and officials in carrying out his orders; his pusaka (heirlooms) and desire to control all aspects of life and socioeconomic activities of the community as well as the government of the country (Moedjanto 1986, pp. 102–16). In return, the kasektan or supernatural power of the king would ensure the welfare of his subjects and they would feel a sense of security because the king would give his protection (ibid., p. 106). According to Javanese cosmology, society is characterized as a big family founded on mutual obligations and social hierarchy is structured in such a way that obligations are not equal to all in so much as some are expected to guide while the rest follow. Hence, the concept of leadership is characterized by the belief in “leading by example in the front; inspiring in the midst of the people; and encouraging from behind” (ing ngarso sung tulodo; ing madya mangun karso; tut wuri handayani) (Said 1991, p. 142). For the Javanese, a leader should possess qualities of a guardian (pengasuh) to lead, guide and to stimulate ones under him (asuhan). Those in power and authority are accorded extreme reverence and they should be followed and honoured. It is considered sinful (durhaka) for followers to go against their leaders.\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n10\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nSuharto portrayed himself as embodying such virtues and sought through his security policies to prevent disorder or unrest which would imply a disturbance in cosmic harmony and thereby a threat to society. To avoid such a situation, the most reasonable outcome is for a Javanese to avoid conflict (rukun). As a consequence, the rukun principle requires a security ideology to be crafted “to prevent disturbances of social peace so that conflicts never rise to the surface” (Said 1991, p. 96). Throughout its post-independence history, Indonesia has faced challenges in its quest for national unity. Indonesia’s security planners, barring in mind the rukun principle, moved away from approaches to define security in terms of military threats and the attendant military forces needed to define such threats. They chose to define Indonesia’s approach to security in multidimensional terms thereby, targeting issues that have a propensity to give rise to conflict. As defined by Hasnan Habib: “Indonesia’s experience since independence has shown that the term ‘security’ denotes and connotes all aspects of national life that is ideology, politics, the economy, society, culture and the military”.20 Under-girding this approach to national security is the concept of National Resilience (Ketahanan Nasional), which incorporates a holistic approach to the nation’s capacity to overcome internal and external threats. In the words of Suharto’s leading strategist, Ali Murtopo: The concept of national resilience is aimed at the creation of an all embracing national order or system that would embody the capability of the nation to defend itself and at the same time to foil any threat from within as well as from without to its security and its continued existence … national resilience in total integral and strategic way covers all aspects of the life of the State and the Nation: ideological, social, political, economic, cultural, technological, defence and security (1976, p. 21).\n\nMuthiah Alagappa has referred to five factors that have shaped Indonesia’s concept of national resilience’s deep focus on internal security: first, the legacy of Indonesia’s long struggle for national liberation and subsequently its difficult process of nation building; second, its complex ethinc and cultural divisions creating strong centrifugal forces; third, a weak military in terms of capability; fourth, the challenges faced by the regime’s desire for stability and survival in the face of domestic political challenges; and fifth, the concern that domestic conflict could create conditions for external intervention (Alagappa 1988, p. 58). Based on\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n11\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n12 REALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\nthese perspectives, the Indonesian concept of national resilience is inwardlooking and its quest for national security revolves around domestic factors based on political stability, economic and social progress and a sense of nationalism and self-reliance rather than alliances or great power guarantees. As the cornerstone of the New Order security doctrine, national resilience justified the military’s involvement in national life but more importantly allowed it to define a range of groups as threats to security, namely communists and left-wing organizations, religious groups, secessionist movements, trade unions and political dissidents (Lowry 1996, pp. 3–6). The epistemological rigidity of such a holistic system was easily rationalized and reinforced the notions of Javanese culture that Suharto used to legitimize his regime. The agents of the state responsible for implementing such a holistic security strategy were the military. In this regard, the military’s Dual Function or Dwifungsi not only gave it a dual role in the external defence of the nation and its internal security but it elevated the military into a central force in national life, while projecting a powerful perception of strategic, political and existential vulnerability into the heart of Indonesia’s sense of self. The military in a sense became a conduit to link the government to the masses. The formal expression of this role was the Sishankamrata (Sistem Pertahanan Rakyat Semesta) or Total People’s Defence and Security System. As Robert Lowry contends: A feature of Indonesian conceptions of defence and security has been their holistic nature which has, in part, evolved from discussion of the nature of the state by early nationalist leaders, from the experience of the 1945–49 Revolution, from the internal security campaigns conducted thereafter, and from 1960s system theory. Doctrinal manuals are laced with systems theory diagrams in which every element is part of a component which is part of hierarchy of subsystems comprising a system. In such structures individualism has no place and deviation of the most basic element can cause the entire system to malfunction. The holistic approach, which attempts to locate all elements of nature and human endeavour in a macro system or universal order, strikes a chord in Indonesia because it reflects the traditional view of the Javanese, in particular, which sees the individual as merely a thread in the cosmic fibre (ibid., p. xx).\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n12\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nThe logic was simple. The regime’s security doctrine which reflected the ideology and values of the 1945 generation of officers assigns the military a dual function which accorded with the romanticism and tradition associated to the TNI’s origins as a guerrilla army. This doctrine validates that the military’s role encompasses a defence and security function as well as a socio-political role, thereby making it a guardian of the state and a participant in the political process. In this latter role, the TNI not only becomes an instrument of the state but a guardian of the regime, along with right-minded citizens and social groups. The military’s approach to strategic, operational and tactical doctrines stresses the preeminence of interrelationships. This explains the penchant for all-encompassing acronyms such as Ipoleksosbudmilag, which stands for ideology, politics, economics, society, culture, the military and religion. The rationale for such an approach relates to the idea “that if all these elements are considered and analysed for any given problem, a balanced solution can be arrived at and harmony restored or created” (ibid., p. xx). This allowed the military enormous scope to shape societal norms, identity and culture. A significant offshoot of this process is a militaristic culture manifested specifically in the behaviour of non-military groups. Paramilitary groups drawing legitimacy from the independence-era pemuda21 tradition and through identification with military procedures such as organizational structure (command, troops, units, corps, strategies, logistics, equipment), military symbols (uniforms, ranks, medals of merit, auxiliary instruments), attitude and actions such as speech, appearance and personal relationships may convey the impression that they are more militaristic in outlook than orthodox security forces. The development of paramilitary groups is a good example of how the norms and values of a military-dominated structure have shaped behavioural patterns in such a way that aggressiveness,22 alertness, discipline and obedience become the hallmarks of people who work as security guards (Satpam, Satuan Pengamanan) or are associated with people’s defence, taskforce units, and vigilante groups complete with military-like symbols and equipment. Public acceptance of the existence of extra-constitutional paramilitary groups has its roots in the country’s militaristic history. School classes, women’s groups and workers’ associations take pride in their paramilitary parades and military-style hierarchies. As long as such paramilitary organizations adhere to prevailing laws and function effectively in compliance with current regulations, their\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n13\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n14 REALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\nactivities could be considered complementary to military and police efforts to maintain law and order. However, militia activity has sometimes resulted in the escalation of violence and contributed to acute intra-state conflict in Aceh, East Timor and Maluku. The strategic focus of Indonesia’s military doctrine expressed in the Kebijakan Pertahanan Negara 2000 by the Department of Defence (DEPHAN, Departemen Pertahanan) is premised on minimizing the severity of its regional security dilemma and the financial burden placed on the state resulting from a military buildup. Despite its size, strategic geographical position and its potential as a middle power characterized by an assertive foreign policy (with varying emphasis) during both the Sukarno and Suharto eras based on what Michael Leifer (1983, p. 173) defines as its “regional entitlement”, Indonesia chooses to arm itself modestly. On the basis of its resource wealth and preAsian crisis economic growth rates, Indonesia should have possessed a credible defence force.23 The key to resolving this puzzling enigma lies in the nature of the Indonesian domestic political process rather than the nature of the international system. Economic development norms and the need to preserve national unity became the dominating logic for of the Suharto-era privileging of an inward-looking security perspective.24 Due to its historic sensitivity to threats to Indonesia’s territorial integrity, the Indonesian military has been conditioned to use force against any domestic challenge to the state. Such feelings of insecurity can be attributed to Indonesia’s experience, particularly in the first two decades immediately after independence when a series of rebellions nearly brought the country to its knees. Such feelings of insecurity are heightened by the Javanese cultural norm of pessimism, inherent fear and suspicion of the unknown. These perspectives have given rise to a readiness to employ coercion and account for why power politics or realpolitik approaches remain a significant factor in Indonesian security ideology. However, despite the fact that the ability to use lethal force against external security contingencies developed progressively as the country’s economic circumstances improved, the TNI’s military capabilities had been hamstrung by Suharto’s desire to meet national development objectives and a focus on internal security contingencies rather than policies aimed at boosting defence spending for external defence. Suharto was aided by a generally benign external security environment during the Cold War. Added to this, Suharto’s immense stature within Southeast Asia allowed a leading role for\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n14\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nIndonesia in shaping ASEAN security norms — in the process ensuring a propitious external security outlook. While the reliance on diplomacy within Southeast Asian to compensate for Indonesia’s lack of external defence capability was an indication that purely material explanations for Indonesia’s external defence strategies cannot suffice, it also indicates the acute sense of internal insecurity since independence. Hence, the need to formulate a security ideology to compensate for Indonesia’s material inadequacies has given rise to an ideological formulation asserting the “organic totality of the state”, the Wawasan Nusantara (archipelagic concept) as Van Langenberg correctly describes: envisages, in both abstract and material form, the unification of the archipelagic nation-state as a total organism. In the context of the state-system, it places central-regional relations in a specific context of national defence and security, stressing unity above decentralization (1990, p. 124).\n\nSuch an outlook no doubt reinforces not only the TNI’s strong aversion to the post-Suharto decentralization laws as well as a propensity to use coercion in dealing with “threats” to Indonesia’s territorial integrity.25 Would such a latent sense of “insecurity” that is part of the Javanese cultural makeup compromise Indonesia’s external security outlook thereby making it threatening to its regional neighbours? Not according to Dewi Fortuna Anwar, who concludes that Indonesia’s view of the outside world does not entirely fit materialist or power accumulation perspectives, arguing that geography insulates Indonesia from anarchical world conditions due to its location away from the major powers and the seas surrounding it, allowing some protection from external threats. This has led to the development of an inward-looking defence posture where ruling elites view domestic threats to national unity as the key security concern. Defence priorities are oriented towards maintaining national unity against domestic challenges to the regime, which are seen as likely to stem from remnants of communism, religious extremism, foreign cultural influences and separatist movements. To strengthen her assertion that Indonesia’s security doctrines are benign, Anwar points to the essentially inward-looking nature of Indonesia’s main security doctrines, namely, the Wawasan Nusantara concept, the National Resilience (Ketahanan Nasional) Doctrine and the Total People’s Defence and Security System (Sishankamrata). She argues that because of its\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n15\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n16 REALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\ngeographic fragmentation and basic military weakness, Indonesia has adopted a strategy to insulate itself from hostile external forces thereby relying on diplomacy and regional cooperation (Anwar 1998, pp. 477– 512). Are there instances where Indonesia has behaved aggressively or displayed expansionist tendencies in the region? Here it is useful to revisit the mandala concept. According to Zimmer, mandala political perspectives reinforce the perception that enemies rather than friends surround the centre of power (Zimmer 1956, p. 113–18). Adopting a mandala approach, the first circle (in concentric rings where the first circle is closest to the centre of power) always comprises the enemy, which invariably refers to the states closest to the centre. Such states, due to their proximity are considered more belligerent than those located further away from the centre of the mandala. There is no necessity to use examples going back hundreds of years to understand whether Indonesian security perspectives are benign. Here, the aggressive nationalism pursued against the Dutch in the War of Independence; the strong anti-colonial policy that formed the backdrop of Confrontation against Malaysia and Singapore in the mid-1960s; the sentiment of “meta-geography” (Cribb 2002, pp. 230–31) which existed since 1945 and may have rationalized the invasion of East Timor in 1975; the military’s callous scorched earth policy in the aftermath of the UNadministered referendum there in 1999; the brutal conflict in Aceh which began in 1989; plus the countless incidences where the use of force has been employed against its own citizens, may suggest that there is a cultural basis to Indonesian realpolitik, which shapes Indonesia’s strategic outlook.26 Indeed Suharto felt he could never be respected if he did not have his territory intact, which is my interpretation of the saying pengged hening Negara dialem kuwasa, kendel dan pinter yen ana daerah (Patty 2003, pp. 168–69). In this regard, Javanese culture extols the virtues of war and stresses that combatants should not be afraid because wars are fought for truth or akeh wong kang wedi kahanan perang, awit hokum kang becik akeh kang ora kanggo, mula banjur wedi perang. Iku kabeh keliru, jalaran perang iku uga kepingin mbelani kabeneran (ibid., pp. 208–9). Yet, such an outlook has to a certain extent been ameliorated by Indonesia’s lack of material capabilities; a weak external security dilemma; and a heavy dependence on diplomacy as the first line of defence. Such ideas have found expression in Javanese proverbs on going into conflict without military forces and by stressing the value of\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n16\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\ndiplomacy. In diplomacy, a country should try to win a battle without going to war, and without causing the opponent to lose face or menang tanpa ngasorake (ibid., p. 103). Such an approach epitomizes the Javanese principle of tolerance. While non-military approaches to national security are a constant theme in Indonesian security policy, there is enough empirical evidence on the record to challenge Anwar’s emphasis that Indonesian security ideology is pacific. For example, Indonesia’s doctrine of Territorial Warfare does stress the value of violent solutions to security conflicts and of offensive over defensive strategies. No doubt, the doctrine does emphasize the need for flexibility. Indonesia is expected to use noncoercive means when confronted with a more powerful adversary. However, such actions are more for the sake of expediency until a situation arises where its defence forces are confident of prevailing against the enemy. In this regard, Indonesia’s security planners in the mid-1990s had identified a Defence Buffer Zone (Daerah Pertahanan Penyanggah) comprising of an area located beyond its Exclusive Economic Zone, and a Main Defence Area (Daerah Pertahanan Utama) within its territorial waters, where it envisages its conduct of military operations against a direct external attack.27 While this explains its defensive strategy, it may also shed some light on its offensive doctrine, which is to fight beyond the territories of the state. It could be argued that Indonesia’s desire to develop more offensive strategies has been thwarted considerably not only due to resource limitations but advantages Suharto calculated could accrue as a consequence of activist diplomacy and economic incentives.28 Nevertheless, among Indonesia’s neighbours, there will always be apprehension of the lurking threat posed by Indonesia due to its sheer geographical size and bellicose history. In theory, Indonesia’s strategy of “active defensive deterrence” allows for a pre-emptive strike and the conduct of operations against an aggressor’s home bases and lines of communication. However, Indonesia’s strategic strike capability is almost non-existent and its ability to lift, protect and sustain offensive forces is extremely limited. Its strategy relies on deterring potential aggressors with the warning that any invasion will be met by “total people’s defence”, that is, Indonesia’s conventional defence forces would be backed by a trained and motivated populace who would wear down any occupying force with unrelenting guerrilla war. Indonesia’s overall strategic goal is to maintain internal security and to reduce the intensity of its domestic intra-state security dilemma and its mild external security dilemma in Southeast Asia. To\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n17\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n18 REALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\nachieve its goal, Indonesia maintains a force structure that privileges the Army over the Air Force and Navy in a bid to maintain the integrity of the archipelago. To ensure that its sovereignty is not compromised places a high degree of emphasis on diplomacy to compensate for its modest and purely defensive military capabilities. In this regard, the approach to national security does not limit itself purely to domestic security contingencies; it has an indirect implication for its external strategic environment. The approach to national security focuses attention on the nexus between national and regional security in the form of regional resilience. From the Indonesian perspective, regional resilience is obtained on the basis of a consolidation of the national resilience of every domestic regional actor. The success of this Indonesian formulation becoming the leitmotif of ASEAN regional security cooperation has resulted in Indonesia generally having what could be considered a mild external security dilemma. Though we may be stretching the argument a little, there is a sense that regional resilience is a form of “ideological forward defence” construed in Javanese terms as an invasion without deploying troops or nglurug tanpa bala (Patty 2003, p. 101). Any other security approach would intensify the security dilemma surrounding Indonesia as well as generate a financial burden on its economy therefore compromising economic development priorities. As long as Indonesia works in tandem with its ASEAN neighbours, the security dilemma it faces remains moderate. With the existence of a strong web of bilateral military linkages within ASEAN, such solidarity has the mutual benefit of keeping Indonesia’s ambitions within a regional framework at the same time acting as a buffer insulating its porous archipelago from external threats. In sum, the combined causal factors that shape the realpolitik ideology of Indonesia’s security elites are a consequence of an acute intra-state security dilemma and mild regional security dilemma predicated on a security strategy structured to conserve economic resources while targeting low-intensity threats which compromise national development goals. These elements form the theoretical core when assessing the sources of Indonesia’s defence and security doctrines.29 REFLECTING ON RESEARCH STRATEGY Research for this book was based on both primary and secondary materials.

The collapse of the Suharto regime the following year required me to take stock and analyse the ramifications of change as Indonesia’s complex transition impacted on the defence and security establishment. The helter-skelter nature of the Habibie era was witnessed primarily from the confines of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS). Though resources for fieldwork were not available, this was to be a small impediment as ISEAS became a useful transit point for scholars from Indonesia who while ensconced in Singapore, regularly provided a sense of reassurance for concerned Singapore audiences horrified by the “unravelling” of Indonesia and the scale of violence graphically depicted by the local media. Many of these scholars, who became close personal friends, provided useful alternative perspectives based on their own experiences, which contrasted with the pessimism displayed by the media and the regular contention by security analysts that the “Balkanization” of Indonesia was imminent. Through insights from such seminars and the numerous conversations I had with a large number of Indonesian visitors, I was able to develop a draft manuscript that I was reasonably satisfied with in September 2000 as the promise of the Abdurahman Wahid presidency began its slow descent into another “rebutan” phase characteristic of the Habibie interregnum. Wahid’s conflict with General Wiranto in early 2001 brought with it another crisis of civil–military relations and frustratingly for the author, another period of delay in finishing the book as friends in Jakarta alerted me to discussions taking place within policy circles on a new Defence Law and Police Law. It was a difficult choice to make in January 2001 as to whether to proceed with plans to have the manuscript published in the politically fluid era of the Wahid presidency where the pace of change in Indonesia would invariably make the book absolutely irrelevant when published or wait until some semblance of stability returned to the field of defence and security as Wahid took on the DPR and the TNI in mid-2001 in his quest to save his embattled presidency. I felt for the sake of credibility, the wise, though not necessarily “career-correct” choice would be to\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n19\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\n20 REALPOLITIK IDEOLOGY\n\nwait and see what the outcomes would be as the Parliament (DPR, Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat) deliberated on the key national security laws in question. These two critical pieces of legislation passed in late 2001, particularly the National Defence Law, missing in much of the latest research31 on the Indonesian military, are significant developments bolstering my argument that the legal instruments for the demise of the national security state in Indonesia are well and truly entrenched and resistance by the security apparatus while understandable, is futile in the long-run. I was now at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. For the first time, since a short visit to Jakarta for a CSCAP conference on Indonesia hosted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on 8 March 2000, I finally had access to funds for fieldwork. A brief consultancy with the Trade Development Board (now International Enterprise Singapore) was also useful in allowing me an opportunity to have an extended visit to Indonesia. These were valuable opportunities to meet many senior officers of the TNI, bureaucrats, politicians, academics, NGO activists, journalists and businesspeople to develop a deeper understanding of Indonesia and the immense changes taking place not only in the defence and security establishment but the country as a whole. The writings of Indonesians both within and outside the military establishment were analysed and they generally encompassed two categories. Those who were knowledgeable and had an active interest in military matters and others selected on the basis of their personal influence, even though they may not necessarily have enjoyed first-hand experience of involvement in the military, namely journalists, politicians, intellectuals and others representing civil society. Visits were also made in 2002 as the implications of the September 11 attacks made its profound mark on Indonesian society. Over a period of two years (2001–02), I was able to achieve some distance from the original manuscript which benefited me in three ways. First, it allowed me greater objectivity (though I leave such judgements to my readers). Second, if the initial manuscript allowed me an opportunity to delve into the historical aspects of Indonesian national security planning, my interests had evolved over the past two years, making the historical element only part of what challenged investigation. Armed with new insights, I wanted to consider further the ramifications of Indonesia’s complex transition and its impact on the entrenched logic of the national security state struc-\n\n00d RPI Intr p1-26\n\n20\n\n4/11/06, 10:32 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\ntures that for so long regulated life in Indonesia. Third, I felt, this new approach, namely an expansion of the timeframe, would relate to a wider audience, specifically those who have developed an interest on Indonesia since the economic crisis of 1997. My hope is that readers will come away not only with a more comprehensive portrait of the TNI, through the details of its doctrine, organization and equipment of TNI, but an understanding of where the TNI can be best positioned in a democratizing Indonesia.

The exception is Robert Lowry, Armed Forces of Indonesia, (St. Leonard’s, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1996). Lowry’s is an excellent study on defence planning and force structure. While not the emphasis of the book, the reader would have benefited from a deeper analysis of the “sources” of security doctrines and defence operational concepts."
