I assume that the solution is to remove the United States Air Force portal tag from each of them? Just checking before I do it. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nTaking silence as consent, I removed the USAF portal tag from one and it resolved the issue. I shall wait 24 hours to see if anyone complains, including here, and then work through the rest. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nThanks for taking this on, Gog. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nWe made need a larger effort though, in a routine pass through WP:AN and WP:ANI I spotted this: Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)#Proposal_to_delete_Portal_space. If it goes through (and honestly it seems like it will) then all portals save but for a precious and actually useful few will be torpedoed, which will in turn require cleanup across a larger space. TomStar81 (Talk)\n\nI've personally brought at least two dozen military portals to MfD – including Portal:Napoleonic Wars, Portal:Military of Greece, Portal:Military of ancient Rome, Portal:Military history of France, Portal:Military history of Africa, Portal:Military history of the Ottoman Empire, Portal:Arab–Israeli conflict, Portal:Royal Navy,Portal:Terrorism, Portal:Royal Air Force, Portal:British Army, Portal:Canadian Armed Forces, Portal:Royal Australian Navy, Portal:NATO, Portal:United Nations, Portal:United States Marine Corps, Portal:September 11 attacks, Portal:Ancient warfare, Portal:United States Air Force, Portal:United States Navy, Portal:United States Merchant Marine, Portal:United States Coast Guard, Portal:Military of the United States and Portal:United States Army. User:BrownHairedGirl has an AutoWikiBrowser set up that replaces the dead portal with a broader portal like Portal:War, but some zombie backlinks slip through. Mark Schierbecker (talk)\n\nTo me, there are two requirements for the retention of a portal: active maintenance and sufficient views. If a portal lacks either (or both) it probably shouldn't exist. We just need a way of cleaning up afterwards, which it looks like BHG has in hand (with the exception of the zombies). Any way of tweaking the AWB to make sure it is more thorough? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nAs far as I know, BHG's script is only replacing portal links in the article itself, not links in our project banner (which is what's throwing up these errors). Given that the way the portals are linked from the banner is completely different from how they're linked within the article, I suspect that significant changes would be required to the script to work in this scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, if we simply want to eliminate all of the errors en masse, we could just tweak the banner template to automatically hide links to deleted portals rather than flagging them as an error condition. Is that something we want to do at this point? Kirill Lokshin (talk)\n\nG'day Kirill could you just do that? Thanks, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nPeacemaker67, I've updated the template code so that it will ignore references to portals that no longer exist. Note that it will still flag an error if the main portal page exists, but the referenced subpage doesn't.\n\nAs always, please let me know if you see anything broken as a result of the template change. Kirill Lokshin (talk)\n\nThanks Kirill! Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nYesterday I was thinking about the September drive who just ended and I saw there were still 23,395 articles who need a full B-Class checklist. Those are a lot of articles and I do not think the drive took a lot of them out. They're mostly forgotten in the project. So my idea is to make it like the assessment department, a little contest with the people who (are interested and) want to work with these topics. And like the contest department, the top three get a reward to work hours and hours into those checklists, they'd get it at the start of the next month. At the start of the month, we can check the articles (whether they are really from them) they worked on or maybe (if possible) the bot can do that? My idea is to try to decrease the 23,395 articles who are getting more and more articles every day so I think it's safe to make it a contest of. Any ideas are welcome? Cheers. CPA-5 (talk)\n\nI think that is a good idea. The devil is in the detail, but I like the concept. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI wonder if we could roll it into the quarterly reviewing tally? Perhaps turn the whole thing into a monthly reviewing contest along the same lines as the article writing contest - different reviews would be worth different amounts of points. Or we could still run the quarterly bot report separately to catch people who do reviews but aren't interested in entering the contest (there's still value in recognizing their contributions, I think). Parsecboy (talk)\n\nI've been keeping half an eye on this category since it was set up in October 2017. A while ago I started clearing through from the start of the alphabet (someone else, not sure who, had started from the back and got up to V), but I haven't slogged through for some time. The numbers are actually slowly decreasing: it was 25,200 in February 2018. Over the course of September's drive the backlog actually reduced from 23,713 to 23,399 despite all the new articles tagged (although the April 2018 drive had no real effect on the number). I would support a concerted effort to reduce this backlog, which also should help us to meet our long term target of achieving 15% of all articles rated B-Class or better - Dumelow (talk)\n\nThose stats are interesting. I'm wondering if a bot could at least add an empty B-Class checklist to all Milhist tagged articles that a. don't have one, and b. aren't already FA, A or GA. I realise that would just move the work to the unassessed category, but it would massively reduce the amount of typing required in each assessment. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI've added the data to User:Dumelow/MILHIST B-class assessment stats and drawn up some graphs. I haven't been that diligent in collecting data so there's some big gaps (generally between periods when I was active in working on the missing checklist backlog) but it shows a few interesting trends:\n\nThere's a few peaks and troughs but in general the missing B-class checklist backlog has been coming down\n\nThe April 2018 drive did not reduce the missing b-class checklist backlog but the September 2019 one did\n\nMilhist drives significantly increase the number of B-class articles\n\nThe drives also significantly increase the number of articles tagged such that the overall article quality (as measured by the percentage completion against our long-term 15% of all articles at B-class or better target) remains broadly unchanged\n\nIn general the proportion of articles at B-class or better has been steadily increasing\n\nI'll see if I can keep this stats page up to date now I am a bit more active. I have probably diverged far enough from CPA-5's original point above now so I'll shut up. But I am more than happy to chip into any backlog reduction drive - Dumelow (talk)\n\nPerhaps a permanently running event, awarded quarterly, ie similar to the current review awards; based on the first three elements of the annual contest and with a similar scale of awards, but no first, second, third places. I am assuming that we could use much of the infrastructure of the annual contest, and so it would be easy to set up. Of course, this may reduce participation in the annual contast, but I doubt that it would reduce the annual total of tagging and assessing. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI think a permanently running event or a monthly reviewing contest are both great ideas. I believe this can indeed reduce the number of articles. I do not think this is an issue. These are work points who can be solved to make the project smoother, this also would solve the long problem of forgetting this topic and how we should deal with this problem. I think we might stimulate some editors to take part in the new drive/contest. This would reduce the numbers a little bit faster than it is now. I think like Tom asked us this is my long term idea. Dumelow could you ping us when the stats' page is up to date? But are we doing this and what should it become? A monthly reviewing contest or a permanently running event? Cheers. CPA-5 (talk)\n\nWhat I'm getting from this is there are two things we need to achieve. One is a (preferably automated, given we are talking about 25,000 articles) way to add empty B-Class checklists to all articles that don't already have them, and aren't already FA, A-Class or GA, and the second is a perhaps quarterly? contest for filling out the B-Class checklists (ie assessment below GA), which would just need a permanent drive-type page like the monthly contest page, perhaps with a transcluded worklist page. Am I reading this right? Hawkeye7, is there any way that Milhistbot could do the former job? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nYes, that shouldn't be a problem. I will prepare a Bot run to do this. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nFrom my point of view, yes, you are. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nThanks, and thanks Hawkeye. I think the only major variable will be whether a given banner already has the |class= field, in my experience, some do, some don't. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nBot proposal\n\nFrom the look of it, each of them has a MILHIST banner with a |class= field filled in. They have been added manually by the New Page Patrollers. Some have blank (|b1=|b2=|b3=|b4=|b5=) assessments. All have been assessed as Start, C or B. To get them out of the category, the bot will need to fill in the assessments. Blank ones will not do. Now, the Bot knows the answers to b1, b3 and b5. That leaves b2 and b4, to which it can apply some heuristics, or can infer from the human assessment. So here is my proposal:\n\nThe Bot accepts the human-assigned class ratings\n\nThe Bot fills in the assessments\n\nWhere the Bot believes that the article deserves a B, it will flag it for human assessment\n\nI realise that this goes beyond what you were thinking of, but 25,000 articles is too many for a drive. My feeling is that the overwhelming majority are Starts that are of little concern to us and could be swept up; I will generate some statistics on what the Bot's assessment of the situation is, and report back. We can start with assessment of a small number so we can inspect the results. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nIf it's easy to set up the bot, let's do a couple of hundred and have a look at them. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI will do a sample run and report back. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nHere is a sampler, with the Bot looking at the first five of 25,000, with the proposed changes. In each case, the B-class checklist was missing or empty, and all the Bot is programmed to do is add it. Note that 2016 Indian Line of Control strike would be flagged for human review. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\n1: Talk:2015 Qamishli bombings prediction = C has infobox {{MILHIST|class=start|Middle-Eastern=y|Asian=y|Post-Cold-War=y|b1=no|b2=yes|b3=yes|b4=yes|b5=yes}} 2: Talk:2016 Butig clashes prediction = C has infobox {{WikiProject Military history|class=start|Southeast-Asian=y|Post-Cold-War=y|b1=no|b2=yes|b3=yes|b4=yes|b5=yes}} 3: Talk:2016 Indian Line of Control strike prediction = B has infobox {{WikiProject Military history|class=C|South-Asian=y|Post-Cold-War=y|b1=no|b2=yes|b3=yes|b4=yes|b5=yes}} 4: Talk:2017 attack on the Iraqi embassy in Kabul prediction = Start has infobox {{WikiProject Military history|b1=no|b2=no|b3=yes|b4=yes|b5=yes|class=start|South-Asian-task-force=y}} 5: Talk:2017 Deir ez-Zor missile strike prediction = C has infobox {{WikiProject Military history|b1=no|b2=yes|b3=yes|b4=yes|b5=yes|Middle-Eastern-task-force=y|Asian=yes|Post-Cold-War-task-force=yes|importance=Mid|class=start}}\n\nIs this just adding an empty checklist, Hawkeye? It seems to be populating the checklist as well? I just looked at Talk:2017 Deir ez-Zor missile strike and it currently has a class field (at the end) and a blank checklist? Just a minor point, could we put the blank checklist immediately after the class field in the same order as in the documentation for the template? Having the class and checklist in consecutive fields will make things a little easier for those doing the assessment, and there are some minor syntax quirks in the banner code which can play up if things aren't in the right order. One I know of is the |A-Class= field, it pops up into Category:Military history articles needing attention to tagging if it isn't immediately behind the class field. I don't know that there are any with the positioning of the class and checklist fields, but better to just stick to the documentation. Thanks very much for your work on this so far, Hawkeye! Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nNow that I have actually read the proposal properly... I reckon this is a pretty good approach. I'm not sure that all pages will have a class field though, I was clearing out a category yesterday and there were several with just the bare {{WPMILHIST}} banner. I agree that where we really need to be doing some human checking is with B (and possibly C) class articles. I reckon the number of bot-assessed B-Class articles will be low, less than a hundred, so human checking all the Bs won't be at all onerous. I have a query about the bot logic. Is the bot just looking for a template at the end of each para for b1? If so, could it be picking up cn tags as citations? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI have come across articles which I would fail on B1 despite having each paragraph adequately referenced because they have extensive and entirely uncited infoboxes full of information not repeated in the article. Most 18th-century ships fall into this category. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI am not sure how concerned we are or want to be about accuracy (and some of the following comments may be based on my misinterpretation of the criteria) but looking at the five sampled:\n\n2015 Qamishli bombings: I am not sure why \"b1=no\", it looks fine to me. Surely b3 should be no; there is no attempt at a lead, the first section/paragraph goes straight into the event, and the second is labelled \"Aftermath\".\n\n2016 Butig clashes: Looks good.\n\n2016 Indian Line of Control strike: \"b1=no\"? There is a \"citation needed\" tag at the end of the \"De-escalation section\", which was picked up by the bot and reflected in the code and would make the prediction C, not B.\n\n2017 attack on the Iraqi embassy in Kabul: what is the b1 issue? And b2 seems borderline; I would have given it for B class, but wouldn't have argued if a human editor had tagged it as no.\n\n2017 Deir ez-Zor missile strike: Looks good.\n\nOverall I am impressed. I wouldn't mind another sample, perhaps a little larger, spread across a wider range of task forces, to make sure that what we're looking at is representative.\n\nI agree, this is bloody good so far. Could we run one on a random letter of the alphabet, on say 25 or even 50 articles? That's only a fraction of what we are about to unleash it on, but will probably cover a good number of task forces to get a more representative sample and provide some additional quality assurance. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nThese are good questions:\n\nIn the case of a bare {{WPMILHIST}} template, the Bot will fill in the class and checklist. It has no instructions regarding task forces. It could assess these too though.\n\n2015 Qamishli bombings: The b1=no was because Bot was confused by the appearance of an infobox outside the lead. I will have to cater for this. The Bot cannot assess a lead based on its content. It looks like a lead, and was accepted as such.\n\n2016 Indian Line of Control strike: The Bot assessed b1=no based on a \"citation required\" tag. It therefore corrected rendered it as C class. However, the Bot's mission is to swee p up the Start and C class articles, and flag the B class ones for further checking. It therefore will flag if one of the following is true:\n\nThe human has tagged the article as B class;\n\nThe Bot thinks that all five of the checklist items should be true;\n\nThe Bot thinks the article looks pretty good, based on its own judgement. It this case, it has flagged an article for checking where it missed out only by one tag.\n\n2017 attack on the Iraqi embassy in Kabul An error on my part; the Bot assessed b1 as yes and b2 as no, but I had them around the wrong way. Will correct. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nWhat a clever bot! A thought, no more, re \"false leads\": if there is no ToC, then b3=no. I suspect that this would work far more times than it wouldn't. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nWe could also try piggy backing on other project's assessments, IE if the bot sees its B-class for on and not the other it could reasonably infer that the article should be B-class across the board. I'm not sure how many articles or lists that would impact, but I know I've seen that in assessments on article talk pages before. Also, it may be a good idea to figure out a way to exclude articles that are subject to current events issues or ARBCOM rulings or such just to be sure a human double checks what the bot thinks and to avoid instances in which the bot may inadvertently create a backlash of sorts for us by mis-guessing or preliminarily tagging something that's making waves or subject to Wiki-oversight as it were. TomStar81 (Talk)\n\n@TomStar81: I get through a lot of B class assessments - last month I did over 1,000 for the drive - and in my experience the grading of other projects is a very poor guide to how we would assess an article. I would guess that about 70-75% of the time where another project had assessed an article as C or B class, I assessed it as being lower. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\n@Gog the Mild: No surprise there, MILHIST tends to be the flagship project for assessment standards and a lot of other projects have copied what we have because it works so well. That being said, if this is SOCOM as it were then yeah, inviting the mall cops into the fold would be a very bad idea for several reasons, not the least of which would be the degradation of quality :) That being said, it is a pleasant fiction to assume that all projects have at or near the same level of assessment standards for moments like this. TomStar81 (Talk)\n\nThis looks like an excellent development that could significantly reduce time spent reviewing articles. My concerns would be that, as a bot, it is blind to poor quality sourcing or copyright violations and that people could be put off if they've assessed an article as c-class, for example, and the bot downgrades it to a start-class. Provided the bot doesn't give out B-class assessments (ie. it just flags them for human review) and cannot downgrade classifications given by a human (it could flag these for review though), I am all for it - Dumelow (talk)\n\n@Dumelow: My understanding is that this will only apply to articles which have no B class checklist at all, not even a blank one. I don't think that there is any question of the bot ever overriding a human judgement. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nSorry, I didn't get my point across very well. There are articles in that category where a human has assessed the article as a C or B and edited the template mark-up accordingly but it doesn't show on the talk page because the checklist hasn't been completed. I could see people having an issue with the bot inserting \"class=start\" over the human-written \"class=c\" in the mark-up, even though the talk page currently shows it as start-class - Dumelow (talk)\n\nAh, understood. I was being a little slow there. Good point. Hopefully Hawkeye will set up the bot so that any such \"downgrades\" are flagged for human checking before they are actioned. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nThe banner template will only show C-Class if b1 or b2 and all the rest are ticked yes. If someone has put |class=C but not filled out the checklist, it hasn't been properly assessed. So, given the bot will only be adding the checklist to articles that don't already have one, or filling it in where the checklist is there but blank, I don't think this is an issue. Is that right, Hawkeye? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nIf someone puts |class=C (or, for that matter, B) but has not filled out the checklist, then it displays as a Start. I don't foresee a problem here; edits can cause the class assessment to change. It is very true that the Bot cannot assess articles as well as humans can, and can bee fooled; but we can't assess 25,000 articles, and it can. I will post a larger sample in a day or two; I have been looking at some corner cases. In all, though, the results have exceeded my expectations. Some things to consider:\n\nShould the Bot assess task forces as well?\n\nShould it change the assessment for other projects? Currently the Bot adjusts the assessment of some other projects (Australia, Aviations, Ships etc) when it promotes articles to A-class.\n\nIn what cases should a human be asked to verify an assessment? We don't want this to happen too often, as that would defeat the purpose of the exercise.\n\nHawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nI reckon the bot could do some work adding task forces, particularly if there are other WikiProject banners in place, or a particular type of infobox. For example, if it had WikiProject Australia, it could add the ANZSP task force, or add the weaponry task force if the WikiProject Knives banner was present. No doubt there are many more with all the national WikiProjects and some other specialist WikiProjects. In the case of infoboxes: if it had Infobox aircraft begin, it could be added to the Aviation task force; if it had Infobox weapon it could be added to the weaponry task force; or if it had Infobox ship begin it could be added to the Maritime task force. Infobox military person would result in adding the Biography task force.\n\nI think we should only change the assessment for projects we have an agreement with, which is only Ships as far as I know? We should run it past any projects we are thinking of assessing via bot.\n\nI think all B-Class assessments by bot should be checked by a human eyeball. I suspect that this will be manageable, as the vast majority of the 25,000 will be Start and a drive would smash it pretty quickly.\n\nPeacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nHere is a run with 100 articles. Assessments are rarely downgraded; the usual direction is up. Note that none were actually changed. Just showing what the Bot would do. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nA couple of initial comments. A few more Bs than I was expecting, I'll have a look at them individually and see how accurate the bot is. Maybe someone else could do that as well, to get another opinion? Two syntax-related things. 1. Could the bot remove the importance field from the banner where it exists, as we don't do importance? 2. Could the bot place the checklist immediately after the class field? An observation that the bot seems to get a bit confused where the existing banner has the checklist with the comments, and adds a second checklist. I'll post more once I've looked at the Bs. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI'm not a coordinator, but I've been watching this discussion with interest, as I have some concerns about the ability of a bot to accurately assess articles (though I also have concerns about humans to do it too, so go figure!) Taking five of these that were bot-assessed as C-class, I have some worries about how it assesses b1 (Referencing and citations):\n\nAbram Trigg: I can't see any justification for a b1=yes here. There is one inline reference in the whole article, leaving one complete section and another paragraph without one at all.\n\nAlexander Foote: There are six inline references in this article, but again whole paragraphs without, and an actual {{which}} tag, and yet the bot says b1=yes.\n\n2019 Balakot airstrike: Conversely, this one appears pretty solidly referenced, but the bot doesn't think so?\n\nAction of 17 November 1865: No complaints, this seems reasonable.\n\nAleda E. Lutz: Again, not complaints for this one.\n\nMaybe I just struck it unlucky, but three out of five with quite obvious problems suggests to me that the bot needs further calibration for judging against b1? Harrias talk\n\nInteresting, Harrias. I have had a look at five B-Class ones and three of five seemed fine, but two were definitely off. One (2018 Japan–South Korea radar lock-on dispute) had multiple tags (POV and Third-party), which should be taken into account by the bot. Generally, if the article has been tagged with issues then it is probably no higher than Start, IMHO. Could this be integrated into the bot? The other (2018 Tunisian protests) had an outdated tag as well as an uncited sentence at the end of a para, so shouldn't have been b1=y, and the tag indicates problems, so Start is probably where I would have landed on it. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nAdding (re: Harrias' comments) that 2019 Balakot airstrike has an uncited sentence at the end of a para, so C seems good, although it is awfully close to B assuming the sources are reliable. Action of 17 November 1865 also has an uncited sentence at the end of a para, so it should be b1=n and therefore Start, not C. Same for Aleda E. Lutz. I agree that the bot needs some tweaking re: b1. I am also wondering how it is assessing b4, Hawkeye7, as there are some glaring grammar issues in a couple I have looked at? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nHaving glanced at a few, I also agree that the bot's handling of b1 could do with a tweak; there are a lot of overtly false positives. So far as I can see, its treatment of b3 seems a little crude, so long as there is a single section header of some sort in there it awards b3=y. Can I repeat my earlier suggestion that if there is no ToC the bot defaults to b3=n. (Or even b3=?) That said, I remain impressed; if the false b1=y issue could be resolved, I think that we would have an assessment tool probably superior to the average assessment in the recent drive. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nSome comments:\n\nThe Bot cannot see the table of contents; it is automatically generated if an article has at least four headings. It can assess this, because it can count the headers. However, I often write B-class articles with fewer than four headings, eg. Allen F. Donovan.\n\nThe Bot was not confused by comments in the checklist, but by the old, alternative form; I will correct this.\n\nThe Bot is able to remove the importance tag. I had it doing this, but disabled it while I verified whether the Aviation and Ships projects have such tags (the don't).\n\nThe Bot cannot spot grammatical errors, however glaring (but if you have some that it might look for, I can consider them.) It uses a rule of thumb to guess.\n\nI've never paid attention to {{which}} as it places articles into Category:Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases, and does not refer to referencing (b1); although perhaps it should be coverage and accuiracy (b2)?\n\nThe same goes for POV and neutrality; they are not part of our B-class assessment.\n\nBy default, the Bot places the assessment parameters where the human put them, failing which it adds them to the end. But I can have it place them immediately after the class parameter.\n\nB1 definitely needs some more tweaking, although this is showing promise, with the Bot sometimes spotting ones missed the humans.\n\nMore work required. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nAnother run, with some tweaks for b1 and other changes:\n\nThanks Hawkeye. I disagree regarding tags like POV not being part of our B-Class assessment. Neutrality is a core content policy, so is included in all assessments. A POV tag is an indication that there is something wrong with b1 and/or b2, ie it may not be suitably referenced and cited (despite having citations for all paras), and may not reasonably cover the topic (because it is skewed to one POV). Likewise, the grammar tag should result in b4=n. I'll take a look at a sample of the above in a bit. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nOK, I only looked at the putative Bs, but they all seemed ok. Interested in other editors views. We probably should engage with Ships and Aviation about this now if we are planning to re-assess against their checklists. I am happy to do that if other are in agreement. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nYes, we should do that. It is no problem for me to switch it on or off. Changes in the latest version include:\n\nThe class parameter is now placed first in the temnplate, followed by the assessment parameters.\n\nImportance parameters are removed\n\nThe B1 assessment has been improved.\n\nHawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nThe bot isn't very accurate on B4. For example, A. W. Bhombal was checked as B4=yes even though it is written in poor quality English. Kges1901 (talk)\n\nThe Bot cannot read, and has no easy way of evaluating B4. At the moment, if the article looks good enough, the Bot will give it a pass on B4. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nI don't think it is feasible to exclude b4 from the bot's work, as it would be self-defeating in terms of the human workload. Do we just accept that it isn't going to be very good at assessing grammar and run human eyeballs over all the bot-assessed Bs in order to mitigate any significant downside? Personally I'm not too concerned if we have a few Cs that should be Start, but I think we need human quality assurance on Bs.\n\nB4 is one of the easier criteria IMO as it only requires competency in the English language, so having a category to check bot assesses Bs would work. Kges1901 (talk)\n\nHaving done a lot of B class assessments, I have found extremely few that fail the broadly drawn b4 criterion. The bot will pick up a good proportion of these, so the number of false-positive b4s, even from 23,000 assessments, should be small. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI saw the bot reassess an article on my watchlist as B-class, but German corvette Hiddensee pretty clearly is not - don't know what if anything to do about it, but I figured I'd at least point out a problematic assessment. Parsecboy (talk)\n\nThere is no pretense that the Bot can do the job as you can. The article was fully referenced, so it passed b1. b2 is rather more interesting. The Bot compared it with similar B-class articles and assessed it as being similar. The detailed infobox probably made it think that the article was pretty comprehensive. Feel free to change any assessments you feel are problematic. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nWe need a system for reviewing B-Class bot assessments, I've also seen several that clearly aren't right. I'm not fussed about lower-class assessments, but the Bs need to be flagged for a human eyeball to check. Could they be put into a category? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nYes, that can be done. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nHi. I wonder if Peacemaker67's suggestion for a centralised discussion venue regarding the bot assessments has been started somewhere yet? I have some feedback, but am not sure where it should be directed. --Paul_012 (talk)\n\nBot run complete\n\nIt looks like the bot run has now completed, the backlog has reduced to zero. I've updated the graphs above so you can see the dramatic effect the bot had on the backlog and our number of B-class articles in a short amount of time, good stuff. Further to previous discussions and Paul_012's comment above is there now a list of new B-class articles that need a human to look over and confirm? - Dumelow (talk)\n\nG'day Hawkeye7, what is the cat for the Milhistbot B-Class article assessments? Thanks, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI did not create a category, because I did not want to replace one maintenance category with another, but I intend to run off a report. I will post it as soon as I can. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nOkay, the Bot run is now complete. In all, 23,971 articles were processed. Of these, 1,828 (7.6%) were classed as B class. A list of them can be found [here]. Enjoy. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nFWIW, the MilHistBot likes the following articles which it graded B:\n\nAnatolie Popa\n\nAnushtakin al-Dizbari\n\nArikara scouts\n\nArthur Foss\n\nBanu Kalb\n\nBattle of Renfrew\n\nCostache Aristia\n\nDestruction of Albanian heritage in Kosovo\n\nGodred Crovan\n\nNorwich Castle\n\nOtto Ohlendorf\n\nPorcupine (Cheyenne)\n\nRadu Rosetti\n\nRoman dictator\n\nSS Yorktown (1894)\n\nSheng Shicai\n\nSpiro Crne\n\nSüddeutsche Monatshefte\n\nHawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nGreat to see this massive progress. But the bot is still in active duty when should the bot update the list with new Bs? Daily, weekly, monthly or randomly? Cheers. CPA-5 (talk)\n\nThe run has been cut back to once per day. Currently, it processes zero to three new articles each day. At rate of 1.5 articles per day, that comes to about 45 per month. Based on 7.6% of them being graded B, we can expect 3 or 4 B-class articles per month. I think I will have it do a monthly run, and update a page. What do you think of the eighteen articles above? I think the Bot found some diamonds among the rubbish. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nAm working on these. Cheers. CPA-5 (talk)\n\n@WP:MILHIST coordinators: In approximately six weeks we will open the nominations for the Military historian and Newcomer of the Year Awards. Not withstanding opposition to the term \"historian\" we still have a problem with these nominations in that the nominations are disproportionately tilted towards our content contributors at the expense of others who do tagging and assessing, photography and FP related work, news related work, coordination, etc. To that end I wanted to reach out and see if it would be possible to get people thinking about this ahead of the nomination period so we could make an honest attempt at diversifying the field this year. I know MilHistBot tallies reviews, surely we can find a veteran and a newcomer versed in article reviewing from that list, but the other areas would need manual nominations and the best people to do that would be those who contribute to the project. If we could encourage people to start thinking about it now perhaps the field and the nominees would widen a little this year, which would be good for us and the project. What you think? TomStar81 (Talk)\n\nA good reminder, Tom. I think, in terms of gnoming, those that made significant inroads during the recent drive might be nominated? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nYep. We need buglers, too: Op-Ed writers and such. I suppose we can look at those who have helped with featured pictures, free souring, etc. Wherever we can find them. If the coordinators can collectively find at least one editors in each field for nomination it should help show that this is for everyone including content contributors, not just exclusively content contributors. TomStar81 (Talk)\n\nAs a suggestion, it might be a good idea to introduce an award for military history wiki gnome of the year (preferably with a better name - 'grunt of the year' perhaps?) to recognise editors who focus on these sorts of contributions. Tom makes an excellent point by observing that they're often under-recognised across Wikipedia despite the importance of their contributions. There's a risk of over-complicating the awards though, but this would probably be a worthwhile experiment. Nick-D (talk)\n\nI was thinking along the same lines. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\n\"Grunt of the Year\"! :-) 'Military History Project Logistician of the Year' perhaps? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nSounds good. I was thinking of \"Quite 'Nuff Sayer\" (for contribution to the Bugle), \"Keeper of the Flame\" (for tagging and assessing), \"Photographer Maximus\" (for images), and \"Defender of the Realm\" (for taking on ArbCom). Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nPerhaps \"Walled Gardener\" for the latter? :) Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI've been toying with this idea for while now but I wanted to float it here first: I have in my head it would be a good idea to create a coordinator-specific academy page to track certain site wide rulings and issues that impact the project just so those who end up coordinators can look through them and familiarize themselves with the relevant information. This theoretical page would list ARBCOM, Editing Restriction and LTA editors in a non linked capacity along with a simple summary of the findings to allow coordinators to get a quick feel for what is expected by ruling in the relevant editing zone. Any thoughts on the matter? TomStar81 (Talk)\n\nHi Tom, I for one think this would be useful. My overview of bigger WP issues outside of MILHIST is pretty limited so having some sort of academy page will be helpful. Cheers, Zawed (talk)\n\n@Zawed: I've started the page, its at Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Academy/Site-wide rulings that effect the Military history WikiProject. Its a work in progress but I wanted to get some feedback before I move forward on both the use of the tables and the notes. Is it easy enough to understand whats being conveyed? If not I'll think this over and restart in another manner. TomStar81 (Talk)\n\nSirs:\n\nViewing the above cited Wikipedia page I find it largely erroneous and have begun drafting entirely new text for it. I would be interested in being connected with one of your Military History Coordinators (American Civil War) with a view toward rebuilding this article entire. My credentials are readily available on the Amazon author's page for Timothy J. Reese. I am the acknowledged expert on the subject in both tactical and strategic context. However, I am unfamiliar with and disinclined to learn Wikipedia control procedures.\n\nI should add that my research/publications also impact Wiki articles on the Lost Order, Battle of South Mountain, Battle of Antietam, Maryland Campaign, and perhaps others.\n\nYour assistance in this regard would be welcome.\n\nTim ReeseRhys1862 (talk) email: artofwars@Centurylink.net\n\nHi all, my score on the contest is wrong. It includes the 31 points from October, but not my 42 points from September. I haven't checked if this is the case for others. Harrias talk\n\nQuite right, not sure how I missed your entry into the contest the month earlier. I'm pretty sure I've got the rest right, but I'm always open to repechages if anyone reckons they've been ripped off. Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nThanks, easily done, no harm. Harrias talk\n\nACRs for closure\n\nThe instructions state \"Please wait 24 hours after a review is listed here before closing it to allow time for last-minute reviews.\" This never seems to be observed. It would be helpful if it were either removed or coordinators were reminded of its existence.\n\nIt is an old instruction, from the days well before I joined the project (2011). In the early days of the project, ACRs could be pretty cursory, nothing like today. One look at the ACR for Cold War gives you an indication of what was required way back when. In those days, two pretty cursory supports seem to have been acceptable. I suggest we dispense with it, and instead remind coords to check the review page carefully to ensure there are no outstanding points and the image and source reviews have been addressed. To me, the key here is the outcome, not an arbitrary process. If a nom has three supports, and image and source reviews, it is GTG. It is pretty rare for a fourth reviewer to drop in, as we each only have limited time and a fourth reviewer would be better off looking at a different nom in most cases. Probably one in thirty or more reviews gets a fourth reviewer, and there is the law of diminishing returns at play here as well. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI have boldly had a go at this. It turned out not to be simple, so I would appreciate a check. I resisted the temptation to over-complicate things and detail what to do with fails or a lack of consensus, and these rarely happen. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nNeed project tag fixed\n\nArticles which show here, those from Category:Military history articles needing attention to tagging (remind me, how do I link to a category?), are almost always those which have had an A class tag (\"A-Class=current\") added to the project banner at the top of the article's talk page following the ACR instructions (\"this should be added immediately after the class= or list= field\"). If one moves \"A-Class=current\" to immediately before the class-field the article no longer shows up as needing \"fixing\". (I have no idea why.) As here: .\n\nCould the instructions could be altered accordingly? And/or the script altered to accept either/any location of \"A-Class=current\"?\n\nMy thanks to Harrias for prompting me on this.\n\nThis has always been an issue. I thought it was because the |A-Class=current field wasn't immediately behind the |class= field, which is why I added that to the instructions some years ago. But really we want the |A-Class=current field to work (and not be placed into Category:Military history articles needing attention to tagging) regardless of where it is placed in the banner. This goes back to the time of Kirill Lokshin I think. Kirill, is this something about the banner syntax that could be easily tweaked? Thanks, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nPeacemaker67, Gog the Mild, the position of the field actually has nothing to do with it. The banner is looking for the review subpage (e.g. Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment/Battle of Sourton Down) and adding the attention needed category if an A-Class review has been flagged (i.e. A-Class is set to any of current, pass, or fail) but the subpage doesn't exist (or vice versa); this is used to catch cases where an article is moved but the review subpage isn't, or where a review link is inadvertently removed, and so forth.\n\nWhen a new A-Class review is started, saving the edit to the article's talk page before saving the edit creating the review subpage will immediately flag an error, because the subpage does not yet exist when the check is run. Unfortunately, once the subpage is created, the template will not \"re-check\" it until the next time the talk page is saved. This can be done by actually editing the talk page (such as to move the parameter around, as you've done), or simply by opening the page in edit mode and saving it without making any changes (i.e. a \"null edit\"); either of those will clear the error regardless of where the tag is located in the banner code. Kirill Lokshin (talk)\n\nThanks Kirill. We can amend the instructions to try and persuade nominators to get the order right, and correcting those that get past will certainly be easier with null edits. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nThanks Kirill. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nG'day Gog, if you would like to make a change to the instructions page to reflect this far better explanation of how it works, I'll be happy to check it. Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me) 09:59, 14 November 2019 (UC)\n\nWas that a trick request? There is, of course, no way to make an edit to the talk page to \"save\" the review page before the review page has been opened - for which you need to have \"A-Class=current\" in the banner. I tried to set up a work-around. See what you think. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nG'day, I believe there is a way. I preview the edit on the article talk page before saving, which allows me to click the \"currently undergoing\" link to create that page before saving the talk page. Regards, AustralianRupert (talk)\n\nAssessment grades for other projects\n\nIf I assess an article as meeting all or some of the B class criteria and alter the MilHist banner accordingly, should I also update any other project banners to match. I seem to remember seeing guidance that I should, and also that I shouldn't, but can't find either at the moment. (Which suggests that instructions one way or the other should be more prominently posted.)\n\nA follow up query: if I assess an article as, say, start class for MilHist, but another project's banner already has it as, say, C class, should I alter their grade? (This may or may not be the same query as the first one.)\n\nThanks. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nAs far as I know, the only WikiProject we have a definite agreement with is Ships. For them, our B-Class assessment can be copied to theirs (and vice versa). I have heard mention of historical agreements with Aviation and Biography, but I haven't ever actually seen anything to confirm it, some of the older hands may know though. Frankly, I am a member of Yugoslavia, and I just copy our assessment to their banner and I have rarely had any pushback. So many WikiProjects (other than ours) are moribund, but I wouldn't downgrade another project's assessment without at least mentioning it to them, as they may have different criteria. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nUntil recently I routinely changed other project's tags - but only if it was an upgrade. I must have altered (well) over a couple of thousand tags for other projects' banners (for a lot of different projects), and no one has raised a peep. I stopped when the drive started, realising that I was probably exceeding my remit, but the informal system seems to be that we can freely upgrade other projects' grades, but not downgrade them. Can I suggest that we contact all other projects, telling them that we intend to formalise that and see if we get any kick back? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nIn theory, being able to upgrade other projects assessments is a good idea, but from a practical sense (all groups being tribal), no doubt there will be some projects that will baulk at giving another project a say over their internal processes. There are a lot of projects out there, and few are anywhere near as active as Milhist. But I'm open to it. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nFWIW, I would be very cautious with sending out any messaging that might be interpreted as us claiming some sort of special position/authority/etc. in the project ecosystem. Kirill Lokshin (talk)\n\nThanks Kirill, I agree it isn't a good look. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI expected something like that to happen - the voice of sensibleness - when I posted my option. Kirill is probably right. At least I now know why I struggled to find definitive guidance. Personally I shall revert to upgrading other projects' banners as I come across them; and report here if anyone ever complains. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI think that would be best. We already have a reputation of being too big for our boots etc... Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nUs? Never!\n\nSo are we going to continue to fudge in terms of \"official\" guidance on \"How to assess\", and say nothing either way? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI think that would be best. Personally I'll assess articles that also fall under other projects for all projects if I'm familiar with their criteria as some of those have slightly different criteria. But that's me as an individual, not as a member of MilHist.--Sturmvogel 66 (talk)\n\nFair enough. That makes sense. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nScope of the National Militaries task force\n\nI am a little confused here - I confuse easily. Under Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/National militaries task force#Scope it states \"This task force includes the core articles which cover currently operational national armed forces (e.g. the United States Armed Forces) and their individual service branches (e.g. the Russian Navy)\"; which seems clear enough. But under the task force's Article Statistics formations down to regiment and brigade level are included.\n\nSo are there, a lot of, articles incorrectly tagged as within the scope of this task force? Or should we tweak the wording of its scope to make it clear that all currently operational formations and units should be included? Or something in between?\n\nI ask because I have just tagged a dozen currently operational Italian regiments, and this led me to check the wording.\n\nThanks. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nMy reading of it has always been that any article that relates to a current military ship, base, unit, formation, squadron etc goes in this taskforce.\n\nThat has been my understanding, in spite of rather than because of the wording. Would it be appropriate for me to tweak the wording of the scope to clarify this? I rather like the wording of the anonymous contributor above. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nEarly Modern/Napoleonic task force overlap\n\nFor my clarification:\n\nEarly Modern scope: \"roughly corresponds to the period from c. 1500 to c. 1800.\"\n\nNapoleonic: \"corresponding to the period from c. 1792 to c. 1815.\"\n\nSo, for example, all of the many warships which served during 1792-1800 should be tagged for both - yes? Or should the Early Modern scope be tweaked to end 'c. 1791'? I don't care which, but I do like clarity.\n\nThanks again. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nMy reading is that Early Modern can be anything in that time period, but Napoleonic only relates to articles that touch on the Napoleonic Wars. So in the example you give, if a Korean warship served in 1780–1795 but had nothing to do with the Napoleonic Wars it would only be in Early Modern, but if it was a British warship that saw service 1792–1800 including service in the Napoleonic Wars then it would go in that one too. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nAgree with PM, was thinking the same. Cheers. CPA-5 (talk)\n\nThat makes sense. A follow up question: Would a Korean warship which served during 1805-1810 be tagged as Napoleonic? What about a US warship? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI don't think they should be included unless they actually saw combat against Napoleon or the Coalitions. But in general, we don't have a scope about c. 1800 to c. 1945 either. Those ships should have only their regional and maritime scopes. Cheers. CPA-5 (talk)\n\nYes, I agree. Barring the unlikely scenario it did get involved in the Napoleonic Wars, the Korean warship would only be tagged for the Korean and Maritime warfare task forces. Zawed (talk)\n\nI note that this article was nominated for both a GAN and an ACR, 15 minutes apart. Is that permissible? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nThere's nothing forbidding it that I know of, and the two processes are run by different groups; it is odd, as A-Class reviews are usually done after the GAN is passed, but certainly permissible. Presumably done to cut down on the time of sequential nominations, I think it likely that the article will pass both, so I have no objection to it. Iazyges Consermonor Opus meum\n\nIt isn't verboten, but seems a bit silly tbh. They have different focii, because A-Class is mainly about content, and GAN is mostly about style. In my view it is better to go through GAN first, get the style stuff sorted, than do them at the same time and have ACR reviewers picking up on things the GAN is also picking up on. Which would just irritate me if I was reviewing. Once the GAN is done, then put it through ACR. Personally, I wouldn't look at reviewing a ACR on an article that hadn't passed GAN first, but maybe that's just me. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nJust a comment here but it is also requested at Wikipedia:WikiProject Guild of Copy Editors/Requests. Cheers.

Parsecboy (talk)\n\nAfter the big cleanup last month, the Bot has continued to patrol for unassessed articles on a daily basis. My proposal is that it report back here with the ones rated B class. So far the following have been assessed as B class this month (which I realise is not over yet):\n\nBattle of Gayaza Hills: Y An over-long lead, but otherwise GANable IMO. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nBenjamin Herndon\n\nPerth Road drill hall, Birnam: A single, four short sentence paragraph? Some would stub it, but IMO B2=n. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nWilliam Sterling King\n\n2019 Israeli airstrikes in Iraq: The referencing does not IMO meet WP:MILMOS#SOURCES. So C class. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nBurmese–Siamese War (1584–1593): Sadly most of the cites are not in the bibliography, so cannot be verified. So B1=n, but the bot cannot be expected to have seen that. C class. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nA monthly run can report back here. The above is expected to be a good indicator of the volume. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nGood idea. Let me know if you would prefer them to be commented on in some way other than how I have. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nThere's a Good Article nomination on the Battle of Fredericksburg that has been waiting for review since June. It's well outside my area of expertise, but if there's someone who is knowledgeable about the American Rebellion and could pick it up, that would be great. It is discouraging to the editors when articles are left unreviewed for months on end. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nHa. I had been thinking the same, but having only an outline knowledge of the conflict and only general books on it didn't want to embarrass myself by taking it on. Thanks for flagging it up, Hawkeye. I have just taken on three meaty SE Asia GANs, so would rather pass in favour of Hawkeye's generous offer. Unless, as they say, there is someone more at home with the American Civil War available. If pushed, I will do it: I do know my sunken lane from the carry/seize confusion. Or am I thinking of Antietam?

Someone's military record says \"major, November 25, 1862, to rank November 1, 1862, vice Gardiner, resigned;....\" I believe this means the soldier was promoted to major November 25, 1862, retroactive to November 1, 1862, and replaced (Major) Gardiner who resigned. Do I understand this correctly? I'm looking at William P. Bacon of the 5th NY Cavalry here.\n\nYou got that right. The \"retroactive\" part is his date of rank; so he´d be senior to a Major promoted on, and ranking from, November 2. ...GELongstreet (talk)\n\nI have done the requisite, if someone would care to check.

Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nSounds good to me. What do we need to do? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nG'day Gog. All we need to do is create a drive page, similar to March Madness 2017 or Backlog Banzai, and tweak it to include the checking of the Milhistbot B-Class assessments (with a suitable number of points per assessment check to make it attractive), let the other coords know so they can check it, then advertise it in the Bugle followed by a mass message a few days before it starts (I can do the mass message). Do you want to have a crack at it? I'm happy to check it for you. Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nOK. I have started. Give me a day or two. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI have the draft Drive page up, here, and the draft worklists page here. I would be grateful if someone could check them. I need to add that points can be gained for checking bot-classified B classes from Hawkeye's sandbox and then deleting them. I was thinking of 3 points for each of those. Comments? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nWe seem to be accumulating something of a backlog of ACR reviews; so I would also like to add them, at 25 points each. Thoughts? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nGreat stuff, Gog. I think the Milhistbot B-Class reviews should be more than a standard B-Class review in order to encourage reduction of the list. Say 8 points? I agree about A-Class reviews, but given they are often narrower than a GA review, I reckon they should be 8 points as well. Thoughts? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nBut there are virtually no \"ordinary\" articles left which require assessing. People will have to turn to the bot-assessed ones. And skimming one of these, deciding that the bot was correct, and deleting it, is, IMO, a lot easier than reviewing a random article from scratch.\n\nIf writing a full ACR review only gains the same points as deleting a bot-assessed article I don't see that providing much incentive to change behaviour, which I understood was the objective. I can see the argument for it scoring fewer points than a GAN assessment, but wouldn't want it to go below 15; I would suggest 20. Frankly, I would rather have every ACR assessed and that board cleared, than the bot-assessed list, which has been with us for decades and will shrink anyway over time.\n\nI will write up my ideas on the draft page and you, or anyone else, can come back at me. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nOK, I could live with 15 for an ACR. @WP:MILHIST coordinators: could other coords chime in about how many points we should award for these categories of work, checking Milhistbot assessments and ACRs? Thanks, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI have added both categories: ACR reviews at 15 points; checking the bot's B classes at 5 points. I have also boldly increased the points for a GAN assessment to 15. All very draft; thoughts, suggestions, corrections and edits welcome. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nSpeaking about reviews, why shan't we add peer review, FAC and FL reviews too? Also another thing just curious to the people who are here awhile. I saw in the Wikipedia:Good articles's drive last year, they have a rule that short GAN reviews wouldn't be count. Because some people wouldn't have a look at minor issues which are important in GANs. My question here is should we apply this rule too? And I'm wondering, why don't we add DYKs too? Because I think with all the new GAs (and the old ones who haven't a DYK) could immediately become DYKs which would rise the DYK Statistics? Cheers. CPA-5 (talk)\n\n@WP:MILHIST coordinators: If there is no further input over the next day or so, eg:\n\nSuggested further additions\n\nObjecting to any of the current content of the draft\n\nSupporting any, or all, of CPA-5's suggestions above\n\nthen I will be inclined to post the March Madness page as it is, get it into the Bugle before it goes to press and advertise it on the talk page. So, \"speak now ...\" Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI'm happy with it \"as is\". Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nDone. Any thoughts re GOCE's offer below. Surely we must have 50 articles which could do with an expert copy edit? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nThanks for all your work on this, Gog! I'm always keen for a bit of collaboration, but it is hard to identify articles of different classes beyond our usual rating of b4 which basically means Stub or Start. Why don't we target b4=n via a focus on a particular taskforce? For example, Category:Indian military history articles needing attention to grammar has 95 articles at present. I'm sure we could come up with a score for a copyedit that results in b4=y via a re-assessment at MHAR? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nReidgreg, does that make sense to you? Does it sound agreeable to you?\n\nAck, sorry! I either missed the ping or was just watching the sub-section below. That sounds like a good way to get a variety of quality assessments, and most of our editors should be up to B-class copy edits. Above B-class, it might be better to have a contributing editor send them to our requests page (WP:GOCER, maximum two requests per editor). – Reidgreg (talk)\n\nAnything else we need to do before the Madness gets under weigh? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nHow about a reminder of the imminent beginning on the project talk (since the original postings about it have been archived)? More participants wouldn´t be wrong. Wasn´t there to be a mass message sent to the project members? Also, a message on the talk of WikiProject History might draw some cross-project interest. ...GELongstreet (talk)\n\nCollaboration with GOCE\n\nA few months ago there was some discussion (#March Madness 2020 above) about a joint drive between MILHIST and the Guild of Copy Editors. It may be too late for that, but I think the GOCE would be receptive to having a MILHIST-theme to our regular March copy editing drive, if a list of articles requiring copy edit can be provided. Maybe 50–100 articles (or more) of various assessment qualities would be great. Let me know. – Reidgreg (talk)\n\nHello MILHIST coordinators from the Guild of Copyeditors' lead coordinator! The GOCE is planning to work on a list of about 65 Indian MILHIST articles next week. Our week-long Blitz page is live. There is discussion here if you would like to keep an eye on what we are doing. – Jonesey95 (talk)\n\nThanks Jonesey95, we will keep an eye on it. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nOur event coincides with this one. Would it be possible to introduce a points incentive for de-stubbing articles in March Madness? I was intending on improving some of the articles in Category:Stub-Class British military history articles - Dumelow (talk)\n\nHi everyone. I am the new coordinator for WikiProject History. we need people there!! right now the project seems to be semi-inactive. I am going to various WikiProjects whose topics overlap with ours, to request volunteers.\n\nIf you have any experience at all with standard WikiProject processes such as quality assessment, article help, asking questions, feel free to come by and get involved.\n\nand if you have NO Experience, but just want to come by and get involved, feel free to do so!!!\n\nFor anyone who wants to get involved, please come by and add your name at our talk page, at our talk page section: WikiProject History needs you!!!!\n\nAlternately, if you have any interest at all, feel free to reply right here, on this talk page. please ping me when you do so, by typing {{ping|sm8900}} in your reply.\n\nwe welcome your input. thanks!! --Sm8900 (talk)\n\nAs discussed on the project talk page, this A class article, promoted in 2008, has a lot of missing cites; and very few of those it has are from sources more recent than 400. That's the year 400. I propose a speedy demotion to C class. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI agree. It's a bad look for the project to have an article like this be seen as A-Class with our current standards. We should be looking at the older A-Class articles across the board on a regular basis to make sure they are up to scratch. Zawed (talk)\n\nUnless there is an objection(s), I will list the article at the A-Class review page for a reassessment tomorrow. Zawed (talk)\n\nSeems like someone has already downgraded the assessment rating, so doesn't look like we need to do anything further. Zawed (talk)\n\n@Zawed, Gog the Mild, and Peacemaker67: G'day, I don't have a say in the matter, but can I please encourage you to follow the precedent that previously required a formal re-appraisal for A-class articles. For instance, please see archives such as:\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment/2019/Demoted\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment/2016/Demoted\n\nThe guidance for this is at WP:MHR, which outlines the re-appraisal process; if you are changing consensus, then I think the co-ord body will need to put this to the project as a whole and then update the instructions at WP:MHR once a consensus for the change has been established. I'm sorry if this sounds overly bureaucratic. Regards, AustralianRupert (talk)\n\nAs it should be possible to save many A-class articles which no-longer meet the criteria, running demotion proposals through a review process is a good idea IMO, and not bureaucratic at all. Nick-D (talk)\n\nIt should go through a proper A-Class reassessment process. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nYou're right, it should go through a formal review. I've added it to the A-Class assessment page. Cheers, Zawed (talk)\n\nThanks, we have indeed had some success with improving former A-class articles through this process. For instance, please see Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment/2016/Kept. Regards, AustralianRupert (talk)\n\nReassessments\n\nI found some FAs and As which miss one or more citations.

Most of them are more than 10 years or almost 10 years old. Can we make a list of articles who we think don't meet the FA or A criteria? CPA-5 (talk)\n\nIn some cases, these are just cases of an editor adding uncited material. They are otherwise of FA/A standard. For example, I reviewed Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque at GA and ACR (both in 2014), and doubt it will take much to pare back the uncited additions by reverting to a previous version (or citing the uncited material). As the ACR nominator, I am sure Hawkeye7 can make those changes very quickly, and starting a re-assessment would be a huge over-reaction to a few minor issues. I haven't taken a look at the rest, but it would be worth pinging the editors that nominated them at FA or ACR as a start point, assuming of course that they are still editing... Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nG'day, I had a look at a few of these. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any of the necessary citations. I have tagged the spots I thought they were required, though, and where possible pinged a few editors who I thought might be able to help. At least this way, the issue is flagged on the article so someone may be able to assist. I didn't look at all of the articles, though. Probably best to only use re-assessment as a last resort, IMO, as some (if not most) of these probably are salvageable. Regards, AustralianRupert (talk)\n\nSounds legit, was just curious how we can fix this problem. Because these were just a couple of examples and yes maybe it's not so big deal to start a re-assessment. However, by the criteria, it's important to follow the rules, and I know there are a lot of those articles who have this kind of problem and most of them are almost or are over 10 years old is there a way to at least fix this problem with that old articles? Maybe our almost and over 10 years old articles need an update? Cheers.

I suggest you take a look at Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Academy/Writing a good stub, which is a good start point for a new article. Once you've done that, and have created the article, I suggest you post it at WP:MHAR and ask for feedback.

Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nThe article on the dinosaur Argentinosaurus has turned up on our open tasks page. I assume this is an error. If so what can we do to remove it? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI have manually removed it by editing Template:WPMILHIST Announcements. Kges1901 (talk)\n\nManually editing the announcements page is pointless, as the Bot will just put it back again. I have corrected the error. See User talk:MilHistBot#Odd inclusion on the MILHIST Announcements template Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nDid I miss something? Why are we allowing promotions based on two supports due to age? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nThe instructions for closing A-Class reviews were changed back in November 2019 as a result of this discussion. Looks like it may have been a slight misunderstanding of what was actually intended by the comment that two supports were sufficient back in the day. TBH, I can't say I noticed the change and still routinely check for three supports plus image/source reviews before closing off a review. I feel for the review system to be robust, we should still require three supports. Zawed (talk)\n\nI can't see consensus for the use of two supports, and agree that we should still require three supports. Can @WP:MILHIST coordinators: please chime in here? Thanks, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nWhile I know it can be frustrating to wait for a third review (especially in the slow period we had at the end of 2019), I agree with Zawed that three supports is preferable to make sure we're putting out good content. Parsecboy (talk)\n\nWhen I \"tidied up\" in November, I attempted to clarify what (I thought) was already there. I was surprised to find the \"only two supports needed after a month\" rule, and have never seen it implemented. It would seem best to formalise current practice - three supports needed, no matter how long it takes.\n\nWhile we are here, on Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment/A-Class review, in \"A-Class review/reappraisal closure instructions for coordinators\" it states \"Closure takes place after minimum of five and maximum of twenty-eight days\". I assume that this needs changing to the current practice of leaving A class nominations open indefinitely? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI guess so, but I'm not happy about it. Fourteen of the seventeen articles at ACR have been there longer than 28 days, and three of them have been there longer than 84 days. Two of those three would be eligible for closure under the two supports rule. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nA lack of three reviews can mean a lot of things, from the fact that the article is completely ticketyboo to reluctance to review due to the extent of issues with it. I don't think allowing articles to be promoted with two supports just because they were nominated a long time ago is a good practice in an environment where we are looking to at least maintain A-class standards, if not improve them. One reason for some articles to be waiting at ACR for a while is that some editors nominate three or sometimes more at the same time, and I personally won't review a third one until one of the others has been promoted. I'm sure I'm not alone. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI'm indifferent to how long an article has been awaiting promotion; I'm not willing to compromise on three supports. The last thing we should be doing is promoting articles that aren't fully up to snuff.--Sturmvogel 66 (talk)\n\nTo me it doesn't matter an ARC needs two, three or four supports to be promoted. I believe there is a possibility to promote an ARC with only two supports. Most people try to make their content to FA which makes it easier to have a third and even a fourth reviewer to prepare it to a FAC. We all agree that in some periods like the end and the summers of the year we have fewer reviewers than normally, a two-supports policy could help to reduce and keep them on track. But that means they could have less great content than with a three-supports policy. What does matter creating great content and it takes a little bit longer or keeping on track but they have less great content? To me the first one is the importance of them and some will agree with me. Now we all agree, the last supporter can take much longer than normal or in general no one is interested in reviewing a kind of specific type of nominations. I personally would stick with the three-supports policy because at FACs some of them need even at least four supports and if we reduce our supports than they would take longer to promote in FAC and they also struggle with finding reviewers. Cheers. CPA-5 (talk)\n\nI think the consensus is that we stick with three supports. I'll adjust the instructions accordingly.

My ACR Battle of the Aegates has been up for six weeks and has only attracted one support and a source review. I am aware that others have been waiting much longer, so I am not complaining. I am also extremely grateful to the two editors who have gone through it with a fine tooth comb: their efforts have, IMO, made it FAC-worthy. Which brings me to the point. There is a potential FAC slot open for it, so I would like to withdraw it from ACR. Would I be correct in assuming that all I need to do is delete \"current\" after A-Class=, or would that break the system? Thanks. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nG'day, Gog, you probably need to change it to \"A-Class=fail\", which will trigger the bot to close it. Regards, AustralianRupert (talk)\n\nCorrect. However, there is no need to do so. WP:FAC: An article should not be on Featured article candidates and Peer review or Good article nominations at the same time. There is no rule against having it at A-class. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nIs there not? I hadn't realised that. Well, I am supposed to say that I value ACR for the way it polishes my nominations, which I do; and which this article has benefited greatly from. But I also like accumulating actual A class passes, which is rather childish of me. So I am going to leave it in the pot for a while and see what happens; I feel that I am contributing enough quid for my quo. Thank you Hawkeye. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI have closed the ACR after receiving advice from Ian Rose. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nReading books on WWII history I keep coming across code names. These may represent military operations or people, or perhaps other things too. It seems to me it could be useful to have a list of them with a brief explanation of each and a link to appropriate Wikipedia articles if there is one. Code names can be at many levels and we could attempt to collect at all levels. For example\n\nOVERLORD, the invasion of Normandy by Allied forces during World War II\n\nJACQUELINE, SOE agent in occupied France\n\nSASSAFRAS, operation to infiltrate SOE agent JACQUELINE (q.v.) into France\n\nIf this is a good idea I could contribute entries but am not suitably qualified to set the thing up. The list if successful would grow quite big, so some means would be needed to split it, perhaps by initial letter. Within that entries would be alphabetical. I think that the list should not be split by topic or importance/level as that would inevitably involve arbitrary decisions. It would be also be useful to have some standardisation of format. One question on standardisation would be the extent to which links should be given in the brief explanation. I would suggest their omission (as in my examples) unless the code name itself has no link.\n\nNo doubt there are also code names from other than WWII; also Axis code names. If these are to be collected a separate articles could be used. Exbrum (talk)\n\nHi Exbrum, you are possibly thinking of something like List of World War II military operations or List of military operations? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nWe also have Category:Code names Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nThanks. It is interesting that when I searched for \"code names\" I did not find any of these pages, perhaps because they focus on \"operations\". I was thinking of something more comprehensive, not just a list of the well known operations. So it would include in addition exercises, for example FABIUS, a large scale rehearsal for the Normandy landings, plans, for example COLLECT, deception plan in the lead up to Operation Crusader, and people, for example JACQUELINE, as already mentioned. I can see a problem over the inclusion of non-Allied entries: the list may become unmanageable.\n\nAlso I am not sure that splitting the list by geographical area adds much value to the user as the boundaries may be crossed. When does France become Mediterranean? A similar comment applies to other subdivisions, for example the separate listing of SOE operations. If you don't know in advance that SASSAFRAS was for the benefit of an SOE operation you probably won't look on the SOE page; and in any case it involved an RAF flight to Gibraltar, so does that make it RAF or SOE? Then a boat trip to southern France, so is it Atlantic or Mediterranean? Users are likely to search by name, not area or military unit. They may not even know if the code name represents an operation, an exercise, a plan or a person; and it may be difficult to differentiate between these anyway. A split between Allied and Axis might be manageable to the user.\n\nIs there anything in this? It is just that I am reading a book at the moment, The Deceivers by Thaddeus Holt and it is a treasure trove of code names. Exbrum (talk)\n\nP.S. I should perhaps have added that I would not see the existence of an article on the code name (or even a mention of the code name in an article) being a prerequisite for inclusion on the list. COLLECT is an example of this, as it is not mentioned in the CRUSADER article. A by-product of their inclusion might be that they will stimulate someone to write a new article (or edit an existing one which failed to mention it).\n\nP.P.S. Why don't we use all capitals for code names, a common practice in books as it makes it clear that the word is not being used in its normal sense (e.g. SASSAFRAS the military operation not Sassafras the tree). Exbrum (talk)\n\nOriginally we did use small caps for codenames. The decision was taken to replace them with title case, as was done elsewhere that small caps were used. The discussions can be found in Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Archive 74#A small capital idea., Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Archive 147#Query on the use of small caps and Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history/Archive 122#Small caps for codenames.

I was checking Catlemur's claim for points for Vanuatu Labor Corps's promotion to GA. They created the article in 2018, nominated it in 2020 having made no edits to it since, made a few tweaks during the GAN process, and added a single sentence subsequent to it. In other words, they haven't \"made a meaningful change to an aspect of the article that leads directly to an increase in its assessment rating\" during April (IMO).\n\nHaving done something similar myself in the past I can entirely understand how this happens. It seems to me that Catlemur deserves the points, but the letter of the rules seems to say that they are not entitled to them. Comments, refutation or advice would be welcome.Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nThis can happen when an article is already above B-Class at the time of its creation, which I would argue this article was. I think in the spirit of acknowledging the editor most responsible for its current quality, Catlemur should get credit. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nIndeed, taking an article through a review process successfully is clearly a contribution to the improvement of an article as the nom needs to nominate it for GA and be prepared to address the reviewer's comments, even if often there are cases when the reviewer does not have substantial comments. Otherwise, many GA reviews where the nominator did not have significant issues with the article wouldn't count for the contest, and that is not what has been determined in the past. Kges1901 (talk)\n\nFine. Thanks. As I indicated, that is also my view. I shall approve the claim. Given my, um, cough, troubled history in claiming points for the competition I was reluctant to make a unilateral decision. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nAll done I think.

It appears that there is some disagreement on his birth place. The given source says Manchester, Virginia, but DANFS says Manchester, England. If you can find a reliable source that clearly states one way or another, that would make finding the correct location much easier. As far as authorship goes, there is not one 'author' of an article, but the primary author of content is BusterD. Cheers Eddie891 Talk Work\n\nI have posted on this user's talk page and started a thread on the subject's talk page about this material before I made any substantive changes. I appreciate DANFS pointed out to me; I clearly did see this when I started off (DANFS being pretty much the only reliable source on the page when I arrived) but forgot the birth place located in that source. I'll discuss this more fully on the subject talk page. BusterD (talk)\n\nI would be grateful if someone could make a ruling and/or give some guidance on my A class nomination of First Punic War. It has four supports, but one oppose. (It also has an image review and a source review.) Thanks. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI'm not a co-ord but just to make you aware of some good news, we've met or almost met the 1,250 featured article target (at the time of writing Category:FA-Class military history articles has 1,248 articles, the table at Wikipedia:WikiProject_Military_history/Assessment#Statistics shows 1,250). We should give some consideration to the next target. The last time this happened (when we passed 1,000 in October 2017) the consensus was that we'd move up in 250 article steps, so 1,500? The good news is that we estimated last time it would take 5 years to reach the new target and we've done it in 19 months. It's been a long time since I sent anything to FAC, but many congratulations to all those who have worked hard to do so! - Dumelow (talk)\n\nShould that be 31 months? Impressive anyway. Averaging eight FACs a month! Could we leave the target as \"met\" for a month or two before resetting, so we get the chance to bask in the satisfaction of a job well done? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nYep, thought we were still in 2019 for a moment there! No objections to leaving the target as achieved for a bit. Also worth a Bugle write up and possibly a mention in the Signpost? - Dumelow (talk)\n\nDumelow, good idea, well volunteered. Let me know if you would like some eyes on your draft. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nDo we know what the 1,250th article was? We should highlight it. There was some discussion at FAC about how this project has a high proportion of featured articles. It seems that this is a result of the high priority we accord to the review process, something that was in place before I arrived. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nIf there are currently exactly 1,250 MilHist FAs, the most recent of them to be promoted was French battleship Bouvet, nominated by Parsecboy. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI'm not sure that we're there yet. The category says \"approximately 1,248\" but the table I linked above says 1,250. I'm not sure where the discrepancy comes from. I've also just noticed Yongtai Fortress is in tha FA category but is definitely not one - Dumelow (talk)\n\nGroan. Yongtai Fortress seems to have acquired an FA star during its last edit on 10 March. Is there some way of checking the other 1,249 without doing it by hand? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nTo further complicate matters the Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Showcase/FA lists only 1,211. As an example Andrew Jackson is in the category but not on the showcase - Dumelow (talk)\n\nI can get the MilHistBot to check them. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nHere's the ones the Bot couldn't find in the Showcase. Some may have been renamed; others may have been classified MilHist after they were promoted.\n\n1678 Kediri campaign\n\nÆthelwulf, King of Wessex\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nAntiochus X Eusebes\n\nAntiochus XII Dionysus\n\nBalfour Declaration\n\nBattle of Groix\n\nBattle of Warsaw (1705)\n\nBorodino-class battlecruiser\n\nBuckton Castle\n\nCapon Chapel\n\nCleopatra\n\nCrécy campaign\n\nDeath of Cleopatra\n\nDroxford railway station\n\nFelice Beato\n\nFrank McNamara (RAAF officer)\n\nGevninge helmet fragment\n\nGreek battleship Salamis\n\nGuilden Morden boar\n\nGuy Burgess\n\nJohn Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk\n\nLancashire Fusiliers War Memorial\n\nLesley J.

Am I reading this right? Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nAll done. The showcase now has 1,248 articles listed, but the category only has 1,247. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nThanks Hawkeye, you are a dead-set legend. So, we are nearly there. I agree 1,500 is the next obvious target. This project is an FA-creating machine! Well done everyone. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI think I found the error. The Chevauchée of Edward III of 1346 was listed on the showcase under that name and also Crécy campaign to which it redirects. Hawkeye7 could you check I didn't break anything when I removed it from the showcase? I updated the count manually but don't know if I should have? - Dumelow (talk)\n\nThat's fine. All good. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\n1,248. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\n1,249 Gog the Mild (talk)\n\n1,250. Silesian Wars by Bryan Rutherford. A worthy representative of our collective 30 months of effort. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nWhoa! Well, if it is a suitable representative, that's because it was such a team effort! I continue to be deeply impressed by the organization, attitude and camaraderie of this project at every interaction; the only other branch of WP where I've seen anything like it is the Physics project. Would that we had this sort of dedicated and diligent crew working on our coverage of chemistry and maths! ;-_- Thank you, all of you coordinators, for your encouragement and guidance to me and other newbies making our first contributions to your area of expertise. -Bryan Rutherford (talk)\n\nJust to note that we've momentarily dropped back down to 1,249 after the 31 May delisting of Katyn Massacre, in case anyone was wondering why the stats are off - Dumelow (talk)\n\nSo two articles will get to be the 1,250th! Or possibly three, depending on what happens to Boshin War and its timing. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nRhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence was just delisted, so we are back to 1,248. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nAnd we are back to 1,250 with James P. Hagerstrom. Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nDue to the miscount, I'm not sure we are actually \"back\" to 1,250, I think Hagerstrom just is the 1,250th. I've increased the target to 1,500 and added a mention to the July Bugle.

The bot has trouble detecting the lede if there are other sections, usually various appendices, and if each paragraph has a cite. I can understand the first problem, but I'd expect that cites per paragraph should be easily detectable. The Koolhoven F.K.46 article doesn't have a single cite in the entire article.--Sturmvogel 66 (talk)\n\nThe lead is easily detected; the Bot's problem is detecting the last real section, especially if the author has included some creative naming. I think I can fix cases like Koolhoven F.K.46. Hawkeye7 (discuss)\n\nIs there a procedure for handling opposes at ACR? If so, could someone point me towards it? It would seem that any \"criteria-based objection\" is sufficient to prevent a promotion. Have I got that right? Gog the Mild (talk)\n\nI'm under the impression an oppose is not absolute barrier to promotion if there are sufficient supports, including image/source reviews. Perhaps it is a matter of prior to closing a review, pinging existing reviewers who have supported if a later reviewer opposes in case it has a bearing on their support vote? Zawed (talk)\n\nWhat Zawed said. I've had articles promoted with a single oppose. It is about consensus between the reviewers, so if the other reviewers are asked about their views on the rationale for the oppose and they disagree, that should be enough, assuming there are at least three supports. If they are split on the validity of the oppose, then perhaps another review should be sought. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI agree, if a reviewer oppose an ARC and an outsider disagrees with that reviewer then it shouldn't be a big problem to promote it. Unless there are a lot of bugs or reasonable comments to address i.e. problems with lead, major problems with infobox and/or body or like Zawed told us issues with images and/or sources. Sometimes an oppose just get ignored in the FAC prosses because it isn't reasonable to give an oppose.
