        "text": "Numerous anti-Chinese protests in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan over the mistreatment of Turkic ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, Chinese labor migration, and growing economic dependency of Central Asian countries on China demonstrate the looming anti-Chinese sentiments in the region. Although such sentiments are somewhat muted in other Central Asian countries, it is only a matter of time before the public in these countries start voicing their concerns. Obsessed with Chinese multi-billion dollar investments, regional autocracies have largely been reluctant in responding to Sinophobic pressure from below. Being authoritarian in nature, they are interested in maintaining the status quo by repressing the opposition. Fortunately for them, Sinophobia is not real; it is rather a public fear of the unknown represented by the Chinese failure to ‘advertise’ itself through soft power means. The author argues that Sinophobia can become real as the anti-Chinese protesters start politicizing their claims. Nationalist rhetoric would shift from a pure anti-Chinese agenda to that of demanding liberal political reforms. In some cases, the Kyrgyz and Kazakh governments have already expressed their willingness to contain the Chinese question. To prevent potential escalation of violence and political crises, Central Asian governments need to do more to ensure the public’s concerns are addressed. The People’s Republic of China should also revisit its public diplomacy strategies in the region with an aim to manage popular expectations and connect with local populations.\n\nThis third and final issue of Volume 4 of Contemporary Chinese Political Economy and Strategic Relations: An International Journal (2018) represents a collection of research articles covering some of the most pertinent aspects of the state of and changes in the political economy and strategic relations of today’s China. This present issue of Contemporary Chinese Political Economy and Strategic Relations: An International Journal, the third and final issue (December) of this year, thus significantly completes the 2018 volume beginning with the special issue of Vol. 4, No. 1 (April), Geopolitics of Belt and Road Initiative and China’s international strategic relations, and followed by Vol. 4, No. 2 (July/August)’s Focus – Dissent, political freedom, civil liberties and the struggle for democracy: Essays in honour of Liu Xiaobo, a commemorative issue published on the first anniversary of the passing of China’s emblematic prisoner of conscience, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo. The present issue, Vol. 4, No. 3, thus brings the 2018 volume to a close by revisiting some of the most critical areas of the state of and changes in the political economy and strategic relations of contemporary China which the journal has explored through the two issues of April and July/August, in particular the pertinent dimensions of State-society relations and domestic-foreign policy nexus that are again highlighted in several of the present journal issue’s articles, dimensions that have gained increased criticality and urgency under the Xi Jinping presidency that through its “China Dream” slogan have projected an assertive vision, as Amadea Bata-Balog brings to the fore of our attention here in her review of Elizabeth C. Economy’s book The third revolution: Xi Jinping and the new Chinese state (2018), that requires recalibrating the Chinese Communist Party-State’s relationship with the civil society as well as its relationship with the outside world. <http://icaps.nsysu.edu.tw/var/file/131/1131/img/2375/201172033.pdf> <https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0r37aw1nk87kfx/CCPS-V4N3-foreword-yeoh.pdf>\n\nThe article attempts to explore the nature and timing of China's new diplomatic engagement with the Central Asian region as a result of the two foreign ministers' meetings of China and Central Asian states that took place in 2020 and 2021. The objective of this study is to compare China's previous and current approaches to the Central Asian region. In doing so, this study attempts to contribute to the existing body of literature and shed light on the latest Sino-Central Asian diplomatic developments. The study heavily relies on the method of discourse analysis when interpreting the speeches of the foreign ministers of China and five Central Asian states at the foreign ministers' meetings. After having reviewed a large number of literature on the Sino-Central Asian engagement, this study finds that the current Chinese approach towards the Central Asian region has become substantially complex and multi-faceted. The article concludes that the launch of the foreign ministers' meeting platform and its further institutionalization is the gradual manifestation of China's \"striving for achievement\" strategy which seeks to reorient Beijing's focus from economic considerations to political ones."
