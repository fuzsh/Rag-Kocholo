        "text": "The boundaries of what has constituted “Eastern Indonesia” have shifted depending on the historical, cultural, political, or economic context. We review various ways that Eastern Indonesia has been understood, to overview the different ways of delineating and approaching this fascinating part of Indonesia in order to introduce this special issue. The intention of this special issue, however, is not to attempt to clearly define Eastern Indonesia once and for all, but to open up via these various historical and contemporary concerns with Eastern Indonesia, new ways of grappling with this region in the present Post-Suharto era. The current social and political transformations offer a great deal of opportunity to reflect on the way global and national flows of people, money, notions of governance and religious ideas, are so crucial to understanding and making sense of the current dynamics in the region. By focusing our attention on how these global and national influences intersect with the local, we want to bring out how they are appropriated and manipulated by local communities; at the same time they may undermine and transform what is taking place at the local level. Asian Journal of Social Science 39 (2011) 113–130\n\nIn this essay we propose an alternative approach to assessing the state of democracy in Indonesia. We focus not on institutional indicators (as is usually the case) but on manifestations of political discourses in the public sphere. In applying post-Marxist political theory through the work of Slavoj Žižek and Chantal Mouffe, we argue that democracy's main defining feature is that it allows antagonistic discourses about alternative policies to coexist, yet still manages to coalesce around a minimal consensus on how these discursive conflicts are to be dealt with in a fair way. Applying this approach to democracy analysis to Indonesia, we suggest that the major obstacles to democratic practice do not emerge from institutional problems, but from an overbearing political discourse that imposes broad consensus and harmony on most political issues. Political discourse in Indonesia is generally structured around \" Islam \" and \" the people. \" These themes provide a basis for a political consensus that conceals economic and social contradictions and reveals considerable depoliticization in Indonesian democratic practice.\n\nhis paper deals with the Indonesian typology of states, which are key challenges for Indonesia as a nation-state. In response to questions on how Indonesia’s political identity is underway, this article provides an explanation of how Indonesia experienced the transition from being a colonial to an independent state, the transition to peace after the dual revolutions of 1965 and 1998, the transition from centralized to decentralized sovereignty, and from being an authoritarian to a democratic state. This article develops a discursive study, which shows that there have been a number of challenges to Indonesia’s nation-state building. The most pressing concern is the emergence of ethnic and religious conflicts and the call for separatism as a result of the failure in domestic economic development and the decline in democratic governance."
