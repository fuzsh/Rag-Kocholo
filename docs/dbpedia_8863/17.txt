Set amidst the rugged beauty of the mountains in northern Spain, Oviedo, the capital of the Asturias region, is a charming and historic city that is overlooked by most travelers. The picturesque setting is as beautiful as they come, with the peaks of the Cantabrian Mountains to the south often dusted with snow, while closer to town an abundance of green space is a big departure from the dry Mediterranean coast that you picture when thinking of Spain.

The history here is palpable – Oviedo can trace its roots back to the 9th century, and was the capital of the Kingdom of Asturias, the last resistance against the Moors as they conquered the rest of Spain. But instead of being old and dusty, the city feels youthful and fun – a former industrial city that is now leaning into tourism and education, with a big university population contributing to a feisty nightlife and a cool restaurant and bar scene.

But mostly, Oviedo is just incredibly pretty. The city’s old town, despite having suffered during the Civil War, is one of the most beautiful in all of Spain. Add in the elegant boulevards of the new town, a proud and traditional dining scene, and a clutch of important pre-Romanesque monuments, and you’ll see why Oviedo is easy to love.

As a historic destination, Oviedo is hard to beat. Founded in the 9th century, this is Spain’s oldest Christian city, and it is a veritable wealth of Medieval buildings & squares in the famous old town. This part of Oviedo makes the effort to get here well worth it, thanks to its beautiful architecture, crooked lanes, and gorgeous plazas.

The pre-Romanesque churches in and around the city, listed as UNESCO sites, are also worthy of a visit. Oviedo is also a remarkably clean place – it has regularly been declared the cleanest city in Spain for several years running, and walking through the city streets is notably different to strolls through larger cities like Madrid or Barcelona.

Asturian culture is another big draw for visiting Oviedo. This mountainous region of Spain has long been overlooked by international tourists, but that is in big part to the landscapes. For a long time, the mountains made this place very hard to get to, only accessible via long and winding roads through the lofty mountains.

That isolation has led to Asturian culture developing its own unique traditions, from dress to music to dances. They also have their own language, and while not officially recognized by Spain like Catalan, Basque, or Galician, there are strong efforts to promote it locally.

All those mountains also make Oviedo a good base for hiking in the nearby hills or a stopover on your way to the Picos de Europa National Park nearby (or one of the many other Natural Parks). Oviedo is also the official starting point of the Camino Primitivo, the route of the first-ever pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela to visit the tomb of St. James, about 12 to 14 days-walk to the west.

Finally, the gastronomy of Oviedo – and Asturias at large – is also very different from the rest of Spain. Here, mountain cuisine is king, with taverns serving up hearty platters of meat, specialty stews like fabada asturiana, and an array of over 40 different cheeses that filter down to the city from the mountain pastures.

Apple orchards nearby also mean that Oviedo is an epicenter of cider – in fact, Asturias produces far more cider than the Basques, even though it’s the latter who are famed for it. In Oviedo, the old town is home to countless historic cider taverns where you can enjoy bottles of the stuff for a very cheap price.

How to get here

Oviedo is served by the Asturias Airport, which is about 29 miles (47 km) from the city and situated next to the city of Aviles on the coast. Buses make the journey from the airport to Oviedo, costing between €7 and €12 euros and taking about 45 minutes. Taxis are also an option, but the long distance means a high cost of over €120.

Train

Starting at the end of 2023, a new high-speed train connects Oviedo with Madrid. There are four departures a day from Madrid, which takes about 3 hours and 40 minutes to get to Oviedo. Tickets cost around €39 to €54.

Bus

Buses from the Spanish company Alsa also make the long journey from Madrid to Oviedo, with a travel time of around 5 hours and 30 minutes. There are frequent departures throughout the day from Madrid, about every 3 hours or so. Tickets cost approximately €40.

Where to buy train & bus tickets

As a general rule, I always recommend booking your transport tickets directly with the service provider. However, comparing options can be tedious and their websites aren’t always great.

Omio is an aggregator website/app that I really like. It shows options for public transport routes all over the world. When you do a search, you’ll be able to see all your options for trains, buses, flights, and even ferries along with a host of different companies that provide the services. It costs a little bit more than booking direct, but it’s easy to use and very convenient.

Renting a car

Renting a car doesn’t always make sense in Spain, but if you’re planning a road trip in the North, it definitely does. You don’t need a car to get to Oviedo, but if you want to visit the coast and gorgeous natural areas around it, then you’ll want one.

If your northern Spain road trip is not starting in Oviedo, know that you’ll find all the major international companies in Northern Spain as well as some smaller local ones which are often less expensive. Any medium-to-large city will have rental agencies, but for the best selection you’ll probably want to rent somewhere with an international airport or a busy train station.

If you plan to pick up the car in Oviedo, you’ll find most of your options at the bus station, which is essentially attached to the train station.

Where to find a car rental

To check prices and book, I recommend using DiscoverCars. It’s a car rental website includes offerings from all the major international rental companies as well as lots of smaller local agencies, which often have much better pricing. You can often find great deals.

How long to spend in Oviedo

To do Oviedo justice, you need only 2 days. ON your first day, you’ll be able to get your bearings around the stunning old town, sampling the local sweet treats, cheeses, specialty cuisine, and of course the cider that is overflowing from the local taverns. You’ll also have time to visit one of the excellent museums in the old town.

On day 2, you can spend your morning at the Campo de San Francisco and exploring the newer side of town before making your way up into the mountains north of town to visit the UNESCO-listed pre-Romanesque churches.

Where to stay

Eurostars Hotel de la Reconquista is surely the grandest hotel in town. Set within an 18th century hospice, the hotel has fused contemporary touches with its historic setting. Nightly rates range from $100 - 150 USD.

Hotel Soho Boutique puts you right next to the old town with nice rooms at a very attractive price. You can usually find a room for under $100 USD.

2. Venture into the Archaeological Museum of Asturias

For a dose of history and culture, head to the Archaeological Museum of Asturias. Housed in a 16th-century monastery, this museum offers a fascinating insight into the region's past. Exhibits span from prehistoric times to the Roman and Gothic periods.

3. Go hunting for sculptures

Oviedo is known for its impressive collection of public art, which can be found scattered throughout the city. Take a leisurely stroll and discover the many sculptures that grace the streets and squares. One notable sculpture in the Campo de San Francisco Park is the life-sized statue of Mafalda, a popular Argentine comic strip character.

This magnificent palace, designed in an English Tudor style with a striking octagonal tower, offers breathtaking panoramic views of the bay. While the palace itself remains private, you can still explore its meticulously maintained gardens. It's a perfect spot to relax, appreciate the scenery, and enjoy a picnic lunch.

4. Explore El Fontán Market

No visit to Oviedo is complete without experiencing the atmosphere of El Fontán Market. Located in the heart of the city, this bustling market is housed in an elegant 19th-century glass-and-iron structure.

Wander through the stalls filled with colorful displays of local produce, including cheese, cider, meat, fruits, and vegetables. Immerse yourself in the lively atmosphere as locals gather to shop, gossip, and enjoy a drink and tapas at the surrounding terraces.

How to spend 2 days in Oviedo

Day 1

In the morning, make a beeline straight for Oviedo’s old town, where you can spend a few hours wandering the streets and major squares. A must-see is the Oviedo Cathedral, where you should pop inside to admire the interior. Then, make your way across the old town to the Mercado El Fontán, a busy hub of stalls selling excellent local produce.

In the afternoon, the area surrounding the market is also one of the favorite places of locals to enjoy some tapas. Plaza del Fontán is a good spot for lunch – try Casa Ramón or Casa Amparo, both offering excellent fabada stews. Then, stop by the Church of San Isidoro el Real and the town hall in Plaza de la Constitucion, another central square in the old town. Afterward, take your pick between the city’s two premier museums: either the Asturian Museo de Bellas Artes or the Archeology Museum of Asturias.

Once you’re ready for dinner, a meal at one of the city’s famous cider houses is a must while in town. Head to El Bulevar de la Sidra (the Cider Boulevard) where people spill out onto the streets from the cider houses. Tierra Astur is a fantastic option, with huge platters of meat and grilled vegetables to enjoy alongside the sparkling and sweet cider.

Day 2

Ease into your second day in Oviedo with a morning stroll around the beautiful Campo de San Francisco, a leafy park in the middle of the city. There are statues inside, some monuments, and plenty of lawn space to sit down and enjoy the relaxing vibes. Then head into the newer part of the city center, with some nice shopping streets leading you to the Basilica de San Juan el Real, a stunningly ornate church.

This afternoon, make your way out to the northwest outskirts of the city, where the city turns into verdant hills and the slopes of Mount Naranco. On these slopes is where you’ll find several incredibly well-preserved pre-Romanesque churches. To walk here takes about 45 minutes, otherwise you can take a taxi. While access to the interiors of the churches requires a guide, the intricate facades and exterior details offer ample opportunity for exploration.

Back in town for the evening, it’s time to make your way to another of Oviedo’s famous restaurants. La Corte de Pelayo. One the most well-regarded restaurants in the city, it’s an ideal choice to try the Asturian cachopo.
