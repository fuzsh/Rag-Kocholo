        "text": "This slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIf you are looking to dip your toe into the Asturian property market without breaking the bank then this could well be the place for you. Instantly habitable whilst still having room for further improvement it offers a lot of potential and is located in a tranquil hamlet that is conveniently within easy striking distance of the main cities, coast and airport. Composed of a good-sized village house with attached barns and exterior patio this is a neat package at a very economical price. The property has had some work in recent years that has increased its attractiveness for any potential buyer. Work on the roof of the main house should ensure its watertightness for years to come.\n\nA new study / bedroom with mezzanine and private balcony is a recent addition and makes a cosy, nook in a private annex that is linked to the main house. In the photo of the front facade of the house this annex is the first floor of the adjoining building, with a lower, and obviously new, roof. To the rear you can see the balcony that overlooks the ground floor patio and out on to the heavily wooded hillsides opposite. Both the balcony and the patio are great sun traps. The ground floor beneath the annex is a barn / store room with entrance from the street.\n\nOff the patio is the ‘llagar’ – the typical cider making room but in this case with an added bonus and unique history. Back in the day this was actually the village sidrería, where the locals would gather to chat and down a cider or two at the end of the day. And hidden under its floor is the property’s own private well. A particularly important feature as the climate continues to warm worldwide.\n\nToday the llagar can make a great base for an outdoor kitchen as it has both running water and electricity. There is even an outside loo just off the patio (in need of prettying up but you have the plumbing in place which is the main thing!) The property has mains electricity, water and sewage with gas cooker (as well as original wood-burning range cooker) and gas water heater. For heat there is a wood-burning stove as well as an open fireplace and the kitchen range.\n\nTo the ground floor of the house, the kitchen is a decent size, big enough for a small table and plenty of storage. Across the hall from the kitchen is a cosy lounge. Under the stairs is further storage space. To the first floor there are two bedrooms in addition to the separate study/guest bedroom as well as a spacious bathroom complete with bath and tasteful modern suite. In short, everything you need to be able to embark on your very own Asturian adventure.\n\nDriving times: Oviedo: 35 minutes Gijon: 38 minutes Asturias airport: 50 minutes\n\nEl Entrego Shopping Centre: 10 minutes"
