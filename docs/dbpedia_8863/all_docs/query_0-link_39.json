        "text": "[EN] The ninth-century chroniclers working for the Asturian King Alfonso III clearly considered Alfonso I a pivotal figure of their eighth-century past. A detailed analysis of the role Alfonso I plays in those narratives, combined with other evidence shows that his figure was largely made up, either from scratch or by displacing onto him features that actually belonged to other, relatively obliterated figures. Alfonso I thus became a discourse node, both in the genealogical equipment of Alfonso III and in the wholesale revisión of the Asturian origins that he effected, and whose paramount aspect was the creation of a new historical identity based upon the strengthening of all sort of links with the distant Visigothic monarchy.\n\nThe Kingdom of León came into being when the Asturian dynasty selected the city of León, originally a Roman military encampment, as its new political capital and the site of the coronation of the reges Legionis. The borders of the kingdom changed over the centuries, due to conflicts with the Umayyad Caliphate (929–1031), the Taifa dominions (1031–1092), the Almoravid Empire (1062–1147), the Almohad Empire (1147–1269), and the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Portugal. The regnum Legionense existed as a self-sufficient sovereign entity from 910 to 1230. García I (r. 910–914), Ordoño II (r. 914– 924), and Fruela II (r. 924–925) were the first three monarchs to rule from the civitas of León and were the sons of Alfonso III (r. 866–910), the last sovereign to locate the seat of his power in Oviedo. This continuity meant that Asturian regal authority continued in Le n throughout the 10th century and into the first third of the 11th century. The rulers of the walled city claimed a connection with the long extinct and yearned- for kingdom of the Visigoths. Dynastic change came, however, after the rule of Bermudo III (r. 1028–1037), who perished in the Battle of Tamarón at the hands of his brother-in-law Fernando de Navarra (r. 1038–1065). After this struggle, the wife of Fernando and sister of Bermudo III, Sancha Alfónsez (1037–1067), became queen and the de facto last representative of the Asturian-Leonese line. Her children –Urraca of Zamora, Sancho II of Castile (r. 1065–1072), Elvira of Toro, Alfonso vi of León (r. 1065–1109), and García II of Galicia (r. 1066–1072)– as descendants of Fernando I, were sovereigns of the Navarrese dynasty (1038–1126). This line lasted until the death of Urraca (r. 1109–1126), who –with her husband, the princeps Raimundo of Burgundy (1070–1107)– produced a son and successor, Alfonso vii (r. 1126–1157), the first Leonese king of the Burgundian dynasty.\n\nThis article explores the relationship of the discourse of secrets and courtly politics during Alfonso X’s rule in Castile and León (1252–1284). This piece argues that Alfonso’s imperial aspirations may be the key to better understand the reasons encouraging the complilation of the Liber Razielis at the Alfonsine court. In this work, we can fnd three main elements that were useful to legitimize Alfonso’s project: the discourse of secrets and its relationship to the royal institution, the identifcation between the wise Solomon and Alfonso, and, fnally, the use of natural philosophy as a means to portray the fgure of the eagle as a defning element of the empire. Finally, this essay concludes that the fgure of the eagle and the strategic meaning of Solomon also appear in several later works of the Alfonsine corpus in similar political terms."
