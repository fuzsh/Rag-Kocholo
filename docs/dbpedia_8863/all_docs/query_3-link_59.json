        "text": "The opening of Inter Miami’s Miami Freedom Park stadium has been put back to the start of the 2026 Major League Soccer (MLS) season.\n\nGoal said the plan was to have the new stadium built by December 2025, which would coincide with the final stages of the MLS playoffs, but sources now say early 2026 is a more realistic estimate.\n\nClub Internacional de Fútbol Miami, known as Inter Miami CF or Inter Miami, is an American professional soccer club based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a suburb of Miami (US). Established in 2018, the club began playing in the Eastern Conference of MLS during the 2020 season.\n\nMiami Freedom Park is a 25,000-seat soccer-specific stadium currently under construction in Miami, Florida, United States. It is planned to be the home of the Inter Miami CF.\n\nConstruction began in August 2023 on the stadium and 131-acre mixed use project adjacent to Miami International Airport.\n\nPlans include a 58-acre public park, more than 1 million square feet of commercial retail, entertainment, and office and hotel space.\n\nThe development of Miami Freedom Park is being led by sports/real estate veteran Devon McCorkle.\n\nMiami Freedom Park will contribute more than $40 million in annual tax revenue to the City of Miami, Miami-Dade County, State of Florida and Miami-Dade County Public Schools, and will create 15,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\nInter Miami has been playing at a temporary facility in Fort Lauderdale since its inception in 2020.\n\nChase Stadium is a soccer-specific stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida (US). Built on the site of the now demolished 17,417-capacity Lockhart Stadium, the 21,000-seat stadium is the home pitch of the Inter Miami CF of Major League Soccer (MLS) and its MLS Next Pro reserve side Inter Miami CF II.\n\nClub CEO Jorge Mas said last summer, “With Inter Miami my family set out to build something truly transformational. In just four years we have changed the perception worldwide of American soccer. As we commence construction of Miami Freedom Park that same vision guides us.\n\n“In creating a multifaceted space, we will set a new standard of what sport complexes can be. We look forward to delivering a food and entertainment destination for families to enjoy year-round. I can’t wait to welcome our fans to our state-of-the-art stadium and hear the chants as Messi and your Inter Miami players take the pitch for the first time in 2025.”\n\nThe Herons have said in a message sent out to season card holders that the 2025 season is “is expected to be our FINAL season here at Chase Stadium before moving to the new stadium in Miami”.\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
