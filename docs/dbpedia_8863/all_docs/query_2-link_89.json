It was reduced to a Principality. Why did Leon take over from Asturias as the center of power? Why did Asturias never retained its former glory or gained an upper hand after the Kingdom was divided by Alfonso III for his three sons?\n\nThe kingdom of Asturias and the kingdom of Leon are the same thing. It was simply a matter of succession and preference. García inherited León while his brother inherited Galicia and her sister Asturias. Once García died Ordoño inherited all his land and her accepted him as a lord,while remaining queen of Asturias.\n\nIf you want to keep the capital in Oviedo just kill Fruela,eventhough the change of the capital to Leon made sense as there was a need to push further into the basin of El Duero to obtain more arable land to repopulate\n\n@Padilla I would like to correct you that Alfonso III had three sons. Fruela was the king. I wonder if Asturias can expand to the Meseta Central while it is separated by the Cantabria Mountains. I wonder if it is logistically sound to have Oviedo be the main city in the region if Asturias had territory in the Meseta Central. Why did you say that the Kingdom of Asturias and the Kingdom of Leon the same thing? The title of King of Asturias was abolished in 925.\n\n@Padilla I would like to correct you that Alfonso III had three sons. Fruela was the king.

The title of King of Asturias was abolished in 925.\n\nI always forget that Fruela is not a girl name.\n\nLeón and Asturias had the same institutions and was ruled by the same dinasty,the only difference was moving the capital to Leon. The same happened in the Leonese succession war or when Ferdinand inherited Leon in 1230(?).\n\nIt’s not wholly dissimilar from the breakup of Charlemagne’s Empire.\n\nIf you change which brother got what, or you change their order of death and inheritance, you could contrive a situation where Asturias remains both the de jure and the de facto centre of power in the Kingdom.\n\nNow the other thing is a question of whether Asturias proper is a good enough position to continue to use as a power base against the Muslims. Asturias has proven it is defensible, but I suspect León has a superior position to push further into Spain."
