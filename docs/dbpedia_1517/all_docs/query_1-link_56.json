        "text": "Synopsis\n\nWhile Arbie (Jason Yachanin) has to stay behind for his family, his girlfriend Wendy (Kate Graham) is bound for college. They’re reunited one college semester later, except it turns out Wendy is now dating Micki (Allyson Sereboff). The two of them are protesting against the American Chicken Bunker, a fast food restaurant built on an Indian graveyard. To get back at Wendy, Arbie decides to get a job at ACB and meets the manager Denny (Joshua Olatunde). Unbeknownst to the staff, the spirits of the chickens and Native Americans are seeking revenge against their oppressors. General Lee Roy (Robin L. Watkins) tries quelling the protestors, but Native American chicken zombies soon invade the restaurant. As our heroes scramble for survival, Arbie and Wendy manage to rekindle their romance and grow as people. But will they survive, or will they be the next meal for these flesh-eating fowl fiends?\n\nReview\n\nTroma is known for making wildly crazy movies, but Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead might be their craziest yet. Honestly, even just describing some of the insanity packed into this film would be doing it a disservice. While many films have at least one memorable moment, they pack tons of special moments into their runtime. Every scene stands out, from an overweight man coating a bathroom in diarrhea to a guy becoming a sandwich. There is an overabundance of bodily fluids everywhere in typical Troma fashion, including blood, shit, slime, and everything in between. Also, in the spirit of Troma, there’s some great social commentary about the fast-food industry and corporate greed. Admittedly, there’s some dated humor straight out of the mid-2000s, but those moments are few and far between. If nothing else, this movie will make you think twice about going out to order some fast food.\n\nThe cast all play their parts in an exaggerated way that’s funny and genuine without being obnoxious. Jason Yachanin is loveable as the dopey-eyed guy working to win his girl back while trying to survive this situation. Kate Graham has terrific chemistry with Jason, and she’s also sweet as the naive girl wanting to make a difference. Each ACB staff member stands out, including the flamboyant Paco Bell, the Islamic stereotype Hummus, and the hillbilly Carl Jr. Even though he’s pretty much the stereotypical corporate villain, Robin L. Watkins is charming as the enigmatic General. Plus, there are some appearances from Troma veterans Joe Fleishaker, Ron Jeremy, and Debbie Rochon. The film has musical numbers, and while some are better than others, they add to the film’s campy charm. Overall, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead may not be for everyone, but it’s a must for horror-comedy fans.\n\nOne final note: if you decide to watch this, consider also watching the documentary Poultry in Motion. It’s easily one of the best behind-the-scenes documentaries you’ll ever see, and it’s worth a watch all on its own."
