        "text": "That's right. You're reading a review of a film called Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead.\n\nDo you know the feeling of craving bad food, driving to a fast food joint, and taking the first bite of a processed, thrown together, and unhealthy burger? Everyone should know this feeling. It's one of the little joys in life. It feels good to indulge occasionally. These little trips make us feel more human and accept that our lives and our decisions are the product of eternally flawed minds.\n\nOh, is that too serious for a film with the aforementioned title?\n\nI remember the first time I saw this film very clearly. I put it on because I thought the title was ridiculous and I expected to turn it off in five minutes. (This was the first Troma film I watched, so I didn't know what I was in for) But after fifteen minutes of utter insanity went by, and I found myself grinning like an idiot. The level of genuine enjoyment here is very unexpected.\n\nWhat's the last film you saw that had some life to it? And this may be a little tricky to describe, but this is what I mean by life: There are some films where you can tell that everyone making it, from the director to the background extras, had a fun time working on this project. You can practically feel the buzz of energy coming from the screen. This isn't a group of workers complaining about their paychecks. This isn't a group pf producers waiting for their film to pass through layers of testing. These are people making a musical, romance, comedy, horror, and Sci-Fi film about a chicken restaurant built on an indian burial ground. It feels raw, insane, and fun.\n\nMaybe you can't get past the ridiculous gore and gross-out scenes. Maybe the extreme amounts of nudity turn you off. Maybe you think the film is downright offensive. It clearly isn't for everyone.\n\nBut remember, we like to eat that fast food burger. So which place should you go to?\n\nWendy is a good option and has some of the best moments, but has made some bad decisions.\n\nArby is nice and funny, but he doesn't do anything in the film.\n\nPaco Bell may have died first, but he does come back to save the day.\n\nCarl Jr is certainly a disgusting person, but maybe he's not too bad.\n\nThe Colonel from KFC may have been the villain, but he was just a baby.\n\nOr perhaps there is Hummus. I'm not sure if that's a restaurant chain. Maybe that's why she dies and then comes back later with no explanation.\n\nAdditionally, every single film that Troma has made can be watched for free on their youtube channel. Remember that when you're watching this film that nothing is meant to be taken seriously. Every stereotype is heightened so much that they almost loop back around into becoming characters. The musical numbers are ridiculous and catchy. And every stupid joke is played with such sincerity that you might crack a smile.\n\nIt's also the only movie I can think of where at one point the main character informs you exactly how much time is left before the end.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
