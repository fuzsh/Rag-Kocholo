        "text": "This weeks installment in Cheeseball Cinema comes from the king of B movies, Lloyd Kaufman and the Troma team. This week I bring a film that I have wanted to watch for a very long time since I saw what the film was called. This weeks film is called Poultrygeist: Night Of The Chicken Dead and I have to tell you that this is the cheesiest film of all time and that enters Lloyd Kaufman in the Cheesball Cinema Hall Of Fame. The movie is about a fast food chain that opens up on a cemetary, sort of like the Poltergeist films. You know, Indian burial ground equals a no no. This time it’s deadly chicken that are about to cause a hell storm for the workers and patrons of the chicken joint. The film stars Jason Yachanin (V/H/S) as Arbie, Kate Graham (Identity Thief) as Wendy, Allyson Sereboff (Queens Bound) as Micki, Robin L. Watkins (Pretty Dead Things) as General Lee Roy, Khalid Rivera (Broad City) as Jose Paco Bell, Lloyd Kaufman (The Toxic Avenger) as Mature Arbie, and Joe Fleishaker (Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.) as Jared. What I am about to tell you is absolutely ridiculous, so spoiler alert time. You’ve been warned!!!\n\nThe movie starts off with an immediate sex scene except it’s a dry hump scene. The line that I feel has described Troma films and their writers for years is when Wendy looks at Arbie and says, ” Gosh Arbie, your the best dry humper in School.” Arbie then tells Wendy, “That’s what the guys on the basketball team say.” It’s just absolute ridiculousness right from the get go. Then you see a bunch of arms rising out of the ground and they are feeling up Arbie and Wendy and one sticks it’s finger in Arbie’s you know what. Then they are scared off by a fat guy with an axe that is masturbating. The fat guy does get killed by the arms. We fast forward and the indian burial ground is gone and a fast food resturant is in it’s place. Arbie is strolling around, very curious about the protest that is going on in front of the chicken joint. One of the groups protesting is called CLAM (collegiate lesbians against Mega-conglomerations), very Troma like. Arbie notices that his girlfriend Wendy is now a lesbian and protesting. The musical number starts and he vows revenge by working at the chicken joint. One of the musical numbers features plenty of boob shots and lesbian action that would make any adolescent teen go nuts. The movie seems to be part horror/comedy part musical for most of it. some of the musical numbers are catchy and others are just tongue in cheek. When all of that is happening, you see a gay mexican get grinded up and turned into a sandwich that talks, a hick that tries to bang a chicken, but his pecker gets bit off. The real action begins with 39 minutes left in the film and that is when you see the chicken zombies and the humans that turn into chicken zombies. Arbie and the gang are struggling to figure out a way to kill off all of the Chicken zombies and Arbie just wants his girl back. I wont say anymore, but if you want to see this cheesfest, then by all means go ahead. The movie does feature what I thought was a brilliant performance by Lloyd Kaufman. On a scale of 1 being close to an A-list Hollywood Film and 5 being the cheesiest film of all time, I gives this movie a 4 1/2."
