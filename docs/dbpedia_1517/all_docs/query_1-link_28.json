its INSINCERE theyre just JOKING!\" (\"lloyd kaufman plays the president? yah THATS likely...\") back then we were diggin up old bavas & francos & giallos & gifs of adjani freaking out on the subway while spoiled manhattanite slobs & preppy band-class brats belting out karaoke'd smirks & slurs seemed closer to the barleyesque cool-cuz-its-rude vice mag>>>comedy central pipeline of the time (you can draw(ntogether) a map from lloyd to \"lady ballers\" unfortunately) so on rewatch i dunno what changed me or the culture(=total bland consensus limiting homogeny/prudity of even \"transgressive horror\" nevermind regular movies) which of course this itself digs into (\"was i protesting corporations because im unhappy with myself?\") if you can look past shame & vicarious embarrassment youll see lloyd poking & pricking his own oppositional/countercultural slant & upper-middlebrow soho affectations as maybe the ultimate troma(ville) dispatch or at least the last one that needed to be made, then & now; a batin' switch more self-directed to the nature of authenticity & subversion than all-out offensive attack on main$tream amerikkka's hypocrisies & foibles as advertised, tho god i miss casual cruelty & hostility towards uncontroversial pop/mass-culture even if it gives me that carsick feeling of being weirdly moved by something \"fun\" but not funny, like watching the hugs at the end of snl. this is at least 60% funny (\"my soccer leg!!!\") the songs work (\"faking im gay / like dick cheneys daughter\" just one of the petty lines libs used to be effortlessly capable of but now only emerge on tourettesy fbook groups posting \"disgusting melania\" content) and right when it starts to linger & drag (one more buttplug joke bro just one more) a lush, oozily-puked kitchen-massacre fx-piece of burnt goo & drain rot manages to really capture the sour, swamp-humid taste & smell of food service, a pubey ricotta fatberg smeared across yr face scabbed n dabbed in curds of chicken grease. its aged well, or maybe im aging unwell into a dementia patient dispensing warm nods to old rivals & foes oscillating a dozen cycles back to \"protesting is gay\" jokes (\"FUCK TIBET/FREE CHICKENS\" lmao) as the 2013 culture war recedes & mass audiences (re)discover troma filmschool grad eli roth recycling this movie's (spoiler) false-flag protest angle in green inferno & his own anti-colonial/similarly poultry-brained thanksgiving, following kaufman aging back into relevance for deconstructing the-personal-is political before it became a civic duty & obsession (\"whatd yall think decolonization looks like? vibes? essays? losers.\") in obama's 1st term lloyds barely satirical ensemble of hustler-mag cartoon caricatures (gay mexican, feminazi lez-til-grad, bereted black militant, ululating hijabi named \"hamas\") felt like an outdated & hacky spoof of 90s captain planet/bk kids club diversity til the obseqious, gumpian studios troma'd always opposed brought back dehumanizing taxonomies & essentialist hierarchies repackaged so thoroughly that genz movie dorks can only experience humanity thru the flattening lens of identity - an inevitable, maybe even corrective blowback to ugly gags like the shock jock/man-show burkha babe routine here, even tho lloyds cheap stereotype orgy feels like a pigtail-pulling on his own sincere admiration of the melting pot (genx troma fans never got this & became either weird racists or ashamed populists refitted to post \"maybe the real saltburn was the friends we made along the way\" while enforcing sectors of vacuously utopian 2020s pop culture that feel more like hateful pornographic kitsch than any goofy, egalitarian \"true but you shouldnt say it\" teasing from toxie)--hold up: how many lloyd kaufman movies are about a skinny virgin in a short skirt with a mop?? troma~ is~ wagie~ femboy~ canon~(\"this is not a terrorist thing, this is not a sodomy thing\") & lloyd (who, speaking of femboys, shows up saying the hard r in a skirt & thong) really is good at scouting grossout jokesters who happen to be talented broadway-level songwriters, just in case you missed his hourly reminder that he discovered the guys who did south park & went to yale.\n\nIn 1966, Lloyd went on a hiatus from his Yale University studies and spent a year in Chad for USAID as a pathfinder for the Peace Corps.\n\nKaufman's fellow Yale classmates included Oliver Stone and George W. Bush. He graduated in the class of 1968, where he majored in Chinese studies.\n\n\"the future of this country is branding and franchising and...theres no stopping it! so, i decided to follow the money\""
