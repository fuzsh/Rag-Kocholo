        "text": "Yep, that time of the year has once again arrived. The Melbourne International Film Festival (or MIFF for short) is back for another year to deliver some of the best and most acclaimed films from all over the world for 18 days. MIFF has always one of Australia’s most beloved film festival, so it’s always … Continue reading →\n\nI know, I know. This is starting to become quite a bad habit for me. Every year when I start to organise my top 10 lists, I always plan to release it either January or February at the latest compared to everyone else since I wanted to catch up on some films that I missed … Continue reading →\n\nIt’s that time once again, everyone! Oscar night is almost here. While this year’s race isn’t as unpredictable as it has been in previous years, I have to say that this year’s Best Picture line-up is definitely one of the strongest ones we’ve had in a while. If this was any other year, any of … Continue reading →\n\nHey, everyone! October is almost here, which means one of the best times of the year is once again upon us: the Halloween season. Just like all my fellow film fans out there, I’ll be spending the month celebrating the occassion by watching a lot of horror films every day. If have been following over … Continue reading →\n\nHey, everyone! Welcome to my second edition of my two part recap articles of the 2023 Melbourne International Film Festival (or MIFF for short). Just like that, the festival is done and dusted for the year. What did I think of MIFF 2023 overall? I have to say, I thought the quality this year was … Continue reading →\n\nThat’s right, everyone. It’s that time of the year once again. The Melbourne International Festival (or MIFF for short), one of this country’s biggest film festivals, is back for the delight of all Aussie film lovers. Especially me, as it is one of my favourite film related events that I attend every year. After making … Continue reading →\n\nYeah… I’m becoming a bit of record now when it comes to these lists. If you remember in my top 10 of 2021 list last year, and by extent, my top 10 list from 2020 as well, I was going to publish this year’s one much earlier than the previous years. Most likely around February … Continue reading →\n\nWell, everyone. It’s that time once again. The Oscars are upon us. What a wild ride this entire award season has been these past few months. After the complete utter insanity that was last year’s ceremony with the infamous “Slapgate” incident, I honestly don’t know what to expect from this year’s awards. Seriously, between this … Continue reading →\n\nWell, everyone. October is almost upon us and you know what means? One of the best times of the year has come back around once again: the Halloween season. After spending the past two Octobers at home due to lockdowns brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s nice to see that this year’s Halloween will … Continue reading →\n\nAfter three very long years away due to being cancelled and postpone because of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of Australia’s biggest and most prestigious film festivals the Melbourne International Festival (or MIFF for short), will be making its long-awaited return to the cinema for its screenings between August 4th-21st (along with an online program between … Continue reading →\n\nHey, everyone! Welcome to my 102nd edition of my Bad Movie Tweet-A-Thon series! As you already know back last month here on SuperMarcey.com, I said I was going to do a special Bad Films Of 2021 themed edition of the column in honour of all the awful films that were released throughout 2021. I posted … Continue reading →\n\nHey, everyone! After 7 month hiatus, Bad Movie Tweet-A-Thon is back with this 101th edition to collide the 9th anniversary of this column’s debut! Now you all are probably wondering why has it taken so long for me to write up a new edition? First up I want to apologise for the long delay of … Continue reading →\n\nWell, everyone. That time of year has arrived. The Oscars are about to be announced. I don’t know about anyone else but compared to last year’s ceremony that was held in April, it seems this year’s one has been feeling like it has been going on a lot longer than usual. Understandably given everything that … Continue reading →\n\nHey, everyone! Welcome to the 100th edition of my Bad Movie Tweet-A-Thon series. Yes, that’s right, everyone. We’ve arrived at number 100. What I milestone. When I first started doing this back in May 2013 with OOGIELOVES AND THE BIG BALLOON ADVENTURE (which you can read here), I never thought that I would make it … Continue reading →"
