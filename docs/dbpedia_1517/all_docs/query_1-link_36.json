As the title suggests, this episode is a hearty slaw of content, so let’s get right down to it!\n\nThis kicks off Tro-March! That’s right, an entire month of Slashers dedicated to Troma. But wait, I can hear the disappointment in your collective sighs through the ether of space and time. If five episodes and a Patreon bonus are not enough Troma content for you, rest assured, we’ve called in the cavalry; our friends from the podcast, Damn, That’s Scary!, are joining us in the fun. We are swapping short bits for each of our episodes all month long, so if you liked their take on Poultrygeist in this episode, please give them a listen. Similarly, if you found us through their show, please let us know at @slasherspod on virtually every platform ever.\n\nPoultrygeist was written by Daniel Bova, Gabriel Friedman, and Lloyd Kaufman. Many of you know that Uncle Lloyd has his finger in virtually every Troma project, as if he was the perpetual zombie finger for each film’s butthole, which, yes– occurs within the first five minutes of the film.\n\nWe talk the Troma film making process, their style, and their cinematic universe which includes The Toxic Avenger, Class of Nuke ‘Em High, and several others we will be featuring throughout the month.\n\nOf course we also discuss dem Southpark boys who show up in the credits, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, along with the late Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead.\n\nSome of you may know, but Doug actually has a feature film streaming on Troma Now, along with an episode of Mulligan’s Monsters. Please consider at the very least doing a trial subscription to follow along all month and support Doug (free, shameless plug).\n\nNext, we move on to our interview with Price James. Recently, he directed the documentary: You Can’t Kill David Arquette. That film is streaming on Hulu and it is incredible. We talk about towing the line between kayfabe, reality, and being a redemptive cinematic story.\n\nThe reason we absolutely had to have Price on was his Action Man: Battlefield Casualties short, available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KtyMcb86go&ab_channel=VFPUK\n\nIn the storied tradition of the raconteurs and troubadours before him, Price does an amazing job of highlighting truly terrifying issues, through a lens of comedy. We highly recommend checking out the short, which features Matt Berry of Toast of London and What We Do in the Shadows fame.\n\nIf you ever have feedback or recommendations on future episodes, please let us know at slasherspod@gmail.com. You can always find us on our social media: Instagram, Twitter, Slasher App: @slasherspod Facebook: /slasherspod Reddit: u/slasherspod https://www.youtube.com/c/slasherspodcast\n\nYou can find our merch, and links to all our online presence here: linktr.ee/slasherspod\n\nTheme song is I wanna Die by Mini Meltdowns. https://open.spotify.com/artist/5ZAk6lUDsaJj8EAhrhzZnh ; https://minimeltdowns.bandcamp.com/"
