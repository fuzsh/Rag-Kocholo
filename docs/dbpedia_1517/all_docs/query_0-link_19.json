        "text": "Cult-O-Meter: ★★★★\n\nRating: ★★★★\n\nHumor me in an imaginative experiment for just a sec. Mentally picture the documentary Supersize Me… then overlay The Evil Dead 2 on top of it… and while you’re at it, add a few musical numbers. My guess is that the resulting picture is a fuzzy, confused mess for most of us, but the fine folks at Troma Studios saw this idea’s potential and made it happen. The resulting film is Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, and I’m here to tell you that it’s pretty clucking awesome.\n\nPoultrygeist tells the story of the star-crossed lovers Arby and Wendy, two teenagers who swear on graduation night that their love will remain eternal and unchanging. Of course, talk is cheap. A semester at college turns Wendy into a conglomerate-hating lesbian vegan, and a heartbroken and bitter Arby decides to take a job at a nearby “Chicken Bunker” (a military-themed fast-food chain) just to spite her. Unfortunately for everyone involved, this particular Chicken Bunker was built on top of a Native American burial ground, and the pissed-off spirits of the Indians combine with those of the dead chickens to wreak bloody revenge on the restaurant. Employees, customers, and protestors alike are soon caught up in a nightmarish chicken-zombie-apocalypse that conclusively proves that calories aren’t the only scary thing about fast food.\n\nThis film, like everything else Troma has made over the past two decades, is politically-incorrect in the extreme and has spurting bodily fluids and fart humor as key components. Even so, I was honestly surprised by how intelligently the film handled its deep-fried subject matter. Poultrygeist deals with many aspects of the real-life ethical and health debates over fast food, mercilessly lampooning both greedy conservative capitalism and coffee-slurping liberal hypocrisy in the process. Apart from more suble satire, this film has a great, warped sense of humor that ranges from little pokes at the powers-that-be (naming characters after major fast-food chains) to deliciously absurd plot non-sequiters (one employee dies gruesomely in a meat chopper, only to return to life as an undead, gay, Hispanic, talking hamburger).\n\nThe musical numbers are one of the more unique aspects of the film and a completely new thing for this particular group of filmmakers. These are something of a mixed bag in terms of quality: “Revenge is a Dish Best Served Fried” and the Indian-Chicken Revenge Anthem at the film’s end were pretty ho-hum, but the duet between Arby and director Lloyd Kaufman was fun, and “Slow Fast-Food Love” was really great. The titular “Poultrygeist” song at the end credits is also a highlight.\n\nOf course, all of this musical and social-messagey stuff is fine, but where Poultrygeist proves it is a real golden egg is in the zombie massacre scenes. The special effects are pretty incredible for a relatively low-budget independent film like this. The deaths themselves tend to be pretty darn inventive, as when two chicken-zombies decide to “split a wishbone” using a restaurant patron’s legs! The makeup was also an obvious labor of love. Turning a crowd of low-paid extras into zombies is something any director can do with gray makeup and a few gallons of fake blood; transforming a crowd of unpaid extras into decomposing chicken-people is a feat few directors other than Lloyd Kaufman could pull off.\n\nOn the whole, Poultrygeist is “Grade-A” B-movie entertainment. Its only real weakness is that it frequently takes the juvenile gross-out humor and sexual shock value about a mile and a half beyond the bounds of good taste. Then again, this is par for the course for Troma; if you have seen other recent releases by them (such as Tromeo and Juliet, Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie), you already know exactly what you’re getting into.\n\nSo rent Poultrygeist, watch it, and go out for a salad—you’ll probably want to stick to veggies for a while after this one.\n\nAVAILABILITY:\n\nThree versions of this film are currently on the market: a 2-disc “Special Egg-Dition” DVD, a 3-disc “Egg-Sclusive Collector’s Edition” DVD, and a Blu Ray edition. The 2-disc version contains the movie, a feature-length “making of” documentary, Troma trailers, a music video, and multiple commentary tracks. The 3-disc contains all of this, plus a few additional extras (film-making lessons and deleted scenes) and a “kara-yolk-e” DVD for the warblers among us. The Blu Ray’s features are mostly identical to the 2-disc DVD, with a few of the additional extras from the 3-disc’er thrown in for good measure.\n\nIf you intend to purchase Poultrygeist, I’d encourage you to buy it from Troma directly to give this independent film studio the full profit without having to pay a middle man. Troma puts them on sale pretty often, and with all of the extras on offer, they’re an excellent bang for your buck, buck, buck… Below are the links to those items in their store, with an “Amazon” exception for the 3-disc DVD, since Troma no longer has it in stock themselves.\n\nPoultrygeist: 2-Disc “Special Egg-Dition” DVD\n\nPoultrygeist: 3-Disc “Egg-Sclusive Collector’s Edition” DVD\n\nPoultrygeist: Blu Ray Edition\n\nAh, and as a final plug, there is a soundtrack. You might see what you think.\n\nPoultrygeist OST"
