        "text": "The most stomach-churning scene in the new French horror film “Raw” isn’t the one where the young cannibal girl gnaws on her sister’s severed finger like it’s a KFC chicken wing. It’s not the scene where the girl’s afternoon snack is a bloody accident victim.\n\nWhat made me gag was a scene earlier in the film, in which the sweet-faced girl — a lifelong vegetarian, played with deranged glamour by Garance Marillier — is forced to swallow a rabbit kidney as part of a bizarre hazing ritual at the world’s unruliest veterinarian school.\n\nGross.\n\nI’ve been a vegetarian for almost 30 years. My light bulb moment was the day in high school when my loudmouthed friend Kim pointed out the bloody vein protruding from the chicken leg I was eating, and I almost threw up on her Trapper Keeper. I’ve also been a devoted fan of horror movies since I first popped “Slumber Party Massacre” into my VCR one night in 1985. So my heart races more than usual when I watch a movie that combines my aversion to meat with my affection for horror."
