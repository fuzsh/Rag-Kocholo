        "text": "Movie genres are consolidated in the history of films by Hollywood producers of the 1930s and 1940s for production planning needs. The division into well-coded movie genres allows studios above all to reach very specific target audiences. In addition, producers always try to connect well-known stars to each genre. The association between a certain gender and a certain face becomes an almost unconscious mechanism of the public. The production is organized in ramifications of genres, and each genre includes a constellation of subgenres, actors, directors and existential philosophies.\n\nMovie genres are inherited from literary genres, tried and tested over the centuries. Every major production house specializes only in certain genres, just as certain directors like Hitchcock, for example, will become a hallmark for Thriller. In fact, it is rare outside of arthouse cinema to see directors ranging in various genres: the large expense necessary for the making of a Hollywood film creates rather rigid paths and a limited possibility of experimentation. Everyone wants to go without fail to meet the public’s approval. Stars, spectacular settings and genres are the surest way to do this.

The actors are linked to the production companies with exclusive agreements and the collaborations between Star and Studio last a very long time. Once the audience identifies a star with a certain film genre and with a certain Studio, it is difficult to find different roles, and the actors remain trapped in the cliché that is built on them.\n\nFred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are part of the unreal and golden universe of the musical. Humphrey Bogart, James cagney of the dark world of crime and Noir. Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn of the comedy and John Wayne of the western. The films of each single star always reproduce the same moral messages and the same vision of the world, project after project, with a series of variations that become a kind of sub-genre. The star is forever linked to his type of characters and the audience’s expectation.\n\nIn some rare cases, however, the production decides to play on a kind of surprise effect, and to have a star interpret a character that the public is not used to. The appearance of the stars as their standard characters meet expectations and help create their myth. Characters and stars who are liked by certain segments of the public well divided because everyone is the bearer of a different message in which they reflect themselves.\n\nWhat Are the Film Genres?\n\nExploring the diverse realms of cinematic genres, we embark on a journey through the various forms of cinematic art, uncovering how each genre shapes our cinematic experience and reflects the intricacies of society and culture.\n\nDrama\n\nThe drama film genre is one of the broadest and most diverse genres in cinema, known for exploring a wide range of human emotions, conflicts, and complex situations.
