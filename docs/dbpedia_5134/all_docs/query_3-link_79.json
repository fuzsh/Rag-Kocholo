        "text": "So many docs, so little time. This sums up my deepest feelings about the documentary film genre that shows no signs of slowing down. Indeed, I believe this kind of movie will only grow in popularity in the years and decades ahead.\n\nIf there is one thing about the future that gives me comfort, it is the knowledge that documentary filmmakers are working hard to bring us important stories we would not know about otherwise.\n\nSome of these stories are ones most of us are quite familiar with, such as climate change. Others are downright esoteric, like the world of fungi or truffle hunters. And still others present people and places we think we know, only to find out how little we do.\n\nWhen Morgan Spurlock died last week, I recalled watching his performative documentary “Super Size Me” 20 years ago. Of course, someone who eats nothing but McDonald’s for 30 days straight is clearly a stuntman.\n\nAt the same time, obesity is a serious health issue for millions of people, including children. In fact, Spurlock’s inspiration for the documentary came from a lawsuit filed by two New York City parents who claimed their severely obese children were the fault of McDonald’s food. Given the success of “Super Size Me,” it didn’t take long for McDonald’s to discontinue its Super Size menu.\n\nOn the other hand, documentary films come in different flavors. There are some in which we never see the filmmaker, let alone hear his or her voice. Frederick Wiseman is famous for this style of cinema, and at 94 years old, he knows a thing or two about what works behind the camera. He is a national treasure in the truest sense, even if he now spends more time living in France!\n\nAnother type of documentary film is the kind Ken Burns makes and PBS frequently airs. These expository docs aim to inform and educate audiences directly. They typically involve voice-over narration, film clips, interviews, and infographics.\n\nA perfect example of this is one I watched last week called “Finding the Money,” directed by Maren Poitras. If you are not sure what Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is, you will come away with a much better understanding of MMT after watching this. Mostly about one American economist, Stephanie Kelton, “Finding the Money” also introduces audiences to ideas they probably would not encounter so vividly anywhere else.\n\nMy favorite kind of documentary film is the biographical variety. Not to be confused with the biopic genre, I thoroughly enjoy learning more about people I already admire or appreciate in some way. Although not officially recognized as a true documentary category, films like Berkshire International Film Festival’s special tribute event featuring a screening of “Merchant Ivory” give me indescribable joy.\n\nMerchant Ivory Trailer from Stephen Soucy on Vimeo.\n\n“Merchant Ivory” recounts the career-defining relationship between film director James Ivory and the late producer Ismail Merchant. Along with their writing partner, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the couple’s prolific moviemaking spanned six decades and 44 films that garnered 35 Oscar nominations. If you are 95 years old like James Ivory, you too are a national treasure of the highest and most lavish order!\n\nOf course, the Berkshire International Film Festival spotlights documentary film, which is why there are over two dozen docs for your consideration. Cool events like this Friday afternoon’s “Doyennes of Documentary,” a tea talk with Sheila Nevins and Barbara Kopple, sound lovely and should not be missed. Plus, directors of documentary films are laser focused on what they see. They are beacons of light and energy in a confusing and uncertain world.\n\nSo many docs, all of which deserve your time. Congratulations to BIFF on an incredible 18 years!"
