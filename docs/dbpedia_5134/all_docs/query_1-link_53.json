        "text": "How Movies Can Nurture 9 Crucial Habits that Boost Empathy and Help Kids Thrive\n\nFilms can stir our emotions, spark our curiosity, creating lasting memories, and become portals to other worlds. In some cases, a movie can whip our conscience, shift our perspective, or activate our feelings so we stand up and change the world for the better. The right movie can stir a child’s empathy better than any lesson or lecture ever could. The right movie matched with the right child can also be the gateway to opening his heart to humanity. And the right films can also be teaching tools to help kids learn the nine essential empathy capacities culled from science that I identified in UnSelfie: Why Empathetic Kids Succeed in Our All-About Me World.\n\nHere are over 100 wonderful movies that help teach those crucial nine empathy habits. Then refer to UnSelfie for over 300 follow-up activities to to give kids the Empathy Advantage.\n\nYou might also consider showing short You-Tube clip of the key scene from each film to depict the core moral message and empathy habit to discuss as a family.\n\nSymbols designate the recommended age and suitability for each film: P-Preschoolers; S- School-age; T–Tweens/Teens.\n\nDo view the film first to ensure suitability. Many of these movies are emotionally-charged so use your judgment.\n\nAlso check out websites such as Teach with Movies or Common Sense Media, which offer reviews and age-by-age child ratings of movies.\n\nEMPATHY HABIT 1 – Emotional Literacy: Recognizing, understanding, & communicating feelings\n\nWatching movies can be a fun way to help kids recognize emotions. Pick ones that depict different emotions and then identify characters’ emotions and how the child felt as the viewer.\n\nAlso, turn off the television sound for a few minutes and have kids try guessing together how the actors feel based on their body language or facial expressions. Nail biting can mean: “She’s tense!” A clenched jaw could signify “He’s scared!” Nodding and leaning in mean “She’s interested!”\n\nOther movies in this resource for emotions are: Shrek, Dumbo, Despicable Me, Finding Nemo, Frozen, Harry Potter. And then there’s also Bambi as a real tear-jerker. Name the emotions as a family.\n\nInside Out (Pixar, 2015). The best giving important messages about needing to feel-and express-all of your emotions, whether happy or sad, told from perspective of an 11-year-old. P, S\n\nEMPATHY HABIT 2 – Moral Identity: Adopting & exercising an ethical code\n\nWatch clips from Sully, then review Chesley Sullenberger’s childhood in UnSelfie (on pages 25-27) and how he formed a moral code.

T\n\nEMPATHY HABIT 4 – Moral Imagination: Using books, films or images to cultivate empathy\n\nAll films in this resource would help enhance the fourth empathy habit: Moral Imagination. Favorites such as The Shawshank Redemption, The Pursuit of Happyness, The Book Thief, or The King’s Speech can activate children’s hearts.\n\nMy favorite would be The Neverending Story, an epic story within a story about a lonely boy and a strange book that draws him into the beautiful but doomed world of Fantastica.
