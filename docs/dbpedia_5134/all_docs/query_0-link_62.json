        "text": "There is a moment in the 1966 film A Man For All Seasons when Paul Scofield’s character Sir Thomas More, a member of England’s privy council, sits in a private audience with the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Wolsey, played by Orson Welles, is castigating More because he is the one member of the council who will not agree with the decision to petition the pope for an annulment of the marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon. Catherine has borne no children, Henry wants to marry Anne Boleyn, and he sees it as the council’s job to help him carry out his desires. Wolsey appeals to More’s love of country, telling him that without an heir, England will return to the days of dynastic civil war, with the crown continually being fought over and the country ravaged by battle. More stands firm, refusing to bend. Wolsey, his jowls quivering and his bloodshot eyes incensed, asks in a fit of rage, “Now, explain how you as a councilor of England, can obstruct these measures for the sake of your own private conscience?” Sir Thomas looks calmly back at his adversary, and answers, “Well, I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience for the sake of their public duties, they lead their country by a short route to chaos.” It is a powerful moment, and signifies, probably more than any other, the defining credo of the character on the screen. Thomas More is a man who stands by what he believes.\n\nThe Man We Need\n\nRecently, Scofield’s portrayal of Thomas More was mentioned in a podcast I was listening to. One of the participants named More as an example of a film figure that people should seek to emulate. I had seen the film, although not recently, so I decided to revisit it. It did not take me long to understand why More had been mentioned. If you have not seen this movie, it centers around the aforementioned issue of Henry VIII’s marriage. When the pope will not grant the dispensation for annulment, Henry splinters from the Catholic faith and becomes the head of the Church of England. While many of his council disagree with this decision, slowly they cave one by one because of the will of the king, until all that remains is More. He continues to follow his conscience as it leads him, first to the resignation of his offices, then to imprisonment in the Tower of London, and finally to death. The film, and the play upon which it is based, deal with themes of conscience and consistency, and how they shape what we do and who we are. More is a man committed to personal principle, a man of conscience, of law, and consistent unto the end. As I have pondered the film and its implications, I have come to the conclusion that Scofield’s More is exactly the man we sorely need in the day in which we live. Allow me to explain why.\n\nA Man of Law\n\nOne of the film’s primary plots hinges around More’s adherence to the law, even when it would be expedient for him to bend it to his own advantage. The clearest example of this is in the film’s most famous scene. More is confronted by Richard Rich (played by a very young John Hurt), a social climber who desperately wants to receive an appointment to court. He hints that if More refuses him, he will be forced to turn to More’s enemies. More remains steadfast in his refusal, and Rich leaves. “Arrest him!” More’s wife demands. “He’s dangerous!” More’s family pleads with him to use the power of the law against Rich, knowing that he will betray Sir Thomas, but he refuses, and responds to his family’s entreaties by saying that Rich should be allowed to go even if he were “the devil himself, until he broke the law.” His prospective son-in-law, William Roper, angrily responds, “So now, you’d give the devil benefit of law?” More queries Roper, asking him whether he would cut a great road through the law to get after the devil, and Roper shouts “Yes, I’d cut down every law in England to do that.” More rises to his feet and gives the films most famous lines. “Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned ’round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man’s laws, not God’s! And if you cut them down, and you’re just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I’d give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety’s sake!”\n\nMore’s adherence to the law is in stark contrast to the current spirit of the age, in which we look for our leaders to bend the laws, to bend their rules and principles, in order to accomplish what we see as the greater good. More knows that the same law that protects Rich also protects him, and abandoning it will only lead to his own destruction. And yet we live in a time in which William Ropers are abundant, seeing principle and law as an obstacle in the path to destroying our adversaries. People on both sides of the political aisle clamor for their party to adopt the most base tactics of the other party because “they would do it if they were in power.” We beg our spiritual and community leaders to abandon the virtue and moral probity they have stood on because we believe we need to win, and the fate of the nation hangs in the balance. But what we need are not more Ropers, willing to cut a swath through the law to get at the devil, but rather a Thomas More who understands that our principles, our rules, and our laws exist for our protection as well as the protection of others, and abandoning them for the sake of winning will only leave us with a hollow and short lived victory.\n\nA Man of Consistency\n\nThroughout the film, More’s consistency is placed in firm opposition to the wavering credos of those around him. While others abandon their privately held beliefs for the sake of public expediency, More continues to follow the dictates of his own conscience. In some regards, I think you can question More’s obstinacy. When asked by Roper for his daughter’s hand in marriage, he objects, not because of any mark against Roper’s character, but because Roper is not a member of the Catholic faith. Even here, however, it seems his objection is less about the heresy he claims it to be, because he criticizes Roper for only two years ago being a passionate defender of Catholicism, and now having become a passionate defender of Luther’s doctrines. His rejection of Roper seems less about religion and more about Sir Thomas’ ultimate belief in the consistency of ideals.\n\nOn the one hand, I think it can and should be noted that there is no sin in hearing a persuasive argument and reading a set of facts, and changing your point of view based on new information. Not only is this not bad, but it would not be consistency that drove a man to reject sound reasoning, but rather plain stubbornness. But this is not Thomas More. In his conference with Wolsey, he is open to the idea of accepting a dispensation from the Pope annulling Henry’s marriage, if it is based on argument. But what he rejects is Wolsey’s willingness to change the Pope’s mind by using other forms of pressure, namely seizing the land and property of the church if the Pope should refuse. More recognizes that the England he is living in is changing its mind not based on facts or reason, but rather because the whim of the king demands that it do so. And More implicitly understands that a society of double minded individuals will always lack stability, being swayed by popular opinion and a lust for power, rather than fidelity to a set of ideals.\n\nMore stands in stark contrast to the hour we live in, in which we seem to be looking less and less for consistency from those we follow, and instead seek people who will tell us what we want to hear at any given moment. We have, in some sense, become a double minded society that says one thing, but lives by different rules in private. We see this more and more from our political leaders, from our spiritual leaders, from leaders in our community, who act and talk in ways that may violate the principles we hold, but we accept the lack of consistency because it is convenient. What we need, however, are men of ideals, who while open to argument, will not be swayed simply by a lust for power or the pressure of their peers. A consistent man does not follow the whims of the crowd but stands for truth regardless of whether he is liked for it or not.\n\nA Man of Conscience\n\nMore’s conscience is the hinge upon which the plot hangs. At times, you are forced to question his commitment to it. After all, it is clear from the start that More’s cause is doomed. The king will get what he wants, and if he won’t let the pope stand in the way, then who is Thomas More to oppose him? More loses friends, he jeopardizes his family, he loses his position and his belongings, and eventually his life, all for the sake of a lost cause. And yet still he stays committed to his conscience. To harken back to the earlier quote, he stands firm on the belief that a man who is not bound by his conscience, even for the sake of public duties, will inevitably be a man who leads society into chaos.\n\nAfter More is imprisoned, he is confronted by other members of the privy council who are urging him to sign an oath that swears the king’s marriage was lawful, which More refuses to do. They have a list of those who have signed, and attempt to convince him that everyone else has done it, why should he not? His friend, the Duke of Norfolk, states, “I’m not a scholar. I don’t know whether the marriage was lawful or not. But damn it, Thomas, look at these names. Why can’t you do as I did and come with us? For fellowship?” More responds, “And when we die, and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience, and I am sent to hell for not doing mine, will you come with me? For fellowship?” His message is clear. A man’s conscience is more important than the fellowship of his friends. It reminds me of another great character, from Harper Lee’s magnificent work, To Kill A Mockingbird. Atticus Finch is speaking to his daughter Scout about his decision to defend a black man from a rape accusation. Scout tells her father he must be wrong, because “…most folks seem to think they’re right and you’re wrong.” Atticus then tells her, “They’re certainly entitled to think that, and they’re entitled to full respect for their opinions….but before I can live with other folks I’ve got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.” Atticus, like Thomas More, knows that it is more important that a man abide by his conscience than that he be accepted by the majority of his peers.\n\nWe live in a world in which men of conscience seem in short supply. But never has there been a more urgent need for a man that refuses to be swayed by the will of the majority, but knows deep within himself that it is more important to do what is right than to do what is expedient. You may not win in the fight you are facing. You may be outnumbered, and be pressured by others to give in and add your name in spite of what your conscience tells you is right. But as Martin Luther King Jr. once wrote, ““There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.” The man who abandons conscience to follow the will of the masses may not always live with those around him, but he will always have to live with himself. Don’t allow yourself to be swayed by the pressure of others if it violates the dictums of your conscience. Stand firm in what you believe."
