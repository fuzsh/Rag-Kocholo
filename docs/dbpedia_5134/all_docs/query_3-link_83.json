        "text": "2.4.5. Genre & Interpretation: A Case Study of Western Genre Ideals in Unforgiven and Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid. [Back to Page Topics]\n\nWhat is a quintessential Western, anyway? We can certainly infer some basic traits commonly associated with the genre. For instance, Westerns are typically set geographically in the American frontier lands west of the Mississippi River and temporally between the close of the Civil War and the end of the 19th century. In terms of plot matter, they typically tend to center on violent men and loner anti-heroes, in dead serious plots that focus on revenge and feature confrontations between good and evil and wicked men meeting their bloody end. We can list off a long series of film titles that meet these qualifying characteristics, so it seems a good place to start. To be sure, one of the most successful and acclaimed Westerns in recent memory, Unforgiven (written by David Webb Peoples and directed by Clint Eastwood), easily meets all of these criteria.\n\nIf we wanted to take Staiger’s idealist method of genre definition, we’d be hard pressed to find a more ideal Western screenplay than Peoples’ Unforgiven. There’s just one problem with this approach: using Unforgiven as the ideal by which we judge all other Westerns would likely cause us to exclude the most successful and popular Western in film history — Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, written by William Goldman.\n\nGoldman’s script bucks most of the conventions we’ve just described: while the action begins in the American frontier, a good portion of the plot takes place in Bolivia; the story begins in the early 20th century; the protagonists are not loners but buddies attached at the hip, and they’re not violent; the plot is actually quite comical with romance and musical interludes included. The protagonists do meet a bloody end, but their deaths are not framed as a consequence of evil (their bank-robbing villainy) but of time (their inability to adapt to the new order of the industrial age).\n\nEven before being adjusted for inflation, Butch was slightly more successful than Unforgiven at the box office, and when adjusted for inflation, it out-performed the latter film by a factor of three. While Unforgiven received more Academy Award nominations than Butch, both films won four Oscars, and only Goldman’s script won for best writing. Which, then, is the quintessential Western screenplay and can a single genre possibly succeed in encapsulating both? Given these disparities, is the concept of genre even a useful tool in interpreting screenplay texts?\n\nOne approach to answering this problem is to ask why each screenwriter chose to situate his script within the genre tradition of Westerns in the first place. It may be that each screenwriter has done so with different aims in mind. With Unforgiven, Peoples “uses a genre as a way to study human nature,” writes Roger Ebert.\n\n“After he is fatally wounded, Little Bill says, ‘I don’t deserve this. To die like this. I was building a house.’ And Munny says, ‘Deserve’s got nothin’ to do with it.’ Actually, deserve has everything to do with it, and although Ned Logan and Delilah do not get what they deserve, William Munny sees that the others do. That implacable moral balance, in which good eventually silences evil, is at the heart of the Western . . .”\n\nIf that “implacable moral balance” is at the heart of the Western, what has it to do with two lovable thieves like Butch and Sundance? The Western credentials of Goldman’s screenplay have never been widely questioned, but how does its relationship to genre shape its meaning?\n\nOne could argue that if Peoples uses genre to study human nature, Goldman uses it to study human events. Goldman confounds genre expectations because his thesis is that history has no room for tradition. The Mythical Old West in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is merely the stage for the last act of a play that’s outlived its welcome. Butch and Sundance are criminals who belong in a traditional Western but find themselves drifting into the 20th century, into a new era with new rules. “Meet the future,” Butch tells Etta optimistically upon introducing her to his shiny new bicycle early on in the script. One super-posse chase later, however, and Butch is shoving the bicycle into the dirt and yelling, “The future’s all yours, ya lousy bicycles!” Unlike Munny, who is haunted by the wickedness of his past, Butch and Sundance are plagued by a future that has rejected them as relics, as evolutionary leftovers.\n\nUnforgiven works because it fulfills the form of the Western, while Butch Cassidy succeeds because it deconstructs the form of the Western. Both, however, need the form of the Western as a reference point in order to create their meaning."
