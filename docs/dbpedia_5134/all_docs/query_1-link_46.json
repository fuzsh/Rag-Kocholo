For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.Â\n\n1. Summary\n\nYear of Wonders is set in the small English village of Eyam in 1665, as the town struggles through a deadly outbreak of the bubonic plague. While the characters and events are fictional, author Geraldine Brooks based the novel on the true story of Eyam, whose inhabitants, at the urging of their vicar, courageously decided to quarantine themselves to restrict the spread of the contagion and protect other rural townships.Â\n\nThe experience of the plague provides Brooks fertile ground to develop characters that illustrate the extremes of human nature; displaying the dignity or depravity, self-sacrifice or self-interest that people are capable of when faced with terror, pain and the unknown. She explores the consequences of a catastrophe on an isolated, insular and deeply religious community and we see characters exhibit tireless dedication and heroism, or succumb to depression, exploitation and sometimes murderous depravity.Â\n\nThe novel illustrates that adversity can bring out the best and worst of people and that faith can be challenged and eroded. The novel explores how crises affect human behaviour, beliefs and values and reveal the real character of a community under pressure. Our job while studying this text is to consider how all the different responses to an external crisis contribute to an analysis of human nature.Â\n\n2. Historical Context\n\nYear of Wonders belongs to the genre of historical fiction (meaning it is fictional but based on historical events) and aims to capture and present the historical context accurately. The context of Year of Wonders is important to understand as it informs a lot of the division and instability in Eyam during the isolation and crisis of the plague (we explain in more detail why context is so important in Context and Authorial Intent in VCE English).Â\n\nIn 1658, only 7 years before the novel opens, Puritan statesmen Oliver Cromwell (who defeated King Charles I in the English Civil War and ruled as Lord Protector of the British Isles from 1653) died and Charles II, heir to the throne, returned from exile to rule England as King. Charles II replaced Cromwellâs rigid puritanism with the more relaxed Anglicanism and his reign began the dynamic period known as the Restoration. During the civil war and Cromwellâs rule, all the past certainties â the monarchy and the Church â had been repeatedly challenged and overturned. This all happened during the lifetime of the Eyam villagers presented in the novel and the recent religious upheaval in Britain was beginning to influence the conservative and puritan congregation of Eyam as the old puritan rector was replaced with Anglican vicar Michael Mompellion. The tension between the puritans and Anglicans is evident early in the novel and is exacerbated by the arrival of the plague, causing further internal fission.Â Â\n\nThe 17th century also marked the beginning of modern medicine and the Age of Enlightenment. During the Enlightenment, people began to privilege reason and sensory evidence from the material world over biblical orthodoxy as the primary sources of knowledge. The Enlightenment advanced ideals such as progress, liberty, tolerance, egalitarianism and the scientific method. These values are reflected in the liberal characters of Anna, Elinor, Mem and Anys Gowdie, and to an extent, Michael Mompellion. However, we also see the limited reaches of the Enlightenment in characters who succumb to superstition or self-flagellation when the plague arrives. This was a time when religious faith was frequently challenged and redefined.Â\n\n3. Character Analysis\n\nAnna Frith\n\nThe novel is narrated in the first person by protagonist Anna Frith. Anna, a young widow, mother and housemaid, becomes the townâs nurse and midwife during the plague alongside her employer and friend Elinor Mompellion. Anna is a compelling protagonist and narrator because she is part of the ordinary, working-class life of the village, but also has access to the gentry in her work for the Mompellions, meaning readers can see how the plague affected all social groups.Â\n\nAt the beginning of the novel, Anna is in many ways very conventional. Aside from her intelligence and desire to learn, evidenced by her interest and quick proficiency in learning to read, Anna married young, is a dedicated mother, had an incomplete education and never thought to question the townâs orthodox religious beliefs. However, it is revealed early that she has progressive views on class and morality and as the novel progresses, the extraordinary circumstances of the plague evoke in her heroism and courage. Brooks notes, Anna 'shrugs off the social and religious mores that would keep a weaker woman in her place'. During the plague, Anna becomes the villageâs voice of reason and an indispensable figure due to her expanding medical knowledge, tenacity, resourcefulness and tireless generosity.Â\n\nMichael Mompellion\n\nMichael Mompellion is Eyamâs Anglican preacher, having been appointed three years earlier after Charles II returned to England and replaced Puritan clergies. Generally, Mompellion is altruistic and open-minded: softening strict class divisions, combatting superstition and embracing a scientific approach to the plague. When the plague arrives, the local gentry (the Bradfords) flee and due to his charisma and position in the Church, he becomes the townâs unofficial leader. Mompellion persuades the townspeople to go into self-imposed quarantine to prevent the spread of the plague. His personal charisma, powerful rhetoric and indefatigable dedication to his work mean he can motivate and inspire his parishioners.Â Â\n\nMompellionâs unwavering commitment to his beliefs makes him a good leader, but we also see that his single-minded religious zeal can lead to harsh irrationality and hypocrisy. While progressive on issues such as class divisions, Mompellion is conservative â bordering on fanatic â when it comes to female sexuality. When his beloved wife Elinor dies, it is revealed that Mompellion denied her sexual intimacy for their entire marriage to punish her for the premarital affair and abortion she had as a teenager. Mompellion realises upon Elinorâs death that he extended forgiveness and understanding to all but his wife and, recognising his own hypocrisy and cruelty, he suffers a breakdown and loses much of his religious faith. Through Annaâs eyes, we see Mompellion shift from a character of moral infallibility, to a flawed and inconsistent man of a more ambiguous character.Â\n\nElinor Mompellion\n\nElinor is Mompellionâs wife and Annaâs employer and teacher. By the end of the novel, Anna and Elinor are confidantes and friends and their friendship arguably forms one of the strongest emotional cores of the novel, sustaining both women through enormous strain and hardship. Elinor teaches Anna to read and seems not to notice or care about their different social strata, treating everyone equally. Elinor came from a very wealthy family and initially had little practical knowledge of the hardships and necessities of life. During the plague, she confronts pain, suffering and true sacrifice. Because of her beauty, fragility and generosity, the whole town â and especially Anna â view her as a paragon of virtue and the embodiment of innocence. However, Elinor reveals that as a teenager she had a premarital relationship that resulted in an illegitimate pregnancy which she ended through abortion. Elinor considers herself to be permanently marked by sin and is plagued by the guilt of her adolescent mistakes, but her commitment to atone through service and working to help others is admirable.Â\n\nAnys and Mem Gowdie\n\nAnys and her aunt Mem are the townâs healers and midwives. Both women live on the margins of society, as their knowledge of herbal medicines and power to heal certain ailments causes fear and suspicion. Additionally, Anys further alienates the villagers by having conspicuous affairs with married village men. Anna admires Anysâ herbal knowledge and healing skill and her autonomy and unashamed sexuality, which were rare for women at the time. When the plague breaks out, Anys and Mem are murdered by a mob of hysterical townspeople, who believe they are witches responsible for the plague. This episode shows the power and acute danger of superstition and hysteria.Â\n\nJosiah and Aphra Bont\n\nJosiah 'Joss' Bont is Annaâs estranged father and Aphra is Annaâs stepmother. Brooks depicts them as unsympathetic and unforgivable, if understandable, villains as they both seek to profit off the heavy misfortune of others. Joss abused Anna greatly throughout her childhood, and while she manages to forgive him due to the suffering of his own youth, when he cruelly exploits villagers in his position as gravedigger, Anna finds his actions irredeemable. As gravedigger, Joss charged exorbitant fees from desperate people to bury their dead, regularly stole from the beleaguered families and attempted to bury a wealthy plague sufferer alive to loot his home.Â\n\nAphra is similarly amoral and greedy. Although her love for her children is shown to be strong, she capitalises on the fear and superstition of her neighbours by selling fake charms while pretending to be Anys Gowdieâs ghost. After the death of her husband and children, Aphra becomes completely deranged, dismembering and refusing to bury the rotting corpses of her children and eventually murdering Elinor. Aphraâs fate and actions show how prolonged catastrophe and suffering can totally erode an individualâs sanity.Â\n\nThe Bradford Family\n\nThe Bradford family are arrogant and pretentious. When the plague arrived in Eyam they also proved themselves self-serving and opportunistic, exploiting their wealth and status as part of the gentry to flee Eyam instead of enduring the quarantine with the rest of the village. They provide a foil to the Mompellions, who are of similar status and are newcomers to Eyam with fewer historical ties and thus expectations of loyalty. The two upper-class families provide directly opposite responses to the crisis, with Brooks clearly condemning the cowardice and selfishness exhibited by the Bradfords.Â\n\n4. Themes\n\nSocial Convention and Human Nature in a Crisis\n\nPerhaps the most significant theme or exploration of the novel is what happens to an individualâs character and community norms in a crisis. Year of Wonders depicts a small and isolated community that experiences intense adversity from the plague and, because of their self-imposed quarantine, are additionally isolated from the stabilising forces of broader society. These factors cause the people of Eyam to increasingly abandon their social conventions and descend into chaos and Brooks raises the question of whether people can live harmoniously without a strong social code. She suggests that societal cohesion is the result of social pressure rather than innate to our nature. The social norms and protocols of Eyam collapse under the pressure of the plague, allowing discerning observers like Anna to explore the validity and value of her societyâs fundamental values. Eyamâs experience of the plague demonstrates that some norms, like the limited role of women and the strict class divisions, do not need to be so repressive, while other norms and social virtues, like the rule of law and justice, are proved even more essential for their absence as order and civility disintegrate.Â\n\nBrooks also explores the response of individuals to extreme and enduring adversity and questions whether crises reveal someoneâs true nature or instead force them to act out of character.Â\n\nAnna and Elinor are examples of characters who respond to the crisis of the plague, amongst other real hardships, with a steadfast commitment to their principles. Their innate charity and work ethic are only strengthened and bolstered by the demands of the plague. However, not all residents of Eyam respond to the plague with courage and decency. Many descend into fear and hysteria, while others become malevolent and exploitative in their efforts to protect themselves. The Bonts and the Bradfords are examples of people who act with appalling selfishness, yet Brooks is careful to illustrate them as cruel and self-serving even before the plague. Thus, Brooks appears to argue that our actions under intense duress are intensifications of our true nature.Â\n\nFaith, Suffering and ScienceÂ\n\nA major theme explored in the novel is the role of faith in peopleâs lives and throughout the novel faith, superstition and emerging science contend with each other. Before the plague, the townspeople believe whole-heartedly in Godâs divine plan â that the good and bad things that happened to them were Godâs rewards or punishments for their virtues or sins. However, the plague makes this worldview unsupportable as the unremitting suffering of plague victims, depicted through gory and vividly gruesome descriptions, demonstrates that their suffering is not commensurate with their sin and that no one can deserve this fate. In particular, it is the suffering of children that most intensely shakes Annaâs faith in a divine plan. Her two young sons are early victims of the plague and their youth and innocence mean it is impossible to justify their deaths as punishment for sin. The sheer tragedy of the plague causes Anna to realise that faith in Godâs plan is inadequate to explain suffering and tragedy and she looks for another explanation. This leads her to use science and medicine to ameliorate pain. By focusing on discovering possible cures or pain relievers, Anna and Elinor are indirectly treating the plague as just a 'thing in nature', eschewing the prevailing religious view that the plague is the result of Godâs wrath. Their emerging scientific worldview does not rely on Godâs presence and intervention in the material world and Anna loses her religious faith.Â\n\nHowever, the scientific method and worldview were only in its very nascent form and most people held a firm belief in supernatural intervention, making the townspeople prone to superstition and, in their ignorance and fear, murderous mob hysteria.Â\n\nWomen and Female SexualityÂ\n\nWomen in Eyam had lived highly circumscribed and restricted lives until the crisis of the plague disrupted the social order. The behaviour and speech of women were heavily policed and punished. In a particularly horrifying episode, Joss puts his wife in a muzzle and parades her through the village after she publicly criticises him. While Joss is undeniably an all-round bad guy, his misogyny cannot be dismissed as singular to him. Even Mompellion, an altruistic and in some ways quite progressive man, takes a very harsh stance on female sexuality. Although he preached to adulterous male villagers such as Jakob Merrill that 'as God made us lustful so he understands and forgives', he denied Elinor forgiveness for her teenage sexual relationship and was unfathomably rageful when he discovers Jane Martin having sex outside of marriage. However, Brooks criticises the taboo on female sexuality and shows that sexual desire is an awakening and liberating force for Anna, twice helping her to come out of deep depressions and reminding her that life has joy and meaning.Â Â\n\nThere are strong feminist undertones throughout the novel as each female character exhibits strengths that the male characters do not and challenges the limitations of her role, expressing desire for more personal autonomy and agency. From the beginning of the novel, Anna admires the sexual freedom of Anys Gowdie and the ability of Elinor to unreservedly pursue her intellectual interests. During the plague, Anna finds herself eschewing her old role and social position and assuming many challenging and indispensable responsibilities that would have been unthinkable for any woman â especially a young single working-class woman â before the plague.Â\n\nLeadership and Judgement in Times of Crisis\n\nThe text explores both the power of religious leaders to influence public opinion and the ability of strong and courageous individuals to rise to positions of respect and authority in a crisis. Mompellionâs natural leadership and rhetorical skill keep the community calm and bring out the spirit of self-sacrifice in them. His clear dedication to his work and parishioners inspires trust in the community, and although Mompellion comes to doubt his judgement, it is undeniable that his strong leadership and assumption of huge responsibility saved countless lives. Anna also emerges as an unofficial leader; she becomes an essential figure and the voice of reason in Eyam. The communityâs newfound respect for Anna is evident in the way she is listened to and adhered to and her confidence in firmly and decisively addressing and directing men and those of a higher social class.Â Â\n\nWe see examples of powerful leadership in the novel, but we also see how an overwhelming crisis can lead to a shortage of clear leadership and expose flaws in existing governing systems. Eyam relied on its gentry (Colonel Bradford) and vicar (Michael Mompellion) to adjudicate and administer justice. However, on the advent of the plague, the Bradfords fled from Eyam and Mompellion became overwhelmed by work, leaving the townspeople to frequently administer their own justice through group tribunals or vigilante action. Additionally, the extreme circumstances of the plague mean the town must deal with crimes it has never faced before and is unsure how to punish. Brooks explores what it means to achieve justice when the only means available are faulty. There are many examples of miscarriages of justice which forces readers to think about the necessity of a strong, fair and prompt judicial system and the weaknesses inherent in these institutions.Â\n\n5.

Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTheme-Based Essay Prompt: âYear of Wonders is a story of great courage in the face of extreme adversity.â Discuss.\n\nNot sure what we mean by âTheme-Based Essay Promptâ? Then, youâll want to learn more about the 5 types of essay prompts here.Â\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe starting point of any theme-based prompt is the ideas, and while this prompt characterises the novel as one essentially about courage, it is more generally exploring the theme of how people responded to the various challenges of the plague. âDiscussâ questions give you scope to partially agree, disagree, or extend the prompt. It is okay to ultimately agree with the prompt but to also demonstrate the complexity and nuance of the authorâs intentions, and I think that is the best approach for this essay!Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nAs weâve already discussed, Year of Wonders depicts a community experiencing an acute crisis and Brooks presents the very worst and very best of human nature. There are characters who display enormous courage (Anna and Elinor), others who are cowardly (the Bradfords) and those who exploit othersâ hardships for their own gain (Joss Bont). There is also an entire supporting cast of characters who individually display neither extreme courage nor cowardice but who muddle through a terrible situation with numb apathy. There is also the opportunity to define what courage means here â after all, the decision to isolate themselves within the boundaries of Eyam took immense courage from all the villagers, who knew full well that they would inevitably be exposed to the deadly contagion.Â Â\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nParagraph 1: [Agree] The novel is grounded in and revolves around the initial courageous decision of the villagers of Eyam to quarantine themselves and risk their own lives to protect others from the spread of the bubonic plague.Â\n\nFocus on the initial act of courage and the knowing self-sacrifice that this decision required from every single person in Eyam.Â\n\nAs the event that forms the basis of this work of historical fiction, a logical argument can be made that this first act of courage in adversity forms the foundation of the novel and therefore affirms the idea that Year of Wonders is about great courage.Â\n\nHowever, importantly, this decision was an act of community courage that anticipated future adversity but was taken before many of the villagers had actually experienced the acute hardship and suffering of the plague. This is why it is important to now discuss the courage shown by individuals in the midst of extreme adversity [link].\n\nParagraph 2: [Agree] The individuals who displayed courage, hope and conviction in the face of acute personal adversity demonstrate the enormous power of courage to steel us through a crisis.Â\n\nAnna and the Mompellions concentrate on helping others and their service helped keep some degree of social order and provided comfort to victims of the plague. What they were able to achieve and provide for the community (and how much worse the situation would have been without their courageous assumption of responsibility) illustrates Brooks' high respect for courage and service.Â Â Â\n\nTo demonstrate additional analytical thinking, you might consider discussing the fact that these characters were not courageous solely out of charity, but that having an occupation and something to keep them busy and focused actually became a personal survival mechanism. This further highlights the absolutely pivotal role of courage in adversity and is only reinforced through the contrast with the ignoble behaviour of those characters who did not behave courageously and forthrightly [link].\n\nParagraph 3: [Partial disagree] However, Year of Wonders shows how adversity can provoke extremes of human behaviour and is thus also a story of human failings under immense pressure, with many characters motivated by cowardice and self-interested opportunism.Â Â\n\nHere, you should discuss the dishonourable behaviour of the Bonts, the Bradfords and the hysterical mob that murdered the Gowdie women. Your aim should not only be to explain that they behaved without courage, but also to focus on the negative repercussions their behaviour had for them and the community This will help you build an analytical argument that Brooksâ core message is about the power and necessity of courage in the face of adversity.Â\n\nUltimately, while no character escapes from the pain and loss of the plague, Brooks provides illustrations of how different people responded to their shared suffering and it is clear that she believes that the best way to respond to adversity is with the courage and strength to face the challenge head on.Â\n\n---Â\n\nIf you found this essay breakdown helpful, let us know if youâd be interested in a complete LSG Year of Wonders Study Guide where we would cover 5 A+ fully written sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY the essays achieved A+ so you can reach your English goals!Â\n\nWeâve explored themes, literary devices and characters and development amongst other things over on our After Darkness by Christine Piper blog post.

If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nLetâs get into it!\n\nThe Prompt:Â\n\nâWhile Ibaraki clearly suffers the consequences of his actions, it is those closest to him who pay the highest price. Discuss.â\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThis is a theme-based prompt, and the keywords are: suffer, consequence, actions and highest price. You want to explore both the evidence that supports the statement and also any evidence that may offer a contradiction to the statement.\n\nFrom here you can find the definition of the keywords to help develop some questions to explore.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nTo suffer is to be affected by or subject to something unpleasant.Â\n\nIs Ibaraki the only one who suffers? Who else suffers?\n\nKayoko, Johnny, Stan, Sister Bernice.\n\nHow do characters deal with their suffering differently?\n\nKayoko and Sister Bernice abandon their relationships with Ibaraki, Johnny becomes agitated and spiteful, Stan becomes depressed.Â\n\nA consequence is a result of an action.Â\n\nAre the consequences negative or positive?\n\nJohnny being outspoken in the internment camp angers the traditionalist Japanese, but creates a sense of kinship amongst the half-blood Japanese.Â\n\nCan characters overcome these consequences or learn from them?\n\nIbaraki eventually learns from his mistakes and grows as a result.Â\n\nAn action is the process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim.Â\n\nIs it Ibarakiâs actions, or lack thereof that lead to consequences?\n\nIt is often his silence and obedience that cause trouble. For example, not telling Kayoko about his work leads to the failure of their marriage.Â\n\nIs it only Ibaraki who makes mistakes?\n\nSister Bernice ignores her religion to confess her love for Ibaraki.Â\n\nWhat are the factors that cause the characters to act in the way that they do?\n\nIbarakiâs guilt and fear of authority and judgement prevent him from speaking up on multiple occasions.Â\n\nHighest price refers to Ibarakiâs suffering being above all else.Â\n\nIs this true?\n\nIbaraki loses his dignity, his friends, his wife, his unborn child, his family, his job and his freedom. However, he does partially regain these.Â\n\nWho suffers the most?\n\nKayoko has a miscarriage and her marriage to Ibaraki fails. Stan is assaulted by other internees and is eventually killed by a guard. Johnny becomes an outcast in his community and is bullied by other internees.Â\n\nAt this point, you can begin to group your ideas and evidence from the text to support your claims.\n\nThroughout the novel, Piper uses a variety of literary devices including dialogue, simile and foreshadowing to convey her message of every action having a consequence. The most prominent of these is her use of imagery and metaphor which she uses to illustrate Ibarakiâs guilt and the way it impacts his actions. However, the story is not only centred around Ibaraki. Piper also highlights that people will often face consequences no matter what decision they make. She does this through her use of foil characters (characters who are used to highlight a particular trait in another character). For example, Ibarakiâs fear and obedience are emphasised by the courage of Kayoko and Johnny Chang. These characters, alongside Ibaraki, face suffering as a result of their actions.Â\n\nFrom these ideas, the main themes I am going to explore are what factors affect the characterâs actions, and how the consequences of these actions can lead to negative, but also positive change.Â\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nParagraph 1:\n\nWhilst the novel centres around Ibarakiâs actions and their consequences, he is not the only character that makes mistakes and is forced to face the repercussions.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\nIt is not necessarily Ibarakiâs actions, but lack of action that often results in the suffering of those around him. Consider the reasons for his lack of action: his blind devotion to authority, his fear of judgement, his ongoing guilt and regret from previous situations.\n\nIbarakiâs lack of action acts as a perpetuating factor for the suffering of those closest to him, but it is not the only factor.\n\nParagraph 3:\n\nIbaraki may pay the highest price for his actions. The structure of the storyline to include a chapter from Ibarakiâs perspective years later indicates that these consequences have ultimately led to positive change.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nNow it is time to write the essay!\n\nSet during the Pacific War, Christine Piperâs After Darkness explores the difficulties and misfortunes many face during wartime. Depicting the rise and fall of Japanâs war efforts (1), After Darkness highlights that all actions have consequences of varying severity, particularly those of protagonist Dr Ibaraki Tomokazu. Throughout the novel, Ibarakiâs lack of action perpetuates the suffering of those closest to him, however, this is shown to be one of many factors and often initiates positive change within him, allowing his character to develop. Fundamentally, After Darkness highlights that change can only occur if people face the repercussions of their actions. (2)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(1) In the introduction, it is important to introduce the text withcontext. As After Darkness is predominantly set in 1942 during wartime in both Japan and Australia, it is important to include this in the introduction in order to explore the essay topic with a complete understanding.Â\n\n(2) Another key part of the introduction is to briefly introduce the topics you will discuss throughout the essay.\n\nThroughout the novel, Piper emphasises the idea that all actions have consequences, however, this idea is not limited to Ibaraki. Across the three novel strands, protagonist Dr Tomokazu Ibarakiâs suffering as a result of his mistakes is depicted through both his internal and external dialogue. Ibaraki makes many significant mistakes throughout his lifetime, one of these being his failure to perform a dissection of a child when working at Unit 731. Despite ânot [being] [him]selfâ (3) when asked to perform the operation, Ibaraki is promptly fired. His termination of employment is not the only consequence of his failure, as shame continues to take over his confidence. This is illustrated when he was âunable to go onâ during an operation in Broome, despite being in a completely different scenario. Through Ibarakiâs flashback of âBlack dots on a childâs bellyâ, Piper indicates the torment and lasting effects of consequences on an individual (4). Whilst the novel centres around his mistakes, it is revealed that Ibaraki is not the only character who is forced to face the repercussions of their actions. Despite acting as foils for Ibaraki and presenting many different qualities, Australian internees Johnny Chang and Stan Suzuki also struggle immensely to overcome the results of their behaviours. Johnny Changâs outspoken nature is often shown to cause disruption among the camp, for example, labelling the imperialist Japanese as âemperor worshipping pigâs.â In standing for his beliefs, Johnny creates a tense division within groups, leading to the half Australian internees being treated like âoutcastsâ. Conversely, Stanâs introverted behaviour results in his eventual death (5). Piperâs contention that all actions have consequences is arguably enforced strongly through Stanâs death, as it results from the failure of many characters to act. Ibarakiâs inability to open up, Johnnyâs selfishness and Stanâs loss of self are inevitably all factors leading to his eventual demise. This is ultimately reinforced when Johnny states âIt shouldâve been me Docâ, indicating he has finally realised his role in the tragedy.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) In order to embed quotes, words, prefixes and suffixes can be added to ensure the sentence flows correctly. However, you must indicate that you have edited the quote by placing your changes in square brackets. Here, the original quote was ânot myselfâ but it has been changed to fit the sentence.Â\n\n(4) Whilst it is important to include quotes, it is even more important that you analyse how the author uses the quote to convey a message. In this case, the example of one of Ibarakiâs many flashbacks is used to bear Piperâs belief that one cannot escape the repercussions of their actions.\n\n(5) Comparison is a powerful way of exploring the authorâs ideas throughout the text. Here, Johnnyâs outspoken nature is contrasted with Stanâs âintroverted behaviourâ, yet both concede repercussions. This supports the idea that all actions have consequences, no matter their nature.\n\nIbarakiâs lack of action acts as a perpetuating factor for the suffering of those closest to him, however, it is not the only factor. After Darkness shows the faults in many of Ibarakiâs actions, suggesting his mistakes lead to the misfortunes of many of those around him but this is only partially true. Stan Suzukiâs death is a pivotal moment in the novel where Ibaraki begins to truly express his emotions and open up about the pain he feels (6). Ibaraki realises that he âcould have done somethingâ when opening up to the investigators of Stanâs death, leading to the conclusion that Ibaraki is to blame. Piper illustrates that suffering results as a combination of factors through the later revelations of Johnnyâs escape attempt and the instability of the âtrigger-happyâ guard who shot Stan. This idea is reinforced through the breakdowns of Ibarakiâs close relationships with Kayoko and Sister Bernice. Whilst Ibarakiâs emotionally distant nature catalysed the loss of these significant relationships, it was not the only factor. Both Kayoko and Sister Bernice are structured with similar characteristics in the novel, one being their confidence and strength in their beliefs. Nevertheless, both women lack this characteristic when it comes to their relationship with Ibaraki (7). Ibaraki admits his separation from Kayoko is his âgreatest regretâ, and whilst the first-person perspective does not give an insight into Kayokoâs side, she is shown to lack her usual self-assuredness. Similarly, Ibarakiâs allowance of âsilence [to] stretch betweenâ¦â him and Sister Bernice is hurtful and a failure on his behalf, yet she still willingly confesses her feelings, aware of the risks involved. This is evident when âher eyes dart away from [his]â, implying she is ashamed of her statement as it contradicts her religion and the terms of their work relationship and friendship. This results in an abrupt end to their friendship as the embarrassment of the repercussions of her actions overwhelm Sister Bernice. Whilst the series of mistakes that Ibaraki makes throughout the novel show that his actions cause grief for both him and the people around him, they also highlight that the misfortune of others is not always the fault of one individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(6) Referring to specific events in the text is extremely useful to support your ideas and claims. However, it is important that you avoid over-explaining the event, as this will lead to you retelling, rather than analysing the text. See How To Avoid Retelling the Story for more tips.Â\n\n(7) An often-overlooked literary device is the use of foils. A foil is a character that is used to highlight a particular trait in another character, often a flaw. In this case, Piper uses the similarities between Kayoko and Sister Bernice, and the ultimate failure of their relationships. This highlights Ibarakiâs repetition of his mistakes, which we can attribute to his ongoing guilt.Â\n\nIbaraki ultimately pays the highest price for his actions; although this is shown to result in positive change. Through her descriptions of Australia and Japan, Piper uses the juxtaposition of light and dark imagery to illustrate how suffering can lead to learning and growth. Facing racism in Broome when labelled as a âBloody Japâ¦â, trauma from his experiences in Unit 731 and hardship during his internment at Loveday, Ibaraki is constantly a victim of circumstance. Even so, the pressures and torment of these events force him to seek the support of others. The colourful descriptions of the âpink spur of land crested with greenâ foreshadow the positive change to come for Ibaraki (8). This becomes evident when Ibaraki finally opens up to Stan in the infirmary about his separation from Kayoko. Ibarakiâs development as a character continues as he learns to trust despite the unfair circumstances of being interned. Although memories of trees haunting the riverâs edge âlike lost peopleâ and the bark of red trees appearing âlike blistered skinâ continue to plague Ibarakiâs conscience, they force him to confront his past and in turn begin to heal. Through the retrospective novel, Piper describes Japan as where âdarkness crowded the cornersâ and Ibaraki worked âin the basementâ, indicating his misguided obedience and attachment to silence. This not only illustrates (9) Ibarakiâs trauma, but emphasises his drastic development through his experiences. The importance of the consequences Ibaraki has faced throughout his lifetime are reinforced in the final pages of the novel after he reads Sister Berniceâs letter and has an epiphany. The discovery that he had âclung to the ideal of discretionâ creates a sense of hope for Ibarakiâs future and emphasises his newfound understanding of life through the consequences he has faced. (10)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(8) Ensure you donât just randomly place quotes throughout the essay, but instead, analyse them to give them meaning. An easy way to do this is by including the quote, its connotations and what emotions or ideas they provoke, followed by why the author has used it. In this case, the quote was the âpink spur of land crested with green.â Its connotations were positive such as colour, happiness, and hope. These connotations were used to foreshadow positive change.Â\n\n(9) Using a variety of vocabulary such as âillustratesâ, âexploresâ and âdemonstratesâ shows that you are not only identifying what the author is doing but that you understand how and why they have done it in this way. This is ultimately the goal of a text response essay.Â\n\n(10) It is important to ensure the flow of your essay to show sophistication in your writing. It is not only the ideas you have, but the way in which you convey and explain them that ultimately indicates your understanding of the text. A simple way to do this is to use a summary sentence at the end of each topic that subscribes to the idea and links to the previous or following paragraph.Â\n\nEssentially After Darkness highlights the necessity of facing consequences for our actions to promote learning and growth. Whilst Ibaraki and many other characters suffered as a result of their behaviour, Piper asserts that Ibaraki is not the overall perpetrator but ultimately pays the highest price of all. (11)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(11) Just like the introduction, the conclusion is a brief summary of the discussion topics throughout your text response. Most importantly, after exploring all of the evidence you must form a stance in relation to the essay topic. Many students believe that this needs to be a simple and definite yes or no, which is not the case. Instead, I have suggested that Ibaraki is not the only one to blame for other characterâs suffering, but that ultimately, he paid the highest price.

Although, itâs important not to take Lewisâ development at face value. His growth is used to highlight many of Nowraâs values on issues surrounding love, fidelity, madness and reality, just to name a few. Itâs also important to look at the development (or lack of development) of other characters and think about why Nowra might have included them in the play. Luckily for you, CosÃ¬ is quite a short play and doesnât have a huge cast of characters. However, this means that itâs even more important to get a great understanding of each character â theyâre all there for a reason!Â\n\nTo fully understand this text, youâll need to move beyond analysing characters and dialogue and consider Nowraâs main messages. CosÃ¬ is essentially a social commentary, packed full of criticisms of conventional perspectives and values. Also, CosÃ¬ is full of symbols and imagery, which can help you score highly on your essays if you integrate them into your work. Lastly, it's vital to remember that CosÃ¬ is a play, not a book, and on top of that, it is a play within a play. This means that setting, structure and stage directions are all crucial, and make for a high-scoring essay.\n\nSetting\n\nMelbourne Mental Institution, Australia during the 1970s.\n\nAll of the action takes place inside a burnt-out, derelict theatre. This serves to create an atmosphere of confinement for the audience, encouraging them to reflect on the stifling experience of the patients.\n\nCosÃ¬ is divided into two acts and nine scenes. The play is dominated by Lewisâ development. Act 1 highlights his uncertainty and distance from the world of the asylum. Whereas by Act 2, we see Lewis become more invested in the patients and the asylum, as his relationships with the other characters grow. Lewisâ development is symbolised through the changing imagery throughout the play, specifically fire and water.\n\nCosÃ¬ also is a piece of metatheatre, which Nowra achieves through structuring it as a âplay within a playâ. Metatheatre means that the play draws attention to its distance from reality. This makes sense in relation to CosÃ¬, as Nowra is continually encouraging his audience to accept their own reality instead of falling into escapism. Including CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte in CosÃ¬ also serves to highlight the difference in popular opinion between Mozartâs era and the 1970s, while emphasising the continuity of love. This contrast also helps Lewis to come to terms with his valuation of love over war, which is at odds with the common opinions of his society.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe line between reality and illusion is explored through the characters who are labelled as âinsaneâ as well as those considered ânormal.â Nowra demonstrates that reality is unique for each person, and often people may slip into illusions in order to avoid the truth. It is suggested that although they may not have been completely ânormalâ, those considered to be âinsaneâ still possess great insight that ânormalâ people may overlook. Additionally, CosÃ¬ reminds the reader of the absurdities of a mental asylum shunned by society, which would only have added to patientsâ instabilities, especially as families dealt with the matter secretly. Furthermore, the issue of love and fidelity that was valued so highly in Mozartâs era, is proven to still be relevant in our modern times. Ultimately, CosÃ¬ is a play that criticises traditional structures and views of society â whether they be asylums, university education or harsh stigma. Nowra encourages his audience to accept both the complexity of people and of life, which begins with accepting your own reality.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nLewis\n\nThe protagonist of CosÃ¬, Lewis is a new university graduate who has agreed to direct a play cast with patients from a mental institution because he needs money. At first, Lewis shares the same values as his friends Nick and Lucy -Â that love is ânot so importantâ in the days of politics and war. During the time he spends with the patients, however, Lewis experiences a turning point in his understanding and perception of people. By the end of the play, Lewis learns to value love and friendship over war and politics, even stating that âwithout love, the world wouldnât mean as muchâ. In emphasising the development of Lewisâ values away from the social norm, Nowra highlights the confining nature of society and the danger of its limited focus, which fails to recognise the value of love and companionship.Â\n\nAdditionally, Nowra blurs the lines between insanity and sanity by portraying Lewis as a bridge between the ârealâ world and that of the asylum. At the beginning of the play, Lewis states that his grandmother was in an asylum. However, despite knowing that âshe had gone madâ, he reflects that âshe was still [his] grandmother.â This, alongside his passion for Julie, enables Lewis to see the patients as people, not their illnesses. Therefore, he subconsciously allows himself to be influenced by them, just as he influences them. This contradicts the traditional views surrounding the unproductivity of the mentally ill and instead highlights their value and worth. Therefore, Nowra warns against dismissing individuals who are mentally ill, instead highlighting their capacity to garner change and therefore be productive and valuable members of society.\n\nMoreover, not only is Lewis involved in directing CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, but he also finds himself playing the part of Fernando. This again further reinforces his role as a bridge between society and the asylum (and his connection to its patients), and he ends up embodying the role. Like Fernando, Lewis is unfaithful to his partner. While still in a relationship with his girlfriend Lucy, Lewis becomes intimate with a patient, Julie. Nowra uses his unfaithfulness as evidence of the indiscriminate nature of infidelity â it is not restricted only to women.\n\nFinally, CosÃ¬ explores how Lewis deals with a hardship that he essentially created for himself â he signed up to direct the play. This links to Nowraâs view of the senselessness of war, which he views as a problem that mankind has created for themselves.\n\nLucy\n\nGirlfriend and roommate of Lewis, Lucy cannot understand why Lewis is directing a play about love when thousands are dying in the war. She has an affair with Nick, who shares similar beliefs â that politics and the Vietnam War protest are more important than anything else. The flippant nature with which she regards her affair with Nick as purely sexual is also reflective of her lack of value towards love. Thus, Nowra portrays Lucy as a personification of the societal norms of the 1970s â she is political, into free love and challenges traditional notions of femininity.\n\nFurthermore, it is ironic that Lucy and Lewis have similar names. At the start of the play, Lewis allows himself to be influenced by Lucyâs values rather than his own, but by the end, Lewisâ true views prove to be very different from hers.Â\n\nLucy also acts as a catalyst for Lewisâ change and development. She pushes him to âmake a choiceâ between the world of insanity and fidelity that represents truth for Lewis, or the world of sanity, free love and politics that Lewis comes to view as restrictive and stifling.\n\nNick\n\nAn experienced student director, roommate and friend of Lewis who is heavily involved in the moratorium (a protest against the Vietnam War). He promises to help Lewis direct CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, however he quickly breaks this vow in order to spend time furthering his political career with Lucy. Lewis later discovers that Lucy and Nick are having an affair. Unlike Lewis, however, Nick views his relationship with Lucy as âonly sexâ, therefore suggesting his superficiality and lack of compassion.Â\n\nThis superficiality is further shown through his obsession with the moratorium and his disinterest in Lewisâ CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte. He criticises Lewis for prioritising theatre over politics, stating that âonly mad people in this day and age would do a work about love and infidelity.â This suggests that what drives Nick is a desire to be seen doing the ânormalâ and ârightâ things, rather than an intrinsic belief that what he is doing is good. He views life as a series of transactions and values activities based on the immediate benefit that they bring him. For example, he admitted to helping Lewis with his direction only âso [Lewis would] help [him] on the moratorium committeeâ.Â\n\nOverall, Nick lives up to his label of being an âegotistical pigâ who âlikes the sound of his own voiceâ. He is used by Nowra as a benchmark with which Lewisâ development is compared (i.e. we can see how much Lewis has developed by comparing him to Nick). For example, at the start of the play Lewis shares similar superficial values to Nick, admitting to only take the directing job for a bit of money; however, by the end of CosÃ¬, he holds vastly different views than Nick.\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nThemes\n\nFidelity & Infidelity\n\nAccording to Mozartâs CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte, fidelity is depicted as an ideal that is never achieved. Since âwomen are like thatâ â the interpretation of âCosÃ¬ fan tutteâ, Mozart supported the belief that men should simply accept that women will inevitably be disloyal in relationships. Nowra echoes this view of women through Lewis and Lucyâs relationship. While Lucy is âsleepingâ with Lewis, she is also triflingly âhaving sexâ with Nick. When Lewis discovers Lucyâs betrayal, she waves aside his shock, defending herself, âit is not as if weâre married.â The revelation thus does prove Mozart right, that âwomanâs constancy is like the Arabian Phoenix. Everyone swears it exists, but no one has seen it.â\n\nAlthough the women in both CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte and CosÃ¬ are shown to be unfaithful, so are the men. While the men in CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte do not actively participate in adultery, they do fabricate their departure to the war and also disguise themselves as âAlbanians.â Their deception is also a betrayal to their wives. Meanwhile, Don Alfonso manipulates everyone. As seen in CosÃ¬, Lewis is unfaithful to Lucy as he kisses Julie during rehearsals. Julie later reveals that she has a girlfriend who she would prefer to be with, confirming that both men and women are unfaithful in relationships, despite whatever values they may claim to have.\n\nNowra considers many perspectives of love and fidelity, without offering a definitive opinion. Instead, he explores the progression (or stagnation) of charactersâ opinions on love and contrasts them to those of other characters, in the hope of highlighting its complexity. Nick and Lucy both view love as an indulgence that is incompatible with politics and secondary to lifeâs basic needs. Whereas Lewis claims, âwithout love, the world wouldnât mean that muchâ. These differences between Nick and Lucyâs view on love and Lewisâ, are major contributors to the deterioration of their relationships. Therefore, Nowra shows that communication and truthfulness are needed for healthy, and reciprocal, relationships.\n\nOverall, while CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte presents love and fidelity as wavering, Nowra provides a more practical view of love. Nowra suggests that love is complex and cannot be fully understood or tamed, instead portraying it as akin to madness. As love is universal, this view ties in nicely with his non-judgmental perspective on madness and insanity.\n\nSanity & Insanity\n\nThe line between sanity and insanity is explored through the juxtaposition of the patients and society. In the 1970s, those who behaved abnormally were declared to be âinsaneâ and placed in mental institutions that were shunned by society. As scientific developments have now informed us, these environments often failed to assist their patients. The use of electric shock therapy, for example, frequently led to severe, long-term negative effects upon patients.\n\nWhile the patients were viewed as âmadmenâ by outsiders, Lewis soon discovers that they are, in many ways, ordinary people. Although each patient has a mental flaw, all possess interesting opinions and beliefs on different matters. Additionally, Nowra encourages his readers to view insanity as more complex than a diagnosis or something that can be fixed with a âcoat of paintâ. Instead, he suggests that insanity is imposed on people through the judgment of others.\n\nNowra also attempts to blur the lines between sanity and insanity to emphasize the indiscriminate nature of madness. This is seen through Lewisâ character, who consistently bridges the gap between madness and normalcy. For example, despite his âsaneâ status, he is mistaken for a patient by Justin, joins Roy in imitating electric shock therapy, replaces Doug in the play, and stands with the patients against Justin.\n\nOverall, Nowra portrays insanity as a matter of perspective, rather than an objective diagnosis. He refuses to define madness, instead depicting it as somewhere on the spectrum of human behaviour. In doing so, he critisises traditional perspectives of sanity and insanity and instead encourages his audiences to consider the complexity of madness.Â\n\nReality & Illusion\n\nThe question of what is real or an illusion is weaved through the patientsâ state of mentality. As shown through Ruth who struggles to pretend like she is having real coffee on stage, it is difficult for some to distinguish reality from illusion, even if it is clear to everyone else. For others, they may willingly refuse the truth and succumb to an illusion. Lewis deluded himself into believing that Lucy was faithful, when all signs (such as Nick residing in the same home and Nick and Lucy spending time together) indicated that Lucy was, in fact, blatantly disloyal. Much like Lewisâ protective delusion, Roy uses illusions of a happy childhood to shield him from facing his reality. This builds upon his tendencies to blame others for his behaviour â he is inherently unable to face the truth of his âinsanityâ and so manipulates his reality to make it more bearable.Â\n\nThroughout CosÃ¬, Nowra also explores the relativity of reality. For the patients of the asylum, pretending to give electric shock therapy to others âseems realerâ than âkissing and stuffâ, whereas the opposite would be true in âordinaryâ society. However, CosÃ¬ also suggests that imagination has the capacity to empower. Through participating in the play, which is an illusory form of reality, the patients are able to explore their views on love and commitment.\n\nUltimately, the behaviour of characters such as Roy and Ruth encourages us to consider the reliability (or unreliability) of our own perceptions. Alongside this, Nowra stresses the importance of being able to accept your own reality, as he shows that characters who fail to do so, also fail to experience personal growth (e.g. Roy, Julie).\n\nSymbolism\n\nBurnt-Out Theatre\n\nThe setting of a burnt-out theatre depicts the miserable environment in which the patients of mental institutions are forced to live. As they are ostracised by the community, a lack of care and support is shown through the rejected and deteriorating theatre. The patientsâ considerable enthusiasm highlights their unfortunate circumstances, since even a chance to spend their time in an old building performing a play causes much excitement.\n\nAlthough we see the theatre being touched up with new lights and a âcoat of paintâ, it still remains derelict and run-down. Nowra uses this to symbolise the futility of surface-level treatments (such as medication and isolation) of mental illnesses, and how we should instead focus on seeing the person behind the illness.\n\nHowever, Nowra also uses the theatre as a symbol of hope. Despite its desolation, it is in the theatre that Lewis feels safe to grow and develop. Additionally, Julie and Lewisâ kiss takes place on the theatreâs stage. The kiss itself represents Lewis becoming more comfortable with himself and his increasingly counter-cultural views.\n\nArabian Phoenix\n\nThe women in both CosÃ¬ Fan Tutte and CosÃ¬ are compared with the Arabian Phoenix. The mythical creature is a representation of women, beautiful and enchanting, capturing men such as the god Apollo with its voice. This reflects the power of women to attract men. Nevertheless, its rarity, as often commented on in CosÃ¬ , is linked with the seemingly infrequent loyalty demonstrated by women.\n\nThe frequent reference to the Arabian Phoenix throughout CosÃ¬ continually reinforces the playâs misogynistic undertone. Its rarity is likened to the absence of womenâs fidelity, yet never male fidelity. Similarly, Nowra invites his audience to condemn Lucyâs unfaithfulness towards Lewis, yet we are not encouraged to feel the same way about Lewisâ unfaithfulness to Lucy. Â\n\nLight and Dark\n\nThe lights in Act 1, Scene 1 highlight Lewisâ entrance into a new world, where he befriends patients who will ultimately help him to learn and develop. At first Lewis, much like Lucy and Nick, possesses a âpitch blackâ perspective of the world. This is a representation of their modern beliefs that circulate around politics and war. When the lights are turned on, Roy is present, demonstrating that the patients of the mental institutions are the source for Lewisâ changing perspective throughout the play. Nowra also uses the lights to represent the hope for change that Lewis brings to the patients, and vice versa.\n\nLight is also used to directly juxtapose the chaos and desperation that darkness brings. Before Lewis entered the theatre, it was dark and derelict, symbolising the abandonment and hopelessness of the asylumâs patients. This desperation is viewed in another light during Julie and Lewisâ kiss (which takes place in the dark). In this instance, their desire for each other and the chaos that ensues is liberating for Lewis, as it enables him to come to terms with what he truly values.\n\nHowever, Julie notes that the wards are ânever really darkâ as âthereâs always a light on in the corridor.â In this sense, darkness symbolises autonomy and freedom, whereas light represents the constant monitoring and scrutinising that the patients are subjected to.\n\nEssay Topics\n\n1. CosÃ¬ contends that some things are more important than politics.\n\n2. In CosÃ¬, the âinsaneâ characters are quite normal.\n\n3. The line between reality and illusion is often blurred.\n\n4. Ironically, it is through the âmadmenâ that Lewis learns what is truly important.\n\n5. Nick and Lucyâs âmodernâ value of free love is depicted to be a backwards belief.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nCharacter-Based Prompt: It is not only Lewis who develops in CosÃ¬, but other characters as well. Discuss.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nSimply spot a characterâs name and there you have it, itâs a character-based prompt. However, itâs important to recognise that your essay does not need to revolve around only the character(s) in the prompt but should also incorporate discussion of other major and minor characters as well.Â\n\nIn this topic, it is important to incorporate other characters, such as the patients, into your essay, because they are crucial to Lewisâ development. To ensure that you stay on topic, it is best to include a paragraph (or paragraphs) that explore characters other than Lewis and their development. Also try and focus on different areas/types of development (i.e. not just Lewisâ changing values).Â\n\nHighlight Key Words:\n\nIt is not only Lewis who develops in CosÃ¬, but other characters as well.Â\n\nFind Synonyms:\n\nDevelops: learns, grows, changes, flourishes, progresses, maturesÂ\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nCosÃ¬ explores the development/growth of multiple characters, including Lewis.Â\n\nLewis is the central catalyst that enables other characterâs development to be seen (such as Ruthâs and Zacâs)Â\n\nHowever, we also see characters who fail to develop. This is either because they fail to accept their own reality (Roy) or they fail to accept the errors in their thinking (Lucy, Nick)Â\n\nNowra also uses Lewis as the benchmark against which the development of other characters is measured. For example, Nickâs lack of development is highlighted through comparing his stagnation/unchanging ways to Lewisâ growth.Â\n\nLewisâ development is facilitated by the patients. Nowra uses this to suggest the productivity of the mentally ill and challenge traditional stereotypes that label them as incapable.Â\n\nThrough Lewisâ development, Nowra highlights the falsity in societal stereotypes of the mentally ill (i.e. Lewisâs views change from being discriminatory and stereotypical to more compassionate, and well founded.)Â\n\nImagery and symbolism are used to represent development and growth (fire and water) as well as Lewisâ catalytic nature (light and dark).Â\n\nStep 3: Create a PlanÂ\n\nContention: Nowra encourages his audience to reconsider their perspective on the mentally ill by highlighting their capacity to not only change themselves, but enact change in others.\n\nTopic Sentence 1: Through his exploration of Lewisâ changing ideals during CosÃ¬, Nowra attempts to highlight the value of companionship and productivity of the mentally ill, which act to increase Lewisâ confidence when faced with adversity.\n\nExamples: Lewisâ changing ideas on love and fidelity, Lewisâ changing levels of subservience to Lucy and NickÂ\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Not so important.\"\n\n\"Without love, the world wouldnât mean as much.\"\n\n\"They are coming to take me away, ha, ha.\"\n\n\"Not sing that.\"\n\n\"I said, donât sing that song.\"\n\nLinking Sentence(s): In contrasting Lewisâ meekness to his boldness, Nowra alludes to the personal benefits that personal growth can have. Additionally, he ultimately encourages his audience to view Lewisâ learning as evidence against the common notion of the unproductivity of the mentally ill, as we see Lewisâ development flourish during his time at the asylum.\n\nTopic Sentence 2: Moreover, throughout CosÃ¬ we see Lewis develop a greater understanding of the complexity of madness due to his partnership with the patients.Â\n\nExamples: Lewisâ changing perspective of the patients, Lewisâ involvement with the patients beyond his role as director, fire and water imageryÂ\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Uncertain.\"\n\n\"Will go bezerk without their medication.\"\n\n\"Unable to believe he has found himself caught up in [directing].\"\n\n\"Water drip[ping] though the hole in the roof.\"\n\nLinking Sentence: Ultimately, through highlighting the development of Lewisâ views towards insanity, Nowra positions his audience to reflect on the complexity of madness and thus warns of the danger of stereotypes.\n\nTopic Sentence 3: Furthermore, as an outsider, Lewis assists the patients in their development, acting as their connection to the real world and ultimately providing a space for them to grow and flourish.Â\n\nExamples: Juxtaposition of light and dark, Ruthâs development.Â\n\nEvidence:Â\n\n\"Chink of light.\"\n\n\"Burnt out theatre.\"\n\n\"Real coffee.\"\n\n\"Real cappuccino machine.\"\n\n\"Wasnât [her], it was the character.\"\n\n\"Time and motion expert.\"\n\nLinking Sentence: Ultimately, Nowra explores the learning and growth of characters in CosÃ¬ to not only highlight the necessity of a humanistic approach to treating mental illness, but also to illustrate the nature of mental health as a continuum, on which no one person needs to be stationary forever.â\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our CosÃ¬ Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

Iâd recommend that you watch that video first (or read itâs accompanying blog post if you prefer reading) because once you know some of the themes, you can get even more out of this video. In this video, weâll be looking at a scene each from both The 7 Stages of Grieving and The Longest Memory, and trying to compare them a little bit.Â\n\nWeâll be applying the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy from LSGâs How To Write A Killer Comparative and exploring how ideas are developed in similar or different thematic directions in these texts. CONVERGENT ideas lead to similar conclusions and messages, while DIVERGENT ideas take us to different conclusions. If youâd like to learn more about this strategy which can help you build more insightful discussions of the text by finding unique points of comparison, then Iâd recommend you check out the LSGâs How To Write A Killer Comparative study guide.Â\n\nThe Play (The 7 Stages of Grieving)\n\nâLetâs go to scene 14 of the play - this should be the report of Daniel Yockeâs death in police custody. The woman recounts his death in a factual, impersonal style as if reading from a court report. She describes how the police pursued and arrested Yocke after he went out drinking with a group of friends, and how he was detained and taken to the watchhouse. He arrives without a pulse, but the report doesnât go into detail about how that happened between his arrest and his arrival. The woman breaks into bursts of emotion toward the end of the scene.\n\nWhile most of the play deals with issues that are universal and timeless for First Nations peoples, this scene looks at a specific real event. However, this doesnât mean that this scene isnât timeless - First Nations deaths in custody are still a major issue for which no police officer has been held legally accountable - but this scene chooses just one example out of several hundred.Â\n\nThe emotionally detached tone makes the situation feel serious, but in a way, that distances us and the woman from the brutality and the violence of what mustâve happened. After all, how exactly was Yocke dead upon arriving at the watchhouse? How badly must the police have mishandled him for that to have happened? Along the way, there are little outbursts of emotion (like the little outburst of âpeople called him Boonie!â) and these remind us that the detachment belies the true significance of what happened - the needless loss of yet another Aboriginal personâs life.Â\n\nThis has been such a persistent problem in our history - this scene happened in 1993, but even in todayâs time weâre still dealing with the same problem. The institution of policing has been unaccountable and violent for decades, at least, and something desperately needs to change.Â\n\nThe Novel (The Longest Memory)\n\nâLetâs go to the novel now and look at Chapter 6: Plantation Owners.\n\nIn this chapter, Mr. Whitechapel is talking to his peers about Chapelâs death in this clubhouse that his father had built for his own peers. Mr. Whitechapel is initially nervous that theyâll make fun of him, and they kind of do - they point out how hypocritical it is for him to think that he can treat the people heâs enslaved with humanity, and to stick to this argument even after Chapel had been whipped to death. At some point in this banter, he realises this physical violence is unjust and starts proposing âanother way to organise the economyâ that isnât slavery, but this draws even more mockery. He ultimately leaves feeling a little more convinced by the perspectives of his peers.\n\nWhat does this chapter tell us, and how is it similar to the scene from the play?\n\nWell, in both scenes, white men get away with murdering a Black man, and it comes down to socio-economic and institutional power. In this chapter, Mr. Whitechapel and his fellow enslavers all inherit significant wealth and extremely prejudiced attitudes from their fathers, and this creates not only pressure, but also a financial incentive, to conform to the system of slavery. He touches on the possibility of abolition, but this is seen as impossible - certainly, none of these men want to lose their power.Â\n\nLooking more closely at this chapter, we also see how Mr. Whitechapel is exactly the hypocrite that everybody says he is - itâs ridiculous for him to pretend heâs treating black people fairly when they are dying under his watch. He says heâs feeding enslaved workers adequately and treating them with respect, but none of this is actually going to protect them from violence, and none of this is going to level the playing field so that white enslavers are held accountable. Ultimately, Mr. Whitechapel isnât seriously interested in making substantive changes to slavery in the name of morality; he is simply trying to save face.Â\n\nIâve chosen these two scenes because they both illustrate the dynamics of race and power which pervade both texts, but these two scenes might not be the first ones that come to your mind as a pair that you can analyse together, and thatâs totally fine! I encourage you to find your own scenes to compare because thatâs what makes English powerful. If you, as a unique student, can compare two scenes that nobody else has compared, thatâs going to give you an extra edge because youâre more likely to say something original.Â\n\nIf youâre interested in finding more unique ways to compare these two texts, Iâd recommend LSGâs The 7 Stages of Grieving & The Longest Memory study guide. I know there arenât many resources out there for this text pairing, so what weâve done at LSG is work really hard at ensuring that all the information in this study guide will actually be beneficial for you. Weâre not here just to make you read more guides - weâve really thought about what would be meaningful for you as a student learning this pairing. Thatâs why youâll see that Iâve used some of the ideas mentioned in this video and turned them into an A+ essay, so you can see exactly how knowing this information translates into your SAC/exam.\n\nThereâs a free sample of the study guide you can check out to see if itâs right for you!\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nIntroduction to Animal Farm:\n\n- Written in 1945 by George Orwell, Animal Farm is an allegorical novella about the 1917 Russian Revolution and the repressive Stalinist period which followed.\n\n- As a democratic socialist, Orwell was an adamant critic of Joseph Stalin and his totalitarian dictatorship over Russia. Â\n\n- Thus, Orwell wrote Animal Farm as a satirical fable against Stalinâs tyrannical control, stating that he wrote it with the intention of âfusing political purpose and artistic purpose into one wholeâ.\n\nSetting:\n\n- The novella is set in Manor Farm, located in Willingdon, England at an undisclosed time.\n\n- As the events of Animal Farm symbolise the power struggle of early 20th century Russia, this ambiguity of time is intended to prevent Orwellâs warning against repressive tyranny from becoming dated.\n\n- Orwellâs use of a farm as the main setting is also notable, as farms represent nations in Animal Farm; both require a vast amount of work in order to function properly. Thus, the act of the animals cooperating to cast the humans out of the farm symbolises a workersâ revolution against their oppressive leadership.\n\nMain Character Analysis:\n\nNapoleon (pig):\n\n- Based on Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, he emerges as the leader of the Farm after the Rebellion.\n\n- He consolidates his control over the farm with the violent force of his nine attack dogs, having raised them as puppies; these directly symbolise Stalinâs military force.\n\n- He never contributes to other animalsâ efforts at revolution, as he is only a corrupt individual who seeks to take advantage of opportunities created for him by others.\n\nSnowball (pig):\n\n- Based on Soviet rebel Leon Trotsky, he challenges Napoleon for control of the Farm after he takes control of the leadership.\n\n- Similar to the leader he is modelled after, Snowball is eloquent, charismatic, intelligent and persuasive - thus, he wins the loyalty and support of other animals easily.\n\nBoxer (cart-horse):\n\n- Extremely devoted to the farm and the Rebellion, Boxer symbolises what Orwell believed to be the best qualities of the proletariat, or the exploited working class, such as loyalty, strength, camaraderie and hard work, perceivable by his personal motto of âI will work harderâ.\n\n- However, he simultaneously suffers from typical weakness of the working class, such as a naive trust in the intelligentsia and a slow-witted oblivion to political corruption, represented by his other motto of âNapoleon is always rightâ.\n\nSquealer (pig):\n\n- Manipulative and highly persuasive, he spreads Napoleonâs propaganda throughout the farm to intimidate uneducated animals into supporting Napoleonâs ideas and policies.\n\n- Orwell uses the character of Squealer to warn against politiciansâ deliberate manipulation of mass media in order to gain social and political control.\n\nOld Major (boar):\n\n- Based on the socialist revolutionary Karl Marx, as well as Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin, Old Majorâs dream of a socialist utopia acts as a major motive for the Rebellion.\n\n- Majorâs death creates a political vacuum in the farm, leaving Napoleon and Snowball in a power struggle for control of his followers.\n\nThemes and Motifs:\n\nTyranny:\n\n- By allegorising in Napoleon dictator Joseph Stalin, Animal Farm is first and foremost a satirical critique of politiciansâ tyrannical misuse of power.\n\n- This is epitomised by the deceitful methods Napoleon uses to gain support, such as lying to the other animals that Snowball is a political traitor in order to banish him from the Farm.\n\nNaive Proletariat:\n\n- Animal Farm explores the need for the working class to be educated, as the inability of the farm animals to question Napoleonâs authority directly leads to the perpetuation of his oppression.\n\n- Thus, Orwell presents to his readership that the working class may suffer not only due to dictatorsâ abuse of power, but also from their own naive unwillingness to question the intentions of the authority.\n\nFalse Allegiance:\n\n- Orwell accurately exhibits treacherous aspects of the human condition in his portrayal of dramatised relationships between humans and animals.\n\n- Just as the pig rulers of the rebellion eventually betray their own idealistic visions, the theme of alliance is shattered between Frederick and Napoleon when the latter learns that the former has been forging banknotes while buying firewood from him.\n\n- Thus, Animal Farm depicts the idea that alliances formed in a tyrannical dictatorship are merely veneers of camaraderie, which hide each personâs capability to destroy others in their path towards control.\n\nAnalysis of Quotes:\n\nâFour legs good, two legs bad.â\n\n- From Chapter 3, this slogan is based off of Old Majorâs speech before his death about the need for animals to unite in the face of human oppression and tyranny.\n\n- The quote is a noteworthy example of propaganda in Animal Farm, as the leaders utilise language in order to essentially brainwash the working class animals.\n\n- Although it initially helps the animals to remember their goals, the phrase later loses its meaning of solidarity as it becomes a nonsensical noise made by sheep when used to drown out the voices of challengers to the regime.\n\nâAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.â\n\n- This quote exemplifies the pigsâ abuse of logic and language to keep their power over their followers.\n\n- The evidently senseless and illogical meaning behind this phrase is an example of the methods that the leader of the Farm takes in order to brainwash his followers.\n\n- The quote also suggests that the pigsâ real intention to create an animal utopia is not, in fact, to rise up against the oppression of the humans, but to become part of the elite; the âsomeâ that possess greater rights and power than the rest of the underprivileged society.\n\nâ\n\n5 Types of Essay Prompts\n\nYour approach to each essay will depend on what type of prompt is being asked. Be aware that not all essay prompts are the same, which means that sometimes your preferred essay structure simply wonât suit the type of prompt asked. That's why it's important to be aware of the 5 types of essay topics â what you should watch out for and how you could approach your essay writing. The topics used in this blog post have been curated by Lisa's Study Guides.\n\n1. Theme-based prompts :\n\nAnimal Farm is first and foremost a satirical critique of politiciansâ tyrannical misuse of power.\n\nUsually your paragraphs will be based around particular themes. For example in this case, paragraphs may be based on âloveâ, âescapeâ, âhorrors of warâ etc. These paragraphs can have character discussions embedded within them in order to demonstrate how the characters represent each theme. Discussion of the authorâs choice of language such as symbols or imagery can be essential to the analysis of a theme.\n\n2. Character-based prompts :\n\nBoxer is the only animal with redeeming qualities. Do you agree?\n\nThese prompts focus on one or more characters. In this case, you can structure your essay paragraphs based on particular characters or something in common with a set of characters. Essays can become quite repetitive if each paragraph is based around one character so try to add in discussion about themes or the characterâs relationships with other characters. Remember that minor characters can be just as important as major characters.\n\n3. How-based prompts :Â\n\nHow does Napoleon exert control over the farm?\n\nThese prompts are usually structured, âhow does the character do this,â or 'how does the author do this'. In this case, since the prompt is focused on one main character, try to weave in the main characterâs interactions with other characters and how other characters influenced them.\n\n4. Metalanguage-based prompts :\n\nThe language in Animal Farm is crucial to Orwell's storytelling.\n\nThese types of prompts are the rarest of the 5 prompts but donât be surprised if youâre asked one. They focus more on theÂ languageÂ part of the text; rather than the plot, themes or characters. Your discussion will revolve around the authorâs use of language (metaphors, prose, syntax etc.). These discussions are typically viewed as âharderâ prompts because you need to think about how the author achieves a particular message about character or theme through their choice of words. Check out our blog post onÂ metalanguageÂ and what you need to look out for.\n\nExtra helpful resource by the BBC: Form, structure and language in Animal Farm.\n\nâ\n\n5. Quote prompts :\n\n'All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.â How is this true in Animal Farm?\n\nThese prompts can be character- or theme-based. However, it differs from other essay topics because it includes a direct quote from the text. Remember that the quote is part of the prompt, so ensure that you address it. One of the best ways of doing so is to incorporate the quote into the essay itself.\n\nWhen faced with unknown prompts in a SAC or your exam, it's reassuring to have a formulaic breakdown of the prompt so that your brain immediately starts categorising the prompt - which of the 5 types of prompts does this one in front of me fall into?\n\nTo learn more, I discuss this and offer you practical strategies (so you never mind-blank again!) in my ebook, How To Write A Killer Text Response.

For one of most popular posts on Comparative (also known as Reading and Comparing), check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Comparative.\n\nâ\n\nINTRODUCTIONS\n\nInto the Wild (2007) is a non-linear survival film directed by Sean Penn, which is based on Jon Kraukerâs 1996 novel of the same name. It recollects the final few months of the life of Christopher McCandless as he departs from society in both an act of resistance as well as a means of self-discovery. A bright young college student in the 1990s, McCandless abandons his family and affluent lifestyle to embark on a frontier-style journey into the Alaskan wilderness. Troubled by a dysfunctional family and disenchanted with the materialistic excesses of 1980s America, McCandless seeks a radical engagement with nature, in the style of his literary heroes Henry David Thoreau and Jack London. After 113 days in the wilderness, he suffers from starvation and dies. The true story of McCandlessâ journey renders the film an important depiction of self-reliance, isolation, and the unparalleled power of nature.\n\nWhilst the film is of a biographical nature, it is important to understand that it is heavily subject to the interpretations and opinions of Penn. The story is informed by McCandlessâ writings, and interviews with those who knew him, but is ultimately a work of artistic interpretation. Nonetheless, Pennâs film offers strong commentary regarding the materialistic, consumerist nature of modern living, whilst also ultimately emphasising the more humanistic importance of family and love.\n\nTracks is Robyn Davidsonâs 1980 memoir detailing her perilous journey through 1700 miles of Australian outback and the remarkable character transformations that take place throughout. The events of the story begin in 1973, when a young Robyn Davidson arrives in Alice Springs with an outlandish plan to train wild camels to accompany her through the Australian desert. When, after two years of gruelling training, she receives a sponsorship from National Geographic, her journey can finally go ahead- on the condition that a photographer accompany her and document parts of the journey. This compromise weighs heavily on Robyn, as photographer Rick Smolan intrudes on her solitude and compromises everything the trip means to her. As Robyn delves deeper into the journey, each day brings new discoveries about the camels, the landscape, the people of Australia, and ultimately, her self. TracksÂ emerges as a candid and compelling story of one womanâs odyssey of discovery and transformation.\n\nWhilst Tracks is mostly a personal account, it also presents a co-existent dichotomy between modernistic libertarianism and conventionalism, which serves as a reflection of the changing political views and ideological turbulence of the time, as Davidson notes âyou could choose not to participate in politics, but you could not avoid politicsâ. Thus, in many ways Davidsonâs journey can be seen as a firm statement that challenges the inherent sexism, racism, and âstatus quoâ, whilst also simultaneously embracing the notion of freedom, independence, and escape from conventionalism and âself-indulgent negativityâ.\n\nâ\n\nTHEMES\n\nAt LSG, we use the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy to help us easily find points of similarity and difference. This is particularly important when it comes to essay writing, because you want to know that you're coming up with unique comparative points (compared to the rest of the Victorian cohort!). I don't discuss this strategy in detail here, but if you're interested, check out my How To Write A Killer Comparative. I have used this strategy to create this themes table and throughout my character, views and values, and literary technique analysis.\n\nâ\n\nCHARACTER ANALYSIS\n\nBoth Robyn Davidson and Christopher McCandless are products of the time period in which they live, and reject the concept of adhering to a predetermined notion of who they should be and how they should behave. Both embark on their journey because they reject the expectations of their class and gender.\n\nâ\n\nAUTHORS VIEWS/VALUES\n\nTRACKS\n\nWomenâs rights in 1970s AustraliaÂ\n\nTracks is set in the late 1970s, an era of intense social and political change in Australia. The second wave feminist movements of the 1960s and 70s were enormously influential in Australia, as women began to dismantle the sexist structures inherent in Australian society at this time. Davidson describes Alice Springs as hopelessly in the grips of a âcult of misogynyâ. She rejects the archetype of the passive, docile woman. She is passionately determined to shed her own sense of herself as traditionally âfeminine,â a quality she sees as arising from being trained from birth to be âdoor-mattishâ.\n\nDavidson acknowledges her gender has played a central part in the mediaâs fascination with her journey. The character of the âcamel ladyâ that emerges suggests the significance of her trip, as a woman travelling alone in the 1970s through intensely difficult terrain. Davidson describes the late sixties and early seventies as a time of radical social time, when âanything and everything seemed possible, and when the status quo of the developed world was under radical scrutiny by its youthâ. Thus Davidsonâs actions must be considered in the context of this time, at the peak of the second wave feminist movement.\n\nThere are many explicit examples of Robyn facing misogyny and embodying feminist principles. One such example is when an Alice Springs local suggests sheâs the ânext town rape caseâ. This statement reveals the position of a woman in this misogynistic society, wherein a single woman travelling alone through the bush was synonymous with danger and irresponsibility. Davidson rejects this ideology and refuses to succumb to the violent sexism she encounters, or compromise her journey.\n\nTracksÂ is not an explicitly feminist text, but it clearly echoes the philosophies of feminism. In the years since the trek, Robyn Davidson has become a feminist symbol of defiance, endurance and strength. Thus to consider TracksÂ from a feminist perspective is important when studying this text, Davidsonâs criticisms of Australian misogyny inform our understanding of this historical context, and the significance of her actions.\n\nSome example sentences:\n\nDavidson exposes the realities of misogynistic Australian culture in the 1970s.\n\nDavidsonâs journey emerges as a defiant example of womenâs strength and independence.\n\nDavidsonâs friendship with Gladdy Posel suggests the injustices of womenâs financial dependence on abusive men and condemns the limited options for women, particularly for those in rural settings.\n\nTracks challenges the constraints of gender through a narrator that cannot be defined by stereotypical images of the domestic and passive female.\n\nIndigenous Rights in Australia\n\nThe 1970s saw the first attempts to improve the lives and rights of indigenous Australians. In 1971 Indigenous people were counted in the census, and in 1976, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act was established. Davidsonâs time with Mr Eddie exposes her to the harsh reality of the living conditions of Indigenous Australianâs throughout the 1970s, as well as inspiring a deep appreciation for the culture and connection with the land. Davidson is frustrated with the mistreatment of Indigenous people in Australia, and feels ambivalent about her status as a white, privileged, outsider in their community. Davidson confronts the racist and discriminatory stereotypes and attitudes towards Indigenous Australians, and experiences first hand the realities of the issues these people face. Davidson encounters intense generosity and friendship in the Indigenous community that she admires and presents as a stark contrast to the intolerant attitudes of white Australians in Alice Springs.\n\nQuotes:\n\nâThe blacks were unequivocally the enemy â dirty, lazy, dangerousâ\n\nâAborigines. Warm, friendly, laughing, excited, tired Pitjantjara Aborigines...â (p. 155)\n\nâCeremonies are the visible link between Aboriginal people and their land. Once dispossessed of this â¨land, ceremonial life deteriorates, people lose their strength, meaning and identity.â (p. 167) â¨\n\nSome example sentences:\n\nDavidson renegotiates her identity and relationship with the land after learning from the Indigenous Australians.\n\nDavidson condemns the racist attitudes of white Australians towards the aboriginal people.\n\nDavidson embodies the changing attitudes of young Australians towards aboriginal Australians, endorsing a respectful relationship with the traditional land owners.\n\nâ\n\nINTO THE WILD\n\nSocial criticism of materialistic excess\n\nWhile Into the Wild is set in the 1990s, McCandlessâ formative years were the 1980s â a decade characterised by the consumerism, extravagance, and materialism of President Reaganâs America. The reverberating effects of this time period inform McCandlessâ general outlook and disdain for American society. Whilst this contempt for consumerism is one motivation for McCandlessâ actions, he is equally troubled by the family violence and dysfunction he experienced as a young man. This traumatic past informs his extreme actions and outlook.\n\nExample sentences:\n\nPenn exposes the effects of materialistic society on young impressionable people.\n\nPenn explores the consequences of experiencing childhood trauma, and how this manifests in adult actions.\n\nPenn condemns the expectations of 21 st century nuclear families.\n\nPenn endorses the liberating power of familial love and relationships.\n\nDepiction of the unparalleled power of nature and manâs inability to contend with it\n\nInspired by Thoreau and London, Chris seeks enlightenment in the wild. Despite a philosophical understanding of the power of nature, Chris believes he can survive the untamed wilderness of Alaska. Although nature is the locus for self-realisation and growth for Chris, it is also what destroys him. As the viewer watches him slowly deteriorate, we come to fully comprehend the force of nature â suggesting manâs inability to control it.\n\nSome example sentences:\n\nPennâs depiction of McCandlessâ deterioration suggests humanâs inability to control nature.\n\nPenn endorses the liberating power of literature, but cautions the idealism contained within romantic depictions of nature.\n\nâ\n\nLITERARY TECHNIQUES\n\nNarrative Voice\n\nAn important aspect of Into the Wild to consider is that McCandlessâ story, while true, is told through Sean Pennâs directorial lens, which is in turn based on Jon Krakeurâs book. The story is informed by McCandlessâ writings, and interviews with those who knew him, but is ultimately a work of artistic interpretation. Consider how this affectâs a viewerâs perception of Chris, does this raise questions around representation and identity? This is in direct contrast to Tracks, which is a first person, linear past tense, autobiographical account of the writerâs experience. Where Robyn is completely in control of her narrative, McCandlessâ is subject to the artistic interpretation of others.\n\nâ\n\nSYMBOLS\n\nAnthropomorphism\n\nAnthropomorphism is defined as the attribution of human characteristics or behaviour to a god, animal, or object. Robyn repeatedly personifies the animals she encounters. The camels in particular take on their own human personalities in her life. This technique, called anthropomorphism, can be used to complement a discussion of the theme of isolation. Robyn attributes distinct characteristics to each camel, suggesting her need for companionship and the powerful absence of human connection in prolonged periods of isolation.\n\nDavidsonâs depiction of her dependence on animals reveals deeper meanings about her inability to depend on, and communicate with, humans in the same way. Robynâs reliance on her dog, Dookie, becomes more intense as the journey continues. Upon Dookieâs death, both the reader and Robyn experience the dogâs death as a powerful blow.\n\nExamples:\n\nâI am quite sure Diggity was more than a dog, or rather other than dog. (p. 207)â\n\nâBut I said goodbye to a creature I had loved unconditionally, without question. ... I walked out into the morning and felt nothing. I was numb, empty. All I knew was I mustnât stop walking. (p. 223)â¨â\n\nâDiggity had become a cherished friend rather than simply a pet. (p. 227)â\n\nKate: âremembered humans and hated themâ\n\nZeleika: âhad a lovely gentle natureâ âthe street-smart, crafty, unfazable, self-possessed leaderâ\n\nDookie: ânominally king, but if anything untoward happened he was the first to hide behind Zeleikaâs skirtsâ\n\nGoliath: âcheeky, pushy, self-centred, demanding, petulant, arrogant, spoilt and delightfulâ\n\nâ\n\nSAMPLE PARAGRAPHS\n\nPrompt: Discuss the ways in which the environment assists the protagonists in their journey for self-discovery.\n\nIntroduction: In forging connections with the environment and people around us, humans end up inadvertently discovering themselves. It is this notion that resonates throughout both Robyn Davidsonâs 1970 memoir, Tracks, and Sean Pennâs 2007 film, Into the Wild, where the relationships that the protagonists form throughout their journeys leads to intense self- discovery and growth. Both Davidson and McCandless seek knowledge and guidance through both the individuals they meet and, specifically to McCandless, the books he reads, citing it as a means of grappling with the fundamental stages of self-discovery. Whilst Davidson and McCandless experience different relationships with their immediate family, it is ultimately the concept of family that underpins their motivations and inspires them to pursue their journeys â both physical and psychological. Further, the respective temporal environments in which both protagonists are immersed in emerge as a distinct theme that facilitates each stage of self- discovery in the climatic lead up to the ultimate self-realisation.\n\nBody Paragraph 1: Both Into the WildÂ and Tracks endorse the guiding power of influential figures on both protagonists, as a catalyst for their growth. Davidson commences her self-described âlunaticâ journey with little knowledge of the wild to substantiate her mammoth ambition. That her drive outweighs her preparation manifests in the early moments of the text, wherein Davidson endures a grueling internship with the impulsive âmaniacâ Kurt Posel. This man appears the epitome of the âbiased, bigoted, boring and above all, brutalâ man she describes as the stereotypical âAussie maleâ. Kurt is abusive to both Davidson and his wife, but his eccentric and impulsive ways expose her to the harsh realities of bush living. Ultimately, Kurtâs guidance allows Davidson to gain the fundamental skills she needs to train camels, whose dispositions reflect the erratic nature of Kurt himself. In direct contrast to this tense, exploitative relationship, is Davidsonâs nuanced and spiritually rewarding relationship with Mr. Eddie, an aboriginal elder whom she describes as a âsheer pleasure to be withâ.Â Despite an ostensible language barrier, Eddieâs instruction of the Indigenous Arts and Culture leave an impressionable impact on Davidsonâs character and personality. By accepting Eddieâs guidance at a pivotal point in her journey, Davidsonâs ambivalent sense of self, theÂ overwhelming feeling of being an imposter, is diminished.Â Davidson becomes more grounded and connected to her environment;Â the knowledge that she derives from key characters contributes to a distinct conformational change in her personality and thus critically assists her in developing a strong sense of one self.Â A similar theme resonates in Into the Wild, where Chris McCandless heavily relies upon the guidance of various prominent figures he meets throughout his journey as well as âthe characters of the books he loved from writers like Tolstoy, Jack London and Thoreauâ whose words he could and often would âsummonâ¦.to suit any occasionâ. The fact that McCandless readily referred to the words of the likes of Tolstoy, London, and Thoreau amidst times of mental angst and challenge, is a significant reflection of not only the quintessential teacher and student relationship he shares with them, but also the level of impact they have had in shaping in the ideological processes that define Chrisâs values and sense of oneself.Â This very idea is furthered by Sean Penn when he depicts Christopher McCandless quoting soviet Russian poet, Boris Pasternak, suggesting that humans âought to call each thing by itâs right nameâ, following which he acts impulsively and with great haste, engineered with rapid and distorted camera movements. In doing so, Penn illustrates the importance that Chris places upon the words of such idealists to the stage where he acts upon their advice without giving them proper consideration within his literal, temporal context. The protagonists of both Into the Wild and Tracks, both rely upon the knowledge and guidance of individuals, be they physical or via literature, as a means of grappling with their fundamental understanding of the human spirit and in doing so their intricate understanding of themselves.\n\nBody Paragraph 2: Both texts demonstrate a degree of discontentment and resent towards the institutionalized, '20thÂ century convention'Â of"
