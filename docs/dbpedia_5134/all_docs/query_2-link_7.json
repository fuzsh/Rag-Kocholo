        "text": "Recently, I had the privilege of listening to a remarkable communicator. Dr Stephan Feldhaus, the head of group communications for Roche, was talking about his belief in communicators and their role as a conscience for their corporations that they work with. Dr Stephan should know a thing or two about the concept of morality - he holds a PhD in theology.\n\nThe point Dr Stephan was making is that there's no one better placed to advise business leaders on what is ethically right and wrong. Whilst there are others in an organization whose role it is to advise on actions and their validity, such as the legal function which is focused on what is legal and illegal, none can talk about what stakeholders view as ethical with as much weight as communicators. Our job is to understand the views of all of our stakeholders in relation to organization activities, and to help our business leaders appreciate how these views and expectations affect the corporate reputation.\n\nRecent examples of unethical behavior underline my feeling that communicators need to step up and become the voice of reason. Take the example of Sepp Blatter and Fifa, who have stumbled from crisis to crisis without any sense of morality. Blatter's legal team have been concerned about his actions from a legalistic standpoint, and have worked to present an argument that he has broken no laws. Even if this is the case, in the courtroom of public opinion Blatter should have both resigned and stepped down a long time ago.\n\nThis notion of a corporate conscience applies even more in a region such as the Middle East, where many large corporations are government owned and are therefore unlikely to be legally responsible for any shortcomings. And yet, the likelihood is that stakeholders, especially those from the public, will be talking about corporate failings on social media long before any traditional media coverage (again, partly due to government ownership of the media in our region).\n\nWith all of the recent failings at the likes of Fifa, VW and other corporations, the need is there and growing for communicators to be brave, to stand up and say that certain actions should not be taken for the good of the company's reputation. Communicators need to act as the corporate conscience and guide their business leaders for the long-term good. Some communicators, visionaries such as Roche's Dr Stephan, have taken this approach. Will you be bold enough to do the same?"
