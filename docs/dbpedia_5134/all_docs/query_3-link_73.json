        "text": "By Tom Snyder, Ph.D.\n\nStories matter deeply to us. They make a profound difference in our lives. They stimulate our minds, kindle our imaginations, and stir our emotions. They bring us laughter, tears, excitement, and joy. They help us escape the daily cares and woes of our present lives for a while and travel to different times and places. They arouse our compassion and empathy, spur us toward truth and love, and sometimes even incite us to hatred or violence.\n\nTo see “genres in pictures” click here.\n\nWhy do we respond so strongly to stories?\n\nOver the years, scholars have given us at least two basic answers to this question.\n\nFirst, different stories satisfy different needs. A comedy evokes a different response than a tragedy. A hard news story on page one affects us differently than a human interest story in the magazine section or a celebrity profile next to the movie listings. Second, although different stories satisfy different needs, many stories have common themes, settings, character types, situations, and other recurring patterns. They possess a timeless, universal quality.\n\nThe second answer leads us to the field of interpretation called myth studies or archetypal analysis. The first answer helps us organize stories according to their genre. This article deals specifically with movie genre, but sometimes treats the subject of movie genre in an archetypal, mythic manner.\n\nHermeneutics, the Science of Interpretation\n\nHermeneutics is the science of interpretation, or deciphering meaning(s). Genre can be an important factor when trying to interpret a work of art or a book, including a work of non-fiction. The use of genre can help authors or creators to structure the meaning of their texts. Looking at genre can help readers, viewers, or listeners determine the meaning(s) that the author intends to convey.\n\nA genre is a body, group, or category of texts that resemble one another because they share a sufficient number of similar motifs, themes, visual designs, ideas, characters, story formulas, and plot devices. By looking at these various common traits, readers, viewers, and listeners can better understand each genre and each text that seems to be part of a particular genre. After better understanding the text’s meaning(s) through the use of genre, they can then apply their particular worldviews, philosophies, metaphysical viewpoints, etc., to evaluate the text’s ultimate value to them and other people.\n\nFor example, the parables of Jesus Christ in the Four Gospels are a kind of literary genre. A parable is a succinct, brief story illustrating a theological, spiritual or moral point. Studying the genre of parables can help us better understand the points that Jesus is trying to get across to his listeners.\n\nEvery author or creator “couches his message in a certain genre in order to give the [audience] sufficient rules by which to decode that message. These hints guide the [audience] and provide clues for interpretation.”1 Thus, each text in a particular genre is an individual version of a general pattern. This pattern is defined by a set of unwritten rules and expectations. For instance, when we go see a particular kind of movie genre, like a comedy, a romance, a war movie, a horror movie, etc., we expect the movie to follow certain rules and to have certain kinds of plot devices, characters, themes, and even visual designs.\n\nIn addition to this, however, a text will also often give us some interesting variations on these common traits. When describing genres and texts which use genres, therefore, we can speak of them as using both Convention and Invention. A convention is an unwritten agreement of expectations between the creator and his or her audience. For example, when we expect to see a movie about the Vietnam War, we expect to see young American soldiers battling Vietcong in a jungle setting. Sometimes, a genre text deliberately sets out to defeat these expectations, as Stanley Kubrick does in Full Metal Jacket when he sets its Vietnam battle scenes amongst burned-out buildings. The use of convention creates shared images and meanings while the use of invention produces new perceptions and meanings. Conventions can change over time, and this helps different genres to incorporate new cultural values.\n\nGenre categories are hardly ever rigid and pure, however. They often overlap. A particular text may thus combine different genres. For example, many “B movies” in the 1950s combined the horror movie with the science fiction movie. The Alien movies starring Sigourney Weaver are a recent example of this kind of mixture. There are also movies and stories that belong to so-called sub-genres, such as slapstick comedies, numskull comedies, westerns about gunfighters, or science fiction stories involving time travel.\n\nThe Bible is composed of many books. These books contain examples of many different genres. At the broadest level of genre, the Bible contains both prose and poetry.2 More narrowly, it contains examples of historical narrative, different kinds of hymns, wisdom literature, apocalyptic literature, parables, private letters, public epistles, prayers, creedal statements, love songs, etc.\n\nBelow is a list of some typical movie genres and the conventions, story formulas, motifs, themes, symbols, and imagery, or iconography, that may be seen within them.\n\nCLICK TO VIEW\n\nHorror Movies"
