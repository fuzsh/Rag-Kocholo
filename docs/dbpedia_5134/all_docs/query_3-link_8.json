        "text": "I was sorting my movie library, and I think I love genre movies most. My ratio is like 70% genre movie to 30% other.\n\nWhat do I consider genre movies? SciFi, Horror, Fantasy, Historic/Period, Crime/Detective/Thriller, Action/Adventure, Musical, Mystery. My favorite movies are in any of this genre… Maybe I have missed a genre.\n\nBut what are great non-genre movies? They need to have a contemporary setting, at least when they came out.\n\nSo here are some of my top 8 1/2\n\nAdaption (Charlie Kaufman it’s not a genre, right?)\n\nInside Llewyn Davies\n\nHannah and Her Sisters (Woody Allen is not a genre, right?)\n\n3 Colors (Trilogy by Kieslowski)\n\nThe Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover\n\nMagnolia or Punch Drunk Love\n\nRushmore or Tenenbaums (Wes Anderson could have created his own genre)\n\nTomorrow, this list might look different, but this is from the top of my head today.\n\nWhich ones do you got?\n\nI, too, find this definition of “genre” and “non-genre” to be reductive to the point of being nonsensical. So you consider “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” to be a genre film, just because it takes place a few hundred years ago? That’s a weird way to think about one of the most beautiful and surprising films of the last few years.\n\nI’d argue that when someone talks about a film being a “genre” film, what they are really saying is that it fails to transcend that genre. Because of course, all films have a genre. All stories can be categorized as a certain type. But there’s a huge distinction between Madame Bovary and, say, a Danielle Steele romance, even though they may both be period romances with the same themes.\n\nSo Texas Chainsaw Massacre? That’s a genre film: an excellent one, that evolved the genre as a whole, but still a film which follows the established beats of the horror genre, through and through. But a movie like David Lynch’s Eraserhead isn’t a genre film in the same way, because while it is in its own way a terrifying movie, what is trying to do formulaically is something very, very different than what we think of as horror.\n\nIn fiction, this distinction is usually handled by calling something “literary.” Maybe, then, what you really mean here isn’t “non-genre” but something closer to “filmic” or even “high-brow”\n\nOK, I disagree (you can have period/historic movies in almost any genre), but in that case why is comedy not a genre? Neither western or noir is on your list (except perhaps as subsets of crime and/or detective), and they’re far more distinctive as genres than “non-contemporary”.\n\nEdit: Posted before DrCrypt’s post, which much more eloquently expresses my issues with the question. Though I’m not sure a genre film necessarily fails to transcend its genre, it’s more that it is primarily defined by its relationship to the genre,.\n\nas I wrote, I probably missed some genres (Western). I think I should re-name the thread to “your favorite contemporary movie”. But I am looking for favorites, that are not part of a genre, because I would like to know other great movies out there, that I missed (because I watch a lot of genre). There is nothing wrong with a genre type movie. The best movies made are part of a genre, like all Hitchcocks or Stanley Kubrick did almost all genre movies. Except, Eyes Wide Shut and Lolita.\n\nLady on Fire was a great movie, regardless of genre (historic, period piece), with pretty contemporary themes.\n\nHow about…\n\nFrances Ha!\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross?\n\nSteve Jobs?\n\nYour Sister’s Sister?\n\nA Serious Man?\n\nA Single Man?\n\nLady Bird?\n\nNocturnal Animals?\n\nRachel Getting Married?\n\nAfter the Wedding?\n\nShort Term 12?\n\nTowlhead?\n\nCalvary?\n\nMother!?\n\nMud?\n\nCarnage?\n\nWhiplash?\n\nThoroughbreds?\n\n11:14?\n\nFar from Heaven?\n\nForce Majeure?\n\nCaptain Fantastic?\n\nThe King of Staten Island?\n\nLittle Women?\n\nAnother Year?\n\nUp in the Air?\n\nUnder the Silver Lake?\n\nShimmer Lake?\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri?\n\nI am thinking of ending things?\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment?\n\nThe Meyerowitz Stories?\n\nThe Hunt?\n\nThe Help?\n\nThe Visitor?\n\nThe Guest?\n\nThe Master?\n\nThe Tribe?\n\nThe Descendants?\n\nThe Lives of Others?\n\nThe Spectacular Now?\n\nThe Ice Storm?\n\nThe Celebration?\n\nThe Overnight?\n\nThe Virgin Spring?\n\nI am guessing it just means Drama, or more specifically “Character Drama”. (omit question marks)\n\nI think one of the last films I watched during the pandemic was Kajillionaire by Miranda July with Evan Rachel Woods. It’s also some kind of magical-realism. It is a strange little family, they live like nomads in LA (?), do little criminal stuff. But the parents are horrrible people, they try to keep their daughter small and dependent (Woods). But she manages to break free, it’s just wonderful how the film does it.\n\nI also loved Me and You and Everyone We Know, also by Miranda July. Small, delicate stories in a big city. Need to find a copy…\n\nThen there are the great, small, intimate films by Amos Kollek, “Sue” and “Fast Food Fast Women”. Also little stories in a big city, but all about this fragile actress, Anna Thomson. Very fragile.\n\nThe Conversation is one of my favorite movies of all time. Is it a genre? I don’t know, paranoia movie of the 70s, crime story… The sound design is just perfect (it’s a Walter Murch movie like THX 1138)."
