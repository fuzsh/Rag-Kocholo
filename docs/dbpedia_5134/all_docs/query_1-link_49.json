        "text": "Background\n\nIn most theories, and certainly in common sense experience based on introspection, consciousness is singular. There is only one ‘me’ and that is the one that is conscious. This means that ‘singularity’ is a defining aspect of ‘consciousness’. Bayne (2008, 2010); Bayne and Chalmers (2003) distinguish different definitions of unified consciousness, and in one sense, singularity refers to 'subject unity’. Subject unity is present if all the experiences generated in a system belong to one subject. In other words, if a system contains a first‐person perspective, then subject unity is preserved if that system only contains one such perspective, but subject unity is absent if the system contains multiple first‐person perspectives. Another definition of unified consciousness refers to representational unity. This indicates whether the contents of an experience are integrated. For instance, when you are driving a car and listening to GPS instructions, your sight and sound are related to each other, whereas if you listen to the radio, the visual and auditory contents are not integrated (Sasai, Boly, Mensen, & Tononi, 2016). So, representational unity is preserved in the former, but not in the latter case. Thus, the existence of a singularity refers to subject unity: One subject undergoes all the experiences existing within a system. Representational unity is more closely related to the sense of singularity, or the 'feeling of oneness'. This distinction bears some resemblance to the ‘subjective self’ and the ‘objective self’. The former refers to the sense of self, whereas the latter refers to the self as an experiencer.\n\nThe currently leading theories on consciousness in cognitive neuroscience are the Integrated Information theory (IIT, Tononi, 2004, 2005; Tononi & Koch, 2015), the Global Workspace theory (Baars, 1988, 2005; Dehaene & Naccache, 2001), and the Recurrent Processing theory (Block, 2007; Lamme, 2006; Lamme & Roelfsema, 2000). According to IIT, consciousness arises when a system has a rich representation repertoire and its subsystems are strongly interconnected. However, when the integration within a subsystem is larger than the connection between subsystems, consciousness will arise as a function of the subsystem rather than of the system as a whole (Tononi, 2004, 2005). Thus, this theory suggests that split‐brain patients, in whom integrated information processing is mostly confined within the two hemispheres, are two conscious agents; one agent per hemisphere. Note that this seems to refer to subject unity, or the objective self. According to Global Workspace theory, the cerebral hemispheres house a ‘global workspace’. This global workspace can be thought of as the ‘headquarters’ of the cortex, which receives information from and projects to many cortical modules. Only information processed by the global workspace reaches consciousness. Recurrent Processing theory asserts that consciousness can arise through local recurrent processing between cortical modules, even in the absence of global or integrative cortical processes. However, such local processing, by itself, only leads to phenomenal consciousness that is otherwise inaccessible, and unreportable. Thus, for unified reportable consciousness, strong integration between the hemispheres is needed. These models all share the idea that unified consciousness requires massive, coherent activation of neuronal tissue in the brain. Note that in these theories, no clear distinction is made between the sense of self and the existence of a self. For instance, IIT seems to claim that in a split‐brain two first‐person perspectives exist. That is, there really are two independent conscious agents in a split‐brain, one per hemisphere. IIT is silent on how the sense of self is impacted. In theory, even if there are two agents, they could still (mistakenly) think of themselves as only one agent. In general, none of the leading theories of consciousness clearly distinguishes between the objective and subjective self, and none clearly indicate which processes underlie either of these selves.\n\nHere, we will address this lacuna. We will postulate a model that deals with the subjective self, that is, the sense of singularity. Our model is grounded on three main hypotheses. The first hypothesis states that conscious awareness is distributed (e.g., Weiskrantz, 1999). The conscious experience of perceptual, language, memory, attentional and even motor processes may largely proceed unintegrated in parallel. Thus, this addresses, in Bayne's terms, representational unity, not subject unity. That is, we claim that many conscious processes may contribute to experiences with parts that are not integrated with each other (comparable to movies in which sound and sight are out‐of‐sync) although they still all may be experienced by one subject.\n\nThe second hypothesis argues that the subjective feeling of singularity, that is, the subjective self, can coexist with several disunified conscious experiences. The sense of singularity, then, is an experience that may only come into existence when we need to move our (single) body in an environment characterized by response constraints. Thus, conscious awareness may largely proceed unintegrated in parallel, whereas the sense of unity only arises when organisms need to respond coherently and purposefully. The third hypothesis suggests that the sense of singularity is based on a separate neural system involving an extensive subcortical network (e.g., the thalamus and the striatum), prefrontal, and insular structures that is concerned with developing intentions and action plans.\n\nRegarding the first hypothesis, note that many studies with healthy subjects on attention claim that 'the brain cannot process all incoming information, therefore we need selection by means of attention’ – the so‐called early selection idea of attention (Broadbent, 1958; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Yantis & Johnston, 1990). However, this claim may be erroneous, since the brain can, and in fact does, process massive incoming information in parallel. As far as selection takes place, it is mainly outside the purview of top‐down attention. This is also apparent from our visual experience. In contrast to the claims stating that 'change blindness' is driven by consciousness bottlenecks, it is evident that you experience a lot of visual information at the same time without needing attention. Parallel processing even occurs in attention as has been shown by ‘multiple object tracking’ studies (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2005; Cavanagh & Alvarez, 2005; Drew, Mance, Horowitz, Wolfe, & Vogel, 2014) and ‘functional split‐brain’ (Sasai et al., 2016) investigations. In all these perceptual examples, there is no place in the brain where all the visual information comes together. The notion of a single phrenological seat for consciousness seems like a highly improbable explanation of the sense of singularity. After all, even within a single cortical area, information is distributed, and it is impossible that eventually all information is projected onto a single neuron.\n\nIn contrast, we suggest that the sense of singularity does not arrive as a by‐product from having one seat of consciousness but is the result of the interaction between intentions and the possibilities or affordances of our body, and the environment. This system is, typically, single because, although there are many different input channels signalling different aspects of the outside world and many response possibilities, there is, however, only one body in one environment. Motor control is effected at many levels, ranging from spinal reflexes to subcortical, cerebellar, and cortical systems. Therefore, we are able to execute complex and sometimes conflicting behaviours. However, at the highest level, we formulate intentions and develop action plans that concern a single body in an external world that allows to successfully satisfy some but no other intentions. The second hypothesis thus argues that our experience of a singular ‘Me’ finds its origin in this intentional, action directed process. It is not the binding of different cognitive processes that causes this experience but the need to satisfy intentions using your body. We are, thus, hypothesizing a Gibsonian (e.g., Gibson, 1979) interpretation of the sense of singular agency. The third hypothesis is more speculative and suggests that this intentional singularity system has evolved in a phylogenetic fashion from a basic subcortical system for motor planning to a high‐level cognitive system involving the prefrontal and insular regions. Our starting point here is similar to the ‘Passive Frame Theory’ proposed by Morsella, Godwin, Jantz, Krieger, and Gazzaley (2016), who proposed a framework from an action‐based perspective. They suggest that the primary function of consciousness is serving the somatic nervous system: ‘it constrains and directs skeletal muscle output, thereby yielding adaptive behavior. The mechanism by which consciousness achieves this is more counterintuitive, passive, and “low level” than the kinds of functions that theorists have previously attributed to consciousness’. They propose two separate types of consciousness: paleoconsciousness that originates in a phylogenetically old system like the olfactory system, and neoconsciousness that arising from thalamic and cortical processing. We agree that environmental and bodily affordances are important but we disagree with their focus on the olfactory system and the somatosensory system. More importantly, we do not concur with the suggestion that this system subserves consciousness as a whole but propose instead that such a system might explain the sense of singularity. Therefore, our suggestion is more in line with the commentary of de Vries and Ward (2016), who also start with claim that the environment affords many possible actions. They suggest that we have perceptual, cognitive and motor systems that afford such a huge number of possible actions that there is a need for constraints. They propose that the more elaborate neoconsciousness system based on a subcortical network evolved, along with neocortex, to extend the range of affordances, thereby providing a basis for very sophisticated behaviours involve moving the body and limbs in complicated ways. These action affordances develop in environment‐specific settings, but experience enables us to extend these behaviours to novel projections in space and time. Subsequently, it allows for the planning of complex movement patterns well beyond the range of direct perception.\n\nIn addition, communication is also an interaction between a person and his or her environment. Speaking allows for endless different messages to be shared with the environment, but it is essentially singular: You simply cannot say two things at once. Then, it might follow that higher‐order thinking (in the sense of verbal thought) is also experienced as singular. That is, it is also under the control of the singularity constraints. That means that you can consciously think of all kinds of different things at the same time (parallel, pre‐verbal notions), but if you want to translate it into language (speaking or internal speech), it will become singular. If that makes sense, it means that the ‘function’ that monitors or imposes singularity is within the brain's functions that regulate our intentions in the environment. As a first approximation, it is likely to be based on a phylogenetically older subcortical network and cortically distributed over the frontal/parietal areas (but it does not have to be in one separate area). In addition, it is possible that the insula, as a higher‐order emotional representation of the body, is also involved (e.g., Morsella et al., 2016).\n\nBelow, we will re‐examine the theoretical implications of the neuropsychological impairments in conscious awareness against the backdrop of our new hypothesis. Subsequently, we present a first attempt to test this hypothesis with a resting state imaging experiment in a split‐brain patient."
