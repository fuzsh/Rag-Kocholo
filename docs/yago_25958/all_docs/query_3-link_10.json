        "meta_description": "Blink of an Eye: Directed by Brian Mertes. With Beth Ehlers, Ricky Paull Goldin, Bonnie Dennison, Kim Zimmer. Harley thinks back to when she originally had to give Susan up for adoption. She swears no one will take baby Sydney away from her. Gus does his best to downplay Harley's fears that Susan is angry with her for some reason. They decide to make an unscheduled visit to Susan at boarding school. Upon entering her room, Gus and Harley find that the web cam they gave her to keep in touch was placed in a \"made up\" set. When Tiffany arrives, Susan's roommate, she tells Gus and Harley to get out that no one named Susan is living there! Turns out that Susan has started going by the name Harley gave her at birth, Daisy. While trying to find \"Daisy\", Harley and Gus barge in on a young couple making out and awkwardly return to Springfield. Harley imagines what it would be like to have Daisy home with her. While still trying to find her, Harley and Gus go to ask Reva if she has Dylan's phone number. When Reva inquires why, they tell her about Daisy. Reva tells them that Susan/Daisy came and visited her just recently! Harley can't believe that Daisy had returned to town and not visited her! Returning home late in the evening, Gus and Harley realize that Sydney has fallen asleep in the living room of their house and decide to let her stay downstairs. Later, Harley hears a noise downstairs and when Gus investigates catches a burglar in their house. The thief hurts Gus and makes his getaway. In the wee hours of the morning, Harley gets a phone call from Daisy and the two of them speak about their lives. Daisy says she will testify on Harley's behalf at the custody hearing. When Susan/Daisy hangs up, she looks at a digital camera picture that Gus had taken earlier that day! The thief that stole the camera from Gus and Harley's home is actually Daisy's boyfriend....Olivia's former hitman-for-hire, Gillespie! Daisy orchestrated the whole robbery.",
