        "text": "=======================================================\n\nThe TriBeca Film Festival is back. This year, it’s very New York-centric.\n\nAmong the films: “Bernstein’s Wall.”\n\nThe Tribeca website describes the world premiere of the film directed by Westporter Douglas Tirola (4thRow Films; co-founder, Westport’s Remarkable Theater):\n\nIn this enlightening look at one of the greatest classical music figures of the 20th century, director Douglas Tirola mines a rich trove of interviews, television appearances, home movie footage, photos, letters to craft a comprehensive look at Leonard Bernstein, whose passion and drive took him well beyond the marvelous music he wrote and conducted.\n\nSpanning the breadth of a life interwoven with key historic moments outside the concert hall, Bernstein’s Wall follows the son of a Russian Jewish immigrant who arrives in New York from his Boston hometown to eventually become conductor of the New York Philharmonic, and becomes a household name thanks to his numerous TV appearances, educating the public on all things symphonic, West Side Story, being seen with celebrities and politicians, and his crossing-the-line activism, from protesting the Vietnam War to (controversially) supporting the Black Panthers.\n\nTirola incorporates Bernstein’s personal life — his fraught relationship with his father, his marriage, his family life, his struggles to be at peace with his sexuality — to paint a complex portrait of a complex, driven individual who produced some of the most memorable music of his time as a product of those times.\n\n(“Bernstein’s Wall” is available for streaming from June 15-23. Click here for details. Hat tip: Kerry Long)\n\n=======================================================\n\nYesterday’s Yappy Hour at MoCA Westport was paws-itively cool.\n\nThe arts center hosted plenty of dogs (and their owners) on its expansive Newtown Turnpike lawn. Food was collected for PAWS and Westport Animal Shelter Advocates.\n\nMissed yesterday? Doggone it! The next one is July 1.\n\nYappy Hour at MoCA Westport! The next one will be held on Thursday, July 1.\n\n=====================================================\n\nJust in time for the end of the spring sports season: Westport Rotary Club and the Westport Soccer Association are collecting used soccer uniforms, clothing, shoes, shin guards, balls and other equipment.\n\nThey’ll ship it all to Nicaragua. Rotary already works there with NicaPhoteo, a non-profit that helps communities.\n\nThe soccer equipment is much needed. Soft backpack bags, old balls, socks, jerseys and shirts — it will all go to good use.\n\nThe drop-off location is 5 Sugar Maple Lane, Westport (off Whitney Street). There’s a box on the front porch. Please wash clothing items first!\n\nQuestions? Email registrar@westportsoccer.org.\n\n=======================================================\n\nMore than 30 years ago, kids were talking.\n\nDr. Donald Cohen’s nationally televised show — in which, well, kids talked (about everything in their lives) is being relaunched. Fittingly for a new century, it’s a livestream, on YouTube, Facebook and Twitch.\n\nThe first episode of the relaunch is tonight (Thursday, June 10), at 7 p.m. The topic is body image and eating disorders. Teenage guests come from Westport — and around the country.\n\n“Kids Are Talking” started in 1990 at Fairfield University. It became a national radio call-in show on WICC, simulcast on Cablevision.

She was 69.\n\nBorn in New Haven, her family moved to Westport in 1959. She graduated in 1970 from Staples High, where she met and married the love of her life, Mark R.

From Cranbury League baseball and Pop Warner football, to high school baseball and football, she was there. She also enjoyed watching her grandkids in softball, baseball, gymnastics, soccer and hockey.\n\nPatti retired in December 2017 as a bookkeeper after 32 years, to spend time with her family.\n\nHer words to all family and friends are, “Live life to the fullest, with love and respect to others, because you never know what tomorrow brings.”\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Whittingham Cancer Center, in memory of Patti.\n\n=======================================================\n\nAnd finally … Happy Kamehameha Day! The state holiday (one state only!) honors the monarch who first established the unified Kingdom of Hawai’i.\n\n=====================================================\n\nHas the dreary weather got you down?\n\nThink back to a year ago this Memorial Day weekend. Life was a lot worse. So go out and enjoy Westport’s 2 big events. They’re great. Many people have worked hard to make them happen.

After the game he said, “it was an awesome experience, an awesome day for us, and we’re ready to go [Sunday]. We’re not even close to done yet.” (Hat tip: David Goldstein)\n\n======================================================\n\nSpeaking of Staples grads: Class of 2012 alum Ellen Kempner leads Palehound, an indie rock duo. She met Melinda (who records as Jay Som) on tour\n\nThey realized they’re compatible — “two breathy-voiced songwriters whose music can be fragile or bruising, offering both vulnerability and resolve,” the New York Times‘ Jon Pareles writes — and joined forces.\n\nIn January 2020 they rented an Airbnb house for two weeks, and recorded an album. They called themselves Bachelor.\n\nIt’s been released as “Doomin’ Sun.” Pareles says:\n\nKempner and Duterte brought out the best in each other. In the songs they wrote together, satisfaction often stays just out of reach. They look at desire, estrangement, insecurity, pop fandom, shoplifting and, in the album’s title song, climate change. And they sing like sisters who know each other’s secrets.\n\nClick here for the full Times story.

I started to collect them to add my stash to hers, then thought nothing more about it.\n\n“With all the wine consumption in Westport, there are surely lots of corks. I wonder how to put out the word that Westport would benefit from having its own collection partners. Maybe a liquor store wants to take this project on?\n\n“There is a shipping cost to the partner, but perhaps they could collect a nominal fee ($1) with each bag dropped off to defray their cost.\n\n“Westport’s composting program has taken off remarkably well. This could be another successful step toward helping our environment.”\n\nAny takers?

All seniors will be together, and will be allotted 2 guests each. The ceremony will be livestreamed, for family and friends who cannot attend.\n\nThis is the first time the football stadium has been used for graduation in 27 years. The previous 26 events were held in the fieldhouse. Last year’s graduation was a “drive-by,” with each graduate having a special moment in front of the school.\n\n=======================================================\n\nThis past year has been a tough one for everyone. Moms — as they so often do — have borne much of the brunt of the pandemic.\n\nSo Dream Spa & Salon wants this Mother’s Day to be extra special.\n\nThey’re giving away 3 prizes to “superhero” moms: a “wakeup call” ($375 value), “dream essentials” ($180), and “dream feet pedi” ($65).\n\nTo win a “dreamy” gift for your mom (or spouse), follow @dreamspasalon on Instagram.

Let’s hope no one was inside at the time.\n\n=======================================================\n\nJazz returns to MoCA Westport in a big way.\n\nTalent from the Jazz at Lincoln Center Emerging Artist Spotlight kicks off Friday, May 14 (7 p.m.), with pianist/composer Isaiah J. Thompson.

So will the Greater New York Hospital Association.\n\nAnd … Westport’s own Avi Kaner.\n\nThe co-owner of Morton Williams Supermarkets (and former Board of Finance chair and 2nd selectman) will be cited for the work his family-owned business did during the pandemic.\n\nMorton Williams stores never closed. Employees kept working; senior executives ensured that the supply chain continued.\n\nThe company became a lifeline to New York. They worked with the CDC to adjust trucking regulations so that truckers would be comfortable making deliveries. They were among the first in the nation to set aside special hours for seniors and immunocompromised customers; they lobbied aggressively for mask use, and ensured that supermarket workers were included in phase 1B of the state’s vaccinations.\n\nThere’s one more Westport connection to the May 10 event: Rabbi Jeremy Wiederhorn of The Conservative Synagogue is president of the New York Board of Rabbis.\n\n=======================================================\n\nBusiness Networking International does exactly what its name says.\n\nBut there’s a twist: Only one person per profession is allowed to join a chapter. For example, there is one CPA, one architect, one insurance agent.\n\nBNI’s Westport chapter is strong and active. They’ve got 48 members. Last year, they conducted nearly $2 million in business.\n\nThere are openings now in a few categories: interior designer, home inspector, developer, heating and air conditioning contractor, fitness club or personal trainer, chef, and attorneys who practice estate and elder law.\n\nWeekly BNI meetings are now held over Zoom.

Those birds are usually eating. “The male’s chest is more white, while the female has tan markings,” she says. She took this photo of one finishing a fish.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of Y’s Men strolled past this osprey at Longshore:\n\n=======================================================\n\nFive Wreckers are Staples High School’s Students of the Month.\n\nSenior Henrik Hovstadius, junior Bruno Guiduli, sophomores Leo Fielding and Ari Lerner, and freshman Domenic Petrosinelli were nominated by their teachers.\n\nPrincipal Stafford Thomas called the honorees “the glue of the Staples community: the type of kind, cheerful, hard-working, trustworthy students who keep the high school together, making it the special place that is.\n\n=======================================================\n\nThe 2021 Music at MoCA Concert Series features a diverse range of jazz, pop and classical outdoor concerts, from April through October.

Local artist Andy Reiss will show how to create sculptures from items that would otherwise be thrown away.\n\nFor the first time, visitors can walk the farm’s new mile-long nature trail, and enjoy Lachat’s animals, woods and pond.\n\nExperts will offer advice about recycling and seed planting. They’ll also launch a new environmental initiative in Weston: a bottle bank at the transfer station to recycle glass.\n\nEvery family that attends will get a free native tree sapling to plant at home.\n\nOther Weston Earth Day events include Green Up Day (April 24, Norfield Church with Weston Kiwanis), and an online information session about recycling trends (April 29, transfer station).\n\nThroughout April, Weston Library offers recycled children’s crafts both online and as packs to pick up.

Carter Kelsey (6 innings, 12 strikeouts) and Matt Spada (1 inning, 3 strikeouts) combined for a 6-0 no-hit win over Darien. It was the Wreckers’ first game since winning the 2019 state “LL” championships.\n\nBoys lacrosse delivered a 7-3 victory over New Canaan, traditionally one of the top teams in the FCIAC league.\n\nAnd looking back at winter sports: The boys ice hockey team reached finished 8th in the state Division 3 hockey rankings. Four players earned Connecticut High School Coaches Association All-State Division 3 honors: seniors Owen Sherman and Victor Sarrazin (1st team), and senior Zachary Schwartz and sophomore Aaron Kail earned (2nd team).

We are awaiting further guidance from the state. We are currently working on procedures based on requirements.”\n\n=====================================================\n\nSpeaking of Longshore: Jackie Perrotta spotted this hardy tree — growing through a rock — near the golf course:\n\n“We gave it a tug to see if it’s real.

That’s the top 4% of the graduating class.\n\nPrincipal Stafford Thomas says, “the most astonishing aspect of this accomplishment is that these students were involved in a number of extracurricular activities and various aspects of school life, which took a great deal of time, focus and concentration outside of the classroom as well. We were lucky to have had them for 4 years. We will no doubt be hearing about their next great achievements in the years to come.”\n\nHigh Honors students are listed below, under the photos.\n\n======================================================\n\nMoCA Westport’s opening reception for its new “Smash” exhibit was — come on, this is too easy — a smash.\n\nContemporary artist Marilyn Minter’s videos are exhibited together for the first time in a public institution.\n\nThe show includes her custom-designed AMC Pacer, featuring an interior, surround viewing of her work “Green Pink Caviar” — shown for the first time ever.\n\nClick here for more information.\n\n=======================================================\n\nSpeaking of art: George Billis Gallery on Main Street announces a new show: “Cityscapes.” More than 15 artists exhibit a variety of works.\n\nOpening reception is this Friday (April 9, 4 to 7 p.m.).

Following a liturgy of Stations of the Cross, it will focus on racial justice and reconciliation. Participants will make a small loop around downtown Westport, stopping at various locations to pray and reflect.\n\n=======================================================\n\nIt’s April — and that means National Distracted Driving Month.\n\nThe Westport Police Department is joining with the Connecticut Department of Transportation Highway Safety Office in a month-long “U Drive. U Text. U Pay” campaign.\n\nSo put down your phone — this month, and every month. The first offense will cost you $150. Then it’s $300 the second time. And $500 for the third and subsequent violations.\n\nBut if it gets to that point, you shouldn’t be driving at all.\n\n=====================================================\n\nThe daffodils all along Prospect Road are blooming beautifully.\n\nAnd if you know someone who has been bullied — or helped prevent bullying — they’re yours for the taking.\n\nMelissa Ceriale — the owner, with her husband John, of an 8-acre oasis midway down the street — invites anyone who knows people in the categories above to clip a bouquet, and give it to them.\n\nNOTE: Please take them only from the roadway in front of #11, 13, 21 and 25 Prospect Road — and not from the gardens themselves!\n\n======================================================\n\nIn other nature news: Last night, a huge dead tree on the big hill at the south end of Winslow Park, not far from the North Compo parking lot, came crashing down — smack across the walking path.\n\nBob Cooper says: “I’ve had my eye on it for a couple years, but this was sooner than I expected. It appears the lower end was rotting inside.”\n\n======================================================\n\nThe Westport Youth Commission is one of our town’s great, under-the-radar groups.\n\nThirty members — 15 students, 15 adults, all appointed by the 1st selectman — meet monthly. They talk about teen needs, plan projects and programs, and (this is huge) provide high schoolers with a great experience in leadership.\n\nOf course, every year members graduate.

Political protests, Memorial Day parades, fishing — you name it, it’s happened there.\n\nThough this scene Tuesday evening was probably a first:\n\n=====================================================\n\nAquarion has announced its 2021 mandatory sprinkler irrigation schedule.\n\nThey say: “The schedule helps conserve water supplies by reducing overwatering of lawns and gardens through a maximum 2 days per week schedule. The purpose is to ensure that local water supplies remain sufficient for critical needs such as human consumption and fire protection.\n\n“Lawns and gardens can thrive on reduced watering. By encouraging roots to grow deeper into the soil, they’re able to absorb more moisture and nutrients, even during dry spells. Customers may continue using drip irrigation, soaker hoses and hand-held watering at any time.”\n\nThe schedule begins today, and is based on the last digit of your street address.\n\nIf your address ends in an even number, or you have no numbered address, you can water only on Sundays and Wednesdays, from 12:01 a.m. to 10 a.m., or 6 p.m. to midnight.\n\nIf your address ends in an odd, number, you can water only on Saturdays and Tuesdays, same times as above.\n\nFor more information, click here. NOTE: Some residents may qualify for a variance. For example, if you’ve installed new plantings or sod in the spring, you arw allowed to water more frequently to help get plants established.\n\n=======================================================\n\nMoCA Westport’s new exhibit, “Smash,” is dedicated exclusively to the videos of\n\nMarilyn Minter.\n\nIt opens to the public tomorrow (Friday, April 2).

Cribari Bridge, no one has thought about what would happen if a super tanker got caught nearby.\n\nEvan Stein has it figured out:\n\n=======================================================\n\nAnd finally … today is April 1.\n\n====================================================\n\n“Operation Varsity Blues” — the Netflix movie about the rich-and-famous college admissions scandal — has taken America by storm.\n\nThere’s a Westport angle. Thankfully, it has nothing to do with a parent pretending his or her child was a star water polo player, even if he or she cannot swim.\n\n“Operation Varsity Blues” was written and edited by Jon Karmen. He’s the 2008 Staples High School graduate who made a huge name for himself there as half of “Rubydog” — a moviemaking duo who, working with media instructor Jim Honeycutt, made a number of way-beyond-high school videos back in the day. (Click here to see some of their pioneering work.)\n\nKarmen is known too as the writer/director of “Fyre” (2019), a behind-the-scenes look at that infamous music festival.\n\n“Varsity Blues” was #3 on Netflix’s Top 10 Most Watched Movies & TV Shows yesterday. But it wasn’t the only one with an “06880” connection. Jamie Mann’s “Country Comfort” checked in at #7. (Hat tip: Kerry Long)\n\n=======================================================\n\nSpeaking of Staples: More than 60 years after helping found Staples Players, Christopher Lloyd is still acting.\n\nIn 1958 he was a Staples High School student who wanted to do more than just act in a class play. He found a mentor in English teacher Craig Matheson. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nLloyd went on to a career that includes “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” the “Back to the Future” trilogy, “Star Trek III,” “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” and 2 “Addams Family” films.\n\nAt 82 years old, he’s got a new movie: “Senior Moment.” He stars with Jean Smart and William Shatner, who play a pair of older star-crossed lovers in an old-school romcom.\n\nLloyd talks about that project; his 5 wives — and growing up in Westport — in a wide-ranging Guardian interview. He was the youngest of 8 children, though the closest in age was 7 years older. Click here for the full interview. (Hat tip: Jeff Mitchell)’\n\n======================================================\n\nSpeaking again of Staples: Staples history classes absolutely crushed the National History Day regional competition.\n\nTheir papers, documentaries and exhibits examined everything from the Daughters of the Confederacy and Queer Communications in the Age of Oppression to Crypto-Analysis in World War I, Cigarette Advertising and the Freedom Riders.\n\nHow dominant was Staples? 32 students placed. There were only 5 other winners in the entire region, from just 2 other schools.\n\nPlacing first were Ishan Prasad, Sabrina Paris, Maya Hruskar, Lilly Weisz, Srushti Karve, William Jin, Michael Nealon, Zachary Brody, Jeffrey Pogue, Jack Ginsburg, Preston Norris, Tyler Clark and Matthew Gatto.\n\nFinishing second were Nikos Ninios, Franca Strandell, Camille Vynerib, Julet Tracey, Lily Klau, Olivia Stubbs, Hannah Fiarman, Franky Lockenour, James Dobin-Smith, Coco Laska, Karlie Saed and Sarp Gurdogan.\n\nTaking third were Sebastian Miller, Analise Vega, Emma Porzio, Arda Ernamli, Hannah Conn, Samantha Paris and Ethan Cukier.\n\nTheir (superb) teachers are Drew Coyne, Nell-Ann Lynch, Cathy Schager and Kelly Zrenda.\n\nUp next: state and (hopefully) national competition.\n\nA US championship? That would be historic.\n\n=======================================================\n\nSpeaking once again of the arts: On Tuesday (March 30, 7 p.m.), the Westport Country Playhouse presents a world premiere of “New Works/New Voices.” These 4 new pieces — all written by community members — honor women who inspired them: Constance Baker Motley, Anne Bogart, Mary Freeman, Mary McLeod Bethune and Gloria Steinem.\n\nLocal storytellers and actors will bring to life these very personal, beautiful stories recorded on the WCP stage.\n\nViewers are invited to pay what they can. 50% of ticket sales and donations during the broadcast go to the Playhouse’s community partner, Women’s Mentoring Network, providing career, educational and personal resources for the economic empowerment of low-income women and their families.\n\nClick here to register for “New Works/New Voices.”\n\n=======================================================\n\nWestporter Rob Simmelkjaer was confirmed yesterday, by a bipartisan State Senate vote, as chair of the Connecticut Lottery.\n\nIt’s a volunteer — but quite active — role he’s served in since May. Area senators Will Haskell and Bob Duff spoke warmly on the media executive’s behalf.\n\n======================================================\n\nUpdate from Parks & Rec: The concession stand at Compo Beach will open in mid-April. Last year, during COVID, it opened late, and ran only from a trailer adjacent to the brick building.\n\n=======================================================\n\nMoCA Westport has added 5 members to its board of directors. Two are from Westport.\n\nJennifer Kanfer has served on the board of The Conservative Synagogue, including co-chair of the Social Action, Membership and Fundraising Committees. and with the Coleytown Elementary School PTA. She previously worked in healthcare communications for 14 years. She holds a BA in political science from the University of Michigan, an MPA in healthcare policy and administration from NYU, and an MBA in Finance from NYU’s Stern School.\n\nSamantha Yanks is an award-winning editor with over 20 years experience in luxury fashion and lifestyle publishing.

She graduated from Tulane University.\n\n=======================================================\n\n‘Tis the season — for both holiday lights and daffodils.\n\n======================================================\n\nAnd finally … the great — and greatly underrated — Billy Stewart was born today, in 1937. He died in 1970, only 32 years old.\n\nIf you only have time to listen to one song, it’s “Summertime.” But everything he touched was a classic.\n\n==================================================\n\nSlowly, the Westport Library is moving back toward pre-pandemic operations.\n\nEffective April 5, users will enjoy:\n\nExpanded operating hours. The building will be open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It will continue to close on Sundays.\n\nLimited seating at socially distanced tables in the Trefz Forum and on the Mezzanine.\n\nMasks will still be required, and 6-foot social distancing remains in place.\n\nPrinting will be available for people working in the Library and remotely.\n\nChildren’s Library occupancy will continue to be limited. Patrons are encouraged to make an appointment.\n\nThe Café will be opened for limited service between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.\n\nAppointments will still be required for the Maker Space and Verso Studios, but are no longer necessary for the Library Store.\n\nThe Library will resume collecting fines owed prior to the pandemic.\n\n======================================================\n\nWakeman Town Farm’s new partnership with Homefront Farmers is already bearing fruit.\n\nThe Redding-based organic group building a special teaching garden onsite at the Cross Highway farm.\n\nOn April 6 (7 p.m.), Homefront Farmers’ experts will lead a Zoom session about vegetable garden design, how to extend your growing season with succession planning, organic pest management, and the joys of growing organic food.

Starting April 3, Homefront Farmers will donate all proceeds from gift card sales purchased through @payitfwrd.co directly to WTF.\n\nMeanwhile, this Monday, there’s a (non-Homefront Farmers-sponsored) Pollinator Pathway talk.\n\nUniversity of Connecticut advanced master gardener Alice Ely will teach Zoom participants how to plant for a continuous season of bloom, with abundant blossoms for pollinators (and people!) to enjoy. Click here to register.\n\n=======================================================\n\nAfter 9 light-hearted young readers’ books — the “Charlie Joe Jackson” and “Crimebiters” series — Tommy Greenwald turned serious.\n\n“Game Changer” was a no-holds-barred look at youth football culture. There was not a laugh to be had. But it sure made people think.\n\nCritics loved it. And the American Literacy Association named it one of 2019’s Top 10 books for reluctant readers.\n\nNext up for the Westport writer (who, like his wife and 3 sons, is a Staples High School graduate): “Rivals.” A companion book to “Game Changer,” this one focuses on basketball.\n\nThe book explores the journeys of two 8th graders, Carter and Austin, as they navigate the pressures and pleasures of starring on their middle school teams, while an intrepid school sports reporter uncovers scandals that threaten to derail their season.\n\nIt’s told through a series of flashbacks, newspaper reports, social media posts and interviews — of course, in Tommy’s unique style.

The 13 performances — jazz, pop and classical — take place on Fridays, from April through October.\n\nThree jazz concerts will again feature performers from the Jazz at Lincoln Center Emerging Artist Spotlight series.

She was 81.\n\nDylanologists have spent decades deciphering the artifacts in that photo. Among them — smack in the middle, and of special interest to “06880” readers — is “The Folk Blues of Eric von Schmidt.”\n\nVon Schmidt is one of the most interesting Westporters I’ve ever known. The son of famed artist Harold von Schmidt, Eric was both a revered folk singer and a very accomplished artist.\n\nHis Evergreen Avenue studio was a magical place. He died in 2007. Tragically, cancer of the larynx had taken his voice. Click here for a fond remembrance.\n\nBack to Dylan. On his first album in 1962, the singer introduced “Baby Let Me Follow You Down” this way:\n\n“I first heard it from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick’s a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.”\n\nIn May 1964, Dylan visited von Schmidt at his then-home in Sarasota, Florida. Dylan recorded several songs there, including an early version of “Mr. Tambourine Man.” They were released in 2014 as part of Dylan’s “50th Anniversary Collection 1964.”\n\nAnd in 1969, Dylan gave one more hat tip — literally — to Eric von Schmidt. Check out the cover of his “Nashville Skyline” album:\n\nSo what are we waiting for? Take it away, Bob!"
