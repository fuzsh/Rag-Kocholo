        "text": "Susan Lemay was born Daisy Cooper in September of 1987 to teenage parents Harley Cooper and Dylan Lewis. Her birth, and subsequent adoption, would impact Harley for the rest of her life. Susan Lemay did not have the easiest early life, in fact her childhood could be described as somewhat “traumatic”. She had a life threatening illness, she was kidnapped (twice), the only mother she had ever known died of cancer, and then her father died in a fire.\n\n1. Brittany Slatterly : (August 1989-October 1989; March-April 1995) Daisy made her way into the world on the side of the highway when her mother Harley was involved in a car accident on the way to Cedars hospital. Harley named the baby Daisy after the flower Dylan used to bring her. A teenager, Harley was unable to take care of young Daisy and put her up for adoption. Daisy’s adoptive parents Jim and Connie Lemay would rename her Susan. In 1989 Susan’s biological father Dylan learned he had a daughter and convinced Harley to reclaim their child. Dylan and Samantha Marler worked as Susan’s nannies unbeknownst to the Lemays, which granted Harley access to her daughter. Harley’s then-husband Alan-Michael attempted to buy Susan from the Lemays but was refused. Alan-Michael retaliated by revealing the true identity of Dylan to the Lemays. As a result Harley’s only connection to her child was severed and placed a great strain on her marriage to Alan-Michael. In an attempt to hold on to Harley Alan-Michael kidnapped young Susan and made plans for them to leave the country. Harley refused and returned Susan to her adoptive parents who then moved away from Springfield. In 1994, Connie Lemay revealed to Dylan that an eight-year old Susan had contracted a rare form of diabetes. She convinced Dylan to donate part of his pancreas to Susan in a life-threatening surgery. The procedure was a success and young Susan recovered yet the Lemays barred Dylan from seeing his daughter.

Brittany Snow (December 1998 to March 2001; May 2001) In 1998 Connie Lemay died of cancer and a distraught Susan ran away from home in order to find Harley. Susan begged Harley and her then-husband Phillip Spaulding to not return her to her father. When Jim Lemay arrived to collect his daughter Harley convinced him to let Susan stay in Springfield for the holidays. Susan plotted to get Harley’s full attention and faked an illness in January 1999 in order to prolong her stay in Springfield. Susan’s real plan was to bring Harley and her father Jim together, however her matchmaking plans failed. Phillip urged his wife to let Susan and Jim live their own lives. When Harley became pregnant a hurt Susan left town. However Susan later reached out to Harley and mother and daughter continued to keep in contact without Phillip and Jim’s knowledge. In February 1999, Susan called Harley from the bus station after being accused of shoplifting. When Phillip and Jim arrived they argued about Harley’s intervention in Susan’s life. Because Harley and Susan refused to part Phillip suggested Jim love to Springfield and even offered him a position at Spaulding Enterprises. Not long after, the Nursery Rhyme Stalker, Holly Reade, kidnapped Susan along with other Springfield children. Susan and the children escaped but were caught again by Holly. They would eventually be rescued by Susan’s grandmother Reva Lewis. Susan tried to play on Harley’s jealousy by getting close to Phillip’s ex-wife, Beth Raines. Phillip overheard Susan asking questions about miscarriages and he warned a pregnant Harley that Susan could be dangerous. Jim threatened to leave town over Phillip’s accusations, but Harley and Beth persuaded Phillip to convince Jim to stay in Springfield. In the spring on 1999 Susan befriended a boy named Max Nickerson. Susan and Max sneaked into Buzz’s new restaurant to make dinner. Max dropped a cigarette on the floor, setting the diner ablaze. Though both were rescued the restaurant was destroyed. When Susan learned that Jim and Beth were going on a business trip to the Bahamas, Susan hoped that lacing Beth’s drink would cause Beth to miss her flight. However Susan drank it herself and in daze jumped into the lake. A Jim and Harley planned to send Susan to a camp for trouble teens, Susan and Max attempted to run away together. Susan and Max reconciled their friendship when they both wound up in the camp for troubled teens. Later, Jim and Susan talked their problems through, and Jim took her home. Susan apologized to Beth, but continued to disapprove of Beth’s relationship with Jim. Susan traveled to San Cristobel with Beth, Jim, Phillip, and Harley for Thanksgiving with Cassie and Prince Richard Winslow. Phillip and Beth needed to return home for business, and Jim agreed to fly them in a private jet. The jet crashed, but the three were eventually rescued. In January 2000, Susan and Max found Beth’s prenatal vitamins, and realized that Beth was pregnant. Soon after, it was revealed that Phillip, not Jim, was the baby’s father however Jim and Beth married despite Susan’s suspicions. Susan began to act out, even getting involved in Sam Spencer’s pirating CDs. Then tragedy struck for Susan once again when her father Jim Lemay died in a fire saving Lizzie and James Spaulding. Susan grew more distant from Harley and became increasingly close to Beth. Feeling out-of-place in Springfield Susan eventually went away to boarding school. Brittany Snow was great at portraying a teenage Susan Lemay. Susan Lemay had faced numerous heart breaks in her young life but there was a “realness” to the character. She was very much a teenager for she would dance and sing along to songs on the radio and her room was cluttered with Backstreet Boy posters. And Brittany Snow was fabulous at portraying those pesky teenage emotions, like Susan’s crush on Max to her jealousy over her father’s relationship with Beth as well as her overwhelming grief at losing her father. And though she had a tendency to be manipulative it was very “Harleyesque” for when Harley was a teenager she was a bit of a wild child herself. Susan and Max’s House Party. Christmas 1999.
