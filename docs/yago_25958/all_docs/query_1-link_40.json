        "text": "During the years where The Guiding Light was both on the radio and on television, the same Cast had to broadcast the show twice per day!\n\nThe series' title, \"The Guiding Light\" is a reference to a lamp in the window of Reverend John Ruthledge who was a main character when the series first aired on the radio. It \"guided\" the residents of Five Points, Illinois to the place where they could get help in times of trouble.\n\nThe Guiding Light's setting didn't remain in the fictional Chicago suburb of Five Points, Illinois forever. In 1947 it moved to the fictional Los Angeles suburb of Selby Flats, California and in 1966 to Sprinfield, Illinois.\n\nThe show was also broadcast from three different locations over its lifetime. From Chicago, Illinois (1937-1946); Hollywood, California (1947-1949) and New York City after that till the series' end.\n\nMany actors got their starts in show business with parts on TV series and soap operas were no exception. Some big names who appeared on The Guiding Light include Kevin Bacon, Joseph Campanella (\"The Colbys\"), Blythe Danner (\"Huff\"), Calista Flockhart (\"Brothers and Sisters\"), Allison Janney (\"The West Wing\"), James Earl Jones (\"Gabriel's Fire\"), Hayden Pannettiere (\"Heroes\"), Jimmy Smits (\"LA Law\"), Cicely Tyson (\"East Side/West Side\"), Christopher Walken (7 times host of \"Saturday Night Live\"), Billy Dee Williams, and JoBeth Williams (\"Payne\").\n\nThe Guiding Light is the only series that was aired on all three major networks ... kind of. It began on NBC in 1937. In 1946 NBC split into two networks called \"NBC Red\" and \"NBC Blue\" and the show was broadcast on both networks. The Blue nework eventually became ABC. Then, in 1947, CBS picked up the series when it was canceled on NBC.\n\nThe Guiding Light had a real struggle to remain on the air so long. The ratings eventually dropped to a point where NBC wanted to cancel it. This was especially true during and after World War II when women joined the workplace in huge numbers. They weren't home to listen in anymore! But the Guiding Light's hardcore fans wouldn't hear of it! Tremendous numbers of complaint letters were sent to NBC when they threatened to cancel the show in 1939, 1941, 1942, 1944 and 1946! Then in 1947, a brand new CBS TV network happily bought the series and the rest is history!\n\nJust as with many other TV shows that aired prior to the invention of videotape in 1956, many early episodes of The Guiding Light are lost forever. Some were recorded on \"kinescopes\". Kinescopes were 16mm films that were sometimes placed right next to the TV camera that was broadcasting the show live. These were often used to re-broadcast the show at a later time on the West Coast due to time zone differences. Most producers saw no reason to archive TV shows at that time. After all, who would want to rewatch a show that had already aired? Little did they realize that cable TV, video tape sales, and dvds would someday provide a huge market for archived shows.\n\nThe Guiding Light soap opera aired in black and white until September 11, 1967 when the first color episode aired."
