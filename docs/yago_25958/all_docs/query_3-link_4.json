        "text": "- Parents: Nadine (deceased) and Buzz Cooper\n\n- Named Harley Davidson Cooper by Nadine because Harley Davidson motorcycles are Buzz's favorite\n\nPast Harley's:\n\n- Beth Ehlers originated the role; September 1987 to September 28th, 1993; January 21st to January 30th, 1997; May 29th, 1997 to June 23rd, 2008\n\n- Temporary replacements: Amy Carlson (filled in November 9th through 12, 1998) and Hayley Sparks (filled in during Ehlers' maternity leaves; May 5th, to July 30th, 1999; July 18th to August 3rd, 2001; August 25th and 26th, 2002)\n\nMajor Events:\n\n- Grew up in the wrong side of Springfield's 5th Street and was raised by her older brother, Frank\n\n- At age 17 got pregnant with Daisy\n\n- On her way to the hospital to give birth in late 1987, the car a 17-year Harley was riding in with Frank was hit by a motorcycle being driven by Alan-Michael and Dinah Marler\n\n- Harley's daughter was delivered by Dinah\n\n- She decided to give her up for adoption\n\n- Became friends with Dinah while Alan-Michael hated her and tried all he could to make her life miserable\n\n- Began dating Cameron Stewart and lied to him by claiming to be a virgin\n\n- When Cam learned about Daisy, he was disturbed that she lied to him and broke things off\n\n- Harley and Alan-Michael formulated a plan to make some quick money in 1988: they'd marry so that he could collect his trust fund\n\n- Nadine returned to town and tried to reunite with Harley but it took Harley a long time to forgive her mother for leaving the family\n\n- Alan-Michael’s brother, Phillip tried to seduce her in order to break up the relationship but he was unsuccessful, and ended up growing to respect her\n\n- They became friends and Phillip taught Harley how to act as a Spaulding\n\n- Harley and Alan-Michael got married in February 1989, thanks to Phillip and Alex, Alan-Michael didn't succeed in collecting his trust fund, and he and Harley worked at the Diner and eventually fell in love\n\n- Dylan (Harley’s baby daddy) came to town\n\n- When he learned about Daisy, he got a job at the Lemay's, the family that had adopted the child and renamed her Susan\n\n- Dylan convinced Harley that Susan belonged to them, so she and Alan-Michael offered the Lemay’s a large sum of money to give her back to them\n\n- It was a failed attempt and when Alan-Michael told the Lemay’s about Dylan's true identity, a furious Harley wanted to leave him and even slept with Dylan\n\n- Alan-Michael kidnapped Susan to hold on to Harley while Dylan was accused of the kidnapping\n\n- Harley decided to bring Susan back and once again had to accept life without her daughter\n\n- Harley was again in love with Dylan, she was crushed when he told her that he really loved his girlfriend, Samantha Marler\n\n- Harley schemed to win Dylan back but didn't succeed\n\n- In January 1990 while Harley falsely thought she was pregnant by Dylan, Alan-Michael learned that she was in love with Dylan and threw her out of their house\n\n- Harley came to the decision to divorce Alan-Michael and make a lot of money in the process by proving he had cheated on her (she didn’t know it at the time, but it was with Blake)\n\n- She set up a video camera in his apartment and recorded a video of the two in bed but the tape was stolen by Gary Swanson who would later blackmail Blake with it\n\n- Harley and Alan-Michael considered reconciliation when Harley suspected she might be pregnant\n\n- Then the videotape happened to show up at Alan-Michael's apartment, but it was severely doctored to show Harley faking her pregnancy test\n\n- Alan-Michael forced Harley to have a second pregnancy test and this one came back negative and they went through with their divorce\n\n- Harley took a job as a nanny for Josh and Reva Lewis' children, Marah and Shayne\n\n- Though Josh didn't like that idea, Reva (who was depressed after the birth of her second child), convinced him\n\n- While accompanying them on family vacation to Florida, Harley promised Reva that she would take care of her children if something happened to her\n\n- A few days later, Reva drove her car off of a bridge and was presumed dead\n\n- Harley did her best, after some struggle with herself, to care for Marah and Shayne, while trying to comfort a grieving Josh but he fired her when she mentioned Reva's death\n\n- Realizing he had acted rash in his decision, Josh asked Harley to come back to work for him\n\n- Harley became determined to force Josh to let his wife go, and burned all of Reva's clothes\n\n- Furious at first, Josh lashed out at Harley, they argued passionately and ended up making love\n\n- Harley remained convinced that Josh was still in love with Reva and left, taking a job with Mindy Lewis selling her clothing designs\n\n- This took her to New York and Josh, realizing he couldn't live without her, followed her and the two became engaged\n\n- Part of her dream wedding to Josh included a dream honeymoon, so Harley purchased some travel videos and while watching one, Josh’s brother, Billy, and Sarah (Reva’s mother) noticed a woman in the background that looked exactly like Reva\n\n- Josh was determined to ignore it, but after a while though, his feelings for his \"late\" wife overcame him\n\n- He told Harley that, although he loved her with all his heart but he had to go to see if Reva was in fact alive\n\n- Though Josh stated that he would only stay briefly in Italy, he later wrote a letter to Harley and left her while he let his children and Sarah follow him to Italy\n\n- Harley pretended to understand, but was left heartbroken and then began working for Alan-Michael and created a password for Spaulding's accounts that only Alan-Michael knew\n\n- Harley was drugged by John Davis, a friend of Roger Thorpe and revealed the password, enabling Roger to embezzle money from Spaulding\n\n- Alan-Michael and Blake accused her of corporate espionage, Harley couldn't remember anything and was soon able to prove that she'd been drugged and had Davies arrested\n\n- Harley discovered the corrupt cops Hutchins and Murry who were demanding protection money from the 5th Street barkeeper\n\n- The cops arrested Harley for prostitution to get her to keep quiet, but Harley was able to expose the corruption and the cops by filming them in action\n\n- Harley decides to become a police officer and enrolls in the academy at the Springfield Police Department with Det. A.C. Mallet as her instructor\n\n- Though hard on Harley at first, in time she impressed him and they secretly fell in love with each other\n\n- Found out Daniel St. John killed Jean Weatherill, tried to warn Holly and got locked in a root cellar\n\n- Mallet rescued Harley, who was suffering from hypothermia\n\n- As he lay in a sleeping bag with her to keep her warm, a delirious Harley said she was in love with him\n\n- Moved in with Mallet\n\n- Attempted to catch Jenna Bradshaw (a jewel thief) by working undercover as her assistant\n\n- They were very happy until Mallet was injured by a bomb and lost his hearing\n\n- Mallet tried to leave Harley but she supported him and gave him a hearing dog as a present\n\n- Kidnapped when she accidentally found Pierre hiding into the Spaulding stables\n\n- Mallet found out that he also might be sterile as a result of his injuries and again tried to leave Harley, but she found out the real reason he was leaving and talked him into staying\n\n- Harley and Mallet get engaged\n\n- Harley and Mallet decided to take a vacation and visit the Vietnam Memorial in January 1993. Searching for her father's name, she was confused when it wasn't there.\n\n- Harley soon found out that her father hadn't died in the war, he was alive and in Springfield\n\n- She wanted nothing to do with Buzz until he threw her and Mallet a surprise wedding, then while on a honeymoon in the Florida Keys, Mallet received a job offer and they decided to move to Florida\n\n- In January 1997, Harley visited Springfield for the 60th anniversary of the founding of Cedars Hospital but soon left town\n\n- Months later, Harley returned to town to investigate Jenna who had mysteriously gone back to her husband, Jeffrey Morgan\n\n- She locked Jenna in a non-working freezer to get information and Jenna was forced to admit that admit that Jeffrey was forcing her to go back to him\n\n- Harley offered to help her get rid of him by acting as a swindler named Starla Russo\n\n- Phillip accidentally met Harley during her act in the Country Club, he was very intrigued and offered to help\n\n- Phillip and Harley started having feelings for one another\n\n- The pair left for New York to trap Jeffrey, making it seem like \"Starla\" was going to get money from Phillip\n\n- They acted as though she was trying to seduce him, proving it by showing Jeffrey a surveillance tape of Phillip and Starla \"making love.\"\n\n- Once the camera was shut off, the fake lovemaking became real as Phillip and Harley gave in to their passion\n\n- Phillip lied to Jeffrey stating that he killed Harley during wild sex and when Jeffrey was ready to turn him to the police and to flee with Jenna, he was arrested for fraud when Harley and Jenna exposed him\n\n- Harley and Phillip agreed to forget about that happened that night and remain just friends\n\n- Harley and Jenna decided to join forces and began a detective agency, with their first assignment being to help Reva to find her long-lost sister\n\n- Harley received a call from Mallet telling her that he wanted a divorce since he was in love with another woman and she was consoled by Philip\n\n- Jenna and Harley learned that Reva's nemesis, Annie Dutton, may have information on Reva's sister, and so they went to the mental hospital where Annie was staying\n\n- Security caught them snooping around, Jenna passed Harley off as her sister, Caitlin, and, to Harley's dismay, checked her into the mental institution\n\n- \"Caitlin\" then became Annie's roommate and apparently befriended her. Although Phillip tried to get Harley out of there, Harley was determined to follow through with the plan.\n\n- Annie discovered who her new \"friend\" was and with help of the guards, drugged Harley with a psychotic drug\n\n- Phillip came to her rescue and admitted that he too was falling in love with her\n\n- When Phillip's ex-wife, Beth, returned to town with their daughter Lizzie, Beth was determined to win back her ex and wasn't happy to find him now sharing his life with Harley\n\n- Phillip tried to assure Harley that his heart belonged to her, Harley couldn't quite be sure\n\n- In 1998, Phillip proved his love for Harley by asking her to move in with him. Elated, Harley accepted the offer but was still disconcerted over the bond Phillip and Beth shared\n\n- Their relationship took a step back when Beth attempted suicide by throwing herself in front of a car\n\n- Guilt-ridden, Phillip offered to stay at the mansion to take care of a rattled Lizzie\n\n- Harley got suspicious and starting investigating Beth's past in Arizona, finding out about Carl\n\n- Carl, upon learning that Harley was asking about him, arrived in town threatening Harley to stay out of his business\n\n- Although Carl denied hurting Beth, Harley is soon able to trick him into admitting it and she convinced Beth to help her arrest Carl\n\n- Using Beth as bait, the plan was for Harley to tape record Carl admitting his abusiveness but Harley, realizing that she forgot her gun, left the scene before Carl got there\n\n- When she returned, Carl was dead and Beth was the prime suspect\n\n- When Beth confessed to killing Carl in self-defense, both Harley and Phillip were unconvinced and investigated further. They soon discovered that the true killer was Phillip's daughter, Lizzie!\n\n- Harley left Phillip so that he could be with his daughter in her time of need but he wouldn’t have it\n\n- Phillip proposed, Harley happily accepted and the couple made plans to marry\n\n- Trouble began to brew again with the arrival of Harley's daughter Daisy, now called Susan, who was in search of her real mother now that her adoptive mother had passed away\n\n- Susan manipulated Harley into letting her stay and tried to get her father and Harley together\n\n- As Phillip and Harley debated about Susan's presence in their lives, Harley learned that she was pregnant\n\n- After learning of Harley's pregnancy, a hurt Susan left Springfield to live with Jim but later corresponded with Harley by phone\n\n- Later, Susan called Harley asking for help after she shoplifted a dress, telling her she was at a strange bus station outside Springfield\n\n- Harley arrived at the bus station outside of Springfield to collect Susan and a creepy man who had been eying Susan turned his attention to Harley\n\n- The two of them struggled, and Harley managed to kick him in the groin. Meanwhile, Jim arrived and flattened the perpetrator\n\n- When Phillip showed up, he and Jim argued about Harley's involvement in Susan's life with Jim complaining that Susan was envious of the life that Phillip and Harley lead\n\n- Phillip offered to solve the problem by moving the two of them to Springfield and gave Jim a job at Spaulding\n\n- That summer, Harley finally gave birth to a son, who was named Alan Cooper Spaulding, with Harley deciding to nickname him \"Zach\" after the lead in Phillip's novel\n\n- Things couldn't have been better when Harley and her new family agreed to join her best friend, Cassie Layne, and her new fiancé, Prince Richard for a Thanksgiving celebration in San Cristobel\n\n- After the celebration, Phillip, Beth and Jim were forced to leave early for business reasons, unfortunately, their plane crashed into the mountains\n\n- All three were o.k., but Jim opted to leave and brave the cold on his own in an attempt to bring help back, while alone on the plane Philip and Beth made love\n\n- In early 2000, Lizzie was stricken with leukemia and needed the marrow from Beth’s baby to save her, when Jim, who believed he was the father declined, Philip announced that he was the father\n\n- Though relieved that the child could save Lizzie, Harley refused to forgive Phillip and asked him for a divorce. Though she tried to forgive Philip and give their marriage another try, she was still insecure about his friendship with Beth and decided that she could no longer trust him.\n\n- The ending of her marriage devastated Harley and to help her get over the divorce, her family threw her a \"divorce party\" in 2001\n\n- Then after all the men had passed out, Harley went upstairs and cried. The next thing she knew, Rick was by her side trying to comfort her. Harley and Rick kissed then made love.\n\n- Harley then had to contend with the arrival of FBI agent, Gus Aitoro who began working with her to help his investigation of Springfield mob families\n\n- Harley realized she was pregnant with Rick’s baby\n\n- Throughout her pregnancy, the one person whose sensitivity surprised her was Gus' and she found herself having feelings for him\n\n- Near the end of her pregnancy, Harley was stopped for speeding in a little town called Brewster's Point and was thrown into the town's one-person jail\n\n- She tried to call Rick but somehow there was a mix-up and Gus wound up taking the call\n\n- Gus went to Brewster's Point and Harley suddenly started having contractions in the empty police station and Harley informed him that he'd have to deliver her baby\n\n- Gus tried to get Harley out of the cell and ended up getting himself locked in the cell with her\n\n- Rick, who figured out the phone mishap, found them and although he couldn't get in the cell, he talked Gus through the delivery\n\n- Gus and Harley's attraction to each other had grown, and Gus found it difficult to get Harley out of his mind\n\n- Knowing that Harley was considering going into a loveless marriage with Rick, Gus tried to dissuade her and later set her up to see Rick in an embrace with the woman he loved, Mel Boudreau\n\n- Unfortunately, Harley learned about the set-up and, after denying that she had any feelings for Gus, she kicked him out of her house\n\n- Gus was finding himself very attracted to Harley. Touched that she'd care so much about him to be angry, he decided to stay\n\n- Despite everything she told everyone, including herself, Harley couldn't deny her feelings for Gus\n\n- Harley was determined to marry Rick so that they could be a family but she and Gus were unable to deny their feelings\n\n- Gus decided to make a change and joined the Springfield Police force--where Harley ended up being his supervisor and kept her distance\n\n- In 2002, while investigating the Tory Granger case, she gave into her passion. This culminated in a hotel room nearly burning down and Harley and Gus being arrested as they made out in a car\n\n- After Gus dropped his vendetta against Danny Santos in order to be a better man for Harley, touched by his efforts to change, Harley opened herself up to Gus\n\n- Gus’ past juvenile conviction was unveiled and he told Harley that he had been jailed for pushing a man off the roof, but that he was actually taking the blame for a girl, Eden\n\n- When Phillip learned Gus was still living with her and helping raise children with her, he was livid. He took Zach and planned to file for sole custody\n\n- Harley broke into the mansion, only to be caught as she attempted flee with her son. She was jailed and suspended from the force pending a hearing.\n\n- When Gus refused to tell Phillip or the police of his covering up for Eden, she threw him out of her house\n\n- Harley decided to go look for Eden herself, believing this was her only real chance to clear her name as well as Gus'\n\n- Harley tracked grifter Eden down, and when Eden refused to help clear Gus' name, Harley handcuffed herself to her and dragged her back to Springfield\n\n- Harley learned that Eden was Gus's sister and Gus had taken the blame because he had sworn to his father, Joe, whom he idolized and who was shot and killed by the Santos family when both Gus and Eden were kids, that he would always protect Eden\n\n- When Eden learned from Phillip that she would probably go to jail if she claimed to have pushed the man off the roof, she not only blamed Gus for this crime, she also falsely accused him of beating her! The arbiter granted full custody to Phillip, and Harley swore vengeance on Eden\n\n- Harley, disgusted by what Gus had brought into her life, broke up with him in order to have a better chance at seeing Zach.\n\n- Harley’s heart belonged with Gus and she was unable to stay apart from him\n\n- She was still in a custody dispute with Phillip, although she did manage to get her badge back\n\n- Gus and Harley learned that Gus was Alan Spaulding’s son\n\n- Gus proposed to Harley, and she accepted\n\n- Harley opens Harley’s Angels with Blake and Mel\n\n- The evening before their wedding, Harley was shocked to find out that Alexandra had been involved in a drug selling operation and Gus stepped in and demanded that Harley back off his family\n\n- Wanting to give Gus, whom she was convinced knew nothing about Alex, the wedding he deserved, Harley agreed, but later demanded that Alexandra break up with Buzz to spare him the pain she’ll undoubtedly cause him once he learned the truth\n\n- The day of the wedding, Frank would stumble across a security tape that proved that not only was Alexandra involved, but Gus knew about it\n\n- Gus begged her for forgiveness but Harley would hear none of it and called off the wedding\n\n- Weeks later, still reeling from Gus's betrayal, Harley was shocked to learn that Phillip was planning to demolish Company!\n\n- Desperate to stop Phillip, Harley went to the one Spaulding she thought would help her, Gus.\n\n- The two got close and Harley admitted that she still loved him and stated that if he disowned his family, they could have a future but Gus was unwilling. Harley returned his ring and the pair went their separate ways\n\n- Harley was incredulous to learn that Gus was working as legal counsel (thus helping Phillip to destroy Company), Gus tried to reassure Harley that although he couldn't stop Phillip, he could stall the proceedings in order to give the Coopers more time to stop him\n\n- Meanwhile, due to all of this stress, Buzz suffered a heart attack and while being wheeled into surgery asked Harley to forgive Gus. Although Harley agreed, to Gus's disappointment, she only said it to make her father feel better. As Buzz was wheeled into surgery, Harley was disappointed to learn that Gus had slipped away to attend to Spaulding business (unaware that he was trying to stop Company's immediate destruction).\n\n- Harley still had to deal with Phillip and knowing that Bill Lewis was out to knock down the powerful Spaulding family, she offered to help\n\n- She and Bill then concocted an audacious plan that would get her on the inside track at Spaulding. Disguising herself as a middle aged, frumpy woman (complete with wig & fake nose) named Ruth Karloff, Harley and Bill set up a scene in front of Phillip where he'd see Bill pleading with his assistant \"Ruth\" to stay on the job. As expected, \"Ruth's\" directness impressed Phillip and he hired her as his own assistant.\n\n- Over the course of several weeks, \"Ruth\" made herself indispensable to Phillip, while her unfailing loyalty helped Phillip feel secure. Although she almost succeeded in breaking into Phillip's briefcase to get a look at his files, she was almost caught by Phillip. Luckily, she was able to come up with a good excuse as to how Phillip's briefcase broke and he remained oblivious.\n\n- Harley unknowingly sent out a fax speeding up Company's destruction, thankfully, Phillip’s plans were foiled when it was discovered that the area was a nesting place for a rare bird. Angry that he'd lost, Phillip vindictively tore down Harley's house. Furious, Harley confronted Phillip who told her that Gus was aware of what he'd done.\n\n- Phillip arranged for a man to run \"Ruth\" down! Luckily for Harley, Gus saved her life and in the process, discovered that Harley was Ruth! To her surprise, Gus agreed to keep her secret.\n\n- Phillip made off with all his children and asked several people to meet him at Company at 9pm, telling each person that if they came, and told no one else of the meeting, their children would be returned to them. At 9pm, the various citizens of Springfield converged at Company to find Phillip shot!\n\n- Although he was rushed to the hospital, it was too late and Phillip was declared dead. But Gus was concerned because one person was not there at the scene--Harley!\n\n- That same night, Harley, dressed as Ruth, came to Company. However, she was dazed, disheveled, and apparently had been in a scuffle. Having no memory of that night, all she could remember was a scuffle with Phillip and a gun.\n\n- Suspecting that Buzz killed Phillip, Harley decided to protect her father. Despite Gus's misgivings, Harley came up with a plan to protect Buzz---frame \"Ruth\" for Phillip's murder.\n\n- Harley them came up with the plan to, disguised as Ruth, tape a confession and then stage a suicide. After learning from Frank that Ruth was spotted on the bridge. Gus rushed to the scene. At the same time, Frank arrived, yelled for \"Ruth\" to surrender.\n\n- Panicked, Harley tried to run and she lost her footing and went over the bridge. As the police searched for Ruth on the rocks below the bridge, Gus found Harley hidden on a beam under the bridge.\n\n- Harley pleaded with Gus to help cover for her and say he saw the body washed away by the current. Days later, on Christmas, Gus and Harley unexpectedly shared a kiss while putting Zach's star atop the tree at Christmas.\n\n- Frank arrested Harley--he recognized her on \"Ruth's videotape. As Gus passionately defended her, Harley agreed to go down to the station with Frank. After kissing her again, Gus swore he'd find the real killer.\n\n- Harley was found guilty of killing Phillip and sentenced to 25 years\n\n- Determined to be near the woman he loved, Gus bought an apartment right next to the prison, a prospect that horrified Harley since she wanted him to get on with his life.\n\n- Now incarcerated, Harley met her new cellmate, Lena, and the warden--Mallet! Alone, Mallet tried to apologize for the pain he caused her, but Harley wasn't interested and blasted him for cheating on her all those years ago\n\n- Mallet received orders to transfer Harley to the harshest correctional facility, otherwise known as Hell House\n\n- Harley overheard Lena calling Alan and realized that Lena had been spying on her all along! Harley confronted Lena who admitted that Alan was threatening her daughter and asked for Harley’s forgiveness but an upset Harley wouldn’t give it.\n\n- However, when Harley saw Lena about to take Harley’s place on the transfer bus, she refused to let Lena suffer for her, even though Lena betrayed her.\n\n- She then got aboard the bus and tried to get Lena to leave when suddenly, the door closed. Harley and Lena were on their way to Hell House! Just when things looked hopeless, the bus suddenly flipped over and caught on fire leaving her and Lena trapped. - Gus (who had spotted the transfer bus on the road) appeared and pulled Harley to safety. The pair then struggled to free Lena but it was too late and the woman died in Harley's arms.\n\n- After buying a vendor's ice cream truck for transportation, Gus and Harley resolved to find the person who had been sending Gus notes about Phillip's murder. Knowing the notes were coming from New York, Gus and Harley fled there.\n\n- They were unable to find out from the man, named Wallace, who shot Phillip because Sebastian, under direction from Alan, hit him with a car.\n\n- Harley received a call from Mallet warning her that Alan knew where she was. Mallet traveled to New York and, later, got a lucky break when he found a note in Wallace's possessions that named Phillip's killer--Alan!\n\n- Harley set a trap for Alan by anonymously asking him to meet her at Company. Knowing he'd been found out, Alan brought a gun to the meeting and waited. Harley arrived and explained that she was the one who uncovered the truth.\n\n- Alan stonewalled but Harley tricked him into confessing, who had a gun and was threatening Harley with it. Mallet arrived with gun in hand and stopped Alan. Trapped, Alan tried to recant his confession, but was shocked when Lizzie, Alex, Beth, Rick, Bill and Olivia, who were all summoned by Harley, appeared and revealed that they heard Alan’s admission.\n\n- Though Alan tried to weasel out of it, Alex stepped forward and revealed that she had physical evidence that Alan shot Phillip. With Alexandra's testimony, Harley was cleared of all charges and Alan was sent to jail.\n\n- Gus proposed marriage again and Harley accepted.\n\n- Gus was preparing to take over at Spaulding Enterprises. However, on the day of the stockholder's meeting to vote him in as CEO, Gus suddenly froze and ran out. Harley quickly finished his speech and got a most unexpected result: the board was so impressed; they elected her to be the new CEO. When Gus encouraged Harley to take the Spaulding CEO job, she pushed him to go after his badge, knowing it is what he really wanted.\n\n- Blake created a scandal by publishing a thinly disguised book about Harley and Mallet's relationship. Although Gus tried to act like he didn't care, it was obvious that he was concerned about any lingering feelings Harley might have for Mallet.\n\n- After reading the book, Gus asked Harley if she slept with Mallet in the prison. Harley said no, but admitted that she and Mallet made peace with each other while they were in prison, leaving Gus unsettled.\n\n- Gus and Harley became aware that she was being set up to take a fall at Spaulding. Figuring that Alan was working, from the outside, to give Harley faulty accounting information, the pair foiled Alan's plan by getting the correct information.\n\n- Gus and Harley realized that Beth was working with Alan to oust Harley and worked out a plan to eliminate the threat. However Harley realized she needed help and asked Alan-Michael to return to the company in an effort to watch her back.\n\n- Meanwhile, after weeks of Gus and Harley staging arguments, Beth finally took the bait and offered Gus a deal - help her get Harley out of Spaulding and save his marriage as a result. The trap was finally set at the Spaulding Christmas party when Beth privately told Gus to issue Harley and ultimatum--the company or him.\n\n- The entire conversation, including Beth's desire to get rid of Harley and grab power for herself, was played for everyone in the room to hear and Harley promptly fired Beth. Days later, Gus was unnerved to hear that Alan was going to be released from the mental hospital. At year's end, Alan was released from the mental hospital and Harley found a letter from Gus telling her goodbye--he was leaving to take care of Alan once and for all.\n\n- In 2006, using the limo's GPS device, she and Mallet were able to track the limo which had crashed but abandoned. Due to a violent snowstorm the search had be postponed. Reeling from the realization that Gus could be dead, Harley broke down and Mallet comforted her.\n\n- The police discovered Gus's coat and wedding ring in the frozen river where the limo had crashed. Although there were no bodies, the consensus seemed to be that both Alan and Gus had drowned.\n\n- Distraught, Harley went to a bar and got drunk and almost got seduced by a man she thought was Gus until Mallet stopped her. Not wanting her kids to see her drunk, Mallet took her to a motel and got her sobered up. Devastated, Harley raged against Gus for breaking his promise to always be there for her. Mallet comforted her and, before either one of them could fully think it through, they made love.\n\n- One day Harley came across a very agitated Beth at Company. Harley’s suspicions grew even stronger when a key to a cottage fell out of Beth's purse. Harley quickly theorized there was a connection between Beth and Gus, Mallet agreed and the two tailed Beth to an old cottage where they found Alan! Alan informed the pair that although he survived the crash and had been convalescing at the cabin, Gus fell through the ice after the crash and perished.\n\n- They found a \"G\" carved in the cottage floor. Alan explained that he'd carved it as a memorial to his son, but Harley wasn't sure she believed it\n\n- Harley tried to convince Beth to tell her what really happened to Gus, but Beth refused.\n\n- At that moment, Alan entered the room and Harley was able to swipe his cell phone after overhearing him answer a call and quickly told the caller he'd call back. On a hunch, Harley had Marina trace the number which took her to a mental hospital. There, after disarming a guard, Harley came face to face with Gus! Gus and Harley’s tearful reunion at the asylum was cut short by a guard with orders from Alan to shoot on sight. Luckily, Gus and Harley managed to overcome the guard and escape. Finally reunited, Gus told Harley that he'd kidnapped Alan on New Year's Eve with the intention of forcing him to sign a confession that he'd willfully murdered Phillip. The limo crashed and the pair was locked up for over two months by none other than Beth.\n\n- Gus then made a deal with Alan--if Alan left Harley alone; Gus wouldn't press charges against Beth (now pregnant with Alan's child) for kidnapping. Although Alan could have pressed charges against Gus for kidnapping also, he realized they were at a stalemate and agreed. Harley then decided to step down permanently as CEO and named Dinah as her replacement.\n\n- Meanwhile, Marina learned that Alan-Michael was holding a vote of the board to oust Dinah out of Spaulding and make himself CEO. Harley got there in time, though, and announced that she was not stepping down; which meant there would be no vote. She then promptly fired Alan-Michael.\n\n- Gus’ imprisonment left him with an injured leg and an addiction to pain medication. Gus' pill-popping didn't go unnoticed by Dinah who promptly informed Harley. Gus's reliance on the pills was becoming more and more noticeable, even though he kept insisting to Harley that he didn't have a problem. However, it was clearly getting to Gus.\n\n- Harley dragged Gus to see Rick and check out his bum leg. Gus declared that the whole thing was a set-up to cross-examine him about the pain pills and that his own wife didn’t trust him.\n\n- Dinah approached Harley asking her let her return to work. Harley refused and fed up, Dinah threw her affair with Mallet in her face.\n\n- Just then, there came word that Gus and Mallet were involved in a shoot-out. Fortunately, both men were fine, with Mallet only being shot in the shoulder. Realizing Gus was high, Harley had him checked into rehab. A day later, Gus checked himself out and told Harley he'd get help--just not there. He wanted to be with her at the cabin where he was held. With Harley's help, Gus was able to get through his withdrawal symptoms, but then she was suddenly called away on an emergency. At the end, though, Gus came out healthier for it and he and Harley returned home to their kids.\n\n- Harley realized Gus had gone back to the pills. When she confronted him about being stoned, he informed her that he knew about her and Mallet! Harley tried to get Gus to see that in her time of grief, she needed someone, he walked out on her. Knowing Gus couldn’t be on the force in his condition, Harley placed a call to Frank who suspended him. That day, Gus came upon Harley on Main Street and lit into her for contacting Frank. As Harley tried to convince him that he was in no condition to be on the force and needed help, he accused her of being concerned about Mallet, not him. As the weeks went by, Gus continually refused Harley’s help.\n\n- Fed up with him using her affair as an excuse, Harley told him he was on own; she was leaving town with the kids. While she was gone, Gus got his act together. Weeks later, Harley slipped into town and watched Gus from a distance to make sure he was alright. It didn’t take long to realize that he was and they reunited at the site of the home that he built for her.\n\n- Afterwards, Harley resigned from Spaulding and returned to the police force. Soon after, while raiding a drug dealer’s apartment, Gus and Harley found an abandoned baby. Since the police department was swamped, they brought the baby home for night. The whole family fell in love with the little girl, whom they called Gracie. The next day, the baby (whose name was Sydney) was turned over to her grandmother. Spending time with Gracie got both Gus and Harley thinking about parenthood and they decided to try having a baby of their own.\n\n- Although there were obstacles, namely friends and family who kept barging in talking about their problems, Harley and Gus were elated when she finally became pregnant. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a false alarm. In the meantime, Gus and Harley learned that Sydney's grandmother had died and the baby was placed in foster care. Before the child could be placed in foster care, though, she was kidnapped from the police station.\n\n- Gus shocked Harley with the news that he had been hiding Sydney. He then went on to confess that according to the fertility specialist he couldn't have children. He then suggested that they could adopt the girl. Appalled at the kidnapping, Harley was still intrigued.\n\n- However, there was now a kidnapping charge to contend with. So Harley and Gus went on Dinah's new TV show \"Light of Springfield\" and told their story hoping the authorities would take pity on them. It worked; the charges were dropped and the Aitoros were named Sydney's legal guardians.\n\n- In 2007, Gus and Harley prepared for the custody hearing with help from their attorney, Jeffrey. When Jeffrey explained that he’d need to get a statement from Susan, Harley’s first-born.\n\n- Harley e-mailed Daisy asking her to come home ASAP. A few weeks later, Harley was shocked to see Daisy in Springfield. Daisy claimed that she’d just arrived for her cousin Tammy’s funeral.\n\n- The day of the custody hearing arrived. Though Daisy was uneasy about testifying, Harley told her it was necessary and tried to assure her that everything would be fine.\n\n- Unfortunately, the Driscoll’s attorney, Donovan, uncovered evidence linking Daisy to Gillespie. Having caught her in a lie, Donovan tried to paint Daisy as a junkie and even suggested that she may have been driving the car that struck Tammy.\n\n- Suddenly, Gus got up and stated that he had proof that Daisy was not driving. He then confessed to finding her at the scene strung out in the back seat. While court was in recess, Harley blasted Gus for keeping this from her; Gus defended himself by stating that he was only trying to protect Daisy. After expressing concerns that Harley’s absentee parenting had an adverse affect on Daisy, the judge called it a day.\n\n- Daisy continued to clash with an overeager Harley who continued to do things that infuriated Daisy—such as when she invited a guy (Bobby) to Daisy’s prom\n\n- Struck by lightning, Harley became a superhero called The Guiding Light for the Marvel comics crossover\n\n- Harley accepted Buzz’s suggestion that Daisy be sent to a boot camp run by a friend of his from the Army\n\n- Later that evening, as Harley and Gus argued about Daisy (mainly about Gus being too lenient), they realized that Harley’s car was gone. Not only that but so were Daisy and Zach.\n\n- Daisy, who had fallen in love with Gus, drugged him at a motel while they were on their way to the boot camp Harley enrolled Daisy in. Harley eventually discovered the truth and when Daisy got in trouble again she was sentenced to 3 months in a juvenile facility.\n\n- Gus and Harley went to a party for Josh at Company and Buzz introduced them to his newest employee—Natalia. Harley was surprised that Gus and the new waitress seemed to know each other and Gus stated that they were childhood friends. Afterwards, Gus confessed to Harley that Natalia was more than a childhood friend—she was his first love.\n\n- Not long after, Harley saw Natalia at juvenile hall, Though Natalia claimed to be visiting Daisy, Harley was suspicious and accused her of using her family to go after Gus. Again Natalia insisted that she was not after Gus but Harley didn’t believe her and got Buzz to fire her. Later, Remy tried to tell Harley that Natalia needed the work to take care of her son.\n\n- After learning that Natalia had the kid after high school, Harley realized that it was Gus’s son. After confronting Natalia, Harley learned that the reason Natalia was staying in town was because her and Gus’ son, Rafe, had been arrested and was in juvenile hall.\n\n- Later, at juvenile hall, Gus came across another altercation between Rafe and the guard—this time Rafe was holding the guard’s gun. When Gus pulled out his own gun to talk Rafe down, Harley ran in and shouted that the boy was his son! Almost immediately after, Natalia arrived and Gus demanded to hear the truth from her. Natalia admitted that it was true; it happened when he left Chicago and she had no clue where he was.\n\n- Gus testified on his son’s behalf and Rafe was released from juvie. Upon learning that Natalia had gotten an apartment in a rough neighborhood, which is all she could afford, Gus suggested that Rafe live with him and Harley for a year.\n\n- After Harley falsely accused Rafe of stealing money, Daisy blurted out that she was in love with Rafe. Apparently, the pair had met in juvenile detention.\n\n- Harley insisted that Rafe move out but Daisy volunteered to live with Dylan\n\n- Afterwards, Harley informed Gus that Daisy would be moving back in, thus Rafe had to move out. This added more tension to her marriage since Gus accused her of putting her child before his.\n\n- Soon Alan got in the act by suggested to Harley that Rafe move in to the mansion. Though Harley refused since she knew Gus would not approve, it became a moot point when Natalia allowed it.\n\n- A few weeks later, Dylan kissed Harley again at her house just as Gus walked in. Outraged, Gus punched Dylan and when Harley let it slip that this wasn’t the first kiss, Gus went ballistic and beat Dylan to a pulp. The commotion frightened Jude, who called the police. When the police arrived, Harley insisted that it was a family dispute and later went to Dylan’s to beg him not to press charges against Gus since it could cost him his job.\n\n- Dylan agreed as long as Harley did what he wanted-- some family time every week with her and Daisy. Unfortunately their first dinner wound up on the same night Gus wanted a family dinner with Rafe and his mother, Natalia. After Harley called Dylan to tell him that she had to stop by the Spauldiing’s first, Daisy suggested to Dylan that they meet Harley at the mansion\n\n- Unfortunately, that only increased the tension in the Aitoro marriage with both sides insisting on dining with their own children. Neither would budge and Harley ended up leaving while Gus stayed at the mansion. Since Daisy had stalked off after a tiff with Rafe, Dylan and Harley wound up having dinner alone and Dylan took a tipsy Harley home to his place.\n\n- Later, as Dylan was taking Harley home, there was an accident and Dylan was injured and taken to Cedars. Days later, Dylan told Harley that the night she passed out, he crawled in the bed with her to get some sleep and later, thought he saw Gus standing in the doorway. However since he was half-asleep he couldn’t tell if it was real or a dream. Realizing that Gus must have believed that they slept together, Harley ran off to find him. However, before she had a chance she ran into Alan who wasted no time in telling her that Gus slept with Natalia..\n\n- Though Natalia assured Harley that Gus still loved her, Harley was unsettled and accompanied Dylan to a to a physical rehab clinic out of town without contacting Gus. Though Gus tried valiantly to locate her, Harley refused to be found. Harley finally returned weeks later and after an argument with Gus informed her that she never slept with Dylan.\n\n- However he had slept with Natalia and that was something Harley found hard to forgive so Gus moved out. Unfortunately, he moved to his father’s house which is where Natalia was staying. Though Gus tried to argue that he wanted to be near his son, Harley found it unacceptable. Later, while telling Cassie about what happened on the night she passed out, Harley realized that she did not have enough to drink to pass out the way she did.\n\n- Cassie suspected that someone must have drugged Harley’s drink. Though she initially accused Natalia, suspicion soon turned to Alan and he confessed.\n\n- Harley and Gus tried to put their marriage back together by renewing their vows.\n\n- Alan ruined things by giving Gus a false message that Rafe was ill; causing Gus to miss the ceremony. Unable to trust that Gus would put her before Natalia, Harley told Gus that it was over.\n\n- Marina was kidnapped and Harley began working with Cyrus to find her\n\n- Harley was rocked when Dylan and Reva informed her that while she was in New York, Daisy learned she was pregnant and had an abortion.\n\n- Harley lit into Reva for not telling about the pregnancy earlier and accused Reva of taking advantage and treating Daisy like her own daughter. The argument escalated with Harley demanding that Reva stay out of Daisy’s life.\n\n- With Alexandra’s unwilling help, since Alexandra was the one who paid Griggs to kidnap Marina, Harley arranged to meet Griggs and pay him to release Marina. Cyrus followed and though Marina was rescued, Cyrus was captured.\n\n- Harley realized where Griggs had taken Cyrus and arrived to rescue him. Unfortunately before they were able to escape, Griggs returned and held them both at gunpoint. The pair tried to escape but where caught again by Griggs. However, Harley was able to snake Griggs’ inhaler and when he had an asthma attack, he crashed through a hole in the floor. In the meantime, Cyrus and Harley were trapped in the building which they were horrified to learn from a flier was being demolished that very day\n\n- Though they struggled with a way out, it soon became apparent that it was hopeless and they braced themselves for death. With a terrified Harley freaking out, Cyrus tried to distract her while they waited for the end. Soon the building came down around them and miraculously they survived buried under the rubble\n\n- Cyrus’s calls for help became weaker and Harley realized that he was badly hurt. As the roof caved in on top of them, Harley and Cyrus tried to keep their conversation alive, so neither would asleep. Desperate to keep Harley alive and hopeful, Cyrus kissed her gently. Alex eventually revealed where they were to Marina.\n\n- When Harley was released from Cedars, Gus rushed in to see if she was alright and offered to take Harley home and take care of her, Harley saw papers sticking out of his pocket. Grabbing them, she was shocked to see they were annulment papers.\n\n- Distressed, she asked if Gus knew what an annulment meant. It meant that the marriage never happened. It never mattered. Gus tried to convince her that it was not as callous as it sounded but Harley was too emotionally wounded to deal with it and simply told him she’d think about it.\n\n- When Cyrus was released, he moved back with Marina but checked in to see if Harley was okay. Though she claimed to be, Harley was obviously affected by her near death experience.\n\n- Later, Gus came to Harley and suggested that she tear up the annulment papers since he did not like the idea of someone saying their marriage never existed. However, by now all the fight was out of Harley and she insisted that the annulment go through so that he could have a family with Natalia and Rafe.\n\n- As time went by, it was becoming evident that Harley was attracted to Cyrus\n\n- Lizzie floored Harley by mentioning that Gus and Natalia were engaged. Cyrus quickly hustled Lizzie out and as Cyrus tried to console Harley, she surprised him with a kiss.\n\n- Later, Harley’s detective agency opened for business but Harley wasn’t quite so sure of working with Marina and Cyrus now\n\n- After Harley went to Frank to ask for an indefinite leave of absence, she returned to find that Cyrus had already found their first client—Alan who wanted them to find Phillip.\n\n- Though the team debated on whether to take the case, Harley finally decided to take it, thinking it would be best to know exactly where he was. After Marina left, Cyrus asked Harley about Phillip.\n\n- Sensing how the subject distressed her, Cyrus wondered if they shouldn’t drop it but Harley insisted that she could handle finding Phillip.\n\n- After talking with Beth, Cyrus and Harley tracked down the delivery man who delivered a present to Beth from Phillip. While chasing him down the stairwell of the Beacon, Harley suddenly began having a panic attack and held on to the banister for dear life.\n\n- When Cyrus saw what was happening, he was able to talk Harley down\n\n- When he admitted that he had dreams, Harley finally broke down about her panic attacks and Cyrus took Harley in his arms and convinced her that she would be ok\n\n- Weeks later, Harley had another panic attack when she was putting the star on the Christmas tree but luckily Cyrus rescued her again\n\n- After the boys were sent to bed, Harley lamented to Cyrus about how lost she felt and how she just wanted to feel safe. Cyrus offered to stay the night. That night, when Harley had a nightmare about being buried in the rubble, Cyrus comforted her. The next morning, Harley finally admitted to Cyrus that she had feelings for him and he confessed that it was mutual.\n\n- The pair decided to admit their feelings for each other and move on for Marina’s sake. The next day, Harley got a text message apparently from Cyrus asking if Marina suspected anything. Harley replied what is there to suspect.\n\n- Around Christmas, Harley and Cyrus shared drinks together and almost kissed again.\n\n- Later, Harley and Cyrus were both served with finalized divorce papers. Cyrus was elated and began calling Marina until he saw how sad Harley was. The two got drunk and a drunk Cyrus tucked Harley into bed before passing out himself. The next morning, the pair woke up naked but with no memory of how they ended up that way.\n\n- Buzz shocked Harley by confronting her about what happened between her and Cyrus. Harley insisted to her father that nothing happened. Realizing her feelings for her niece’s man were wrong, Harley resolved to stay away from him.\n\n- The next time Harley suffered a panic attack she called Marina. Harley confessed that she'd been suffering from the attacks ever since the building collapse and Cyrus had been helping her through them. When Harley confessed how weak and helpless she felt. Marina comforted Harley and assured her that she was not alone—she had her family.\n\n- Harley asked her if she sent the text pretending to be Cyrus and Marina admitted it.\n\n- Remy informed Harley that Phillip was in New York City and Harley went off to find him. Cyrus followed and urged her to stop denying the pull they had toward each other.\n\n- Cyrus urged Harley to make the leap so they would be together. Though Harley initially refused for Marina’s sake, she decided that Cyrus was the one who made her feel safe and secure. However, when Harley returned to Springfield, Cyrus and Marina were engaged.\n\n- Cyrus and Marina decided to move to France. However, the night they were supposed to leave, Cyrus met with Harley and confessed that she was the one he loved. As Harley and Cyrus made love, Marina was injured while pursuing a drug dealer.\n\n- When Cyrus learned that Marina had been injured, he decided that it might be best to wait before telling her about him and Harley. Though they resolved to stay apart until after Marina recovered from her knee injury, neither Cyrus nor Harley could resist the pull they had and made love.\n\n- Afterwards, they decided to keep their affair a secret. Later, Cyrus finally broke down and told Marina that he loved Harley. Marina angrily lashed out just as Frank approached with Harley. While Harley tried to tell Marina that she never meant to hurt her, Marina refused to be pacified and called Harley a whore before warning her that Cyrus would hurt her as well.\n\n- That day, Harley invited Cyrus to stay at her place. As they were kissing, Frank stopped by and railed at Harley for hurting his daughter. Harley’s relationship with Cyrus didn’t sit too well with Daisy either who lashed out at her mother for hurting Marina and letting Cyrus stay at their house.\n\n- Daisy then announced that she was going to move out. Though Harley wanted her family to accept her and Cyrus, it was becoming clear that that wouldn’t happen any time soon.\n\n- In the meantime, a woman named Phoebe blackmailed Cyrus with knowledge that he scammed her. To keep Cyrus out of trouble, Harley took out a second mortgage on her house in order to pay her off. Unfortunately, this put Harley in a financial bind.\n\n- Harley was rocked when Buzz informed her that Gus had been in a serious motorcycle accident. Before Gus was rushed into surgery, Harley saw him and tearfully admitted that he was the love of her life; he admitted that she was his as well.\n\n- Tragically, the extent of Gus’s head injury was too severe and he died on the operating table. It wasn’t until Gus died that Harley realized that she never stopped loving him and took for granted that they’d be together again.\n\n- Harley saw Gus after he passed and he told her once more that she was the love of his life and that he would be waiting for her\n\n- Having trouble dealing with the loss of Gus, Harley tried several things to alleviate her pain including attempting to open a Boy’s Club Gus had wanted to open. She also went back to the force so that she could finish his last cases.\n\n- Harley was shocked to learn that Gus had been involved in shady dealings before his death but she soon learned that it was to move Olivia Spencer up on the donor list\n\n- After Gus’ son Rafe shot the D.A. Jeffrey O’Neil because he thought he was trying to ruin Gus’ name, Harley left town with the boy to keep him out of jail\n\n- While on the run, Harley spoke to Cassie who admitted that she and Cyrus had slept together, a devastated Harley broke up with Cyrus through Buzz\n\nHarley and her daughter, Susan (Brittany Slattery) with Dylan (Morgan Englund)\n\nAlan-Michael (Carl T.
