        "text": "mood: apathetic\n\nTitle: In the End\n\nAuthor: laughsunshine\n\nRating: NC-17 for language.\n\nPairing: Guiding Light - Otalia\n\nDisclaimer: I own nothing. No profits being made.\n\nSummary: What I want to happen for JL's maternity leave. (Inspired by listening to Linkin Park)\n\nSpoilers: Up to date with what has been aired. Possible spoilers for later on, if I'm right. Should I continue anyway?\n\nPregnant.\n\nThe word shattered any thoughts Natalia had. She was sitting on Rafe's bed, looking at her son's belongings. It made her feel numb, which was better than the nausea induced by the thought of carrying Frank's baby--which also caused guilt because as a Catholic, she valued life at conception. But she just couldn't. This baby was going to enrage the seas that were thought to have been growing calmer. It wasn't fair to blame a child; she knew that. But she couldn't blame Frank either. She had the power to say no. Why didn't she say no? She grabbed a nearby pair of pants Rafe left on his bed and threw them at the lamp on his desk. And in that split second, she felt what it was like to hate herself.\n\nShe noticed Rafe's radio beside the knocked-over lamp. She walked over and pressed play. A CD burned with Linkin Park songs was inside. Natalia resumed sitting on her son's bed. In The End played first. The drums pounded. The piano chimed. And the vocals screamed the pain she felt. She liked this music, even if it was out of her character. She first felt out of character when she arrived in Springfield. She never felt like herself, until she was forced to coexist with the force that is Olivia Spencer. Even when she despised the woman, she felt like herself. She was true to her words. She was real with her emotions, even if it was anger. She knew Olivia was pushing her to be what she truly was. No one would guess how real and honest Olivia was...except for Buzz perhaps.\n\nWhat I've Done began to play.\n\nBut how could she tell Olivia that just when they were comfortable enough to proclaim their love, that she was pregnant with a child she wasn't sure she wanted? How could she face Olivia when she felt like a complete ass? Olivia trusted me. I broke her trust by sleeping with Frank in the first place. How can I sit here, supposedly 18 years wiser, in the same fucking situation as my 16-year-old self? And for the first time, she didn't ask for forgiveness for her cursing. No, she's got bigger sins to be forgiven for. Not for the premarital sex, but for the breaking of Olivia's heart and for the unending urge to abort this baby.\n\nBreaking the Habit was now playing.\n\nTear were rolling down her cheeks and her dimples didn't dare come out. Abortion? No, that would be the easy thing to do. A life is a life; it was her belief. Her phone was ringing, for the 5th time today. She checked the number. It was the hospital again, probably reminding her of the sonogram she was scheduled for. She hit ignore. She couldn't bring herself to face the tiny life inside her. She packed enough for two weeks, booked a flight to Chicago, and wrote a page long note.\n\n--\n\nOn the other side of town, a nervous lab tech was trying to get ahold of a Ms. Rivera. He was very fidgety and kept tapping his fingers on the desk. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit he thought to himself. He was just hired and he already made a huge mistake. He was persistantly trying to get in touch with this patient, to try and tell her that he switched the viles. No answer. Damn. He tried again. This time it went straight to voicemail. Instead of being intelligent and leaving a message, he panicked and hung up. I'm so getting fired. He flung open Ms. Rivera's file. Another law broken. He went down the list of contacts, which obviously hadn't been updated in a while. Gus Aitoro? Deceased. Alan Spaulding? Pass. Buzz Cooper? Not going there. He saw the most recent addition to the file scribbled in purple ink. Olivia Spencer? I'll try, it's my best shot.\n\n--\n\nBack on Olivia's side of Springfield, a persistant knock was rapping on her hotel door. She quickly strode over and answered it. A soaking wet Natalia Rivera rushed through the door. Not only were her clothes and hair soaked, but her eyes were filled with tears.\n\n\"What's wrong Natalia,\" quickly asked Olivia as she reached for the younger woman's arms.\n\n\"Don't-don't ask,\" replied Natalia,\"I love you, don't forget that. Ever. I wish I was strong enough to say more, but I'm afraid if I don't just go my heart will break and I won't be able to go on. S-So I wrote it down.\" Natalia forced a crumpled, damp piece of paper into Olivia's hand.\n\n\"What's going on Na--,\" Olivia managed to get out before Natalia's soft lips met hers. She closed her eyes, reveling in the moment. When she opened them, Natalia was gone. Only a trail of water and a burning sensation on her lips proving that she was ever there. Her eyes moved to the crumpled piece of paper and her eyes began to fill with water. Before she could read the scribbled words, her phone rang.\n\n\"Uh, h-hello?\" Olivia managed to get out.\n\n\"Yes, is this Ms. Spencer?\" said a nervous male voice.\n\n\"Yes it is.\"\n\n\"This is Dave Tanger, lab tech down at Cedar's? You're registered as an emergency contact under Ms. Rivera and I would consider this an emergency.\"\n\nIn 5 minutes, the lab tech explained his vital mistake and said that the patient in question is in fact not pregnant, but has a disease that needs treatment. He also explained that the patient he switched it with is walking around pregnant and has no idea. Olivia quickly blackmailed him in giving him the name, Lizzie Spaulding. Making the lab tech hold, Olivia quickly read Natalia's letter, realizing how devastating this little mistake had on the love of her life. After threatening to sue the lab tech until she had his socks hanging on her fireplace as stockings for Christmas, she hung up and quickly searched for her keys. She had to find Natalia, and soon."
