        "text": "Tues., July 31, 2001 – In the Courtroom, the break from yesterday was covered by Blake coming in and asking what did she miss. A self-satisfied smile crosses her lips as she realizes Ross’ secret weapon is the information she brought for him. They also show the bailiff bringing Gus a glass of water of the stand and then it’s time to kick the trial back into action. Ross continues to hammer away at Gus accusing him of making up the identity of “Gus Aitoro.” Gus denies it. Doris objects but Ross presses further. He tells Gus that they know who he really is and why he has a vendetta against Danny Santos. Ross pulls a photo of a man and boy out of his folder and shows it to Gus and asks if it jogs his memory. Gus looks at the photo and then at Blake, realizing she took it from his room. Ross asks Gus who the boy is and Gus reluctantly admits that it is a photo of him and Joe Augustino, a highly directed cop in Chicago that worked on the organized crime team, putting away mobsters on a regular basis. Ross asks how Gus knows Joe August aka Joesph Augustino and Gus tells him it has nothing to do with this case. Ross against asks about the relationship between Gus and Joe August. Gus still won’t explain. Ross produces a copy of a birth certificate for Gus off his desk. Ross produces the birth certificate that says he was born only seven years ago. In reality it was a name change to Gus Aitoro from Nick August aka Nicholas Augustino and Joe Augustino was his father. Gus admits it. Ross asks why he changed his name and baits him about maybe he was ashamed of his dad. Gus is getting angry telling Ross that his dad was a good man and a terrific cop. He keeps on and asks if that was the case maybe Gus wanted to conceal his identity. Gus tells Ross that he is a FBI agent and he knows Danny Santos and knows that he is a murderer and that is all that matters. Ross points out that Gus has been pursing Danny Santos hard for the past four years. Ross tells Gus that he wants Danny to pay for all that he has done. Gus agrees and tells him that Danny murdered his mother, Carmen Santos. Gus: “We at the FBI have a file on this thick, five inches thick and you don’t get that for being a Good Samaritan.” Ross asks if his interests are purely professional. Ross pushes Gus to once again say that he has been going after Danny just like he would any case, that he hasn’t faked any evidence, and had no personal grudge against Danny. Ross shows Gus his evidence and tells him that if he knows anything more he better tell know. Doris: “Your honor, Mr. Marler is waving papers around this courtroom like they were confetti. If he has something he wants to put on the record as an exhibit he should enter it correctly and I want to see them.” Both the Judge and Doris look at the evidence and then at Gus. Doris walks back to her seat and Ross asks about the document. A police report from 1980, concerning the murder of Joe Augustino allegedly by Miguel Santos. Ross asks if that is why Gus hates Danny Santos and he will break any rules to put him behind bars. He tells the jury that it doesn’t get any more personal that one boy’s father killing another boy’s father. Gus tells Ross that Miguel was never convicted, charged or tried for his dad’s murder but it has nothing to do with Danny’s case. Ross paints a vivid image of Gus’s revenge. He tells Gus that he can imagine him as a small child at his father’s gravesite and promising that the Santos family will pay for killing his dad. He changed his name so that no one would question his motives. Gus blows up.\n\nRoss: “When you grew up you started to make good on that promise. You graduated near the top of your class, you joined the FBI, you rose through the ranks and then one day you got yourself appointed to the Santos case and that’s when you decided to change your name in hopes that no one would ever face you as I’m doing now to question your motives because ultimately the truth doesn’t mean one bit the only thing that matters to you is getting even for your dad….(Gus interrupts).”\n\nGus: “You want to know what the truth is? I’ll tell you want the truth is. They is they shot him down in cold blood. He was one of the best men that ever lived. Do I want them to pay? Ya Damn straight I want them to pay. I want him to pay, I want every single one of them to rot in Hell for the rest of their pathetic life. How’s that for the truth?”\n\nIn light of the new evidence Ross moves for a mistrial. The judge asks for the Doris and Ross to meet in his chambers. Everyone leaves except Gus who stays in the witness stand, stunned.\n\nDuring Gus’s attempt to deflect Ross’ questions he says he is a registered driver in the state of Illinois and a graduate of Georgetown Law. He says his buddies used to call him Kojack, but it’s unclear that this is a joke (Kojack was a very famous TV police detective in the 1970s) or if his friends really called him that. I could see it either way. Gus has been directly pursuing Danny for four years (back in 1998) and his name change was seven years ago (back in 1995).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iln44DHyP2Y (Part 1)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zkHNucE42A (Part 2)\n\nMy Comments: This was a truly masterful piece of misdirection. They had been laying bricks for months that Gus might be Miguel Santos, Jr., but this completely alternative option wasn’t even considered even though it makes just as much sense. The main problem with this story is that it no longer makes sense after further retcon revelations. In this case that’s that Gus’s sister Eden had already killed Tony and Ray’s father who was supposedly the actual trigger man. I mean even if you go for an eye for an eye the score is even up so what’s his problem? Again, Gus is terrible, but in another red herring move Gus is actually telling the truth when he says he didn’t fake some of the evidence. However, if he didn’t fake it, it makes less sense, not more, that he did fake what he did. Even when we’re actually seeing the photo of Gus and his dad Joe, they are still selling it as Miguel Jr. for the first couple of beats until after the commercial break. The photo was taken at a Cubs game. This is such an excellent game of red herring. After a masterful testimony Danny takes a back seat to Ross during this phase of the trial, but they often flash to him for a tense reaction shot. Right after the Joe August bit Danny’s picked up a pen. I wonder if it was Paul or the director who decided on that just to break the routine of those shots up a little.\n\nTruly the Ross arguing Danny’s side of the defense are truly some of Ross’ best lawyering ever. Love how Ross then goes to calling him Nicholas after the reveal both to get Gus into that mindset and to remind jury he lied.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
