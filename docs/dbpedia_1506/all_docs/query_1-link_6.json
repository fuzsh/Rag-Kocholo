        "text": "Faculty and Staff\n\nThe Department of Kinesiology is comprised of 22 tenured and tenure-track faculty, 20 lecturers, 35+ activity instructor faculty, and 5 staff. Phone, email, and brief descriptive information are listed below. If you have program-specific questions, please contact the appropriate coordinator or manager directly.\n\nDepartment Chair\n\nTamar Z. Semerjian, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor\n\nSpartan Complex 116\n\n408-924-3069\n\nProfessor Bio\n\nDr. Tamar Z. Semerjian received her B.A. degrees in Human Biodynamics and Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and her M.A. and Ph.D. in sport psychology from the department of Health, Leisure, and Sport Studies from the University of Iowa. She is the director of the Silicon Valley Health Aging Partnership (SVHAP).\n\nDr. Semerjian is currently a Professor of Sport and Exercise Psychology and Chair in the Department of Kinesiology at San José State University. She teaches several courses in the department including undergraduate courses in sport psychology, sport sociology, stress management, diversity stress and health, and graduate courses in sport psychology and research methods. Dr. Semerjian’s research has included work with older adults, individuals with spinal cord injury, and transgender athletes.\n\nGenerally, her research interests focus on exploring the experiences of marginalized groups in exercise through the lens of both cultural studies and sport psychology. In particular she has been interested in the translation of evidence-based health promotion programs in the community, the effect of exercise on older adults’ self-perceptions, and the influence of their exercise experience on long-term participation. Because of her belief in the importance of praxis, she has been active in the aging community, implementing exercise programs that are affordable and accessible to diverse populations of older adults.\n\nDr. Semerjian’s published work has appeared in Spinal Cord, The Sport Psychologist, Journal of Aging and Physical Activity, Sociology of Sport Journal, and Women’s Sport and Physical Activity Journal, and she had contributed chapters to Sport for Peace and Social Justice, The Cultural Turn in Sport Psychology, The Hidden Faces of Eating Disorders and Body Image, and Battleground: Sports.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. University of Iowa - Health, Leisure, and Sport Studies (Emphasis: Sport Psychology)\n\nCertificate in Aging Studies; University of Iowa, Iowa City. 1999.\n\nM.A. University of Iowa - Health, Leisure, and Sport Studies (Emphasis: Sport Psychology)\n\nB.A. University of California at Berkeley - Human Biodynamics (Emphasis: Sport Psychology and Muscle Physiology)\n\nExpertise, Research & Teaching Interests\n\nMy area of expertise focuses on the psychology and cultural studies aspects of exercise across a variety of populations and contexts. My dissertation research focused on older women’s physical self-perceptions and how they related to their physical activity participation. I have taught courses in aging and physical activity, as well as implemented community based partnerships which have allowed students to learn more about exercise and aging through service learning opportunities. I was the founder of the Silicon Valley Healthy Aging Partnership, which continues to support community based organizations to offer evidence based-health promotion programs throughout Santa Clara county. I have published a number of research studies and chapters related to aging and physical activity.\n\nIn addition to a focus on aging, I have also worked in the area of disability as a member of a research team that created a cutting-edge exercise program for individuals with spinal cord injuries. My contribution to the team was to consider the psychological and sociocultural impact of the exercise program. I have also worked with transgender athletes, and have focused my research in this area as well, primarily in an effort to advocate for increased inclusion of trans athletes within all sporting and physical activity contexts. Most recently I have become interested in the use of fitness tracking applications, and the ways that the use of fitness trackers and the social media that is often used in conjunction with them impacts individuals’ physical activity experiences.\n\nCourses Taught\n\nKIN 69 Stress Management\n\nKIN 164 Sport Sociology\n\nKIN 167 Sport Psychology\n\nKIN 169 Diversity Stress and Health\n\nKIN 267 Sport Psychology\n\nSelected Publications\n\nSemerjian, T.

Since arriving at SJSU in 2000, he has taught a variety of courses in the graduate (sport sociology, qualitative research methods), undergraduate (psychology of coaching, sport sociology), and general education (diversity, stress, & health, stress management) programs. Broadly speaking, his academic life involves the intersection between sport sociology, sport psychology, and cultural studies, and thus most of his work comes from an interdisciplinary (or transdisciplinary) perspective. His main areas of research include the relationship between sport, technology, and the body, the subcultures of mixed martial arts and pro wrestling, doping in sport, and white racism and privilege in sport. He has published over 30 refereed journal articles and book chapters, and given over 50 national and international conference presentations. In 2003 he won the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport’s Outstanding Article award, and he was the recipient of the 2010 SJSU College of Applied Sciences and Arts Dean’s Scholar Award. In 2009, along with colleagues Jay Johnson and Matthew Masucci, he was the PI of a 2-year World Anti-Doping Agency grant that examined how elite, female triathletes come to know about various forms of doping and the anti-doping movement. Finally, he was a 2012 Salzburg Fellow, and along with Dr. Matthew Masucci, he co-directs the department’s Qualitative Research Lab. Outside of his academic pursuits, Dr. Butryn was a member of the University of Tennessee track and cross-country teams, and he continues to advocate for healthy, active lifestyles.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. University of Tennessee - Education (Emphasis in Sport Psychology & Cultural Studies). M.A. San José State University - Societal Studies (Emphasis in Sport Psychology).\n\nB.S. University of Tennessee - Sport Psychology.\n\nExpertise, Research & Teaching Interests\n\nMy original area of focus was sport psychology, with an undergraduate thesis on the evolution of an eco-sport psychology, and a master’s thesis that examined the thoughts and cognitions of female distance runners in park and urban settings. During my doctoral program at Tennessee, I became interested in the lived experiences of athletes and exercisers, and thus turned my attention to various qualitative methodologies to answer my eclectic research questions. My first ever qualitative study was on the perceptions and experiences of college athletes with tattoos, and subsequently, I completed my dissertation on the technological life histories of elite track and field athletes. Currently, I continue research on cyborg sport, the psychology and sociology of mixed martial arts and the subculture of pro wrestling, doping in sport, and whiteness in sport.\n\nCourses Taught\n\nKIN 69 - Stress Management\n\nKIN 164 - Sociocultural Perspectives (Sport Sociology)\n\nKIN 168 – Psychology of Coaching\n\nKIN 251 – Fundamentals of Qualitative Research\n\nKIN 264 – Advanced Sport Sociology\n\nSelected Publications\n\nButryn, T.

Prior to his doctoral studies at the University of Toronto, his educational background was founded and forged at San José State University where he completed his undergraduate degree in the Department of Kinesiology (B.S., concentration – sport management), as well as his graduate degree in Kinesiology (M.S., concentration – sport studies). Generally, Dr. Dao’s research is interdisciplinary and involves critical pedagogy, historical sociology, critical social theory and development studies. Dr. Dao’s research interests are rooted in sport as tool for development internationally, and sport studies in Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora. In a teaching capacity, Dr. Dao teaches primarily in the sport management and culture stream with links to graduate course, undergraduate core courses and general elective courses. Professionally, Dr. Dao has worked in various spaces related to sport in university athletics ranging from development, marketing, ticket operations and compliance. His most recent role was working in the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics at San José State University. Through this research and professional development Dr. Dao is an advocate for equitable and diverse practices in sport and physical activity. He aims to build bridges between the Department of Kinesiology and communities around San José to address social barriers that may prohibit marginalized from participating in sporting spaces. Moreover, as a native of San José, CA who was born to Vietnamese refugees, Dr. Dao is passionate about immigrant and refugee rights in America. He hopes his research and teaching will engage all students and communities to work towards practices of social justice.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D., University of Toronto – Exercise Sciences (Field of Study: Physical Cultural Studies)\n\nM.A, San José State University – Kinesiology (Field of Study: Sport Studies)\n\nB.S., San José State University – Kinesiology (Field of Study: Sport Management)\n\nExpertise, Research & Teaching Interests\n\nMy diverse research interests are united by the use of historical sociology and critical theoretical approaches to examine dominant and subversive constructions of sport and physical culture, with a particular emphasis on the role of development and social change in international sport. Broadly, my research interests center on how sport and physical activity are utilized to address humanitarian issues domestically and internationally. Engaging with the field of Sport for Development (SfD), my curiosity stems from how sport when transformed into a tool for development is processed, practiced and participated by numerous stakeholders (e.g., funders, SfD projects, & local community members). This is particularly important as both “sport” and “development” discourses are not similar across different nations, cultures, and peoples. My research has primarily been centered in the Southeast Asian country of Vietnam where I worked alongside an SfD project, Football for All in Vietnam (FFAV). At SJSU, I am working to continue my international partnership and future projects in Vietnam, specifically a historical project of physical culture of the country.\n\nI have taught courses in sport and recreation perspectives, physical culture and social inequality, and international development through sport. In my courses I aim to engage students academic rigor, reflexivity and research skills. It is my intent as an educator to provide scholarly and analytical resources for students to use in their lives and apply in their communities. I believe students should be seen as both the means and the ends to their education and need to drastically embrace their roles as the change agents in their lives.\n\nCourses Taught\n\nKIN 111: Sport and Movement in a Global Context\n\nKIN 160: History of Sport and Physical Education\n\nKIN 164: Sociocultural Perspectives of Sport\n\nKIN 263: International Sport and Physical Education Selected Publications\n\nJournal Articles:\n\nDao, M. & Darnell, S.C.

Her current specialization is an interdisciplinary field that combines neurosciences, biomechanics, and biomedical engineering. She earned her M.S. in Kinesiology with a concentration in biomechanics from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and B.S. in Sports Somatic Science (Kinesiology) with a concentration in exercise physiology from Beijing Sport University. Dr. Hu's research investigates cortical control of mobility and balance in humans, its interaction with aging, pain, cognitive function, chronic condition, disease, and exercise intervention, and implementing technologies to address health monitoring and rehabilitation issues. Apart from academic activity, she enjoys video games, music, reading, handcrafting, cooking, and generally all outdoor activities.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign – Kinesiology (concentration: Neuromechanics)\n\nM.S., Southern Illinois University Carbondale – Kinesiology (concentration: Biomechanics)\n\nB.S., Beijing Sport University – Sports Somatic Science (Kinesiology) (concentration: Exercise Physiology)\n\nExpertise, Research & Teaching Interests\n\nThroughout my early academic journey, I have developed a research agenda with the purpose of improving older population health outcomes through neuromechanical approaches to understanding the mechanism behind aging-related changes and mind-body exercises that affect balance and mobility. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how aging’s impact on movement intention translates to action through the complex interplay between the nervous system and the musculoskeletal system. These basic science findings can facilitate advances in the understanding of movement disorder and in identifying mechanisms of prevention and rehabilitation. I am also interested in developing technology tools and implementing excise programs based on these mechanisms that directly benefit the older population.

Jensen earned her Ph.D. in Medical Physiology at University of Missouri, M.S. in Exercise physiology at San Francisco State University, and B.S. degree in Biology at Sangmyung University in Seoul, Korea. Dr. Jensen is currently an assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology in the Department of Kinesiology at San José State University. She teaches various undergraduate and graduate courses in the field of exercise and clinical physiology. Her main area of research is in human neural control of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system, and her goal is to identify a physiological basis for possible effects of exercise on neurological disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder and Cerebral Palsy. Dr. Jensen is a true believer of “Exercise is Medicine”, and she hopes to investigate how exercise might improve the physiological system and the lives of people with neurological disorders and their families.\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. University of Missouri – School of Medicine, Department of Medical Pharmacology and Physiology, Medical Physiology\n\nM.S. San Francisco State University – Department of Kinesiology, Exercise Physiology\n\nB.S. Sangmyung University – Natural Sciences, Department of Biology, Biology\n\nExpertise, Research & Teaching Interests\n\nDr. Jensen’s long term research agenda focuses on the effect of various types of exercise training on physiological system in individuals with neurological disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Cerebral Palsy (CP). In the past, she has focused her research on population who have chronic diseases and how their neural control mechanisms are altered to affect cardiovascular system. Because individuals with ASD and CP develop cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in their very early age compared to general population, she saw an important neural link of physiological mechanisms to this population. Therefore, her current projects have three different subfields of clinical exercise physiology (i.e., autonomic, vascular, and musculoskeletal function) to understand potential physiological mechanisms of ASD and CP by detecting any alterations above and how they improve their function after exercise training.\n\nCourses Taught\n\nKIN 157 – Physiological Assessment\n\nKIN 187 – Clinical Exercise Physiology\n\nKIN 255 – Fundamentals of Quantitative Research Method in Kinesiology\n\nSelected Publications\n\nJensen, A.K., J.

M.S.\n\nUniversity of Oregon – Human Physiology (Emphasis: Biomechanics). B.S.\n\nShanghai University of Sport – Kinesiology. Expertise, Research & Teaching Interests\n\nDr. Jin’s current research focuses on human lower extremity joint mechanics patterns in walking and running gait, as well as gait balance control and injury prevention among different population settings (elderly people, endurance runners, amputees, etc.). Specifically, he plans to identify foot and ankle system mechanical energy flow in different locomotion tasks and speeds. Based on that, he also plans to evaluate different footwear, prostheses and ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) design and the connection with ankle-foot system energetic patterns during locomotion, with the longer-term goal to improve gait performance.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Jin is working on wearable sensors research. With the goal to apply inertia measurement units (IMUs) in the following two areas: 1) the evaluation of walking gait balance control and fall prevention among elderly people, and it would be helpful to facilitate IMUs application in clinical gait balance evaluation; 2) track and identify the potential risk factors of running related overuse injuries (tibial stress fracture, patella femoral pain, etc.) on endurance runners.\n\nDr. Jin have taught various courses related to biomechanics, exercise and performance, biostatistics and research methods. He is teaching KIN 158 Biomechanics class at SJSU. He incorporates his own research into teaching and guide the students to actively engage in acquiring knowledge through critical thinking, discovery and creativity process.
