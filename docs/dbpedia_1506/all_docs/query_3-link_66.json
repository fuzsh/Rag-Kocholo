During his tenure at UTSA, he served as the Athletics Healthcare Administrator for Roadrunner Athletics and had direct oversight of the football, men's golf and women's golf teams.\n\nBellamy spearheaded the creation of the UTSA/UT Health Sports Medicine Program - an inter institutional collaboration that brought in-house Primary Care Physician services that provided access to comprehensive healthcare services for all Roadrunner student-athletes through UT Health Physicians. That program also brought Physical Therapy, Neuropsych, and the forming of an Athletic Training Residency Program.\n\nWhile serving as co-chair of the C-USA Medical Advisory Committee, Bellamy also implemented an independent medical care model by integrating an in-house Chief Team Physician with a fully functioning clinic at UTSA. He hired and managed a staff of 13 certified and licensed athletic trainers, a Director of Rehabilitation, the Director of Sports Nutrition, the Director of Mental Health Services, and an administrative assistant/insurance coordinator.\n\nPrior to his stint at UTSA, Bellamy worked as the Assistant AD for Sports Performance at Howard University from 2015-19, where he oversaw the transition to a \"sports performance\" model that combined Sports Medicine and Strength & Conditioning and added Sports Nutrition and Sports Psychology.\n\nFrom 2013-15, the Maryland native was the Director of Sports Medicine and Head Athletic Trainer at Coppin State, where he provided athletic training services to men's basketball, track and field, baseball, and tennis teams. He was the Assistant Athletic Trainer at Howard from 2011-13 and an AT and teacher at Archbishop Carroll High School from 2008-11. In 2007, he worked as a summer intern for the NFL's San Diego Chargers.\n\nA magna cum laude graduate of North Carolina Central University, Bellamy earned his B.S. in athletic training in 2008. He was awarded a master's in exercise science and health promotion from Cal University Pennsylvania in 2015.\n\nBellamy met his wife Brittney when. they were students at NCCU and the couple has four children: Darren, Brielle, Britain, and Dallas"
