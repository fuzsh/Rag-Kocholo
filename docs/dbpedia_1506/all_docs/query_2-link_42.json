        "text": "Dr. Lee has used academic community engagement for her students as it is known to offer students the opportunities to a) have better understanding of the content while applying knowledge and theory to relevant practice and reflection on their own action; and b) build a sense of civic responsibility. All of her adapted physical activity/education courses have incorporated service-learning components to enable students to engage in experiential learning and giving back to community while interacting with individuals with disabilities in physical activity settings. She has successfully secured internal and external grants and has been able to create several community-based adapted physical activity programs such as a movement-based social skills program for children with autism. She is passionate for quality physical activity programs for individuals with disabilities and field sites where her students can have hands-on experiences and engage in research activities.\n\nCourses Taught"
