Incoming funds are concentrated on major donors while the middle and small donors are disappearing. The average new donor retention rate is 45%, so it is difficult to know what strategy to employ. We want to focus on one problem: How to attract and keep younger donors and build the future of loyal mid and major gift donors. Giving in the workplace has transformed in this century. In today’s landscape, it’s become a tactic for employee engagement and retention and even marketing or brand image strategies. For nonprofits, workplace giving has the potential to attract younger donors with means (the average age of employees in corporate America is 38, and the average yearly donation is $1,250). Workplace giving has a corporation’s communication and marketing power behind it because they are using this type of programming to enhance its brand image and keep employees. It also has the element of donor engagement because a key element of workplace giving is the act of volunteering. It encourages collaboration among employees and gives nonprofits an opportunity for donors to really get to know you. Workplace giving also has the amplifying power of a company match for both donations and volunteer actions; and, in many cases, another boost from corporate foundation grants. A majority of workplace giving is inspired by local actions which encourages a closer connection between a donor and the nonprofit. Estimates of giving through the workplace in 2023 were $5B. But much of what companies have set aside for charitable gifts is left on the table. It’s estimated that between $3 and $7 billion have gone un-donated.\n\nEducation Track: Securing the Gift\n\nAudience: Applied\n\nDelphine Hasle, CFRE\n\nPerley Health Foundation - Executive Director\n\nDelphine Hasle is a motivated professional, adept and experienced in setting philanthropic strategies and performance measures from annual programs through to capital campaigns.
