        "text": "Gail Elizabeth Dodge is Dean of the College of Sciences and Professor of Physics at Old Dominion University, where she has been a member of the faculty since 1995. She is an experimental nuclear physicist, studying the protons and neutrons which make up the atomic nucleus. In order to do that she uses the high energy electron beam at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia, which functions like an enormous electron microscope. The goal of these experiments is to probe the underlying quarks and gluons that make up the protons and neutrons.\n\nDr. Dodge served a two-year term as a program manager at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Arlington, Virginia. There she was responsible for the $17 million experimental nuclear physics program and for coordination with the Office of Nuclear Physics at the Department of Energy (DOE). Prior to working at NSF, she served as a member of the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee, which advises DOE and NSF on priorities for nuclear science funding in the United States.\n\nShe was chair of the ODU Department of Physics for six years. In 2015, she was selected by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia for an Outstanding Faculty Award. She received her B.A. from Princeton University and her M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford University."
