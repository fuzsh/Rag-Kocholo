To the many friends, living and dead, who by spoken or written word have helped me with the discouragements mastered or lost along my way Preface Y A kindly old man who had witnessed much of the confusing propaganda of his times I was told that in my life’s journey I should believe nothing that I heard and only half that I saw. W hile this admonition is overdrawn, it nevertheless contains a cautionary truth needed by all of us in weighing our observations and in assess­ ing the values of life. In preparing the material for this book I have endeavored not to disregard this warning. Accordingly, I have dwelt upon the virtues of home life, the value of friendships and of co­ operative interest in human beings engaged in efforts looking to the benefit of society. The three score and ten years covered by my memory and herein recorded constitute without doubt the most important period in hu­ man history for our country and for the world, measured by any standard which the reader may employ. Probably the most sig­ nificant development in this era is the gradual evolution of American thought with regard to our responsibility for all classes of people in our own country and for the alleviation of the distressed and needy everywhere. I am not a pessimist with eyes toward the graveyard of despair. As to ultimate results I am an optimist sustained by my faith in my country, in its citizenry and in the great evolution of those forces, moral and spiritual, that w ill survive this era and take on new life after this war, building a better world in which to live. In the light of these concepts I invite the reader to travel with me over the his­ toric period covered by this book. If in doing so, he is strengthened m his belief in his country, in his determination to co-operate with duly selected leaders, and if he becomes convinced that this is the only way that peace can be brought about and preserved, my efforts in the preparation of this record will not have been in vain. T h e many individuals who have graciously co-operated with me B viii PREFACE in checking and constructively criticizing the manuscript are too nu­ merous to mention here by name. T o every one of them I hereby extend my sincere thanks and deep gratitude. D. C. R. Contents CHAPTER PAGE i. O ld P ii. T T he D lan tatio n 3 j5 33 57 77 9° io7 ays R ’s hree h i.

I stood beside my father on the piazza of our home in South Carolina. W e looked upon a scene which was characteristic of the “ Tragic Era.” Out beyond the great oak tree which overhung the road, a column of blue-coated soldiers passed by. N ever before had I seen so many men with guns, nor could I comprehend the reason for them. M y father watched the unwel­ come procession in tight-lipped silence. A “ W ho are they?” I inquired with childish curiosity. “ And what are they going to do with their guns? Are they on their way to shoot somebody?” H e took my hand, drawing me closer to him. “ T h ey’re Yankees, my boy,” he replied. “ Yankee soldiers.” H e spoke in a way that left no doubt of his resentment. And then he added, “ T h ey’re here to guard the election next Tuesday j to see that all the Negroes vote for carpetbaggers.” I was much too young to understand the significance of the word “ vote,” yet child that I was, I sensed that these outsiders were unwanted, that their mere presence was an insult and oppressive to my father and our neighbors. T h e ominous tramp tramp sounded from the dusty road, from which came also bursts of boisterous laughter and snatches of song. M y father did not speak again until the alien column had disappeared down the road. Then he led me into our sitting room to the open fire. T h e sight of the soldiers had depressed him, darkening his naturally merry countenance. Feeling that something was wrong, I began to ply him with questions. “ W here did the soldiers come from? W ho will they shoot with the guns? Negroes? W hat is a voter” 4 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE Affectionately, he took me on his knee, for ours was a relation­ ship closer than the usual bonds between father and son. M y mother having died when I was two and one-half years old, he seldom let me far from his sight. “ The Yankees from the North defeated us in the Civil W ar,” he began in explanation. Then, in a simple way that I could follow, he accounted for the presence of the soldiers. South Carolina and the other Southern states, he told me, had been fighting for self-government since the surrender of Lee at Appomattox. So far they had failed to get it. Instead they had been governed by bayonets and the sword, by tyranny beyond the abuses of the slave trade. The carpetbaggers, outsiders from the North who did not like us, were running the South, looting, stooping to crime and ex­ tortion. In conclusion, he said, “ The murder of President Lincoln was the worst blow we could have had.” “ W h y?” I asked. “ Was he for our side?” H e was slow to answer, but finally said, “ The war, my boy, was properly settled. I was against secession in 1861. Then I lived in North Carolina, and when my state left the Union, I helped get up a company of soldiers. W e were known as the Scotch Boys. W e fought four years and many were killed. It was awful— but the things going on today are even worse than war.” What I learned that morning had a profound effect upon me. M y childish eyes were opened, for I learned that I, together with my family and all the whites in our part of the country, lived under a black and fearful cloud. W e had to fight for the sunshine of lib­ erty. There would be no true liberty until those blue-coated soldiers had gone back to the land from which they came. ii Indeed, it was a changing, altogether an upside-down, world into which I was born in 1867* The South was broken in everything save her proud spirit. Although many of my father’s comrades never mustered courage to begin anew, he neither lost his self-command nor sense of humor in defeat, not during the ten dark, bloody, terrifying years of Reconstruction. The iron nerve fibers it took to sur­ vive the “ Tragic Era” may be illustrated by my father’s own expe­ rience. H e was one of the leaders of the Scotch Boys who marched away to martial music and the spirited strains of “ Dixie.” The kisses OLD PLANTATION DAYS 5 of beautiful women— wives and sweethearts— were warm upon their lips, tender goodbyes lingered in their ears, and they left in the fervor of glory. Eager to acquit themselves nobly in their section’s cause and certain of victory, they had a joyous departure— such as few armies of the world ever experienced. Thus enthusiastic was the early spirit of the Confederacy. W hat a contrast was their home­ coming. There were four long years of increasing hardship and illness, of starvation and battling against impossible odds. Then, finally, the bitter cup of gall— defeat. T h e farm my father left behind was near Laurinburg, North Carolina, not far from the South Carolina state line. W hile fighting for the Confederacy, he had no idea his homeplace lay in the path of Sherman’s destructive march to the sea. H ow revealing, therefore, his homecoming. Upon reaching the farm he saw his ruin. Not one building had been left standing. A ll had been transformed to ashes. H is livestock had been slaughtered or driven away. Not so much as a ploughshare remained, since General Sher­ man’s men had made a clean sweep of all his belongings. A ll he now possessed besides the barren farm were his ragged gray uniform and the relics of war, his canteen, knapsack, and musket. T h e future was not a happy prospect. Fortunately for the vanquished, the word “ neighbor” had a sweeter connotation in 1865 than, perhaps, it has today. M y father was well and favorably known in the Scotch community which strad­ dled the line between the Carolinas. His immediate neighbors, the Covingtons, extended him every help in their power. T he following year, 1866, he married my mother, Henrietta M cLaurin, of M arl­ boro County, South Carolina. She prevailed upon him to give up the place in North Carolina and to live in her state. H e purchased her ancestral home, the house in which both she and I were born. It is something of a tragedy to be an only child 5 more of one to be left motherless at less than three. Y et, in my case, this tragedy was somewhat mitigated by an affectionate aunt, my mother’s young­ est sister, and by a kindly father. Another who would have sought to kill any person attempting to injure one hair of my head was Lindy, the Negro mammy, who loved me as if I had been her own. I f I fell, stubbed a toe, or bumped a knee, if I got the slightest cur or bruise, it was Lindy who pacified me with endearing words and 6 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE rendered first aid. So with all this attention and the worshipful respect of a host of genuinely happy pickaninnies I did not suffer the ennui of the average only child. A fter that day in 1872 when I first saw Yankee soldiers, my father often talked to me about the war. It was his custom to take me along when he made trips over the plantation or visited relatives and neighbors. These rides, frequently on horseback, with me in the front of his saddle, afforded many conversations. One of his ex­ periences, related at that period, made an indelible impression. Toward the close of the war, he, along with a large group of fellow soldiers in the Confederate Army, was taken prisoner by raiders from Sherman’s army who were then on their march to the sea. A ll the Confederate prisoners were lined up, examined, and recorded. Each one was asked, “ Did you volunteer into the Con­ federate Arm y?” And then, “ W ere you drafted into the service against your convictions?” “ I was always against secession,” was one of the stock replies, for the prisoners all feared harsh treatment and possible execution. Another reply was, “ I was overpersuaded.” M y father had opposed secession until his state took action, but the false replies of his fellow Confederates disgusted him. Finally his turn came, and the inquisitor for the Federal troops approached ftim, asking, “ H ow about you? W ere you a Union man at heart, too?” “ N o,” replied father defiantly. “ I was never a Union man. I was the most ardent secessionist that ever wore the gray uniform— or followed the Stars and Bars.” Think of my father’s surprise when the officer extended his hand. “ You are the first secessionist I have found today,” he said. “ Out of respect for truth, I shan’t imprison you. Instead I’ll give you a passport home.” M y father was thus released and permitted to start on the homeward journey. In the years of Reconstruction, our farm was heavily mortgaged, and my father was often burdened with his financial situation. One day, seeing he was more unhappy than usual, I asked him why con­ ditions were so hard for us. “ It’s the same old tragedy, son,” he replied. “ W e’ll be many a day and many a year paying for the war. W e have to lift ourselves by our bootstraps. This condition must be borne by me and by your generation before recovery.” Perhaps it was in part because of this load my father carried, and to some extent his desire for someone to act as my mother, that he OLD PLANTATION DAYS 7 remarried. I was seven years old at the time. I already knew Miss Lucy M cC oll and liked her. She was of our Scotch settlement, and, while much younger, had been a dear friend of my mother. I, there­ fore, welcomed her with joy the day my father brought her to our home as his wife. She proved as devoted and helpful to me as if I had been of her own flesh and blood. She was a companion and an inspiration to me. hi Father Tim e has a trick of laying a rosy wreath upon childish memories, yet I am sure that, barring the war and the tragic hard­ ships of Reconstruction, there has never been a happier social phase of life upon this continent than that existing in the South during what we have come to call Plantation Days, before and following Reconstruction up to the launching of industry there in the eighties. Before entering upon some of the experiences of my childhood there, it may not be amiss to give a general idea of the community, and also of the plantation where I was born. M y native county, M arlboro, was contiguous to Richmond County, North Carolina. In Richmond County my father, John W esley Roper, was born and spent his childhood and young man­ hood. W ithin these two counties, and radiating outward, the popu­ lation was preponderantly Scotch. N ot long after the battle of the Scottish clans at Culloden, in April, 1746, there was a mass migration from Scotland. A large number of these immigrants settled on the Cape Fear R iver near W ilm ington, North Carolina. Those who came first brought others, and Scots kept coming to the Carolinas up to the outbreak of the Revolutionary W ar. One of the most notable of those who came was the Jeanne d’Arc ° f the Highlanders, Flora M cDonald. She headed one of the larg­ est groups coming to North Carolina, settling them in Cumberland and Robeson counties, and it was from her identical group that many of the Scots in my community were descended. These Scottish de­ scendants were a thrifty people, learning early in their American experiences how to be self-sustaining upon the land. T h e best farm­ ers found that by making cotton a surplus crop they would never be broke. Therefore, unlike many others of the South, they did not have to maintain large credits and wait a year to settle their bills 8 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE upon the annual sale of their cotton. They were co-operative, deeply religious, and clannish in their loyalties to each other. In this community there was little need for money except when the time came to pay taxes, which were negligible. M any families kept bees for the production of honey; they cured their own bacon and hams; did spinning and weavingj held quilting parties, which were enjoyable social events. And well do I remember the corn shuckings and log rollings, the barn raisings and the brick burnings. A ll the neighbors turned out to lend a hand and partake of the sumptuous feasts that followed these enterprises. T he same Scottish names recurred so frequently in our com­ munity that they often proved confusing to strangers. A story is told of a traveler coming into the community for the first time. Address­ ing the first person he met, he asked to be directed and informed as to the names of the people living up the road. H e was selling a household utensil and desired to approach them by name. “ The first house,” he was informed, “ is the home of M r. M cFall. Just beyond, on the other side of the road— that’s where M r. M cLeod lives. The next house is M r. M cCoy’s, and after that you come to M r. M cDougall’s. On farther— that’s M r. M cDougallM cCoy’s place.” T h e stranger suddenly got the idea he was being imposed upon, and pulled angrily on the reins of his horse. “ That’s enough,” he stormed. “ Goodbye to you. I suppose I ’ve been talking to M r. M cFool-M cFool!” Few strangers came our way in those days. But always a most welcome visitor from the outside world was James Shovlin, an itiner­ ant Irish peddler. H e passed a week-end at our home at least once each month. H e was a man of high type, a graduate of one of the leading Irish universities, and deeply religious. H e sold fine linens imported from Belfast. I have always remembered Shovlin’s account of his difficult crossing of the ocean to come to America. H e was a colorful narrator, and his vivid account of the voyage fired my youth­ ful imagination. It was charming to hear about a foreign country from a foreigner, the more charming because of Shovlin’s rare Irish wit. M y father had high respect for religion, but was not at that time so obsessed with it as Shovlin. I mention this because of the incident I am about to relate. OLD PLANTATION DAYS 9 One beautiful M ay day father and I were sitting beneath the oak tree at the roadside in front of our home. T h e trees in all directions were in full foliage; the birds seemed to realize that it was spring; there was a profusion of flowers all about, and the cotton was being chopped out to a stand. W hile we sat there drinking in the beauty of the springtime, who should come along but Shovlin, his pack upon his back, walking with his vigorous swinging stride. “ H o, there, Shovlin,” my father greeted him. “ G lad to see you. Put down your pack and rest a while.” Shovlin, all smiles and laughter, put down his pack and sat be­ neath the tree. “ H ow are the neighbors’ crops?” my father inquired. “ A nd what news do you bring from your travels?” Shovlin cleared his throat with considerable ceremony. “ M r. Roper,” he began, “ the most impressive thing for me this beautiful day are the lessons Nature is trying to teach— the lessons of the warm and friendly sunlight— the song of the mocking bird— the beauty of the flowers— the deep sentiment of the Negro spiritual as he hoes the corn and cotton. A h, M r. Roper, as I hear and see all this— I feel in my own heart the operations of D ivinity.” M y father had listened attentively. H e was silent for a moment, and then he replied, “ Shovlin, as little as you and others may think it, I, too, sometimes feel the operations of the H o ly Spirit upon my soul.” Now as a child I had never heard the word “ operate” used ex­ cept in a medical way. N early every motherly woman, white and black, who came along would tell my father that I was suffering from the only known childhood disease, worms. An important remedy administered to me was Jerusalem Oak seed and molasses, a terrible dose. Frequently after I had taken it they would ask just how it “ operated.” The good Shovlin was so enraptured with the beauties of nature that he had scarcely heard my father, while I had hung upon his every word. “ Look, M r. Roper,” Shovlin said, making a grand ges­ ture toward the cotton fields and the near-by flowers, then pointing upward to the bright sun. “ H ow magnificent!” And turning back to us, he asked, “ W hat causes these things?” Io FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE It seemed to be my turn to speak, and he was now looking at me. I turned to my father. ‘T i l tell you, father,” I said, “ I believe it’s worms that’s operating on you.” This well-nigh sacrilegious announcement provoked the full depths of Shovlin’s Irish sense of humor. H e literally rolled upon the ground, so hearty was his laughter, and as he rolled, he said, “ M r. Roper, I believe the boy is right.” H e was never to forget the incident, and for a long while thereafter I was to be reminded that I should keep religion and “ worms” separated. In those days of remote towns and inns, it was an unwritten law in our home that no one would be charged for a night’s lodging. Shovlin usually stayed with us on his trips, and he always managed to leave behind some choice piece of linen, or other item admired by my stepmother, in payment for his lodging. The plantation upon which I was born contained five hundred acres, a part of which was woodland, the remainder in pasturage or cultivation. It was located midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the mountains, about one hundred miles from Charlotte and a like distance from Wilmington. This immediate section had soil of the sandy loam variety with a clay subsoil. Thus, the land, unlike that in some other sections of the South, was easily improved and lent itself readily to general farming. That made it unnecessary to de­ pend entirely upon cotton. But the cotton influence was powerful, and it was the money crop of practically every planter in our section of the Carolinas. About one hundred Negroes, many of whom had come through the war period with our people, lived and worked upon our planta­ tion. They were among the happiest people I have ever known, far happier in their modest cabins than the plutocrat of today in his palace. They lived, worked, and sang in amazing harmony. The home proper— I was grown before I heard the word “ resi­ dence” — had been built by my grandfather. It was painted white; the design was semicolonial, a little like the Dutch colonial archi­ tecture of today. A story and one half in height, its expansive breadth extended in two wings with a spacious piazza across the front. One entered the house by either of two doors at left and right, there being no center hall. These doors were never locked. The rooms of the house were large, two having open fires, and there was a chimney OLD PLANTATION DAYS ii at each end. T he house was spacious, comfortable, and homelike. For a growing boy it was a sheltered place to spend childhood, and it was only a few miles from the L ittle Peedee River, known as a good fishing stream. There was scarcely a time of the day or night when our planta­ tion did not resound with music. T h e colored mammies sat in the cabin doors and sang to their kinky-headed pickaninnies; all sang in the cotton and corn fields. Once my father said, uY ou don’t have to watch the Negroes work when you can hear them sing. But when the singing stops, you’d better take a look and see what the trou­ ble is.” In 1877, or when I was ten, we bought our first kerosene lamp. M y parents regarded it as dangerous, and they carefully warned me against having too much to do with it. About this time, however, a traveling “ fake” came along with a yellow powder which he guar­ anteed would, when mixed with the kerosene, make the lamp abso­ lutely harmless. M oreover, the lamp would never explode. M y good stepmother, always wishing to protect me, bought a quantity ° f it, and thereafter I was permitted to get a little nearer the lamp. At the time we paid twenty-five cents a gallon for kerosene. I have always felt a little more kindly towards John D . Rockefeller because fiis activities brought fuel oil down to about one fourth the price it was when I was a boy. In those post-bellum days matches were exceedingly scarce. I was charged with the duty of keeping the fires, including the chop­ ping of wood. W e paid a quarter for a wooden box containing about two dozen matches, or about the same amount as for a gallon of oil. Our home being seven miles from the nearest town, when the match supply was exhausted and we had no coals of fire, it became necessary to borrow fire. I was sent to one of the neighboring homes for a burning “ chunk” of oak or hickory. Sometimes I obtained two “ fire rocks.” By striking them together, creating friction, over a handful of fleecy lint cotton, I learned how to create fire. This was a great discovery. It prompted my first reflections on geology. In the early years I played with the darky children, there being no white child near by, and, too, I liked them better as playmates. They respected me. Their mothers and fathers insisted that they do so, with the consequence that I was a privileged character, looked i 2 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE up to and loved by them. A ll the Negroes were deeply religious, and the fervor of their faith in God was something never to be forgotten. On warm summer nights in religious revival days they could be heard praying as far as a mile away. Their religious meetings fre­ quently broke into manifestations of sublime ecstasy. One of the older Negroes, Uncle Ben we called him, used to pray nightly from his cabin. H e prayed so earnestly and with such feeling that his neighbors and any who chanced to hear him could not resist the temptation to linger and listen to his invocations. The theme of his prayer usually took the turn of an entreaty to God to come and get him, to descend and take him home to Heaven. H e avowed that he had had enough trials and tribulations. H e told God he wanted to be “ transferred.” A group of the colored boys had ac­ cumulated upon his threshold one night when he was praying with more energetic fervor than usual. H e at last came to the point where he called upon God to come and “ transfer” him at once. Then one of the boys rapped upon his door. “ W ho’s dat?” he called. His voice trembled with fear and emotion. “ It’s the Lord,” the boy replied. “ The Lord you’ve been prayin’ to.” In a flash the old darky replied, “ You needn’t come in, Lawd! There ain’t nobody home.” M any of the Negroes believed in the power of conjuring. Whether or not this faith in the so-called magic is an importation from the jungles of Africa, or whether a ramification of voodooism, or some of the old strange cults that obsess tribal peoples in various parts of the world today, I cannot say. Fundamentally, it bore strik­ ing similarity to some of the isms prevalent among modern whites. The imported conjure doctor of plantation days was an individual to be embraced and feared at one and the same time. His influence among the darkies was widespread. Once my father wanted to get rid of a Negro with whom he had disagreed. H e gave him a certain length of time in which to move. One day in the very next week, I walked out of our house to see a strange Negro who was circling it at intervals. His behavior was weird and mystifying. H e did not act like an ordinary home Negro, and I had never seen him before. W ho could he be, and what was he doing? H e wore Sunday clothes: a long coat and an unusual type of hat. H e did not appear to notice me, but began a slow tour of the house, mumbling his words as he walked. At one OLD PLANTATION DAYS i3 corner when he had completed the round, he paused a moment, then started upon a second encirclement. By now my childish curiosity had been whetted to fever heat. Still, I could see no sign or overt act upon the stranger’s part which gave cause for alarm. It was per­ haps his third trip around the house when I saw him stop at the steps of one of the entrances and, taking a small package from his pocket, place it carefully under the steps. A fter that he went away. I ran immediately to a near-by cabin where I knew there was a young colored boy whom I could trust. I told him what I had seen and asked him to investigate. H e promised to do so. T h e next day he reported to me. This stranger, he learned, was a conjure doctor, one who performed mysterious acts that none could fathom or explain. The package he had placed under the steps contained conjure medi­ cine. The conjure specialist had been retained by the disagreeable tenant, and the doctor had placed the conjure medicine beneath the steps so that my father would walk over it. In so doing, according to the theories of conjure, my father would be influenced in favor of the tenant he had ordered to leave. T he package contained blood­ stained rags and grain, probably a form of religious sacrifice. M y father laughed good-naturedly when I told him what had taken place. But the remarkable outcome was that he re-employed the Negro and let him stay on. I teased him about it for years, sug­ gesting on later occasions that he avail himself of conjure, when some dilemma presented itself. H e, of course, denied its efficacy. Y et, even today, one wonders if, to some extent, conjure is not sometimes called into play by materia medica. Our Negroes were believers in ghosts, but could never convince me- H ere is an illustration. A Negro excitedly advised that he had seen a ghost. H e was asked to describe the ghost. H is answer was as Allow s: “ I know it was a ghost because when I reached out to touch it, it wasn’t there, and when the ghost reached out for me, I wasn’t there!” In those times a religious “ protracted” meeting was being held ln South Carolina, and the preacher was making great appeals to arouse his congregation. H e said in the course of his propositions: M l of those who wish to go to H ell rise.” No one rose. “ A ll those who wish to go with me to Heaven rise.” No one rose. H e then said: “ W hat is the matter with you people? Are you stone deaf?” I4 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE One man rose in the audience and said: “ W e do not wish to go to either of them places. W e are satisfied right here.” M y father was typically English and a Roper through and through. H e was five feet ten and weighed a hundred and sixty pounds. Because of his merry, witty manner, he had many friends. H e took a leading part in the community endeavors, more especially the long fight for self-government in the 1870’s, of which more later. H e had dark hazel eyes that danced when he spoke, and, always radiating good will and cheer, he early became a local leader in the common cause. In the year 1876, I remember distinctly that we had a surplus of one thousand dollars after the sale of our cotton. M y father was in the W ade Hampton campaign solely to help free the state from oppression. H e gave every cent of our savings to this campaign, going “ on time” for our supplies until the next crop. H e himself was not musical, yet I never met a man who was fonder of listening to good music. The Scottish song services were events in those days. They were held at a different home each week, and always under the direction of a singing master. The singing was performed in the old-time do-re-me-fa-so-la-ti-do manner, yet it was surpassingly beautiful and satisfying. Many were the splendid voices in the community, and while the fiddle was the most prominent in­ strument, the banjo and the guitar were popular among the darkies. W hat has ever been more beautiful than to sit upon the broad piazza of a plantation home on a warm summer night, breathing soft breezes scented with magnolia and jasmine, with millions of stars in the sky and the whole countryside mellow with moonlight, the darkies plain­ tively singing and strumming their banjos and guitars, accompanying voices of deep-throated bass and silver tenor singing the old songs that enlarged the heart and graced the gentler days of our country’s history? H ow thankful I am for the influence of such a hallowing environment. CHAPTER II T he Three R 's Y F A T H E R was not educated in the approved sense of the word as used today, modern education being a rarity among the pioneers who then lived in the Carolinas. It was the heyday of the three R ’s— reading, ’riting, and ’rithmetic. One who knew his three R ’s and knew them well was considered to have enough education for all practical purposes. But my father, who had an astonishingly retentive memory for history, was a vora­ cious reader of all the good books available to him. Alexander H . Stephens was his favorite American historian, and he virtually mem­ orized the Stephens history, being able to quote pages and pages of it when conversation turned upon the events it chronicled. H e was especially accurate when relating items of history pertaining to the Civil W ar. M In retrospect it seems little short of amazing that my father ac­ quired so high a degree of understanding from his limited oppor­ tunities. But in his modest way, he was a scholar. H e was particu­ larly fond of the Jewish historian, Josephus. I remember that one of his first arguments to me concerned the divinity of Christ. H e quoted from Josephus: “ Christ was a marvelous man, if it be proper to call him a man.” And he considered this a great admission by a historian who, although rejecting the Nazarene, was almost one of his contemporaries. T h e Bible, of course, was in every Southern home— even in many cases in the homes of Negroes who could neither read nor write. E arly in my childhood, my father bought a New Testament of large print. Each of the chapters began with a large capital letter. I learned my A B C ’s from them. Perhaps the next most valued book of the house was the bio­ graphical volume, Lossing’s Em inent Americans. M any winter nights my father sat beside the open fire and read aloud from it. !6 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE W hat exciting episodes and worthy human achievements this book unfolded! It brought to life a whole pageant of heroes: Washington, O ld Hickory, the gentle Lee, and the dashing, death-defying Stone­ wall Jackson. They stirred my plastic imagination. Then there was the dramatic account of the capture of M ajor Andre with his dis­ grace. Father would stop to explain how the papers which con­ demned the M ajor were discovered in his boots. “ Those papers,” declared my father, “ are in the State Library at Albany, New York. Some day, son, if you ever have the chance, go and see them.” As was to be expected, one who had served four years in the Confederacy was intrigued by the life of Napoleon. It was an age in which military prowess was glorified, and my father read and talked much of the life and campaigns of Bonaparte. Frequently a tinge of sentiment entered these discussions, for he deeply sympa­ thized with Josephine, Napoleon’s unfortunate wife. More interest­ ing, however, both to him and to me, were his accounts of the career and alleged execution of the colorful Marshal Ney. This part of the discussion always brought us to the absorbing mystery which en­ shrouded the end of Ney. M y father held with those who did not believe that the French officer was executed. This school credited the report that the old army friends of the Marshal, who were charged with the duty of putting him to death, had spirited their former commander to safety — that he had escaped on the eve of his scheduled execution and had come to America. Definitely, it had been established that a strangeacting Frenchman had made his appearance in North Carolina not long after the supposed execution, and this newcomer had organized a school. M y father placed the location of the school at about one hundred miles from the farm where he was born. There were rec­ ords in my father’s possession which showed that the age and de­ scription of the mysterious teacher tallied closely with those of M ar­ shal Ney. And these old records also disclosed that the Frenchman became visibly agitated when the name of Napoleon was mentioned in his presence. Moreover, upon his deathbed, the teacher’s last words to his physician bore out the theory of his identity, for they indicated that he had once been associated with Napoleon. A ll this was fascinating and absorbing to my childish mind. I was taught respect for books and an appreciation of their in- THE THREE R’s 17 estimable value. W e had in our home, also, fragmentary works of Shakespeare and Francis Bacon. T he second mystery to which I was introduced was the question of whether or not Bacon wrote Shake­ speare. T h e controversy was fresh and spirited in this period, but my father did not become a partisan. Other books we had were his­ tories of some of the Southern states, broken sets of Tennyson and Longfellow , H istory of the O ld Cheraws , covering our segment of the Carolinas, and that book without which no home library, how­ ever small, was complete— Pilgrim ’s Progress. M y father knew these books amazingly well. Y et, one day when he was quoting Shake­ speare to a group of friends, I questioned him. “ Aren’t you afraid,” I whispered, “ you’ll make a mistake— misquote?” H is reply was characteristic of his unfailing sense of humor. “ Son,” he said, “ I never quote Shakespeare before people who know anything about Shakespeare.” H e had me there. W ith this background I was constantly being prepared by my father for the day when I would start to school. It was a deplor­ able fact that the schools of the period were ungraded and loosely conducted. The public school money seldom lasted more than sixty days. A fter it was exhausted, those parents who could afford to do so supported privately organized schools. A central location would be chosen by the better-off residents of the community and a special teacher employed to conduct the continuation school. M y father always supported these privately financed extensions, and when the time came he took a daily interest in my school progress. H e wanted me to be better equipped for life than he had been, but neither of us knew the best course of study to pursue. That, in my father’s opinion, was a matter for the guidance of the teachers. And I was destined to be most fortunate in this important respect. M y kinsman and devoted friend, T . B. Stackhouse, a graduate of W offord College, was my first schoolteacher. H e boarded at our house, and together we walked a mile to the one-room schoolhouse, where about thirty boys and girls congregated for the fundamentals of education. I was between seven and eight years of age when this schooling began. An amazing incident of the experience still lingers in my mind. In this school term a youngster named Dargan M cDaniel entered our school from another district. H e, it seemed, was not taking his 18 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE education seriously. Noting his obvious indolence, M r. Stackhouse descended upon him one morning. “ Dargan,” he declared threaten­ ingly, “ you aren’t studying! Now get this straight j if you don’t get down to work, I ’m going to thrash you!” The rest of us were all eyes and ears, but the redoubtable Dargan was by no means abashed. “ M r. Stackhouse,” he replied drolly and almost in a note of utter hopelessness, “ I can save you trouble there. M y last teacher, M r. Stafford, he tried that. It didn’t do any good.” The laughter throughout the room was unrestrained until we were called to order. I was eleven when M r. Stackhouse founded another school at Red Bluff on the Little Peedee River. The new school was four miles from our home. There were frequent rains, chilly winter winds, and muddy roads, but, notwithstanding the terrors of the ele­ ments and the impediments of formidable mud puddles, I walked to and from school each day. The school money ran out as usual, but those parents who could afford the cost chipped in, and M r. Stackhouse was retained. In those days the teacher would sometimes board in the homes of his pupils. Naturally we had summer vacations. M y father believed in hard work, but we found time for some swimming and hunting and fish­ ing. W e had no daily papers, but any important item of news quickly found its way to us by the relay system. One of these instances in which news came by messenger is clear in my mind. I was a boy of fourteen, swinging on the front gate. Suddenly I heard the clatter of hoofs and looked up the road to see a neighbor galloping toward our house. H e reined his mount as he drew nearer; then, shouting in an excited voice, he said: “ T h e President’s been killed! Garfield! H e’s dead!” H e rode on, like Paul Revere of old, to inform the rest of the community. T he assassination had occurred the day before, July 2, 1 881. It made a profound impression upon me. I did not see how the nation could continue without its president. Indeed, I was actually surprised the next morning to find that the sun rose as usual, that the flowers were still blooming, that the pleasant country­ side was calm and serene. I had spent a restless night. ii Childhood passes quickly, leaving recollections that seem to have been episodes of a fantasy. I was fourteen now, ready for my pre­ paratory work at the Laurinburg, North Carolina, H igh School. For THE THREE R’s i9 me entrance that fall to this new school, with its enrollment of one hundred and twenty-five students, was a major event. It was the first time I had lived away from home, and it gave me the feeling that at last I was more or less on my own. M y closest friend, Julius Lane, who lived near me and had been a comrade from early childhood, went to Laurinburg at the same time. H e furnished a buggy, and I had the privilege of borrowing a mule from my uncle, Colonel James Turner Roper, who lived at Laurinburg. Thus, Julius and I were able to drive home on Fridays, coming back in time for school on Monday mornings. In this way we saved board money. This was fortunate. W hile treated to a new and broadening mode of life in which I was in contact with fellow students from other sections, I, at the same time, remained under my own home influence. The school was conducted upon a high plane. W illiam G. Quakenbush, of Orange County, North Carolina, was its principal. H is three capable assistants, all men of strong Christian character, were instructors who taught with unrelenting zeal, at all times seeking to inspire us with a heartfelt desire for knowledge and its blessings. They made us dig into the very core of every subject. W e had to learn. There was no respectable alternative. No boy who ever went to school to Professor Quakenbush would ever forget him. H e was a one-legged man, a little stooped because he was continually on crutches. One of his legs had been amputated in childhood after he had been bitten by a jackass. H e never smoked, but he chewed cigars continually. I thought this the height of extravagance. M r. Quakenbush taught Latin and Greek and supervised the school. The community loved him wholeheartedly because he en­ tered into the work and spirit of so many of its activities. There was no end to the man’s energy, and his benevolent and wise philosophy was always an inspiration. But he was not easygoing. I f anything, he was on the austere side, ever insisting upon more work and study. H e lost no opportunity to impress the importance of character in the making of a gentleman. I often wondered how one small head could hold all he knew. I boarded with my uncle, who loaned Julius and me a mule on week-ends. Uncle Turner was approximately twelve years older than my father and, likewise, a veteran of the Confederate Army. H e, too, took an active interest in my schoolwork. W e frequently 20 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE took walks, during which he questioned and advised me. W hen in the mood he told me experiences from his own interesting life. One of these concerned D avy Crockett, hero of the Alamo, whose motto, “ Be sure you are right, then go ahead,” had swept the country. I had read a great deal about Davy Crockett. I knew the background of his pioneer days, his hunting exploits, his oddities both at home and in Washington. H is last great adventure during the Texas Revolution against the Mexicans, that brave death struggle that brought his tragic end in the massacre at the Alamo, had aroused me as had no other bit of American history up to that time. W hen Uncle Turner told me that he had once met Crockett, I pressed him for details. H e cheerfully supplied them. As a boy of fifteen, Uncle Turner had once stayed overnight in Raleigh. Early in the evening he had gone out upon the public square to see a bear which one of the natives had captured and was exhibit­ ing in an enclosure near the statehouse. W hile looking at the bear, who should walk up but D avy Crockett. A small coterie was already following the popular idol to observe him at close range. M y uncle joined them. Crockett, according to my uncle, was all that he had been pictured and described by the press. A striking, powerful figure, the Tennesseean wore his celebrated coonskin cap. And, to the delight of the crowd, he began making witty remarks about the bear, soon drifting into accounts of some of his own hunting expe­ riences in the Appalachian Mountains. H e said that, upon his first return from Washington to his home, several of his constituents wanted to know what the people of the capital were like. H e had answered by telling them that the chief difference was the way in which they ate their meals. “ For instance,” Crockett said, “ they have breakfast when the sun is one or two hours high, or when you fel­ lows have done practically a half a day’s work. About one or two o’clock in the day they have what they call lunch, and ’way in the night, they have their dinner.” When a constituent asked, “ Davy, when do they eat their supper?” Crockett had told them, “ They don’t get that until the next day.” in In the summer of 1884 father wished to send me to Wofford College. Money was scarce, and knowing his stringent financial con­ aH H H H B THE THREE R’s 2i dition, that he was having to borrow to defray my expenses, I spent the summer selling a book, The Pathway of Life. This house-tohouse canvassing took me far and wide in Marlboro County. I cleared fifty dollars for the summer’s work. And how proud I was! It was enough to outfit me, including a new suit, shoes, and hat. I bought the clothes from a merchant who was an old friend of the family. It was gratifying to be able to pay cash. I looked forward to the day when I would wear them to college. T he W offord term opened on October 7. I had to journey two days and part of a night to get to Spartanburg, which, as the crow flies, is only about one hundred and twenty-five miles from my home. I went to Laurinburg by buggy, thence via the old Carolina Central Railroad, now the Seaboard Airline, to Charlotte. A fter a consider­ able delay at the latter city for train connections, I went on to my destination via the Richmond and Danville, now the Southern Rail­ road. A t last, grim y with cinders, exhausted from the shakings and careenings of the rattling, puffing “ modern” train, almost overcome by the heat, and suffering agony from my new shoes, I reached Spar­ tanburg. One almost had to be a Spartan to stand the journey. W offord was on the outskirts of this quiet and peaceful old town, and my first impressions of it, as I set foot upon the still green cam­ pus, were distinctly reverential. Other young men were sauntering singly and in groups across the grassy plain, coming and going at the entrance of the imposing buildings, which, flanked by five or six attractive brick residences, stood at the end of a long walk. I noted the sturdy oak trees and the shady pine grove. There was no great hustle and bustle; rather it seemed as if the half leisurely movements of the W offord students were guided by a sense of confident purpose. The atmosphere was one of dignity and quaint charm. I liked it from the start. I determined to make the most of my opportunity and privilege in being there. T he details of matriculation did not take long. I presented cre­ dentials, and a member of the faculty helped me to select the sub­ jects I was to pursue. A room was assigned, and I became a fullfledged student of W offord. Those first few days at college were filled with the activity of orientation, making new friends and assid­ uous application to my books. Just one unfortunate circumstance marred those first days. M y new shoes were killing me. Unfortu­ 22 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE nately, I had no others. Nor could I exchange them, for I was many miles from the store in which I had bought them. It was an impasse. But a sadder feature of the shoes, of which I did not learn until several weeks had passed, was not that they hurt my feet. Purchase of the new outfit had been a first experience at “ trad­ ing” or shopping with the particular merchant from whom they were bought, although he was a good friend of the Roper family. I had paid cash. Imagine my chagrin and resentment upon learning that he had charged the whole outfit to my father’s account at his store. O f course, it was not intentional fraud j the man was notoriously careless in his business methods. Nevertheless, I had lost the money for which I had worked and walked and talked so hard in the blaz­ ing summer heat. The incident was a rude shock, one which afforded a valuable lesson for all the future. It awakened me to the impor­ tance of using bank checks in paying bills and of getting receipts where they were paid in cash. This shock and hardship disturbed my sleep for several nights. A t W offord I rose early, just as I had back home, usually taking a walk. I had been there but a few days when, one morning along the woods path just off the campus, I met the President, Dr. James Henry Carlisle. H e was a man six feet four inches tall with long, flowing hair, moustache, and beard, and large intelligent eyes that were deep-set and penetrating. H e paused as we were about to pass. “ Good morning, young man,” he said. “ A fine morning.” “ Good morning, sir,” I returned. “ It is indeed.” H e stood looking at me a moment or so, and then he said, “ I wonder if you have a special thought for this fine day.” In all honesty I had to confess that I did not have any particular thought, and I was slightly embarrassed because his mighty presence overawed me. H e did not seem the least bit surprised. “ Let me suggest to you,” he said, “ that you never leave your room in the morning without having one. It will keep you encouraged and bal­ anced. Since you don’t have one today, let me give you one.” “ Yes, sir,” I said in some confusion, while he regarded me with close scrutiny. “ The way you approach people in early life,” he declared, “ will decide your destiny. Since there are only two ways of approach­ ing people, it is very important that you consider them and make no mistake. One way is negative, the other positive. Under the nega­ THE THREE R’s 23 tive, you approach people suspiciously, impressing upon them that you lack faith and confidence in them. Y ou will not get their co­ operation and you w ill fail. U nder the positive, you w ill approach people with confidence and faith that will prompt them to believe in you and follow you. Y ou w ill thereby establish confidence, co-opera­ tion, and leadership, and you w ill succeed.” W ith those words, D r. Carlisle bowed and passed on. I was never to forget them. M any times they would serve me w ell in afterlife. But that early morning meeting was just a beginning, a preliminary taste of the rich philos­ ophy that w elled from his unquenchable fountain of wisdom. H e taught you to think and not to “ keep on talking after you had stopped thinking.” . On another occasion, he said, “ Ponder on this: Confidence is a plant of slow growth. M ind how you cultivate and protect it.” T h e consideration of those words brought the whole credit system to my mind. I resolved to live within my means, but when obliged to have credit, vigorously to strive to protect the obligations it entailed. T h e world did not owe me a living unless 1 gained the confidence of others and co-operated with them in the correct way to live. M oreover, his words gave me new breadth of thought, lifting me to a higher plane. Sectionalism had no place in a nation composed of individuals, with business so interdependent and interrelated. D r. Carlisle, I soon found, was an institution within himself, the very backbone of W offord, the inspiration of every boy. W h ile his specialty was mathematics, at the end of each recitation period he would have us lay aside our books and tell him what we thought we had learned that day under the other professors. H e was much interested in etymology, or the derivation of words. Each day every­ body in the class tried to bring a new word for discussion. One day M r G regg, a member of the class, was asked what he had learned from his Latin professor. “ Doctor,” he answered, “ I have been thinking of the word restaurant. I haven’t pursued the word fully, but I am suggesting, sir, that the analysis of the word is this: Res, meaning thing; and taurus, meaning bull. Hence, a restaurant is a bully thing!” D r. Carlisle did not criticize the young man, but while the rest of us laughed heartily, he merely smiled and said, “ I sug­ gest, M r. G regg, that you take that up tomorrow with your Latin professor.” 22 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE nately, I had no others.

One which made a lasting impression upon me was: “ While you are planning to spend a dollar foolishly, your parents are planning how to save a dollar that you may stay in college.” At the beginning of this, my freshman year, I helped to organize an eating club among classmates which materially reduced expenses for us. There were twenty-two members of the club, and the college gave us space for a kitchen and dining room. One member was given free board for acting as steward, or buyer and supervisor. The club was a success from the outset. W e had an organ and excellent musi­ cal talent in our ranks j thus the early evening gatherings, before dinner, were occasions to which we looked forward. W e had a con­ stitution and bylaws to which each member subscribed, and regula­ tions specifying a certain hour for bedtime. It was my first experience in student government. I have never lived more happily than with that group. The amazing thing, in looking back upon it now, was that my table board cost less than ten dollars a month. The new mode of life quickened my interest in the outside world. Sectional­ ism began to fade from my horizon as a result of contacts with other young men from distant sections and in the light of intellectual growth due in a large measure to the strong influence of Dr. Carlisle. •Yet, up to now, I had not thought of any career except that of a Southern planter. There was a young man in my class, Choice Evans, whose father represented the Spartanburg District in Congress. During the Christ­ mas recess of 1884, young Evans visited his family in Washington. He returned to college with a glowing account of what he had seen and whom he had met. I found myself warmly interested despite the South’s lack of sympathy for the new national government, due to the scars of Reconstruction. Hitherto I had not thought an officer of the government to be much more than a policeman. I now began to recognize the dignity and prestige of the Federal service. Uncon­ sciously, a seed had been planted in my mind, although a number of years were to elapse before it germinated. THE THREE R’s 25 Although we had interclass sports at W offord, the large-scale intercollegiate contests which captivate the public of today were un­ thought of. I participated in some of the baseball, football, and other games, and I have since regretted that I did not take greater interest, for contests on the athletic field are as valuable in their development and instruction as the activities of the classroom. One outstanding event of that year was a hike to a hallowed spot near Spartanburg. M y father’s love of history and biography had been transmitted to me in earlier years. I recalled that the Revolutionary battlefield of Cowpens was only nine or ten miles from Spantanburg. Because of its decisiveness in contributing to the success of the Revolution, it was sometimes called the “ Bennington of the South.” It was there that 1,100 British contended against 1,000 Americans with the result that only 12 Americans were killed and 60 wounded against 800 British killed, wounded, and captured. In that first year at W offord I inquired concerning the exact location of the battlefield. Partly be­ cause I wanted to see this hallowed ground, and partly in order that I might later tell my father about it, I got together a group of friends and we hiked the rugged distance to the battlefield. T he trip was slightly disappointing because there was so little trace of the famous conflict. W e, however, identified the exact location, and all had the satisfaction of having visited the spot which had an im­ portant bearing upon American independence. M y freshman year passed quickly. By living economically, I kept my total expenses within two hundred and fifty dollars. In fact, my four years of college were to cost my father this annual amount. Summer teaching slightly supplemented it, and I taught that first summer until it was time to return to college in the fall. T h e sophomore year was to provide one of my first major trage­ dies. This event will be better understood if we bear in mind some­ thing of the mode of life at W offord. Dr. Carlisle and his staff had never engaged in a drive to swell the student body. There were only about one hundred and twenty-five students, it being his belief that the small college was the salvation and hope of the American edu­ cational system. A larger number, he thought, tended to eliminate personal contact between faculty and student. “ If the student body ever reaches two hundred and fifty,” he said, I 11 go out the back­ door.” 26 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE Nevertheless, the Wofford dormitory facilities were inadequate for this small student body. This situation was ameliorated by the kindly patronage of the good families of Spartanburg, who gladly co-operated by taking young men into their homes to board. Dr. Carlisle approved this system, since it gave the boys so provided for a home atmosphere, with all its influence in building character. Dur­ ing that first year I had gained the friendship of J. D. Williams, a classmate who came from one of the lower counties. We became very close friends, and agreed to room together upon our return the fol­ lowing autumn. Thus, in the fall of 1885, we became roommates. There are few closer relationships than that which binds common spirits as college roommates. Since each of us was a candidate for the Bachelor of Arts degree, there were times when one could assist the other. If it was a mathematical problem, or, perhaps, a translation of Latin, or some mystery attached to the fascinating study of chem­ istry with its perplexing qualitative and quantitative analysis and the stubborn unknowns, or any other of numerous things, there was al­ ways the chance that one could give the other the desired lift. We told each other our boyish secrets. W e studied together 5 we walked together; and often in the night’s darkness we lay in our separate beds, discussing the problems of our present world and speculating upon its tomorrows. I had never had a brother,1 and this new rela­ tionship— deepest friendship and trust— thrilled me. I greatly treas­ ured it. Either of us would have fought for the other. One night, early in May, 1886, J. D. came to our room after supper complaining that he did not feel well. He went to bed ear­ lier than usual. The next morning he made no move to arise when I got up at the customary time— the ringing of the college bell. He looked pale and haggard. I asked him if he intended going to classes. “ I don’t think I can make it,” he said. “ Maybe a day in bed will fix me up. You can explain to the professors.” “ What about some breakfast?” I asked him. “ Can I bring you something?” He waved down the suggestion. “ No,” he replied. “ I don’t think I care to eat.” Noting his pallor, and by now convinced that he might be sicker than he thought, I suggested calling the college physician. “ No,” he murmured, “ Go on. I’ll be all right.” 1 By my father’s marriage to Miss Lucy McColl, I had two half-sisters and two half-brothers. THE THREE R’s 27 I left J. D . with some misgivings. There were reports of typhoid fever in Spartanburg j so I determined to look in upon him as soon as my first classes were over. This I did. B y now it was apparent he had a fever and was not all right, as he had expected to be. H is eyes were dull and listless. Genuinely alarmed, I hurried to call D r. Dean. A short while later his case was diagnosed. Typhoid fever! T h e job of caring for J. D . and giving him his medicine fell largely to me, although there was never a shortage of boys who wanted to help. I commenced the long and grueling vigil. J. D . fought coura­ geously to get w ell, but the ravages of fever took daily toll of his youth and strength. H is decline was visible from day to day. Three weeks later, in our little room, I saw my beloved companion die. T he shock of it was too much for me. I collapsed, going to bed with a temperature— and the almost certain conviction that I, too, would meet a kindred fate. There happened to be another young man at W offord who came from my neighborhood in Marlboro County. John Tatum stepped into the breach and helped nurse me. I did not have the exact symp­ toms J. D . had had; so at the end of a week, D r. Dean decided to send me home. I left school on a stretcher with John Tatum accom­ panying me. D r. Carlisle went with us to the train, presenting me with a large bottle of cologne and recommending that I bathe my face with the lotion. Luckily, I reached home without senous conse­ quences. A fter a few weeks’ rest I was my old self again M y case was rediagnosed as a bilious fever induced by strain and anxiety. Fortunately, the term examinations had been passed, and, except for commencement exercises, school was over. D r. Carlisle wrote to me later. I have always treasured the memory of that letter. One thing he wrote was: “ Remember, Daniel, there is a place for you in the world.” It was his way of manifesting sympathy and encouragement, of assuring me of his continued interest. Often in later years I have taken a lesson from that letter. Recalling ten or a dozen friends, unheard-of in a year or so, I have written them. In such cases I have been amply repaid by their appreciation, their gratitude at knowing someone was interested in and thinking of them. Surely the world needs more of this brand of sympathy and encouragement. W hile in W offord College, in the autumn of 1885, I became one of the founders of the South Carolina Gamma Chapter of the Sigma 28 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE Alpha Epsilon Fraternity. I was impressed then, as I am now, by the opportunity which the fraternal spirit, whether in or out of col­ lege, has of serving humanity. Fraternities, however, need to guard against snobbishness and to stress character and scholarship. Such fraternal groups, if wisely formed, may be of advantage after col­ lege life. Some years ago, while we were crossing the ocean, an Englishman, in replying to my question as to how he liked the United States, said: “ Your people have not sufficient home centers where families and friends can gather and exchange experiences and counsel for their common good.” A fraternity wisely conducted in college and in later life might assist in satisfying this need. The fever epidemic at Spartanburg and the death of my room­ mate changed the course of my life. I was discouraged from return­ ing to Wofford. I had heard much of Trinity College in North Carolina, and my father, being biased in favor of all things North Carolinian, was not adverse to the change. So it was decided that I enter Trinity at the beginning of my junior year. On the night of August 31, 1886, I was getting my things to­ gether for the college change. M y stepmother was assisting me. Suddenly, a strange and deep rumbling came to our ears. It sounded as if some tremendous train of freight cars had bumped together. The house shook as if it might be going to collapse and fall. There was a lull, and then another violent rumbling, mightier than the first. W e were on the verge of panic. “ It’s an earthquake!” my father shouted. WP 11 bet you Florida has sunk.” It was, indeed, the Charleston earthquake, although we did not know it at the time. The rumblings died away, and my father began to explain that Flor­ ida was composed of alluvial soil reclaimed from the sea. I recalled how he had always predicted that it would sink some day. By now, however, the quake seemed to have spent itself, and we walked out upon the grounds. No appreciable damage had been done, but we were convinced that it had wreaked havoc elsewhere. A ll the Ne­ groes were agitated. They thought the end of the world had come, and we could hear them for long distances, praying. Charleston, we learned the next day, was the hardest hit, the damage there running into thousands of dollars. Shortly afterward an amusing story came to us from that city. A protracted Negro meeting was being held in the colored section of Charleston on the IV Trinity College, then in Randolph County, North Carolina, to which I transferred in the autumn of 1886, was not unlike W offord. It, too, had a high moral tone and a religious atmosphere. Its faculty maintained a close personal relationship with the student body. There I continued the same course upon which I had embarked at W offord, and there was no such memorable incident as the tragedy of my sophomore year. The senior year, however, was marked by some little change. John Franklin Crowell of ^ale was elected Pres­ ident of Trinity. It was a bold step for the trustees to take at this time. It attested the breadth of their minds and vision, for D r. Crowell was a Yankee. Considerable misgivings were felt by some of the students, but I did not share them. M y first visit to the sanctum of D r. Crowell, nevertheless, caused me to wonder if the distrustful students had not been right. Just as I began to talk to him, a strange clock in one corner of the room went into strange actions. A little bird appeared, crying “ Cuckoo! Cuckoo!” I had neither seen nor heard of a cuckoo clock. It must be a Yankee trick, I thought, an effort to embarrass or test me. I appeared not to notice it, but concluded my business with Trinity’s new President. A long time elapsed before I learned that the cuckoo clock was an innocuous innovation in the field of time­ pieces. A t this first conference I thought I sensed that D r. C iow ell was not pleased with the rural environments of the College. Soon he was frankly advocating the removal of the institution to an urban community and was quoted as saying that it must be gotten out of the woods and taken to town.” The removal of Trinity to Durham - - - . -............. night of the quake. W hen the first tremor was felt, the Negro preacher attempted to quiet and console his parishioners. But when the second prodigious rumble and shake-up came, he sprang from the pulpit and led his terrorized congregation out of the church. As he sprinted across the churchyard, a neighbor’s dog, loosed from his block but still with the chain about his neck, playfully sprang upon the colored preacher in the darkness. The preacher, panic-stricken and hysterical, yelled: “ H old on, M r. D evil! Take away them chains! I ’ll go, but I’ll go without chainin’ !” 3o FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE was accomplished before Dr. Crowell resigned the presidency. He and his successor, Dr. John C. Kilgo, enlisted the interest of Wash­ ington Duke and his sons, Benjamin N. and James B. Duke, in the support of the College; a contribution by the father made possible the removal to Durham. Through the influence of Washington Duke’s daughter, Mrs. Mary Lyon, the College admitted women as students on the same terms as men. Benjamin N. Duke took a personal interest in expanding the educational facilities of the Col­ lege during the administration of President Kilgo and enlisted in that undertaking the help of his brother. When President Kilgo was elected a Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (1910), he was succeeded by a remarkable man, then Dean of the College, the late William Preston Few, who retained the confidence of the Dukes. It was his good fortune to participate in the foundation of Duke University with the support of an Endowment set up in December, 1924, by James B. Duke; he remained at the head of the enlarged institution and before his death in 1940 had the satisfaction of seeing it recognized as one of the important universities of the country. The founder of the University, James B. Duke, was farseeing and great-hearted. In his lifetime and through the Endowment that he established he gave liberally to other colleges in the region with­ out regard to creed or color as well as to hospitals, to orphanages, and to superannuated preachers. His purposes in founding the Uni­ versity are indicated in the eighth article of the Indenture of Trust which governs his benefaction. “ I have selected Duke University as one of the principal objects of this trust,” he says, “ because I recog­ nize that education, when conducted along sane and practical as op­ posed to dogmatic and theoretical lines, is next to religion, the great­ est civilizing influence. . . . And I advise that the courses of this institution be arranged, first, with special reference to the training of preachers, teachers, lawyers, and physicians, because these are most in the public eye, and by precept and example can do most to uplift mankind, and second, to instruction in chemistry, economics and his­ tory, especially the lives of the great of earth, because I believe that such subjects will most help to develop our resources, increase our wisdom and promote human happiness.” I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in June, 1888. I returned to M arlboro County, ready, I thought, to face the world. On this point I was soon disillusioned. I had been prepared for nothing in particular. Hence, I thought of teaching at least long enough to get money for something else— probably, I thought, to read law and settle in Seattle, Washington. v Professor N . D . Johnson, one of the educators of Marlboro County, had a large consolidated school about seven miles from my home. W hen I returned from Trinity, he made me an offer to teach there, and I accepted, at a salary of forty dollars a month and my board. I had done summer teaching, but this was my first job as a regular, full-time teacher. I tried to profit from the training and lessons of my old professors, and the memories of M r. Quakenbush and D r. Carlisle served me in good stead. The important thing, I saw, was to imbue my pupils with the intrinsic desire to know for the sake of knowledge; and I was not unmindful that if I could inspire them with the proper appreciation for fundamental traits of high character I would be doing more for them than I could do by pound­ ing into them, to be repeated parrot-fashion, the contents of all the books in Christendom. A t the end of the term, but not wholly to my surprise, Professor Johnson was unable to pay my salary. M y father solved this problem by a timely suggestion. H e had me ob­ tain from M r. Johnson an order upon one of the local merchants for four hundred dollars worth of fertilizer, and bought the ordei from me. H om e life and the pleasant environs of my boyhood were still dear to me, despite the four years at college. I loved the plantation and its colored people. I loved to look in at the cabin doors and greet the friendly darkies I had known since boyhood. In conclud­ ing this phase relating to my school days, I cannot resist the tempta­ tion to recall one further incident from that period. In a year when the cotton was coming up slowly because it had been so dry all spring, my father and I went out into the fields to determine whether or not we were going to get a “ stand.” It was a bright Sunday morning in M ay. W e made such a thorough inspection of the situation, in view of the possibilities of crop failure, that we found upon looking at the time, we were too late for services at our Methodist church. T he 32 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE church was four miles away and we could not possibly get there in time. “ Too bad,” my father said. W e were starting home. Sud­ denly, he stopped. “ Tell you what, son,” he said, “ let’s go and listen to Caesar.” Caesar Munnerlyn was the colored pastor of a Baptist church at the eastern border of our plantation M y father knew that Caesar respected and liked him, for he had furnished the dusky clergyman a mule and buggy in order that he might more conveniently serve his parishioners. “ I’d like to hear him,” I replied, and we turned in the direction of the little church. The Negro services were already underway when we arrived. The church was jammed almost to ca­ pacity. Because we were the only whites, we slipped into remote seats near the rear door. Caesar was reading his text from the third chapter of St. Matthew. It referred to John the Baptist. In sten­ torian tones he read: “ And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.” H e had completed the reading before he noticed the presence of my father and me. He must have remembered the mule and buggy, for as he began to preach and refer to his text, John the Baptist became John the Methodist throughout the sermon thereafter. It is my opinion that no greater courtesy was ever exer­ cised than that of Caesar Munnerlyn, willingly sacrificing the Holy Spirit to please a white Methodist friend. CHAPTER III T he South Carolina Legislature ^ H E T R Y I N G S H A C K L E S of the carpetbagger had been cast off by the people of my state at the time I started to school. Reconstruction at the point of a bayonet 01 muzzle of T a rifle was no more, thanks to the courage of the political leaders of our era. Y et there still remained the dark fear that history might repeat itself. Against the possibility of such repetition, the whites were unified. T hey were determined to resist any movement, po­ litical or otherwise, that might bring back carpetbag and Negro domination. T he uppermost need and universal desire was for gen uine reconstruction— for improvement of the educational system, o agricultural and transportation conditions, and for honest and more economic government. T he conservative Confederate hero, General W ade Hampton, was the Reconstruction governor. The native white elements had im plicit faith in him, but as subsequent events were to determine, it was not a time for conservatism. Tillmanism, of which more ater, was beginning to rattle the bones of reform, and in time wou d sweep through the state with the speed and unleashed force of a foi est fire. T h e social and economic revolution among the farmers was in full ascendancy by 1890. As a schoolteacher, I was in direct per­ sonal relationship with families of the agricultural class. Their prob lems were never far from my doorstep. This influence, soon to be increased by even closer contact, was to determine the pattern of my future life. T h e year 1888-89 with N . D . Johnson at Pine Grove, although not very profitable from the financial view, gave me valuable expe­ rience and a degree of personal confidence. The next year was marked by another event of far more importance than money. It Was the year in which I was married. Pine Grove, the site of the 34 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE Johnson School, was a typical rural community. Life centered round the local Methodist church and the large schoolhouse. Although in the midst of the Scotch settlement, the Pine Grove center was located where the Scotch and English Quaker stock met and intermingled. When I went to Pine Grove the Reverend W ill Ford, a Wofford schoolmate, was the minister of the local Methodist church. Early in the fall of 1888, he confided that he was expecting to be married in the near future. His bride was to be Miss Julia Fletcher. “ How would you like to be my best man?” he asked. “ I would consider it an honor,” I replied. “ Then it’s agreed,” he said, and he went on to tell me that Miss Lou McKenzie, whom I had not met, was to be Miss Fletcher’s maid of honor. Miss McKenzie was Miss Fletcher’s cousin. Upon being introduced to Miss McKenzie, my reactions were similar to those of any other young man who realizes he does not care to look farther in the selection of a wife. Miss McKenzie’s mother had been a warm friend of my own mother, and the families were well acquainted. She lived four miles north of Pine Grove, while I lived seven miles to the south. Those being the horse and buggy days, young men vied with one another as to who could present himself in the smartest rig, whether horse or mule drawn. M y rig was by no means among the best; in fact, it was quite poor. Furthermore, we wrote very few letters and did not meet oftener than at monthly intervals. Our friendship, however, deepened and flowered into the state still known as love. I appreciated more a definition of love suggested by a friend at Wofford, “ an inward inexpressibility of an outward all overishness.” About this time my father gave me a bit of advice, unconsciously describing Miss McKenzie. “ When you select a wife,” he said, “ make sure she is the daughter of a mother of high ideals. And look to it that her mother has a practical personality that will impress upon the daughter both personal and domestic virtues.” I told him I had found her, and he was soon to acknowledge her as such. Miss Mc­ Kenzie and I were married on Christmas Day, 1889, exactly fifty-two years ago as this is being written. From serious challenges and difficult problems of the past, I felt that I was taking a rather hazardous step in marrying before ade­ quately preparing for the support of a wife. I was a poorly paid THE SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE 35 schoolteacher, and she was engaged in teaching a very small school in order to accumulate sufficient funds to repay a note which she had given a friend to cover her college expenses. I was encouraged to make the step, however, by two things. First, I found our ideas on the practical approach to life to be very similar, and we were in thor­ ough understanding of each other’s condition j namely, that we had nothing. Further, our objectives in life were similar, and we both had good health. _ Our plan for the future covered the following points, which believed made it possible for two people with a thorough understan ing of each other’s purposes, and a thorough conviction of the neces sity of co-operation, to win through. Each was to understand the nan cial situation of the other, and to try and save something from w at ever we earned, however small that amount might be. W e believed this would protect us from extravagance and encourage co-operation. As a part of this we were to create a home environment of happiness which would attract to that home, however poor, people engage in sound objectives in life. This would give us the advantage 0 co operative endeavors from the outside. Furthermore, any chil ren that we might have would be assisted in their development^ as we would, through contacts with worth-while people with genuine o jectives. W e would strive to gain the confidence of our fellows through correct living and thus interest other people in helping us to find the way of life, and incidentally assist in protecting us rom the “ wild horses” of life. This involved good w ill toward others and a helpful attitude in controlling selfishness and greed. W e wou strive not to acquire riches except sufficient to feed and equip wit a practical education our children so that they would not become a charge on the community. These objectives having been attaine , we would strive to have a comfortable home, paid for, t e environ ment of which would be attractive to our children and friends. As I have said, the year with N. D . Johnson was not pro ta e, but it gave me a wider acquaintanceship throughout the county, an I saw the fruits of my efforts in the reaction of some of the patrons of the school. I was requested by the people of my home commu­ nity, seven miles away, to consolidate six small schools in that, oca ity and form an academy to be put into operation the following } ear. This I did with the efficient aid of Daniel J. Currie, a recent honor 36 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE graduate from the University of North Carolina. This consolidated school or academy was located at Tatum, just two miles from the plantation where I was born. It was to Tatum that I took my bride, and we boarded with one of her cousins, a lovable man, Dr. John C. McKenzie, the physician of the community. The consolidation of the small schools and the responsibility for the new institution were to prove a great strain. Chief of the difficul­ ties was the grading, or proper assignment, of students, many of whom had previously had different and often inconsistent textbooks. I knew something of this from my experience at Laurinburg High School. I recalled that on my arrival there a teacher had asked what grammar I had studied. “ Smith’s Grammar ” I had told him. He threw up his hands in a gesture of disgust. “ Forget about it,” he said, “ and forget everything you learned from it.” At Tatum, I met these problems as best I could. Mrs. Roper taught a group of very young students not sufficiently advanced to be classified in the acad­ emy. Her advice helped to solve the many problems occasioned by the responsibility for one hundred and twenty-five students. We had our hands full. Life in the home of Dr. McKenzie was very pleasant. He was a kindly man of the old school of gracious manner, benevolent, with the genuine sympathy of the country doctor of those bygone days. H e entered into every community activity, but he had one fault. Out of that fault I learned a valuable lesson, one never to be forgotten. Soon after moving to his home, a few hundred yards from the acad­ emy, I saw one morning that he was in a rather dilapidated physical condition. He was haggard and his eyes were red. In a jocular way, I said, “ Doctor, you’ve had too many drinks. How does this com­ port with your eldership in the Presbyterian church?” H e stared at me while he collected his thoughts. Finally he spoke. “ Young man,” he said, “ you have caught me at an eddy. Let me illustrate to you how unfair and how narrow it is to judge a man at an eddy.” Here he paused and extended one hand in the direction of the river, about fifteen miles away. “ Go with me,” he resumed, “ in your imagination to the Pee Dee River. You will prob­ ably approach the river at a point where some object has turned the course of the stream, creating an eddy. If you were to judge the river at this point, you would say it is flowing east. But if you were THE SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE 37 wise enough, you would wait to make up your mind about the course of the river, until you examined it an another point. A t that point, though, the stream would probably have encountered another eddy and would be flowing west. Now, you should be wise enough to go to a near-by cliff, where you could see the full course of the river. You would from that point see that the stream was not running east — not running west— but flowing due south. W h y can’t you be as careful and liberal in examining the full course of the stream of my life? And why can’t you acknowledge with all my faults that the volume of the stream is consistent and onward— in the interest of the best and not the worst of life?” I have since tnanked the good doctor many times for that lesson. 11 From the time we were married, Mrs. Roper and I dreamed of a home of our own. W e often discussed it at length. Together we planned and gradually arrived at a harmonious conclusion of what we could make of it without anything to buy the land or build the house, except energy and faith. James B. Breeden, the wea t lest man in the county, was a friend of my father. I knew that he some times loaned money on mortgages. W ith everything to gam an nothing to lose, I went to him. I told him that we wishe to uy eighty-three acres of land for twenty-two hundred and fifty dollars. H e studied me gravely and in silence. “ I have no money, went on. “ T h e only security I can offer, besides the mortgage, is my c ar acter and reputation in the community. I will insure my li e or enough to cover the loan. If I live, I firmly believe I can pay or the land and insurance. If I die, the insurance will repay the oan^ W hile he hesitated, I told him that my wife and I hoped to make the farm self-sustaining, though I expected to supplement my income by writing some life insurance. It was a happy moment w en e nodded his head and told me that he would make the loan. ^ But, he added, “ I ’ll have to charge you 10 per cent interest.’ hair enough,” I told him, for at the time the rate did not seem exorbitant. I requested that I be given five years to repay the loan. I feared his heavy drinking might destroy him within five years and that is ^ eirs would clamp down on me. H e generously said: “ I shall be willing to give you the five years, and you go and get D . D . M cColl, 1 resi- 38 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE dent of the Bank of Marlboro, to draw the papers.” This I did. In the next few days we purchased eighty-three acres on the same road as my father’s home and about two miles away. Father then gave us ninety-three acres on the opposite side of the road from our pur­ chase. W e then had one hundred and seventy-six acres. The problem was now the building of a house. It was solved by my father giving me the lumber and brick. The first contractor to whom I presented the problem was a friend, Joshua Parker. He proved to be too skeptical. “ How much do you propose to pay for this house?” Parker wanted to know. “ Just what I can earn while you are building it,” I replied. He shook his head. “ I’m sorry,” he said, “ you’ll have to excuse me. I don’t think I want the job on that basis.” There was nothing more to be said, and I sought out another contractor. This time it was William McCollum, of Scotch stock. He took the construction job, which cost eight hundred and fifty dollars, father and I furnishing all materials. I was fortunate enough to make that amount of money during the several months of the home’s construction. O f the old Dutch Colonial style, the house had one story, a porch on three sides, a center hall entrance, four large rooms in the main part of the house, and an ell containing dining room and kitchen. Mrs. Roper and I moved into the house during the autumn of 1890, at the height of the Tillman agitation for agricultural reform and almost coincidental with the date when the Tillman forces were swept into control of South Carolina’s state government. I bought the farm when the price of cotton was about ten cents a pound and mortgaged it for the full amount at 10 per cent interest. By the time the first interest was due, cotton was four cents a pound, and I could not pay the interest. In the meantime, our first baby had arrived and I saw no way to provide for the family. This was a terrible shock for me and came near embittering me with the “ mills of the Gods.” I resigned as teacher of the academy at the end of the first year, June, 1890. The strain of the work was undermining my health, and I felt the need for more life out of doors. In giving up the work, I derived satisfaction from the accomplishment of that year. Not the least of these achievements was the successful training of a group TH E SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE 39 of hand-picked young men in the art of oratory. Nine in the group competed at commencement time for a gold medal. I cannot recall a finer exhibition. Their training and development were to help them in later years. One of the nine is today Superintendent of Education in Marlboro County, South Carolina. Another is a prominent citizen of Riverside, California. A third became a state senator in Oklahoma and died in that service. A fourth is a member of the Supreme Court of Arizona. A ll nine made their marks in the world. I do not take credit for their success, but I believe that their enthusiastic initiation in that academy, and the personal attention given them, contributed to their future destinies. A fter leaving the Marlboro H igh School I entered a new field of endeavor, life insurance. A visit from a most courteous and who esome insurance agent, while I was teaching at Tatum, first impresse me with the benefits of life insurance. This agent presented insur­ ance to me in a different light from that in which I had previously viewed it. I gave him my first application for a policy of a thousan dollars, the amount needed to reimburse my father for his expenses in sending me to college. Later that autumn when 1 began writing insurance I took out a policy of five thousand dollars with Mrs. Roper as beneficiary, to protect her against the mortgage on t e farm. Mrs. Roper’s father died when she was seven. H er mother ran the farm and trained her; therefore, she could manage as we as W ith her splendid, practical co-operation I was able to associate insur­ ance and farm work. L ife with her became a real partnership, omit details of this experience. M y insurance territory was main y Marlboro County, and mine was the task of increasing the conscious ness of insurance opportunities and responsibilities. I rode up an down the county, day by day, meeting farmers at their p ows, in their barns, and otherwise, coming at all times into persona ac quaintance with their families. I was fortunate in writing some appli­ cations for small amounts and in making many friends. This rubbing of elbows with fellow citizens was to bring interesting res ts. en I had written insurance about eighteen months, meanwhile looking after my farm, friends suggested that I run for the state legislature. 40 FIFTY YEARS OF PUBLIC LIFE That first phase of my experience in public service was influenced by the political and economic conditions in the community. In that era the Southern people were enthusiastic over efforts to industrialize the South, which may be said to have first taken substantial form at the Atlanta, Georgia, Cotton Exhibition held in the autumn of 1881. I recall the large newspaper headlines accompanying articles in the Atlanta Constitution the next day after the opening of the Exposition reading as follows: “ n e w e r a o p e n s f o r t h e s o u t h . ” The author of one of these articles described a feat that was accomplished at the Exposition: “ The Governor of Georgia wore at the Exposition Ball last night a suit of clothes made entirely of cotton, the cotton being picked from the field yesterday.” A new cotton mill had just been erected in this field in the suburbs of Atlanta. The industrial slogan was “ Bring the Cotton Mills to the Cotton Fields.” According to the article, the economic advantages and practical results of associat­ ing locally cotton manufacture with cotton growing had now been proved. Illustrations were used by speakers and writers to show that manufacturing was displacing agriculture in its first hold upon the people of the South, and especially in South Carolina. It was alleged that New England was “ skimming the cream” of Southern growers’ milk by taking our raw products and preparing them for consump­ tion, then reselling them to the Southern people at great profits. One impressive illustration hung around a homely table blessing of a clergyman in Darlington County, the Reverend Simpson Jones. On the day after Christmas the clergyman called on a family of his parishioners by the name of Owl. The family had just finished their dinner when Dr. Jones called. He was immediately invited to din­ ner, being advised, however, that they had pretty well picked the bones of the carcass of the turkey. He insisted upon giving another blessing for the food, which was as follows: “ God bless these Owls who ate this fowl and left the bones for Simpson Jones.” I was deeply impressed with manufacturers and the ingenuity of New England people from whom we were getting so many finished products, and I decided to make a trip to Boston to see what these New England people looked like. I went to Baltimore by train and thence by the Merchants and Miners Line to Boston, and stopped at the old Adams House, where I ate a good New England dinner. THE SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE 41 In the lobby after dinner, I made the acquaintance of a very gracious New England gentleman who was willing to talk and give me some information. I asked him if he could tell me some of the funda­ mental reasons why the N ew England people were so select, so in­ genious, and so successful in manufacturing. W ith a twinkle in his eye, he spoke as follows: “ D id you come in this morning against a heavy East wind?” I answered “ Yes.” “ Did you have baked beans for your dinner?” I admitted that there were baked beans on the table. “ In these two things you have the answer to your question as to why the people of N ew England are so select. It is this: Per­ sons of weak lungs are soon cut off by East winds and those of weak stomachs are early killed by baked beans! W e have here a survival °f the fittest.” Our talk convinced me that in South Carolina we, too, needed eliminations if we were to succeed in a variety of endeavors to get Us away from the one-crop system. Among these I visualized better educational advantages for the masses of the people, and I was gratified that Governor Tillm an was launching such efforts in the Clemson Agricultural and Mechanical College for farmers’ sons, and also in the W inthrop Normal College at Rock H ill for the farmers’ daughters. Next we needed to get rid of hookworm, control pellagra, provide better health supervision, and encourage rather than repel efforts to supplant agricultural civilization with industrial progress. The wonderful service of the Rockefeller Foundation in the study of Southern health problems was soon to be rendered. The year 1889 had ushered in a new era both in national and "
